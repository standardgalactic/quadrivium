Scope 
The purpose of this series is to foster the development of phenomenological philosophy through 
creative research. Contemporary issues in philosophy, other disciplines and in culture generally, offer 
opportunities for the application of phenomenological methods that call for creative responses. Al-
though the work of several generations of thinkers has provided phenomenology with many results 
with which to approach these challenges, a truly successful response to them will require building on 
this work with new analyses and methodological innovations.

PREFACE 
This encyclopedia presents phenomenological thought and the phenomenological movement 
within philosophy and within more than a score of other disciplines on a level accessible to 
professional colleagues of other orientations as well as to advanced undergraduate and graduate 
students. Entries average 3,000 words. In practically all cases, they include lists of works "For 
Further Study." The Introduction briefly chronicles the changing phenomenological agenda and 
compares phenomenology with other 20th Century movements. 
The 166 entries are a baut matters of seven sorts: ( 1) the faur broad tendencies and periods 
within the phenomenological movement; (2) twenty-three national traditions ofphenomenology; 
(3) twenty-two philosophical sub-disciplines, including those referred to with the formula "the 
philosophy of x"; (4) phenomenological tendencies within twenty-one non-philosophical dis-
ciplines; (5) forty major phenomenological topics; (6) twenty-eight leading phenomenological 
figures; and (7) twenty-seven non-phenomenological figures and movements ofinteresting sim-
ilarities and differences with phenomenology. 
Conventions 
Concern ing persons, years ofbirth and death are given upon first mention in an entry ofthe names 
of deceased non-phenomenologists. The names of persons believed tobe phenomenologists and 
also, for cross-referencing purposes, the titles of other entries are printed entirely in SMALL 
CAPITAL letters, also upon first mention. In addition, all words thus occurring in all small capital 
letters are listed in the index with the numbers of all pages on which they occur. To facilitate 
indexing, Chinese, Hungarian, and Japanese names have been re-arranged so that the personal 
name precedes the family name. 
Concerning works referred to, the complete titles ofbooks and articles are given in the original 
language or in a transliteration into Roman script, followed by literalistic translations and the 
year of original publication in parentheses or, where the date of composition is substantially 
earlier than that of publication, by the year of composition between brackets. 
History and Support of Project 
The project ofthis encyclopedia was initially proposed to the Center for Advanced Research in 
Phenomenology, Inc. by Alexander Schimmelpenninck ofKluwer Academic Publishers in May 
1992 and work began that Fali. During the editing process, he, Ms. Maja de Keijzer, and her 
secretary, Ms. Susan Vorstenbosch, have been of enormous help at every turn. 
The basic plan of this work was developed by the directors of the Center listed on the title 
page. All entries ha ve been examined by at least two of the team of editors. Other specialists 
consulted on difficult cases shall continue to remain anonymous, but are hereby thanked again.

The editorial oftice has been under the direction of Lester Embree as the William F. Dietrich 
Eminent Scholar and Professor of Philosophy at Florida Atlantic University, where help with 
technical editing has been gratefully received from Dr. Mano Daniel, Maj. Charles Pierce, Dr. 
Kevin Thompson, and Dr. Theodore Joadvine. Ms. Debbie Eskan cheerfully translated many 
computer diskettes. Finally, Dr. Betsy Behnke not only wrote and edited a number of entries, 
but also served as the phenomenologically insightful copy editor to whom readers owe far more 
than they will imagine.

Introduction 
Although anticipations can be found in the works of HENRI BERGSON, FRANZ BRENTANO, WILHELM 
DILTHEY, WILLIAM JAMES, and others, the phenomenological movement began in the reflections of 
EDMUND HUSSERL during the mid-1890s and is thus over a century old. It spread from GERMANY to 
JAPAN, RUSSIA, and SPAIN and also from philosophy to PSYCHIATRY before World War l; to AUSTRALIA, 
FRANCE, HUNGARY, THE NETHERLANDS AND FLANDERS, POLAND, and the UNITED STATES and to EDUCATION, 
MUSIC, and RELIGION during the 1920s; and to CZECHOSLOVAKIA, ITALY, KOREA, and YUGOSLAVIA and to 
ARCHITECTURE, LITERA TURE, and THEATER during the 1930s. Phenomenology then spread to PORTUGAL, 
SCANDINAVIA, and SOUTH AFRICA, and also to ETHNIC STUDIES, FEMINISM, FILM, and POLITICAL THEORY right 
after World War Il; then to CANADA, CHINA, and INDIA and to DANCE, GEOGRAPHY, LAW, and PSYCHOLOGY 
in the 1960s and 1970s; and finally to GREAT BRITAIN and also to ECOLOGY, ETHNOLOGY, and NURSING 
in the 1980s and 1990s. Given its spread into other disciplines as well as across the planet, 
phenomenology is arguably the major philosophical movement ofthe 20th Century. 
WHATISPHENOMENOLOGY? 
What are the typical characteristics of phenomenology? How does it re late with other philosoph-
ical movements? What are its tendencies and stages? Negatively speaking, phenomenologists 
tend to oppose the acceptance ofunobservable matters and grand systems erected in speculative 
thinking. Furtherrnore, they tend to oppose NATURALISM, the worldview generalized from mod-
em NATURAL sciENCE and TECHNOLOGY that bas been spreading from Northem Europe since the 
Renaissance. However, opposing naturalism is not the same as opposing natural science, as the 
phenomenological tradition within the philosophy of natural science shows. 
Unfortunately, opponents of naturalism (including opponents of behaviorism and positivism 
in psychology, social science, and philosophy) are often astonishingly eclectic and sometimes 
consider any forrn ofnon-naturalistic thought "phenomenology." This goes too far. Altematively, 
some consider only Husserl 's transcendental first philosophy to be phenomenology. Given, 
however, the non-transcendental tendencies within philosophical phenomenology as well as 
the great deal of non-philosophical phenomenology, this does not go far enough. The present 
encyclopedia urges a way between these extremes. 
There are fi ve positive features accepted by most phenomenologists, regardless of discipline, 
tendency, or period: 
(1) phenomenologists tend to justify cognition (and some also evaluation and action) with 
reference to EVIDENCE, which is awareness of a matter itself as disclosed in the most clear, distinct, 
and adequate way possible for something of its kind; 
(2) phenomenologists tend to believe that not only objects in the natural and cultural worlds, 
but also ideal objects, such as numbers, and even conscious life itself can be made evident and 
thus known about;

"encountering" as it is directed at objects and, correlatively, upon "objects as they are encoun-
tered" (this terminology is not widely shared, but the emphasis on a dual problematics and the 
refiective approach it requires are); 
( 4) phenomenologists tend to recognize the ro le of description in universal, a priori, or 
"eidetic" terms as prior to explanation by means of causes, purposes, or grounds; and 
(5) phenomenologists tend to debate whether or not what Husserl calls the transcendental 
phenomenological EPOCHE AND REDUCTION is useful or even possible. 
EVOLUTION OF THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL AGENDA 
F our successively dominant and sometimes overlapping tendencies and stages can be recognized 
within this century-old, international, and multidisciplinary movement. These can be charac-
terized as (a) REALISTIC, (b) CONSTITUTIVE, ( C) EXISTENTIAL, and ( d) HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY. 
Any attempt to summarize the wealth ofviews that fall under these headings would certainly be 
inadequate, but an attempt to chronicle the changing set of issues addressed in the movement, 
which can be called the phenomenological agenda, may be helpful. Words in ALL CAPITAL 
LETTERS name entries in which issues are discussed. 
There were later attempts to expand and rearrange the phenomenological agenda, but it was 
Husserl himself who originally drafted it. His Logische Untersuchungen (Logical Investigations, 
1900-1901) is most famous for its attack on rsYCHOLOGISM, which is the attempt to absorb logic 
into empirica! psychology. The phi1osophies of LOGIC and also MATHEMATICS, which Husserl 
considered continuous with logic, are then the first items on the agenda. LANGUAGE has also 
been an item from the outset, along with PERCEPTION and various types of RE-PRESENTATION ( e.g., 
EXPECTATION, IMAGINATION, and MEMORY). Finally, where the question ofmethodo1ogy is concerned, 
i.e., how he got his results, Husserl began to refiect from the outset upon what carne tobe called 
EIDETIC METHOD. 
Because of its refiective, evidentiat, and eidetically descriptive approach to both encoun-
terings and objects as encountered, as well as because of the issues on the agenda that are 
thus approached, this inauguration is often called, somewhat redundantly, "descriptive pheno-
menology." The four main tendencies within the ensuing movement are directly or indirectly 
branches sprouting from this stern. 
(1) REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY emerged in a group of young philosophers at the University 
of Munich led by JOHANNEs DAUBERT just after the turn of the century and was then extended 
principally by ADOLF REINACH to include students at Gottingen, where Husserl then taught. This 
tendency emphasizes eidetic method in the search for universal essences. ALEXANDER PFĂNDER, 
HERBERT SPIEGELBERG, and KARL SCHUHMANN and BARRY SMITH have led SUCCessive generations of 
realistic phenomenology. 
In "Die apriorischen Grundlagen des btirgerlichen Rechts" (The apriori foundations of civil 
1aw, 1911 ), Reinach added the philosophy of law to the phenomenological agenda. Furthermore, 
inDer F ormalismus in der Ethik und die materiale Wertethik (Formalism in ethics and nonformal 

INTRODUCTION 
3 
ethics of vaJues, 1913/1916), MAX SCHELER added not onJy ETHICS but aJso VALUE THEORY tO the 
agenda, and in Jater WOrks he added phiJosophy Of RELIGION and PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 
Moreover, EDITH STEIN added the phiJosophy of the HUMAN SCIENCES. finally, MORITZ GEIGER and 
ROMAN INGARDEN added AESTHETICS, ARCHITECTURE, MUSIC, and LITERATURE during the 192Qs and 
1930s; the phenomenology of FILM was initiated by Ingarden in the 1940s. 
(2) coNSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 's founding text is Husserl 's Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologischen Philosophie I (ldeas pertaining to a pure pheno-
menology and phenomenological philosophy, 1913). The earlier epistemological focus on logic 
and mathematics carne to include the philosophy of NATURAL sciENCE or at least physics, which 
!ater predominates in Husserl 's last work, Die Krisis der europăischen Wissenschaften und 
die transzendentale Phănomenologie (The crisis of the European sciences and transcendental 
phenomenology, 1936). Subsequent generations in constitutive phenomenology of the natural 
sciences include OSKAR BECKER, ARON GURWITSCH, and ELISABETH STROKER. 
Ideen I is, however, largely devoted to demonstrations of and reflections upon phenomen-
ological method. Most constitutive phenomenology relies on transcendental phenomenological 
EPOCHE AND REDUCTION. This procedure involves suspending acceptance ofthe pregiven status of 
conscious life as in the world and is performed in order to secure an ultimate intersubjective 
grounding for the world and the positive sciences concemed with it. 
Use of this method places constitutive phenomenology in the transcendental tradition that 
goes back at least to KANT within MODERN PHILOSOPHY, although Husserl related himselfprimarily 
to BRITISH EMPIRICISM. He differs from his transcendentalist predecessors in holding that conscious 
life in its transcendental status does not need to be deduced as the condition for the possibility 
of the woRLD because the way in which objects of all sorts are constituted in conscious life can 
be reflectively observed and described after the transcendental epoche has been performed. The 
other tendencies within phenomenology have not accepted this procedure. 
Husserl had reacted to Dilthey and others in his manifesta "Philosophie als strenge Wis-
senschaft" (1911) and had thereby begun to reflect on HISTORY. The concrete demonstration 
of constitutive phenomenology, as a tracing of experienced matters, formations, etc., back to 
the subjective processes, achievements, etc., in which they are encountered, was presented in 
his Ideen II [1912-15], a text that was not, however, published until1952, but was known in 
manuscript form to EDITH STEIN, MARTIN HEIDEGGER, LUDWIG LANDGREBE, and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY 
(but not ALFRED scHuTz, who nonetheless independently developed a convergent coNSTITUTIVE 
PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE NATURAL ATTITUDE focused on Social Jife). Nevertheless, this esoterically 
known text also added the soov to the agenda and showed clearly that the world is originally 
cultural. 
In Formale und transzendentale Logik (Formal and transcendental logic, 1929) and the 
posthumous Erfahrung und Urteil (Experience and judgement, 1939), Husserl retumed to logic 
and mathematics and thereby the task of the formal unification of all knowledge from the 
standpoint of transcendental constitutive phenomenology. GASTON BERGER, JEAN CAVAILLES, ARON 
GURWITSCH, EUGEN FINK, and LUDWIG LANDGREBE in the second generation and then J. N. MOHANTY, 

4 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
THOMAS M. SEEBOHM, ROBERT SOKOLOWSKI, and ELISABETH STROKER in the third generation have been 
leading but not uncritical advocates of constitutive phenomenology after Husserl. 
(3) EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY. The Second IDOSt influentia} phenomenologist is MARTIN HEI-
DEGGER, Husserl's chosen successor at Freiburg, who published Sein und Zeit in 1927. This 
incomplete masterpiece attempted to go beyond the regional ontologies sketched by Husserl to 
establish FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY and to place it at the top ofthe phenomenological agenda. Hei-
degger's work was, however, initially appreciated solely for its account ofhuman existence or 
DASEIN and thus not as the intended means to uncovering the meaning ofBeing (Sein). Existential 
phenomenology was thus inaugurated by a misinterpretation. 
HANNAH ARENDT seems to have been the first existential phenomenologist. This is evident in 
her dissertation, Die Liebesbegriffe bei Augustin (The concept of love in Augustine, 1929). 
Moreover, her essay "What is Existenz Philosophy?" ( 1946) refiects her acceptance during the 
1920s of methods from Husserl -
not, however, for philosophy of science, but rather for the 
problems ofhuman existence already raised in Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and KARL JASPERS as well 
as in Heidegger. 
With the rise to power in 1933 of National Socialism- which Heidegger supported-
German phenomenology was disrupted and the period of chiefiy existential phenomenology 
began in FRANCE. GABRIEL MARCEL independently focused on the problem of the BODY and made 
it prominent on the existential agenda, but the main figures in FRANCE are SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, and JEAN-PAUL SARTRE. Also infiuenced by Alexandre Kojeve (1902-1968) 
and J ean Wahl ( 1888-197 4 ), they expanded refiection on problems ofhuman existence to include 
issues raised in HEGEL and the recently discovered early MARX. Perhaps EMMANUEL LEVINAS also 
belongs to this tendency and, while the problem of INTERSUBJECTIVITY had also been addressed in 
Scheler, Husserl, and Schutz, it became central to the agenda for him. 
Human freedom was made prominent in L 'etre et le neant (Being and nothingness, 1943) by 
Sartre, who had earlier published books on the phenomenology of EMOTION and also IMAGINATION. 
He furthermore moved THEATER and urERATURE higher on the agenda. Other existential issues 
include ACTION, desire, conflict, the fragility of REASON, historical contingencies, human finitude, 
oppression, and death. The inclusion of GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY into phenomenology, which had 
been begun by Gurwitsch, was continued in Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenologie de la perception 
(Phenomenology of perception, 1945). Merleau-Ponty seems also to have made POLITICS an 
unignorable item with his Humanisme et terreur (1948). Although Arendt is more famous 
for her politica! theory, the problem of ETHNICITY, which first appeared in her articles such as 
"Race-Thinking before Racism" (1944) and then in The Origins of Totalitarianism ( 1951 ), 
would seem to be her most original contribution to the agenda. Ethnicity was also addressed 
in existential perspective by Beauvoir, by Levinas, and by Sartre in Rejlexions sur le question 
juive (Refiections on the Jewish question, 1946), and also in constitutive perspective by Schutz 
in "Equality and the Meaning Structure of the Social World" (1955). Beauvoir independently 
and quite infiuentially placed FEMINISM on the agenda in La deuxieme sexe ( 1949), asserting one 
is not bom but becomes a woman, although Edith Stein's posthumous Die Frau [ 1930] shows 

INTRODUCTION 
5 
that Beauvoir was not the first phenomenologist interested in gender. Beauvoir's reflections on 
old age appear, however, unprecedented. 
Existential phenomenology has been continued by such figures as JOHN COMPTON, MICHEL HENRY, 
MAURICE NATANSON, and BERNHARD WALDENFELS. It is not inconceivable that interest in it COUld be 
revived through study of Arendt and Beauvoir. And it is also not irrelevant that the phenomen-
ological tendencies in non-philosophical disciplines have tended to find great affinity with 
existential phenomenology. 
( 4) Just as realistic and then constitutive phenomenology chiefly stern from Husserl, not 
only existential but also the fourth tendency, HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY, chiefly stern from 
Heidegger. According to Sein und Zeit, all of human existence is interpreti ve and hen ce there 
is no access to anything except through understanding ofthe matters themselves as they appear 
within context. The beginning ofthis fourth tendency can be traced back to HANS-GEORG GADAMER 's 
phenomenological interpretations ofGreek texts, particularly Platons dialektische Ethik (Plata 's 
dialectica! ethics, 1931 ). The tendency reemerged after the Nazi period and World War II with the 
publication ofhis Wahrheit und Methode (Truth and method, 1960), which has had a considerable 
impact. Other leaders of this tendency are PAUL RICCEUR in France (Le conjlit des interpretations 
[The COnflict of interpretations, 1969]), PATRICK HEELAN, DON IHDE, GRAEME NICHOLSON, JOSEPH J. 
KOCKELMANS, and CALVIN O. SCHRAG in North America, GIANNI VATTIMO and CARLO SINI in ITALY, etc. 
In contrast to existential phenomenology, hermeneutica! phenomenology fully appreciates 
Heidegger's central concern with Being. TECHNOLOGY, which was introduced as an issue for 
phenomenology in Sein und Zeit, can also be said tobe first widely accepted on the hermeneuti-
ca! version ofthe phenomenological agenda. Otherwise, the issues of hermeneutica! phenomen-
ology include the established concems of aesthetics, ethics, history, language, law, literature, 
perception, politics, religion, the philosophy of the natural and especially the human sciences, 
etc. What is different is how it approaches them, i.e., the method ofHERMENEuncs. Hermeneutica! 
phenomenology has also led to much scholarship on eminent texts of major figures in the history 
of philosophy and there has been extensive influence within the human sciences. 
The periods and geographical centers of the history of the phenomenological movement 
correspond to when and where each of the four tendencies ha ve received the predominance of 
attention. Realistic and constitutive phenomenology continue, but their original and strongest 
periods were in Germany before and after World War 1. The existential period extended from the 
1930s to the 1960s and was centered in France. Most of the attention during the hermeneutica! 
period ofthe 1960s through 1980s was in the United States, where phenomenologists numbered 
not in the scores, but in the hundreds. 
With the COllapse ofthe UN ION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, greater contact with the remarkably 
enduring Eastem European traditions of phenomenology, the growing interest in phenomenology 
in Latin America and Asia and indeed most nations, and finally, the increase in international 
travel and communication, it seems plausible at the time of writing to suppose that the period 
of American phenomenology is waning and that a fifth and planetary period is beginning. If so, 
how the agenda might be reordered or otherwise altered during the phenomenological move-

ment's second century must remain tobe seen. Perhaps there will bea retum to philosophical 
anthropology and reflections relating to ecology, gender, ethnic studies, intercultural phenomen-
ology, and religion, as well as ethics, politics, and philosophy of human and natural kinds of 
sctence. 
CONTRASTS WITH PHENOMENOLOGY 
Phenomenology arose in ambivalent interaction with neo-Kantianism and is currently con-
trasted in the Anglo-American world with ANALYnc PHILOSOPHY and intemationally with MARXISM 
and rsYCHOANALYSis. Discussion of these connections may shed further light on precisely what 
phenomenology is. 
(1) Where the neo-Kantians are concemed, as early as 1886 Husserl expressed antipathy 
to Hermann Cohen ( 1842-1918) with respect to concepts and principles of mathematics and 
higher analysis. In 1908, however, he wrote to Jonas Cohn (1869-1947) that he was himself 
working on a critique of REASON in which the transcendental-logica! would be grounded in the 
transcendental-phenomenological, and in 1925 he admitted to ERNST CASSIRER that once he had 
leamed to see Kant's thought in his own perspective, he was able to recognize the value as well 
as the limits of Kant and to profit from reading him and genuine Kantians. 
Husserl's correspondence with Paul Natorp (1854-1924) began in 1894 and focused initially 
on problems in the philosophy of geometry and SPACE. The latter's review of the Logische 
Untersuchungen affected the transition to the transcendental-constitutive phenomenology ofthe 
Ideen 1. But there was still a difference between them conceming beginning from the highest 
epistemic-critical first principles or, as Husserl advocated, starting at the bottom and advancing, 
step by step, to the higher levels. 
Hermann Cohen began from the.fact of scientific knowledge. "Experience" for him is given 
in the form of science. There is thus no need for intuition. The conditions for the possibility of 
the fact of science are also the conditions for the possibility of objects of experience. There is 
no need to appeal to consciousness. As Hans Wagner puts it, what we have is pure noematic 
"Geltungsreflexion" (reflection on what is accepted or posited). 
Also, for Natorp, the most radical grounding, die letzte Begrundung, is not subjective but 
objective in terms of the lawfulness that constitutes objectivity. He agrees with Husserl 's purely 
objective account oflogic in the first volume ofthe Logische Untersuchungen, the Prolegomema 
zur reinen Logik (1900), but suspects him of psychologism when he attempts to give logic a 
phenomenological grounding. 
Husserl also opposed the tendency of Marburg neo-Kantians to reduce philosophy to the 
methodology of the exact sciences. In the absence of a concept of the given, they reduce the 
object of inquiry to an X for endless determinations. Husserl 's ramified concepts of intuition 
and object and the substantive cognition of essences amount to a protest against this notion of 
philosophy. 
NICOLAI HARTMANN and Cassirer were in fact influenced by Husserl. Cassirer places great em-

INTRODUCTION 
7 
phasis on the concept of Sinn or MEANING; takes the Husserlian hyle-morphe distinction over into 
his theory of the "symbolic pregnance" of ali experience; and uses the phenomenological idea 
of meaning-fulfillment to discuss the sensuous form of meanings. Hartmann departs from the 
neo-Kantian conception of philosophy as methodology of science and works out a phenomeno-
logically-oriented ontology. He recognizes the great value of phenomenological method, but 
supplements it with a method of aporia, which recognizes a metaphysical core of insoluble 
problems. 
Tuming now to Martin Heidegger and the neo-Kantians, there is a detailed critique ofNatorp 
in the early Marburg lectures. In particular, Natorp's "allgemeine Psychologie" is characterized 
there as "formale Phănomenologie," and WILHELM oiLTHEv's work is said to be close to the 
origin (urspriingsnah), while Natorp is far from it (ursprungsfern). Also on Heidegger's view, 
Heinrich Rickert (1863-1936) is closer to phenomenology than the Marburg school because, 
largely under the influence of Emil Lask (1875-1915), Rickert recognizes the undeniable but 
ultimately irrational aspects ofthe contents of consciousness, e.g., blue and red as seen patches 
of color, which cannot be reduced to concepts. 
Of ali the South German neo-Kantians, Lask stood closest to phenomenology, tried to incor-
porate Husserl 's theory of ideal meanings into his own theory of judgment, and seem to ha ve 
had a considerable influence on Heidegger's early thinking, especially with his emphasis on 
irreducible "historical facticity." Although Heidegger profoundly acknowledges the importance 
of Lask for his own thought, Husserl's response to Lask is less clear; he inclines more toward 
Rickert. 
Basically, transcendental phenomenology and neo-Kantianism had different understandings 
of Kant, especially of Kant's theory of consciousness, and also of the Kantian transcendental 
deduction. For phenomenology, the subjective deduction is the more valuable part; for the 
neo-Kantians, the objective deduction is the core ofthe argument. 
Finally, it must be mentioned that there is a different complex relationship in France between 
existential phenomenology and especially the neo-Kantianism of Leon Brunschvicg ( 1869-
1943 ), a relationship that has yet to be fully analyzed in the scholarly literature. 
(2) While neo-Kantianism is the movement that phenomenology chiefly related to in its 
original development, the major alternative at the end ofthe 20th century is ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY. 
Neither position has a homogeneous doctrine, but there are shared ways of doing philosophy 
within each. In the case of analytic philosophy, the common assumption is that philosophy has 
to do with language, while nonlinguistic facts do not belong to its domain, and the treatment of 
languagc is often called "analysis"- hen ce the designation "analytic philosophy." It is analysis 
either ofusage or of MEANING; its concern is either with ordinary language or with ideallanguage 
(which perspicuously reflects the logica! structure of ordinary language ); and its goat is either to 
dissolve philosophical problems ("by letting the fly out ofthe fly bottle") and thereby to act as a 
kind oftherapy, or to provide, through the analysis of meanings, the foundation for the sciences. 
From its inception, phenomenology shared the anti-metaphysical spirit of analytic philosophy, 
shared a belief in the importance of logic and mathematics for philosophy, and inspired a sort of 

8 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
minute, careful, "ground level" fieldwork avoiding large generalizations. In a letter to Natorp of 
March 14, 1897, Husserl wrote, "Ich bin ein langsamer Denker und bin nicht zufrieden, solange 
die grosse Noten und Wechsel nicht in baarer Miinze in Kleingeld umgesetzt sind" ("I am a slow 
thinker, and am not satisfied as long as the large banknotes and bills are not tumed into small 
change"). 
Despite their shared interest in language, meaning, and careful analysis (and in making dis-
tinctions), phenomenology and analytic philosophy go their different ways. What divides them 
is, in the first place, a difference in philosophy of language and meaning. Analytic philosophy, 
at its inception, subscribed to some variety or other of the verification theory of meaning; then, 
with the demise of LOGICAL rosiTIVISM, pursued a theory of meaning as use (such as in a lan-
guage game); and, in its latest phase, has abandoned "meaning" altogether in fa vor of a purely 
referential theory or a pragmatist account. 
Phenomenology incorporates language into a larger theory of INTENTIONALITY, so that the 
meaning of signs is derivative from the meaning of intentiona! acts, the latter being construed 
as ideal entities much like the Sinne of GOTTLOB FREGE, but nevertheless as correlates of acts. The 
proximity to Frege has created the impression of a more general proximity of phenomenology 
and analytic philosophy, the differences notwithstanding. As analytic philosophy abandoned 
meanings for split references in rossiBLE woRLDS, interpreters of Husserl found their way to 
construe Husserlian "horizons" as "possible worlds." And as Fregeans in England downplayed 
the Sinn and carne up with a Russellian reading of Frege, some Husserlians downplayed the 
"noema" in favor of a realistic reading of intentionality. Nevertheless, while some thus tried to 
relate Husserl and Frege, most ofphenomenology continued on its part to tackle larger problems 
of "the transcendental ego," "constitution of the world," "time," "Dasein," etc., in terms that, 
for analytic thinkers, were too metaphysical, but for phenomenology were intimately involved 
in ali its investigations. 
(3) MARXISM is another large, global philosophical movement with which phenomenology, 
initially very different in orientation and origin, carne into fruitful contact. Husserl himself does 
not seem to have had any interest in Marxism. The materialistic underpinning ofMarx's thinking 
provided by Engels must have appeared antithetical to his position, just as the reductionism of 
much of Marxism and the naivety of the Marxist theory of knowledge could not be welcomed 
by phenomenology. Likewise, the individualistic, ego-centered, transcendental thinking could 
not but be opposed to the primacy of nature, society, and economics. 
However, points of contact between the two movements soon developed. For this to be 
possible, Marx's own thinking, especially in his early works, had tobe separated from the !ater 
works and from the ideas of Engels, and the official, dogmatic Marxism of Lenin and Stalin 
had to be rejected in fa vor of the hermeneutic strand within phenomenology, the !ater critique 
of positivistic science, and the rootedness of science in the lifeworld. 
In this Auseinandersetzung, the early work of Gyorgy Lukacs ( 1885-1971 ), the existential 
phenomenology of Sartre, and the radical phenomenology of ENZO PACI naturally carne together. 
Husserl 's !ater conception of history as a practica! teleology rooted in the bodily-social activity

of the subject and Marx's emphasis upon "sensuous activity" are brought together by LUDWIG 
LANDGREBE. The Marxist struggle against the fetishism of commodities and Husserl 's critique of 
the objectivism of the sciences are brought together by Paei. If the task of phenomenology is to 
reinstate the genuine subjectivity ofhuman beings, freed from every fetishism and every mask, 
then the goal of Marxism may be interpreted as restoring to humankind its authentic humanity. 
Sartre, in his late work Critique de la raison dialectique (Critique of dialectica! reason, 1960) 
regards Marxism as the "untranscendable philosophy for our time" and tries to reconcile it with 
his own phenomenological starting point. Simone de Beauvoir characterizes Marxism, at its 
best, as a "radical humanism," while Merleau-Ponty recognizes and appropriates the Marxist 
discovery of social existence as the most interior dimension ofhuman subjectivity. 
It has also not escaped the notice of many disceming critics that Marxism, at its best, has 
always been a hermeneutic philosophy that aims at going behind the seeming evidences of 
direct "seeing" in order to discover the hidden meaning in the historical and social stratum of 
work, need, and labor. Finally, one needs only to look at the two volumes of Phănomenologie 
und Marxismus (1977-79), edited by Waldenfels, Broekman, and Pazanin- containing the 
pa pers presented at a conference held in 197 5 in Dubrovnik- to realize the fruitfulness, and 
yet variety, of concems generated by that theme. 
(4) Phenomenology's relation to PSYCHOANALYSIS is not very different from its relation to 
Marxism. However, in this case, one shall mention that Freud and Husserl were fellow students 
in Brentano's classes on psychology. Even if Husserl does not speak about Freud, he did 
come to recognize "unconscious intentionality," and left much room for phenomenology's 
coming to terms with psychoanalysis. This has happened in many different ways -
if we 
leave aside Sartre's early rejection of the unconscious. Thus one may read psychoanalysis as 
an "archaeology of the subject" (Ricreur), or follow its lead to dig beneath language for pre-
objective meaning structures in "expressive flesh" (Merleau-Ponty), or, rejecting a realism of 
unconscious intentionalities, one may use the Husserlian idea of giving meaning to hyletic 
data to understand the nature of psychoanalytic therapy. Thus a phenomenological reading of 
psychoanalysis tends to free psychoanalysis from its self-understanding as a natural science, it 
rejects a mechanical account ofmentallife in terms of"repression," and it does not want to posit 
the unconscious as a theoretical entity for explanatory purposes. The task then has been to open 
an experiential access into the unconscious, by retuming to pre-affective Urassociation within 
the hyletic field that "awakens" the ego and stimulates it into activity. The other line of approach 
is to find in Freudian thinking a discovery ofthe ontologica! grounding of consciousness, with its 
intentionalities, in the pre-conscious being of 'desire' through the process of the hermeneutics 
of"suspicion." Thus, in a variety ofways, phenomenology has contributed, especially amongst 
French philosophers, to new and creative interpretations and appropriations ofFreud's thinking.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ARTICULATIONS OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
The word "phenomenology" not only stands for a substantive philosophy (as in the writings of 
Husserl, in some of Heidegger's works, and in Sartre and Merleau-Ponty), but for a distinctive 
approach that, applied to a specific domain X, gives rise to what may be called the "pheno-
menology of X." Thus we have phenomenology ofreligion, phenomenology of natural science, 
phenomenology ofhuman science, phenomenology ofliterature, phenomenology ofperception, 
and so forth. 
Then again, sometimes an existing discipline or specialty receives the modifier "phenomen-
ological" when the approach, or even some results of phenomenological philosophy (such as 
the thesis of intentionality), are adopted or adapted in that discipline. Thus we ha ve phenomen-
ological geography, phenomenological psychiatry, phenomenological sociology, and so forth. 
These "phenomenological" disciplines vary according to which component they adopt ( eidetic 
description, phenomenological epoche, meaning constitution, etc.) 
The same sorts ofvariations occur in the "phenomenology of ... " disciplines. Thus the pheno-
menology of religion may be descriptive of the essential structures of ali religious experience 
as well as of religious objects; it may be a search for religious meaning and so presuppose 
a phenomenological reduction; it may be an inquiry into what religions mean for Dasein 's 
being-in-the-world and authenticity, etc. 
What is common to these is an experiential approach that does not first decide what the world, 
or the nature of things, is like and then seeks to fit phenomena to that conception either by 
reductive or explanatory hypotheses. Instead, it first focuses on the phenomena, on how matters 
are encountered precisely as they are encountered, and then- if needed- construes the world 
so that the phenomena are saved. 
And while most ofthe special employments ofphenomenology (both "phenomenology of ... " 
and "phenomenological ... ") remain satisfied with a reflective and descriptive approach, be it 
eidetic or an empirica!, one should not suppose that the constitutive tendency is a purely 
philosophical discipline. Schutz's work shows that it does not need tobe. 
Finally, if an important test of the power of a philosophical movement is how fruitful it has 
proven infields other than pure philosophy, then the history ofthe phenomenological movement 
bears testimony to the enonnous fecundity of phenomenology- compared to which the other 
philosophical currents oftoday seem barren.

ACTION 
Like PERCEPTION and LANGUAGE, 
action does not merely take place within the world, 
but rather contributes to its constitution. A phenomen-
ological philosophy of action that wants to do justice 
to this central phenomenon needs to develop on differ-
ent levels. First, it has to grasp the specific character 
of action in contrast to physical processes, biologica! 
reactions, or programmed operations, and in contrast 
to other forms of human conduct such as work, play, 
or pure wishing. Second, it has to locate action within 
the context of life or existence as a whole. Taking into 
consideration the vital infrastructure as well as the cul-
tural framework of action, the phenomenology of ac-
tion meets not only with HERMENEUTICS, but also with 
SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY, and PSYCIIIATRY. Finally, the 
phenomenology of action opens up to a comprehensive 
philosophy of practice. On this last level, phenomen-
ology establishes connections not only with the prac-
tica! philosophy of Aristotle or FJCHTE, but also with 
MARX and pragmatism. Without its oscillation between 
a narrower and a broader concept of action, pheno-
menology would degenerate to merely one paradigm 
among others. 
The views of action we find within the phenomen-
ological movement differ considerably. Nevertheless, 
there are some main features that are present every-
where, and there are others that have been and remain 
especially fruitful. Generally speaking, phenomenolo-
gists have not so much worked on a coherent theory 
of action as they have done a great deal to focus on 
the phenomenon of action without squeezing it into 
ready-made forms. 
It was the central theory of MEANING and JNTENTION-
ALITY that gave access to specific forms of phenomen-
ology of action, called Praktik by EDMUND HUSSERL. 
Thus the classical theory of will and decision was 
taken up in a new way by Husserl himself in the 
fifth of his Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901 ), 
in his Vorlesungen iiber Ethik und Wertlehre [ 1908-
14], and in Jdeen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie 
und phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913 ); it was 
unfolded more extensively by ALEXANDER PFĂNDER 
in Phănomenologie des Wollens (1900) and by MAX 
SCHELER in Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die ma-
teriale Wertethik (Formalism in ethics and nonformal 
ethics ofvalues, 1 913/1916), and, severa] decades !ater, 
it was enriched by the achievements ofthe philosophy 
of existence, by PAUL RICrEUR in his thesis on Le volon-
taire et l 'involontaire ( 1950). 
In contrast to the Cartesian and empiricist traditions, 
act ion is no longer conceived as a conjunction of psy-
chic volition and physical effect. It appears instead as 
"experience of transition" ( Ubergangserlebnis): will-
ing as practica! intention is fulfilled by the executive 
action. This transition is initiated by a creative "Jet it 
be," afiat as Husserl puts it, following WILLIAM JAMES. 
The counterpart of the noesis of action (Handeln) is 
the noema of act (Hand/ung). The willed as willed 
(Gewolltes als Gewolltes) turns into the done as done 
( Getanes als Getanes), into the pragma (Ricreur) or 
deed (Tat), which, in terms of being intended, means 
more than a pure fact ( Tatsache ). As Scheler in particu-
lar emphasizes, what we will do or intend appears only 
in what we do and is not accessible to some kind of 
introspection; to that extent, every private intention or 
action is excluded. Practica] intentionality includes the 
possibility of do ing something other than what we will 
to do, as in the case of failure. Furthermore, it means 
that we always want to do more than we do. Like per-
ception, action has its open horizons, it is embedded in 
practica! contexts. As the following aspects show, this 
dynamization ofaction surpasses the level of static and 
eidetic descriptions. 
Actions that intervene in the course of events sup-
pose the cooperation of our BODY, which roots us in 
the world. Action in ali its forms appears as embod-
ied action. At this point Husserl 's phenomenology of 
pure consciousness, which tends to found action in 
a consciousness of action, reaches its limits. The co-
operation of the body is first shown by the fact that 
no action would be set in motion without the moving 
forces of motives that appeal, stimulate, or repe! and 
deter us, turning the so-called affections into a sort of 
"practica! affection." Husserl's theory of original pas-
sivity makes clear that the other side of every action 
is passion. Free actions are never achieved by pure de-
cision; they are at least motivated by freedom itself,

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
to which we are "condemned" (JEAN-PAUL SARTRE). EM-
MANUEL LEVINAS has radicalized this aspect by posing 
an original passivity, more original than ali our own 
do ing and undergoing. In another way, MARTIN HEIDEG-
GER 's notion of Gelassenheit points to a background of 
action that escapes every form of activism. 
Second, the cooperation of our body depends on 
the fact that doing includes practica! possibilities 
of being able to do (Tunkănnen, savoir~faire). The 
counterpart of being moved by motives is a moving 
oneself (Sich-bewegen) whose spontaneity surpasses 
the control of the agent. Our own actions may sur-
prise us. As Husserl shows, especially in the anal-
yses of Ideen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie II ( 1912-15), ac-
tions are more staged than produced. 
Finally, by repeating the same action we acquire 
habits, incorporated in our practica! body and form-
ing a practica! background where practica! sense be-
comes sedimented. MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY was the 
first to emphasize the radical embodiment of action, 
making use of the research results of medical anthro-
pologists such as FREDERIK J.J. BUYTENDIJK, KURT GOLD-
STEIN, ERWIN W. STRAUS, and VIKTOR VON WEIZSĂCKER 
and- in GEST ALT PSYCHOLOGY- SUCh figures as Wolf-
gang Kohler (1887-1967). Thus in his early book La 
structure du comportement ( 1942) he integrates hu-
man action into the larger framework of a kind of 
non-behavioristic behavior that creates sense via self-
structuring and self-organizing processes; these analy-
ses were continued by CHARLES TAYLOR in The Expla-
nation of Behaviour ( 1964 ). In his second major book, 
Phimomimologie de la perception ( 1945), Merleau-
Ponty bases the orientation and formation of actions in 
the spatial motility of our body. Through this approach 
the phenomenology of action discovers its own mar-
gins in terms of parapraxes (Fehlhandlungen) whose 
own sense escapes them, and in terms of compensatory 
actions (Ersatzhandlungen) by which the agent's or-
ganism adjusts to new conditions, as in the case of 
construing a phantom limb. Embodied actions are ex-
posed to disturbances and at the same time are capa-
ble of productive deviations from normality. Here the 
phenomenology of action reaches the field of PSYCHO-
ANALYSJS and psychiatry. 
Ever since MAX WEBER, action oriented to the action 
of others has been called social action. Husserl adopts 
the sense of this concept as used by ADOLF REINACH in 
the latter's writings on "Die apriorischen Grundlagen 
des bi.irgerlichen Rechtes" (1913 ). Social acts such as 
promising or asking are conceived as intentiona! acts 
that need to be perceived, understood, and completed 
by others. In this way, intention and fulfillment are 
distributed to different interacting persons. But if we 
presuppose with Husserl that community is not only 
sustained but even created by communication, then 
social acts do not consist only in my own act being 
completed and confirmed by the Other, but it means that 
we are acting together, co-creating a common sense. 
However, in Husserl -
and especially in ALFRED 
SCHUTZ in his fundamental work Der sinnhafte Aufbau 
der sozialen Welt ( 1932)- the socialization of action 
is checked by the attempt to constitute the otherness of 
the Others exclusively on the ground of my own ex-
perience ofthe Other. This egocentric trance is broken 
by Merleau-Ponty. Already in Phenomeno/ogie de la 
perception he starts off from an anonymous, pre- and 
postpersonal existence. In co-perception as well as in 
interlocution and interaction the own perspective and 
that of the other slide into each other in a sort of syn-
thesis of transition. They refer to a kind of intermonde 
(interworld), a world between us that belongs neither 
to me nor to the Other. My own speech and action is in-
terwoven with the speech and action of the Other, the 
Other acting within myself and myself acting within 
the Other by a sort of chiasm. Thus Husserl 's concept 
of intersubjectivity is explicitly redescribed in terms 
of common corporeity in Merleau-Ponty's !ater work. 
The self-reference of our own body, being touched and 
touching at once, is extended to the body of Others 
as if we were organs of one and the same intercor-
poreite (intercorporeity). Finally, intercorporeity and 
interworld are enrooted in the elements of chair (flesh), 
which pervades everything and everyone. There are no 
individuals given in advance, there are only processes 
of individualization and socialization, both intercon-
nected with each other. This view also differs from 
the concept of interaction in Ji.irgen Habermas, which 
consists in the mere coordination of individual actions, 
based on common rules, and oriented on universal va-
lidity claims. 
Of special importance is the relation between action 
and LANGUAGE, not least of ali with regard to the de-
bate with ANAL YTIC PHILOSOPHY. In this context we lea ve 

ACTION 
asi de the general question ofhow to re late the language 
in which theorists speak about action to action itself. 
What remains is the specific question of the practica] 
language in which the agent expresses his or her own 
action. Ricreur addresses this question under the ti-
tie of Si?tnantique de l'action ( 1977) by distinguishing 
between three levels of practica! speech: the level of 
concepts, such as intention, motive, responsibility, with 
which the agent describes his or her actions; the level of 
sentences, with which, by uttering them, the actor does 
something, carrying out certain speech acts; and the 
level of arguments, with which the agent explains or 
justifies the actions. Furthermore, he tries to combine 
phenomenological and analytic approaches by locating 
both on two different methodologicallevels, the latter 
starting from given expressions, the former trying to 
found the linguistic sense in a basic dicibilite du vecu 
( expressibility of experience ). 
But the relationship between language and action 
is not restricted to speech about action, to speech of 
action, and to speech as action, for we are further con-
fronted with speech within action. Thus Karl Blihler 
(1879-1963), who was perhaps the first to speak of a 
Sprechhandlung in his Sprachtheorie ( 1934 ), consid-
ers special forms of "empractical" or "sympractica1" 
speech where speaking and acting interpenetrate. 
Finally, in opposition to speech as action (Sprech-
handlung), there is the possibility of action as speech 
(Handlungssprache), embedded in the larger sphere of 
body language. We often respond to a request by doing 
what is requested. Such an intertwining of speaking 
and doing, which allows for a contradiction between 
words and deeds, refers to systems of signs or symbols 
or to discourses that encompass speaking and do ing. As 
Merleau-Ponty stresses against Sartre in Les aventures 
de la dialectique (1955), there is no direct action im-
mediately confronting humans and things, but rather 
every action is indirect, traversing an intermonde of 
cultural-historical symbols. 
The different forms of embodiment, social connec-
tions, and symbolic mediations condense into a world 
of praxis or into the world as such. Here the narrow 
concept of action is extended to the larger concept 
of human praxis. But the way to this general view is 
paved by the use of the more modest concept offield, 
which was transferred from physics to the analysis of 
human behavior by Gestalt theorists like Kurt Lewin 
13 
( 1890--1947). Taking up this terminology, Husserl, in 
his Ideen 1 and II, speaks of a "field of freedom" or 
a "field of praxis," and he was followed here by au-
thors such as ARON GURWITSCH and Merleau-Ponty. The 
concept of field has a certain affinity to the concept 
of miii eu used by Scheler in the context of ETHICS and 
sociology ofknowledge and further developed by Gur-
witsch in his book on Mitmenschliche Begegnungen 
in der Milieuwelt [Human encounters in the milieu-
world, 1933]. The "field" is defined as a limited whole, 
oriented to a certain standpoint, pointing to open hori-
zons, capable ofbeing transformed into another whole. 
Action that takes place in a particular field has its sit-
uations, circumstances, paths, accesses, and obstacles, 
spread in a "hodological space" (Lewin). 
The topology of action is complemented by a 
chronology of action. Action as goal-oriented and 
partly planned behavior, based on preceding experi-
ences and actions, generates a temporality of its own. 
The decidingfiat emerges from surprising or recurrent 
events, from acts of hesitation or precipitation. The 
temporality of action is articulated by Heidegger under 
the aspect of Entwurf and Geworfenheit, interpreted by 
Sartre as project and facticity. Schutz in his Collected 
Pa pers I ( 1962) defines act ion as "pre-conceived" con-
duct and distinguishes between "in-order-to" motives" 
referring to the fu ture and "because" motives referring 
to the past. 
The organization of action in terms of space and 
time is completed by certain systems of relevance es-
pecially investigated by Schutz and Gurwitsch. Rele-
vance means that from everything that could be done 
here and now something is singled out that should 
be done. Using distinctions made by Gurwitsch in his 
book The Field of Consciousness (1964) drawing on 
Gesta1t psychology, one could say that every action 
constitutes a thematic field, pushing certain possibili-
ties to the margins. 
The global concept of world introduces the total-
ity of spatial, temporal, and thematic references. It is 
the primary ground from which every action starts, 
and the universal horizon toward which it moves, but 
this holds true not only for action. When Husserl re-
lates the possibilities of a world and the possibility 
of other worlds to Vermăglichkeiten (abilities) of the 
subject, he includes every form of experience and be-
havior. Ultimately, theory itself, including phenomen-

14 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ological theory, becomes a special form of"theoretical 
praxis" according to Die Krisis der europăischen Wis-
senschaften und die transzendentale Phănomenologie 
(1936). Heidegger's analysis of DASEIN points in the 
same direction. But beyond that, Heidegger hesitates 
to use the concept of Handeln because he goes back 
to possibilities of Dasein beyond activity and passiv-
ity, beyond theoretical and practica! capabilities. So in 
Sein und Zeit (1927), instead of Handeln or Praxis, 
he speaks of besorgende Fiirsorge (concernful solic-
itude) or besorgender Umgang (concernful dealings), 
which is endowed with Umsicht (circumspection) as a 
specific form of Sicht (sight), irreducible to theoretical 
Ansicht (view) or Einsicht (insight). 
This indirect valorization of practice, provoking the 
claim in the "Brief Liber den Humanismus" ( 194 7) that 
"thinking acts in that it thinks" ("das Denken han-
delt, indem es denkt"), brings phenomenology, to a cer-
tain extent, closer to pragmatism and Marxism. Schutz 
thus considers the world of working ( Wirkwelt) as a 
paramount reality. On the other hand, in his Critique 
de la raison dialectique ( 1960), Sartre integrates the 
projects ofthe individual existence into the framework 
of Marxist praxis. Even the Praxis group organized 
in Yugoslavia in the 1960s gives Marxism a certain 
Heideggerian flair. 
However, for a long time a certain resistance has 
been growing against Heidegger's reinterpretation of 
action. Thus in Mitmenschliche Begegnungen, Gur-
witsch, referring to the child 's flexible play with things, 
argues that the pluriformity and polyvalence of things 
get lost when the status of things is derived from the 
normal expediency of tools (Zeug). Finally, HANNAH 
ARENDT, who in her famous book on The Human Con-
dition ( 1958) tries to renew the Aristotelian concept of 
praxis, opposes the widespread confusion of praxis and 
poiesis. The public place of common act ion disappears 
when act ion gets absorbed by needs-fulfilling labor and 
by the anonymity oftechnological work. Furthermore, 
the relation between TECHNOLOGY and praxis, explained 
by authors Jike HUBERT DREYFUS and DON IHDE, remains 
an open question. 
Finally, the inner divergencies and the outer con-
flicts of phenomenology and especially of the pheno-
menology of action are concentrated in the central and 
basic problem of REASON or order of action. Unavoid-
ably, Husserl 's "logos ofthe aesthetic world" resounds 
in a "logos of the practica! world." As in the case of 
perception, we have to ask if action does not ha ve an 
autochthonous character insofar as the order of prac-
tice originates in practice itself and not elsewhere. If 
we further assume that the order of practice is incor-
porated in limited fields of action, the question arises 
whether we are confronted with one single order or 
rather with orders in the plural, excluding each other 
and, to some extent, mutually conflicting. 
Possible answers to these questions concern prac-
ticality as such, and depend on how action itself is 
conceived. With regard to the classical philosophy 
of action, we can distinguish at least three different 
paradigms. Action is submitted to an order of goals 
and values, to an order of norms and rules, or to an or-
der of causality. The phenomenology of action, based 
on the assumption of practica! intentions and fulfill-
ments, certainly grants privi lege to the first paradigm, 
without completely excluding the others. If we adhere 
to Husserl 's initial attempt, the intentionality of action 
is, on the one hand, bound to a formal VALUE THEORY 
and formal theory of practice, which determine the 
general conditions of axiologica! and practica! reason 
(see !deen !). 
On the other hand, practica! intentions are founded 
in the intentionality of individual and social impulses 
(Triebintentionalităt) mentioned in the posthumously 
published writings. Actions ofthe subject are thus not 
only conditioned by trans-subjective rule-structures, 
they are also founded in pre-subjective impulses. To 
some extent, this resembles the trichotomy of ego, su-
perego and id in Sigmund Freud ( 1856--1939). It should 
be considered an advantage of the phenomenological 
approach, compared to the rule-orientation of ORDI-
NARY LANGUAGE PHILOSOPHY and COGNITIVE SCIENCE and 
the norm-orientation of Continental discourse ethics, 
that the genesis of practica! sense, its corporeal initia-
tion and habitualization, its unconscious motives, with 
ali its openness and ambiguities, is not overshadowed 
by questions of legitimacy. Just as speaking and writ-
ing are always more than correct speaking and writing, 
actions are always more than right or wrong actions. 
Nevertheless, we have to ask if creativity of action is 
not underdetermined when action is based on a pre-
given order of goals or, in Husserl 's term, rooted in a 
pervading teleology and rationality (see the Krisis). 
Embedded in such a teleological order, action would 

ACTION 
be nothing more than a means to an end, whereas within 
a normative order it would be reduced to cases of a rule, 
and within a causal order, to causal effects. In opposi-
tion to this, the possibility of an autochthonous order 
of practice, originating in practice itself, may be un-
folded in two steps. First, action has tobe interpreted in 
terms of creativity in its fuli sense, i.e., not only execut-
ing what is possible within a certain order, but making 
possible by introducing a new kind of order. Speak-
ing with Alfred Schutz in Reflections on the Problem 
of Relevance [ 194 7-51 ], there are things that are not 
only new (neu), but of a new kind (neuartig). Foliow-
ing the investigations ofMax Wertheimer ( 1880-1943) 
in Productive Thinking ( 1945), we can suppose a sort 
of productive acting. As Cornelius Castoriadis ( 1926-
1984) shows in his book on L 'institution imaginaire 
de la societe ( 1975), radical creativity is not restricted 
to solving pregiven problems, as a certain pragmatism 
presumes, but rather consists in posing new questions. 
Just as Merleau-Ponty distinguishes between speak-
ing speech (parole parlante) and spoken speech (pa-
role par/ee), we should similarly distinguish between 
productive and reproductive, innovative and repetitive 
acting, both ranging on a certain scale whose one pole 
would be gratuitous acts, the other stereotypes. 
Creativity does not mean that everything is possible, 
it means that it is always possible to realize more than 
what is actualiy realized. With regard to the contin-
gency of variable orders that are always selective and 
exclusive, we can state with Merleau-Ponty: "There is 
(il y a) sense or rationality but not the sense or the ratio-
nality" or with MICHEL FOUCAULT "There is an order of 
things" (Les mots et les choses, 1966), both statements 
recaliing Heidegger's remark, "There is truth" (Es gibt 
Wahrheit). But pure creativity wili not do. By looking 
for what can be dane in a new way we do not find out 
what has to be dane, and we do not meet with what 
Merleau-Ponty calis verite âfaire. So we have to take 
a second step. We can attribute to action what Kurt 
Goldstein (Der Aufbau des Organismus, [The struc-
ture of the organism, 1934]) attributes to the healthy 
organism -
namely, a certain responsiveness. In do-
ing and speaking, we always respond to certain affor-
dances (Aufforderungscharaktere), as Gestalt theorists 
stress. So we should take seriously Husserl's attempt, 
which can also be found in his posthumously published 
writings on intersubjectivity, to reinterpret affectivity 
15 
as "practica! affectivity," as appeal (Am·un, concern 
(Angang), or demand (A ufruf), and finally as interpel-
lation/claim (Anspruch ), transforming ali behavior into 
"responding behavior." Here we meet with Levinas's 
philosophy ofthe Other, which breaks with ali totality. 
Radical response takes the paradoxical form of creative 
responding. While creating our response itself- i.e., 
what we respond -
we do not at ali create what or 
whom we respond to. 
Responsive acting, which moves within a certain 
order while simultaneously transgressing it, lends its 
ear to what is extraordinary, atypical, marginal, anoma-
lous. In this line phenomenology wili on the one hand 
renounce the iliusion of a first or last order, but on the 
other hand it would resist the trend of normalization 
that reduces ali actions to ordinary actions functioning 
in a certain order, whatever it may be. Ifwhat bas tobe 
done is always more than what we do, our do ing trans-
gresses every given order, stimulated by what exceeds 
our intentions without fulfiliing them.

AESTHETICS 
BERNHARD WALDENFELS 
Ruhr Universitar Bochum 
Although EDMUND HUSSERL wrote 
little that was directly concerned with problems in aes-
thetics, a great deal of his work in phenomenology 
was relevant to such issues and his work stimulated 
a great deal of attention to aesthetic problems. Rather 
than focusing on the problems of traditional aesthetics, 
such as the question of the validity of aesthetic judg-
ments (Kant), phenomenological work in acsthetics has 
more broadly attended to aesthetic experience while 
challenging many of the assumptions of traditional 
philosophical aesthetics. For example, many pheno-
menological treatments have shifted from an emphasis 
on detached contemplation to a focus on more "par-
ticipatory" relations to works of art. This is the result 
less of a competing philosophical thesis about aes-
thetics than of the progressive recovery of aisthesis, 
the explicating/articulating co-constitution of the per-
ceptual object as opposed to a merely receptive sense 
experience. 
In 1905 Husserl gave a lecture course on the pheno-
menology of IMAGINATION and the consciousness of 
images in which RE-PRESENTATION in general was the 
central theme. During the course of these lectures, he 
overcame a tendency to think of imagination as the 
consciousness of an in ner image, thus opening the way 
to an authentically intentiona! conception of imagi-
nation. His phenomenology of the consciousness of 
images sets the stage for a phenomenology of picto-
rial art. Although these lectures were not published 
until 1980, their contents were made available in EU-
GEN FINK 's dissertation, Vergegenwiirtigung und Bild 
(Re-presentation and image, 1930). 
Aesthetic issues soon attracted attention among 
Husserl 's students. WALDEMAR coN RAD applied the de-
scriptive phenomenology of Husserl 's early work to 
aesthetic objects such as MUSIC, poetry, and pictorial 
art. MORITZ GEIGER, an early member of the "Munich 
Circ le" of phenomenologists, had a long-standing in-
terest in aesthetics. His Die Bedeutung der Kunst (The 
meaning of art) remained unfinished, and only a frag-
ment of the original project appeared after his death. 
Geiger focused on the phenomenon of aesthetic en-
joyment, which he carefully distinguished from both 
pleasure and joy as well as from nonaesthetic enjoy-
ment. He was particularly interested in what he called 
the "depth effect" of works of art, i.e., the sense in 
which a work of art has a deep impact on the self. 
The Polish phenomenologist ROMAN INGARDEN stud-
ied in Gottingen and Freiburg from 1912 to 1918, and 
Husserl considered him to be a faithful "disciple," al-
though Ingarden was o ne of the most tenacious of thc 
critics of his transcendental idealism, which Ingarden 
interpreted as a metaphysical idealism. Ingarden did 
not write a general aesthetics, prefcrring to deal pri-
marily with ontologica! issues of works of art, and 
focusing on the literary work of art, along with MU-
SIC, painting and scu]pture, ARCHITECTURE, and FILM. 
He argues that works of art are neither purely real 
nor purely ideal, but have a purely intentiona! exis-
tence. The work of art has an enduring identity, but is 
not timeless. Ingarden carefully distinguishes the var-
ious strata of works of art as intentiona! objects, from 
mere sound through phonemes or musical tones, mean-
ing, the schematized aspects of represented objects, 
the "world" represented, up to what he called "meta-
physical qualities." Having distinguished these strata, 
Ingarden is in a position to give a phenomenological 
analysis ofthe viewer 's/listener's/ reader 's experiences 
ofthe work ofart, in which the various strata come to-
gether in a unity of experienced MEANING of the work. 
This experienced meaning is never absolute, and Ingar-
den insists that the indeterminacy that is found in any

particular interpretation means that the gap between 
interpretation and work can never be closed and that 
interpretation is essentially plural, although this does 
not mean that one interpretation is as good as any other. 
Ingarden 's work has had an influence on the aesthetics 
ofreception developed in the 1960s by WOLFGANG ISER 
and HANS ROBERT JAUSS. 
FRITZ KAUFMANN studied with Husserl, mainJy in 
Freiburg after World War 1, and was somewhat 
unusual among Husserl 's students of this period 
in that he accepted Husserl 's transcendental turn 
in the Ideen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913 ). At the 
same time, he was influenced by WILHELM DILTHEY's 
view of human experience as an essentially historical 
phenomenon. He came under the influence of Heideg-
ger in the early 1920s, though he later distanced him-
selffrom him. Kaufmann studied the consciousness of 
works of art as a privileged mode of access to real-
ity, one that transcends the realm of purely individual 
meaning. His final work on aesthetics remained unfin-
ished at his death. 
OSKAR BECKER studied with Husserl in Freiburg, and 
became Privatdozent there in 1922. He worked as 
Husserl 's assistant and was el o se to Heidegger. Becker 
developed Heidegger's analysis of DASEIN, developing 
the concept "Dawesen" as a framework for analyzing 
the non-historical features of Dasein, and the concept 
of"paraexistence" to supplement Heidegger's concept 
of "existence." Becker argued that beauty is "infirm" 
(hinfăllig), since it is locked in the moment, while the 
artist is "adventurous," since he or she is dependent on 
the favor ofnature. 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER was Husserl 's assistant in the 
1920s and his successor in Freiburg. Although Husserl 
thought of Heidegger as his true disciple and as 
extending phenomenology into the area of the HU-
MAN SCIENCES, Heidegger developed a HERMENEUTIC AL 
PHENOMENOLOGY of Dasein as a preliminary to rais-
ing the question of the meaning of Being. While 
Sein und Zeit ( 1927) does not focus on works of 
art, the general theory of interpretation developed 
there has been seminal for HERMENEUTICS in general 
( developed above ali by HANS-GEORG GADAMER and 
PAUL RICCEUR) and to a great deal of work more fo-
cused on art. Especially significant is Heidegger's 
articulation of the hermeneutic circle, in which the 
viewer's/reader's/listener's pre-understanding (in the 
final analysis, the pre-understanding of Being) consti-
tutes the horizon within which the specific work can 
be encountered. Ali encounters with art are interpreti ve 
and thus exhibit this structure of anticipation. 
Whether Heidegger's work contains a philosophy 
of art is a heavily debated question. In an "Addendum" 
to his famous essay, "Der Ursprung des Kunstwerkes" 
(The Origin of the Work of Art, 1935-36 ), he states 
that the essay left several issues unresolved and that in 
particular it does not answer the question as to what 
art is. ono POGGELER has interpreted this to mean that 
the essay on the artwork does not give an outline of 
Heidegger's philosophy of art. FRIEDRICH-WILHELM VON 
HERMANN and WALTER BIEMEL defend the view that Hei-
degger maintained the views in the essay on the work 
ofart until the end ofhis life and that they contain the 
core of a philosophy of art. 
Heidegger tried to overcome classical aesthetics in-
sofar as it is part ofmetaphysics. Ifaesthetics is under-
stood a la Baumgarten and Kant, then Heidegger con-
tributes nothing to it. For example, he is not concemed 
with the experiences from which artworks allegedly 
flow or with the EMOTIONS they are meant to provoke. 
But ifthe term is taken in a broader sense, so as to refer 
to ali thoughtful reflections on art and artworks, then 
he made at least three very important contributions. 
First, he is concerned with the coming-to-pass of 
truth in the work of art. The artwork is a privileged 
site at which the understanding of Being of an epoch 
is disclosed; the work has the power to gather a world 
and Being comes to unconcealment in it. His second 
great contribution is in his reflections on poetizing and 
its relationship to thinking in, for instance, Untenvegs 
zur Sprache (On the Way to Language, 1959). Finally, 
there are his elucidations of the hymns of Holderlin 
and the poetry of Rilke, Trakl, George, and others. 
The notion that the work of art gathers a WORLD 
has been taken up by subsequent phenomenologists 
and applied to works beyond those Heidegger himself 
chose as examples. His own interpretations of individ-
ual paintings and poems ha ve nevertheless engendered 
some controversy among persons trained in art history 
and criticism or in literary scholarship. For Heidegger 
and his supporters, however, his challengers are miss-
ing the essential point of his analyses, since he is not 
concerned with produc ing defensible interpretations of 

18 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
concrete works of art, but with a poetic thinking ofBe-
ing. 
With the rise of National Socialism in Germany in 
the 1930s, the cutting edge ofwork in phenomenology 
shifted to FRANCE. One ofthe most brilliant of the new 
generation ofphenomenologists, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, fol-
lowed Heidegger in giving phenomenology a strongly 
existential turn, but he did not follow Heidegger's turn 
away from consciousness. Sartre insisted on the abso-
lute freedom of consciousness, the pour-soi (for-itself), 
a function ofthe essentially negative power and tempo-
ral structure of consciousness. Thus Heidegger's focus 
on the coming-to-pass of the truth of Being, which is 
nota function ofDasein 's act ion or decisi an, is replaced 
by an emphasis on unconditioned human choice. Since 
the creati an of art is o ne response to the fact of being 
condemned to freedom, this freedom is the only proper 
theme of art. Sartre thus focused on the act of writing 
and on the politica! import of this act. Sartre's impar-
lance for general aesthetics is based on his early work 
on the IMAGINATION, and his ma in works of specifically 
aesthetic themes concern the philosophy ofLITERATURE. 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY became familiar with Ger-
man phenomenology (Husserl, MAX SCHELER, Heideg-
ger) in the 1930s. While he did not write a systematic 
aesthetics, he continually returned to the two poles of 
expressive LANGUAGE and painting, and his reftections 
are significant not only for their insights into the arts, 
but also for the way his treatment of modern painting in 
particular is interwoven with, and undergirds, his de-
velopment of a new ontology marked by a "mutation" 
in the relations ofhumankind and Being. The principal 
texts in this re gard are "Le doute de Cezanne" ( 1945), 
"Le langage indirect et les voix du silence" ( 1952), and 
"L' oei! et 1 'esprit" ( 1961 ), with related passages also to 
be found in Phenonu!!nologie de la perception ( 1945) 
and Le visib!e et l'invisible (1964). 
Merleau-Ponty's view ofthe history of art proceeds 
from Husserl's late work on HISTORY in general: acul-
tural product can function as an originary establishment 
or "institution" (Stiftung) that does not merely assume 
a prior tradition, but inaugurates a new one by open-
ing a field of possibilities whose fecundity is not at ali 
exhausted by the particular work in question. Such a 
work is "productive" in a double sense. On the one 
hand, it moves beyond what has already been seen or 
said or done and gives birth to something genuinely 
new, creating thereby a "perennial acquisition" whose 
sense can be recaptured and revived by future genera-
tions. On the other hand, however, the work that founds 
a tradition sets forth an expressive task, posing, as it 
were, a question that outruns its own answer: creative 
expression does not re-produce the responses of its pre-
decessors, but returns anew to the question posed by 
the open task itself. 
Yet despite this emphasis on the authentic genesis 
of meaning (rather than the reproduction of a cultur-
ally pre-established meaning), Merleau-Ponty rejects 
the notion of artistic expression as a pure construction 
springing from some abso 1 ute freedom on the part of an 
artist's consciousness. Rather, the painter's gesture re-
sponds to the si lent solicitation ofthe world and things, 
and it is "mute Being" that comes to show forth its own 
meaning when the artist lends his or her BODY to the 
world, answering its caii by releasing and rendering 
visible a meaning already latent within the visible it-
self. Such meaning is neither absent from the visible 
nor present in it, but "silent" or operative, so that the 
artist does not merely copy or re-produce an already 
established perceptual meaning, but brings to light, for 
example, the usually "invisible" pre-predicative means 
whereby the spectacle spontaneously organizes itself 
before our eyes prior to any active "bestowing" of 
meaning by a perceiving subject upon supposedly in-
choate "sense data." Thus a painting by Cezanne is 
not the portrait of a fixed, objective thing, but catches 
the world in the act of becoming visible, so that what 
is made visible in the work is the anonymous or pre-
personal "coming-to-itself' ofthe visible itself. 
Yet though at times Merleau-Ponty roots the 
painter's vision in a kind of primordial experience that 
is not only pre-scientific but almost "prehuman," other 
passages insist that perception is culturally shaped, that 
visibility too has its historicity, and that there are essen-
tial links between Cartesian metaphysics and Renais-
sance perspectiva! techniques. Thus though perspec-
tiva! painting claims to represent three-dimensional 
space by duplicating artificially what perception does 
"naturally," such a painting restricts o ne to a single van-
tage point over against things, dominating the spectacle 
and reducing it to a single crystallized order. The per-
ceived world itself, however, neither requires nor con-
forms to classical perspective: we are among things, 
not in front of them, and they caii upon our glance in 

AESTHETICS 
19 
turn, enfolding us in the inexhaustible reserves of a 
"wild Being," an ontologica! depth sustaining a simul-
taneity of perspectives irreducible to any presentation 
( or re-presentation) to a "consciousness" or "ego." 
Merleau-Ponty accordingly seizes upon remarks 
from painters who experience a kind of reversal of 
roles so that it is the landscape that looks at them, 
thinks itselfin them, rather than they who see and think 
it. This radicalizes the Husserlian notion ofreciprocity 
of perspectives, which gives the perceived world its 
intersubjective depth (and me my full visibility) by 
virtue of the exchangeability of standpoints: the other 
sees the si de of the thing ( or of myself) that I would 
see were I in the other's place. For Merleau-Ponty, 
however, not only am I both seer and scen, but it is 
as though the things themselves see the other side, 
thus effecting a radical decentering of"subjectivity" as 
the privileged locus of experiencing. Such reversibil-
ity not only undermines traditional dualisms between 
mind and matter, for-itself and in-itself, but explodes 
the entire paradigm of an experiencing subject fac-
ing an object over against it; the human-world relation 
is no longer frontal, perspectiva!, and marked by an 
ontologica! dichotomy. Instead, my own ftesh (chair) 
opens upon and belongs to the encompassing depth of 
the "ftesh of the world." 
Modern painting celebrates this carnal voluminos-
ity, not only by multiperspectival and aperspectival 
works, but also, for example, by allowing color to func-
tion as level or dimension rather than as an attribute of 
an object and line tobe a way of moving rather than the 
edge of a thing. For Merleau-Ponty, then, such painting 
has a "metaphysical significance": by abandon ing both 
the mcans and the goal of a classical representation of 
objects over against subjects and inscribing instead the 
genesis ofthe visible among seers who are themselves 
visible, it anticipates and ca lis for the ontology ofBeing 
as ftesh he was still seeking to articulate at his death. 
MIKEL DUFRENNE was the first French phenomen-
ologist to produce a systematic phenomenological aes-
thetics: Phenomenologie de f"experience esthetique 
( 1953). In the spirit of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, he 
understands phenomenology as the description of the 
meaning or sense (le sens) that is immanent in the sen-
suous (le sensible ), to which incarnate perception gives 
access. The aesthetic object, which is the work ofart as 
perceived, represents the "apotheosis ofthe sensuous," 
i.e., the sensuous at its most intense and poignant. In 
the presence of the aesthetic object, the appreciator or 
spectator of art is conveyed to a unique world with its 
own spatiotemporal specificity, its own atmosphere as 
revealed by its "affective qualities." These qualities, 
which serve as ingredient a priori structures, embody a 
depth and expressiveness that solicit feeling (le senti-
ment) on the part ofthe viewer or listener. Tempered by 
reftection and disciplined by understanding, this feei-
ing takes the place of the distractions of imagination, 
which is delimited rather than unleashed by the aes-
thetic. 
Dufrenne emphasizes the ro le of "performance" in 
the perception of art ~ 
not just overtly in music and 
THEATER, but in the very process of perceiving ali art, 
including painting and sculpture. Distinguishing be-
tween audience (i.e., the immediate perceivers of a 
work of art) and public (the total group of those ac-
quainted with the work ), Dufrenne 's Phenomenologie 
conceives the aesthetic object as "in-itself-for-us," thus 
as a "quasisubject" ~ i.e., it is expressive, and, like 
other humans, holds and manifests affective qualities as 
does, say, a face. This object is at once autonomous-
having its own structures, world, and truth- and het-
eronomous, being dependent for its full animation as 
sensuous on its perceivers. This resolutely phenomen-
ological theory of art gains an ontologica! dimension 
in Dufrenne's Le poetique ( 1963), in which the philos-
ophy of art is expanded into a philosophy of "Nature" 
wherein the sensuous is grounded in the "great images" 
afforded by the natural world. Politica! dimensions of 
art are explored in Art et politique ( 1974 ), and many 
other aspects of art are taken up in the three volumes 
of collected essays entitled Esthetique et philosophie 
(1967, 1976, 1981). 
Important work in the philosophy of literature has 
been done by ALFRED SCIIUTZ and MAURICE NATANSON. 
This work, rooted in the CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 
of Husserl, focuses on the manner in which literature 
can present, against the background of the world of 
daily life, an intersubjective expericnce ofthe world. 
In addition, phenomenological approaches to art-
works have been an important background, foii, and 
participant in the theoretical movements of STRUC-
TURALISM, POSTMODERNISM, and CRITIC AL THEORY. In par-
ticular, JACQUES DERRIDA 's deconstruction, which has 
been presented as the great disrupter of phenomen-

20 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ological dreams, is, according to him, a movement that 
occurs within phenomenology. 
There is a large phenomenological literature de-
voted to DANCE as well as ARCHITECTURE, FILM, LITERA-
TURE, MUSIC, PAINTING, and THEATER. The resources of 
phenomenology have thus not only contributed to aes-
thetics in general, but have proven eminently fruitful 
in elucidating works of art themselves.

ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY 
Analytic philoso-
phy is a tradition in 20th century philosophy, princi-
pally in English language philosophy. The methods and 
phiJosophy of LOGIC, MATHEMATICS, and NATURAL SCI-
ENCE figure prominently in much of the tradition, and 
exactness of thought and expression is much prized. 
For many decades the tradition focused notably on ex-
plicit analysis ofLANGUAGE and concepts~whence the 
name. Indeed, it was often said that prior philosophy 
suffered from mistakes and confusions about language 
and its logic or grammar. Originally, analytic philoso-
phers sought to do ali philosophy by logica! analy-
sis of language, but this strict methodology has not 
been retained. Phenomenology, by contrast, sought to 
do philosophy by analysis oflived human experience, 
with different schools pursuing different methods, e.g., 
EDMUND HUSSERL 's "transcendental" method of"brack-
eting" mundane existence to describe pure conscious-
ness or MARTIN HEIDEGGER's "hermeneutica!" method 
of interpreting human activity in practica!, historical 
contexts. 
Analytic philosophy always dealt with issues wider 
than language, including epistemological and ethical 
issues, but the approach was initially and most dis-
tinctively by way of analysis of language. As formal 
semantics flourished in the l970s, however, more tradi-
tional concerns of metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, 
etc., came to the fore. The relations between language 
and mind, society, and the physical world were increas-
ingly stressed, thus separating language itself from ex-
tralinguistic entities and their contributions to mean-
ing in language. Philosophy of mind, in tandem with 
philosophy of language, has assumed an increasingly 
prominent ro le in analytic philosophy, partly due to the 
rise of COGNITIVE SCIENCE. This development has made 
possible some convergence with phenomenology, es-
pecially concerning mental representation and INTEN-
TIONALITY. Notoriously, however, phenomenology and 
analytic philosophy followed divergent paths, with !it-
tie interaction, throughout the first three quarters ofthe 
century. 
The tradition of analytic philosophy, like pheno-
menology, took root in the first decade of the 20th 
century. Analytic philosophy was born in the work of 
Bertrand Russell (1872-1970), G. E. Moore (1873-
1958), and the early work of Ludwig Wittgenstein 
(1889-1951 )~in particular, in the reflections of Rus-
Lester Embree, Elizabeth A. Behnke, David Carr, J. Claude Evans, Jose Huertas-Jourda, Joseph J. Kockelmans, William R. McKenna,

sell and Wittgenstein on issues of meaning and refer-
ence raised by seminal work in logic by GOTTLOB FREGE. 
In "Uber Sinn und Bedeutung" ( 1892), Frege distin-
guished the sense and referent of an expression, argu-
ing that the terms "the morning star" and "the evening 
star" refer to the same celestial body, Venus, but do so 
by way of different senses reflecting different cognitive 
values or "ways of being given." Russell argued for a 
different model of reference, without the Fregean no-
tion of sense, in "On Denoting" ( 1905). Proper names 
such as "Bismarck" refer, but definite descriptions such 
as "the present king ofFrance" have a misleading form 
in everyday English, Russell argued. The logica! form 
of the sentence "The present king of France is bald," 
on Russell 's analysis, is that of "Someone is presently 
king ofFrance, only one person is, and he is bald." Log-
ica] analysis thus removes the temptation to say that 
the definite description refers. The young Wittgenstein 
discussed logica! issues of language with Russell and, 
in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1923), developed 
a semantic system that Russell, expounding in his own 
terms, called "logica! atomism." Wittgenstein's "pic-
ture" theory ofmeaning held that a proposition or sen-
tence represents a state of affairs ( or, if actual, a fact) 
because both have the same logica! form, the world be-
ing built up from "atomic" states of affairs by logica! 
relations such as "and." 
In the 1930s the "logica! positivists" of the Vienna 
Circle ~ including Moritz Schlick (1882-1936), 
Rudolf Carnap ( 1891-1970), and others ~ sought 
to make philosophy scientific. They stressed not only 
precise expression in formal logic, but also the strict 
grounding of ali propositions in empirica! evidence. 
The positivists' "verification principle" declared that 
a statement is meaningful only if verifiable through 
discrete empirica] observations. Carnap's LOGIC AL POS-
ITIVISM, as developed in Der logische Aufbau der Welt 
( 1928), sought to use techniques of modern logic to de-
fine language about physical objects in terms of phe-
nomenal ~ 
in effect phenomenological- language 
about sense data. Philosophy of logic, mathematics, 
and science thus maintained a central role in the con-
cerns of analytic philosophy. 
In the 1950s, however, Oxford philosophers focused 
on ORDINARY LANGUAGE ANALYSIS, as opposed to for-
ma]Janguages in logic and mathematics. Ordinary lan-
guage philosophy drew on Wittgenstein's late work in 
Philosophical!nvestigations (1953 ), focusing on par-
ticular "language games" defined in concrete situa-
tions. The meaning of a word, Wittgenstein taught, is 
given by its use. J. L. Austin ( 1911-1960) offered case-
by-case analyses of the uses of particular expressions 
of English, and his theory of "speech acts" classified 
the different kinds of"force" a sentence has in use. This 
model was developed systematically in John Searle's 
Speech Acts ( 1969). 
Gilbert Ryle ( 1900-1976) in The Concept of Mind 
(1949), following on the !ater Wittgenstein 's work, 
helped to launch analytic philosophy of mind. In a fa-
mous analysis Ryle argued that Descartes's mind-body 
dualism was the result of a "category mistake." It is a 
mistake of categories to ask, after seeing the buildings, 
lecturers, etc., where "the university" is; similarly, it is 
a category mistake to ask, after seeing the various be-
haviors of a person, where "the mind" is. Ryle defined a 
mental state such as beliefas the pure disposition tobe-
have in certain ways in certain circumstances -a view 
that has been called "logica] behaviorism." This view 
is very different from any view in the phenomenologi-
cal tradition -
though Heidegger, like Wittgenstein, 
stressed the forms of meaningful behavior that embody 
experience. 
In the spirit of Russell, W. V Quine used first-order 
quantifier logic to "regiment" everyday language, to 
specify the proper logica! form of English sentences 
such as "Jones believes someone tobe a spy." Quine's 
logica! work spread into a wider theory oflanguage and 
an empiricist epistemology. In Word and Object ( 1960) 
he defines linguistic meaning in terms ofthe empirica! 
evidence available to auditors, espousing a somewise 
behaviorist view of mind and language. Quine's be-
haviorism is not "logica!" (like Ryle's), but epistemo-
logical: our evidence for attributing meaning to spoken 
or written language, Quine holds, !ies solely in our ob-
servations of what people say in what circumstances. 
Quine's famous thesis of the "indeterminacy of trans-
lation" holds that there are in principle different ways 
of translating any language into o ne 's own tongue, on 
the basis of ali possible evidence. Consequently, the 
meaning of any piecc of language is indeterminate. 
This thesis, Quine has held, undermines the very 
significance of phenomenology, as we can attribute 
particular forms ofbelief or experience to people only 
on the basis of what we observe of their speech and 

22 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
other behavior. Indeed, Quine took FRANZ BRENTANo's 
thesis that mental phenomena are irreducibly "inten-
tiona!," or directed to objects, to show the baselessness 
ofthe "science ofintention," and by implication pheno-
menology. For the idiom of intentionality, and hence 
the language of phenomenology, cannot be accommo-
dated in the language offirst-order logic. In the Pursuit 
of Truth ( 1990), however, Quine stresses the practica! 
importance of the language of the intentiona! along-
side the language of science. Quine's separation be-
tween science and the business of everyday life reca lis 
Husserl 's analysis, in Die Krisis der europăischen Wis-
senschaften und die transzendentale Phănomenologie 
( 1936), ofthe differences between the "natural world" 
as characterized by natural science and the LIFEWORLD 
as experienced in everyday life and investigated in the 
HUMAN SCIFNCES. 
In the 1960s and 1970s analytic philosophers de-
veloped the philosophical foundations of "moda!" or 
"intensional" logic, studying logics of "necessarily," 
"believes," etc. -
precisely the "intensional" idioms 
Quine had rejected as logically and philosophically 
unworkable. Jaakko Hintikka, in Knowledge and Be-
lief ( 1962), develops a "possible worlds" semantics 
for sentences such as "Jones believes that p": this sen-
tence is true just in case "p" is true in ali cognitively 
("doxastically") possible worlds compatible with what 
Jones believes. This tautology lays out the conditions 
ofreference for terms describing not the actual world, 
but states of affairs or worlds projected by the belief 
described. This pattern of logica! or semantic anal-
ysis contains an implicit phenomenological analysis, 
unfolding in terms of "belief worlds." This structure 
ofpossible worlds resembles Husserl's analysis ofthe 
"horizon" of an act of consciousness, defined in Carte-
sianische Meditationen [ 1931] as the implicit range of 
possibilities left open by the explicit content ofthe act. 
In the 1970s and 1980s there were, at last, explicit 
areas of convergence between analytic philosophy and 
phenomenology. The convergence centered on prob-
lems of intentionality in both philosophy of language 
cum logic and philosophy of mind cum cognitive sci-
ence. 
The concept of intentionality emerged slowly in 
the analytic tradition, despite its high-profile presence 
in the phenomenological tradition for half a century 
beforehand. In the 1950s Roderick Chisholm revived 
Brentano 's notion of intentionality and sought linguis-
tic marks of intentionality. Wilfrid Sellars argued from 
Wittgensteinian/Sellarsian principles that intentional-
ity is rooted in language rather than intrinsic to mind, 
as Chisholm held with Brentano, Hussserl, and Aris-
totle. Quine then argued, as noted, against the very 
logic of the intentiona!. But in the 1960s not only 
did Hintikka develop, in effect, a logic of intention-
ality, but DAGFINN F0LLESDAL (Quine's student) recon-
structed Husserl 's own theory of intentiona! ity in a 
model parallel to Frege's theory ofreference via sense. 
An "analytic" style of phenomenology then developed 
through the 1970s in writings of Follesdal, Hintikka, 
HUBERT DREYFUS, RONALD MCINTYRE, DAVID WOODRUFF 
SMITH, J.N. MOHANTY, and others. As linguistic acts or 
expressions refer to things in the world, so acts of con-
sciousness "intend" things in the world: representation 
runs para li el in language and in thought. The works of 
phenomenologists, especially Husserl and Heidegger, 
were thus interpreted in the light of analytic philosophy 
of language and mind. 
The problem of reference or representation, with-
out the term "intentionality," was present in analytic 
philosophy from the earliest days in the logica! atom-
isms ofRussell and Wittgenstein and their background 
in Frege 's account of language as expressing thoughts 
whose constituents stand for objects in the world. How-
ever, where analytic philosophers were primarily con-
cerned with representation in language as opposed to 
mind, phenomenologists were concerned with repre-
sentation in both consciousness and language. In Lo-
gische Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901 ), Husserl explic-
itly studied the foundation of linguistic representation 
in the intentionality of conscious "acts." And in Sein 
und Zeit (1927), Heidegger saw language as a pri-
mary activity ofthe human being ( or DASEIN), arguably 
implying that language grounds intentionality even in 
thought and other modes of "comportment," such as 
perception and action. 
For the most part, analytic philosophers concerned 
with the mind did not turn explicitly to intentionality 
until the 1980s (the exceptions were Chisholm, Sell-
ars, Follesdal, etc., as noted above). In the 1970s coG-
NITIVE SCIENCE replaced behaviorism as the reigning 
paradigm for empirica! psychology, and Jerry Fodor, 
in The Language o{Thought( 1975), gave cognitive sci-
ence a notion of mental representation very much like 

ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY 
23 
Husserl 's conception of intentiona! content. Fodor even 
proposed "methodological solipsism" as the proper re-
search strategy for cognitive psychology, an exact par-
allel to (at least o ne stage of) Husserl 's phenomenologi-
cal method of epoche: "bracket" everything outside 
your own mind and describe the contents of your ex-
perience as such. However, most cognitive scientists, 
including Fodor, assumed a materialist, functionalist 
theory ofmind uncongenial to most phenomenologists. 
On the computer model of mind- the core of ARTIFI-
CIAL INTELLIGENCE- the mind is just software running 
on the hardware or "wetware" ofthe brain. 
In the 1970s and J980s HUBERT DREYFUS challenged 
the model of artificial intelligence, arguing from Hei-
deggerian phenomenology to the conclusion that com-
puters cannot do what human beings do, because they 
cannot encode the background ofhuman understanding 
and practice that alone gives meaning to human expe-
rience. In the 1980s John Searle further criticized the 
computational model of mind, on essentially Husser-
lian lines: computers run on syntactic symbols alone, 
he argues, without the intentiona! content found in real 
human experiences. In Intentionality (1983) Searle ar-
gues that intentionality is an irreducible property of 
mental states caused by and realized in the brain. His 
detailed account of intentiona! states and their con-
tents lines up with Husserl's phenomenology on most 
points ( apart from Husserl 's transcendental idealism 
and Searle's assumption of biologica! NATURALISM). 
Philosophy of mind in the analytic tradition has been 
driven by the mind-body problem- the metaphysical 
problem of how mind and body are related -
rather 
than phenomenological problems. According to Ryle's 
logica! behaviorism, a mental state such as belief is 
identica! with a pure disposition to overt bodily behav-
ior, and this is a matter of the logic or meaning of our 
talk about the mental. But are behavioral dispositions 
not grounded in brain activity, and can this ali bea mat-
ter of logic or semantics? In the 1950s and 1960s the 
identity theory- advocated by U. T. Place, J. J. Smart, 
and D. M. Armstrong- proposed that mental states 
are identica! with states ofthe brain or central nervous 
system. But what about organisms different from hu-
mans? If extraterrestrials ha ve nervous systems at ali, 
they are different from ours, yet Martians may have 
perceptions, beliefs, desires, etc. 
Accordingly, in the 1960s and 1970s functionalism 
-
explicated by Hilary Putnam, Fodor, and others-
proposed that a mental state is not a brain state per se 
but rather a function of brain states, realizable in dif-
ferent kinds of physical systems. Functionalism thus 
allows that computing machines have mental states: 
mental states are defined by algorithms that specify the 
relations of inputs to outputs for the machine, hence 
mind is just software. Functionalism differs from be-
haviorism (logica! or empirica!) because the mind is 
said to involve, beyond inputs and outputs, interna! pro-
cessing of representations or infonnation coded in an 
appropriate symbol system. These cognitive represen-
tations play the ro le of intentiona! contents, according 
to philosophers like Fodor. 
But can any of these materialist or functionalist 
theories of mind account for the phenomenological 
properties of consciousness? Among analytic philoso-
phers, Thomas Nagel, Ned Block, Searle, and Putnam 
think not. Indeed, the challenge of phenomenology has 
only gradually been recognized in the analytic tradition 
of philosophy of mind. Some three phenomenological 
properties of mental states are commonly said to resist 
reduction to either neural or functional states: inten-
tionality, sensory qualia, and consciousness. 
The functionalist assumes that intentionality is a 
functional state. In the 1980s Searle pressed his fa-
mous "Chinese room" argument to the contrary. A per-
son who does not understand Chinese could sit in a 
ro om, receiving inputs of Chinese writing and return-
ing outputs of other pieces of Chinese writing, follow-
ing purely syntactic rules for transforming one into 
the other. Though the person in the room has no un-
derstanding of Chinese (in his own mind), an externa! 
observer might think this system -
the room with 
its inputs and outputs- understood Chinese. A dig-
ital computer, Searle argues, works in just this way: 
with no interna! intentiona! states, it behaves as if it 
"perceives," "infers," "answers queries," etc. Searle's 
conclusion: syntax alone does not yield semantics, or 
real intentionality. Putnam argues in a different way to 
a similar conclusion: the same software can be realized 
in different hardware systems, but the same intentiona! 
states can be realized in different software systems. 
So, Putnam has held, we must distinguish not only the 
physical and functional levels, but also the intentiona! 
level. 
Consciousness is what makes the mind-body prob-

24 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
lem intractable, Thomas Nagel wrote in his famous 
essay "What Is It Like toBe a Bat?" (1973). Yet it 
took twenty years for the point to fully register in 
the analytic literature. Nagel urges that our "objec-
tive" account of the world in natural science does not 
include the "subjective" properties of conscious ex-
perience, notably what it is like to have an experi-
ence, as opposed to what it is, say, in neural structure. 
Block notes that the subjective properties ofsensations, 
their "raw feels" or qualia, cannot be accounted for in 
functional or indeed neural terms. Daniel Dennett, in 
Consciousness Exp/ained ( 1991 ), views consciousness 
as something of an illusion, substituting "heterophe-
nomenology" for "autophenomenology": from an ob-
jective, third-person perspective, the cognitive scientist 
describes mind/brain activity as if it were intentiona! 
-
this Dcnnett calls "the intentiona! stance"; what's 
really happening, though, is neural systems crunching 
information. Patricia Smith Churchland, in Neurophi-
losophy ( 1986), and Paul Churchland in other works 
recognize consciousness and qualia as part of neuronal 
activity, but eliminate the intentiona! states of belief, 
desire, etc., as posits of"folk psychology" that will be 
discredited as neuroscience advances. 
Searle argues to the contrary, in The Rediscove1y of 
the Mind ( 1992), that consciousness is a real part ofthe 
natural world: it is an irreducibly subjective property 
of intentiona! mental states, caused by and realized in 
brain activity, but distinct in kind from the objective, 
physical properties of the brain -just as the macro-
scopic property of liquidity is caused by and realized 
in the microscopic property of water molecules. Searle 
then sketches an account of the structure of conscious-
ness, articulating sensory modalities, intentionality, 
subjectivity, figure/ground, pleasure/unpleasure, and 
more: in short, a broad overview ofphenomenological 
structure. Searle's title might have been "The Redis-
covery of Phenomenology." But his biologica! natu-
ralism would speli a different approach to phcnomen-
ology than Husserl 's CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY Of 
Heidegger's HERMENEUTIC AL PHENOMENOLOGY. 
In the philosophy of cognitive science, Ned Block 
has distinguished three conceptions of consciousness: 
( 1) consciousness consists in the subjective or phenom-
enal quality of experience; (2) consciousness consists 
in the self-monitoring function of conscious experi-
ence; and (3) mental states are conscious insofar as 
they are accessible to conscious thought and action 
(so-called blindsight is not). In the phenomenological 
tradition, these three properties seem to go together. 
Thus Brentano and Husserl described in each con-
scious experience a specific form of inner awareness 
of the experience itself. JEAN-PAUL SARTRE called this 
structure the "pre-reflective cogito," drawing on the 
notion, as old as Leibniz, that conscious experience 
includes an "apperception" of itself. The tricky part of 
the analysis is to avoid an infinite regress of awareness 
of awareness of awareness, and to integrate this in ner 
awareness with the phenomenal quality of experience 
(in both sensory and nonsensory experience ), whereby 
the contents ofthe experience are accessible to further 
conscious activities through reflection and memory. 
Within the phenomenological tradition, Heideg-
ger's approach to phenomenology has been set against 
Husserl 's. For Heidegger, the human subject, rechris-
tened Dasein, is not an autonomous, primarily cogni-
tive, individual mental substance, but rather a being 
whose way of being is in a practica! and social world 
from which the entities it is concerned with derive their 
sense. Husserl made similar points about the embodied 
human EGO in Jdeen zu einer reinen Phănomeno/ogie 
und phănomenologischen Philosophie ll [ 1912-15], 
but he is widely misread in a traditional Cartesian 
way. In the analytic tradition, the individualist, Carte-
sian approach to intentionality has been criticized in 
two lines of argument: one by Dreyfus and Richard 
Rorty, drawing on Heidegger, and another by Putnam 
and Tyler Burge, drawing on philosophy of language. 
Rorty would eliminate the mind as a relic ofCartesian 
metaphysics, caii ing on Heidegger and Wittgenstein to 
define belief, truth, value, etc., as social-pragmatic con-
structs. Dreyfus, speaking through Heidegger, would 
eliminate the Cartesian view of the subject and with it 
the subject-object structure ofintentionality. He would 
describe more fundamental forms of intentionality in 
ACTION, PERCEPTION, etc. These are forms of human 
activity ·(resisting the term "consciousness" as overly 
Cartesian) that carry no explicit sense ofthe selfand no 
explicit cognitive representations ofwhat one is doing. 
Such "primordial" activities blend into the background 
ofbodily habit or skillful "coping" with the surround-
ing world, and so blend into aur familiar world. In this 
way, Dreyfus's Heidegger might say, phenomenologi-
cal content and worldly context blend ontologically. 

ARCHITECTURE 
25 
A similar picture is engendered by the "twin Earth" 
thought experiments designed by Putnam and extended 
by Burge. Suppose there is a distant planet that repli-
cates Earth in ali ways except that aluminum is replaced 
there by another material. When we speak or think 
ofaluminum pans, our Doppelgăngers think similarly, 
but their thoughts about "aluminum pans" are in fact 
about pans made of a different material. The conclu-
sion Burge draws is that the intentiona! content of our 
thoughts is dependent on ~ 
and individuated by ~ 
the 
actual context in which we live, and so is the mean-
ing of our language that expresses our thoughts. Hen ce 
content is not wholly "in the head" and accessible to 
phenomenological reflection. 
Husserl would presumably argue that such "exter-
nalist" theories of intentionality face the same prob-
lems as functionalism and materialism. Where are the 
phenomenological properties of intentionality, sensory 
qualia, consciousness, etc.? If these phenomena are 
eliminated, we fly in the face of experience. If we 
identify them with contextual features of conscious-
ness, we misidentify them. What varies with context, 
from Earth to twin Earth, is not intentiona! content but 
the intentiona! relation of content to abject. Thus the 
analysis of intentionality, content, and consciousness, 
even in relation to language, society, bodily skill, etc., 
requires phenomenology.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
hundred years !ater in an architectural vers ion of pos-
itivism or NATURALISM, proved to be ultimately hostile 
to questions of either a metaphysical or symbolic bent. 
The phenomenology of architecture attempts to combat 
this reductionism by effecting an artistic and techno-
logical return to the LJFEWORLD that the !ater Husserl 
had already prescribed as a philosophical antidote to 
the nihilism and scientism of late modernity. 
In general, phenomenological philosophers of ar-
chitecture explicitly reverse the modern priority of 
production over use by criticizing and rejecting the 
primacy of a formalistic methodology and the indiffer-
ence of technical instrumentalities to the phenomena 
oflived experience. Instead, they caii for a rediscovery 
of the architectural importance of the lifeworld, in-
cluding its SPACE, TIME, and HISTORY, its rich and varied 
emotional and bodily intentionalities, and its layers of 
sedimented symbolism long covered over by the func-
tionalization of modern theory and praxis. In this way 
phenomenology reinvigorates philosophical questions 
concern ing the classical Vitruvian elements of venus-
las, utilitas, and firmitas (beauty, use, and structural 
soundness) and so enables meaningful inquiry into the 
often hidden and obscure sources ofarchitectural form 
and space. Initially, this inquiry entails concrete inves-
tigations into the human BODY and its "geometry of 
experience," and eventually broadens into a full-scale 
consideration ofthe cultural, social, and natural dimen-
sions of the lifeworld as they enter into the creation 
of architectural forms and spaces. ROMAN INGARDEN, 
in particular, discusses the "unitary coherence" of the 
practica!, artistic, and cultural in authentic works of 
architecture, and roots ali three factors in the lifeworld 
and its historical character. 
The phenomenological focus on the corporeal reso-
nance of architecture can be traced to the work ofMAU-
RICE MERLEAU-PONTY- especially his Phenomenofogie 
de la perception ( 1945)- on the perceptual and em-
bodied engagement of our being-in-the-world. There 
he uncovers a pre-personal sedimentation of MEANING 
in the human body, in effect transferring the inten-
tionality of consciousness to bodily activity. This sedi-
mented meaning, so easily ignored in classical epistem-
ology, consists of pre-predicative, intentiona! threads 
that "run out" beyond the body toward its surrounding 
situation. These threads are not images or represen-
tations of a thetic consciousness, but rather permeate 
legs, arms, hands, etc., in their practica! engagement 
with the world. Work and the tasks of everyday life 
elicit bodily movements, gathering them into a unified 
expression ofspace and world. As a matrix ofhabitual 
action, the body both mediates the world as a "com-
monplaceness of established situations" and unfolds an 
"oriented space" within it that has more to do with the 
goals and concerns of praxis than with objectivity or 
exact mathematical measurement. Lived, bodily space, 
then, is disclosed as a connector between things and 
not primarily as a Newtonian container representable 
in objectifying thought. 
In this way Merleau-Ponty reopens for architectural 
thought and practice the validity of human spaces and 
thus legitimates their study and importance relative 
to the alleged "one, true objective space" of geome-
try. His prepredicative focus lays bare the constitutive 
character ofbodily experience as it brings forth a world 
built to human scale and resonant with the instinctive 
and habitual movements of the body as it performs 
its daily rounds. In identifying the thrust of good de-
sign and building with "the creation of an order reso-
nant with the body's own," the architectural historian 
and phenomenologist ALBERTO PEREZ-GOMEZ underlines 
the significance for architectural theory of Merleau-
Ponty's retrieval of the lived body and the world of 
meaning it constitutes. This is especially true for an 
understanding and appreciation of scale and propor-
tion in their capacity to evoke such varied responses as 
awe and wonder through monumental architecture or 
peace and contentment through domestic structures. 
The marginalization of the Vitruvian concern with 
beauty, use, and solidity follows inexorably from the 
modern architectural turn to formalism and the trans-
formation of both theory and praxis into Cartesian 
methodologies more focused on efficiency and cost-
effectiveness than on designing and building from a 
vision of how humans ought to live and how they 
have Jived in the past. HANS-GEORG GADAMER charac-
terizes this peculiarly modern turn as the problem of 
"aesthetic differentiation," by which he means the dis-
connection of aesthetic concerns from life-concerns. 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER's investigations into the ontologica! 
character of tool use in Sein und Zeit ( 1927) serve as 
the background and necessary support for Gadamer's 
attempts to link the functional with the beautiful at 
the hermeneuticallevel oftruth and Being. In the same 

ARCHITECTURE 
27 
vein as Gadamer's, the Yale philosopherofart KARSTEN 
HARRIES questions the evolution of an "arbitrary archi-
tecture" that is at best eclectic and theatrical, resulting 
in the appearance ofthe "decorated shed." Without an 
architectural thinking and practice that is rooted in the 
lifeworld, building and design fali prey to aestheticism 
or technicism, neither ofwhich can avoid an arbitrari-
ness ultimately lacking in seriousness and conviction, 
as is evident, for example, in the so-called historicism 
of POSTMODERN architecture. 
Ingarden too bemoans aestheticism as arbitrary, 
though, writing in 1928, he comes close to endors-
ing the structural technicism inherent in modernism 
and the emerging International style of Le Corbus-
ier (Charles Edouard Jeanneret, 1887-1965), Walter 
Gropius (1883-1969),and Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe 
(1886-1969).1t is phenomenologists like Gadamerand 
Harries who clearly dispute the modernist functional-
ization of architecture ("form follows function") by 
raising questions concerning beauty and use, their re-
lation to one another, and, most importantly, the TRUTH 
they convey through form and space. The phenomen-
ology of architecture thus represents a return to the 
classical notion of techne as a form of episteme or 
knowing that is alive to the perennial questions ofhu-
man existence and the place of that existence in the 
cosmos. Because an integration of venustas, utilitas, 
and firmitas is possible only within a larger architec-
tural vision of the world, phenomenology urges new 
and fresh investigations into the phenomena of place, 
landscape, region, and world. Only here, in the light 
of these transcendental horizons that bestow meaning 
and importance on ali human activities, can the inten-
tionalities ofbuilding and dwelling be worked through 
and brought to clarity. 
Phenomenological investigations into lived time 
and space are employed as a necessary groundwork 
and starting place for a philosophy of architecture that 
rejects the modernist emphasis on ahistorical methods 
and building practices in fa vor of an architecture that is 
rooted in a recognizable and influential tradition. His-
tory replaces technique as the repository of forms and 
spaces that can once again speak to the life-concerns of 
humanity. What phenomenology finds in architectural 
history are contextualized, and yet essential, structures 
whose symbolic and ontologica! power can on acea-
sion rise to the status of world-making. In its spatial 
and temporal dimensions, world is an "openness" or 
clearing within which humans dwell. 
Dwelling is traditionally expressed as the ethos of a 
people, that animating vision of existence that guides 
daily activity from the most mundane to the most ex-
alted. Since architecture is both the backdrop and the 
stage for the drama of this existence, its primary task 
is to express and comment upon the informing ethos 
that supports and lends significance to the drama, to 
"fasten" us, as MIKEL DUFRENNE puts it, to the world and 
its natural environs. The ethical function of ali archi-
tecture is thus to build in such a way that the building is 
also a dwelling, that is, an outgrowth and continuation 
ofthe dwelling it is attempting to express through form 
and space. Building is not only contextual, as Ingarden 
and Dufrenne correctly point out, but, as a "joining" of 
spaces, it is also an unfolding of places and, at times, 
even worlds. These spaces, moreover, exist for archi-
tecture in history, so that the architect must also engage 
in time- as well as space-making in order to reach out 
to historical communities past, present, and future. 
But in spite of the contextual nature of ali archi-
tecture and its situatedness within horizons that are 
historical and regional in character, most phenomen-
ological inquiries into building and dwelling funda-
mentally rely on an EIDETIC APPROACH and seek to un-
cover essential structures such as "natural symbols" 
(Harries), "archetypes" (Thomas Thiis-Evensen), and 
"pattern languages" (Christopher Alexander) embed-
ded in but not limited to the historical and regional. 
Such studies plumb, for example, the lived meaning 
of up-down and vertical-horizontal, or the transcul-
tural occurrence of the cross and the pyramid. These 
architectural symbols and languages are therefore con-
strued to be more than merely aestheti"c or intellec-
tual phenomena, and yet they are not reduced to the 
simply useful or practica!. Rather, originary architec-
tural structures convey specific modes of dwelling and 
correlative types of building that help to make such 
dwelling possible. Such symbols or languages create 
a sense of place that is historically and geographically 
bounded while at the same time infused with a sense 
of the timeless and the boundless. 
Prior to modernity, architecture looked to MATHE-
MATICS and, in particular, to number as a source of 
symbolism and meaning. The cosmologica! resonance 
ofthe mathematical served as a transcendental seedbed 

28 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
out of which form and space seemed almost to grow 
organically. But with the modern scientific demythol-
ogization of number and geometry, architecture had 
to look to new sources for instruction and inspiration. 
Phenomenology offers the lifeworld as such a source, 
and believes that even though severed from its tradi-
tional origins, architecture can root itself again in this 
new seedbed and avoid becoming a prosaic TECHNOL-
OGY or an increasingly irrelevant decorative art. The 
revival ofarchitecture in this sense is nothing less than 
a reinstitution of its ethical task to express and rein-
force the ethos of a people in ali its social, natural, and 
sacred dimensions. 
In the end, a meaningful architecture will engage 
in the creation of public spaces wherein humans might 
pursue a common destiny arising out of shared be-
liefs and thus a common heritage. Harries characterizes 
this creation as architecture's function in EDUCATION, 
namely, its obligation to sustain and, in part, to shape 
the moral, politica!, and religious ideals of a people. 
Significant phenomenological spadework in this area 
is tobe found in the thought of HANNAH ARENDT, who 
reorients architectural theory in the direction of space 
rather than form through her identification of a "space 
ofappearances" as the public sphere of politica! praxis. 
Such a space makes possible the appearance and recog-
nition of plurality as the authentic condition of any 
meaningful POLITICS. The self-effacing character of ar-
chitecture becomes most apparent in this sphere as it 
opens up spaces and distances within which differences 
can coexist and even flourish. 
The architectural clearing of spaces finds its 
phenomenological roots in Heidegger's HERMENEUTI-
CAL PHENOMENOLOGY of Being. As earJy as Sein und 
Zeit ( 1927), his language draws heavily upon architec-
tural images and metaphors. Concern for "building" 
and "dwelling" is obvious in his use of such terms 
as "clearing," "house of Being," "work," "enframing," 
"joining," and "destruction" (!ater to become "decon-
struction" in the hands of .IACQUES DERRIDA). This con-
cern is essentially linguistic, since for Heidegger ar-
chitecture, like other phenomena, is a "text" or LAN-
GUAGE expressive of Being and of DASEIN's relation to 
Being. (Dufrenne likewise speaks of an architectural 
language that "sings" and so expresses itself and the 
world to which it belongs.) The concepts of building 
and dwelling clarify Dasein's relation to Being as one 
of rootedness in place. To "dwell" is not so much to 
occupy a house or a lodging as it is to open up and 
endure in spaces that are joined together by means of 
things. Building is grounded in dwelling and emerges 
from a lifeworld that has opened itself to the "four-
fold," a word that is meant to express Dasein 's life on 
earth and under the sky, at once in touch with divinities 
and yet bound to human community. 
Architectural building brings forth such things as 
bridges and temples in order to clear a space for the 
appearance of the fourfold and thus to preserve and 
nurture what originally locates us on earth and gathers 
our world into a place fit for human dwelling. Such a 
gathering institutes a place or site out of which spaces 
are cleared for the human encounter with the fourfold. 
Heideggerian space is therefore grounded in place-
in explicit opposition to the Cartesian primacy of an 
abstract space that obliterates local difference in favor 
of the uniform grid- while place itself is grounded 
in those artifacts by means of which a world emerges 
and settles upon the earth. 
Heideggerian building is a preparation for the ap-
pearance of the fourfold; it secures an "open place" 
where such an event can transpire. Such preparation 
!ies outside any a priori methodology or technique 
used to predetermine architectural spaces or artifacts. 
Instead, to build, for Heidegger, is to be on the way to 
dwelling, to Jet dwelling- and not a strict formalism 
-determine the forms and places that building brings 
forth. Architectural building proceeds by the "joining" 
of spaces at specific sites in accordance with the ar-
chitectural possibilities inherent in those sites. These 
spaces are rooted in the cleared site as site and in no 
way exist prior to the establishment of the places in 
which they are joined (as, for example, they would for 
Newton). 
The connection between building and dwelling be-
comes so intimate for Heidegger that he is willing in 
the end to collapse building into dwelling. Building, 
in other words, is not to be confused with making or 
producing, but is rather a special kind of dwelling. 
This dwelling roots Dasein in things and allows the 
fourfold to emerge and to "install" itself in Oase in 's 
pwximity, indeed opening up a vicinity in which prox-
imity as well as distance first makes its appearance. 
Building as dwelling makes architecture possible by 
opening up to the architect the precincts "suitable" for

his or her designs. Heidegger's ontologica! understand-
ing of architecture also runs para li el to his conception 
of modern technology and thus situates building as an 
ontologica! event concealed within architecture,just as 
poiesis hides itself in the Gestell or enframing essence 
of modern techne. Unlike engineering, or for that mat-
ter any type of construction or making, building is a 
"poetic taking of measure" used to guide architectural 
planning, designing, and construction. 
Whether a non-anthropological measure is granted 
to builders and architects today remains obscure in 
Heidegger's thinking. What is clear, though, is the in-
fluence his thought and poetic language, construed as 
a preparation for the arrival of such a measure, has 
had on contemporary architects and philosophers of 
architecture. One thinks ofGadamer, Harries, and Der-
rida in this regard, as well as architect-philosophers 
such as Perez-Gomez, CHRISTIAN NORBERG-SCHULZ, and 
Thiis-Evensen. While their work draws upon Hei-
deggerian themes and motifs, it can be broadly situ-
ated within phenomenology and traditional phenomen-
ological concerns, primarily lifeworld, embodiment, 
and historicity. Through its emphasis upon humane and 
humanizing norms and standards, the phenomenology 
of architecture ~ 
though a minority view within con-
temporary architectural theory ~ 
has become an area 
where phenomenology continues to exert an influence 
and to gain ground against current positivist ideas and 
methodologies, not to mention the abstract formalism 
that has guided modern architecture for the last two 
hundred years.

Arendt is o ne of the most 
seminal politica! theorists ofthe 20th century. EXISTEN-
TIAL PHENOMENOLOGY is integral both to her method-
oJogy and to her politica! theory. She provides a rich 
description ofthe fundamental phenomena that distin-
guish politics as the human activity par exce/lence. 
Arendt was born into a Jewish family in Konigsberg, 
East Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia), in October 
1906. She studied with MARTIN HEIDEGGER at Marburg 
and KARL JASPERS at Heidelberg. Under Jaspers' tute-
lage she completed her doctoral dissertation on Der 
Liebesbegnff bei Augustin (St. Augustine's concept of

love, 1929). Unfortunately, the rise ofNazism made her 
a refugee for the next decade. In 1933 she fled Berlin for 
Paris, where she worked for a Jewish refugee agency; 
with the establishment of the Vichy regime she fled 
to America in 1 94 1. During World War Il, she wrote 
articles primarily on Jewish affairs. 
Following the war, she emerged as a rising figure 
within POLITIC AL PHILOSOPHY with the publication ofThe 
Origins of Totalitarianism ( 195 1) -
a staple text on 
this topic sti li today. Her masterpiece remains The Hu-
man Condition ( 1958), where she distinguishes politics 
as rooted in open-ended, intersubjective human ACTJON 
from contemplation, scientific cognition, technological 
artifice, and especially the metabolism of labor. 
Over the next decade, her texts give very original de-
scriptions ofkey politica] phenomena in a manner dis-
tinct from metaphysical and behaviorist approaches. In 
Bet1veen Past and Fu ture ( 1961) she readdresses topics 
such as history, authority, freedom, and culture to sal-
vage their meaning, given what she termed the break-
down ofWestern politica! philosophy after Hegel. Her 
characterization of Adolf Eichmann in Eichmann in 
Jerusalem ( 1963) as manifesting the "banality of evi!" 
engendered enormous controversy, especially within 
Jewish intellectual circ les. Two years !ater, in On Rev-
olution ( 1965), she distinguishes the American from 
the French Revolution in that the former was based on 
politica!, not social ends. 
Two subsequent anthologies- Men in Dark Times 
( 1968) and Crises of the Republic ( 1972)- bring to-
gether articles and essays from the mid-1950s to the 
early 1970s. The former portrays 20th century histor-
ical and intellectual figures who exemplified humani-
tas-mos! notably Karl Jaspers. The latter addresses the 
calculative mindset of United States foreign policy-
making during the Vietnam War, protest movements as 
a revitalization of the American tradition of voluntary 
associations, and misleading scientific explanations of 
violence. Her final years were devoted to her 1973/74 
Gifford Lectures on thinking, willing, and judging. A 
heart attack during the 1974 "Willing" lectures forced 
an indefinite postponement ofthe series. She died from 
a subsequent heart attack on December4, 1975, leaving 
behind in her typewriter the first page of what was to 
be "Judging." These lectures have been posthumously 
published in The Life of the Mind ( 1978) and Lectures 
on Kant :S Politica! Philosophy ( 1982). 
Arendt's politica! theory focuses upon politics as 
an activity that must be understood in its own terms in 
contrast to the standpoints ofmetaphysical or scientific 
approaches. She pursues an existential phenomenology 
of politica! experiences. First and foremost, Arendt 
focuses on the human condition -
who we are -
as opposed to human nature -
what we are. Only a 
God, she argues, could possibly define the latter. By thc 
same token, she emphasizes that there is a qualitativc 
difference between the human and natural spheres of 
life. Given that the conditions of human experience 
do not condition us absolutely, we must focus upon the 
relational character ofhuman interaction to understand 
the politica!. Unlike the study ofnature, human beings 
cannot be sheer spectators to their own activities. 
Second, focusing on politica! "matters themselves" 
for Arendt means stressing concrete particulars, not 
universals. In this regard she follows existential pheno-
menology's insistence that the conceptual is based on 
the pre-conceptual. For instance, she insists that the 
risc of totalitarian domination in this century be un-
derstood in terms of specific facts and events, not as 
a consequence of sweeping historical influences, such 
as the claim ofEric Voegelin (190 1-1985) that the ori-
gins of totalitarianism can be traced back to medieval 
Gnosticism. 
Third, human reality to Arendt is characterized by 
contingency. One of the reasons she studies totalitar-
ianism is because she claims that it is a new politica! 
system. Her portraits of ( 1) thinking as a relentless 
questioning akin to Karl Jaspers' Existenz and Kant's 
pure reason and (2) willing as connected to the ability 
to initiale spontaneous new beginnings -
action -
also accent contingency in human affairs. 
Arendt's stress on particulars and contingency is 
integral to her critique of metaphysical approaches to 
politics. As much as reality confronts us with the un-
expected, reason is averse to contingency -
hence 
the unwillingness of philosophers to wrestle with thc 
radical open-ended quality ofhuman willing and frec-
dom. Instead, philosophers, she claims, spin metaphys-
ical systems, especially philosophies of History such 
as Hegel 's, to counter such uncertainty. By contrast, 
Arendt focuses on human histories -
the stories of 
particular individuals and deeds. In an inductive fash-
ion, great deeds or events manifest exemplary validity: 
as opposed to overarching philosophical systems, they 

HANNAH ARENDT 
31 
caii attention to the significance of politica! phenom-
ena. 
Scientific approaches to politics likewise try to pro-
vide certainty and in turn predictability to human af-
fairs, according to Arendt. In this case, as opposed 
to thinking's capacity to explore and dwell upon the 
meaning of human events, behaviorism seeks to re-
duce human actions and events to a cognitive, cause-
and-effect framework. For instance, she notes the in-
tellectual eagerness to explain violence in biologica! 
terms, instead of understanding it as a legitimate but 
destructive human answer to the frustration of genuine 
politica! interaction in contemporary times. 
Like other existential phenomenologists, Arendt ar-
gues that scientific methods appropriate to the explo-
ration of nature are incapable of dealing with the hu-
man purposiveness that !ies at the heart of politics. 
In addition, she stresses that positivist approaches be-
come particularly dangerous when they serve as the 
only methodology for public policy. For instance, in 
the case ofthe Vietnam War, she argues that the United 
States government's policy was based upon calculati ve 
models by Washington think tanks, rather than judg-
ments based upon cultural and historical facts: this en-
deavor to remodel reality for the American public only 
led to self-deception on the part of the policymakers 
themselves. 
Fourth and finally, Arendt shares existential pheno-
menology's stress on the primacy ofthe LJFEWORLD, es-
pecially its ineradicable ambiguity. Models or schemes 
that package human events as being automatic, uni-
versal, or simply as ready for application- such as 
the modern stress on progress or neatly tailored polit-
ica! ideologies -
end up petrifying the rich and ever 
changing variety of politica! experiences rather than 
capturing the intersubjective basis of MEANING. She re-
mains a steadfast critic of any absolutizing of human 
experience, especially on the basis of an imposed order 
or truth. 
Arendt's students comment upon how she would 
draw their attention by persistently putting old texts in 
a new light. This same inclination is found throughout 
her work-such as her worldly rendering of Augustine's 
politica! theory, her contention that Jefferson advocated 
the pursuit of public over private happiness, and her fre-
quent use of litera ture to exemplify themes. But this is 
not arbitrary or capricious interpretation: it is drawn to 
the manifold character of the lifeworld. By extension, 
she shares Heidegger's distinction between matters of 
thought vs. matters of scholarship: the former rather 
than the latter focuses upon the fundamental questions 
that human beings mutually share. Consequently, for 
Arendt, politica) theory is an activity that never has a 
complete resolution. 
Based upon her emphasis on particularity, contin-
gency, and ambiguity as integral facets of the "life-
world," Arendt undertakes to provide phenomenologi-
cal descriptions of phenomena that are integral to hu-
man beings as "politica! animals": labor, work, action, 
authority, power, violence, politica! vs. social revolu-
tion, freedom, culture, civil disobedience vs. consci-
entious objection, history, truth vs. meaning, thinking, 
willing, judging, and moral responsibility. 
Arendt's disclosure of politics as being essential 
to the human condition distinguishes her from po-
litica! theorists who ground politics upon a human 
nature, based either on metaphysics -
be it Pla-
tonic or Hegelian in origin -
or scientific causality. 
Within American POLITICAL SCIENCE since World War 
II, Arendt represents a vital alternative to both Straus-
sian and behavioral methodologies; her existential-
phenomenological orientation enables her to bridge 
the former's concern with values and meaning with 
the latter's preoccupation with the empirica) realm. 
Arendt's politica! theory, as a reftection upon the 
situatedness of human beings in the lifeworld, stands 
in between theories that either deify the individual as 
in ( 1) Lockean individualism or (2) solipsistic types 
of existentialism, or extirpate the individual as in ( 1) 
behavioral approaches that render politics as the out-
come of environmental structures or (2) communitarian 
schemes that strive for homogeneity. Her alternative to 
the opposition of the individual and the collective in 
the HUMAN SCIENCES centers upon her articulations of 
plurality, equality, and natality. 
By plurality Arendt means that human beings rather 
than Humankind are the basis for the world of politics. 
Action, the key category of what she terms the vita 
activa, wouid be pointless if we were utterly alike; 
then o ne could just rely on predictable behavioral ten-
dencies. Plurality's focus on personal distinctiveness 
captures the fact that action ensues among "others." 
By equality, Arendt means that despite our differences, 
we ali share in the capacity for mutual communication. 

32 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
In politics, as exemplified by the pre-philosophical 
Greek po!is, citizens engage in nonsovereign relation-
ships with each other, regardless of the station of life 
from which they come. If plurality signifies personal 
uniqueness, equality enables community. By natality, 
Arendt means that just as each human birth inaugu-
rates a new beginning in the world, human beings can 
initiate new actions. Consequently, in contrast to de-
terminism, spontaneity is intrinsic to politics; humans 
can alter the associations and structures that condition 
their lives, and are responsible for the consequences of 
these initiatives. 
Personal freedom and distinctiveness, then. is real-
ized in speeches and deeds in the company of other 
people. As opposed to politica! theories that stress the 
pursuit of private interests, interaction between plural, 
natal human beings reveals for Arendt the "inter-est" 
-
the public space- that both binds us together and 
distinguishes us one from another. This "web ofhuman 
relations" renders politics as a mutual, intersubjective 
activity instead ofbeing a conflict between disembod-
ied, isolated egos. 
Arendt shifts our attention from strategic or instru-
mental concerns to the performative dimension ofpol-
itics. Just as performing artists need an audience, hu-
man beings need a public space in which to act- to 
manifest their virtuosity before others. In turn, politica! 
power is nota possession tobe superimposed over oth-
ers, but a consensus that is established through lateral, 
not hierarchical relationships. In institutional terms, 
Arendt puts forth the council system whereby politics 
is centered in participatory neighborhood associations 
-
what de Tocqueville stressed as the American tra-
dition of voluntary associations. Besides the ancient 
Greek polis, Arendt also looks to the Romans, who 
understood the need to establish a space in which hu-
man initiatives could happen. Although Arendt does 
not employ the term, she articulates politics as praxis. 
The human condition of plurality, equality, and natality 
means that each human being can not only initiate new 
beginnings, but is also responsible for these actions 
performed before others. 
Opposed to Arendt's outlook is what she terms mod-
els of domination or sovereignty. Plato 's politica! the-
ory, she contends, engenders an "instrumentalization" 
of action. Instead of citizens mutually interacting as 
equals in the public realm, the philosopher-king rules 
over others based upon the blueprint of the ideal state 
just as reason commands in the Platonic soul. This 
fixation is further compounded when the Christian dis-
covery ofthe will reduces human freedom to being an 
inner conflict of choices: the sovereign self replaces 
the person disclosed in actions and deeds. Rousseau's 
general will, to Arendt, simply magnifies this focus on 
willpower into an inalienable, indivisible sovereignty 
that will not allow factions or even communication 
between citizens, but will force them to be free. 
As much as contemporary liberal democracy is re-
moved from Plato or even Rousseau, Arendt's point 
is that the legacies of politics as sovereignty persist. 
Freedom is understood to be the pursuit of private in-
terests protected from government interference- be-
ing a consumer is more significant than being a citizen. 
When government does formulate and enact so-called 
public policy, it does so based on positivist forecasting 
techniques, such as in her aforementioned discussion 
of Vietnam. In general terms, Arendt bemoans the as-
cendency of biologica! and technological determinism 
in the contemporary world. Politics as sovereignty has 
led logically to the rise of bureaucracy -
what she 
characterizes as "rule by Nobody" in which the norms 
and rules that are "operative" are completely disem-
bodied from human purposiveness. Finally, the rise of 
a mass society of individuals without an "inter-est" to 
bind them proved to be fertile ground for Nazi and 
Soviet totalitarianism. 
In particular, Arendt's examination of Adolf Eich-
mann brings an ethical focus steeped in phenomen-
ology to her critique of mass society. At his tria! in 
Jerusalem, she was struck by how Eichmann 's testi-
mony was oblivious to the monstrous deeds he had 
overseen in the Nazi concentration camps. His utter 
lack of any sense of responsibility for his actions-
the "banality of evi!"- thus strikes at the heart of an 
intersubjective politics, for it abrogates the centrality 
of personal responsibility to others. 
If she is critica! of those who refuse to think, like 
Eichmann, she is equally leery ofthose who would su-
perimpose moralities or truths without subjecting them 
to public discourse. Be it her preference for the public 
solidarity of civil disobedients over the solitary moral-
ities of conscientious objectors or her elucidation of 
how the faculty of taste, borrowing from Kant's Kri-
tik der Urteilskraft, engenders a sensus communis that 

HANNAH ARENDT 
33 
enables citizens to judge what qualities should appear 
in the world, she insists that thc meaning of politica! 
activities is realized between, not apart from, human 
beings. 
Given its intersubjective renderings of politica! 
foundation, deliberation, freedom, and moral respon-
sibility, Arendt's politica! theory is situated between 
individualism and communitarianism, idealism and re-
alism, and moral absolutism and relativism. Overall, 
she stresses that the pursuit of public, not private hap-
piness, is the basis for human freedom. 
The indebtedness of Arendt's politica! theory to her 
mentors, Heidegger and Jaspers, is a complicated mat-
ter, both due to her romantic liaison with Heidegger 
and due to the larger conflict between him and Jaspers. 
Arendt rejects Heidegger's philosophy in "What is Ex-
istenz Philosophy?" (1946). She claims that Heideg-
ger's notion of DASEIN in Sein und Zeit ( 1927) is an on-
tologica! un ion of the isolated Self with nothingness, 
cut off from the shared humanity of human beings. 
As an alternative, she dwells upon Jaspers' concept of 
communication because it stresses the shared human-
ity ofpossible Existen:: in which human beings realize 
freedom. 
Yet two decades !ater in "Martin Heidegger at 
Eighty" ( 1969), she is much more sympathetic to Hei-
degger, especially to how his notion ofthinking moves 
beyond metaphysics and gives fresh meaning to fun-
damental philosophical issues. She adopts the open-
ended, deliberative, noncognitive qualities of his ar-
ticulation of thinking for her rendering of this faculty 
in The Life of the Mind. Moreover, Arendt's protests 
notwithstanding, ( 1) his notion of Dasein resonates in 
her conception ofaction, (2) their critiques ofTECHNOL-
OGY are akin, and (3) they both stress an indeterminate 
ontology as the basis for human freedom. 
Still, Jaspers' notion of Existenz remains closer to 
the core of Arendt's politica! theory. Existenz is a tran-
scendent freedom that defies absolute notions oftruth: 
we are free precisely because we do not know the ulti-
mate order ofthings. This notion is implicit in Arendt's 
articulation of plurality and natality and is the basis 
for her rejection of models of truth -
be they meta-
physical, scientific, or otherwise- superimposed on 
the worldliness of politics. In turn, her focus on the 
diminution of politics in a mass society is linked to 
Jaspers. 
By the same token, Arendt's politica! theory shares 
in the drawbacks of Jaspers' Existenz philosophy. Hei-
degger is quite critica! of Jaspers' claim that there 
cannot be any conceptual truth or knowledge because 
that would limit human Existenz. Contrary to Jaspers, 
one cannot move beyond metaphysics by rejecting the 
question of Being in the name offostering the freedom 
ofhuman beings. Yet that is precisely what Arendt tries 
to do by focusingjust on how "who" we are is disclosed 
in the company of others, not on how this disclosure 
also relates to Being. She compounds matters further 
when in The Life of the Mind she articulates a very 
speculative but disembodied thinking ego. 
These drawbacks could be overcome by sceing MAU-
RICE MERLEAU-PONTY's work as a bridge betwcen Arendt 
and Heidegger. He certainly shares Arendt's focus on 
the contingency and ambiguity of the human condi-
tion, and Arendt would be well served by his account 
ofthe BODY. His !ater works, in turn, raise many ofthe 
same ontologica! questions that preoccupy Heidegger: 
yet unlike Heidegger and like Arendt, Merleau-Ponty 
cogently addresses the complexity ofpolitics through-
out his work. Within politica! theory, the notion of a 
participatory ontology mutually rai sed by Arendt, Hei-
degger, and Merleau-Ponty is being further developed 
in the work of FRED DALLMAYR and IIWA YOL JUNG.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
In the early 
1950s, as calculating machines were coming into their 
own, a few pioneer thinkers began to realize that digital 
computers could be more than "number crunchers." 
At that point two opposed visions of what computers 
could be, each with its correlated research program. 
emerged and struggled for recognition. One faction 
saw computers as a system for manipulating mental 
symbols; the other, as a medium for mode ling the brain. 
One school was the heir to the rationalist tradition in 
philosophy; the other viewed itselfas idealized holistic 
neuroscience. 
By 1955, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon had re-
alized that the strings of bits manipulated by a digi-
tal computer could stand for anything- numbers, of 
course, but also features of the real world. Moreover, 
programs could be used as rules to represent relations 
between these symbols, so that the system could infer 
further facts about the represented objects and their re-
lations. This way of looking at computers became the 
basis of a way of looking at minds. Newell and Si-
mon hypothesized that the human brain and the digital 
computer, while totally different in structure and mech-
anism, had, ata certain level of abstraction, a common 
functional description. At this level both the human 
brain and the appropriately programmed digital com-
puter could be seen as two different instantiations of a 
single species of device- a device that generated in-
telligent behavior by manipulating symbols by means 
of formal rules. The rallying cry of the first group of 
researchers became that both minds and digital com-
puters were physical symbol systems. 
EDMUND HUSSERL 's work on INTENTJONALITY, espe-
cially in Ideen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913), Cartesian-
ische Meditationen [ 1931 ], and Die Krisis der eu-
ropăischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale 
Phănomenologie ( 1936), anticipates attempts to pro-
duce artificial intelligence (Al) by using the computer 
as a physical symbol system. It follows that MARTJN 
HEIDEGGER 's criticism in Sein und Zeit (1927) and 
Die Grundprobleme der Phanomenologie ( 1927) of 
Husserl 's account of intentionality can be read as an 
early critique ofthat research program. 
In Ideen J Husserl argued that an act of conscious-
ness or noesis does not, on its own, grasp an object; 
rather, the act has intentionality (directedness) only by 
virtue of an "abstract form" or MEANJNG in the NOEMA 
correlated with the act. In Cartesianische Meditatio-
nen and Er(ahrung und Urteil ( 1939) he explained how 
the noema performed its complex task. Since Husserl 
rightly thought of inte1ligent behavior as a context-
determined, goal-directed activity, the noema of any 
type of object had to provide a context or horizon of 
expectations for structuring the incoming data: "a rule

governing possihle other consciousness of the object 
as identica] -
possible, as exemplifying essentially 
predelineated types." That is, the noenw must contain 
a "strict rule" describing all the features that can bc 
expected with certainty in exploring a certain type of 
object -
features that remain "inviolably the same: 
as long as the objectivity remains intended as this one 
and of this kind." Moreover, in order to prescribe the 
spectrum ofremaining open possibilities offeatures of 
this type of abject, the noema must contain "a frame 
of empty sense" rcpresenting our "typified world." 
In 1973 Marvin Minsky at the AI Laboratory at 
the Massachussets Institute ofTechnology proposed a 
datastructure for representing everyday knowledge re-
markably similar to Husserl's. In "A Framework for 
Representing Knowledge" he described a .frame as a 
data-structure for representing a stereotyped situation, 
like being in a certain kind of living room, or going 
to a child's birthday party. He suggested that the top 
levels of a frame should be fixed, and represent things 
that are always true about the supposed situation, while 
the lower levels should have many terminals-siots that 
must be filled by specific instances or data. The "pheno-
menological powcr" of the theory, he said, hinged on 
the inclusion of expectations and other kinds of pre-
sumptions. 
In Minsky's model of a frame, the "top level" is a 
developed version ofwhat in Husserl 's terminology re-
mains inviolably the same in the nocma, and Husserl's 
typified predelineations have become "default assign-
ments"- additional features that can normally be ex-
pected. The result is a step forward in AI techniques 
from a passive model of in formation processing to o ne 
that tries to take account of the interactions between a 
knower and the world. The task of Al thus converges 
with the task of CONSTITUTIVE PIIENOMENOLOGY. Both 
must try to spell out in detail the frames that repre-
sent prototypical objects and situations, i.e., they must 
show how such frames or noemata can be constructed 
from a set of primitive predicates (Husserl called them 
predicate senses) and their rule-like relations. 
But there is also an important difference between 
the two research programs. The current philosophical 
basis ofthe AI research program is Jerry Fodor's com-
putational model of the mind. Fodor argues that the 
symbols in which the world is represented in the mind 
must beformal symbols. Thus Husserl and Fodor ex-
plain the intentionality of symbols in diametrically op-
posed ways. Fodor's brand of cognitivism is precisely 
designed to show how mental "symbols" can do their 
work on the basis oftheir shape alone without function-
ing as symbols, i.e., independcntly oftheir semantic or 
representational properties. When it comes to identify-
ing, classifying, unifying, synthetizing, and in general 
manipulating mental contents, Husserl holds the dia-
metrically opposed position, rcjecting formal shapes in 
fa vor of noematic meanings. 
Still, in Jdeen !, after discussing the difficulties in-
volved in developing a formal axiomatic system to 
describe everyday experience, Husserl leaves open 
the question of whether our everyday concepts could 
nonetheless be formalized, whether as a counterpart to 
descriptive phenomenology one might develop "an ide-
alizing method which substitutes pure and strict ideals 
for intuited data" and could "even serve as the funda-
mental means for a mathesis of mental processes." 
Husserl did not raise the question ofwhether a for-
mal model of experience could contain a formal ana-
logue of intentionality; he did not foreclose the pos-
sibility either. Indeed, while for Husserl a descriptive 
account of mental life cannot ignore semantics, a for-
mal model of experience that substitutes syntax for se-
mantics might nonetheless be possible. Thus although 
Husserl implicitly rejects the claim that intentional-
ity is just formal manipulation (perhaps plus physical 
causality), he leaves open the possibility of a compu-
tational cognitive psychology. 
Heidegger was critica! of Husserl 's claim that all 
intentiona! activity had to be based on the intentiona] 
content of subjects. In Sein und Zeit he pointed out 
that there are ways of"encountering" things other than 
relating to them as subjects directed toward objects. 
When we use a piece of equipment like a hammer, Hei-
degger points out, we actualize a ski il (which need not 
be represented in the mind) in the context of a socially 
organized nexus of equipment, purposes, and human 
ro les (which is nota set of objects and formalizable re-
lations ). Rejecting Husserl 's view, Heidegger says that 
equipmental relations "resist any sort of mathemati-
cal functionalization; nor are they merely something 
thought, first posited in an 'act ofthinking'." For Hei-
degger, they are rather relations in which concernful 
coping "already dwells." 
In Sein und Zeit Heidegger adds a more specific and 

36 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
prescient objection to AI. He finds a general problem 
rai sed by cognitivism 's attempt to explain our relation 
to the world in terms of mental representations. Heideg-
ger's argument is found in his critique of Descartes's 
attempt to explain the world in terms ofphysical prim-
itives plus function-predicates like "for-hammering" 
(Husserl made this very move in Cartesianische Medi-
tationen ). Heidegger spells out his implausibility claim 
in two ways. First, there is the argument from equip-
mental holism. Just adding to the representation of a 
table the fact that it is to eat at or to sit at barely scratches 
the surface of its interrelations with other equipment 
and with the human ro les and goals that determine what 
it is to be a table. 
Moreover, adding rules for deal ing with tab les does 
not capture our familiarity with tab les. Such function-
predicates and rules would not be sufficient to enable a 
person from a culture without tab les to cope with them 
or even to understand Western stories where tables 
played their normal part. AII the propositions speli ing 
out tableness would have ceteris paribus conditions 
and so would these conditions, etc. AI researchers had 
to admit that speli ing out these ceteris paribus condi-
tions would be dauntingly difficult. However, for Hei-
degger, given his claim that our commonsense under-
standing is a kind ofknowing-how, nota propositional 
knowing-that, things looked even more discouraging 
for cognitivism. Since our familiarity with the world 
consists in our skilled activity of responding to situa-
tions in appropriate ways, common sense is not a vast 
body of rules and facts. The task of explicitly, i.e., 
propositionally, representing everyday common sense 
is thus not just hard but hopelessly misguided. 
The second difficulty arises when one attempts to 
formalize how we use equipment in specific situations. 
Facts and rules are, by themselves, meaningless. So it is 
necessary for the programmer to assign them relevance 
so as to capture what Heidegger calls equipmental in-
volvement. But for the representationalist, the predi-
cates that must be added to define relevance are just 
more bare facts. To compute relevance in a specific sit-
uation a computer would ha veto follow rules to search 
through ali its facts for those that could possibly be rel-
evant, then apply further rules to determine which facts 
are usually relevant in this type of situation, and from 
ali these facts deduce which facts were actually rele-
vant in this particular situation. But in a large database 
such a search would be hopelessly difficult and would 
get more difficu!t the more rules one added to guide the 
search. 
Indeed, AI researchers have long observed that the 
more a physical symbol system "knows" about a partic-
ular state of affairs, the longer it takes it to retrieve the 
relevant information. This presents a general problem 
where scaling up is concerned. It has also been noted 
that for human beings, unlike databases, the more we 
know about a situation or individual, the casier it is to 
retrieve further relevant information. 
This defines the splitting of the ways between 
Husserl and AI, on the one hand, and Heidegger, on the 
other. The crucial question becomes: can there bea the-
ory of the everyday world, as rationalist philosophers 
have always held and Husserl at least leaves open, so 
that by representing this theory the mind can produce 
skilled. appropriate comportment? Or is the common-
sense background a familiarity based on a combination 
ofskills, practices, discriminations, etc., that are not in-
tentiona! "states" of a mind or subject, and so, a fortiori, 
do not ha ve the sort of representational content that can 
be explicated in terms of elements and rules? 
Husserl tried to avoid the problem posed by Heideg-
ger by making a move that was !ater frequently made 
in Al circles. He claimed that the WORLD, the back-
ground of significance, was merely a very complex 
system ofbeliefs, which, since they are ways oftaking 
things or ofthings counting for someone, he called "va-
lidities" (Geltungen). It followed that in principle one 
could suspend one's dwelling in the world and achieve 
a detached description of the intentiona! content of 
one's background beliefsystem. According to the Kri-
sis, "even the background ... ofwhich we are always 
concurrently conscious but which is momentarily irrel-
evant and remains completely unnoticed, sti li functions 
according to its implicit validities." Thus what Heideg-
ger calls familiarity with the world became for Husserl 
"a complex of performances, which are included as 
sedimented hist01y in the currently constituted inten-
tiona! unity ... -a history that o ne can a!ways uncover 
byfo!lowing a strict method." 
Husserl 's project, then, does more than anticipate 
cognitivism. Indeed, once Husserl allows the possibil-
ity of a mathesis of experience, he could only disassoci-
ate himselffrom the computationalist view ifhe could 
show that besides the manipulation of mental content 

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

on the hasis of its syntactic structure, there are men-
tal operations in which semantics plays an irreducible 
causal role. But once he allows the possibility that 
the semantic properties of noemata mirror their syn-
tactic ones, and holds that even skilled activities and 
background familiarity can be absorbed into noematic 
content -
i.e., once he has made ali the cognitivist 
moves criticized by Heidegger- it looks like he must 
allow the possibility of a model ofmentallife in which 
meaning and consciousness play no explanatory role. 
That is, Husserl can maintain the irreducibility of men-
tal meanings in his transcendental phenomenology but 
he has no reason to doubt the possibility of artificial 
intelligence. Indeed, he and AI researchers are engaged 
in the common task of making ali mental life explicit 
as symbolic representations-whether "symbol" is un-
derstood syntactically or semantically turns out not to 
be important. 
As Heidegger predicted, however, the task of writ-
ing out a complete theoretical account of everyday 
life turned out to bc much harder than initially ex-
pected. Husserl 's project ran into serious trouble, and 
there are signs that Minsky's has too. During twenty-
five years of trying to speli out the components of 
the subject's noematic representation of everyday ob-
jects, Husserl found that he had to include more and 
more of a subject's commonsense understanding of 
the everyday world. In Cartesianische Meditationen he 
lamented that "even the tasks that present themselves 
when we take single types of objccts as restricted clues 
prove tobe extremely complicated and always lead to 
extensive disciplines when we penetrate more deeply. 
That is the case, for example, with ... spatial objects 
(to say nothing of Nature) as such, of psycho-physical 
being and humanity as such, culture as such." In For-
male und transzendentale Logik ( 1929) he spoke ofthe 
noema's "huge concreteness" and of its "trcmendous 
complication," and he sadly concluded at the age of 
seventy-five that he was a perpetua! beginner and that 
phenomenology was an infinite task. 
There are hints in his frame paper that Minsky has 
embarked on the same "infinite task" that eventually 
overwhelmed Husserl. In this paper Minsky admits 
that just constructing a knowledge base is a major in-
tellectual research problem. He sees that a "minimal" 
commonsense system must "know" something about 
cause and effect, time, purpose, locality, process, and 
types of knowledge, and concludes that "we need a 
serious epistemological research effort in this area." 
Minsky's naivete and faith are astonishing. Transcen-
dental phenomenology was just such a research effort. 
In the light of Heidegger's phenomenological cri-
tique of Husserl, HUBERT DREYFUS predicted trouble for 
symbolic in formation processing. In his history of in-
tellectual issues in Al Allen Newell notes that "Drey-
fus 's central intellectual objection ... is that the anal-
ysis of the context of human action into discrete el-
ements is doomed to failure." But he adds that this 
warning was ignored-that "the answers, refutations, 
and analyses that have been forthcoming to Dreyfus's 
writings have simply not engaged this issue." 
Trouble was not long in coming to the fore, however, 
as the everyday world took its revenge on AI as it 
had on Husserlian phenomenology. What has come to 
be called the "commonsense knowledge problem" has 
blocked ali progress in AI for the past two decades. 
Terry Winograd, who had written the best AI program, 
SHLRDLU, was one of the first to see the limitations of 
scripts and frames. Having "lost faith" in AI, he now 
teaches Heidegger in his computer science courses at 
Stanford, and points out "the difficulty of formalizing 
the commonsense background that determines which 
scripts, goals and strategies are relevant and how they 
interact." 
Winograd is not the only AI rescarcher who has re-
alized the relevance of Heidegger. !-le notes that for 
those who have followed the history of artificial in-
telligence, it is ironic that the MIT laboratory should 
become a cradle of "Heideggerian AI." And he adds 
that, nevertheless, some of the work now being done 
at that laboratory seems to have been affected by Hei-
degger and Dreyfus. 
Winograd is referring to the influential theory of 
situated activity developed by Phil Agre and David 
Chapman. Agre and Chapman question the need for 
an interna! symbolic model of the world. Following 
Heidegger, they note that in our everyday coping we 
experience ourselves not as subjects with mental rep-
resentations over against objects with fixed properties, 
but rather as absorbed in our current situation, respond-
ing directly to its demands. Chapman concludes that 
"you don 't need to maintain a world model; the world 
is its own best representation." 
Agre and Chapman also adapt another Heidegge-

38 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
rian thesis that Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus developed 
in Mind Over Machine ( 1986)-namely, that behavior 
can be purposive without the agent "having in mind" 
a goal or purpose. They note that in a great many situ-
ations it is obvious what to do next given the configu-
ration ofmaterials at hand, and once you've done that, 
the next thing to do is likely to be obvious too. Thus 
complex sequences of actions result, without needing 
a complex control structure to decide what to do. 
What is original and important in Agre and Chap-
man 's work is that these ideas are taken out of the 
realm of armchair phenomenology and made specific 
enough to be implemented in programs. What results 
is a system that represents the world not as a set of 
objects with properties, but as current functions (what 
Heidegger called in-order-to's). Thus, to take a Hei-
deggerian example, 1 experience a hammer I am using 
not as an object with properties, but as being an in-
order-to-drive-in-this-nail. Only if there is some dis-
turbance does the skilled performer notice aspects of 
the situation such as the hammer being too heavy. Both 
of the above ways of being, which Heidegger calls 
the ready-to-hand and the unready-to-hand, are to be 
distinguished from what he calls the present-at-hand 
mode of being, the mode of being of objects. Objects 
can be recognized as the same even when they are 
used in different contexts or when some oftheir prop-
erties change. Before Agre and Chapman's work such 
reidentifiable objects with their changing features or 
properties had been the only mode ofbeing represented 
in AI models. Heideggerian AI seeks to represent the 
ready-to-hand and the unready-to-hand modes. To do 
so, Agre and Chapman introduce what they caii deictic 
representations. The units of deictic representation are 
entities, which are things in a particular relationship to 
the agent, and relational aspects of these entities. For 
example, the-cup-1-am-drinking~from is the name of 
an entity, and the-cup-1-am-drinking~fimn-is-almost­
emptv is the name of an aspect of it. 
Heideggerian AI has thus attempted to implement 
Dreyfus's account of Heidegger's phenomenology of 
everyday coping. It has not, however, attempted to im-
plement Heidegger's account ofthe background famil-
iarity on the basis ofwhich certain equipment is seen as 
relevant and certa in courses of action solicita response. 
This gap shows up in Agre and Chapman's unsatisfy-
ing account of relevance. For them the relevant aspects 
of the situation turn out to be a list of aspects that the 
programmer has determined in advance are possibly 
relevant at any given moment. So Heideggerian Al is 
true to Heidegger's phenomenology in what it leaves 
outlong-range planning and interna! representations of 
reidentifiable objects with context-frec features-but it 
lacks what any intelligent system needs- namely, the 
ability to discriminate relevant distinctions in the ski li 
domain and to learn new distinctions from experience. 
Thus Heideggerian AI, lacking any account of rele-
vance and significance, has turned out to be another 
dead end. 
The latest work in AI has consequently given up 
seeking symbolic representations and has gone back to 
the other research program begun in the 1950s-trying 
to model the way neurons work. Such models explain, 
among other things, why storing more facts makes it 
easier to retrieve the relevant ones. Neural net mod-
eling has at last enabled Heideggerian phenomenolo-
gists such as JOHN HAUGELAND and Dreyfus to answer 
a perennial objection of AI researchers, viz., that the 
mind must be using symbolic representations to pro-
duce intelligent behavior since no one has come up 
with any other account. Now there is a model ofbrain 
functioning that requires no mentalistic concepts such 
as symbols and rules at ali and so avoids the seem-
ing necessity of introducing structured mental repre-
sentations. Once neural networks have freed AI en-
thusiasts and philosophers from having to introduce 
symbolic operations that contradict the phenomenon, 
researchers can take skillful coping at face value as 
a response to the solicitations of the situation as did 
EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGISTS such as Heidegger and 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY.

AUSTRALIA 
European thinking with a strong 
Hegelian strain exerted a central influence on the ear-
liest philosophy in English-speaking Australia, which 
dates back to the 19th century. Its idealism was rooted 
in Scottish-British philosophy, but it also played softly 
to the colony's clergy. Interest in European thinkers 
was ali ve as is evidenced by articles on Spinoza, HENRI 
BERGSON, NICOLAI HARTMANN, and EDMUND HUSSERL in 
the early issues of The Australasian Journal of Psy-
chology and Philosophy, founded in 1923 and soon the 
mainstream philosophy journal in Australia, "Psychol-
ogy" being dropped from its title in 194 7. A review of 
Freud appeared alongside ones ofRussell and Wittgen-
stein and a lively pluralism ranged over psychology, ed-
ucation, anthropology, and other social sciences, none 
ofwhich had matured as independent disciplines at this 
stage. 
The leading link with the European phenomen-
ological movement in this period was in WILLIAM 
RALPH BOYCE GIBSON, at The University of Melbourne 
1911-35, who earned international recognition with 
his translation of Husserl 's ldeen zu ei ner reinen 
Phanomenologie und phanomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 ( 1913) as ldeas: General lntroduction to Pure 
Phenomenology ( 1931 ). Boyce Gibson had taken an 
interest in EDMUND HUSSERL 's phenomenology from the 
early 1920s and presented papers on his work. In 1928 
he traveled to Freiburg and met with Husserl, MAR-
TIN HEIDEGGER, and EMMANUEL LFVINAS, an immensely 
inspiring moment recorded in his diaries that sadly 
did not come to light until excerpts were published 
in 1971. Among the small circle of philosophers in 
Melbourne, there was also Alexander Gunn, who re-
ferred to Heidegger 's Sein und Zeit ( 1927) in The Prob-
lem of Time ( 1929), and J. McKELLAR STEWART, who 
reviewed Boyce Gibson 's translation of ldeen 1 and 
drew on Husserl's Formale und transzendentale Logik 
( 1929) and Meditations cartesiennes ( 1931 ). Boyce 
Gibson was earlier on influenced, then dissatisfied, by 
Husserl's separation of philosophy as a rigorous sci-
ence from Lebensphilosophie. His role in disseminat-
ing phenomenology in the English-speaking world may 
be gauged by the wide use of his translation of ldeen 1 
as a text over fi ve decades. However, apart from Boyce 
Gibson and McKellar Stewart (who moved to Adelaide 
in 1923 ), no philosopher of major significance emerged 
in this period to continue phenomenological scholar-
ship in the southern antipodes. 
Across the Tasman Sea in 1934, J. N. FINDLAY, who 
had developed an interest in FRANZ BRENTANO, attended 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER 's lectures in Germany, and visited 
Ludwig Wittgenstein in Cambridge, arrived in New 
Zealand to join the University of Otago, Dunedin, 
where he began his book on Meinong. The other 
New Zea1and universities were not eager to develop 
interest in European philosophy of any kind, except 
in Christchurch (with its theological orientation) and 
much !ater (the l960s) in Auckland, where K. B. PFLAUM 
arrived from Europe to teach Husserlian phenomen-
ology and cuvE PEARSON from Sydney to teach exis-
tentialism and PAUL TILLICH's existential theology. 
During the war years, the tradition of ANALYTIC 
PHILOSOPHY became the dominant force in the British 
philosophical scene and in the antipodes as well. The 
vestiges of European philosophy were ali but eclipsed. 
The hiatus was further accentuated in the postwar years 
when french EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY emerged 
to reframe the concerns of classical phenomenology. 
These decades witnessed a hegemonic spread of the 
British "style of mind," the hallmark of English uni-
versities, especially Oxford and Cambridge. Australian 
philosophers and budding graduates chose this royal 
path and destination for research or higher studies, dis-
playing a strident, if a trifle aggressive, tough-minded 
disposition to make analytic philosophy the Australian

orthodoxy with growing American analytic influence. 
The phenomenological-European tradition was de-
rided for its obscurity, lack of logica! rigor, and non-
testability by the empirica! yardstick. These bleak years 
amounted to a denial of Australia's own history of plu-
ralism, and also of a multiculturalism that was shim-
mering in the popular quarters with the migration to 
Australia of European refugees (artists and intellectu-
als among them). J. J. C. Smart arrived in Adelaide in 
1949 (after converting from High Anglican idealism 
to scientific realism), championing his newfound com-
mitment to Australian materialism, which he shared 
with David M. Armstrong; this virtually eliminated 
any lingering concerns with phenomenology. 
The submerged movement, however, was rekin-
dled in 1958 with the return to Melbourne of MAX 
CHARLESWORTH, after completion of doctoral studies 
at Leuven. Charlesworth introduced what was prob-
ably the first full course in contemporary Continen-
tal philosophy in Australia: it included an introduc-
tion to Husserl, but had a main foeus on .IEAN-PAUL 
SARTRE and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY. He forged Jinks 
with colleagues in French, German, and Theology 
schools where European existentialist wriţings were 
better appraised than in philosophy circles. For a 
while, his name became synonymous with existen-
tialism in Australia and his courses and lectures (in-
cluding radio broadcasts) attracted a significant fol-
lowing. Charlesworth encouraged severa! students to 
base their dissertations on the works ofMerleau-Ponty 
and Husserl, as well as on Sartre and SIMONE DE BEAU-
VOIR, Freud, Marx, and Camus. 
The 1960s and 1970s spawned other fads in exis-
tentialist thinking, and marginally in phenomenology, 
in the wake of student uprisings and the so-called 
"countercultural" movement, but more significantly in 
critica! and literary studies, in PSYCHOLOGY and PSY-
CHOANALYSIS, and with FEMINISM and the sexual Jib-
eration movement. A growing number of Australian 
academics and students outside of philosophy learned 
of Heidegger, Husserl, Sartre, and Beauvoir through 
these burgeoning fields of study and popular literature. 
(An Existentialist Society was founded in Melbourne 
in this era and continues to provide a popular forum 
for lectures on phenomenology or, say, the latest twist 
in the Heideggerian saga.) 
While Melbourne had given itself over almost 
wholly (barring the Charlesworth moderation) to 
Wittgensteinian thought, Sydney was still under the 
sway of John Anderson ( 1893-1962), whose system-
atic approach to history ofphilosophy proved less hos-
tile to European thought. Anderson 's students heard 
something about European thinkers, although they 
were not encouraged to study these thinkers directly. 
In 1960 an honors thesis was written on the concept 
of INTENTIONALITY in Brentano, and in 1965 a book on 
Brentano was published by the Polish born Melbourne 
phi]osopher .lAN SRZEDNICKI. 
ConcomitantJy, in the 1960s WILLIAM V. DONIELA 
joined the University of Newcastle in New South 
Wales, having studied in Freiburg for his doctorale fol-
lowing his undergraduate studies in Sydney. His pre-
eminent concern and reputation was in Hegel's philos-
ophy and social theory, but he took a critica! interes! 
in Heidegger and Husserl, and he was to become a 
prominent figure in the phenomenological movement 
in Australia. He is especially known for his perception 
of continuity between "Continental" and "analytic" tra-
ditions, while his approach to LOGIC was mitigated 
by his work in Hegel's logic and influenced by the 
emerging European ( e.g., Frankfurt school) critiques 
of logica! positivism. Elsewhere in New South Wales, 
studies were being made of GABRIEL MARCEL, Sartre 
and Merleau-Ponty: for instance, TONY PALMER taught 
Sartre at Macquarie University in 1968. WILLIAM GIN-
NANE published a review ofthe 1962 English translation 
of Merleau-Ponty's Phbwnu?nologie de la perception 
( 1945) in the Australasian Journal of Philosophy. 
By the 1970s courses in phenomenology and exis-
tentialism began to appear across the philosophy de-
partments. Contributing to this growth was the creation 
of new, smaller universities based on interdisciplinary 
and other innovative practices. In 1977 Charlesworth 
moved to Deakin University near Melbourne to spear-
head a cross-disciplinary program in "distance ed-
ucation" (i.e., teaching students in remote locations 
through print and audio media), drawing on pheno-
menological and hermeneutica! thinking. His team in-
cluded JOCELYN DUNPHY (now DUNPHY-BLOMFIELD), who 
had studied with PAUL RICCEUR in Paris. Her major re-
search is on Ricreur's developments ofphenomenology 
through HERMENEUTICS, unique for its analysis of "hu-
man time" as experience and as narrative. Her confer-
ence papers in Australia have included studies ofwill-

ing and suffering, and reflections on Australian cu !ture 
and history inspired by Ricoeur and by Husserl's Die 
Krisis der europiiischen Wissenschaften und die tran-
szendentale Phiinomenologie ( 1936). The relevance of 
phenomenology to the study of RELIGION and "other" 
cultures, and to parallel hermeneutica! praxis in non-
Western traditions, have also been pursued at Deakin, 
e.g., by PURUSHOTTAMA BILIMORIA with his added exper-
tise in Indian and comparative philosophy. There is also 
now keen interest in the phenomenology ofthe BODY, 
deriving from Nietzsche and Merleau-Ponty, among a 
younger generation of Australian postmodernists and 
social theorists. 
Two philosophers at Macquarie University, in Syd-
ney, have given considerable prominence to pheno-
menology. LUCIANA O'DWYER (nee BELLENETTI) came 
from ltaly via Oxford where she had worked with 
Gilbert Ryle, but locked her preoccupation firmly 
in Descartes, Vico, and, more studiously, Husserl. 
O'Dwyer has remained in her Australian career the 
closest of ali her Australian colleagues to the pheno-
menological mainstream; she is described as a Husserl 
scholar in the purest sense, focusing on the transcen-
dental aspects of Husserl 's ideas in Cartesianische 
Meditationen and the Krisis with a gallant concern 
to recover the radical character of the transcendental 
dimension. O'Dwyer has earned thc reputation ofbe-
ing Australia 's leading Husserl scholar, in her effort to 
explicate and interpret the exact meaning of the term 
"transcendental" in relation to the EGO (the "subject" 
in living relationship to the community) in Husserl's 
critique. Her colleague MAX DEUTSCHER moved from 
the materialism de bate of the !960s toward Continen-
tal philosophy, more especially Husserl 's phenomen-
ology and Sartre, combining this !ater with feminist 
thought ( especially Michelle Le Doeuff). Along with 
O'Dwyer he generated enthusiasm among students in 
phenomenology. Deutscher's own writing tends to-
ward idiomatic "lifeworld"-oriented phenomenology, 
which draws eclectically on both analytic and Con-
tinental themes, criticizing the "totalitarianisms" of 
Marxism, Christianity, and physicalism. In Subjecting 
and Objecting ( 1983 ), he takes his cue from Husserl 's 
concern with the crisis caused for human conscious-
ness by the rise of modern science and the attendant 
call for return to rigorously investigated subjectivity. 
He looks for new ways of conceiving and applying (in 
the broader arena also of beliefs, attitudes, feelings, 
and actions) the notion of "objectivity" wherein the 
person as "subject" is not decentered or routed out~ 
hence the novel idea of"subjecting" in response to the 
challenges ofthe world of objects. 
As Macquarie was becoming an Australian center 
for phenomenology, the Australian National University 
in the nation 's capital, Canberra, with GENEVIEVE LLOYD. 
WILLIAM GINNANE, and KIM LYCOS, were trying OUt textual 
readings ofMerleau-Ponty in the early 1970s, followed 
by discussions on Nietzsche, MARX. and Freud. Lycos 
was translating a text of Foucault (!ater abandoned), 
and giving seminars on DERRIDA and FREGE; Lloyd's 
own work extended to Spinoza, FOUCAULT, and phi-
losophy and literature, the latter resulting in her most 
recent book, Being in Time ( 1993 ). Here also, RICHARD 
CAMPBELL developed a special interes! in Heidegger. 
Campbell himself began his philosophical studies un-
der John Anderson in Sydney and made his forays 
into Heidegger through a detour into theology, having 
published on Kierkegaard and Bultmann in the !960s. 
The Australian National University conferred the first 
Ph.D. in this new field to ROBIN SMALL for his thesis 
on Heidegger:~ Concept of Human Nature, which he 
completed in 1974 under the supervision ofCampbell. 
Small ]ater extended his work to Nietzsche and has 
remained very much a foca! figure in the Australian 
phenomenological movement. At the same university 
in 1973 :vlAURITA HAR:-.JEY introduced programs in exis-
tentialism and phenomenology and traveled overseas 
to speak with practitioners such as Paul Ricceur, while 
working on her doctorale on Husserl. She published 
the first phenomenologically-oriented work tobe com-
pleted in Australia ( 1984). Harney has since gone on to 
work on a phenomenological hermeneutica! approach 
to ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE. 
The activities just described occurred in no unified 
sense; philosophers working in this area were barely 
aware of each other's works and met only at main-
stream philosophy conferences. It was not until 1976 
that the first phenomenology conference was organized 
in Canberra, bringing together over seventy academics 
and students. The papers developed ~ put together 
in a modest publication by the conference convener, 
Harney ~stand as testimony to the growth of pheno-
menology across the island continent. 
A second phenomenology conference was held in 

42 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Brisbane in 1980, where the Australasian Association 
for Phenomenology and Social Science was formed.ln 
1981, a decision was taken to hold yearly phenomen-
ology conferences, alternating between Victoria and 
New South Wales (and occasionally in Canberra). At 
the 1984 conference the name of the association was 
changed to the Australasian Association for Pheno-
menology and Social Philosophy (AAPSP), which un-
wittingly alienated the social scientists but made space 
for broader aspects of contemporary European philos-
ophy such as poststructuralism, literary theory, femi-
nism, and critica] philosophy. The Newcastle Univer-
sity Philosophy Club under the impetus of Doniela 
issued the conference papers in its journal Dialectic. 
The practice of bringing out "proceedings" has been 
continued by the respective conference organizers. For 
a while some pa pers from phenomenology conferences 
appeared in the journal Critica! Philosophyco-founded 
by PAUL CRITTENDEN with Lycos and LJoyd. The journa] 
did not survive the recession of the 1980s. Australian 
phenomenologists continue to publish in overseasjour-
nals, notably Journal ofthe British Societyfor Pheno-
mcnology, International Philosophical Quarterly, and 
Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, although 
the Australasian Joumal of Philosophy published its 
first paper on Derrida in September 1993. The other 
philosophy journal to come out of Australia, Sophia, 
also carries phenomenological-hermeneutical discus-
sions. 
In 1990 the AAPSP held its first international 
conference, in Melbourne; invited overseas speakers 
inc]uded J. N. MOHANTY and DON IHDE. The confer-
ence explored the tension between phenomenology 
and hermeneutics in the areas of crisis presented by 
TECHNOLOGY in contemporary thought and culture. 
Some twenty-four papers were presented, pointing in 
the main to the continuing practice or "doing" of 
phenomenology in Australia. Mohanty's plenary pa-
per on Foucault as well as his active, self-effacing 
engagement throughout the conference (with encour-
aging responses to younger participants), along with 
Ihde 's work on technology and the LIFEWORLD, facil-
itated a dialogue between Australian and American-
European phenomenology. Mohanty's paper, "Are In-
dian and Western Philosophies radically different?" 
and Ihde's on "Multiculturality" linked the conference 
with themes explored in the first Asian and Compara-
ti ve Philosophy meeting in Australia that followed. The 
idea of internationalizing the phenomenology confer-
ence and dovetailing it with a cross-cultural philosophy 
conference was proposed and carried through by Bil-
imoria with the cooperation of Dunphy-Blomfield and 
STAN VAN HOOFT. Van Hooft was himself a former stu-
dent of Charlesworth, who had written his thesis in 
phenomenology and has been active in teaching Euro-
pean philosophy; in 1995 he published a book entitled 
Caring that drew on Heidegger's concept of Sorgc. 
So 1990 marked another watershed in Australian 
phenomenology, with its internationalization and mul-
ticultural supplement. In the proceedings recording 
this conference, one paper was significantly absent, 
namely, Campbell's "Truth in Action," which was in-
corporated into the final chapter ofhis important study, 
Truth and Historicity (1992). In his historically sensi-
tive philosophizing, Campbell explores the precondi-
tions of a conception oftruth within the broader horizon 
of the contingency, cultural relativity, and historicity 
( Geschichtlichkeit) ofhuman understanding, grounded 
in the lifeworld rather than harkening back to the ab-
solute, eterna! verities of the Platonic conception, or 
Augustinian identities. Such a "truth" would find its 
te/os in fulfillment or action rather than in linguistic 
correctness or correspondence. While this has echoes 
in the Heideggerian notion of aletheia, with its con-
notations of revelation and unconcealment, its closest 
analogue is in the Hebrew notions of truth and faith-
fulness. In the final chapters Campbell draws together 
Hegelian and post-Enlightenment critica] thinking on 
truth, passing through the pragmatism of Dewey and 
the communicative ethic of Habermas, and nominal-
ing speech acts, rather than statements or assertoric 
sentences, as the primary locus oftruth. This is a good 
example of the new frontiers into which phenomen-
ological inspiration is heading in Australia. 
For a smattering of current work one is best re-
ferred to the anthology of essays entitled Transcen-
dental and Cultural Phenomenology: Australian Per-
spectives (in press). In the preface, its editor, Small, 
notes that the contributors represent a diverse cross-
section of Australian philosophy, about half of whom 
were born outside Australia, some ofwhom work out-
side ofphilosophy departments (or in interdisciplinary 
schools), bringing differences of cultural background 
to philosophical discourse. In a curious way, this trend 

AUSTRIA 
43 
has slowly tended to return Australian philosophy to 
the pluralism of the early days. And diversification 
is likely to continue for other reasons, not least the 
growing awareness of Australia's proximity to Asian-
Pacific cultures; a declining Anglo-Celtic population 
with the cultural distance from Britain~Europe; and 
the sustained intervention ofnative Aboriginal primor-
dial cultural articulations and arts. The essays range 
from scholarly studies to new developments ofpheno-
menological themes, as well as critiques ofphenomen-
ological research. At least three essays offer criticisms 
of Heidegger- O'Dwyer on the traditional problems 
of realism, invoking Husserl and Ryle, and Bilimoria 
on the open-ended ambiguities of Heidegger toward 
Asian thought despite his anxiety about the "Euro-
peanization of the Earth," with MARION TAPPER being 
more critica! of Richard Rorty than of Heidegger in re-
duc ing philosophy to literary history and epistemology 
to ontologica! presuppositions. 
Tapper is a good example of a second genera-
tion "full-fledged" phenomenologist, supervised by 
Doniela for her thesis on Heidegger, and in 1983 ap-
pointed to Melbourne to replace BRENDA JUDGE, who 
had taught the courses introduced by Charlesworth. 
Tapper worked closely with Lycos (un tii the latter 'sun-
timely death in 1995). RUSSELL GRIGG, a former student 
of Charlesworth 's who completed his master's thesis 
on Rica.:ur and went on to study in Lacan's school 
in Paris, combines interests in phenomenology, ana-
lytic philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Other younger 
scholars include KEVIN HART (tending toward decon-
struction and atheology), ELIZABETH GROSZ (working 
on French feminist theorists and Nietzsche), and KAREN 
GREEN (who has also worked on femininity and tran-
scendence ). PETER PARKER ( fonnerly ofRhodes Univer-
sity) with RENUKA SHARMA work on the interface with 
psychology, psychoanalysis, and phenomenology, in-
spired by AMEDEO GIORGI. That the project of infusing 
phenomenology into Australia is by no means complete 
can be illustrated by way ofthe most recent successful 
submission of a masterly doctoral thesis on Husserl 's 
idea oftemporalization, by DAMIEN BYERS, a young and 
promising Husserl scholar who researched in the Bel-
gium archives and now teaches at Sydney.

Philosophy in the German-speaking 
world can usefully be divided into two distinct tra-
ditions, which we might refer to as the German and 
the A ustrian (orA ustro-Hungarian) traditions, respec-
tively. The main line of the first begins with KANT, 
FICHTE, HEGEL, and SCHELLING and ends with MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER, Theodor Adorno (1903~ 1969), and Ernst 
Bloch. The ma in line ofthe second, which embraces the 
philosophy of Prague, Lemberg (now Lvov), and Cra-
cow as much as that of Vienna and Graz, begins with 
Bernard Bolzano ( 1781~1848), Ernst Mach (1838-
1916), and Alexius Meinong (1853~1920), and ends 
with Ludwig Wittgenstein ( 1889~ 1951 ), Otto Neurath 
( 1882~1945), and Karl Popper ( 1909~1994). Here we 
shall concentrate on the comparatively neg1ected tradi-
tion of Austrian philosophy and on the ro1e of pheno-
menology therein. Broadly, we can say that, where 
(Protestant) Germans have tended to emphasize in 
their philosophies the ro le of "subjectivity," the Aus-
trians have remained faithfu1 to the idea ofphilosophia 
perennis that is rooted in the Aristotelian-Scholastic 
tradition.

Austrian philosophy, published his four-volume Wis-
senschafts/ehre in 183 7. The logica! Platonism that is 
propounded in this work is present in various forms in 
the work ofBolzano's successors, and it can stil! be de-
tected in the Prolegomena to EDMUND HUSSERL's Logis-
che Untersuchungen ( 1900---1901 ). FRANZ BRENTANO, 
too, though born in Germany, falls squarely within 
the Austrian tradition as far as his philosophy is 
concerned, and Brentano 's most important students 
-
above ali Christian von Ehrenfels ( 1859-1932), 
Anton Marty (1847-1914), Alexius Meinong (1853-
1920), Cari Stumpf( 1848-1936), Kasimir Twardowski 
( 186&--193 8), and Tomâacs Garrigue Masaryk ( 1850---
1937)- helped to spread the influence of his ideas 
and methods throughout the Habsburg Empire. Not the 
least important of these students was Edmund Husserl 
himse1f, who was born in Habsburg Moravia in 1859. 
Husserl helped to spread Brentano's ideas and methods 
into Germany proper. The move to "transcendental ide-
alism" in Husserl 's !ater writings implies, however, that 
his philosophy must be seen as straddling the boundary 
between the two traditions. 
Many 19th century philosophers, including Franz 
Brentano, accepted a doctrine of immanentism, accord-
ing to which MEANING, TRUTH, VALUE, and sometimes 
even the WORLD as a whole are seen as being immanent 
to (as real constituent parts or "contents" of) the mind 
or "spirit" ( Geist). It was in no small part a result of 
the efforts of Brentano 's Austrian disciples, including 
Husserl, that this immanentistic mode of philosophiz-
ing was undermined- and phenomeno1ogy itself, as 
well as the clarification of the concept of INTENTIONAL-
ITY that it brings in its wake, may be seen as a byproduct 
of this effort to turn away from "subjectivity" and go 
back to the matters themselves. 
Brentano 's thinking is founded on the discipline of 
"descriptive psychology," conceived in Cartesian fash-
ion as an epistemologically secure starting point not 
only for the discipline of philosophy, but also for scien-
tific knowledge of other sorts. But descriptive psychol-
ogy is also an empirica/ science (a feature ofBrentano 's 
thinking that reflects the influence on Austrian philoso-
phy OfBRITISH EMPIRICISM). It is a science built up on the 
basis of our capacity to distinguish in experience the 
parts and moments of our mental acts and to grasp cer-
tain necessary and intelligible relations between them. 
The training in the methods of descriptive psychol-
ogy that Brentano 's students received instilled in them 
an attitude of descriptive or taxonomical realism. This 
involves the view that description is prior to explana-
tion: an explanation of given phenomena is of value 
only to the extent that we "know what we are talking 
about" when we refer to the phenomena in question. 
Descriptive psychology is therefore prior also to that 
sort of experimental ( or "genetic") psychology that 
seeks to establish the laws governing the order of men-
tal phenomena as events unfolding intime. Descriptive 
realism presupposes that given segments of reality can 
be described in a way that is adequate to the matters 
on hand. Description proceeds not by building abstract 
models of the phenomena, but by concerning itself 
directly with the "matters themselves." Moreover, it 
involves the view that description should yield a tax-
onomy of the different kinds of basic constituents in 
whatever is the relevant domain, and of the different 
forms ofrelation between them; hence the ontologica! 
theory of part and whole or "mereology" comes to en-
joy a privileged status within the edifice of science as 
a whole. 
Brentano 's doctrine of intentionality, presented in 
the Psycho/ogie vom empirischen Standpunkt ( 1874) 
and elsewhere, is stil! resolutely immanentistic. The 
objects of our mental acts are seen as immanent as 
"intentionally existent in" these acts themselves. The 
tricky issue, which was addressed systematically by 
Brentano's students, is one of explaining how mental 
acts are a bie, on occasions, to achieve a directedness to 
transcendent objects in the world. The problem turns on 
the fact that acts-for example, ofperception or ofha1-
lucination- that seem from the si de of consciousness 
tobe exactly alike, may differ radically with regard to 
their relation to an object. Yet acts that lack ( existing) 
objects may yet be described using the very same terms 
that we use for acts that hit their targets- as when we 
say that Hans was thinking a boul unicorns or Mary was 
dreaming a boul Atlantis. The account ofthese matters 
worked out by Brentano's students leans heavily on 
his theory of "modified" uses of language. We distin-
guish, first of ali, two sorts ofadjectives: the attributive 
and the modifving adjectives. The fonner complete or 
enlarge the meaning of the expressions to which they 
are attached (as in "good man," "red horse," "genuine 
rubies"). The latter completely change these original 
meanings (as for example in: "dead man," "cancelled 

AUSTRIA 
45 
performance," "declined handshake," "frustrated en-
try," and so on). 
For the early Husserl, our talk ofthe objects ofnon-
veridical acts is modified talk, and the correspondingly 
"modified acts" are distinguished not by the fact that 
there are special objects to which they are dirccted, but 
by the fact that they lack abjecte~ entirely: a fictional 
object is nota special kind of object, any more than an 
averted war is a special kind ofwar. Thus the structure 
of modified acts is not in any sense relational. It is 
rather to be understood in tenns of special interna] 
qualities that the given acts possess. Certainly we find 
it convenient to avail ourselves oftalk of"fictional" or 
"intentiona!" objects in order to describe such qualities, 
but this fact has no ontologica! significance. The view 
in question was worked out by Husserl in papers on 
Twardowski that date from 1894. Husserl insists quite 
commonsensically that to say that the god Jupiter is an 
intentiona! object of my act is not to say that there is 
something, namely Jupiter, that lacks existence but is 
thought about by me. It is simply to say that my act 
is structured qualitatively in a certain way, so that it is 
describable as a presentation-of-the-god-Jupiter. 
Another Brentano student, Christian von Ehrenfels, 
was born in the vicinity ofVienna in 1859 and served as 
professor of philosophy in Prague for more than thirty 
years. Von Ehrenfels was above ali responsible for ini-
tiating the revolution in psychological research that is 
associated with the concept of gestalt, a revolution to 
which contributions were made also by von Ehrenfels' 
teacher Meinong, by the members ofMeinong's school 
in Graz; by Karl Buhler (1879-1963) and his asso-
ciates in Vienna, and most importantly by the group 
working on GESTAL T PSYCHOLOGY around Stumpf in 
Berlin, including not only Von Ehrenfels' student Max 
Wertheimer ( 1880-1943), but a1so Kurt Koffka (1886--
1941 ), Wo1fgang Koh1er ( 1887-1867),and Kurt Lewin 
( 1890-194 7). Wertheimer was a1so influenced by the 
writings of Husserl, and particularly by the third ofthe 
latter 's Logische Untersuchungen on the theory of part, 
whole, and dependence, and he maintained throughout 
his life a characteristically Husserlian interes! in the 
foundations of LOGIC and in the relations between the 
logica! laws and the flux of mental events involved in 
thinking. The Gestalt psychologists also influcnced the 
thinking ofthe Austrian novelist Robert Musil (1880-
1942), a student of Stumpf and erstwhile assistant of 
Meinong in Graz, whose novel Der Mann ohne Eigen-
schafien (The man without qualities), is also marked at 
crucial points by Husserl's ideas on mental experience. 
The university in Prague could look back on a rich 
psychological tradition, beginning with the phenomen-
ological work on color vision of J. E. Purkinje ( 1787-
1869) and Ewald Hering ( 1834--1918) and extending 
to Stumpf (who was professor in Prague from 1879 
to 1884, before moving to Halle, where Husserl came 
înt o contact with him ). Anton Marty, too, was for a long 
period professor at Prague, and was responsible for ap-
plying Brentano 's ideas in the are a ofthe science oflin-
guistics, where his writings anticipated contemporary 
work on linguistic universals. Marty also played a ro le 
in the development of Brentanian ideas on LANGUAGF 
in the direction of a theory of speech acts, and exerted 
an influence in this respect on REALISTIC PHENOME:-.JOL-
OGISTS such as JOHANNES DAUBERT and ADOLF REINACH 
in Munich as well as on ROMAN JAKOBSON and other 
members of the Prague Linguistic Circle. Marty 's cir-
ele in Prague also included Oskar Kraus ( 1872-1942), 
LUDWIG LANDGREBE, and Hugo Bergmann ( 1883-1975) 
-
the latter a close friend of Franz Kafka, the two 
having together attended philosophy lectures of Yon 
Ehrenfels and Marty as part oftheir studies at Prague; 
Bergmann also initiated Kafka into the mysteries of 
the "Louvre Circle," a discussion group devoted to the 
study of Brentano 's thinking. 
Von Ehrenfels' doctrine of "gestalt qualities," first 
put forward in 1891, was a response to a problem that 
had arisen within the atomistic framework that had 
hitherto dominated the science of psychology. How, 
if perception is built up out of "atoms" or "elements" 
of sensation, are we to understand the perception of 
a complex formation such as a melody? How, above 
ali, are we to explain the fact that we can recognize the 
"same" melody even though it has been transposed into 
a different key? Von Ehrenfels' answer to this question 
amounted to a radical overhaul of the atomistic ap-
proach in psychology. It involved the postulation of 
sui generic qualities of complex wholes, qualities that 
are given immediately in experience and that are in-
variant even through transformations ofthe associated 
sensory elements that serve as their bases. 
Husserl developed ideas similar to those of Von 
Ehrenfels in Philosophie der Arithmetik ( 1891 ). In 
chapter Il of this work, he points to certain "figu-

46 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
rai" or "quasi-qualitative moments" whose existence 
is implied in, e.g., our talk of a line of soldiers, an 
avenue oftrees, a swarm ofbirds. In his Logische Un-
tersuchungen, Husserl refers to dependent objects that 
serve to unify other objects in larger unitary wholes as 
"moments of unity," a term suggested by Alois Riehl 
( 1844-1924). Such moments of unity, Husserl says, 
are "nothing other than those contents which were re-
ferred to by Ehrenfels as 'gestalt qualities,' by me [in 
the Philosophie der Arithmetik] as 'figura! moments' 
and by Meinong as 'founded contents'." 
In 1 895 Twardowski was appointed professor of 
philosophy in Lemberg (Lvov), sti li at that time an Aus-
trian town (formerly the cradle of Polish civilization; 
now in Ukraine), where he continued to hold lectures 
until his death in 1938. Twardowski's influence on Pol-
ish philosophy extended not only to phenomenologists 
such as ROMAN INGARDEN and LEOPOLD BLAUSTEIN, but 
also to the members of the Lvov-Warsaw school of 
logic. The degree of interconnectedness between Pol-
ish logic and Austrian (Brentanian) philosophy is well 
illustrated by the case ofthe logician Jan Lukasiewicz 
( 1878-1956 ), who not only studied with Twardowski 
and with Stumpf in Berlin and Meinong in Graz, but 
also published reviews ofworks by Husserl. 
Twardowski 's Zur Lehre vom Jnhalt und Gegen-
stand der Vorstellungen (On the content and object of 
presentation, 1894) represents a combination ofthe in-
fluence of Brentano's psychology and Bolzano's log-
ica] Platonism. Twardowski here defends a tripartite 
ontology of mind that distinguishes, in addition to the 
act, also the (immanent) content and the (transcen-
dent) object. (Twardowski 's work in this connection 
has been compared to GOTTLOB FREGE's tripartite the-
ory oflinguistic meaning in terms of expression, sense, 
and referent.) In his paper entitled "O czynnosciach 
i wytworach" ("Actions and products," 1912), Twar-
dowski criticizes the view according to which Platonic 
abstracta would serve as guarantors of the objectivity 
ofmeaning in a fashion suggested by Bolzano or Frege. 
Meanings, Twardowski now holds, are not durable 
items of worldly ( or extra-worldly) furniture. Rather, 
they exist only so long as there exist mental processes 
that produce them. Yet there is a sense in which mean-
ings may be said to exist dispositionally in the corre-
sponding signs. This is because if appropriate back-
ground conditions are satisfied, a sign enjoys an endur-
ing capacity to bring about relevant transient meaning-
acts. This, as Twardowski points out, explains our 
tendency to assert that the meaning is somchow "in-
cluded" or "embodied" in the sign, and to speak of a 
"fixing" in the sign of a nondurable mental product 
in a way that is analogous to the fixing of a sound 
by means of a phonograph record. It explains also our 
commonsense assumption that our thoughts grow in 
complexity in tandem with our acquisition of succes-
sively more sophisticated rules of language. 
Systematic complexity in the world of signs may 
contribute to -
is indeed for Twardowski quite lit-
erally a cause of- a parallel systematic complexity 
in the "subjective" realm ofmeaning. Communication 
and mutual understanding is possible, on this account, 
not because our words and sentences re late to Platonic 
meaning cntities capable ofbeing entertained simulta-
neously by different subjects, but because our words 
are able to evoke in others mental processes that are in 
relevant respects similar to those mental processes that 
those words were used to express. These ideas exerted 
an influence not least on the theory of language and 
meaning put forward by Ingarden in Das literarische 
Kunstwerk (The literary work of art, 1931 ). 
Twardowski also influenced Meinong, whose "the-
ory of objects" amounts to an ontology ofact-correlates 
that is strongly phenomenological in spirit, and the 
same holds too of the work of Ernst Mally (1879-
1944), Stephan Witasek ( 1870--1915), Vittorio Benussi 
( 1878-1927), and Franc V eber ( 1890--197 5 ), along 
with other members ofMeinong's school in Graz. Be-
nussi and his assistant Ce sare M usatti ( 1897-1989) 
founded in ltaly a tradition of phenomenological rsv-
CHOLOGY that has been kept alive in our own day above 
ali by Gaetano Kanizsa and Paolo Bozzi in the former 
Habsburg Imperial harbor city of Trieste. 
AII ofthe thinkers mentioned above were inspired, 
directly or indirectly, by Brentano 's project of an ontol-
ogy ofmind that would provide an exhaustive account 
of the different mental constituents and of the ways 
in which these constituents are built up to yield larger 
complex wholes. Brentano 's ideas in this connection 
can be seen to stand at the beginning of a tradition 
that results inter alia in Husserl 's development of the 
FORMAL ONTOLOGY ofparts and wholes in the Logische 
Untersuchungen; in the theory of objects of Meinong; 
in the Graz, Berlin, and Trieste schools of GEST ALT PSY-

AUSTRIA 
47 
CHOLOGY; and in the development of mereology and 
logica! grammar in Poland. 
The idea of a logica! gram mar, of a formal theory 
of the categories of linguistic units and of the catego-
riallaws governing the combination ofsuch units, was 
first put forward by Husserl in his fourth Investiga-
tion. This work influenced in turn the development of 
the theory of semantic (!ater "syntactic") categories by 
the great Polish logician Stanislaw Lesniewski ( 1886--
1939), contributions to which were also made by Kaz-
imierz Ajdukiewicz ( 1890--1963 ), who studied with 
Husserl at Gottingen in the 1920s. Lesniewski, too, 
inherited through Twardowski an interes! in Brentano 
and his school, and as a young man he had conceived 
the project of translating Marty's Untersuchungen zur 
Grundlegungder al/gemeinen Grammatik und Sprach-
philosophie (lnvestigations on general grammar and 
philosophy of language, 1908) into Polish. As he him-
selfexpressed it, Lesniewski grew up" 'tuned' to 'gen-
eral grammar' and logico-semantic problems â la Ed-
mund Husserl and the representatives of the so-called 
Austrian school." 
Para li el to the tradition of Brentano and his disci-
ples is the empiricist school of Austrian philosophy 
established by Ernst Mach (1838~1916), the fruits of 
whose efforts in Vienna and Prague can be seen not 
]east in the growth of the LOGICAL POSITIVIST move-
ment in Central Europe in the 1920s and 1930s. The 
project of phenomenology- the project of providing 
a painstakingly adequate description of what is given 
in experience precisely as it is given -
can itself be 
interpreted as a more comprehensive and more radical 
version of positivism in the traditional sense. Indeed, 
Hermann Liibbe finds no difficulty in asserting that 
"'Ernst Mach and other critica! empiricists, regardless 
of their 'positivism,' belong in the tradition of pheno-
menology." 
The superficial view ofthe relations between pheno-
menology and the Vienna positivists has long centered 
around the attack of Rudolf Carnap (1891~1970) in 
the second volume of Erkenntnis on the "metaphys-
ical nonsense" of Heidegger's Sein und Zeit ( 1927). 
Thus it has been readily assumed that phenomenology 
as a whole appeared to Carnap (who had studied with 
Husserl in Gi:ittingen in 1924-25) and to other mem-
bers ofthe Vienna Ci rele as just another example ofthe 
bad old metaphysics that they were aiming to destroy. 
The two camps were certainly at odds with each other 
in central points of doctrine. It was Ingarden who pre-
sented one ofthe first formulations ofthe now familiar 
criticism of the Vienna ci rele verifiability criterion of 
meaning- that the criterion is itself meaningless by 
its own lights -
at the Prague World Congress of 
Philosophy in 1934. Yet FELIX KAUFMANN was ab]e to 
retain friendly relations with both camps, and there 
are a number ofrespects in which the members ofthe 
Vienna Circ le were influenced by Husserl 's phenomen-
ology, even if only in the sense that, as we shall see, 
phenomenology provided a stock of problems that the 
positivists felt called upon to resolve. 
The two (Brentanian and logica] positivist) strands 
of Austrian philosophy were indeed at one stage so 
closely intertwined that Husserl could be considered 
as a potential successor to Mach in the chair in Vienna, 
and GUIDO KUNG has defended the view that there are 
quite specific parallels between Husserlian phenomen-
ology and the project of"explication" that is defended 
by Carnap in Der logische Aufbau der vVelt (The log-
ica! structure of the world, 1928). A view of this sort 
was advanced already in 1932 by Ernst Polak, a stu-
dent of Moritz Schlick (1882~1936) and man-about-
town in Vienna- Polak was inter alia the husband of 
Kafka's Milena- in a dissertation entitled Kritik der 
Phănomenologie durch die Logik (Critique of pheno-
menology by means of logic, 1932). The science of 
phenomenology, according to Polak, "is logic (gram-
mar in the most general sense), clarification of what 
we mean when we speak; its results are tautologies; its 
findings not statements, but explications." 
Polak's work is clearly inspired by another Austrian 
phiJosopher, LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN, and more particu-
Jarly by the latter's Tractatus (1921). As is seen from 
Wittgenstein's own employment of the term "pheno-
menology," particularly around 1929, it is primarily 
in regard to the problem of the synthetic a priori -
of an "intermediary between logic and physics" -
that Husserl 's thinking is crucial to the development 
of that of Wittgenstein. Husserl 's account of the syn-
thetic a priori is indeed no less important to the work 
of Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle than is that of 
Kant, for where Kant sees the realm of the synthetic a 
priori as residing in the relatively restricted and cogni-
tively inaccessible sphere of transcendental conscious-
ness, Husserl claims that there is a directly accessible 

48 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
a priori dimension across the entire range of everyday 
experience ~ 
so that the family of propositions that 
are both synthetic and a priori turns out to be vastly 
greater on Husserl's view than on that of Kant. It in-
cludes not least such homely examples as "nothing can 
be both red and green ali over" ~an example to which 
Wittgenstein and the Vienna positivists devoted agreat 
deal oftheir attention. 
From the standpoint of the positivists, of course, 
synthetic a priori propositions do not and cannot ex-
ist: ali true propositions are either tautologies of logic 
or contingent truths relating to empirica! matters of 
fact. For Husserl, in contrast, as for the realistic phe-
nomenologists in Munich, there are entire disciplines 
of synthetic a priori truths, including the discipline of 
phenomenology itself, as well as a range of "regional 
ontologies" pertaining to mind, cui ture, animate nature, 
and the spatiotemporal world ofphysical things. 
As far as contemporary Austrian philosophers are 
concerned, phenomenology has been sorely neglected, 
though important work in the tradition of Bolzano, 
Brentano, and Meinong has been carried out, inter 
alia, by Johannes Brandl, Reinhard Fabian, Rudolf 
Haller, Johannes Marek, Edgar Morscher, and Peter Si-
mons. The work on Austrian philosophy of Roderick 
Chisholm must also be mentioned in this connection, as 
must work in the Austrian tradition in the newly freed 
countries of Eastern Europe on the part of thinkers

SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR 
Beauvoir shapes an 
account oflived experience that recognizes subjectivity 
and situation as radically irreducible, concrete, partic-
ular, and plural and that by means of this recognition 
moves EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY beyond impasses 
created by subtle, ongoing adherence to impersonal and 
falsely universalizing forms ofphilosophy. Beauvoir's 
critique of myth -
whereby once a single myth is 
touched, aii myths are in dan ger- shows that nothing, 
not even the most commonplace ofbeliefs, is essential 
or natural, and in so doing liberates a dynamic sense 
of becoming through which we take up our lives. Her 
insistence that it is in the knowledge ofthe conditions 
of our lives, in their ambiguity and multiplicity, that 
we draw our strength to live and our reasons for act-
ing, makes women and groups marginalized by much 
of philosophy emergc as a topic of discourse in pheno-
menology. 
Beauvoir was born in Paris, January 2, 1908, 
the daughter of Fran~oise Brasseur de Beauvoir and 
Georges de Beauvoir. She studied philosophy at the 
Sorbonne. After completing the agn?gation in 1931, 
she taught philosophy in Marseilles, Rouen, and Paris. 
During the German occupation of France her relation-
ship with Natalie Sorokine resulted in her teaching con-
tract being tenninated, and in 1944 Beauvoir decided 
to become a full-time writer. With JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, and others, Beauvoir co-
founded the journal Les Temps Modernes in 1945. She 
traveled widely and was particularly affected by her 
visits to China, the Soviet Un ion, Cuba, and the United 
States. She took part in numerous politica! demonstra-
tions, among which were the opposition to the German 
occupation of France, to French colonial rulc in Alge-
ria, to the war in Vietnam, and to sexism in women 's 
lives. Her work inspired in great part the second wave 
of FEMil\ISM. Beauvoir died in Paris, on April21, 1986. 
In keeping with Beauvoir's belief that it is good 
for thoughts to be shaped by experience, as well as 
with the notion that existential phenomenology is not 
primarily a matter of intertextual reading, but of re-
flection on experience in interaction with the persons, 
ideas, values, groups, institutions, etc., around us, her 
phenomenology grew significantly out of her friend-
ships. In this regard there should be noted her con-
versations with Sartre, her lifelong companion since 
their initial meeting in 1929: with Sylvie Le Bon, 
who met Beauvoir in 1960 and who, Beauvoir re-
ports, was thoroughly interwoven in her life by 1964 
and remained so up to the time of Beauvoir's death; 
and with Beauvoir's friends among whom, at vari-
ous times in her lifc, may be counted Elizabeth Le 
Coin ("Zaza" in Beauvoir's work); Helene de Beau-
voir, her sister ("Poupette" in Beauvoir 's writings ); 
Estepha Gerassi ("Stepha"): Jose Le Core; Maurice 
Merleau-Ponty (sometimes "Pradelle" in Beauvoir's 
books); Colette Audry: Jacques-Laurent Bost; Violette 
Leduc; Nelson Algren; and Richard Wright. 
Beauvoir wrote a vast array of philosophical, liter-
ary, and politica] works, as well as letters and note-
books, Lettres a Sartre ( 1990), Journal de guerre 
( 1990), which are now beginning to be published and 
will ha ve much impact on current understanding ofher 
work and of French phenomenology. L 'Amerique au 
jour le jour ( 1948) chronicles her trips to the United 
States and her encounters with Algren and Wright. ln-
terestingly, Beauvoir was the only European pheno-
menologist of her time actively to connect her de-
scriptive thought with ideas and events in the United 
States. Her memoirs document the evolution of her 
ideas and the origins and development of phenomen-
ology in FRANCE in vi vid detail. Memoires d'unejeune 
fi/le rangee ( 1958) contains compelling descriptions 
of her relationship with Zaza, her childhood friend, as 
well as discussions of her rejection of religion and of 
the family as an institution. La forcr: de l'âge ( 1960) 
brings forth Beauvoir's encounter with EXISTENTIAL-
ISM, her life with Jean-Paul Sartre, and her own pro-
cess ofbecoming a writer. Laforce des choses (1963) 
highlights her life during the prewar and war years; 
Tout comptefait ( 1972) marks her relation with Sylvie 
de Bon and moves from the war to the late 1960s; La 
ceremonie des adieux ( 1981) traces the years preced ing 
the death of Sartre. Une morttres douce ( 1964 ), which 
Le Bon encouraged Beauvoir to write upon the death 
of Beauvoir's mother, may well be one of her most

enduring essays. Among her highly acclaimed literary 
works are L 'invitee ( 1943 ); Le sang des autres ( 1945); 
Tous les hommes sont mortels ( 1946); Les mandarins 
(1954), which she considered her best literary resolu-
tion of the problem of the Other and which received 
the Prix Goncourt; Les belles images ( 1966); and La 
femme rompue (1967). 
Beauvoir's best known theorctical works are Pour 
une morale de l 'ambiguite ( 1947), Le deuxil?me sexe 
( 1949) and La vieillesse ( 1970). Le deuxieme Sexe was 
an immediate success in France, with the first vol-
ume selling 22,000 copies in the first week, June 4-9, 
and the second volume selling just as many copies, 
November 4-9. The cover of Paris Match, in August 
ofthat year, featured her photo and the statement that 
she was the first woman philosopher in the history of 
"man." With the appearance of the second volume, in 
which Beauvoir discusses the young gir!, marriage, the 
mother, the lesbian, prostitutes, and hetairas, she be-
came not only the center of controversy, but the object 
ofrudeness and harassment as she was hounded out of 
cafes and the routine ofher daily life was disrupted. 
The devastating rise of Nazism in Germany and 
the Civil War in Spain shattered the lives of Beauvoir 
and her friends. When they found themselves again, re-
bom and radically different, the world around them had 
changed. This change, for Beauvoir, was marked by an 
awareness ofthe multiple implications ofthe historical 
moment. Thus when Beauvoir, like Sartre and Merleau-
Ponty, criticized the philosophies prevalent during their 
time- in particular, NATURALISM, PSYCHOANALYSIS, 
and MARXISM -
her critique, and with that, her exis-
tential phenomenology, was distinguished by its spe-
cific awareness of humanity not as a natural, but as a 
historical phenomenon. Naturalistic explanations, she 
argues, are inadequate insofar as nothing that happens 
to a person is ever natural. For instance, although hu-
man reproduction is founded on biology, it does not 
necessitate sexual differentiation, and old age is not 
exclusively a biologica! fact, but partakes of history. 
Psychoanalysis posits humans not as natural objects, 
but as subjects, or lived bodies. Yet the psychoanalyti-
cal criterion ofnormalcy, considered by Beauvoir tobe 
identica! to essentialist and prescriptive social custom, 
gives rise to an inauthentic picture of humanity. She 
claims that Sigmund Freud offers a masculine model 
that mistakenly assumes that sexuality is a given and 
fails to account for the origin ofmale supremacy. Any-
one who wants to work on women, Beauvoir writes, 
has to break completely with Freud. Historical materi-
alism brings to phenomenological analysis the recog-
nition that humanity makes itse1f what it is according 
to its material possibilities. A woman is defined not 
exclusively by her sexuality, but also by the economic 
organization ofthe society in which she lives. Beauvoir 
maintains, however, that historica1 materialism rejects 
the concept of choice and therefore views the subject 
as monolithic and passive. It reduces women to the ca-
pacity for labor and does not consider women 's work 
in reproduction and childcare seriously. 
Beauvoir was recognized early in her philosophi-
cal studics as an expert on Leibniz, whose philosophy 
she !ater carne to find dull. HEGEL's phenomenology 
and logic were influential on her work, as they were 
on that of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. She often com-
ments on the Hegelian sense ofbeing and describes "to 
be a woman" as an instance of the dynamic Hegelian 
sense of the verb "to be," that is, a "to ha ve become" 
in which the question is: should that state of affairs 
continue? She finds a basis for social philosophy in 
Hege1ian representations of thc necd for a reciproca! 
recognition of consciousnesses. Yet in January 1941, 
upon discovering herself delivered from an undue op-
timism, Beauvoir rejects the optimism of Hegel 's his-
torical infinite and its positing ofthe particular only as 
a moment of the totality in which it must surpass it-
self. Although she gathers support from Kierkegaard's 
opposition to Hegel, in which Kierkegaard affirms the 
irreducible character of ambiguity, she considers his 
tales of the aloneness of the individual a subjective 
game of no use in the creation of authentic re1ations 
among people. 
Beauvoir read widely the work of her contempo-
raries and developed aspects of her existential pheno-
meno1ogy out of that dialogue. She found fruitful 
CI aude Levi-Strauss's conception ofthe mark of other-
ness, which arises in the exchange ofwomen by men, 
among men, in marriage. MAX SCHELER 's account of 
ressentiment she characterized as very weak, and EM-
MANUEL LEVINAS's account ofthe feminine as the full 
flower of otherness, absolutely other and in meaning 
opposite to consciousness, she termed an assertion of 
masculine privilege. 
During the academic year 1932-33, Beauvoir, al-

SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR 
51 
ready familiar with Husserl due to her conversations 
with Fernando Gerassi, who had studied with ED-
MUND HUSSERL and had been a classmate of Sartre in 
Berlin, became extremely interested in Husserl 's work. 
This interest, sparked by a con versation with Raymond 
Aron concern ing Husserl 's approach to philosophy, led 
to her detailed study, in 1934, of Husserl's Vor!esun-
gen zur Phănomeno!ogie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins 
[ 1905] and to her translation of sections ofthat work for 
Sartre, who had read Husserl's work while on leave at 
the French Institute in Berlin during the spring of 1933. 
Beauvoir describes herself, in Laforce de l 'âge, as ini-
tially being fi !led with enthusiasm by the richness and 
novelty of Husserl 's phenomenology. Of particular in-
terest is Beauvoir 's thematization of Husserl 's EPOCHE 
ANO REDUCTION in Pour une morale de 1 'ambiguite. 
There she compares the epoche to existential conver-
sion: Jet a person put the will in parentheses and that 
person will come to an awareness ofthe genuine con-
ditions ofher life. Just as the phenomenological reduc-
tion prevents the errors of dogmatism by suspending 
all affinnation concerning the mode of reality of the 
externa! world- whose existence it does not contest 
-
existentialist conversion does not suppress a per-
son 's instincts, plans, and passions. It merely refuses 
to set them up as absolutes and considers them in their 
connection with the freedom that projects them. 
Beauvoir read MARTIN HEIDEGGER first in 1936, 
when she translated long sections of Sein und Zeit 
( 1927) for Sartre to read, and then again more thor-
oughly in 1939. She refers positive1y to Heidegger's 
account ofthe future as bound up with the present and 
she contrasts that with the dream future posited by re-
ligion and with the tyrant's trick, which encloses a per-
son in the facticity of the present. Yet she experiences 
human life not as a gradual being-toward-death, but as 
an unstable system in which balance is continually lost 
and continually recovered, in which change is the law 
of life. The analysis of the tool, given in Le deuxieme 
sexe, vividly distinguishes her existential phenomen-
ology from that of Heidegger. There Beauvoir details 
the life ofthe married woman as one of endless repeti-
tion, washing, ironing, sweeping, ferreting out rolls of 
lint from under wardrobes, and whose high point may 
be the preparation of food and getting meals, work 
that means marketing, often the bright spot of the day, 
gossip on doorsteps while peeling vegetables, etc. The 
WORLD, Beauvoir claims, when considered from the 
perspective of a concrete and particular context, does 
not seem to women an assemblage ofimplements inter-
mediate between her will and her goals, as Heidegger 
defines it; it is on the contrary something obstinately 
resistant, unconquerable. Woman comes to grips not 
with matter, but with life, and life cannot be mastered 
through the use ofTECHNOLOGY. 
Between Sartre and Beauvoir there are major in-
fluences ofvaried sorts. These influences are currently 
being re-evaluated in order tobe more accurately deter-
mined. For instance, despite her assertions to the con-
trary, it is now apparent that Sartre had read L 'invitee 
by the first week of February 1940, significantly prior 
to his completion of L 'etre et le neant ( 1943 ), and 
Sartre 's theoretical impasse at combining his belief in 
absolute freedom with collectivity and history was not 
broken until after the initial publication of Le deuxieme 
sexe in Les Temps Modernes in 1948. The divergences 
between the existential phenomenologies of Beauvoir 
and Sartre are especially evident in regard to their re-
spective representations ofvoluntarism, of oppression 
and HISTORY, and of nature. While nature in Sartre's 
work appears as mere facticity, 1 'etre-en-soi, nature for 
Beauvoir is to be considered in relationship with hu-
man being. Such a relationship forms one of the rare 
contexts in which woman is no longer mother, wife, 
housekeeper, but a human being, in which woman re-
members that she is an irreducible free individual and 
Iives not for others, but for herself. The freedom pro-
posed by Beauvoir is individualistic, but not solipsistic. 
Each individual is defined only by relationship to the 
world and to other individuals; one's freedom is made 
by reaching out toward the freedom of others. 
From Merleau-Ponty Beauvoir draws an under-
standing of the BODY as historical process. Yet as she 
comments, to say "a body is nota thing, it is a situation 
in itself," has no significance; rather, this body has this 
or that particular structure. For instance, she writes that 
woman, like man, is her body and that woman 's body 
is something other than herself. Over the years Beau-
voir and Merleau-Ponty grew further apart, separated 
by their views ofRELIGION, women's right to abortion, 
and family. 
Lived experience, Beauvoir relates, was a form of 
consciousness she first became aware of from her re-
fusal, as a child, to fit whatever she beheld with her 

52 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
own eyes into a rigid category, and from her desire 
to express neutra! tints, muted shades, and the gap 
between word and object. Her descriptions oflived ex-
perience are inseparable from her literary reading, and 
in particular, from the writing of Kafka, Lawrence, 
Woolf, Hemingway, Dos Passos, Faulkner, and Joyce. 
In the section "L'etre-dans-le-monde" of La vieillesse 
(Old age, 1970), Beauvoir comes to a definition of 
lived experience as the inward experience of a sub-
ject, the inwardly experienced meaning of our being-
in-the-world. Lived experience can be communicated 
from the standpoint of each individual's uniqueness 
but, Beauvoir maintains, it cannot be known as a uni-
versal philosophical concept. The body- that is, our 
awareness of ourselves as particular, concrete, and em-
bodied individuals-may offer a way ofunderstanding 
lived experience, but it has no mcaning apart from the 
relations that shape its context, or situation. 
In Le deuxieme sexe, when Beauvoir writes her per-
haps best known and most controversial statement, "On 
ne naÎt pasfemme: on le devient" [ one is not born a 
woman: one becomes one], she attacks the myth of 
woman, a transcendent idea that defies 1 ived experience 
and robs individuals of their self-defined projects and 
goals. Woman is a cultural formation that is imposed 
on females by the intervention of others in her destiny. 
Woman finds herself living in a world where man rep-
resents both the positive and the neutra!, where she is 
defined relative to man and as the negative, where man 
is the subject, the absolute, and she is the Other. More-
over, Beauvoir observes, just as woman is not deter-
mined by biology, psychology, or economic fate, sex-
uality is in no way determined by matters of anatom-
ical or psychological disposition. Thus for Beauvoir's 
phenomenology there is no natural or necessary linkage 
between biologica! features, gender, and sexuality, be-
tween women or men, or heterosexuality or homosex-
uality, or femininity or masculinity. There are myriad 
possibilities for us to take up and give shape through 
our being in the world. Yet for Beauvoir, woman is not 
the only Other. She cites, in La vieil/esse, the bourgeois 
myths of affiuence that hide the experience of old age. 
The awareness gained from analyses oflived experi-
ences was not, for Beauvoir, to bc relegated to a world 
of ideas, but was for the purpose of social change: 
she signed the Manifeste des 343 and participated in 
the French feminist campaign for free abortion. She 
publicly testified for Djamila Boupacha, a young Al-
gerian woman illegally imprisoned by French military 
forces and tortured in 1960. In 1972 she named herself 
a militant feminist and joined the women 's liberation 
movement. She worked to actualize a partial response 
to her question, who cares for the aged? 
Beauvoir's phenomenology needs tobe read in its 
entirety and studied, that is, it needs to rcceive the 
appropriate scholarly attention. Although there are se-
rious obstacles to studying her phenomenology, these 
can be overcome. First, the English translation of Le 
deuxieme sexe, the text from which the translations 
into other languages have been made, suffers from 
the deletion, arbitrary and unindicated, by the trans-
lator (H. M. Parshley), of more than ten percent of 
the original. Margaret Simons has shown that the text 
has many wrong translations and the translator has of-
ten rendered inaccurately and ignored altogether Beau-
voir's precise use ofphenomenological terms. Second, 
Jo Ann Pilardi has shown that philosophers, including 
those in Continental philosophy, have with very few 
exceptions not even mentioned Beauvoir, and in the 
few cases where mention has been made, it is often 
woefully inaccurate. Beauvoir herself has not always 
facilitated accurate study ofher work. She imposed ma-
jor restrictions on interviewers, biographers, and those 
close to her who considered theorizing about her life, 
work, and influence. Such restrictions, accompanied 
by Beauvoir's frequent knowing misrepresentation of 
information, ha ve led in her memoirs and interviews to 
the creati an of a fiction. It is interesting, though, that 
so many writers and readers ha ve chosen not simply to 
represent, but to embellish that fiction. In this context, 
it is important to keep in mind Beauvoir's experience 
ofthe reception ofher ideas during her lifetime. 
To date, new directions in the study of Beauvoir's 
phenomenology are indicated by feminist scholars, in-
cluding feminist philosophers, many ofwhom are re-
evaluating her work. Further new directions are emerg-
ing as her notebooks are transcribed and her journals, 
letters, and other manuscripts published. The disrup-
tive potential ofthese materials promises to bring about 
dramatic shifts in understanding Beauvoir's work in 
particular and French phenomenology in general.

BEHAVIORAL GEOGRAPHY 
As an academic 
discipline, geography is the study of the earth as the 
dwelling place of human beings. Behavioral geogra-
phy is one important subfield of the discipline and 
examines the role ofhuman behavior, experience, and 
meaning in understanding people's relationship with 
environments, places, and landscapes. SOCIAL GEOG-
RAPHY is another subfield. In that severa! other dis-
ciplines and professions are also concerned with the 
people-environment relationship at varying geograph-
ical scales, research in behavioral geography is often 
interdisciplinary and linked with other areas of ex-
pertise that include ECOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY, 
environment-behavior research, ARCHITECTURE, land-
scape architecture, and community and regional plan-
ning. 
Research in behavioral geography first arose in the 
early 1960s as an alternative to the normative, econom-
ically rational approaches used by geographers to ex-
amine the distribution and pattern of human activities 
in relation to space and environment. This early behav-
ioral work was positivist in approach and emphasized 
such topics as environmental perception, spatial cogni-
tion and leaming, territoriality, and environmental and 
landscape preferences. By the early 1970s, however, 
some behavioral geographers sought an alternative to 
the dominant positivist tradition and turned to interpre-
ti ve philosophical traditions like HERMENEUTICS and 
EXISTENTIALISM as a way conceptually to explore hu-
man experience, meaning, and values as the essential 
foundation for understanding human behavior and ac-
tion in the geographical world. 
Since 1970, when EDWARD C. RELPH published the 
first article on the topic in a scholarly geographic jour-
nal, phenomenology has contributed significantly to 
behavioral geography, both conceptually and method-
ologically. Although there has been considerable the-
oretical debate by such figures as JOHN PICKLES and 
BENNO WERLEN as to what phenomenology can best 
offer to behavioral geography and related interdisci-
plinary work, most of the research has moved away 
from Husserl's CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY and 
has drawn instead on the tradition of EXISTENTIAL 
PHENOMENOLOGY pointed to by MARTIN HEIDEGGER 
and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY. 
In broadest terms, this phenomenological research 
has sought to understand human awareness and action 
as they both create and are created by such geographi-
cal qualities as place, SPACE, nature, landscape, home, 
journey, region, dwelling, and the built environment. 
Perhaps the fundamental topic is the geographicallife-
world- the taken-for-granted meanings, experiences, 
behaviors, and events in relation to environment, space, 
place, and landscape. How, for example, do qualities 
of the natural and built environments give and have

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
meaning in people's lives? How do human beings or-
ganize their existence in space? What is a sense of place 
and how does it vary among geographical locations? 
What qualities of landscape and physical environment 
infuse a physical space with a sense of place? Re-
search on the geographicallifeworld can be described 
in terms of two interrelated themes: ( 1) a phenomen-
ology of environmental behavior and experience and 
(2) a phenomenology of geographical being-in-world. 
Each ofthese topics is discussed in turn. 
The phenomenology of environmental behavior and 
experience considers the ways in which human beings 
reach out, make contact with, and behave in a world that 
is, in part, geographical. One phenomenological focus 
is the ways in which our existence as bodily beings 
contributes to our experience of space and place. First 
of ali, we are solid bodies, which means we are more 
or less fixed in size and shape. Our solid body also 
gives a sense of centeredness to the space in which 
we li ve and -~in conjunction with binocular vision-
orients us within a sixfold directionat axis ofup-down, 
front-back, and left-right. 
Beyond bodily structure as lived, there is also a 
phenomenological interest in the pre-reflective but 
]earned INTENTIONALITY of the BODY, which through 
Merleau-Ponty's Phenonz(mologie de la perception 
( 1945) has come tobe called body-su~ject- the pre-
conscious intelligence ofthe body manifested through 
ACTION. Phenomenological work on the body-subject 
in behavioral geography argues that the body-subject 
is the bedrock of the habitual, routine aspects of life 
in the world and indicates why a large portion of the 
person 's typical day can proceed automatically without 
a major amount of conscious attention. 
For behavioral geographers, the most significant as-
pect of the body-subject is its automatic, taken-for-
granted ability to work in extended ways over TIME 
and SPACE, and researchers accordingly ask how rou-
tine behaviors of individuals coming together regularly 
in space can transform that space into a place with a 
particular dynamic and character. A related research 
question is how qualities of the physical environment 
and design can isolate people or bring them together in 
place. 
Another dimension of environmental experience ex-
amined by phenomenological behavioral geography is 
the sensible environment that the fi ve senses encounter 
and interpret. USA HERSCHONG, for example, uses the 
four descriptive themes of necessity, delight, affection, 
and sacredness to delimit aspects of a phenomenology 
of the thermal environment. Another example is R. 
MURRAY SCHAFER, who considers the experience of 
the sonic environment, or soundscape as he calls it. He 
develops a series of concepts, notations, and exercises 
that work to foster sensitization in terms of listening 
and hearing. 
The phenomenology of geographical being-in-
world recognizes the indissoluble unity between person 
and world, or being-in-world, a phrasing that serves to 
emphasize a sense of immersion and integral person-
world fus ion. Phcnomenological efforts to maintain the 
wholeness of geographical and environmental being-
in-world include research focusing on the emotional 
bonds between people and place- for example, feel-
ings of care, sentiment, warmth, or love. YI-FU TUAN 
speaks of topophilia as "ali of the human being's af-
fective ties with the material environment." Other re-
searchers, such as BELDEN LANE, drawing on themes 
from the phenomenology of RELIGION and spiritual 
experience, link emotional involvement with place to 
impulses of sacredness and geopiety. 
One of the most comprehensive efforts to describe 
geographical being-in-world is ERIC DARDEL's discus-
sion of geographicite, or geographicality -
a term 
he coins to describe the taken-for-granted spatial and 
environmental context in which people live, i.e., "the 
distinctive relationship that binds man to the earth ... 
his way of existence and his fate." Dardel defines geo-
graphicality in terms of three interrelated dimensions: 
lived space, landscape, and place. Lived space refers 
to space as experienced and has a close relationship to 
the bodily dimensions of the geographical lifeworld. 
Lived space is not an empty void to which qualities 
and meanings are arbitrarily assigned, but rather a nec-
essary and significant context for ali human experience 
and action. For OTTO BOLLNOW, each person has a "nat-
ural place" to which he or she belongs, and only this 
place "can properly be called the zero point of his [ or 
her] reference system." Typically, this natural place is 
the home, which is part of a larger set of familiar places 
and routes that together comprise the taken-for-granted 
spatial context ofthe geographicallifeworld. 
O ardei also spcaks of landscape, by which he means 
the physical environment that provides the material 

BEHAVIORAL GEOGRAPHY 
55 
base for a particular Iifeworld. He identifies fi ve inter-
related components of Iandscape: ( 1) material space, 
the general, Iarge-scale physiognomy of an environ-
ment that makes it welcoming or threatening for hu-
man Iiving; (2) tel!uric space, the sense of Iandscape 
related to qualities of geology and topography; (3) 
aquatic space, the ways that water is present and con-
tributes to Iandscape character; ( 4) the space of air, the 
realm of atmosphere, weather, and climate and their 
roles in contributing to the sense of Iandscape; and 
(5) constructed space, the human-made elements of 
Iandscape and their contributions to Iandscape charac-
ter. One phenomenological aim is to understand how 
constructed space might arise from and contribute to 
the other four dimensions of landscape, particularly 
in terms of quality of Iife and ecologica! viability. 
Another, more recent effort to establish a phenomen-
ology oflandscape is the work ofCHRISTIAN NORBERG-
SCHULZ, who argues for the existence of genius loci-
the spirit of place. He contends that the foundation of 
genius loci is the natural environment, or natural place, 
as he ca Ils it. Natural place is "nota mere flux of phe-
nomena," but "has structure and embodies meanings." 
To identify particular types of natural places, 
Norberg-Schulz draws on five environmental dimen-
sions: thing, orde1; characte1; light, and time. Thing and 
order refer to the spatial qualitics of Iandscape, while 
character and Iight relate to overaii quality and atmo-
sphere. Time involves both constancy and change in 
the Iandscape as related to daily and seasonal rhythms 
ofweather, climate, vegetation, and so forth. 
Norberg-Schulz argues that combinations of these 
fi ve dimensions Iead to four types of natural places and 
a corresponding range of genius loci: romantic land-
scapes, cosmic landscapes, classical landscapes, and 
complex landscapes. The romantic Iandscape, for ex-
ample, involves change, diversity, and detail, and is 
best characterized by the Scandinavian forests, which 
are distinguished by "an interminable multitude ofphe-
nomena." In considerable contrast is the cosmic land-
scape, an environment of continuity and extension best 
exemplified by the desert, where "the complexities of 
our concrete Iifeworld are reduced to a few simple 
phenomena." 
One of the most innovative efforts to interpret 
geographical being-in-world phenomenologicaiiy is 
Relph 's effort to establish a phenomenology of place, 
which is Dardel's third element of geographicality. 
Relph defines places as "fusions of human and natural 
order ... and the significant centres of our immediate 
experiences of the world." He argues that the experi-
enced crux of place is insideness-the degree to which 
people belong to and identify themselves with place. 
He suggests that the relationship between insideness 
and its experienced opposite, outsideness, is a funda-
mental dialectic of human environmental experience 
and behavior. 
Through different degrees of insideness and out-
sideness, different places take on different identities 
for diffcrent people, and human experience takes on 
different qualities ofmeaning and feei ing. What Relph 
caiis existential outsideness, for example, involves a 
strong sense of alienation, such as the strangeness and 
separation that a newcomer to a foreign country often 
feels. In contrast, existential insideness is a situation 
of unselfconscious immersion in place; it is the expe-
rience of place that most people know when they are 
in their own community or region. Existential inside-
ness is the foundation of the concept of place, which, 
for the existential insider, "is experienced without de-
Iiberate and self-conscious reflection yet is full with 
significances." In designing and setting policy for mak-
ing places where people wiii feei comfortable and at 
home, existential insideness should bea main concern. 
A key applied question is how elements of the natu-
ral and built environment can contribute to fostering 
existential insideness. 
The geographical LIFEWORLD clearly has Iinks with 
other aspects of the Iifeworld -
its psychological, 
social, economic, and politica! dimensions -
and 
in this sense, research in phenomenological behav-
ioral geography should eventuaiiy be integrated into 
the Iarger phenomenological literature. Too often, per-
haps, philosophers and human scientists ignore the ge-
ographical Iifeworld, even though spaces, Iandscapes. 
places, and built environments are an integral part of 
human Iife and contribute to people's sense ofidentity 
and well-being. Recent work by EDWARD CASEY is an 
encouraging sign. 
With the rise of POST-MODERNISM in the Iast severa! 
years, a growing rift has developed between pheno-
menological researchers- who continue to empha-
size underlying, generalizable aspects of place, envi-
ronmental experience, and geographical world- and 

56

postructuralist thinkers who emphasize relativist and 
continually shifting environmental meanings and ac-
tions. Whether these two perspectives can establish 
dialogue and areas of common ground is a question 
that presently has no clear answer, though Paul Cloke, 
Chris Philo, and David Sadler (1991) see commonality 
in both phenomenological and post-modern efforts to 
use research findings as one means to improve partic-
ular places and the Iifeworlds of particular individuals 
and groups.

HENRI BERGSON 
Born of Jewish parents in 
Paris in 1859, Bergson graduated from the Ecole Nor-
male Superieure in 1881, after which he was appointed 
professor of philosophy at the lycee of Clermont-
Ferrand in 1883. He moved back to Paris in 1888 
to teach at three other lycees. He had published the 
Essai sur les donm?es immediates de la conscience 
(Essay on the immediate data of consciuosness, his 
doctoral thesis) in 1889, and Matiere et memoire (Mat-
ter and memory) followed in 1896. In 1898 he became 
Maître de Conference at the Ecole Normale. In 1900 
he was awarded a chair at the College de France, and 
in the following year he was elected member of the 
Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. In 1907 
he published L 'evolution creatrice (Creative evolu-
tion), which brought him an international reputation. In 
1914 Bergson was elected to the Academie Fran(ţaise, 
but in the same year, presumably because ofhis popu-
larity among Catholic modernists, his works were put 
on the Index of prohibited books by the Holy Office. 
A series of essays dealing with the mind-body prob-
lem, written from 1900 to 1914, appeared under the 
ti tie L 'energie spirituelle in 1919. In 1922, he engaged 
Albert Einstein in a series of discussions concerning 
the status oftime in the theory ofrelativity. In 1927 he 
received the Nobel Prize for literature. His last major 
work, Les deux sources de la morale et de la religion, 
appeared in 1932. He died in 1941. 
At the Bergson Centenary Congress in 1959, RO-
MAN INGARDEN recalled that when in 1917 he recon-
structed for EDMUND HUSSERL Bergson 's description 
of pure duration, Husserl, who never met Bergson, lis-
tened attentively and exclaimed: "This is precisely as if

l were Bergson." Similarly, when ALEXANDRE KOYRE 
brought word ofBergson 's philosophy to the Gottingen 
Ci rele in 1911, Husserl is reported to ha ve said: "Wc 
are the true Bergsonians." 
Husserl formulates his "principle of principles" in 
§ 24 of ldeen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913), according 
to which the only legitimate source of authority for 
knowledge is provided by firsthand intuiting. Intuition 
is the operation through which consciousness finds the 
plenitude or fullncss of MEANING, a persistence that is 
absent in mental images because the latter, being un-
regimented and evanescent, can remain unfulfilled by 
any intuition. This position is echoed in Bergson 'sem-
phasis on the immediate data of consciousness in his 
first book of 1889. Yet there are fundamental differ-
ences. Bergson was committed to a metaphysical use 
of intuition, which is explicitly rejected by Husserl. 
Moreover, Husserl's employment ofEIDETIC METHOD, 
based on the critique of PSYCHOLOGISM in the founda-
tions of LOGIC, would seem far removed from Berg-
son 's anti-intellectualism and his hostility to the ana-
lytic approach. Bergson himselfwould certainly repu-
diate the Husserlian intuition of essences, because of 
the affinities it has- as many early critics of Husserl 
were quick to point out- with a form of Platonism. 
According to Bergson, no stable philosophical system 
could ever exist, because it is exceeded by the very 
intuition that gives life to it. Philosophy is thus com-
pelled to abandon the intuition that it seeks to capturc 
and describe. 
If intuition could be prolonged at will, the philoso-
pher would not only be in agreemcnt with his or her 
own thought, but ali philosophers would immediately 
agree with it as well. The aim of ali dialectica! sys-
tems is precisely to restore a universal agreement of 
this kind, which, however, is impossible from the out-
set because the same effort whereby we connect ideas 
with one another is responsible for the vanishing of 
intuition. Consequently, there have been and always 
will be many dialectica! systems contradicting one an-
other. In order to reach o ne truth, we need a continuous 
back-and-forth motion between mind and nature; this 
enterprise is itself hampered by our continuai inter-
es! in the usefulness of a present ACTION. Thus even 
though they both take intuition as the ultimate touch-
stone of sense, Bergson 's reference to o ne truth differs 
from Husserl 's recognition ofthe existence of different 
kinds of intuition corresponding to different kinds of 
essences. 
On the other hand, Bergson 's starting point in 
Matiere et memoire is an original philosophical point 
against associationism, which is not dissimilar to 
Husserl 's stance. A dominant theory of the 19th cen-
tury, associationism had already begun to come un-
der serious attack on the part of psychologists in the 
1880s. Bergson 's motive is to preserve the spontaneity 
and fluidity of mental life. His argument is directed 
against what he ca lis the "capital error" of Humean as-
sociationism, namely, its juxtaposition of atomic fixed 
psychic states that have no cognitive complexity or 
life. For when images and memories are understood 
as weak perccptions that are mechanically associated, 
the process has been absorbed into the produc!, and 
the fluidity of mental life is lost. There is therefore 
no way of explaining the transformation of perception 
into image and back again that Bergson posits. The 
associationists claim that a true sensation would differ 
from the image by virtue of its greater intensity: this 
would account for its exteriority. But in order to pass 
from memory as such to perception as such, a leap is 
needed ata certain time. The transformation must take 
place at a certain moment, yet associationism cannot 
give any reason why this happens at one moment rather 
than another. 
Images in the bodily sense include ali reality. Berg-
son does not claim that PERCEPTION deals with mere 
appearances that represent actual beings behind them. 
On the contrary, matter understood as the assemblage 
of images is ali there is. Nor are these things images 
insofar as they are perceived and imagined in the per-
ceiving consciousness; in fact, they fully remain im-
ages even when they are unperceived. Thus perception 
does not take place in us; through perception we are 
carried into the world, so that it occurs at the object, 
where it seems tobe. Consequently, the difference be-
tween being and being-perceived is not in the nature of 
things but only a difference of degree. Consciousness 
has no definite correlate; it is simply a character of ali 
reality, which is sometimes actual, sometimes virtual. 
To be sure, this account leaves no room for any sense 
of self-consciousness. But on the other hand, thc ideal 
of objective knowledge closed upon itself is also do ne 
away with. Following Berkeley, Bergson rehabilitates 

58 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the secondary qualities, so much so that the degree zero 
ofthese qualities remains the index ofreality: when the 
material world is given, a set of images is also given, 
which we can never give up. 
This critique leads Bergson to a position very close 
to what will become, in Husserl 's terms, the transcen-
dental EPOCHE AND REDUCTION ofthe natura] attitude. 
Right at the beginning of Matiere et memoire, Bergson 
asks us to suspend our belief in any of the theories of 
matter and spirit. This enables him to rediscover the 
irreducible prerogatives ofthe image ofthe BODY over 
ali the other images. He distinguishes between percep-
tions of images from without and affections ofthe body 
from within. Whereas perceptions are regulated by the 
deterministic Jaws ofnature, according to which the fu-
ture is entirely deployable from the present, affections 
lack absolute determination and therefore add some-
thing new at each instant ofthe history ofthe uni verse. 
Bergson goes on to proceed to a second reduction, 
in which he cuts asunder, in thought, ali the afferent 
nerves of the brain. Because perception has vanished, 
while the whole of the uni verse has not changed, the 
perception of material objects can be defined as images 
referred to the possible actions ofmy body. Already in 
his early work, Donnees immediates, Bergson distin-
guished the surface EGO from the deep ego. The former 
is caught in the anonymity of what Husserl calls the 
natural attitude because it sees itself in space, whereas 
the latter is wrenched from spatialized time and lives in 
conformity with time as pure quality ( duration). What, 
then, do we do with our spatially localized brain? 
No material phenomenon (such as cerebral modifi-
cation) could be coextensive with the infinite extent of 
a state of mind. The most exhaustive anatomy of the 
central nervous system will never account for the inex-
haustibility ofthe most humble spiritual fact. Bergson 
does not simply abolish ali systems that postulate an 
equivalence between the mental (cerebral) and the con-
scious, that is, ali "centripetal" psychological or meta-
physical systems that proceed from the outside to the 
inside, from the body to the mind. Rather, he literally 
puts them out of play; because he believes that such 
a centripetal movement exists, but it has to be rein-
terpreted in terms of part and whole. The empiricist's 
prejudice rests on the conflation between perception 
and MEMORY: it !ies in the belief that the gray matter 
is self-sufficient, as ifthe whole world were contained 
in the mind as representation. Such a relation exists 
only in the unconscious, because our character, always 
present in ali our decisions, is the actual synthesis of 
al! our past states. It is thus only in this case of mem-
ory, not perception, that the whole can be said to be 
condensed into a part. The brain is merely, as Bergson 
puts it, a "central telephone exchange," or an "organ 
ofpantomime" that mimics, but does not produce, the 
life of the mind. lts ro le is limited to postponing the 
response to an externa! stimulus, whereby it is finally 
extended into a bodily movement. The delay accounts 
for the indeterminacy of our behavior, the basic irres-
olution of my will. The brain is essentially a power of 
abstaining, not willing, whichjustifies Bergson's own 
original suspension of belief in the current theories of 
physics and psychology. 
Furthermore, when Bergson deals with cerebral le-
sions, he comes very close to dealing with them as 
eidetic variations. The phenomenon ofrecollection re-
veals its essence through partial lesions. The alleged 
destruction of recollections by means of such Jesions 
only means an interruption of the continuous progress 
whereby the recollection actualizes itself. Bergson 
cites psychological studies of aphasia (for example, 
the Joss of words in a certain fixed order) in support 
of his view that memory is not destroyed by local-
ized lesions; only the re-awakening of memories is 
affected, not the memories or images themselves. The 
brain merely acts an inhibitor, allowing only memo-
ries relevant to action to enter bodily perception. The 
lesion, which occurs in space, has thus the effect of 
slackening a function, which Bergson refers to as the 
"attention to life." Since the awakening itself is not 
essential to memory, its essence can be grasped and re-
tained by varying the degrees at which the awakening 
alone manifests itself. 
The motor element contained in memory can now 
be understood properly. If the mind were totally au-
tonomous, it would be impossible to understand how 
the slightest disturbance in sensorimotor equilibrium 
could produce deep perturbations of attention and 
memory. lf, on the other hand, the object begins by 
produc ing sensations mechanically, and the sensations 
produce the ideas concomitant with them, it is impos-
sible to understand how a purely mechanical process 
could change qualitatively. Perception is nota sensory 
vibration, but a problem awaiting resolution by means 

HENRIBERGSON 
59 
of motor activity. Thus when a perception occurs, it 
is automatically translated in terms of movements of 
imitation perfonned by the body. The actual function 
ofthe body is to generate a sketch, the detail and color 
ofwhich are re-created and enlivened thanks to the 
projection of more or less remote memories. As Berg-
son tells us in the introduction of Matiere et memoire, 
any complex thought, or chain of thoughts unrolled in 
time, generates images. The ro le ofthe brain is to draw 
the movements whereby these images could be acted or 
played in space. These are the possible movements of 
the body, which are thus never more than sketched out 
or prepared. In so doing, Bergson reverses the classical 
hierarchy ofpossibility and actuality. 
A possibility, or sketch, does not lead to any actu-
ality, but rather proceeds from it as its past. My past 
does not cease to exist when 1 cease to realize it, just 
as the objects of the world do not cease to exist when 
they are not present to my consciousness. The past has 
never ceased to be; it has only, but never completely, 
ceased to act. The representation of the past is condi-
tioned by my life force directed toward the future. My 
past is that which 1 must leave behind in order to act, 
and yet 1 am my past just as much as 1 am my body. 
The mind is neither the past nor the body, but it presup-
poses them as two limits within which its own effort 
operates. My past is what 1 am "in itself," whereas my 
present action adds a new sense to that which already 
was. Thus a possibility is ali there is in the present as 
action; it distinguishes itself from the pure memory of 
the past, which is contemplative, without object. The 
past, which is the only thing to exist actually "in it-
self," withdraws completely at each instant so as to 
leave room for a possibility existing now in action, a 
possibility that has never existed before. Later on, in 
L 'evolution creatice, Bergson wi\1 expand this meta-
physics of possibility into a biologica! philosophy by 
assigning to each living being the continuous creation 
of something absolutely irreducible to the sum total of 
past events. 
The deepest common ground between Bergson and 
Husserl is found in the inner consciousness of TIME 
and its unbroken flux. The experimental psychology 
that developed in the l9th century showed that in or-
der for consciousness to be accessible to experience, 
it must be located in the body. But consciousness does 
not by itself possess any limits; the localization in the 
body can be no more than a methodological require-
ment. How, within my own body's limits, can 1 be 
traversed by unlimitation? Bergson 's answer is that 
this is possible by means of duration. lf we listen to 
a single, continued tone, although the sensory charac-
teristics of the tone (pitch, timbre, intensity) remain 
the same, there is an undefinable and elusive change 
due to the simple fact that it endures. Its present phase 
differs from its antecedent phase by the mere fact of 
being older. Because the antecedent phase is stil! re-
membered, its present phase is novel, and therefore 
also richer. An immediate reco\lection accounts for the 
qualitative difference (a novelty) between the present 
and the past. In other words, the novelty ofthe present 
requires the persistence ofthe past as a necessary, con-
trasting background, but conversely, the pastness ofthe 
previous moment is impossible without the novelty of 
the present. The intuitive fact itself is characterized by 
an indivisible complexity; the static and discontinuous 
features suggested by the nouns "past," "present," and 
"moment" are merely artifacts of our inadequate lan-
guage. On the one hand, the former present acquires 
the character ofpastness by virtue ofthe emergence of 
a new present; buton the other hand, it was the passing 
of the former present (that is, the fact that the former 
present fades into the past) that brought forth a new and 
immediately subsequent moment. There is no novelty 
without immediate memory and vice versa. They are 
not two different facts, but one single process consid-
ered from two di fferent perspecti ves, prospectively and 
retrospectively-or protentionally and retentionally. 
Using Husserl 's Ianguage is quite in order at 
this point, since when Husserl is supposed to have 
exclaimed that phenomenologists are the consistent 
Bergsonians, he was referring to the fundamental 
points of his own Vorlesungen zur Phiinomenologie 
des inneren Zeitbewusstseins [ 1905]. According to 
Husserl, the special mode of givenness bound up with 
the duration of every experience is a certain abiding 
form that underlies the succession of the "now" and 
the 'just a moment ago." This form always has a dif-
ferent content because of ever new impressions. Even 
though I cannot take in ali ofthe experiential stream in 
one act of consciousness, 1 can grasp its unity, which 
is of such nature that no single experience can be inde-
pendent in the fu li sense. Through a reifying appercep-
tion, however, this immanent phenomenological time 

60 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
can be conceived of as "space-time." Indeed, because 
of the link with the body, consciousness retains an in-
direct relation to the time of nature as described in 
exact science, that is, the time measured by clocks. But 
immanent phenomenological time cannot be measured 
by clocks or any other physical means. Husserl's con-
trast between "space-time" and immanent time thus 
parallels Bergson 's contrast between "time-space" and 
duration. In Bergson 's account, in ner time, or "temps 
qualite," is projected by our intelligence into space and 
becomes spatialized as "temps quantite." The intelli-
gence considers this duration as extended because it 
applies to the habits of consciousness acquired in its 
contacts with matter. 
Nevertheless, even though the projection of dura-
tion into SPACE distorts the original content of duration, 
neither spatial bodily perception nor temporal memory 
( or mind) ever exists in pure isolation. Memory is the 
mind itself inasmuch as it is not simply a mechanical 
reproduction of the past, as if the past would be no 
more than a series ofready-made images; rather, it be-
stows sense upon the present by means of an active 
relation to the past. What is the mechanism whereby 
memory impregnates perception to give it depth and 
meaning? How does memory return its images to per-
ception so as to shape action? Bergson 's solution rests 
onan analogy between time and space. The represen-
tational image is, so to speak, the space-time intercept, 
and stands at the intersection of body and mind. The 
intersection is the actual origin of consciousness, preg-
nant with the sketch of an impending future action. 
Bergson illustrates this relation in a series of diagrams 
anticipating those in Husserl 's studies of inner time-
consciousness. A horizontal space line represents the 
world of objective things, which are assumed to ex-
ist indefinitely in their juxtapositions, even beyond the 
bounds of our perception. The time line, orthogonal 
to it, stands for the unconscious memory images pre-
served for recollection. At the point of intersection 
the crossing of the mind with matter occurs, the point 
where images enter perception and conscious action 
takes place. As an image evolves out of memory into 
bodily movement, it assumes more and more the form 
of extensional spatiality. The reason for this is that the 
adherence ofmemory to our present condition is anal-
ogous to, but not identica! with, the spatial adherence 
of unperceived to perceived objects. 
When phenomenology appeared 
in 
FRANCE, 
Bergsonism was stil! the dominating philosophy. JEAN-
PAUL SARTRE and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, in par-
ticular, have made extensive comments on Bergson. 
Sartre charges Bergson's theory of IMAGINATION with 
being a syncretism of consciousness and thinghood, 
since it wavers in perpetua! ambiguity and shifting 
from one sphere to the other. The image is left as an 
inert thing, a "curdled" entity. Bergson 's conscious-
ness lends something like a substantial form to things. 
Sartre's critica! vers ion of Bergsonian perception goes 
something like this: it is as if a person looked through 
a spyglass at a landscape and then endeavored to carry 
offthe glass with the vignette within it. 
Merleau-Ponty often returns to Bergson in his !ater 
works. Commenting on Bergson 's theory of perception 
in Le visible et l"invisible (1964), he denies the possi-
bility that we could ever place ourselves in the object 
of perception. Indeed, "in the measure that the thing 
is approached, I cease to be; in the measure that 1 am, 
there is no thing, but only a double of it in my 'cam-
era obscura."' Concern ing the intuition of essences, he 
urges us to put both the essence and the fact back into 
the fabric of our life. In opposing himselfto the search 
for the essence, however, his aim is not to return to the 
immediate in the sense of an effective fusion with the 
existent, as ifan original integrity had been lost and had 
tobe rediscovered. Rather, the originating breaks up, its 
appeal goes in severa! directions; the hiddenness ofBe-
ing must be a characteristic of Being itself. Bergson 's 
idea offusion or of coincidence is itselftranscended by 
his own refusal to take hold oftime as between forceps 
in order to measure it. Ultimately, Bergson substitutes 
his own realism for scientific realism, namely, the pre-
existence ofthe total being. The problem ofthe cogito 
is therefore not really addressed, since my conscious-
ness is merely a perspective cut out in the totality ofBe-
ing; the being of consciousness, such as its intentiona! 
structure, is therefore passed over. Bergson 's concept 
ofthe subject is achieved by subtraction: 1 do not have 
to think it, because the distance separating the subject 
from itself is imperceptible. 
On balance, Bergson 's philosophy of mind does not 
seem to be fundamentally different from those epis-
temologies that seek to universalize apparently com-
pleted scientific theories, instead of trying to under-
stand them in a radical manner. In L 'energie spir-

HENRIBERGSON 
61 
ituelle, Bergson asked himself what would ha ve hap-
pened if the founders of modern natural science (Ke-
pler, Galileo, Newton) had been psychologists rather 
than physicists. He argues that our current psychology 
would differ from what it is now, much as Newton's 
mechanics differ from Aristotle 's. But could this psy-
chology be so radically different as to avoid a simple 
subject-object dualism and the concomitant aporias of 
inwardness and representation? 
Unlike Husserl, Bergson has left no school that 
would develop his ideas; he had no disciples in the 
proper sense of the term, though he counted sev-
era) admirers and defenders. Perhaps the clearest case 
of a genuine disciple is EUGENE MINKOWSKI. In Le 
temps vecu (1933), Minkowski endeavored to rein-
terpret the whole of the foundations of PSYCHIATRY 
in terms of time as quality. Undeniably, a filiation 
exists from Bergson to French EXISTENTIAL PHENO-
MENOLOGY. Marcel Proust, Paul Valery, and Charles 
Peguy ha ve vindicated Bergson as the source of their 
own insights. But Bergson never speaks ofthe distance 
between the two egos, the superficial and the deep, in 
terms of a crisis; any sense of anxiety is a false problem 
resulting from our intelligence, so that it is absorbed 
in the self-transcendence of human Iife. On the other 
hand, Alfred North Whitehead's metaphysics (the at-
tempt to reconcile continuity and novelty) certainly 
owes much to Bergson. The German antirationalist 
Lebensphilosophie took up a number of Bergsonian 
tenets, mixing them with Nietzsche; this is particularly 
true for GEORG SIMMEL, with his view of life as per-
petua) self-transcendence. MAX SCHELER conceived of 
phenomenology as the concerted effort to go from the 
symbols back to the things, from a conceptual science 
and a civilization contented with symbols to intuitively 
experienced life. In this he sympathized with Berg-
son: the danger of symbolism lies in the tendency of 
symbols to displace and to conceal the phenomena. Fi-
nally, Die sinnhafie Aujbau der sozialen Welt ( 1932), 
ALFRED SCHUTZ traced the meaning-structure ofthe so-
cial world to its origin in Bergson 's sense of duration. 
He explicitly interpreted the bracketing of the natural 
world in terms ofBergson's attempt to turn away from 
the world of objects. He also used Bergson's contrast 
of the continuity of duration with the spatialized time 
of reflection to clarify Husserl 's double intentionality 
ofthe stream of consciousness. Criticizing Bergson for 
assigning the psychic states involved in free action to 
duration itself, not the reflection that accompanies the 
completed act, Schutz went on to extend duration to 
intersubjective experience.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
LUDWIG BINSWANGER 
A leading figure 
in introducing phenomenology into PSYCHIATRY, Bin-
swanger studied medicine in Lausanne, Heidelberg, 
and Zurich. In 1906-7, he interned in the psychiatric 
clinic, Burghălzli, in Zurich, which was directed by 
Eugen Bleuler (1857-1939), an eminent psychiatrist 
who had renamed Emil Kraeplin 's ( 1856-1926) de-
mentia praecox the "group of schizophrenias." Bleuler 
was among the first to accept psychoanalysis into aca-
demic psychiatry. He exerted a lasting influence on 
Binswanger and also became a close friend. The head 
physician at Burghălzli, Cari Jung ( 1875-1961 ), di-
rected Binswanger's dissertation and served enthusi-
astically as an experimental subject for it. During this 
time, Jung also took him to Vienna to visit Sigmund 
Freud ( 1856-1939). This meeting began a close friend-
ship that lasted until Freud's death and thus well after 
Binswanger became critica! of PSYCHOANALYSIS. 
During 1907-8, Binswanger studied neurology at 
Jena under his unele, Otto Binswanger ( 1852-1929), 
who had personally treated Friedrich Nietzsche. Soon 
he was forced, due to his father's untimely death in 
191 O, to assume the direction of the family-owned 
Sanatorium Bellevue in Kreuzlingen. Founded by his 
grandfather in 1857, Bellevue was known for its pro-
gressive, "humanistic" attitude in producinga "family" 
atmosphere. The clinic also housed -
sometimes as 
guests, sometimes as patients -
many wealthy and 
famous people, including Bertha Pappenheim (Freud's 
Anna 0.), the Russian dancer Vaslav Nijinskiy, and the 
German actor Gustav Grundgens. 
Binswanger devoted himself to the search for the 
foundations of psychiatry. He first sought these foun-
dations in psychology and following, in part, Bleuler, 
he first looked to Freud's psychoanalysis. Although 
it penetrated to the depths of the human subject as 
an individual, historical being, he considered it un-
able to account for the totality of that being. He had 
to turn to phenomenological and existential philoso-
phy to overcome the metaphysical oppositions between 
body-mind, inner-outer, self-other, and real-ideal that 
were taken for granted in both psychoanalysis and 
psychopathology. If the totality affected by the ill-
ness could be clarified, the treatment of the men-
tally ill would become more humane, more ethical, 
and more effective. Subsequently, the theme of his 
interest remained the same, but the name of his ap-
proach underwent modifications: a "personalist" ap-
proach (ca. 1913-27), a phenomenological PHILOSOPH-
ICAL ANTHROPOLOGY (ca. 1927--43), Daseinsana~vsis 
(ca. 1943--{)0), and finally, "empirica! phenomenology" 
(1960--{)6). 
Binswanger's relationship with KARL JASPERS be-
gan in 1913 when he sent him his critica! review of 
a recent article by Jaspers. Although usually conge-
nial, their (unpublished) correspondence and meetings 
tended to focus on three points of contention: first, 
Jaspers does not give enough credit to the scientific 
foundations of psychoanalysis; second, Jaspers does 
not adequately appreciate EDMUND HUSSERL 's EIDETIC 
METHOD as a way to clarify these foundations; and 
third, psychological "understanding" as the basis of 
psychiatric cognition. It is not something constructed 
by rational thought processes, but rather is based on 
an intuitive apprehending of the other as a totality in 
whom mind and body, inner and outer, verbal and non-
verbal are still not abstractly separated. The seeing of 
"motivational" connections between mental processes 
is also not based on a heuristic, constructive under-
standing supported by "ideal types" a la MAX WEBER, 
but on a direct seeing of the person in his or her situ-
ation. Binswanger contends that Jaspers uses far more 
intuition (in the sense of Husserl 's phenomenology) in 
his descriptions ofpsychopathology than he is prepared 
to admit theoretically. A fourth point came !ater. After 
World War Il, Binswanger increasingly devoted his re-
search to understanding the seemingly private "world" 
of schizophrenic psychosis, which he calls the idios 
kosmos, and which Jaspers considered ununderstand-
able. 
As for psychoanalysis, Binswanger soon objected 
to the exclusive reliance on biologica! drives and be-
gan to doubt that it could provide the scientific "psy-
chological" foundations for psychiatry. Einfuhrung in 
die Probleme der allgemeinen Psychologie (lntroduc-
tion to the problems of general psychology, 1922) 
marks Binswanger's attempt to review the philosophi-
cal problem ofthe person in the history ofpsychology 
both in its NATURAL SCIENTIFIC and its HUMAN SCI-
ENTIFIC directions. The phenomenologies of Husserl, 
MAX SCHELER, and ALEXANDER PFĂNDER on the one 
hand and psychoanalysis on the other resisted this op-
position because they understood the human subject as 
a historical being who constitutes meaningful connec-

tions in experience. The "object" of psychiatric cog-
nition is the person given to intuition and not divided 
into a mind and a body or interpreted in terms of cul-
tural products. Nevertheless, in contrast to MEDARD 
BOSS, Binswanger always used psychoanalytical con-
cepts for the interpretation of dreams and artworks and 
in clinica! treatment. 
Binswanger had studied Husserl's work at least 
as early as 1913. He devoted a considerable part of 
the Einfiihrung to Husserl, who copiously marked the 
copy sent to him and visited Binswanger the follow-
ing year. Although Binswanger names Bleuler and 
Freud as his original "teachers," he thanks Husserl for 
the first "decisive turning" in his thought. In "Uber 
Phănomenologie" ( 1922), he tries to show the useful-
ness ofphenomenological method for psychiatry, argu-
ing that the phenomenological method offree variation 
and eidetic intuition is similar to the work ofthe artist. 
Thus Franz Mare did not depict actual horses in 
painting blue horses, but he captured something true 
or essential about horses in the "abstract" precisely 
through this non-realistic or non-actual representa-
tion. Vincent van Gogh was able to paint the wind 
"wrestling" with the trees, which reminds us of the 
"drama" of human fa te, or a stalk of corn that, due to 
some shared, general expressive quality, awakens feel-
ings akin to when we see a sleeping child. This intuiting 
of essential structures is a direct apprehension of the 
"physiognomic" or expressive meaning encountered 
prior to any cognitive "understanding" ( Verstand) in 
the sense of KANT or Jaspers, i.e., the ability con-
sciously to reflect, subsequently analyze into parts, and 
put meaningful structures into words. Although Bin-
swanger remained skeptical that intuition could secure 
an "absolute" basis for cognition in science, he contin-
ued to turn to the IMAGINATION as a special "source" 
for detecting basic "anthropological" forms. 
Binswanger read MARTIN HEIDEGGER's Sein und 
Zeit ( 192 7) when it appeared and gained new impetus 
for his thought. DASEIN 's care-structure as being-in-
the-world served as a new way of conceptualizing the 
relationship between self and world in mentally ill ex-
istence. Nevertheless, he continued to call his approach 
"phenomenological anthropology" until 1943, when he 
renamed it Daseinsanalyse. During this period, he also 
argued that the psychoanalytical unconscious is to be 
rethought phenomenologically in terms of existence 
in the BODY. On his reading of Heidegger, he identi-
fies the unconscious, i.e., embodied existence, with the 
"thrownness and determinateness ofDasein." In his fi-
nal phase, he makes it the subject matter for a GENETIC 
PHENOMENOLOGY a la Husserl. 
For the expression ofthe imagination in LANGUAGE, 
Binswanger turned to the use ofmetaphor in everyday 
idioms and proverbs, in poetry, and in dream, but also 
in the language of the mentally ill during psychother-
apy or in self-descriptions. The use of metaphor in 
language is not merely a linguistically formed pred-
icative meaning attached, after the fact, to our per-
ceptions, but reflects the structures of existence (as 
something lived) in our embodied being-in-the-world. 
In 1934, he writes that working with the imaginary 
in psychotherapy is effective because the "lived bod-
ily and imaginary sphcres (Leib- und Bildsphiire)" are 
closely connected. That is, when other channels of 
communication have been cut off, the body comes 
to expression "metaphorically" in the production of 
the symptom, whether this be "hysterical" conversion, 
psychosomatic illness, or psychosis. 
The upright posture ofthe human "lived body" ~ 
to 
which Binswanger's close friend, ERWIN STRAUS, had 
already drawn attention ~ 
introduces the vertical di-
mension as a "direction of significance" not only in the 
construction of a "lived SPACE," but also in the possibil-
ities of existence as such. The terms height and depth, 
breadth and narrowness, are descriptors for fundamen-
tal "anthropological" structures of existence. These 
may be "seen" phenomenologically in the images used, 
for example, in poetic and everday language, as well 
as in psychotic expression. The images of ascending 
(in self-realization) and falling (along the vertical axis) 
and of going forth, encountering obstacles, and being 
with others (along the horizontal axis) signify basic 
human possibilities of"movement." Using a term nor-
mally applied to the "vertigo" of mountain climbers 
(sich versteigen) and "extravagance" ( Verstiegenheit), 
Binswanger shows how there can be an "anthropolog-
ical disproportion" between the vertical and horizon-
tal "dimensions" or "directions of significance" in the 
projection of existence as a "world-design." This is 
even clearer in his Daseins-analytical and !ater pheno-
menological clinica! studies of schizophrenic patients. 
Becoming extravagant (sich in etwas versteigen), as it 
occurs in schizophrenic psychosis, means to Iose one 's 

64 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ability to transcend (iiber-steigen, Latin, transcendere) 
one 's momentary perspective. The tension between the 
vertical and horizontal axes that is correlative with our 
bodily attitude informs the spontaneous symbolism of 
images through which we express our individual exis-
tential situations in art, dreams, or even psychosis. 
Binswanger and Straus have both pointed out that 
there can be no "inner life history" to the dream ~ 
no matter how much the dream may be interwoven 
with the inner life history ~ because there is an ab-
sence of a temporalizing function du ring dreaming that 
would enable transcendence ofthe momentary now in 
the continuity of meaning in inner becoming. As in 
falling asleep and the dream, so also in the flights into 
intoxication of the drug addict, the body becomes a 
kind of shell that is only a bie to produce present states. 
The self-realization of Dasein as being-in-the-world 
implies self-transcendence, a becoming other to one-
selfby means of assuming a new perspective in a pro-
cess ofbecoming. This involves an opening up ofthe 
self in the challenge of fac ing and encountering oth-
erness. Sometimes, this otherness is in ourselves. For 
this reason, narrative acts in psychotherapy may have 
a healing effect. 
Binswanger had applied Heidegger's analysis of 
the care-structure of Dasein as being-in-the-world in 
his own anthropological studies of the disproportions 
of existence in the mentally ill as well as in his 
study of "love" (as opposed to care) as the hasis of 
psychiatric cognition in Grund(ormen und Erkenntnis 
menschlichen Daseins ( 1942). Following HANS KUNZ, 
however, he admits to a "productive misunderstand-
ing" ofHeidegger's strictly ontologica! intentions. Un-
der the increasing influence of his close friend and 
collaborator, WILHELM SZILASI ~ 
and ofthe seeming 
attempts ofpsychotic patients to want to communicate 
something unknown in their symptoms, the problem of 
grounding a psychoanalytical approach to psychoses as 
a disturbance ofmeaning, and the need to "formalize" 
the "range" and "depth" of such disturbances in differ-
ent mental disorders, as well as Heidegger's preference 
for Boss, experienced by Binswanger as a rejection 
~ 
the eighty-year-old Binswanger returned in a final 
phase ( 1960--66) to Husserl. 
Szilasi, who was the successor during 194 7--62 
to Husserl 's and Heidegger's chair at Freiburg, had 
been a sympathetic but critica! reader of Binswanger's 
work. He found it creative, but not rigorous enough. 
It had been unable to offer a precise "method." The 
description ofthe different worlds ofpsychopatholog-
ical experience and access to their construction (Au(-
bau) required a more exact concept of "experience." 
By means of the genetic, "empirica! phenomenologi-
cal" approach that Szilasi advocated (and that also took 
Heidegger's ontology into account), one would be able 
to demarcate at what point the dismantling, destruc-
tion, or deconstruction (Abbau) of the constitution of 
meaning first occurred as a kind of "denial" or "fail-
ure" in experience. It was not until Binswanger's very 
last works, however, that this influence fully emerges. 
Many German psychiatrists complained at the time that 
Binswanger's work had inexplicably taken a "pheno-
menological turn" away from the Daseinsanalysis. But 
these last works, particularly that on schizophrenic 
delusion, Wahn ( 1965), may be viewed as a final ef-
fort in which the various problems and directions that 
Binswanger attempted to integrate over his lifetime 
come to a new level of maturity and resolution in an 
admittedly still sketchy form. 
Classical psychopathology had described "delu-
sional perception" as an early sign of schizophrenia. 
Delusional PERCEPTION is the assigning of a "false 
or abnormal belief," which often arises abruptly, to 
an otherwise "intact" perception. This belief is rigidly 
maintained in spite of obvious proofto the contrary; its 
content is impossible, however, from the standpoint of 
"normal," everyday experience. Delusions are thereby 
thought first to arise in the process ofthinking or judg-
ing about one's perceptions (and not in the perceptual 
organization itself). Binswanger's work, however, sug-
gests that the classical view rests in the definition of 
"belief' as if it were an intellectual or cognitive act 
that accrues or attaches to the perception. Husserlian 
phenomenology shows that beliefis much more rooted 
in our perceptual experience than the commonsense 
oppositions of perception and belief or perception and 
judgment in classical psychopathology would lead us 
to think. 
For example, a patient sees an ordinary scythe and is 
absolutely certain that it will be used as a "martyring" 
instrument against her family. The "physiognomic" 
meaning of threat appears to issue "atmospherically" 
from the scythe itself. In beginning schizophrenia, the 
patient may have an agitated mood with the feeling 

LUDWIG BINSWANGER 
65 
that something very special or terrible is about to hap-
pen. As Binswanger had already pointed out, there is a 
disturbance to the natural course of experience. Gaps 
appear in the ongoing interconnecting of experience in 
the matrix-structure of existence. The matter-of-course 
obviousness that the world and situations in it will more 
or less proceed with the same "continuity" of"style" as 
before is lost. The world starts to come apart in a way 
that cannot be "thematized" by the patient. Unable to 
transcend his or her own momentary standpoint, certain 
features or fragments of experiencing appear to stand 
out over others. Certain adumbrations are no longer 
synthesized in the continuum of natural experience. 
As in dreams, objects are accepted as meaningful 
or complete when viewed from only one side, i.e., in 
terms of an immediate "physiognomic" adumbration in 
sensory awareness; these less complete objects are then 
given to "thought" as ifthey were already fully consti-
tuted and impartable to others in everyday discourse. 
The delusional object (the martyring "scythe," or, e.g., 
invisible powers or devices that control one's thoughts, 
actions, etc.) is given "ready made" to thought. It in-
volves a disturbance in the "passive," automatic pro-
cesses whereby our experience first comes to unity. 
The delusional "object" is neither a perception nor a 
cognition, but rather a result of a disturbance of how 
our perceptions first become translated into thoughts, in 
that an adumbration is elevated to an entire or complete 
abject "pregiven" with the "presumptive evidence" of 
worldexperience. 
Binswanger 's work infiuenced an entire genera-
tion of psychiatrists and philosophers. These include 
Martin Buber, HENRI EY, MICHEL FOUCAULT, HANS-
GEORG GADAMER, THEADORE HAERING, JACQUES LA-
CAN, MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, EDUARD SPRANGER, 
HUBERTUS TELLENBACH, and MICHAEL THEUNISSEN. 
At present, however, his work is mostly cited for 
merely historical interest. Unfortunately, most of his 
work is untranslated, and therefore not accessible to 
non-German reading philosophers, psychiatrists, psy-
chologists, literary critics, etc. Binswanger was rel-
atively pleased with Jacob Needleman's analysis of 
his work in the introduction to Being-in-the- World 
( 1963 ), but it nevertheless presents a very truncated 
Binswanger. As HERBERT SPIEGELBERG has noted, only 
the relations to Freud and Heidegger are emphasized 
and this only during specific periods of Binswanger's 
thought. This restrictive and narrow representation of 
his work has led to some misunderstanding of Bin-
swanger, whose work in phenomenology, however, sti li 
has a great relevance in many disciplines. For exam-
ple, AARON MISHARA has been working on the appli-
cation of Binswanger's concepts to psychopathology 
and diagnostic classification, on the healing power of 
narrative in psychotherapy, and on clarifying how his 
phenomenological analyses of the psychoses leads to 
a rethinking ofthe psychoanalytical unconscious.

BODY 
Though much philosophical reflection 
on the body has proceeded in terms of body-soul or 
mind-body distinctions, phenomenologists ha ve devel-
oped a distinction often expressed in the German words 
"Leih" and "Ko1per." Leih is usually translated "lived 
body," sometimes "animate organism," "living body," 
or simply "Body," and is related to the phenomen-
ological use of the French "corps propre." Korper is 
usually translated "physical body," sometimes "mate-
rial body," "object-body," or simply "body." EDMUND 
HUSSERL uses the distinction in lectures as early as 
1907, but the first published discussions of it are in 
part two of MAX SCHELER's Der Formalismus in der 
Ethik und die materiale Wertethik (Formalism in ethics 
and nonformal ethics ofvalues), which appeared in the 
second volume of the Jahrhuch fur Philosophie und 
phiinomenologische Forschung in 1916, and in EDITH 
STEIN's 1916 dissertation, published in 1917 as Zum 
Problem der Einfuhlung (On the problem of empa-
thy). Though this distinction is regularly made, it is 
exploited differently by different thinkers. Husserl in 
particular also makes use of other related terms (and 
his terminology is not always consistent). 
Fundamental to the Body-body distinction is that 
the turn to the Body involves the turn to experiential 
EVIDENCE in contrast to the body as investigated by 
such NATURAL SCIENCEs as anatomy and physiology. I 
ha ve direct experience of Bodilihood only in the case 
ofmy own Body as experienced from within, but 1 also 
perceive other Bodies- each uniquely experienced as 
Body by the subjectivity concerned and expressive of 
this subjectivity for others. However, I may also have 
direct experience of my own Body as recalcitrant, inca-
pacitated, alien, so that I experience "it" as a physical 
body whose materiality is a burden or impediment to 
"me." Thus Korper is not always a scientific construct 
in contrast to a more primordial experience of Leih, 
but can become a directly experienced phenomenon. 
Finally, for some thinkers, Bodilihood is pre-reflective 
engagement with the world, and any reflection- even 
an experientially based one- necessarily misses this 
functioning Bodily subjectivity by objectifying it. 
The phenomenological turn to the Body -
it-
self part of a broader cultural appreciation of Bod-
ily experience and movement emerging during the 
late 19th and early 20th centuries in Europe and 
North America -
begins in the work of Husserl. 
Though he did not develop a systematic pheno-
menology of the Body per se, relevant descriptions 
arise in a number of contexts, notably with regard 
to perceiving things in space. His most influential 
work on the Body appears in Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phănomenologie und phiinomeno!ogischen Philoso-
phie II [ 1912-15], though important passages are 
also found in Ding und Rman [ 1907], Ideen fii 
[ 1912], Analysen zur passiven Synthesis [ 1918-
26], Phiinomenologische P.1yclwlogie [ 1925], Carte-
sianische Meditationen [ 1931 ], Die Krisis der eu-
ropăischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale 
Phiinomenologie ( 1936), and the texts collected in the 
three volumes entitled Zur Phiinomenologie der Inter-
subjektivitiit [ 1905-20, 1921-28, 1929-35], as well as 
in some shorter texts on space-constitution published 
in the 1940s. Further relevant passages from the D 
manuscripts await publication; many of these are dis-
cussed in ULRICH CLAESGES' Edmund Husserls Theo-
rie der Raumkonstitution (Edmund Husserl 's theory of 
space-constitution, 1964). 
Since much of this work was not readily available 
for some years, the misconceptions arose that Husserl 
considered the body externa! to consciousness (albeit 
empirically connected with it in a natural unity); thus he 
placed the body in brackets in order to reach the realm 
of pure consciousness, and only came to appreciate 
subjectivity as Bodily at the end of his life. Texts for 
lecture courses of 1907 and 1910/ Il show, however, 
that phenomenological description of the Body and 
motility is an early as well as persistent theme in his 
work. One's own Body is always co-given, but not 
just as any spatial thing. Rather, it functions as center 
of orientation, bearer of felt sensations, and original 
capacity for motility, so that it is the primordial "organ" 
or means of ali action, perception, and expression.

BODY 
As centeroforientation, my Body is bearer ofthe ul-
timate central "here" from which ali else is "there" for 
me, the tacit or explicit center ofreference from which 
things are not only "near" or "far," "within reach" or 
"beyond reach," but also "in front" or "behind," "to 
the left" or "to the right," "above" or "below." (Even 
in imagination and memory, the abject or vîsta offers it-
selfperspectivally to a co-implied Bodily standpoint ir-
respective ofthe current physicallocation of my body.) 
Moving about, I transform what was a "there" into a 
new "here," so that what was "too far" is now "within 
grasp," etc., but I can never move out ofmy own central 
"hereness." Thus my own Body never becomes anab-
ject I can walk around and see from ali sides; visually 
speaking, it is a "remarkably imperfectly constituted" 
thing. 
But this is not necessarily true in other sensory 
modes, for my Body is also the bearer offelt sen-
sations. I can explore the tactile qualities of anything 
within reach, including my own body. But my Body 
is unlike any other abject in that when I touch myself, 
I also simultaneously feei myself touched; thus I ex-
perience my own Body through special sensations-
Husserl sometimes caUs them "Empfindnisse" ("sens-
ings," "feelings") rather than "Empfindungen" ("sensa-
tions")- that pertain to no other phenomenon. Feel-
ings of contact, pressure, weight, warmth, cold, ten-
sion, relaxation, pleasure, pain, etc., are localized on 
or in my Body, which functions as a persisting field, 
with its own unique spread, depth, and articulation, for 
ali such sensings. In addition to specific salient feel-
ings more or less determinately localized within the 
somaesthetic field, there can be more general feelings 
( e.g., well-being or indisposition) permeating the Body 
as a whole. And though 1 may often experience Bodily 
feelings ( e.g., a sudden sting) as something I "undergo" 
rather than something I "do," in many cases these sens-
ings arise in correlation with my own movements: as 
I move in my chair, I sense tactile contact now here, 
now there; as 1 make a fist then relax my hand, 1 sense 
first tension and then release in my hand and arm, etc. 
Finally, though Husserl recognizes the "sensations 
of movement" that arise when 1 move or am moved, 
he distinguishes such actual Bodily feelings (which are 
more or less localized and are intertwined with other 
sensings) from our primordial capacity for motility per 
se. Perceptual appearances, as "motivated," arise in 
67 
correlation to the "motivating" kinaestheses: "if' 1 look 
in a certa in direction, "then" I see this si de ofthat thing, 
etc. However, any particular kinaesthetic situati an (in-
cluding "holding stiU" as one mode of "being able to 
move myself') is but one possibility within a "practica/ 
kinaesthetic horizon" articulated into various kinaes-
thetic fields that can be swung into play separately or 
in various combinations ( e.g., 1 can look to the left 
by turning my eyes, head, or torso, or some combina-
tion thereof) in kinaesthetic sequences that are freely 
repeatable and reversible (and can substitute for one 
another to a certain extent). Thus while currently given 
appearances are correlative to current kinaesthetic cir-
cumstances, the very explorability of my surrounding 
world is correlative to the possibilities of my practi-
ca! kinaesthetic horizon as a whole (moving closer to 
perceive more detail, going around to the other side, 
touching as well as seeing, etc.), and embarking on a 
specific kinaesthetic sequence motivates a correlative 
sequence of continuai transitions from "expectations" 
to "fulfillments." Moreover, motility is at the root of 
ACTION, and Husserl distinguishes a sphere of current 
practica! action, comprising objects within immediate 
reach, from a sphere of potential practica! action reach-
able only through locomotor kinaestheses- a theme 
also taken up by ALFRED SCHUTZ, who uses the notion 
of"manipulatory area" worked out by George Herbert 
Mead ( 1863-1931) in contrasting the world within ac-
tual, potential, and restorable reach. 
Yet motility cannot simply be equated with actively 
initiated movement, since it is foundational for vari-
ous modes of responsively being-affected as well. For 
instance, within my familiar field of kinaesthetic pos-
sibilities, some gestures may be habitual and some ki-
naesthetic sequences may ari se "involuntarily" ( e.g., 
my head turns when something attracts my attention), 
while others, like breathing, typically persist "in the 
background" and are only occasionally inhibited and 
resumed "voluntarily." Husserl nevertheless summa-
rizes ali such movements with the term "I can" (though 
the "1 move" developmentally precedes the "1 can"), 
since 1 can also deliberately run through the kinaes-
thetic sequences in question and since my ordered sys-
tems ofkinaesthetic possibilities are normally freely at 
my disposal. But he also recognizes experiences ofre-
striction, resistance, and failure; while the use oftools 
and TECHNOLOGY can expand my kinaesthetic capaci-

68 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ties, injury may truncate them, and though 1 can acquire 
new Bodily skills through practice, I can also Iose or 
forget them. Thus the kinaesthetic possibilities at my 
disposal may vary from infancy to old age and with the 
state of my health. 
The question of Bodily normality is also a major 
theme in Husserl 's treatment ofthe "naturalized" Body. 
Here he analyzes not only how perceptual abnormal-
ities may be traced back to abnormalities in the per-
ceiving organism, but also how the Body itselffirst be-
comes a theme for psychophysical investigations and 
how the resulting "Leibkărper" serves to localize the 
psyche and makes it the abject of real-causal inves-
tigations. But in some passages, he also addresses how 
the Body is experienced in a "personalistic" (rather 
than "naturalistic") attitude -
i.e., as expressive of 
the person and personallife and as belonging to social 
communities whose VALUEs shape my Bodily habitus. 
And the Body plays a key ro le in the genesis of INTER-
SUBJECTIYITY: since 1 not only sense my Body from 
within but can perceive it from the outside, a primor-
dial pai ring of "inner" and "outer" takes place in my 
own case; then when I perceive another's Body exter-
nally, this motivates the recognition of an associated 
"inwardness" for the case ofthe other as well. But since 
I will never ha ve direct access to the other's immediate 
Bodily experience, and since the other's Body remains 
irreducibly "there" in contrast to my "here," the other 
remains genuinely "other." 
Husserl's work in CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 
of the Body has been carried forward in GER-
MANY above ali by ULRICH CLAESGES, who deveJ-
ops Husserl 's notion of "kinaesthetic consciousness" 
(which is not a consciousness "of' movement as 
present before me, but refers to my own functioning 
in the total kinaesthetic system) and by LUDWIG LAND-
GREBE, who distinguishes the Body as constituted (the 
Body as apprehended as an abject over against the 
experiencing subjectivity) from the Body as constitut-
ing, whose functioning kinaesthetic capacities belong 
to transcendental subjectivity itself. 
In FRANCE, phenomenology of the Body not only 
draws upon a prior tradition that includes Franc;ois-
Pierre Maine de Biran (1766--1824), HENRI BERGSON, 
and GABRIEL MARCEL, but is profoundly influenced 
by existential concerns. The resulting EXISTENTIAL 
PHENOMENOLOGY of Bodily existence typically in-
volves a critique both of consciousness as disembodied 
spectator and of prevalent natural scientific accounts of 
sensations; an emphasis on facticity and situatedness, 
as well as on horizons and projects; and a contrast 
between the "lived" and the "known." 
For JEAN-PAUL SARTRE in L 'etre et le neant (1943), 
just as anatomy and physiology- which are based on 
an outsider's view ofthe body of another- only reach 
the body as abject, so also other everyday instances of 
experiencing myself as though from another's view-
point only yield an alienated body. Even my own sen-
sations normally reveal the things I perceive, not the 
perceiving Body itself, and ifl look at myself or palpa te 
my flesh, 1 only perceive a thing among things. How-
ever, my Body is implied, by the perspectiva! givenness 
of things, as the point of view from which I see them, 
though it is a point of view on which 1 can never take 
a point ofview; it is indicated, by the network oftools 
referring to one another, as the center of the oriented 
space of action opened by the task I am engaged in, 
but is not itself a tool 1 use. Thus 1 unreflectively "ex-
ist" my Body by "surpassing" it toward the things 1 
perceive and the future possibilities I want to bring 
about. Though there can be an affective apprehension 
ofmy own Bodily contingency through a kind of gen-
eral "nausea," and though Bodily incapacity ( e.g., eye 
pain) can gradually become present to me by way ofthe 
things ofthe world (the book pages that become "hard 
to read"), the genuinely "lived" Body never becomes 
an explicit focus ofmy experiencing, but is continually 
"passed over in silence." 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY is often hailed as the 
chiefproponent ofphenomenology ofthe Body due to 
the emphasis on the Body in Phenomenologie de la per-
ception ( 1945) and his influence in the secondary liter-
ature. He himself was deeply influenced by Husserl's 
work on the Body -
especially in Jdeen 11, which 
he consulted long before it was posthumously pub-
lished in 1952- and was the first to make some key 
Husserlian notions ("I can," nullpoint of orientation, 
the touching/touched example) widely known. Like 
Husserl, he emphasizes the importance ofperception as 
a primordial stratum and the fundamental role ofBod-
ily motility in PERCEPTION. But where Husserl traces 
the "naturalized" Body back to the "naturalizing" at-
titude of NATURALISM and suspends automatic accep-
tance ofthis scientific view ofthe body in order to de-

BODY 
scribe Bodily phenomena themselves, Merleau-Ponty 
criticizes both empiricist and intellectualist styles of 
explanation precisely in ordcr to suggest new theo-
retical accounts of the same data they attempt to ex-
plain. And where Husserl uncovers and explicates the 
usually anonymously functioning Bodily intentionali-
ties, Merleau-Ponty emphasizes the pre-personal, pre-
reflective status of a Bodily anonymity that evades 
ali objectification, yet is always already functioning in 
everything we do: the Body is not only how we are "an-
chored" in the natural world, but is also our "medium" 
for having a world in a Body-world "pact" prior to any 
subject-object split. 
Since what is at stake is not explicit reflective 
thought "about" the Body but Bodilihood as pre-
reflectively lived, Merleau-Ponty often makes use of 
what RICHARD M. ZANER calls "prominence by ab-
sence," turning to pathological cases to reveal what 
tacitly functioning Bodilihood is normally like. For ex-
ample, the phenomenon of the phantom limb reveals 
that our normal Body schema is a habitual system of 
possibilities supporting any momentary gesture, and 
disruptions in motor functioning reveal that familiar 
actions usually flow off as an integrated whole in a 
"kinetic melody." Moreover, the Body schema is not 
identica! with my physical body, but incorporates the 
tools I "inhabit," so that the blind person does not feei 
the cane, but feels the world through it, and the musi-
cian does not manipulate the instrument like a separate 
abject, but lives in it like a limb and inhabits the ex-
pressive musical space it opens. 
Merleau-Ponty also goes beyond the individual 
Body per se with his notion of"intercorporeity" (which 
has been taken up by, e.g., BERNHARD WALDENFELS, 
KĂTE MEYER-DRAWE , HERMAN COENEN, ICHIRO YA-
MAGUCHI, and ELIZABETH A. BEHNKE) as a primordial 
solidarity of and between embodied beings -
a pre-
personal communality that is never fully effaced, but 
sustains a reciproca! interplay of one 's own and others' 
comportment prior to any explicit consensus. Finally, 
in Le visible et l 'invisible ( 1964), Merleau-Ponty de-
velops an ontologica! notion of "flesh" as a style of 
Being such that there is reversibility- but never com-
plete coincidence -
between "my" visible, tangible 
flesh and the "flesh ofthe world" 1 see and touch. 
lncarnate existence is also a key theme in PAUL 
RICCEUR 's Le volontaire et 1 'involontaire ( 1950): voi-
69 
untary Bodily movement as practica! organ of our will 
depends on a Bodily docility that can always be dis-
rupted; as a source of motives, values, needs, and the 
disorder wrought by EMOTION, the Body is subject to 
our concern and control, and is the locus both of our 
freedom and of the nature that makes it a finite frec-
dom. And for EMMANUEL LEVINAS, not only is my own 
Body passivity and vulnerability, but the other's Body 
-
paradigmatically (but not exclusively) the face-
calls me to an ethical responsibility based on respon-
siveness and respect. 
In JAPAN there also was already a tradition ofphilo-
sophical reflection on the Body prior to phenomen-
ological work on this theme. But here the tradition is 
Buddhist rather than Cartesian, and is thus not struc-
tured from the start in terms of mind-body dualism. 
The historical origins of a Japanese view ofthe Body 
are considered by YASUO YUASA (not to be confused 
with SHIN'ICHI YUASA, who is also active in phenomen-
ology ofthe Body) in conjunction with contemporary 
Japanese philosophy ofthe Body (TETSURQ WATSU.II, KI-
TARO NISHIDA), existential phenomenology, and such ar-
eas as PSYCHIATRY, PSYCHOANALYSIS, and psychosomatic 
medicine. Detailed phenomenological descriptions of 
the Body as lived in concrete everyday experience, as 
well as analyses of the multiple meanings of the word 
"mi" ("living flesh"), are found in the works ofHIROSHI 
ICHIKAWA. Besides an affinity between Japanese work 
on the Body and that of Merleau-Ponty, scholarship 
on Husserl 's approach to the Body is not lacking in, 
for instance, essays by YOSHITERU CHIDA, YOSHIHIRO 
NITTA, TORU TANI, and HIROTAKA TATEMATSU, nor in 
new work on specific themes by such scholars as HI-
ROSHI KOJIMA, who takes up the Leib-Korper distinc-
tion in an original way; TADASHI OGAWA, who contrasts 
the visual paradigm with the tactile-kinaesthetic con-
stitution of the Body; and KIYOKAZU WASHIDA, who 
describes transformations of the Body through cloth-
ing in his work on "fashion." 
In ITALY, ENZO PACI brings Husserl's notion of 
functioning kinaesthetic Bodilihood into relation with 
Marxist concerns in Funzione delle scienze e signifi-
cato dell 'uomo (Function of the sciences and signifi-
cation of the human, 1963 ); the laboring Body must 
not be reduced to a thing, yet we must not ignore the 
human rootedness in a material base, expressed, e.g., in 
the lived experience of fundamental biologica! needs.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
At workshops on phenomenology and MARXISM held 
in Dubrovnik in the 1970s, LUDWIG LANDGREBE a]so 
emphasized the primordial ro le ofBodily motility. And 
in CZECHOSLOVAKIA, .lAN PATOCKA's Te/o, spo/ecenstvi, 
jazyk, svet (Body, community, language, world. 1983) 
was delivered as university lectures in 1968/69, but 
could not be published at that time; here our situated 
Bodilihood- which we are horizonally aware of, but 
which can never be objectified -!ies at the core ofthe 
three "movements of human existence" he describes. 
A further important constellation emerges from a 
PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY that sees Bodilihood 
as fundamental to human existence in general, with 
such work often taking the form of concrete studies 
-
e.g., in phenomenological PSYCHOLOGY- that ad-
dress specific themes in both normal and disrupted 
Bodily experience. These include, for instance, ERWIN 
w. STRAUS's essays on lived spatiality and movement 
-
originally published in the 1930s and now in his 
Phenomenological Psychology ( 1966) -
as well as 
the work of the Dutch school of phenomenological 
psychology ( e.g., FREDERIK J.J. BUYTENDIJK, JAN HEN-
DRIK VAN DEN BERG, JOHANNES LINSCHOTEN, DAVID 
J. VAN LENNEP). Such work has not only influenced 
existential-phenomenological psychotherapy, but also 
fi.nds a parallel in qualitative research on the Body in 
phenomenologically influenced HUMAN SCIENCES -
e.g., studies of physically handicapped children car-
ried out by HANS BLEEKER and KAREL J. MULDERIJ in 
the Utrecht Lifeworld Research Project. 
In CANADA, JOHN O'NEILL (Five Bodies, 1985) 
traces the social shaping ofBodies and MAUREEN CON-
NOLLY pursues topics in PHYSICAL EDUCATION, and 
in the UNITED STATES, Bodilihood is emphasized in 
DAVID SEAMON's phenomenological GEOGRAPHY and 
EDWARD s. CASEY's phenomenology of place; sexu-
ality and eros are treated by ALPHONSO LINGIS and 
MARTIN DILLON; THOMAS J. CSORDAS exp]ores embod-
iment in the context ofETHNOLOGY; LEWIS R. GORDON 
studies Bodily elements of racism; phenomenologi-
cal research into transformative somatie practice is a 
key element in ELIZABETH A. BEHNKE's work in the 
Study Project in Phenomenology ofthe Body; and the 
field of SOMATICS itself was given a name and iden-
tity by THOMAS HANNA, who was directly influenced 
by existential phenomenology of the Body. Husserlian 
and existential work on the Body figure in phenomen-
ology ofMEDICINE as worked out by, e.g., RICHARD M. 
ZANER, STUART F. SPICKER, DREW LEDER, and S. KAY 
TOOMBS. And EUGENE T. GENDLIN's original work on 
the Bodily "felt sense" of the pre-conceptual intricacy 
of a global situation-including one's sedimented past, 
current concerns, and possible next steps to take -
has been a major influence on such thinkers as DAVID 
MICHAEL LEVIN, who offers a HERMENEUTIC AL PHENO-
MENOLOGY of the Body as a way to flesh out MAR-
TIN HEIDEGGER's work (which touches directly on the 
Body only in a few places, e.g., the Zollikon seminars 
with MEDARD BOSS). Relatively little descriptive work 
has yet been done on the directly lived experience of 
the gendered Body, but a beginning has been made by 
phenomenologists working in FEMINISM- e.g., SAN-
DRA LEE BARTKY, LOUISE LEVESQUE-LOPMAN, and IRIS 
MARION YOUNG- and SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR's con-
tributions are being retrieved as well. 
One question currently at stake in this fi.eld is 
whether the Body, as lived, is necessarily "marginal" 
(ARON GURWITSCH), if not "absent," or whether Bod-
ilihood can be lucidly lived in a "Bodily reflexivity" 
that does not make it an "object" over against "me." 
The "anonymity" ofthe Body may also be criticized as 
the result of social practices producing "docile" bodies 
(in the sense ofMICHEL FOUCAULT) with what Thomas 
Hanna has called chronic "sensory-motor amnesia"; 
in such a setting, the recovery of Bodily sensibilities 
has ethical-political implications. Much work also re-
mains tobe done toward a phenomenology of extraor-
dinary embodiment as found, for instance, in outstand-
ing athletes or arising through transformative somatie 
practice. In fact, as SHIGENORI NAGATOMO indicates, 
such possibilities challenge phenomcnologists to ac-
knowledge and study experiences beyond the "every-
day," whi!e ECOLOGY, FEMINISM, and ETHNIC STUDIES 
also remind phenomenologists to take a fuller range 
of Bodily experiences into account. Finally, the open-
endedness and intricacy ofBodilihood-which resists 
being unequivocally pinned down once and for ali in 
any ontologica! account- is a constant invitation to 
descriptive phenomenology to return to the experien-
tial evidence ofthe "phenomena themselves."

FRANZ BRENTANO 
Brentano is generally 
regarded as the philosopher who reintroduced the con-
cept of INTENTIONALITY into modern philosophy -
a concept !ater characterized by EDMUND HUSSERL as 
the principal theme ofphenomenology. It was Brentano 
who gave Husserl the idea that philosophy is a "rigor-
ous science" based on the description of the immedi-
ately given. Brentano 's relation to the phenomenologi-
cal movement is, however, quite complex and has still 
to be thoroughly examined. For such an endeavor it is 
not enough to recognize influences and parallels; one 
also has to understand that Brentano 's philosophy is 
rooted in a cultural background quite different from 
that of Husserl. 
Franz Clemens von Brentano ( 1838-1917)was born 
into one ofthe most influential German families ofthe 
19th century: the romantic lyric poet Clemens Brentano 
(1778-1842) was his unele and godfather, the politi-
cally influential romantic Bettina von Arnim ( 1785-
1859) his aunt, and the founder ofthe historical school 
of jurisprudence and Prussian minister Karl Friedrich 
von Savigny ( 1779-1861) his unele; his brother Lujo 
(1844-1931) was a well-known economist, and his 
nephew Georg von Hertling ( 1843-1919), who was to 
write his doctoral dissertation and Habilitationsschrift 
under Brentano's guidance, !ater became president of 
Bavaria and the German Imperial Chancellor. 
Brentano was educated in a rigid Catholic atmo-
sphere. He studied philosophy in Aschaffenburg, Mu-
nich, Wilrzburg, Berlin, and Milnster. The teachers who 
were most important for the development ofhis think-
ing were Friedrich August Trendelenburg( 1802-1872) 
in Berlin and Franz Jacob Clemens (1815-1862) in 
Mi.inster. Trendelenburg, who started his career with 
an influential criticism of Hegel, was an expert in Aris-
totle; he edited a critica! edition of Aristotle's De an-
ima, wrote a history of the theory of categories, and 
developed his own system in a work entitled Logische 
Untersuchungen ( 1840). Brentano attended Trendelen-
burg's lectures on psychology and it was through him 
that he was led to the study of Aristotle. 
In 1859, in order to improve his knowledge of me-
dieval philosophy and to write a doctoral dissertation 
on Suarez, Brentano moved after only one semester in 
Berlin to Mi.inster, where he stayed until 1862. Franz 
Jakob Clemens was o ne of the most powerful promo-
tors of neo-Thomism in Germany and aggravated the

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
tension in the Catholic camp between the so-called 
"German" and "Ultramontane" theologians with his 
polemic writings. Whereas the former, like Ignaz von 
Dollinger and Johannes Evangelist Kuhn, lay a great 
emphasis on historical methods and defended a com-
plete independence of philosophy from theology, the 
latter were convinced that the foundation ofphilosophy 
was laid by Aquinas and that modern philosophy was 
a great heap of rubble; philosophy, they held, is only 
relatively independent since it has tobe in accordance 
with the dogmas of the church, which are regarded as 
the philosopher's lodestars. Afterthe death ofClemens, 
Brentano received his doctorate in 1862 for a disser-
tation Von der mannigfachen Bedeutung des Seienden 
nach Aristoteles ( On the manifold senses of being in 
Aristotle). In this book, which was dedicated to Tren-
delenburg, Brentano tried systematically to deduce the 
Aristotelian categories for which his teacher Trende-
lenburg had sought to give a linguistic explanation. 
In the same year Brentano entered the monastery 
of the Dominicans in Graz, to which his friend Hein-
rich Denifle (1844--1905), !ater a well-known scholar 
in medieval philosophy, belonged. He left the congre-
gation after severa! months, however, having decided 
to study theology in order to become a priest and to 
pursue an academic career as a philosopher. At the 
same time, the Catholic assembly in Germany decided 
to found a German Catholic university and Brentano 
was conceived as principal candidate for a chair in 
philosophy. In 1864 he was ordained a priest and he 
habilitated two years !ater in Wurzburg with his Die 
Psychologie des Aristoteles insbesondere seine Lehre 
vom NOUS POIETJKOS (The psychology of Aristotle, 
in particular his doctrine of the active intellect). 
In this work Brentano tries to show that there are no 
inconsistencies in Aristotle 's thinking, thereby defend-
ing him against the charges made by Protestant scholars 
such as Eduard Zeller (1814--1908). Brentano argued 
further that Aristotle was convinced of the immortal-
ity ofthe soul. Brentano 's interpretation of Aristotle in 
these early works is inspired by Thomas Aquinas, who 
is praised as the one who has best understood Aris-
totle. He thereby followed a program that had been 
propagated by the journal Der Katholik, which tried 
to lay the foundation for "Catholic science" in the 
work of Aristotle as interpreted by Aquinas. Brentano 
and his Wtirzburg students -
most of them, like 
Cari Stumpf ( 1848-1936), Anton Marty ( 184 7-1914 ), 
Herman Schell ( 1850--1906), Ludwig Schlitz ( 1838-
1901 ), and Heinrich Denifle ( 1844--1905), were for a 
time seminarians-were the only Catholics in Germany 
who were working seriously on Aristotle for a long 
time. The most important philosophical questions for 
Brentano remained throughout his life those pertaining 
to the immortality of the soul and to theism, subjects 
on which Brentano himself never published in a sys-
tematic way, but on which he lectured repeatedly and 
which are implicit in ali his work ( cf. his posthumous 
Die Lehre Jesu und ihre bleibende Bedeutung and Vom 
Dasein Gottes [The doctrine of Jesus and its enduring 
signification and On the existence of God]). 
In Wtirzburg Brentano was regarded first and fore-
most as a Catholic philosopher and therefore he was 
urged by the head of the faculty to lecture only about 
history of philosophy. Nevertheless, he gave lectures 
on metaphysics, lectures that brought him into conflict 
with his department, which supported a professorship 
for him only with reservations. Such tensions became 
even more problematic as a result of severe politi-
ca! struggles in the Church at that time, culminating 
in the doctrine of infallibility -
a doctrine rejected 
by Brentano. Thus Brentano laid down his office as a 
priest; he left Wurzburg in 1874 and accepted a chair 
in Vienna. He then married, as a result of which he 
once more lost his professorship and was constrained 
to teach for severa! years as Privatdozent. 
Among his students in Vienna were, besides Ed-
mund Husserl, also Kasimir Twardowski ( 1866--1938), 
Alexius Meinong (1853-1920), Christian von Ehren-
fels (1859-1932), Alois Hofler (1853-1922) and Sig-
mund Freud ( 1856--1939). 
In 1895, after the death of his first wife and 
unsucessful attempts to regain his professorship, 
Brentano decided to 1eave Austria and to settle in Flo-
rence. He died in Geneva in 1917. 
The Catholic background is important in order to 
understand the questions Brentano intended to answer 
in his psychology, in his ontology, and in his approach 
to the history ofphilosophy. The project of going back 
to Aquinas or Aristotle makes sense only if there is 
some standpoint beyond history that enables the devel-
opment and defense of a philosophia perennis. Such 
a standpoint is given by inner perception, which, ac-
cording to Brentano, renders EVIDENCE possible: what 

FRANZ BRENTANO 
73 
is evident to me is evident to everybody and at ali times. 
The work of philosophers who do not deal with eter-
na! problems or who are not directed by the search for 
evident judgments -
above ali materialists and Ger-
man idealists- is in Brentano 's eyes of no use for the 
needed reconstruction of philosophy. Such ideas led 
him to his doctrine of the four phases of philosophy. 
He sees the scientific attitude as characteristic for the 
first scientific stage. He then tries to show how turning 
away from the right scientific attitude and to practi-
ca! questions ( 1 st stage of decay) results necessarily in 
scepticism (2nd stage of decay), which in turn leads 
to an endeavor for a reconstruction ofphilosophy with 
non-scientific means (3rd stage of decay). This cycle 
then repeats itselfthrough the whole ofhistory. 
Brentano thereby introduced the project of"philoso-
phy as a rigorous science," a project that attracted many 
ofhis students, including Stumpfand Husserl, and im-
plied in Brentano 's eyes that in the reconstruction of 
philosophy, one could not simply obey the dogmas of 
the Church and adapt the philosophy of Aristotle or 
Aquinas thereto: one also has to take into account the 
results of contemporary science. Problematic in Aris-
totle is especially his doctrine of act and potency. In 
his Habilitationsschri(t, Brentano had interpreted these 
concepts in terms of form and matter. Thus the soul, 
which had been defined by Aristotle as the first prînei-
pic of a body capable of being ali ve, becomes a form 
that a body has. This facilitates the statement that the 
intellective soul is nothing other than a mental sub-
stance, and it suggests a part-whole theory according 
to which the living BODY of a human being is a whole, 
which conta ins as its parts the body and the soul. If a 
person dies, the mental substance continues to exist, but 
is "incomplete," mutilated. In this new interpretation 
of the doctrine of act and potency, its dynamic char-
acter is lost. Aristotle introduced the soul in order to 
explain the phenomenon of self-movement; Brentano, 
however, cannot account for this aspect in his interpre-
tation. Accordingly, his metaphysics is Aristotelian in 
character but deprived of the aspect of development. 
The same is truc of Brentano's descriptive PSYCHOL-
OGY, which he introduces as a Kombinatorik that has 
to classify the elements of the mental content and to 
determine their possible modes of combination. (What 
he calls "genetic psychology" is in fact a physiological 
psychology.) 
It was already clear to Brentano in his Wurzburg 
lectures on metaphysics that evidence must be en-
sured as the basis for philosophy. Thus in the first part, 
which is entitled "Transcendental Philosophy or Apol-
ogy for Rational Knowledge," Brentano tries to show 
that scepticism is untenable and that there is afirm ba-
sis of knowledge to which there belongs much more 
than the "Archimedian point" of self-consciousness 
discovered by Descartes. Brentano 's major work, his 
Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt ( 1874 ), aims 
to lay the foundation for psychology as a rigorous sci-
ence, and is thus to be understood in the same episte-
mological context. 
The Psychologie contains a discussion of Auguste 
Comte, on whom Brentano had given a series of public 
lectures in 1869. Comte claims that ali sciences are 
concerned with phenomena and not with some meta-
physical things-in-themselves. He thus rejects meta-
physics, and since there is, according to him, no inner 
observation, psychology cannot be an autonomous sci-
ence. Brentano accepts the first claim, and accordingly 
defines psychology as the science of psychic phenom-
ena, but he denies the other two claims. It is truc that we 
cannot observe our psychic phenomena, but Brentano 
tries to show that they can be innerly perceived. By 
"in ner perception" he refers to a characteristic of psy-
chic phenomena, which are not only directed toward 
an object- e.g., a sensory quality- but also always 
"on the side" toward themselves -
e.g., the psychic 
phenomenon of presenting a sensory quality. Thus psy-
chic phenomena ha ve a kind of transparency that ren-
ders possible a science ofthe soul that is in no need of 
a special act of inner observation. The central claims 
of Brentano 's Psychologie- that psychic phenomena 
are evident, that they are "intentionally inexistent" (a 
theme discussed below), that they exist just as they ap-
pear tobe and are thus not merely phenomenal as is the 
case with physical phenomena, and that there is a unity 
of consciousness -
are ali related to the claim that 
psychic phenomena are always inwardly perceived. 
With the published part ofhis Psychologie Brentano 
not only tried to lay the foundation ofpsychology as a 
science based on inner perception (this science he !ater 
called "descriptive psychology"; cf. his posthumous 
Deskriptive Psychologie [ 1887-91 ]), but also the "em-
pirica!" basis he needed for do ing metaphysics. In this 
respect his Psychologie has some resemblance to the 

74 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Meditations of Descartes in that it, too, tries to find a 
fundamentum inconcussum. Cartesian doubt, however, 
is replaced in Brentano's schema by a kind of"bracket-
ing," since he "makes no use of' the concept ofthe soul 
and ofthe other metaphysical concepts that were his ba-
sic interest; he even affirmatively quotes the claim that 
we need a "psychology without a soul." That Brentano 
nevertheless sti li pursues a version of the program al-
ready mentioned is indicated by the fact that ali of his 
fundamental statements about psychic phenomena can 
be shown to have an Aristotelian origin. But he tries 
to meet the standards of modern science as formulated 
by Comte and John Stuart Mi li, who have replaced the 
authority of Aquinas. 
Of great importance is Brentano's classification 
of psychic phenomena. There are three classes: pre-
sentations, judgments, and emotive acts. Of the first 
Brentano claims that ali psychic phenomena are either 
presentations or involve presentations (a statement ac-
cepted by Husserl in an interpretation ofpresentations 
as "objectivating acts"). Judgments are conceived by 
Brentano as acts of affirmation or negation; thus he 
rejects a propositional theory of judgment. The third 
class (Akte der Gemiitsbewegung) contains acts ofvo-
lition as well as EMOTIONs, feelings, etc. These acts 
are conceived in analogy to judgments; they are either 
positive or negative (love vs. hate) and they are correct 
or incorrect (love is correct if its object is intrinsically 
worthy of being loved). This led Brentano to a con-
ception of ETHICS as a discipline parallel to LOGIC. His 
basic ideas in ethics were first published as a paper he 
delivered in Vienna in 1889 (Vom Ursprung sittlicher 
Erkenntnis; an English translation, Our Knowledge of 
Right and Wrong, already appeared in 1902). His ethics 
had a strong influence on MAX SCHELER and on G. E. 
Moore (1873~1958). 
In his !ater writings Brentano becamc more and 
more interested in developing his own ontology and 
theory of categories. He developed a position called 
"reism" according to which the basic category is that 
of res, which comprehends both concrete things and 
immaterial souls. This strict objectivistic attitude was 
initially not influential within the phenomenological 
movement, but it did become important for logic and 
ontology in POLAND. In recent years these ideas have 
had great influence on philosophers such as RODERICK 
CHISHOLM and BARRY SMITH. 
Of great influence on Husserl was Brentano 's the-
ory of wholes and parts, which he introduced in his 
"ontology," the second part of his Wurzburg lectures 
(in the 1870s Brentano inserted a descriptive part 
that he called "phenomenology" bctween the above-
mentioned "transcendental philosophy" and the "on-
tology"). Ontology has as its basic distinction that be-
tween collectiva and divisiva, which dichotomy is in 
turn classified as physical, logica!, and metaphysical. 
The influence on Husserl's FORMAL ANO MATERIAL ON-
TOLOGY as developed in the third ofhis Logische Un-
tersuchungen ( 1900-1901) is obvious, and it is likely 
that Husserl knew about these lectures via Stumpf, to 
whom he refers in this context and who had an exten-
sive copy ofthese lectures. 
The concept ofiNTENTIONALITY is only a problem-
atic link between Brentano and phenomenology. This 
is already indicated by the fact that Brentano !ater gave 
up the term "intentiona!" because he thought that his 
views in this connection had been misunderstood. As a 
matter offact Brentano does not talk about intention or 
intentionality, but rather uses expressions like "inten-
tiona! inexistence" or "intentionally contain" that he 
introduced in order to distinguish psychic phenomena 
from physical phenomena. An isolated quality such as 
red is a physical phenomenon; red as belonging to con-
sciousness is on the other hand a psychic phenomenon. 
Intentiona! inexistence can be regarded as a mereo-
logical concept on two different levels. On the descrip-
tive level, a psychic phenomenon is part of a complex 
consciousness to which belong, for instance, inner per-
ception, acts of judgment, and emotive acts; on the 
metaphysical level, which also embraces entities that 
are not immediately given but inferred, it is conceived 
as part of a soul. In contexts like "intentiona! inexis-
tence," the term "intentiona!" does not determine the 
related expression "inexistence" ( or "containment") 
but modifies it, i.e., it changes its original meaning. lf 
these words were used in this original meaning, the fol-
lowing conclusions would be valid: if something exists 
in something el se, then both things exist; if something 
is contained in something other than it, there is a spatial 
relation between them. In the modified context of"in-
tentional inexistence" and "intentiona! containment," 
however, both conclusions are invalid. The intentiona! 
relation is thus, as Brentano explains in !ater writings, 
only "something relation-like" (etwas Relativliches).lt

is not, as in Husserl 's intentiona] acts, a matter of direct-
edness toward an object transcendent to consciousness 
but, in contrast, something immanent to consciousness. 
The importance of Brentano for phenomenology 
and especially for Husserl !ies in his rigorous scien-
tific attitude toward psychic phenomena. The empha-
sis Brentano places on description paves the way for a 
"positive" science of consciousness that was not pos-
sible in the framework of KANT or of psychophysics. 
But Brentano was convinced that description of psy-
chic phenomena is possible only in terms of inner 
perception, i.e., of psychology. Such a concept was, 
however, not acceptable for Husserl since it seems to 
indicate PSYCHOLOGISM, which he analyzes as a form 
of skepticism. Such an accusation does not do justice 
to Brentano 's concept of in ner perception, which he 
intended precisely to serve as a bulwark against skep-
ticism. It is, however, true that this concept obstructs 
the view toward the intentiona! object, which can be 
distinguished by description from that which is im-
manent to consciousness. Husserl 's discovery of the 
intentiona! object led him to the question of its con-
stitution, a question that did not (and could not) arise 
for Brentano. This, however, is motivated by the dif-
ferent cultural backgrounds. For Brentano the idea of 
a (transcendental or psychic) constitution is unaccept-
able because it leads to subjectivism, Protestantism, 
or even atheism. Husserl, in contrast, was under the 
influence ofthe neo-Kantian Friedrich Paulsen ( 1846--
1908), who had written a philosophia militans against 
neo-Thomism and the concept of "Catholic science" 
as conceived by Brentano 's nephew Hertling. Husserl, 
who converted in the 1890s from Judaism to Protes-
tantism, did not feei bound to the objectivism held by 
Brentano. His own philosophy can rather be regarded 
as an endeavor to develop a ("Protestant") CONSTITU-
TIVE PHILOSOPHY as a rigorous science with Brentanian 
means such as description and part-whole theory.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
did state that Descartes and Hume exercised the great-
est influence on him, and that his philosophical inheri-
tance from MODERN PHILOSOPHY was tobe traced, not 
from Descartes to Kant, but from Descartes through 
Locke and Berkeley to Hume. He did severely and 
unceasingly criticize their "sensualism" and "psychol-
ogism," which he thought could lead only into the 
bankruptcy ofRELATIVISM and skepticism. On the other 
hand, he saw in these thinkers, espccially Hume, the 
only authentic forerunners of a "pure" phenomenology. 
In order to achieve a better understanding ofHusserl's 
development of phenomenology, the cumulative im-
pact of their positive contributions deserves examina-
tion. 
Around 1886, when Husserl began his philosoph-
ical career, PSYCHOLOGISM was the defining issue 
in German-speaking philosophical circles. In north-
ern Germany, where neo-Kantianism was beginning 
to gain ascendancy, most philosophers followed the 
Kantian tradition of rational idealism and rejected out-
right any attempt, however minimal, to link LOGIC, 
MATHEMATICS, and the NATURAL SCIENCES and the 
HUMAN SCIENCES to psychic expericnce. In southern 
Germany and AUSTRIA, however, neo-empiricism and 
neo-positivism had gained a strong foothold, and at-
tcmpts by such prominent thinkers as Wilhelm Wundt 
(1832~1920) and FRANZ BRENTANO were being made 
to ground logic and the sciences in general in psychol-
ogy. Husserl and REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY began 
in the latter context. 
From his undergraduate days Husserl knew and was 
favorably inclined toward classical British empiricism. 
At the outset, Husserl was influenced by John Stuart 
Miii 's psychological investigations into logic, although 
he Jost interest in him quickly. Howcver, the work of 
Alexander Ba in ( 1818-1903 ), a follower of Miii -
work Husserl knew through citations in Cari Stumpf 
(1848-1936)- was of great influence in Husserl's 
1907 lectures on the role of kinaesthesis in our ex-
perience of SPACE. In this early period Husserl was 
disinterested, even hostile, toward Kant and the ra-
tionalist tradition of German idealism. This initial out-
Jook was strengthened by his encounterwith Brentano, 
from whom he acquired the basic concepts of pure 
descriptive psychology and INTENTIONALITY. The em-
piricism of WILLIAM JAMES was also ofinterest to him 
early on. 
In his earliest writings, chief of which is Philoso-
phie der Arithmetik ( 1891 ), Husserl undertook descrip-
tive empirical-psychological analyses ofthe origins of 
the concept of number and other notions fundamental 
to arithmetic. While Brentano 's influence on Husserl 
should not be overlooked, the influence of Locke is 
most striking. In Husserl 's opinion Locke was the first 
systematically to undertake descriptive psychological 
analyses in order to ascertain the certainty and scope 
of human cognition. Locke's "extensive descriptions" 
aided Husserl in his search for the psychological ori-
gins ofnumber-concepts. 
But Husserl had already begun to change. At the 
beginning he shared with Brentano the belief that al-
though descriptive psychology was founded in an em-
pirica! intuition ofpsychic phenomena ("inner percep-
tion"), its conclusions were necessary and universal, 
i.e., a priori, and hence able to ground mathematics 
and logic. He claimed that the years 1886-95 were 
crucial in his dissociation from that psychologism and 
his breakthrough to a "pure" or "eidetic" phenomen-
ology in which mathematics and logic could legiti-
mately be grounded. Decisive for this breakthrough 
was Husserl's equating the a priori with evidentiat 
givenness in pure or eidetic intuition. A pure or eidetic 
intuition is an intuition of essence. Essence is char-
acterized by invariance. This insight Husserl claims to 
ha ve gleaned from Hume 's famous distinction between 
knowledge concern ing "relations of ideas" and knowl-
edge concern ing "matters of fact." In Husserl 's inter-
pretation Hume is asserting that reasoning concerning 
"matters offact" goes beyond what is purely immanent 
and hence intuitively given within consciousness by in-
voking the rationally unjustifiable "belief' in causality. 
Reasoning concerning "relations ofideas" is restricted 
to "ideas," that is to say, to what is in essence purely 
immanent and intuitively given. This sphere of pure 
eidetic immanence and intuitive givenness is ideal and 
the a priori; it is the sphere ofthe evident. This Humean 
separation ofthe ideal and the a priori from the factual 
and the empirica! Husserl maintains throughout his ca-
reer. Intentiona! analysis is always ideal and a priori; 
it is eidetic. This Humean linkage of the a priori with 
evidential immanence and givenness in consciousness 
motivates Husserl 's constant preoccupation with the a 
priori correlation between objectivity and its subjective 
modes of givenness. 

BRITISH EMPIRICISM 
77 
The years that followed up to 1900---1901, when the 
two volumes of the Logische Untersuchungen were 
first published, marked not only Husserl's definitive 
breakthrough to eidetic phenomenology but also a shift 
in his attention from purely psychological to logica! 
and epistemological questions. Psychological analysis 
ofthe origins of arithmetical concepts gave way to logi-
ca! and epistemological investigations in terms ofeide-
tic clarification. In using not an empirica! but rather an 
EIDETIC METHOO, Husserl moved beyond Brentano's 
empiricism and his somewhat passive view of inten-
tiona] consciousness to underscore its teleological dy-
namism and constitutive functionality. 
Although more open to Kant and the neo-Kantians, 
especially Paul Natorp (1854--1924 ), Husserl 's critique 
of the Kantian tradition of German idealism is even 
more penetrating. He was deeply interested in the Kan-
tian notion of"pure logic," especially as formulated by 
Natorp. But he faults their unquestioning reliance on 
Kant's mistaken and misleading version ofthe analytic-
synthetic and a priori~a posteriori distinctions, which 
can lead in Husserl 's opinion to a sheer formalistic 
logic that lacks the required grounding in that pure 
or a priori psychology that is eidetic phenomenology. 
In the six investigations that comprise the second part 
of Logische Untersuchungen, he attempts to supply 
this requisite grounding. The Second Investigation, in 
which he rejects the traditional view ofabstraction and 
generality to formulate the doctrine of ei dos and eidetic 
intuition, is pivotal. This entire investigation grew out 
of a sustained and intense confrontation with Locke, 
Berkeley, and Hume, and Hume's distinction between 
"relations of ideas" and "matters of fact" continued to 
play a pivotal role. 
During the years 1901 ~ 7 Husserl came to realize 
that in order to establish the ultimate a priori grounding 
of logic, mathematics, science, and cognition in gen-
eral, ali unwarrantable presuppositions must be over-
come through a radical consequent skepticism. Husserl 
discerns in the British empiricists, especially Hume, 
the beginnings of this skepticism, which alo ne will-
paradoxical as it may seem -
uncover the desired ul-
timate a priori ground. In his lecture series of 1906/07 
and other miscellaneous writings Husserl made clear 
that this ultimate a priori must ground both material and 
formal objectivities and hence the world's ontic sense 
and validity. Not only a formal apophantic but a FOR-
MAL ANO MATERIAL ONTOLOGY must be constructed by 
analyzing the intentional-constitutive performances of 
transcendental subjectivity. Husserl also introduced for 
the first time the concepts ofthe "EPOCHE ANO REOUC-
TION," which are central to transcendental phenomen-
ology in this lecture series, published now as Ein!eitung 
in die Logik und Erkenntnistheorie. 
In this breakthrough to a transcendental-static 
phenomenology Husserl demonstrates his increasingly 
greater affinity and indebtedness to the British thinkers. 
He stated explicitly that Kant, Natorp, and others in the 
rationalist tradition of German idealism lacked the con-
cepts of"epoche" and "reduction." These concepts can 
be uncovered only by practicing Descartes's approach 
to the problem of cognition even more rigorously than 
Descartes himself. The requisite deepening and con-
cretizing ha ve been achieved to a marked extent by the 
classical British empiricists. Despite his empirica! real-
ism and dualism, Locke was the first systematically to 
undertake a purely immanent and intuitionistic reflec-
tion on the human cognitive powers. What motivates 
Locke, according to Husserl, is the desire to clarify 
the "sense" and validity of cognition by investigating 
its intuitive evidential origins in concrete conscious-
ness. With his "immaterialism" and phenomenalism, 
Berkeley corrected and advanced Locke's insight. But 
Husserl credits Hume for the monumental achievement 
of countering dogmatic rationalism and objectivism 
that culminates in Kant and ofhaving shown that only 
in strict immanence and intuitionism can the means be 
found, ifthey are tobe found at ali, to overcome skep-
ticism and to establish philosophy as rigorous science. 
Yet again Husserl credits Hume's distinction between 
"relations of ideas" and "matters of fact" for linking 
the a priori to evidential givenness in constitutive intu-
ition and thereby providing the key for overcoming ali 
vestiges of dualism and skepticism. As Husserl stated 
more than once during this 190 l~ 7 period, the "British 
psychologists" appear to be the authentic forerunners 
of phenomenology. 
During the period 1908~20 Husserl widened the 
scope of his constitutive analyses in order to inves-
tigate the possibility of valid cognition in ali possible 
areas but primarily in the area ofperceptual experience. 
These analyses can be found chiefly in the three vol-
umes ofthe Jdeen zu einer reinen Phiinomenologie und 
phiinomeno!ogischen Philosophie, which were drafted 

78 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
in 1912. From these analyses initially Husserl carne to 
realize that intentiona! constitution occurs on multiple 
different levels, and that the ro le ofsynthesis in CONSTI-
TUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY is crucial. This seems to ac-
count for a much more favorable attitude on Husserl's 
part to the Kantian tradition during this period. Kant's 
separation ofthe a priori operative on the level of sense 
intuition from that operative on the level of pure un-
derstanding and his emphasis on a priori synthesis also 
impressed Husserl deeply. 
Yet Husserl 's indebtedness to the British empiri-
cists, and especially Hume, remains noteworthy dur-
ing this period. He stated that Hume helped him to see 
more clearly the central problem facing transcenden-
tal phenomenology: how can concrete consciousness in 
its pure immanence intend and even intuit transcendent 
objects? To meet this problem Husserl developed the 
notion of a priori intentiona! constitution. This consti-
tutive a priori, in similar fashion to the eidetic a priori, 
is grounded in evidential intuition in which essences 
are constituted as unities of ontic sense. As he did 
to introduce the notion of an eidetic a priori, Husserl 
again invokes Hume's distinction between "relations 
ofideas" and "matters offact" to show how the consti-
tutive a priori grounds on the transcendental level the 
intuitive and hence evidential givenness of transcen-
dent objects as unities of sense. 
Reasoning concerning transcendent objects cannot 
be factual and empirica!; Hume has shown that al! 
such reasoning is vitiated by an unjustifiable "belief." 
Valid knowledge of transcendent objects can be had 
only insofar as they are ideal unities of sense. Accord-
ing to Hume, "ideas," the purely immanent and intu-
itively given, do not form a unity; they are interrelated 
a priori and form an ideal unity through "comparison." 
Similarly, for Husserl an ideal unity of sense is not 
pre-given; it is constituted a priori in transcendental 
consciousness. By uncovering its constitutive a pri-
ori origins in consciousness, that ideal unity of sense 
(the transcendent object) is brought to intuitive and 
hence evidential givenness. For this reason in Husserl 's 
"Nachwort zu meinen 'Ideen'" (appearing in Husserl's 
Jahrbuch in 1930 and in the English translation ofthe 
first book of the ldeen in 1931 ), Hume 'sA Treatise of 
Human Nature is acclaimed as an actual transcendental 
phenomenology despite its sensualistic flaw. 
In addition, Husserl claims that both Berkeley and 
Hume transcended the psychic in the purely natu-
ralistic and realistic sense and had advanced, albeit 
in an incomplete and unclear way, toward the con-
cept of transcendental subjectivity. The distinction be-
tween psychological and transcendental subjectivity 
was pivotal for Husserl's own advance from eidetic to 
transcendental-static phenomenology. Moreover, when 
he made his final advance around 1920 from static 
to genetic transcendental phenomenology, Husserl re-
stored the British empiricists to their accustomed pre-
eminent place in his thought. 
This renewed close affinity from 1920 onward with 
the British thinkers resulted from a transformation in 
the important notions mentioned above of multilevel 
constitution and synthesis. Husserl now saw that the 
levels of a priori transcendental constitution are hierar-
chically ordered so that the constitutive levels ofpred-
icative experience, particularly in the are as oflogic and 
science in general, are "founded" on the lower levels 
of pre-predicative experience and the 1 i feworld. Uni ike 
Locke, Berkeley, and above al! Hume, Kant failed to 
see the necessity of grounding the world of science in 
the LIFEWORLD. Again, while Kant restricted his anal-
ysis to active synthesis, Husserl emphasized passive 
synthesis in his GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY, foreshad-
owings of which he found in the associationist psy-
chologies of the British empiricists. 
To give a somewhat more detailed account of 
Husserl's final stage of genetic transcendental pheno-
menology and its connection to the three British em-
piricists, we shall begin by focusing on 1920--27 when 
the theory of "genetic analysis" first surfaced unam-
biguously. We are blessed with a wealth of explicit 
references to the British thinkers. Many ofthese refer-
ences are quite critica! of their psychological empiri-
cism, but the positive comments are more frequent and 
more significant. 
In Husserl 's eyes Locke was an original and cre-
ative thinker, a true pioneer in developing concretely 
the Cartesian turn to the ego by a multifaceted reflec-
tion that is strictly immanent since grounded in pure 
inner experience. Notwithstanding his naive empirica] 
dualism and realism, Locke was the first to attempt to 
formulate an immanent and intuitionistic philosophy 
based on the direct inner experience of the concrete 
EGO and its essential conscious performances in order 
to certify the claims ofthe sciences and human cogni-

BRITISH EMPIRICISM 
79 
tion in general to objective validity. Despite the fact that 
he failed to develop the concepts of intentiona! consti-
tution and transcendental reduction and fell into tran-
scendental psychologism, Locke's valiant attempt to 
ground the objective validity of science and cognition 
in general in such a purely immanent and intuitionist 
reflection foreshadowed Husserl 's own transcendental-
genetic phenomenology. Moreover, Locke's positive 
impact on Berkeley and Hume was immense. 
According to Husserl, Berkeley, despite his egre-
gious errors, did advance beyond Locke by rejecting 
dogmatic dualism and realism and by locating the an-
tic sense and validity of transcendent objectivity in 
the conscious performances of the concrete perceiv-
ing ego. More emphatically than Locke, Berkeley un-
derlined the active constitutive factor involved in the 
immanent intuition of a given abject. But during this 
period it was Hume's skeptical philosophy that was 
the prime catalyst for Husserl 's development of ge-
netic phenomenology. 
Husserl saw that to establish philosophy as rigorous 
science he must surmount Hume's skepticism by prob-
ing even more radically into human consciousness. In 
Hume's thought Husserl saw mirrored his own demand 
to seek in the pure immanence of the transitory con-
scious acts the ground of that phenomenal synthetic 
unity of sense called "world" to which transcendence 
and objectivity are assigned. To resolve the problem-
atic of objectivity and transcendence Hume appealed 
to association, Husserl to a priori intentiona! constitu-
tion. Once again Husserl invoked Hume's distinction 
between "relations of ideas" and "matters of fact" to 
overcome mathematizing rationalism and to clarify the 
distinction between pure rational and causal necessity. 
Even if he failed to see that even passive constitution 
is eidetic or a priori, still Hume did highlight the pri-
mordial role of passive, pre-predicative synthesis or 
association. 
There are no radical developments in Husserl's as-
sessment of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume in the final 
years, 1928-38. What does emerge is a more explicit 
and definitive formulation by Husserl of his own rad-
ical transcendental empiricism and subjectivism. That 
the British empiricists have continued to play an im-
portant role can be seen in the two major texts from 
this last period in Husserl 's career, though, as already 
mentioned, the "Nachwort" to Jdeen 1 is also relevant. 
In Formale und transzendentale Logik ( 1929) 
Husserl attacks German rationalism, exemplified by 
Kant, for its dogmatism and objectivism. Kant failed 
to take into account Locke 's pioneering work, and con-
sequently did not work through the problem of tran-
scendental psychologism. Husserl praises his pioneer-
ing work in turn ing philosophical reflection toward the 
pure description ofthe psychic acts ofthe concrete em-
pirica! ego, and credits Hume for building on Locke's 
approach in order to demonstrate that objectivity has 
its genesis in concrete subjectivity. Thereby Hume 
rai sed the fundamental question that drove Husserl to a 
transcendental-genetic phenomenology: how can tran-
scendent objectivity be constituted in its ontic sense 
and validated in evidential intuition within the pure 
immanence ofthe concrete ego? For Hume that spatio-
temporal unity that is the "real" world of experience 
is not simply given; it is constructed in my imagina-
tion in accordance with the fundamental principles of 
association. These psychologically necessary and uni-
versal principles "are really to us the cement of the 
universe." For Husserl the real world of experience is 
pre-given but not pre-constituted; it is constituted in 
my factually existent ego. But the principles accord-
ing to which this "lifeworld" is constituted are not 
psychological and hence merely factual; psychologi-
cal necessity, as Hume plainly saw, cannot assure truth 
and certainty. The necessity must be ideal and a priori 
in the Humean sense. This ideal and a priori necessity 
is verified through an eidetic clarification of the con-
stitutive performances ofthe concrete ego; this eidetic 
clarification brings these a priori performances to pure 
immanence and evidential givenness. 
In Die Krisis der europaischen Wissenschaften und 
die transzendentale Phanomenologie ( 1936), Husserl 
yet aga in credits Hume-and, to a lesser extent, Locke 
and Berkeley -
for overcoming Kantian rationalism 
and objectivism and for showing the necessity of trans-
form ing ali scientific objectivism into an authentic tran-
scendental subjectivism. Rightly interpreted, the skep-
tical empiricism introduced by Locke, continued by 
Berkeley, and deepened by Hume revives and radical-
izes the Cartesian turn to the ego so that ali forms of 
objectivism, including the mathematizing objectivism 
of contemporary science, are shaken to their founda-
tion, and the world comes to be seen as having the 
origins of its "ontic sense" and validity in concrete 

80 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
empirica! subjectivity. Hume and Berkeley are to be 
praised above al! others for placing in question what 
seemed obvious to Kant and his followers- the cer-
tainty of the lifeworld in which science and theoreti-
cal cognition are grounded. To have penetrated to the 
enigma of a "world" whose ontic sense and validity 
have their genesis in the subjective accomplishments 
ofthe concrete ego is Hume's magisterial contribution 
to the theory of cognition. 
At the very beginning Husserl adopted Locke's view 
that philosophical reflection must be restricted to a gen-
uinely immanent investigation of acts of conscious-
ness. With Berkeley and Hume he excluded any form 
of epistemological dualism. Objectivity was tobe ac-
counted for in the manner ofthese British thinkers: by 
seeking its origins in the conscious performances of 
the subject. That his analyses are eidetic, and hence 
ideal and a priori, Husserl attributes to Hume's influ-
ence. Yet it is precisely the ideal and a priori character 
of Husserl's analyses that accounts for his disagree-
ments with these British empiricists. Since their analy-
ses were empiro-psychological, their conclusions were 
vitiated by sensualism and both logica! and transcen-
dental psychologism. The outcome of their analyses 
can only be relativism and skepticism. 
From this survey of the positive impact of Locke, 
Berkeley, and Hume it becomes clear why Husserl 's 
phenomenology might be entitled a "transcendental 
empiricism" rather than a "transcendental idealism." 
But it also reveals the huge risk Husserl took in mod-
eling his own approach, especially in the !ater stages 
ofhis development, on the tradition of classical British 
empiricism. Did he succeed in overcoming the solip-
sism and skepticism that he claimed the British empiri-
cists did not? 
RAM A. MALL has compared Husserl to Hume to 
show the programmatic similarity of their philoso-
phies. RICHARD T. MURPHY has undertaken to assess 
systematically Hume 's impact on Husserl, particularly 
in his turn to a genetic phenomenology. He credits 
Hume for Husserl 's turn toward radical subjectivism 
and questions whether Husserl has overcome skepti-
cism any more that Hume did. J. DOUGLAS RABB has 
argued that Locke 's notion of reflection has been mis-
understood and that it is closer to the phenomenologi-
cal notion of reflexive awareness than to introspection. 
In explaining the paradox oftranscendence within im-
manence central to intentionality, ARON GURWITSCH 
emphasizes Husserl's indebtedness to Hume for the 
notion ofimmanence and uses Hume's teaching in his 
explanation. DAVID MICHAEL LEVIN links Husserl's the-
ory of evidence to Hume's empirist concept. He also 
mentions how Husserl 's notion of immanence, which 
he took from Hume, makes his own notion of radical 
evidence problematic. DALLAS WILLARD, among oth-
ers, has also emphasized the importance of Hume for 
Husserl 's notion of the a priori. Willard states that it 
has shaped Husserl's view on logic and cognition in 
general. And finally, CHARLES HARYEY, among others, 
has connected Husserl 's development of the epoche 
and reduction to Humean skepticism. 
Many philosophers, especially from ANALYTIC PHI-
LOSOPHY, ha ve ignored phenomenology as being but 
another school within the obsolete Kantian tradition 
of German idealism. Awareness of Husserl's roots in 
classical British empiricism may dispel that illusion. 
That Husserl 's phenomenological formulation of cen-
tral philosophical concepts and theories -
reflection, 
generality, a priori, evidence, intuition, immanence, 
etc. -
occur within the context of his relationship to 
classical British empiricism should help to bridge the 
gap between phenomenology and analytic philosophy. 
We are convinced that Husserl 's teachings in particu-
lar could contribute to the current "analytic" disputes 
on the notion of the a priori, on rational evidence and 
intuition, and on immanence and reflection.

BRITISH MORAL THEORY 
There is an inher-
ent phenomenological tendency in British moral the-
ory, especially from John Locke onward. The purpose 
of his Essay ( 1690) was, he said, to consider the dis-
cerning faculties of a human being as they are em-
ployed about the objects they have to do with. This is 
language that might serve well in a general description 
of the work of EDMUND HUSSERL and other phenome-
nologists. 
In carrying out his purpose, Locke developed his 
empiricist theory that ali our "ideas," and hence ali 
knowledge, originale from "experience," a type of con-
scious act or event that he never adequately character-
ized, but simply divided into sensation (sense percep-
tion) and reflection (the "feeling" of our own mental 
acts and states). He and numerous subsequent British 
philosophers then made significant application of this 
essentially unclarified empiricism to moral judgment, 
assuming that our ideas and knowledge about those 
states, acts, and powers or dispositions of the self that 
are subject to moral assessment must derive from re-
flective awareness of such states and acts. Frequently 
the moral judgment itself is treated as something gras-
pable by reflection. 
While this phenomenological tendency is never sys-
tematically exploited or methodologically clarified in 
the manner of Husserl, etc., it often comes sharply 
into play against the speculative and constructionist 
claims of moral theorists such as Thomas Hobbes 
( 1588-1679) and Jeremy Bentham (1748-1842), who 
fairly represent thc antiphenomenological tendency in 
British moral theory. On occasion it gives rise to what 
certainly has the character of "eidetic" analyses of the 
moral judgment or experience and its objects. 
In his theory ofknowledge Locke lays a foundation 
for a phenomenology of the moral life, but does little 
to build upon it. The morally central conceptions of 
good and evi!, virtue, and law are ali explained by him 
with a mixture of stipulation, dogmatism, speculation, 
and unrefined introspection that ha ve almost as little to 
do with his announced empiricist methods as it does 
with phenomenological o nes. Sti li, the general outlines 
ofhis thought, and especially his "ideas ofreflection," 
open the way for the many !ater "psychological" ap-
peals in moral theory to what one "finds" in oneself 
upon reflection-especially as they concern the balance 
between egoistic, altruistic, and other motives and the 
nature and object of the moral judgment. 
Henry Sidgwick (1838-1900) states that the third 
earl of Shaftesbury (Anthony Ashley Cooper [1671-
1713]) was the first moralist who distinctly took "psy-
chological experience" as the basis of ethics, and 
that this approach was carried onward through But-
ler, Hutcheson, Hume, and 19th century utilitarianism. 
That is basically correct, though we need to add that the 
earlier thinkers on this list were freer from domination 
by assumptions about what must be the case in moral 
experience and judgment than the !ater ones. Bentham 
and John Stuart Miii ( 1806-1873) in particular, the two 
main utilitarians, are more characterized, in their writ-
ings on moral theory, by psychological constructions 
and dogmatism than by description. 
Shaftesbury actually opens his Inquiry ( 1699) with 
abstract reasoning about the good in terms of part, 
whole, and end. But he soon moves to the descriptive 
finding that when actions and affections come before 
the mind as objects another kind of affection arises, 
one bearing upon those very actions and affections 
themselves. They become the object of a new liking or 
disliking, based upon their character as benefiting or 
harming the human species or public, inclusi ve of the 
agent. Moral worth and the virtues of persons consist in 
their having a properly balanced and overall inclination 
toward the good of the social system of which they 
are a part and the individual's good in that system. 
While the presence ofthis "new" moralliking or moral 
sense seems to be a discovery of reflection, most of 
what Shaftesbury presents remains within the domain 
of abstract reasoning from concepts. 
Francis Hutcheson (1694-1747) provides what is 
essentially a development of Shaftesbury's system. 
However, in his Inquiry ( 1725) he flatly identifies 
virtue, or thc object ofthe moral affection, with benev-
olence. The kindly affections of rational agents imme-
diately evoke an esteem or perception in us that is dif-
ferent in kind from ali other appreciations of goodness

that may occur. In particular, it has no connnection 
with personal advantage or desire to possess. While 
he offers many arguments against opposing views or 
moral distinctions, the existence ofthis special "moral 
sense" and the determination of what its object is is 
clearly something that Hutcheson rests upon reflec-
tion. As he says, "Our hearts must decide the matter," 
and we read our hearts by reflection. 
Joseph Butler ( 1692-1752) provides us with some 
of the best descriptive points in the history of British 
moral theory. He certainly argues, and often from ab-
stract conceptions, such as that of a systematic whole 
and the roles of its parts -
especially as found in 
the human being. But the specifically Butlerian points 
usually come to rest upon appeals to descriptive differ-
ences in experiences and their objects and to reflection 
upon such differences. The opening paragraphs of his 
Dissertation an Virtue ( 1736) make the strongest pos-
sible statements to the effect that we have a specific 
capacity for reflecting on actions and characters, or 
for "making them an object of our thought," and that 
such reflection naturally gives rise to approval or dis-
approval of its peculiar objects; in his Sermons ( 1726) 
he says that the existence of the capacity or faculty 
"is certain from our experiencing it in ourselves and 
recognizing it in each other"- that is, from a certain 
metareflection. He proceeds with detailed elaboration 
of this faculty and its objects, concluding that there is 
a wide range of actions and states that find approval 
from the faculty ofreflection, including self-interested 
actions and those that arise from particular appetites 
and passions, in appropriate circumstances. 
Often Butler 's descriptions and inferences are so in-
termingled that one must take great care to sort them 
out. But his whole line of argument can be supported 
only on what from the phenomenological point ofview 
are rightly called descriptions of essence. One of his 
retorts to psychological egoism, for example, is that 
pain and pleasure have nothing essentially to do with 
self-love (egoism), that "the feelings themselves, the 
pain ofhunger or shame, and the delight from esteem, 
are no more self-love than they are anything in the 
world." The famous Butlerian dictum, "everything is 
what it is, and not another thing"- so badly used by 
G. E. Moore 's ( 1873-1958) association of it with his 
own views in Principia Ethica (1903)-walks hand in 
hand, as Butler understood it, with the phenomenologi-
cal slogan, "to the matters themselves." The essential 
distinctions between conscious states or acts and their 
objects that are relevant to moral theory are ultimately, 
for Butler, to be determined by an intuitive reflective 
awareness that gives us their essences. 
David Hume is close to Butler in this respect, and 
bases much of his moral theory on reflective analy-
sis. Section I ofhis Enquiry ( 1748) concern ing morals 
states his aim of settling the question about "the true 
origin of morals," and of finding the universal princi-
ples that form the "foundation ofethics," by analyzing 
the complex of mental qualities that form what he calls 
"Personal Merit." To settle any doubt as to whether 
a given quality enters into Personal Merit is a simple 
matter: "One needs only enter his own breast for a 
moment" to determine if one would desi re to ha ve the 
quality ascribed to oneself. The "experimental" method 
that Hume proposes to follow, in imitation of the natu-
ral sciences of his day, proceeds then to establish gen-
eral maxims ofmorals from a comparison of particular 
cases. The parallels with the EIDETIC METHOD peculiar 
to phenomenology are obvious, though Hume retains 
his nominalism. 
He takes his "inner observations" to show that all 
mental traits that evoke the sentiment of moral ap-
proval are useful or immediately agreeable, either to 
oneself or to others. This is his primary generalization 
in the foundation of ethics. It obviously presupposes 
that the moral sentiment of approval is capable of be-
ing independently identified for what it is in its own 
right- perhaps in the manner of redness, sweetness, 
and pain. It is similar for the mental qualities that make 
up Personal Merit. Ali that is left, then, is to observe, 
by reflection on the course of our experience, how that 
approval ( or disapproval) does or does not show up 
in response to the various mental qualities ( e.g., jus-
tice, benevolence) contemplated in people. Needless 
to say, such a procedure could never yield a basis for 
true generalizations apart from some essentialist frame-
work. Hume's procedure and conclusions suggest that 
he is in fact presupposing such a framework in reach-
ing the moral theory he does, regardless of his official 
rejections of it. 
Descriptive analysis comes into play at many other 
points in Hume's discussions ofmorals-for example, 
when he gives in the Treatise ( 1739) an explanation 
of why people are misled into thinking that reason is 

BRITISH MORAL THEORY 
83 
practica! because calm passions, which do influence the 
will, resemble reason so greatly that they are mistaken 
for it. Description is also at stake when he claims, in 
that same work, that you cannot find vice in an act of 
willful murder, but do find "it" when you "turn your 
reflections into your own breast, and there discover 
a sentiment of disapprobation, which arises in you, 
toward this action." In these and multitudes of other 
points of detail he shows his reliance upon descriptive 
distinctions of essence. 
Hume's views have been sharply criticized by con-
temporaries and by successors in British moral theory, 
up to the present day, but rarely on the basis of descrip-
tive analyses of moral experience and its objects. Adam 
Smith ( 1723-1790) actually does disagree with Hume 
about the basic structure of Personal Merit on the bases 
of descriptive analyses of moral phenomena. He holds 
that there is an underivative sense of propriety that is 
more fundamental to moral distinctions than utility is. 
Thomas Reid (171~1796) and Richard Price (1723-
1791 ), in opposition to Hume, treat the moral sense or 
faculty as a cognitive faculty, nota sentiment, and hold 
that our ideas are not confined to what we can derive 
from "experience" in Locke's sense. But they, unlike 
Smith, really do belong in the earlier Platonist tradition 
ofHenry More (1614--1687), Ralph Cudworth (1617-
1688), and Samuel Clarke (16 75-1729), as well as the 
!ater tradition of"intuitionism" from William Whewell 
( 1794--1866) and Sidgwick to Moore and W. D. Ross 
( 1877-1971) in the 20th century. 
The essentialist aspect in ali ofthese thinkers is quite 
at home in the eidetic atmosphere of phenomenology. 
Henry More, in his Enchiridion Ethicum ( 1666), even 
uses the term "NOEMA" to apply to the directly evident 
axioms of ali ethical reasoning. But this tradition is, 
to say the least, not strong on the descriptive analyses 
of experience. Reid and Price, however, seem to have 
learned something from the practice oftheir empiricist 
adversaries. One occasionally finds important passages 
in their works where descriptive analysis of moral ex-
perience plays a crucial role- for example, in Reid's 
discussions of"the esteem which we ha ve for a man on 
account of his moral worth," in chapter 7 of the third 
essay On The Active Powers ( 1788), and in Price's dis-
cussion ofwhat sense (sensation) consists of in section 
ii ofchapter 1 ofhis Review (1758). Price on occasion 
shows astonishing similarities to Husserl 's practice and 
understanding of the analysis of ei de, but without any 
corresponding methodological sophistication. 
We ha ve mentioned Bentham and Mi li as paradigm 
cases of non-phenomenological moral theorists. 
Hume's Treatise was a major influence on the young 
Bentham, but only bccause he found Hume's idea of 
utili~v to be a core around which he could organize 
a theory of morality that would serve as a basis for 
the legal and social reforms he saw tobe necessary. He 
dropped the subtleties ofHume 's "psychological" anal-
yses and conclusions, specified utility to be the only 
moral consideration, and added hedonism as a theory 
of value. Bentham is like Hobbes in that he presents 
constructions or stipulative definitions as if they were 
general truths that have been established and tries to 
throw the burden of proof onto those who would say 
his views are wrong (see chapter 1 of Principles of 
Morals and Legislation [ 1789]). Mi li is certainly a far 
more careful thinker, but he is hardly any stronger in 
willingness or ability to do justice to the "descriptive 
facts" of moral experience and its objects. 
Henry Sidgwick ( 1838-1900) began his work as a 
disciple (his term) of Mi li, but he was unable to accept 
Mill's account of our duty to choose the general happi-
ness. He soon found himselfforced to base that duty on 
a special intuition, not on utilitarian considerations. He 
adopted much ofButler's account of moral experience, 
which allowed various motivations- personal happi-
ness, the general good, as well as "particular appetites 
and passions" -
ali to be morally acceptable under 
appropriate circumstances. In working out a modified 
form of utilitarianism in his Methods ( 1893 ), one that 
rests on the above and other non-utilitarian intuitions, 
he gives an analysis ofthe meaning ofmoraljudgments 
that contains significant phenomenological elements. 
He provides arguments against the view that "ought" 
and "right," and judgments containing them, deal with 
physical or psychic facts, "facts ofthe sensible world." 
Thus naturalism, including hedonism, is rejected. But 
for a positive understanding of what "oughtness" or 
"rightness" is, "appeal must ultimately be made to the 
reflection of individuals on their practica! judgments 
and reasonings." The basic moral concepts are "too el-
ementary" to admit of any formal definition. "Ought" 
refers to a relation that must be "taken as ultimate and 
unanalyzable." Some clarification of it can be gained 
by plotting its relationships to other concepts, but ul-

84 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
timately we can know what it is only by viewing it 
reflectively and grasping its essence by abstraction. 
Once we know what "ought" refers to, three general 
principles-ofJustice, Prudence, and Rational Benev-
olence -
exhibit at least a degree of self-evidence, 
"immediately cognizable by abstract intuition." But 
"direct reflection" also shows us that certain more spe-
cific propositions, such as "I ought to speak the truth," 
are not self-evident and require justification from ap-
propriate premises. The role of direct reflection and 
abstractive intuition in Sidgwick's analyses of moral 
phenomena and the meanings of moral concepts and 
judgments is so great that he stands second only to But-
ler and Hume among British moralists in the weight he 
gives to essentially phenomenological considerations. 
Although some have regarded the "meaning analy-
sis" characteristic of British moral theory from Sidg-
wick up to the last quarter of the 20th century as 
strongly similar to phenomenological analysis in terms 
of"INTENTIONALITY ," the actual practice of ANALYTIC 
PHILOSOPHY is radically distinct from phenomenology 
in a way that the work of earlier British moralists 
clearly was not. 
As to the ro le of British moral theory in the pheno-
menological movement, one must note, first of ali, the 
degree to which FRANZ BRENTANO and his successors 
were aware of an essential affinity between their own 
descriptive analyses of experience and the work of the 
British empiricists. Brentano's Psychologie vom em-
pirischen Standpunkt (1874) is heavily indebted in its 
methodology to the work of Locke, Miii, Sir William 
Hamilton (1788-1856), and Alexander Bain ( 1818-
1903 ), and Brentano continues to embrace a psycho-
logical approach in his writings on ethics. The ethical 
work of Brentano and his students also evinces, how-
ever, a component that is absent from the British tradi-
tion: a concern with intrinsic value, and with the laws 
governing "correct" and "incorrect" emotion. This psy-
chologically based axiologica! approach to ethics and 
value phenomena is further elaborated by Alexius 
Meinong (1853-1920) and by EDMUND HUSSERL in 
his Jectures on ETHICS and VALUE THEORY. In the latter 
we find a detailed statement of the parallelisms be-
tween formal axiology on the one hand and formal 
LOGIC and formal ontology on the other. Husserl in ad-
dition criticizes what he sees as the PSYCHOLOGISM in 
Humean empiricism, because the latter does not allow 
the sciences of experience to be grounded in a priori 
necessities. He defends instead an "absolutist" ethical 
theory, and especially in his politica! philosophy he 
comes close to Hobbes and to a view ofthe philosophy 
ofthe state as found on a priori principles analogous to 
those of geometry. 
Perhaps the most systematic treatment of ethical 
categories on the basis of the phenomenological de-
scription of experience is put forward by MAX SCHELER 
in his Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die materiale 
Wertethik (Formalism in ethics and non formal ethics of 
values, 1913/ 1916). Phenomeno1ogy, as Sche1er con-
ceives it, is a way of doing philosophy that allows us 
to grasp the value and significance that is, in his eyes, 
endemic to the world ofhuman experience. We cannot 
try deliberately to observe these MEANINGs or values 
in intellectualistic fashion, and we cannot try to use the 
instruments of logic and science in order to build up 
theories about these things. For in order to use logic or 
thinking to observe entities ofthe given sort, we would 
have to have grasped them already, and the only way 
we can grasp them is via feeling and intuition. 
Finally, we may note that in his Essay an the Intel-
lectual Powers of Man ( 1785), Thomas Reid ( 1710--
1796) deve1ops a doctrine ofwhat he calls "social op-
erations" or "social acts," which concern the system-
atic ways in which human beings use language non-
descriptively or "non-propositionally." This occurs for 
example in questioning, in plighting, threatening, sup-
plicating and bargaining, in acts expressing acceptance 
or refusal, in acts of giving testimony, and above ali in 
commands and promises. 
Similarly, ADOLF REINACH developed a theory of 
"social acts" (!ater called "speech acts" or "per-
formative utterances" by John Austin [1911-1960] 
and John Searle) in his "Die apriorischen Grundla-
gen des burgerlichen Rechtes," published in Husserl 's 
Jahrbuch in 1913. Like Reid, Reinach takes the phe-
nomenon ofpromising as the central object ofhis a pri-
ori descriptive analyses, and he sees the setting out of 
the essential connections governing this phenomenon 
as the basis of an a priori theory of the entire domain 
of social interaction. Reinach criticizes the Humean 
analysis of promising as the expression of an act of 
will, and he points out that the quasi-legal formations 
of claim and obligation associated with every promise 
can never be reduced to mere habits, feelings, or be-

liefs. On the other hand, in his 1911 essay "Kants Auf-
fassung des Humeschen Problems," Reinach defends 
Hume against common misinterpretations and shows 
that Hume had a sophisticated understanding of the a 
priori connections governing basic mental phenomena. 
In this respect too, therefore, the affinity is maintained 
between British empiricism and phenomenology as de-
scriptive analyses of experience.

BUDDHISM 
The teachings ofSakyamuni Gau-
tama (463-383 B.C. or 560-480 B.C.), who lived in 
what is now Nepal, gave rise to Buddhism. Despite 
various developments, the fundamental truth through-
out its history is Dharma, while the person who expe-
riences the truth and is fully aware of it is called the 
Buddha (awakened one). 
There is some affinity between Buddhism and ED-
MUND HUSSERL 's phenomenology. For both, truth is 
concealed in aur usual daily life. For the truth to be 
revealed it is necessary to change aur attitude toward 
the world and ourselves. The method to effect this 
change, which is called transcendental EPOCHE ANO 
REDUCTION in phenomenology, corresponds to "Zen" 
in Buddhism. Zen (dhyana in Sanskrit,jhiina in Pali) is 
a form of meditation combining a well-ordcred body, 
well-ordered breathing, and a well-ordered mind. A 
person sits in the correct Zen position, breathes in and 
out slowly, deeply, and with awareness, and makes his 
or her mind free of ali attachments. When body and 
mind become quiet and in harmony, a free, dynamic 
insight begins and deepens little by little, leading to 
awakening. 
Zen is therefore not awakening, but it is a way to 
it. In concentrated Zen meditation, humans distance 
themselves from their usual preconceived ideas about 
the world, which are the basis of ali their attachments 
and prejudices about things of the world. On the other 
hand, transcendental epoche begins with the "bracket-
ing" (Einklammerung) of the existence of the world, 
which is generally accepted in the natural attitude. 
Therefore we could say that the transcendental epoche 
is parallcl to Zen insofar as it holds that aur precon-
ceived view ofthe world is suspended. 
But transcendental epoche and Zen di[fer in the fol-
Jowing respect. In Husserl's epoche the person looks 
at the consciousness of the world as the pure stream 
of his or her thoughts, on the one hand, and the pure 
EGO in the act of thinking, on the other hand. As a 
result, the view ofthe existing world usually taken for 
granted is suspended, opening the way for analyzing 
the constituting activity ofthe pure ego as transcenden-
tal subjcctivity. This ego can be called "transcendental 
subjectivity" because it grasps its constitutive accom-
plishments reflectively, and this understanding itself is 
the ultimate origin of ali knowledge of the world. 
In contrast, in Zen meditation humans will reach

ENCYCLOPED!A OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the world as it really is. Going back to transcenden-
tal subjectivity would be for the Buddhist a reflective 
abstraction; the world cannot be reduced to the corre-
lating phenomena oftranscendental-subjective accom-
plishments. One's unique experience through medita-
tion leads to finding one's own and the world's real 
way of existence. This difference between Husserl's 
phenomenology and Buddhism seems to be based on 
the understanding of "self." For Husserl, the essential 
function of se! fis intellectual or rational, while for Bud-
dhism it is from beginning to end- until awakening 
-a unity ofbody and mind. 
The essence of Sakyamuni 's awakening or enlight-
enment is "to see Dharma." Dharma (Sanskrit) or 
dhamma (Pali) comes from the verb "dh~·" and in the 
Hindu tradition means something that holds or sup-
ports. The term has a wide range of meanings: uni-
versal truth or religious norms, social norms, norms 
of behavior, etc. In other words, it refers to what is 
generally regarded as good or right. 
The Buddhist usage ofthe term Dharma is basically 
the same as Hinduism 's. In Buddhism Dharma signifies 
both the truth realized by Sakyamuni and the nature of 
this truth as expounded by him. The essence of this 
truth or teaching is in the following verse. 
AII things are born of causes, and of these 
the Tathagata (= the one who has realized the 
truth) has proclaimed the cause, 
And their extinction too: thus does the Great 
Ascetic speak. 
This verse is generally known as "The Verse of[the 
Law of] Dependent Co-Arising" (Pratftyasamutpiida-
giithii), sin ce it proclaims the principle of dependent co-
arising (said to have been realized by Sakyamuni under 
the Bo tree). This principle states that aii phenomena 
are born of various causes and conditions and that if 
these causes and conditions disappear, the phenomena 
themselves will also disappear. 
The Law of Dependent Co-Arising is usually 
thought of as Buddha-Dharma, i.e., the truth ofBuddha 
Sakyamuni. Thus far, the usage of the term "Dharma" 
follows Hinduism. At the same time, it should also 
be noted that in the above verse a new usage of the 
term "Dharma" appears. The original word for "things" 
is dharmiih (the plural of dharma). This usage of 
"Dharma" to mean "thing" or "phenomenon" is pe-
culiar to Buddhism and unknown to Hinduism. 
It is significant that in Buddhism both truth and an 
individual thing are called Dharma. We could interpret 
this as follows: what Sakyamuni realized and taught 
is truth, but at the same time it is reality inseparable 
from this world. In Zen meditation the existence ofthe 
world was set aside as invalid, but now it is regained 
from the eye of enlightenment as it is and as something 
that pertains to truth. In other words, things that exist as 
phenomena carry in themselves the character of eterna! 
reality or truth. The Buddhist expression "dharmal)aiŢJ 
dharmata," i.e., the Dharmaness ofthings, which is the 
same as the Law of Dependent Co-Arising, verifies 
this. To see Dharma is to discover the true character 
or existing way ofphenomena, which are not different 
from eterna! reality. 
In this understanding of the truth of Buddhism 
there is also a certain similarity to phenomenology, 
especially to its notion of the "Selbstgebung" (self-
givenness) of things. It means that things show or 
give themselves to consciousness. The concept of 
"Selbstgebung" corresponds to that of"Evidenz" (EVI-
DENCE) and thus Selbstgebung means from the si de of 
consciousness to get evidence, to grasp the "matters 
themselves" with complete certainty. For Husserl, that 
which belongs to this evidence is first empirica! intu-
ition, because sensuous intuition grasps the empirica! 
object "originar" (originarily) in its "leibhafien Selb-
stheit" (bodily selfness). In parallel to it there is also 
"Wesensschau" (the seeing of an essence), which is the 
grasping of an essence "originar in seiner leibhaften 
Selbstheit" (Originarily in its bodily selfhood). 
The difference between the intuition of essence and 
sensuous intuition consists in the fact that the latter 
is carried out in the passive receptivity of the expe-
rience of objects, while the former is "ideation" as a 
free activity of consciousness that constitutes the in-
variable essence. This doctrine of Selbstgebung and 
Evidenz could be compared with the teaching of Bud-
dhism that Dharma can be seen in things themselves. 
But for Buddhism empirica! intuition is usually hidden 
by the impurity of the seeing subject, so that humans 
cannot see matters "originar" without a fundamental 
change in themselves. When our bodies and minds be-
come unencumbered and free from impurities, we can 
see things as they are or in "leibhafier Selbstheit." This 
cannot be regarded as free activity of the seeing sub-
ject. It happens by itself when the person 's harmony

of body and mind deepens enough. To see Dharma is 
given, we could say. 
As mentioned above, Dharma has the meaning 
of "thing," and when it is used in the plural form 
"dharma~," it includes ali things and phenomena. In 
Early Buddhism, "dharma~" are constituent elements 
of phenomena of human beings and the world. There 
are three classifications of dharmah, which can be 
traced back to Sakyamuni's own teachings: the five 
aggregates, the twelve sense-fields, and the eighteen 
realms. The first classification, the five aggregates 
(pa nea skandhah; in Pali, P pa nea khandha) originally 
signified the congeries of the fi ve elements that go to 
make up individual existence. They are form, percep-
tion, conception, volition, and consciousness. Ofthese 
five, "form" (rupa) represents the physical body and 
denotes the body's sense organs such as the eyes, ears, 
and nose. The other four elements are functions ofthe 
mind. The five aggregates are regarded not only as 
constituent elements of individual existence, but also 
as embracing ali phenomena. This means that "form" 
comes to signify matter in general, while the term "vo-
lition" covers various functions and powers as well as 
abstract concepts. 
Ali phenomena ofthe world are thus understood on 
the basis ofthe unity ofbody and mind ofthe individ-
ual existence ofhuman beings. This seems in contrast 
with the phenomenology of Husserl insofar as for him 
things are reduced to phenomena ofthe pure conscious-
ness that constitutes them through its processes. As to 
the second classification, the "Twelve Sense Fields," 
the term "sense field" (ayatana = sphere, locus, place) 
refers to the "doors" of perception, i.e., those places 
through which perception occurs. The first fi ve refer to 
the five senses, and the sixth to the mind. Correspond-
ing to them, there are the "six sense objects" (rupa = 
color and shape), i.e., objects of sight, hearing, smell, 
taste, touch, and mind. 
As for the "Eighteen Realms," these consist of 
the above twelve sense fields, with their contrast be-
tween internal/external, and sense-organ/sense-object 
contrast together with the sixfold consciousness (eye-, 
ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, and mind-consciousness). 
The original meaning of the term "realm" (dhiitu) is 
"a place where something is laid" and it here means 
sphere or type. 
The principle lying behind this classification into 
eighteen realms is a theory of knowledge based on the 
concept of ca-operative interaction between the sense 
organs, sense objects, and consciousness. According 
to this theory, knowledge of an object requires an ab-
ject of cognition, a sense organ capable of establishing 
cognition, and the actual function of cognition. It is 
remarkable that knowledge of an object too is thus 
thought as something that is under the Law of Depen-
dent Co-Arising. Besides, consciousness in the Eigh-
teen Realms is understood tobe sixfold. Consciousness 
is not separated from the senses, but is something that 
works in close connection with them. 
These classifications ofthe "dharma~" as elements 
ofphenomena, especially ofthe "Twelve Sense Fields" 
and the "Eighteen Realms," seem to have some affin-
ity with the phenomenology of MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY. For him the subject ofperception is the BODY, 
and it is not the objective body that can be seen from 
outside, but the "phenomenal body." The phenomenal 
body is a system offaculties ofperception. This seems 
similar to the teaching ofthe sense fields and realms in 
their subjective si de. And for Merleau-Ponty the thing 
that is perceived by the body is the correlate of the 
unity of the faculties of the sense organs of the body. 
This seems to be parallel to the sense objects in the 
classifications ofthe dharmh. 
The Early Buddhism that has a direct relationship to 
the teaching of Sakyamuni is followed by a period of 
Schismatic Buddhism in India. This Buddhism is rep-
resented by the Sarvasti-vada school, which produced 
very systematic doctrines. According to this school, ali 
elements (dharma~) that are more differentiated exist 
throughout the three temporal periods of past, present, 
and future. To become an element of the "past" does 
not mean that the element ceases to exist, but rather 
that it merely disappears from our field of vision by 
taking up a position behind us. The terms "present" 
and "future" also refer only to the relationships exist-
ing between the elements and ourselves. The elements 
themselves are said to exist eternally. 
In opposition to that Sarvastivadin teaching, a new 
doctrine, Mahayana (Great Vehicle) Buddhism ap-
peared in India. It maintains that ali elements must 
be without any own-nature (svabhiiva-.~unya = void 
of own-nature), claiming that this is the correct in-
terpretation of the Law of Dependent Co-Arising of 
the elements. This is the meaning of the statement in 

88 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the Heart S11tra that "the five aggregates are empty in 
their own nature." Nâgârjuna and his successors (the 
Mâdhyamika school) elaborated on this theory, formu-
lating the doctrine of emptiness. 
But then another question arose: why is it that the 
elements do in fact appear to exist? As a solution to 
this problem, the doctrine of"mere representation" was 
formulated by the Yogâcâra school. Buddhists of this 
school deprive the elements of existence, recogniz-
ing only their functional aspect in relation to the cog-
nizing subject. The significance of the elements was 
explained with the basic structure of representation 
(vijiiapti-nuitratii =mere representation). Representa-
tion signifies that which is imaged or conceived in the 
mind ofthe subject. This school adheres neither tothe 
doctrine that ali things exist, because it takes the view 
that nothing outside the mind- i.e., outside mental ac-
tivity- exists, nor to the doctrine that nothing exists, 
because it asserts that rcpresentation (or conception) 
does exist. In other words, the doctrine of"mere repre-
sentation" is at first thc negation ofthe assumption of 
ordinary human beings that objects and the surround-
ing world exist independently outside the mind. 
This theory of"merc representation" has its ground 
in the structure of the mind that the Yogâcâra school 
clarified. According to them, ali things are grasped 
by the sixfold consciousness in our mind, but this 
consciousness is superficial and something of which 
one can be aware each time. Behind this sixfold 
consciousness there is a deeper consciousness or 
under-consciousness that is calied "iilaya-vijiiâna." 
First, "âlaya-vijiiâna" means etymologically store-
consciousness because it coordinates ali elements that 
have been grasped by the sixfold consciousness and 
stores them like a computer. Second, "âlaya-vijiiâna" 
means the "seed-consciousness" that brings the sixfold 
consciousness into active appearance. According to the 
Yogâcâra school, not only the concrete person with his 
or her mind and body, but also the externa! natural 
world or environment itself is nothing other than a man-
ifestation ofthe activity ofthis seed-consciousness. 
It must be noted that "âlaya-vijfiâna" as such a deep 
consciousness is tainted by the karma of each person 
and of ali beings and as such it obstructs seeing the 
truth as it realiy is. A complete transformation of the 
basis of consciousness is thus necessary in order to sec 
reality as it truly is. The doctrine of "iilaya-vijiiâna" 
is therefore in this sense the positive declaration that 
the truth is seen properly only from the viewpoint of 
the completely transformed consciousness, which can 
thus no longer be calied consciousness, but is instead 
considered to be Buddha-wisdom. 
This theory of "mere representation" is similar to 
Schopenhauer's idea of the "world as will and repre-
sentation," insofar as for both, the world that ordinary 
human beings see is subjective and iliusory because 
it is objectified by the blind imaginati ve power of the 
ignorant inner life ofthe subject. 
If we compare the theory of the Yogâcâra school 
with that of Husserl, we find some affinity. First, wc 
could say that the transformation of consciousness is 
paraliel to the transcendental epoche. The new view-
point of both is directed to the uncovered reality. Sec-
ond, reality can be known for both only in relation to 
the activity ofthe recognizing subject. Third, the inten-
tion ofHusserl's phenomenology as a strict science is 
paraliel to the ultimate state of "mere representation" 
as Buddha's wisdom that can sec ali things and even 
the self equally like a large mirror. 
As to the difference, Husserl's investigations are 
centered on transcendental subjectivity that is consid-
ered to be the pure ego, while the Yogâcâra school 
avoids the terms "subject" or "ego" because for it the 
ego has egocentric impulses duc to defilements and 
only Buddha-wisdom is frec from such biases. Therc-
fore the student of the Yogâcâra school must practice 
Yoga meditation and change his or her whole person-
ality- not only at the inteliectuallevel, but also at the 
ethical and unconscious levels ofthe mind as well. 
The two schools of Mahâyâna Buddhism gradually 
changed into academic forms ofBuddhism at the same 
time as Esoteric or Tantric Buddhism was coming to 
the fore in India. 
Kukai (773-835), one of the most remarkable per-
sons in the history of Japanese Buddhism, founded 
an esoteric sect named "Shingon" (true words) on the 
esoteric sutras of Indian Buddhism. This sect teaches 
that the practitioner receives the blessings ofthe "three 
mysteries" (sanmitsu, namely, the secret functions of 
the body, speech, and mind) of the universal Buddha 
through the power of "mantra" (shingon, true words 
or incantations); then the practioner is able to enter 
the world of the Buddha. Kukai expresses this as the 
"attainment of Buddhahood with this very own-body" 

BUDDHISM 
89 
(sokushin:jobutsu) or "the phenomenon is not different 
from reality" (sokuji-nishin). 
It can be said that this way of thinking was latent 
in the doctrine of Dharma of Early Buddhism, for ac-
cording to it, things or phenomena (dharmă~) are not 
separated from the truth (dharmată), as we saw above. 
But it is usually difficu\t to realize it in this world 
with one's own body. Therefore the tenets of Indian 
Buddhism demand an incredibly long practice. Kukai 
taught the concrete way to realize Buddhahood in the 
present life as practice with the body, speech, and mind. 
This view can be compared with the phenomenology of 
Merleau-Ponty because for both body and world have 
an important ro\e. 
In his unfinishcd last work Le visible et l 'invisible 
(1964), Merleau-Ponty investigates the compatibility 
of my body as visib\e or objective with my phenomenal 
body as seeing. This investigation is expanded to the 
relation of the seeing body and the visible thing and 
further to the correlation between my body and the 
world in which the thing is woven. Then he introduces 
his original conception of "flesh" (chair). According 
to him, my body is made by the flesh that is the same 
as the world, and this flesh of my body is shared by 
the world, i.e., my body and the world transgress each 
other. Such flesh is the primordial visibility that lurks 
in things and is o Jder than the function of seeing my 
body. In other words, the flesh is primordial simplicity 
of being before the division of my seeing or feeling 
body from visible or sensible things. Merleau-Ponty 
thus calls "flesh" that which has in itself, so to speak, 
both subject and object, or what is nature and at the 
same time mind; it is then a primordial unity of fact 
and essence. Flesh is therefore called the "element" of 
being, or the "pre-egological field," or the "vertical or 
fleshlike uni verse and its polymorphic matrix." 
Now we can come back to Kukai and compare his 
thought with Merleau-Ponty's theory. As to the rela-
tion of the objective body, the phenomenal body, and 
the thing or world, there is similarity in the classifica-
tions of the dharma~ of early Buddhism, as mentioned 
above. Kukai introduced a new view that is somewhat 
similar to the idea offlesh. He understands the univer-
sal Buddha (dharma-kăya =corporal realization ofthe 
truth) as the ultimate primordial origin of ali beings. 
In other words, it is the generative ground of nature, 
the world, and ali living beings, including humankind 
and even holy existence such as bodhisattvas and bud-
dhas. It is remarkab\e that Kukai refers to the universal 
Buddha in terms ofthe "Six elements," namely Earth, 
Water, Fire, Air, Emptiness, and Mind. The first five 
elements were he\d to be the material principles of 
the world in traditional Indian philosophy and in Bud-
dhism before Kukai. But for Kukai, these fi ve elements 
are penetrated by the sixth element, Mind, and are not 
different from it. It seems that both Merleau-Ponty and 
Kukai sought for the ultima te and found something that 
is prior to the division ofthe material and the spiritual. 
As to the difference between the two philosophers, 
we could say that the way to the ultimate was not 
fully cleared by Merleau-Ponty, while in his mystical 
philosophy Kukai develops the method to it in various 
ways. 
Koshiro Tamaki is a leading representative of 
Japanese Buddhism in the present age. Based on his 
thorough Zen practice, he interprets the fundamental 
experience of Buddhism as the fact that the Dharma 
appeared to the whole subjectivity ofSakyamuni. This 
subjectivity is a unity of his whole personal exis-
tence and is called by Tamaki "whole personal body." 
This word is grounded upon the term "kamma-vipaka" 
which Sakyamuni taught in the Early Canons and 
means the origin of the self and at the same time 
origin of the world. In so far "kamma-vipaka" cor-
responds to the "alaya-vijnana" which was mentioned 
above, but whi\e the theory of"alaya-vijnana" empha-
sizes the mental side, because it is the deepest under-
consciousness, "kamma-vipaka" is the body which has 
absorbed the mental si de in itself and is more real than 
it is. This means, it is the unity of al\ acts ofthe selffrom 
the immense past in association with ali other beings 
and appears concretely here and now as the foundation 
ofthe whole existence ofthe self. 
We could say that this relation ofthe Dharma and the 
self, or the appearance ofthe Dharma itselfto the self, 
is similar to the fundamental relation of knowledge in 
phenomenology, namely, the self-givenness of a being 
to subjectivity. In addition, the concept of "whole per-
sonal body" can be compared with that of DASEIN in 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER. "Dasein" is my real subjectivity 
in the "Tatsiichlichkeit" or "Faktizitiit." But the "whole 
personal body" seems to include a wider and deeper 
field, for it is like the store-consciousness and the basis 
ofmy body and mind and at the same time it binds an

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
individual, who has an immense karma, with the world 
and ali other beings. This concept must enrich pheno-
menology in the future, if it is adopted in the proper 
way. 
In sum, the question might ari se: is Buddhist pheno-
menology possible? 1 would answer affirmatively, if 
we understand phenomenology in a wide sense. As 
shown above, there are severa] common points ofview 
between Buddhism and phenomenology from Husserl 
and Heidegger to Merleau-Ponty. On the basis ofthese 
comparisons, new further trials should be made to re-
construct Buddhism phenomenologically. This would 
open the heritage ofBuddhism to the non-Asian world.

CANADA 
The connection of Canada to pheno-
menology was established early, when a Canadian, 
WINTHROP BELL, travelled to Germany to study with 
EDMUND HUSSERL. Originally from Nava Scotia, Bell 
had dane graduate work at Harvard and Cambridge 
and then studied at Gottingen from 1911 to 1914, com-
pleting his doctorale under Husserl with a dissertation 
on Josiah Royce. But although Bell was at Găttingen 
during a particularly interesting time in Husserl's de-
velopment and while Husserl 's collected correspon-
dence shows a substantial subsequent correspondence 
with him, there is no real indication that Bell, who 
became a distinguished historian of Nava Scotia, did 
a great deal to further the cause of phenomenology 
in Canada after his return. This contrasts with cases 
where foreign students or visitors attempted, upon re-
turning to their home countries, to introduce pheno-
menology to their local intellectual context in various 
ways, ranging from their own research to founding 
societies for the study of phenomenology. For exam-
ple, in the UNITED STATES, phenomenologywas not only 
successfully introduced by people like MARVIN FARBER 
and DORION CAIRNS, but was also developed as a new 
national tradition of phenomenology. By contrast, no 
Canadian school ofphenomenology has developed. 
Canada has far fewer universities and colleges than 
the United States, and because these schools tend for 
the most part to be scattered over a vast geographi-
cal area, scholars working in various disciplines do not 
usually tind colleagues in their field nearby. The excep-
tions to this would be found in the few larger centers 
in the country, i.e., Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. 
Given this general geographical separation, many aca-
demics found themselves working in relative isolation. 
This situati an has improved, of course, with more ex-
tensive use of telephones and with the advent of fax 
machines and electronic mail. 
This state of affairs is ali the more true for those 
working in phenomenology. When there are fewer 
schools and quite often smaller departments and when 
phenomenology has not gained a great deal of recog-
nition, it has had to work hard to gain and maintain a 
foothold. In Canada, phenomenology- as with Con-
tinental thought in general -
has had to exist in the 
long shadow of the dominant Anglo-American ANA-
LYTIC PHILOSOPHY. ]n contrast to other philosophical 
movements (such as the neo-Hegelian), which have 
on occasion managed to gaina respectable foothold in 
the face ofthe Anglo-American influence, phenomen-
ology has never been widely represented. It is not really 
possible to speak of a "school" of phenomenology in 
Canada, and even less o fa tradition. Rather, while there 
are certain clusters of activity, phenomenology by and 
large tends tobe represented at the individuallevel. So 
where there is a phenomenologist, he or she tends to 
be an isolated representative. 
Having said ali this, it must be acknowledged that 
phenomenology is, nevertheless, well represented in 
Canada, and that there is a present and energetic level of 
activity, organizati an, and research. That is, despite the 
minority status of phenomenology, it shows no signs 
of fading away and continues to thrive, albeit some-
what quietly, as evidenced by the keen interes! often 
manifested by students (even in predominantly Anglo-
American departments) and the consistently strong 
scholarship from Canadian phenomenologists. 
Indeed, the same survival instinct can be seen in the 
situati an of Continental thought in general in Canada: 
while clearly subsisting in a marginal state as com-
pared to the dominant mainstream tradition, it contin-
ues tobe a factor. Thus there are currently a number of 
centers, institutes, and societies with a focus on pheno-
menology, or Continental thought in the wider scape. 
The Canadian Society for Hermeneutics and Postmod-
ern Thought concentrates not only on hermeneutics 
and POSTMODERNISM, but on Continental thought gen-
erally, including phenomenology. Founded in 1984 by 
GARY MADISON with a group of his graduate students at 
McMaster University, the CSH was originally started 
to provide a forum for those working in Continental 
thought in Canada to meet and present their work, with 
the annual meetings taking place in conjunction with 
the Leamed Societies Congress. The Canadian Philo-
sophical Association meetings tended to be dominated 
by work in analytic philosophy. But that has changed 
in recent years, and there is now more and more repre-

sentation ofphenomenology and Continental thought. 
The same is true of Dialogue. the official journal 
of the CPA, which has been increasing the number of 
articles on phenomenology that it publishes. There is 
also the Bul/etin of the CSH, which publishes short 
articles and book reviews. And it is frequently possi-
ble to find articles in phenomenology or Continental 
thought in a variety of other journals, such as Eidos, 
Lava! theologique et philosophique, Philosophiques, 
and Philosophy ofthe Social Sciences. Indeed, both Ei-
dos and Philosophiques have recently published spe-
cial issues on topics in phenomenology, demonstrat-
ing an ongoing interest in both the Anglophone and 
Francophonc scholarly communities. Finally, with re-
spect to centers, it is important to mention the Archival 
Repository of the Center for Advanced Research in 
Phenomenology long maintained by JOSE HUERTAS-
JOURDA at Wilfrid Laurier University. In addition, for a 
period of time the Toronto Semiotic Ci rele organized 
the International Summer Institute for Semiotic and 
Structural Studies, which featured JACQUES DERRIDA, 
MICIIEL FOUCAULT, and PAUL RICCEUR, among others. 
Despite these various venues and contexts focused 
on or receptive to phenomenology, to a large ex-
tent Canadian phenomenologists still define their in-
tellectual contexts and establish their networks in 
extra-Canadian terms, i.e., in relation to Europe and 
the United States. Indeed, for most Canadian phe-
nomenologists, the "local" context is not Canada, but 
North America, with societies such as the Society 
for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, So-
ciety for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences, 
the International Association of Philosophy and Liter-
ature, the Husserl Circle, the Heidegger Conference, 
the Merleau-Ponty Circle, and the Sartre Society con-
sidered mainstays for phenomenologicallife in Canada 
as much as in the United States (perhaps more, con-
sidering the aforementioned geographical considera-
tions). Many of these societies have had occasion to 
meet in Canada. SPEP had its first Canadian meet-
ing in Ottawa in 1980 and a second in Toronto in 
1960. An international phenomenological conference 
was organized by ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA with the 
assistance of Lawrence Haworth and RICHARD HOLMES 
at the University of Waterloo in April 1969. The In-
ternational Husserl and Phenomenological Research 
Society was founded on that occasion and the papers 
from that meeting became The Later Husserl and the 
/dea ofPhenomenology, which is volume 2 of Analecta 
Husserliana: The Yearbook of Phenomeno/ogica/ Re-
search. Canadian phenomenologists have participated 
in the international scene as well: they have been rep-
resented at the Collegium Phenomenologicum in Pe-
rugia and the Summer Program in Phenomcnology at 
The Pennsylvania State University held by the Center 
for Advanced Research in Phenomenology. 
It is difficult to designate Canadian university de-
partments as having a particularly phenomenological 
emphasis. Once again, phenomenology is more typ-
ically represented by one or perhaps two phenome-
nologists, but it is often not enough to comprise a 
significant concentration in the context of a large de-
partment. There are, however, some departments -
usually those where Continental philosophy was tra-
ditionally quite strong- with more significant dus-
ters of people working in phenomenology. For exam-
ple, the University of Toronto, which has an cxtremely 
large philosophy department, has always enjoyed good 
representation in many areas, including phenomen-
ology. While Toronto's non-analytic component might 
be more properly classified in terms of German philos-
ophy, Hegel studies, or Continental thought generally, 
phenomenology has been represented by THOMAS LAN-
GAN's The Meaning of Heidegger: A Critica! Study of 
an Existential Phenomenology (1959) and Merleau-
Ponty s Critique of Reason ( 1966); GRAEME NICHOL-
SON's Seeing and Reading ( 1984) and Illustrations 
of Being: Drawing upon Heidegger and upon Meta-
physics ( 1992); HENRY PIETERSMA, who specializes in 
MAURICE MERLEALJ-PONTY, Husserl, and epistemology; 
and REBECCA COMAY, who works in MARTIN HEIDEGGER, 
Benjamin, and post-Heideggerian French philosophy. 
The McMaster/Guelph joint doctoral program is 
also well represented in the areas of Continental phi-
losophy and phenomenology. On the McMaster side, 
Gary Madison works in Merleau-Ponty, hermeneu-
tics, and POSTMODERNISM, looking at the interrelations 
among these areas in The Phenomeno/ogy of Merleau-
Ponty ( 1981) and The Hermeneutics of Postmoder-
nity: Figures and Themes ( 1988), and BARRY ALLEN 
on Heidegger and JACQUES DERRIDA. At thc Univer-
sity of Guelph, JAKOB AMSTUTZ, now a professor emer-
itus, taught phenomenology and Continental philoso-
phy to generations of students, while current repre-

sentatives include JEFF MITSCHERLING, who writes on 
German philosophy, hermeneutics- especially HA:\S-
GEORG GADAMER- and aesthetics. 
Another important -
and Francophone -
con-
centration is found in the philosophy department at 
the Universite de Montreal. This concentration was 
strengthened with the relatively recent arrival of JEAN 
GRONDIN, whose extensive writings on Heidegger, 
Gadamer, and hermeneutics examine a broad range of 
historical and thematic issues, e.g., Le tournant dans 
la pensee de Martin Heidegger ( 1987) and L 'horizon 
hermeneutique de la pensee contemporaine ( 1993 ). 
Also in the department are CLAUDE PICHE, whose re-
search interests include HERMENEUTICS, CRITICAL THE-
ORY, Husserl, and 
AESTHETICS, and GARBIS KORTIAN, 
who has written on Habermas and critica! theory. As 
is clear, the interests and work in phenomenology and 
continental thought at Montreal are currently focused 
more on German, rather than French thought: French 
phenomenology is now less well represented follow-
ing the retirement of BERTRAND RIOUX, who worked on 
JEAN-PAUL SARTRE and Merleau-Ponty. The Continental 
component ofthe department also maintains close ties 
with Europe, and has traditionally sent many students 
abroad for study, particularly to Germany. 
The University of Ottawa, once quite strong in 
phenomenology, has lost a certain amount of this 
strength with the departures of DAVID CARR to Emory 
University and Grondin to Montreal. Nevertheless, 
there is still a small core of faculty working in pheno-
menology. THEODORE GERAETS has had a long career 
of teaching and writing in German philosophy and in 
Merleau-Ponty, including Vers une nouvelle philoso-
phie transcendantale: la genese de la philosophie 
de Maurice Merleau-Ponty ( 1971 ), as has PETER MC-
CORMICK, whose work encompasses figures such as 
Husserl, Heidegger, and ROMAN INGARDEN and topics 
such as philosophy and literature and aesthetics, e.g., 
Heidegger and the Language ofthe World (1976). DE-
NIS DUMAS, a recent arrival to the department, works in 
German philosophy and critica! theory. 
The philosophy department at Brock University 
has had traditional concentrations in Heidegger, Ni-
etzsche, and Indian and Eastem thought. The late ZYG-
MUNT ADAMCZEWSKI was well known for his teaching 
and writing on Heidegger and Nietzsche (The Tragic 
Protest, 1963 ). Another long-time member of the de-
partment is DEBABRATA SINHA, whose work includes 
Husserl and Indian phiJosophy. DAVID GOICOECHEA spe-
cializes in EXISTENTIALISM and Nietzsche, frequently 
organizing conferences on related themes; RAJ SINGH 
writes on Heidegger; and MARK MULDOON also writes 
on Heidegger, as well as Merleau-Ponty and Ricceur. 
At York University, JOHN o'NEILL has had a dis-
tinguished career in SOCIOLOGY and in the Social and 
Politica! Thought Program, specializing in studies on 
Merleau-Ponty, critica! theory, and the relationship be-
tween phenomenology and sociology (Perception, Ex-
pression, and History: The Social Phenomenology of 
Maurice Merleau-Ponty, 1970). A1so at York in phi-
1osophy are MILDRED BAKAN, who works on HANNAH 
ARENDT, Heidegger, and Husserl, and DAVID JOPLING, 
whose research centers on ethics and theories of the 
self, especially in Sartre and EMMANUEL LEVINAS. 
At the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education 
(O.l.S.E.), DIETER MISGELD has worked extensively in 
Gadamer, hermeneutics, social theory, and Habermas, 
sometimes in collaboration with Graeme Nicholson. 
Also working in phenomeno1ogy at O.I.S.E., and fre-
quent collaborators, are RONALD SILVERS in sociology 
and VIVIAN DARROCH-LOZOWSKI in applied PSYCHOLOGY. 
Back in Quebec, Concordia University in Montreal 
has a small critica! mass with DALLAS LASKEY, who 
works in Husserl and on empathy; DENNIS o'CONNOR, 
whose areas include hermeneutics, Merleau-Ponty, and 
PAUL RICCECR; and ERNEST JOOS, who wrote Dialogue 
with Heidegger on Values: Ethics for TI'mes of Crisis 
(1991). 
McGill University now has R. PHILLIP BUCKLEY, who 
comes from the Husserl Archives in Leuven and spe-
cializes in Husserl, and of course CHARLES TAYLOR, who 
has recently moved from politica! science to the phi-
losophy department. While not identified specifically 
as a phenomenologist, Tay1or is known for his ability 
to weave together and synthesize varied discourses and 
philosophical traditions, and works such as Sources of 
the Self' The Making of the Modern Jdentity ( 1989) 
draw significantly on phenomenological and hermen-
eutica! insights. 
Finally, although a small department, philosophy at 
the University of Windsor has a small concentration 
currently with DEBORAH cooK -
whose areas of spe-
cialization include post-structuralism and critica! the-
ory, hermeneutics, and contemporary French thought 

94 
ENCYCLOPEDJA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
-and UNDA FISHER, who works on Husserl, Heidegger, 
Gadamer, and hermeneutics. 
Although the foregoing concentrations of interest 
and specialization in phenomenology are usually found 
in the context oflarger departments where the main fo-
cus and profile is not Continental thought, Jet alone 
phenomenology, they remain vital and significant. In 
addition to these clusters, and somewhat more iso-
lated, are those phenomenologists working in a con-
text where there is less concentration or where in 
many cases they represent the sole phenomenologist or 
Continental philosopher in their departments. MONIKA 
LANGER, from the University of Victoria, has written on 
Merleau-Ponty, SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, and Sartre; MAR-
GARET VAN DE PITTE, at the University of Alberta, works 
in epistemology and Husserl; Jose Huertas-Jourda, at 
Wilfrid Laurier University, was a founding member of 
the Husserl Circle and wrote originally on Miguel de 
Unamuno; CONSTANTIN BOUNDAS, at Trent University, 
has worked widely in phenomenology, Gilles Deleuze, 
and contemporary French thought, and also organizes 
frequent conferences in these areas at Trent; RICHARD 
HOLMES writes on Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre and 
teaches at the University of Waterloo; DENIS FISETTE is 
at the Universite du Quebec a Montreal and works 
on Husserl; JAMES MENSCH, at Saint Francis Xavier 
University in Nova Scotia, has broad research inter-
ests and expertise, including Husserl, ETHICS, Sartre, 
and PSYCHIATRY (/ntersubjectivity and Transcendental 
Idealism, 1988]; PHILIP DWYER, at the University of 
Saskatchewan, works on Merleau-Ponty and Sartre; 
and BRUCE BAUGH, at the University College of the 
Cariboo in British Columbia has published widely on 
Sartre, Heidegger, and French philosophy. 
It should not be forgotten, of course, that although 
most phenomenologists are in philosophy, there is a 
great deal of phenomenological work in other disci-
plines. Some of that work and severa! of these phe-
nomenologists ha ve already been mentioned above in 
the context ofvarious clusters at the different universi-
ties. It is important, however, to mention also the work 
of MARIO VALDES, at the Centre for Comparative Lit-
erature at the University of Toronto, who, along with 
work in phenomenological hermeneutics, Unamuno, 
and other Hispanic authors, has sought in particular 
to conjoin phenomenology and LITERATURE (Pheno-
menological Hermeneutics and the Study of Litera-
ture, 1987). MORNY JOY in Religious Studies at the 
University of Calgary, who studied with Rica:ur and 
works on Rica:ur, French philosophy, and hermeneu-
tics; ROBERT A IMBODEN in English at Ryerson Polytech-
nic University, who writes on Sartre and contemporary 
french phi]osophy; JOHN VAN DEN HENGEL at the fac-
ulty of Theology of Saint Paul University in Ottawa 
whose areas include hermeneutics and Rica:ur; ADRIAN 
VAN DEN HOVEN in French at the University ofWindsor, 
who has worked extensively on Sartre and is one of 
the Executive Editors of Sartre Studies Intemational; 
DAVID REHORICK in sociology at New Brunswick; MAU-
REEN CONNOLLY in PHYSICAL EDUCATION at Brock, and 
MAX VAN MANEN in PSYCHOLOGY at Alberta. 
In sum, despite the relative minority sta tus ofpheno-
menology in Canada, and despite its not infrequent ne-
glect and marginalization on the part of mainstream 
Anglo-American discussions as well as newer post-
modern discourses, there has long been and continues 
to be a steady interes! and representation of pheno-
menology in Canada. The scale may be smaller than 
the United States, but not the interest; and given the 
current levels of activity, and the promise of continued 
interest and involvement on the part of students and 
younger academics, a solid future for phenomenology 
in Canada is assured.

ERNST CASSIRER 
95 
ERNST CASSIRER 
Cassirer was born in 
Breslau on July 28, 1874, and died in New York on 
April 13, 1945. He first studied with GEORG SIMMEL, 
among others, at Berlin and was then sent by Simmel 
to Hermann Cohen ( 1842-1918) at Marburg, where 
he completed his doctorate in 1899 with a dissertation 
on Descartes' Kritik der mathematischen und natur-
wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnis (Descartes 's critique of 
mathematical and natural scientific knowledge), which 
appears as the introduction to Leibniz' System in seinen 
wissenschaftlichen Grundlagen (Leibniz's system in 
its scientific foundations, 1902). As a member of the 
Marburg nea-Kantian school, Cassirer published, be-
ginning in 1906, a faur-volume work on the history of 
the Erkenntnisprob!em (The problem of knowledge). 
He habilitated at Berlin in 1906 with the first volume of 
this work; the fourth volume appeared posthumously 
and at first in English in 1950. In 1919 he became pro-
fessor at the University ofHamburg, where hc was also 
rector during 1929-30. Emigration led him after 1932 
to England, Sweden (Goteborg), and the United States 
(Yale and Columbia Universities). 
In his work on the problem ofknowledge, Cassirer 
attempts to connect the systematic and historical points 
ofview to the nea-Kantian theme oftheory ofknowl-
edge by tracing and analyzing the origins of Kantian-
ism from the Renaissance up to the methods ofthe spe-
cial sciences in the 19th and 20th centuries. With this 
"Kantianizing" history of philosophy and science and 
through the retroactive influence of this history upon 
Kantianism, he always presents his work on scientific 
and philosophical history in connection with the whole 
ofthe history of culture. He thus prepares the way for a 
concretization of the problem of knowledge by taking 
into account the most subtle forms of actual human un-
derstanding ofthe world. In Substanzbegriffund Funk-
tionsbegriff Untersuchungen uber die Grundfragen 
der Erkenntniskritik (Substance and function: Inves-
tigations into the fundamental questions ofthe critique 
ofknowledge, 191 0), he lays down a philosophy ofthe 
modern mathematical sciences in the manner of KANT, 
and in Freiheit und Form. Studien zur deutschen Geis-
tesgeschichte (Freedom and form: Studies in German 
cultural history, 1916), he uses the example of the de-
velopment of German cu !ture from Luther to Hegel to 
develop a conception of the history of the sciences of 
mind -
the cultural Or HUMAN SCIENCES -
that will 
serve at the same time to provide foundations for the 
totality of modern scientific culture. 
Cassirer attempts to unify the variety of systematic-
theoretical and historical-contextual motives, and also 
to mediate the sharp confrontation set up between the 
NATURAL SCIENCES and the human sciences, in an an-
tisubstantialist mode of thinking oriented around the 
concept of (spiritual) function. The results of these 
efforts are the concepts of"symbolic form" and "sym-
bolic formation." These are to be found in the full 
sense beginning around 1920, e.g., in Zur Einstein-
schen Relativitiitstheorie. Erkenntnistheoretische Be-
trachtungen (Einsteinian relativity theory: Epistemo-
logical considerations, 1920), where he sees "the task 
of systematic philosophy, which reaches far beyond 
that of the theory of knowledge" to consist in "appre-
hending ... the totality of symbolic forms, from whose 
application the concept of a reality that is organized in 
itself arises for us." By virtue of the concept of "sym-
bolic forms," which he determines in the sense of a 
"symbolic formation" as ways ofworld-understanding, 
"subject" and "abject" are first distinguished for us, and 
'T' and "world" emerge "in definite forms" as opposed 
to each other. Every specific symbolic form, that is to 
say, every cultural domain as a dimension of active 
world-understanding- such as LANGUAGE, HISTORY, 
myth, RELIGION, art, science, TECHNOLOGY, etc.- is "in 
the account relativized as opposed to the others;- but 
since such relativization is entirely reciproca], since 
no specific form, but only the systematic totality can 
claim to express 'truth' and 'reality,' the limit which 
arises from it appears on the other si de as a thoroughly 
immanent constraint, as a constraint that is eliminated 
as soon as we relate the specific form to the totality and 
consider it in the context ofthe whole." 
If one wants to compare this concept of "sym-
bolic form" with phenomenology, one should refer 
to HEGEL 's Phiinomenologie des Geistes ( 1807) rather 
than to Husserl 's phenomenology. As a matter of fact, 
Cassirer relates himself to phenomenology, and then 
he connects to two quite different forms of it- i.e., 
to Hegel and to Husserl. But in both cases this con-
nection is not a dogmatic one. When Cassirer holds 
out the promise in his article "Die Begriffsform im 
mythischen Denken" ( 1922) for his Phi!osophie der 
symbolischen Formen ( 1923/25/29), he speaks of a 
"phenomenology of symbolic forms" that is to be-

96 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
gin with a "phenomenology of linguistic forms." It is 
Hegel 's Phanomenologie des Geistes that fulfills that 
which was in Vico only a demand, namely, to represent 
the "concrete totality of spirituallife" in the "fullness 
of its appearances." Later on, Hegel is cited again and 
again in this context, to be sure not without criticism 
of his speculative-dialectica! method. 
Cassirer's proximity to Husserl is clearly tobe seen 
when it is a question of the concrete determination of 
the symbolic forms. Symbolic formation shows itself 
to be an intentiona! process that is always related to 
intuitability (Anschaulichkeit), a process that is car-
ried by an experiencing consciousness as "originary 
phenomenon." At any rate, this consciousness, whose 
transcendental function is recognized as with Husserl, 
is not understood as an abstract entity. It is rather seen 
as connected to the BODY as the source-point of orien-
tation and reference. That is why Cassirer calls the tra-
ditional problem of the "body-soul relation" the "first 
model and example for a symbolic relation." What is 
important is that according to Cassirer, the symbolic 
relation (body-soul/spirit) "originally" does not know 
of the "inner" and the "outer," the "acting" and the 
"acted upon," but is primarily "a meaningful whole 
that interprets itself." The original phenomenology of 
expression that "shows" itself and that we "phenomen-
ologically interpret" is contrasted with the subsequent 
"ontologica! questioning" that always goes beyond the 
pure phenomenon of expression. 
Husserl 's distinction and correlation between hyle 
and morphe possesses for Cassirer, already quite early, 
a decisive methodical function. Not knowing about 
Husserl's own self-criticism, Cassirer raises the objec-
tion that hyle and morphe should not be hypostatized 
into entities, since every living human experience al-
ready connects both elements. This original experien-
tial predicament, which has to be dealt with through a 
"phenomenology of perception," is brought out in the 
discovery of the so-called "symbolic pregnance," for 
which the body-soul relation is an original and irre-
ducible paradigm: "under 'symbolic pregnance' shall 
be understood the manner in which a perceptual ex-
perience as sensuous experience contains within itself, 
at the same time, a determinate non-intuitive 'mean-
ing' and brings it to immediate concrete representation. 
One is not concerned here with merely 'perceptual' 
givenness to which some 'apprehensive' acts are sub-
sequently affixed, through which they are interpreted, 
judged, and restructured. It is rather the perception 
itself, which by virtue of its immanent structuring, ac-
quires a sort of spiritual 'articulation'." Or, to put it 
another way, "there are for us no detached, in-itself-
subsisting intuitive 'experiences,' which are not al-
ready 'filled' with any theoretical meaning-function 
and not accordingly structured, just as, on the other 
hand, there is nothing merely ofthe nature ofmeaning 
which does not search for and find its fulfillment some-
how in something intuitive." This does not mean "that 
the symbolic in our knowledge splits itself up, that it 
separates itself, in a certain manner, into an 'imma-
nent' and a 'transcendent' component. The symbolic 
is rather immanence and transcendence in one: insofar 
as a content that is in principle non-intuitable expresses 
itself in intuitive form." 
The core of Cassirer's philosophical interrogation, 
therefore, is increasingly the problem ofMEANING. Cas-
sirer recognizes Husserl's distinction between mean-
ingful signs (as expressions) and mere indicating signs 
as an important discovery. The question about truth is 
subordinated to the question of significance and mean-
ing. This means that what is true can open itself up 
only through the phenomena ofmeaning. The concept 
of symbol is the expression of this thesis, namely, that 
"meaning-fulfillment" takes place in the "sensuous," 
just as the sensuous can be manifested in experience 
only in the framework of"meaning," of"ideation," and 
of a "point ofview." This means that it is about the "in-
carnation of meaning," by which Cassirer anticipates 
a formuJation ofMAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY. In the sym-
boJic formation as understanding ofreality, one has to 
set out from a correlation between the act of working 
and the work, in which the latter serves as paradigm 
for laying bare the act of working, while the working 
serves as the horizon for understanding the work that 
is effected-entirely in the sense ofHusserl's distinc-
tion between noesis and noema. Sometimes Cassirer 
uses the term "HERMENEUTic" for the elementary de-
termination ofthe signification ofworks. For him, the 
intentiona!, world-opening relatedness to the "other" 
is primarily relatedness to the you or the helshe, not to 
an it. Relatedness to the it is nothing but the never-to-
be-reached limiting concept ofrelatedness to you. The 
concept of a full "I," i.e., of the full personal subjec-
tivity, is acquired, in the first place, through reciproca! 

ERNST CASSIRER

arrangement between ''1''-"you" structures. 
An explicit recourse and connection to Husserl's 
phenomenological method, as a philosophy of mean-
ing, is to be found in Cassirer's philosophy of myth, 
which at the same time is striking in its affinity to 
Husserl's problem ofthe LIFEWORLD: "It belongs to the 
fundamental merits of Husserlian phenomenology, that 
it has again sharpened the ability to see the diversity of 
spiritual 'structural forms,' and has pointed out a path, 
diverging from the psychological problem and method, 
for their consideration. Especially decisive here is the 
sharp separation of psychic 'acts' from the 'objects' 
intended in them. In the path that Husserl himself has 
traversed, from the Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-
1901) to the Jdeen zu ei ner reinen Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie (1913), it becomes 
clearer that the task of phenomenology, as he under-
stands it, is not exhausted by the analysis ofknowledge, 
but that one has to investigate the structures of quite 
different domains of objects purely in accordance with 
what they 'mean' and without any consideration of 
the 'actuality' of their objects. Such an investigation 
must also include in its domain the mythical 'world' 
in order to apprehend its peculiar distinguishing con-
ten!, not through induction from the diversity of eth-
nological and ethnological-psychological experiences, 
but rather by grasping it in pure ideational analysis. 
An attempt in this direction, as far as 1 can see, has 
been undertaken neither from the side of phenomen-
ology itself nor from the si de of concrete research into 
myths, in which the genetic-psychologically oriented 
questioning still remains unchallenged in the field." 
In any case, Cassirer 's concept of phenomenology 
reaches its highest point in his Philosophie der sym-
bolischen Formen III, neither in his relation to Hegel 
nor in his relation to Husserl, but in connection with 
an argument in the Allgemeine P.1ychologie nach kri-
tischer Methode (1912) of Paul Natorp ( 1854-1924). 
This work contains, in the best sense of the word, "a 
truly universal program of a phenomenology of con-
sciousness," which is "exhibited in strictly 'critica!' 
reflection." For Natorp, psychology is thematized in 
a sense that is completely free from the limitations 
of the special discipline that goes by that name and 
from the psychologism that has been justly criticized 
by Husserl. Thus the concern is not with some kind 
of psychology, but with that which is fundamental for 
every psychology and for philosophy- namely, the 
"being-conscious" or "consciousness" that underlies 
ali understanding ofreality and ali objectivation. Con-
sciousness cannot be "described as an analogue of ob-
jective reality." The "fact ofbeing-conscious" is rather 
"an irreducible ultimate that lets itself only be shown, 
but does not Jet itselfbe 'explained' ... in accordance 
with the categoria] forms ofknowledge ofthings. Here 
one is concerned not with 'an appearing thing,' but 
with 'the pure fact of appearing itself.' That such an 
'appearing' takes place ... this originary fact here 
constitutes the only problem." 
Cassirer agrees with Natorp's formulation of the 
problem, but he criticizes Natorp 's attempt to de-
termine consciousness by the so-called "Minus-
Richtung," i.e., the determination ofthe subjective out 
of the objective. Nevertheless, he recognizes positive 
ideas in Natorp, especially how, according to Natorp, 
consciousness has tobe brought to expression in some 
way or other, e.g., in its linguistic culture. As con-
trasted with Natorp, Cassirer seeks for this expression 
not in the formed, scientific structures, not even ifthese 
law-governed sciences, as with Natorp, are sciences of 
mind. Cassirer finds the "sources" for the opening up of 
consciousness rather in the themes of such sciences-
in language, art, religion, etc.- as the "original modes 
of relatedness and structuring of consciousness." 
That this orientation toward "objective spirit" and 
its shapes can no longer be reached methodically 
through Hegel 's phenomenology of spirit, but only 
through Husserl's phenomenology, becomes clear in 
relation to Cassirer's analysis ofTIME. As with Husserl, 
time is the pervasive fundamental structure of con-
sciousness. The "symbolic" is conceivable only against 
the background of the inalienable temporality of 
consciousness. The function of temporality is RE-
PRESENTATION, i.e., "presence" is, according to Cas-
sirer, a case of "re-presentation." This presentifying 
re-presentation that makes every shaping ofreality and 
apprehension of reality possible in the first place ex-
plicitly operates, according to Cassirer, intentionally. 
This means that the unifying interconnection of past 
and future (in a respective present) is accomplished 
not in the sense of a causal or thinglike connection, 
but rather by virtue of the temporal INTENTIONALITY of 
consciousness. In this, the temporal dimension of the 
fu ture plays, for Cassirer, a decisive ro le, because it first 

98 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
makes possible, in and through the anticipation ofpos-
sibilities, something like idealization, internalization, 
ethos, and historical consciousness. With the thought 
that the problem of time, in this sense, leads beyond 
the cultural phenomenon of "generating the shapes of 
time" to the demand for a cultural-philosophical eval-
uation oftemporality, Cassirer goes beyond Husserl~ 
although in the spirit of Husserl ~ 
and opens up the 
possibility of a phenomenology of cui ture that is only 
suggested in the late works of Husserl. 
In the last book Cassirer published during his life, 
Essay on Man ( 1944 ), something that is merely indi-
cated in his works after the middle 1920s first comes 
strikingly to expression: the "philosophy of symbolic 
forms" becomes a sort of phenomenological philos-
ophy of culture and a philosophical anthropology. 
An important stage in this is Cassirer's lecture of 
1929 along with the well-known meeting between 
him and MARTIN HEIDEGGER at Davos. In this Jecture, 
MAX SCHELER 's characterization of phenomenology as 
"desymbolization of the world" undergoes a revision, 
without phenomenology being thereby rejected. For 
the "animal symbolicum," which is the core of the 
Essay on Man, is throughout capable of phenomen-
ology, if one interprets "symbolic formation" as be-
ing a formula that is parallel to "intentiona! consti-
tution," i.e., for the inter-intentional process ofworld-
and self-constitution. Cassirer understands both pheno-
menology and symbolic formation in precisely this 
manner. 
Cassirer's relation to phenomenology is, tobe sure, 
not determined solely by the a1ternatives of Hegel and 
Husserl. His historical consciousness forbids such al-
ternatives in any case. He is also related in his views to 
authors such as Cari Stumpf (1838-1936) and FRANZ 
BRENTANO, but above ali to GEST ALT PSYCHOLOGY, includ-
ing such figures as Kurt Koffka (1886--1941) and the 
psychopathologists Adhemar Gelb ( 1887-1936) and 
Kurt Goldstein ( 1878-1965). Cassirer was in personal 
contact with ARON GURWITSCH during their American 
exile, and a course on phenomenology in Cassirer was 
repeatedly taught at the New School for Social Re-
search by Gurwitsch. Cassirer's relations to Gestalt 
psychology in the 1930s in FRANCE, where Paul Guil-
laume ( 1878-1962) was active as a translator and in-
terpreter, also influenced younger phenomenologists 
such as Merleau-Ponty to study his work. References 
to Cassirer in the Phenomimologie de la perception 
( 1945) play a significant ro le and thus aga in he can be 
related to phenomenology.

CHINA 
N umerous works of Western philoso-
phy have been translated into Chinese since 1898, but 
the reception of phenomenological philosophy began 
only relatively recently. While in the 1920s and 1930s 
severa! young Japanese studied in Germany with ED-
MUND HUSSERL and MARTIN HEIDEGGER and thus prepared 
the introduction ofphenomenology into Japan, only the 
names of three Chinese are known to me who studied 
phenomeno1ogy in Germany before the Communists 
seized power on the mainland. These are YOUDING SHEN, 
who !ater taught at Qinghua University in Beijing; WEI 
XIONG, who !ater taught in Nanjing and afterwards until 
his death, in 1994, at Beijing University; and SHIYI XIAO 
(Paul Hsiao ), who helped Heidegger with the transla-
tion of Dao de }ing [Tao te Ching] (see "Wir trafen 
uns auf dem Holzmarktplatz" in Erinnerung an Martin 
Heidegger, 1977) and !ater taught at Fujen University 
in Taipei. But phenomenological works were not pub-
lished in China and Taiwan until the early 1960s. 
A partial translation of JEAN-PAUL SARTRE's Cri-
tique de la raison dialectique ( 1960) appeared in 1963 
(Shangwu yinshuguan). In the same year a part of 
Heidegger 's Sein und Zeit (1927), translated by Wei 
Xiong, and Sartre's L'existentialisme est un human-
isme ( 1946) were published in Chinese in a collection 
entitled Cunzaizhuyi zhexue (The philosophy of ex-
istentialism) published by the Academy of Sciences. 
Also in 1963 a translation of ISO KERN's article "Die 
drei Wege zur phanomenologischen Reduktion in der 
Philosophie Edmund Husserls" appeared in Number 3 
ofthe series Zhexue yicong (Collection oftranslations 
in philosophy). In 1964 partial translations of Heideg-
ger's Sein und Zeitand Sartre's L 'etre et le neant( 1943) 
appeared in a collection edited by QIAN HONG entitled 
Xţfang xiandai zichanjieji zhexue lunzhu xuanji (Selec-
tion ofphilosophical works ofthe contemporary West-
ern capitalist class). In Taiwan a monograph entitled 
Husaier Xianxiangxue (Husserl 's phenomenology), by 
GUILIANG LI, appeared in 1963. 
But these translations did not ha ve a wider influence 
on the mainland. for in 1966 the "cultural revolution" 
set in and made any serious discussion of non-Marxist 
philosophy impossible for more than ten years. Nev-
ertheless during those years YOUZHENG LI studied the 
Husserliana volumes very privately in the Beijing li-
brary to which the editor of the series, Father HERMAN 
LEO VAN BREDA, had sent them gratis. 
A significant reception of phenomenology on the 
Chinese mainland began after 1978. At first some 
phenomenological articles by Chinese and Western 
authors appeared in journals. The earliest article on 
Husserl published after 1964 that is known to me is 
by KEDING LUO, a professor at Zhongshan University in 
Canton, entitled, to trans1ate it, "Husser1's Phenomen-
ology is a Reaction against the Modern Sciences" and 
published in Zhexue yanjiu (Philosophical research). 
But chapters on phenomenology and EXISTENTIALISM 
were also included in textbooks on contemporary West-
ern philosophy ~for example, in the workXiandai xi-
fang zhuming zhexuejia shuping (Commentaries on fa-
mous contemporary Western philosophers), published 
by Renzhi Du, 1980. The chapter on Husserl is by 
YOUZHENG LI, the one on Heidegger and Sartre is by 
Xiong Wei. A chapter on MAX SCHELER by BINGWEN 
WANG and one about MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY by FANG-
TONG LIU appeared in a subsequent volume in 1983. 
Another large work, Xiandai xifang zhexue (Contem-
porary Western philosophy, 1981; 5th ed. 1987), edited 
by Fangtong Liu, a professor at Fudan University in 
Shanghai, contains a chapter on phenomenology by 
MINGSHENG FAN and one about existentialism by Fang-
tong Liu. 
Since 1986 Chinese translations of phenomen-
ological classics have appeared every year. Among 
these are the following works of Husserl: Idee der 
Phănomenologie [ 1907], translated by LIANGKANG 
Lester Embree, Elizabeth A. Behnke, David Carr, J. Claude Evans, Jose Huertas-Jourda, Joseph J. Kockelmans, William R. McKenna,

LIANG ZHOU and YONGKUAN TANG ( 1988); and Les mots, 
trans]ated by PEIQING PAN ( 1989). 
Sartre appears to be the best-known phenomen-
ologist in China. On the one hand, this is connected 
with his closeness to MARXISM, and on the other, with 
his idea of freedom, which after 1978 aroused great 
interest among many young intellectuals. Heidegger 
(up to now nearly only the early Heidegger) also be-
came known in China especially through Wei Xiong, 
who taught at Beijing University. Husserl's phenomen-
ology was also taken up with interest. For example, the 
1986 translation of the Idee der Phiinomenologie was 
quickly reprinted three times and attained a total edi-
tion of 130,000 copies. Scheler has received notice 
because of a growing interest in religion sin ce 1990. 
Phenomenology has been taught in China at severa! 
important philosophy departments, mainly by young 
professors who were educated in Europe: at South-
east University in Nanjing by Professor Liangkang Ni; 
at Beijing University by Professor Xiaozhen Du and 
Professor XIPING JIN; and at Fudan University in Shang-
hai by Professor Qingxiong Zhang. At present, pheno-
menology in China is chiefly in a stage of reception. 
but there is hope for creative and original work. es-
pecially since phenomenology can become connected 
with Chinese traditions of the analysis of conscious-
ness, for example Weishi BUDDHISM (a Chinese form of 
Vijnanavada). 
In October I 994 the first national phenomenology 
conference took place in China, organized by Pro-
fessor Liangkang Ni of Southeast University in Nan-
jing. Forty-eight philosophers participated. At this con-
ference a Chinese Society for Phenomenology was 
founded. This society started publishing a phenomen-
ological annual, Zhongguo xianxiangxue yu zhexue 
pinglun (Phenomenological and philosophical research 
in China), with its first issue appearing in 1995, and 
will organize more translations of phenomenological 
works. An international conference on phenomenology 
was held in Hong Kong for the first time in A prii 1996. 
Its focus was on the theme of "Interculturality and 
Lifeworld." It was jointly organized by the Depart-
ment of Philosophy, the Chinese University of Hong 
Kong, The Chinese Society for Phenomenology, and 
the German Society of Phenomenological Research. 
Ten internationally renouned phenomenologists from 
Germany, Belgium, the U.S.A., and Japan, together 
with a number of younger phenomenologists from 
Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong discussed 
philosophical issues of intercultural understanding in 
this three and a half day conference. 
A note on the phenomenological movement in Hong 
Kong should be added. Though phenomenology was 
not widely known in Hong Kong before the 1980s, 
two important Chinese philosophers Junyi Tang ( 1909-
1978) and Zhongsan Mou (1909-1995), themselves 
founders of contemporary Neo-confucianism, showed 
critica! interest in the existential philosophy of Hei-
degger against the background of Chinese philosophy. 
Neither, however, was attracted by phenomenologu 
as such. In the mid-J970s, TZE-WAN KWAN and CflAN-
FAI CHEUNG went to Bochum and Freiburg, Germany, 
and finished their doctoral dissertations on Heidegger 
and Husserl in the early 1980s. Both are now teach-
ing phenomenology at the Chinese University of Hong 
Kong. They are joined by a younger scholar, KWOK-YING

LAU who had written a doctoral thesis on Merleau-

There is an increasing interest in phenomenology both 
for itself and for its relations to other tendencies among 
scholars in local universities. In April 1996 the Hong 
Kong Society of Phenomenology was founded with 
Cheung as the first president.

COGNITIVE SCIENCE 
The latest name being 
applied to the study of the mind is cognitive science. 
The new name arose in order to denote the increasing 
overlap of a number of disciplines (psychology, com-
puter science, linguistics, anthropology, evolutionary 
biology, philosophy, and neuroscience), thus making it 
in effect a multidiscipline. When neuroscience is em-
phasized, the new multidiscipline is called "cognitive 
neuroscience." Researchers who work in these fields 
assume that they can benefit from the methods, con-
cepts, and data provided by the others and that the ques-
tions asked by researchers in different fields are closely 
related. We shall illustrate this cross-disciplinary ap-
proach by sketching one discussion central to cogni-
tive science. In the field oflinguistics much inquiry has 
been devoted to the nature ofthe mental representation 
ofthe rules of gram mar. According to Noam Chomsky 
and others, the general rules of gram mar can be formu-
lated only by analyzing LANGUAGE at an abstract level. 
The Chomskian school maintains that such abstract 
grammatical rules cannot be acquired through learn-
ing. Their argument may be roughly reconstructed as 
follows. The rules of gram mar, unlike the meanings of 
words, cannot be learned through experience. This can 
be shown by briefly examining how children learn the 
meanings ofwords. In order to learn the names ofthe 
various colors children need to make mistakes that are 
then corrected. The child does not learn the meaning 
of "yellow" by merely pointing to a lemon or banana 
while uttering "yellow," but also by being corrected 
when he or she points to a ripe plum and says "yel-
low." Learning, in short, requires the use of negative 
evidence. The child does not learn the rules of grammar 
through such negative evidence, however, because we 
very rarely observe the use of negative evidence in the 
actual learning of grammar. Hence, the Chomskians 
conci ude, these rules cannot be learned but must rather 
be "innate." From this conclusion the question natu-
rally arises ofhow we are to understand this innateness 
biologically: where are these rules stored in the brain? 
Such rules were first conceived as operating on 
symbols. The symbols, like the rules themselves, were 
thought to be stored in the brain. "Cognitive theories" 
postulated rule-governed operations on symbolic rep-
resentations. These theories were obviously modeled 
on the information flow charts that were used in com-
puter programming, and therefore the operations were 
viewed as identica! with or analogous to computing 
algorithms. 
About ten years ago cognitive theories were chal-
lenged by the so-called connectionist approach to in-
formation processing. Connectionism grew out of the 
recognition of severe limitations that plagued the appli-
cation of traditional ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (Al) mod-
eJs to the actual workings ofthe brain: biologica! neu-
rons are too slow and too unreliable tobe able to carry 
out the algorithms postulated by AI theories of men-
tal functions. Connectionist models of the brain take 
these biologica! limitations into account and do not 
presuppose stored rules or symbolic representations. 
These theoretical models consist of layers of artificial 
neurons and their connections. In the models there is 
a layer of artificial neurons to which a certain input 
(i.e., a string ofsymbols) is given, the input-layer. The 
symbols in this input-layer are mapped onto a specific 
output (another string of symbols), the output-layer. A 
rule may be used to describe the input-output relation, 
but this rule does not actually exist somewhere in the 
neural nctwork. In other words, the network "follows" 
the rule in the same sense that the moon "follows" the 
rule of gravitation. 
In order to clarify this we shall refer to one of the 
most prominent and hotly debated examples. When 
children learn the past tense of English verbs, they 
progress through various stages. They first learn the ir-
regular verbs ("go-went"). They then follow the rule for 
regular verbs ("wipe-wiped"). The idea that they are 
following this rule is supported by the fact that they 
make mistakes through over-generalization ("come-
comed") and by their ability to form the past tense of

102 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
non-existent verbs ("rick-ricked"). At the third stage 
the children follow the rule with the exceptions; they 
have consequently fully mastered the past tense of 
both regular and irregular verbs. Although these facts 
ha ve been taken as evidence for the rule-learning view, 
David Rumelhart and Jay McClelland and others have 
been able to demonstrate that the same behavior can 
be produced by a neural network that learns to map a 
particular input (the verb stem) onto a specific output 
(the past tense). These authors have therefore demon-
strated "that a reasonable account of the acquisition 
of past tense can be provided without recourse to the 
notion of a 'rule' as anything more than a description 
ofthe language .... There is no induction problem. The 
child need not figure out what the rules are, not even 
that there are rules. The child need not decide whether 
a verb is regular or irregular .... A uniform procedure 
is applied for producing the past tense form in every 
case." 
During the past decade neural network models ha ve 
been explored in their own right. This has led not only 
to a wide range oftechnical applications, but also to the 
discovery of a number of general principles of opera-
tion that fit the biologica! facts very well. According 
to Teuvo Kohonen, neural network models resemble 
the human brain in at least three respects: (1) Neural 
networks appear to work better in modules. (2) Func-
tions in neural networks degrade "gracefully" when 
connections are severed or parts of the network are 
rendered mal functional. ( 3) Some types of network are 
capable of self-organization, i.e., of produc ing orderly 
mappings of any kind of coherent input pattern without 
an externa! "teacher." 
Neuroscience is currently one of the most rapidly 
advancing fields. Within its framework computational 
models, such as the neural networks described above, 
are already receiving validation from biology. For ex-
ample, some very specific and very plausible features 
of computational neurons ha ve been discovered in the 
human brain. These advances have given rise to the 
field of"computational neuroscience." 
Cognitive scientists have devoted much attention to 
the topic of "representation." They ha ve studied rep-
resentations of various sorts- for instance, language, 
perception, memory, and mental images. Phenomenol-
ogists address the same topic when they examine the 
"intended object," "noematic aspects" of an object, 
etc. Cognitive scientists differ from phenomenologists 
in that cognitive scientists usually consider representa-
tions tobe mental while most phenomenologists deem 
them transcendent to consciousness. 
Cognitive scientists and phenomenologists never-
theless tend to address the same questions regarding 
this topic. With respect to visual perception, to take 
just one example, cognitive scientists have asked how 
the different qualities of a percept come to be repre-
sented, how a thing is identified throughout different 
representations of it, how we perceive a thing as ha v-
ing a particular color although it may reflect light of 
various colors, etc. The same issues were addressed 
by EDMUND HUSSERL, MAX SCHELER, ARON GURWITSCH, 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, and other phenomeno]ogists. 
For example, computational neuroscientists are now 
contending that perception is not simply a mirroring of 
externa! reality. Perception consists rather of a recon-
struction ofthose features ofreality that ha ve proved to 
be important for the organism in the process of adap-
tation. In phenomenology a somewhat similar position 
was taken by Scheler. He argued that the "milieu" of 
each kind of living being is "existentially relative" to 
it and to its biologica! organization. From the point of 
view ofthe neuroscientist, the fact that this reconstruc-
tion is adaptive for the organism and is at the same 
time accomplished by a finite information processing 
system leads to new questions, such as whether certain 
perceptual phenomena, like optica! illusions, are the 
result of adaptive processes or rather of the limitations 
of specific computations. In other words, data from 
neuroscience and computational model ing can provide 
constraints for our attempts to formulate adequate con-
cepts ofhow the mind works. 
One such constraint, the human BODY, has recently 
been explored by cognitive scientists such as George 
Lakoff and Mark Johnson. Summarized in the sim-
plest fashion, these cognitive scientists maintain that 
the mind does not first emerge as "pure reason" but 
rather as embodied, i.e., as spatiotemporally, biolog-
ically, socially, and situationally constrained. Such 
"constraints" pertaining to the body should not be 
viewed as limitations imposed on humans, however. 
Rather, as phenomenologists like Merleau-Ponty have 
claimed, they should be seen as providing the neces-
sary conditions for the possibility ofthe higher reaches 
ofhuman knowledge, art, and imagination. 

COGNITIVE SCIENCE 
103 
Lakoff's view, which he calls "experiential real-
ism," includes among others the following theses: ( 1) 
Thought is embodied, that is, the structures used to put 
together our conceptual systems grow out ofbodily ex-
perience and make sense in terms of it. (2) Thought is 
imaginative in that those concepts that are not directly 
grounded in experience employ metaphor, metonomy, 
and mental imagery. With this thesis Lakoff si des with 
that growing body of cognitive scientists who reject the 
traditional view that language and perception involve 
a literal mirroring of externa! reality. Lakoff contends, 
moreover, that it is this imaginati ve capacity that allows 
for "abstract" thought and thus takes the mind beyond 
what we can see and feei. (3) Thought has gestalt prop-
erties and is thus not atomistic. Mark Johnson shows 
how the embodied subject constitutes image schemata 
through bodily activity and projects those schemata 
onto other situations. Such projection means that the 
new situation is understood "metaphorically." 
In order to illustrate the crucial ro le of the human 
body in shaping experience, we cite a final example 
from neural network research. Jeffrey Elman has de-
signed a biologically plausible neural network that he 
trained with grammatically complex sentences. In or-
der to model not merely single words but also their 
contextual order, the network was designed to con-
tain an extra layer that represented the in formation that 
passed through it (in terms of biologica! function, this 
layer can be viewed as the frontal labe of the brain). 
Sentences with complex grammatical structure were 
fed to the network. Despite its own intricate organiza-
tion the network remained unable to capture complex 
grammar. It became able to capture complex grammar, 
however, if either ( 1) the in put was at first restricted 
to simple sentences and only subsequently made more 
complex, or (2) the additionallayer ofthe network was 
designed to have at first a very limited capacity and 
had its capacity increased only !ater (while the input 
remained unchanged and complicated from the begin-
ning). 
As Elman points out, it is unlikely that children 
are exposed to restricted language input and therefore 
alternative ( 1) above is unlikely to occur in real life. 
Alternative (2) is highly plausible. It is known that the 
human frontal lobe is immature at birth and develops 
connections to itself as well as to the other parts ofthe 
brain during the first decade of life. In other words, 
this computer simulation suggests that an immature 
brain does not impose a restriction on the human baby. 
To the contrary, such immaturity is a necessary con-
dition for the child's gradual learning of what can be 
modeled on complex rules and representations (input-
output functions). lf the human brain were neurolog-
ically mature at birth, i.e., already equipped with a 
complex organization, it could never learn complex 
grammar. The child can learn increasingly complex 
linguistic structures only because its brain structure 
gradually grows more complex while it is being ex-
posed to language, however complex. This biologica! 
"constraint" on learning serves as the necessary prereq-
uisite for the child's progressive mastery of complex 
grammatical structure. 
When summarized, the various views of cognitive 
science may be formulated as follows: 
( 1) The centrality of the body, both as lived body 
and as biologica! organism. The experiencing mind is 
an embodied mind. The human mind is shaped by ex-
perienced interactions between the body and the world. 
It is also shaped by the brain. A full understanding of 
subjectivity must take into account the biology of the 
brain as well as the fact that the human brain and body 
are products of evolution. 
(2) ?re-conceptual experience asfundamental. ?re-
conceptual experience forms the basis for the devel-
opment of structured experience. The practica!, pre-
conceptual activities of everyday life provide the "co-
herent input" that is a necessary condition for the ac-
quisition of any kind of experiential order, including 
the forms and rules of language and possibly the cate-
gories of abstract thinking. 
(3) Mutual dependency of brain and experience. 
Ongoing experience shapes our brains just as our brains 
shape ongoing experience. Because of neuroplasticity, 
actual experience can alter brain structure. Because of 
the adaptation of the brain through evolution, brain 
structure shapes experience. 
(4) The embodied subject as a se!f-organizing sys-
tem. A self-organizing system like the human brain 
can achieve increasing complexity through interaction 
with its environment without being taught any rules. 
(5) The construction of reality. Reality as we ex-
perience it is the product of and thus dependent upon 
mental and neurological processes as well as actions 
ofthe lived body.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Because cognitive science remains firmly within the 
"natural attitude" shared by most present-day empir-
ica! scientists, it may appear alien to the more "tran-
scendental" attitude of phenomenologists. In the past, 
however, significant developments in phenomenology 
have emerged from confrontations between it and nat-
uralistic disciplines. The uses that Merleau-Ponty and 
Gurwitsch made of Gestalt and Piagetian psychology 
stand out as obvious examples. Recent discussions in 
cognitive science offer phenomenologists much new 
material regarding precisely the province within which 
they claim tobe most at home, namely, the province of 
human experience. This new scientific material would 
therefore seem to demand serious phenomenological 
consideration. 
Moreover, the evolving theories of cognitive sci-
ence are actually proving to be cogenial to positions 
in phenomenology. Cognitive science is beginning to 
show how much of the experienced world depends 
upon the productive capacities of mental processes. It is 
also substantiating, as we noted above, the functioning 
of pre-conceptual prototypes, metaphorical mappings, 
imagination, and gestalt wholes at the most basic levels 
of awareness. Neuroscience is even demonstrating the 
central role of the lived body in shaping experience. 
In its own naturalistic fashion, then, cognitive science 
is confirming the primacy of perception and the life-
world in the development of human consciousness. It 
is tobe hoped that the fu ture will see fruitful exchanges 
between cognitive scientists and phenomenologists.

COMMUNICOLOGY 
Communicology is the 
study of human discourse in ali its embodied forms 
ranging from speech and LANGUAGE to gesture and 
signs. It is a HUMAN sciENCE that includes various forms 
of semiotic mediation beginning with the conscious ex-
perience ofthe human BODY and ending with the many 
forms of extension by TECHNOLOGY, such as cellular

telephones, fax machines, radio, television, and FILM. 
Phenomenology in the context of communicology is an 
approach associated with the geisteswissenschaftlich 
approach to the study of human conscious experience, 
especially in the semiotic performance of communica-
tion (la parole) and in language (la langue) as semiotic 
competence. The human sciences, including commu-
nicology, narratology, and rhetoric, use an analytic and 
critica! method of depiction or description grounded in 
a logic of discovery. Following the medieval tradition, 
the evidence of discovery is capta, i.e., that which is 
"taken" in perception. It is the Q.E.I. method (quod 
erat inveniendum). 
By comparison, the NATURAL SCIENCES USe a math-
ematicaJ method of invention for prediction or as-
cription, e.g., control in measurement. In this phys-
ical case, the evidence is data of invention, or that 
which is "given" in expression. This is the Q.E.D. 
method (quod erat demonstrandum). The methodolog-
ical conjunction of ( 1) capta or data and (2) acta, the 
embodiment of perception and expression that is the 
Q.E.F. method (quod erat .faciendum), characterizes 
phenomenology as a human science, which is a theme 
that, for example, we find in MARTIN HEIDEGGER 's Sein 
und Zeit ( 1927). The immediate European forerunner 
of phenomenological theorists in the human sciences 
was FRANZ BRENTANO. Brentano 's Psychologie vom em-
pirischen Standpunkt (1874) divides the phenomena 
of consciousness into ideas or representations ( Vorstel-
lungen ), judgments, and emotive phenomena, such as 
love and hate. Brentano's account is directly aimed 
at revising Aristotle's account of reasoning logically, 
understanding human character, and understanding the 
emotions, as noted in the Rhetoric. 
Communication theory in its modem sense became 
associated with phenomenology in June of 1922 when 
EDMUND HUSSERL gave a series oflectures in German at 
the University of London on the topic of "Phenomen-
ological Method and Phenomenological Philosophy." 
The earliest report in English ofthese lectures is in C. 
K. Ogden and I. A. Richards, The Meaningo{Meaning: 
A Study ofthe lnfiuence o(Language upon Thought and 
the Science ofSymbolism ( 1923). (Note that during this 
period "communication" was known, as the "science of 
symbolism.") Husserl 's explicit purpose in the lectures 
is to explain "transcendental sociologica! phenomen-
ology having reference to a manifest multiplicity of 
conscious subjects communicating with one another." 
These lectures were given following the second edition 
( 1913) ofhis Logische Untersuchungen, which formed 
the basis for another connection to communicology. 
The Logische Untersuchungen ( 190().-190 1) had a 
dramatic influence on young linguists in the Prague 
Linguistic Circle, who were studying the structure of 
language and speech and developed STRUCTURALISM. 
Along with other students ofHusserl-including LUD-
WIG LANDGREBE, HENDRIK J. POS, and DMITRJ TSCHIZEWSKIJ 
-
there was a gifted linguistic scholar named ROMAN 
JAKOBSON. On November 11, 1935, Jakobson invited 
Husserl to address the Prague circle on the topic of 
"Phanomenologie der Sprachc." As ELMAR HOLENSTEIN 
suggests, Jakobson became one of Husserl's most in-
fluential students by formulating the EIDETIC METHOD in 
relation to the empirica! basis for a phenomenology of 
communication grounded in linguistics and semiotics. 
Jakobson's lifetime offoundational work in communi-
cology led to the formulation ofthe theory ofcommu-
nication. 
At virtually the same time, another major exten-
sion of Husserl 's philosophy of communication oc-
curred with the publication of Karl Biihler's ( 1879-
1963) Sprachtheorie (1934). Biihler's explicit inten-
tion is to build on the conjunction of Ferdinand de 
Saussure's Cours de linguistique generale ( 1916) and 
Husserl 's Cartesianische Meditationen [ 1931 ], which 
he considers to be a major correction to the Logis-
che Untersuchungen. Biih1er's organic model of hu-
man communication explicates the constitution ofthe 
concrete acoustic phenomenon we know as a sign in 
language or speaking. The model consists of symbols 
in language that are a representation for objects and 
states of affairs; symptoms in language that are the ex-
pression of the inner states of the sender; and signals 
in language that appeal to the hearer and direct the per-
son's inner and outer behavior. These are ali semantic 
concepts for Biihler, and they bear a striking similar-
ity to both Brentano's categories for perception and 
Aristotle's categories for expression. 
While Husserl 's orginal work on language and com-
munication was highly accessible in Europe, he was 
not so well known in the United States. Wilbur Mar-
shall Urban published his The lntelligible World: Meta-
physics and Value ( 1929) to set forth the philosophical 
thesis that there are certainly three necessary presup-

106 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
positions of intelligib1e communications, name1y, that 
"I exist and others like me, inhabiting a world." This 
postu1ate is remarkably similar to MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY's ontology ofthe Self-Other-World relationship 
of embodiment. Urban argues that the possibility of in-
telligible communications is the ultimate postulate of 
ali thought and knowledge. While the postulate cannot 
be explained here, it is the presupposition for advanc-
ing ali philosophy and science. 
He undertakes to explore this problematic in his 
second major work, Language and Reality: The Phi-
losophy of Language and the Principles of Symbol-
ism ( 1939). Here he also quotes Husserl 's London lec-
tures as focusing philosophy and science on the pheno-
meno1ogy of communication. Following Husserl, Ur-
ban lists the fundamental meaning-functions of lan-
guage as "representative or symbolic," which also in-
cludes the "intuitive" as a subcategory; "indicative"; 
and "emotive." In his general phenomenology of com-
munication, Urban distinguishes "behavioral commu-
nication" from "inte11igible communication." The be-
havioral form is simply what we observe uncritically 
in others. The intelligible form displays the two cri-
teria of being "referenial" and "systemic," i.e., there 
is a "similarity of referend" and a "similarity of con-
text or of universe of discourse" between addresser 
and addressee. In short, Urban was responsible for the 
first explication of, and commentary on, Husserl 's un-
translated work, including the London 1ectures and Lo-
gische Untersuchungen, for the American intellectual 
community. 
Prior to Urban's presentation of Husserl's phi1os-
ophy of communication in the UNITED STATES, Husserl 
had been discovered in 1904 by Charles Sanders Peirce 
( 1839-1914 ). In a fascinating historical parallel, Peirce 
is also known for his conjunction of semiotics and 
phenomenological philosophy as presented in his Col-
lected Papers ( 1931-58). Howcver, Peirce's philo-
sophical orientation is fundamentally different from 
that of Husserl. For Peirce, philosophy is a subclass of 
the science of discovery. Discovery is a logic in which 
the relation of signs to their objects (i.e., conscious-
ness) combines with "phenomenology" (!ater changed 
to "phaneroscopy"), which for Peirce is the experi-
encc of the objective actual world. In this Peircean 
contest, logic is the science of symbols and, with allu-
sion to the medieval trivium, has three parts: "formal 
or speculative grammar," which concerns the mean-
ing or reference of symbols in general; "formal logic," 
which concerns the formal truth conditions ofsymbols; 
and "formal or speculative rhetoric," which studies the 
force ofsymbols in appealing to the mind. 
In !ater writings, Peirce renames the third category 
"objective logic" in order to expand its scope to in-
clude ali the general conditions under which a problem 
presents itself for solution or in which one question 
leads to another. For Peirce, signs consist of an ini-
tial consciousness called a "representamen" or "first-
ness"; an "object" in experience ("secondness"); and 
the resulting relationship ("thirdness") arising between 
them, which is called an "interpretant" of the mean-
ing of conscious experience, i.e., a sign phenomenon. 
His typology of sign categories consists of three tri-
chotomies following the order offirstness, secondness 
and thirdness respectively: Tone, Token, and Type; 
Icon, Index, and Symbol; and Rheme, Dicent, and Ar-
gument. Ali these terms are part ofthe standard vocab-
ulary of communicology in contemporary usage. 
As an emigre, Jackobson is part of both the Amer-
ican and the European traditions in phenomenology. 
His theory of communication is internationally and in-
terdisciplinarily recognized as a definitive statement of 
systematic and systemic theory, a theory that is both 
"exhaustive and solid" according to PAUL RICCEUR. The 
complete theory is based in the phonology of "dis-
tinctive fcatures" and the semantics of "redundancy 
features." First, for Jakobson, distinctive features in-
dicate a logica] criterion of opposition in speech that 
is the presence of an attribute ("markedness") in con-
traposition to its absence ("unmarkedness"). Take, for 
example, the sentence "The mayor put on her coat." We 
do not know the gender ofthe "mayor" until we get to 
the word "her" and discover reflexively that the origi-
nal unmarked work "mayor" is now marked (gendered 
as female). 
Second, redundancy features in language involve 
the phenomenological apposition of "variation" and 
"invariance." In our example, there is maximum vari-
ance as between "mayor" and "her" (i.e., neutra! noun 
versus gendered pronoun), yet the reference is invari-
antly redundant, and predictable as such, by the idea of 
nomination (person named). In short, there is a combi-
nation of both distinctive features in opposition (log-
ica! signification) and redundancy features in apposi-

COMMUNICOLOGY 
107 
tion (phenomenological signification) to create MEAN-
ING. Husserl anticipates this fact in his famous dictum 
that "subjectivity is intersubjectivity." Ali languages 
and communication systems may be described accu-
rately with these communicological features, but their 
combination as necessary and sufficient conditions es-
tablishes the uniqueness of human discourse in com-
parison to animal and machine systems. 
The theory is illustrated by Jakobson 's well-known 
graphic model ofhuman communicative elements and 
(functions): 
CONTEXT 
(referential) 
MESSAGE 
(poetic) 
ADDRESSER ---- ADDRESSEE 
(emotive) 
( conative) 
CONTACT 
(phatic) 
CODE 
(metalinguistic) 
In brief, communication occurs when an addresser 
speaks with an addressee. Normally, we assume an in-
terpersonal situation between two embodied persons, 
although the theory and model hold true with the in-
trapersonal, group, social, and cultural levels of com-
munication as well. 
The speaker's message establishes distinctive fea-
tures by creating a referential "context" for the code's 
metalinguistic function, e.g., speaking American En-
glish te lis a listener to use the code "English" to under-
stand what is being said. Both persons in the conver-
sation are taking advantage ofthe "poetic function" of 
language in which a pardigmatic (vertical) category of 
words is interchangeable with the syntagmatic (hori-
zontal) category ofwords. That is to say, the addresser 
expresses the utterance "The mayor put on her coat" 
by choosing each word in the sentence from a vertical 
category on the basis of ( 1) selection, (2) substitution, 
(3) similarity, which together form the process of (4) 
metaphor. For example, "mayor" is a noun and the 
vertical column category simply consists of ali other 
nouns known to the addresser. So when the addressee 
misunderstands the utterance as "The major put on her 
coat," the error is paradigmatic. 
When the addressee \istens more carefully and hears 
the correct utterance (mayor), he or she is choosing 
each word in the sentence form a horizontal category 
on the basis of ( l) combination, and (2) contexture, 
(3) contiguity, which together form the process of 
( 4) metonymy. This is to say, the listener is forming 
the linear string of"the+mayor+put+on+her+coat." Of 
course, both persons in the conversation know what 
the other is do ing, so that the addresser encodes a mes-
sagelcode into a horizontal word string by selecting a 
message from a series of context (code) word groups 
("vertical columns") in memory. Yet the reverse is 
true for the addressee, who decodes a codelmessage 
by arranging (code) a combination (message) ofword 
groups (vertical columns) into a perceived sentence 
or horizontal word string. In short, utterances are a 
very complex condition in which an addresser and an 
addressee establish "contact" physically and psycho-
logically, empirically and eidetically, by using a mes-
sage, code, and context that are phenomenologically 
reversible, reflexive, and reflective. 
Within the domain of discourse, Jakobson extends 
certa in fundamental notions of Husserl 's methodol-
ogy as found in the First Investigation, called "Ex-
pression and Meaning," in the Logische Untersuchun-
gen. Husserl's phenomenology of meaning creates a 
reversible methodological triad of the order of expe-
rience or constitution of meaning: sense; sign-vehicle 
or "name-thing"; and object, from the point of view of 
sign production by the addresser. Thus the addresser's 
"expression" creates "meaning" (Bedeutung). By com-
parison, the order of analvsis from the point ofview of 
the interpreter or addressee is sign-vehicle, sense, and 
referent. Here the addressee's perception of an "indi-
cation" constitutes a "manifestation" (Kundgabe). 
Husserl further specifies the fact that the MEANING 
of conscious experience has four domains of commu-
nicative reference as a sign process of expression and 
perception. First, "meaning" is what an expression sig-
nifies (the signifier), while "manifestation" refers to the 
perception ofthe speaker by the listener (the signified). 
Second, the same "meaning" may refer to different "ob-
jects" and conversely. Third, "symbolic meanings" are 
a product of informed perception in contrast to "intu-
itive meanings," which have a common "ideal mean-
ing" in a logica!, not psychological, sense. He suggests 
that in conscious experience there is a phenomenon 
and its constituting logic, hence a "phenomenology." 
The phenomenon is the object-referent (NOIMA) ofthe 

108 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
constituting act directed toward it (noesis). The who1e 
process is called " JNTENTJONALITY" whereby a person 
is "conscious of ... [experience]." 
Among the more important interpreters of Husserl 
is the French philosopher and psychologist, MAURICE 
MERLEAU-PONTY, as well as his equally notable student, 
MICHEL FOUCAULT. Merleau-Ponty's major work on ex-
pression, Signes ( 1960), as well as his Phimomenologie 
de la perception ( 1945), re1ate semiotics, the theory of 
signs, to phenomenology. In his explication ofboth per-
ception and expression, he suggests that there are two 
levels of discourse: ( 1) existential discourse in which a 
person expresses his or her speaking in an original and 
perceptive speech, i.e., a "speech speaking" (la parole 
parlante) that proffers an authentic message and (2) 
empirica! discourse where a person merely expresses 
what has already been said by others, i.e., a "speech 
spoken" (la parole par/ee) that legitimizes the social 
cade. In the speech speaking case, there is a rhetorical 
function of identity where consciousness of experi-
ence is an original reference to existential meaning, 
i.e., the authentic act of expression that is the linguistic 
message embodied in the person as addresser. First, 
Merleau-Ponty corrects Saussure's static notion of la 
parole by making it the dynamic la parole parlante 
or what Jakobson called the "message" in his parallel 
correction of Saussure. Second, Merleau-Ponty cor-
rects the concept of la langue by the more existential 
la parole par/ee or what Jakobson in agreement calls 
the "code." In this second category of speech spoken, 
the rhetorical function is banal and evokes an experi-
ence of consciousness, i.e., the commonplace meaning 
that is the linguistic code discovered by the addressee. 
Michel Foucault's Les mots et les choses ( 1966), 
intentionally retitled by him for its English transla-
tion as The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the 
Human Sciences, and L ·archeologie du savoir (The ar-
chaeology of knowledge, 1969) add a methodologica1 
dimension to Merleau-Ponty's view. He argues that the 
second, empirica! code level of discourse ( enonciation) 
that we know (connaissance) as the cultural code of 
social power hides the first, existential message leve1 
of "stating" discourse (enon ce) that we understand 
(savoir) as desire. This agonistic or contested process 
of rhetorical levels forms a "rupture" or ongoing dis-
continuity of discourses constructing and deconstruct-
ing one another in apposition to the embodied person. 
By using the method of "archaeology" (connaissance 
or knowing as the experience of consciousness; Jakob-
son 's "horizontal" syntagmatic category of code) and 
the method of"genealogy" (savoir or understanding as 
the consciousness of experience; Jakobson 's "vertical" 
paradigmatic category of message ), Foucault engages 
his third level, which he names "critica! methodo1ogy" 
in his L 'ordre du discours ( 1971 ). 
Note that Foucau1t's archaeology is a method of 
"oppositions" or "exclusions" (Jakobson 's distinctive 
features), whi1e genealogy is a method of"interstices" 
or "ensemb1e" (Jakobson 's redundancy features ). This 
critica! model subjects both archaeology and geneal-
ogy to one another as a dialectic of both opposition and 
apposition as Foucault's "reversal-principle" (Jakob-
son's poetic function). Foucault is following Merleau-
Ponty's prescription that the first step of analysis is 
a "phenomenology of phenomenology." That is, the 
conjunctions of both consciousness and experience in 
discourse are seen as reversible, reflexive, and reflec-
tive in judgment. Hence Foucault offers a critica! ap-
proach to discourse viewed as a phenomenological 
semiotic (Husserl's order of anaylsis) that completes 
Merleau-Ponty's approach of a semiotic phenomen-
ology (Husserl's order of experience). In short, while 
Merleau-Ponty examines the place of personal per-
ception in public expression (intentionality as a mes-
sage/code), Foucault critically studies the reverse, i.e., 
the place of public expression in personal perception 
(embodiment as a code/message) as illustrated, for ex-
ample, in the narratology ofhis Herculine Barbin, dite 
Alexina B. (Herculine Barbin; Being the Recently Dis-
covered Memoirs of a Ninetheenth Century French 
Hermaphrodite, 1978). 
Tuming now to the contemporary scene, the pheno-
meno1ogical theory of communication was adopted un-
cler the name communicology in the late 1950s in the 
United States and is associated with the ear1y founders 
ofthe International Communication Association- es-
pecially Franklin H. Knower (1901-1993) and Elwood 
Huey Allen Murray (1978-1988) and with Wendell 
Johnson ( 1906--1965), a major scholar in the theory 
of general semantics, founded by Alfred Korzybski 
( 1879-1950), whowrote Scienceand Sanity(1933) as a 
reformation of Aristot1e's philosophy oflanguage with 
much of the same intent as Brentano. It is also impor-
tant to note that GEORGES GUSDORF's La parole [Speech] 

COMMUNICOLOGY 
109 
was published in 1950 and then translated into English 
in 1965 as the inaugural volume of the Northwestern 
University Press series "Studies in Phenomenology and 
Existential Philosophy." This volume is largely an ex-
position of Merleau-Ponty's thought about communi-
cology and was followed by Remy C. Kwant's Pheno-
menology of Language ( 1965) and Phenomenology of 
Expression ( 1969). RICHARD LANIGAN's Speaking and 
Semiology: Maurice Merleau-Ponty s Phenomenologi-
cal The01y of Existential Communication appeared in 
1972. 
Among communication scholars in recent years, 
the disciplinary term "communicology" has expanded 
from its original focus on interpersonal communica-
tion to the other phenomenological levels. ( 1) Intra-
personal communicology now includes the study of ah-
normal as well as normal communication in the realm 
of cognitive, affective, and conative meaning; the study 
ranges from speech pathology and audiology problems 
to cognitive dysfunction in the therapeutic settings of 
medici ne. (2) Social communicology now includes the 
study of mass media arts and sciences; the discipline 
ranges from radio, television, and the publishing in-
dustry at one end ofthe spectrum to FILM, THEATER, and 
DANCE at the other end. And (3) cultural communicol-
ogy focuses on the dynamic inftuence of intercultural 
contact and cross-cultural exchange, especially in the 
areas of LANGUAGE, kinship, and ECONOMICS; this area 
ranges from semiotics ( code theory) to ETHNOLOGY (the 
study ofpeople's practices) and to what is now called 
the "new in formation order" (informatics) in the world. 
At the interculturallevel, we should note that "com-
municology" is now widely used as an appropri-
ate translation for the French communicologie (and 
its Italian and Spanish equivalents) and the German 
Kommunikationswissenscha(t. This shift in labels to 
communicology and communicologist is duc in large 
part to a systematic effort to avoid misunderstanding. 
The confusion was encouraged by the historical am-
biguity of the "communication theory of in formation" 
proposed in 1949 by Shannon and Weaver as com-
pared to Jakobson 's proposal in 1960 to distinguish 
communication theory from in formation theory on the 
basis of the phenomenological connections to what 
he calls the "rhetorical branch of linguistics" inher-
ent in communication theory. Clarity of usage was 
not achieved, although a serious effort was made at 
the First World Congress on Communication Science 
held in Berlin in 1977. Communicology is now clearly 
distinguished from information theory on the ground 
that communicology studies the fui! range of semiotic 
levels in discourse, i.e., the semantic (meaning), syn-
tactic (patterning), and pragmatic (practicing) forms of 
discourse. By comparison, information theory is con-
cerned only with the syntactic parameters of physical 
signal systems, e.g., the electrica! impulses that make 
up telephone transmission or computer memory. In-
deed, "information theory" as a name is quickly being 
replaced by signal theory. Thus the awkward phrase 
"communication theorist" has been replaced by com-
municologist, a fact acknowledged by the proceedings 
at the First World Congress on Communication and 
Semiotics in Monterey, Mexico, in 1993.

CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 
It is 
obvious that we are, at the same time, in and part ofthe 
world into which we are born, that we have an "idea" 
of the world in and for itse1f once we are in it, and 
also that we are aware of and act upon the world, that 
we "make" or "constituie" ourselves and the world of 
which we are aware. Despite the many variations and 
themes rung on the term over more than four decades, 
most generally "phenomenology" signifies for EDMUND 
HUSSERL a description and clarification ofhow the world 
is "made" as the only way to make sense of how we 
ha ve an "idea" of the world in and for itself once we 
are in it. To express the matter in another way, what 
Husserl started out to show in his first publications was 
how the world in and for itself acquires certa in forms 
that purport tobe valid for any world you please. Yet, 
he realized, ali he had shown was that the forms are 
valid for a world as a possible world for consciousness, 
thus for what is "made," "constituted." But what about 
the world existing in and for itself with which he had 
started? Husserl 's strategy was to hold this whole ques-
tion in "suspension," to maintain what DORION CAIRNS 
called an "officially neutra! attitude" toward it -
a 
strategy that in no way degrades, oral ters or elevates or 
reassigns the status ofthe world in and for itself. When 
set into self-conscious exercise, this strategy consists 
of examining the ways in which a "making" or "con-
stituting" consciousness and its objects are relevant for 
the analysis of what is in and for itself. How can the 
analysis of what is "ma de" be relevant for the "idea" 
of the world in and for itself? What Husserl will caii 
by the time of ldeen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie 
und phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 (1913) "con-
stitutive phenomenology" has as its task to describe and 
clarify how. 
1 begin with the assumption of a world in which 
there exists, as one minor item, myse1f, with my con-
sciousness, awareness. 1 then consider just my con-
sciousness and its objects "as such," describing them as 
"clues" to how they are "made," "produced," or "gen-
erated" in and through my consciousness of them ( or: 
in and through the "constituting" ofthem). The pheno-
menological result is the discovery that the world and 
its things are nothing but "intentiona! objects" COIJSti-
tuted as "poles of identity" and "intersecting lines of 
intentionality," to use Husserl 's !ater expressions for 
this broadest meaning ofthe term "constitution." The 
world and its things and forms are essentially noth-
ing but intentiona! objects, some of which exemplify 
necessary structures and characteristics for conscious-
ness of them either as immanent or as transcendent 
to consciousness- it being evidentially false that ali 
immediately given, constituted intentiona] objects are 
ipso fac ta immanent to consciousness. Finally, 1 then 
go on to say that this is the on(v world that 1 can mean 
and intend to in any way, that it is the only world 1 
ha ve, and that to speak of any "other" world would be 
self-contradictory. 
But how can such a conclusion be reconciled with 
the starting point of myself as but one minor item in 
the world when, as a matter of empiricalfact, 1 am the 
(efficient) "maker" of the world, am "constitutive" of 
the world? 
In terms of the actual course of Husserl 's think-
ing from the Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901) 
to Ideen 1 and then to the revisions for the second edi-
tion of Logische Untersuchungen ( 1913), this dilemma 
proves to be the motive for the increasingly self-
conscious exercise of the phenomenological EPOCI lE 
and for the analysis of its result, the phenomenologi-
cal reduction. The exercise of the epoche with respect 
to the world in and for itself, while not removing that 
fact, allows for changing the de facto course of my 
consciousness into a "pure possibility, one among the 
quite 'optional' pure possibilities"- pure of "every-

CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 
III 
thing that restricts to this fact or to any fact what-
cver"- that then, by means of EIDETIC ;."1ETHOD, can 
be thought of as exemplifying a pure possibility (again 
to use Husserl's !ater expressions). The significance of 
Husserl 's thought is that it is not only actual and de 
facto but equally in its reftexivity dejure purely pos-
sible and therefore not confined to its own factuality 
and to its own "making." As such, it is a variant ofthc 
thought and ofthe "making" of anyone you please. To 
clarify this conclusion we need to develop further the 
idea of constitutive phenomenology. 
By the time of "Philosophie als strenge Wis-
senschaft" ( 1911 ), 1deen 1, and the second edition of 
the Logische Untersuchungen, "phenomenology" is so 
defined as to examine how the analysis of "making," 
of"constituting," can be relevant for the analysis ofthe 
idea ofthe world by re(rainingfi"om acceptingthe sensc 
that consciousness has for itselfas part ofthe world-
i.e., as a minor item in the idea of the world that we 
ha ve once we are in the world- and considering the 
effect of that refraining. One can discriminate a sta tus 
of o ne 's consciousness as a primary ( or: "transcenden-
tal") status of"making" or "constituting" ofthe world; 
it is primary in the sense of being more fundamental 
than the sta tus of its actuality or possibility in a world. 
(By extension, phenomenology, with the epoche, and 
reduction are also called "transcendental.") Phenomen-
ology, accordingly, now has a dual theme: the primary 
or transcendental sta tus of consciousness "making," or 
"constitutive" of, the world, and consciousness neces-
sarily and validly self-apperceived as "in" the world. 
The relation of"making" or "constituting" to the world 
is an intrinsic one, sui generis, explored underthe head-
ing of the problem of INTENTIONALITY, and is not to be 
confused with the relation that consciousness consid-
ered as in the world has to the world. Expressed in these 
terms, constitutive phenomenology has a dual theme. 
It consists of describing the sui generic character of 
any actual consciousness as constitutive of the world 
of the natural attitude intended to and posited, and it-
self as intended to and posited (as self-apperceived) 
in the world with respect to those determinations any 
actual consciousness must have so as to be an essen-
tially possible exemplification of "constituting," and 
of being "constituted" as in some possible world- a 
narrower meaning ofthe term "constitution." 
By the time of 1deen 1, Husserl also made a sharp 
contrast between consciousncss as it is regardless of 
its self-apperception in the world (as "transcenden-
tal") and consciousness as "mundane" or "worldly" (as 
self-apperceptive, as "psychic"). At the same time, he 
sharply distinguished between (pure) phenomenology 
as an eidetic science of transcendental consciousness 
and psychology as an empirica! or factual science of 
individual worldly consciousness. These distinctions 
are likewise taken up in constitutive phenomenology 
now in a broader meaning of the term, "constitutive 
phenomenology." Within psychology, for example, a 
distinction is made between an empirica! psychology 
and an eidetic pure psychology: by exercising a psy-
chological epoche we can describe the constituting by 
psychic consciousness as to its kinds ofstructures of in-
tendings and positings and, inseparably connected with 
them owing to their intrinsic intentionality, the kinds of 
noematic, intentiona! objects constituted not only in the 
broader and narrower meanings of "constitution," but 
also those constituted in the most original ways (a sti li 
narrower meaning of"constitution") and those actively 
produced by spontaneous acts in Husserl 's pregnant 
meaning of the term "act" -
the narrowest meaning 
of the term "constitution." 1 can now proceed to con-
sider an actual case ofpsychic constituting as a purely 
possible example of consciousness in a possible world, 
describing just the constituting of empirica! kinds as 
before but also essential psychic constitutive possibil-
ities and impossibilities and necessities, and that not 
only in connection with the constituting ofthe psychi-
cal, but also ofthe physic, the psychophysical, and the 
cultural-social. We then ha ve the foundation for devel-
oping eidetic sciences of material regions, of formal 
regions, (FORMAL AND MATERIAL ONTOLOGIES, (ogics of 
possible being), and the like for any essentially possible 
concrete woRLD. 
There is a further epoche that can be exer-
cised by refraining from participating in and pasit-
ing the "natural attitude" that presupposes the world 
and psychic self-apperception as in the world. The 
result is the "phenomenological" ("transcendental-
phenomenological") reduction, which discloses the 
world, and whatever else is or may be intended to 
and posited, as primarily a NOEMA, an intentiona! ob-
ject as transcendental (i.e., as correlative to "transcen-
dental subjectivity" cum "transcendental intersubjec-
tivity"). Just as the constituting of o ne 's actual psy-

112 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
chic consciousness can be described, so too can the 
constituting of one's actual transcendental conscious-
ness, producing an empirica! transcendental constitu-
tive phenomenology. And just as in the case of the 
purely psychic, a further use of eidetic method yields 
an eidetic transcendental phenomenology, the noe-
matic correlate of which is the whole world and ali 
possible variants of the whole world. The chief task 
of transcendental-constitutive analysis is to examine 
and clarify the structures of transcendental constituting 
consciousness in which the concrete individual world 
is "built up" as an intersubjectively valid meaning 
for constituting consciousness. Husserl then introduces 
specific methodological strategies ofwhat he calls "un-
building" (Abbau) and "building up" (Aufbau) analysis 
appropriately fashioned to a given scope ofsteps ofthe 
transcendental-phenomenological reduction. 
If we include "constitution" in its broadest to its 
narrowest meanings, then transcendental eidetic con-
stitutive phenomenology may be defined as the de-
scription and clarification of ali actual and possible 
originary and non-originary intentionalities in which 
the concrete individual world, and whatever else may 
be intended to in it, are evidentially intended to and 
posited as self-identica! and mutually distinct unities 
built up as having a valid intersubjective sense in and 
through a multiplicity of stratified similar and differ-
ent transcendental processes of consciousness in the 
natural attitude. 
In !ater writings, especially Cartesianische Med-
itationen [ 1913], these analyses are also tailored to 
the distinction between " GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY" 
and "static" phenomenology, introducing explicitly 
what Husserl calls "oriented constituting" according to 
which the task is then to discover how what is "primar-
ily" constituted enters into and acquires the "appear-
ance" of the "secondarily" constituted in a particular 
order at the next highest level of stratified constituting 
and as a horizon ofbeing accessible from the primarily 
constituted. In the broadest meaning of "genesis" in 
Husserl, the constituting of something intended to and 
posited as self-identica! is a "generating" (a "making" 
in the narrower and narrowest meanings of constitut-
ing), membered and articulated at different strata or 
stories of experience. 
There is, however, in the last publications a con-
trasting and strict meaning of "genesis" that pre-
supposes constitutive ( or in this contrast and con-
text, "static") analysis. In Cartesianische Meditatio-
nen (§§ 36f.) "genesis" in the strict sense refers to 
those features ofthe "monad" that are "einmalig," "for 
the first and uniquely only time," and essentially irre-
versible in time. In the case of transcendental consti-
tutive phenomenology, the fundamentally immediate 
phenomenological datum is just that temporal moment 
comprised of retending to what was previously pro-
tended to (the present retention of the previous pro-
tention in the stream of the "inner TIME" of constitut-
ing consciousness). Thus the founding-founded lay-
ers of experience constituted in simultaneity point to 
genetic relations in irreversible succession. "Genetic" 
phenomenology (and in some manuscripts "GENERATIVE 
PHENOMENOLOGY"), clarifying the latter datum ofreten-
tional irreversible succession ("history"), is then con-
trasted with "constitutive" phenomenology, clarifying 
the former datum ofretending to what was previously 
protended to, a datum of simultaneity. 
In !ater publications Husserl also analyzes cases of 
"pre-constitution," which signifies not unconstituted 
or non-constituted, but instead "objects" constituted in 
so-called "primary passivity," such as retentions and 
protentions, as well as cases of affective and cogni-
tive intentionality that do not presuppose involvement 
by the EGO. Here, too, he speaks of constitution by 
"passive" and "active" genesis of intentiona! unities of 
sense--presumably in a narrower, but not the narrowest 
or strict sense ofthe term "genesis." In any case, con-
stitutive phenomenology also includes the domain of 
"pre-constitution" as well. 
In Jdeen 1 and afterwards Husserl insists that ev-
ery genuine philosophical problem must have its solu-
tion in transcendental constitutive analysis, so that for 
every valid proposition in transcendental constitutive 
phenomenology there is a corresponding valid propo-
sition in philosophy, although of necessity the con-
verse is not the case. There are some limits, however, 
set in the view of what Husserl called "transcenden-
tal phenomenological idealism" according to which 
( l) it is spurious in philosophy that there is a rela-
tion between objects of consciousness and things in 
themselves that are not such objects; (2) it is plainly 
false that ali immediate objects of consciousness are 
in the mind; and (3) any proposition in philosophy ex-
pressing the concept of anything that is not constituted 

CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 
113 
is a self-contradictory proposition. Thus transcenden-
tal eidetic constitutive analysis produces knowledge 
that rules out a considerable number of philosophical 
ideas from Platonic realism to Berkeleyian idealism to 
Hegelian dialectics. On the other hand, transcendental 
phenomenological idealism can provide foundations 
as much for Lockean empiricism as for Kantian criti-
ca! philosophy. (1so KERN has compared the notions of 
constitution in Husserl and KANT.) 
A sti li broader meaning of constitutive phenomen-
ology must be mentioned and which appears only 
in Husserl's !ater writings, such as in the revisions 
and drafts of the Cartesianische Meditationen. One 
might even speak of this as a "metaconstitutive pheno-
menology" where, in virtue of yet further refraining, 
there is analysis of the constituting of transcenden-
tal consciousness constitutive of the world in the nat-
ural attitude as the noematic correlate of the phe-
nomenologizing consciousness. Some suggestions in 
late manuscripts would indicate that even a "meta"-
metaconstitutive phenomenology is possible, where 
the noematic correlate is the phenomenologizing con-
sciousness constitutive of transcendental conscious-
ness in the natural attitude. 
Transcendental constitutive phenomenology, as 
does phenomenology generally for Husserl, purports 
to be a science: a transcendental eidetic constitutive 
phenomenology. As an eidetic science, transcendental 
constitutive phenomenology describes, clarifies, and 
produces a body of knowledge about the constituting 
of"essences" (formal and material, from "universals" 
to "verbal expressions"), establishing in eidetic uni-
versality those laws that "prescribe for every factual 
statement about something transcendental the possi-
ble sense" of that statement. The eidetic science of 
essences establishes the laws of pure possibility that 
make possible a science ofthe actual as a science. 
The inftuence of Husserl 's transcendental constitu-
tive phenomenology has been diverse, and the vari-
ous phenomenological questions raised in the devel-
opment ofthe idea ofconstitution have taken different 
directions. Some phenomenologists whose work has, 
in one way or another, continued the development of 
Husserl 's constitutive phenomenology in various fields 
are EUGEN FINK, especially in his articles from the 1930s 
(with critica! stock-taking in "Les concepts operatoires 
dans la phenomenologie de Husserl" in 1957); LUD-
WIG LANDGREBE in articles dating from the 1930s and 
1940s ("The World as a Phenomenological Problem," 
"Husserls Phanomenologie und die Motive zu ihrer 
Umbi]dung"), DORION CAIRNS ("1dea]ity of Verbal Ex-
pressions," 1941 ); ARON GURWITSCH ("Phenomenology 
ofThematicsandofthe Pure Ego," 1929, "The Problem 
of Existence in Constitutive Phenomenology," 1961 ), 
ALFRED SCHUTZ (Der sinnhafie Aufbau der sozialen 
Weft, 1932); ROMAN INGARDEN (Das literarische Kunst-
werk, 1931 ); HANS REINER ("Sinn und Recht des 
phanomenologische Methode," 1959); OSKAR BECKER 
("Beitrage zur phanomenologischen Begriindung der 
Geometrie und ihrer physikalischen Anwendungen," 
1923); JEAN-PAUL SARTRE (L 'imaginaire, 1940); and 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY (Phenomenofogie de fa per-
ception, 1945). 
Because of its ostensible association with "ide-
alism" 
(even 
in 
Husserl's 
sense), 
constitutive 
phenomenology has, on occasion, been contrasted 
with HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY (HANS-GEORG 
GADAMER), Of with REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY (from the 
ontoJogy OfHEDWIG CONRAD-MARTIUS and the epistemo]-
ogy of ALEXANDER PFĂNDER to the "Daseinsanafytik" 
of MARTIN HEIDEGGER). However, there would seem to 
be no reason why constitutive phenomenology should 
preclude a realism or not be amenable to the results 
of a hermeneutica! philosophy ( or even a "hermeneuti-
callogic" such as that of HANS LIPPS). Husserl himself 
called for a CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE NAT-
URAL ATTITUDE in his "Nachwort zu meinen 'Ideen'" 
( 1930), which was explicitly pursued by Schutz. Con-
stitutive phenomenology can be extended to include 
"personalistic," "naturalistic," and scientific attitudes 
as well as the "phenomenological" attitude itself. Fi-
nally, examples of eidetic constitutive phenomenology 
can be found in the writings of JEAN HERING ("Be-
merkungen iiber das Wesen, die Wesenheit und die 
Idee," 1926) and ROMAN INGARDEN ("Essentia]e Fragen. 
Ein Beitrag zu dem Wesensproblem," 1925).

CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE NAT-
URAL ATTITUDE 
AJthough CONSTITUTIVE 
PHENOMENOLOGY primarily signifies the transcendental 
first philosophy that was developed beginning with ED-
MUND HUSSERL 's ldeen zu einer reinen Phanomenologie 
und phanomenologischen Philosophie 1 (1913 ), there 
is a secondary signification. ldeen 1 compared and 
contrasted phenomenological philosophy with empir-
ica! psychology such that while both relied on re-
flection in the forms of self-observation and empathy 
(Einfuhlung), the former was to be specifically tran-
scendental and EIDETIC, while the latter was tobe specif-
ically empirica] or factual and also mundane, worldly, 
or "in the natural attitude." This position was subse-
quently refined such that the posthumously published 
lectures on Phănomenologische Psychologie [ 1925] 
minimize the purposes of first philosophy and the 
Encyclopaedia Britannica entry on "Phenomenology" 
(1929), Formale und transzendentale Logik (1929), 
and Cartesianische Meditationen [ 1931] make the sys-
tematic place within phenomenology for a worldly and 
eidetic intentiona! psychology clear and distinct. 
For Husserl, this phenomenological PSYCHOLOGY 
would focus on the various modes of INTENTIONALITY. 
It would be a positive or special science rather than 
first philosophy and would thus require, like ali spe-
cial sciences, a transcendental grounding. The recog-
nition of such a special positive science is presup-
posed in the late philosophical issues of transcendental 
PSYCHOLOGISM and of the way to phenomenological 
philosophy from psychology discussed in Die Krisis 
der europaischen Wissenschaften und die transzenden-
tale Phănomenologie ( 1936). At the same time, the 
analyses of, e.g., perceptual syntheses, that are pre-
sented in philosophical writings can be taken as mun-
dane psychological analyses, i.e., as analyses pertain-
ing to psyches without their being-in-the-world being 
suspended by transcendenta] EPOCHE AND REDUCTION, 
which is how Husserl proceeds in Phanomenologische 
Psychologie. In his "Nachwort zu meinen 'ldeen zu 
einer reinen Phănomenologie und phănomenologische 
Philosophie"' (1930), he then asserts that "there is 
a thoroughgoing parallelism between a correctly ex-
ecuted phenomenological psychology and a transcen-
dental phenomenology" and that "pure inner psychol-
ogy, the genuine psychology of intentionality ... , re-
veals itself through and through as the constitutive 
phenomenology ofthe natural attitude." 
Other constitutive phenomenologists, particularly 
ARON GURWITSCH in The Fie/d o(Consciousness (1964), 
recognized this non-transcendental version of consti-
tutive phenomenology, but ALFRED scHUTZ, beginning 
in Der sinnhafie Aufbau der sozialen Welt ( 1932), was 
the first, most explicit, and most emphatic developer 
ofthe "constitutive phenomenology ofthe natural atti-
tude." Schutz's project offounding the HUMAN SCIENCES 
in a phenomenological psychology is as philosophical 
as the long-standing naturalistic efforts to found the 
natural sciences in physics. He drew on various works 
of HENRI BERGSON as well as Husserl 's Vorlesungen zur 
Phanomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins [ 1905] 
for his analysis of ACTION in general as projected, exe-
cuted, and retrospectively interpreted and then its spec-
ification as social action, a central category for Austrian 
ECONOMICS as well as for the interpretive SOCIOLOGY 
of MAX WEBER. Especially in "On Multiple Realities" 
(1945) and "Symbol, Reality, and Society" (1955) he 
ventured further and on his own into the phenomen-
ological psychology ofworking, imagining, dreaming, 
and scientific theorizing. In the latter respect, there is 
a rich description ofthe processes by which models of 
personal and communal selves, actions, and products 
are constructed in psychological, social, and historical 
sciences are idealized. 
Schutz was also concerned with how worldly oth-
ers can become constituted for a worldly EGO and then 
how an 'T' and a "thou" can forma "we" in contrast to

a "he," "she," or "they." Furthermore, while "consoci-
ates" can understand and act upon one another directly, 
"contemporaries," who are also ali ve at the same time, 
can only do so indirectly. Then again, "predecessors" 
can be understood but not acted upon by the living per-
sons, and "successors" can be acted upon, e.g., through 
the writing of a will, but not understood. In these and 
other ways Schutz accounted for not only social action 
but also the social world by reflecting upon and ei-
detically describing the processes of act ing and under-
standing in which objects of ali sorts- fellow humans 
living, dead, and unborn and individually and in groups 
included -are constituted as having, in a broad sig-
nification, MEANING for subjects. A specification ofthe 
human or cultural sciences follows: predecessors make 
up the subject matter of the historical sciences, while 
contemporaries are investigated in the various social 
sciences -living individual subjects are subject mat-
ters for psychology, and consociates are presumably 
parts of the subject matter of social psychology. 
Husserl emphasized phenomenological psychology, 
but it would seem, on the basis ofSchutz's thought, that 
a phenomenological sociology is also possible that at-
tempts to describe the constituted structures ofworldly 
communal or intersubjective life. Constitutive pheno-
menology of the natural attitude in COMMUNICOLOGY, 
ECONOMICS, EDUCATION, ETHNIC STUDIES, FILM STUDIES, GE-
OGRAPHY, POLITICAL SCIENCE, NURSING, PSYCHIATRY, and 
other CULTURAL DISCIPLINES is equally quite possibJe, 
although the disciplinary purposes of each of these 
are different from those of first philosophy. Interest-
ingly, while phenomenological social science, for ex-
ample, might be begun or advanced by treating some 
of Husserl 's descriptions of transcendental INTERSUB-
JECTIVITY as worldly, ifthere is a thoroughgoing paral-
lelism, as he asserts, then sociologica! and psycholog-
ical analyses of a constitutive-phenomenological sort 
conducted in the natural attitude should yield parallel 
descriptions pertaining to conscious life in its transcen-
dental status. Husserl himself does seem to transpose 
mundane historical analyses of MODERN PHILOSOPHY 
and the natural and human sciences from the natural 
attitude to the transcendental in the Krisis and else-
where. 
Psychological and other types of constitutive pheno-
menology ofthe natural attitude required, for Husserl, 
transcendental grounding and Gurwitsch, for exam-
ple, followed him in this. Schutz, however, ultimately 
tended instead toward a PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 
as the fundamental (and worldly) philosophical disci-
pline. This would be a type of what might be called 
"mundanism" in that a non-worldly ground is not 
sought for the world and the sciences of it. It would not 
be a NATURALISM because the world, being cultural, is 
more than nature. Nevertheless, insofar as objects are 
constitutively accounted for in terms of the processes 
ofperceiving, expecting, remembering, thinking, feei-
ing, working, etc., in which they are intended to as 
meaningful- i.e., they present themselves with val-
ues and purposes or cultural characteristics- then it 
would be a constitutive phenomenology even if not 
transcendental. 
Especially the earJy work of JEAN-PAUL SARTRE on 
IMAGINATION and EMOTION is constitutive phenomen-
oJogy of the natural attitude implicitly, as is much of 
the rest of EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY, which can be 
said to rely on a reflective and eidetic but not transcen-
dental approach and to adapt Husserlian concepts and 
analyses, but to pursue not transcendental philosophy 
but EXISTENTIALISM, which is also mundanism. Some 
constitutive analyses ofthe natural attitude may also be 
discerned in REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY and HERMENEU-
TIC AL PHENOMENOLOGY when intentiona! experiences 
and correlative objects as they present themselves are 
reflected upon in self and others. Constitutive pheno-
menology ofthe natural attitude appears widely shared 
within the phenomenological movement, whether the 
Husserlian title and authorization for the worldly con-
strual ofhis transcendental descriptions are recognized 
or not.lt is likely that much fu ture phenomenologywill 
continue to be conducted as mundane, worldly, or "in 
the natural attitude." How consciously constitutive it 
will be is, however, difficult to say.

CRITICAL THEORY 
The relationship be-
tween the phenomenology founded by EDMUND HUSSERL 
and the critica! theory that was set in motion by Max 
Horkheimer (1895-1975) is not the kind of relation 
one finds in a genuine dialogue between two philo-
sophical schools that are in an open exchange of ideas 
with one another. What we have is a one-sided at-
tempt on the part of critica! theory somehow to re-
late to phenomenology. This manifests itself in three 
steps: approximation, taking distance, and incorpora-
tion. Phenomenology adopted a wait-and-see attitude 
in re gard to these three forms of treatment; yet in the 
final analysis this appeared not to be the weaker at-
titude. What Husserl said in 1935 to the effect that 
he, the alleged reactionary, is really much more radical 
and revolutionary than those who take themselves tobe 
revolutionary already indicates that phenomenology is 
not willing to subordinate itself under schemas others 
attempt to impose on it. 
The first steps of critica! theory were formed phe-
nomenologically. Horkheimer and his !ater collabora-
tor, Theodore W. Adorno ( 1903-1969 ), came as stu-
dents in contact with phenomenology through their 
mentor in philosophy, Hans Cornelius (1863-1947), 
who, starting from 
KANT, had developed a pheno-
menological psychology and theory of knowledge on 
the hasis of Husserl 's work. In addition, both studied 
the principles of GEST ALT PSYCHOLOGY under Adhemar 
Gelb (1887-1936)~ principles that in the 1940s and 
1950s played an inftuential part in phenomenology in 
FRANCE via ARON GURWITSCH. On the advice of Cor-
nelius, Horkheimer went in 1921 to Freiburg, where 
he took courses with Husserl and MARTIN HEIDEGGER. 
In 1923 he received his Ph.D. under Cornelius's guid-
ance with a thesis on Kant, after an attempt concern ing 
Gestalt psychology had failed. Adorno 's dissertation 
on Husserl followed only one year !ater. Another en-
trance into phenomenology was found by Herbert Mar-
cuse ( 1898-1979), who became Heidegger 's assistant 
in 1928. In "Beitrage zu einer Phanomenologie des 
historischen Materialismus," which was published in 
the same year, Marcu se explored the possibilities of a 
synthesis of Heidegger and MARX. 
We must also mention here Siegfried Kracauer 
( 1889-1966), who was close to the circ le around 
Horkheimer and who already in 1922 presented a soci-
ology that is oriented toward phenomenology. On the 
whole, the inftuence of phenomenology on the early 
critica! theory has been of various intensities. Particu-
larly in the case of Adorno it is clear that Husserl is the 
philosopher whom he most often made the theme of 
a separate investigation. Husserl 's phenomenology re-
mained for Adorno a challenge against which he tested 
his own ideas on severa! occasions. 
Let us briefty recall the state of the problem from 
which Adorno took his point of departure in his disser-
tation on Die Transzendenz des Dinglichen und Noe-
matischen in Husserls Phanomenologie (The transcen-
dence of the thinglike and the noematic in Husserl 's 
phenomenology, 1924 ). Adorno 's teacher, Cornelius, 
had assumed that everything is to be proved before 
the court of appeals of a knowing consciousness. Even 
things that are alien to us can be reduced to known 
facts of consciousness. Reftection begins in experi-
ence, but it transcends this in the direction of a do-
main of concepts. In Husserl the situation is com-
pletely different: ali knowledge is related to things 
that remain transcendent to consciousness. Adorno in-
tended to clarify this opposition, and this led him fi-
nally to the view in which he defended the pure phi-
losophy ofimmanence ofhis teacher Cornelius against 
Husserl's ldeen zu einer reinen Phanomenologie und

CRITICAL THEORY 
117 
phiinomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913). In his apol-
ogy A dom o comes to the conclusion that things arenei-
ther transcendent entities nor immediate experiences, 
but rather laws for immediate experiences that are con-
stituted solely through the connection or continuity 
of our personal consciousness. The concept ofNOEMA 
disintegrates and Husserl is criticized: because of his 
assumption that things ha ve a meaning of their own, 
he misses the true sense of transcendental idealism. 
Adorno wanted to outdo Husserl intellectualistically; 
we do not yet find a trace here of his !ater criticism of 
the dominination of identifying thinking. 
The fundamental 
change 
in 
critica! 
theory, 
which co-determined Adorno 's !ater materialistic and 
ideology-critical perspective on Husserl, carne about 
through Horkheimer's programmatic paper "Tradi-
tionelle und kritische Theorie" ( 193 7). Here theories 
are taken to be traditional if they strive after a confor-
mity between facts and the conceptual order; following 
the natural sciences, this order takes the form of a uni-
versal system of signs that is tobe taken as the key to the 
order of the world. Horkheimer objects to traditional 
theory on the ground that it does not take into account 
that facts are socially preformed and that a conceptual 
classification is not a domain that is isolated from so-
ciety. Finally, he also claims that the relation between 
concepts and facts is not achieved in the head of the 
researcher, but rather in industry. 
Since the sociologies of Durkheim and MAX 
SCHELER, the positivists and the pragmatists are classed 
with traditional theory in empirica! science. Then it is 
shown that sociology has a social function that it is not 
at ali, or not sufficiently, willing to admit. Its function 
consists in the production ofuseful knowledge, which 
serves the reproduction of capitalist society. By ap-
pealing to HEGEL and MARX, critica! theory overcomes 
traditional dualism in a critica! attitude that is guided by 
its concern to eliminate society's injustice as well as by 
its concern to organize society rationally. This goal can 
be attained because the world is made through human 
praxis and is thus also changeable. 
Husserl 's work stands diagonally opposite to the 
distinction between "traditional" and "critica!" theory. 
The doctrine of INTENTIONALITY prohibits a dualism as 
a starting point. Husserl opposes a complete reduc-
tion of a theory of things to a theory of signs, which 
only have the meaning of a game empty of mean-
ing; he shows that the sciences have their foundation 
in the LIFEWORLD; and finally, he hopes to be able to 
attain a new humanity through phenomenological in-
sights. This does not mean that Husserl was a critica! 
theorist, but only that he was not just a traditionalist. 
This notwithstanding, Horkheimer nonetheless asso-
ciates him with those who belong to the domain of tra-
ditional theory. As proof for this Horkheimer merely 
cites some passages from Formale und transzenden-
tale Logik ( 1929) in which Husserl in positive terms 
speaks about the scientific ideal of a closed system of 
statements. In the book Dialektik der Aufkliirung (Di-
alectic of the enlightenment, 194 7) that Horkheimer 
and Adorno wrote conjointly while in exile in Califor-
nia, they quote Husserl 's characterization of Galileo 's 
mathematization of nature in an ambiguous manner, 
without letting Husserl speak in his own words. 
This way of reading phenomenology, which in 
the final analysis is selective and simplifies mat-
ters, has a prehistory that has been documented in 
Horkheimer's lectures, which have meanwhile been 
published from manuscripts. In 1926 Horkheimer, who 
then was just promoted to university lecturer, recon-
structed Husserl 's Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-
1901 ), sti li in the style of an academician who pro-
cedes strictly immanently. Only two years !ater we 
find an indication of what finally in 1937 would lead 
to the characterization of phenomenology as a tradi-
tional theory. Horkheimer accuses Husserl of a lack 
of dialectic, which would result from an untenable, 
static ontology. Husserl 's doctrine of EVIDENCE would 
make a specific position ofknowledge into an absolute 
one because it would refuse to take into consideration 
any conditions that mediate a form of knowledge and 
change it. In a lecture of 1954 we find a milder tone 
being used; Husserl 's criticism of NATURALISM is rec-
ognized as a great achievement. The !ater Horkheimer 
no Ion ger displays the radicality of his early phase. 
The politica! aspect ofthe confrontation with pheno-
menology is strengthened when Herbert Marcuse dis-
tanced himselffrom Heidegger. Although Marcuse was 
occupied since the 1950s with an effort to integrate PSY-
CHOANALYSIS and Marxism, we still find motifs from 
Heidegger and Husserl operative in his last great work, 
One-Dimensional Man (1964). And yet Marcuse did 
not Jet Heidegger's behavior and theory construction 
during the time of National Socialism pass by without 

118 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
comment. Already in 1934 he pointed to the common-
alities between the politica! and philosophical EXISTEN-
TIALISM ofCarl Schmitt and Heidegger. In an exchange 
of letters from the 1940s that has not yet been pub-
lished, Marcuse calls Heidegger to account, who, also 
in this case, persisted in silence, although he used many 
words in his response. 
The orientation that is at once a critique of ideol-
ogy and a critique of knowledge, which critica! the-
ory adopted in the mid-1930s, offered Adorno an op-
portunity to determine anew his position in regard to 
Husserl. It was prepared in two manuscripts written 
in 193 7 and completed in his Metakritik der Erkennt-
nistheorie (Metacriticism of the theory of knowledge, 
1956). He again accuses Husserl of failing to meet the 
matters themselves. And this time he makes this claim 
not because Husserl is too little attached to idealism, 
but rather because he is too much attached to it. 
Adorno turns his own position of 1924 exactly into 
its opposite. Husserl would go beyond the doubt of 
Descartes, while he pursues the ideal of a transcenden-
tal EGO that is free of ali facts and is completely by 
itself in the sphere of its own ownness. By this move, 
phenomenology would come into contradiction with 
itself, for the transsubjective "matters themselves" are 
articulated only as covering images (Deckbilder) of 
consciousness; in this way the proximity to the mat-
ters, free from ali construction, is thus missed. Adorno 
develops his arguments in the direction of a critique of 
ideology; he reproaches Husserl because the reduction 
to immediate experiences immanent in consciousness 
would have been formed through a reifying thinking 
that, in addition, thinks in terms ofpossessions, which 
is analogous to the attitude of the owners of private 
property who are afraid of dispossession. In this we 
see the restorative and bourgeois character of pheno-
menology, which lacks the capacity for social critique. 
Adomo's alternative to these epistemological and po-
litica! acts of violence, which appropriate something 
that is alien, would result from the insight that it is 
impossible to be able to conceive matters in concepts 
without a surplus in non-identity. In this way it is not 
only the case that the question of how the "matters 
themselves" are to be grasped is posed in a new way, 
but also the decisive keyword is given for Adomo's 
philosophy of the 1960s. 
In his Negative Dialektik ( 1966), Adorno runs into 
a fundamental paradox. There is no immediate access 
to reality, but only one that is mediated by concepts. 
Yet concepts bring matters to expression while at the 
same time they fail them. From this the paradoxical 
task arises of going beyond concepts in order to attain 
the utopia of an unconstrained interaction with what is 
other and alien, which for Adorno is the central theme 
of a critica! AESTHETICS. Even ifwe take the formulation 
of this utopia by itself, we see that Adorno comes 
closer and closer to French phenomenology (MAURICE 
MERLEAU-PONTY, EMMANUEL LEVI NAS). Adorno 's thought 
maintained a phenomenological tenor to the end, even 
though it is true that in his official exchange of ideas 
he was never able to fully come to grips with the basic 
content of Husserl 's philosophy. 
In the 1960s a new chapter of critica! theory and 
its involvement with phenomenology was opened by 
Jiirgen Habermas. Husserl is here associated again with 
traditional theory, but Habermas determines this type 
oftheory differently than Horkheimer. Traditional the-
ory is now identified with ancient metaphysics, whose 
guiding clue Husserl appears to follow insofar as here-
peats the claim ofancient theeria, namely, that notwith-
standing its alienation from everyday life, it can make 
available a form of knowledge that would be relevant 
to action and life. In Husserl 's case this claim must 
fail because phenomenology is no longer able to count 
on the cosmos and its ideal measures to which the soul 
could approximate itself. No practica! norms for action 
will follow from phenomenological descriptions. The 
effort to secure these norms under postmetaphysical 
conditions has been the main concern of Habermas's 
efforts up to the present. 
With his Theorie des kommunikativen Handelns 
(Theory of communicative action, 1981 ), Habermas 
completes a "linguistic turn" to the paradigm of 
communicative understanding and agreement through 
which he distances himself from the foundations of 
the older critica! theory; he follows the normative idea 
that linguistic efforts to come to an agreement are ori-
ented toward actual agreement. Any time we speak, we 
simultaneously make three validity claims (namely, re-
garding truth, correctness, and truthfulness) that can be 
accepted by the partners of our con versation. If it comes 
to that, an agreement will follow that has validity. If 
it does not come to that, those who speak can exam-
ine the validity of their claims in a discursive process 

CRITICAL THEORY

of argumentation, in order to work toward a lasting 
knowledge. In this new critica! theory that appeals less 
to Hegel and Marx, but rather more to Kant, pheno-
menological insights are taken into account only in a 
limited way. What is rejected here is the transcendental 
egology, because it is unable to explain the founda-
tions of INTERSUBJECTIVITY, the normative claims made 
by phenomenology, and the conception of an open and 
productive action that was defended by Merleau-Ponty. 
Habermas did integrate the theory ofthe lifeworld that 
is contained in the publications of ALFRED scHUTZ and 
THOMAS LUCKMANN; yet here too, he objects to its cul-
tural abridgment insofar as it is above ali not able to 
say much about the dimensions of society. 
For Habermas the lifeworld is a concept that is com-
plementary to communicative action. Every situation 
that involves speaking and action is part of the life-
world, which is the all-encompassing horizon within 
which linguistic understanding comes about. In the 
light of this specific -
and for Habermas relevant 
-aspect of understanding and agreement, he defines 
the lifeworld as a stock of unshaken patterns of inter-
pretation that are linguistically organized and that can 
commonly be used by those who take part in com-
municative action for the purpose of ca-operative pro-
cesses ofinterpretation. For the newer phenomenology, 
this effort to narrow the conception of the lifeworld, 
in part already predelineated by Schutz, became an oc-
casion in Germany for a far-reaching discussion that 
originated from an alternative reading of Husserl. In so 
do ing, the newer phenomenology appealed not only to 
the programmatic works published by Husserl himself, 
but also to the manuscripts that he left behind and that 
have been published in the Husserliana edition. 
This criticism begins with the thesis that Habermas 
is unable to explain satisfactorily how the stock oflin-
guistic and symbolic patterns to which those engaged 
in communicative action appeal has originated. The 
result of the insight that Habermas neglected this ge-
nealogical question anticipates recognition ofthe inno-
vations, productions, and institutions that come about 
from various incidents. Because the lifeworld origi-
nates in this way and is a field of the art of living that 
works on tradition, it is more than a mere warehouse. 
Actions and utterances are embedded in a bodily form 
of orienting behavior and cannot be limited to the in-
trahuman domain. Every form of praxis responds to 
mute experiential claims and invitations that flow from 
the things and that withdraw from complete technical 
control. Because the new phenomenology asks about 
the foundational relation between language and expe-
rience, one is now able to delineate the possibility of 
a genuine dialogue between phenomenology and criti-
ca! theory. Such a dialogue should start from how the 
turn toward the intersubjective dimensions of action 
brought to light by Habermas has led to the insight 
that the relation between agents and the world of ex-
perience is conceived in too onesided a manner. Such 
a dialogue could perhaps lead to the problematic for 
which we could use the labels LANGUAGE and POLITICS. 
Already severa! years ago some representatives of 
critica! theory have pointed out that the !ater philoso-
phy of Adorno was by no means transcended by Haber-
mas's turn to the theory oflanguage. For Adorno him-
selfhad developed an implicit philosophy oflanguage 
whose assumptions concern ing the formation ofmean-
ing that is linguistically available were not taken into 
account by Habermas. According to Adorno, the man-
ner in which significations that are linguistically com-
municable are constituted consists in how phenomena 
that are not yet linguistically available are brought to 
language. Yet through this achievement oflanguage, no 
agreement between language and reality is yet brought 
about, because in linguistic understanding reality with-
draws from a full linguisticization through its perma-
nent surplus in non-identity. Here Adorno is in agree-
ment not only with Husserl 's insight that because of 
an abundance in what is given, one can find an in-
adequation in adequation, but above ali with the !ater 
philosophy of the French phenomenologist, Merleau-
Ponty. 
In a manner that is not dissimilar to the o ne followed 
by Adorno, Merleau-Ponty begins with the assumption 
that there is no immcdiate access to reality. Whatever 
is given never appears purely as it itself, because it 
is always also a production of a significative achieve-
ment. The linguistic expression that is involved in the 
constitution of MEANING and that moves between the 
pure reproduction of an experience and a fu li construc-
tion ofreality is characterized by an essential paradox: 
it translates an experience that nonetheless itself first 
becomes a text through the word that awakens it. The 
achievement by speech breaks the silence of an ex-
perience, which already in and from itself pushes in 

120 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the direction of language and attains in this way what 
keeping silent meant to say, but could not achieve. 
Yet this realization is nota complete one, because lan-
guage speaks insofar as it always also conceals certain 
experiences that as a surplus of possibilities push fur-
ther in the direction of language. The relation between 
language and experience is therefore discontinuous. 
Speaking does not just pursue the lines indicated by 
experience, but brings experience over into another 
order. It breaks silence open and in doing so assumes 
violent traits. Speech at the same time remains a source 
for creations, because it lets something enter into being 
that previously could not yet be encountered as being 
ready-at-hand. These determinations ofMerleau-Ponty 
have left traces in French philosophy in the publica-
tions ofMICHEL FOUCAULT, JACQUES DERRIDA, Corne]ius 
Castoriadis ( 1926-1984 ), and Pierre Bourdieu. 
Already Husserl himself had made an effort to free 
phenomenology from the weakness of allegedly be-
ing unable to make a positive contribution to politica! 
philosophy. In the 1950s Merleau-Ponty examined the 
possibilities of a dialogue between phenomenology and 
Marxism, which in the 1970s was developed further on 
an internationallevel. There are convergences between 
phenomenologists and Marxists in the conviction that 
the lifeworld and life-praxis is the place where change 
in the social realm occurs. Every changing praxis is 
mediated by reinterpretations of a dominant interpre-
tation ofreality that itself is practica! in nature because 
it springs from a process of interpretation. By proceed-
ing along this way oflooking at things phenomenology 
enters the field of language and politics. 
Modern POLITIC AL PHILOSOPHY takes its point of de-
parture from the idea that many interpretations of a 
social event are possible and therefore, since Hobbes, 
it asks the question ofwhich interpretati an is the legiti-
mate one. Insofar as one now begins from the perspec-
tive of phenomenology with the conviction that each 
interpretation is always also to be verified in regard 
to the matters to be interpreted, a majority decision 
concern ing which interpretation of a politica! speaker 
is the legitimate one, which received the greatest ap-
proval on the part ofthe social world, is excluded. The 
same is also true for the solution by sheer power ac-
cording to which any optional interpretation could be 
accepted insofar as it can be carried through by vio-
lence. In the final analysis the search for TRUTH, too, 
runs into limits because every interpretation is selective 
and a matter can never be comprehended adequately. 
Should it turn out to be the case that the pluralism of 
interpretations is unavoidable, then at the moral level 
the question must be asked under what conditions a 
coexistence of interpretations of different kinds would 
be possible. In this situation a coalition of REASON and 
power is predelineated whose form, however, needs 
further clarification. 
Phenomenology is not a critica! theory. Yet it is a 
critica! philosophy that asks the question of how far a 
practica! interpretation exhausts a situation, what this 
interpretation says, and what it conceals. By reinterpre-
tation a dynamic is kept alive in the social world that 
opens up new possibilities and perspectives in regard 
to the creative transformation of situations, structures, 
and institutions.

CULTURAL DISCIPLINES 
In this ti tie the word 
"discipline" connotes an advanced degree of prepara-
tion, one that is beyond the crafts and tends today to 
be received in professional schools and institutions of 
higher learning. Being disciplined is being highly ed-
ucated or highly trained. The word "science" shares 
this connotation of advanced preparation, but "disci-
pline" can readily cover not only cognitive disciplines 
but also axiotic disciplines ( e.g., LITERATURE) that ulti-
mately foster enjoyment and practica! disciplines such 
as MEDICINE. As for the use of "cultural" instead of 
"human" to differentiate the genus of disciplines in 
question, there is increasing recognition that various 
species of nonhuman animals, first of ali chimpanzees 
and bonobos, ha ve basic culture, that primate ethology 
is therefore a cultural science, and that ethology can be 
used in a comparative way to help clarify what human 
culture is. (Already in the 1930s the phenomenologists 
ARON GURWITSCH and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY reftected 
on the GEST ALT PSYCHOLOGY ofWoJfgang KohJer ( 1887-
1967) regarding chimpanzees and, given the great re-
cent advances in primate ethology, more phenomen-
ological reftection in this respect is called for.) 
"Cultural disciplines" is thus first of ali proposed as 
a replacement for "HUMAN scJENCES," which is widely 
used as an English translation of the tit le Geisteswis-
senschafien made prominent by WILHELM DILTHEY as an 
equivalent to John Stuart Miii 's "moral sciences" (there 
are equivalents in other languages). Sometimes "so-
ciocultural sciences," "history, social science, and psy-
chology," or simply "social sciences" (when construed 
broadly enough to include history and psychology) are 
also used in English. This is not merely a question ofthe 
administrative structure of the university, as it might 
seem to participants in specialized disciplines. Against 
positivism, whereby ali other sciences ha ve been urged 
to imitate modern mathematical natural science, sev-
era! 20th century European philosophical schools of 
thought, including phenomenology, contend that the 
general sut>ject matter, perhaps best called the cultural 
WORLD, determines a distinct genus of science, a genus 
with severa! species and a number of particular cultural 
sciences under it.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Even more interesting is the Continental thesis ofthe 
ontologica! and epistemological priority ofthe cultural 
to the natural and formal sciences. The cultural sci-
ences differ from NATURAL SCIENCE and a]so MATHEMAT-
ICS and LOGIC in that their approaches necessarily and 
concretely involve emphasizing rather than abstracting 
from the cultural characteristics of value and purpose 
that ali objects of conscious life originally ha ve. Then, 
ifthe concrete precedes the abstract and the contentual 
the formal, the cultural sciences have primacy. What 
consequently seem best called the "cultural sciences" 
are not, however, the only ways in which historical, 
personal, social, economic, linguistic, technological, 
etc., aspects and thus cultural worlds can be encoun-
tered and related to in disciplined ways. 
When the doxic stratum predominates in a disci-
plined approach, the cultural discipline, e.g., HISTORY, 
can be called, specifically, a cognitive discipline or 
science. When the evaluative or "pathic" stratum pre-
dominates in what a discipline, e.g., THEATER, fosters, 
the cultural discipline can be called, specifically, an 
axiotic discipline. And when the "praxic" or volitional 
stratum predominates, there is a practica! discipline, 
e.g., PSYCHIATRY. Undergoing advanced preparation in 
a particular discipline involves acquiring an attitude 
that belongs to a species and genus, e.g., a sociologica! 
attitude is a specifically social scientific attitude and a 
generically scientific attitude or an archaeological atti-
tude is a specifically historical scientific attitude. The 
subject matters or fields ofthe particular disciplines and 
their species and genera correlate with such attitudes. 
Techniques involving advanced preparation are es-
sential to cultural disciplines ofthe practicat sort, e.g., 
NURSING, inasmuch as the functions or uses of objects 
as ends and means in practica! life are not abstracted 
from but emphasized in them. As the using of equip-
ment, TECHNOLOGY is not necessarily science-based, but 
often it can be based on cultural, natural, and/or for-
mal science and, when it is, then the cognitive results 
attained in sciences ofthose sorts become parts ofthe 
means employed in the disciplined form of practicat 
life. The same is the case when axiotic disciplines, 
e.g., ARCHITECTURE, rely on history, mathematics, biol-
ogy, physics, etc., but foster valuing and value. This 
notion of a "science-based discipline" thus goes be-
yond and has more balance than "applied science," 
which can misleadingly intimate that ali practica! disci-
plines must be scientific technologies or that a practice 
is based on but one science. The connotation that the 
applied is derivative and thus somehow inferior to the 
pure is also avoided; cognitive efforts plainly derive a 
great deal from practicat ones and, in any case, action 
is not ali that can be founded upon cognition. 
Phenomenologically considered, cultural objects, 
situations, and worlds are fundamentally constituted 
in secondarily passive positional ( or thetic) life, which 
is to say, with EDMUND HUSSERL, that reflection on the 
NOEMA can disc Iose positional characteristics in objects 
as they present themselves and as they are intended to 
in the habitual strata of believing, valuing, and will-
ing that occur within personal and communallife. It is 
preferable to call the characteristics that objects have 
as believed in, as valued, and as willed cultural charac-
teristics rather than "MEANING" because confusion with 
the significations of words and also the odd view that 
culture is entirely linguistic are evaded, and because 
specification in terms ofbelief-characteristics, values, 
and uses is invited. 
As secondarily passive, the strata of conscious life 
in which cultural objects are pre-linguistically and pre-
predicatively constituted are, in a broad signification, 
leamed. The learning in question is not primarily a 
result of deliberate instruction, but rather occurs in 
the main through imitation and the indirect influences 
one necessarily undergoes from others in sociohistori-
callife. This is how there can bea diversity of cultural 
worlds, lives, situations, and practices. The reflectively 
observable and describable noematic positional char-
acteristics can be called doxic or belief characteristics, 
intrinsic and extrinsic values, and ends- and means-
uses. In these terms, systems of values and uses and 
also belief systems ofvarious scopes can be recognized 
as constituted in basic cultural life. Value-objects and 
use-objects can be objectivated and called goods, bads, 
and positively and negatively useful equipment,just as 
belief objects can be objectivated and called beings and 
nonbeings. 
The "cultural disciplines" have already in effect 
-
but not under this title -
been reflected upon to 
some degree throughout phenomenology. In CONSTI-
TUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE NATURAL ATTITUDE the 
foundations in commonsense thinking for the terms, 
the methods, and the conceptual component ofthe sub-
ject matter ofthe social sciences ha ve been emphasized 

CZECHOSLOVAKIA

by ALFRED SCHUTZ; THOMAS M. SEEBOHM has attempted 
to ground the methodology of the historical sciences 
transcendentally; RICHARD M. ZANER has reflected on 
MEDICINE; and LESTER EMBREE has reflected on archae-
oJogy. The HERMENEUTIC AL PHENOMENOLOGY ofthe cui~ 
tura! disciplines has been extensively developed, al-
though yet again not under this new title, in the work 
of HANS-GEORG GADAMER, DON IHDE, and JOSEPH J. KOCK-
ELMANS. The EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY of HANNAH 
ARENDT, SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, 
and JEAN-PAUL SARTRE and aJso the REALISTIC PHENOMEN-
OLOGY of MAX SCHELER contain many insights of rele-
van ce especially regarding evaluational and practica! 
life in cultural situations and worlds. The phenomen-
ological theories of ACTION and VALUE are plainly also 
relevant. 
That the genus of discipline entitled cultural disci-
plines, with its three species and various subspecies 
and particulars, proves to be the most populated genus 
of discipline may help explain why it has been diffi-
cult previously to recognize, but this ignorance too can 
be overcome and the benefits of conscious affiliation 
gained. The relevance of the cultural disciplines for 
multidisciplines such as ETHNIC STUDIES is conspicuous. 
It can also be asked if phenomenological philosophy 
is itselfultimately a cognitive discipline, an evaluative 
discipline, ora practica! discipline. DORION CAIRNS, for 
example, held the latter tobe the case.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
The history of pheno-
menology in Czechoslovakia, strictly speaking, be-
gins only in 1929, but three issues related to its pre-
history should be mentioned. The fact that EDMUND 
HUSSERL was born on Czech territory and spent his pre-
university years there (except for one school year in 
Vienna) does not imply much of specifically Czech 
influence, since both his and his wife's families be-
longed to the German-speaking Jewish population of 
the multinational Austrian empire. More significant is 
his friendship with Tomas Garrigue Masaryk ( 1850--
1937), who became a prominent Czech philosopher 
and politician. He recommended that Husserl study 
with his own former teacher FRANZ BRENTANO, initially 
oriented him in phi1osophy in Leipzig ( 1876-77), and 
probably influenced Husserl 's religious development 
in Vienna (1881-82), which culminated in Husserl's 
conversion to Protestantism in 1886. 
Meanwhile, an important group ofBrentano 's disci-
p1es was gaining influence at the German university in 
Prague, gradually replacing the influence of the hith-
erto dominant Herbartism. The leading figures were 
Cari Stumpf (active in Prague 1879-84), Anton Marty 
(active 1880--1913 ), the more independent Christian 
von Ehrenfels (active 1896-1929), and the ma in edi-
tor of Brentano's writings, Oskar Kraus (active 1902-
38). On the other hand, Brentanism was not particu-
larly strong at the Czech university in Prague (estab-
lished 1882), since Masaryk (professor there 1882-
1 915) ceased to work in theoretical philosophy in the 
mid-1880s and concentrated on problems of society,

culture, and politics. Also, Masaryk's view ofBrentano 
was formed in 1874-76, and located him perhaps closer 
to John Stuart Miii than to phenomenology. 
Finally, in the 1920s Prague became an impor-
tant center of theoretical linguistics, with the cele-
brated Prague Linguistic Circle established in 1926. 
The old generation of Czech participants ( e.g., Vilem 
Mathesius [ 1882-1945], president of the Ci rele) was 
influenced by Brentano, mediated by Masaryk and 
Marty, in rejecting the previously standard primacy of a 
historical approach and, independently ofFerdinand de 
Saussure, stressing STRUCTURALISM, i.e., the necessity 
of inquiry into the structural relations within a cur-
rent state oflanguage. Roman Jakobson (1896--1982), 
another prominent member of the Circle, professed 
that he was influenced by studying Husserl earlier in 
Moscow, but the extent and exact nature ofthis influ-
ence remains a matter of dispute. 
However, the reception of phenomenology (in the 
strict sense) before the 1930s was rather superficial 
both in the German- and Czech-speaking philosophi-
cal communities. Misrepresenting comments adopted 
from contemporary German textbooks and surveys 
were basically repeated. The turn ing point was Febru-
ary 1929, when JAN PATOCKA, a Czech student spending 
the 1928-29 year in Paris, was deeply impressed by 
Husserl's Paris lectures and decided to study pheno-
menology seriously. He wrote a doctoral dissertation, 
Pojem evidence a jeho vyznam pro noetiku (The con-
cept of evidence and its significance for epistemology, 
1931 ), and in 1932-33 he went to Germany as a Hum-
boldt scholar, worked intensively with Husserl and his 
assistant EUGEN FINK, and attended MARTIN HEIDEGGER's 
lectures. 
Back in Prague, Patocka worked closely with 
Husserl's previous assistant LUDWIG LANDGREBE, who 
had moved to Prague and prepared his habilitation 
at the German university (achieved in 1935 with the 
book Nennfunktion und Wortbedeutung, an interpreta-
tion of Marty's philosophy of language). This nucleus 
of a phenomenological community was joined by Emil 
Utitz ( 1883-1956 ), who became professor at the Ger-
man university in 1934. He had studied in Prague un-
der Marty and was somewhat influenced by pheno-
menology; his approach, far less sectarian than that of 
Husserl 's direct disciples, greatly facilitated commu-
nication with other philosophers. As a result, the Cer-
ele philosophique de Prague pour les recherches sur 
1 'entendement humain was established late in 1934. 
The Circle was not professedly phenomenological, 
but was soon perceived as such. Among its mem-
bers- besides Utitz, Landgrebe, and Patocka- were 
Brentano's follower Oskar Kraus ( 1872-1942), Franz 
Kafka's friend Max Brod ( 1884-1968), an eclectic but 
temporarily prominent professor, Jan Blahoslav Kozak 
(1888-1974), and Jan Mukafovsky (1891-1975), an 
important structuralist literary theoretician and another 
link to the Linguistic Circle. A collection of pa pers read 
at the Circle's meetings in spring 1935 appeared in the 
new, Belgrade-basedjournal Philosophia (founded and 
edited by the former editor of Kant-Studien, Arthur 
Liebert). More importantly, the Circle, aware of the 
hostility towards Husserl in Nazi Germany, decided on 
three measures: to give him opportunity to lecture in 
public again, to publish his new writings, and to secure 
his manuscripts for posterity. 
Meanwhile, the organizers of the 8th International 
Philosophical Congress in Prague, September 1934, in-
vited Husserl to make a major address. It is likely that 
the proposed topic, "the significance ofphilosophy for 
life," was a motive for Husserl to give the problematic 
of Die Krisis der europiiischen Wissenschaften und die 
transzendentale Phiinomenologie ( 1936) the highest 
priority after the Cartesianische Meditationen [ 1931] 
project was abandoned. Husserl wrote the paper, was 
not allowed to come, and arranged for his paper to be 
read by Patocka, but finally decided to withdraw it and 
to send merely a briefformal statement. After the fail-
ure of the first attempt, the Circle invited Husserl to 
come to lecture in Prague independently. Husserl ac-
cepted, then postponed the date (incidentally, the post-
ponement was not communicated to Vienna, which 
meanwhile hadjoined Prague's invitation, and Husserl 
was forced to improvise the "Vienna Lecture" in May 
1935); he finally came to Prague in November 1935 
and made what turned out to be his last public ap-
pearance. Besides the formal, two-lecture series on the 
Krisis, he gave informal talks in the Philosophical Cir-
ele, the Linguistic Circle, and the Brentano Society. 
The revised and enlarged Prague lectures appeared in 
1936, also in Philosophia, and form Parts 1 and II of 
the Krisis. 
In winter 1934-35, the project ofsecuring Husserl 's 
manuscripts was started quietly (since the manuscripts 

CZECHOSLOVA KIA 
125 
had tobe smuggled from the Nazi Germany) and with 
financial support from the Czechoslovak nation, the 
president of which was Husserl 's old friend Masaryk. 
Fink in Freiburg and Landgrebe in Prague worked on 
the cataloguing, and while Fink was busy working with 
Husserl on the continuation of the Krisis, Landgrebe 
worked according to Husserl 's directions on another set 
ofmanuscripts and prepared them for publication. The 
result ofhis work was Erfahrung und Urteil, published 
in Prague in 1939 as a second volume of the series 
published by the Circle (the first being two Memo-
rial Addresses on the occasion of Husserl 's death, Ed-
mund Husserl zum Gedachtnis [1938], by Landgrebe 
and Patocka). By that time, however, it became clear 
that Prague was no more secure a place for the Husserl 
archive than Germany itself, and thanks to HERMAN LEO 
VAN BREDA's energetic intervention, it was possible to 
modify the plan and to establish the archive in Louvain. 
In sum, during 1934-39 Prague was the world 
capital of Husserlian phenomcnology. No wonder, 
then, that it was Patocka who published the standard 
Husserl bibliography in 1939. But the war ruined fur-
ther prospects. Oskar Kraus fled to England before the 
German invasion; Landgrebe, expelled from the uni-
versity by the Nazis, soon followed the manuscripts 
to Louvain; Utitz survived a concentration camp only 
to be expelled (with ali remaining Germans) from the 
renewed Czechoslovakia after the war. The Czech uni-
versities were closed in 1939 and the Circle was dis-
solved. 
Nevertheless, the brief activity of the Circle 
made phenomenology influential also among non-
phenomenologists, and some ofthe leading figures of 
Czech philosophy of the time confronted their views 
with Husserl and Heidegger studies at first hand. These 
included the eclectic neo-Kantian Ladislav Rieger 
(1890-1958), writing on the method and purpose of 
philosophy, and the Marxist influenced by WILHELM 
DILTHEY, Jifina Popelova (1904-1985), writing on the 
problem of time and of historiography. Phenomen-
ology was also influential among literature and art the-
orists- e.g., Jifi Veltrusky used Husserl's theory of 
TIME-consciousness for his theory of context in LJTER-
ATURE. 
After the war, the new interest in EXISTENTIALISM 
in FRANCE stimulated severa! articles and three small 
books. The leading Czech literary critic Vaclav Cerny 
( 1905-1987) wrote two Sesity o existencialismu (Note-
books on existentialism, 1948), explaining what exis-
tentialism is in both its philosophical and literary con-
texts in the first notebook and applying the concept to 
the interpretation of the new Czech poetry in the sec-
ond. In a polemic pamphlet against JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, 
Existencialismus neni humanismus (Existentialism is 
not humanism, 1948), V.T. Miskovskâ asks for more 
philosophical rigor and deplores Sartre's abstract sub-
jectivism in the light of Christian humanist values. 
The Czech universities reopened in summer 1945 
(while the German ones were closed, naturally), and 
Patocka's lectures concentrated on Greek philosophy, 
providing a brilliant phenomenological reinterpreta-
tion ofSocrates and the pre-Socratics. Some ofhis sem-
inars dealt with Husserl 's Logische Untersuchungen 
( 1900-1901 ). However, the Communists took power in 
February 1948 and made it impossible to teach or pub-
lish phenomenology for sixteen years, until the "thaw" 
ofthe mid-1960s. 
The leaders ofthe new generation ofthe 1960s were, 
of course, oriented toward MARXISM (a conditia sine qua 
non at that time) and their relation to phenomenology 
had to be rather cautious. The first step was to smug-
gle some phenomenology ( often ofFrench provenance 
-
Sartre visited Czechoslovakia during his Stalinist 
period in 1954, and then again in 1964) into their pro-
fessedly Marxist essays. By 1965 it became possible to 
publish scholarly articles on more technical aspects of 
Husserl (but not Heidegger) and to write phenomen-
ological studies without referring to phenomenology, 
and in 1967--fJ9 ali barriers were removed. Then, from 
1970, when the new regime established by the Soviet 
military occupation of 1968 became strong enough, a 
new period of banishment followed un tii 1989. 
The main figure ofthe 1960s generation was KAREL 
KOSiK, and his book Dialektika konkretniho: Studie o 
problematice cloveka a sveta (Dialectic ofthe concrete: 
A study in the problematics of man and world, 1963 ), 
was recognized internationally as an example of non-
dogmatic and relatively erudite Marxism. The book 
was an attempt to make "praxis" the place where the 
solutions to the main problems ofphilosophy are tobe 
found. About phenomenology, Kosik says that it was 
TRAN ouc THAO who discovered the authentic meaning 
of Husserl 's phenomenological method and the relation 
ofits "rational core" to the current philosophical situa-

126 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
tion of alienation, etc. In the 1970s Kosik was working 
on another philosophical book, but his large manuscript 
was seized by the poli ce and never retumed. Except for 
that manuscript, most of Kosik 's post -1963 production 
consisted of essays commenting on cultural and polit-
ica! issues and made him an important public figure in 
the 1960s. 
Kosik was not alone: the concept of praxis in the 
context of HEGEL and Marx was in the focus of the lo-
cal discussions in 1959--65 and some ofthe participants 
were susceptible to phenomenological inftuence more 
clearly than Kosik, notably IVAN oussd, proceeding 
from Marxism to phenomenology inftuenced by Hei-
degger, Patocka, and WALTER BIEMEL. Unlike Kosik, he 
continues to write phenomenological essays from time 
to time, with a particular interest in problems of time 
and literature. Somewhat similar was the progress of 
KAREL MICHNĂK, culminating in his emphatically Hei-
deggerian and Patockian book Ke kritice antropolo-
gismu ve filosofii a teologii (Towards a criticism of 
anthropologism in philosophy and theology, 1969). A 
blend of phenomenology with humanist Marxism was 
popular in Czechoslovak philosophy during 1965-70 
(soon differentiated intemally because of a Heidegger-
inspired criticism of the humanist element, as, e.g., 
in Michfuik's book mentioned above), with about ten 
books published and many teaching positions held. Its 
proponents included JIRi PESEK, working on Heidegger 
with an emphasis on time; JAROSLAVA PESKOV;.. (philoso-
phy of EDUCATION); JOSEF CIBULKA (Husserl); JIRI CERNY 
(Fink); MILAN PRLJCHA (MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY); MILAN 
SOBOTKA, JAROMIR LOUZIL, and LADISLAV MAJOR (post-
Kantian German philosophy). 
A more technical and scholarly approach with no 
reference to Marxism characterized severa! articles 
published in 1965--69 by MARIE BAYEROVĂ, main]y on 
Husserl's method. Her translation of Husserl's Carte-
sianische Meditationen remains the main textbook on 
phenomenology in Czech. Another Marxism-free au-
thor was JAROSLAV KOHOUT, Patocka's student in the 
1940s and a politica! prisoner in the 1950s. ANTONiN 
MOKREJS's Fenomenologie a problem intersubjektivity 
(Phenomenology and the problem of intersubjectivity, 
1969) is a relatively sound and well-informed mono-
graph (it quotes over thirty Western phenomenologists, 
most frequently ALWIN DIEMER, Ludwig Landgrebe, and 
GERD BRAND) focusing on the problem of INTERSUB-
JECTIVITY, confronting Husserl's own methodological 
requirements, the early Heidegger, and Sartre. An in-
formal group gathered around JIRi NEMEC, a psycholo-
gist ofwide cultural and religious interests and guided 
by phenomenology, who was active in informal study 
groups and in translating, e.g., Heidegger's Vom Wesen 
der Wahrheit (On the essence oftruth, 1 943). Art histo-
rian v ĂCLAV RICHTER, after being inftuenced by Husserl 
in the 1940s, developed a Heidegger-inftuenced theory 
of ARCHITECTURE and urban space in the 1960s. 
Ali ofthis activity was, however, overshadowed by 
the towering figure of Patocka. Allowed to publish on 
phenomenology again in 1965, he published a series 
of rather dry, technical, and difficult articles collec-
tively entitled Uvod do studia Husserlovyfenomenolo-
gie (An introduction to the study of Husserl 's pheno-
menology, 1965--66 and published as a book in 1 966), 
considered by ERAZIM KOHĂK Patocka's finest text on 
phenomenology. They combine an erudite, focused, 
and penetrating historical exposition with a care fu! and 
sharp criticism. At the same time, Patocka's article "K 
prehistorii vedy o pohybu: svet, zeme, nebe a pohyb 
lidskeho zi vota" (Toward a prehistory of the science 
of movement: World, earth, sky, and the movement 
of human life, 1 965) betrayed his own philosophical 
ambitions and introduced the earliest version of his 
theory of three basic movements of human existence. 
The combination of critica! scholarly articles mainly 
on Husserl (some in French or German), which gradu-
ally culminated in Patocka 's conception of an asubjec-
tive phenomenology, with less scholarly, more Heideg-
gerian philosophical texts (besides many texts on the 
history of ideas, on art, and on history) remained the 
pattern ofPatocka's writing until his death in 1977-
except that he was forbidden to publish in his country 
after 1970. But before that, in 1968, he was allowed 
to return to the university and his 1968-72 teaching 
( extra-curricular after 1 970) was formati ve for a new 
generation of phenomenologists. 
To complete the picture, a few more transla-
tions should be mentioned: Husserl 's Vorlesungen zur 
Phănomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins [ 1 905], 
and some marginal and often not directly phenomen-
ological seJections from MAX SCHELER, KARL JASPERS, 
GABRIEL MARCEL, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Gadamer, 
Landgrebe, and Fink were translated into Czech and 
selections from Husserl, Heidegger, Jaspers, and Sartre 

CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
127 
were translated into the Slovak language. 
The Czechoslovak cultural and academic life was 
badly hurt by the measures adopted by the new an-
tidemocratic leaders. Books were removed from li-
braries according to centrally issucd lists, professors 
were expelled, and those remaining were under super-
vision and censorship (rather strict in the 1970s, grad-
ually softening in the 1980s). A rich intellectual scene 
gradually emerged, however, in the dissent. Typewrit-
ten "samizdat" texts were circulated, teaching went on, 
there were even some international contacts. Finally, 
in 1989, many ofthe underground intel\ectuals became 
prominent in dismantling the old regime and building 
the new one. 
On the official scene, phenomenology was nearly 
dead. What remained was a chapter in the "criticism 
of bourgeois philosophy" in the university courses, 
or anonymous phenomenology-inspired expositions 
within the Marxism courses (by .11R.i PESEK and others). 
Within the "criticism" geme, one rather weak book on 
Husserl by Jozef Piacek was published in Slovak, and 
there were some translations from Polish and Russian 
on existentialism. 
The underground phenomenology was dominated 
by Patocka again until his death in 1977. He taught 
seminars on specific texts and offered lecture series 
on broader topics, many of which were recorded and 
published after his death, e.g., Platân a Evropa (Plato 
and Europe, 1983), and wrote a few significant texts 
in both German and Czech, including Kacifske eseje 
ofilosofii dejin (Heretical essays on the philosophy of 
history, 1975), considered the final statement of his 
philosophical endeavor. 
11R.i NEMEC was the main center of gravity of the 
new generation of Patocka 's students. He continued 
organizing translation and study groups, and after his 
emigration in 1979, he was a pioneer in propagating 
Patocka's work abroad. Due to illness he has been less 
productive recently. Nevertheless, the combination of 
a friendly, supportive, and collaborative atmosphere in 
Nemec's circle with the demanding, brilliant, but per-
haps ali too dominant presence of Patocka provided a 
fertile environment, which gave rise to work ofsome-
what higher standard than that ofthe 1960s ( except for 
Patocka's). 
PETR REZEK was considered the most promising of 
the group. Besides his work on PSYCHOLOGY and art 
and his continuous teaching activity (on Greek, mod-
em, and even ANALYTJC PHJLOSOPHY), he wrote severa! 
analytical and critica! papers on Patocka and used 
some phenomenological ideas in his psychological 
work. JVAN CHVATiK 's main field is translation and text 
scholarship, and his fine Heidegger translations include 
Sein und Zeit ( 1927) (with Kouba and Petficek), Was 
ist Metaphysik (1929), selections from Vortrăge und 
Aufsătze (1954), etc. He also organized the preserva-
tion and edition of Patocka's work (twenty-seven vol-
umes of "underground" text of 1979-89) and is cur-
rently the head ofthe Jan Patocka Archives in Prague. 
Less active as teacher and organizer and more con-
centrated on study is PAVEL KOUBA, perhaps the best 
Czech phenomenology scholar today, recently work-
ing mainly on Nietzsche. An active teacher and a very 
productive essayist and translator ( e.g., Husserl, Hei-
degger, JACQUES DERRIDA), MJROSLAV PETRiCEK JR. is in-
terested in the French scene and in literature and art 
theory. 
The doyen of another group of Patocka 's students, 
also connected with Nemec (and of a Catholic back-
ground), was RADJM PALous, Patocka's student in the 
1940s, who specialized in philosophy of education. 
ZDENEK NEUBAUER turned to philosophy as a success-
ful biologist, and works mainly on phenomenology 
of nature, of NATURAL SCIENCE, and of myth. MAR-
TIN PALOUS, influenced by HANNAH ARENDT and Eric 
Voegelin (190 1-1985), deals mainly with POLJTJCS. 
ZDENEK KRATOCHViL, an accomplished theologian who 
studied under KAROL WOJTYLA in Cracow, studies early 
thought with a focus on Heraclitus (he has recently 
published a new trans1ation with a commentary), Hel-
1enistic philosophy, and Christian gnosis. Another the-
o1ogian, TOMĂS HALiK, combines Patocka with Jungian 
psychology. DANIEL KROUPA led severa! very success-
ful introductory seminars on Husserl, Heidegger, and 
Patocka before he turned toward POLITIC AL PHILOSOPHY 
and subsequently toward politics itself. 
JAN SOKOL wrote and taught on phenomenology of 
RELIGION and HJSTORY; trans]ated, e.g., EMMANUEL LEV-
INAS; and currently writes on time and rhythm. Other 
important Patocka students of 1968-77 include v ĂCLAV 
BELOHRADSKY, current1y engaged in antifoundational-
ism, rhetoric, and liberal politics; ZDENEK PINC, the 
founder and the head of the new (1992) liberal arts 
college of Charles University; .11R.i MICHĂLEK, persis-

tently working on early and especially late Heidegger; 
JJRi roLÎVKA, combining phenomenology with an in-
teres! in Scholastic and analytic philosophy; MILOSLAV 
BEDNĂR (politica! philosophy), etc. 
Among Czechoslovak phenomenologists working 
abroad, the most notable are ERAZIM KOHĂK, profes-
sor at Boston University, who has translated Ricceur 
and Patocka, commented on Husserl and Patocka, and 
done original work on values and ECOLOGY, and lUA 
SRUBAR, professor of soCIOLOGY at Konstanz, who has 
commented on ALFRED SCHUTZ and Patocka. JOZEF SIV ĂK 
returned to Slovakia after graduale research in FRANCE 
(with Ricceur among others), and writes mainly on 
Husserl. American-horn ERIKA ABRAMS is an excellent 
translator ofPatocka into French (roughly ten volumes 
published) and a true Patocka expert. KLAUS NELLEN 
is the head of the Viennese branch of the Patocka 
Archives and a ca-editor of the five-volume selection 
from Patocka in German. 
Among the younger Czech phenomenologists, JOSEF 
MOURAL and FILIP KARFiK were trained mainly in under-
ground circ]es, whi]e JĂN PAVLJK, LA OI SLAV BENYOVSZKY, 
and IV AN BLECHA studied with Professor Pesek. 
Within the plurality of schools in the contemporary 
Czech Republic, including a particularly quick growth 
ofinterest in the hitherto almost unknown analytic phi-
losophy, the influence ofphenomenology stil! remains 
strongest. There are also a number of people more or 
less influenced by phenomenology working in psychol-
ogy, education theory, anthropology, and in literature, 
theater, and art theory and history. 
It may be of some interest that sin ce philosophy was 
an important part ofthe Czech cultural underground, a 
number ofphilosophers played a ro le in dismantling the 
Communist regime in 1989 and in laying foundations 
for democratic politics since then. From the early days 
of the Civic Forum (the movement that took power 
from the Communists), severa! of the people men-
tioned worked as volunteers. In 1990, Radim Palous 
became the new rector ofthe Charles University, Mar-
tin Palous because the deputy minister of foreign af-
fairs, Daniel Kroupa was a co-founder and currently 
the number three figure of the second strongest party 
in the country (after the split of the Civic Forum), Jan 
Sokol was the deputy chairman of one of the federal 
parliament chambers, etc. 
Petr Pithart, Czech prime minister 1 990-92, was 
formerly involved in Patocka-influenced work in po-
litica! theory and history and ca-editor of Schrţften zur 
tschechischen Kultur und Geschichte volume (Writ-
ings on Czech culture and history, a volume in the 
German Patocka edition). vĂCLAV HAVEL, the president 
ofCzechoslovakia 1989-92 and ofthe Czech Republic 
beginning in 1993, was an admirer ofPatocka from the 
late 1950s and a friend from the 1960s on, and wrote a 
few essays on him. After Patocka's death, he remained 
philosophically influenced by phenomenologists, par-
ticularly by Belohradsky, Radim and Martin Palous, 
and Neubauer.

DANCE 
FDMUND HUSSERL, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, 
and \1Al:RICE M!ORLEAU-PO'JTY mention dance on]y 
in passing. For example, in ldeen zu einer reinen 
Phdnomeno/ogie und phdnomeno/ogischen Phi/oso-
phie II [ 1912-15], Husserl refers to the dancing body 
in a discussion of the way the apprehension of a hu-
man being is not the apprehension of a mind fastened 
to a body, but of a whole person, animated through and 
through so that every movement is "fui! of soul." In his 
discussion of desi re in L 'etre et le neant ( 1943), Sartre 
alludes to the dancing body as a soov that cannot be 
appropriated as sheer contingency, facticity, or flesh, 
for even if nude, the dancer is stil! a situated, acting, 
moving body. And in Phenomenologie de la perception 
( 1945), Merleau-Ponty uses a dance as an example of 
an acquired motor habit, pointing out that learning a 
dance is not a matter of analyzing it into its compo-
nent parts, but of "catching on to" the movement in a 
thoroughly bodily way. 
Though MARTIN HEIDEGGER turns more exp\icitly to 
dance in severa! texts- for example, in his 1950 !ee-
ture "Das Ding" and in his 1959 lecture "Holderlins 
Erde und Himmel"- the dance he is concerned with 
is the "round dance" ofthe "fourfold" (earth, sky, mor-
tais, divinities) in their mutually mirroring play; as a 
reciproca! joining, gathering, or belonging-together in 
which the world "worlds." This ontologically accented 
dance is only loosely connected with the ritual dance 
forms in ancient Greece to which Heidegger alludes. 
ROMAN INGARDEN's Untersuchungen zur Ontologie der 
Kunst (lnvestigations in the ontology of art, initially 
drafted in 1928 but not published until 1962) engages 
actual works of art more directly, but he focuses on 
MUSIC, painting, ARCHITECTURE, and FILM. Thus here too 
there is only passing reference to dance, amounting 
to a recommendation that "artistic dance" be clearly 
distinguished from such "extra-artistic phenomena" as 
ritual dances. However, Sibyl S. Cohen 's "lngarden 's 
Aesthetics and Dance" ( 1984) draws upon his Das /it-
erarische Kunstwerk (The literary work of art, 1931 ), 
applying his notion ofthe stratified, schematic nature of 
the literary work of art to the case of dan ce- which, 
for example, has a lived-body stratum rather than a 
phonetic stratum for its foundational element. 
Dancc 
is 
mentioned 
more 
frequently 
in MIKEL DUFRENNE's Phenomenologie de 1 'experience 
esthetique (1953 ), though it is given no special treat-
ment of its own. Dufrenne- who, like Ingarden, is 
concerned only with dance as an art form meant to be 
viewed by spectators rather than with dance forms in 
which pcople participate, and who draws nearly ali of 
his examples from ballet- stresses that although there 
is no dance without the dancer, the dancer must submit 
to the dance in such a way that the dance "possesses" 
the dan cer and movement that has in fact been very pre-
cisely determined in advance is nevertheless brought 
to life with spontaneity as well as grace at the moment 
ofperformance. But although the body is the "organ of 
performance" and provides the "sensuous material" for 
the dance, the particular dancing body is transcended 
in favor of the work itself. And the aesthetic object 
that the dancer thus incarnates is comprised of "pure 
movements" with their own sensuous, bodily logic; 
even moments of repose are never mere static poses, 
but the "apotheosis" of movement just completed and 
the "promise" of movement about to unfold. 
Dufrcnne 's work is, of course, meant as a contribu-
tion to phenomenological AESTHETICS in general, not as 
a phenomenological description of any particular art 
form. He nevertheless notes in passing that when the 
dancer "dedicates" his or her body to the dance, his 
or her movements "proceed from the trunk"- a de-
scriptive detail already emphasized by ERWIN w. STRAUS 
in "Die Formen des Răumlichen" ( 1930). But whereas 
Dufrenne remarks on the highlighted ro le of the trunk 
or torso from the spectator's point ofview, Straus sug-
gests that the dancer's own lived experience of dancing 
involves a sense of 'T' or "self' as being centered in 
the trunk (rather than, say, somewhere in the head, 
behind the eyes). For Straus, this shift to vital move-
ment emanating from the body's center is linked with 
the dancer's shift from the "optica!" space oftheoret-
ical knowledge, practica! aetion, and purposive, goal-
directed movement to an "acoustic" space sustaining a 
pre-reflcctive dissolution ofthe 1-world, subject-object 
dichotomy- a realm of "symbolic spatial qualities"

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
rather than measurable distances. Here, however, dan ce 
is only important to Straus's phenomenological PSY-
CHOLOGY insofar as the contrast between everyday bod-
ily movement and pure dance movement sheds light 
on the differences between the distinctive spatialities 
proper to the vi sua! and to the aud ia! modes of experi-
encing. 
Yet despite the relatively sparse treatment of dance 
in the classic texts and authors mentioned, there is a 
small but growing body of literature in which phe-
nomenologists have focused on dance in its own right 
(rather than as exemplifying some other theme or phe-
nomenon). Moreover, persons initially trained in dance 
ha ve turned to phenomenology in order to elucidate the 
essential structures and aesthetic aims of Western the-
atrical dancing. In so doing, they are carrying forward 
two trends already emerging from the dance world it-
self: a concern for a compelling, non-reductive way of 
giving voi ce to the subjective experiencing of dane ing, 
and a concern for the precise, evocative verbal descrip-
tion of seemingly ephemeral and ineffable dan ce works 
as they are experienced from the audience's point of 
view. Thus a phenomenological turn to lived experi-
ence and to the "how" of the appearing phenomena 
already resonates with autobiographical and historical 
writing by dance "insiders" (dancers and choreogra-
phers) on the one hand and 20th century dance criticism 
on the other. 
The Phenomenology of Dan ce ( 1966), by MAXINE 
SHEETS (!ater Sheets-Johnstone), was the first book-
length study to apply phenomenological tenns and con-
cepts to the experience of choreographing, performing, 
and perceiving theater dance works. Drawing upon EX-
ISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY -
especially its portrayaJ 
of ecstatic time, along with its emphasis on the pre-
reflective ways in which "consciousness 'exists' its 
body" and thereby constitutes lived space -
as well 
as upon the notion of dance as "virtual force" worked 
out by Susanne K. Langer (1895-1985) in Feeling and 
Form ( 1953), Sheets characterizes dan ce movement as 
pure dynamic "form-in-the-making," as a "sheer dy-
namic flow of force" such that the dancer's body is a 
center of force in a textured, "diasporatic" space. Like 
Dufrenne, she emphasizes the oneness of dancer and 
dance and appeals to a certain "logic" governing the 
development of a choreographed movement sequence: 
to compose a dan ce is to discover the bodily logic of its 
distinctive "dynamic line." But as she also points out, 
the emerging organic continuity of this dynamic line 
can be clarified for choreographer and dancer alike by 
vocalizing it, since the dynamic line itselfis essentially 
a "dynamic interplay" of qualities or energies that can 
be "mirrored" audially (whether "actually vocalized" 
or "inwardly heard") as well as executed bodily and 
perceived visually. This concern for artistic creativity 
is also pursued in her "Thinking in Movement" ( 1981 ), 
an essay on dance improvisation that emphasizes the 
pre-rational "kinetic intelligence" of a situated, "mind-
ful" body. 
DAVID MICHAEL LEVIN focuses on dance in a series of 
publications in the 1970s and 1980s. In "Balanchine's 
Formalism" {1973) he suggests that although ballet 
has historically been a representational form with plot, 
setting, characters, etc., some of Balanchine's works 
demonstrate that the classical ballet idiom itself re-
veals essential bodily possibilities of lightness, poise, 
and grace as the dancer visibly transcends the con-
straints of the body's own weight and makes weight-
lessness appear in its place. In "The Embodiment of 
Performance" ( 1975-76) he examines the avant-garde 
performance genre as a medium in which the sensu-
ous body is shown to be the primitive source of sig-
nificance as well as the bearer of already sedimented 
historical-cultural meaning. In "Philosophers and the 
Dance" (1977-78) he links the lack of serious consid-
eration of dance in much of the Western philosophi-
cal tradition to a general hostility toward the bodily, 
and the feminine principle, on the part of a patriarchal 
civilization whose emphasis on mastery and control 
has suppressed -
but not destroyed -
a primordial 
connectivity embodied in sacred dance. And in "On 
Heidegger: The Gathering Dan ce of Mortals" ( 1980) 
he pursues and deepens Heidegger's ontologica! ap-
propriation of dan ce. 
Levin continues his HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMEN-
OLOGY of dance in The Body :S Recollection of Being: 
Phenomenological Psychology and the Deconstruction 
o( Nihilism (1985), whose aim is to retrieve a "body of 
understanding" kept in concealment by the dominant 
tradition. He accordingly turns not only to Heidegger, 
Nietzsche, and Merleau-Ponty, but also to aboriginal 
teachings and traditions concerning the body. The re-
sulting FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY not onJy focuses on 
gesture and motility, but culminates in a presentation of 

DAN CE 
dance as a "bearing ofthought in which we are granted 
an experience of Being"; he suggests that "when dan ce 
is thoughtful, it is a fundamental form of poetizing 
(Dichtung)" and that as ontologica! movement, dance 
arises from and discloses our deep and originary attune-
ment to the Being, ground, or origin that it celebrates 
in its ecstatic and earth-affirming leaps and circles. 
SONORA HORTON FRALEIGH's Dance and the Lived 
Body: A Descriptive Aesthetics ( 1987) is similarly con-
cerned with the mythopoetic and ontologica! signif-
icance of dance, which she explores by way of the 
notion of polar tension (be it the archetypal tension of 
the masculine and the feminine, the strife ofworld and 
earth in Heidegger's portrayal ofthe bringing-forth of 
truth in the work of art, or the tension between the 
individuality of the dancer and the "universalizing" 
impulse ofthe dance). Yet her project as a whole is to 
make the inherent qualities and aesthetic properties of 
dan ce intelligible in a way that does justice to insiders' 
experiences of dance as the existential art par excel-
lence. She emphasizes that although dance celebrates 
and affirms the vital, pre-verbal movement sensibility 
ofthe lived body-subject, dance movement is not ordi-
nary, habitual, or automatic, but is consciously struc-
tured for an aesthetic purpose; grace in dance consists 
in a "fit" between such movement and the energy or 
effort needed to incarnate it. Her descriptions-which 
focus for the most part on modern dance rather than 
balle!- include analyses of specific dances and chore-
ographic styles as well as references to more general 
experiential structures such as moving with another 
( or others) in unison and moving against another ( or 
others) in counterbalancing, mutually facilitating, con-
trasting, and oppositional ways. 
Fraleigh 's interviews with modern dancers indicate 
that connections between modern dance and EXISTEN-
TIALISM are not limited to endeavors such asher own 
attempt to work out a phenomenological aesthetics 
of dance: rather, dancers themselves also report be-
ing directly inftuenced by the writings of Nietzsche, 
Kierkegaard, Camus, and Merleau-Ponty. Heidegger's 
"thinking of Being" is similarly the inspiration for 
Gelassenheit Arts Presenters, a nonprofit organization 
recently founded in San Francisco under the leadership 
of dancer and choreographer Philip Jones. This orga-
nization is devoted to sponsoring dance/theater/music 
events where what is at work in the work of art can 
131 
come to unconcealment- i.e., to fostering occasions 
for releasement ( Gelassenheit), aletheia. and letting-
be. In other words, the organization deliberately sets 
out to bring together performing artists who work on-
tologically, conveying the being of human being by 
making present the truth of Being in a movement of 
"showing" that gathers us into a revelatory event of 
"seeing." 
In Australia, PHILIPA ROTHFIELD also works toward 
building bridges between phenomenological philoso-
phy and contemporary dance, not only by using pheno-
menology to help articulate movement and dan ce prac-
tice, but also by allowing movement and dance experi-
ence to inform phenomenological writing. Her essays 
on dance deal with such issues as the transgression of 
individual bodily boundaries in the dance form known 
as Contact Improvisation, which she discusses in terms 
of Merleau-Ponty's notions of "fiesh" and "reversibil-
ity," and the "corporeal connectivity" arising between 
dancer and audience such that the sensuous pleasure of 
moving can spread by a kind of contagion from the per-
former's body to the bodies of audience members. Yet 
in addition to the general kinaesthetic resonance ofthe 
dancer's movement in the spectator's body- a theme 
mentioned by many writers on dance- Rothfield ac-
knowledges the possibility of a specifically erotic di-
mension to the intercorporeal performance situation. 
She also recognizes the social and cultural inscription 
ofbodies, linking this with issues in FEMINISM. But she 
contends that dance practice can itself shift and rene-
gotiate historically produced codes and modes of rep-
resentation. Her work thus supplements POSTMODERN 
accounts such as Susan Leigh Foster's Reading Dane-
ing: Bodies and Subjects in Contemporwy American 
Dance ( 1986) and "Dancing Bodies" ( 1992), which 
follow MICHEL FOUCAULT in describing the disciplinary 
procedures creating the trained bodies (and correla-
tive "selves") appropriate to various dance styles and 
techniques. 
However, the very project of elucidating how dane-
ing bodies are shaped in institutional settings also 
points to the larger field of movement education and to 
the implicitly phenomenological elements in the work 
ofRudolfLaban (1879-1958), including a turn to the 
"how" of lived movement and a concern for invariant 
features of movement experience. Dialogue between 
phenomenology and Laban movement education was 

132 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
already underway in the 1970s, as is evident in a 1974 
symposium on "The Significance ofMovement" bring-
ing together members ofboth traditions. More recently, 
V era Mal etic 's Body- Space- Expression: The De-
velopment of Ruda!( Laban s Movement and Dance 
Concepts (1987) includes some explicit comparisons 
of Laban 's work on body, perception, motility, spa-
tiality, temporality, and expression with the treatment 
of these themes in Merleau-Ponty, Straus, and FRED-
ERIK J. J. BUYTENDIJK. Comparisons between Laban and 
Merleau-Ponty have also been discussed in a paper 
co-authored by MAUREEN CONNOLLY and Anna Lathrop. 
It is interesting to note that Heidegger's extended 
notion ofthe "round dance" is anticipated to some ex-
tent in Laban 's Die Welt des Tanzers (The world ofthe 
dancer, 1920), where the term "Gedankenreigen" or 
"round dances of thought" refers to moving, multidi-
mensional "interrelationships of concepts and thought" 
irreducible to merely logica! connections, while the 
round dance itself is taken as the form of ultimate 
communion and unity. Moreover, Laban 's discussions 
of dan ce in terms of inseparably intertwined elements 
of "time-space-force" in the same work (and other 
texts) provide a precedent for Sheets's presentation 
of dance as "forcetimespace" in her 1966 book. That 
Laban takes the mover's body (rather than some fixed 
point of the surrounding space) as the point of refer-
ence for the directional orientations used in his system 
of movement notation is reminiscent of Husserl 's de-
scriptions of the body as the nullpoint of orientation. 
And Husserl 's remarks on the sphere of objects within 
reach -
as well as ALFRED SCHUTZ's more sustained 
treatment ofthe notion ofthe world within my actual, 
potential, and restorable reach -
finds a parallel in 
Laban 's development of the notion of the reach space 
or "kinesphere." Such similarities need not imply ac-
tual influences between the individuals concerned. But 
they do indicate that the phenomenological turn to lived 
body, lived space, lived movement, and lived relations 
with others and objects is situated within a broader 
historical-cultural context characterized by an increas-
ing theoretical and practica! concern with these themes 
in other disciplines as well, including not only dance, 
but a]so PHYSICAL EDUCATION and SOMATICS. 
Work yet to be done in the encounter between 
phenomenology and dance might include studies of 
the transforming and community-building aspects of 
dance, including social dance, ethnic dance, ritual or 
sacred dance, and so on. Moreover, in addition to the-
matizing specific dance styles or traditions in the con-
text ofphenomenologically oriented ETHNIC STUDIES or 
ETHNOLOGY, there is room for further work on dance 
as a fundamental way of being human that is to be 
honored and developed in EDUCATION at alllevels. Here 
"dan ce" is not the ti tie of a specialized activity reserved 
for professionals and subject to the reigning aesthetic 
criteria of a given cui ture, but names a dimension of 
human motility per se, a primordial human possibil-
ity. Finally, there is also room for further discussion of 
dance as "world-generating"- a theme emerging in 
ALGIS MICKUNAS 's "The Primacy of Movement" ( 197 4) 
and in the chapter on dance in ARNOLD BERLEANT's Art 
and Engagement ( 1991 ), where the bodily engagement 
binding performers and spectators not only epitomizes 
sociality, but also has cosmologica! implications. 
Throughout, however, we would do well to ac-
knowledge that dance has an evolving, constantly 
changing character; dance experience is multifarious 
and plurivocal, and dan ce itself can never be fully con-
tained by any single attempt to discipline, define, or 
describe it. Yet although seeking a uni vocal expression 
of"the" essence of dance may bea counter-productive 
research aim, giving voice to a "chorus eidetics" of 
dance-and of the impulse toward dance whose heart 
beats within ali movement- is sti li a worthwhile and 
timely task.

DASEIN 
In ordinary German, dasein means 
existence, especially human existence, but it is used by 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER in Sein und Zeit ( 1927) as a technica) 
term to signify that being whose very mode ofBeing is 
to understand Being and hence to raise the question of 
Being. Heidegger is exploiting the root meaning ofthe 
word "there-being" (da-sein): it is up to Dasein "tobe" 
(zu sein) the "there" (da) ofthe WORLD, i.e., tobe the 
place or locus where the world is disclosed or becomes 
phenomenally manifest. The thrust ofthe word "there" 
is not to signify one place as opposed to another, there 
as opposed to here, but rather the essential disclosed-
ness, manifestness, or phenomenality of things as a 
whole; sein in turn has a verbal and infinitival sense, 
"to be" the there. Hence the force of the term is to 
emphasize that Dasein must itself be the "there," the 
disclosedness of Being and world, that Dasein brings 
its "there" along with it. 
Heidegger thus is innovating upon a fundamental 
theme in EDMUND HUSSERL 's CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMEN-
OLOGY. Like Husserl, Heidegger agrees that the phe-
nomenality ofthe world must be traced back (reducere) 
to the "subject" that "constitutes" the world, a subject 
that thus enjoys a certain "transcendental" primacy. 
Like Husserl, who distinguishes between the transcen-
dental and the worldly EGo, Heidegger distinguishes 
between Dasein and human beings. But Heidegger ar-
gues that the very Being of this subject, when ques-
tioned more radically, is to be determined not as a 
transcendental subject but as Dasein, and that its work 
of "constitution" is a matter of Dasein 's "understand-
ing ofBeing." The latter, in turn, !ies at the hasis ofthe 
way Dasein understands itself and other beings of the 
same sort as itself, as well as worldly entities. 
The notion of Dasein thus serves to free pheno-
menology from the influence of a Cartesian and pure 
133 
transcendental subject and to reconceive it in more rad-
ically ontologica! terms by raising the question of the 
being of the sum or cogito. Rather than an epistemic 
subject that knows ( erkennen) the world, Dasein is con-
ceived as a being actively engaged in various worldly 
projects and ultimately in the task ofbeing a "self." It 
is up to Dasein "tobe" (zu sein) this being, actively to 
take over the task of being itself, of being the "there" 
ofworld and self. 
The "analytic" of Dasein is the explication of the 
defining features of such a being. Since the Being of 
this entity is "existence," the analytic ofDasein is said 
to be an "existential analytic" and its defining fea-
tures are said tobe "existentialia," as opposed to "cate-
gories," which are the defining features ofbeings other 
than Dasein. As the explication ofthe Being ofDasein, 
the analytic of Dasein is an ontologica! analysis, and 
can be called an existential-ontologica! analytic, as op-
posed to the ontologies of beings other than Dasein. 
But the existential-ontologica! analytic is not simply 
one among many ontologies; it is the first, primary, 
Of FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY of the being that bears an 
ontologica! primacy over ali other beings, and this in 
virtue of Dasein's understanding of Being. The aim 
and upshot of the analytic of Dasein is to lay bare the 
horizon within which Being itself can be understood. 
This analytic is not be confused with other inves-
tigations of human existence; it is not a psychologi-
cal, anthropological, biologica!, ethical, or theological 
investigation of human beings, but a strictly ontolog-
ica! study of the being that raises the question of Se-
ing. This discrimination corresponds, analogously, to 
Husserl 's separation of a purely transcendental science 
of consciousness from empirica! psychology. As an 
ontologica! investigation, the existential analytic is not 
an essay in EXISTENTIALISM, i.e., an existential PHILO-
SOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY that for Heidegger is properJy 
to be attributed to KARL JASPERS and that belongs to 
the field of existential anthropology. Heidegger does 
not dismiss existential anthropology in Sein und Zeit 
( 1927), but insists that it must take its lead from the 
analytic of Dasein. 
The analytic of Dasein is divided into two stages: 
a preliminary or preparatory stage, and a more pri-
mordial stage that builds upon and radicalizes the first 
stage; this division corresponds to the two published 
divisions of Sein und Zeit. A third division, never pub-

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
lished, was to address the formal features ofthe "mean-
ing" of Being in terms of time, the horizon for which 
was tobe established by the analytic ofDasein. These 
three divisions were to compose the "First Part" ofthe 
book, which was to be followed by a "Second Part'' 
dedicated to a historical "destruction" of the history 
of ontology. Inasmuch as the first two divisions ofthe 
book, which comprise the two stages ofthe ana1ytic of 
Dasein, were the only sections of the book ever to be 
published, Heidegger's entire project as an author was 
for a long time identified with the analytic of Dasein 
itself. The latter was in turn, despite the warnings to the 
contrary in the text itself, further identified with an ex-
istential anthropology. Only his publications after the 
war, beginning with the famous "Brief liber den Hu-
manismus" ( 194 7), were able to dispel this long held 
interpretation ofhis work, although it is now clear that 
by 194 7 Heidegger 's views had undergone a funda-
mental shift from those developed in the analytic of 
Dasein. 
The work of the analytic of Dasein is carried out 
by way of a HERMENEUTIC AL PHENOMENOLOGY. That is, 
the basic traits of Dasein are not simply read off Da-
sein, as if Dasein simply lay in plain view before the 
phenomenological investigator. They are instead in-
terpretively set free by means of a projection of the 
fundamental character of Dasein's being, which al-
lows Dasein to show itself as it is. The initial pro-
jection ofDasein is set in terms (borrowed from Soren 
Kierkegaard and Jaspers) of "existence," which Hei-
degger claims is the "essence" of Dasein, the scare 
quotes signifying an unorthodox sense of "essence" 
(hen ce the "existential analytic"). Existence is nota hy-
pothesis or assumption whose deductive implications 
the analytic will explore, but a disclosive projection 
that frees up Dasein in its phenomenality, a projection 
whose worth is proven by the phenomenological work 
it makes possible. The initial projection of Dasein in 
terms of existence makes possible a "preparatory fun-
damental analysis ofDasein," which will itselfneed to 
be radicalized and repeated in a second, more primor-
dial projection of Dasein 's being. 
The preparatory analysis turns on the notion that Da-
sein is characterized by "being-in-the-world,"which is 
taken tobe Dasein 's nearest but most easily overlooked 
characteristic. As an inquiry into something that is in-
conspicuous by its conspicuousness, something onto-
logically near but phenomenologically far, phenomen-
ology itself is conceived in the analytic of Dasein as 
the cultivation of a sensitivity to what !ies nearest but 
unobserved in experience. Being-in-the-world is ex-
pounded in terms ofthree ingredient elements: world, 
being-with others in the world, and being-in as such. 
The analysis of the woRLD, which bears a sim-
ilarity to Husserl's investigations into the lifeworld 
(Lebenswelt), is o ne of the most famous parts of Sein 
und Zeit. Starting out from an analysis ofthe surround-
ing world ( Umwelt), Dasein is described as a being 
concerned with the most immediately pressing every-
day affairs. The Umwelt is taken tobe a world ofuten-
sils, each linked to the next to form a systematic con-
catenation in which Dasein always finds itself already 
immersed. Breaking sharply with the primacy of the 
epistemological subject, Heidegger says that Dasein 
does not primari1y "know" this world ( Welterkennt-
nis), but deals with it concernfully, and so there can 
be no question ofneeding to establish how a worldless 
subject crosses over to the transcendence ofthe world. 
Being-in-the-world is always already transcendent. In 
an analytic of Dasein it would make no sense to ask 
how the existence ofthe world can be proved, since that 
is a question raised by a being characterized by being-
in-the-world. In one of the most famous descriptions 
the phenomenological movement has known, Heideg-
ger says that Dasein does not look at a hammer and 
observe its properties; Dasein does not wa1k around 
the hammer and actively synthesize its changing per-
spectiva] variations (Abschattungen) into the unity of 
a hammer-object. Rather, Dasein hammers. The world 
itself is the totality of involvements within which Da-
sein works out its everyday worldly concerns, a world 
within which Dasein a1ways finds itselfand a1ready sit-
uated and toward which Dasein reaches out in projec-
tive understanding. "World" is a feature not of things, 
but ofDasein 's being-in-the-world, of Dasein 's world-
understanding, so that Dasein can be thought of as 
bringing its wor1d along with it. 
Being-in-the-wor1d is also being-with others in the 
world. IfDasein is nota world1ess subject, neither is it 
a solitary ego. Far from needing to prove the existence 
of others, others are those among whom Oase in finds 
itself already there. Others are not those whom one is 
not, but those among whom one is there "also." So far 
are we from needing to establish the existence of others 

DASEIN 
that the real task is to find oneselfin the midst of others, 
tobe oneselfin the midst ofthe pregiven, constant, and 
quietly imperious rule that others exert over us. This 
leads to the famous account of "authenticity" and "in-
authenticity," the ma in phenomenal features of which 
are taken from Kierkegaard but recast by Heidegger in 
the terms of an analytic ofDasein. He is often criticized 
by interpersonal thinkers like GABRIEL MARCEL and EM-
MANUEL LEVINAS for regarding the other person as a 
threat to, rather than a condition of, authenticity; the 
usual Heideggerian rejoinder is to distinguish being-
with, as an ontologica) structure of Dasein, from the 
"ontic" and ethical question of interpersonal relations. 
The third and pivotal element ofbeing-in-the-world 
is that of being-in as such. Here Heidegger makes it 
plain that in an analytic of Dasein, being-in does not 
ha ve the sense of being contained in the world but of 
disclosing the world or, to use Husserl 's Ianguage, of 
constituting the world. In a series of crucial and fa-
mous analyses, Heidegger identifies being-in as a tri-
partite process. Oase in is a being that runs ahead into its 
possibility-to-be (projection), while ali along finding it-
self always already in a situation not of its own choos-
ing that scts the terms and fixes the parameters ofwhat 
is possible for Dasein (thrownness). This movement 
ahead into possibilities that in a certain way comes 
from behind is, likewise, ali along liable tobe drawn off 
course, to fali by the wayside, to be scattered and dis-
sipated by idle and empty curiosities (fallenness). That 
the tripartite process of projection, thrownness, and 
fallenness is at bottom but one unitary process is dis-
closed by the phenomenon of"anxiety" (Kierkegaard), 
in which Oase in finds itself overtaken (thrownness) by 
an indefinite anxiety about its possibilities (projection) 
and inclined to take flight from (fallen) its freedom. 
"Anxiety" in turn discloses the unitary being of Da-
sein as "care," which is defined almost by way of a 
summary of the preceding discussion, in a long hy-
phenated expression, as ahead-of-itself-being-already-
in-the-world-alongside-others. With this determination 
of the Being of Dasein, the first stage of the existential 
analytic is completed. 
As a HERMENEUTIC inquiry, the existential analytic 
of Dasein is able to press forward only by deepening 
and radicalizing its initial projection ofDasein's being 
as "existence," and thereby determin ing the "meaning" 
ofDasein 's being (care). That is the task ofthe second, 
135 
"more primordial" stage of the analytic. The initial 
projection in terms of existence, which turned on Da-
sein's everyday being-in-the-world, is insufficient on 
two counts. First, it failed to take into account the total-
ity of Dasein, the whole of its being, having contented 
itselfwith Dasein's being from day to day while omit-
ling the end ofDasein, its ultimate possibility, its death. 
Second, it failed to probe the primordial authenticity of 
Oase in and was content to take up Oase in in its average 
everydayness. The first shortcoming is remedied by a 
famous analysis of"being-toward-death" in which the 
reach of Oase in 's projective structure is extended to 
Dasein 's final possibility, its possibility not-to-be, or 
not to "be-there." The second failing is remedied by 
introducing the phenomenon of resoluteness in which 
Dasein, called back to itself from everydayness by the 
caii it hears in running forth into its own death, seizes 
upon its own most proper possibility to be the being 
that it is called upon to be. 
This resoluteness that runs forth into Dasein 's own 
deepest and most unique possibility is then determined 
in terms ofDasein 's "TIME." The time ofDasein is taken 
to be the "meaning" of care, i.e., the more primordial 
projection of its being and the more radical working 
out of the initial projection of "existence." The tem-
porality of Dasein is determined as a primarily fu tura) 
being-toward, running forth toward possibilities that 
come to Dasein from behind, from what Dasein "has 
been" ali along. For Dasein to move forward to its fu-
ture is to return to what has always and ali along been 
possible. Unlike the notion of an unfettered freedom 
in the early work of JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, the freedom and 
futural Being of Dasein is to seize upon possibilities 
that are tied to what Dasein has been ali along. For au-
thentic, futural Dasein the past is not over, not "past," 
nor is it a dead weight, but a simmering potentiality 
whose latent possibilities are seized upon, opened up, 
and disclosed by authentic resoluteness. These possi-
bilities are precisely closed off to inauthentic Dasein 
and this just because its irresoluteness fa ils to disclose 
the possible in what has been. The past of inauthen-
tic Dasein weighs it down, forecloses possibilities, and 
contracts it to the passing immediacies ofthe moment. 
The existential analytic of the "temporality" of Da-
sein is extended and completed by an analytic of its 
"historicality." Dasein is not a being "in" HISTORY but 
a primordially historical being, a being that institutes 

136 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
historical happening, a being that happens by histori-
cizing. Authentic historicizing, rooted in the authen-
ticity of Dasein, is the process by which Dasein hands 
down to itself possibilities from the tradition, seizing 
upon and appropriating what was implicit, forgotten, 
latent, or repressed by the historical tradition, and this 
by going back to the originary, founding sources that 
set the tradition in motion. The possibilities that are 
handed down to a "generation" (collective rather than 
individual Dasein) are said to comprise that genera-
tion 's "destiny" ( Geschick). The analysis of histori-
cality makes plain what a "destruction" of a historical 
tradition would mean, viz., a recuperating and unleash-
ing of its energies, not a razing. The analysis also fi lis 
in a gap in the existential analytic by providing a clue 
as to how the existential resoluteness ofDasein would 
acquire "existentiell" (concrete, determinate) definite-
ness, viz., by settling into the particularities ofthe his-
torical "situation" in which it finds itself. This might be 
compared to the way the concrete historical Sittlichkeit 
of HEGEL aimed at making definite and correcting the 
purely formal Moralităt of KANT. 
The last task that remains for the analytic ofDasein 
is to explicate the "temporal" meaning ofDasein's ev-
eryday being and the meaning of ordinary time, tasks 
that are taken up in two of the final chapters of the 
published sections of Sein und Zeit. 
The categories of the analytic of Dasein were re-
visited in the 1930s, during Heidegger's notorious Na-
tional Socialist years, where they were rehearsed in the 
form of a heroic and hyper-voluntaristic nationalism 
that intensified and exaggerated certain tendencies of 
the 192 7 text. He unabashedly invoked the language of 
authenticity, resoluteness, and historicality in his Na-
tional Socialist speeches and writings. According to a 
report of KARL u5wiTH, Heidegger himself personally 
regarded the notion of historicality as the most im-
portant link to his politica! vision in the 1930s. The 
National Socialist Party was conceived to be the in-
strument by which the people of Germany could seize 
upon the possibility that their historical tradition sent 
their way, which was the "destiny" ofthis people tobe 
the metaphysical and spiritualleaders of the West. To 
resolve upon this destiny was to choose the new mind, 
to affirm the new order, and to follow the Fiihrer. 
After the war, both the notion and the language of 
an "analytic ofDasein" disappeared. In "Briefiiber den 
Humanismus," Heidegger subjected the analytic to a 
radical reinterpretation that amounted to a farewell to 
the existential analytic and to hermeneutic phenomen-
ology and that set the course of his path of thought 
firmly in the direction of the "thought of Being." This 
course had in fact been set many years earlier, as early 
as the Beitrăge zur Philosophie (Contributions to phi-
losophy, [1936-38]), but it was unknown to anyone 
who had not followed the wartime lectures. Partly in ac-
cord with motives that are present in the original ques-
tion ofBeing itself and partly because ofthe foundering 
of the extreme voluntarism of the early 1930s, he re-
described "Dasein" as the "there" of"Being" (das "da" 
des "Se ins"). Human beings- Heidegger stopped us-
ing the term "Dasein" except to mention or interpret it 
-are to serve as the place (the "da") in which Being 
makes a clearing for itself, in which Being reveals-and-
conceals itself. Unlike Sein und Zeit, in which Dasein 
means to take over and "be" the "there" (so that the 
sein in Da-sein had an infinitival force) he now says 
that human existence must open itself to the advance 
or advent of "Being" (Sein), which clears a space for 
itself(a "there," da) in human beings. The "essence" of 
"Dasein" !ies, accordingly, in ek-sisting, ec-statically, 
in the openness of Being. 
With that radicalization and transformation of the 
original problematics, the analytic ofDasein undergoes 
a sea change. A new wave of Heideggerian thinking 
would then sweep post-war Europe, a wave that would 
recei ve a particularly favorable reception- ironically, 
in view ofthe politica! situation ofthe two countries-in 
France, and then in the United States.

DEEP ECOLOGY 
JOHN D. CAPUTO 
Villanova University 
(See also ECOLOGY). Deep 
ecology has been related to the thought of MARTIN HEI-
DEGGER, who took phenomenology down a different 
road than his mentor, EDMUND HUSSERL. For Heideg-
ger, the major issue for phenomenological investiga-
tion was not the intentiona! structures and correlates 
of absolute consciousness, but rather the being of en-
tities and the nature of Being (Sein) itself. Convinced 
that human experience and knowledge are finite and 
historical, he maintained that people living in different 
historical epochs ha ve differing ways ofunderstanding 
what it means for entities "tobe." In our technological 
epoch, for instance, people understand nature as little 
more than raw material that is valuable solely because it 
can be used to enhance human power. Because he crit-
icized technological modernity's domineering attitude 
toward nature and because he envisioned a POSTMODERN 
era in which people would "let things be," Heidegger 
has sometimes been read as an intellectual forerunner 
oftoday's "deep ecology" movement. His understand-
ing of Being, and how Being has become constricted 
in technological modernity, can be reviewed before the 
plausibility of this reading is examined. 
In traditional metaphysics, Being often refers to the 
ultimate ground or foundation for entities. According 
to Heidegger, Plato initiated this tradition by defining 
Being as eidos, the eterna! form or blueprint that gives 
intelligibility to entities in the mutable spatiotemporal 
realm. For Plato, eidos is ontologically superior be-
cause it is the eterna! and unchanging foundation for 
ali entities. Heidegger uses the term "constant pres-
ence" (Anwesenheit) to describe Being as an eterna! 
foundation. 
He offers at least two criticisms ofthe "metaphysics 
of presence." First, Being involves finitude, not eter-
nity. Indeed, the reference to the present in "constant 
presence" indicates a concealed temporal dimension 
even in the traditional metaphysical conception ofbe-
ing. Second, Being cannot be adequately understood 
as a foundation or ground, for such an understanding 
regards Being as a superior entity, such as the supreme 
being, or God. For Heidegger, FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY 
is not a matter of "telling a story" about where things 
carne from, or how they were produced, but instead is 
an account ofhow entities can manifest themselves in-
telligibly as entities, that is, as things that are. "Being" 
names the self-manifesting or presencing (Anwesen) 
by virtue ofwhich an entity reveals itselfas such. For 
such presencing to occur, he postulated that there must 
be an "absencing," "clearing," or "opening," which he 
called TIME. Neither Being nor time "are" entities; in-
stead, they are ontologically potent "nothingness": the 
conditions necessary for entities "tobe" in the sense of 
becoming manifest. 
Presencing and temporality, Being and time, are 
mediated through DASEIN, Heidegger's term for the 
ontologica! capacity defining human existence. Hu-
man Dasein exists as the three-dimensional "there" 
(da) through which Being as presencing (Sein) can 
take place. In his !ater writings, he maintained that the 
clearing is also opened up through LANGUAGE. Dasein's 
complex linguistic and temporal structure enables hu-
mans not only to understand the intelligible structure of 
entities, but also to grasp the fact that entities "are" at 
ali. Animals may encounter other entities, but they do 
not encounter them as things that are, for animals can-
not open up the temporal-linguistic clearing in which 
entities can "present" themselves and thus "be." Hen ce 
Heidegger criticized Aristotle 's influential definiti an of 
humans as "rational animals." 
In everyday existence, Dasein conceives of itself

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
not as the temporal-linguistic clearing for entities tobe 
manifest, but rather as just another type of entity, for 
instance, a "person" or an "intelligent animal." By dis-
closing itself in this way, Dasein manages to conceal 
its own nothingness, finitude, mortality. When anxiety 
threatens to reveal the truth about Dasein 's mortality, it 
can choose to exist either inauthentically by disowning 
itself and fleeing into distractions, or authentically, by 
affirming its finitude and thus by inviting its tempo-
rality to become more expansive, so that entities can 
reveal themselves in richer and more variegated ways. 
As authentic, then, Dasein can "Jet things be" instead 
oftreating them merely as instruments or objects. 
The !ater Heidegger argued that concealment ofBe-
ing results not because of denial of mortality, but rather 
because Being has increasingly concealed itself since 
Plato's time. As a result, people have focused on en-
tities, not on the disclosive event (Being) by which 
they are revealed as entities. Instead of understand-
ing Being as the non-thinglike presencing of entities, 
then, metaphysicians defined Being as a superior type 
of entity, for example, God or the Absolute. At the 
start of the modern age, Descartes executed an anthro-
pocentric shift when he proposed that human reason 
provides the ground for the truth, reality, and Being 
of entities. For him, for something "to be" means for 
it to be re-presented as an idea whose clarity and dis-
tinctness matches that ofthe cogito, that is, the rational 
subject's certainty about its own existence. Since only 
phenomena studied by a quantitative NATURAL SCIENCE 
such as mathematical physics can meet this standard, 
however, science carne to play a preeminent role in 
defining truth and reality in modern times. Scientific 
reason discloses things in a powerful but limited way: 
as complex forms of matter in motion. 
Modern humanity began defining itself in terms of 
scientific NATURALISM. Blind to the fact that human ex-
istence offers the ontologica! clearing in which entities 
can manifest themselves, modern humanity views it-
self instead as an elaborate mechanical entity, or as a 
"clever animal." For Heidegger, then, Western meta-
physics leads not to human "progress," but rather to 
technological nihilism in which everything-including 
humankind -
stands revealed as raw material for 
the goal of greater power and security. According 
to Heidegger, this arrogant anthropocentric humanism 
(whether capitalist or communist) not only diminishes 
humankind, but also wreaks havoc on nature. Human 
efforts to reform existing practices cannot succeed and 
in fact will make matters worse, because widespread 
cultural, social, and ecologica! crises are symptoms 
of modern humanity's obsession with control. Hence, 
Heidegger concludes, humankind can be saved only 
if there arises an alternative to modern technology's 
one-dimensional disclosure of the being of entities. In 
1966, he said that "only a god can save us now." 
What is the possible kinship between Heidegger 
and deep ecology? Deep ecologists, who represent one 
branch of the radical ecology movement, are said to 
be "deep" because they purportedly ask profounder 
questions about the origins oftoday's ecologica! crisis. 
Like Heidegger, deep ecologists insist that this crisis is 
not accidental, but instead a symptom ofthe arrogance 
of anthropocentric humanism, which diminishes hu-
mankind while wantonly destroying nature. He would 
agree with deep ecologists that attempts by "shallow" 
environmentalists to "reform" technological modernity 
(e.g., by passing pollution controllaws) only serve to 
further its quest for total control over nature. Like Hei-
degger, deep ecologists believe that only a basic shift in 
humanity's self-understanding and its attitude toward 
nature will prevent social and ecologica! catastrophe. 
According to deep ecology, for humanity to realize 
its genuine potential, and thus to be authentic, people 
must Jet other things "be" what they are, instead of 
treating them merely as resources for human ends. For 
Heidegger and deep ecologists, existing authentically 
does not mean achieving ever greater technical power 
and security at the expense of everyone and everything 
else, but rather existing in a manner that lets things 
manifest themselves in ways that are appropriate to the 
things themselves. Modernity's interconnected social 
and ecologica! crisis will end, then, only when human-
ity sheds its dissociative attitude toward nature and 
begins instead to identify more widely with ali things. 
Neither deep ecologists nor Heidegger, however, con-
vincingly explain how such a radical transformation of 
modern human existence might occur. 
There are good reasons for thinking ofHeidegger as 
a predecessor of deep ecology. He loved ski ing and hik-
ing in his native countryside; he often described Being 
and thinking in metaphors referring to the character-
istics of farmland and trees, mountains and animals; 
and he criticized modernity's constricted disclosure of 

DEEP ECOLOGY 
139 
Being, which has led to such reckless destruction ofna-
ture. Attempts to portray him as a forerunner of deep 
ecology, however, have encountered at least two dif-
ficulties. For one thing, whereas deep ecologists tend 
to portray humans as living beings that arose as a con-
sequence of billions of years of terrestrial evolution, 
he rejected ali naturalistic accounts of humankind and 
claimed that the "history of Being" began only about 
2,500 years ago. Does not Heidegger's antinaturalism 
preclude efforts to interpret him as an "ecologica!" 
thinker? 
The second difficulty is that Heidegger (both the 
man and his thought) has been far more implicated 
with National Socialism than most commentators (the 
present writer included) previously believed. And sin ce 
there are certa in parallels between his thought and deep 
eeology, does this mean that deep ecology tends to-
ward a type of "ecofascism"? The early Heidegger's 
antinaturalism, including his sharp distinction between 
humans and every other type of entity (including an-
imals ), was so strong that o ne of his students, Hans 
Jonas (1903~ 1993 ), considered him to be a gnostic, 
that is, someone who holds that humankind has been 
"thrown" into a meaningless material world by an in-
scrutable divine power. Another of his students, KARL 
LăWITH, maintained that his mentor was a Cartesian du-
alist and an anthropocentrist who tended to ignore the 
wider cosmos that gave birth to humankind. Heideg-
ger's apparent antinaturalistic anthropocentrism would 
seem difficult to reconcile with deep ecology's appar-
ent naturalistic ecocentrism. 
Yet Heidegger would have warned deep ecologists 
against adopting crucial aspects ofmodernity's natural-
istic conceptions ofhumankind and nature, even while 
simultaneously criticizing modernity for destroying 
wild nature and diminishing humankind. The concept 
of "ecology" itself, which is so important for deep 
ecologists, arose from scientific attempts to explain 
the relation between organisms and environment. The 
science of ecology discloses ecosystems as complex 
energy ftows, yet such a disclosure can be used not only 
for protecting nature from abuse, but also for justifying 
exploitative agribusiness practices. Modern science is 
closely tied to the naturalistic worldview of modern hu-
manism. Naturalists regard humans as clever animals 
competing for survival with other life forms. Human-
ists portray people as the highest form of life because 
they are endowed with REASON. Such reason allegedly 
gives humans the "right" to use lower life forms in 
whatever ways that humans see fit. When naturalism 
combines with humanism to form "naturalistic human-
ism," violence against nature ensues, for naturalistic 
humanism says that humanity's struggle for survival is 
not only biologically necessary but morally justified. 
Many deep ecologists maintain that by achieving 
a wider sense of identification with nonhuman enti-
ties, people would spontaneously care for those enti-
ties just as they care for their own bodies, families, and 
friends. For deep ecologists, humans are only one life 
form among many, each of which has a right to ftour-
ish. Because Heidegger seems to privi lege humankind 
and to deny its connection with other life forms, how-
ever, he seems to reproduce the very anthropocentrism 
that deep ecologists hold responsible for ecologica! 
violence. Heidegger would reply that insofar as deep 
ecologists conceive of humans as animal organisms, 
they reproduce the very naturalism that is partly re-
sponsible for modernity's violence against nature. The 
leading deep ecologist, Arne Naess, however, appreci-
ates Heidegger's attempt to redefine both humankind 
and nature, so as to recognize humankind's uniqueness 
and to affirm the inherent worth of nature. 
Naess reads Heidegger as saying that humanity is 
destined to be not the scourge of nature, but rather 
the open awareness that bears witness to nature and 
participates in its creative activity. For Naess, as for 
Heidegger, this open awareness cannot be adequately 
understood in terms either ofnaturalistic materialism or 
of anthropocentric humanism. Moreover, nature can-
not be comprehensively defined as a totality ofphysical 
processes. Inftuenced by Mahayana BUDDHISM, Heideg-
ger, and Spinoza, Naess regards entities not as solid ma-
terial objects, but rather as phenomena, that is, as tem-
porary manifestations that arise and disappear within 
an open realm. Like Heidegger, Naess says that human 
awareness takes place within this open realm, but is 
not identica! with it. Far from being the "possessors" 
of such awareness, humans are themselves appropri-
ated as the clearing through which entities can manifest 
themselves. According to Naess, humans realize their 
highest possibility by compassionately allowing phe-
nomena to occur without unduly restricting or harming 
them. Naess and Heidegger would agree, then, that 
the science of ecology says something true about hu-

140 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
mankind and nature, but overlooks important aspects 
ofboth. 
Despite the early Heidegger's relative lack of in-
terest in nature, his !ater meditations on pre-Socratic 
thinkers such as Heraclitus offered him a way of com-
bining his personallove for nature with his ontologica] 
concerns. He carne to interpret physis- a Greek word 
usually translated as "nature" -
not as a totality of 
material entities, but rather as the ontologica! power 
that gives rise to ali phenomena and appropriates hu-
man Oase in as the clearing for their self-manifestation. 
Since he defined "nature" in what was for him an on-
tologically more satisfying manner, Heidegger can be 
viewed as antinaturalistic only in the sense of opposing 
modern science's generally reductionistic and materi-
alistic view of nature, a view also opposed by deep 
ecology. Hen ce his critique of naturalism does not au-
tomatically disqualify attempts to see connections be-
tween his thought and deep ecology. 
The second difficulty involved in interpreting Hei-
degger as a forerunner of deep ecology is his involve-
ment with Nazism. Though deep ecologists oppose 
fascism, some critics tend to detect "ecofascist" ten-
dencies in deep ecology. Apparent parallels between 
Heidegger's thought and deep ecology provide ammu-
nition for such critics. Here it is important to recall that 
because Nazism so emphasized the relation between 
healthy nature and pure racial blood, widespread envi-
ronmental movements could not begin in Europe until 
decades after World War II. Many progressive thinkers, 
whether socialist or liberal democratic, have sus-
pected that radical environmentalism promotes reac-
tionary, antihumanistic, and possibly racist views. Such 
thinkers fear that deep ecologists will caii for authori-
tarian politica! measures (e.g., draconian birth control 
measures for Third World countries, or widespread sus-
pension of politica! rights) to "save" the Earth from 
alleged ecocatastrophe, just as the Nazis maintained 
that only authoritarianism could "sa ve" Germany from 
polluted blood and degraded landscapes. These fears 
do not seem justified, however, for deep ecologists are 
far more influenced by democratic ideals than Heideg-
ger was. Also, deep ecologists have the advantage of 
hindsight regarding the dangers posed by Heidegger's 
critique of modernity. Nevertheless, deep ecologists 
and Heidegger scholars alike must explicitly address 
the dangers of fascist authoritarianism. 
Heidegger became involved with Nazism in 1933 
because he thought Hitler would save Germany from 
the twin evils of capitalism and communism by ini-
tiating a new beginning to Western history. Though 
eventually disillusioned by the historical reality of 
Nazism, Heidegger never disavowed its "inner truth 
and greatness." But what he regarded as this "inner 
truth" seems inconsistent with what most people under-
stand by Nazism. For instance, Edward Pois describes 
Nazism as a "religion of nature," but Heidegger did 
not promote nature worship of any sort. Further, he 
defined "nature" in a way foreign to the naturalism 
adopted by many Nazi ideologues. Whereas Nazism 
portrayed the German Volk as clever animals compet-
ing for survival against subhuman "parasites," Heideg-
ger condemned such racist ideas, because he rejected 
the view that humans could be uriderstood in biologi-
cal terms. Given the centrality of such violent racism 
for Nazism, one wonders why the antinaturalistic Hei-
degger could have supported that movement. JACQUES 
DERRIDA has suggested that even if Heidegger was not 
guilty of biologica! racism, perhaps he was still guilty 
of a type of "metaphysical" racism, insofar as he em-
phasized German 's linguistic superiority. 
Deep ecology has benefited from the fact that Hei-
degger, one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th cen-
tury, condemned technological modernity's heedless 
exploitation of nature. Heidegger also warned against 
uncritically adopting the powerful, but limited, under-
standing ofnature provided by modern science, includ-
ing the science of ecology. By his wholesale renuncia-
tion of modernity, however, Heidegger helped to pa ve 
the way for his affi.liation with a violent, reactionary 
movement. A task for deep ecologists is to learn from 
Heidegger's thought in the struggle to protect wild na-
ture, but also to avoid repeating his politica! mistakes. 
A central issue for deep ecology, then, is how to criti-
cize the dark si de of technological modernity, includ-
ing its mistreatment of nature, while simultaneously 
furthering and transform ing modernity's emancipatory 
politica) aims.

JACQUES DERRIDA 
MICHAEL E. ZIMMERMAN 
Tulane University 
Born in A1geria in 1930, 
Derrida studied EDMUND HUSSERL and phenomeno1ogy 
in general under Maurice de Gandillac and then Jean 
Hyppolite in Paris at the Ecole Normale Superieure. 
His studies of Husserlian phenomenology were also 
formed under the infiuence ofTRAN ouc THAO and JEAN 
CAVAILLES, and in opposition to the views of JEAN-PAUL 
SARTRE and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY. 
Derrida introduced the term "deconstruction" in La 
voix et le phenomene ( 1967), but its historica1 and 
philosophical roots are to be found in Husserl and 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER. In the ear]y 1920s Husserl intro-
duced the term "Abbau" to designate the proper method 
for analyzing the genesis of experience. This method 
of GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY invo]ves a structura] dis-
mantling or unbuilding (abbauen) of the intentiona! 
experiences under analysis, and Husserl distinguishes 
the method ofunbuilding (Abbau-Analyse) from a cor-
relative method ofupbuilding (Aufbau-Analyse). Both 
moments are required for a CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMEN-
OLOGIC AL inquiry into the validity of experience. 
Heidegger apparently began using the term Ah-
bau at about the same time, giving Husserl's genetic-
structural approach a strongly historical turn. In Sein 
und Zeit ( 1927) Heidegger calls for a destruction (De-
struktion) or critica! deconstruction (Abbau) of tradi-
tional concepts, tracing them back historically to their 
original sources. The aim is to retrieve and restore a 
more fundamental- specifically temporal- experi-
ence of Being than that ofthe Western tradition, which 
determines the sense of Being as presence. It would 
then be necessary to show how the multiple senses of 
Being-Being and Becoming, Being and Appearance, 
Being and Thought, Being and the Ought-derive from 
this common root. 
In the 1960s, Derrida took up the Heideggerian 
project, but radicalized it. Important for him were 
Heidegger's Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik 
(1929) and Einfiihrung in die Metaphysik (Introduc-
tion to metaphysics, 1935). The moment of continuity 
is found in Derrida 's project of deconstructing what he 
calls the "metaphysics ofpresence." According to Der-
rida, Husserl 's phenomenology, with its commitment 
to the "principle of ali principles"- namely, the prin-
cip le stated in Ideen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie 
und phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913) "that 
every originary presentive intuition is a legitimizing 
source of cognition, that everything originarily (so to 
speak, in its 'personal' actuality) offered to us in 'intu-
ition' is tobe simply accepted as what it is presented as 
being, but also only within the limits in which it is pre-
sented there"- is committed to presence as the source 
ofvalidity, and is thus a prime object for a "deconstruc-
tive" reading. The moment of radicalization is found 
in Derrida's charge that Heidegger himself was un-
able to free himself from the metaphysics of presence. 
Derrida argues that the search for a more fundamen-
tal experience conceals a commitment to presence. For 
Derrida, if the "common root" truly accounts for the 
entire diversity of senses ofBeing, then it itself must be 
structured such that ali the senses are combined there 
unhierarchically or "undecidably." 
As opposed to Husserl 's early treatment oflanguage 
as the instrument and achievement of thinking, Derrida 
tries to show that LANGUAGE, the sign, and in particular 
writing are the very medium ofthought and the condi-

tion of possibility of science. The result is a radicaliza-
tion of Husserl 's analysis of the crisis of modern NAT-
URAL SCIENCE: for Derrida the crisis is not an accident 
that can be undone, but rather a structural necessity. 
Influenced primarily by Friedrich Nietzsche ( 1844-
1900), Ferdinand de Saussure ( 1857-1913 ), Sigmund 
Freud ( 1856---1939), and Heidegger, Derrida decon-
structs the phenomenological commitment to the meta-
physics of presence under severa] interrelated rubrics, 
primarily phonocentrism and logocentrism. Any philo-
sophical position that claims a primacy and autonomy 
for cognition, LOGIC, and science over MEANING, poetry, 
and LITERATURE is said to be logocentric. Any philo-
sophical position that privileges voice ( or speech) over 
writing is said to be phonocentric. 
Husserl provides a classical formulation of a logo-
centric position in Formale und transzendentale Logik 
( 1929) and the phenomenological discipline of tran-
scendental logic is to be the accomplishment of the 
self-grounding ofREASON. Derrida argues that Husserl 's 
attempt to isolate an instance of pure presence in the !iv-
ing present demonstrates, against Husserl's intentions, 
that presence is a function of absence, that prima! im-
pression is made possible by retention, by a trace ofthe 
past that makes the presence of the present possible, 
and not vice versa. Crucial here is his interpretation of 
retention: it is not a mere modification of prima! im-
pression or presence. Rather, like secondary memory, 
a type of RE-PRESENTATIO'J, it resembles a sign. Reten-
tion is what Derrida calls a "trace" or "arche-writing." 
Given this interpretation of retention, Husserl 's delin-
eation ofpresence seems to deconstruct itself, and this 
undermines the logocentrism of the principle of ali 
principles by deferring in principle the ideal of ful-
fillment. Without an origin in pure presence, reason 
cannot ground itself. 
Derrida also argues that logocentrism necessarily 
manifests itself as phonocentrism, the position (said 
to be found in explicit form in such thinkers as Plato, 
Aristotle, Rousseau, Hegel, Husserl, and Saussure) that 
meaning (Bedeutung), what a speaker wants to say 
(vouloir-dire), is immediately present to the mind only 
in voice (or speech) as opposed to writing, which is 
classically defined in coMMUNICATION as the sign of 
a sign. According to Derrida, in the Logische Unter-
suchungen (1900-190 1) Husserl radicalizes this pri-
macy of speech by focusing on the inner speech of 
monologue in solitary mental life as a way of thema-
tizing the expressive essence of language purified of 
any contamination with indication. His deconstructive 
reading aims to show that this strategy fails, that the 
differential structure oflanguage, which Derrida refers 
to as writing, reappears, contaminating the expressive 
purity of inner speech. Derrida thus claims that the tra-
ditional distinction between speech and writing loses 
its metaphysical significance. 
Husserl 's transcendental phenomenology thus ap-
pears to Derrida as the very height of modern meta-
physics. The deconstructive reading of phenomen-
ological texts, above ali in his La voix et le phenomene, 
proceeds in two phases. The first phase examines hier-
archies in order to find a way of reversing them. This 
reversal takes place by finding contradictions within 
the argumentation that established the hierarchy. The 
second phase, which is not necessarily second tempo-
rally, then "re-inscribes" or redefines the previously 
repressed term in order to designate what made the 
opposition possible in the first place, in order to desig-
nate, in other words, the opposition 's "common root." 
Thus in La voix et le phenomene, Derrida argues that 
indication, writing, and absence turn out to be more 
fundamental than expression, speech, and prcsence. In-
stead ofthe principle of ali principles, one then has the 
"ultra-transcendental" (non-)principle of"dif(erance," 
Derrida's neologism that brings together "difference" 
(as opposed to identity) and "deferral" (as opposed 
to presence). He insists that this does not amount to 
an abandonment ofphenomenology; rather, it amounts 
to a sort of "phenomenology of phenomenology." If 
phenomenology attempts to describe how ali the dif-
ferent sorts of objects we know ari se from the phenom-
ena, then deconstruction attempts to penetrate the very 
"gap" within the phenomena that divides thcse differ-
ent regions ofbeing from o ne another and nevertheless 
joins them together. The result of deconstruction is thus 
the claim that presence and absence, TRUTH and false-
hood, are re-inscribed within this larger, differentiated 
context, diffi~rance. 
Derrida insists that deconstruction must continue 
to strive to satisfy the strict requirements of a tran-
scendental phenomenology. Moreover, he insists that 
deconstruction is not a method that is applied to texts, 
but is rather the violence that any logocentric text, with 
its commitment to its own truth and thus to presence, 

WILHELM DILTHEY 
143 
inflicts upon itself: the logocentric text deconstructs 
itself. He also insists that the result is not a new rel-
ativism, skepticism, or nihilism, arguing rather that 
it is the very undecidability of di[(t?rance that makes 
genuine ethical responsibility possible. Along with the 
principle of ali principles, Husserl 's conception of re-
sponsibility as self-responsibility is deconstructed. 
Derrida was very influential in France in the 1970s, 
and he remains an important figure. His initial influence 
in the UNITED STATES was in literary criticism, where 
he stimulated the movement known as deconstruction 
that has carne to be associated with POSTMODERNISM. 
During the last decade he has been increasingly read 
by American philosophers. His deconstructive reading 
of phenomenological texts has been criticized by 1.

WILHELM DILTHEY 
Born in Biebrich (now a 
suburb ofWiesbaden) on November 19, 1833, Dilthey 
initially studied theology at Heidelberg and Berlin, but 
increasingly devoted his attention to HISTORY and phi-
losophy. Influenced both by the historical school and by 
Friedrich Trendelenburg ( 1802-1872), Dilthey became 
critica! of HEGEL 's metaphysics and his dialectica! phi-
losophy of history. After teaching at Basel, Kie1, and 
Breslau, Dilthey was appointed in 1882 to the chair 
in philosophy at Berlin that Hegel had once occupied. 
His more empirica! approach to the understanding of 
history departs from Hegel in being radically multidis-
ciplinary. Dilthey's contributions to cultural and social 
history, to literary criticism, and to the history of the 
HUMAN SCIENCES in general found their philosophical 
grounding in a major, although unfinished, theoretical 
work, Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften (lntro-
duction to the human sciences, 1883 ). 
In 1883, Dilthey published the first of a projected 
two volumes of this work. In his dedication to Yorck 
van Wartenburg, he refers to his task as a "critique of 
historical reason." Book One ofthe Einleitung was de-
voted to an overview ofthe human sciences, Book Two 
to a history ofthe rise and fali ofmetaphysics in relation 
to the project of founding the natural and human sci-
ences. At the end ofthis history Dilthey maintains that 
both metaphysics and the modern NATURAL SCIENCES 
have established false models for the human sciences

conception of nature is a mere phenomenal abstrac-
tion from the more inclusive reality of life. Dilthey 
introduces the idea of a life-nexus (Zusammenhang 
des Lebens) as the source of reality, not only for the 
human sciences, but also the natural sciences. If the 
natural sciences tind it useful to explain phenomena by 
means of elemental entities and universal mechanistic 
laws, this does not entail that the natural sciences pos-
sess a more ultimate reality than the human sciences 
or that they should constrain the latter to drop the idea 
of teleology from their understanding ( Verstehen) of 
history and society. Since EDMUND HUSSERL carefully 
underlined his own copy of the part of the Einleitung 
where the natural sciences are criticized from the per-
spective of the life-nexus, it is possible that his own 
views of the LIFEWORLD and the rise of the natural sci-
ences in Die Krisis der europaischen Wissenschaften 
und die transzendentale Phănomenologie ( 1936)-as 
well as in earlier texts not published during his lifetime 
-
were influenced by Dilthey. 
The epistemological work was left for the second 
volume of the Einleitung, but Dilthey did not publish 
it during his lifetime. He did, however, produce two 
drafts ofthis volume that first appeared in 1982 in vol-
ume 19 ofthe Gesammelte Schriften. The draft written 
in Breslau, immediately before his move to Berlin, is 
of most interest to phenomenology. Here Dilthey ex-
amines the conditions of consciousness involved in 
our prescientific awareness ofreality. He begins Book 
Four with the principle ofphenomenality, according to 
which everything real is accessible as a fact of con-
sciousness without being reduced to a mere represen-
tation of consciousness. Dilthey shows how the facts 
of consciousness possess a primordial reality that al-
ready contains a reference to things beyond conscious-
ness. When we are aware of something as a fact of 
consciousness we possess what Dilthey calls Innewer-
den or reflexive awareness. This reflexive awareness is 
pre-reflective and involves a self-givenness but no ex-
plicit sense of self. Innewerden is thus not tobe equated 
with an objectifying self-consciousness, for it precedes 
any subject-object, act-content distinction. Reflexive 
awareness is proto-intentional in that it is oriented to-
ward the world even ifthe world is not yet thematized 
as an externa! objective domain. It is this sense of be-
ing already a part of the world ( cf. MARTIN HEIDEGGER 's 
being-in-the-world) that is lost in the natural sciences, 
but must be preserved in the human sciences. These 
initial descriptions of the facts of consciousness com-
prise an empirica! phenomenology and are at the level 
ofprescientific Wissen or immediate knowledge. They 
are not yet the descriptions of psychic structure at the 
level of scientific Erkenntnis or conceptual knowledge 
that will become predominant in the Jdeen iiber eine 
beschreibende und zergliedernde Psychologie (1894 ), 
where Dilthey presents his descriptive PSYCHOLOGY as 
a human science. 
One could argue that in Books Two and Four ofthe 
Einleitung Dilthey worked out views of consciousness, 
reality, and science that carne closest to Husserl and 
Heidegger. Moreover, he goes on in Book Fi veto artic-
ulate the prescientific life-nexus in terms of categories 
for which he explicitly rejects a psychological deriva-
tion. Dilthey calls his categories "life-categories" and 
contrasts them to KANT's formal categories, which are 
the purely intellectual conditions of our experience of 
nature. By contrast, the life-categories bring out the 
structures ofthe cognitive-affective-volitional breadth 
of life itself. We are practica! agents enmeshed in a 
factical context, and the life-categories articulate the 
very structure ofthis I-world relation. 
Although Heidegger distances his existential ia from 
categories in general, there is an important connec-
tion to Dilthey's categories of life. Heidegger con-
tends that categories rest on a concept of being as 
present-at-hand, while existentialia lay out DASEIN's 
dynamic ways of being, that is, the structures of 
its being-in-the-world. But the existentialia are rem-
iniscent of Diltheyan life-categories such as MEANING 
through which "life grasps life." Indeed, Heidegger 
himselfuses related language in an early lecture course, 
Phănomenologische Interpretationen zu Aristoteles. 
Einleitung in die phănomenologische F orschung (Win-
ter Semester 1921/22), where he invokes Grundkate-
gorien des Lebens in ways that anticipate his discus-
sions of existentialia in Sein und Zeit ( 1927), and at the 
same time remind us ofDilthey by claiming that "they 
come to life from life itself." 
Nevertheless, Heidegger carne to view Dilthey's 
project as too limited. In his estimation, Dilthey suc-
ceeded in deepening and broadening the use of his-

torical method but failed to ask the central question, 
namely, the question about the temporal being of his-
torical beings. But this is not entirely true, as Dilthey 
devoted considerable energy to analyzing TIME as a 
fundamental category of life itself. 
Time is characterized by the inexorable advance or 
Fortriicken of the present that participates in the full 
being of our life. Dilthey shows that the distinctions of 
time -
past, present, and future -
are not products 
of reflection, but are already available to our reflexive 
awareness of the present. It is representational or sci-
entific consciousness that is responsible for isolating 
the past and future from the present. 
Dilthey's ldeen develops a program for a descrip-
tive psychology as the first ofthe human sciences. Here 
Dilthey's viewpoint becomes narrower in scope, being 
concerned to delimit the relative methods ofthe natu-
ral and the human sciences. Ifpsychology is to provide 
a stable foundation for the human sciences, it may 
not begin with the explanatory hypotheses that char-
acterize the natural sciences and traditional associative 
psychologies. Whereas hypotheses are easily testable 
in the mathematical sciences of nature, in the domain 
of human and historical experience they are relatively 
untestable and therefore unstable. By describing what 
is given in lived experience, Dilthey's human scien-
tific psychology will be able to locate and build on 
the recurrent structures of experience. Whereas tradi-
tional explanatory psychologies speculated about basic 
elements of consciousness -
whether they be sense 
impressions or ideas -
which, like the hypothetical 
atoms of physics, then need to be connected by general 
laws, descriptive psychology finds that in lived experi-
ence the connectedness ofpsychic life is already given. 
The task of psychology is to describe the continuum 
of our lived experience and then to analyze it into its 
component parts. It is this aspect of Dilthey's ldeen 
that Husserl saw as a genial anticipation of his own 
phenomenological psychology. 
Since our lived experience comprises a meaning-
nexus, the parts must always be understood in relation 
to this nexus. Although Dilthey abides by the Kantian 
distinction between the cognitive, the affective, and the 
volitional aspects of consciousness, they cannot be sep-
arated into different faculties. Every psychic act will 
display ali three aspects, although in different propor-
tions. Only to the extent that we have isolated parts of 
experience from their original meaning-nexus do they 
become subject to explanation. Moreover, since our 
psychic life is related to our body, Dilthey is willing 
to allow naturalistic explanations a limited role within 
his descriptive psychology. 
Dilthey's "Die Entstehung der Hermeneutik" (The 
rise of hermeneutics, 1900) begins to sketch out an 
understanding of HERMENEUTICS that was to character-
ize his work until his death in 1911. While he does 
not abandon descriptions of lived experience, Dilthey 
comes to view their ability to capture the meaning of 
our life as more limited. Much of the meaning of our 
experience remains unconscious until it is expressed. 
Thus the description of the life of the subject cannot 
be do ne without the interpretation of its expressed ob-
jectifications. Dilthey resumed the task of a "critique 
of historical reason" from this hermeneutica! perspec-
tive, publishing the Aufbau der geschichtlichen Welt 
in den Geisteswissenschaften (The construction of the 
historical world in the human sciences, 191 0). 
There is a further problem that occasioned Dilthey's 
move to hermeneutics and underscores the limitations 
of description. The descriptions of psychology seem to 
function primarily on the scientific level of represen-
tational consciousness, which -
however well inte-
grated- stands apart from the world. How do we deal 
with our ordinary prescientific or reflexive awareness 
according to which we are already part of the world? 
Can description also be applied to its more inclusive 
life-nexus? Here Dilthey found inspiration in Husserl's 
Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900--1901) and theory of 
INTENTIONALITY. Dilthey had given a seminar on the 
second volume of this work in the winter semester 
1904/05. Husserl in turn visited Dilthey's home the fol-
lowing winter and !ater wrote that this meeting inspired 
him to occupy himselfwith the problems ofthe human 
sciences in his Jdeen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie 
und phănomenologischen Philosophie ll [ 1912-15] 
and !ater writings. 
It should be noted, however, that Husserl's attempts 
to ground understanding in empathy are not Diltheyan 
because Dilthey clearly separated the two processes. 
Despite the impression to the contrary, Dilthey hardly 
dealt with empathy and did not regard it as essential to 
understanding. For Husserl empathy was important as 
a way for the solipsistic EGO to get beyond itself and 
admit the existence of INTERSUBJECTIVITY. By contrast, 

146 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Dilthey's self is not a transcendental starting point, 
but a product of development. This acquired self is 
radically historical and already incorporates many in-
tersubjective or public features. 
In his descriptive psychology, Dilthey had devel-
oped a conception of an acquired psychic nexus that 
accumulates an individual 's lived experiences of the 
world. The acquired nexus embodies the overall cogni-
tive impression an individual has formed ofthe world, 
the evaluation of it based on feeling, and the volitional 
strivings engendered by both. This acquired psychic 
nexus is not fully conscious and therefore cannot be 
represented, but it exerts an inftuence on every con-
scious psychic act that we do try to describe. By reftect-
ing our sense of reality, it brings the objective sphere 
into the subjective sphere. As important as this is to 
understanding individuality, in the Aufbau Qilthey be-
comes equally concerned to conceive the inverse way 
in which individual subjects are intentionally related to 
objective and public spheres. To do so Dilthey appro-
priates the Hegelian term Objektiver Geist, (objective 
spirit), to describe the overall historical context for 
understanding. He rejects Hegel's particular definition 
of objective spirit as the sociohistorical stage of the 
self-realization of absolute Geist in fa vor of a concept 
consistent with a reinterpretation of Geist as human 
activity. Objective spirit designates the whole range of 
human objectifications, whether they be expressions in 
LANGUAGE and other media meant to communicate, or 
ACTIONs and works meant to inftuence. This objective 
spirit is not only the embodiment of human behav-
ior and practices, but the medium within which they 
occur. It includes the contexts we share to make inter-
action possible: not only the sociopolitical institutions 
originally considered by Hegel, but also the cultural 
institutions of art, RELIGION, and philosophy, which he 
had classified as absolute spirit. 
Objective spirit provides the kind of overall frame-
work for Dilthey's hermeneutics that tradition carne 
to provide in HANS-GEORG GADAMER 's hermeneutics. 
But objective spirit is not as dominant as tradition is 
in Gadamer, for Dilthey articulated it into more spe-
cific Wirkungszusammenhange (systems of inftuence ), 
whether they be historical epochs or social and cul-
tural systems. This is relevant to Dilthey's distinction 
between elementary and higher understanding. The for-
mer considers an expression within the common con-
text of objective spirit. That is, the elementary under-
standing of a sentence focuses only on what it explicitly 
asserts and is commonly assumed to mean. Problems 
concerning the implicit meanings of expression caii 
for higher understanding, which requires us to refer to 
more specific systems ofinftuence. Thus we attempt to 
determine any ambiguous expressions in a legal doc-
ument by considering the particular legal system of 
the period in which it was drawn up. Only after we 
have exhausted what the appropriate public contexts 
of expressions can do to clarify their objective mean-
ing does Dilthey turn to the subjective or psychological 
context. Now psychology is no longer the first of the 
human sciences, but the last. The highest or last mode 
of understanding is the Nacherleben or reexperienc-
ing of an expression of lived experience. Of course, 
Dilthey does not expect us to reproduce the state of 
mind of the author. Hermeneutics allows us to under-
stand authors not as they understood themselves, but 
better. 
Although his hermeneutics ultimately focuses on 
the relation between lived experience, expression, and 
understanding (Erlebnis, Ausdruck, and Verstehen ), 
Dilthey admits that many expressions such as math-
ematical formulas and handshakes expressing agree-
ment can be understood apart from relating them to 
lived experience. But when an expression does artic-
ulate our lived experience, as in a work of art, it can 
enrich our understanding oflife in immeasurable ways. 
This is why Dilthey's writings on the JMAGINATION of 
artists, particularly poets, bear importantly on his the-
ory of interpretation. Like philosophers and religious 
thinkers, certain great poets also have the capacity to 
express a comprehensive wor1dview. 
One of Dilthey's last essays was on the Typen der 
Weltanschauung ( 1911 ). Because he analyzes three 
mutually exclusive types of worldview that recur -
NATURALISM, the idealism of freedom, and objective 
idealism- he is often considered a relativist. In the 
Logos essay "Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft" 
( 1911 ), Husserl quotes some passages from this essay 
that seem to 1ead Dilthey down the path of histori-
cism as well. In one of them, Dilthey uses the "de-
ve1opment ofthe historical consciousness" to question 
the universal validity of any metaphysical worldview 
claiming to comprehend conceptually how everything 
in the wor1d is interconnected. By appealing to histori-

WILHELM DILTHEY 
147 
cal consciousness, he is not, as Husserl thinks, merely 
making a factual claim about the inability ofpast spec-
ulative metaphysical systems to gain universal accep-
tance. Historical consciousness is for Dilthey a broad-
ening perspective that takes claims out of their actual 
local contexts and locates them in the sphere of uni-
versal history. It is a product ofthe Enlightenment and 
could even be considered the counterpart of the tran-
scendental point ofview. lndeed, Dilthey's stance here 
is analogous to Kant's in rejecting metaphysical spec-
ulation and is no more relativistic or historicistic than 
Kant's standpoint. Dilthey initiated a correspondence 
with Husserl to defend himself. In response Husserl 
wrote: "It truly seems to me that there are no seri-
ous differences whatsoever between us," and offered 
to publish a note in Logos to avoid any further mis-
understandings caused by his essay. Because Dilthey 
died soon thereafter (October 1, 1911 ), Husserl did not 
publish such a note. 
Dilthey's historical consciousness makes possible a 
critica! analysis of worldviews and it is this kind of 
analysis that shows that metaphysical worldviews can 
only provide us with pseudoscience. Any effort to pro-
vide a comprehensive account ofreality would have to 
synthesize the results of the natural sciences and the 
human sciences. But the approaches ofthese two kinds 
of science are so different that they cannot be synthe-
sized. Dilthey's appeal to historical consciousness is 
thus not at ali a challenge to the objective validity of 
science. It is instead an attempt to preserve the ob-
jectivity of scientific Erkenntnis. If worldviews are to 
have any value for Dilthey it is as refiective articula-
tions of the meaning of our own life-nexus as given in 
prescientific Wissen. 
The first attempts to bring Dilthey's contribu-
tions into the phenomenological tradition were made 
by LUDWJG LANDGREBE and GEORG MISCH. Landgrebe's 
"Wilhelm Diltheys Theorie der Geisteswissenschaften 
(Analyse ihre Grundbegriffe)" ( 1928) was an effort to 
reformulate the basic concepts of Dilthey's theory of 
the human sciences in light of the work of Husserl 
and Heidegger. Landgrebe stressed that Dilthey was 
never concerned with a mere theory of scientific 
methods, but used concepts such as understanding 
and meaning to provide a transcendental clarifica-
tion of the human sciences. Misch's Lebensphiloso-
phie und Phiinomenologie. Eine Auseinandersetzung 
der Diltheyschen Richtung mit Heidegger und Husserl 
(1930) explicates Dilthey's efforts to work out the cat-
egories of life as a way to show points of agreement 
and contrast with both Husserl and Heidegger.

ECOLOGY 
EDMUND HUSSERL was just seven 
years old when the German zoologist Ernst Haeckel 
( 1834--1919) coined the term Oekologie in 1866, using 
it to refer to the new science of the relations between 
the organism and its environment. The systematic sci-
entific investigation of the household of nature starts 
at approximately the same time as Western humanity 
was intervening into this household on an unprece-
dented scale with industrial mass production based on 
the extensive use of fossil fuel. Paradoxically, just as 
humanity breaks out of nature for good and starts to 
nest in a world of iron and concrete, it is completely 
reinserted into nature and its evolution by the newly 
emerging scientific disciplines of evolutionary biology 
and ecology. 
"Ecology" is also often called "environmentalism" 
because it is more than a branch of natural science. 
Only two years before Haeckel coined the term Oekolo-
gie, the American George Perkins Marsh had published 
his book Man and Nature ( 1864), a radical critique of 
the destruction ofnature by humans, ofthe unremitting 
war humanity wages against nature in its risc to civi-
lization. According to Marsh, humanity is threatening 
the balance nature has brought about between its or-
ganic and inorganic components. Nature will revenge 
itself, he predicts, with natural disasters, an unsettled 
climate, eros ion, etc. Marsh himselfwas nota scientist 
but a lawyer and politician- in today's terms, he was 
a politica! ecologist. His book became a sacred text of 
the conservation and ecology movement. 
From its very beginning, though, ecology was 
strongly motivated by pragmatic and technocratic mo-
tives. It promised new possibilities of more efficient 
use of natural systems and of an in crease in their pro-
ductivity. A classical example is the applied ecologica! 
research of the German Karl August Mobius ( 1825-
1908) into the possibilities of raising oysters along the 
German coast in Die Auster und die Austernwirtschaft 
(1877). 
Thus from its very inception, the new science ofthe 
household ofnature stands at the crossing between the 
romantically inspired revolt against the destruction of 
nature by the machine age, on the one si de, and modern 
technocratic pragmatism, on the other side. 
It was the book of a courageous woman -
Silent 
Spring by Rachel Carson ( 1907-1964)- that when it 
appeared in 1962 sparked off the present widespread 
concern called "environmentalism" that is focused on 
the "ecologica! crisis." Her book on the "elixirs of 
death," as she calls synthetic insecticides, is dedicated 
to Albert Schweitzer, whose somber forecast opens the 
book: "Man has lost the capacity to foresee and to 
forestall. He will end by destroying the earth." 
Ten years after the publication of Silent Spring, the 
first report to the Club of Rome, entitled Limits ta 
Growth, reinforced the apocalyptic message: further 
unchecked exponential growth of industrial produc-
tion, of capital, of consumption of energy and nonre-
newable resources, ofpollution, and ofpopulation will 
lead to a catastrophic breakdown of the world-system 
in the not too distant future. Since 1972, a series offur-
ther reports on the development ofthe ecologica! crisis 
have been issued based on an ever increasing amount 
of data and on ever more sophisticated mathematical 
models. The conclusion of ali of these reports is more 
or less the same: the global human household in its 
growing numbers, in its production and consumption 
patterns, in its use of nonrenewable resources, in its 
aspiration to more material growth and wealth, is eco-
logically unsustainable; in otherwords, it is on a course 
to self-destruction. 
Recently, however, politica! ecology or ecologism, 
with its critique of the destruction of nature, appears 
to be based on an outdated holistic and teleological 
paradigm of ecology that was built around the cen-
tral idea ofthe ecosystem. According to this paradigm, 
nature, if not hindered by human intervention, always 
tends toward equilibrium, harmony, stability, and order. 
A radical shift from the old ecology of order towards a 
new ecology ofnon-equilibrium and chaos has recently 
taken place. Nature, according to this new paradigm 
of ecology, is characterized by incessant and erratic 
change, constant disturbances, discontinuity, and un-
predictibility. Ifnature in itselfis chaotic, then ofcourse 
the consequences ofhuman intervention into nature can 
be regarded as less dramatic and disruptive. One irrup-

this new paradigm, causes much more environmental 
European culture, the cultural project of Europe, that 
and atmospheric disturbances than our whole global 
is in deep crisis and can be helped, if not cured, by 
industrial machine. 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER's thinking has been related to en-
vironmentalism underthe heading ofDEEP ECOLOGY and 
connections can be ma de with the work ofMAX SCHELER 
and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY as well, but at first sight, 
Husserl 's transcendental phenomenology seems of \it-
tie relevance, be it for the pressing problems of global 
environmental destruction or be it for the foundational 
problems ofthe science of ecology. There are no critica\ 
reflections in Husserl on the destructive consequences 
of large-scale intervention into and transformation of 
nature by industrial technology and production. As 
the remarkable Mensch und Erde (Man and earth, 
1913) by Ludwig Klages (1872-1956) shows, these 
dire consequences were, however, already clearly vis-
ible when Husserl published his first blueprint of tran-
scendental phenomenology, the Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 (1913). Klages complains about the global de-
struction of nature, about agricultura\ monoculture, 
about excessive urbanization, about the extirpation of 
animals and plants, and even about the harmful effects 
oftourism. 
Nor did Husserl reflect on the foundational prob-
lems of ecology. There is in general a remarkable 
omission in Husserl's theory of science of a pheno-
menological grounding of the biologica\ disciplines. 
There can be no question, then, ofturning Husserl into 
an environmental philosopher avant la lettre. However, 
since Husserl 's CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY offers a 
unique and fruitful philosophical approach to the foun-
dational problems of science as well as to the axio-
practical problems of human life, it has rich implica-
tions for the foundational problems of ecology and for 
a philosophical understanding of the ecologica\ crisis 
and environmentalism. 
It is well known that Husserl 's whole philosophy 
from its early beginnings until its very end is moti-
vated and driven by a sense of crisis and urgency. Un tii 
World War I, Husserl 's ma in concern is the founda-
tional crisis of the sciences, especially of the formal 
sciences of LOGIC and MATHEMATICS and the NATURAL 
SCIENCES, more precisely the physical sciences. The ex-
periences of the Great War and its aftermath broaden 
phenomenologically grounded HUMAN SCIENCES. 
The cultural project of Europe is the universal hu-
man project of REASON, of an enlightened life and a 
cu \ture of reason. Since reason, according to Husserl, 
comes into its own in science and philosophy, the life 
and cui ture of reason is a scientific and philosophical 
life and culture. The crisis of European culture that 
shows itself in widespread alienation, loss of purpose, 
disorientation, nihilism, and cynicism, as well as in 
violence and destruction, has its roots, according to 
Husserl, in a crisis of science and philosophy. 
Not reason and rationality as such are to blame for 
the crisis, but rather a fundamental lack of reason and 
rationality in the one-sided rationalism of modern sci-
ence. According to Husserl, there is a certain tragic 
element involved in the development of modern nat-
ural science. The impressive modern progress of nat-
ural science and scientific TECHNOLOGY is grounded in 
the mathematization, the specialization, and the tech-
nical method ofresearch. But exactly these conditions 
of success are responsible for a dangerous blindness, 
a lack of rationality in modern science and technol-
ogy. The ultimate foundation of this blindness is, ac-
cording to his diagnosis, NATURALISM and objectivism. 
What modern science takes tobe objective nature puri-
fied from ali subjective appearances and apperceptions, 
ali values and purposes, are only mathematical ideal-
izations and constructions. Ali scientific theories and 
models, as well as the technical devices built with their 
help, are rooted in the LIFEWORLD and its primordial 
nature. 
Thus the first step toward a lasting solution to the 
crisis of European science and cui ture is the rediscov-
ery ofthe lifeworld as that which grounds and encom-
passes the sciences and their idealizations. A theory 
and phenomenological foundation of science has to 
start with an ontology of the lifeworld, a descriptive 
account of its essential characteristics. The lifeworld 
as the world of our everyday life is a historical and 
cultural world. Its a world of natural and of artificial, 
human-made objects, of real objects, like trees, chairs, 
animals, and people, and of ideal objects like works of 
art and scientific theories, but above ali it is a world 
of human, cultural MEANING. There is nothing in the 

150 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
lifeworld that does not ha ve human meaning. The life-
world is an eminently axio-practical world, a world of 
human interest. 
The lifeworld encompasses nature as that which is 
not human-made but which is nevertheless clothed with 
and soaked in human meaning. Lifeworldly nature is 
not yet the abstract, objective nature of mathematical 
natural science, but it is an abstract layer of our con-
crete lifeworldly experience. It is the first nature out 
ofwhich we matured into the second nature ofhuman 
culture. What we witness today as a global ecologi-
ca! crisis is the destruction of our biologically natural 
lifeworld and, together with it, the destruction of the 
naturallifeworlds of countless other species. Following 
Husserl 's diagnosis, we can say that these naturallife-
worlds are ultimately destroyed by ontologica! neglect. 
The prevailing naturalist and objectivist ontology that 
regards the mathematical abstractions and idealizations 
of modern physics as the only true objective reality le-
gitimates the project of a radical transformation of our 
lifeworldly nature into a technosphere, which would 
be a cultural lifeworld on a par with the lifeless and 
unintuitive world of mathematical science. But is not 
the nature we encounter biologica! before the physical 
nature is extracted from it? 
The return to the lifeworld and the threefold dis-
tinction between the concrete historical-cultural life-
world, its underlying lifeworldly nature, and the ide-
alizations of mathematical natural science is the first 
important step toward breaking the speli of the reduc-
tionist paradigm of naturalism and objectivism. Nature 
and culture, first and second nature, both have to be 
saved from the destructive grasp of this paradigm and 
its material manifestation in the form oftechnological 
expansion and technocracy. 
The return to the lifeworld, however, must not be un-
derstood in the sense oflife philosophy, i.e., as a return 
to irrational life as opposed to reason and rationality. 
The return to the lifeworld is rather an intermediate 
step toward a radical renewal of science, reason, and 
cultural Iife. For Husserl there is no way back to a 
prescientific religious or mythical rootedness. It is true 
that positivist science and its technology has deprived 
us of an overall sense of meaning and purpose, alien-
ating us from ourselves, from each other, from history 
and tradition, and from nature. But to overcome this 
alienation we do not need new gods or goddesses to 
sa ve us, but a radical critique and renewal ofreason and 
science in the form of a rigourous scientific philosophy. 
The lifeworld is not an objective, but a subject-
relative world. The historical-culturallifeworld is rela-
tive to the cultural practices ofhumans in their different 
communities, cultures, and traditions. These practices 
include acts ofknowledge and of evaluation as well as 
volitions and practica! acts. Our primordially natural 
lifeworld is relative to the need-structured perceptions 
and behavior of humans as natural beings; in other 
words, it is what ecologists caii an environment, but 
with the recognition that environments always already 
have values and purposes in them for animals, humans 
included. It can even be asked whether in this stratum 
oflife ali things in nature are animate, so that there are 
thus rudimentary intersubjectivities discernible there 
too. 
A universal and rigorous scientific philosophy pre-
supposes, according to Husserl, a radical subjective 
turn. Such a turn consists in attending to and giving a 
descriptive account ofthe constitution ofworldly being 
in ali the different forms it takes in the acts and concate-
nations ofacts of transcendental consciousness. This is 
achieved by the method of a transcendental EPOCHE ANO 
REDUCTION that opens up the new field of research of 
transcendental-constitutive phenomenology, the radi-
cal and universal science of transcendental conscious-
ness in which the world and ali sciences of it, ecology 
clearly included, can be grounded. 
The bracketing and reduction of the world and of 
worldly being includes my human selfthat lives in this 
world, my world-life. The newly discovered realm of 
transcendental consciousness is a non-worldly subjec-
tivity, which, however, includes everything worldly, its 
own worldliness included, as a senseformation, an ap-
perceptive stratum or a capacity arising out of its con-
stitutive performances. Ultimate rational justification 
of our theoretical, axiologica!, and practica! position-
takings can only be achieved by and in the frame-
work of patient, detailed, and diligent transcendental-
constitutive analysis. 
The present ecologica! crisis is a crisis in the rela-
tionship between human eul ture and nonhuman nature. 
What used tobe only patches ofhuman eul ture in a vast 
surrounding miii eu ofwild nature has become a kind of 
planetary crust of material and immaterial human arti-
facts and activities with wilderness areas within it. The 

ECOLOGY 
151 
different historical-cultural lifeworlds are merging into 
one global industrial lifeworld, the capitalist-industrial 
world-city. In the near future, this world-city will be 
inhabited by at least ten billion mostly young people 
who will almost all aspire to well-paid jobs, mobility, 
and a high material standard of living. Only partially 
to fulfill these aspirations, if it is even possible, would 
require a sharp further increase in the consumption of 
renewable and nonrenewable natural resources. The 
human species would have to colonize and exploit as 
effi.ciently as possible all land, water, and air, as well 
as everything that lives on and in it. Life forms that are 
of no use to the reproduction and growth of our human 
numbers and to the fulfillment of our aspirations have 
to go. A few ofthem may be kept in zoos or their genes 
stored in gene banks for possible fu ture use. 
lfthis course ofthe development ofhuman culture 
is taken for granted, then the ecologica! crisis seems 
nothing more than a technical problem pertaining to 
the maxima! sustainable exploitation of the earth 's re-
sources. This, in fact, is the ecologica! crisis defined 
in terms of modem science and technology. What is 
the carrying capacity of the earth and how can this 
carrying capacity be maximized by technology? How 
many people can live on earth with such and such a 
level of material consumption? Because of the enor-
mous amounts of data that have to be gathered and 
processed as well as the complexify of the equations 
involved, answers to these questions will be, for the 
foreseeable future, only preliminary and highly con-
troversial. 
There is a widespread feeling, however, that the 
ecologica! crisis is more than a scientific and techno-
logical problem, that it rather confronts us with fun-
damental questions about ourselves as humans, about 
our destiny in the larger scheme of cosmic and natural 
evolution, about our responsibilities toward the non-
human other, about our genuine aspirations, and about 
the essential ingredients of a good, fulfilled, and re-
warding human life. We are, it seems, at the threshold 
o fan unrestricted one-dimensional utilitarian approach 
to nonhuman nature. The question is whether the fur-
ther self-realization and self-perfection ofhumankind, 
the becoming more fully human, requires that we cross 
this threshold or whether by crossing it we shall rather 
destroy ourselves- if not physically, then spiritually 
and morally. 
Husserl's transcendental phenomenology offers a 
fruitful philosophical approach to these questions. The 
critique of modem mathematical natural science and 
the return to the underlying lifeworld and its historical-
cultural and ecological-natural aspects are the first 
steps. The radically subjective turn to transcendental 
consciousness as constituting the entirety of worldly 
being opens up the ultimate ground on which these 
questions can be precisely articulated and, by way of a 
careful constitutive analysis, can find an answer. 
Does the intuitive and descriptive transcendental-
constitutive analysis point then to a different view 
of the relationship between human culture and na-
ture than the utilitarian resource view? Is nature in 
a transcendental-constitutive perspective more than an 
externa] object of use, exploitation, or touristic attrac-
tion? The self-mundanization of transcendental sub-
jects, the constitution of other persons and of com-
munities of persons, and the constitution of the life-
world, including the constitution oflifewordly ecolog-
ica! nature, form an intrinsic and inseparable unity. For 
Husserl, however, the tel os of transcendental life and 
constitution is spiritual self-perfection, which leads to 
the rule of reason in individual and common life and 
which has its objective correlate in a cui ture of genuine 
truth, beauty, and goodness. What is the place and ro le 
ofnature in this process of self- and world-perfection? 
Husserl 's !ater analyses of constitution and reason 
show that transcendentallife is suffused by analogous 
forms of empathy, trust, respect, and love. Spiritual 
self-perfection is more than intellectual self-perfection. 
It must rather be conceived as a kind ofharmonious and 
integrated perfection of our transcendental-spiritual 
faculties, in particular of the mind and the heart, of 
reason and love. Conscious life is then at once and in-
seperably an intellectual, an appreciative, an empathic, 
a respectful, and a loving relationship to its object. 
The community of reason is a community of love, the 
cui ture of reason is a cu !ture of love. This means that 
the life of spirit cannot ftourish in dis trust, disrespect, 
and hate, nor on heartless utilitarian calculation and 
neglect. Nature then is not originally constituted as 
mere substrate and resource for the economic and cul-
tural activities ofhumankind, nor does the teleological 
vector in this primordial constitution point to such a 
purely utilitarian relationship in the community and 
culture ofreason. This transcendental-constitutive and 

152 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
te1eological conception of human growth and matura-
tion and the corresponding concept ofworld-formation 
will therefore be critica! ofthe further expansion ofthe 
industrial-capitalist world-city, which can hardly form 
such a community ofreason and love. 
To sum up: Husserl 's transcendental-constitutive 
phenomenology offers a unique approach and method 
for reftecting on the metaphysical, ethical, anthro-
pological, axiologica!, epistemological, and socio-
economic implications of the ecologica! crisis. lts cri-
tique of modern mathematical natural science and the 
return to the li feworld are of great significance for the 
foundational problems of ecology, in particular the de-
termination and delimitation of that science's proper 
research field and method. Further constitutive anal-
ysis will help to clarify its fundamental concepts as 
well as reveal their tacit, often ideologica!, presup-
positions. Like ali sciences, the science or sciences 
of ecology, and beyond them, environmentalism will 
ultimately receive their systematic place in the teleo-
logical ecology of transcendental subjectivity and its 
adventurous odyssey to our true home, a community 
and world of reason and !o ve. Transcendental pheno-
menology may help us to resist the powerful song of 
the sirens with its false promises of freedom, comfort, 
and wealth in the capitalist-industrial world-city. What 
has been sketched here, though, is hardly more than 
an outline that has tobe fi !led in by extensive, system-
atic, concrete, and detailed transcendental-constitutive 
analyses.

Phenomenologists have always 
shown a strong interest in the social or HUMAN SCIENCES. 
EDMUND HUSSERL was of course greatly concerned with 
PSYCHOLOGY and sought to lay the groundwork for a 
phenomenological psychology. Inspired by Husserl's 
phenomenology, ALFRED scHUTZ devoted the greater 
part ofhis energies to founding a phenomenological so-
CIOLOGY, i.e., a phenomenology ofthe sociallifeworld 
(Lebensweft). In France, MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY ap-
pJied Husserlian insights to a wide range ofhuman dis-
ciplines, including psychology, linguistics, sociology, 
and ETHNOLOGY. Leaders ofHERMENEUTICAL PHENOMEN-
OLOGY SUCh as HANS-GEORG GADAMER and PAUL RICCEUR 
have also devoted much oftheir attention to the human 
sciences. In fact, phenomenological hermeneutics as 
they ha ve defined it is essentially a philosophy of the 
human sciences. Only recently, however, has the sci-
ence of economics become a subject of major interest 
for phenomenological hermeneutics. The attempt cur-
rently under way at working out a "hermeneutica! eco-
nomics" is nevertheless not without historical prece-
dent. Although it carne to fui! fruition only recently, 
an exchange between phenomenology and economics 
dates back to the earlier decades ofthis century. 
It is interesting to note that this earlier exchange was 
a genuinely two-way con versation between economists 
and phenomenological philosophers. The linkages are 
complex and of different degrees of intimacy and im-
portance, and remain stil! to be explored in a thor-
oughgoing fashion. Key interlocutors in this multi-
faceted conversation included ALFRED SCHUTZ and FE-
LIX KAUFMANN and, on the economics side, Ludwig 
von Mises (1881-1973), Friedrich A. Hayek (1899-
1992), and Fritz Mach lup ( 1902-1983). The conver-

sation centered largely on (in Hayek's words) "the 
method and philosophical character of the social sci-
ences," the stage for this discussion having been set 
by the HERMENEUTICS of WILHELM DILTHEY, the verste-
hende method ofMAX WEBER, and the subjective theory 
of value first advanced by Cari Menger ( 1840-1921 ), 
the founder ofwhat came tobe known as the Austrian 
school of economics. 
Schutz was a pivotal figure in this complex con-
versation concerning the status ofthe human sciences, 
which unfolded during the 1920s. Before the publica-
tion ofhis first work, Der sinnhafte Aufhau der sozialen 
Welt ( 1932), Schutz had in fact studied economics in 
Vienna with Mises and Friedrich von Wieser (1851-
1926), two leading members of the Austrian school 
of economics, both ofwhom were likewise teachers of 
Hayek, who was to become the foremost representative 
ofthis school ofthought in the early 1930s. Although a 
great many ofthe details concerning their relationship 
remain yet to be clarified, it is a matter of record that 
Schutz and Hayek (both of whom received their Dr. 
juris degree at Vienna in 1921) were in close personal 
contact during the 1920s (they both participated on a 
regular basis in the informal discussion group known 
as the Mises-Kreis). One of Schutz's major concerns 
at the time was to provide Austrian economics with a 
suitable philosophical foundation. 
The fact remains, however, that for whatever rea-
son, there are only passing references to Schutz in 
Hayek's writings (he also refers in passing to Husserl 
and Merleau-Ponty). In any event, the philosophical 
horizon of Hayek's own work underwent a general 
shift after his move to England in 1932 (Schutz em-
igrated to the United States in 1939). The contextual 
shift away from phenomenologicallyoriented or "Con-
tinental" philosophy on Hayek's part to Anglo-Saxon 
modes ofthinking was no doubt to a significant extent 
a consequence of the clase association that developed 
in London between Hayek and a fellow Austrian ex-
patriate, Karl Popper ( 1902-1994 ), himself no friend 
of phenomenology (Hayek's endorsement of Poppe-
rian philosophy of science was objected to by LUDWIG 
M. LACHMANN). Although for his part Schutz frequently 
refers to economics, as we11 as, on occasion, to Hayek, 
his published writings contain no systematic treatment 
of economic matters ( even though he pursued a lifelong 
career as a specialist in international banking law), and 
this is perhaps yet another reason why ~ 
unlike, for in-
stance, psychology or sociology~ economics did not 
succeed in capturing the fu11 attention of phenome-
nologists. Thus this first encounter between pheno-
menology and economics in the persons principally 
of Schutz and Hayek did not, at the time, produce any 
lasting results. After an initial frequentation, the two 
disciplines drifted apart, just as in the prewar years, 
Schutz and Hayek themselves drifted from their com-
mon home in Vienna, the one to America, the other to 
England. 
It may be noted as well that this rendezvous manque 
between Husserlian phenomenology and Austrian eco-
nomics coincided not only with the diaspora of Central 
European intellectuals characteristic of the 1930s, but 
also with the beginning of a swift decline in prestige of 
the Austrian school of economics itself. In economics, 
positivism was on the rise, and the objectivism (as 
Husserl would ha ve called it) characteristic of the in-
creasingly popular mathematical and formalistic ap-
proach to economic issues was soon totally to eclipse 
the "subjective" or phenomenological approach advo-
cated by Austrian economics. Although in the 1940s 
Hayek mounted a valiant (albeit rear-guard) attack on 
what he called the "scientism" and "physicalism" (cf. 
Husserl's NATURALISM) that was becoming so fashion-
able in the discipline, his criticisms fell on deaf ears at 
the time. 
In an attempt to transform economics into a "hard" 
science, economists had resolutely hitched their dis-
cipline to the rising star of purely instrumental, cal-
culative rationality, to Paretian modeling techniques 
and general equilibrium analysis ~ 
to which a pheno-
menological type of orientation could, by the nature 
of things, have nothing positive to contribute. Un-
like phenomenology (also of Austrian origin, it may 
be recalled, insofar as Husserl was born in Habsburg 
Moravia), which found a new homeland and a renewed 
life in America, Austrian economics pretty much died 
in exile in England. (Hayek's subsequent fame was 
based not on his original contributions to the method-
ology of economics as a human science ~ 
these were 
altogether ignored by the economics establishment, his 
Nobel Prize in 1974 notwithstanding ~but, like Mii-
ton Friedman, for instance, on his more politica! or 
"ideologica!" views, often, though erroneously, taken 
to be of a conservative or "right-wing" nature.) It is 

154 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
tempting to wonder ifHayek might not ha ve succeeded 
in articulating his critique of scientistic objectivism 
(and his defense of an alternative methodology for eco-
nomics) in a philosophically more forceful manner had 
he cultivated his phenomenological contacts more as-
siduously (this seems to have been Lachmann's view). 
Be that as it may, Hayek was to some extent vin-
dicated when in 1989 socialism collapsed on a grand 
scale in Eastern Europe- as he had long predicted it 
inevitably must (Hayek died in 1992 but, due to fail-
ing health, was apparently not able to appreciate the 
magnitude ofthe dramatic events taking place around 
him). Hayek's concrete policy recommendations are 
now looked to as guiding principles in the economic 
and social restructuring of former Communis! coun-
tries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, 
and even the former Soviet Un ion itself, while those of 
his erstwhile victorious rival, John Maynard Keynes 
(1883~ 1946), ha ve, along with Marxism, been con-
signed to the dustbin of history. While these develop-
ments amount to a belated recognition of the valid-
ity of Hayek 's economic views, they do not of them-
selves amount to a recognition of the philosophical 
significance of Austrian economics considered from a 
methodological point of view (i.e., from the point of 
view ofthe philosophy ofthe social sciences). 
On the methodological level, mainstream eco-
nomics continues to adhere to the positivist ideal and to 
view itselfas a would-be science in the Galilean, math-
ematized sense that Husserl spoke of in Die Krisis der 
europiiischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale 
Phiinomenologie ( 1936 ). Given this situation, it is not 
surprising that, the earlier encounter between pheno-
menology and economics notwithstanding, phenome-
nologists to date have not been greatly motivated to 
elaborate a phenomenology ofthe economic lifeworld 
(parallel to that ofthe sociallifeworld). On the face of 
it, economics in its present state would seem to have 
precious little to do with human reality (the proper 
object of phenomenology). Increasingly, however, in 
the wake ofthe breakdown ofthe Keynesian synthesis, 
mainstream economics is finding itselfin methodologi-
cal disarray. Indeed, the beginnings (however small) of 
a postpositivist or "interpretive" (i.e., hermeneutica!) 
turn in the discipline are becoming visible. The time is 
thus ripe for a renewed dialogue between phenomen-
ology and economics. 
Such a dialogue is in fact already under way- and 
on a renewed methodological hasis. What could be 
called the second encounter between economics and 
phenomenology centers no longer, as in the case of 
Schutz, on the philosophy of science dominant earlier 
in this century (and reflected as much in Husserlianism 
as in logica! positivism) buton the postmodern philos-
ophy of the social sciences elaborated by HERMENEU-
TIC AL PHENOMENOLOGY. it was initiated by LUDWIG M. 
LACHMANN, who also played a major ro le in the revival 
of Austrian economics in the United States that began 
in the early 1970s. After leaving Germany in 1933 fol-
lowing Hitler's ascension to power, Lachmann stud-
ied with Hayek at the London School of Economics 
and subsequently taught in Johannesburg until his re-
tirement in 1972. From 1975 to 1987 he was then a 
visiting professor at New York University, and it was 
there that he introduced a new generation of Ameri-
can economists to the (by then) forgotten phenomen-
ological background of Austrian economics, Schutz in 
particular. 
Among this generation ofyoungereconomists, ooN 
LAVOIE of George Mason University has been espe-
cially active in fostering an interchange between Aus-
trian economics and hermeneutica! phenomenology, 
and a number ofyounger economists trained at George 
Mason (e.g., PETER BOETTKE, STEVEN HORWITZ, DAVID 
PRYCHITKO, and RALF RECTOR) ha ve deve]oped the philo-
sophica] dialogue even further. This renewed encounter 
between economics and phenomenology on the part 
of a younger generation of scholars was, as it were, 
made official when in 1986 Lavoie, under the aus-
pices of the Center for the Study of Market Processes, 
organized a conference at George Mason University 
on economics and hermeneutics (lnterpretation, Hu-
man Agency, and Economics, 1990) to which both 
economists and philosophers were invited. 
One of the points stressed by Lachmann in the 
"Hermeneutics Club" he organized while at New York 
University was the need for economists to give care-
fui consideration to, as he put it, "general ideas" -
over and beyond the standard requirements of the dis-
cipline of mastery in formalized, quantitative measur-
ing techniques. (While adept at measuring this or that 
economic parameter, most students graduating in eco-
nomics would be hard put to explain exactly what it 
is that they are supposed to be measuring in the first 

ECONOMICS 
155 
place, i.e., just what an "economy" is.) From the point 
of view of the phenomenological philosophy of eco-
nomics, the most "general" of ideas in this regard is 
no doubt that of"objectivism," the critique thereof and 
the alternatives thereto. 
In its present state, economics is, as was mentioned 
above, very much of a (would-be) Galilean, mathema-
tized science, a purely objectivistic discipline oblivious 
to its foundations in lived experience and the realm 
of human praxis (the lifeworld). Indeed, ever since 
the 19th century economists, in the pursuit of what 
in the Krisis Husserl termed "abstraction" and "ide-
alization," have sought to model their discipline af-
ter physics (whence the "physicalism" denounced by 
Hayek), seeking to make of economics a kind of so-
cial physics, a Newtonian mechanics ofhuman affairs. 
Since Menger first articulated his "subjective theory 
of value" in 1871, however, Austrian economists ha ve 
defended, in opposition to ali forms of scientistic ob-
jectivism, what they refer to as "subjectivism." This 
was a properly phenomenological move on their part 
(having, it should be noted, little or nothing to do with 
the "subjectivism" denounced !ater on by phenomen-
ology). 
Austrian "subjectivism" (though sometimes misun-
derstood by defenders and opponents alike) is essen-
tially of a Husserlian sort, in that it insists that in order 
to be understood properly, value (the key concept of 
economics) must not be viewed as something "natu-
ral," an inherent property of goods considered from a 
merely objective or naturalistic point ofview; "value" 
is rather something "constituted" by human subjects, 
or, to speak somewhat more in the manner of EXIS-
TENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY, it is the byproduct ofhuman 
action (Mises called his majorphilosophical-economic 
treatise Human Action [ 1933]). More specifically, Aus-
trian "subjectivism" views value as the expression of 
preferences on the part of individual subjects, ofthe sat-
isfaction they expect to derive from the incremental use 
of goods; this "subjective" theory ofvalue was the form 
in which Menger for his part articulated the famous 
"marginalist revolution" in economics effected simul-
taneously in 1871 by him, Leon Walras (1834-1910), 
and William Stanley Jevons ( 1835-1882), which inau-
gurated what is now referred to as neoclassical eco-
nomics. 
It is above ali in their respective methodological 
critiques of objectivism that Austrian economics and 
phenomenology come together in a kind of natural 
symbiosis. The kindred nature ofthese two disciplines 
does not stop there, however. Both set forth alterna-
tive approaches of a "positive" sort to both the theory 
and the practice of the human sciences, economics in 
particular, and these are congruent to a remarkable de-
grec. Ifphenomenological hermeneutics is defined, in a 
Gadamerian fashion, as a general theory ofhuman un-
derstanding in ali its various forms (i.e., as a universal 
theory of understanding), Austrian economics for its 
part could be said tobe a theory ofhuman understand-
ing as it manifests itself in that realm called the "eco-
nomic." And the theory of economic understanding it 
sets forth is itself hermeneutica! in the most proper 
sense ofthe term. To speak like Husserl, economics as 
practiced by the "Austrians" amounts to nothing less 
than a "regional" hermeneutics. Or, as Lavoie puts it, 
"Austrian economics is the hermeneutica! mode of neo-
classical economics." In what follows an attempt will 
accordingly be made to delineate some of the main 
characteristic issues and themes of a "hermeneutica! 
economics." 
The hermeneutica! task in regard to economics is no 
different from what it is in regard to ali other realms 
of human activity, from the production of texts to the 
generation of cultural forms of life. In ali such in-
stances hermeneutics sets itself the task of explicat-
ing (interpreting) the "logic" of the order in question 
(text, culture, economy). For hermeneutics, an "econ-
omy" is not, as neoclassical economics seeks to view 
it, a self-contained realm (a "system") of determinate, 
cause-and-effect relations subsisting somehow inde-
pendently of flesh-and-blood human beings and ex-
plainable in purely "objective" terms (cf. the analysis 
oftexts in STRUCTURALISM). Economics, it insists, ought 
tobe viewed not as an empirica! (by which economists 
usually mean "statistica!") science in search of nomo-
logicallaw, but as a human science in search of general 
patterns of existential meaning (an "economy" being 
nothing other than a web of significance spun by act-
ing human beings in their day-to-day dealings with one 
another). 
The proper object of a hermeneutica! or interpreti ve 
economics is market processes, viewed as an expres-
sion of human subjectivity and agency. Hermeneuti-
ca! economics maintains that the logic of market pro-

156 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
cesses that it seeks to explicate is not an instance of in-
strumental, means-end or technological rationality (as 
mainstream economics -
as well as Frankfurt CRITI-
CAL THEORY- views it). The order that characterizes 
a market economy as a whole is not (as in the case 
of intra-economic entities such as the firm) the resul! 
ofplanning (technological or instrumental rationality); 
rather, it is what Hayek called a "spontaneous order," 
i.e., one that is the self-generated outcome of indepen-
dent action on the part of a myriad of human agents, 
each seeking to better his or her own life (this, it could 
be said in a Rica:urian fashion, is the "existential" ba-
sis of economic reality) and interacting through market 
exchanges, themselves viewed on the model of what 
hermeneutics calls communicative understanding or 
rationality. (As Hayek would say, an "economy" is not 
a constructed order, a taxis, but a "catallaxy.") 
This means hermeneutics insists- in opposition to 
mainstream, positivistic economics (see, for instance, 
Lachmann, The Market as an Economic Process, 1986) 
-
that the activity of economic agents is thoroughly 
misunderstood when it is viewed solely on the model 
of homo economicus (a robot-like entity that, as in 
standard rational expectations theory, is nothing more 
than a calculating utility maximizer). In its attempt to 
elaborate an economics having as its foca) point not the 
rationalist construct "economic man," but the actually 
existing human subject, moving about (as Merleau-
Ponty would say) not in the ideal world ofneoclassical 
economics, arbitrarily defined as one ofperfectly com-
petitive market equilibrium, but in the real world as 
described by EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY, one ofrisk, 
uncertainty, and ignorance, hermeneutica) economics 
signals the death of "economic man" Uust as pheno-
menology itself signals the death ofthe Cartesian sub-
ject). 
Hermeneutics insists that market processes are best 
viewed on the model ofhuman LANGUAGE, as a kind of 
dialogue or con versation in the Gadamerian sense. The 
unique feature of a market or self-regulating economy 
(a "spontaneous order") is that prices, as established by 
the give-and-take offree trade, communicate cssential 
information to economic agents, "telling" them, in ef-
fect, how best to allocate their limited resourccs. That 
self-organizing, intersubjective order that is an "econ-
omy" is what MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY called an "inter-
worJd;" it is also a kind of"soov" and is like Merleau-
Ponty's "lived body" (corps propre) in that it too is 
synergic and possesses a spontaneite enseignante, one 
that speaks in the language of prices. Prices are there-
fore a form of embodied meaning (meaning, it will 
be recalled, is the essential object of any phenomen-
ological analysis); prices represent, as Merleau-Ponty 
again would say, a kind of objective logos. In contrast 
to technological-instrumental rationality, however, the 
economic MEANINGS conveyed by prices (the knowl-
edge that prices communicate about the saleability of 
commodities and other valuations attached to them 
by consumers) are not "theoretical" but "practica!." 
That is, they are inextricably embedded in economic 
praxis itself and are thus, like Merleau-Ponty's percep-
luai meanings, never fully thematizable (this forms the 
philosophical basis for hermeneutics' rejection of the 
idea of central planning). The "message ofthe market-
place" is, as Merleau-Ponty would say, a "meaning that 
is not the work of a universal constituting conscious-
ness, a meaning that clings to certain contents." The 
economic world itself is, to borrow yet another phrase 
from Merleau-Ponty, "a system of meanings whose 
reciprocities, relationships and involvements do not 
require tobe made explicit in order tobe exploited." 
Hermeneutica! economics provides an answer to the 
central problem of market economics, viz., coOJ·dina-
tion, by showing how-out ofthe multifarious activity 
of a myriad of independent agents, each pursuing his or 
her own ends in a world of Merleau-Pontyan ambigu-
ity and hermeneutica! uncertainty- an order emerges 
("spontaneously") that, while manifestly the result of 
human agency, is also, as Hayek ever insisted, not the 
result of human design (resembling in this way tex-
tual meaning as hermeneutics understands it, i.e., in 
a nonpsychologistic fashion). Hermeneutics views the 
market as a unique and irreplaceable means for dis-
covering knowledge, knowledge that, paradoxical as it 
might sound, does not preexist its discovery (this des-
ignates a problem that, in its general forms, greatly pre-
occupied Merleau-Ponty; it is likewise what "Austri-
ans" refer to as a "creative discovery procedure"). This 
is what leads hermeneutica! economists to concentrate 
much oftheir attention on the role ofthe entrepreneur, 
conceived of, phenomenologically, as o ne instantiation 
ofthe "acting person." A task remaining tobe accom-
plished in this regard is that of a full-fledged pheno-
menological analysis of entrepreneurship, for which

the work ofMerleau-Ponty could serve as an extremely 
valuable source of philosophical inspiration. 
More generally, a wealth of fascinating research 
projects- ones having to do with the real-world situ-
ation of economic actors and with the institutions and 
spontaneous orders of ali sorts that emerge in a civil or 
self-regulating society as the sedimented outcome of 
interactive human agency (extending even to issues in 
ECOLOGY)- has been opened up by the renewed en-
counter between phenomenological hermeneutics and 
Austrian economics. It is tobe hoped that this particular 
conversation will not, like the earlier one, be allowed 
to lapse but that, to the contrary, it will continue to 
grow and to deepen, contributing thereby to the ad-
vancement of both a genuinely humanistic economics 
and a truly universal hermeneutics.

EDUCATION

Phenomenological theories of 
education have not so far achieved a consistent def-
inition of their methodology and basic concepts. Not 
only do these theories originate from different philoso-
phies, but their guiding questions and procedures are 
diverse and sometimes contradictory. On the one hand, 
this explains the difficulties of any attempt at a com-
prehensive account ofthese theories, and on the other 
hand, this is also the reason why phenomenological 
theories of education are open and flexible enough to 
draw upon a variety oftraditions and to co-opera te with 
other disciplines. 
Phenomenological thinking in pedagogy cannot be 
described as a homogeneous movement. The begin-
nings, which date back to the first decades of our cen-
tury, can be found in the works of ALOYS FISCHER and 
RUDOLF LOCHNER, who were mainly influenced by the 
early philosophy of EDMUND HUSSERL. They outlined a 
descriptive pedagogy or pedagogy as a factual science 
(Tatsachenwissenschaft). Pedagogy is to be modeled 
on philosophy as strict science (strenge Wissenschaft). 
Strict science in its turn refers to a scientific ethos 
allegedly at work in disciplines such as physics. Edu-
cation is to be described as far as possible without any 
prej udices so that its essential characteristics can be 
defined in a complete and well-ordered fashion. This 
ambitious attempt to provide a consistent basis for ali

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
approaches within pedagogy by the help of EIDETIC 
descriptions did not succeed in forming a specifically 
phenomenological tradition. Only empirically oriented 
approaches within pedagogy received fruitful stimuli 
from this program. 
Occasionally the inftuence of phenomenology can 
be found in the so-called human scientific pedagogy, 
among others in the works of Friedrich Copei ( 1902-
1945) and Theodor Litt ( 1880--1962). This "geisteswis-
senschaftliche Piidagogik" developed under the in-
ftuence of WILHELM DILTHEY and his disciple Herman 
Nohl (1879-1960). Litt admired the way phenomen-
ology could convey pure forms of ideas and of life as 
such. He is mainly inftuenced by Husserl's method. 
Copei takes up the phenomenological retrieval and 
revalorization of the sta tus of lifeworldly experiences 
insofar as lifeworldly experience forms the hasis for 
scientific knowledge. He interprets the processes of 
education, learning, and self-realization as the history 
of the crises in the experience of concrete individu-
als. These crises are caused by the conflict between 
LIFEWORLD experience and scientific analysis, e.g., the 
altitude one has to climb to reach a mountain top differs 
from the altitude's mathematical definition. The pheno-
menological way of thinking enables one to bring to 
light the opinions and the taken-for-granted options 
on which not only our everyday but also our scien-
tific knowledge rests. The phenomenological way of 
thinking can thus be compared to the Socratic maieu-
tic. Those who take part in a Platonic dialogue become 
aware of their habits of thinking through failures on 
problems they were sure they would be able to solve. 
One achieves a new perspective not only on the world, 
but also on oneself. 
The affinities ofthis elevation ofthe status ofpresci-
entific ways of experiencing to a popular theory of"Bil-
dung" related to Nazi ideology had fatal consequences. 
One of these was a reactionary aversion to science. 
Only after World War II did some phenomenological 
theories within pedagogy attract more than temporary 
attention. Following mainJy MARTIN HEIDEGGER's Sein 
und Zeit ( 1927), OTTO FRIEDRICH BOLLNOW worked on 
an anthropological and pedagogica! theory with un-
derpinnings in EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY. He tried 
to draw attention to dimensions of education -
e.g., 
the so-called "pedagogica! atmosphere"- that are not 
accessible to scientific procedures. That is to say he un-
dertook to elaborate on the "geisteswissenschaftliche" 
tradition of pedagogy via phenomenological analyses 
of experience, SPACE, TIME, moods, and concrete inter-
active communication. Some of Bollnow's disciples 
thematized education as a process in which one in-
evitably undergoes crises, and which is therefore partly 
uncontrollable and cannot be projected (JAKOB MUTH). 
Others thematized the problems of a context-bound 
identity (FRIEDMANN MAURER). A third group thematized 
the event-character (ereignishaft) of the encounter be-
tween educator and pupi!. 
The phiJosophers HEINRICH ROM BACH and EUGEN FINK 
developed an independent phenomenological peda-
gogy. Rombach focused on ontologica! structures in 
order to overcome the traditional metaphysics of sub-
stance. He was inftuenced by Heidegger's critique of 
the metaphysics of subjectivity. According to Rom-
bach, pedagogy is to thematize the human being as a 
person, as a structural unity of the fundamental pos-
sibilities of DASEIN. Following Husserl and Heidegger, 
Fink mainly looked into the co-existential characteris-
tics of pedagogica! acts. According to him, education 
has to be considered a primordial phenomenon of so-
cial and human praxis. It is of the same sta tus as !o ve 
and death, power, and labor, and cannot be derived 
from other phenomena. Pedagogy becomes a doctrine 
for life (Lebens/ehre) that picks up and reftects the 
sense produced by a concrete communicative praxis 
interpreted as a deliberative community (Beratungsge-
meinschaft). 
Following in Fink's footsteps, EGON scHOTz works 
on an existential-critica! pedagogy. The focus is on 
the existential relationship to Being within formative 
processes. This existential relationship to being is char-
acterized by historicity, by the importance of the BODY, 
and above ali by LANGUAGE. Moreover, it conveys a 
perspective in which freedom and REASON appear as 
paradoxical potentialities. The fundamental relation-
ship to Being of the human being can be called para-
doxical because the impossibilities of absolute freedom 
and of completely transparent reason together entail a 
concrete praxis permeated by reason and freedom. This 
paradoxical situation indicates human finitude. This re-
striction is brought about by the resistance ofthe things 
dealt with and above ali by coexistence with others. 
In working out the philosophical hasis of his peda-
gogy THEODOR BALLAUFF draws upon Heidegger's crit-

EDUCATION 
159 
ical reflections concern ing the sta tus of the subject in 
order to ward off an overrating of the self in the de-
scription of pedagogica! acts. Any pretensions to have 
thought or the self at one's sovereign command are 
rejected sharply. Hence pedagogica! action becomes 
risky; although it can prepare for the event of think-
ing, it cannot produce it voluntarily. Ballauff's disciple 
KLAUS SCHALLER also develops his pedagogy of com-
munication on the basis, among other influences, of 
phenomenological ideas. The concrete intersubjective 
production of sense relativizes the dominant ro le ofthe 
educator and concedes an important degree of partic-
ipation to the pupi!. Schaller also received influences 
from .lAN PATOCKA and BERNHARD WALDENFELS that led 
him to attribute an original potentiality to the concrete 
processcs of communication, a potentiality that is ca-
pable oftransforming traditional patterns of communi-
cation. 
Existential-phenomenological ideas are particularly 
influential in pedagogica! thinking, e.g., in souTH 
AFRICA (CAREL KRUGEL OBERHOLZER), Brazii (PAULO 
FREIRE), SPAIN (JOAN-CARLES MELICH), and in the UNITED 
STATES (DAVID E. DENTON, CLINTON COLLINS, and MAX-
INE GREENE). The reception of the phenomenology of 
JEAN-PAUL SARTRE focuses on the dimension of free-
dom in human existence. It emphasizes the ultimate 
autonomy ofthe human being. On this basis the peda-
gogica! reformer Freire criticizes cultural colonization 
and approaches that conceive of education as monetary 
investment that has to pay off in due course (educaci6 
bancaria). Under the influence of Sartre and EDMUND 
HUSSERL 's conception of consciousness, which explains 
the ability of consciousness to achieve a critica! rela-
tionship to its own tacit knowledge, Freire fuses his 
dialogi cal conception of a joint and responsible educa-
tion with the materialistic theories of society of Karl 
Marx and Erich Fromm ( 1900-1980). 
A truely humanistic education means neither domi-
nation nor monetary investment, but to provide the stu-
dent, in mutual respect, with critica! thinking. Freire's 
critique of the deposit theory of education is also ap-
proved by Juan-Carles Melich. Strongly influenced by 
Heidegger's phenomenology, Sartre's existentialism, 
and ALFRED SCHUTz's phenomenology of intersubjectiv-
ity, Melich propagates an existential pedagogy offini-
tude that emphasizes the creativity and uniqueness of 
the human being as a person-a person who could be 
called on by truth. Similar to Oberholzer, who worked 
in South Africa, Melich draws upon the therapeutic 
conception ofvrKTOR FRANKL. The nature ofthe human 
being is freedom. Personality in this sense has to be 
respected in every humane education. 
The influence of authors from THE NETHERLANDS who 
ha ve worked in a phenomenological manner is shown 
mainly in an increased interes! in thc patterns of chil-
dren 's experience. While MARTINUS J. LANGEVELD works 
rather intuitively and only occasionally explicitly in the 
phenomeno]ogica! field, STEPHAN STRASSER explicitly 
wants to clarify fundamental questions in the pheno-
menological analysis of experience. Langeveld's an-
thropological studies of the child interpret the child's 
specific way of perceiving the world as an "open pro-
duction of sense," which responds to the stimuli of 
the child's LIFEWORLD. His main objections are to those 
conceptions, such as Piaget's, that treat childhood as 
only a pre-stage offull-fledged adulthood. Ali forms of 
the child's expression, e.g., playing and drawing, indi-
cate a multifarious and original perception ofthe world 
that becomes stunted rather than developed further in 
the process of growing up. 
Such studies strive to free the child 's way of experi-
encing from the image of deficiency that it has to bear in 
famous theories of child development. Moreover, they 
are interested in the question ofhow things, taking into 
consideration their characteristic appeal, contribuie to 
the shaping of the specific organization of children's 
experience. Links to phenomenologically inspired PSY-
CHIATRY (lAN HENDRIK VAN DEN BERG) and to phenomen-
o!ogical PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY (FREDERIK .1 • .1. 
BUYTENDIJK) focus attention on the concrete, the presci-
entific, and the pre-conventional, i.e., pre-conventional 
in the sense of moral behavior that is not yet shaped by 
any explicit rule. 
Strasser's attempt to draw up a critique ofthe scien-
tific reductions ofthe conception ofhuman beings from 
an anthropological viewpoint owes much to pheno-
menological methods. While his influence on others is 
rather inconspicuous, Langeveld's thinking led to the 
formation of a school. The so-called "Utrecht school" 
has developed a broad research program concern ing the 
investigation of mii ieus of children and adolescents. 
The first noteworthy breakthrough to phenomen-
ological self-confidence within pedagogy occurred in 
the late 1970s and early 1980s. Right after World War 

160 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
II pedagogy and education were dominated by pro-
cesses of intense bureaucratization and confidence in 
the scientific analysis and planning of teaching. As 
time passed, however, the suspicion arose that such a 
strategy would lead to a technical reification of social 
action. The worry grew that there was not enough at-
tention paid to the particular situations of children and 
adolescents. The critique of the alienation of scien-
tific rationalization from concrete life led to a renewed 
appreciation ofphenomenology as a philosophy of ex-
perience. Now not only are Bollnow's contributions 
to a pedagogica! anthropology read anew but also the 
studies ofLangeveld. The "Utrecht school" took shape 
under the influence of TON BEEKMAN. Numerous multi-
faceted investigations within the concrete life-milieus 
of adolescents and of, e.g., people using wheelchairs 
wcre carried through with the help of participant ob-
servation (tei!nehmende Beobachtung) (HANS BLEEKER, 
KAREL MULDERIJ). Investigators share a common situa-
tion with the children, adolescents, and others whom 
they observe. This opens up the possibility of under-
standing and describing the shared experiences. In this 
way phenomenologicai analyses are clearly different 
from Iaboratory research. Phenomenological investi-
gators try hard to see the world from the viewpoint of 
thc other. 
MAX VAN MANEN has developed his phenomen-
ological pedagogy in CANADA in connection with the 
"Utrecht school." His version of phenomenoiogical 
pedagogy was stimulated by a specific interpretation of 
Heidegger and can be characterized as holistic and po-
etic. It can be called holistic where its guiding concep-
tion ofthe human being is concerned. This conception 
bears certain similarities to the humanistic psychology 
of Cari R. Rogers (1901-1987). Van Manen's approach 
presents itself as poetic because, being aware of the 
limits ofthe logica! reconstructions of pedagogica! ac-
tion, it remains sensitive to what cannot be verbalized 
and to what makcs itself heard only via silence. 
In the course of an increasing self-clarification of 
the status and the strategies ofphenomenological anal-
ysis within pedagogy, similar undertakings may be no-
ticed and assimilated. After a first phase consisting 
of mere criticism of science, a broad field of com-
mon interests and approaches opened up. This devel-
opment made it possible to realize that the analysis of 
thc unconscious and preconscious in psychoanalysis 
and Husserl 's thematization ofthe pre-structures of our 
experience have certain concems in common (wERNER 
LOCH). This has led to an increased awareness of the 
difficulties that arise when one tries to return to pre-
scientific and primordial perceptions and to describe 
concrete action in such a way that its obliquencss is re-
tained. Anthropological and socio-phenomenological 
theories are fused (WILFRIED LIPPITZ) so that the re-
searchers are able to pay more attention to the con-
crete reality of education that has long been neglected. 
Moreover, this approach has made it much easier to 
overcome the naive view that holds that educational 
processes can be understood independently oftheir so-
cietal circumstances. 
There is a variety of phenomenologically minded 
conceptions. Loch deals, among other things, with the 
problems arising from the systematic study of concrete 
biographies. He is looking for possibilities of describ-
ing the child's concrete consciousness of being able 
to do something (Kănnensbewusstsein) in its genetic 
dimension. Lippitz reconstructs the notion of the life-
world not only in the Husserlian sense, but also with 
respect to the transformations the notion underwent 
in the works of MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY. He USeS the 
results of this reconstruction for a fundamental expla-
nation of pedagogica! ACTION and combines different 
phenomenological traditions in pedagogy to clarify our 
lifeworldly experience. Moreover, he interprets the in-
tricate phiJosophy of EMMANUEL LEVINAS in order to 
bring the humanism via the other human being to bear 
for a reformulation of difficult ethical questions that are 
of extraordinary importance to pedagogica! discourse. 
There are certain links to the studies of the Belgian 
pedagogue MARIETTE HELLEMANS who tries, on the ba-
sis of Levinas's ethical theory, to interpret anew the 
notion of responsibility, which is of great importance 
to pedagogica! thinking. Educational relationships are 
tobe understood as a response to the needs ofpupils in 
order to come to a conceptualization ofthese relation-
ships that is not restricted solely to the aspect ofpower. 
Her disciple JAN MASSCHELEIN starts from there. In his 
studies, which interpret pedagogica! action as com-
municative action, he draws upon HANNAH ARENDT's 
investigations concerning the implications of the fact 
that we are born. He points out aspects of the educa-
tional process that are fundamentally beyond the reach 
of the people involved in the process. Concrete action 

EDUCATION 
161 
is characterized as a response to the new beginning 
caused by birth and hence, in an ethical perspective, as 
the obligation to respond. 
KĂTE MEYER-DRAWE analyzes the fact that we each 
are a living BODY (Leib) and the consequences aris-
ing from it for our intersubjective experience. This is 
do ne in order to widen the notion of rationality and to 
prepare the ground for an understanding of forms of 
experience in children that does not project concepts 
onto these forms that pertain, if at ali, only to certain 
patterns of adult rational ity. At the same time, a pheno-
menology of the living body, as it is developed after 
Merleau-Ponty, also allows for a critique of traditional 
pedagogica! concepts of personality. Such a critique 
strives to do justice to the intersubjective structures of 
educational action and to point out the fact that the 
concepts of personality and identity are only deriva-
tive. The rehabilitation of the fact that we are living 
bodies and the recognition that this fact is part of our 
rational faculty prepare the ground for the reception 
of phenomenological thinking in the subdiscipline of 
pedagogy that deals with handicapped people (e.g., 
WILHELM PFEFFER, URSULA STINKES). from the viewpoint 
of our bodily existence, not only different possibilities 
of communicating with people who suffer from severe 
mental handicaps, but also the limits of such commu-
nication come into focus. The handicapped person ap-
pears as a stranger in close proximity whose difference 
has a right to be respected. 
In addition, the renewed turn to the sensuous nature 
(Sinnlichkeit) of the human being (HORST RUMPF) has 
entailed lasting attention toward lifeworldly forms of 
experience. Learning and teaching in institutions can 
be deciphered and criticized as disciplinary measures 
that not only ignore the sensuousness inherent in the 
forms of knowing of children, but even suppress its 
creativity. Manners, methods of teaching, and seating 
plans- as well as, say, commands in classes of PHYSI-
CAL EDUCATION- produce teaching and learning habits 
that have incorporated a scientific attitude long before 
it can explicitly present itself as a certain attitude of 
knowing. Concentrating on how learning takes place 
opens up the possibility of combining phenomenologi-
cal theories of learning with Norbert Elias's (1897-
1990) critique of the process of civilization as well as 
with MICHEL muc AULT's analyses of disciplinary power. 
GONTHER BUCK develops a phenomenologically in-
spired theory of leaming that brings the act of leaming 
into focus. In critica! contrast to theories that inter-
pret learning only via its results, Buck points out that 
leaming is a process fu li of confticts, that learning also 
always implies forgetting something, and that leaming 
has tobe described as anat times rather painful reinter-
pretation of one 's own history of experience. The myth 
of leaming as the steady progress from certa in begin-
nings to anticipated ends, as the path on which a steady 
accumulation ofknowledge takes place, is severly criti-
cized. Numerous applications ofthe theory oflearning 
as a disruptive restructuring of operative cxperience 
have alrcady turned out to be successful with regard to 
understanding the concrete learning processcs. 
Concordantly, BRUNO REDEKER emphasizcs the rele-
vance of primordial sensuous experience in the !cam-
ing of physics. This learning comes about only if 
one realizes the original character of the preknowl-
edge of the lifeworld as opposed to the perspective 
of the NATURAL SCIENCES. There is no continuity in the 
transformation of prescientific experience into objec-
tive knowledge. The latter is achieved in a confronta-
tion with mostly tacitly guiding opinions. A difficulty 
of the phenomenological perspective !ies in the fact 
that adults remember what they ha ve learned, but ha ve 
mostly forgotten how they learned it. The rcsults that 
are available to us obscure the way that led to them. 
The Jinks to MARTIN WAGENSCHEIN's theory of genetic 
leaming are obvious. 
GOTTFRIED BRĂUER opens up new possibilities ofaes-
thetic education by showing the creativity of sensu-
ous perception phenomenologically. And again, what 
is characteristic about this approach is that it takes 
the child's perceptions of the world seriously. More-
over, it appreciates the attitude of the educator who 
respects the specific forms of understanding of adoles-
cents and who does not merely strive to make the pupi! 
overcome these forms of understanding. Related to the 
phenomenological conceptions of teaching and !cam-
ing are attempts to criticize traditional stage theories of 
moral and intellectual development (Jean Piaget) and 
to break up their one-sidedness by drawing upon the 
child's potentialities of experience (BERNHARD CURTIS 
and WOLFE MAYS). 
Despite the diversity ofphenomenological theories 
of education, there are certain family rescmblances. 
Common to ali trends is the doubt about thc omnipo-

162 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ten ce of scientific investigation. These doubts can lead 
to an aversion to science, but they can also motivate 
a productive collaboration between the sciences and 
philosophy. Within phenomenological theories of ed-
ucation this collaboration shows itself as an openness, 
e.g., to psychoanalytical and sociologica! explanations. 
In such a context, phenomenological analysis seeks 
primordial patterns operative in processes of learning, 
education, and formation. Experiences are to be taken 
up where they occur and they are to be described and 
explained, taking into consideration the specific cir-
cumstances under which they have come about. With 
respect to thinking and perceiving as well as to ac-
tion, it is the act as such that stands in the foreground. 
Nevertheless, one has to avoid the common prejudice 
that phenomenological investigation within pedagogy 
coincides with the attempt, devoid of ali theory, to 
grasp "authentic experiences." To return to the matters 
themselves does not mean to collect merely what one 
encounters accidentally in one's lifeworld, but rather 
demands the theoretical effort to break through the 
walls oftaken-for-granted opinions. This fundamental 
feature and, along with it, the attention toward dis-
continuity, crisis, and the negative are what qualifies 
phenomenological investigation as critica!. Turning to 
the prescientific acts of experience, the archaeology of 
primordial opinions and attitudes must not be exagger-
ated so that it is hypostatized as a myth of immediacy. 
This is a specific danger of endeavors that strive to 
widen the scope ofthe dominant concepts ofrational-
ity by recalling the fact of our bodily existence, that 
undermine adult habits by refering to children 's ways 
of perceiving, and that thematize the operative sense 
of concrete act ion instead of restricting themselves to 
the mere results of such an action. 
There is no sense behind the things, there exists no 
order beyond our concrete world, and there is no night 
of identity and no sunshine state of reason that we can 
reach. Thus if we learn to listen to the expressions of 
children in their productive sense, we do learn some-
thing about our adult selves. To acquire something like 
imagination in listening to other orders of reason means 
to tind a remedy against a special problem of Western 
reason, which has forgotten how to dream because of 
its insomnia. This insomnia is caused by the ideal of a 
sunshine state of reason. But this is no humane ratio-
nality- neither for a child nor for an adult.

EGO 
EGO 
(lch, ego) Generally speaking, the "I" 
or "ego" refers to oneself, to what one is. It can have 
as many meanings as the notion of the self. In a broad 
sense, this can include your possessions, social posi-
tion, physical and psychological being. It can also, in 
a narrower sense, be used to refer to your innermost 
being, to the selfthat has, but is not identica! to, its pos-
sessions, its social position, etc. Phenomenologically, 
ali of the senses must be correlated with the phenom-
ena. Each, if it is to pass beyond empty signification 
and intend something real, must be linked to modes 
of appearing- e.g., the appearing of the body, of the 
psychological state, etc. With this the question arises as 
to whether the ego in its narrower sense can be posited 
phenomenologically. EDMUND HUSSERL answered this 
question in various ways throughout his career. His an-
swers are instructive since most ofthe current views on 
what the ego is stern from positions originally sketched 
out by him. 
Initially, in the Logische Untersuchungen {1900-
1901 ), Husserl did not believe that o ne could speak 
of the ego in any narrower sense than that given by 
the various states of consciousness. With re gard to the 
ego, the dominant inftuence in this work is clearly that 
of WILLIAM JAMES- specifically, his doctrine that "the 
states of consciousness are ali that psychology needs." 
Following James, he asserts that the "phenomenolog-
ically reduced ego" is "identica!" with the "intercon-
nected unity'' of such states. Its unity is the unity of 
its experiences. It is founded on their "contents and 
the laws they obey." The context ofthese assertions is 
Husserl 's express opposition to the position ofthe nea-
Kantian Paul Natorp ( 1854--1924). Contrary to James, 
Natorp stresses the irreducibility of the ego to its· con-
tents. Natorp's reason for this is that tobe a content is 
to stand over against an ego. It is to be an abject- a 
Gegen-stand- for an ego. Contrariwise, "tobe an ego 
is not to be an abject, but to be something opposed to 
ali objects." Such an ego is necessarily anonymous. It 
cannot be named or grasped in any objective manner. In 
the Logische Untersuchungen, Husserl quotes Natorp 
only to dismiss him. A non-appearing ego cannot be 
phenomenologically justified. Phenomenology is thus 
"quite unable to find this ego, this primitive, neces-
sary center ofrelations." However, in a footnote to the 
second edition ofthis work, which appeared the same 
year as the ldeen zu einen reiner Phănomenologie und 
163 
phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913), he does ad-
mit: "I have since managed to find it." 
What exactly has he found? Husserl's terminology 
is often nea-Kantian, yet the descriptive analysis points 
to something quite different. In Jdeen !, he asserts that 
the ego is not the changing acts (the cogitationes) of 
consciousness. Rather, it is something self-identica!, 
something that, in its self-identity, must be distin-
guished from the real, changing "contents" (the acts, 
objects, impressions, etc.) of consciousness. The acts of 
consciousness, when successful, may allow transcen-
dent objects to appear through its shifting impressions. 
When I successfully "see" a pattern of shadows under 
a bush as a crouching cat, the cat becomes intuitively 
present to me. We thus have the division, ego--cogito--
cogitatum, where the act (the cogito) working on the 
given impressions yields the perceptual cogitatum (the 
intuitively present abject). Distinguished from the act, 
impressions, and appearing abject, the ego, Husserl 
asserts, has no material content of its own. It is quite 
empty of such. Yet this emptiness does not point to 
the ego as a Kantian noumenal (non-appearing) agent. 
Rather, the ego becomes, for Husserl, aform or struc-
ture for such experiences. It is a structure that is individ-
ualized- made unique- by the particular contents 
of a particular experiential stream. This is why Husserl 
can assert, as he does in the Cartesianische Medita-
tionen [1931], that the "ego [is] inseparable from the 
processes making up his life," that it "is what it is solely 
in relation to intentiona! objectivities," and that it is, in 
fact, "only concrete" in relation to them, ali the while 
maintaining the identity and purity ofthis ego. The pu-
rity in question is a purity.finm the changing contents 
of experience. It is the purity of a self-identica! form. 
What particularizes this structure is the actual contents 
making up a particular ego-life. 
ldeen zu einen reiner 
Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie Il [ 1912-15] fi lis 
out this doctrine in much greater detail. The pure ego, 
taken as a structure or form, is the "center" of experi-
ence. It is, in fact, the centering that makes experience 
ego logica!. The best way to describe this is to note that 
each ego is at the center of its surrounding world. In 
lived SPACE, each subject by virtue ofits BODY is always 
at its "here," at the zero point of the coordinate axes 
of its space. It is from the ego that distances radiate 
out. It is about it that perspectiva! series unfold, their 

164 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
relative rates of unfolding giving it the sense of ob-
jects' being near or far. Thus as you walk through a 
park, trees close by match your progress by receding 
at the same speed, objects ata middle range glide by at 
a more stately pace, while objects marking the distant 
horizon scarcely seem to move. Each, in fact, has its 
rate of showing its different aspects, and each rate is 
coordinated to the ego taken as a spatial center. The 
same holds, mutatis mutandis, for the ego as a center 
of TIME. For such an ego, it is always now. It always 
occupies the point of passage between the anticipated 
future and the receding but sti li retained past. 
Two forms oftranscendence appear in this analysis: 
the spatial o ne of physical distances and the temporal 
one that marks the temporal remove from my now-
ness. The first, according to Husserl in Analysen zur 
passiven Synthesis [ 1918-26], "is a second level tran-
scendence." The original transcendence is temporal. It 
is a feature ofthe stream of consciousness whose tem-
poral sequencing of contents results in the relative rates 
of perspectiva! unfolding. These give you your sense 
of the "near" and the "far," and hence give you your 
sense ofyourselfas a spatial center. Such a sense, with 
its transcendence, depends on the temporal departure 
of contents, but this departure into pastness is what 
creates the first transcendence. The implication, then, 
is that what is originally transcendent is simply the 
past over against your nowness. As your own appear-
ances depart into pastness, this transcendence becomes 
a se/(-transcendence. 
Two conclusions follow from this doctrine. The first 
is what Husserl, in the C manuscripts of the 1930s, 
among others, will !ater caii the ego's "anonymity." 
Here Husserl repeats the assertions of Natorp that ev-
ery objective name or sense we could apply to the ego 
misses the mark since "to be an ego is not to be an 
object, but to be something opposed to ali objects." 
The descriptive analysis. however, is not neo-Kantian. 
Anonymity is posited on the basis of a particular set of 
phcnomena; it is the result ofyour appearing to remain 
now as a "central ego," even while the experiences that 
just now particularized you appear to depart into past-
ness. Grasping yourselfthrough their objective synthe-
sis, you apprehend yourself not as you presently are, 
but as you were. Every object you grasp is, in other 
words, already transcendent by virtue of the pastness 
of the retained contents through which it is grasped. 
As transcendent, it is other than what you are in your 
central nowness. 
The second conclusion that follows from the prior-
ity of temporal over spatial transcendence concerns the 
constitution of the self. Such constitution begins with 
the institution of temporal transcendence. It is, in the 
first instance, the constitution of a temporal center as a 
point from which such transcendence is measured. One 
can also think of it as the specification ofthe anonymity 
ofthis center by ( 1) the constitution ofthe temporal en-
vironment that makes it a center and by (2) the filling 
ofthis environment with the contents that particularize 
it. The description of the temporal constitution is car-
ried out, first, in the Vorlesungen zur Phanomenologie 
des inneren Zeitbweusstseins [ 1905) and, second, in, 
among others, the C manuscripts of the 1930s. Basi-
cally, Husserl 's position is that our sense of ourselves 
as a central now depends on our sense of pastness and 
futurity. The sense of pastness, in turn, depends on a 
process that, in retaining a content, tags it as past. Thus 
the sense of the increasing pastness of the content is 
the result of its being retained, then this retention be-
ing retained, and so on. Each addition to this chain of 
retentions of retentions marks the content as having 
departed further into pastness. A similar analysis hav-
ing to do with protentions of an anticipated content is 
used to describe our sense of the approaching future. 
The result ofthis dual constitution is, as indicated, our 
sense of ourselves as nowness toward lvhich the future 
approaches,.from which the past departs, and in which 
time in its moments seems to well up present and ac-
tual. For Husserl, this structure is the ego understood 
as a temporal form. Given that its constitution involves 
contents, i.e., contents tobe retained or protended, we 
cannot speak of it without also considering the contents 
that particularize it. 
To speak of such contents is, however, to move be-
yond the notion of a pure ego- the ego as an "empty" 
or abstract temporal form- to what Husserl comes to 
caii a "personal" ego. Once aga in, Jdeen Il is an impor-
tant source fiii ing in the details ofthe insights advanced 
in the first volume. It concerns itself with what may 
be called the Husserlian version of a "transcendental 
aesthetic." The term refers to the passive syntheses 
that first allow the ego to "find itself as identica! in 
its course" -
to find itself as the same ego with the 
same characteristics. The fact that the ego, as a tempo-

EGO 
rai form, is particularized by the stream of its contents 
means that its identity demands the stream 's identity. In 
Husserl 's words, "it could not be constituted as a last-
ing and remaining ego if a lasting and remaining stream 
of experience were not constituted." This constitution 
is based on the same retentional processes that help 
position the ego as a central nowness. Thus the stream 
could not ha ve any persistence ifwhat transpires within 
it-e.g., a perception-vanished the moment after its 
occurring. Ifthe perception is tobe something that can 
be returncd to again and again, its content-filled mo-
ments, as well as the synthesis that originally bound 
them together, must be retained. To form an identica] 
unit located within departing time, their retention must 
preserve them with a distinct temporal referent. When 
the retentional process fulfills these conditions, then, 
as Husserl says, "that which is posited by an act ofthe 
cogito, the theme, is ... something lasting." It becomes 
one of the "possessions" of the ego. It is there for us 
even when we do not regard it, do not reproduce it 
by actively remembering it. The result ofthe temporal 
syntheses by which experiences are retained and fixed 
in their temporal positions is thus not just your central 
nowness. It is also the basis for your finding yourself(if 
you really are consistent) as the same position-taking 
self. The ego "finds itself as identica] in its course" 
of position takings if, having performed some act, it 
recalls having performed the same act in the past. 
This account can be extended to ali the features that 
make up the "personal ego"- e.g., to our judgments, 
beliefs, attitudes, etc. Insofar as what I have done is re-
tained, the same "inertia" occurs. An interesting point 
here is that the reproduction ofthe remembered is also a 
reproduction ofthe doxic attitude that accompanied it. 
Given that nothing has intervened, the latter must reoc-
cur. If it did not, MEMORY would not really re-produce 
what had gone before (and analogously for EXPECTA-
TION). This means that notjust my experiences but also 
my beliefs become part of my "lasting possessions." 
They are part of the environment that defines me as a 
central ego. 
The transcendental aesthetic includes more, of 
course, thanjust the laying down of self-identica] tem-
poral unities. In Husserl's words, it involves the "reg-
ularities grouped under the tit le of 'association' which 
pertain to everything present in the stream of expe-
riences." As such, it includes the gestalt qualities of 
165 
fusion, contrast, and pairing. "Fusion" designates the 
merging of similar contents. By virtue of it, the quali-
ties ofthe similar contents "stand out." Like a series of 
overlapping transparencies, they reinforce each other, 
and hence distinguish themselves from the heteroge-
neous qualities of the contents whose un ion does not 
result in their reinforcement. This merging gives us the 
object's "noematic nucleus." It provides the material 
for the cogito's presentation ofthe object's connected, 
relatively stable features. Insofar as the qualities of 
the merged contents are, constitutively, those of the 
object, the object stands out. The "contrast" arises be-
tween it and the heterogeneous qualities of its back-
ground. "Pairing" comes in the linking of similarities. 
By virtue of it, a present perception recalls a past one 
with a similar content. Togetherthey may reca li a third. 
The ultimate result can be a whole horizon of acts, 
ali with similar contents. Once again the phenomenon 
of merging can occur, though this time its focus can 
be on acts, rather than on objects and their contents. 
The result can be the prominence ofthe relatively sta-
bie features that characterize me as a personal ego. In 
Husserl's words, the consequence of these "regulari-
ties" is my "pregivenness" as a personal ego, i.e., my 
givenness before I reftect on my behavior. 
As a personal ego, 1 am nota solitary self, but rather 
a person among persons. This means that my objects 
are not just present to me but to others as well. They 
form part of our common world. As there for others, 
a layer of their sense-structures is intersubjective. In 
the Cartesianische Meditationen, Husserl asks whether 
this layer is primordially given. Ifit is not, then it must 
be founded upon a level of phenomena that is avail-
able prior to the givenness of other subjects. Consti-
tuted out ofthe phenomena ofthis prior level, both the 
"objective common world" as well as the others who 
share it can, in this alternative, be considered to be 
"transcendentally constituted in me." If 1 accept this, 
then I move from a view of the ego as a constituted 
( essentially temporal) formation to a view that takes 
it as "ultimately constituting." In Husserl 's words, it 
becomes the "subjectivity which constitutes both the 
sense and actuality of being." lts constitutive activity 
includes "every conccivable sense, every conceivable 
being." Husserl's attempt to work out this alternative 
leads repeatedly to assertions ofthis kind. 
Husserl 's remarks ha ve brought a number of corn-

166 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
mentators, incJuding PAUL RICCEUR, ALFRED SCHUTZ, and 
THEODOR DE BOER, to assert that Husserl ultimately carne 
to position the ego as "creative" in its constitution. 
Such a view raises the question of the identity of this 
ego. Is it the ego of an individual person or is it, as 
both Schutz and EUGEN FINK affirm, a uniquely singu-
lar, pre-individual "prima! ego"? The assertion of the 
latter does not contradict the view that sees the indi-
vidual ego as a constituted formation, since the two 
egos (the individual and the prima!) exist on differ-
ent levels. The question, however, remains as to the 
possible phenomenological evidence for this prima! or 
"Ur-ego." Studies by JAMES MENSCH and KLAUS HELD 
of the manuscripts written in the period following the 
Cartesianische Meditationen indicate that the individ-
ual ego, on the level ofits anonymity, exists in a kind of 
coincidence with the prima! ego. The evidence for the 
latter is provided by a "reduction to the living present" 
understood as a "reduction to the sphere ofprimal tem-
poralization in which the first and originary sense of 
time comes forward." This reduction strips my ego of 
the environment that individualizes it into a particular 
temporal center. So reduced, it appears as the "living 
present [taken] as the prima! ground and source ofev-
erything." "This present," Husserl adds, "is not mine 
as opposed to that of other human beings." Within it, 
"my ego and the other ego do not have any extensive 
distance in the community of our being with each other. 
Also my life, my temporalization, has no distance from 
that of the other person." In our coincidence, we are 
the prima! ego. This is the ego that functions in and 
through the nowness of each individual ego. lts func-
tioning is that of temporalization; it is the production 
of ever new content-filled moments whose retention 
and protention yield the individual ego as a temporal 
form. 
Reactions to Husserl 's answers to the question ofthe 
ego vary. For some, his assertion that "there are tran-
scendentally constituted in me, the transcendental ego, 
both other egos and ... an objective, common world 
... " is an expression of an unacceptable idealism. As 
Husserl expresses this objection, a phenomenology that 
begins with the "ego of the phenomenological reduc-
tion" remains restricted to this. As such, it either "falls 
into transcendental solipsism" or engages in a "spec-
ulative idealism." Some phenomenologists attempt to 
avoid this unpalatable alternative by returning to the 
egoless phenomenology ofthe Logische Untersuchun-
gen. This is the position of ARON GURWITSCH and JEAN-
PAUL SARTRE. In his "Phănomenologie der Thematik und 
der reinen Ich" ( 1929), Gurwitsch takes a minimalist 
position. His claim is that the "phenomenologically re-
duced pure ego is nothing but the chain along which 
ali experiences are ordered and which terminates in 
the present now continuously gliding forward." The 
ego is not the "now" itself, but rather the "chain" end-
ing in the now. The "chain," understood as a "con-
catenation of ali the mental states belonging to one 
consciousness," forms the "thoroughgoing context in 
which every mental state is related to every other one." 
To ascribe a mental state to the ego is simply to in-
clude it in the chain. Directly regarded, the states of 
the chain do not in their "unity and order" constitute 
transcendent objects; hen ce it is "by way of contrast to 
transcendence" that the "order in question" comes to 
be taken as "subjective." 
In contrast to Gurwitsch 's view that "the ego is the 
flux [of consciousness] itselr', JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, in 
his seminal work, "La transcendence de 1 'ego" ( 193 7), 
gives an account of its constitution. Rather than simply 
being the "totality" of our states, the ego, he claims, "is 
the spontaneous, transcendent unification of our states 
and our actions." This unification or constitution takes 
place in layers: "consciousnesses (Erlebnisse) are first; 
through these are constituted states; and then, through 
the latter, the ego is constituted." In each case, the con-
stituted, which is a result ofthe elements constituting it, 
is naively assumed tobe their source. Thus I ascribe my 
feelings of disgust when I see Peter to the fact that I ha te 
him. This state ofhatred is taken as a source ofmy feel-
ings. Similarly, I take myself as the person responsible 
for my various states. In Sartre 's words, "refl.ection ... 
gives the me as the source ofthe state." In reality, I am 
no such thing. lfl were to "plunder" the ego ofits states 
and qualities, 1 would not uncover it as a source or an 
actor. Rather, "at the end of this plundering, nothing 
would remain; the ego would have vanished." What 
we take to be the spontaneity or freedom of egologi-
cal action is actually the spontaneity of the "absolute 
consciousness" that supplies the elements for egolog-
ical constitution. Our actions surprise us because they 
are not our own, but rather ari se from the "impersonal 
spontaneity" of this consciousness. In Sartre 's words, 
regarding it, we re gard a "tireless creation of existence 

EGO 
ofwhich we are not the creators." The phenomenologi-
cal description of its spontaneity "renders impossible 
any distinction between action and passion or any con-
ception of an autonomy of the will." As for the ego, it 
is phenomenologically a kind of fiction, an inevitable 
yet illusory contruct born on the crest ofthe impersonal 
spontaneity whose presence it masks. 
If we accept this view, the problem of INTERSUB-
JECTIVITY, which is that ofrecognizing other persons as 
transcendental, constituting egos, vanishes. Along with 
the world they inhabit, they are constituted entities. In 
Sartre's words, both the "world" and "the me ... are 
objects for absolute impersonal consciousness; it is by 
virtue of this consciousness that they are connected." 
Solipsism, then, is avoided through an appeal to this 
absolute. This solution bears a certain resemblance to 
Husserl 's attempt in the late manuscripts to describe 
the founding of an intersubjective community through 
the action of a prima! ego. For Husserl, however, the 
point of connection is not an absolute spontaneity of 
experiences, but rather a pre-plural "living present." A 
few phenomenologists ha ve attempted to work out this 
so]ution. Others, such as THOMAS M. SEEBOHM and ISO 
KERN, adopt the position of the Husserl who wrote the 
three volumes of the Jdeen, the Cartesianische Medi-
tationen, Formale und transzendentale Logik ( 1929), 
etc. They accept the claim ofthe Meditationen that the 
adoption of"transcendental idealism" does not lead to 
a solipsism. 
Another alternative is also possible. It begins by 
observing that the different concepts Husserl advances 
for the ego correspond to the different stages of the 
ego 's self-objectification. In Husserl 's description, the 
process originates in the anonymity of pre-egological 
functioning, exfoliates in the streaming life of a particu-
lar consciousness, and ends in the world of constituted, 
objective sense. Corresponding to these, we have the 
concepts of the ego as a "prima!" pre-individual func-
tioning; the ego as a temporal streaming of particular 
acts, states, and contents; and the ego as a personal, 
fully concrete self. Combining these, we are led to 
take the ego, not as a particular stage, but as the pro-
cess itself. Insofar as this process is temporal, it has an 
essential neutrality with regard to the contents it em-
bodies. The latter, or rather the senses they sustain, de-
termine what counts as intersubjective and what counts 
as private. The view that the ego is a temporal process 
167 
is thus compatible with the assertion of the primor-
diality of intersubjective sense-structures. It allows us 
to assert that parents (and, generally, "others") help a 
child to "make sense" of his earliest experiences and 
still embrace Husserl's view that phenomenology and 
egology imply each other.

EIDETIC METHOD 
"Eidetic" is used as syn-
onymous with such traditional terms as "a priori," "es-
sential," and "universal and necessary" in qualifying a 
distinctive sort of objects, propositions, truths, cogni-
tions, and sciences. The substantive is "ei dos"; the plu-
ral, "eide." At the most generallevel, phenomenology 
distinguishes between formal and materially determi-
nate eide, with correspondingly distinct methods of 
arriving at insight into them. Discussion ofthe method 
of formalization, belonging specifically to considera-
tions of formal LOGIC and FORMAL AND MATERIAL ONTOL-
OGY, will be omitted here. Accordingly, "eide" should 
be read throughout as a convenient abbreviation for 
"materially determinate (not formal) ei de." Phenomen-
ology is itself an eidetic science. It has also developed 
a distinctive approach to eidetic science in general. Ac-
cordingly, the claim both to be an eidetic science and 
to defend the possibility of eidetic science in general 
involves phenomenology in traditional issues of logic, 
theory of MEANING, epistemology (see EVIDENCE), and 
formal and material ontology. The introduction of the 
term "eidetic" is meant to signal a distinctive approach 
to those issues, rather than the continuation of any tra-
ditional philosophical position regarding them. 
Clarity about any science involves setting forth 
and justifying an appropriate method of establishing 
truths and examining knowledge claims. Sin ce no such 
method for eidetic science has been generally accepted, 
reflection upon phenomenological method has to in-
volve an explicit discussion of the steps involved in 
the method appropriate to establishing eidetic knowl-
edge in general. 
The first step in any method involves a preliminary 
understanding of its terminus a quo and its terminus 
ad quem. Phenomenology takes the starting point of 
ali scientific endeavors tobe the pre-philosophical and 
prescientific experience of the WORLD, accepted as ac-
tually existing independently of any thought about it. 
Further, phenomenological reflection finds that such 
experience encounters individual objects, facts, and 
relations, taken as actually existing particulars grasped 
in PERCEPTION and MEMORY. finally, phenomenologicaJ 
theory holds that although eide or universal essences 
are not themselves particular facts, any theoretical 
knowledge of facts involves an implicit comprehen-
sion of essences, in accordance with which the facts 
are structured and classified. 
Hence the attempt to discover eide requires, as its 
first step, a deliberate effort to redirect attention from 
the usual focus upon the domain of particular facts to 
an explicit articulation of essences and essential struc-
tures. That first step is called the "eidetic EPOCHE AND 
REDUCTION." Since the natural world is normally ac-
cepted not only as actually existing but as the compre-
hensive context of ali that actually exists, the eidetic 
epoche and reduction involves a suspension of belief 
with regard to the actual existence of any objects to 
be considered from the eidetic perspective. In conse-
quence of its noncommittal attitude toward actuality, 
eidetic knowledge implies no metaphysical position re-
garding essences as existing in a Platonic heaven, in the 
mind ofGod, in the minds ofhumans, in an Aristotelian 
uni verse of real natural kinds, or anywhere el se. 
The eidetic reduction, with its relevant epoche, is 
distinct from the transcendental phenomenological re-
duction and epoche of CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY. 
The latter suspends acceptance of the existence of thc 
world of experience in order to reflect upon how "the 
WORLD," as a complex unity of sense, comes tobe con-
stituted for consciousness. Accordingly, it retains the 
world of experience within its focus, but in a modified 
form, taken as phenomenon of transcendental pheno-
menology. The eidetic reduction, by contrast, involves 
a turning of interest away from the actual world en-
tirely, since it, as the comprehensive domain of per-
ceived, reflected, expected, and inferred actual par-
ticulars, is not the context within which eide can be 
discovered. 
Geometry, in its descriptive phase (i.e., disregard-
ing its formalized and axiomatized aspects), provides 
an illustration for such an eidetic epoche and reduction.

EIDETIC METHOD 
169 
That is, one doing geometry has to disregard the fac-
tual details of any actually existing concretely shaped 
objects provided by sensuous experience in order to 
discover the rational properties and relations of such 
ideally considered objects as circles, squares, and the 
like. At best, actually perceived shaped objects can 
serve as merely imperfect models for the geometri-
cally understood shapes. One's inability to tind or to 
draw a straight line having length without any depth or 
breadth is not due to limitations oftechnique, but is an 
eidetic impossibility. 
The second step is to select any instance of the ei-
dos one is attempting to articulate- any instance of 
green, for example. In consequence ofthe first step, it 
does not matter whether the instance selected is taken 
from experience, such as the color ofthe lush tall grass 
calling for my lawn mower, or from sheer phantasy, 
such as the color of some extraterrestrial 's skin ap-
pearing to my reverie. The eidetic epoche requires that 
any experienced instance be stripped of any preferen-
tial consideration and treated as if it were an object 
of mere IMAGINATION, i.e., as a merely possible object 
for quasi-sensuous intuition, situated neither in actual 
space nor in actual time, nor in any actual causal con-
text. 
The third step is to employ phantasy to subject the 
selected model to a series of arbitrary variations. Thus, 
for example, if 1 begin with contemplating the green 
skin of a three-foot-tall, eggplant-shaped alien sitting 
at a harp, 1 might first arbitrarily vary the imagined 
size, shape, and posture of the fictitious creature in 
severa! directions. 1 might then go on to vary the model 
further by imaginatively contemplating, in a series, the 
color ofthe Green Hornet, the color ofmy truc love's 
blouse, the color of a lagoon at Atlantis, and so on. In 
principle, the "and so on" extends ad infinitum. The 
variations are to be kept completely arbitrary, as long 
as they are ali restricted to imagined instances of, in 
this case, green. But the project is not to compile a list 
of possible instances. It is to contemplate an ei dos. 
Hence the next and fourth step involves relying on 
the overlapping synthesis of identity that establishes 
itself across the varying instances and actively noting 
the green they ali have in common, despite ali other 
imaginable variations. That green itself can then finally 
be isolated for a non-sensuous intuition as something 
identically repeatable in indefinitely many possible sin-
gular instances, as "one over many." 
Once grasped intuitively, an eidos can finally be in-
tuitively compared and contrasted with other eide, at 
varying levels of specification and generalization, so 
that o ne may see, for example, that green is a color; that 
yellow is not green, but is also a color; that the scent of 
a rose is nota color, but that scents and colors are sen-
suous qualities; and that color is a visible quality that 
can qualify any imaginable shape, but cannot itself be 
intuited except as visually qualifying some extension. 
Some obvious objections may serve further to clar-
ify the above method. Any adherent to NATURALISM or 
nominalism would be expected to refusc, in principle, 
to go along with the very first step on the grounds 
that there can be no possible objects of knowledge 
except sensed particulars. To that objection, a pheno-
menologist has two responses. The more polemic one 
is to point out the theoretical inconsistency involved in 
a nominalist's or empiricist's claiming to know some-
thing that cannot possibly be itself a matter of sense 
perception -
namely, the alleged principle holding 
for ali possible objects of knowledge. Though polem-
ica!, that rejoinder points to the serious responsibility 
of accounting for one's basic scientific or philosophi-
cal principles in a non-paradoxical manner, a task for 
which eidetic method is eminently suited. 
The more friendly response is to suggest that the 
empirica! principle of accepting the given as an in-
dispensible basis for knowledge is admirable, but that 
such acceptance should not be arbitrarily limited to 
what can be given to sense perception. In fact, the 
eidetic method seeks to extend the principle from ac-
cepting particular objects as they present themselves 
to sense intuition to accepting essences as they present 
themselves to eidetic, non-sensuous intuition. 
As to the second and third steps, it is easy to imagine 
a latter-day Meno's objection. lfthe method is meant to 
achieve knowledge of ei de, how can anyone be asked, 
in advance, to select an instance of an ei dos and then 
to imagine a series ofarbitrarily varied instances ofthe 
same eidos? 1 f 1 do not know what green is, 1 cannot be 
expected to select an instance of green and then to vary 
additional instances arbitrarily, while remaining stead-
fastly within the scope of green. On the other hand, if 
1 already know what green is, I do not require a cum-
bersome method to acquire the knowledge 1 already 
enjoy. 

170 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
This objection serves to highlight an important as-
pect of eidetic method. The method assumes that we 
do indeed have an implicit acquaintance with essences 
to begin with, but that this preliminary acquaintance is 
likely tobe defective in severa! respects. First, sin ce our 
interest is ordinarily focused upon experienced partic-
ulars to the neglect ofthe eidetic features and structures 
they instantiate, our implicit knowledge of essences is 
likely to remain so vague, confused, and unnoticed that 
it is possible, in good faith, even to accept nominalism 
as a rational philosophical position. Taking pains to 
achieve a clear, intuitive grasp of eidetic features and 
structures of possible objects of thought and knowl-
edge can serve to bring to light unnoticed obscurities 
and confusions that mar our implicit eidetic knowl-
edge. And it certainly enables us to see for ourselves 
that eide can indeed be objects of direct givenness. 
Second, even when we are confident of our pre-
liminary acquaintance with essences, such confidence 
may, in fact, be reducible to our ability to use common 
names correctly and consistently. The eidetic method 
seeks to move beyond such verbal virtuosity, however 
valuable in its own right, beyond knowledge oflinguis-
tically formed meanings to the direct intuition of the 
objects and states ofaffairs intended thereby, wherever 
possible. The attempt to do so may, of course, yield 
a negative outcome. Instead of arriving at a clearly 
seen eidos, we may achieve the insight that we have 
no essential knowledge of the object of our conceptual 
interest. We may even come to see that appropriate 
knowledge of such objects is, in principle, not suscep-
tible to strict eidetic conceptualization. Such is the case 
for the comprehensive category of objects encountered 
in common everyday experience of the surrounding 
world of ordinary life. For such objects, familiarity in 
terms of types -
i.e., of rough generalizations that 
are inherently vague and circumstantially indexed-
suffices for the practica! purposes of life. As Aristotle 
has noted, "square" means one thing for a geometer, 
something else for a carpenter. 
A third line of objection would be to dismiss the 
results of the eidetic method as too trivial to matter. 
Who needs a step-by-step method to justify proclaim-
ing such truisms as "a color is essentially distinct from 
a scent''? Aga in, two responses. First, truisms may well 
be too trivial to proclaim. However, the denial that they 
can be objects of genuine knowledge can be mislead-
ing in its consequences. Basic principles of logic and 
mathematics, like the principle of non-contradiction, 
may also be regarded as mere truisms. Skepticism con-
cerning them can result from regarding ali truisms as 
merely conventional matters. A particular merit ofthe 
eidetic method is its clear showing of the difference 
between achieving such eidetic knowledge, however 
trivial, and the acceptance of such truisms as merely 
conventional in character. Mere conventions could not 
pass the test of resisting arbitrary variation in phantasy. 
In our culture, generally speaking, the convention of 
hospitality, for example, clearly involves the obligation 
to treat guests with kindness, or at least nonviolently. It 
does not take much creativity to imagine instead a eul-
ture in which conventional rules of hospitality would 
regularly require that the last invited guest to arrive 
for dinner be carved up, cooked, and served to ali the 
previously arrived guests, in equal portions. 
Second, trivial points serve conveniently as clarify-
ing examples simply because oftheir familiarity. Their 
mention does not indicate any intrinsic limits of eidetic 
method. The method, in fact, is important to phenomen-
ology because it opens up phenomenological reflection 
to essential structures instantiated in various fonns of 
consciousness, under such general essential categories 
as INTENTIONALITY and TEMPORALITY. Accordingly, the 
method provides the means for developing a novel, 
rich, and varied articulation of the themes involved in 
theory of knowledge and, more generally, theory of 
REASON, since it is not stymied by anti-essentialist prej-
udices ingrained in the tradition of modern philosophy. 
Another objection might balk at such confidence in 
our powers ofimagination. Eidetic truths are supposed 
to be a priori, universal, and necessary. Imaginative 
ability is limited, often severely so, by our prevailing 
and unnoticed historical and social prejudices, among 
other factors. The fact that 1 cannot intuitively imagine 
something is no guarantee of its a priori impossibil-
ity. This objection deserves to be taken seriously, as a 
reminder that eidetic method, like any other method, 
is corrigible. Specifically, as imaginative powers de-
velop in the course ofincreased practice and as a result 
of new discoveries and even of novel approaches to 
thought and knowledge, it is tobe hoped that the actual 
practice of eidetic method may be refined accordingly. 
One may reasonably ask of any cognitive method such 
questions as the following: is it logically and practi-

EMOTION 
171 
cally consistent with its goal? ls it more likely to lead 
an unbiased practitioner to the desired insight than non-
methodical consideration might do? Does it provide a 
critica) check against dogmatic knowledge claims? It 
would not be reasonable to expect any method to be 
an infallible safeguard against the ignorance or other 
limitations of its practitioners. 
Finally, it should be emphasized that explicit artic-
ulation of the eidetic method also serves to disclose 
its intrinsic limits. Eidetic method is necessary to es-
tablish eidetic knowledge and eidetic sciences. But it 
cannot substitute for either observational or experi-
mental science. Indifferent to empirica! facts, it cannot 
claim to yield knowledge of contingent facts about 
either natural or cultural aspects of the world. What 
it can do is clarify the basic concepts that guide and 
shape empirica! observations. In that respect, it can 
also disclose unwarranted limitations of traditional ap-
proaches to experiential sciences, such as the commit-
ment of mainstream PSYCHOLOGY to the concepts and 
procedures that have proved successful in physics and 
chemistry. In that respect, the eidetic method, together 
with substantive phenomenological results, has proved 
to be of value in reconsiderations of the fundamental 
concepts of such non-philosophical disciplines as PSY-
CHOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY, and various HUMAN SCIENCES. In 
ali such contexts, pure eidetic method has tobe appro-
priately supplemented by discussing, on the basis of 
relevant experience, what purely essential structures 
are applicable to the discovery of impure, experien-
tially restricted, essences in that non-eidetic, empirica! 
domain ( e.g., what ideally possible forms ofperception 
are, in fact, humanly possible).

EMOTION 
Most phenomenologists ha ve some-
thing to say about affectivity, feeling, or emotion and 
often do SO in reJation to ETHICS and VALUE THEORY. 
The positions of major representatives of coNSTITUTIVE, 
REALISTIC, EXISTENTIAL, and HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMEN-
OLOGY will be sketched here as an introduction to the 
phenomenology of emotion itself, i.e., emotion apart 
from its role in those disciplines and tendencies. 
EDMUND HUSSERL offers no sustained treatment of 
emotion for its own sake, but does refer to the 
sphere of "feeling" ( Gefiihl) or "emotion" ( Gemiit) 
in Logische Untersuchungen (1900-190 l) and espe-
cially in ldeen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913 ), where the 
concern of his constitutive phenomenology is more 
epistemological than axiologica!. In the natural atti-

ing, etc., in a wor1d of things that are simply "there" 
for me. These things, however, are not "mere" things, 
but ha ve such emotive tinges as "pleasant" or"unpleas-
ant," "agreeable" or "disagreeable," and so on. As with 
other types of experience, the major structural feature 
is INTENTIONALITY: the "gladsome" (das Erfreuliche) is 
intended to in "being glad" (Sich~freuen) and "valuing 
consciousness" constitutes value and is distinct from 
the willing that is of central concern in his theory of 
ACTION. 
Within emotion or valuing Husserl recognizes non-
intentive feelings, e.g., pleasure and pain, on the model 
of the hyletic "stuff' in sensuous perception. Then 
again, there can be a "performed" or "effected" ("voll-
zogen") liking or disliking such that the EGO is "liv-
ingly busied" in the act; similarly, in sorrow, the I can 
actionally "undergo suffering." Finally, the affective, 
emotional, or valuing stratum is founded upon PERCEP-
TION, RE-PRESENTATION, MEMORY, IMAGINATION, etc. Such 
strutures can still be found and described using EIDETIC 
METHOD after transcendenta) EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION has 
been performed. 
MAX SCHELER correlates the a priori of values and 
their hierarchical relationships to the immediacy of 
feelings. Values are neither arbitrary constructions nor 
results of goods, but, in contrast to the latter, they are 
a priori. Values are given; they are not made but seen. 
The acts through which they are seen are emotions 
such as love and hate, yeaming, desire, and wishing, 
as well as comparative emotions such as preferring. 
There is, according to him, a region of genuine objec-
tivity and correlatively of emotional states in their own 
essential relationships. The order of values appears in 
emotional life. In this sense, as stated already in Zur 
Phiinomenologie und Theorie der Sympathiegefiihle 
und van Liebe und Hass (On phenomenology and the-
ory ofsympathy-feelings and oflove and hate, 1913), 
emotions are "intentionally" correlated to a priori val-
ues. 
There is then a logic of the heart in contrast to the 
formal logic ofBeing. This suggests that the intentiona! 
correlation between emotions and values comprises a 
phenomenological field of investigation independent 
of both the psychological and the material worlds. In 
acts of facing and pursuit, values are felt in their hier-
archy of higher and lower, absolute and relative. For 
example, the latter contrast is recognized only when it 
appears in the a priori feelings oflove and hate, i.e., in-
dependently of any empirica!, material, psychological, 
and vital human needs. 
In Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die materialen 
Wertethik (Formalism in ethics and nonformal ethics of 
value, 191311916) Scheler relates emotions to a hierar-
chy of values. The lowest values belong to something 
as agreeable or disagreeable, which correspond to sen-
sory feelings of enjoyment and endurance; in turn they 
correspond to states of feelings in impressions (sensi-
ble pleasure and pain). Ali these values are aspects of 
sense awareness and are relative. The second modality 
belongs to the domain of vital feelings. This domain in-
cludes what is nob le and common, vigorous and deca-
dent, wholesome and ill, courageous and fearful. The 
third modality belongs to the region of spiritual values. 
These are completely independent of other values and 
appear in pure feelings. Thus in the pure domain of 
AESTHETICS there is the beautiful and the ugly, values 
of truth and falsehood in epistemology, and also joy 
and sadness, the appealing and the unappealing, and 
approval and disapproval. The fourth domain of the 
holy and the unholy and thus passion and doubt, belief 
and unbelief, can be added. 
Emotions that are mental states or moods are to 
be differentiated from value-feelings. The former are 
states of consciousness and are neither essentially nor 
immediately related to anything objective; they are 
feelings or affects in the sense of moods. The latter 
are acts, are essentially related to something objective, 
as is the case with ali feelings ofvalues. In such cases, 
values are the sort of objects proper and peculiar to the 
feeling acts; such feelings encounter value originally. 
They include comparative feelings such as preferences. 
Preferring is an emotional intentiona! act the correlate 
of which is a relation ofbetter to worse or of higher to 
lower between members of a hierarchy of values. Pre-
ferring is not choosing; it belongs to the class of emo-
tions rather than that ofvolitions. Nor can preferring be 
reduced to or derived from intellectual functions such 
as judging and reasoning. Relations between members 
of the value hierarchy, the ordo amoris, can be given 
only emotionally. On the other hand, love and hate are 
not states but acts. As intentiona! acts, love and hate 
respectively extend or restrict the range ofvalues that, 
having been disclosed to the person, are accessible to 
his or her comparative feeling acts. 

EMOTION 
173 
For Scheler, feelings are ofbasically four types. 
( 1) Physical feelings are local and extended within 
the limits of the BODY and are subject to conscious 
intervention and removal by material-medical means. 
These feelings offer no intentiona! direction toward 
values, yet they can be objects of intentiona! regard 
like organs that are relevant for the entire body. 
(2) Vital feelings are not restricted to an organic lo-
cation and hen ce cannot be regarded as extended. Thus 
vigor, strength, health, and weakness do not belong to 
any function, although they are organic in nature. Vital 
feelings are present throughout the body and the body 
appears to us through such feelings. The value-content 
of vital feeling extends to others and to one's own sur-
rounding world rather being limited to the ego's own 
life. 
(3) Psychic feei ing states are direct qualities of the 
EGO. They are related to objects in our surroundings and 
to others, and can be shared. They are intentiona! and 
can be relived and participated in through sympathy. 
Such feelings do not change in correlation with bodily 
changes, since they include imaginary content that is 
relatively independent of corporeal conditions. 
( 4) Spiritual feeling states stem directly from the 
core ofthe person and "radia te" through ali other states. 
Thus despair or blissfulness, or pangs of conscience, 
fi li the entire person and cannot be a result of willful 
intentions. In turn, they are intentiona! states and corre-
late to values. The latter become apparent in the acts of 
preferring and its opposite and in loving and hating. In 
other words, emotional acts are the acts through which 
a priori value contents are given. Yet love is the basic 
spiritual act. and is independent of changing feelings, 
such as sympathy. As an act, love is not a feeling. The 
pursuit of !o ve is expressed through joy, bliss, etc., as 
feei ing variations. Moreover, as revelations of value, 
acts oflove ( and ha te) correlate to and guide the acts of 
preference and rejection. We prefer what we love and 
reject what we hate. 
finally, it may be noted that MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY's first published work dealing with phenomen-
ology- "Christianisme et ressentiment" ( 1935), a re-
view of Scheler's work on ressentiment, which was 
originally published in 1912- upholds the possibility 
of a "phenomenology of the emotional life" and ap-
peals to the phenomenological critique of NATURALISM 
as well as to the phenomenological notions of INTEN-
TIONALITY and EVIDENCE. 
MORITZ GEIGER, whom EDMUND HUSSERL judged to 
be "one quarter phenomenologist," has contributed to 
the phenomenological explication ofthe emotions and 
specifically those that re late to aesthetics. His complex 
analyses distinguish between emotions as interpreted 
from a psychological orientation and emotions consid-
ered from the phenomenological orientation toward an 
aesthetic object. In his "Beitrăge zur Phănomenologie 
des ăsthetishen Genusses" ( 1913) Geiger offers investi-
gations into various distinctions among emotions such 
as enjoyment and its related feelings of pleasure, joy, 
etc. 
Thus while enjoyment is pleasurable, not every 
pleasure is enjoyment. Yet enjoyment is correlated to 
objects: formal objects cannot be enjoyed, while ob-
jects possessing intuitive fullness of content can. With 
respect to activity, enjoyment is a passive receptivity, 
a lack oftaking a stand, a self-surrender to the object. 
Yet the experience of enjoyment appears within the 
sphere of the self and not in the abject, and it usually 
pervades and envelops the self, as is well manifested in 
such modes of enjoyment as being carried away, being 
gripped, entranced, or moved. 
This context provides for the analyses of aesthetic 
enjoyment. This requires a specification: the self must 
assume a certain distance from itself and experience 
various objects- even non-aesthetic objects, such as 
foods and one's own emotions- as enjoyable. The 
aesthetic object, experienced from this distance, must 
offer "intuitive plenitude," and must be regarded by 
se1f-forgetfulness and total focus on the object. This 
"objectcenteredness" is different from the self-centered 
interest in objects for the self-enjoyment they generate. 
Music, for example, can make one "feei good." But so 
can many other things, from wine to eroticism. How-
ever, interest in an object for the sake ofbeing titillated 
is an altogether different matter from enjoyment of an 
object in its own right. Here Geiger would agree with 
Kant's notion of"disinterested pleasure." 
This leads Geiger to articulate depth phenomena 
in contrast to surface feelings. The 1atter belong to 
such phenomenon as thrillers invented for our amuse-
ment, immediate gratification, and pleasant feelings. 
The depth emotions, in contrast, require complex, al-

174 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
though well-founded, phenomena- founded in their 
very structure. First, such emotions are closest to the 
subject; second, they originate at the primordial lay-
ers ofthe subject; third, they are touched by artworks; 
fourth, the subject can become completely immersed in 
these emotions; and fifth, these emotional experiences 
are regarded as significant to the subject. As depth 
phenomena, these emotions are correlated to aesthetic 
objects. Geiger's analyses of the emotions proper to 
aesthetic experience influenced ROMAN INGARDEN's Das 
literarische Kunstwerk (The literary work of art, 1931 ). 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER treats emotion in a general frame-
work of DASEIN as being-in-theworld and specifically 
as Befindlichkeit. This term covers the domain that tra-
ditional thought had relegated to subjective feelings, 
i.e., psychic phenomena, below such epistemic require-
ments as representation and volition. Such phenom-
ena are, at the outset, theoretically redundant. Heideg-
ger rejects, in principle, this prejudgment of emotions 
and begins initially with the notion ofrNTENTIONALITY. 
Emotions are intentiona! because they disclose some-
thing and thus are not states closed upon themselves. 
Thus we are pleased with, sad about, or overjoyed 
with something. In Sein und Zeit ( 1927) Heidegger 
articulates two major emotions, anxiety andfear. Yet 
as aspects of Befindlichkeit they are more than forms 
of intentionality. Befindlichkeit is finding oneself in a 
situation and in a particular state, such as well-being, 
anxiety, or being gripped by fear. But these emotions 
are nota state of mind ( even though Befindlichkeit has 
sometimes been translated as "state-of-mind"). 
We do not project, as ifby some magic, what is "in 
our minds," some subjective emotion, onto an other-
wise indifferent sum of objects. Rather, it is through 
emotions that we find ourselves in a WORLD in which we 
care about things and how we relate to them. Emotion 
is thus a way ofuncovering our position in the context 
of possibilities and facticities of our world. In the emo-
tion of joy something is opened in the world, not with 
an objective property ora subjective projection, but as 
moving me to engage with it in positive ways and plac-
ing it in a context ofpossibilities, projects, and choices. 
This suggests that our involvement in the world (Be-
wandtnis) is primordially enveloped in emotions. The 
latter, as an aspect of Befindlichkeit, is no less basic as 
a way of being-in-the-world than understanding is; it 
is just as crucial to FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY. For Hei-
degger, this way does not yet presume a distinction 
between the state of the individual and the state of the 
world. 
For Dasein, as Befindlichkeit, things matter. In our 
care for the world and ourselves, some things are ad-
vantageous, open horizons of possibilities, others are 
detrimental and closed. Thus Heidegger finds no jus-
tification in treating specific emotions such as fear, or 
more general ones such as mood (Stimmung), as inner 
psychological states. While traditional thought would 
have relegated moods such as boredom, depression, 
and exuberance to subjective states below even such 
emotions as fear, moods are equally worldly. Moods 
reveal how the world is for Dasein. Even dctachment 
is a mood that exposes the world as objective and in-
different to us, and this indifference is of fundamen-
tal concern for Dasein. The argument is pushed by 
Heidegger to the limit in terms of anxiety. The latter 
singularizes Dasein by revealing Dasein's temporality 
as being-toward-death and hence the impossibility for 
anyone, in the final analysis, to die for another. Yet 
this extreme singularity reveals the temporality of ali 
worldly events. For Heidegger, emotions, as modifica-
tions of Befindlichkeit, must be read ontologically as 
modalities of Dasein and world. 
Against ali forms of positivistic PSYCHOLOGY and 
PSYCHIATRY, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE explores the emotions 
from the si de of consciousness. In L 'etre et le neant 
( 1943) he accepts the self-reflective transcendental 
phenomenology of Husserl and also the Heideggerian 
notion ofself-understanding. Emotion, for Sartre, must 
be understood in the context of consciousness as a 
whole in order to decipher the extent to which pure 
psychology could delineate modifications of this very 
consciousness. Moreover, emotions are also regarded 
in the anthropological totality of the human, i.e., self-
understanding in the world. The task that Sartre sees 
is the demonstration ofhow the emotions are tobe ex-
tricated from the causal preconceptions of ali forms of 
positivistic thinking and their intertwining with con-
sciousness. 
While, on one level, Sartre accepts the intentionality 
of consciousness as including the emotions ( e.g., fear 
does not appear as a psychic state, but exhausts itself 
in the fearsome abject), on another level the emotions 
have a spontaneous capacity for instant transforma-
tion of our relationships to ourselves and the world. 

EMOTION 
175 
Such transformations occur in situations that cannot be 
resolved instrumentally and hence require a magica! 
recoloration of consciousness and its relationship to 
the world. 
In his Esquisse d 'une theorie des emotions ( 1939), 
he articulates emotions such as fear, anger, joy, or 
sadness appear as spontaneous degradations of con-
sciousness toward the world. Such emotions are tied 
directly to or blend with bodily expressivity and activ-
ity. Here, for Sartre, such metaphysical notions as the 
unconscious play no role. It is consciousness itselfthat 
thickens and darkens in a synthesis of spontaneity and 
passivity. What releases us from this modification of 
consciousness is a purifying reflection and the disap-
pearance ofthe emotional situation. This means that a 
person is a master ofher or his emotions both in being 
flooded by them and in dispelling them. Causality, for 
Sartre, does not add any relevant understanding, since 
causality also requires consciousness as projecting the 
future and the past. 
It must be emphasized that for Sartre, emotions are 
not to be confused with "inner states" as if conscious-
ness had some sort ofinteriority. Rather, emotion is at-
mospheric; it floods an entire region and breaks down 
ali materiality, e.g., fear already pervades our flight 
from the fearsome. The flight itself feeds on the en-
veloping emotion; the emotion permeates ali objects; 
it is expressed through their looks. A terrifying appari-
tion is no mere physical body but its horrible config-
uration that haunts the surface of the body and floods 
ali, including my own body, with terror. One intensifies 
the other. This means that the emotions are not moved 
by some physiological state but by other emotions. A 
description of pure bodies may function in instrumen-
tal consciousness, but an experience of emotion will be 
moved by the correlative emotional expressivity. The 
look of erotic desire does not demand a body, but calls 
for reciproca! erotic desi re for the expressed desire. 
PAUL RICCEUR articulates emotion as the central ex-
perience in both the epistemic and practica! domains. 
In L 'homme .fallible (Fallible man, 1960) he regards 
knowledge as a result of transcendental syntheses, ar-
ticulated by transcendental reflection in the mode of 
deciphering objective conditions of awareness in cor-
relation to its object. This reflection leads to the discov-
ery of a disproportion between finite perspectivity and 
infinity. The latter is not a transcendent moment, but 
one that transposes any perspective toward universal-
ity, toward signitive intentionality. Yet this movement 
is directly tied to objectivity and belongs to awareness 
in general. Personal consciousness appears only with 
practica! synthesis. It opens the concrete wholeness of 
reality, including its affective domain. 
The site of synthesis is no Ion ger the thing, but the 
human person. Here a practica! split appears between 
a finite character and infinite happiness. The former 
shows the limitations of our open existence, while the 
latter is an aim of ali our strivings. The interioriza-
tion ofthis disproportion appears in the emotional do-
main regarded as affective fragility. This conception 
of emotion as a central place of personal synthesis is 
also designed to test the viability ofthe transcendental 
formation of awareness. 
For Ricceur, knowledge and emotion are mutually 
enlightening. Emotion gives rise to the intention of 
knowledge. The emotional qualities are experienced on 
things, others, and world, and in turn, reveal the man-
ner in which the subject is touched intrinsically. Such 
an indissoluble synthesis between emotion and inten-
tion intimates human belonging to the world named in 
various ways as hyper-predictive, hyper-objective, and 
even hyperreflexive. 
Conversely, knowledge constitutes emotional gra-
dations in correlation to the gradations of objectivities. 
Emotional gradations belong to two main domains. The 
first is sensory striving, which ends in a finite momen-
tary joy; the second is the spiritual striving that reaches 
for an encompassing happiness. These emotional fac-
tors, the bios and the logos, comprising another dis-
proportion, require another emotional mediation by the 
heart. These emotions appear in the strivings for pos-
session, rulership, and values. Yet these strivings ofthe 
heart are not independent of universal happiness. This 
is to say, the economic, politica!, and cultural aims are 
not yet rigidified into greed, but comprise a schema-
tization of happiness. The heart is an indeterminate 
representation of infinite happiness. This domain is 
therefore one of continuous emotional turbulence and 
inner conflict. 
Emotion has also been approached within phe-
nomenologically influenced PSYCHIATRY and pheno-
menological PSYCHOLOGY -
e.g., by ERWIN W. STRAUS, 
who was particularly interested in the expressive 
dimension of emotional life -
and within pheno-

Gemiit ( 1 956)- published in English as Phenomen-
ology of Feefing ( 1 977) -
STEPHAN STRASSER inves-
tigates the treatment of emotion in the works of phe-
nomenologists ( especially Scheler and Sartre) and psy-
chologists; distinguishes various levels and phases per-
taining to the life offeeling; and contributes a series of 
descriptions ofvarious typical forms ofhappiness. 
In a number ofbooks and essays, EUGENE T. GENDLIN 
has developed the notion of a bodily "felt sense" that 
is neither merely a state ofthe physical body (Kărper) 
nor a sensation pertaining to the lived body (Leib), 
but is distinctively intentiona!. lts correlate, however, 
is not some simple "object," nor is it simply some-
thing "perceptual"; rather, it is a felt sense or global 
fecling of a situation as a whole in its pre-conceptual 
intricacy, including its sedimented meanings and its 
implications and possible transformations as well as 
its current affective tone. Such a felt sense is broader 
and richer than an already named "emotion" such as 
anger, though such specific emotions are also situa-
tional. Yet a felt sense can interact with LANGUAGE in 
a productive way: when words succeed in explicating, 
articulating, or lifting something out from the com-
plex texturc of a felt sense, the felt sense itself shifts 
in response. Phenomenologists inftuenced by Gendlin 
include DAVID MICHAEL LEVIN, who a(so discusses the 
ethical and ontologica! significance ofbeing moved to 
te ars. 
More recently, GLEN MAZIS's Emotion and Embod-
iment ( 1993) emphasizes that emotions are modes of 
bodily attunement to, and emeshment with, the lived 
world. Here the world is no longer something to con-
front, comprehend, and control; rather, the ebbing and 
ftowing emotional tones of a landscape or figure, the 
swirling affective currents of an interpersonal situa-
tion, and so on, pul! us in or repe! us, engaging us in the 
primordial movement of being emotionally "moved" 
and revealing the ftuidity and fragility ofthe emotional 
world. 
Finally, phenomenological approaches to emotion 
ha ve also inftuenced more general philosophical works 
on this topic. for exampJe, DIETRICH VON HILDEBRAND 
was inftuenced by Scheler's approach not only in such 
early phenomenological writings as "Die Idee der sit-
tlichen Hand! ung" ( 1 916) and "Sittlichkeit und ethis-
che Werterkenntnis" ( 1922), but also in Das Wesen der 
Liebe (The essence oflove, 1971 ); Robert C. Solomon 
emphasizes the intentionality of emotion in The Pas-
sions ( 1976), which is couched for the most part in 
terms of EXISTENTIALISM; and Quentin Smith critically 
confronts phenomenological work on emotion in The 
Felt Meanings of the World ( 1 986), where he argues 
that a "metaphysics of feeling" must replace a "meta-
physics of reason." 
The phenomenology of emotion, exemplified in the 
writings of the phenomenologists discussed above, 
possesses one common feature: emotions are not psy-
chological states in the immanence of the subject, but 
rather correlate to objectivities ofvarious types and lev-
els. In other words, they are traces ofintentionality. No 
doubt, the extrication of such traces requires method-
ological precision and subject-matter differentiation, 
specifically a differentiation between both metaphysi-
cal and ontologica! positionalities on the one hand and 
signitive intentionalities on the other. This is evident 
even among the phenomenological authors who pro-
pose to ground intentionality in fundamental ontology.

EPOCHE AND REDUCTION 
See LOGICAL POSI-
"Epoche" and 
"reduction" are names of methods used in Husserlian 
phenomenology. Although EDMUND HUSSERL seems to 
have only become aware of these methods in 1905, 
he considered them to have been already implic-
itly at work in his Logische Untersuchungen (1900-
1901 ). While other major phenomenologists ha ve em-
ployed these methods, the treatment here will focus on 
Husserl. 
The word "epoche," from a Greek word that means 
"check" or "cessation," has a wider denotation than 
"reduction." It is used by Husserl to name severa! dif-
ferent operations ali of which involve suspending be-
lief in something, or at least not operating with some 
belief, so as not to rely on that item in the conduct of 
research. For example, Husserl writes in Die Krisis der 
europăischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale 
Phănomenologie ( 1936) of an "epoche of the objec-
tive sciences" that entails not accepting the results of 
those sciences as something phenomenology can build 
upon in developing its own results. JEAN-PAUL SARTRE 
writes of an epoche for ETHICS, and in "On Multiple 
Realties" (1945) ALFRED SCHUTZ, perhaps developing 
remarks in Husserl's Vienna Lecture [1935], describes 
the epoches and reductions required for adopting the 
theoretical, the practica!, and other attitudes. Rather 
than the various other epoches, the "transcendental-
phenomenological epoche" will be the concern here. It 
will be referred to as "the epoche." 
Husserl describes the epoche as a suspending or 
"bracketing" ofthe "general thesis" ofthe natural atti-
tude. This thesis is a beliefthat pervades our conscious-
ness of the world. It is sometimes said to be a belief in 
the "actuality" (Wirklichkeit) ofthe world and at other 
times a belief in the "being on hand" ( Vorhandenheit) 
ofthe world. 
In the Krisis Husserl writes of the "accomplish-
ment of a reduction of 'the' world to the transcenden-
tal phenomenon 'world,' a reduction thus also to its 
correlate, transcendental subjectivity, in and through 
whose 'conscious Iife' the world, valid for us straight-
forwardly and naively prior to ali science, attains and 
always has attained its whole content and ontic valid-
ity." In Cartesianische Meditationen [1931] he writes 
that the "method of transcendental epoche, because 
it leads back to this realm [of transcendental being], 
is called transcendental-phenomenological reduction." 
In remarks like these, he seems to be using "reduc-
tion" in the sense ofthe Latin word "reducere" (to lead 
back). 
The epoche, then, is a way of making the transition

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
from our more normal way of considering conscious-
ness and the world to the properly phenomenological 
way of considering them. Insofar as it discloses to us 
a dimension of our consciousness that was previously 
unnoticed, it is a way of attaining the subject mat-
ter of research. The reduction, on the other hand, is 
what the epoche allows us to gain: reftective aware-
ness ofthe subject matter in the way the subject matter 
is to be regarded in the conduc! of phenomenologi-
cal research. As such, "the reduction" refers to the 
institution of the goal of phenomenological research 
as operative in the consciousness of the researcher. It 
points ahead to the transition into the constitutive inten-
tiona! analyses that make up the ma in work of transcen-
dental phenomenology. Thus Husserl and others speak 
of "performing" the epoche, but of working "under" 
the phenomenological reduction. The transcendental-
phenomenological epoche and reduction, then, is a 
method of bringing the world-constituting dimension 
of consciousness into the purview of reftective intu-
ition, so that the manner of its functioning can be elu-
cidated through constitutive analysis. 
There is a question as to whether the epoche and the 
reduction are the same or different methods. In gen-
eral, as the discussion above indicates, the terms "the 
epoche" and "reduction" seem tobe used by Husserl 
to refer to distinguishable stages ofthe same approach, 
where "reduction" refers to something achieved by the 
epoche. The question, then, is whether there can be the 
epoche without a transcendental reduction and whether 
that which is achieved under the name "the reduction" 
can be achieved in ways other than by the epoche. In 
regard to the former issue, inquiry could be directed 
to the "psychological" (as opposed to a "transcenden-
tal") epoche that Husserl has also discussed. As for the 
other issue, the following discussion may shed some 
light, for it shows that the reduction, as achieved by the 
epoche, brings a certain interest into the conduct ofre-
search and defines the research goal in a particularway. 
That interes! is epistemological. It seems possible for 
the interest that governs phenomenological research 
to be different, which may be the case for phenome-
nologists SUCh as MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY and MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER, insofar as these thinkers can be said to ha ve 
worked under the reduction. 
Husserl points out in ldeen zu einer reinen 
Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 (1913) that the "bracketing" or "suspending" 
that is the epoche is "closely related" to the "neutrality 
modification" to which any doxically positing or be-
lieving consciousness is subject. In general, certainty 
of belief can change into any o ne of a series of modi-
fications that run from near certainty through doubt to 
utter disbelief. Neutralization is not a member of this 
series, but is something to which they are ali subject. It 
is a way of not participating in any of these modes of 
belief concern ing the object of awareness. An example 
would be when we uncritically listen to a lecture and 
merely grasp the thoughts of a speaker for the purpose 
oftaking notes. We may neither agree nor disagree, but 
merely understand what is being said. 
The epoche is like neutra! consciousness ofthis sort, 
but differs from it in an important way. The example 
just given is one of a neutra! "straightforward" act of 
awareness, an act in which we are caught up in experi-
encing something and do not attend to this experienc-
ing itself. The epoche, however, is the neutralization of 
rejfective consciousness, consciousness through which 
we attend to our experiencings of objects and to how 
objects are present to us in these experiencings. Since 
the epoche is the neutralization of a reftective act of 
consciousness, in addition to being neutra] in the same 
sense as any other act, i.e., lacking a position-taking, 
the effect of the neutralization on that which presents 
itself to the neutra] awareness is different from what it 
is in a straightforward act due to the way the reftective 
neutralization is brought about. 
Let the straightforward act being reftected upon be 
a perceiving and contain a believing in the actuality 
of its object. The epoche involves refraining from per-
forming that position-taking or any modalization of it. 
However, the epoche is not a neutrality modification 
of the perceiving (something that, as Husserl notes, 
is perhaps impossible to perform at will). It is not a 
neutralization of that act. But the epoche does involve 
the neutralization of some act. Any neutra] act is a 
neutrality modification with respect to a correspond-
ing positional act, an act that, among other things, has 
the same object as the neutra] act. A neutra] reftection, 
then, is a neutrality modification with respect to a non-
neutra] or doxically positing refiection that grasps the 
same mental process as the reftection. Thus the epoche 
brings about a neutra] reftection that lacks the specific 
doxic positing contained in its non-neutra] reftective

counterpart. But the epoche also involves refraining 
from performing the position-taking ofthe underlying 
grasped act. 
Let us now see how these three acts -
the per-
ception bcing reftected upon, the doxically positional 
reftection upon it, and the latter's neutra! counterpart 
-are related to one another. 
The object of a non-neutra! reftection in "noematic" 
reftection is the object of the straightforward act as 
it appears in that act. Unless there are motives to do 
otherwise, the reftecting contains a believing in the 
actuality of the object and contains that believing by 
participating in the position-taking of the perception. 
The reftecting, of course, need not so assent, but could 
take onan opposing or other moda! variant ofthe po-
sition. It could, for instance, disbelieve in the actuality 
of the object. If it did this, that would not alter the 
ontic character with which the reftected upon object 
appears to the reftecting act, which continues to be 
in force since the originally constituting pcrception 
has not bcen altered in its positional modality. Rather, 
there is a certain overlapping of the two senses, ac-
tual and inactual, the result ofwhich is that the former 
appears to the reftecting act as a mere claim to actu-
ality. Neutralized reftection is different from this. The 
neutra! reftective act does not contain the same posit-
ing as its non-neutra! counterpart. Hence it does not 
contain the same positing as the act reftected upon nor 
any ofthc possible positings that are modalizations of 
the original positing. It has no such positionality and 
thus lays down no such overlapping character. This 
does not mean that it is not positional in any sense. 
It is lacking only the positing of the underlying act or 
any of its variants. However, a neutralized reftection 
does not merely not so posit, it precisely refrains from 
so positing, and it is for this reason that an epoche is 
involved. The refraining has its effect, but its effect is 
not the same as that achieved by the overlappings that 
have just been discussed. The effect is that the ontic 
character correlative to the positing ofthe act reftected 
upon appcars to the reftecting act as a claim (to actu-
ality, in the case of the perceiving), but not as a mere 
claim as in the case of a disbelieving reftection. This is 
because refraining, as such, is an act of a subject who 
feels a pull toward something, and thus acknowledges 
its value, but precisely resists that pull. 
Phenomenology is a science carried out in pursuit 
of certain interests. One of those interests, and the one 
that governed much of Husserl 's work, is to understand 
how cognition, knowledge ofthe world, is "possible." 
For Husserl, this interest took the form of an inquiry 
into the grounds of the EVIDENCE of worldexperience. 
This interest becomes operative within the conduct of 
phenomenological research through the epoche. The 
proper orientation of reftective acts in pursuit of this 
interest requires the refraining that is the epoche. The 
epoche involves a rcfraining that is brought about in 
conscious awareness and acknowledgment of the evi-
dence of PERCEPTJON and is precisely a refraining from 
taking a position with respect to that evidence. This 
refraining exhibits a respect for the evidence of per-
ception, while at the same time it orients itself toward 
seeking the grounds of that evidence, of its validity, 
and of the natural acceptance of its validity in sources 
that do not presuppose any of these. Thus the bulk of 
Husserl's concrete constitutive analyses aims at dis-
closing the subjectivc accomplishments that allow us 
to experience a WORLD that has various ontic "validi-
ties." These investigations are not just of the constitu-
tion of the sense of the world and its objects, but of 
their constitution as valid senses, as accomplishments 
of evidential processcs. 
Ifthere is tobe a reduction without an epoche, then 
other interests come to play whereby the constitutive 
intentiona! analyses yield quite different sets ofresults 
than did Husserl's. It can be left to future research 
to Jook at the work of MARTIN HEIDEGGER, MAURICE 
MERLEAU-PONTY, and others from this point ofview. 
It should be mentioned that there is a broader sense 
of epoche than the one discussed above. The epoche in 
the sense discussed occupies a central ro le within a total 
attitude of research and has, through its central ro le, a 
certain effect on the non-reftective acts (like judgings) 
that help make up the total research performance. It is 
in this respect that the epoche takes on a wider and even 
different sense than neutralization of reftective acts. 
Phenomenology is carried out "in reftection." But 
this "in reftection" has two meanings. Taken in its nar-
row sense, reftection is the intuitive grasping of one's 
own mental process, i.e., reftective acts. But the pheno-
menologist also makes judgments about what is intu-
itively grasped. Judgings are straightforward and not 
reftective acts. Thus the phenomenologist does not al-
ways work through reftective acts. But in a sense one 

180 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
cou1d say that the phenomeno1ogist's work is carried 
out "in reflection" in that the judgments are made with 
an orientation toward reflective acts. The objects about 
which the judgments are made are made available ex-
clusively through acts of reflection and reflective acts 
are resorted to for the ultima te verification of mediate 
judgments. The judgings must respect the neutrality of 
the reflective acts by not asserting any ofthe positions 
that the reflective acts refrain from taking. The judg-
ings assert other positions, though, and thus are not 
themselves neutra] acts. Thus in a derivative sense, the 
epoche is also carried out in these acts.

HUSSERL himself published almost nothing on ethics. 
An exception is the third article in the series of arti-
cles on "renewal" that he published in the Japanese 
journal The Kaizo. This article deals with "renewal as 
a problem of individual ethics" and summarizes part 
of Husserl's !ater thought on ethics. It originally ap-
peared only in Japanese. The ma in source of Husserl 's 
ethics is the manuscripts of his courses on axiology 
and ethics. There are manuscript notes from his ear-
lier Jecture courses on axiology and ethics from 1902, 
1908-9, 1911, and 1914. The extensive notes of his 
newly conceived !ater Jecture course on ethics from 
1920 have not yet been edited; of the ]ater sources, 
only the Kaizo material has been published so far. Be-
sides the rather systematic expositions in the form of 
lecture courses, he produced a considerable number of 
research manuscripts that deal with various aspects and 
problems of a phenomenological foundation of ethics. 
Husserl's main concern in his earlier, prewar 
Gottingen ethics is the refutation of ethical relativism 
and skepticism. Ethical relativism and skepticism seem 
unavoidable if ethics is founded in feelings, because 
feelings are supposedly radically subjective. There 
would beat most a purely factual and therefore acci-
dental agreement in emotional responses. David Hume 
grounds ethics in such a factual agreement of how we 
feei and emotionally respond to the character and be-
havior of others. But such a factual agreement is no 
guarantee for objective validity. Can the moral dissi-
dent, Husserl asks, not be right in the face of the pre-
vailing moral consensus? From this failure of Hume 
and the moraJ-sense-ethics of BRITISH MORAL THEORY 
to secure the strict universality and objectivity of the 
morallaw, KANT drew the conclusion that ethics has to 
be grounded in pure practica! reason and its a priori 
law, which is indifferent to the subjective feelings and 
inclinations. According to Husserl, however, Kant's 
doctrine of the categorica] imperative is an "abstruse 
formalism" and a "paradigm for a transcendental rea-
soning from above." 
Against such an ethics from above Husserl urges 
an ethics from below, an ethics founded in the pheno-
menological description and analysis of the acts of 
consciousness and their correlative NOEMATA as where 
the evaluational and ethical concepts originate. One of

ETHICS IN HUSSERL

the immediate and most fundamental intuitive insights 
of such a phenomenological analysis of consciousness 
is the impossibility of an act ofwilling that is not mo-
tivated by a VALUE-feeling. An abject must affect us 
emotionally; otherwise, there is no inducement what-
ever, no motive for us to strive for it or to avoid it. A 
pure willling free of ali value-feeling is, according to 
Husserl, just as nonsensical as a color without exten-
sion. A priori and eidetically, each subject of willing 
has tobe a subject ofvalue-feeling. 
Values are ultimately experienced and given in 
value-feelings. Hume was therefore right: without the 
heart and its value-feelings we would not and could 
not distinguish between good and bad. Without feel-
ings we have no moral judgments. The fundamental 
challenge for Husserl is then how to reconcile the ob-
jective validity of ethics with its ultimate foundation in 
value-feelings. To talk of objective validity for Husserl 
means to talk of rational insight into what is true and 
what is false. The objective validity of ethics then pre-
supposes that rationality and REASON are not limited to 
the judging and theorizing intellect. The heart and the 
will too must have their analogous but specific forms 
ofrationality. It must be possible to categorize the acts 
of feeling and willing themselves, and not only their 
foundational acts of knowing, under the opposites of 
true and false, insightful and blind. 
In his three lectures on axiology and ethics from 
1908-9, 1911, and 1914 Husserl seeks to develop the 
main features of a phenomenological theory ofvaluing 
and willing-acting reason by employing the "method 
of analogy." Following this method, Husserl wants to 
show above ali that in analogy to pure, formal LOGIC, 
and also FORMAL ONTOLOGY, there are also a purely 
formal axiology and a purely formal praxiology. Just 
as there are a priori formal conditions in the form of 
formal logica! laws for the rationality and objective 
validity ofpredicative and logica! acts, so too are there 
a priori formal conditions in the form of formal axi-
ologica! and formal practica! laws for the rationality 
and objective validity of evaluative and practica! acts. 
These latter laws comprise the field ofresearch of new 
formal disciplines that- according to Husserl- ha ve 
never been conceptualized in the tradition. 
Formal axiology and praxiology lead to the formal-
categorica! imperative "Do the best that is attainable!" 
as a purely formal determinati an of volitional correct-
ness. This highest formal practica! principle rests on 
the law of absorption. "The best is the enemy of the 
good." The best attainable is not merely the best com-
paratively speaking, but rather the sole practica! good. 
The formal conditions of rational willing can be sum-
marized as follows: willing must aim at its own prac-
tica! possibilities; it must grasp the entire realm of its 
practica! possibilities, and from ali the values therein 
find, choose, and try to realize the highest value. 
Formal axiology and formal praxiology are only the 
first and basic stage of a phenomenological theory of 
axiologica! and practica! reason. The higher, and for 
the practica! end of guiding action, the more essential 
and important stage is the exposition of a theory of 
material a priori values and purposes. Husserl never 
dealt with this material a priori part ofhis axiology and 
ethics systematically. He usually distinguishes between 
the sensuous, hedonistic values and the spiritual val-
ues. Regarding the latter, he distinguishes three broad 
kinds: science, art, and the rational love of self and 
neighbor. Occasionally RELIGION is added as a fourth 
kind. Corresponding to Husserl's distinction between 
subjective and objective spirit, there is a distinction to 
be made between subjective spiritual values in the form 
of theoretical, axiologica!, practica!, and, for Husserl, 
even religious acts of reason, on the o ne hand, and the 
correlative objective spiritual values in the form ofthe 
spiritual-ideal objective goods of cui ture (i.e., a theory, 
a work of art) on the other. As far as a hierarchy of 
values is concerned, for Husserl there is a clear order 
of rank only between the sensuous and the spiritual 
values -
the first have only instrumental value for 
making possible the second; among the spiritual val-
ues themselves, no such definite and generally valid 
rank is established. 
Husserl's prewar Gottingen ethics remains mainly 
within the purely formal determinati an of "volitional 
correctness" and the highest practica! good. For him, 
there can be no truly scientific ethics without the clear 
distinction between formal and material principles. He 
viewed the discovery and elaboration of formal ax-
iology and formal praxiology as his most important 
contribution to ethics. He saw himself do ing for ethics 
what Aristotle had done for logic. 
A truly scientific ethics for Husserl has to be an 
ethics from below, that is, the formal and material prin-
ciples of such an ethics have to be grounded in the 

182 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
phenomenological description by EIDETIC METHOD of 
the various acts ofthe heart and ofthe will in which in-
trinsic and extrinsic values and goods, ends and means 
are initiated and executed. He subscribes to the Kantian 
classification ofthe acts of consciousness into intellec-
tive acts, valuing acts of feei ing, and acts of willing. 
Basically there exists a one-sided foundational rela-
tion between acts of these three kinds: acts of willing 
are necessarily founded in acts ofvalue-feeling, which 
in turn necessarily presuppose an intellective act, be 
it a presentation or a judgment. The intellective act 
presents a real matter or a state of affairs in its purely 
factual-natural determinations and the act of value-
feeling discovers the axiologica! determinations ofthe 
pregiven thing or state of affairs, a discovery that in turn 
can motivate an act of will. This basic schema of the 
foundational relation between the three kinds ofacts is 
inserted into the larger framework of the teleological 
character of consciousness by Husserl 's discovery of a 
form ofwilling in the form of a striving ora tendency at 
the core of consciousness and as a universal character 
of ali acts. 
Value-feelings and consequently acts ofwilling are 
dependent on intellective acts in yet another sense. 
Value-feelings and acts ofwilling are non-objectivating 
acts. Without objectivating intellective acts they are, 
according to Husserl, in a certain sense "blind and 
dumb." The axiologica! and practica! objects and pred-
icates that are constituted in the acts ofthe heart and of 
the will are fully given as such objects and predicates 
only in subsequent predicative acts of objectivation and 
thematization. In this sense, logical-theoretical reason 
enjoys a certain primacy over axiologica! and practi-
ca! reason. In another sense, however, Husserl stresses 
how axiologica! and practica! reason encompass theo-
retical reason: theory itself is an axiologica! and prac-
tica! object, and the theoretical acts can be regarded 
as mental actions. One has to be careful, though, not 
to confuse quite different albeit analogous or related 
forms of willing and acting. The teleological striving 
that belongs to ali forms of consciousness is nota will-
ing in the same sense as thefiat that precedes an action 
or the action-willing itself, which are both different 
again from the spontaneity of an act of predication. 
The precise differentiation between these and other 
forms of willing and their interrelationship requires 
great phenomenological ski!!. 
The world of our everyday life is a world ofvalue-
objects, objects o fuse, tools, works of art, etc. We can, 
of course, abstract from the axiologica! and practica! 
predicates, e.g., of a table ora statue, and focus on the 
purely natural-material properties ofthese objects. This 
is the fOCUS of the NATURAL SCIENCES and NATURALISM. 
But we can equally focus in a purely theoretical way 
on the axiologica! and practica! objects. This then is 
the fOCUS ofthe SO-called HUMAN SCIENCES or CULTURAL 
DISCIPLINES. The sensuous properties of an object are 
originally given in perception. According to Husserl, 
the axiologica! characteristics are originally given in 
value-feelings, the practica! characteristics in acts of 
willing. For modern objectivist-physicalist natural sci-
ence ali three characteristics are radically subjective. 
Knowledge of axiologica! characteristics and value-
objects presupposes emotional value-apperception. 
Husserl did not have a uniform conception of this 
value-apperception and correspondingly he did not 
have a uniform conception of the ontologica! status 
ofthe axiologica! characteristics. Rather, two different 
conceptions can be distinguished. According to one 
conception, the axiologica! characteristics are nonnat-
ural properties ofthe object that are originally given in 
a kind of emotional value-perception (Wertnehmung) 
besides and in analogy with the natural-sensuous prop-
erties that are originally given in ordinary perception 
( Wahrnehmung). According to the other conception, 
which is particularly prominent in Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 ( 1913), the axiologica! characteristics are analo-
gous to the doxic modalities like "probable" or "doubt-
ful," and the acts of the heart and the will are axio-
logica! and practica! position-takings alongside and in 
analogy to the doxic position-takings. Both of these 
conceptions on their own are equally inadequate for 
a full phenomenological account of axiologica! and 
practica! reason, nor can they simply be joined to each 
other in analogy to the relation between perception and 
judgment in theoretical reason. 
In employing the "method of analogy," Husserl 
takes the structure oftheoretical reason, the way natural 
objects are constituted, given, posited, andjudged, and 
the way theoretical knowledge claims are justified, as 
paradigmatic for his analysis of axiologica! and prac-
tica! reason. But as his many very rich descriptions of 
the various acts of the heart and the will and of the 

ETHICS IN HUSSERL 
183 
constitution of axiologica! and practica! objects show, 
it is not easy to make distinctions between passivity 
and activity, receptivity and spontaneity, that exactly 
mirror those in the intellect. What is at stake here is 
Husserl's fundamental claim of an ultimate unity of 
reason in a plurality ofkinds ofreason. 
Husserl's prewar Gottingen ethics is grounded in 
axiology: in each practica! situation I have to tind, 
choose, and try to realize the highest possible objec-
tive value that is attainable forme. Husserl's postwar 
Freiburg ethics goes beyond this narrow axiologica!, 
i.e., utilitarian and economica!, conception of the eth-
ical life. His mature conception of the ethical life is 
grounded in his theory of personal identity. I have a 
unified self and a personal identity through the per-
sistence of acquired habits, attitudes, tastes, projects, 
and convictions. Besides my natural inclinations, abil-
ities, talents, and gifts in primary passivity, I acquire 
habits, attitudes, and convictions as a secondary pas-
sivity through the sedimentation ofmy position-taking 
acts. The unity and identity of the self is in continuous 
development. New position-takings, guided and influ-
enced but never necessitated by our past sedimented 
Iife, confirm and reinforce, modify, or change our past 
convictions. Whenever 1 change one ofmy convictions, 
I change myself. 
As the phenomenological analysis of the constitu-
tion ofthe personal selfshows, I am to a certain degree 
myself responsible for the unity, identity, and char-
acter of my personal being. Consciously to embrace 
this responsibility and to try to meet its demands is, 
according to Husserl in his !ater ethics, the essence 
of the ethical life and will. The mature ethical person 
sees him- or herself as the subject of a unified life that 
he or she wants to give an ethical form. Such persons 
place themselves and their whole li ve underthe formal-
categorica! imperative of rational self-determination. 
The ethicallife begins with a solemn decision that en-
compasses one's entire future life: from now on my 
life shall no longer be merely one of drifting, but a 
life determined solely by my own critically tested and 
insightful position-takings, a life that is based on a 
completely good theoretical, axiologica!, and practica! 
conscience, a life with no regrets. 
This general and formal determination ofthe ethical 
life as a life of rational self-determination in Husserl's 
!ater ethics is still consistent with the formal determi-
nation of volitional correctness in a practica! situation 
of his earlier ethics. There is, however, an important 
consideration in Husserl 's !ater ethics that leads away 
from these purely formal determinations of the ethi-
callife and ofvolitional correctness. According to this 
consideration, the ethical will is the result of an ethical 
EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION in which J critically reflect on 
the whole ofmy life, and in which I take stock ofmy-
self, of my primary and secondary passivity. in order 
to discover my individual ethical vocation. 
In his !ater Freiburg ethics, Husserl separates ethics 
from axiology in the sense that he no Jonger conceives 
of the ethical task in terms of the realization of the 
highest possible amount of objective values. Ethical 
values are not the objective values of formal and mate-
rial axiology; rather they are absolute personal values. 
Every person, according to Husserl, receives, from the 
depth of one's personality, one's own absolute values, 
one's values of love. These personal values detine my 
individual ethical task and project, my ethical ideal, my 
ideal selfand my own true "I," which I am called upon 
to realize. To go against the absolute ought of such a 
value is to be untrue to myself, to Iose myself, and to 
betray myseif. Over and against such an absolute value 
that is rooted in the self, an objective value counts for 
nothing. Absolute vaiues are unconditional values, val-
ues that are incommensurate both among themselves 
and with objective values. When I have to choose be-
tween two absolute vaiues, I do not give preference to 
the higher value over the lower one, but rather- as 
Husserl puts it-I sacrifice one absolute value for the 
sake of the other. 
Self-realization, self-preservation, and seif-perfec-
tion are the tel os of the ethical life in Husserl 's !ater 
ethics. But our personal and ethical life is necessarily 
a life in common. We live together, not beside each 
other but in and through each other. We communicate 
with each other through social acts, we work together, 
we support, help, and criticize each other. Our indi-
vidual destinies are intertwined in a common life with 
its common tasks and projects. Individual and social 
ethics are therefore inseparable. The ideal and te/os of 
the ethicallife is the ethical community as a universal 
community oflove where we freely and lovingly coop-
erate and help each other to realize our own true selves. 
The self-realization of each member ofthe community 
is dependent on the level of self-realization of ali the 

184 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
other members. We ali fail or succeed together. 
The "we" of the truly cooperative common life is, 
according to Husserl, an analogue of a person, a per-
sonality of a higher order. It is a "many-headed, and 
yet united subjectivity" not apart from and superior to 
the individual members, but functioning as a synthetic 
unity and communalization ofthe individual ideals and 
perspectives. Such a person of a higher order has its 
ideal form in what Husserl calls the godly person of 
a higher order, the ideal ethical community where the 
ideal true selves of each are individually and mutually 
recognized and realized, but above ali loved by ali as 
adumbrations of such a godly personality of a higher 
order. 
As JAMES G. HART has shown, Husserl 's !ater ethics 
cannot be fully understood apart from his theory of 
personal identity, his theory of intersubjectivity, and 
above ali his account of the teleological character of 
transcendental consciousness, which in turn is closely 
linked to his theological thought and his conception of 
God. Finally, a certain unresolvcd tension in Husserl's 
!ater ethical thought has to be noted. It is the ten-
sion between, on the one hand, a rationalistic ethics 
that is grounded in a universalistic Kantian concep-
tion of rationality and that sees rational-scientific self-
determinati an in a humanity of reason as the telos of 
thc ethical life and, on the other hand, an ethics of 
absolute personal values and of love.

ETHICS IN SARTRE 
ULLRICH MELLE 
Husserl Archie/ Leuven 
His failure to publish the 
ethics promised at the conclusion of L 'etre et le neant 
( 1943) has kept .IEAN-PAUL SARTRE from being acknow]-
edged as a phenomenological ethicist. The posthumous 
pub1ication ofhis Cahiers pour une morale [ 194 7--48], 
though sketchy and incomplete, does much to rem-
edy that situation by providing the positive content for 
Sartre's previously published remarks on ethical tap-
ies. After some initial observations regarding Sartre 
and phenomenology in general, I shall discuss severa! 
cardinal theses of his moral theory from a phcnomen-
ological perspective, concluding with summaries of 
each of his so-called three attempts to construct an 
ethics. 
From the moment of his famous initial encounter 
with phenomenology in a con versation with Raymond 
Aran ( 1905-1983 ), Sartre resonated with this new 
method of do ing "concrete" philosophy. He insisted on 
the INTENTIONALITY of consciousness with a thorough-
ness that left even Husserl, in his view, a prisoner of 
the "illusion of immanence." The strength of Sartre's 
phenomenology -
namely, its circumvention of the 
realist-idealist epistemology and metaphysics -
en-
tails as well its abiding weakness: the relation between 
the "given" and the "taken" remains irreducibly am-
biguous. This will have important consequences for 
his evolving ethical theory. In sum, socio-economic 
conditions (the "given") play a far greater role in his 
second ethic than in his earlier ethic of authenticity. 
Sartre employs the canonica! phenomenological

of consciousness to the thing rather than the converse." 
So an EIDETIC METHOD culminating in the immediate 
grasp of the ei dos or intelligible contour of the abject

tive reconstructions aimed at making essential features

of a certain kind of activity evident. In other words, 
Sartre 's closely detailed observations frequently are his 
"arguments." In this, he consciously imitated Husserl 's 
famous disciple, MAX SCHELER, whose work Sartre had 
studied while in residence at the Maison Franc;aise 
in Berlin ( 1933-34 ): "As Scheler has shown, I can 
achieve an intuition ofvalues in terms of concrete ex-
emplifications." As befits an author awarded a Nobel 
Prize (which, however, he refused), Sartre's gift for 
apt and arresting examples lends his writing a con-
crete evidence that, he hopes, speaks for itself. Even 
the "progressive-regressive method" that characterizes 
his more dialectica! approach in !ater life requires as 
its first phase a phenomenological description of the 
mattcr to be explained. 
Though he regularly appeals to an existential-
phenomenological schema, Sartre, like MARTIN HEIDEG-
GER, SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, 
rejects as idealist the Husserlian reduction to a tran-
scendental EGO. Nonetheless, he employs the EPOCHE 
AND REDUCTION or "bracketing of being" in a way that 
respects the · "phenomenon of being" in its brute fac-
ticity, viz., as revelatory ofthe transphenomenal being 
of thc phenomenon or being-in-itself. In fact, his mas-
terwork, L 'etre et le neant, subtitled "An Essay on 
Phenomenological Ontology," turns on descriptions of 
those special phenomena ofbeing such as boredom or 
nausea that give us immediate access to transphenom-
enal being. In other words, "EXISTENTIAL" PHENOMEN-
OLOGY, not unlike "Kantian" metaphysics, employs the 
adjective to Jimit, ifnot to undermine, the adequacy of 
the substantive. Sartre 's use of the epoche was always 
problematic. 
Ever the moralist, he extends epoche and reduction 
to the ethical in the Cahiers: "Any ethics that mutilates 
life is suspect. Just as the phenomenologicalepoche ac-
cord ing to Husserl does not remove any nuance ofthe 
world, the ethical epoche must not remove any nuance 
ofhuman life." Carefully distinguishing the "certain" 
from the "probable" in his descriptive analyses, Sartre 
intends to bring the phenomena to our attention with 
the force of immediate EVIDENCE. He reads the epoche 
existentially as an exercise of the freedom at work in 
our conscious being-in-the-world. Because human re-
ality is "in situation" (an ambiguous blend of facticity 
and transcendence, the given and the taken), because 
an inner distance (the temporal ecstasis) that he calls 
"nothingness" separates consciousness from the world, 
and because whatever quality one might ascribe to me 
is always mine in the manner of my not-being it, it is 
ever possible forme to "bracket" that relationship in a 
reflective act that Sartre terms non-accessory or "puri-
fying" reflection: "It is the setting within parentheses, 
not ofthe world (for doubt is impossible given sensory 
intuition), but ofthe world's signification." 
As he explains, somewhat paradoxically, in the 
Cahiers, "the epoche has already to be present in the 
natur/iche Einstellung [natural attitude] or, to put it an-
other way, incarnated freedom has to be penetrated by 
absolute freedom. That is, we have to recognize that 
man both is and is not what he is .... If the epoche 
can always be carried out, this is because it is always 
happening." For example, "desire as consciousness of 
the choice to desire includes within itselfin a nonthetic 
form its possibility ... of catharsis." Earlier, in L 'etre et 
le neant, he says: "The pure, permanent possibility of 
nonaccessory reflection [the epoche] is disquieting and 
a risk of anxiety to the very extent that choice wants 
tobe choice," and, significantly, the basis ofthe reduc-
tive act is ontologica!, namely, that inner distance or 
presence-to-selfthat grounds human freedom: "Man is 
free because he is nota self but a presence-to-self." 
Sartre's early Husserlian reflection, "La transcen-
dence de l'ego" (1936), not only defends what ARON 
GURWITSCH calls a "non-egological" conception of con-
sciousness, but attributes to Husserl a characteristically 
moral motive for performing the epoche, namely, the 
need to face freely the anguish of our freedom that 
the natural attitude seeks to escape via flight into a 
substantive ego or self. Even at this early stage, the 
epoche is emerging as the instrument of liberation 
from alienation and the key to authenticity. Its function 
is more ethical than epistemic. In subsequcnt works 
Sartre sometimes speaks of it as an "awakening," a 
"catharsis," or a "conversion." Although he comes to 
appreciate and underscore the socio-economic condi-
tions for its exercise, epoche or "purifying reflection," 
as it comes to be called, nonetheless remains an indi-
vidual act and a constant possibility for which each is 
responsible. He discusses it at greatest length in the 
Cahiers. 
At least five concepts serve as essential ingredients 
in Sartre's moral philosophy, namely, "freedom," "bad 
faith," "authenticity," "gift-appeal," and "fraternity." 

186 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
The first three are nearly synonymous with Sartrean 
EXISTENTIALJSM. The last two, developed respectively in 
the Cahiers and the Critique de la raison dialectique 
( 1960/85), are less familiar but equally integral to a 
Sartrean ethic in each phase of its evolution. 
As is well known, "freedom" centers the circle of 
Sartre's thought. If Sartre is the philosopher of free-
dom, the career of the concept of "freedom" exactly 
parallels his philosophical development from individ-
ualistic philosopher of consciousness ("freedom as 
the definition of the human") to committed social ac-
tivist ("one cannot be free [ concretely] until everyone 
is free"). The phenomenological descriptions of the 
"consciousness-freedom-responsibility" triad in L 'etre 
el le neant form the skeleton for interpersonal (i.e., 
moral) relationships that Sartre will ftesh out in sub-
sequent works. Only in the rather unguarded and in-
choate remarks of his lecture L 'existentialisme est un 
humanisme (1946) does he openly speak of freedom 
as a "value," indeed, as the foundational value that we 
must choose if we are to chose anything whatsoever. 
Having approved Scheler's theory that we intuit val-
ues in concrete exemplifications in L 'el!·e et le neant, he 
proceeds in this public lecture to speak ofthe necessity 
"at every instant to perform actions that are examples." 
He insists that "there is not o ne of our acts that, in cre-
ating the man we wish to be, does notat the same time 
create an image of man such as we judge he ought to 
be." But in addition to giving a content to Sartrean for-
malism, these "value-images" invest individual choice 
with collective import: "1 create a certain image ofthe 
man that 1 choose; choosing myself, 1 choose man." 
It is this Schelerian move more than his better known 
but much criticized appeal to Kantian universalizabil-
ity in the lecture that breaks the individualist impasse 
of Sartre's vintage existentialist ethic and helps open 
its social dimension. 
But Sartre's implicit appeal to Scheler in this context 
was neither unprecedented nor ad hoc. In his posthu-
mously published Carnets de la drâle de guerre [ 1939-
40], he had written: "Reading Scheler made me under-
stand that there existed values. Basically, until then, 
quite absorbed by the metaphysical doctrine of salva-
tion, I'd never really understood the specific problem 
ofmorality. The 'ought-to-be' seemed to me tobe rep-
resented by the categorica! imperative; and since 1 re-
jected the latter, it seemed to me that l rejected the 
former with it. But when I'd understood that there ex-
isted specific natures, equipped with an existence as of 
right, and called values; when I'd understood that these 
values, whether proclaimed or not, regulated each of 
my acts and judgments, and that by their nature they 
'ought-to-be': then the problem became enormously 
more complex." 
And in his Cahiers he appeals to three of the ax-
ioms of Scheler's non formal ethics concern ing value-
realization as he attempts to formulate a theory that 
recognizes personal freedom realizing its ends as a 
value a priori: "1 take it that what is wanted by one 
freedom must be accepted as such by other freedoms, 
simply because it is a freedom that wants it." Some-
what )ater in the same text he uses phenomenological 
discourse to amplify what we may caii his "universal 
freedom conditiona)," namely, that 1 cannot be free in 
any concrete sense unless ali people are free: "Ifl grasp 
my freedom in a fulfilled intuition as both the source 
of ali my projects and requiring universal freedom, 1 
cannot think of destroying the freedom of others." 
Perhaps Sartre's major legacy to the vocabulary of 
moral psychology is the concept ofbad faith, an expres-
sion he considered weakly analogous to Scheler's "man 
ofressentiment." A form ofself-deception, grounded in 
the ontologica) dividedness ofhuman reality as factic-
ity/transcendence and as presence-to-self, bad faith is a 
kind oftruncated knowledge, an ignorance that knows 
better. As such, it lends itself to arresting phenomen-
ological descriptions ofthe kind Sartre paints in L 'etre 
et le neant. He reads the phenomenon of resistance in 
Sigmund Freud's PSYCHOANALYSIS, for example, as ev-
idence of bad faith. In this case the "censor" itself is 
in bad faith since it both "knows" pre-reftectively and 
does not know reftectively what "unconscious" mate-
rial it is repressing. Ifthe inner distance that conscious-
ness generates is the ontologica) basis ofbad faith in its 
fundamental form, the fact of our "being-for-others," 
our social selves, opens us to another kind ofbad faith, 
namely, the widespread desi re tobe what others take us 
tobe. His descriptions of the "perfect waiter," the ho-
mosexual, and the woman being seduced are paradigms 
of the "lie" to oneself that he terms bad faith. Indeed, 
his multivolume study of Flaubert and his age extends 
the Weltanschauung ofbad faith to an entire society. 
If there is any properly existentialist "virtue," it is 
authenticity. Like its antithesis, bad faith, authenticity 

ETHICS IN SARTRE 
187 
is grounded in the dividedness ofhuman reality that "is 
what it is not'' and "is not what it is" (its facticity and 
transcendence respectively). But whereas the person 
in bad faith denies this basic truth about itself, which 
we might call its "ontologica! freedom" in the sense of 
"non-self-coincidence," the authentic individual lives 
its condition fully. This means that authenticity sus-
tains the tension of its continuous "could be other" 
at every moment of its existence. But this sustained 
choice is not a nominalism, as some have suggested. 
For example, "it is notat ali a question ofreducing our 
friendship to a succession of instants," Sartre assures 
us, "but rather of considering its unifying theme as an 
intentiona] choice ta do something (to make a friend-
ship) and, from this perspective, to allow each moment 
its concrete development." The price of authentic !iv-
ing is the famous existential Angst, which is both an 
immediate awareness of our ontologica] freedom and 
the experience of our future as possibility. Ifbad faith 
is a kind of lie, authenticity entails accepting the truth 
about our divided selves. But authenticity is more a 
"truth to" than a "truth about" in that it requires our 
practica! commitment, not just a national assent. So 
the objection that Sartrean authenticity has no content 
misses the mark, for it overlooks at least this anguished 
"choice of ontologica! freedom" as well as the concrete 
"freedom of others" discussed above. 
Essential to the elaborati an of a Sartrean ethic are 
the correlatives, gift and appeal ("In every appeal there 
is a gift"). Adopted from his AESTHETICS (by an act 
of creative generosity, the artist invites the spectator 
freely to re-create the aesthetic object by means ofthe 
artwork), the gift-appeal relationship, especially in the 
Cahiers, becomes paradigmatic offree communication 
among freedoms: "The appeal is the recognition of a 
personal freedom in a situation by a personal freedom 
in a situation." In this dyad, aesthetics, ethics, and ex-
istential freedom coalesce. Though there are forms of 
gift-giving that enslave (Sartre cites the potlatch made 
famous by the anthropologist Marcel Mauss [ 1872-
1950]) and appeals that dominate (an "appeal in bad 
faith lacks the structure ofthe gift, that is, the recogni-
tion of the other's freedom"), the gift-appeal relation-
ship that he extends from aesthetics to ethics (friend-
ship) and politics (the pledged group, freedoms recog-
nizing one another) respects and enhances the values 
of positive reciprocity and mutuality. "When the gift 
is given between equals without reciproca! alienation," 
Sartre explains, "its acceptance is as free, disinterested, 
and unmotivated as the gift itself. Like the gift, it is 
freeing. This is the case in an evolved civilization for 
the gift of the work of art to a spectator." But, he in-
sists, "relations among men must be based upon this 
[gift-appeal] model ifmen want to exist as freedom for 
o ne another," namely, "by the intermediary ofthe work 
(technical as well as aesthetical, politica!, etc.) ... the 
work always being considered as a gift." This crucial 
mediation of"the work" is overlooked by those, includ-
ing Sartre himself, who contrast his !ater, "materialist" 
ethic with this earlier, "idealist" project. 
Mutuality suggests commitment to "fratemity," the 
last ofthe value-concepts in Sartre 's ethical theory that 
we shall consider. In the final interview given before 
his death, Sartre admitted to Benny Levy, "1 still don't 
see clearly the real relationship between violence and 
fratemity." This remained his abiding challenge as he 
attempted to develop an ethic of the "we" toward the 
end ofhis life. If descriptions of an "ethic of violence" 
abound in the Cahiers and in the Critique, where they 
are sustained by the "transcendental fact" of material 
scarcity as their necessary condition, only in the latter 
does Sartre elaborate the ethical ideal of "fraternity" 
as the relationship that obtains once scarcity is over-
come, if only temporarily in the spontaneously fusing 
group. In a curious mixture of Hobbesian realism and 
Rousseauian idealism, he describes the relationship of 
"fratemity-terror" that binds together the sworn group, 
once its externa! opposition has been overcome. Each 
binds him- or herself via an oath to the death to func-
tion as "the same ... here" for "the other ... there," 
like team members in an athletic match. 
"What is this relationship between one human being 
and another that will be called fraternity?" he asks, and 
answers: "It is not the relation of equality. It is a rela-
tionship in which the motivations for an act come from 
the affective realm, while the action itselfis in the prac-
tica! domain. Which is to say the relationship between 
a man and his neighbor in a society in which they are 
brothers is, first of ali, affective/practical. Originally, 
people shared awareness of that, you might say, but 
now it is a gift that has tobe red1scovered." He posits 
"true fraternity," as previously he spoke of "true his-
tory," as the realizati an of full humanity-an ideal for 
striving in our battle against scarcity. When asked what 

188 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
today prefigures this end result, Sartre answers: "The 
fact that there is a morality." Indeed, the moral has as-
sumed the character of mutual concern as well as pos-
itive reciprocity: the gift-appeal relationship has been 
Iinked to socio-economic conditions. Not that Sartre 
has simply accepted the package of economic deter-
minism, he never did, but his realism counsels him to 
respect the "violence" inscribed in interpersonal rela-
tions "mediated" by material scarcity. This remained 
the ethical problem for the existentialist who would not 
sacrifice one freedom to another, not even for the sake 
of the "city of ends." 
It is now common to speak ofSartre's three ethics, 
the best known and most fully developed being his 
existentialist ethics of disalienation or authenticity, de-
pending on whether one views it from a negative or 
a positive perspective. A more individualistic ethic 
of commitment to freedom, first o ne 's own and then 
the other's, this ethic stresses the overcoming ofthose 
forms ofbad faith to which human reality seems prone, 
either because of its intrinsic dividedness as factic-
ity/transcendence (as he implies in L 'etre et le neant) 
or because ofthe socio-economic exploitation and op-
pression engendered by scarcity of material goods (as 
the Critique and subsequent writings insist). 
In the 1960s Sartre prepared notes for what has been 
termed his "dialectica! ethics." A review of these un-
published manuscripts reveals a basic concern with the 
ideal of "integral humanity" and its counterconcept, 
"subhumanity." The Iatter denotes ourselves as sub-
ject to a rule-driven ethic, where values ha ve hardened 
into impersonal norms. In the language ofthe Critique 
employed in these pages, the ethical dialectic obtains 
between "praxis" and the "practico-inert." The former 
denotes purposive human activity in its socio-historical 
context, the latter those sedimented past practices that 
direct, limit, deflect, and invert our present activities. 
The ethics of NATURALISM and STRUCTURALISM re late to 
moral praxis in precisely this practica-inert manner. 
The ethical project that Sartre recommends is simply 
to historicize these timeless, repetitive norms in favor 
of "praxis of ali people in association" to perpetually 
create and re-create "integral humanity." His emphasis 
on work as the model of praxis gives this agonistic 
ethic a certain socialist, not to say "MARXIST," flavor. 
As in his earlier works, Sartre's method is a mixture 
of phenomenological description of moral experience 
as such and appeal to the "conditions of the possibil-
ity" of that experience (what, echoing Kant, he calls 
the "regressive" or "analytic" method). To this he joins 
the "progressive" or historical moment of the ethical 
experience of specific groups of individuals. For exam-
ple, he describes the Iived experience ofthose Belgian 
mothers who killed their thalidomide-deformed babies. 
His point is to illustrate the dilemma of moral conflict 
between ethical norms and historical praxis (reminis-
cent ofhis injunction years before to "invent" or create 
in the case of moral indeterminacy): human life is an 
absolute value but only insofar as it makes integral hu-
manity possible. As always, Sartre wishes to think in 
the concrete. His phenomenological account of ethical 
experience reveals two essential features of the moral 
norm, namely, it is unconditional in its imperative and 
it is capable of being met: Kant's famous "ought im-
plies can" receives phenomenological warrant. 
But the condition of the possibility of this "can" is 
human freedom itself- Sartrean inventive freedom, 
not Kantian obediential freedom. This accounts for the 
open-ended nature of the ethical situation. It also gen-
erates what Sartre terms the "ethical paradox": moral 
norms display the iterability of the practica-inert (to 
which they belong) and yet depend on our temporally 
unique creative praxis for their functioning as norms. 
The basic ambiguity of the "given" and the "taken" 
returns. As in his first ethic, one must simply live this 
tension creatively. But unlike the ethic of authentic-
ity, which seemed to foster more a style than a content, 
Sartre 's dialectica) ethic relies on the givenness of gen-
uine human needs, beginning with the demands of our 
biologica! nature and extending to our psycho-social 
need for mutuality and positive reciprocity as we com-
bat the violence of material scarcity and oppression in 
order to realize "integral humanity." 
Sartre 's third ethic (of the "we") is barely adum-
brated in severa! interviews given toward the end of 
his life. Composed with Benny Levy after a blinding 
stroke forced Sartre to rely on a tape recorder, the re-
sultant livrea deux remains unavailable. The dilemma 
of fraternity and violence mentioned above is crucial 
to the work. And there are indications that it mounts a 
holistic critique of existentialist individualism. But the 
paucity of material available, as well as the hermeneu-
tic morass ofits dual authorship, leaves the work more

of a biographical oddity than a significant reassessment 
of Sartre's lifelong project.

UnJike EDMUND HUSSERL, 
JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, or MARTIN HEIDEGGER, who pubJished 
little if anything on ethics during their lifetimes, MAX 
SCHELER published a major work on ethics during the 
most productive and phenomenologically intensive pe-
riod ofhis career. His interest in ethics is evident even 
before 1900, in his pre-phenomenological writings at 
Jena, in which he distinguished ethical principles from 
those of logic and explored the relation of ethics to 
work (Arbeit). But it was only after he met Husserl 
in 1901 and subsequently developed his own pheno-
menological perspective during a period ofinteraction 
with other phenomenologists in Munich (from 1906) 
and Gottingen ( from 1911) that his ethical reftections 
assumed their more definitive, mature form. His nine 
years as a private scholar and lecturer between his aca-
demic positions at Munich and Koln ( 191 0--19) were 
the most productive of his life, and yielded a prolific 
outpouring of major phenomenological studies, partic-
ularly in ethics and related areas. While Scheler's !ater 
work in PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY and socioJogy of 
knowledge also has important implications for his eth-
ical theory, his middle period was phenomenologically 
and ethically definitive. 
During his middle period Scheler published his 
magnum opus, Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die 
materiale Wertethik (Formalism in ethics and nonfor-
mal ethics of value, 1913/ 16), a ground-breaking ven-
ture in applied phenomenology, setting forth in oppo-
sition to KANT's ethical formalism a personalist ethics 
based on the teleological intuition and realization of 
material (nonformal) values. In the important essay,

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
"Ordo Amoris" ( 1916), he a1so elaborated upon a key 
under1ying tenet of Formalismus- name1y, that there 
exists an order of cognitive emotional INTENTIONAL-
ITY, independent of reason, through which values are 
apprehended a priori. During this period he also pub-
lished Zur Phiinomenologie und Theorie der Sympa-
thiegefiihle und von Liebe und Hass (On phenomen-
ology and theory of sympathy, love, and hate, 1913), 
and Uber Ressentiment und moralisches Werturteil 
(Conceming ressentiment and moral value judgment, 
1912), an ingenious reversal ofNietzsche's claim that 
Judeo-Christian morality stems from resentment, elic-
iting from Troeltsch the characterization of Scheler as 
"the Catholic Nietzsche." 
Scheler's ethica1 concems were always closely re-
1ated to his sense ofliving in an age ofworld-historical 
crisis and transition -
socially, economically, politi-
caliy, and spiritually. Weii before the outbreak of the 
World War 1, he was aiready concerned about the 
disintegrating spiritual identity of European civiliza-
tion, particularly about the displacement ofthe value-
orientation of the historical Christian ethos by that of 
the ascendant age of bourgeois capitalism (MAX WE-
BER, Werner Sombart [ 1863~ 1941 ], and Ernst Troeitsch 
( 1865~ 1923 ). The subsequent devastation of Europe by 
the war heightened Scheler's concerns about European 
unity and identity. These concerns were, for him, never 
merely theoretical. He served on diplomatic missions 
to Switzerland and The Netherlands, and after the war 
he actively promoted the causes of pacifism, interna-
tional repentance, moral conversion, and European re-
unification on the basis of a new form of socialism that 
would enlist the best energies of the Western heritage, 
particularly those of Augustinian Christianity with its 
emphasis on Christian love and sense ofhistorical pur-
pose and order. 
These larger concerns had an immediate bearing on 
ethics, in Scheler's view since the renewal of Europe 
would ha veto begin with individuals and a reordering 
of their sense of values. And this, he believed, was a 
task that could be accomphshed only through a revi-
talization of ethics. In the first place, this meant that 
ethics wouid have to provide principles that could of-
fer individuals some measure of concrete guidance. On 
this point Scheler took issue with NICOLAI HARTMANN, 
who eschewed questions of normative ethics. Scheler, 
by contrast, declared: "After ali, eth1cs is a damned 
bloody affair, and if it can give me no directives con-
cerning how I should li ve now in this social and histor-
ical context, then what is it?" In the second place, this 
meant that ethics would have to be reestablished on a 
secure new foundation. A return to ethical common-
sense theories or utilitarian principles ofthe kind found 
in BRITISH MORAL THEORY was no ion ger a viable option. 
The challenge to such views by philosophers such as 
Nietzsche and by movements such as social Darwinism 
had been far too serious to ignore. A new foundation 
was required to enable ethics to withstand the assault 
of moral skepticism and relativism. For Scheler, that 
foundation is to be provided by a phenomenological 
theory ofvalues. 
While Scheler credits his "methodological con-
sciousness of the unity and sense of the phenomen-
ological attitude" to Husserl, it is clear that he does 
not feei bound by Husserrs detailed methodological 
concems or by the direction in which Husserl himself 
developed them. As early as 1904 Scheler criticized 
Husserl 's Logische Untersuchungen (1900--190 1) for 
its "platonizing" assumption that truth exists as some-
thing in itself, independently of instantiation in objects, 
thoughts, or judgments. Like many of his contempo-
raries, he also criticized Husserl 's Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 (1913) for its egological "Cartesianism" and its 
insistence on grounding phenomenology, in a manner 
reminiscent of Kantian idealism, in the "transcenden-
tal ego." Scheler also rejects the primacy that Husserl 
accords to logical-theoretical reason by asserting that 
acts of willing and feeling are "founded" in intel-
lective acts and grasped only by means of the intel-
iect's predicative acts of objectivation and thematiza-
tion. By contrast, Scheler insists on the primacy and 
autonomy of affective -
even subliminal -
modes 
of value-apprehension, claiming that they ha ve a Pas-
caii an "logic" of their own, independent of reason. 
Vaiues, not "objects'' in Husserl 's logica! sense, are the 
primordial phenomena, he argues: "A value precedes 
1ts object; it is the first 'messenger' of its particular na-
ture" Impressed by the human intellect's capacity for 
self-deception, Scheler also attacks what he calls (bor-
rowing Fnincis Bacon 's expression) the "idols of self-
knowledge,'' particularly the Cartesian confidence in 
the supposedly infallible "self-evidence" of inner per-
ception, and goes so far as to insist that genuine philo-

191 
sophical knowledge has "moral prerequisites" such as 
love, humility, and self-control. 
Whatever may be said about the relationship be-
tween Husserl and Scheler, or the differences between 
their ultimate conceptions of phenomenology, it was 
Husserl's conception of "categoria! intuition" that ul-
timately opened the way for Scheler's theory ofvalue, 
which is clearly based on the phenomenological no-
tions of "intuition of essences" ( Wesensschau) and the 
"material a priori." What Scheler saw in phenomen-
ology was not so much a method as a particular attitude 
(Einstellung) or mode of experience by which we atten-
tively "live through" (Erleben) our experiences, intu-
itively apprehending matters (Sachen) as they are given 
in an immediate grasp of their essential eidetic con-
tours. "Essences" are taken by Scheler tobe neitheruni-
versals nor particulars, when considered in their pure 
"whatness" ( Was) apart from the bracketed question of 
"existence," since he did not follow Husserl in distin-
guishing between the EIDETIC METHOD and the transcen-
dental EPOCHE AND REDUCTION. Nor does ScheJer typi-
cally employ the canonica! Husserlian terms "noesis" 
and "NOEMA" in his writings, although he clearly recog-
nizes that the bipolar intentiona! structure of conscious-
ness (first highlighted by FRANZ BRENTANO) allows for 
two approaches in investigation, which he calls, re-
spectively, "act-phenomenology" and the "phenomen-
ology of facts." The first is, for Scheler, intimately 
associated with his personalist anthropology and his 
view of the person as the "ontic unity'' (Seinseinheit) 
of acts, existing and living "solely in the execution of 
intentiona! acts" -
a view anticipating Heidegger's 
DASEIN-analysis. The second involves a threefold dis-
tinction in varieties of facts: ( 1) natural, (2) scientific, 
and (3) phenomenological or "pure" facts. The latter 
he distinguishes from the others by virtue of the cir-
cumstances that their essences ( Wesenheiten) are fully 
given in such a way that there is a complete coinci-
dence (Deckung) between what is intended and what 
is given in them. These facts, or "essences," are also 
considered by Scheler to be given "a priori"- that 
is, independently of any inductive or ca usa! inferences 
from sensory data. 
Scheler's ethics is best understood by setting it, as 
he did, in relation to Kant's. Scheler accepts Kant's 
critique of naturalistic and utilitarian ethical theories. 
He agrees with Kant's insistence that ethics must be 
unconditional and a priori, that morals cannot rest on 
anything as unpredictable as the anticipated realization 
of contingent goods or ends. But he rejects the Kantian 
inference that the "material contents" of moral experi-
ence therefore could have no place in determining the 
moral value of an action. On the Kantian view, the only 
principle of lawfulness conceivable in morality is that 
contributed by a rational subject through the universal 
form of the categorica! imperative. But the material 
elements given in moral experience could never be 
conceived as having their own lawfulness and order 
independently of the subject. Hence for Kant, in de-
ciding the morality of an action, such phenomena as 
willing and desiring were supposed tobe reckoned in a 
purely formal way, without taking into account (indeed 
avoiding) their material contents- the actual objects 
of such willing and desiring. 
While Scheler takes the categorica! imperative as 
pointing to an essential facet of morality, he thinks 
that this Kantian formalism was incomplete. He feels 
that it prevents Kant from offering a clear, coherent 
account of our moral experience, or even of the pre-
eminent fact that our primordial comportment toward 
the world is affective and involves a pretheoretical 
apprehension of values (Wertnehmung). Every mode 
of intellectual reasoning, conceiving, or judging al-
ways already presupposes an affective experience of 
the value of that about which one reasons, conceives, 
or judges. Hence the very project of determining the 
will in a purely fohnal manner apar! from the "mate-
rial" value-contents of willing, in the Kantian a priori 
manner, is self-defeating. Further, Scheler feels that 
Kant's formalist approach blinds him to the fact that 
the "moral ought" of the categorica! imperative itself 
presupposes precisely what Kant intended his formal-
ism to exclude: material insight into the actual values 
implicit in an "ideal ought" ( or in what Kant called 
the "moral law"). Hence the greatest error of Kantian 
ethics, for Scheler, is its neglect of those elements of 
experience that are given a priori as the basic phenom-
ena of moral experience- namely, values. 
Like Husserl, Scheler holds that Kant is mistaken 
in limiting the a priori to the purely formal. His at-
tack on Kant's "formal a priori" and his defense of a 
"material a priori" was even more intense and direct 
than Husserl 's-a fact that may explain why Scheler, 
more than Husserl, drew the fire of Moritz Schlick 

192 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
(1882-1936) in his famous article, "Is There a Fac-
tual A Priori?" ( 193G-31 ). For Scheler, the "a priori" 
consists in "ali those ideal units of meaning and those 
propositions that are self-given by way of an immediate 
intuitive content," apart from any question of positing 
subjects or posited objects to which such units ofmean-
ing are applicable. Like Husserl, he identifies the a pri-
ori with the content of essential intuition. Kant's dis-
tinction between "a priori" and "a posteriori"- iden-
tified by him with the classical distinctions between 
"form" and "matter," "intelligibility" and "sensibility" 
-
is displaced in Scheler's account by the distinction 
between "essence" (identified with "phenomenologi-
cal fact") and "reality" (identified with "resistance"). 
The a priori is no longer "subjective" but "objective," 
not "formal" but "material," not imposed by reason 
but given in intuition, not "independent of ali experi-
ence" but phenomenologically "experienced. " In this 
extended sense of "a priori," therefore, one may say 
that for Scheler there are certain fundamental a priori 
but nonetheless nonformal truths that we may know 
by means of essential intuition, and that these truths 
yield objective moral judgments concerning the ma-
terial contents of moral experience that are universal, 
necessary, and synthetic- judgments such as "spir-
itual values ha ve a higher rank in the scale of values 
than sensible values." 
One of Scheler's major contentions is that values 
( Werte) are distinct from the objects of desire (Ziele) 
or goods ( Gilter) that serve as their "bearers." He agrees 
with Kant that moral obligation cannot be defined in 
tenns of the latter without relativizing it and subordi-
nating it to the empirica! contingencies of particular 
whims, ends and purposes (Zwecke). But he insists 
that values, unlike their "bearers," are not subject to 
such contingencies, since they are neither abstractions 
from empirica! goods nor postulates of an empirica! 
will (as even Heidegger mistakenly supposed), but are 
first given independently even of conscious willing in 
the passive intentionalities of subliminal experience. 
While Scheler acknowledges that values have no real, 
Platonic sort of "existence" in themselves ("Der Wert 
ist liberhaupt nicht"), but only a "functional existence" 
(as MANFRED FRINGS ca lis it) by virtue of a relation with 
an existing "bearer," he nevertheless accords to values 
the preeminent sta tus of absolute givenness as a priori 
objects of phenomenological insight. He typically ap-
peals to the analogy of color to illustrate the manner 
in which values are given. We talk readily about "red" 
as a pure color of the spectrum without the need to 
conceive of it as covering a surface. Like colors, val-
ues may be found attached to empirica! objects, but as 
contents of immediate intuition they do not depend on 
instantiation in those objects. We are acquainted, for 
example, with cases in which the value of a thing is 
presented to us clearly apartfiwn its "bearer," as in the 
case of a person (ora work of art, ora room) that may 
strike us as pleasant or repugnant without our being 
able to say just why this is the case. Values, as such, 
are pure eidetic "qualities" given absolutely and inde-
pendently both oftheir "bearers" and of any willing or 
positing activity (Setzung) of the subject. 
Scheler maintains that values can be shown to ex-
hibit themselves in an objective a priori order of re-
lationships possessing ali thc characteristics neces-
sary for a rigorously grounded ethics. While he takes 
into consideration the formal properties and relations 
among values ofthe kind mentioned by Brentano (e.g., 
"the existence of a positive value is itself a positive 
value"), his analysis of material (nonformal) values and 
their a priori interconnections is of much greater orig-
inality and significance. These latter values he groups 
into four modalities, corresponding to the affective in-
tentionalities by which they are apprehended and their 
respective emotional states. Ranked from highest to 
lowest, these include: (1) religious values, such as the 
"sacred" and "profane"; (2) cultural (geistige) values, 
such as the "true," "right," and "beautiful"; (3) vital 
values, such as the "nob le" and "common"; and ( 4) 
sensory values, such as the "pleasant" and "painful." 
(Frings discerns a fifth modality of"pragmatic" values, 
such as the "useful" and "useless," between Scheler's 
third and fourth rank, though admitting Scheler did not 
assign them a separate rank.) Scheler would argue that 
there is nothing arbitrary or subjective about this hier-
archy, that it is simply a phenomenological fact, open 
to our inspection, and based on such evident criteria 
(reminiscent of Bentham's hedonic calculus) as rela-
tive duration, depth of satisfaction, and the like. Fur-
thermore, he believed, like Brentano, that this ranking 
reftects an a priori "logic of preference," a pre-rational 
inclination favoring va1ues of a "higher" rank, as well 
as "positive" (rather than "negative") values within a 
given rank. 

ETHICS IN SCHELER 
193 
In order to understand Scheler's ethics at this point, 
it is important to recognize that it rests on a critica! dis-
tinction between moral and nonmoral values. Moral 
values (good and evi!) are defined in terms ofthe non-
moral value that is brought into being, as in teleological 
theories generally. Accordingly, a phenomenology of 
hierarchically ranked non moral values furnishes a clear 
basis, in Scheler's view, for establishing the moral val-
ues of good and evi!, which can be defined in terms of 
the relative rank of these other, non moral values that 
are brought into being. In other words, moral values 
are generated through acts of willing and realizing non-
moral values. Moral good appears through the willing 
of "higher" as opposed to "lower," and "positive" as 
opposed to "negative," nonmoral values. When par-
ents make material sacrifices for the education oftheir 
children, they place their children 's education before 
their own physical comforts, thereby exhibiting a pref-
erence for the "intellectual" value of education over 
the "physical" value of their own material comfort. 
The moral "good" here derives from the act ofwilling 
the higher nonmoral value. Thus Scheler claims that 
moral value is never given directly as the content or 
abject of the act of willing, but only, so to speak, "on 
the back" (aufdem Riicken) ofthis act. Further, on his 
view, moral value is actually brought into existence in 
a person whenever the existence of a "bearer" of a pos-
itive nonmoral value is willed, regardless of whether 
one actually succeeds in bringing about the existence 
ofthe intended nonmoral value or its bearer. Thus, his 
ethics is teleological, but not consequentialist. 
Scheler 'stheory of moral obligation is overtly axio-
logica!. Duty stems from insight into values. An ethics 
of insight, for him, is diametrically opposed to an ethics 
of duty, such as Kant's, which mistakenly takes moral 
laws, imperatives, and duties to be the fundamental 
facts of moral consciousness. Scheler criticizes Kant's 
deontological ethics as "blind," because it overlooks 
the primacy of value-phenomena. It fails to see that 
moral imperatives and judgments always already pre-
suppose the comprehension ofvalues. Because ofthis, 
an ethics of duty tends to "cut off' (abschneidet) moral 
insight, to be essentially negative and restrictive, pre-
supposing an inclination on the part of the subject to 
oppose its imperatives. As such, the actions enjoined 
by such an ethics tend to lack the generous spontaneity 
ofthose based on moral insight. Not only does Scheler 
therefore insist that obligation must be based on value 
and insight, but in the "ought" of obligation (Sollen) 
he differentiates between a purely "ideal ought-to-be" 
(ideales Seinsollen) and a "moral ought-to-do" (ethis-
ches Tunsollen ). Insight into the former ( e.g., "injustice 
ought not to be") serves as the basis, he claimed, for 
willing and realizing that which is enjoined by the lat-
ter ("Thou shalt not do injustice"). Whether Scheler's 
theory adequately accounts for the relations between 
axiologica! insight, moral obligation, and inclination, 
or such phenomena as moral conflict within the indi-
vidual, is a matter of continued debate. 
While Scheler was unabashedly an objectivist and 
absolutist in his VALUE THEORY, and even claims objec-
tive a priori validity for the intentiona! feelings (inten-
tionales Fiihlen) by which values are apprehended, he 
does not deny a range of relativity in the actual moral 
judgments and value-perceptions of various individu-
als and societies. What presents itself as morally oblig-
atory may vary, depending onan individual's level of 
insight, moral disposition, virtue, or perceived ability. 
Someone suffering from a pathological urge to sacrifice 
may not ha ve the same obligation tobe more "selfless" 
as a self-centered egotist. A quadriplegic may not be 
morally bound to try to rescue a drowning person in 
the same way as a fully capable swimmer. Further, 
variations may also reflect the historical and cultural 
relativity of an ethos, a particular ethical framework, 
a particular society's estimations of certain behaviors 
or its level of ethical performance, or even differences 
in customs. Recognition ofthese types ofrelativity in-
forms the way in which Scheler develops his theory of 
virtue, conscience, and the "caii ofthe hour" (kairos), 
as well as his theory about "exemplary acts" and types 
of"model persons" (the saint, genius, hero, etc.), which 
he set forth as vehicles for moral growth. Yet Scheler 
steadfastly maintained that recognition of these types 
of relativity does not affect the objectivity of values 
themselves.

ETHNIC STUDIES 
Programs of this sort first 
emerged at the University of California late in the 
1950s and have been spreading elsewhere in the United 
States since then. Although the study of African-
American history and culture in its own right would 
seem to have begun with the writings of George Wash-
ington Williams (1849-1891 ), and to have become in-
stitutionalized with the establishment of the Associa-
tion for the Study ofNegro Life and History in 1915 un-
der the leadership ofCarter G. Woodson (1875-1950), 
an explicitly multicultural approach to the ethnic study 
ofpeoples ofthe United States did not emerge until the 
Civil Rights movement ( 1954-65) evoked a re vi val of 
interes! in group heritages and their implications for 
scholarship, society, and self-identity. 
Multidisciplinary programs of teaching and re-
search are concerned with the problems of both race 
and ethnicity and tend to focus on ethnoracial mi-
norities, with some variation according to which spe-
cific groups are locally represented. Consideration of 
majoritarian Euro-American ("White") groups in the 
UNITED STATES and ethnoracial issues in other coun-
tries and empires, often characterized as matters of 
"nationality," or "national minorities," have not been 
excluded, although, with the exception of the numer-
ous sociologica! studies of Poles, Italians, and Jews in 
America, they ha ve often had to take a secondary place 
in programs emphasizing African Americans, Asian 
Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Indians (or "Na-
tive Americans"). 
In structure, Ethnic Studies resembles curricular 
programs in Environmental Studies, Science Studies, 
Technology Studies, and Women's Studies. They in-
clude participation by faculty from COMMUNICOLOGY, 
ECONOMICS, ETHNOLOGY, HISTORY, POLITICAL SCIENCE, PHI-
LOSOPHY, PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY, and other HUMAN SCI-
ENCES and CULTURAL DISCIPLINES. Most if not ali such 
disciplines have explicit or implicit phenomenologi-
cal tendencies in them. Although they remain largely 
undeveloped, there are enormous opportunities for the 
perspectives of a cultural-scientific or philosophical 
phenomenologyto play apartin such multidisciplinary 
programs. 
Humans are always simultaneously inside and out-
side many of what can be called, generically, cul-
tural groups. Such cultural groups might be based on 
class, ethnicity, gender, generation, nation, region, etc.

ETHNIC STUDIES 
195 
Groups that are specifically ethnic (from ethnos, the 
Greek term for a people; nation, from the Latin nătiă, is 
a related but not precisely equivalent term) are based on 
claimed heritages ofsuch socially visible determinants 
as diet, dress, 1anguage, and re1igion, as well as genet-
ically acquired somatie properties. Elementary forms 
ofheritage ofthese sorts are allcged to occur in various 
combinations with various and selected emphases such 
that insiders and outsiders might believe that the physi-
cal aspects are ultimately immutable (though intermar-
riage, interbreeding, and the occasional mutation can 
alter, subordinate, or dilute them), while the acquired 
ones are not necessarily subject to Lamarckian inher-
itance. Hence for Ethnic Studies, learning the culture 
of a people is a way of possessing it and teaching that 
cu !ture is a way of transmitting it across generations. 
Upon close consideration, it is nearly impossible to find 
a society that does not include a multiplicity of ethnic 
groups; however, the relations among them can easily 
include domination and antagonisms (e.g., bigotry and 
racism) as well as accommodation and tolerance. 
The United States of America is and continues to 
be a country of immigrants with a number of eth-
nic groups. Ethnic relations, combinations of ethnic 
groups, vicissitudes of ethnic consciousness, and re-
ftections on ethnicity are characteristic themes ofschol-
arly interest and societal action in the United States: 
there are hundreds of ethnic groups in this o ne country. 
Two major paradigms of academic and politica! 
thought regarding race and ethnicity in the United 
States can be recognized. The older paradigm, still 
playing a large role, particularly among politica! con-
servatives and older liberals, is focused upon assimi-
lation as both the inevitable and desirable outcome of 
ethnic group contact. Much of the theoretical and em-
pirica! work of sociologists in America defined the pace 
and direction of the assimilative processes and rated 
groups with respect to their adaptations to it. Integra-
tion into the population mainstream was said to occur 
for any ethnoracially distinctive people in a generation 
or two. Such a perspective required deemphasizing the 
actual condition, e.g., of the Mexican Americans in 
Texas and the American Southwest since the Mexican-
American war ( 1846--48); or of the persistence over 
time of such cultural enclaves as "Chinatowns"; or of 
the continuai interest of elements ofthe Irish-American 
population in the Anglo-Irish struggle across the At-
!antic. Moreover, few assimilationists questioned the 
ethnoracial composition of the so-called mainstream 
of America. It might ha ve been asked whether this has 
been and stil! remains a socio-culturally hegemonic oli-
garchy of White Anglo-Saxon Protestants that act as 
politica!, economic, and cultural gatekeepers for, and 
behind, an illusion of an integrated but nevertheless 
"White," "Anglo," and middle-class America. 
This older paradigm of assimilation was also ac-
cepted as part of the historical dialectic of MARXISM 
among the adherents of the progressive politics of the 
past century. Marxism 's emphasis on the primacy ofthe 
relations of production rather than ethnic differences 
-
a phenomenon that Friedrich Engels had doubts 
about with respect to the socio-economic formations in 
America- seemed to require the dissolution of eth-
noraeial sodalities in the acidic solvent of inexorable 
class struggle. The recent emphasis on FEMINISM has 
also drawn attention away from concentration on the 
issues affecting race and ethnic groups and diluted fur-
ther the essentialism found in Marxist theories of class. 
Ethnic, class, and gender issues overlap and compound 
in cultural groupings and in the formation of individual 
identity- a phenomenon that ought to be foca! in the 
human sciences. 
The newer paradigm that tends tobe emphasized in 
Ethnic Studies programs re1ates history, culture, and 
consciousness to the extensive history of exclusion (in 
ali its forms, e.g., slavery, prejudice, discrimination, 
oppression, hegemonism, subordination, etc.) experi-
enced by the so-called "minority" groups. Some mem-
bers of these groups were held as s1aves and then op-
pressed in peonage (African Americans); others were 
consigned to low wage agricultura! labor (Mexican 
Americans); others were excluded from legal immi-
gration and denied the right to naturalization, although 
their children born in America were citizens by birth 
(Asian peoples); and still others were declared perma-
nent "dependents" and assigned to reservations (Native 
Americans). 
With the breakup ofthe Austro-Hungarian and Ot-
toman Empires at the end of World War I, a different 
resolution of the ethnic issue emerged. Presented as 
President Woodrow Wilson 's doctrine of national self-
determination, and accepted in principle by the League 
of Nations, the doctrine was immediately but imper-
fectly applied to the successor states ofthe two defunct 

196 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
empires. It did not apply to the newly emerging UNION 
OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, nor to the co]onies of 
Africa, Asia, and Oceania that the victorious powers 
in the war wished to retain. In Western Europe ethnic 
tensions arose in severa! countries but did not result 
in secessionist or state-building movements. Follow-
ing the dissolution ofthe Spanish, Portuguese, French, 
Italian, Dutch, and British overseas empires in the three 
decades after the end ofWorld War II, the doctrine was 
reasserted in a host of new states admitted to the United 
Nations. The postcolonial states in Africa, Asia, and 
Oceania were in fact multi-ethnic but claimed unitary 
or ethnonational status. Precisely because the num-
ber of would-be nations greatly outnumbers that of 
established territorial states in the world, nationalist 
movements in behalf of cultural, ethnic and politica! 
self-determination and in quest of economic autonomy 
continue to arise. 
Concomitant with the disintegration of the So-
viet Union and the dissolution and ethno-civil strife 
in the Balkan states, ethnic and national tensions 
within a number of states intensified. In Europe these 
took such forms as riots against refugees and guest 
workers in reunified Germany; xenophobic demagogy 
launched against France's African ex-colonials; per-
sistent Flemish-Walloon conflicts in Belgium; Greco-
Roman disputes over Cyprus; Spain 's difficulty with its 
Basque population; Holland's troubles with its South 
Moluccans; and Britain 's long dispute in Northern Ire-
land. In Africa, most postcolonial state societies em-
brace a number of ethnic groups, some ofwhose mem-
bers reside in border areas that stretch beyond the polit-
ica! boundaries. In some ofthese states (e.g., Rwanda 
and Burundi), competition and conflict ari se among the 
severa! peoplehoods. South Africa has begun to dis-
mantie its apartheid and separate homeland systems, 
but intertribal and other ethnic conflicts are emerging. 
In Asia, Japan has never resolved its less than egali-
tarian treatment of the Burakumin, Ainu, Okinawan, 
and Korean peoples; China must deal with its fifty-five 
officially recognized national minorities, its Tibetan 
question, and the Taiwan dispute; India must deal with 
its Muslims, Sikhs, Parsees, and many more. In North 
America, Canada is threatened by its Anglophone-
Francophone division and the reasserted claims of its 
Indian, Eskimo, and "Meti" populations. Everywhere 
the organization of nationalities into separate states 
or autonomous regions suggests itself but seems an 
unlikely and inefficacious solution to the multifarious 
problems it seeks to address. 
A newer paradigm began to emerge conceptually 
in the United States when Horace Kallen ( 1882-197 4) 
advanced an anti-assimilationist thesis in Cu/ture and 
Democracy ( 1924 ): the true test of a democracy would 
be its preservation of the cultural identities of its 
various peoples. He did not advocate national self-
determination, which would re late ethnicity to territory 
and independent politica! authority, but rather plural-
ism, a vision of American society not as a melting pot 
but rather as what, in a more recent image, can be called 
a "salad bowl," i.e., a civil society wherein it is rec-
ognized that ethnic diversity is essential to a national 
culture and in which such differences are appreciated. 
That the United States is an irreducibly multicul-
tural, pluralistic, or multi-ethnic society became in-
creasingly clear in the 1950s during the era ofthe Civil 
Rights movement. At the same time, there emerged 
among some scholars and students at the University of 
California a recognition that conventional textbooks 
in anthropology, history, literature, politics, sociology, 
etc., had failed to present or represent the actual range 
of peoples within the society. Multidisciplinary Eth-
nic Studies programs, as they carne to be called, then 
began to arise at first as compensatory efforts. These 
programs aim not only to expand curricular coverage 
but also to legitimate the histories, cultures, and unique 
character ofhitherto neglected ethnoracial groups. Pro-
grams in Women 's Studies, Gay and Lesbian Studies, 
etc. -
each in effect claiming a heritage, a cui ture, or 
a lifestyle worthy of legitimating recognition, schol-
arly attention, and social acceptance- subsequently 
followed this format. 
Whether Ethnic Studies programs must come under 
the domination of a single discipline, e.g., sociology, 
such that the participation of other disciplines is rel-
egated to a supportive, ancillary, or "token" role, re-
sembling that of subordinated minorities in the wider 
society, is an unresolved issue. Should such a develop-
ment occur, an Ethnic Studies program would reflect in 
its structures the questioned ideal of assimilation and 
integration, which the establishment of Ethnic Stud-
ies was designed to question and which the expression 
"multi-discipline" can be used to oppose. 
In the phenomenological perspective, the socially 

ETHNIC STUDIES 
197 
visible determinations of ethnic groups to which an in-
dividual considers herself or himselfto belong ( or not 
belong) have cultural characteristics, i.e., they are be-
lieved in, valued, and willed. They are also selectively 
noticed. This ali occurs in deeply habitual ways that in 
fact are learned but take on the character ofmores and 
seem "natural" to those insi de and outside such groups. 
These cultural characteristics and the positional strata 
of habitual conscious life in which they are consti-
tuted can be reftected upon, analyzed, and described 
with respect to the investigator's own self and group 
as well as with respect to those of others. Reftective 
descriptions, sophisticated or not, are presupposed not 
only by attempts at explanation, but also in the realms 
of action on the commonsense, cultural scientific, and 
philosophicallevels. 
The reftective-descriptive approach is recognizable 
as a method ofresearch in the so-called qualitative and 
interpreti ve tendencies within such cultural disciplines 
as sociology. It is crucial for Ethnic Studies. It has 
a ro le to play in the self- and other-understandings of 
each memberofan ethnic group; in those ofeach ofthe 
uni-disciplines that can investigate such groups; and in 
the multi-discipline that can be formed from them. 
There are precedents in phenomenological philos-
ophy for reftections on ethnicity, particularly in the 
writings of SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, HANNAH ARENDT, JEAN-
PAUL SARTRE, and ALFRED SCHlJTZ; a phenomenoiogist 
can add relevant implications for this perspective in 
the work of other figures. The writings of MAX SCHELER 
and ARON GURWITSCH are a rich source yet to be mined 
for their relevance to Ethnic Studies. At the present 
time actual participation in and reftection upon Ethnic 
Studies programs by phenomenological philosophers 
can hardly be said to have begun. Nevertheless, given 
recent domestic as well as international events, much 
can be expected. 
The phenomenological philosopher can approach 
race and ethnicity directly, much as the cultural scien-
tist does, but without accepting the specifying assump-
tions of a specialized discipline, and might well attain 
insights of a general significance by this route. Another 
and probably more effective strategy is oblique and 
consists in accessing the lives and worlds of various 
self- and mutually-recognized peoples through reftec-
tion upon the cultural sciences in which these matters 
are positively investigated and, even more promisingly, 
upon the multidisciplinary efforts of Ethnic Studies 
programs and how the subject matter of race and eth-
nicity presents itself in them. This would be analogous 
to approaching nature through philosophical reftection 
upon historical, logica!, psychological, sociologica!, 
and other specialized scientific research on the actual 
practices of natural science. Experience has already 
proven the benefits of a philosopher 's consulting with 
scientific specialists in Ethnic Studies. 
For phenomenological VALUE THEORY there is the 
issue in multi-ethnic societies of value systems inter-
mediate in breadth between an entire cultural world 
and a specific cultural situation. Then again, there are 
overlaps between such value systems in such a society. 
For what can be called ethnic value systems (and also 
for the systems of ends and means intimately related 
to them) there arise various questions of ethnic diver-
sity and relations, including, above ali, that ofwhether 
there are basic values that hold not for one or a few 
but for ali groups, and are thus nonrelative, or whether 
RELATIVISM ofnot only value and purpose but even be-
lief systems is the case. On the level of willing and 
purposes thcre are, moreover, questions of ETHJCS and 
POLITJCS, e.g., that ofwhether tolerance ought to extend 
so far as to embrace the aggressively intolerant. 
Finally, the question of ethnicity actually be-
gins already to emerge in phenomenology's self-
understanding when, despite the striving for nonrel-
ative validity, it remains significant to speak of the 
American, German, French, Latin American, Japanese, 
and other national traditions in the history ofthis move-
ment. In sum, more than a little can be expected from 
future decades of phenomenology in and of Ethnic 
Studies.

ETHNOLOGY 
The task of ethnology or cultural 
anthropology is a comparative as well as a descriptive 
one, for it begins with the assumption of a plurality of 
cultures and societies, rather than a single one. Ali the 
questions it poses are thus double ones: to what extent 
are the concepts we use to depict our own social life 
also valid for those of different languages and cultures? 
These questions implicate the philosophical foun-
dations of our social theorizing as we11. Is there a 
repertoire of human characteristics that is ontologi-
ca11y prior to the acquisition of any particular culture 
and language? If so, is the identification of this reper-
toire of any use to ethnology, given the fact that it 
is focused precisely on the variations and differences 
between such cultures, languages, and societies? 
The major theories of anthropology thus must nec-
essarily address themselves simultaneously to the uni-
versality of what it means to be human while at the 
same time insisting that such universality is tobe found 
in the very phenomenon of linguistic and cultural di-
versity and differentiation. In short, anthropology is 
confronted with the dilemma that it can only address 
and apprehend the difference of other peoples' LIFE-
WORLDs through the resources of its own perceptual 
and conceptual apparatus, which itself is historica11y 
and cultura11y conditioned. Yet it can be said that for 
most of this century, a commitment to some form of 
methodological objectivism has been part and parc el of 
al1 anthropological theory, both materialist and idealist. 
What the HUMAN SCIENCES are now benefiting from 
at our present juncture, however, is the fundamental 
critique of such naive objectivism, and it is this cri-
tique which has led to the re-emerging importance of 
phenomenological and existential modes ofanalysis in 
current ethnographic studies. 
It is also clear- though this has been pointed out 
for many years- that many of the societies and cul-
tures that anthropology pays attention to are not and 
cannot be founded on Cartesian antinomies such as 
mind and body, nor on other associated Enlightenment 
oppositions such as nature and culture, individual and 
society, and so forth. It is reasonable to conclude that 
those critiques of Cartesianism that arose within the 
development of our own analytical repertoire, such as 
phenomenology, stand to achieve a greater descriptive 
and analytical purchase on such cultures. For example, 
in a recent address, Tim Ingold proposes to borrow the

phenomenological concept of the Umwelt, "milieu," 
or as he puts it, "the world as constituted within the 
specific life activity of an animal." And he finds in 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER 's formulation of dwelling a sui table 
descriptive labei for the "whole manner in which one 
lives one's life on the earth." 
Because of his focus on the corporeal nature of 
being-in-the-world, one of the most important figures 
within the phenomenological tradition for anthropol-
ogy has been MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY. For instance, 
ethnological experience with small-scale, subsistence 
societies repeatedly confirms the centrality ofthe BODY 
in organizing a range ofrelational, productive, and cos-
mologica! orders. As ALPHONSE DE WAELHENS has put it, 
"the body- but not the body as a thing- is itself 
at the center of ... sociality." Sociality is an embod-
ied phenomenon insofar as it begins with the child's 
earliest experiences of socialization in the microcosm 
of the materna! embrace that subsequently models the 
opening up ofthe child's expanded social world. Acts 
of nurturance, specifically feeding, become the foca! 
sites ofhuman interaction, and what strikes the anthro-
pologist is the ubiquity offeeding, ingestion, digestion, 
and excretion as images for a total range of social, pro-
ductive, and spatial arrangements within a community. 
According to Roy Wagner, the Daribi, a group of 
swidden cultivators of the interior highlands of Papua 
New Guinea, liken their communallonghouse to such 
an ingesting, feeding organism. The front ofthe house 
faces east, the direction of the rising sun, and it is in 
this end that the men li ve. The back of the longhouse 
is the women 's section. The longhouse is rai sed offthe 
ground by posts, but only the front is provided with an 
entrance ladder. It is through the front door that food 
and supplies are brought into the house. The back of 
the house, by contrast, is used as a latrine by men, and 
refuse and food leavings are also thrown over the side 
at this end. Thus "the 'direction' of life, coming and 
going, bringing in, preparing, and finally discarding or 
excreting food ... " gives the central corridor of the 
longhouse an alimentary function on a par with that of 
the human body. 
The production of speech also partakes of this 
gustatory-procreative imagery in some cases. Calame-
Griaule explains how the Dogon of Ma li (north central 
Africa) feei that words are produced inside the body 
and that each organ with its different characteristics, 
makes different contributions to the kind and quality 
of words as well as tones and intonations. The speech 
of others nourishes and feeds one, and other people's 
speech also is seen to fertilize others. Calame-Griaule 
says ofthe Dogon that they feei that "words are formed 
inside the body and nourished on its substance like a 
child in its mother's womb; too, it is expelled by an 
irresistible impulse similar to the contractions that lead 
inexorably to birth." For the Dogon, the name of an 
object is its "seed" or reproductive power: "To speak 
of an object is also to utter its name ... For the Do-
gon [this] involves 'giving water to the seeds,' in other 
words, setting offthis potential reproduction contained 
in the 'seeds,' which favours a sort of symbolic birth, 
or more, precisely, rebirth, a perpetua! recreation." The 
image of farming, o ne of the ma in subsistence activi-
ties ofthe Dogon, is used to give shape to their notions 
of what words are -
as something like a plant that 
must be nourished and that in turn can serve as nour-
ishment for others. Knowledge is then conceived as 
getting sustenance from others through their speech. 
In many societies, the human body is conceived and 
experienced as a nexus of conduits and paths along 
which vital energy and substances flow. Social interac-
tion takes place when these flows are directed outward 
toward others or conversely when one is made tobe the 
recipient of energy or substances from another. Among 
the Songhay ofMali, for instance, Michael Jackson re-
ports that "movements of 'blood,' 'heat,' and 'breath' 
take place along pathways in the body .... When these 
movements of blood, heat, or breath flow unimpeded 
in the right direction a person is healthy, but ifthe flow 
is reversed or obstructed illness occurs." Moreover, 
"the Songhay re gard the circulation of people, goods, 
and services along paths in the village as vitally con-
nected to the circulation of blood, heat, and breath in 
the individual body." This means that the daily activi-
ties that people like the Songhay engage in themselves 
contribute to a more encompassing embodiment ofthe 
communal territory. For example, Waterman reports 
that the Yurok of the northwest coast of North Amer-
ica considered trails to be "like people," that is, "they 
are sentient, and must be treated with urbanity." 
This corporealization ofthe landscape and territory 
can be further demonstrated by considering the inter-
changeability of personal names and place names in 
certain societies. Among the Yurok, "a man who owns 

200 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
a house is regularly called ... by the name ofhis house." 
And since Yurok house names themselves have geo-
graphically descriptive terms in them, the sum total of 
names ofpeople in a community is isomorphic with the 
geographical distribution ofhouses in that territory. 
The above examples amply demonstrate the inte-
gral place that a phenomenology of the body has in 
the ethnological analysis ofmany cultures' lifeworlds. 
But from a broader perspective, anthropology has for 
the most part opposed phenomenological approaches. 
There have been at least two major critiques ofpheno-
menology within anthropology. The first and most im-
portant was Claude Levi-Strauss's STRUCTURALISM. So-
cial phenomena, he asserted, could never be reducible 
to lived experience, since their effects take place in the 
space between subjects. A New Guinea actor's view of 
his or her ro le in a regional exchange cycle says nothing 
about the totality of that exchange cycle (which may 
link persons in societies that ha ve no face-to-face con-
tact with each other), nor does it give a sense ofits sys-
tematicity or global logic. Furthermore, Levi-Strauss's 
appreciation ofthe dramatic accomplishments ofstruc-
turallinguistics in the 20th century convinced him that 
sociallaws were a phenomenon ofthe unconscious and 
that LANGUAGE represents an "unreflecting totalization" 
beyond intention, will, and consciousness. 
Buton the other hand, Levi-Strauss's own "science 
ofthe concrete," which is how he described the strategy 
of classification he applied to non-Western societies, 
inevitably returns time and time again to corporeal 
schemata as images for the totalization and detotaliza-
tion that are the products of such categorizing percep-
tual acts. And such a realization should make us under-
stand that ifwe are to work to dissolve antinomies such 
as mind and body, categorizing and utilizing, thinking 
and produc ing, and so forth, then the artificial divisions 
between, for example, anthropology, PSYCHOLOGY, and 
GEOGRAPHY within human science are likewise rendered 
suspect. 
These three seemingly distinct human science ana-
lytics are artfully collapsed in one of Levi-Strauss's 
most phenomenological analyses, that of the Cuna 
shaman 's curing ritual. For the Cuna, difficult child-
birth occurs because Muu has captured the purba 
"soul" of the mother-to-be. The shaman 's task is to 
recapture the lost pur ba soul. The treatment consists in 
the shaman 's chanting of a song that te lis the story of 
his journey to Muu 's domain in the supernatural world 
in order to recover the purba soul. But the abode of 
Muu is not merely some mythical place where the spir-
its li ve. According to the song, it represents literally the 
space of the vaginal and uterine anatomy of the preg-
nant woman, which are reconnoitered by the shaman 
and his guardian spirit or nuchu, and which represents 
the battleground on which the struggle to regain the 
purba is waged. 
To reach Muu, the shaman and his spirit helpers, 
the nelegan, must follow the road called "Muu's Way," 
which is the birth canal of the affiicted woman. The 
trip itself is phrased in terms of a fantastic landscape 
-it is, as Levi-Strauss says, "a complicated mythical 
anatomy, corresponding less to the real structure ofthe 
genital organs than to a kind of emotional geography." 
The route of the nelegan and the shaman becomes a 
movement between various named places in this cos-
mized female anatomy. This movement, moreover, is 
given a specifically sexual character: the nelegan at the 
outset "take on the appearance and the motions of the 
erect penis" in effecting this entry onto Muu's Way. 
According to Levi-Strauss, the shaman is actually at-
tempting to make the affiicted woman feei the entry of 
the shaman and his helpers, so that she can trace their 
progress to the site ofthe difficulty in her uterus. Thus 
from the point ofview ofthe affiicted woman, "not only 
does she feei them [i.e., the nelegan ], but they 'light 
up' the route they are preparing to follow- for their 
sake, no doubt, and to find the way, but also to make 
the center of her inexpressible and painful sensations 
'clear' for her and accessible to her consciousness." We 
could say that into an inchoate sensation of pain and 
anxiety is placed a series of spacings, in the form of a 
felt succession ofnamed points along the painful inter-
na! route ofher birth canal. Here the Cuna demonstrate 
that what is externa! and what is interna! to the body 
are not conceived of in different terms, and that what 
is interna! to the body is imaged in exactly the same 
terms as life movement through a territorial domain. 
For the second major critique of phenomenology 
in its ethnomethodological form ( derived from ALFRED 
SCHUTZ) we are indebted to the sociologist Pierre Bour-
dieu, who nevertheless accomplished a true reconcili-
ation of phenomenology and anthropology. In his Es-
quisse d 'une theorie de la pratique (Outline of a theory 
of practice, 1972), he maintains that by positing for 

ETHNOLOGY 
201 
itself as a subject matter "ali that is inscribed in the re-
lationship offamiliarity with the familiar environment, 
the unquestioning apprehension of the social world," 
phenomenology "excludes the question of the condi-
tions of its own possibility." Primary knowledge and 
experience must always be set against an assessment 
ofthe theoretical and social conditions that make such 
knowledge and experience possible, and that further-
more are systematically misrecognized or denied by the 
actors in the interest of maintaining the self-evidence, 
naturalness, and inevitability of a certain mode of prac-
tice. The critica! component of Bourdieu's theory is 
thus his identification of the role of concealment or 
misrecognition of these objective conditions. 
In Wacquant's words in An lnvitation to Reflexive 
Sociology ( 1992), "a genuine science of human prac-
tice cannot be content with merely superimposing a 
phenomenology on a social topology. It must also eluci-
date the perceptual and evaluative schema ta that agents 
invest in their everyday life." 
This leads to what can be identified as a more re-
cent third critique, which recognizes the points of sim-
ilarity between Bourdieu's stress on interpretation and 
the EXISTENTIAL and HERMENEUTICAL reformuJation of 
phenomenology by MARTIN HEIDEGGER. JAMES WEINER, 
like Bourdieu, starts from the understanding that the 
"interpretations of agents are an essential component 
ofthe fu li reality ofthe social world." Tobe in theworld 
-
the nature of DASEIN-means that human knowledge 
and perception are fundamentally relational. For Hei-
degger, both being-in and being-with indicate that tobe 
human means to have fundamental relationships with 
things and with others with which and with whom we 
are concemed, which and whom we care about and 
against which and whom we measure ourselves. In 
focusing on relationality as a core component of the 
human world, Heidegger and Bourdieu can be seen to 
have much in common. The difference is that Heideg-
ger does not identify the relational with the social but 
with a more primordial existential capacity ofbeing. 
Weiner hamesses this relational existential to the 
task of analyzing the spatial and temporal dimensions 
of the discursive practices of the Foi of interior Papua 
New Guinea. Heidegger claims that it was the under-
standing of one 's own death that allowed us tobe truly 
temporal beings. Faced with one's death, one works 
toward an eventual resolution of one's life, one seeks 
to make a meaning out ofthe sum of one's projects. 
While Foi women are at work processing the sta-
ple sago starch, they compose and sing laments to 
the memory of their dead male kinsmen. These po-
etic songs commonly describe the places the deceased 
used to inhabit and upon which he exercised his pro-
ductive exertions-in the form of gardens, animal and 
fish traps, house-building, and so forth. They appeal to 
the abandoned, empty status of such places consequent 
to the death of the one who vivified them and left his 
mark upon them. 
The temporal course of a man's life is thus depicted 
as a spatial series of named places that comprises a 
path or track through the village territory. The general 
conclusion we can draw is that people like the Foi, 
Yurok, and Dogon make TIME first through the bodily, 
spatial situatedness oftheir goals, activities, and inten-
tions in life, and it is part of this very groundedness 
to be forward-looking toward the anticipated outcome 
of these goals. Aletta Biersack, writing of the Paie la 
of Pa pua New Guinea, refers to a "horizon of agency" 
as the "spatial, temporal, and personal limits of the 
projects and their products." 
The role of discourse in the construction of lived 
temporality is critica!. When the Foi memorialize 
their dead through rite, litany, eulogy, teknonymy, and 
penthonymy, the dead are brought into their present. 
The vivification of memories of the dead is just one 
instance of the way the dead can often be el o ser to us 
than the living; in the "intense recall" ofthe deceased's 
prior situatedness we find an instance ofwhat Heideg-
ger called care, which he described as our source of 
interes! in our future. As George Steiner puts it, "The 
death of an individual is very often a modulation to-
wards resurrection in other men 's needs and remem-
brance. Heidegger's term is 'respectful solicitude' ."In 
this lies the understanding of"how a living community 
must constitute a 'being-along-side' its dead." 
Yet another approach to placing the work ofBour-
dieu with that of the phenomenological tradition is 
found in THOMAS J. CSORDAS. In "Embodiment as a 
Paradigm for Anthropology" ( 1990) he suggests that 
Bourdieu's notion ofthe bodily habitus can supply the 
social and cultural background often lacking in pheno-
menological analyses of individual subjectivity. On the 
other hand, a phenomenological focus on pre-objective 
intentionality and the perceptual constitution of tran-

202 
ENCYCLOPED!A OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
scendent cultural objects offers a way to counteract 
the "inadequate provision for self-motivated change 
within the habitus" in Bourdieu. Csordas applies this 
approach in The Sacred Self" A Cultural Phenomen-
ology ofCharismatic Healing ( 1994) and other studies. 
Finally, a sense of the direction that ethnology is 
heading with re gard to its reformulations of experience, 
subjectivity, and cultural lifeworlds is provided by 
Michael Jackson in Paths Toward a Clearing ( 1989). 
Jackson advocates an anthropological methodology 
based on what WILLIAM JAMES termed radical empiri-
cism: an anthropology that would consider "the way 
in which ideas and words are wedded to the world in 
which we live, how they are grounded in the mundane 
events and experiences of everyday life." And yet in 
tandem with an appreciation ofthe subjective focus of 
this constructionist account of such a world, the an-
thropologist should also place a consideration ofwhat 
resists or !ies beyond the limits of subjectivity, as Hei-
degger urged, of how a concealed objective state of 
affairs is made to appear as a result of the focused-
ness and INTENTIONALITY of our consciousness in the 
world. An ethnology that addressed itself to both the 
phenomenological and the existential in this way would 
preserve the truth ofboth our interpretational perspec-
tive and the objective conditions under which such an 
interpretational stance creates its own possibilities.

EVIDENCE 
In everyday communication we use 
words like "evidence" and "evident" when something 
is so clear to us that there is no need for further demon-
stration. The phenomenological term "evidence," how-
ever, has a more precise meaning, and is closely related 
to- though certainly different from- the concept of 
TRUTH. 
In phenomenology evidence is a key term. EDMUND 
HUSSERL, who has given the most detailed analysis of 
evidence ever offered in philosophy, even formulated 
a "principle of evidence" as the first methodological 
principle of phenomenology. In it he states that "a be-
ginner in philosophy" can neither make nor accept any 
judgment that he or she has not drawn from evidence, 
from "'experiences' in which the respective things and

EVIDENCE

states of affairs are present ... as 'they themselves' ." 
What Husserl postulates in this principle of Evidenz 
is, first, that philosophy in general cannot do without 
evidence, and second, that the traditionallack ofproof 
in philosophy can only be compensated for by the ac-
quisition of evident conceptual insight. He no longer 
demands constructions and deductions from philoso-
phy, but rather ~ due to his analytical demands for 
describing phenomena and uncovering and exhibit-
ing their structural features ~ 
he requires a rigorous 
method of seeing, noein, in the widest sense of the 
word. This does not mean that evident insight could 
replace chains of arguments. Neither science nor phi-
losophy could ever dispense with the discursive pro-
cedures of demonstrating and arguing in searching for 
truth. But ali such technical orderings are themselves 
to be grounded on evidence. Accordingly, the evident 
insights concerned have to be brought to light in or-
der to make the methodical procedures philosophically 
intelligible. 
The evidence on which ali knowledge finally rests 
is not simply a natural gift of human perception or 
even intuition. Rather, evidence can only be obtained 
through its own specific procedure, and it requires its 
own way of proof. Husserl, it is true, started his anal-
ysis of evidence with his often cited, and often misun-
derstood, version of evidence as experience (Erlebnis) 
and even as the "experience oftruth." This experience, 
however, does not mean a special kind or class of in-
tentiona! acts, since it does not have its own typical 
abject, a feature that belongs structurally to ali inten-
tions, as is the case with experiences like PERCEPTION, 
MEMORY, EXPECTATION, and SO forth, which each have 
their own type of objectivity. On the contrary, the ob-
jectivity correlated to the so-called experience oftruth 
or evidence is nothing other than something that is 
evidently perceived, remembered, or judged, whereas 
something evident as such would not make any sense. 
Accordingly, experiences of evidence do not have a 
special intentiona! status, as though there would be 
certa in acts of consciousness "directed toward" some-
thing, and this something would be truth. 
On the contrary, evidence cannot be conceived of 
phenomenologically except in relation to a distinctive 
mode of givenness through which an intended abject is 
not determined, but only qualified in a certain way. In 
other words, evidence can by no means be attributed to 
the objectivity in question as though it were an adherent 
or intrinsic quality of it; rather, it must be brought 
to that objectivity. Thus evidence turns out to be an 
achievement of consciousness that has nothing to do 
with simply "seeing" that such and such is the case. 
Rather, it requires a considerable amount of cognitive 
activity. 
This raises the question of what phenomenolog-
ically characterizes and distinguishes that which is 
grasped in evidence or as evident. To begin with ev-
idence as regarding a special mode of givenness of 
something objective, one has to realize that in pheno-
menology the intended abject in these modes is gen-
erally comprehended "as" something or in a certain 
"sense." This also refers to the modalities of the be-
ing of the abject, e.g., "certainly existing," "probably 
existing," "necessarily existing," and so on. Of special 
importance is the modality of"truly existing," because 
its claim requires justificati an. This is due to the pheno-
menological fact that only by proving the legitimacy 
of such a claim do acts of consciousness take on the 
character of knowledge. 
It is here that one of the most essential aspects 
of phenomenological method appears. Husserl makes 
a sharp distinction between "empty intentions" ( or 
merely "signitive intentions") and their "intuitive ful-
fillment" (anschauliche Erfullung). This distinction is 
of decisive importance, particularly for the understand-
ing ofthe phenomenological conception of evidence. 
To intend something does not yet mean to know 
it in a strict epistemological sense. Intentions merely 
referring to objects are just acts of consciousness that 
legitimate the concept ofthe abject as "given." But its 
givenness by no means guarantees knowledge. For ex-
ample, something objective that is merely thought in an 
empty or signitive act, e.g., in aur ordinary inauthentic 
speech (uneigentliche Rede), is remote from the thing 
itself. It is not yet shown. Further activities are needed 
~ 
namely, those acts of intuitive fulfillment by which 
something given obtains its material fullness and intu-
itive presence, and in this way becomes "self-given" or 
"itself-given" (selbstgegeben). The experience of ev-
idence is in the final analysis nothing other than the 
experience of the self-givenness of something. And if 
evidence is also the experience oftruth, then truth must 
be understood as the objective correlate of the act of 
giving something as it itself. Thus the phenomenologi-

204 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
cal concept of self-givenness proves tobe indispensible 
for understanding the concept of evidence as well as 
the fundamental phenomenological concept oftruth. 
The experience of evidence, however, has by no 
means the character of a singular intention. That can be 
seen from the fact that evidence requires a synthesis of 
coincidence of empty intention and fulfillment, which 
corresponds, on the objective side, with a synthesis of 
identificati an of the abject in order to make it present 
as "itself." Consequently, the phenomenological usage 
ofthe "matter (Sache) itself' is not meant in compari-
son to another abject, because even an empty intention 
already intends the matter itself and not another state 
of affairs. However, the "matter itself' is, qua itself, 
not yet given, unless fulfilling activities carne into play. 
Thus the concept of the "matter itself' is to be under-
stood only in contrast to deficient modes of givenness 
of the same state of affairs. Husserl has repeatedly 
stressed this fact and emphasized that the "profuse ex-
pression" of self-givenness serves to exclude the vague 
generality of the concept of givenness. 
It may be doubted whether Husserl's characteriza-
tion of all fulfilling intentions as "intuitions" (Anschau-
ungen) was advisable, especially since he carried this 
concept over into the categoria) realm, speaking of 
"categoria) intuitions," and, as such, giving it a ro le in 
EIDETIC METHOD. However, he does not use the concept 
ofintuition in its traditional meaning as the opposite of 
the concept of thought, as though both acts were cor-
related to different objectivities. Instead, intuition here 
always functions as the fulfillment of signitive inten-
tions, so that the intuition of something cannot be char-
acterized once and for ali, in relation to itself. Rather, 
intuition can only be determined phenomenologically 
in recourse to the corresponding signitive intentions. 
It follows that every type of abject corresponds exclu-
sively to a certain mode of fulfillment that is essential 
to it and cannot be arbitrarily modified. This means 
that evidence is subject to varying norms ofperfection 
depending upon what kind and "style" of evidence it 
is. Obviously the kind and style of performing evi-
dence through fulfilling empty or signitive intentions 
differs according to type of object. For instance, the 
self-givenness of an object in sensuous perception dif-
fers from the self-givenness of something categoria), 
such as an object in NATURAL SCIENCE. 
Furthermore, it is important to note that even for 
a particular type of abject, perfect or "adequate" evi-
dence cannot be achieved in every intuitive fulfillment. 
Rather, each kind of evidence also has various grades 
and levels of approximation to the object. They mark 
stages on the way to achieving perfect evidence. The 
fact that the fulfillment of intention is in principle capa-
ble ofbeing increased shows that the phenomenologi-
cal concept of evidence is basically a methodological 
concept, rather than the concept of the lucid certainty 
of an intuited truth. Accordingly, evident insight can 
in principle be erroneous. Not only may empty inten-
tions be frustrated and then result in new evidence 
established through conflict, but they may also be erro-
neously fulfilled, thus yielding to merely presumptive 
evidence that requires correction. At the same time, 
however, the fact that evidence can be deceptive, mis-
leading, and merely assumed to be evidence means 
that the correction of deceptive evidence can only be 
carried out on the hasis ofbetter evidence, upon which 
the former evidence "shatters." This clearly shows the 
methodological orientation of Husserl 's concept of ev-
idence. Thus evidence is not a "miraculous" capacity 
for gaining absolute truth, as it may have appeared to 
beat first sight, or even as some philosophers have un-
derstood it. Rather, it is a critica) court ofappeal before 
which ali steps in the search for truth are subjected to 
triaJ by verification.

EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY 
205 
EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY 
In its 
most rudimentary sense, phenomenology is an effort 
carefully to describe the fundamental structures of ex-
perience -
the ways in which we encounter, come 
to apprehend, and come to express the meaning of 
the surrounding world of things and other people to-
gether with ourselves and our perceptions, feelings, 
thoughts, and actions. Taken in this sense, pheno-
menology forms part of many, even most, projects 
undertaken by philosophers whether they would call 
themselves phenomenologists or not. EDMUND HUSSERL 
gave phenomenology its direction as a distinctive 
movement, however, by combining a passion to re-
turn to these concretely experienced "matters them-
selves" with idealism, in what he termed transcenden-
tal or CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY. The different di-
rection given by existential phenomenology arises in 
the 1930s and 1940s in reaction to Husserl 's idealism. 
In part through the inftuence of Husserl 's own !ater 
work and the thought of HEGEL, MAX SCHELER, KARL 
JASPERS, and MARTIN HEIDEGGER, french thinkers such as 
GABRIEL MARCEL, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY, and SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR fused phenomenology 
with their projects for an existential philosophy. 
Husserl had asked the phenomenological investi-
gator to suspend his or her practica!, scientific, and 
ontologica] commitments (the EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION), 
so as reftectively to grasp (in eidetic insight) the essen-
tial structures of the ftow of experiences in and for the 
experiencing subject, e.g., INTENTIONALITY. He believed 
that by pursuing this self-reftective task (the strategy of 
phenomenological-eidetic reduction ), it would become 
apparent that our concrete experiences of self, others, 
and world, as well as our reftective judgments and lin-
guistic articulations of them, are constituted through 
the activity of an absolute subject (the transcenden-
tal EGO). The goal of phenomenology- and, Husserl 
thought, the goal of human REASON itself- would be 
to bring this reduction to completion- to exhibit, in 
transcendental reftection, the active self-constitution of 
ali forms of experience and judgment. EXISTENTIALISM, 
on the other hand, from Kierkegaard and Nietzsche 
on, had emphasized the fragility of reason, the con-
tingency of existence, and the need for human beings 
to create themselves and the meaning of their lives, 
not through observation and reftection but by free and 
resolute action. How is it that phenomenology, as a 
philosophy of contemplative reason, could be brought 
to converge with an existential philosophy of worldly 
involvement? 
One answer to this question is that the French 
thinkers who called themselves "existentialists" be-
lieved that they could use Husserl 's descriptive method 
in areas and on the very phenomena of contingency 
and involvement that would be central to a philoso-
phy of human existence. Beauvoir, in L 'invitee ( 1943 ), 
and Sartre, in La nausee ( 1938), used the novel to 
describe various modes of interpersonal relations and 
experiences of contingency and freedom. Sartre also 
worked out explicitly phenomenological accounts of 
IMAGINATION and emotion. He understood his theory 
of the emotions- according to which they are ways 
in which the world is magically transformed and we 
"live" it as "joyful" or "sad" -
to be a direct appli-
cation of Husserl 's EIDETIC METHOD for describing the 
intentionality of consciousness (Esquisse d 'une theorie 
des emotions, 1939). 
Moreover, Husserl himselfhad focused, in Die Kri-
sis der europăischen Wissenscha(ten und die transzen-
dentale Phănomenologie ( 1936) and other late works, 
on the need to turn phenomenological analysis toward 
the primordial, pre-reftective world of everyday expe-
rience (the Lebenswelt or LIFEWORLD) as the founding 
source of conscious life. He had emphasized the pas-
sivity of perception, the experience of the living body, 
and the constitution ofthe self- even ofthe transcen-
dental ego- through a temporal process, in interplay 
with other se]ves (INTERSUBJECTIVITY) and within the 
primordiallifeworld. Thus it was natural for Marcel to 
consider, at least for a time, that phenomenology was 
an appropriate means for him to develop his account of 
the mixed and paradoxical experience of being one's 
own BODY and, through this experience, ofbeing in the 
presence of other existents and of participating in the 
"mystery of Being" itself (Etre et avoir, [Being and 
having, 1935]). And it was equally natural for Beau-
voir, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty, in ways very different 
from Marcel and from one another, to appropriate and 
extend phenomenological insights as they offered their 
descriptions of the bodily, interpersonal, and histori-
cal contingencies of the human condition. However, 
these French thinkers saw that despite Husserl 's ef-
forts to create a purely descriptive science, his linking 
of phenomenology with transcendental idealism had 

206 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
limited its power and, they believed, distorted it. The 
influence of idealism, they thought, had led Husserl to 
focus phenomenology preeminently on cognitive life, 
and in the end, had dictated that the self (as pure tran-
scendental subject) could neither be genuinely open to 
the world, nor be at risk before it, thus failing to do 
justice to the primary phenomena ofhuman bodily, so-
cial, and historical existence. As a result they aimed to 
orient phenomenology away from idealism and instead 
toward some form of realism. 
Marcel saw the possibilities for a phenomenology 
of incarnation and of hope, of the fullness of embod-
ied human being open to Being, as a form ofChristian 
philosophy (Le mystere de 1 'C!re [The mystery of be-
ing, 1949]). Beauvoir, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty, on 
the other hand, saw the possibilities for a phenomen-
ology of human finitude and freedom, an avowedly 
nontheistic philosophy. They were aware of Hegel's 
"phenomenology" in the Phănomenologie des Geistes 
-
especially his analyses of desire, of the "unhappy 
consciousness," and of the dialectic of master and 
slave. They saw Marx's early humanist writings as 
material for a phenomenology ofhuman economic ex-
istence. And they also had before them the example 
of Heidegger's distinctive appropriation of Husserl's 
phenomenology in Sein und Zeit ( 1927). Heidegger 
appeared to them to be giving a phenomenological 
analysis of human existence, in terms of "being-in-
the-world," as part of an inquiry into the meaning of 
Being itseJf (HERMENEUTIC AL PHENOMENOLOGY). Sartre 
and Merleau-Ponty hoped, by following his lead, to 
redirect phenomenology in such a way as to exhibit 
human reality within a fu li philosophical ontology-
centrally, in Sartre 's L 'etre et le neant ( 1943), as well as 
in Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenologie de la perception 
( 1945) and Le visible et l 'invisible ( 1964 ). Beauvoir, on 
the other hand, questioned the possibility of a universal 
ontology. In Le deuxieme sexe (The second sex, 1949) 
and La vieillesse (Old age, 1970) she emphasized the 
ways in which human reality is informed and crossed 
by gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age, class, and histor-
ical moment, and hence by the dynamics of power, 
oppression, and liberation. 
Thus "existential phenomenology" can be seen tobe 
the name for a tendency ofthought, developed very dif-
ferently by different hands, in which phenomenology 
is tobe freed from idealism and focused on human ex-
istence and, within that new ontologica! commitment, 
provided with a conceptual framework to give its de-
scriptions fresh revealing power and adequacy. 
What ha ve been some ofthe main fruits ofthis exis-
tential turn? Marcel 's analyses of human embodiment 
ha ve proved to be of lasting value, and they were an 
important influence on both Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. 
However, Marcel soon distanced himself from exis-
tentialism and phenomenology as he saw them devel-
oping, so it was Beauvoir, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty 
who shaped existential phenomenology as we know it. 
It is best, therefore, to focus on them, friends- and at 
times friendly enemies- whose work shows a com-
mon ground, albeit with a richness ofdifference as well. 
The common ground !ies in the concern to elucidate 
Heidegger's description of DASEIN, human existence, 
in terms of finitude and freedom, and to discern the 
implications of this across aspects of human thought 
and ACTION. They ali see the human condition as one 
of a contingent or "situated freedom." The difference 
!ies in the way in which each tends to understand this 
formative phenomenon. 
For Sartre, whose ontology contains an opposition 
between self and WORLD in the form of the duality of 
consciousness (the for-itself) and being (the in-itself), 
freedom is identica! to the spontaneity of conscious-
ness itself. Freedom is categorica!, what human exis-
tence simply is, such that at every moment the entire 
meaning of one's life is at stake. For this reason people 
typically preferto cover it up in "bad faith." Freedom is 
situated, however, in that one confronts externa! con-
ditions within which one must act -
conditions set 
by one's body, by one's HISTORY and circumstances, by 
the social realities presented by other people, and, ulti-
mately, by one's own death. And yet it is always con-
scious freedom that determines the meaning of these 
limiting conditions -
as Sartre puts it, a cliff is not 
"unclimbable" unless 1 aim to climb it, a particular 
social condition is not "unbearable" unless 1 project 
a better one that 1 might bring about instead. Thus, 
while "there is freedom only in a situation ... there is 
a situation only through freedom." Being in-itself-
the exterior reality confronting consciousnesss, which 
Sartre posits in his opposition to Husserlian idealism-
is meaningless; it is given meaning only for conscious-
ness. The freedom of one's individual consciousness, 
as the creation ofmeaning, is in this way, and in a way 

EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY 
207 
strangely reminiscent of Husserl, absolute. 
Not so, thinks Merleau-Ponty. Our chosen ends do 
not simply determine the meanings of things. Rather, 
to be a "situated freedom" is to find, precisely prior 
to any choice of ends, that one is already engaged 
with a meaningful world that both solicits and resists. 
"Our freedom does not destroy our situation," Merleau-
Ponty says, but "gears itself to it." Prior to my choice, 
that cliffwould appear difficult forme to climb because 
it exceeds the power of my body to take it in stride, and 
certain social situations are lived by me as painful, and 
would motivate my changing them, well before I see 
any way to do so. Our freedom to create meaning is 
conditiona!, not absolute. We are systems ofbodily and 
social intentions be(ore we choose, before we are per-
sons. Rather than Sartre 's radical opposition between 
the for-itself of individual consciousness and the in-
itself ofbeing, Merleau-Ponty believes- in a manner 
similar to that of Marcel- that we experience a gen-
uine reciprocity between them. Being-within being, not 
being-against it, human beings perceiving meaning in 
the world as well as expressing and constituting mean-
ing.far it- these would be the themes, he thinks, of a 
more adequate existential phenomenology of situated 
freedom. 
This basic ontologica! difference between Sartre 
and Merleau-Ponty yields differing emphases through-
out their phenomenologies. Sartre sees consciousness 
and bodily processes as distinct; for Merleau-Ponty, 
consciousness is "being toward the world through the 
body." Sartre sees consciousness as actively creating 
its meanings in the face of conditions in the natural and 
social world, while Merleau-Ponty sees consciousness 
primarily as perceptual, a mixed "passive-activity" re-
sponding to and emerging from those same conditions. 
Sartre sees us in a kind of constant combat with other 
people- the other's "look" that he finds exemplary 
is one that surprises and assaults us, an objectifying 
one. For Merleau-Ponty, on the other hand, we see 
"with" the other- we are able to be in conflict only 
because we are first in communion and communicate 
with each other through bodily gesture and LANGUAGE. 
Sartre notes the potential in each new moment for us 
radically to change, to reinterpret, our personal his-
tories; Merleau-Ponty tends to find that our histories 
already contain just the fragmentary meanings upon 
which we must draw in order to do so. 
Beauvoir, for her part, while sharing Sartre and 
Merleau-Ponty's focus on the lived experience of sit-
uated freedom, rejects their pretensions to some uni-
versal ontology in which, as she sees it, man s expe-
rience comes to be the universal and woman 's a mere 
appendage. In Le deuxieme sexe~ she argues that the 
ontology of an absolute "I" is an invention, a repres-
sive ontology of man asserting power over the "other," 
identified as woman. Thus while in the present time 
and condition, man may be a "being toward the world 
through his body," woman :~ situation is such that she is 
not her body- e.g., she is not tobe identified with her 
biologica! possibility of procreation, her desirability as 
a sexual object for another, etc. This is due, not to a 
lack in women, but rather to the concrete conditions of 
the present moment in history that are to be resisted. 
In this way, Beauvoir moves toward a view of lived 
experience that is radically particular and plural. For 
her, social change is the aim ofphilosophy- the pri-
mary task is to frame an account of humanity that is 
morally responsible, one that can serve in the struggle 
for human liberation. She thus emphasizes the social 
dimension in every choice. To continue the earlier ex-
ample, o ne might climb that clifffreely, or in servitude, 
and by climbing the cliff o ne might free oneself, or one 
might oppress or limit another person. What counts 
in such a situation are the consequences for collective 
freedom. She believes that we are, as Dostoyevsky 
said, "responsible for everything and to every human 
being." What is most important, in her view, is an ap-
proach to understanding freedom that might shape the 
mutual creation of a collective freedom. 
Thus we hear severa! quite different voices within 
existential phenomenology- sti li within the intention 
to seek out those phenomena that disclose the situated 
freedom ofthe human condition and to interpret human 
reality in terms of them. Where, one might now ask, 
has this orientation led us and what does it promise 
for the future? In response, one can only venture one's 
own assessment. 
Methodologically, one has to say, using Merleau-
Ponty's words, that "the most important lesson which 
the reduction teaches us is the impossibility of a com-
plete reduction." That is to say, a faithful phenomen-
ology of human being-in-the-world shows that our 
lived experience cannot, in principle, become fully 
transparent to reflection. And it shows that this very 

208 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
"showing in principle" is a contingent truth of his-
torical reflection: phenomenology shares the situated 
character of ali rational inquiry. It is itself an ongo-
ing enterprise of human freedom and finitude that can 
at each point, at best, offer partially and incompletely 
convergent understandings of human experience, and 
attempt to put those understandings to use in thinking 
through the issues posed by fresh forms of scientific 
thought and social action. 
Substantively, one can try to formulate some con-
vergent understandings that come out of the work of 
Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and Beauvoir, and that may be 
seen to offer a framework for further philosophical de-
velopment. 
{1) First and foremost, it is living (or "lived") ex-
perience that is the primary reference point for ali 
philosophical reflection. The world is inexhaustible 
and transcends us; we are inevitably out in the mid-
dle of it; it is experienced to exist independently of 
us. At the same time, the world is what, in the most 
inclusive sense, we experience (or perceive) it tobe. 
There is no world "behind" or "beneath" the world of 
our primordiallived experience. 
(2) The abstractions of thought and the rules of 
practice, in science, philosophy, and society, ha ve their 
significance through the fact that they express some 
meaning of, refer us back to, or order our actions in 
respect to certain aspects of this primordially experi-
enced world. Such expressions of meaning- as in a 
physical or psychological theory, in an ethical rute, in 
a work of art, or, primordially, in language itself- are 
never a mirroring, but creative conferrals, motivated 
by a living, complex, and ambiguous context, under-
taken for living, complex, and ambiguous purposes, 
and subject to assessment in the same terms. 
(3) Specifically, the traditional conceptual polari-
ties of self-world, mind-body, conception-perception, 
thought-feeling, individual-society, and present-past 
( or present-future) should not be taken to represent du-
alisms in which independent realities interact. In living 
experience, each term encroaches upon-and requires 
-the other. 
( 4) Thus the self and the environing natural and so-
cial world have the experienced meanings they have 
through a reciproca! interplay. It is not possible defini-
tively to assign specific phenomena to one or the other 
alone -everything we experience is both "given" and 
"interpreted," natural and social, familiar and new. 
(5) Individual behavior is always an expression both 
of individual effort, desire, and belicf, on the one hand, 
and the solicitations ofhabitual bodily and social prac-
tices on the other. Every action is a fresh involvement, 
but it is also always motivated by its context. History, 
as we li ve it, is never determined, but it is never simply 
invented either. 
(6) Finally, the mind is thoroughly entangled with 
the body, conception with perception, thought with 
feeling, the present with the past and future. If we 
take our lived experience as fundamental, conscious 
mental life cannot be reduced either to objective bod-
ily processes -
as with materialist neuroscience -
or to some distinct property or activity presiding over 
( or merely accompanying) them- as in various forms 
of dualism. Conscious mental life is both irreducibly 
intentiona! and irreducibly physical. We have to sec 
these competing analyses as perspectiva!, useful for 
certain limited purposes, and rendered coherent only 
by reference back to the primordial lived experience 
upon which they bear. 
Positions such as these lie behind the efforts ofmany 
contemporary thinkers in the UNITED STATES. One can 
only give a few selected examples. 
HUBERT DREYFUS has made important contributions 
to the philosophy ofmind through his use ofMerleau-
Ponty's and Heidegger 's analyses of embodied percep-
tion and action critically to assess the cogency of cer-
tain models ofthe mind offered by practitioners in AR-
TIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ( What Computers Stil/ Can 't Do, 
1993, and Mind over Machine, 1986). DAVID MICHAEL 
LEVIN (The Listening Self, 1989) and ALPHONSO LINGIS 
(Libido- The French Existential Theories, 1985) ha ve 
drawn upon Merleau-Ponty's thought in fresh reflec-
tions on psychology, psychopathology, and cu! ture. ED-
WARD s. CASEY has created an original account of the 
worlds ofimagination and memory, initiated by reflec-
tion on Husserl's, Sartre's, and Merleau-Ponty's work 
(lmagining, 1976, and Rememhering, 1987). MARTIN 
DILLON shows how Merleau-Ponty can give a compre-
hensive ontologica! vision (Merleau-Ponty :S Ontology, 
1988). 
HENRY PIETERSMA and others have sought to for-
mulate and extend Merleau-Ponty's theory of knowl-

EXISTENTIALISM 
209 
edge and science (Merleau-Pon~v: Critica! Essays, 
1989). THOMAS FLYNN (Sartre and Marxist Existential-
ism, 1984), James Schmidt (Mer/eau-Ponty: Between 
Phenomenology and Structuralism, 1985), BERNARD 
DAUENHAUER (The Po/itics of Hope, 1985), and SONIA 
KRUKS (Situation and Human Existence, 1990) have 
interpreted and extended Sartre's and Merleau-Ponty's 
analyses of situated action in the context of contem-
porary social and politica! thought. LEWIS R. GORDON 
(Bad Faith and Antiblack Racism, 1994) draws on 
Sartre's work in examining racist attitudes and prac-
tices. RICHARD M. ZANER has opened up the philosophical 
analysis of clinica! medical ethics by iliuminating the 
experiencc of illness with insights from Marcel 's and 
Merleau-Ponty's accounts ofembodied life (Ethics and 
the Clinica! Encounter, 1988). EUGENE KAELIN has elab-
orated upon Sartre's and Merleau-Ponty's philosophies 
of art (An Existentialist Aesthetic, 1962). Finally, Jerry 
Gill has developed a theory of metaphoricallanguage 
on the basis ofMerleau-Ponty's philosophy (Merleau-
Ponty s Metaphorical Philosophy, 1991 ). 
Overviews of this form of phenomenology include 
HANNAH ARENDT's "What is Existenz Philosophy?" 
( 1946); NATHANIEL LAWRENCE and DANIEL O'CONNOR's 
anthology, Readings in Existential Phenomenology 
( 196 7), and PAUL RICCEUR 's "Phenomenologie existen-
tielie" (in the Encyclopedie Franr;aise, 1957). 
It has been an omission in Continental philoso-
phy that until the emergence of feminism, Beauvoir 
has not been widely recognized as central to discus-
sions of phenomenology. To correct this, JEFFNER ALLEN 
and IRIS MARION YOUNG have edited an anthoJogy that 
discusses relations between French existential pheno-
menology and POST-MODERNISM, French feminisms, and 
feminist philosophy in the United States (The Thinking 
Muse: Feminism and Recent French Thought, 1989). 
Judith Butler ( Gender Troub/e, 1989) draws upon the 
anti-essentialism of some existential phenomenology 
to give an account of gender as performance. Kate 
Fulibrook and Edward Fulibrook (Simone de Beauvoir 
and Jean-Paul Sartre: The Remaking of a Twentieth-
Centwy Legend, 1994) offer a detai\ed study, based 
primarily on recently published materials, that com-
pletely al ters the customary accounts of the relation-
ship between these two phenomenologists. Many other 
thinkers are building from existential phenomenology 
toward fresh philosophical insights in FEMINISM, PSYCHI-
ATRY, philosophy of nature, ECOLOGY, and philosophy 
of RELIGION. 
EXISTENTIALISM 
JOHN 1. COMPTON 
Vanderhilt University 
The expression "existen-
tialism" is used in a narrow and in a broad sense. 
One understands by existentialism in the narrow sense 
the philosophy of JEAN-PAUL SARTRE and further also 
the thoughts of ali thinkers who in their philosophical 
works, but also in literature and art, ha ve tried to make 
the philosophy of Sartre more concrete and develop it 
into new directions. Philosophers who have foliowed 
Sartre in essential points include SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR 
and FRANCIS JEANSON, but certainly not Albert Camus, 
who is an absurdist. 
Jean-Paul Sartre has given us a popular descrip-
tion of what he understood by existentialism in 
L 'existentialisme est un humanisme ( 1946). There he 
says about his own philosophy: atheistic existentialism 
states that if God does not exist, there is stil! at least 
one being in whom existence precedes essence, a be-
ing who exists before he or she can be defined by any 
concept, and this being is the human reality, or, as MAR-
TIN HEIDEGGER says, human DASEIN. What is meant here 
by saying that existcnce precedes essence? It means 
first of ali that the human being exists, appears on the 
scene, and only afterwards defines himself or herself. 
If the human reality, as the existentialist conceives of 
it, is undefinable, it is because at first a human being is 
nothing. Only afterwards wili one be something, and 
each one will have to make what he or she wili be. 
Thus there is no human nature because there is no God 
to conceive of it. Not only is a human being what one 
conceives of oneself to be, but one is also that which 
one wilis oneself to be through one's thrust toward 
existence. 
One is nothing but what one is able to make of 
oneself. This is the first principle of existentialism, 
for which the denial of the existence of God is essen-
tial. The human being is also called a subject; this is 
the name we give ourselves when charges are brought 
against us. By this wc mean that one has a greater dig-
nity than a stone ora table. Thus we mean that one first 
exists, throws him- or herselftoward the future, and is

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
aware of the fact that he or she can imagine him- or 
herselfto be in the future. At the start one is a plan that 
is aware of itself, rather than a patch of moss, a piece 
of garbage, ora cauliflower. Nothing exists before this 
plan, because there is nothing in heaven tobe imitated. 
One will be what he or she has planned to be. By the 
word "will" we usually mean a conscious deci sion that 
is subsequent to what we have already made of our-
selves. 1 may want to belong to a particular politica! 
party, write a symphony, or get married. Yet ali ofthis 
is only a manifestation of an earlier, more spontaneous 
choice that is called "will." Now if existence really 
does precede essence, then o ne is responsible for what 
he or she is. Thus the first move of existentialism is to 
make every human being aware of what he or she is, 
and to make the fui! responsibility of their existence 
rest on each o ne of them. And when we say that each 
human being is responsible for him- or herself, we do 
not only mean that he or she is responsible for his or her 
own individuality, but that each one ofus is responsible 
for ali human beings. 
When existentialists use the term "subjectivism," 
they do not just mean that each individual chooses and 
makes him- or herself, but rather that it is impossible 
for humans to transcend human subjectivity. When ex-
istentialists use the term "subject" they mean to say 
that each human being chooses his or her own self, and 
that in making this choice every human being chooses 
ali humans. For in creating the human being we want to 
be, there is not a single one of our acts that does notat 
the same time create an ideal ofthe human being as we 
think he or she ought tobe. To choose to be this or that 
is to affirm at the same time the meaning of what we 
choose, because we can never choose evi!. We always 
choose what is good, and nothing can be good for us if 
it is not good for ali. 
lf existence precedes essence and if we grant that 
we exist and make our image at the same time, the 
image is valid for everyone and for our entire age. 
Thus our responsibility is much greater than one might 
have supposed, because it involves humankind as a 
whole. This may help us understand what is meant by 
"big" words such as anguish, forlornness, and despair, 
often used in existentialist literature. 
What is meant by anguish is that one is in anguish, 
for the person who gets involved~and who realizes 
that he or she is not just the person o ne chooses to be, 
but is also a lawmaker who at the same time chooses 
ali humankind -
cannot help escape the feeling of 
responsibility. Obviously there are many people who 
do not seem tobe anxious. But the existentialist claims 
that they are hiding their anxiety and are fleeing from 
their responsibility. Anguish is evident even when it 
conceals itself, and everyone who conceals anguish is 
simply in bad faith. 
In his major work, L 'etre et le neant( 1943 }, in which 
he gives an outline ofhis phenomenological ontology, 
Sartre explicitly refers, at the very end of his investi-
galion, to the ethical implications of his ontology. At 
that point, in 1943, he promised to develop a more 
systematic existentialist ETHICS in a !ater work, but this 
book only appeared posthumously. Instead he wrote 
the popular lecture in which he directly touches on 
the moral implications of his ontologica! position. By 
1950, according to Beauvoir, Sartre had come to the 
conclusion that the project ofworking out a systematic 
ethics had become irrelevant, ifnot completely impos-
sible. In her view he gradually came to the insight that 
the ethical attitude begins to appear in a bourgeois so-
ciety when technological and social conditions render 
positive conduct impossible; ethics is no more than 
a collection of some idealist devices to help us live 
the life that poverty of resources and lack of technical 
means impose upon us. Yet Sartre's !ater development 
has shown that there is more to this than just what 
Beauvoir claims here. It is beyond the scope of this 
entry to deal with the issues connected with Sartre 's 
position after he had turned to MARXISM. Let us there-
fore turn instead to what L 'etre et le neant provides as 
the ontologica] foundation of his existentialism. 
In this book, Sartre intended to deal with the ques-
tion of Being. After a brief analysis, performed in the 
introduction, he comes to the conclusion that the ba-
sic ontologica! problem is tantamount to the question 
concerning the relation between the in-itself and the 
for-itself, i.e., between the natural world and the hu-
man being. He agrees with Heidegger that in order to 
find an answer to this question, one must realize the 
human reality, which, as being-in-the-world, is a con-
crete whole in which the two poles are never united. 
It is within this concrete unity of one's relation to the 
world ofnature that concrete forms ofreference to the 
world can be singled out and analyzed as the conditions 
oftheir possibilities. 

EXISTENTIALISM 
211 
Taking o ne 's questioning attitude as a kind ofhuman 
conduct, Sartre comes to the conclusion that nonbeing 
must be conceived of as a component of what is reaL 
This nonbeing is not the consequence of an act ofnega-
tion, such as the negative judgment, nor does it depend 
on negation as a category, as in Kant, nor can it be 
explained by the in-itself, which is pure positivity. On 
the other hand, as incapable of existing by itself, it calls 
for a nothingness at its origin that is a structural feature 
ofwhat is reaL 
Furthermore, there are a great number of realities 
experienced by the human reality that are inhabited 
by negation in their inner structure. These negatitees, 
too, require that nothingness cannot be conceived of 
outside Being and that although nothingness is given 
in the heart of Being, it cannot have its origin in the 
in-itself. Therefore, the question arises: where does 
nothingness come from, if it cannot be conceived of 
either outside of Being or in terms of Being, and if 
as nonbeing it cannot derive from itself the necessary 
force to nihilate itself? The answer is that there must 
be a being (not the in-itself) whose property it is to 
nihilate nothingness. This being is the human being. A 
careful analysis of the human questioning attitude as 
well as ofthe negatitees mentioned shows clearly that 
it is the human being who brings nothingness about. 
This thesis, however, provokes another question. What 
must human beings then be in their being in order that 
through them nothingness can come into being? For 
being can only generate being. Thus the human reality 
must be able to put itself outside of being. This can-
not be done by just annihilating things, but by putting 
concrete things out of circuit and by putting ourselves 
out of circuit in re gard to them. The human being can 
retire behind a nothingness. This possibility to secrete 
nothingness is what Sartre calls freedom. 
However, this freedom -
taken as the source of 
the nothingness in the world -
is not a property of 
human actions, nor a property connected with a human 
essence; freedom is the very being of the human be-
ing insofar as he or she conditions the appearance of 
nothingness in the world. Freedom taken as the typi-
cal mode ofthe human being, which precedes essence, 
means that human beings can detach themselves from 
the world. This implies that human beings first repose 
in the depth ofBeing, and then detach themselves from 
it by a nihilating withdrawaL But this is possible only 
iffreedom is necessarily interwoven with temporality. 
In other words, the condition on which human beings 
can deny ali or part ofBeing is that human beings carry 
nothingness within themselves as the nothing that sepa-
rates their present from ali oftheir past and their fu ture 
from their present. Freedom is the human reality it-
self putting its own past out of play by secreting its 
own nothingness; this original necessity of being its 
own nothingness does not belong to human consious-
ness on the occasion of particular negations only, but 
is one's innermost mode of being. In freedom, and as 
freedom, each human being is his or her own past and 
future in the form ofnihilation. 
It is in anguish that human beings become conscious 
ofthemselves as freedom: anguish is the mode ofbeing 
as consciousness of being. Anguish is precisely my 
consciousness of being my own future in the mode 
of not-being. The self 1 am depends upon the self 1 
am not yet, to the exact extent that the self 1 am not 
yet does not depend upon the self that 1 am. In other 
words, the freedom that reveals itself to us in anguish 
must be characterized by the existence of a nothing 
that insinuates itself between motive and act. On the 
other hand, anguish as the manifestation offreedom in 
the face of the self arises by means of reflection; this 
means that the human reality is always separated from 
the essence of a nothingness, for essence is what has 
been. Essence is everything in the human reality that 
we can indicate with the expression: it is. The human 
act is always beyond that essence, taken as what has 
been already. Anguish appears as an apprehension of 
the self insofar as the self exists in the perpetua! mode 
of detachment from what has been. 
It is true that anguish is very seldom encountered in 
our world.lt occurs only when consciousness sees itself 
cut offfrom its own essence by nothing, and separated 
from its fu ture by its very freedom. Yet most ofthe time 
each human being is engaged in what is tobe done; thus 
the human reality transcends itself in the direction of 
the things of the world. Then one remains within the 
realm ofnonreflective consciousness. But in each case 
there is and remains the possibility of putting this act 
in question and bringing the human reality into the 
situation described above. Anguish only is by means 
of reflection. 
The same is true for the relation between ethical 
anguish and our everyday morality. There is ethical 

212 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
anguish only when I consider myself as the original 
relation to values. Then I realize that my freedom is 
the unique foundation of values, and that abolutely 
nothing justifies me in adopting this or that particular 
set of values. As a being by whom values exist, I am 
completely unjustifiable. My freedom is anguished at 
being the foundation of VALUES, although I myself am 
without any foundation. 
But although it is my continuous possibility to over-
turn the whole set of values, ordinarily my attitude to 
values is eminently reassuring: I am just engaged in 
a world of values without putting them into question. 
Usually, my being is immediately in a sitution. In the 
world of the immediate 1 find values that ultimately 
derive their meaning from an original projection of 
myselfthat stands as my choice ofmyselfin the world. 
But as soon as 1 reftect on my condition, the possibility 
of anguish is there again. Then 1 know that I do not 
have any recourse to any value against the simple fact 
that it is I who must create and sustain values, whatever 
they may be. Nothing can assure me against myself, 
cut off from the world and from my essence by the 
nothingness that 1 am. When 1 refuse to reftect on the 
undeniable fact, or when I ftee into a psychological 
determinism, or try to disarm my anguish by assert-
ing that I am my essence in the mode of being of the 
in-itself, then I am in bad faith. 
Human beings try to escape this bad faith by an 
effort to transcend their selves in order to eliminate 
their own lack ofbeing. In so doing each human being 
tries to become a being-for-itselfthat at the same time 
is a being-in-itself. But the totality one tries to achieve 
in this way cannot be given by nature, sin ce it combines 
the incompatible characteristics ofthe in-itself and the 
for-itself; any human effort to bring about that totality 
amounts to the useless passion of trying to become 
God. 
Now if the term "existentialism" is taken in the 
narrow and .proper sense it refers to the philosophy 
that is characterized by the ontology, the PHILOSOPHIC AL 
ANTHROPOLOGY, and the ethics proposed by Sartre in 
L 'etre et le neant and to the views ofthose people who 
have followed Sartre rather closely in these ideas. In 
contemporary thought this view has been overcome 
and is replaced by various forms of POST-MODERNISM, 
particularly JACQUES DERRIDA 's deconstruction. 
lf the term "existentialism" is taken in the broader 
sense, it stands for a number of different philosophical 
positions, in which some conception of existence, Exis-
tenz, or ek-sistence occupies a central position in every 
effort to come to some understanding of the meaning 
of Being. Taken in this sense, the term thus covers the 
phiJosophies of KARL JASPERS, GABRIEL MARCEL, MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER, and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, as well as the 
views of many people inftuenced by the ideas of the 
authors mentioned. 
Those who have tried to define existentialism in 
the broad sense in more detail have done so either 
by defining it in a negative manner, or by defining 
it by means of typical "existentialist" problems and 
issues with which certain authors, called "existential-
ists," concern themselves. The first route was taken by 
Walter Kaufmann, for whom existentialism is nota phi-
losophy, but a labei for severa! widely different revolts 
against traditional philosophy. Then existentialism is 
certainly not a school of thought, nor is it reducible 
to any set of tenets. The authors who appear invari-
ably on every list of existentialists- namely, Marcel, 
Jaspers, Heidegger, and Sartre- are not in agreement 
as far as essentials are concerned. If Nietzsche and 
Dostoevsky are included in the fold, one must make 
room for an impassioned anti-Christian and a Russian 
Orthodox imperialist. Once Rilke, Kafka, and Camus 
are added to the list, it will become obvious that an 
essential feature of ali these thinkers is their fervid in-
dividualism. Kaufmann concludes that the refusal to 
belong to any school ofthought, the repudiation ofthe 
adequacy of any body of beliefs, whatever they may 
be, and especially of systems, as well as a marked dis-
satisfaction with traditional philosophy as superficial, 
academic, and remote from life- that is the heart of 
existentialism. 
On the other hand, JOHN MACQUARRIE defines exis-
tentialism by its very typical style of philosophizing. 
He does not disagree with some ofthe claims made by 
Kaufmann, but feels that these negative claims do not 
go to the heart ofthe matter. Existentialism begins with 
the human being, not with nature. It does not define the 
human in terms of body and soul or consciousness, 
but rather as existence; its subject is the existent in the 
whole range of his or her existing. Existentialism can 
be defined further by the very typical set of problems 
and issues with which it concerns itself: freedom, deci-
sion, responsibility, finitude, guilt, alienation, despair, 

EXPECTAT!ON

death, and so on. 
As I see it, there is not much gained by maintaining 
the labei "existentialism" in such a broad sense. I think 
it is better to reserve the term for the philosophical 
position proposed in L 'etre et le neant and the works 
ofthose who were deeply inftuenced by its basic ideas. 
As for existentialism in the broad sense, I suggest we 
avoid the term altogether and try to find adequate labels 
for the philosophical positions developed by Jaspers, 
Marcel, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty.

EXPECTATION 
The word "expectation" will 
be used here as a generic term to refer to a class of ex-
periences that are directed toward the future, namely, 
those in which someone is aware of something as some-
thing he or she will actually experience in the fu ture. As 
such, expectation is what EDMUND HUSSERL calls "dox-
ically positing" consciousness, that is, consciousness 
that contains a belief that the expected content will 
be experienced. This distinguishes expectation from 
the phantasy of something as future, where there is 
no such belief, e.g., in the activity of planning, when 
different possibilities for the future are envisioned to 
occur if this or that course of action were undertaken. 
Two ways in which expectation can be experienced 
need to be distinguished, for one of them, which will 
be called "awaiting," has been much more important 
in phenomenological theory than the other. We may 
think about an appointment we ha ve next week, about a 
planned summer vacation months away, or even about 
something years away, being quite certain that these 
will ali be experienced by us. They are thus "expected." 
But these projected fu ture experiences may lack a kind 
of connection with the present that characterizes an 
"awaited" future. An "awaited" future is a particular 
future time that is experienced to be connected with 
the present in which the expecting takes place in such 
a way that one is aware of the present time as the 
beginning and the fu ture time as the end of a temporal 
span that forms a context within which o ne is presently 
living. This "living within" means that the awaiting, as 
a mental process, endures and is projected to be going 
to endure un tii what is expected is present ( even though 
it in fact might not endure that long). 
Although the example suggests it, the distinction 
here is not one that depends on the temporal distance 
of the expected future from the present. While it is 
much more common to "await" something that one is 
aware of as about to happen, it is possible to await 
a distant future as well. This can be the case with 
the experience of dread, for example. One can live 
in constant awareness of a dreaded event that is far 
off in the future, even if this living-in may often be 
in the background of mental life. Thus according to 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER 's analysis ofbeing human, ali people 
await death through a form of anxiety. This concept of 
anxiety plays a central role in Heidegger's thought, 
bringing, among other things, a sense of wholeness

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
and individuality to a human life. 
What is described here as "awaiting" is perhaps best 
recognized in the case of an act of awaiting, a men-
tal process that as a whole is an awaiting, where a 
person is actively busied with and attentive to what 
is expected. An example would be when someone is 
late for an appointment and awaits the arrival of his 
or her transportation. Although such an experience can 
involve looking, listening, hoping, fearing, etc., these 
mental processes are aii subordinated to and encom-
passed within a total act of continuai attending to the 
future event. 
An act of expectation (whether of the form of 
awaiting or not) can involve imaging of the fu-
ture and then would be what Husserl in Vorlesung 
zur Phănomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins 
[ 1905] caiis "intuitive expectation" (anschauliche Er-
wartung). Husserl's analysis of intuitive expectation, 
as weii as its counterpart, intuitive recoiiection, shows 
it to be a "reproductive" consciousness, meaning that 
it is an act that contains another act nested within it. 
In the case of imaging expectation, which is a RE-
PRESENTATION ( Vergegenwărtigung), there is an imaging 
of oneselfbeing in a fu ture present experiencing some-
thing. Thus in the actual present experiencing there is 
reproduced and "appears" a second experiencing of the 
expected content and this second experiencing has its 
own present and horizons of past and fu ture -
ali of 
which, for the present experiencing, are presented as 
"fu ture." 
Although the act of expectation is perhaps the most 
commonly recognized kind of expectation, it is not 
the type that has played the most significant role in 
phenomenological theory. That ro le is played by types 
of awaiting that are not fuii acts of expectation, but 
are non-independent parts of mental processes. Two of 
these types are most important: perceptual anticipation 
(and its possible counterpart in other kinds of experi-
ences) and protention. (The word "anticipation" wiii be 
used exclusively here to designate the first mentioned 
type. Husserl often used "Antizipation" in this way.) 
(1) Perceptual anticipations are non-independent 
parts of sensory perceptions. Husserl 's analysis of per-
ception shows that when perception of an object pro-
ceeds in such a way that different features of it come 
sequentiaiiy into direct awareness, there are always an-
ticipations at any given phase of the process that pre-
delineate or project that which is about tobe perceived. 
Alternatively, in the case of an unchanging object, there 
may be anticipations of the continuation of the sta tus 
quo. 
These anticipations are parts ofthe act ofperception 
and are not separate acts in their own right, although 
they may become the basis for separate acts of expec-
tation. The primary focus in perceiving is on what is 
present and not on what one is also aware of as corn-
ing. If the latter does become the foca! awareness, it 
does so through a separate act of expectation that pro-
ceeds simultaneously with the act ofperception. To use 
the example above, when the awaited vehicle is heard, 
there are anticipations of a continuing sound that wiii 
become increasingly louder. While that hearing and 
anticipating continue, there can arise at a certain point 
a separate act of expectation in which there is an imag-
ing of the (sti II actuaiiy out of sight) vehicle corn ing 
toward one. 
Types of experiences other than sensory perceptions 
may also include anticipations as non-independent 
parts. Recoiiecting clearly does in its striving phases. 
Forms ofthinking such as inferring and efforts to un-
derstand also do, as do aii forms of goal-oriented think-
ing. Whether aii types of experiences are so attended 
by anticipations is a topic for further phenomenologi-
cal work. Only perceptual anticipation wiii be dealt 
with in the foiiowing discussion of anticipation. 
Perceptual anticipations are automaticaiiy aroused 
and do not depend on any ego activity for their initi-
ation. Because of this, they form part of what Husserl 
caiis "passive synthesis." The term "synthesis" refers 
to the coming together of what is expected as ex-
pected with what actuaiiy becomes present. For ex-
ample, when someone turns on the water faucet he or 
she passively expects to see and hear water coming 
out. We expect this whether or not we are paying at-
tention to what we are doing. Ifwater is perceived then 
the anticipation is "fulfiiied" and experience proceeds 
concordantly. If no water is perceived, then instead of 
a "synthesis of fulfiiiment" there is a "synthesis of dis-
appointment" in this case giving rise to the experience 
of surprise. 
For Husserl, these passive syntheses and the antic-
ipations that are part of them play a decisive role in 
experience. They function in a wide variety of ways 
to yield the sense ofvalidity ofwhat is experienced as 

EXPECTATION 
215 
well as functioning in the constitution of the MEANING 
of objects and WORLD. We will return to this topic. 
(2) Protention is the second kind ofawaiting that has 
played a significant role in phenomenological theory, 
chiefly through the influence of Husserl's writings on 
TIME consciousness. Although Husserl seems to have 
used the term "protention" to refer to what was just dis-
cussed as perceptual anticipation, after a certain change 
in his thinking about timeconsciousness, indicated in 
the tenth volume of the Husserliana, he carne to use 
the term more often to denote a kind of expectation that 
is more basic than anticipation and that, he believed, 
is necessarily involved in any mental process whatso-
ever. This "protention" is a non-independent part of an 
"absolute consciousness" through which we are aware 
not ofthe corn ing aspects ofwhat we are experiencing, 
but of our experiencings themselves. As expectation 
of the about-to-be lived phases of the flow of mental 
life, protention functions along with retention (con-
sciousness of the just past phases of mental life) and 
impression (awareness of the very present phase) as 
the basic awareness of our experiencings, constituting 
them as individuated temporal unities, i.e., as temporal 
processes that begin, endure, and end. 
Awaiting in the form ofprotention may be the "orig-
inal" form of consciousness of the future. What this 
means is that the sense "fu ture" that characterizes what 
is expected in acts of expectation or in other forms of 
future consciousness, such as the acts of envisioning 
a future in planning, does not originate in these forms 
of consciousness, but derives from a reference to pro-
tentional awaiting. At any rate, this would probably be 
Husserl 's view, although he did not explicitly say so. 
A comparison of protention with retention will help 
explain this originality. 
Protention is awareness ofphases ofmentallife that 
are just about to be experienced. Along with retention 
and an "impressional" consciousness, protention helps 
form awareness of the "living present," i.e., of what 
is experienced right now (impressionally) along with 
what was just experienced (retained) and what is just 
about tobe experienced (protended). The living present 
is perhaps most easily grasped reflectively in the case 
of awareness of something changing. Husserl uses the 
example of hearing MUSIC or, to be more accurate, of 
consciousness of the temporally flowing and chang-
ing auditory sensations that are involved in hearing 
a melody. During the awareness of the sensations in-
volved in hearing the third note and while being aware 
of them as precisely "now" through an impressional 
consciousness, one is sti li aware ofhaving experienced 
the sensations relating to hearing the second and first 
notes through retention, and expects to hear the sensa-
tions involved in hearing the fourth and fifth through 
protention. In this way, the sensory fields of mental 
life are experienced as temporal spreads and the expe-
riences of which they form a part are experienced as 
processes. 
According to Husserl, retention is original con-
sciousness of the past. What this seems to mean is 
that it is perception of the passing of a content, of the 
transition of the content from the present into the just 
past to the just just past, etc. The originality of this is 
that it is awareness of this passing itself, and as such 
provides a reference that gives meaning to other modes 
of awareness of something as past. Thus recollection, 
which is an act of consciousness in which a content 
is brought back into the present through a kind of re-
production of the past experiencing of it, is able to be 
aware ofthe content as a "past" content only in virtue 
of an implicit reference to a perceived passing of that 
content. Retention is the perception. of this passing. 
In other words, something experienced as a remem-
bered past has that sense of past not so much because 
it is experienced as once having been experienced as 
present, but because it is experienced as once having 
been perceived as passing. 
The originality of protention is perhaps analogous 
to this. Husserl occasionally refers to protention as a 
perceptual consciousness. His analyses of protention 
are scarce, however, unlike retention, to which he de-
voted many analyses. Although he does not say this, 
cal ling protention "perception," if this is to be analo-
gous to retention, perhaps means that protention is the 
consciousness of something's corn ing into the present, 
so that when one is aware ofsomething as future in any 
other form offuture consciousness, that sense offuture 
refers not so much to the item being present in some 
future, but to it as something that will be experienced 
as coming into the present. 
The concept of originality here is an epistemic con-
cept that contrasts with Heidegger's concept of "au-
thenticity." For Heidegger, a form of the expectation 
of death is an authentic awareness ofthe future. How-

216 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ever, this concept of authenticity is not an epistemic 
concept, but rather has normative import. Thus the 
views of Husserl and Heidegger are not contradictory. 
What objects are in our experience ofthem has been 
thought to be a function of expectation. Husserl has 
promulgated the theory that the meaning objects have 
for us is the product of sensory data being given mean-
ing through nonsensory "noetic" mental functions. He 
has supplemented this structural account of meaning-
giving with analyses of the dynamics of experience, 
especially the role that expectational awareness ofun-
sensed parts of objects ( or events or environments-
"objects" is used here to cover ali of these) has in de-
termin ing what an object is experienced to be. When 
an object is experienced, what it is experienced to be, 
from the most generic to the most specific character-
istics, is related to what anticipations will arise in the 
ongoing experience in which different aspects of the 
object will attain sensory givenness. Ifthese anticipa-
tions are fulfilled in certain basic ways, the object will 
continue tobe experienced as a real object (as opposed 
to an illusion). Other types of fulfillments will sustain 
attributions of generic and specific features of objects. 
Ifthe anticipations are disappointed, then the aspect of 
whatness to which they relate will be "canceled" and 
replaced by a new meaning. In this way, attributions as 
basic as the sense of the world's reality arise and are 
sustained in ongoing experience. 
One issue that arises here concerns the nature of 
the relation that such anticipations have to the sense-
givings through which characteristics are attributed. Is 
meaning given by an operation that is different from 
anticipation, so that the anticipatory content derives 
from this meaning? Or are meaning-giving and antici-
pating one and the same process? Husserl's account is 
ambiguous with respect to this point. In some places he 
writes as if anticipations are based on other modes of 
consciousness ofthe anticipated content. In particular, 
he has identified a mode of consciousness called "co-
presentation" (Mitgegenwărtigung) through which we 
are aware of unsensed aspects of objects as present in 
their respective contexts. For instance, when one per-
ceives a table from the top or the side, its unseen un-
derside, having whatever characteristics it is attributed 
to have in a given perception, is also there for one as 
part ofthe table through "co-presentation." Should one 
begin to move appropriately, then expectations would 
ari se making o ne aware of the underside as "about to 
be seen." Here anticipation derives its content from the 
underlying forms of awareness within which sense-
bestowal has already been achieved. In other places, 
however, Husserl writes as if meaning-bestowal is an-
ticipation. 
This ambiguity relates to two aspects of Husserl 's 
analysis ofworld-experience that he may not ha ve suc-
ceeded in bringing together. On the one hand, antici-
pation is discussed in epistemic terms, as a form of 
"empty intention." In these contexts talk of anticipa-
tion and its "fulfillment" predominate and do so in a 
way much like his discussions of"asserting" as empty 
intention and "verifying" as fulfillment through per-
ception or some other kind of intuition. Here Husserl 
is concerned to describe the cognitive dimension of ex-
perience and to analyze how our basic sensory knowl-
edge ofthe world is motivated and sustained so that its 
status as reality is upheld. Within this cognitive orien-
tation Husserl writes of the world's "being on hand" 
( Vorhandenheit) as correlative to a fundamental doxic 
consciousness (a belief) that forms the core ofthe "nat-
ural attitude." There is a tendency in these contexts to 
assimilate the process of meaning-bestowal with the 
process of anticipation in such a way that the mean-
ings bestowed seem to take on the ro le of "rules" for 
harmonious experience. For example, the sense "chair" 
with which some piece of furniture appears to some-
one would bea rule specifying what the further course 
of experiences of the object "ali round" would need 
to be like in order that the abject be continued to be 
experienced as a chair (as opposed to having that sense 
nullified and replaced by another). The sense "chair," 
then, as such a rule, would in a way be the anticipation 
of these further experiences. 
On the other hand, Husserl sometimes discusses 
perceptual anticipation as connected with someone 's 
awareness of their movement ( or being at rest), or, 
more accurately, with their kinaestheses, i.e., their con-
sciousness of effecting movement and of being able 
to do so. Anticipations of what one will perceive are 
aroused when one is aware of moving one's BODY. 
Yet our practica! engagement in the world through our 
motility, although not neglected, seems to play a sec-
ondary role as one way in which further experience 
can be generated (the other being motion on the part 
of the object). The ro le is secondary because Husserl 

EXPECTATION 
217 
tends to see bodily movement as the transportation of 
a perceiving mind that is somewhat disengaged from 
the world and that is primarily responsible for sense-
bestowal. Thus the more anticipation is connected with 
motility, the less it plays a ro le in sense-bestowal. 
For different reasons, some phenomenologists who 
carne after Husserl developed accounts of world-
perception that embedded perceiving within the con-
text of human action or human motility. ACTION, in the 
case of JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, and motility, in the case of 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, are not seen as means to gain 
knowledge of the world but as the basic INTENTIONAL-
ITY that subsumes perceptual awareness. This inten-
tionality displaces Husserl's more mentalistic sense-
bestowal account and includes fu ture consciousness in 
action as achieving the projection ofthe ends of action. 
(ALFRED SCHUTZ, by contrast, emphasizes a more cog-
itative projecting or planning of actions.) In these ac-
counts expectation, including perceptual anticipation, 
more clearly plays a major role in the giving ofmean-
ing to the world, but in ways different from Husserl's 
theory. 
Sartre's analysis of perceptual experience situates 
that experience within projects of action and are rel-
evant for his ETHICS. Ends of action are anticipated 
future states the projection of which gives instrumen-
tal meaning to the content of the present experience. 
Sartre seems to ha ve wanted to claim that ali perceptual 
meaning is constituted in this way. Similar views are 
held by some theories of verbal meaning in LANGUAGE. 
Some "reader response" theories of READING and text 
interpretation place a large ro le on anticipation in the 
process of understanding verbal signs. Anticipations 
about how a sentence will be completed play a sig-
nificant role in determining the meaning of the sign 
presently experienced as well as its grammatical form. 
In Sartre 's theory, distinctions among various forms 
of fu ture consciousness of the kind that Husserl made 
are of less importance than the common characteristic 
of projecting a temporal end demarcating a span of 
subjective time that is also an end or purpose of de-
liberate movement, i.e., action. Thus it is difficult to 
te li what specific ro le, if any, anticipation as discussed 
here has in experience for him. What is clear, however, 
is that the coming of the end is not seen in relation 
to eventual fulfillment of belief but in relation to re-
alization of a previously nonexistent state of affairs. 
Looking under the table accomplishes setting oneself 
in a new vantage point rather than confirming a belief 
about the composition of the underside. It is a mat-
ter of transforming how the world presents itself, not 
ofknowing it. In contrast with this, Husserl's analysis 
seems, in Merleau-Ponty's terms, to be "intellectual-
ist," a designation that signifies that it is derivative and 
not basic. 
The contrasts discussed above, both within 
Husserl 's theory and between it and those of others, 
provide a number of sites for further investigation. How 
are anticipation and meaning-giving related? Are an-
ticipation and projection of ends of action the same 
or different? To what extent is the latter involved 
in meaning-giving? How exactly are protention and 
anticipation related? Does protention have a role in 
meaning-giving? This sample of questions opens up a 
mine of possible investigations into the ro le of fu ture 
consciousness in experience, an area of research that 
has been mostly neglected by Westem philosophers 
throughout the centuries due to an overemphasis on 
MEMORY in theories of experience and knowledge.

FEMINISM 
Feminism is a theoretical problem-
atics and a socio-political movement; its activist labei 
is the women 's movement. Both movement and theory 
are plural and diverse. The beginnings of phenomen-
ology coincided with the advancing first wave of the 
movement in GERMANY at the end of the 19th century, 
and the second wave began about 1960 and continues 
today. The origins and impacts ofthe two waves have 
varied with the location. In the UNITED STATES, for ex-
ample, the movement for the abolition of slavery led 
slowly to the women 's suffrage movement. In Ger-
many, however, unification in 1871 led to equal recog-
nition ofwomen based specifically on women's actual 
contribution to the "New Germany," i.e., through con-
tributing new citizens. The first wave sought women 's 
suffrage, property rights, and education. The second 
wave is about those aims as well as diversity and iden-
tities, individual and society. It began in the United 
States among various freedom movements, the Civil 
Rights movement, and the an ti-Vietnamese War move-
ment, which provided occasions for women to rec-
ognize their oppression. The severa! anti-colonialism 
movements and student protests in Europe created par-
allel situations for women to recognize the need for 
betterment in their lives. 
It is interesting that EDMUND HUSSERL 's appointment 
to the university at Gottingen in 1901 carne about 
twenty-five years after the first women, the Russians 
Sophia Kovelevsky (1850-1891) and Julia Lermon-
tova (1846-1919), received degrees in mathematics 
and chemistry respectively (termed "honorary" since 
women could not legally attend the university). It was 
also in 1901 that the first German universities admit-
ted women on a par with men and that Helene Stăcker 
( 1869-1943) became the first woman to recei ve a doc-
torale in philosophy ata German university (Berlin); in 
1909 she founded a major branch of German feminism, 
the Mutterschutz movement. The arrivals at Gottingen 
of HEDWIG CONRAD-MARTIUS in 1911 and of EDITH STEIN 
in 1913 to study with Husserl would have been note-
worthy rather than commonplace occurrences. Univer-
sity women were aware of the continuing women's 
movement; for example, Edith Stein as a studentjoined 
the Prussian Association for Women 's Suffrage. The 
American feminist Katharine Anthony notes in 1915 
the existence of eleven feminist magazines in Ger-
many; many books were also available, including two 
popular works, Hedwig Dohm's Die Anti-Feministen 
(The anti-feminists, 1908), which berated Nietzsche 
for his misogyny, and Kăthe Schirmacher's Das Rătsel: 
Weib (fhe riddle: woman, 1911 ), which borrowed its 
aphoristic style from Nietzsche in order to attack his 
sexism. 
The issue of education for women was a concrete 
lived experience at the German universities where 
phenomenology had its origins, but it was not the only 
topic regarding women's lives that was alive in Ger-
many at that time. The women 's movement cut across 
ali politica! camps, from socialist to centrist to con-
servative, although with differing agendas. Almost ali 
of these groups extolled women 's traditional ro les of 
mother and wife. But they also urged full admission 
of women to professional and other paid labor and 
demanded state recognition of the value of work in 
the home, improved quality of education, and politi-
ca! participation. MAX SCHELER expressed his support 
for these feminist aims in "Zum Sinn der Frauenbe-
wegung" (1913). In "Zur Idee des Menschen" (1915) 
he criticized the supposed gender-neutrality of"man," 
much as second-wave feminists attacked the generic 
use of"he" in English. 
When Germans faced the extreme social upheavals 
in the post-war era, beginning with the founding ofthe 
Weimar Republic in 1918, women were granted the 
vote, but were also under censure for their possible fail-
ure as the "more moral" sex to maintain the moral core 
of German society. It is small wonder, then, that when 
Husserl in §55 of Die Krisis der europdischen Wis-
senschafien und die transzendentale Phănomenologie 
( 1936) rai sed the specific issues that a phenomenology 
of INTERSUBJECTIVITY and of sociaJity wouJd need to 
discuss, he mentioned the "problem ofthe sexes." 
In 1920 Edith Stein obtained the landmark legal 
ruling that women could not be prevented from habil-
itating due to their sex. From 1922 to 1932 she taught 
in a Dominican gir1s' school, after her habilitation was

rejected by the Gottingen philosophy faculty. Her back-
ground in phenomenology, the continued debate over 
women's place in the Weimar Republic, and her con-
version to Catholicism in 1922 flowed into her interest 
in the education ofwomen. She gave many talks to or-
ganizations such as the Congress of Catholic German 
Graduates, presenting a Catholic feminist position that 
parallels some of today's second wave cultural femi-
nists' pride in women 's caring and holistic attitudes. 
In essays between 1928 and 1932, published posthu-
mously as Die Frau. lhre Aufgabe nach Natur und 
Gnade (Essays on women, 1959), she articulates a the-
ory of sexual difference in nature and psychology, nei-
ther reducible to biology, that grants intrinsic value to 
the feminine. Her articulation ofthe "feminine" quali-
ties of an interest in the personal and a tendency toward 
wholeness, contrasted with "masculine" interes! in the 
abstract and objective, is echoed by !ater gynocentric 
feminists. But Stein recognizes the traps ofboth hyper-
femininity and hypermasculinity, any one-sidedness of 
gender, and indicates that wholeness ofthe person re-
quires some am o unt of ali attributes ~an anticipation 
of feminist androgyny theories. Her ca11 for women to 
aid in healing a world facing totalitarianism and ma-
terialism reminds one oflater feminist peace theorists. 
Much of her religious discussions, such as her scrip-
tural justification of woman 's subordination, would be 
rejected by feminists now, but her reading of Genesis 
affirms that women and men were equally assigned 
life's tasks, including ruling the earth ~ 
on the whole 
a feminist theological reading. 
Other female students of Husserl and contempo-
rary phenomenologists, such as Stein 's friends HEDWIG 
CONRAD-MARTIUS and GERDA WALTHER, were feminists 
who lived their activism by becoming philosophers. 
Conrad-Martius, having won her doctorale at Munich 
in 1912, continued her research as an independent 
scholar, supported by her husband. Walther's 1921 dis-
sertation questions the liberalist notion of autonomous 
individuality, much as !ater feminist politica! theorists 
do, and claims that humans are by nature social be-
ings, anticipating 1980s feminist readings ofwomen 's 
connectedness, such as Carol Gi11igan's work. HANNAH 
ARENDT studied with Heidegger, Husserl, and Jaspers, 
completing her doctoral study in 1928 with Jaspers. In 
1933 she reviewed the feminist work of Alice Ruele-
Gerstel, Das Frauenproblem der Gegenwart (Contem-
porary women 's issues, 1933), insi sting on the need for 
class and family analysis in order to combat sexism. 
With these women having their formations before the 
Nazi period, and SUZANNE BACHELARD, SIMONE DE BEAU-
VOIR, and ELISABETH STROKER having theirs before the 
end of the first wave, phenomenology was attractive 
and appears to ha ve been somewhat more receptive to 
women than other intellectual movements before the 
1960s. 
This point becomes clearer as we find other early 
contributors to phenomenoJogy. KATHARINA HEUFELDER 
completed a doctorale in architecture in 1928 at Berlin, 
returning to habilitate in philosophy in 1950; a student 
of Heidegger, she wrote major works on Scheler, Hei-
degger, and Hartmann during her university career at 
Berlin and Marburg. GERMAINE BREE, with a 1931 doc-
torale from the Sorbonne wrote on JEAN-PAUL SARTRE 
and ALBERT CAMUS. ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA studied 
with ROMAN INGARDEN in Poland, earning a doctorale in 
1952 at Fribourg, Switzerland. MARJORIE GRENE studied 
with Heidegger and Jaspers and wrote the first English 
introduction to Heidegger. And the literature shows us 
others: HILDA OAKLEY published in 1931 on Hartmann,

movement fo11owed diminished feminist activity in 
the 1940s and 1950s. Women went from accepting 
the roles, personalities, and politica! positions a11owed 
them by a society now ca11ed patriarchal (rule by the 
"pater" or ma les) to taking the experiences of women 
and their own articulation of them seriously. The val-
idation of women 's experience was crucial to recog-
nizing the extent to which women had been social-
ized into accepting a variety of subordinate positions. 
Women increasingly demanded tobe heard rather than 
being interpreted by others, particularly by those in a 
privileged position, whether due to gender, class, race, 
or other reason. The ca11 on experience has thus func-
tioned throughout the first decades ofthe second wave 
as a constant reminder ofthe ways in which those who 
ha ve and assume power, even with good will, can deny 
expression to the experience of those who lack si mi-

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Iar power or place in society and its organizations and 
institutions. 
Phenomenology would seem an excellent approach 
for reclaimingexperience. Its method begins with the 
reflective turn toward the subject's experiences and 
asks that these be seen in as unbiased a manner as pos-
sible, weeding out unexamined assumptions of every-
day life. Feminists might criticize the seeming "view 
from above" that Husserl's method requires, particu-
larly the transcendental EPOCilE AND REDUCTION from 
the everyday "natural" attitude, a criticism that would 
parallel the feminist attacks on malist or masculin-
ist theory with its extreme decontextualization. But 
this epoche might also be seen as compatible with 
feminist goals of breaking from an unreflective en-
grossment in a patriarchal attitude, as well as naive 
claims of being race-, gender-, and class-neutral. Al-
though in ldeen zu einer reinen Phiinomenologie und 
phiinomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913) Husserl 
framed the "natural attitude" in terms ofthe basic per-
ceptual situation of ourselves in relation to a world of 
objects, in ldeen Il [ 1912-15] he expanded the natural 
attitude to include other historically sedimented mean-
ings that color the things and persons around us. Hen ce 
the activity oftranscendental epoche seems to identify 
meanings that might adversely influence our pursuit 
of knowledge. A phenomenologist who is a feminist 
could thus take more seriously the potential impact of 
her or his sex and gender, and possibly also ofhis or her 
age, class, race or ethnic position, sexual orientation, 
and abilities/disabilities. 
The Krisis text is also helpful here, especially for 
those critics who question the possibility of such an 
epoche, since the accomplishment of epoche is seen 
as an intention moving toward an ideal goal and does 
not negate the value of any partial work accomplished 
thus far. That Husserl himselfwas not fully aware ofthe 
potential bias from socio-cultural and personal factors 
does not, in itself, invalidate ali of his findings. The 
question of the degree to which his methodology and 
results might be labeled masculinist is still an open 
question. 
Much recent feminist epistemology and philosophy 
of science echo themes found in Husserl's investiga-
tion of modern Western NATURAL SCIENCE. His critique 
ofthe NATURALISM stemming from the natural sciences 
has important elements in common with some feminist 
criticisms of these sciences' supposed objectivity and 
value-neutrality. Although few feminist philosophies 
of sciences hold with Husserl that the "natural world" 
of modern Western natural science is actually an inter-
subjectively constituted product, severa! seek alterna-
tive renderings of"science" that parallel his attempt to 
tocate a meaning for "science" that is not bound to the 
intellectualization of the "objective" natural sciences. 
His analyses of the mathematization of the universe 
and its natural causality, both limiting intellectualized 
products, and the manner in which they flow back into 
our lifeworld contribute to comprehending the social 
construction of reality postulated by many theorists. 
Husserl 's notions of passive and intersubjective con-
stitution investigated in GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY and 
GENERATIVE PHENOMENOLOGY would broaden the under-
standing of the hold of such outcomes on our everyday 
human lives. 
When the second wave of the women 's movement 
began to foster theorizing, it was asked how can we 
describe and understand the position of women in so-
ciety today? And how can we account for the historical 
absence ofwomen? Philosophers trained in social and 
politica! philosophy and the history ofphilosophy were 
among the first to respond to these questions. In their 
initial attempts to comprehend women 's position in 
patriarchy, feminist philosophers uncovered accounts 
ofwomen's "natural" inferiority, accounts that usually 
traced the inferiority to a "womanly essence." The first 
attacks on Western accounts of women were thus ar-
guments against the very notion of essence. Leading 
this second wave critique of Western cultural expec-
tations for women is SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR's work of 
EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY, Le deuxieme sexe (The 
second sex, 1949). Beauvoir's status as an independent 
philosopher, however, had to be reclaimed following 
her death; this task was first seriously undertaken by 
Margaret Simons. 
Essentialism thus became, in the early 1970s, an 
ugly word for feminists who were philosophers. Al-
though feminist phenomenologists understood these 
first attacks on essentialism to deal with metaphysically 
theorized essences and not with any "essence" what-
ever, and thus not phenomenology's EIDETIC METHOD, 
the clima te in feminist circ les often led them not to labei 
their work phenomenological. This difficulty pertained 
more directly for transcendental phenomenology, since 

FEMINISM 
221 
Husserl's method had already faced strong criticism 
stil! marginalized in Western culture and, along with 
from other phenomenologists, such as Sartre. Some 
MARY CATHERINE BASEHEART and Theresa Wobbe, she 
feminists who worked in existential phenomenology 
revives the intricacies of Stein 's rich ve in of REALISTIC 
and other descriptive phenomenologies-e.g., ALFRED 
SCHUTZ's CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE NATURAL 
ATTITUDE- could more readily use their methodology. 
In the 1980s the growing influence of French POST-
MODERN writers created a chillier climate for any 
talk of essences within feminist theorizing, including 
even feminism-informed descriptions of "woman" or 
"women." Thinkers such as Luce Irigaray, Monique 
Wittig, and Julia Kristeva filled a thirst for theory in 
the Anglo-American academy, as their work seemed to 
continue earlier anti-essentialist attacks, particularly on 
modern philosophers, and to echo the growing social 
constructivist bent of feminist social scientists. 
Curiously, however, by the 1990s some problem-
atic elements of postmodernism- e.g., its hegemonic 
assertion of discursive determinism and the death of 
the subject -
moved the field of feminist theorizing 
toward an uneasy pluralism. Feminist women of color 
in North America and across the world had appre-
ciated the earlier attacks on essentialism, since they 
ca !led for a multiplicity of women 's experiences to be 
heard when determining socio-political changes, but 
they insisted that the discourse theories coming from 
postmodernism robbed them of their voice. Women 's 
articulation ofwomen 's experience had been a rallying 
cry of the second wave, then it carne under attack by 
some feminists; however, forothers a return to these ex-
periences became a promising alternative in the 1990s 
to the theorized woman some postmodernists seemed 
to speak of. Feminists could rediscover previously dis-
credited theories and methodologies and reclaim spe-
cific elements that avoid reducing feminist theory to 
biography or conversations- a politically and intel-
lectually bankrupt position in the eyes ofmany. 
This shift to pluralism in feminist circles in the 
1990s opened a space for feminists with phenomen-
ological training to place work in the public domain 
that received broad acceptance; others can engage in 
the multiple feminisms incorporated under the broad 
title phenomenology. As in other disciplines and in phi-
losophy more generally, our "lost" foremothers are be-
ing recovered: LINDA LOPEZ MCALISTER teJis US ofGerda

mystical, abnormal, and parapsychological phenomena

Topically, new feminist works include descriptions 
and reevaluations of experiences and concerns specific 
to women, culturally or otherwise, such as menstrua-
tion, childbearing, and menopause. One of the earli-
est published phenomenological analyses in American 
feminism is found in IRIS MAR ION YOUNG's 1980 account 
of women 's experience of pregnancy, a breakthrough 
in American philosophy just in its mention of such 
a "womanly" thing. She draws on MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY's existential phenomenology of the Iived BODY 
and Beauvoir's descriptions of women 's traditional 
roles. SANDRA LEE BARTKY's phenomenologyoffeminist 
consciousness analyzes the changes to consciousness 
and the correlative "social reality" that one experiences 
in becoming a feminist. 
Feminists have examined phenomenologists in or-
der to see whether their approaches might serve the 
current needs of feminists and women, asking if those 
phenomenologists were misogynist in person or in phi-
losophy. LJNDA BELL expands core elements of ETHICS 
IN SARTRE that caii for authenticity as a way to resolve 
problems presented by feminist theory and practice. Ju-
dith Butler criticizes Merleau-Ponty's claim that sexu-
ality is coextensive with existence, finding behind that 
stance an unreflective assumption ofthe "normality" of 
heterosexuality. Margery Collins and Christine Pierce 
investigate Sartre 's supposed anti-essentialism, only to 
find that his writings are sexist, because they place the 
rule of essences in the hands of the male, who defines 
them according to his will. HAZEL BARNES also queries 
Sartre's sexism. 
LINDA FISHER, the CO-organizer with LESTER EMBREE 
of the first conference on feminist phenomenology, 
is formulating the potential for using transcendental 
phenomenology, even with its malist attributes, in ex-
ploring gender. ANN JOHNSON opens the possibility of a 
feminist phenomenological PSYCHOLOGY in her study of 
the emergence of gender-typed behaviors in children. 
LOUISE LEVESQUE-LOPMAN is formuJating a phenomen-
oJogicaJ soCIOLOGY, drawing primarily from Alfred 
Schutz, in order to investigate women 's descriptions 
of social reality and gender consciousness. Maryellen

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Y GASSET's views concerning an essential inwardness 
of women that renders them essentially confused and 
thus inferior to men; she raises similar difficulties with 
Julia Marias's notion of sexuate condition and FRED-
ERIK J. J. BUYTENDI.IK's account ofwomen's experience, 
which is a]so criticized by MARINA PAOLA BANCHETTI for 
its methodological inadroitness. 
Other feminist writings develop new methods that 
draw on the "classical" phenomenologies. LINDA AL-
COFF gives us a concept of subject as positionality, in 
which a choice of identity is opened up because iden-
tity stems from the "externa!" situation, hence from 
constantly shifting contexts within which the subject 
lives. JEFFNER ALLEN offers the notion of "sinuosity" 
as a lesbian-inspired consciousness of the lived body. 
REGULA GIULIANI-TAGMANN is a]so working on gender 
studies from a phenomenological point of view, prin-
cipally inspired by Merleau-Ponty. MARiA LUGONES as-
says the multiple consciousnesses of persons living 
within and between different Ianguages and cultures, 
and from their position creates and expresses a tech-
nique, called "curdling," that is creative and resistant. 
JULIEN MURPHY considers Sartre's analysis of the ob-
jectifying Iook and rejects it as expressing only this 
male's idea ofthe look; she looks to Adrienne Rich to 
claim an alternative activity ofthe eye, i.e., feminist vi-
sion. MARILYN NISSIM-SABAT has brought the feminist cri-
tique of science and the phenomenological understand-
ing of meaning-formation to bear on the deficiencies 
of PSYCHOANALYSIS. MAXINE SHEETS-JOHNSTONE investi-
gates the corporeal ground for fundamental concepts, 
including those that underlie patriarchal attitudes, e.g., 
the connection ofmale agency and penile erection with 
the creation ofbinary oppositional thinking used in pa-
triarchal thought. GAYLYN STUDLAR applies phenomen-
ological insight to a feminist FILM theory. 
In one ofthe first talks on feminism at the American 
Philosophical Association, Alison Jaggar described 
three feminist stances -
liberal, classical Marxist, 
and radical. When the talk was published in 1976, 
the taxonomy has been expanded to include lesbian-
separatist and socialist feminisms. This categorization 
still frames the debate about the conceptual core of 
feminism, with the addition of postmodernism. Pheno-
menology seemed to ha ve no place in that world offem-
inisms. In 1995, however, it was numbered along with 
eight other feminisms in the collection of "essential 
readings" in second wave feminist philosophy edited 
by Nancy Tuana and Rosemarie Jong. There are also al-
ternative models for categorizing feminisms, e.g., with 
an eye on the historical contexts as found in the work 
ofTINA CHANTER, Eva Cole, and writers in the 1994 Hy-
patia symposium. One of the major enduring features 
of second wave feminism is its critique of patriarchal 
binary oppositions, e.g., male and female, cognition 
and emotion. Many classifications of feminisms have 
focused on either equality (females are like males) or 
difference (females are not Iike males), or alternatively 
on celebrating females (gynocentric feminism) versus 
nating their oppression (victim feminism). Such binary 
techniques skirt this critique and overlook the realities 
expressed by these variations on strategy, theory, and 
description. 
A model with a different central category is Kathy 
Ferguson's new taxonomy built around attitudes to-
ward subjectivity: praxis feminisms emphasize inter-
subjective life; cosmic feminisms emphasize self as 
related to a larger reality (ecologica! feminism, for ex-
ample); and Iinguistic feminisms emphasize the speak-
ing subject. In tracing the wide varieties of feminisms 
and shifting to a metatheoretical stance called mobile 
subjectivity, Ferguson gives an alternative to a total-
izing stance, a strategy for pursuing theory and Iiving 
multiplicity. Similar strategies would include reassess-
ing any categories of thought and theory and open-
ing up the intellectual field within feminism to a self-
understanding of its history. In its many guises, pheno-
menology as the study of consciousness as it relates 
within itself and beyond itself to other subjectivities 
and intersubjective realities, including nature however 
we grasp it, can provide strategies for going forward 
with such feminist work. For example, Edith Stein has 
a notion of individuation that is far di fferent from that 
ofthe abstractive concept of individual in modern po-
litica! theory, which is the concept that is interpreted 
by feminist critiques ofthe malist bias ofthe Cartesian 
self. And her notion of essence as both fixated and ftex-
ible, i.e., changeable in its individuations because it is 
historically and socially situated, might give feminists 
an approach to breaking the anti-essentialism debate 
and to conceptualizing the commonalities of women 
that postmodernism has Ieft behind in the de bate. There 
are many such possibilities for bringing feminism and 
phenomenology together.

Most 
phenomenologists have considered subjective ideal-
ism with the transcendental EGO as the principle of 
ultimate grounding (Letztbegriindung) to be an unten-
able philosophical system. This rejection ofthe philo-
sophical principles of KANT and the neo-Kantians im-
plies a fortiori a complete disinterest in Fichte's phi-
losophy and its principle, the absolute ego. MARTIN 

224 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
HEIDEGGER was interested in the philosophy of Be-
ing and existence of the !ater SCHELLING, who aban-
doned Fichte's speculative subjective idealism as well 
as the speculative objective idealism of HEGEL. The 
only exception is EDMUND HUSSERL and his transcenden-
tal phenomenology. Husserl was interested in compar-
isons of different types of transcendental philosophy. 
His goal was to determine the analogies and differences 
of the transcendental-logica! and the transcendental-
phenomenological approach. Fichte was of signifi-
cance for the development of the thought of the !ater 
neo-Kantians. Husserl's considerations of the princi-
ples of Fichte's system are thus immediately embed-
ded in his critica! discussions of ne o-Kantian doctrines. 
There are in addition other reasons for his interest in 
Fichte. He studied Fichte's moral philosophy two years 
after the publication of the Logische Untersuchungen 
(1900-190 1 ). The interest in Fichte's moral philosophy 
between 1903 and 1918 is connected with Husserl 's 
general tendency to emphasize the practica! signifi-
cance ofphilosophy as a rigorous science. 
Husserl offered his first seminar on Fichte's Bes-
timmung des Menschen (1800) in 1903. He offered it 
again in 1915 and 1918. The urge to find guidance in 
the search for a general moral renewal in Germany in 
the last years of World War I was an additional moti-
vating force behind his three lectures on Fichte's ideal 
ofhumanity in 1918. Neo-Kantians like Paul Natorp 
( 1854-1924) discussed similar problems. Husserl stud-
ied Natorp's essay Deutscher Weltberuf (The German 
task in the world, 1918) and wrote a letter to him re-
ftecting the similarities and the difference between his 
own position and Natorp's essay. 
Fichte, according to Husserl, is a prophet of moral 
enthusiasm who developed an ethical and theological 
worldview philosophy, i.e., a philosophy that cannot 
claim to be a rigorous or strict science. This judg-
ment presupposes a rejection ofFichte's philosophical 
system as a whole. Fichte's theoretical philosophy, as 
Husserl states, is a forced and untenable construction. 
There are therefore no references to Fichte in his !ater 
attempts to prove the moral force of transcendental 
phenomenology as a philosophy of self-responsibility 
(Selbstverantwortung). 
The reasons for Husserl 's harsh rejection ofFichte 's 
theoretical philosophy and his system in general cannot 
be found in extended discussions of Fichte 's philoso-
phy. Husserl never studied Fichte 's Wissenschaftslehre 
(1794) in depth. It is possible that he read Fichte's 
introductions to his system of 1797. There are, how-
ever, relevant arguments developed in his critica! re-
marks on Jonas Cohn 's Voraussetzungen und Ziele der 
Erkenntnis (Presuppositions and goals of knowledge, 
1908). Fichte and his method is essential for Cohn 's 
approach. In Husserl's !ater manuscripts we also find 
critica! remarks about the kind of deduction of cate-
gories introduced by Fichte. This version of a tran-
scendental deduction is predominant in the tradition 
of German idealism. In his 1etter to Cohn, Husserl re-
jects ali deductions beginning with a highest princip1e 
in general without mentioning the possible differences 
between, e.g., Cartesian deductions and Fichte's de-
ductions moving through the triad of thesis, antithesis 
and synthesis. This difference is not of significance 
for Husserl. Like science in general, phenomeno1ogy 
-
i.e., philosophy as a rigorous science -
has to 
start from below. Last principles can be found only 
in the end after the real work has been done. In the 
manuscripts he rejects in addition ali attempts to de-
duce a system of categories as unchanging and eter-
na! princip1es a priori of REASON. It is not possible in 
phenomenology to discover such a closed system of 
the a priori. The a priori of phenomenology is open for 
unlimited possibilities. Fichte is not mentioned in the 
letter to Cohn and in the !ater manuscripts, but they re-
vea! the reasons behind Husserl's rejection ofFichte's 
system and the idea of system guiding the tradition of 
German idealism in general. It is, according to Fichte 's 
second introduction, the task of philosophy to provide 
a deduction ofthe system of categories, and the a priori 
in general, beginning with the absolute ego as a first 
principle. Kant promised such a deduction, but he never 
proved that the system of categories and the forms of 
intuition can be deduced with necessity from the tran-
scendental ego. The presupposition of the possibility 
of such a deduction is to recognize that the transcen-
dental ego is indeed the absolute ego, or, in short, the 
Absolute. The absolute ego is not the highest princi-
ple in Hegel's system, but the task ofhis Wissenschaft 
der Logik (1812-16) is nevertheless a deduction of an 
expanded system of categories a priori. 
According to Husserl, transcendental phenomen-
ology and Fichte's subjective transcendental idealism 
and its methods are in opposition. Not very much space 

JOHANN GOTTLIEB FICHTE

for analogies remains. Attempts to compare Fichte's 
and Husserl 's idealism in the secondary litera ture ofthe 
second half of our century ha ve had to find viewpoints 
beyond Husserl's own evaluation of Fichte's philos-
ophy. Two types of such comparative interpretations 
can be distinguished. It is first possible to investigate 
certain analogies and to point out the differences in the 
analogies. The other possibility is to provide a criti-
cal reinterpretation of Husserl 's phenomenology and 
to prove that elements of speculative thinking are a 
necessary supplement of phenomenological research 
because phenomenological research by itself cannot 
reach its goal of ultimate grounding. 
Three types of analogies are considered in the lit-
erature. ( 1) The ultimate principle in Fichte 's and 
Husserl 's subjective idealism is the absolute subjectiv-
ity of the transcendental ego. (2) In Fichte's position 
and in Husserl 's phenomenology we ha ve the split be-
tween the observ ing ego ofthe philosopher and the ob-
served activities, and the genesis (in Fichte's terms) of 
the pragmatic history ofthe absolute subject. (3) There 
is a priority of self-realization and self-responsibility 
in the genesis of the absolute ego. The task of the 
philosopher is in the last instance the practical task of 
self-realization and self-responsibility. 
A closer considerati an of the first analogy reveals 
the differences. Fichte's absolute ego is a pure atempo-
ral activity, a Tathandlung constituting, i.e., creating, 
time and space and the categorica! framework in atem-
poral acts of positing and opposing. Husserl 's transcen-
dental ego is the concrete EGO with various systems 
of habits, corresponding objects, and a corresponding 
world. The structures of temporality are the medium 
and not the product of the activities of the ego. Tem-
porality is pregiven to the acts of consciousness in 
passive constitution. Bound to temporality, subjectiv-
ity is also bound to facticity, i.e., to the content pregiven 
in passive synthesis. The transcendental ego together 
with its activities, according to Husserl 's transcenden-
tal aesthetics, is itself pre-constituted in passive gen-
esis, which GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY investigates. The 
method of the observation of the reflecting philoso-
pher ofthe second analogy is different. Fichte's obser-
vation immediately presupposes a radical abstraction 
leading to the highest principles of his conception of 
the logic of reftection, identity and opposition or dif-
ference, and their mutual negation. The observations 
of the observer require an atemporal intellectual in-
tuition. Observations of intellectual intuition ha ve the 
character of speculative deductions. What is deduced 
comprises ali of the contents given to the empirical 
ego, the empirical ego itself included. In contrast, the 
phenomenological observer is bound to the facticity of 
pregiven structures of phenomenological experience. 
The temporality of inner TIME-consciousness as such 
determines the possibility of the split between the ob-
server and the observed activities and their genesis. 
There are also differences in the third analogy. Even 
to a higher degree than Kant's, Fichte's ethics is an 
ethics of the absolute "ought" of absolute freedom. 
Husserl 's ETHICS is an ethics "from below." The "ought" 
ofactions is the ought ofthe realization ofvalues and is 
embedded in the general system of an ethics ofvalues. 
The givenness of values in turn presupposes entities 
that are given in doxic intentionality, i.e., again the 
reality of facticity. There is no absolute ought as the 
final principle a priori for a deduction ofthe system of 
ethics. The development of ethical principles is teleo-
logical and open in its possibilities. 
The attempt to overcome the differences behind 
the analogies presupposes a critical reinterpretation of 
Husserl 's transcendental phenomenology. Such a rein-
terpretation can be justified with the aid ofthe passages 
in Husserl's writings in which he himself interprets 
transcendental phenomenology as absolute subjective 
idealism with an absolute subjectivity as a principle 
of absolute and ultimate grounding. It is questionable 
whether such claims are indeed implied in the results of 
a purely descriptive phenomenology. 1 fthe claims can-
not be justified descriptively, then it must be admitted 
that the phenomenological method cannot reach uiti-
roate grounding. In order to reach this goal some type of 
speculative thinking has tobe introduced. What occurs 
in Husserl 's descriptions as pregiven passivity and fac-
ticity must be understood as the re suit of the creative 
powers of an absolute subject. He indeed called the 
source of the constitution of in ner time-consciousness 
in the nu ne stans of the actual now the "absolute sub-
jectivity." It can be assumed in addition that its activity 
is also the driving force behind the passive synthesis of 
kinaesthesis. Such a step, suggested by LUDWIG LAND-
GREBE and ULRICH CLAESGES, Jeads to difficuJties. ( J) 
According to Fichte the philosopher's observation is 
an observation in intellectual intuition. Only intellec-

226 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
tual intuition is able to comprehend the timeless acts 
in which time and the matter given in time <ţre posited. 
The EIDETIC METHOD presupposes TIME, the time that is 
required in acts of reflection in general and the time 
of the free variation of the contents of transcendental 
phenomenological experience. lntellectual intuition, if 
it exists, is beyond the scope ofphenomenology. (2) ln-
tellectual intuition for itself, according to Hegel, leads 
into the mysticism of an Absolute "as the night in which 
ali cows are black." Speculative dialectic is required 
for the conceptual development of the content of the 
Absolute. Fichte does not use the term "dialectic," but 
his method with its movements from thesis and an-
tithesis to synthesis in its essence is a movement of 
speculative dialectica! thinking. 
Recent comparisons of the philosophy of Jonas 
Cohn and Husserl have shown that the concepts of 
negation and contradiction in Husserl 's formal and 
transcendental logic cannot be interpreted in terms of 
the dialectica! conception of negation and contradic-
tion. An attempt to reconcile Husserl's and Fichte's 
philosophy is therefore possible only as a deconstruc-
tion of transcendental phenomenology. It requires a cri-
tique ofphenomenology itself. And this critique would 
have to show that the phenomenological method can-
not reach the goal ofultimate grounding envisioned by 
Husserl, and it would have to reveal the hidden dialec-
tica! structures behind transcendental phenomenology 
and phenomenology in general. On the other hand, no 
critica! phenomenological investigations have deter-
mined the scope and the li mit of the EVIDENCE given 
in speculative dialectica! thinking, its methods, and its 
radical conception ofultimate grounding.

FILM 
The history ofthe conjunction ofpheno-
menology with film (and more recently television) has 
been greatly influenced by the fact that scholarly study 
ofthe medium was legitimated and slowly institution-
alized in the universities of the UNITED STATES only 
as recently as the mid-1960s and was thus not syn-
chronous with the rise of interes! in phenomenology 
as philosophy and research method in Continental Eu-
rope during the previous decades. Marginally accepted 
and housed primarily in university literature depart-
ments, film studies emerged as a discipline during 
the years in which semiotics (particularly the work of 
Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913) on the nature of 
the sign) and STRUCTURALISM (particularly the work of 
Claude Levi-Strauss on the structural study of myth) 
were popular in Europe and soon had major impacts 
on the American academy. Both not only promised the 
HUMAN SCIENCES a new method of textual and social 
description, but also appeared as rigorous methods of 
literary and cinematic analysis. Attempting to convince 
logocentric academics that the study of cinema was a 
legitimate scholarly enterprise, film scholars embraced 
semiotics and structuralism, and by the mid-1970s had 
also adopted a linguistically based PSYCHOANALYSIS and 
discursively based ideologica! analysis as more dy-
namic approaches to the psychic and social formation 
of film spectators and film texts. Initially, then, film 
studies followed such French mentors in cinesemiotics 
as Christian Metz and focused first on microanalyses 
of film "language" and narrative structures and !ater 
on linguistically based, psychoanalytical descriptions 
of cinematic identificati an and scopic desi re as well as 
on genealogies of cinematic discourse.

FILM 
Prior to the widespread institutionalization of film 
studies in the United States during the 1960s, there had 
been less formal intellectuallinks between phenomen-
ology and the cinema forged in FRANCE immediately 
following World War II and initiated by the publicati an 
in 1945 ofGilbert Cohen-Seat's Essai sur les principes 
d 'une philosophie de cinema. Cohen-Seat called for a 
filmologie, a synthetic science of the cinema whose 
task was to describe not only the logic and meaning of 
film texts, but also the existential and institutional ac-
tivity offilm-making and film-viewing. His impact was 
considerable, giving rise to a filmologie movement that 
had, unt il its decline in the 1960s, a certa in international 
popularity although it remained virtually unknown in 
the United States. First eclectic and interdisciplinary 
and then dominated by experimental psychologists, fil-
mologie could hardly be called a phenomenology ofthe 
cinema, but many works publishcd in the context ofthe 
movement were phenomenologically inflected ~par­
ticularly those that attempted to describe the nature and 
psychology of cinematic perception qualitatively. 
The movement's Revue Internationale de Filmolo-
gie ( 1947--60) published articles describing cinema's 
relation to the perceptual productions of conscious-
ness such as dreams, memories, illusions, spatial and 
temporal gestalts such as depth and movement, modes 
of identification, and the sense of the real. In 1948, 
for example, A. Michotte Van Den Berck published 
in the Revue "Le caractere de realite des projections 
cinematographiques," an essay prescient in posing, 
perhaps for the first time, the still central question 
of what has been more recently called the "reality 
effect" of the cinema. (Later, in 1953, he posed an-
other question central to contemporary film studies in 
"La participation emotionnelle du spectateur a l'action 
representee a 1 'ecran," attempting a description of the 
processes ofidentification and affect in the cinema.) In 
194 7, within the context of increasing interdisciplinary 
interest in filmologie, psychologist and EXISTENTIAL 
PHENOME~OLOGIST MAURICE MERLEAU-PO~TY pubJished, 
in Les Temps Moderne, "Le cinema et la nouvelle psy-
chologie," his only essay devoted to the medium he 
called the "phenomenological art." 
Filmologie also provided the initial context for two 
other major avenues of phenomenological investiga-
tion ~ 
the thematization, description, and interpreta-
tion of, first, the effects of this radically new mode of 
227 
representation in the culture or I.IFEWORLD of its time, 
and second, the aesthetic and primary experience of 
film art. In the first instance, phenomenological investi-
gation into the medium 's cultural effects oftcn led from 
description to cultural critique. Influenced by the EXIS-
TENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY of JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, GABRIEL 
MARCEL, and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, Edgar Morin's 
Le Cinema oul 'homme imaginaire (The cinema or the 
imaginary man, 1958) saw the cinema 's essential ambi-
guity and the basis for its fascination as emerging from 
the tension between, on the o ne hand, the medium 's 
expansive perceptual capacity to bring human being to 
reflexive consciousness of itself and to reveal to hu-
man PERCEPTION a world hitherto unseen or taken for 
granted and, on the other, the medium's objectifica-
tion of human being in alienated, reified, institution-
alized forms and phantasmagoric images. Even more 
negative was ROGER MUNIER 's Contre 1 'image (Against 
the image, 1962), a phenomenological meditation that 
regarded the cinema as a pre-logical and alienating 
medium that represented the world as autonomously 
constituted, overpowering, and essentially inhuman. 
In the second instance, phenomenological investi-
gation of the unique qualities of the aesthetic experi-
ence of cinema have led from description to a some-
times mystical and theologically inflected celebration 
ofthe medium's transcendent and transcendental qual-
ities. HENRI AGEL and AMEDEE AYFRE describe the aes-
thetic experience of film art as a way immediately to 
apprehend human being and intuit spiritual and moral 
truths derived not from theory or logic, but from the 
spectator's poetic dialogue with the human and natu-
ral world revealed by cinema. During the early years 
of filmologie, Agel asked Le cinema a-t-il une âme? 
(Does film ha ve a saul? 1952) and eventually went on to 
publish, in 1973, his Poetiquedu cinema: Manifeste es-
sentialiste. Responding in the latter to the contempora-
neous semiotic/structuralist movement and influenced 
by Gaston Bachelard ( 1994--1962) on the primordial 
and immediate nature of the poetic image, Agel cele-
brated a "cinema of contemplation" that functioned by 
analogy rather than reason to allow spectators access 
to the essential, transcendental qualities of nature and 
human existence. Ayfre, a theologian who had studied 
with Merleau-Ponty, initially focused on the medium's 
theological and ethical dimensions in Dieu au cinema 
(Gad at the cinema, 1952) and published posthumously 

228 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Conversion aux images? (Conversion to the images? 
1964) and Cinema et mystere (Cinema and mystery, 
1 969). In a culmi nating work, Le cinema et sa veri te 
(1969), Ayfre privileged the "authentic" film whose 
images, unlike those of propagandistic or pornograph-
ically commercial cinema, were able to resonate in 
our being first pre-logically and then reflectively, ulti-
mately reorganizing our perception and behavior and 
re-engaging us with our quotidian LIFEWORLD in a new 
and ethically enhanced relation of moral responsibility. 
A more widely known celebrant ofthe cinema as an in-
strument of perceptual and spiritual revelation is ANDRE 
BAZIN, who was highly influential on both si des of the 
Atlantic. A co-founder of Cahiers du cinema, Bazin 
was a French critic who wrote extensively on cinema 
during the post-war period. Although he died in 1958, 
a collection ofhis essays was published posthumously 
in France as Qu 'est-ce le cinema? (What is cinema? 
1 958--62) and subsequently translated into English in 
abridged form ( 1967-72) during the infancy of aca-
demic film studies in the United States. For Bazin, the 
ontology of cinema is based on its necessary ground-
ing in the photographic image, which claims an exis-
tential bond with the world. Through the convergence 
of camera, light, and chemically sensitive paper, the 
world makes an actual impression -
leaves a "trac-
ing" or "fingerprint"- that projects and animates on 
the screen a concrete impression of the actual world. 
By virtue ofthis existential or indexical relation to the 
world and the medium's mechanical capacity to repro-
duce as well as represent reality, Bazin sees the cinema 
as a privileged apparatus capable of phenomenological 
EPOCHE AND REDUCTION, description, and interpretation 
ofworldly phenomena. Mechanical in nature, the cam-
era brackets or puts out ofplay the habituated vision of 
human being, Jets the world speak and impress itself 
upon the film and our perception, and Jeads us to a fresh 
awareness of the contingent and ambiguous nature of 
existence. 
For Bazin, the true film artist is humble before this 
un ion of camera and world; does not interrupt through 
excessive editing the evolution or "becoming" of the 
world's meaning; and respects spatial complexity and 
temporal continuity through the /ong shot (the camera 
is placed ata distance to take in the whole scene), the 
long take (the shot is of Jengthy duration and camera 
movement rather than editing creates relational mean-
ing among scenic elements), deepfocus (the Jens foca] 
length allows clear focus in both foreground and back-
ground of the shot), and camera movement- ali of 
which allows the world to reveal itself in its "pure" ob-
jective reality. Bazin privileges what might be called 
the "perceptual realism" ofthe cinema. That is, he feels 
that objective reality and the richness of the world's 
meaning emerges in the medium most fully when the 
camera stays within the spatio-temporal bounds of hu-
man -
not mechanical -
perception. Slow or fast 
motion, superimpositions, and various optica! "tricks" 
impose meaning upon the world much as do extensive 
montage or editorial manipulation, reduc ing ambiguity 
and the mystery ofthe world's "becoming." 
In 1960, in the United States, Theory of Film: The 
Redemption of Physical Rea/ity by Siegfried Kracauer 
(1889-1966) provided a complement to Bazin's per-
ceptual realism. A leading intellectual and literary fig-
ure in Weimar Germany (which he left in 1933 when 
Hitler carne to power), Kracauer had written exten-
sively on the cinema. His masterwork can be secn as 
privileging what might be called the "empirica! real-
ism" of the cinema. Like Bazin, for Kracauer the cin-
ematic apparatus has the power to reveal the objective 
world in its significance for human being. However, un-
like Bazin, Kracauer celebrates the apparatus as being 
able to extend the limits ofhuman vision mechanically. 
Through its own mechanical capacities, including slow 
and fast motion, the cinema can reveal the very large 
and the very small, the unattended and unintended, the 
heretofore hidden. Upon this basis, Kracauer develops 
a material aesthetics very different from Bazin 's hu-
manist aesthetics. Initially criticized by film scholars 
as a "vulgar realism" developed within the context of a 
metaphysical philosophy (i.e., the redemption ofphys-
ical reality) complementary to positivism, Kracauer's 
dry and Jengthy description of the cinema seemed far 
removed from Bazinian phenomenology. Indeed, it is 
only recently (in the revisiting of Kracauer by scholars 
such as HEIDI SCHLOPMANN) that his realist "theory" has 
been reevaluated as a phenomenology of "film after 
Auschwitz" in which the mechanical nature of cinema 
reveals, even in fiction, the souJless corporeality of a 
perception that exists over and above human intention-
ality. 
InitiaJly, Bazin 's and Kracauer's realist aesthetics 
excited scholarly debate not only about the difference 

FILM 
between them, but also between formalists who saw the 
cinema's ontology in its expressive and transformative 
properties and realists who privileged the medium's 
indexicality (whether perceptually or empirically rep-
resented). However, as film studies moved toward a 
"linguistic turn," the realist-formalist debate was itself 
called into question. 
It was the notion of unmediated representation as 
well as the almost religious celebration ofthe cinema's 
essential and transcendental revelatory power that be-
came increasingly problematic. JEAN MITRY, in his ex-
haustive and untranslated two-volume Esthetique et 
p.\ychologie du cinema ( 1963/ 1965)- both a critique 
and culmination ofthe descriptive research done under 
the rubric offilmologie- presents meticulous pheno-
menological descriptions of cinematic perception as 
well as forms of cinematic expression, but also crit-
icizes Ayfre, Agel, and Bazin. For Mitry, cinema is 
not mystical, ineffable, or transcendental, nor is it un-
mediated and apodictic; rather, the medium is open in 
its possibilities for signification. Yet Mitry is neither a 
semiotician nor a structuralist. At the end of this de-
scriptive and philosophical masterwork, he insists there 
can be no essentialist description of cinema, for- un-
like the other arts- the medium expresses life with 
life itself and overruns in existential praxis the a priori 
principles and rules that would govern and contain it. 
Despite their Jack of translation into English, the 
theologically informed phenomenology of Ayfre and 
Agel, and the work of the more widely read Bazin as 
well as Mitry's critique of transcendental phenomen-
ology, together provided the context for the negative 
reception ofphenomenology by academic cinema stud-
ies in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Coincident with 
the discipline's "linguistic turn," the notion that the 
mechanical and photographic nature ofthe medium al-
Jowed it a pure and unhabituated vision through which 
the world might appear in its essential reality was crit-
icized as, on the one hand, positing a transcenden-
tal vision of the world that might well belong to ED-
MUND HUSSERL 's transcendental EGO and, on the other 
hand, amounting to a naive realism that, in claiming 
the world 's apodicticity by way of the cinema, sup-
pressed the irreducibly mediated nature of cinematic 
representation and ignored the Jatter's Jinguistic and 
ideologica! character. 
lndeed, when referred to at ali, phenomenology 
229 
was identified with Husserl 's CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMEN-
OLOGY. Works of existential phenomenology that ex-
plored cinematic signification and were more relevant 
to issues in contemporary cinesemiotics, such as Bel-
gian psychologist JEAN PIER RE MEUNIER's Les structures 
de l'experiencefilmique (1969) or Italian film-maker 
Pier Paolo Pasolini's Empirismo eretico (1972) were 
almost completely ignored. On the other side of the 
Atlantic as well, few attempts at a synthetic descrip-
tion of cinema or of the film experience were noticed 
and books such as George Linden 's Rejiections on the 
Screen and Mark Slade's Language ()(Cinema: Mov-
ing lmages ()( Man (both 1970) made little impact. 
One work that did, however, was by Stanley Cavell 
-
oddly enough, an analytic philosopher. His phe-
nomenologically inftected ontology of film, The World 
Viewed ( 1971 ), explored how the cinema and the spec-
tator co-constitute a lifeworld, but his phenomenology 
was overshadowed by his aestheticism and undercut 
by the defensiveness of film studies at what was per-
ceived to be his philosophical "slumming" in the new 
discipline. 
During the late 1960s and early 1970s (the period 
identified with the move from classical to contempo-
rary film theory), phenomenology was primarily used 
against itself in relation to the cinema. In the context of 
semiotic and structural analysis ofthe cinema as a sig-
nifying system, phenomenology was considered blind 
to the mediating functions of LANGUAGE and culture. 
In the context of !ater psychoanalytical and ideologi-
cal analysis of spectatorial engagement with cinema, 
phenomenology provided the means for negative de-
scription and interpretation of, on the one hand, film 
spectators as vacant, passive, immoblized, and infan-
tilized image-receptacles and, on the other, projected 
films as disembodied, transcendental visions that over-
whelmed and subjugated spectators who mistook cin-
ematic vision and agency as their own. Furthermore, 
with the emergence of FEMINIST film theory and post-
colonial studies during this period, phenomenology 
was seen as just another totalizing humanistic philoso-
phy that suppressed sexual and cultural differences as 
it spoke of"essential" human structures of experience. 
Central to this critique were Christian Metz and 
Jean-Louis Baudry, their work translated into English 
in the mid-1970s. Although early chapters of Metz's 
Essais sur la signification du cinema ( 1968) were be-

230 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
holden to Mitry's phenornenological description of cin-
ematic perception and expressive forms, Metz's subse-
quent work investigates the semiotic codes and psychic 
processes that determine cinematic signification, and 
is overtly hostile to phenomenology. Baudry's widely 
discussed essay "Ideologica! Effects ofthe Basic Cin-
ematographic Apparatus" (written in 1970 and pub-
lished in English in 1 974) also includes phenomen-
ology only to critique it. Baudry sees the cinematic ap-
paratus as not only deceptively based on illusory rather 
than "real" movement, but also informed historically 
by an optics ofRenaissance perspective that comprises 
a particular ideology of visual mastery. Overtly link-
ing the camera's mobility ofviewpoint, the intentiona! 
structure and supposed disembodiment of its vision, 
and the bracketing of the world's real existence in 
its illusory image to Husserl 's transcendental subject, 
Baudry criticizes this subject and the reduction it per-
forms as phantasmatic and in bad faith, for it allows 
the spectator visual mastery and pleasure through the 
literal assumption of a false consciousness. 
Baudry's argument against cinema~ its apparatus 
and its productions and their inherent subjection ofthe 
spectator to an ideologically informed "transcendental 
vi sion"~ stands opposed to Bazin 's earlier argument 
for cinema as inherently engaged in the apodictic and 
revelatory process of phenomenological epoche. Both 
arguments, however, posit the topographical apparatus 
ofthe cinema as resembling the process ofphenomen-
ological method. This potential reversibility between 
a phenomenology of film and film as phenomenology 
caused further discomfort in a discipline wary of such 
chiasmic logic. 
Du ring this period of focus on ideology, the uncon-
scious, and spectatorial desire in the cinema, a single 
voice attempted to redeem phenomenology for film 
studies. In J 976, J. DUDLEY ANDREW published The Ma-
jor Film Theories, a widely read introduction to the 
premises grounding various approaches to the cinema 
during film theory's "classical" period and including a 
final chapter on phenomenology that focused on the 
work of Ayfre and A gel. In 1977, Andrew applied 
phenomenology to a particular film in "The Gravity 
of Sunrise," and "The Neglected Tradition of Pheno-
menology in Film Theory" followed in 1978, both pub-
lished in journals specific to the discipline. The latter 
essay is both a history of phenomenology's troubled 
conjunction with the cinema and a caii for a return to 
a mode of thought and a method that might describe 
the sensuous, affective, AESTHETrc, and ETiliC AL dimen-
sions of signification in the film experience neglectcd 
by the search for codes and textual systems. As be-
fore, the few who hceded this caii in the early 1 980s 
were hardly noticed. In the United States, there were 
isolated essays using a phenomenological approach to 
explore film aesthetics, film Mus re, TIME and ten se, cam-
era movement, and sound, but most of these appeared 
in journals only tangential to film studies. 
Nonetheless, during the decade that followed, cer-
tain scholars emergcd who, working in the essay 
form, seemed committed to phenomenological in-
quiry: ANNETTE MICHELSON, BRIAN LEWIS, ALEXANDFR 
SESONSKE, ALLAN CASEBIER, JOHN BELTON, FRANK TOMA-
SULO, GERTRUD KOCH, HEIDI SCHLUPMANN, and VIVIAN 
SOBCHACK. During this period in Europe, severa! books 
of some significance appeared, yet Jean Pierre Meu-
nier's Essai sur 1 'image et la communication ( 1 980), 
an extraordinary broadening of his earlier phenomen-
ology of cinematic identification to a phenomenology 
of moving image communication, went unnoticed, as 
did Hungarian YVETTE BJRo's less rigorous but appeal-
ing Profan mitologia ( 1982; translated into English in 
1990 as Profane Mythologies: The Savage Mind olthe 
Cinema). 
Given his critica! position in the intellectual mi-
lieu of poststructuralism, however, Gilles Deleuze 's 
Cinema 1 {1982) and Cinema 2 ( 1 985) were not only 
translated {1986, 1989), but also captured attention (if 
not application) on both sides of the Atlantic. Based 
primarily in the work of HENRI BERGSON on tempo-
ral consciousness and using Charles Sanders Peirce 's 
semiology in relation to the essentially iconic nature 
of the cinema, Deleuze first explored the "movement-
image" (the development of events or narrative) and 
then the "time-image" (coexistent but discrete mo-
ments of duration) ~ 
arguing the primacy of the for-
mer prior to World War II and the latter after, as well as 
describing specific performers, directors, and films in 
terms of style as existential comportment in space and 
time. Thus Deleuze lays the philosophical and critica! 
ground for a semiotic phenomenology of cinema, and 
demonstrates its relevance and application to the his-
torical development ofthe narrative film. Nonetheless, 
viewing phenomenology as bringing to the foreground 

FILM 
the difference rather than similarity between cinema 
and natural perception, Deleuze denies that his work is 
phenomenological. 
The translation ofDeleuze's volumes signaled what 
was to become a growing critique of certain deficien-
cies in poststmcturalist thought and an increasing, if 
tentative, interest in what phenomenology might offer 
film studies. For feminists who had first embraced it, 
the psychic and ideologica\ determinism and negativ-
ity of Lacanian psychoanalytical theory and Baudry's 
critique ofthe cinematic apparatus forestalled the pos-
sibility ofthe film experience as liberatory, expansive, 
or constructive and made it impossible for spectato-
rial pleasure tobe deemed anything but perverse. Film 
scholars dealing with national cinemas, cultural iden-
tity, and postcoloniality regarded the "death of the 
subject" as premature and ideologically problematic. 
Jndeed, in the context of POSTMODERNISM and global 
culture, from the mid-1980s on, film studies enter-
tained increasingly fluid notions of subjectivity, sex-
uality, ethnicity, and race and growing awareness of 
cultural hybridity, spectatorial agency, cinematic p\ea-
sure and affect, and the presence of the BODY both on 
screen and off. 
Thus the late 1980s and early 1990s have seen 
renewed interest in phenomenology and its non-
determinist and synthetic approach to the film expe-
rience. In 1990, the Quarterly Revinv of Film and 
Video published a special issue: "Phenomenology in 
Film and Television." Essays deal with representa-
tion, vision as embodied activity, film as experience, 
cinematic scopophilia, feminism and phenomenology, 
temporality, television reruns, and video technology as 
ontology; the issue also includes a selective bibliog-
raphy. Two of its contributors subsequently published 
major books, both ofwhich, however different their ap-
proach, contested the linguistic turn that had dominated 
contemporary film theory for almost twenty years. On 
the one hand, Alian Casebier's Film and Phenomen-
ology ( 1991) uses Husserl 's phenomenology and his 
account of representation to challenge dominant no-
tions of the image as merely illusory and substitutive. 
Vivian Sobchack's The Address ofthe Eye (1992), on 
the other hand, explicitly rejects constitutive pheno-
menology and uses Merleau-Ponty's late work on sig-
nification and his notion of embodied consciousness 
to develop an existential and semiotic phenomenology 
231 
of the film experience that contests and complements 
dominant psychoanalytical theories of cinematic iden-
tification. The film experience is described as inter-
subjective and dialogical- the film and spectator as 
two viewers viewing, the convergence or divergence 
of their vi sua! and intentiona\ interest co-creating the 
significance ofthe visible. Furthermore, the cinema is 
seen as bringing to visibility for the first time the invis-
ible structure and visual activity we each live as "our 
own" vision. It is this structure and activity that links 
both spectator and film and accounts for the cinema's 
primary intelligibility. 
The prospects for phenomenology in film studies 
seem bright insofar as phenomenological description 
takes account of its own status as qualified by history 
and culture and is existential rather than constitutive. 
lts biggest obstacles to acceptance are, first, overcom-
ing the prejudice attached to transcendental phenomen-
o\ogy and its alleged essentialism and ahistoricism and, 
second, the fact that, unlike much analysis in the disci-
pline, applied phenomenology cannot be done with a 
template. Although these obstacles may be difficult to 
overcome given the history ofboth theory and method 
in film studies, phenomenology offers the discipline 
both a rich vocabulary with which to articulate the dy-
namic correlations offilms and spectators in the world 
that counts as real, and a reflective method that is re-
sponsive to the film experience as it is variously lived 
rather than merely thought.

EUGEN FINK 
The historical linkage of Fink 
to phenomenology is undisputed, yet there is consid-
erable uncertainty about attributing to him any kind 
of essential place in phenomenology's development. 
Even a briefhistorical account, however, indicates that 
his relationship with EDMUND HUSSERL was an unusual 
one, so that the terms for explaining his contributions 
ha ve to be drawn from the nature of that relationship 
itself. 
Fink came to phenomenology after an apprentice-
ship in philosophy marked by an early avid reading 
of Nietzsche and Kant. Born in Konstanz on Decem-
ber 11, 1905, he attended the same humanities Gymna-
sium that MARTIN HEIDEGGER had attended nearly twenty 
years earlier. There he acquired both his love of phi-
losophy and the inexpensive hand editions of Kant and 
Nietzsche (and others) that he would use the rest of 
his life. After completing his Abitur in 1925, Fink en-
tered the university, first in Milnster (summer semester 
1925), and then in Freiburg (winter semester 1925/26), 
where, except for the summer of 1926 in Berlin, he 
remained for the rest ofhis studies. 
Fink took every course Husserl offered and then 
those that Martin Heidegger began giving as Husserl 's 
successor in the first chair of philosophy (from the 
winter semester 1928/29 on). In November 1929, with 
Husserl as Referent (dissertation director) and Hei-
degger as Korreferent, Fink defended the disserta-
tion that Husserl then published in his Jahrbuch un-
der the title Vergegenwărtigung und Bild. Beitrăge 
zur Phănomenologie der Unwirklichkeit, !. Teil (Re-
presentation and image. Contribution to the phenomen-
ology of inactuality, 1930). This would be the only 
book Fink would publish until after World War II. 
Husserl chose him in 1928 to work as an assistant, 
but with the accession ofthe Nazis to power fi ve years 
!ater and Fink's refusal to abandon Husserl, his habili-
tation, the next stage of a normal academic career, was 
blocked. 
Fink became Husserl 's sole assistant from 1930 
on, when LUDWIG LANDGREBE, Husserl 's assistant sin ce 
1923, Ieft to devote himselfto his Habilitationsschrift. 
By this time Fink had entered into Husserl's daily 
regime of work, and he worked close1y and intense1y 
with him on ali Husserl 's projects un tii Husserl 's death 
on April 27, 1938. For example, in 1930 Fink wrote 
the "Disposition zu 'System der phănomenologischen 
Philosophie' von Edmund Husserl," which has re-
cently been pub1ished in the Husserliana Dokumente 
series, an outline for a comprehensive systematic work 
Husserl wanted to compose in place ofhis Cartesianis-
che Meditationen [1931 ]. In fact Husserl never got very 
far on this new work, continually oscillating between 
it and the idea of simp1y revising and expanding the 
Meditationen themselves. In the end it was Fink who 
produced a methodical revision, offering Husserl in the 
summer of 1932 a nearly complete integrated rework-
ing ofthe "Meditationen," including the "VI. Medita-
tion, Die Idee einer transzendentalen Methodenlehre." 
In Fink's full-scale idea for the revision there was to 
ha ve been as well a "VII. Metaphysik," but the possibil-
ity of actually finishing this revision was undermined

with Hitler's coming to power. Husserl also set Fink 
the task ofrevising his 1917-18 Bem au manuscripts on 
"time and individuation," as Husserl had characterized 
these studies to Heidegger in a letter from March 28, 
1918. The editing work on the Bernau texts, however, 
led to Husserl's producing new manuscript studies on 
temporality (the so-called C series) and the analysis of 
TIME kept transmuting. Whatever draft of a full-scale 
text Fink finally wrote, however, is lost, and ali that re-
mains of his efforts are his transcriptions of Husserl 's 
originals and his own extensive though discontinuous 
research notes. 
Besides his dissertation, Fink published only two 
other things during his years with Husserl. One 
was the famous 1933 Kant-Studien article, "Die 
phănomenologische Philosophie Edmund Husserls in 
der gegenwărtigen Kritik," a recasting of Fink's "VI. 
Meditation" that was nearly not published owing to the 
politica! "co-ordination" ( Gleichschaltung) that Kant-
Studien was beginning to undergo. It is in this publi-
cation that Husserl made his extraordinary statement: 
"At the request ofthe distinguished editorship of Kant-
Studien I ha ve carefully gone through this essay, and I 
am happy to be able to say that there is no statement 
in it that I could not make fully my own, that I could 
not explicitly acknowledge as my own conviction." 
Fink managed to publish only one more short article 
on Husserl, "Was will die Phănomenologie Edmund 
Husserls?" (1934), and then nothing further until he 
left Germany a year after Husserl 's death. 
Fink worked closely with Husserl on Die Krisis der 
europăischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale 
Phiinomenologie ( 1936), which was unfinished when 
Husserl died. Within six months of Husserl's death 
the entire Nachlass was smuggled to Leuven and thus 
saved from destruction, and Fink himself emigrated to 
Belgium to join Landgrebe, also in exile there. 
This was the time when Fink renewed contact with 
phenomenology in France. It had begun earlier when 
GASTON BERGER carne to Freiburg in August 1934 to 
visit Husserl. Berger drew heavily from Fink's few 
published writings in preparing his Le cogito dans la 
philosophie de Husserl (1941), and it was Fink's giv-
ing Berger a copy of the "VI. Meditation" that en-
abled others to read that singular text, most notably 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY and TRAN DUC THAO. Now in 
1939, within but two weeks of Fink's own arrival in 
Leuven, Merleau-Ponty carne to spend a week (April 
1--6) studying Husserl 's unpublished manuscripts, and 
found himself having long conversations with Fink. 
The extent to which Merleau-Ponty's adaptation of 
Husserl's work drew upon core ideas in Fink's under-
standing has yet tobe explicated, but the references are 
unmistakable, and there are remarkable consonances 
that surely bear upon our interpretation of the subse-
quent history of phenomenology, especially in FRANCE 
and the UNITED STATES. 
The Leuven respite lasted, however, little more than 
a year. Germany invaded Belgium on May 1 O, 1940; 
Fink and Landgrebe found themselves again under 
the Nazi Reich and they had little choice but to re-
turn to Germany. When Fink arrived in Freiburg he 
was inducted into the German military and served 
around that city as an airplane spotter. Fi ve years !ater, 
with the war ended and normal academic life begin-
ning tobe reestablished, he finally gained his habilita-
tion, presenting his "VI. Meditation" as the work that 
Husserl himself had advised him to present for that 
purpose a dozen years earlier. Beginning as Dozent 
in 1946, Fink became Ordinarius fiir Philosophie und 
Erziehungswissenschaft at Freiburg in 1948, where 
he remained despite offers from Koln ( 1948), Berlin 
( 1957), and Vienna ( 1965). To maintain his indepen-
dence, he even declined Heidegger's request that he 
succeed in the chair of philosophy that he, Heidegger, 
had so controversially occupied after Husserl. Fink re-
tired in 1971 and died on July 25, 1975. 
Fink's writings after 1945 seem to bear litt1e mark 
of his having worked so closely with Husserl on tran-
scendental phenomenology. None of the apparatus or 
technical issues that typify Husserl 's program seem to 
come to the forefront in what he published. As their 
titles indicate, his books tend to focus either on overar-
ching ontologica! themes or on human realms ofbasic 
significance. The philosophers he writes about are pre-
Husserlian, Hegel and Nietzsche most prominently. His 
occasional papers on Husserl ha ve been serious and in-
fluential, but seem to stand apart from his university 
lectures and the books he drew from them. In short, 
Fink's postwar work seems largely to stand outside of 
what Husserl would ha ve envisaged as the continuation 
of phenomenology, and he does not figure among what 
most take to be the phenomenologists of the second 
half ofthe 20th century. Clearly the question of Fink 's 

234 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ro le in phenomenology poses peculiar problems. 
The place to begin, however, is where Fink be-
gan: with his work with Husserl. And the question 
to ask is: what exactly did Fink do for Husserl? But 
this question requires first asking a~other: what was it 
that Husserl himself did not do, or, better, le(t undone? 
Now if Husserl's phenomenology is the transcenden-
tal program announced in the ldeen zu einer reiner 
Phiinomenologie und phanomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 (1913 ), the Cartesianische Meditationen, and 
the Krisis texts, then it is clear that his real phenomen-
ological philosophy, as he was wont to say in the final 
years, lay in his manuscripts, not in these "introduc-
tions" to phenomenology he published. 
Yet to elicit the "real" philosophical work from the 
incredible mass of Husserl 's manuscripts, o ne needs 
a statement of guiding principles. Is there any such 
statement, are there any such guidelines? Do we have 
the systematic principles for realizing phenomenology 
beyond the preliminary declarations that are so familiar 
but that Husserl himself criticized and radicalized? It 
is with this question that the place of Eugen Fink in 
phenomenology can begin to be defined. 
What was left undone when Husserl died was less a 
matter of elaborating positive phenomenological find-
ings and making scrupulous eidetic analyses of partic-
ular matters than the defining ofphenomenology in full 
systematic organization and integration so as to make it 
possible to harmonize the different levels and thematic 
domains in its vast programmatic complexity. The fi-
nal task of phenomenology was the phenomenology 
of phenomenology, including most particularly a tran-
scendental themy of method whose principles would 
make a systematic self-critique andfinal philosophical 
sel(-interpretation possible. 
In Husserl 's writings this task was repeatedly an-
nounced, yet in the 1930s it was actua!Zv being done, 
except that it was not being done by Husserl alone; it 
was being done by Husserl together with Fink. And 
indeed, in the material that documents their collabora-
tion, this part was being done far more by Fink than by 
Husserl! 
When o ne looks beyond Husserl 's own writings, in-
cluding the thousands of Forschungsmanuskripte (re-
search manuscripts) he produced, and begins to study 
not just the few essays Fink publishcd at the time but 
the many hundreds ofpages ofhis own personal notes, 
together with the dozens of typed drafts he prepared 
for Husserl (all kept in the Eugen Fink-Archiv at the 
Pădagogische Hochschule in Freiburg) -
and then 
when one adds the remarks Husserl kept making in his 
wide correspondence-a remarkable picture emerges. 
Fink was neither a secretary do ing editorial work on the 
master's texts nor a disciple following Husserl in du-
tiful orthodoxy. He was another thinker with Husserl, 
an Other within phenomenology, working to fill out 
within it what Husserl himself never did or perhaps 
never could do. Thus Husserl describes how he and 
Fink had talked over ali the projects and ideas he was 
working on, "and we think together," Husserl writes, 
"we are like two communicating vessels" (letter to Fa-
ther Daniel Feuling, March 30, 1933). Or in one ofthe 
rare letters to Fink himself, Husserl says to him that 
he, Fink, has been "for years now no longer my 'as-
sistant,' nor my secretary, not my intellectual servant." 
"You are," Husserl continues, "my collaborator, and, in 
addition, my seminar, my teachership" (July Il, 1934). 
The interplay in question is clear in the "Sixth 
Meditation," where Husserl 's extensive alterations and 
marginal comments to Fink 's text suggest something of 
the kind of conversations the two must ha ve had. And 
the subtitle, "The Idea of a Transcendental Theory of 
Method," designates the heart of their collaborative 
dialogue. 
Husserl was a master of analysis, but the consoli-
dation ofhis research results was another thing. Com-
prehensive integration was eluding him in these last 
years ofhis life, and by 1934 Husserl had in fact pretty 
well abandoned the effort to produce a complete sys-
tematic presentation of his thought. He did achieve 
one more grand statement of ideas in his Krisis, but 
this was, once again, more the explanation of an en-
try into phenomenology than a comprehensive expla-
nation according to the principles required of a gen-
uine transcendental level. Fink's "Sixth Meditation," 
on the other hand, explicitly sketched out what was re-
quired for that advanced systematic level, and Husserl 
returned to it again and again for challenge and stim-
ulus. So to understand Fink 's part of the collaboration 
means to understand the "Sixth Meditation." 
This supplement to Husserl 's Cartesianische Medi-
tationen is not about the phenomena analyzed in those 
preceding five (whether constituted structures or the 
originative constituting processes themselves); it is 

EUGEN FINK 
235 
about what the doing of that analysis itself must be 
according to the requirements of the key operation 
ofthe phenomenologica\ EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION. Here 
the "subjectivity" by and for which phenomenologi-
cal analysis is done is brought forward as an explicit 
theme, together with the specific methods by which 
self-awareness on the part of constitutive agency is 
achieved ---al\ in explicit critiquc of naive conceptions 
or presuppositions stil\ holding sway, so as to allow 
purely reduction-level cognition to be realized. Thus 
the special nature of the evidential "experiencing," the 
"ideation," and the "theorizing" that are done when 
constitutive processes themselves are thematized must 
be examined, together with specifically transcendental 
"languagc" and "science," precisely as transsolipsistic, 
as intersubjective in their very practice. Here, too, is 
taken up the question of how the vcry sense of being 
is affected by the transcendental epoche, and therefore 
what kind of being is to be attributed to both constitu-
tive processes themselves and the thinking action and 
agency that attends to those processes in the act of 
phenomenologizing. 
While these issues are formulated in the "Sixth Med-
itation," that text nevertheless does not go very far 
toward elaborating their resolution. It is meant rather 
as an outline, the "idea" of a transcendental theory of 
method, not its actual elaboration, and the theory of 
method is only one part of the fu\1-sca\e phenomen-
ology ofphenomenology itse\f. 
To see more ofthe systematic integration and more 
of the detailed methodological critique it required, we 
ha veto go to Fink's manuscript work in the background 
ofthe "Sixth Meditation," for this is where Fink's con-
tribution to the dialogue of Husserl 's daily regimen is 
documented. 
From study of Fink's manuscript notes the follow-
ing main points emerge. ( 1) Leve!s olana~vsis ha veto 
be rccognized, and only then can findings on differ-
ent themes be interpretively integrated. (2) The nature 
of Husserl's "~ystem" has to be recognized, preciscly 
in the interplay between guiding general insights and 
phenomenological analysis of details. (3) In particu-
lar, the distinction has to be made between analysis 
and specu!ation, that is, between matters that can be 
positively investigated and those that, being matters of 
philosophica\ interpretation rather than the intuitional 
evidencing of phenomena, are "constructive" or "spec-
ulative." (4) Finally, recognition ofthe limitations in-
trinsic to phenomenology may require transition be-
yond phenomenology in the sense of a program for 
establishing positive findings (i.e., taken as a science). 
Levels ol analysis. There is scarcely a work of 
Husserl 's that does not mention the need to begin by 
using certain already furnished intellectual materials to 
perform the analyses that comprise phenomenology's 
own work, and then to go back through those anal-
yses in order to criticize the naivete and presupposi-
tions in them. In other words, "naive straightforward 
phenomenology" must be followed by what is called 
"reflective phenomenology on a higher level" in Er-
ste Philosophie Il [1924]. What makes the difference 
between the two is the phenomenological reduction, 
which in its moment of epoche neutralizes any concep-
tions whose home origin and application is mundane 
experience, i.e., experience that is itse\fthe constituted 
resul! of constituting processes. This is especially true 
of the self-conceptions ol human being and acting that 
philosophica\ history has left already in hand. Thus in 
describing the move from naive in-the-world thought 
to properly phenomenological reflection, Husserl be-
gan in Ideen I by representing constituting subjectivity 
in the conceptual drcss ofhuman immanent psycholog-
ical consciousness. as a "remnant" left over when that 
which is externa\ to it, the "transcendent" objects ofthe 
surrounding "world," was stripped away. Yet human 
consciousness is not phenomenologically conceivable 
as separated off from the world; the WORLD embraces 
human immanence together with "transcendence," the 
objects of"external" experience. Hence the ent1y-\eve\ 
conception of "immanent transcendental constituting 
subjectivity" needed to be reinterpreted at a proper re-
duction-lcvel; subjectivity had tobe "unnaturalized" in 
Husserl's terms, "un-·humanized" in Fink's. 
The principle of phenomenological se\f-critique is 
clear enough; the practice, however, was rarely carried 
out in fu\1 radicality. Two signal instances in which 
Fink's unpublished writings give concise indication 
of the critica\ recasting still needed are thc issues of 
temporality and monadology. 
For temporality Fink argued two principal points. 
First, temporality is analyzed obviously as "inner time-
consciousncss." Yet if consciousness as such is a phe-
nomenon in time, i.e., is mundane, then the structure 
of time-consciousness cou ld not set the terms for the 

236 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
temporal process that was the very action of fundamen-
tal constitution itself. Urzeitigung(primal temporaliza-
tion) has to be interpreted out of time-consciousness 
structures against the mundaneity ofthose structures as 
themselves constituted in and by Urzeitigung. Second, 
however, and more specifically, if the subject-object 
correlation is also a structure typical of consciousness 
as mundane, then the presentness that makes for the 
way an abject is "before" a subject is precisely what 
has tobe explained as a constituted effect; the subject-
object correlation as a presencing structure cannot be 
assumed as properly characterizing the constitutive ac-
tion of Urzeitigung itself. Here a reduction-governed 
critique must enter to control the more radical reinter-
pretation of the findings of the initial phenomenology 
of time-consciousness. 
As for monadology, the procedure is similar. Talk 
of"monads" is descriptive terminology borrowed from 
mundane intersubjectivity. Human subjectivity is di-
vided and multiplied into individual human persons 
empathetically bound together and acting in commu-
nity. However, while human inter-multi-subjectivity 
may well be taken as indicating the trans-individuality 
that must characterize the transcendental, mundane hu-
man multiplicity cannot be retained as the transcenden-
tally appropriate structural paradigm- notat the level 
of fu li reduction-governed self-critique. What may be 
legitimate as the representation of introductory levels 
must here be questioned and radically reinterpreted. 
The nature of Husserl :S "system. " Considerations 
like these make it imperative to consider the pecu-
liar nature ofHusserl's procedure. For Fink, Husserl's 
"system" was intrinsically "open" and dynamic. It was 
nota totalizing plan but a dynamic interplay between 
concrete investigations and "speculative" projections. 
Emerging from the investigations in the first place, the 
"speculative" components gave sense and direction to 
those analyses, while the investigations of detail con-
tinually broke open the design laid out in these "specu-
lative" comprehensions, thereby forcing their repeated 
interpreti ve recasting. Thus "findings"- regarding IN-
TENTIONALITY, for example- cannot be simply taken 
at face value. They always have to be seen in terms 
of (a) the context in which they are being presented, 
their specific location in the investigational strategy 
that, continuing on, will eventually impose a deepening 
or recasting of the overall conception that ("specula-
tively") guides the individual investigations- aga in, 
e.g., intentionality--and (b) the /evel at which they are 
seen to lie in relation to the critica! reinterpretation re-
quired ofthem in the reduction-governed countering of 
the mundaneity-bound conceptuality that is unavoid-
ably always used. 
Analysis and speculation. Thus phenomenology 
cannot be content merely to pile up investigative find-
ings; it bas to integrate them through a systematic self-
critica! interpreti ve reftection that, always anchored by 
them, never becomes free-ftoating or arbitrary. And the 
work of analysis is different from the work of 5pecu-
lation. Husserl was a masterat the first; Fink saw the 
second painfully lacking as an explicit component in 
Husserl 's everyday labors. It was this that he had to 
try to supply. This was particularly true regarding the 
question of being. Thus, ultimately, in Husserl 's tran-
scendental phenomenology -
where the conception 
ofbeing that guided ali its labors was that being is con-
stituted by a proto-process that could not itself be the 
result of a constitution into being- absolute consti-
tutive process itself had tobe beyond being, in Fink's 
designation, "meontic. " Only a "speculative" reftec-
tion, indeed one that paradoxically held together being 
and nothing, could bring any intelligibility to that. 
Transition beyond phenomenology. Thus for Fink 
many of the principal elements of transcendental 
phenomenology were already components that, while 
they intrinsically grew out ofinvestigations done under 
the principle of intuitive phenomenological evidenc-
ing, needed clarificatory work that did not fit Husserl 's 
"principle of ali principles." This was particularly true 
for certain key structures that Husserl invariably ex-
plicated using the subject-object correlation. For Fink 
explicati an in this manner represented a legitimate pre-
liminary level of phenomenological analysis, but be-
cause the subject-object schema was essentially a mun-
dane structure, this correlation could not be retained in 
radical, self-critica! explication of either the fundamen-
tal constitutive process -
Urzeitigung -
or prima! 
constitutive results, most notably the world and the 
primary horizonal features ofthe world such as SPACE. 
The only recourse for work precisely on the pivotal 
"speculative" matters that both governed and emerged 
within Husserl 's investigations was to move past the 
style, technique, and conceptual paradigms character-
istic of Husserl 's groundbreaking studies. 

FORMAL AND MATERIAL ONTOLOGY 
237 
Such, at least, was Fink's understanding ofwhat he 
was doing as he took his habilitation by presenting his 
"VI. Meditation," his statement ofprecisely the critica! 
moment intrinsically required by Husserl 's own work. 
Part of what Husserl never did or could do was to 
make it possible -
even necessary -
to go beyond 
Husserl! In a sense one could say that Fink, the Other 
within phenomenology who was faithful to Husserl to 
the end, became at the same time the Other without 
-
and faithful there to the impetus ofphenomenology 
Husserl had founded. 
In sum, both the work Fink did for Husserl and 
Fink's postwar teaching and writing require attending 
to the interplay of the two dimensions of analysis and 
speculation that he saw to be fundamental to Husserl 's 
phenomenology. Marks of this schema begin to show 
unmistakably when one looks retrospectively at both 
eras of his work. Yet the thematic elaboration of the 
ideas that make it intelligible remain fragmentary and 
discontinuous, and have long been kept private. Only 
now are they coming to be known, so that only now is 
it finally possible to realize what Fink contributed to 
Husserl's phenomenology, and therefore perhaps what 
that phenomenology itself really comprises.

MUND HUSSERL conceived of science as the general the-
ory of the world and of logic as the theory of science. 
In his Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901 ), he held 
that to every theory there corresponds "a possiblefield 
of" knowledge ... known in mathematical circles as a 
manif"o!d (Mannigf"altigkât)." Insofar as logic concerns 
itself with the study of the object domains (''mani-
folds," or, we would say, models) of possible theo-
ries, Husserl refers to it as ':larma! ontology." He cited 
the work in MATHEMATICS of Georg Friedrich Bernhard 
Riemann ( 1826-1866 ), Hermann Gunther Grassmann 
(1809-1877), William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865), 
Sophus Lie (1842-1899), and Georg Cantor (1845-
1918) as contributions to formal ontology and went 
on to provide the theory of the part-whole and depen-
dence relations in the Third Investigation as his own 
contribution. Formal Ontology is formal LOGIC inso-
far as it is concerned with objects, what we might caii

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the semantics of formal logic. But Husserl's concept 
of formal ontology historically antedates the (Tarskian) 
set-theoretic semantic concepts ( e.g., consequence, va-
lidity, etc.) that we take for granted today. Because it 
embodies a conception of semantics alternative to that 
with which we are familiar, his notion of the relation 
of formal ontology to logic does not translate easily 
into late 20th century, post-Tarskian terms. The notion 
must therefore be considered first within the historical 
context of Husserl 's own thought. 
Husserl 's conception of formal ontology is inti-
mately involved with his conceptions both of logic 
and of what comprises possible objects of theoretical 
inquiry. He inherited an Aristotelian metaphysical per-
spective from the school of FRANZ BRENTANO; his con-
ception of logic was informed by an ontology that in-
cluded both universals and particulars of ontologically 
dependent and independent types. The elucidation of 
his conception of logic as formal ontology therefore 
requires a consideration of his ontology of universal 
essences and his EIDETIC METIIOD. He distinguishes var-
ious types of universal essences (ei de) in terms of the 
relations of generalization and formalization. 
Husserl assumes that each thing is an instance of 
some eidos or essence, and that essences may not only 
ha ve, but be instances (e.g., he holds that every essence 
is an instance ofthe universals "object in general" and 
"essence"). Besides the relation of instance to essence, 
he held that there is a second relation (of generaliza-
tion) defined on essences. In ldeen zu einer reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 ( 1913), the essence "red" is a specification (but 
not an instance) of the more general essence, "color." 
Specification and generalization are inverses: for any 
two essences x and y, x is a generalization of y just in 
case y is a specification of x. 
But the genus "essence" is not a generalization of 
the essence "red" or the essence "triangle." These are 
instances (not specifications) ofthe genus "essence." A 
(rough) guide for understanding this distinction: the in-
stane ing relation is to the generalization relation as the 
membership relation is to the subset relation; similar 
and easily confused- but different. Husserl provides 
a part-whole characterization ofthe difference between 
the relations of instance to essence and specification to 
generalization (which he treats under the topics "for-
malization" and "generalization," respectively). Ify is 
a generalization of x, then y is a part of x (at least 
in some "comprehensive" use of the term "part" that 
Husserl is willing to accept). But ify is a part ofx ( even 
in the comprehensive use ofthe term "part''), then y is 
not a formalization of x. 
From this it follows that no formalization is a gener-
alization and vice versa. The relation of specification to 
generalization enables the definition ofsome important 
types of essences. Any essence x is a gen us i ff there is 
some different essence y such that x is a generalization 
of y. Similarly, any essence x is a species iff there is 
some different essence y such that y is a generalization 
of x. Any essence x is a highest genus iff it is a genus 
and nota species, and a lowest specie.\· iffit is a species 
and not a genus. Every essence either is a lowest (in-
fima) species or is specifiable to an infima species, and 
is either a highest genus, or is generalizable to a highest 
genus. 
Husserl distinguishes between the extension and the 
empirica] extension of an essence. For any essence x, 
there exists an extension of instances of x. Any y is 
the extension of" an essence x iff y is the class of ali 
possible instances of x. Any y is the empirica! extension 
of" an essence x iffy is the class of ali actual (i.e., real) 
instances of x. I f both the empirica! extension and the 
extension of a given essence are non-empty, then the 
former is a proper subclass ofthe latter. 
But Husserl distinguishes further types of exten-
sions relevant to his conception of formal ontology. 
For any essence x, there exists an eidetic extension of 
x. The eidetic extension of any essence x is the class 
of lowest species that are specifications of x. Husserl 
then distinguishes between two types of eidetic ex-
tensions ofuniversals: "material" and "mathematical." 
Any eidetic extension is mathematical just in case it 
is a subset ofthe eidetic extension ofthe essence "ob-
ject in general" (etwas iiberhaupt); otherwise, it is a 
material eidetic extension. 
A second set of distinctions regarding ei de are de-
veloped by Husserl in terms of his notions of onto-
logica! dependence and independence. He calls things 
that require nothing el se ( other than the essences they 
instance) in order to exist ontologically independent 
(example: the nose ofSocrates), ami things that require 
something el se (besides the essences they instance) in 
order to exist ontologica/~v dependent ( example: the 
pugness of the nose of Socrates ). He refers to depen-

FORMAL ANO MATERIAL ONTOLOGY 
239 
dent individuals as moments of the things they require 
in order to exist. 
The distinction between ontologically dependent 
and independent individuals enables an analogous dis-
tinction between dependent and independent essences. 
There are at least two types of lowest species and 
highest genera (those instanced by only independent, 
and those instanced by only dependent instances). Any 
essence is a concretum iff it is a lowest species whose 
extension is a class of independent instances, and is an 
abstractum iffit is a lowest species whose extension is 
a class of dependent instances. Example: the essence 
"veracity" is an abstractum, but the essence ''truthful 
person" is a concretum. 
Genera also come in two types. Any genus is con-
crete iff it is a generalization of some concretum, and 
is abstract iff it is a general ization of some abstractum. 
Any essence is a regional eidos iff it is a highest con-
crete genus. The essence "material thing" is an example 
of a regional ei dos. In Husserl 's account, only conc-
reta are absolutely independent (selbstăndig) essences 
while ali genera are dependent (unselbstiindig). Since 
he claims that any generalization is a part of each of its 
specifications, he holds that the regional eidos must be 
a dependent eidetic part of each member (concretum) 
of its eidetic extension. He defines a regional eidos 
as "the total highest generic unity belonging to a con-
cretum, i.e., the essentially unitary nexus of the high-
est genera pertaining to the infimae species within the 
concretum." The term "unity'' here signals the ("preg-
nant") concept of whole, and the term "within" (in-
nerhalb) reveals that just as the regional eidos is part 
of the concreta that occur as members of its eidetic 
extension, so also the abstracta instanced by the de-
pendent parts of individual members of the extension 
ofthe regional eidos are parts ofthose concreta. Since 
a concretum is a unitary ("pregnant") whole, there is 
some foundation relation between any two of its parts, 
and hence between the regional eidos and abstracta 
that it contains as parts. This claim of the "pregnancy" 
of regiona 1 ei de is the reason why E. John Lemrnon 's 
conception of synthetic a priori necessity (see below) 
is more general than Husserl 's. 
The foregoing discussion of Husserl 's ontology of 
essence now enables a definition of regional ontology 
as the a priori theory associated with a given regional 
ei dos. Specifically, a material ontologv is the set of ali 
"synthetic a priori" sentences that express relations of 
foundation (i.e., of ontologica! dependence) among the 
parts of ali and only those concreta that share a given 
regional eidos as a part. 
Husserl's axiomatic conception of such ontologies 
can be expressed as follows. Assume some (moda!) 
Janguage of material ontology in which the sentences 
in the set ~ are formulated. ~ is a set of axioms for the 
material ontology of the region y iff: both ~ is a (for 
Husserl, probably finite) subset ofthe ontology ofthe 
region y and for each sentence S ofthe ontology ofthe 
region y, S is a consequence of~- The paradigmatic 
case is where ~ is consistent, so the on(v consequences 
of ~ are a priori truths of the region y. Husserl did 
not have the distinction between consequence and the-
oremhood and assumed that the sentence S should be 
a theorem as well as a consequence of~- Husserl then 
held that for each regional ei dos there is a set of syn-
thetic a priori axioms expressing foundation relations 
between instances of the concreta and abstracta of the 
region. He leaves unclear which logic (i.e., Janguage 
and inference system) ~ is formulated within. 
Husserl 's favorite example of a regional essence and 
its ontology in Ideen J is the essence "material abject," 
or "any physical nature whatever," and theoretical (as 
opposed to experimental) physics, but the second and 
third books ofthe ldeen involve extensive discussions 
also ofthe regional ontologies ofthe BODY, the psyche, 
and culture. Consequences of the axioms of any re-
gional ontology are truc a priori for that region. But o ne 
regional ontology is privileged, in the sense that con-
sequences of its axioms are true of every region. That 
is the ontology of the regional eidos "object in gen-
eral" (etwas iiberhaupt), which Husserl called '~j(Jrmal 
ontology" to distinguish it from the (aforementioned) 
material ontologies. But while Husserl thought offor-
mal ontology as an a priori theory ofthe region etwas 
!lberhaupt, he knew that formal ontology could not be 
considered just one among the many regional ontolo-
gies. Claiming that the "formal region" is "nota region 
but the empty form of any region whatever," he felt 
that formal ontology prescribes for material ontologies 
a formal structure common to them ali. 
Formal ontology is both unique and prescriptive 
vis-a-vis the material regional ontologies. One of the 
(two) ways Husserl distinguishes formal from mate-
rial ontology involves the Kantian distinction between 

240 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
synthetic and analytic a priori sentences. He character-
ized formal ontology as consisting of only the latter, 
and the material regional ontologies as including the 
former type of a priori sentences. The question then is 
what he meant by KANT's term "analytic"; the distinc-
tion between formal and material ontology depends 
upon preserving the Kantian distinction between the 
synthetic and the analytic a priori. 
In ldeen 1 Husserl cites the definition of analytic-
ity given in the third ofthe Logische Untersuchungen. 
There synthetic and analytic laws are distinguished in 
terms ofthe concept of"formalization salva veritate." 
An a priori truth is analytic just in case it is formal-
izable salva veritate (i.e., just in case the sentential 
schema that results from [ uniformly] replacing senten-
tial constants by sentential variables is also true). He 
says further only that a sentence is synthetic a priori just 
in case it is not analytic, but is nevertheless grounded 
in some regional ei dos. What exactly Husserl meant by 
this phrase "grounded in" (inhalte griindenden gesei-
zen) is mysterious. 
This presupposes a definition of law (viz. a priori 
truth) that is unavailable and yields no criterion for 
distinguishing necessary (a priori) from contingent (a 
posteriori) synthetic sentences, since neither type is 
formalizable salva veritate. The "salva veritate" for-
mulation suggests that Husserl was thinking of analytic 
a priori truths as substitution instances of valid senten-
tial schemata. A sentential schema is like a sentence, 
except that variables occur in place of its component 
non-logica] (sentential) constants. Replacing such vari-
ables (uniformly) with sentcnces yields a substitution 
instance of the schema. A schema is valid just in case 
it has no false substitution instance, and a sentence is 
analytic just in case it is a substitution instance of a 
valid schema. 
However, interpreting Husserl 's notions of analytic-
ity and formal ontology in terms ofthe current concep-
tion ofvalidity requires two provisos. The first proviso 
concerns our (set-theoretic) understanding of validity 
and Husserl 's (part-theoretic) understanding of analyt-
icity. Husserl was relatively innocent of the model-
theoretic semantics in terms of which we understand 
any type of validity today. Today the metalinguistic 
claim "p is valid" means "p is true under every in-
terpretation of the language." An lnterpretation I of 
the language is an assignment of a model to the lan-
guage. A model is an ordered sequence (which is a 
complicated kind of set) ofsets, including as members 
a uni verse U of discourse and some relations on (such 
as the subset p of) U. A sentence "S is P" (Husserl's 
"predication") is true under the interpretation 1 when 
I assigns the predicate "P" to a set p and the subject 
"S" to a member of p. These set-theoretic conceptions 
are alien to Husserl 's understanding ofthe a priori, and 
hence to his conception of formal ontology. 
Husserl conceived of predication in terms of the 
part relation; he understood "S is P" as true when the 
predicate "P" denotes a part of the whole denoted by 
the subject "S." The late discussion in Elfahrung und 
Urteil ( 1939) of predication as expressing dependent 
part relations, and the early claim in the third of the 
Logische Untersuchungen that the assertion "the exis-
tence of a whole W (A, B, C, ... ) generally includes 
(i.e., is conditiona/ upon) that of its parts A, B, C, ... " 
is analytic, both suggest that mereology (the theory of 
part-whole relation) is to Husserl's notion ofthe a pri-
ori as set theory (the theory of membership relation) 
is to validity. Husserl's own understanding of formal 
and material ontologythen presupposes a mereological 
semantics envisioned by him but as yet worked out by 
no one. 
The second proviso concerns which concepts ofva-
lidity are relevant to the ana(ytic and synthetic types of 
necessity. The lack of an adequate criterion for distin-
guishing synthetic a priori from synthetic a posteriori 
sentences suggests that the concept of validity behind 
Husserl 's "formalizable salva veritate" criterion of an-
alyticity is the classical conception. Different sets of 
valid sentential schemata correspond to different sen-
tential logics. The question is which set we wish to 
consider the analytic sentential schemata, and which 
logic the sententiallogic of formal ontology. Ifwe in-
sist upon the theorems of classical logic as the logic of 
formal ontology, then we are committed to the classical 
conception ofvalidity, and the distinction between con-
tingency and necessity among truths that characterize 
· some but not ali (material) regions remains otiose. But 
there is historical precedent for rejecting the classical 
conception of validity. 
Where "-." is negation, "v" is disjunction, and ":J" 
is implication, the schemata "-.-.p :J p," "(-.p v q) :J 
(p :J q)," and "(p :J q) v (q :J p)" are (controversially) 
valid in the classical sense. Intuitionists ( e.g., Luitzen 

FORMAL AND MATERIAL ONTOLOGY 
241 
E. Brouwer [1881-1967]) have argued that the first, 
and modallogicians ( e.g., Hugh MacColl [ 1837-1909] 
and C. 1. Lewis [ 1883-1964]) that the second and third 
ofthese schemata should not be valid, and the fact that 
they are is evidence of a defect in the classical concept 
of validity. The Husserlian distinctions between the 
synthetic and analytic a priori, and between the lan-
guages of material and formal ontology can be drawn 
in terms ofnonclassical notions ofvalidity. 
John Lemmon has suggested that the necessity op-
erator ofthe Lewis system S4 may be interpreted as "it 
is informally provable in mathematics that," while the 
necessity operator of S5 means "it is analytically the 
case that." Given Kant's identification ofmathematical 
necessity as synthetic, Lemmon suggests a distinction 
between synthetic and analytic necessity. While S5 ne-
cessity might be taken as Husserl 's analytic necessity, 
Husserl maintains that material regions are wholes in 
the pregnant sen.~e. For that reason, his concept of 
synthetic necessity is better expressed by the neces-
sity operator of the system S4.3 studied by Michael 
Dummett and Lemmon. S4.3 and S5 could be consid-
ered inference systems for the sentential components 
of the languages of material and formal ontology (re-
spectively). The unavailability of such non-classical 
notions of ( e.g., S4.3- vs. S5-) validity at the time 
Husserl wrote accounts for his own difficulty in for-
mulating the distinction between material and formal 
ontology. 
Husserl's thought was informed more by the 
(Boolean) logic of sentences than the (Fregean) logic 
of predicates. But the languages of formal and mate-
rial ontology must certainly have at least a first-order 
predicate logic. The semantics and inference systems 
of moda! predicate logic ( e.g., whether the Barcan For-
mula should or should not be valid) are matters of 
dispute. Such semantic issues of moda! predicate logic 
are directly relevant to the question rai sed by Husserl 's 
conception offonnal and material ontology: what pre-
cisely are the lexicon, formation rules, and differences 
between the inference rules ofthe languages of formal 
and material ontology? Until this question is answered, 
Husserl's distinction between formal and material on-
tology remains more a philosophical puzzle than a di-
vision of philosophicallabor. 
Husserl's preferences regarding the syntax and se-
mantics ofthe languages of formal and material ontol-
ogy derive ultimately from his Aristotelian ontology 
of dependent and independent individuals and univer-
sals. Nominalists ha ve expressed different preferences 
regarding the languages in which they do ontology. We 
are confronted by arguments deriving from and rely-
ing upon divergent metaphysical perspectives. Husserl 
was right that formal ontology is simply logic; the is-
sues of formal ontology are ali (if only) those of the 
philosophy of logic.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
MICHEL FOUCAULT 
From the publication of 
Folie et deraison in 1961 to his death in 1984 Foucault 
was a central figure in FRANCE. His writings address not 
only the main philosophical movements in 20th cen-
tury Europe, but aJso PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY, HISTORY, 
MEDICINE, criminoJogy, LITERATURE, and POLITIC AL THE-
ORY. His theorizing intersects with while distancing 
itself from phenomenology, STRUCTURALISM, and the 
history of concepts, and hence does not fit squarely in 
any of these philosophical camps. Like others writing 
in French philosophy of science (.IEAN CAVAILLES, Gas-
ton Bachelard [ 1884-1962], Georges Canguilhem), his 
writings and interviews reveal an extraordinary empha-
sis upon methodological protocols and, in general, the 
problem ofthe nature ofREASO:-.J. Foucault's philosoph-
ical development is fraught with ruptures and disconti-
nuities as new self-interpretations regularly reorientcd 
the directions of his inquiry. 
Between 1945, when, at the age ofninetcen, he stud-
ied with Jean Hyppolite, and 1969, when he ascended to 
his self-named Chair ofHistory ofSystems ofThought 
at the College de France, Foucault received degrees 
in both philosophy and psychology and taught exten-
sively across Europe. He published his first four main 
works in this period- Folie et deraison (Madness 
and civilization, 1961 ), Maladie mentale et psycholo-
gie (Mental illness and psychology, 1962), Naissance 
de la clinique (Birth ofthe clinic, 1963), and Les mots 
et les choses (The order ofthings, 1966 ). Each is a spe-
cific, detailed analysis of the discursive practices sur-
rounding the production of knowledge in PSYCHIATRY, 
clinica! psychology, medici ne, and the HUMAN SCIENCES, 
respectively. The fifth major work, L 'archeologie du 
savoir (Archaeology of knowledge, 1969), appeared 
the same year that Foucault took the position at the 
Col lege de France. In it he retrospectively reconstructs 
and makes explicit the "archaeological" procedure of 
the first four books. From 1969 until his death Foucault 
became more internationally politically active. His last 
four books -
Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la 
prison (Discipline and punish, 1975) and Histoire de 
la sexualite, 1 ( 1978),1/ ( 1984 ), Ili (1984 )- reflect his 
interes! in supplementing archaeological analysis with 
genealogical analysis. In addition to these works Fou-
cault has published numerous essays and interviews 
that are crucial for understanding his project. 
Before Foucault began writing his major "archae-
ologies," he was concerned with providing a historical 
analysis of phenomcnology and existential psychol-
ogy. This was the project ofhis first two publications: 
the introduction to LUDWIG 81NSWANCiER 's Le re ve et 
1 'existence (Dream and existence, 1955), and Maladie 
mentale et personnalite ( 1954). In the Binswanger in-
troduction he argues that the fact that dreams provide 
crucial insights for understanding human existence ul-
timately leads to a new understanding ofboth the sym-
bolic structure ofmeaning and the relationship between 
dreams, the imagination, and images. The consequence 
is a criticism of both Freudian and phenomenological 
theories of MEANING. 
Foucault first criticizes the dream interpretation of 
PSYCHOANAL YSIS for reduc ing thc meaning of the sym-
bolic images to purely semantic meaning. In doing 
so, the Freudian account necessarily misses the mean-
ing contained in the linguistically structured relations 
among the symbols. The root of this error is the con-
flation of symhols and indices. Indices (for example, 
animal tracks) signify only for a person who is inter-
preting them as pointing toward their referent, whereas 
symbols (for example, words) signify independently of 
. any interpretation, any consciousness, and any objec-
tive referent. Consequently, symbols are expressive of 
the subject in ways indices are not. To the extent that 
the Freudian account is concerned only with the objec-
tive reference ofthe dream image and assumes that the 
analysis exhausts the meaning of the image, it misses 
the full expressive content of the dream. 
In contrast, Foucault argues that the phenomenology 
of EDMUND HUSSERL- since it both recognizes the dis-
tinction between indication and symbol and recognizes 
the fu li expressive function ofsymbols- gives a more 
adequate account ofthe meaning of dreams. Neverthe-
less, simply being able to account for the constitu-
tion and manifestation of meaning is insufficient for 
grounding the psychoanalytical practice of interpret-
ing the existential character of dreams. Specifically, 
it must be possible for the psychoanalyst to under-
stand the meaning ofthe expressive act in its own con-
text. According to Foucault, phenomenology, essen-
tially tied to the Cartesian reductions of knowledge to 
self-knowledge and thus inescapably solipsistic, can-
not account for the event of understanding. That is to 
say, he thinks that phenomenology can provide an ad-
equate account of the manifestation of meaning, "but

it has given no one the possibility of understanding 
language." 
Throughout "Dream and Existence" Foucault de-
murs from providing a more comprehensive critique 
of phenomenology, but its outline is clear. He thinks 
that Binswanger's existential-psychological prioritiz-
ing of dreams is justified and completed in the twofold 
operation offirst prioritizing the IMAGINATION over PER-
CEPTION, and then founding the imagination in dreams. 
In Husserl's account ofphenomenology, the imagina-
tion (Phantasie) in the process of the EIDETIC METHOD 
makes possible the intuition of the essence of the ob-
ject ofperception. Foucault takes this to mean that the 
essence seen in the image is always hypothetical, and 
as a result, any knowledge based on the image can 
never escape the ambiguity implicit in the imaginative 
act. We can only regain the rigorous goals of pheno-
menology ifwe recognize that dreams, rather than be-
ing an effect of the imagination, are the source of the 
imagination. Moreover, since dreams have a symbolic 
structure of their own, by analyzing dreams we ana-
lyze the fundamental structures of perception. Once 
Foucault has paired ontology with an investigation of 
the imagination through dream analysis, however, he 
has eliminated tout court the possibility ofthe adequate 
description of the contents of consciousness. The im-
age, created in reflection and recollection, does not 
present us with truth; rather, it isolates us from the ex-
pressive authenticity of the structured associations of 
the imagination. For truth we must turn to poetry, art, 
and the imaginative play ofthe id. 
In this regard, Foucault's first publication on Bin-
swanger provides the seeds of his future arguments 
against phenomenology, structuralism, and HERMENEU-
ncs, which together comprise the complexity of his 
critica! project. Specifically, Foucault argues that (1) 
hermeneutics will miss the fact that "the imaginary 
world has its own laws, its specific structures"; (2) 
structuralism will miss the fact that the materiality 
of linguistic practices are themselves constitutive of 
meaning; and (3) phenomenologywill always seek but 
never be adequate to what exceeds it, and consequently 
will fail in its foundationalist ends. In Les mots et les 
choses the critique of phenomenology becomes more 
explicit, although first we must see the way Foucault 
narrates his early reflections on existential psychology 
historically. In Folie et deraison Foucault reconsiders 
mental illness not as a property of a subject, but as a 
historically constructed category. Likewise, he replaces 
the imagination, in its function of providing access to 
truths other than those accessible to reason, with the 
discourses ofthe insane. In a move that resembles Niet-
zsche 's derivation of good/evil out of the ressentiment 
of"slave mentality," Foucault argues that the category 
of madness arose as a means for justifying the elite 
status of REASON and rationality. Madness, through a 
series of conceptual shifts, replaced leprosy as the dis-
ease of the outcast, which in turn elevated reason to 
the highest sign of health. The representation of the 
mad as divinely inspired gave way in the Renaissance 
to the physical marginalization of the insane in soci-
ety. Foucault takes the "ship of fools" to be the best 
example ofthe Renaissance attitudes towards insanity 
-
excluded from, but still in periodic contact with, 
city life. The most dramatic shift occurred in the "clas-
sical period" of the 17th century. In France not only 
the mad, but the poor, sick, and criminal were confined 
under the guidance ofthe H6pital General. Here arose 
for the first time the social category ofthe "unreason-
able" and the criminalization that accompanied it. The 
mad were no longer discussed directly, but only medi-
ately through discussion ofthe tools of confinement. In 
the 18th century, under the auspices of humanitarian-
ism, the insane were freed from the prisons and moved 
to asylums. The mad then became objects of medical 
study- not in order to libera te the mad from madness, 
but, or so Foucault argues, to control them in more sub-
tie and decisive ways. As pure objects wholly excluded 
from the "norm," the mad were left to silence, which 
is to say that reason has finally excluded its other. Fou-
cault claims that the only voice that remains in touch 
with the truths of unreason is the voice heard in the 
"lightning flashes" of some (presumably mad) artists. 
In Folie et deraison we can witness two more pieces 
of Foucault's complex thought. First, he has turned 
away from the subject as the locus of meaning, ap-
pealing instead to historically constituted categories 
of persons. Second, he interlaces concerns about the 
way societies "constitute" madness through their insti-
tutional practices and their discursive practices. In this 
conjunction, Foucault introduces the structuring con-
nections between the nondiscursive (power) and the 
discursive (knowledge) forms that will be a focus of 
his work in the 1970s. 

244 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Foucault, in 
effect, historicizes structuralism 
through the use of discontinuous epistemes. The 
episteme of a particular period is identified as the struc-
ture underlying the discursive practices that regulate 
the determination of knowledge. The concept of an 
episteme allows Foucault to investigate the structures 
that determine the linguistic practices of a historical 
period without granting the structures atemporal, acul-
tura) status. In Les mots et les choses he argues that 
there have been three significant periods in Western 
cui ture -
the Renaissance, the classical age, and the 
modern age -
each with its own episteme. The his-
torical division is very similar to the one in Folie et 
deraison, although rather than being concerned with 
the historical constitution ofthe category ofthe insane, 
here Foucault is concerned with the historical produc-
tion ofthe HUMAN sciENCES and the knowledge acquired 
through them. Also Iike Folie et deraison, Foucault in-
vestigates the Renaissance age merely as a precursor 
to the classical age, spending most of his time on the 
classical age itself and how it was transformed into the 
modern age. 
The clue to understanding the episteme of a partic-
ular period !ies in the understanding of the ordering 
connections between things in the world, between lan-
guage and the world, and within language itself. In 
the Renaissance age ali three domains were structured 
along lines of analogous resemblance. In the classical 
age, however, mere analogous resemblance was con-
sidered an occasion for equivocation and error. Conse-
quently, there was a transformation to structuring the 
ordering relations along li nes of identity and difference 
among representations and the objects of representa-
tions. Ideally, the shift to representation would allow 
for maximally precise descriptions free from ali ambi-
guity of objects and their relations. With the emphasis 
on precision came the ultimate goal of arranging ali 
knowledge univocally and methodically into tables. 
What was in principle absent from analysis in the clas-
sical schema ofrepresentation was the subject and the 
act ofrepresentation itself. In this sense Foucault can 
claim that "man" did not yet exist in the classical age. 
It is only when the dogmatism of the connection be-
tween language and things is evidenced that the sub-
ject, in its socio-cultural finitude, becomes the center 
of attention. According to Foucault, "man" appears on 
the conceptual scene for the first time in the paradox-
ical and ultimately antinomous position of being the 
subject and the object of knowledge. The episteme of 
the modern age is characterized by the attempt to over-
come the epistemic limitations of the finite subject by 
making finitude the very condition for the possibil-
ity ofknowledge. KANT, FICHTE, and HEGEL ali theorize 
within this "analytic of finitude," setting the stage for 
Husserl 's, MARTIN HEIDEGGER 's, and MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY's versions of phenomenology. 
The analytic of finitude manifests itself in three 
different ways, the first of which is the account of 
the subject as an "empirico-transcendental doublet." 
The empirica! conditions ofthe subject have been pre-
sented as the condition of the possibility of the sub-
ject's knowledge. This reduction of the transcendental 
to the empirica! takes one of two forms. The "posi-
tivists," e.g., Comte, explain knowledge in terms of 
the processes of the body that operate in the produc-
tion of knowledge; the "eschatologists," e.g., Marx, 
explain knowledge in terms of the historical, cultural, 
or economic processes that operate in the production of 
knowledge. Foucault's Kantian analogy is that the pos-
itivists perform the transcendental aesthetic, while the 
eschatological philosophers perform the transcenden-
tal dialectic. Each, however, uncritically accepts the 
givenness of initial knowledge of the body or of so-
ciety, which is used, in turn, to ground the account of 
knowledge. Thus they both fali into uncritical circular-
ity. Consequently- and here Foucault has Merleau-
Ponty clearly in mind- philosophers attempt to pre-
serve both the empirica! and the transcendental charac-
ter of"man" through introducing a mediating analysis 
of "actual experience." Foucault claims that, nonethe-
less, these attempts ultimately collapse back into ei-
ther positivistic or eschatological attempts to ground 
the transcendental on the empirica!. 
If philosophers in the modern age are concerned 
about preserving the account of"man" as both empiri-
ca! and transcendental, then, Foucault argues, they will 
have to deny the transparency ofthe cogito. Instead of 
epistemic immediacy and self-certainty, philosophers 
must make recourse to description, repetition, and ver-
ification in an infinite task of making present what is 
absent to the cogito- of thinking the unthought. The 
relation between the cogito and the unthought is the 
second manifestation of the analytic of finitude. Fou-
cault argues that Husserl has provided such a contra-

MICHEL FOUCAULT 
245 
dictory mixture of Kant and Hume. On the one hand, 
Husserl restricts meaning to that which stands in rela-
tion to the EGO, and yet, on the other hand, Husserl ac-
knowledges the functioning ofthe ego's pre-reflective 
relationship to the world in the constitution of meaning. 
Consequently, on this view Husserl becomes trapped 
between his rigorously Cartesian concerns for apodic-
ticity and his problematically Aristotelian account of 
the pre-reflective conditions of knowledge. This crit-
icism of phenomenology's inability to reconcile the 
cogito and the unthought continues the line of argu-
ment inaugurated in the Binswanger "Introduction" 
and Folie et deraison. 
The third manifestation of the analytic of finitude 
appears in the relation between "man" and "his" his-
torical origins. In the classical age the origin ofknowl-
edge !ies in the purely transparent initial event of the 
representation of an object by a word. Because of the 
historicity of the modern subject- divided between 
empirica! opacity and transcendental constitution-
such a transparent origin is no Ion ger accessible. "Man" 
is always already in the linguistically structured world. 
Rather than this resulting in the failure of historical 
objectivity, the subject's historicity becomes itself the 
condition for the possibility of history. In this third 
doublet Foucault implicitly criticizes Heidegger for 
complicating the divided origins of meaning in DA-
SEIN. Indeed, Heidegger places the origins at both the 
nearest point and the farthest point from "man." It is 
nearest in that the origin is always "proximally and for 
the most part'' present to Dasein as the condition of 
the possibility for its meaning-constitution. This prox-
imity, however, makes it ultimately ungraspable, and 
thus it remains interminably farthest from Dasein. The 
origin retreats and returns in the hermeneutica! rela-
tion ofDasein to its world. Dasein's attempt to recover 
its unity once more in its return to its origins becomes 
Heidegger's "infinite task," a task that must end in fail-
ure. The problem of death traces the failure of Dasein 
to comprehend itself in its totality and hence the fail-
ure of a Dasein-analytic to provide the ground for an 
adequately clarified meaning of Being. Consequently, 
the fact that its origins are always absent from itselfin-
sures that Dasein will never become contemporaneous 
with itself, thus condemning Dasein to the conceptual 
impoverishment of its finitude. 
The irremovable presence of the three doublets at-
tests to the contradictory project ofthe analytic offini-
tude in the modern age. The empirica! and the transcen-
dental will never converge, the unthought will never 
fully appear to the cogito, and the origins of mean-
ing will always retreat from conceptualization. Against 
the antinomous influences ofthe modern age Foucault 
turns to Nietzsche. The only alternative to the "doubly 
dogmatic anthropomorphic sleep" is the end of"man" 
as a conceptual foundation -
the final Copernican 
revolution. This final dislocation of "man" is not to 
be mourned, but affirmed as the beginning of a new 
episteme, heralded by Foucault as the return of the 
possibility of thinking. 
In L 'archeologie du savoir Foucault most directly 
confronts the methodological protocols of his early 
project. Unlike the structuralists who had "platonized" 
the structures of discursive regularity, Foucault real-
ized that ifhis analyses ofLANGUAGE and language-like 
entities in terms of their formal properties were to be 
successfully carried out, epistemes must be analyzed as 
unities of discursive formation. The arguments against 
phenomenology in Les mots et les choses function to 
clarify Foucault's theoretical project. In contrast to the 
empirico-transcendental subject, Foucault analyzes the 
parole-langue structure oflanguage, refusing to reduce 
o ne to the other- reduc ing neither semantics to gram-
mar, nor meaning to utterances. In contrast to the cog-
ito and the unthought, Foucault analyzes the discursive 
structures that determine what of the sayable is actu-
ally said. These two projects comprise the practice of 
"archaeology." After 1969- more specifically, after 
his inaugural lecture at the College de France ("The 
Discourse on Language") and his essay "Nietzsche, 
Genealogy, History"- Foucault explicitly added ge-
nealogy to archaeology. 
In contrast to the retreat from and return to origins, 
Foucault's genealogies analyze the contingent and ac-
cidental roots of the discursive practices. The com-
plexity of Foucault's positive project Iies in its aim: 
not to question the transcendental conditions for the 
possibility of discourse, but to grasp the historical de-
terminants of the actuality of discourse. For Foucault, 
only such a project can preserve the rigor of structural 
analysis while avoiding structuralism 's dogmatic re-
ductions. The archaeologist uncovers the hidden forms 
that structure and regulate the discursive practices of a 
period, only for the genealogist to level offthe illusion-

246 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ary depths of the interpretations. The twofold project 
of"revealing" and "leveling" ensures that archaeology 
will never be treated "as a search for the origin, for 
formal a prioris, for founding acts, in short, as a sort 
of historical phenomenology (when on the contrary 
its aim is to free history from the grip of phenomen-
ology)." 
The relation between archaeology and genealogy 
accompanies the interna! relationship between knowl-
edge and power- a relationship at stake in ali of his 
works. It is also the relation of complexity that best 
characterizes Foucault's position. Archaeology with-
out genealogy takes the chance of intimating knowl-
edge without the activity ofpower; genealogy without 
archaeology takes the chance ofintimating power with-
out the production of knowledge. Foucault's position 
must be distinguished precisely in its emphasis upon 
its complexity -
a complexity resistant to ali tran-
scendental recoveries of phenomenology. Beyond ali 
analysis, the antinomies that his analysis has grasped 
strike deep. Beyond neopositivism, his analysis at-
tests to the complication of facts by theories; beyond 
phenomenology his analysis attests to the complication 
of intentiona! description and intensional meaning by 
concepts and extensional relations of power. Beyond 
hermeneutics, it refuses the "grammatical" reduction 
of the present to the past or the fu ture, attesting to the 
complication of explication itself. Neither structures 
nor events, neither "semiology" nor "phenomenology," 
can be reduced or superimposed. 
In the end, Foucault's writings situate themselves 
at the margins ofphenomenality and self-presence, on 
the si de of the "Other" over against such regimes of 
the "Same" -
precisely in articulating the Other in 
their midst. His writings formulate, then, a questioning 
of such self-presence in the process oftelling a history 
of the present. Thus in Foucault's work, phenomen-
ology becomes less dissolved than put into question: 
its semantic reductions become mirrored in conceptual 
and institutional analysis; its transcendental appeal to 
the origin becomes complicated within its own con-
dition of possibility; and finally, its epistemic claims 
to purity become obfuscated within its own motiva-
tions and complicated in the constitutive relations that 
overdetermine knowledge and power.

VVith the exceptions of a discussion 
by Leon Noei (1878-1953) and a long critica! study 
by Victor De1bos ( 1862-1916), there was practically 
no echo of EDMUND HUSSERL 's Logische Untersuchun-
gen ( 1900-1901) in the French-speaking world before 
VVorld VVar 1. After the war and with the dispersion of 
Husserl's early students, the situation changed com-
pletely. JEAN HERING, who had studied at GOttingen, 
was named professor on the faculty of Protestant the-
o1ogy at Strasbourg after the publication of his the-
sis, Phenomenologie et philosophie religieuse ( 1925). 
But above ali there was EMMANUEL LEYINAS, who had 
heard Husserl and MARTIN HEIDEGGER at Freiburg and 
made phenomenology known in France through a 
great synthetic work, La theorie de l'intuition dans la 
phenomenologie de Husserl ( 1930). And it was again 
Levi nas, studying at Strasbourg with Ma uri ce Pradines 
( 1877-1958), who, with Gabrielle Pfeiffer, produced 
in French Husserl 's Meditations cartesiennes ( 1931 ), 
the German original of which was not published un tii 
1950. This work was deve1oped from an introduction 
to transcendental phenomenology presented in lectures 
at the Sorbonne in February 1929. 
The invitation to the Sorbonne clearly shows the 
spread of Husserl's reputation beyond Germany. But 
it is chiefty in the 1930s that the first genuine break-
through occurs, and it is associated with MAX SCHELER 
and Heidegger as well as Husserl. This is undoubtedly 
due to the more and more frequent contacts between 
French philosophers and the University of Freiburg: 
GASTON BERGER, for example, met Husserl there on 
severa! occasions and published his two remarkable 
books, Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl and 
Recherches sur les conditions de la connaissance, in 
247 
1941. The many emigres from Germany, Poland, and 
Russia during the 1930s contributed decisively to the 
acclimation ofphenomenology in France. First of ali, 
there was ALEXANDRE KOYRE, student of Husserl at 
Gottingen, who taught at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes 
Etudes during 1933-39 and published important stud-
ies of HEGEL. The Hegelian background, as will be seen, 
is characteristic ofthe French reception of phenomen-
ology. 
It must also be remembered that Georges Gurvitch 
( 1884-1965) had come from Prague and delivered a 
series of lectures at the Sorbonne in 1928-30 devoted 
to the "current tendencies of German philosophy," 
emphasizing Husserl, Scheler, Heidegger, and NICO-
LAI HARTMANN. These lectures were published in 1930. 
Also to be mentioned is the stay in Paris from 1933 to 
1940 of ARON GURWITSCH, a refuge from Lithuania and 
Germany who had studied with Husserl and with Kurt 
Goldstein ( 1878-1965). He delivered four annual se-
ries of lectures at L'Institut d'Histoire des Sciences of 
the Sorbonne, which were often attended by MAURICE 
MERLEAU-PONTY, and published articles on psychology, 
especially GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY, GoJdstein, and CON-
STITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY. His main work was first 
published in the French translation of Michel Butor as 
Theorie du champ de la conscience (The field of con-
sciousness, 1957), seventeen years after he fled to the 
UNITED STATES in 1940. 
Gurwitsch taught alongwith Eric VVeil ( 1904-1977) 
and a]so PAUL-LOUIS LANDSBERG. Landsberg, a student of 
Scheler, carne to France in 1933, and contributed sub-
stantially to making known his teacher's work, which 
had already begun tobe translated with L 'essence et les 
formes de la sympathie (The essence and forms of sym-
pathy, 1928). Also to be mentioned are the presence in 
France of the Polish psychiatrist EUGENE MINKOWSKI, 
who owed as much to HENRI BERGSON as to Husserl, 
and Bernhard Groethuysen ( 1880-1946 ), student of 
WILHELM DILTHEY and close to GEORG SIMMEL, as well 
as author of lntroduction a la pensee philosophique 
allemande depuis Nietzsche (lntroduction to German 
philosophical thought since Nietzsche, 1927), which 
contained a chapter on Husserl. 
Typical of the climate of exceptional receptivity 
to thought that was increasingly eclipsed in Nazi 
Germany is the annual Recherches Philosophiques,

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Koyre, Henri-Charles Puech, and A. Spaier, with whom 
ALEXANDRE KO.IEVE, HENRI CORBIN, .IEAN WAHL, and Lev-
inas regularly collaborated. The first volume opened 
significantly with an article by Wahl entitled "Vers le 
concret" (Toward the concrete) and concerned with 
Scheler, Heidegger, Hartmann, Husserl, and HEDWIG 
coNRAD-MARTIUS. He published a book under the same 
title in 1932 that was emblematic for an entire philo-
sophical generation, and had published the epoch-
making Le malheur de la conscience dans la philoso-
phie de Hegel (Unhappy consciousness in Hegel 's phi-
losophy, 1929). Wahl 's Hegel, interpreted first of ali 
from the standpoint of the youthful theological writ-
ings, is, so to speak, "existentialized," which is impor-
tant for so-called french EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY. 
Wahl evoked Hegel in his move "Vers le concret": "The 
concrete will never be the philosopher's da turn. He will 
pursue it. It is only in the absence of thinking that the 
concrete can reveal itselfto us. This is what the young 
Hegel sensed, as did many poets. There is a necessary 
dialectic precisely because realism exists. The real is 
the li mit ofthe dialectic; it is its origin; it is its end, its 
explanation, and its destruction." 
Recherches Philosophiques also published impor-
tant translations: Heidegger's "Vom Wesen des Grun-
des" (On the essence of grounds), first published in 
the Festschrift for Husserl, and Corbin's translation of 
Conrad-Martius' "L'existence, la spiritualite, l'âme" 
(Existence, spirituality, soul). ERWIN w. STRAUS pub-
lished there his study of"Le temps vecu" (Lived time), 
Levinas published his "De l'evasion" (On evasion), 
and JEAN-PAUL SARTRE his famous essay on the EGO. Fur-
thermore, beginning with the second volume, a section 
was devoted to reporting on phenomenological work, 
first entrusted to Kojeve, then to Corbin, Wahl, Koyre, 
and Weil. 
It was also in the 1930s that Corbin, who visited 
Germany on severa! occasions and met with Heidegger 
in Freiburg in 1934 and 1936, undertook the transla-
tion into French of what became the first collection of 
Heidegger's writings, Qu 'est-ce que la nu?taphysique? 
(What is metaphysics? 1938), which included the inau-
gural lecture, "Was ist Metaphysik?" ( 1929), extracts 
from Sein und Zei! ( 1927), and the Rome lecture on 
"Holderlin und das Wesen der Dichtung" (Holderlin 
and the essence of poetry, 1936). 
Bifur and Mesures, where Corbin published a trans-
lation ofthe Aesthetica in nuce by Johann G. Hamann 
(1730-1783), also need to be mentioned to complete 
this panorama and establish exactly the ro le ofjournals 
in the movement of ideas from Germany into France 
before World War II, but Recherches Philosophiques 
also indicates in an exemplary fashion the conjunction 
of existentialism or proto-existentialism (greatly influ-
enced by GABRIEL MARCEL) and Hegelianism (Kojeve 
offered his famous lessons on the Phănomenologie 
des Geistes at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes 
from 1933 to 1939), which, together, characterize the 
reception of Husserlian and Heideggerian phenomen-
ology. With En decouvrant 1 'existence avec Husserl 
el Heidegger (Discovering existence with Husserl and 
Heidegger, 1930), Levinas is certainly one of those 
who, knowing the Husserlian enterprise thoroughly, 
confidently recognized from the outset the critica! dis-
tance of the author of Sein und Zeit from that of his 
"master." Then there were the sessions of the Societe 
Thomiste ~ meeting at Juvisy in 1932 around the 
theme of "Phenomenology and Scolasticism" ~ 
that 
Jacques Maritain ( 1882-1973), Etienne Gilson ( 1884-
1978), and Leon Noei participated in. EDITH STEIN her-
self presented Husserl 's philosophical project, indicat-
ing ways in which it might be included in an original 
neo-Thomism. 
Another French reading of Husserl also began in 
the 1930s. It is certainly true to the philosophy of the 
formal sciences in Husserl 's Logische Untersuchun-
gen and Formale und transzendentale Logik ( 1929) 
and emerged with JEAN CAVAILLES and his student 
and friend ALBERT LAUTMAN. Prior to Mer]eau-Ponty, 
Cavailles was Agrege-Repetiteur at the Ecole Nor-
male Superieur from 1928 to 1936, where his influ-
ence was exceptional. The first works of Lautman 
("Essai sur les notions de structure et d'existence 
en mathematics" [ 1935], "Essai sur 1 'unite des sci-
ences mathematiques dans leur developpement actuel" 
[ 1935]) as well as those of Cavailles belong to the his-
tory of the phiJosophy of LOGIC and MATHEMATICS and 
relate to the questions at the beginning and perhaps 
the center of the Husserlian meditation. Cavailles's 
dense, enigmatic, and seminal work, La logique et la 
theorie de la science ( 194 7), was written in prison 
prior to his execution by the Nazis. Also prominent in 
this line was SUZANNE BACHELARD's c]assic La logique 
de Husserl (1957), ANDRE DE MURALT's L 'idee de la 

FRANCE 
phenomenologie ( 1958), and the subsequent work of 
JEAN DESANTI, "Phenomenologie et praxis" ( 1963 ), "Les 
idealites mathematiques" ( 1968), and "La philosophie 
silencieuse" ( 1975). 
The first phase of the reception of phenomenology 
in France can be considered completed, symbolically, 
just before World War II, with the publication in 1939 
of the issue in honor of Husserl of the Revue Interna-
tionale de Philosophie. It contained contributions by 
Berger, Hering, EUGEN FINK, and LUDWIG LANDGREBE, as 
well as Husserl's "Die Frage nach der Ursprung der 
Geometrie als intentional-historisches Problem" (The 
question of the origin of geometry as an intentional-
historical problem), a sketch that would play a leading 
role in subsequent work, from Merleau-Ponty through 
TRAN DUC THAO to JACQUES DERRIDA. Tran Duc Thao 
studied at the Ecole Normale Superieure during the 
war and wrote a thesis on Husserl under the direction 
of Cavai)Jes. father HERMAN LEO VAN BREDA )eft some 
Husserl manuscripts with him and Merleau-Ponty in 
1942 and he made severa) trips to Louvain in 1944. His 
Phenomenologie et materialisme dialectique (1951) 
had a great influence on the intellectual climate of 
the time. He was !ater the Minister of Education in 
Vietnam. Late in the 1930s Sartre published not only 
"La transcendence de 1 'ego," but also L 'imagination 
(1936), Esquisse d 'une theorie des emotions ( 1939), 
and L 'imaginaire ( 1940). It is no less true, however, 
that the creative period of phenomenology in France 
began after the war. 
The importance of journals, collective works, 
and translations must be noted. In 1946 the inde-
fatigable Jean Wahl founded Deucalion -
Cahiers 
Philosophiques, as well as a "College de Philosophie" 
having its own book series, where the collection Le 
choix, le monde, l'existence (Choice, world, existence, 
1948) appeared, containing Levinas's remarkable "Le 
temps et 1 'autre." Later, Phenomenologie-Existence 
(1953) was edited by Revue de Metaphysique et de 
Morale and contained contributions from Birault, Van 
Breda, Gurwitsch, Levinas, Ricreur, and Wahl. Mean-
while, the first issue of Deucalion had brought together 
a study by ALPHONSE DE WAELHENS devoted to Sartre and 
Heidegger, a study by YVONNE PICARD devoted to the 
question ofTIME in Husserl and Heidegger, an analysis 
of the method of reflection by ROLAND CAILLOIS, an es-
say by Levinas, "Il y a," which continued the analyses 
249 
of De l'existence a l'existant (From existence to the 
existent, 1947), and a chapter by Cavailles, "La theorie 
de la science selon Bolzano." 
With PAUL RIC<EUR 's "Husserl et le sens de l'histoire" 
in Revue de Metaphysique et de Moral ( 1949), the post-
war years also began to see more elaborate and better 
documented contributions drawing on the manuscript 
sources available in the Husserl Archives at Louvain, 
which archives also became fully available in Paris be-
ginning in 1958, but had been partly available there 
previously. This type of research was again exempli-
fied by RENE TOULEMONT with L "essence de la societe 
selon Husserl ( 1962). 
1950 is the year of the translation by Ricreur, suc-
cessor to Jean Hyppolite ( 1907-1968) at Strasbourg, 
of Husserl 's Ideen zu ei ner reinen Phiinomenologie 
und phiinomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913). New 
translations of Husserl, including, in 1957, Suzanne 
Bachelard's of Formale und transzendentale Logik, 
have followed almost without interruption since then, 
a quite remarkable series of events in France where 
vast "publication lags" are legendary. Ricreur's trans-
lation appeared in the Gallimard series edited after the 
war by Merleau-Ponty and Sartre in which Maurice de 
Gandillac's translation of Scheler's Der Formalismus 
in der Ethik und die materialen Wertethik ( 191311916) 
had appeared in 1948. And while the Husserl Archives 
at Louvain had been visited since Merleau-Ponty went 
in 1938 and Tran Duc Thao in 1944, a Centre Husserl 
was established in the Iibrary ofthe Sorbonne in 1958, 
moved to the Centre National de la Recherche Sci-
entifique in 1971, and finally to the Ecole Normale 
Superieure in 1986. 
The history ofthe great figures ofFrench phenomen-
ology, even if it is always also marked with a critica) 
distance with respect to Husserl and more recently Hei-
degger, is well known: from Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and 
SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR to Ricoeur and Levinas, and con-
tinued by JACQUES DERRIDA, GERARD GRANEL, JACQUES 
TAMINIAUX, and MICHEL HENRY. 
Even before the vogue ofEXISTENTIALISM, Sartre cer-
tainly played a determin ing ro le in the critica! reception 
ofphenomenology. From his studies in Berlin in 1934 
he gained the substance ofhis essay on the ego, put his 
fin ger on a real difficulty in the evolution of Husserl 's 
thought from the Logische Untersuchungen to Ideen !, 
and anticipated the idea of a subject-less transcenden-

250 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
tai field. Likewise, Sartre composed L 'imagination and 
L 'imaginaire during 1935-36. L 'etre et le neant( 1943), 
characterized as phenomenological "ontology," drew 
upon the analytic of DASEIN ("realite humaine") and 
facticity in Heidegger's Sein und Zeit ( 1927). 
Merleau-Ponty proceeded differently. From his the-
ses of 1942 and 1945, La structure du comportement 
and Phenomenologie de la perception, un tii the last and 
unfinished works, Le visible et 1 'invisible ( 1964) and 
La prose du monde ( 1969), he never stopped deepening 
Husserl's thought by beginning with its problems: the 
other, the thing, body and ftesh, space, and the brute 
or savage world of pre-reftective and pre-predicative 
experience. 
Paul Ricreur's place is equally distinctive within 
the general framework of French phenomenology. 
Through his translations and penetrating studies, he 
has been more than anybody else "at school in pheno-
menology"-to use the tit le of o ne ofhis collections, A 
1 'ecole de la phenomenologie (1986). Against fashions 
and passing tastes, he has kept the formati ve discipline 
of Husserlian distinctions alive. But he is also the one 
who was most involved in the hermeneutica! turn that 
strongly marked !ater French phenomenology. 
Quite different is the critica! appropriation of a 
Michel Henry, who, through his continuing meditation 
on affectivity and the originary relation to self in touch-
ing, has brought the thematics of the metaphysics of 
life forcefully into the framework of a radical critique 
of INTENTIONALITY and worJdJy exteriority. 
Ethical exteriority, transcendence -
these are the 
guiding thoughts ofEmmanuel Levinas, whose style of 
appropriation of Husserl (and Heidegger) is again very 
different, even though it is, as in the case of Michel 
Henry and, in a way, Ricreur, focused on that which is 
beyond representation and objectivation in Husserl. 
The reading of Husserl in the early work of Jacques 
Derrida is radically critica! even if it is essentially im-
manent and, following Heidegger, concerned to extract 
everything that relates phenomenology to the "meta-
physics of presence" in Husserl 's project and its con-
crete execution. 
Overall, what deserves emphasis is the distinctive 
vitality of this continuing phenomenological inspira-
tion within French thought -
witness, among other 
signs, the recent creation ofthree new phenomenologi-
cal journals: Etudes Phenomenologiques, founded by 
JACQUES TAMINIAUX in 1985; Epokhe, founded by MARC 
RICHIR, PATRICE LORAUX, and ROBERT LEGROS, which has 
published annual thematic issues since 1990; and even 
more recently, the phenomenological journal Alter, 
edited by NATHALIE DEPRAZ. 
Such a vitality rests on a continuous tradition of 
historical and critica! studies: from Suzanne Bachelard 
to JEAN-LUC MARION and DIDIER FRANCK, passing to 
RENE SCHERER, ARION KELKEL, DENISE SOUCHE-DAGUES, 
and Granel. This tradition has often been attacked or 
discounted at times when other tendencies, such as 
MARXISM and STRUCTURALISM, have occupied the fore-
ground. But it is undoubtedly also useful to note that 
for each of those who attack Husserlian phenomen-
ology for its metaphysical presuppositions, be it, for 
example, MICHEL FOUCAULT, Gilles Deleuze, or Claude 
Levi-Strauss, there were to be found responses from 
those who, coming from Husserl or Heidegger, have 
never claimed to develop any sort of orthodoxy, but 
rather to explore al! the possibilities of dissidence and 
interna] superabundance. 
To close, Jet us remark upon severa! domains in 
which the more or less diffuse inftuence of phenomen-
ology is particularly strong. There are of course the 
areas of FEMINISM, FILM, and LAW, but those of LITER-
ATURE and PSYCHIATRY are especially remarkable. The 
tradition ofliterary criticism linked with the University 
of Geneva is such that one can speak of the "Geneva 
school." There were fundamental phenomenological 
motifs in this tradition from the beginning, above ali 
that ofthe description oflived experience, which Gas-
ton Bachelard (1901-1957) called "material pheno-
menology," e.g., the poetics of space and the poetics 
of dreams. The princip1e representatives of this tradi-
tion are MARCEL RAYMOND, ALBERT BEGUIN, JEAN ROUSSET, 
JEAN STAROBINSKI, and most recentJy, HENRI MALDINEY 
and JACQUES GARELLI. The works of MIKEL DUFRENNE, 
especially Phenomenologie de 1 'experience esthetique 
( 1953 ), accelerated this line of inquiry. 
PhenomenoJogicaJ

were welcomed early to France, notably thanks to the 
already mentioned work of Minkowski and !ater HENRI 
EY. After the war, LUDWIG BINSWANGER, MEDARD BOSS, 
and, more recently, HUBERTUS TELLENBACH were trans-
lated. A veri table French tradition of phenomenologi-
cal psychiatry has developed around GEORGES LANTERI-
LAURA, who wrote La psychiatrie phenomenologique. 

GOTTLOB FREGE

Fondements philosophiques (1963); PIERRE FEDIDA and 
JACQUES scHOTTE, editors of the collection Psychiatrie 
et existence (1989); and above ali, ARTHUR TATOSSIAN, 
author of a remarkable Phenomenologie des psychoses 
( 1979). Henri Ma1diney has equally contributed sub-
stantially to this movement, as is attested by his recent 
collection, Penser l 'homme et la .folie, a la lumiere de 
l 'analyse existentielle et de l 'analyse de destin (Think-
ing the human being and madness in light of existential 
ana1ysis and the analysis of destiny, 1991 ). 
The quite extraordinary permanence of the 
sources ofphenomeno1ogical inspiration within French 
thought during more than fifty years shows no signs of 
fading. Yet the whole deve1opment, still at once free, 
diversified, and critica!, of the phenomenological ap-
proach could paradoxically be the victim of its own 
success: it is probably a phenomenon ofthis kind that 
DOMINIQUE JANICAUD attempted to characterize and de-
nounce in his pamphlet Le tournant theologique de 
la phenomenologiefranr;aise (The theological turn of 
French phenomenology, 1991 ). If it is true that pheno-
menology, having become the dominant thought, al-
ways risks being pressed into the service of thematics 
that are deeply alien to it, be it a question oftheology 
or some other thing, it is nevertheless the case, as Jan-
icaud also writes, that the "facets of phenomenality" 
already contain such other unexplored possibilities. 
GOTTLOB FREGE 
JEAN-FRAN<;:OIS COURTINE 
Ecole Normale Superieur 
(translated by Lester Embree) 
Frege was born in 1848, 
eleven years before EDMUND HUSSERL, and died in 1925, 
thirteen years before Husserl. The two men never met, 
but deve1oped a c1ose intellectual contact through read-
ing each other 's works and through a series of letters 
exchanged between 1891 (when Husserl was in Halle) 
and 1906 (when Husserl was in Gottingen). In 1891, 
Husserl sent Frege copies ofhis Philosophie der Arith-
metik, his "Der Folgerungscalcul und die Inhaltslogik," 
and his review of Schroder's Vorlesungen iiber die 
Algebra der Logik -
ali published in that year. In 
1906, Husserl sent Frege his "Bericht iiber deutsche 
Schriften zu Logik in den Jahren 1895-99." In return, 
Frege sent Husserl copies ofhis Begriffsschrift ( 1879), 
"Uber formale Theorien der Arithmetik" (1886), and 
"Uber den Zweck der Begriffsschrift" ( 1883). Husserl 
also received offprints of "Funktion und Begriff' 
( 1891 ), "Anwendungen der Begriffsschrift" (1879), 
"Uber die wissenschaftliche Berechtigung einer Be-
griffsschrift" (1882), Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik 
( 1884 ), "Uber Sinn und Bedeutung" (1892), "Uber 
Begriff und Gegenstand" ( 1892), Review of George 
Cantor's "Zur Lehre vom Transfiniten" (1892), and 
Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (1893 ). Husserl also re-
ceived a copy of Frege's review of his Philosophie 
der Arithmetik (1894). Husserl's markings and notes 
on these materials show that he intensively worked 
through Frege 's writings. He also seems to ha ve closely 
studied the correspondence between Frege and Hilbert 
of the years 1889-90, copies of which he may have 
received from Hilbert. In any case, Frege's rather neg-
ative review of Philosophie der Arithmetik seems to 
have coo1ed offthe relationship. 
Besides the letters he wrote to Husserl, Frege wrote 
nothing else on Husserl save his review ofthe Philoso-
phie der Arithmetik. Husserl devoted a long section in 
the same book to a critica! examination ofFrege's the-
ory ofnumber. In the Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-
1901 ), Husserl writes that he no longer supports the 
critique of Frege's antipsychologistic position that he 
had given earier. Later, referring to Frege's critique of 
his own position, Husserl wrote in a letter to WILLIAM 
RALPH BOYCE GIBSON that Frege's critique had hit the 
nail on the head. In a letter to Scholtz, of February 2, 
1936, Husserl reminisces: "I have never got to know 
G. Frege personally, and do not quite remember what 
occasioned this correspondence. He was known in gen-
eral as a sharp crank, but not very productive either as 
a mathematician oras a philosopher." 
There ha ve been a host of attempts to determine pre-
cisely the exact nature ofFrege's influence on Husserl. 
One thing seems to have been uncontroversial: both of 
them, at very pertinent points, were under a common 
influence- name1y, that of Hermann Lotze (1817-
1881 ), with whom Frege studied in Gottingen, and 
whose influence on himself is explicitly recognized 
by Husserl. It also seems to be the case that Husserl 
did not in any recognizable manner influence Frege's 
thinking. It was at one time widely held that Frege's 
review of Philosophie der Arithmetik led to Husserl's

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
rejection of his own earlier PSYCHOLOGISM. But closer 
attention to what Husserl does in that work and other 
works prior to 1900 ha ve shown that his position there 
was not psychologistic in the sense in which Frege 
took it to be; that Husserl did not completely reject the 
basic position ofthat book; and that his overcoming of 
psychologism and espousal of a theory of ideal MEAN-
ING (which led to the Prolegomena zur reinen Logik 
[ 1900]) carne about independently of Frege's critique, 
though certainly under the influence of Leibniz and 
Lotze. There also seem to ha ve been enormous differ-
ences between Frege's and Husserl's understandings 
of, and attitudes toward, PSYCHOLOGISM -
in spite of 
their common antipathy toward and rejection of that 
doctrine. These differences can be traced towards what 
they respectively understood by "psychology" and by 
"mental." Frege understood the "psychological" tobe 
the same as the "mental" and the latter as being private 
and incommunicable. 
Husserl, although rejecting the empiricistic-
associationistic psychology, entertained the possibility 
of an eidetic PSYCHOLOGY that would yield essential 
structural laws of mental life, and regarded the men-
tal as being intentiona! and the intentiona! as having 
an ideal content. These made it possible for Husserl 
to aim at reestablishing a relationship between the 
mental and the logica!, which he regarded as consis-
tent"with the antipsychologism of the Prolegomena, 
and which eventually led to the development of his 
transcendental phenomenology. Furthermore, although 
both Frege and Husserl unreservedly rejected psychol-
ogism (Husserl in greater detail and with more thor-
oughness), Husserl- even as late as the Formale und 
transzendentale Logik ( 1929)-expresses the concern 
that one did not quite comprehend the deepest nature 
and source of psychologism, and talks of "transcen-
dental psychologism," connecting it with the problem 
of the "mundanization" of the transcendental (which 
eventually becomes the theme of EUGEN FINK 's so-called 
"Sixth Meditation.") 
Aside from these historical questions pertaining to 
the development of Husserl 's thought, the philosophi-
cal questions relevant to the relation between Husserl 
and Frege should center on their conceptions of"sense" 
and "reference," as well as their conceptions of LOGIC, 
LANGUAGE, and MATHEMATICS. Brief remarks will be 
made on these topics here. The elementary points are 
the following: for Frege, sense and reference both be-
long to signs; for Husserl, they belong to intentiona! 
acts (which may be, to begin with, acts ofuttering, or of 
understanding, linguistic signs). For both, sense is dif-
ferent not merely from the reference, but also from the 
mental image (which is private and incommunicable). 
As regards reference, according to both Husserl and 
Frege, names refer to whatever entity they designate, 
and for both, expressions ha ve sense even when there is 
nothing to which they refer (in such cases, for Husserl 
-but not for Frege-there is intended reference). The 
two differ, however, with regard to "concept-words" 
(i.e., predicates) and whole sentences. As for the for-
mer, Frege took concepts to be referents and distin-
guished concepts from the senses of "concept-words" 
(or predicate expressions); Husserl held a more usual 
view that the concepts are senses, while the entities 
that fali under those concepts are the refercnts. As re-
gards whole declarati ve sentences, Husserl again held 
the more usual view, i.e., that their senses are proposi-
tions (not too different from Fregean thoughts, which 
play that role in Frege's theory), and their rcferents are 
states of affairs (Sachlagen). Frege's theory about the 
reference of a declarative sentence is quite unusual: 
for well-argued reasons, he held the view that a sen-
tence refers to its truth value, either the True or the 
False. Thus ali true sentences ha ve the same reference, 
so also ha ve ali false sentences. While this talk of the 
True and the False as being two entities has puzzled 
many, others have been willing to go along with Frege 
in view ofthe economy it effects in providing a seman-
tic for propositional logic, and have suggested that we 
take care not to treat sentences as names. Behind, and 
underlying, these easily noticeable points of similiarity 
and difference between the two, there is the e0mmon 
conviction that senses (propositions, thoughts) must 
be objective- even if not real- entities, not private 
to any mind, communicable and shareable. Rejection 
of psychologism led both sharply to distinguish these 
entities (Husserl called them "ideal" entities) from pri-
vate, mental experiences. But after this distinction is 
made and the identity ofmeanings is secure, there nev-
ertheless arises an unavoidable question: how can real, 
private, mental acts grasp such ideal, objective enti-
ties? In a remarkable posthumously published note, 
Frege considers this to be a mystery. Husserl seems to 
have avoided the problem by not separating the ideal 

FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY 
253 
meanings from the real mental acts in as radical a man-
ner as Frege did. In other words, he recognizes them 
to be ideal contents of real mental acts, and, in accor-
dance with his thesis of INTENTIONALITY, construes the 
mental not as an irreducibly private particular, but as 
a real particular that nevertheless exemplifies ~ 
bet-
ter still, embodies ~ ideal structural moments. The 
ideal is distinguished but not separated from the real. 
Precisely how this strategy helps us understand the 
possibility of grasping meanings cannot be discussed 
here. More recently, Michael Dummett has called it 
into question. Husserl 's position with re gard to this is-
sue can be identified if we keep in mind that unlike 
Frege, Husserl held that meanings qua meanings are 
apprehended only in an act of reflection on them and 
that the original pre-reflective acts, of which they are 
senses, or NOEMATA, are directed toward their respec-
tive refercnts. Taking an act of judging (that S is p) into 
consideration, Husserl held that it is about S (which 
is the object-about-which) and is an assertion of the 
fact that S is p, while the bare thought is apprehended 
through reflection upon the primary act. The sense only 
serves as the medium of the object-directed act. One 
needs also to ask if, on Husserl 's view, the original pre-
reflective act has a transparency allowing it tobe aware 
of its own content even prior to a reflective grasping. 
With regard to the nature oflogic and mathematics, 
Husserl and Frege held quite different views. To put 
it briefly, Frege eschewed an intensionalist conception 
of logic. After having distinguished between the sense 
and the reference of sentences, Frege banished senses 
out ofthe direct concern ofthe logician. Objectivity of 
senses is required in order to secure objectivity oftruth-
values, but once that is guaranteed (and the danger of 
psychological relativism, which identifies "true" with 
"taken tobe true," is set asi de), the logician's concern is 
only with the two truth-values (the True and the False, 
symbolized by "T" and "F" ), which are but references 
of sentences. Husserl's "pure logic" is conceived as a 
logic of meanings, and is therefore intensional. This 
difference also accounts for their different attitudes 
toward the modalities. Frege's logic has no place for 
moda! concepts, while Husserl's is formulated in terms 
of mod al concepts. 
What, then, is the place of the concept of "truth" 
in Husserl's logic? Frege explicitly states that logic is 
concerned with TRUTH. Husserl conceives of logic as 
a stratified structure: it must begin with a pure log-
ica] grammar, then build on that basis a pure logic 
of consequence (which deals with the laws determin-
ing the consistency /inconsistency among propositions 
without introducing the semantic notions of truth and 
falsity), and, finally, culminate in a logic of truth. The 
concept of "truth" has no place in the first two strata; 
only the third lays down the formal conditions oftruth 
and falsity. 
Furthermore, Frege rejected a purely formalist the-
ory of logic, and is widely regarded as the founder 
of "logicism," as distinguished from both formal-
ism and intuitionism. Husserl imbibed a formalist 
understanding of logic from David Hilbert ( 1862-
1943), and sought to combine it with an intuitionistic-
constructivist theory of logica! cognition.

FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY 
Beginning with 
his hermeneutica! breakthrough in 1919, philosophy 
for MARTIN i-IEIDEGGER is phenomenology, understood 
as the pre-theoretical original science of origins, where 
original experience is first the pre-worldly "original 
something" ( Ur-etwas), "life in and for itself," "factic 
Iife," and the "situation-1" before it is called DASEIN 
or "being-here." By 1921, in the context of reinter-
preting Aristotle's basic terms phenomenologically, it 
also becomes clear that such a philosophy is at once

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
always ontology, aiming to explicate any being in its 
sense-of-being, the "principle" out ofwhich any being 
is how it is. As radical and original when it explicates 
the being offactic life itself, philosophy isfundamental 
ontology (prinzipielle Ontologie in October 1922). It 
is from this fundamental ontology of facticity that the 
mundane regional ontologies receive the ground and 
meaning of their problems. In its categoria! concern 
for the fundamental concepts ofthese domains and the 
foundational crises of the sciences addressing these 
material and formal regions, ontologica) philosophy is 
at once LOGIC, a hermeneutica) logic concerned with 
the many ways in which being is said and interpreted 
in and from life itself. As fundamental research, both 
ontology and its logic find their equiprimordial unity 
in a phenomenological HERMENEUTICS offacticity. 
Such research has the task oftaking the concrete in-
terpretations already operative in factic life itself, from 
circumspective concern to inspective regard to the lu-
cid perspicuity of distressed caring, and making them 
categorially transparent in their pre-possession (what 
is the basic sense ofbeing in which life already places 
itself?) and in their pre-conception (in what ways ofad-
dress and articulation does life speak to itself and with 
itself?). Accordingly, philosophy is the explicit actual-
ization of the interpreti ve tendency already operative 
in the basic movements of the life that "in its being 
goes about [geht um = is concerned with] this very 
being." This formula for the self-referential movement 
of Being itself in Sein und Zeit ( 1927) becomes the 
formal indication of the understanding-of-being that 
defines the very being of Dasein. The dominating for-
mal indication of the being of life itself, or Dasein, 
that is to guide the concept formation of such an onto-
logica! logic, develops from a triple-sensed INTENTION-
ALITY (relating, holding, fulfilling senses) in 1919-22 
into being-in-the-world ( 1923), to-be (Zu-sein: 1925), 
ek-sistence ( 1926--27), and transcendence ( 1927-29). 
In introducing ontology as a hermeneutics of fac-
ticity in his lecture course of summer 1923, Heidegger 
praises CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY for having ad-
vanced beyond the exhausted old metaphysics with a 
concept of ontology amenable to research, but notes 
that it has not advanced beyond a theory of objects in 
its FORMAL ANO MATERIAL ONTOLOGIES; remains closed 
to the genesis of their meaning and so to an "object-
less" being that precedes the distinction of subject and 
object; and does not ask from which field of being it 
is to draw the sense of being that deci des and guides 
ali ontologica) problematics. This field is for the first 
time identified in ontologica! fashion as Da-sein, out 
of which and for which philosophy "is." The course 
of summer 1925 continues the critique of a double 
neglect by phenomenologists ofthe question ofthe be-
ing of intentionality and of Being as such. The main 
theme of the course is a phenomenology grounded in 
the question ofBeing, regarding it as the basic question 
ofphenomenology, serving to radicalizing its motto to 
"back to Being itself." More precisely, it is to be an 
"ontoeroteric" phenomenology, articulating the erotic 
question o(Being as such by an exposition ofthe place 
and placing ofthe question in a privileged access to it, 
namely, Dasein, understood in middle-voiced fashion 
as both questioning being and questioned by Being 
and, at first, unquestioning and immersed in pseudo-
questions. 
Sein und Zeit for the first time relates fundamental 
ontology (now Fundamenta/ontologie) to an existen-
tial analytic of Dasein as end to means. To this end, 
a complete ontology of Dasein, which would provide 
the basis for a PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY, is not in 
fact the purpose of the treatise. Only those elements 
of Dasein that serve the purpose of a fundamental 
ontology, namely, the elaboration of the question of 
the sense of Being on the basis of the understanding-
of-being that Dasein itself is, are singled out for ex-
tended analysis. This ontologica) analytic of Dasein 
proceeds to establish that the very being of Dasein is 
TIME (Zeitlichkeit) and that its understanding-of-being 
is accordingly made possible by the Temporality (Tem-
poralităt) of Being itself. Fundamental ontology is, to 
begin with, the analytics of Da sein, but in the end, it be-
comes the more radical analytics ofthe temporality of 
Being itself. The science ofBeing, in distinction from 
the positive sciences, thus becomes a transcendental 
Temporal science, reflecting the ontologica) difference 
between beings and Being itself. Just as the positive sci-
ences project their particular beings onto the regional 
constitution of their being, so does transcendental on-
tology project Being itself onto the Temporality that 
makes it possible, i.e., onto the "horizon of its under-
standability." But overt explication or thematization in 
science, for the sake of conceptual comprehension, is 
called objectification. Just as the particular sciences ob-

FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY 
255 
jectify their entities against the horizon oftheir being, 
so ontology as a science must objectify Being itself 
against the horizon of time. The tacit pre-ontological 
distinction of Being and beings, when it becomes an 
explicitly understood difference, is called the ontolog-
ica! difference. 
In its initial projection, fundamental ontology's ba-
sic question ofthe sense ofbeing itself divides into four 
basic problems of ontologica! phenomenology (sum-
mer 1927), derived from four classical theses ofBeing: 
the ontologica! difference, the basic articulation into 
what-being and way-to-be, the unity of the variety of 
ways-to-be, and the truth of Being. But these may not 
be the only problems. In order tobe open to the revolu-
tion brought about by new problems and so to its own 
inner transformation, fundamental ontology must re-
vert back to its ontic origins in the factical existence of 
Dasein, moreover in its ontic distinction from the fac-
tual extantness of nature. Ontology is always already 
ontically founded, rooted in the original experiences 
of li mit situations that make the question of Being not 
only the most fundamental, but also the most concrete 
of questions. Accordingly, fundamental ontology must 
be supplemented by the metaphysical ontic ofbeings as 
a whole intrinsic to its own founding, by a "metontol-
ogy" ( 1928). Fundamental ontology must turn over into 
a metontology, and endlessly returned to and from its 
ontic origins. The latter would include a metaphysics 
of existence that would treat the "existentiell" ques-
tions of ETHICS. Fundamental ontology and metontol-
ogy together comprise the fu li concept ofmetaphysics. 
Fundamental ontology is a critica! and transcendental 
science. In the destructive retrieve ofthe history of on-
tology that belongs to fundamental ontology, Heideg-
ger singles out KANT as the only one to have glimpsed 
the dimension oftemporality as a way offounding on-
tology. Contrary to the usual epistemological interpre-
tations, Kant's Kritik der reinen Vernunft is for Heideg-
ger itself a fundamental ontology, finding and defining 
a natural disposition for metaphysics in human REASON 
itself, which outlines the "blueprint" and prepares the 
foundation for the metaphysics ( ontology) that belongs 
to human nature. Kant himselfthereby sought to lay the 
ground for any future metaphysics that would count as 
a science, which Heidegger, by shifting the locus from 
human reason in its penchant for asking basic questions 
to human being in its finite transcendence, now seeks 
to repeat. In this Kantian context of the critique of 
classical metaphysics, both general and special, fun-
damental ontology is a self-reflexive metaphysics of 
metaphysics taking us back to its ground in human na-
ture, a metaphysics of Oase in apropos of its innermost 
finitude- God does not ha veto do ontology- where 
the elements of a temporal understanding-of-being are 
found in Kant's transcendental imagination. 
The early Heidegger already admits that the inter-
pretation is forced and violent, and the old Heidegger 
openly confesses that Kant's text provided a convenient 
refuge to advocate a line of questioning entirely foreign 
to Kant's question. The quasi-Kantian effort to estab-
lish a transcendental temporal science ofBeing shatters 
in the attempt to "schematize" the temporal ec-stases of 
Dasein onto the horizons of the Temporality of Being. 
The fact that only the ee-static tense of the Gegen-
wart (present) is schematized on the temporal horizon 
of Praesenz, and that Heidegger never gets around to 
translating the other two Teutonic tenses into the Lati-
nates of praeteritum and .futurum, indicates how far 
this language game was carried before it foundered. A 
!ater text from 1944-45 will conclude that the Kan-
tian language of horizon and transcendence is drawn 
from the experience of objects and their representa-
tion. What lets the horizon be what it is, the openness 
that surrounds us and comes to meet us from this side 
of a horizon and its region, is thereby missed; even 
more missed, as the other side that withdraws from us 
and !ies beyond our control, is the very regioning of 
this openness. If a concept grasps and seizes the things 
that fali in its compass, then even our overt awareness 
of the opening regioning that encompasses us must 
be more preconceptual and precursory in character. Jts 
very withdrawal draws us into a thinking that is more 
rigorous than the conceptual, if it is to be true to the 
matter of thought. 
In the course of winter 1928-29, after a decade 
ofvacillation over this strange "pretheoretical original 
science" so unlike any other science, Heidegger defini-
tively abandons the project of making phenomenologi-
cal philosophy into a strict science, observing that it is 
not a science not out of lack but instead out of excess, 
sin ce it springs from the ever superabundant and ebul-
lient "happening of Oase in" itself. Superlatively a sci-
ence from its abiding inner friendship (philein) with its 
subject matter, "scientific philosophy," like the formula 

256 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
"round ci rele," becomes a misleading and even danger-
ous superfluity. Instead of regarding it in its scientific 
results, as a "grounded totality of true propositions," 
philosophy is best seen in its "under way" character as 
philosophizing, accordingly as an explicit transcend-
ing and letting transcendence happen, repeatedly pos-
ing the Being-question by enacting the transition from 
the pre-conceptual understanding-of- being belonging 
to Oase in to a precursory conceiving of Being, and in 
this way repeatedly actualizing the ontologica! differ-
ence between Being and beings without objectifying 
Being itself. Philosophy in this frenetic transcending 
movement nevertheless continues to function as the 
foundation that enables sciences and their respective 
regional ontologies, and moreover also accounts for 
their periodic revolutions. 
Passing mention of "fundamental ontology" in the 
ensuing years (e.g., 1935-41, 1947, 1949, 1962) is in-
variably in the past tense: while it is crucial to get and 
keep Dasein grounded in the lived question of Being 
that Oase in already is, the word "ontology," as a science 
ofbeings easily confounded with the traditional disci-
plines of metaphysics, has proved to be an obstacle to 
this founding endeavor. Metaphysics as ontology must 
now be more fundamentally grasped and, in this regress 
into its ground, overcome in its onto-theo-logical roots. 
The step back into the ground of metaphysics, which 
only asks about beings, about their beingness, is a leap 
across the abyss-opening differentiation ofbeings and 
Being in order to ask the more fundamental question 
about the truth of archaic Being (Seyn) itself, whose 
first name had been time. This hitherto unknown and 
ungrounded ground of metaphysics, beyond every ef-
fort to produce the doctrina! systems ca !led ontologies, 
and even beyond every "critique" of ontology within 
metaphysics, is now the most worthy of questions. The 
question of the temporal sense of Being, the truth of 
archaic Being, the "topic" (linguistic locus) of Being 
itself, is radically different from the question ofthe be-
ing ofbeings transmitted by the ontologica! tradition. 
Heidegger nevertheless searches for clues to his one 
question in its three equiprimordial aspects-the time, 
truth, and language of Being -
by repeatedly exam-
ining the Greek counterparts of these three aspects: 
the kinetic physis, the unconcealing aletheia, and the 
prepredicatively structured logos ofBeing itself. Aris-
totle, for example, had a glimmer of the old Heideg-
ger's final question concerning the unique language 
proper to Being itself when he noted that being is not 
a genus, and the early Heidegger had responded to the 
challenge phenomenologically by developing more al-
lusive concrete universals of the being of factic life 
by way of ever more subtle "formal indications" ofthe 
dynamic being ofintentionality operative in human ex-
perience, like ek-sistence and transcendence. This rela-
tionallocus for the language of Being is maintained in 
the !ater Heidegger's nuanced indications of the hold 
(Ver-hăltnis), puii (Be-zug), needy usage (Brauch), at-
tentive bondage (Zu-gehăren), and appropriation (Er-
eignis) of Being itself that come with human being's 
understanding-of-being. 
The very radicality of fundamental ontology thus 
dictates that it no longer be called fundamental ontol-
ogy, but that it be re-placed by other guiding names 
and continued from another start: not philosophy but 
thought, not calculative representational thinking but 
sense-directed thinking, the thinking o{ Being ( double 
genitive), a fundamental thinking that is nota specta-
tor's science but a receptive openness that lets its pur-
suit of sense be, that opens onto a ground itself open 
and fathomless, an abyss, clearly nota foundation upon 
which something can be built, but afundamentum con-
cussum. Such a thinking continues tobe concerned with 
"principles" like that ofidentity, difference, and ground 
or "reason," but a principle (Satz) is now tobe located 
more in the leap and movement (Satz) toward one's 
destined ground than in its statement or proposition. 
It seeks not so much to conceive its understanding-of-
being as to indicate and cultivate its self-articulating 
sense of direction, in order to maintain a proximating 
orientation toward the pre-theoretical origin that is the 
single dynamic matter ofthought. 
In its reductive regress back to the matter of Being 
itsel{, in its unendingly circular deepening of the sin-
gular hermeneutica! relationship ofthe understanding-
of-being, in its exposition of limits at which some-
thing begins tobe what it is, fundamental thinking stil! 
bears the traces ofthe old phenomenological approach 
from which it received its initial start. While discarding 
the inappropriate concern with science and research in 
favor of a more fundamental discourse, fundamental 
thinking retains not only many of the means acquired 
from its phenomenological discipline, but especially 
the common end ofthe pursuit ofmeaning (Besinnung).

HANS-GEORG GADAMER 
Gadamer is most 
noted for developing a philosophical hermeneutics on 
the basis of MARTJN HEIDEGGER 's Sein und leit ( 1927). 
Born in Marburg in 1900 and schooled in Breslau, 
Gadamer took his doctorate in philosophy at Mar-
burg in 1922 under the direction of NJCOLAJ HARTMANN 
and Paul Natorp ( 1854-1924). His dissertation (unpub-
lished) was on Plato (Das Wesen der Lust in den pla-
tonischen Dialogen). He spent 1923 in Freiburg, where 
he studied with EDMUND HUSSERL and MARTJN HEIDEGGER. 
In 1924, he returned to Marburg where he studied phi-
losophy with Heidegger and classical philology with 
Paul Friedlander ( 184 7-1923 ). Gadamer successfully 
took the state examinations in philology in 1927, and in 
1928/29 with Heidegger's sponsorship he completed 
his philosophy Habilitationsschrift, Platos dialektis-
che Ethik ( 1931; Plata s Dialectica! Ethics, 1990). His 
orientation in this work is clearly Heideggerian; its sub-
title translates as "Phenomenological interpretations 
relating to the Philebus." He presents his task as the 
attempt phenomenologically to solve the problem of 
pleasure as it is posed by Plato, particularly in that di-
alogue. The work suggests a deep proximity between 
Plato and Aristotle -a proximity with respect to the 
questions of pleasure and the good as well as in re-
gard to the notion of science (episteme), for Gadamer 
argues that Aristotelian episteme is rooted in Platonic 
dialectic, which, in turn, is rooted in dialogue. 
Afterteaching foryears in Marburg, Gadamer's aca-
demic career took him to Leipzig ( 1938-4 7), Frankfurt 
( 194 7-49), and finally Heidelberg, where he was the 
successor of KARL JASPERS in 1949. In conjunction with 
HELMUT KUHN he founded the journal Philosophische 
Rundschau in 1952. He retired from his chair of phi-
losophy in 1968, though he continued to lecture, both in 
Heidelberg and abroad. He began annual semester vis-
its to American universities, especially Boston College, 
which he continued for more than twenty years. Until 
the publication in 1960 of his main work, Wahrheit 
und Methode (Truth and Method, 1975), Gadamer had 
published relatively little-scattered essays, commen-
taries, and introductions that concemed themselves pri-
marily with the texts of Plato and Aristotle as well as 
the work of Herder, WILHELM DJLTHEY, and Heidegger 
and the poetry of Goethe and Holderlin. In Wahrheit 
und Methode he attempts to establish a philosophical 
HERMENEUTJcs, i.e., a general theory of interpretation, 
which is at the same time an ontology. 
The starting point for Gadamer's hermeneutics 
is Heidegger's treatment of understanding (Vers te-
hen) in Sein und leit. There Heidegger describes his 
project of fundamental ontology as phenomenologi-
cal and hermeneutica!. Understanding is always in-
terpretation. Assertion, which Heidegger analyzes as 
the "apophantic as," is founded upon the more pri-
mordial "existential-hermeneutica! 'as'." Understand-
ing accordingly takes place within the hermeneutica! 
circle and can never be presuppositionless. Gadamer 
adopts Heidegger's account of understanding and fol-
lows his lead in turn ing to the philological and theolog-
ical hermeneutica! tradition to find clues for a philo-
sophical account ofhuman experience. The experience 
of reading and understanding a text becomes a model 
for human experience generally; hermeneutica! expe-
rience, Gadamer writes, is universal. The decisive fea-
ture ofthis experience ofthe text is its circularity: any 
part (text) can only be understood in terms ofthe whole 
(context) and the whole is tobe understood by means 
of its parts. 
Gadamer also takes over Heidegger's notion of 
TRUTH as an event that is both revealing and conceal-
ing. Truth, then, is nota matter of ah istorica! subjective 
representation secured by scientific method, but is his-
torically situated and limited. Situations are defined in 
part by the tradition(s) and authorities that ha ve shaped 
them. Inevitably the participants bring prior under-
standings to the situation, i.e., prejudgments. Gadamer, 
accordingly, is sharply critica! of the methodologism 
and scientism that he finds in 19th century philology 
and much of modern philosophy, and he wishes to re-
habilitate notions such as "prejudice," "authority," and 
"tradition"- notions that Enlightenment thought had 
discredited. 
Three central 
and closely 
related 
concepts 
of Gadamer's hermeneutics are the concepts of 
play (Spiel), 
"effective-historical consciousness"

( wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewusstsein ), and the fus ion 
of horizons. "Play" is a metaphor of hermeneutica! 
experience inasmuch as the game has order and struc-
ture and the participants experience the play of the 
game as being taken over by it. "Effective-historical 
consciousness" is "consciousness of the hermeneuti-
ca! situation" -
a task that can never be satisfied. 
In accord with this concept, there is no immediate or 
simply neutra! approach to a work of art or a tradi-
tion, for the work of art affects the situation in which 
we approach it. This is the power of history over fi-
nite consciousness. Later, in response to criticism for 
making "consciousness" a central concept, he insists 
that Bewusst-Sein (being conscious) is more Sein (be-
ing) than Bewusstsein (consciousness). On his account 
the historical situation provides the horizon or context 
for any understanding. Inevitably, historically situated 
understanding is an event of the fusion of horizons. 
Expressed in terms of the reading of a text, this fus ion 
results from the coming together ofthe horizon ( expec-
tations) of reader/interpreter and the horizon provided 
by the text. We bring something to the text, and the 
text makes a claim on us. The logic of READING is the 
logic of question and answer and, so too, the logic of 
experience. The basis for this fusion !ies not in the 
text or the reader, but in the matter under discussion 
(die Sache). Gadamer's notion of die Sache is indebted 
both to Husserl and to HEGEL. He means to have his 
hermeneutica! position cut across the theory/practice 
distinction. The implicit model for the inquirer after 
the truth of some matter is not the ideal, so-called 
"scientific" observer but the active participant in the 
world of affairs who has something at stake in the 
sought-for truth. Thus the referent is not so much an 
object (Gegenstand) as an enterprise in which we are 
involved. Gadamer paraphrases Hegel when he writes 
that "the true method is the doing ofthe thing itself." 
Legal and theological HERMENEUTICS are exemplary 
for Gadamer's hermeneutics inasmuch as understand-
ing is always at the same time application. To under-
stand is to see what must be done or to see the implica-
tions of what has been done. He would deny any fun-
damental distinction ofmeaning and significance. Ap-
plication (or significance) is essential to meaning. Ul-
timately, hermeneutica! experience displays the unity 
oftheory and practice. Gadamer finds a philosophical 
model for the practica! understanding ofhermeneutics 
in Aristotle's notion of practica! wisdom (phronesis). 
Understanding is not only practica!, but linguis-
tic. Gadamer means his philosophical hermeneutics 
not only to develop the notion of understanding in 
Sein und Zeit but to develop and make accessible the 
work of the !ater Heidegger, for whom the themes of 
language and poetry become central. The concluding 
section of Wahrheit und Methode is devoted to the 
theme oflanguage and linguisticality. LANGUAGE is the 
medium of hermeneutica! experience and the horizon 
of hermeneutica! ontology. Gadamer asks us to think 
of languagc not as a barrier to be overcome but an 
enabling bridge. He writes that "Being that can be un-
derstood is language." This does not mean that Being 
is linguistic, but that understanding is. Gadamer thinks 
about the experience of language in relation to aes-
thetic experience. Wahrheit und Methode begins with 
a critique of the subjectification of aesthetics in the 
work of KANT and concludes by asking us to return, not 
to Platonism, but to Plato's understanding of beauty, 
especially in the Phaedrus, where beauty is closely 
related to truth. 
How is Gadamer's work phenomenological? In the 
first place, it is phenomenological in the sense of Hei-
degger's HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY to which it 
is so heavily indebted. But Gadamer's philosophical 
hermeneutics is positively related to Husserl 's coNSTI-
TUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY as well. Gadamer expresses his 
(and Heidegger's) great debt to Husserl's overcoming 
of the priority of epistemology in modern thought, as 
well as its scientism, NATURALISM, and objectivism. He 
appeals to Husserl's account of PERCEPTION in his dis-
cussion ofhistoricism and ofthe RELATIVISM that might 
seem to follow from his notions of situatedness, his-
toricity, and human finitude. Gadamer insists that un-
derstanding is perspectiva!, but at the same time, he ar-
gues that relativism does not follow from this feature of 
human experience. Following Husserl, Gadamcr sug-
gests that the fact that we always have a certain per-
spective does not mitigate against the fact that the per-
spective is a view ofthe thing itself. Most importantly, 
however, he presents his inquiry as a phenomenologi-
cal account ofthe experience ofunderstanding; it is, he 
says in the foreword to the second edition of Wahrheit 
und Methode, "phenomenological in its method." By 
this he means that the book's task is to describe the 
phenomenon of understanding. His concern, he says, 

260 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
is "not what we do or what we ought to do, but what 
happens to us over and above our wanting and do ing." 
Wahrheit und Methode was sharply criticized from 
the perspective of philological hermeneutics by fig-
ures like Emilio Betti (Die Hermeneutik als allge-
meine Methodik der Geisteswissenschafien, 1962) and 
E. D. Hirsch ( Validity in Interpretation, 1967) for not 
providing a sufficient methodological foundation for 
validating interpretation. Jiirgen Habermas has found 
Gadamer's hermeneutics valuable in his attempt to 
fashion a phiJosophy of the HUMAN SCIENCES (Zur 
Logik der Sozialwissenschaften, 1967), while at the 
same time, he criticized Gadamer's hermeneutics for 
being uncritical with respect to tradition. His cri-
tique unleashed a large debate concerning Gadamerian 
hermeneutics and the critique of ideology (Hermeneu-
tik und Jdeologiekritik, 1971 ). More recently there has 
been extensive discussion ofthe relation ofGadamer's 
hermeneutics and French POSTMODERNISM and decon-
struction. The centerpiece of this discussion is the ex-
change between Gadamer and JACQUES DERRIDA in Paris 
in 1981 (Dialogue and Deconstruction, 1989). Central 
to their differences is the way in which they regard 
Nietzsche. For Gadamer, Nietzsche and Derrida adopt 
a hermeneutics of suspicion, while Gadamer calls for 
a hermeneutics of trust. The task of conversation and 
understanding for Gadamer is to tind what the parties 
ha ve in common- the fus ion of horizons. 
After Wahrheit und Methode Gadamer devotes him-
selfprimarily to work on Plata, though he has published 
numerous articles concerning poetry, Hegel, Heideg-
ger, and the clarification ofhis hermeneutics, for which 
"Text und Interpretation" (in Dialogue and Decon-
struction) is particularly important. He makes clear 
that the textual model for hermeneutics does not mean 
that everything is a text. Even things written are not 
necessarily texts. There are texts and non-texts; among 
texts, there are eminent texts and texts that are not em-
inent. For the most part, he is concerned with eminent 
texts, i.e., important literary texts. In this case, he calls 
for the effacement ofthe reader and the disappearance 
of the interpretati an- the reader becomes "ali ear." 
The sign of a good interpretati an is the way it returns 
one to the original text. Strictly speaking, philosophy 
does not provide us with "eminent" texts that ask for 
effacement in this way, but rather invite us to a con ver-
sation in which we need to respond. 
In his !ater work on Plata and Aristotle (most impor-
tantly, Die Idee des Guten zwischen Plata und Aristote-
les, 1978; The !dea o(the Good in Platonic-Aristotelian 
Philosophy, 1986) as well as his numerous essays on 
Heidegger ( many collected in Heideggers Wege, 1983 ), 
Gadamer reiterates his debt to Heidegger, but at the 
same time, he clarifies their disagreements. In par-
ticular, he rejects Heidegger's reading of the history 
of philosophy as a history of the forgetting of Being. 
Most importantly in this regard, he resists Heidegger's 
interpretati an of Plata as a primary agent of this for-
getfulness. Gadamer illuminates Heidegger's project 
and its development by showing us its religious char-
acter and its religious motivation. A consistent theme 
ofGadamer's treatment of Heidegger is the breakdown 
of language (Sprachnot) in the !ater Heidegger. While 
truth for Heidegger is often presented metaphorically 
as a sudden flash of lightning, the mediated charac-
ter of truth is important for Gadamer. In his autobio-
graphical writing he characterizes his own way as that 
between phenomenology and dialectic. "Phenomen-
ology" means Heidegger but also Husserl. "Dialectic" 
means Hegel but, even more significantly, Plata, for 
Gadamer remains truc to the thesis ofhis Hahilitation-
sschrift that the roots of dialectic are in dialogue and 
conversation.

GENERATIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 
Gen-
erative phenomenology is the most concrete dimen-
sion ofphenomenology and was broached initially by 
EDMUND HUSSERL during the last seven years of his 
life ( 1930-3 7). Concisely put, the thing or the "mat-
ter itself' of generative phenomenology is generativ-
i(v ( Generativităt). Generativity is the intersubjective, 
geo-historical, and normative generation of MEANING 
or sense. Generative phenomenology and its matter 
can be discussed in three stages: the distinctiveness of 
generative phenomenology in relation to other dimen-
sions of phenomenology; the phenomena peculiar to 
generative phenomenology; and the place and role of 
generative phenomenology. 
There are three methodological strategies explored 
in Husserlian phenomenology: static, genetic, and gen-
erati ve, the latter being the most encompassing. More-
over, each strategy can have an "ontologica!" and a 
"constitutive" dimension, where the former can pro-
vide a "leading clue" (Leitfaden) to the latter. 
As an inquiry in FORMAL AND MATERIAL ONTOLOGY, 
a static methodology relies on EIDETIC METHOD to at-
tain material essences, essential types, regions, formal 
essences, and so forth. Whereas an ontologica! analy-
sis inquires into what something is, or the being of its 
being, a constitutive analysis investigates the way in 
which something is given, how sense emerges. Thus 
a static methodology can analyze how sense is consti-
tuted through intention and fulfillment in a way that 
holds for ali conscious beings without this constitu-
tive analysis necessarily being a genetic analysis. The 
primary contribution of a static analysis is to identify 
structures (such as intentionality, noesis, NOEMA, sen-
sation, intention, fulfillment, etc.) that provisionally 
serve as cornerstones for "higher level" analyses. 
Whereas a static method is undertaken without 
regard to temporal development, GENETIC PHENOMEN-
OLOGY treats the process of self-temporalization. It be-
gins with the "living present" ofretention, the impres-
sional now, and protention, and ranges to fu li concrete 
monadic individuation or facticity. It does this through 
descriptions of active genesis, the phenomenology of 
(passive) association, and the transformation of pre-
judicative life into active judication. In an ontologica] 
re gard, the region of psychophysical being functions 
as a leading clue to a constitutive analysis. Accord-
ingly, the ontologica! discipline that can guide con-
stitutive analyses is intentiona! psychology. Because 
genetic method is confined to egological temporaliza-
tion between the birth and death of the individual, its 
contribution is limited to contemporaneous individuals 
or synchronic communities where intersubjectivity is 
concerned. The distinctiveness of a generative method-
ology that goes beyond static and genetic methods is al-
ready anticipated at the conclusion ofHusserl's Carte-
sianische Meditationen [ 1931]. Like genetic method, 
it goes beyond a static analysis by examining tem-
porality. Yet it goes beyond a genetic methodology 
by describing phenomena that transcend the strictures 
of monadic facticity. Individual sel(-temporalization 
yields to socio-historical generativity. 
Generative phenomenology is a phenomenology 
of generativity. Generativity is intersubjective, geo-
historical, normatively significant transformation. 
Generativity is not a mere biologica! becoming or 
species repetition because it concerns the generation of 
meaning. The expressions "generativity" and "genera-
tive" appear directly on the heels ofthe Cartesianische 
Meditationen. In addition to the third volume edited un-
der the ti tie, Zur Phănomenologie der Jntersubjektivităt 
[1929-35], the main leading clues for a generatiV'e 
phenomenology are found in severa! A manuscrypts 
(whose general title is "Mundane Phănomenologie"), 
in a majority of B manuscripts (entitled "Die Re-
duktion"), in a broad range of writings from the C 
manuscripts ( assembled under the rubric of "Zeitkon-
stitution als formale Konstitution"), and in numerous 
manuscripts from the E signature (named, "lntersub-
jektive Konstitution"). Except for o ne manuscript from 
circa 1920, these "generative writings" date from the 
early to middle 1930s. Husserl's investigations that

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
treat historicity and intersubjectivity are imbued with 
the themes of"generativity" and the "generative," and 
these terms appear unique to Husserl, not being found, 
for example, in either WILHELM DILTHEY Of MARTIN HEI-
DEGGER. 
For Husserl, ETHNOLOGY or cultural anthropology 
serves as the mundane leading clue to constitutive gen-
erative matters. Ethnology has an advantage over, e.g., 
psychology, because it begins with a communal con-
text that is shaped by tradition (ritual, myth, etc.); in-
tegrates linguistic communication into the make-up of 
intersubjectivity; bears on a social life that is marked 
by spatio-temporal limits; treats individual becoming 
within these geo-historical lifeworlds; and addresses 
lifeworld communities as they transform themselves 
over the generations. 
Rather than merely presupposing the generation of 
the cultural world, a generative phenomenology will 
proceed by inquiring into how its complex network 
of sense is generated. In distinction from Dilthey's 
HERMENEUTIC approach, which addresses structural dif-
ferences occurring over the generations in terms ofthe 
objectifications of life, a generative phenomenology 
inquires into the generation ofthese structures as well 
as the structure of generation. Sincefuture becoming is 
also incorporated into this analysis, phenomenological 
description will take on a normative dimension. 
Generativity can be further explicated in terms of 
primary generative phenomena. These include normal-
ity and abnormality, homeworld and alienworld, and 
intergenerational constitution through appropriation, 
critiquc, and communication. 
Husserl appeals to normality and abnormality be-
cause he wants to provide an account of the con-
stitution of "transcendence" that takes place contex-
tually and over time. His concepts of normality and 
abnormality are accordingly not psychological, thera-
peutic, or medicinal, but rather constitutive; they ha ve 
to do with modes of sense-givenness. He distinguishes 
four modes ofnormality and abnormality: concordance 
(Einstimmigkeit) and discordance ( Unstimmigkeit), op-
timality and non-optimality, typicality and atypicality, 
and familiarity and unfamiliarity. 
Normality and abnormality characterize a lived re-
lation between the individual and environing worlds. 
An experience is normal when it coherently unfolds 
over time, and though suffering infractions or discor-
dances, remains concordant overall. But an experience 
can also be normal if it is optimal, or concretely the 
"best" under certain circumstances. The optimal func-
tions as a norm, and thus as a te/os. Even a discordance 
(abnormality) that breaks a concordant appearance can 
institute a new normal order (and a new teleology), 
rendering the previous one now "abnormal" and is-
suing in competing normalities. When the optimal is 
repeated, becoming itself concordant and achieving 
a certain ideality, the optimal becomes a "type"; in 
this way an object or an experience can be said to 
be "typical." As typical of experience, a normal cx-
perience becomes one we can count on and is thus 
"familiar."Husserl first discusses normality and abnor-
mality in his early lectures on PERCEPTION (found in 
manuscript signature F 1 9 [1904-5/1898]), and does 
not return to them in a concerted manner until he un-
dertakes a genetic research perspective (for example 
in the D manuscripts from 1917-21 entitled "Primor-
diale Konstitution [Urkonstitution]"). Here normality 
and abnormality apply to particular organs or senses 
(usually tactile and visual ones) and to the lived BODY 
(Leib) as a whole. Furthermore, abnormality is almost 
cxclusively characterized as a modification ofnormal-
ity. But in Husserl's generative undertaking, normality 
and abnormality are treated as co-relative terms and go 
beyond the individual lived body. In order to under-
stand how something can count for us as objective, he 
turns to an account oftranscendence within communal 
contexts and provides a constitutive account of these 
very communities, historical traditions, and lifeworlds 
precisely in terms of normality and abnormality. Indi-
viduals can only be described as constitutively normal 
or abnormal by virtue oftheir practices within horizons 
of community and HISTORY, that is, within homeworlds 
and alienworlds. 
Homeworld and Alienworld. The concept of the 
LIFEWORLD as presented in Die Krisis der eu-
ropiiischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale 
Phiinomenologie ( 1936) is only a provisional notion. 
Transcendentally understood, the lifeworld is articu-
lated geo-historically in two modalities as earth-ground 
(Erdboden) and world-horizon (Welthorizont). Within 
a normative register and from a generative perspective, 
Husserl calls the normal lifeworld the "homeworld" 
(Heimwelt) and the abnormal lifeworld the "alien-
world" (Fremdwelt). Homeworld and alienworld are 

GENERATIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 
263 
ways in which generativity is taken up and expressed 
socially, geo-historically, and normatively. 
Husserl 's first mention ofhomeworld occurs nearly 
seven years before the appearance of Heidegger's 
Sein und Zeit (1927). Yet it was not until after 
1930 that homeworld and alienworld are investi-
galed as generative matters. Homeworlds and alien-
worlds are spatio-temporal, normatively significant so-
cial spheres. Homeworlds are connected to this land or 
that place, exhibiting this tradition or sharing that fu-
ture. A home can range anywhere from "mother and 
child" to a politica! and national complex, where the ge-
ological or geographical and historical aspects take on 
greater or lesser ro les. Furthermore, those who are co-
constitutors of a homeworld, past or present- those 
who share values, attitudes, patterns of conduct, etc.-
are called "home comrades" (Heimgenossen). One is a 
home comrade to the extent that he or she participates 
-
in any number of ways- in the re-constitution or 
historical generation ofthe homeworld. 
Alienworlds are those lifeworlds that are not con-
cordant, optimal, typical, or familiar for the practices, 
interests, and beliefs of the home comrades. In other 
words, as a phenomenologist, Husserl cannot simply 
take the perspective of the alien; rather, he must in-
quire into its modes of accessibility or experiencability. 
Thus often these other styles, typicalities, etc., do not 
"make sense" from the perspective of the home; they 
are experienced as non-optimal, atypical, unfamiliar, 
in short, as constitutively abnormal. For a phenomen-
ologist, alienness is "accessible" only in the mode of 
inaccessibility and incomprehensibility. Such an inac-
cessibility is expressed as the generative density of an 
alien historicity and as the uniquely personal "foreign-
ness" ofthe individual. 
In the co-constitution of the homeworld, an alien-
world is simultaneously delimited and constituted as 
alien. But equiprimordially the experience ofthe alien 
is co-constitutive of home, delimiting its sense: from 
the very start there is a becoming alien of the home. 
This means that home and alien are co-relative and co-
founding. Even though Husserl does aspire toward a 
solidarity ofhumanity where "the o ne world" would be 
posited beyond cultural differences, the home is never-
theless not an "original" or "foundational" sphere. Be-
cause generative phenomenology does not begin from 
the primacy of the EGO, but with normatively signifi-
cant lifeworlds that are co-constituted geologically, ge-
ographically, and historically, generative intersubjec-
tivity decisively goes beyond the static, quasi-genetic, 
and foundational Cartesian interpretation explpred in 
the fifth of the Cartesianische Meditationen. In fact, 
generative phenomenology cannot merely be a reflec-
tion on intersubjectivity, but a participation in it. 
When Husserl characterizes constitution from a 
generative perspective, he does not appeal to the static 
animation of hyle by the noetic component of ap-
prehension, nor does he speak of the genetic self-
temporalization of the ego. Generative sense does not 
merely originate from an individual. On the one hand, 
sense stems .from a historical tradition. As a result of 
communal practices that span generations and are ar-
ticulated in a concordant HISTORY, this sense is in some 
measure always already "pregiven." On the other hand, 
where the individual qua home comrade is concerned, 
constitution takes the form of the "appropriation" of 
sense: I make it my own by taking it up. Genera-
tive phenomenology must take into account modes of 
sense-pregivenness and the reconstitution of sense as 
its unique generation- not only for myself, but for 
others: for my home comrades and for individuals who 
are in relation to the home as constituting alienworlds. 
But genera ti ve phenomenology will do this with a di-
rectedness toward the future and the transformation of 
the entire generative framework. 
A genetic method was unable to examine birth 
and death as transcendental occurrences because its 
scope was restricted to an individual life. But because 
generative phenomenology treats modes of sense-
pregivenness and types of appropriation of that sense 
as it develops over the generations, hirth as well as 
death must be integrated into a constitutive framework 
and become problems for phenomenology. 
Appropriation is an explicit relation to others qua 
home comrades of a homeworld, and is implicitly the 
constitution ofthe alien of an alienworld. Husserl does 
not elaborate the mode of encounter of the alienworld 
by the home, but does hint at it both with the term 
"transgression" ( Uberschreitung) and by his charac-
terization of alienness as being given in the mode 
of inaccessibility. From these descriptions one could 
formulate "transgression" positively as the encounter 
of the alien from the perspective of the home where 
the limits of the encounter are left intact. It would 

264 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
have to be distinguished from a relation of "occupa-
tion" (Besetzung) where the limits of the home are 
merely expanded. Because this appropriation can also 
be naive, the constitution of sense and the reconsti-
tution of homeworlds in relation to alienworlds also 
demands "critique," or critica! appropriation ~ 
what 
Husserl called "renewal" in his earlicr phenomenology 
of culture. 
Finally, the generative descriptions of LANGUAGE 
IN HUSSERL, and specifically linguistic communication, 
begin to challenge thc predominance that Einfiihlung or 
empathy had played in his accounts ofthe constitution 
of INTERSUB.IECTIVITY. A homewor]d is fundamentally 
determined by language, writes Husserl ~in partic-
ular by communication and narrative. Empathy alone, 
which requires the bodily presence of the other, could 
never constituie a community with those preced ing or 
succeeding me. Although Husserl does explore how 
communication constitutes a home, he does not ~ 
like 
MAX SCHELER ~ 
dcvelop the contribution that the life 
ofthe EMOTIONs makes to this co-constitution. 
Ontology can provide a leading clue for coNSTITU-
TIVE PHENOMENOLOGY (in this case ethnology or cultural 
anthropology for generativity). But for Husserl static 
(qua constitutive) phenomenology can also serve ini-
tially as a leading clue to genetic phenomenology. This 
order of progression reveals a procedural bias held by 
Husserl, namely, that the "simple" provides the starting 
point for descriptions ofthe "complex." For example, 
Husserl began with the abject at rest and then advanced 
to the abject in motion; he moved from static structures 
of consciousness to the genesis ofthe monad, from self-
tcmporalization to communal historicity. And he did 
not wish to advance "higher" until the "lower" levels 
had been sufficiently clarified phenomenologically. 
Nevertheless, many of Husserl's descriptions took 
him beyond the bounds of his avowcd level of analy-
sis. Ultimately they led him to what he called "gener-
ative phenomena," and led the generations succeeding 
him to formulate this new methodological enterprise 
as generative phenomenology. As is appropriate to a 
generative phenomenology, that project was left to fu-
ture generations. From the perspective of generativity 
and of generative phenomenology there is a necessary 
reinterpretation ofwhat phenomenology means. 
Firs!, the so-called "simple" or "independent," 
which was initially identified with the "concrete," is 
abstract. Now generative historicity, transcendental in-
tersubjectivity (i.e., non-independent phenomena), are 
the most concrete. In relation to generativity, self-
temporalization (regarded previously as absolute), is 
labeled "prior to generation" and thus an "abstract 
historicity." In relation to genetic phenomena, static 
matters are not foundational, but abstractly temporal. 
Rather than genetic method presupposing static anal-
ysis, the static method, Husserl maintains, cannot be 
undertaken without presupposing genesis. By impli-
cation, this means that static and genetic methods are 
only possible through generative observations. Thus 
generativity properly understood encompasses static 
and genetic dimensions. 
Second, the disclosure of generative phenomen-
ology requires that the three methodological strategies 
delineated above have to be described either as a pro-
gressive removal of abstraction (leading from static 
to generative) oras the movement from the concrete 
to the abstract, whereby generative phenomenology 
functions as a leading clue to static phenomenology. 
Accordingly, the results won from the previous inves-
tigations have to be reinterpreted in light of genera-
tivity. Some will be left intact, others will be enriched 
through gencrative insights, still others will have to 
be surpassed or rejected as mere(v provisional or even 
misleading. Perhaps this unflagging process ofmethod-
ological reevaluation helps explain why Husserl char-
acterizes the phenomenologist as a perpetua! beginner, 
and why phenomenology advances only by zigzag. 
Third, the generative phenomenologist describes 
the structure of generativity and the generation of this 
structure expressed as the correlation of homeworld 
and alienworld. Because this structure is generativity 
in generation, the phenomenologist must describe it 
as it is taking place, i.e., while he or she participates 
in its movement. Accordingly, phenomenology itself 
is modified in and through this generation. Instead of 
simply recalling the position of the phenomenologist 
as the disinterested observer, Husserl will insist that 
both phenomenology and the phenomenologist remain 
in this historicity, i.e., within the generative framework 
of a homeworld in relation to alienworlds. And he will 
assert, further, that the transcendental dimension and 
phenomenologizing activities themselves flow into this 
generative movement. Such a recognition of the im-
plicit participatory character of phenomenology shifts 

GENERATIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 
265 
the merely descriptive character of phenomenology 
onto a normative axis as well. Now the phenomen-
ologist is engaged in directing the course of gener-
ativity by taking on responsibility for the generation 
of humanity. The normative character of generative 
descriptions enables Husserl to charge the phenomen-
ologist with such a responsibility and with the ethical 
ro le of "functionary." 
What is the ro le generative phenomenology can play 
in contemporary thought? 
Philosophy. Husserl's articulation of the genera-
tive framework provides us with a means of analyzing 
how the universal aspirations of philosophy are at the 
same time rooted in the uniqueness of a homeworld 
from which philosophy itself emerges- a theme that 
JACQUES DERRIDA, among others, has taken up. It also al-
lows us to grasp the very structure of generative singu-
larities such as "family home," "home-town," "home-
polis" or "home-nation" in their generation. These sin-
gularities are presupposed by any philosophical enter-
prise- even a generative one- that makes universal 
claims. 
Social ontology. Phenomenological description 
of homeworlds and alienworlds, and of their co-
constitutive relation for the gen erati ve framework, ad-
dresses the structures of concrete human communities, 
the meaning of social ties, shared as well as divergent 
interests, and the generative meaning of unique per-
sons, both individual and communal. Accordingly, it 
provides the descriptions necessary for a phenomen-
ology of solidarity and for a philosophy of "limits" 
(see MAX SCHELER, MICHAEL THEUNJSSEN, and BERNHARD 
WALDENFELS). 
Ethical theory. Generative phenomenology pro-
vides a phenomenological account of the ethical de-
mand by describing the experience ofthis demand as it 
is given or pregiven through the encounter with others 
qua home comrades and qua aliens. The "other" is not 
just any "other" but the gendered other, the familiar 
home comrade sharing similar customs, the alien who 
bears an inexhaustible strangeness within the home, the 
insuperable particularity of the alien from the alien-
world, etc. Phenomenologically, this is described as 
experiencable inaccessibility, or what EMMANUEL LEV-
INAS has called "infinity." Such generative descriptions 
are lacking in ethical discourse theory (e.g., Jurgen 
Habermas, Jean-Fran<;ois Lyotard). 
Normality and abnormality. Generative pheno-
menology can COntribute to a PSYCHIATRY, PSYCHOL-
OGY, and SOCIOLOGY of normality and abnormal-
ity (Georges Canguilhem, MICHEL FOUCAULT, Emile 
Durkheim [ 1858-1917]). It does not presuppose the 
normal to be the natural, original, or average, or the 
abnormal to be unnatural or deviant. lnstead, normal-
ity and abnormality are cast as concordance, optimality, 
typicality, and familiarity, enabling generative pheno-
menology to take into account both normality as a lived 
relation developed in socio-historical contexts and ab-
normality as an ability to institute new norms. Gener-
ative phenomenology is in its own way a "genealogy," 
since it accounts for the generation of normative tele-
ologies in experience, and for the way in which norms 
qua norms can be overcome through the institution of 
competing teleologies.

GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY 
One of 
the most important and most baffiing developments 
in EDMUND HUSSERL's philosophical method was the 
expansion between 1917 and 1921 of the tran-
scendental phenomenology of 1deen zu einer reinen 
Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 ( 1913) into a "systematic phenomenology" that 
includes both a "static" and a "genetic" component. 
The overwhelming importance of this difference is 
brought home by the fact that it also frames MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER 's working method in Sein und Zeit ( 1927). 
The key to understanding genetic phenomenology 
is first to clarify its relationship to the project of a tran-
scendental phenomenology as Husserl first framed it in 
1deen1-to set that project in relationship to a reframing 
of the field of transcendental analysis once the results 
of his Cartesian way are seen as provisional and once 
Husserl begins to search for "origins" -
and then to 
understand how his account of eidetic structures is sup-
plemented by a theory oftransformation. The sequence 
of disciplines that forms Husserl's systematic pheno-
menology are also, roughly, stages through which the 
development ofhis systematic phenomenology passed. 
The first discipline, developed in 1deen 1 and 11 
[ 1912-15], attempts to secure a transcendental ground 
for FORMAL ANO MATERIAL ONTOLOGIES. That ground is 
the structure of INTENTIONALITY. Husserl thinks of re-
gional ontologies as phenomenological studies that use 
EIDETIC METHOD to describe the essential structures of a 
given, restricted domain of beings or objects in terms 
of the manner they are presented in experience. He 
sometimes labels his method here "analytic pheno-
menology," but it may be better to call it categoria! 
phenomenology in that its goal is to clarify the ba-
sic categories of beings in terms of certain structural 
invariants that constitute and certain rules that regu-
late the relationship between kinds ofbeings and types 
of experience. Regional ontologies each articulate a 
"part" of the "whole." The clarification of the total-
ity itself requires recourse to what is "foundational" 
to ali regional fields. That discipline is transcendental 
phenomenology proper. But in 1921 Husserl goes on 
to restrict its scope as he describes this grounding dis-
cipline as a "universal phenomenology of the general 
structures of consciousness." Together with categoria! 
phenomenology it forms the core ofwhat he, also dur-
ing this period, labeled "static" phenomenology. 
The task of a static phenomenology is to secure the 
structure (intentionality) that provides the irreducible 
ground to the various regions, which then allows us 
to frame each as a sphere of constitution. The method 
that secures the ground of ali regions in intentionality 
also provides each with its basic form of analysis: since 
the as-structure of appearances is understood in terms 
of the one to or for whom objects and complexes are 
manifest, all intentiona! analysis is "correlational"; in 
accounting for the determinacy of the region in ques-
tion, the relevant type of sense structure (NOEMA) is 
placed in relationship to the type of act (noesis) or 
acts in and through which objects or complexes are 
apprehended or used. 
The transcendental phenomenology of 1deen 1 was 
limited to the immediately intuitable, essential struc-
tures of transcendental subjectivity. Accordingly, the 
transcendental domain was not a field but a "system-
atically self-enclosed infinity of essential properties."

GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY 
267 
The treatment of intentionality as a grounding struc-
ture rather than a field of analysis was fostered by 
his Cartesian formulation of the reduction in Ideen !, 
which created an ontologica! divide between the being 
of the world and the being of subjectivity. As a result 
the ground of the various regions of the world is se-
cured apart from a regressive analysis that would move 
back from their structures to their origins. Instead, we 
are limited to an account that gives us an irreducible, 
necessary, and universal structure apprehended "ali at 
once" in a transcendental reflection, without a clear 
understanding of how it is internally connected to the 
regional ontologies we are attempting to clarify. 
In Ideen J transcendental phenomenology was taken 
to be CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY. But with the de-
velopment of genetic phenomenology Husserl carne 
to treat constitutive analysis as different from his first 
"universal phenomenology ofthe general structures of 
consciousness" in that through its study of the "hor-
izontal" structure of experience and through its anal-
ysis of underlying modalizations and transformations 
that give rise to manifest structures, constitutive anal-
ysis uncovers a depth to the "sphere of being" first 
opened by the transcendental EPOCHE AND REDLICTION. 
In contrast to a "horizontal" axis along which we might 
situate regional fields, a "vertical" axis is opened, trans-
form ing the grounding structure of intentionality into 
a transcendentalfie/d to be explored. In adding depth 
it enables us to understand how the regions basic to 
and explicated by regional ontologies are derived. The 
difference between "surface" and "depth" establishes 
an interna/ connection between regional and transcen-
dental fields. 
Without using regional ontologies as our guiding 
thread, we wi\1 not understand the difference between 
the horizontal and the vertical axes ofthe field of consti-
tution. Constitutive phenomenology, properly under-
stood, does not give us yet "another" region besides 
the ones opened by categoria! analysis but rather de-
scribes structures belonging to the order of sense or 
MEANING, which allow them to become determinate 
fields. I f the focus in categoria! phenomenology is on 
the identity and difference ofthe eidetic structures of a 
given field, the concern in constitutive phenomenology 
is to trace the "origin" of those structures by looking 
at, for example, the series oftransformations by which 
everyday speech becomes propositional discourse, as 
well as the experiences that make them possible. As 
will be discussed shortly, this involves a study of the 
internat ties between modalities of active synthesis and 
then between active and passive synthesis. 
The account of origins in constitutive phenomen-
ology forms a bridge to genetic analysis proper. Be-
fore dealing with their relationship we should situate 
Husserl's genetic analysis more generally in contrast 
to static phenomenology. 
Genetic phenomenology reframes the results of 
Husserl 's static account by rescinding two "abstrac-
tions" that made his first characterization of intention-
ality possible. ( 1) The "pure EGo," first described as 
a "pole" of unity definable only in terms of the acts 
and actions that it serves to relate, is recast as an "ab-
stract" structure of the "concrete ego," which has yet 
other transcendental features. It possesses general ca-
pabilities or capacities, whose exercise leads to the 
acquisition of dispositional tendencies to experience 
things one way rather than another, what Husserl calls 
"habitualities." Together they introduce a certain his-
toricity to consciousness. (2) The WORLD, which Jdeen 
J reduced and drew into the sphere of "immanence" 
as a counterpole, as something identica! posited by 
consciousness, is reframed as a concrete world that 
has undergone a process of "sedimentation" in which 
achievements in HISTORY have been deposited into its 
structure. In short, the first notion of intentionat con-
sciousness is now elaborated as intentionat lţfe; the 
first notion ofworld is recast as lifeworld. As a result, 
genetic analysis expands the parameters of the inten-
tiona! structure first opened by static analysis: ( 1) how-
ever fixed Husserl was onan ego logica! starting point, 
the concrete ego itself is understood as essentially re-
lational, as subjectivity immersed in intersubjectivity 
and situated in a community; and (2) the world is now 
elaborated both as equiprimordial with INTERSUBJECTIV-
ITY and as a historically circumscribed lifeworld. The 
effect of reframing and expansion was to internally 
connect the being of the field of intentionality with its 
becoming. 
Static analysis deals neither with the "enigma" of 
TIME-consciousness nor with SPACE. The recovery of 
these moments, which carries us beyond Husserl's 
categoria! analysis into his constitutive and then his 
genetic phenomenology, takes place in two different 
registers. In his constitutive analysis they are studied 

268 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
as "syntheses" underlying the varieties of experiential 
acts. And this account is extended in his genetic analy-
sis when Husserl discovers, through a further analysis 
of protention, an interna! connection between space 
and time. But from the point of view of the method 
itself, we can think of constitutive phenomenology as 
an explication ofthe "spatiality" ofthe transcendental 
field, while genetic analysis unfolds its "temporality." 
This second register is brought into play by a devel-
opment in phenomenological method that allowed it to 
integrate temporally and historically configured struc-
tures into its first "formal" notion of the horizon. The 
depth first discovered through a constitutive account 
can be described not only in terms of structural but 
also temporal transformations. At the same time this 
locates the difference between constitutive and genetic 
phenomenology. As he puts it in Zur Phănomenologie 
der lntersuhjektivităt II [ 1921-28], "To trace [the order 
of] constitution is not to trace the [ order of] genesis, 
which is, precisely, the genesis of constitution, itself 
actuated as genesis in a monad." Genetic phenomen-
ology deepens the account of the world by adding to 
a constitutive account an analysis of the ro le of back-
ground and context in the configuration of regions of 
experience. It deepens the account of our being in the 
world by schematizing the interplay of experience and 
discourse constitutive of the transformation of o ne re-
gion internally or one region into another as temporal. 
It treats the dynamic interplay of experience and dis-
course as deployed over time and as itself part of a 
process, historical in nature, that accounts for the con-
crete configuration of a region. 
In general we can say that genetic analysis treats 
the relationship between the regions or the transfor-
mation of a whole region into another historical form 
by seeing transformative structures as temporal. What 
is distinct about genetic analysis is that it accounts for 
various lateral relationships between different vertical 
Iines of constitution found in the transcendental field. 
These lateral relations define the diachronic interplay 
of language, experience, and appearances in terms of 
background and context, an interplay that is at work in 
the deep structure ofthose regions covered by catego-
ria! phenomenology. 
The acts of experience in and through which ob-
jects, fields, and even the self are presented are ali 
characterized as syntheses by Husserl. Static analysis 
describes them in terms of their form and then ex-
amines the rules regulating different noetic-noematic 
correlations. By contrast, genetic analysis understands 
syntheses notjust in terms ofform, but also in terms of 
productive achievement, not just in terms of their be-
ing but also their becoming. Husserl dealt mainly with 
two form of genesis, which he distinguishes as ac-
tive and passive. Active genesis refers to the conscious 
or deliberate production of different ideal complexes 
of understanding or real cultural complexes from pre-
constituted elements or objects. Complexes of under-
standing can range from something like counting to 
advanced scientific theories. Real cultural complexes 
run from a shepherd 's song to Beethoven 's N inth Sym-
phony, from a child's sketch to a composition by Paul 
Klee. 
Husserl 's own focus is upon the transformations of 
meaning that allows us to effect a change from "occa-
sional," everyday talk to something like propositional 
discourse. He suggests that ali truth statements indi-
cate "earlier" types ofspeech and then experience from 
which they arise. Judgments have a "genesis ofmean-
ing." They point back, level by level, to moda! transfor-
mations from which they are derived, to nested or im-
plied meanings in any one ofthose levels, to a context 
not directly expressed in their content yet constitutive 
of the meaning in play, and finally, to the origination 
oftheir semantic elements from experience. This gives 
not only a certain "occasionality" but also a definable 
"historicality" to "objective" discourse. 
AII active synthesis, however, is interwoven with 
what is not spontaneously produced. The final level 
to which active synthesis points is passive synthesis. 
This level might itself be the result of previous acts of 
active production that ha ve become sedimented into the 
world and, as a result, form a "secondary sensibility." 
Or it might be a level of embodied perception through 
which things are presented without active construction 
or interpretation, a level of"originary sensibility." 
Husserl 's account of passive synthesis moves 
through his constitutive to his genetic analysis. He 
turns, for example, to the presence of similarity and 
contrast played out in the relationship between adum-
brations and objects, recurring across a number of dif-
ferent regional fields, and undertakes a clarification of 
their "origin." In doing so he studies the differential 
interplay of associative, spatial, and temporal synthe-

ses that account for the transfer of sense involved in 
our recognition of something as familiar and for the 
transformation of sense that arises either as a result 
ofbecoming acquainted with new fcatures or ofbeing 
disappointed in our anticipations. Transformation has 
not only a structural but also a temporal dimension. 
Protention, to the extent that it directs experience and 
cuts a certain "line" of anticipation through the mul-
tiple possibilities thrown up by a given object, even 
links us to the motility of the lived BODY and a certain 
affectivity that draws our intentions into a nexus ofin-
volvements. Ultimately ali passive syntheses rest upon 
the interplay ofretention and protention, which allows 
Husserl then to treat the basic laws of genesis as laws 
of time-consciousness. 
The account ofpassive synthesis belongs to a disci-
pline that Husserl, echoing but greatly expanding KANT, 
calls transcendental aesthetics. Husserl takes originary 
PERCEPTION as his paradigm case here, which he sets 
in contrast to the active production of propositional 
claims studied by his transcendental logic. But it also 
seems that previous active constructions that have be-
come sedimented and thus part of our sensibility and 
sense ofthings fali under its jurisdiction as well. Tran-
scendental aesthetics, then, covers not just perceptual 
senses but, with modification, the acquired and habitual 
meanings that also shape our concrete lifeworld. 
This gives us yet another interesting way of un-
derstanding the difference between constitutive and 
genetic analysis. We can say that constitutive pheno-
menology schematizes the structural transformations 
making phenomenal fields possible according to tran-
scendental space. They are framed as layers or strata 
beneath each field, providing it with its supporting 
ground. Genetic phenomenology schematizes those 
transformations in terms of transcendental time, and 
thus as a process of development in which the earlier 
gives rise to the !ater and in which the future draws 
and gives direction to the now. Not only is the ideal-
ity of sense and meaning clarified through the notion 
of repeatability over time, but their transference anei 
transformation rest upon the interlacing of retentions 
and protentions across a living present. 
At yet a deeper and final level of genetic analysis 
Husserl discovers that space and time themselves are 
not just "forms" but are generated, on the one hand, 
by the interplay of position, motility, and place, and 
on the other, by the streaming flow of the process of 
self-temporalization itself. Husserl's studies ofthe self-
generation of space and time are clearly the most diffi-
cult of ali his genetic studies. 
For reasons having to do with his theory ofEVIDENCE 
Husserl uses the ego and its acquired world as his start-
ing point. But Husserl's recognition that subjectivity is 
necessarily concrete -
that the other is not merely 
a correlate of my own intentiona! acts, but someone 
who affects me -
led him to speak of a genesis at 
the level of community, ETHICS, culture, and RELIGION. 
In his published writings this appears for the first time 
in a series of articles he wrote for a Japanese periodi-
ca!, partially published between 1923 and 1924. There 
he traces a development through the course of history 
toward a certain te/os in which rational interaction be-
comes normative. 
Once Husserl found a way of integrating the notion 
of development and transformation into his phenomen-
ological method, and once he found a way of moving 
from his first starting point to communal existence and 
the lifeworld, new horizons open for his phenomen-
ology. For this reason we find Husserl 's very late work 
moving in the direction of yet another type of anal-
ysis, called GENERATIVE PHENOMENOLOGY, in which the 
parameters of life and death, homeworld and alien-
world, and even earth and world are used to expand 
his first notion of genetic analysis. What holds these 
accounts together is that temporality is understood as 
the final source in terms ofwhich ali development, ali 
becoming, including that interplay of conscious life 
and world constitutive of our essential historicity, is 
explained. Time, seem from within, is the form of in-
tentiona! genesis. 
This clarification ofthe difference between catego-
ria!, constitutive, and genetic phenomenology shows us 
how deeply Heidegger's working method in Sein und 
Zeit, for ali the striking differences in content resulting 
from its application, is indebted to Husserl's frame-
work. While it does not actually attempt to carry them 
out, Sein und Zeit establishes a place for regional on-
tologies. Because he wants the use of"ontological" to 
be reserved for his transcendental account, Heidegger 
characterizes such regional disciplines as "ontic." With 
that to the side, Division 1 undertakes extensive struc-
tural descriptions of the various moments of DASEIN as 
being-in-the-world, as well as accounts ofthe "origins" 

270 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ofthe present-at-hand, on the one hand, and assertions, 
on the other. It clearly works with the resources of a 
constitutive phenomenology with one important quali-
fication: Heidegger avoids treating any one constitutive 
level as absolutely basic, stressing in its stead the sense 
in which founding relations are relative and in which 
each level is yet another dependent "moment" of the 
whole structure of Dasein. Division Il then attempts 
to reframe the results of this account in terms of tem-
porality, which is precisely what Husserl's notion of 
genetic phenomenology calls for. However different 
the content oftheir theories, there is a surprising coin-
cidence between the different levels oftheir systematic 
phenomenological methods. 
Because references to the notion of genetic pheno-
menology are very sketchy in the works Husserl pub-
lished during his lifetime and because seminal texts 
that discuss and use the notion of genetic phenomen-
ology only became available in the Husserliana vol-
umes published after 1965, the concept is rarely taken 
up directly by !ater figures in the phenomenological 
tradition. Philosophers such as Heidegger, MAURICE 
MERLEAU-PONTY, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, and PAUL RICCEUR un-
derstood that a difference between static and genetic 
phenomenology was at work in the development of 
Husserl's thinking, but they tended to appropriate the 
contrast for their own ends rather than discuss it di-
rectly.

Intensive research has been done 
on the development of phenomenology in Germany 
before World War II and the main figures and central 
themes ofthat time are covered by other entries in this 
Encyclopedia. This entry will survey the early devel-
opment. The period after the war will be considered in 
more detail. 
Phenomenology had its roots in AUSTRIAN philos-
ophy and beyond that in BRITISH EMPIRICISM, but its 
original growth has been in Germany and it has spread 
from there to FRANCE, JAPAN, RUSSIA, the UNITED STATES, 
and the rest ofthe world. EDMUND HUSSERL, the founder 
of phenomenology, studied with FRANZ BRENTANO and 
was deeply inftucnced by Brentano's project of a de-
scriptive psychology. But it was above ali Brentano's 
account of intentionality or object-relatedness as the

prime characteristic of psychic phenomena that in-
fluenced Husserl, whose work before the mid-1890s, 
including the Philosophie der Arithmetik (1891 ), is 
fundamentally Brentanist in conception. Husserl broke 
with his teacher and advocated a non-immanentist ac-
count of INTENTIONALITY in his tradition-founding Lo-
gische Untersuchungen ( 1900--1901 ). 
From the very beginning Husserl's conceptions of 
formal LOGIC and MATHEMATICS were guided by David 
Hilbert (1862~1943). Husserl's new approach in the 
Logische Untersuchungen might be understood as a 
reaction to GOTTLOB FREGE's Platonistic criticism ofhis 
PSYCHOLOGISM in the Phi/osophie der Arithmetik, but 
his phenomenology of logic has nothing in common 
with Frege's radical Platonism. The Logische Unter-
suchungen reject the psychologistic interpretation of 
logic that goes back at least to John Stuart Miii and 
could sti li be found in Brentano's reduction of ideal en-
tities to psychic entities as well as in the transcendental 
psychologism present in the theory constructions ofthe 
neo-Kantians. But Husserl retained Brentano 's concept 
ofintentionality as the basic tool for his own enterprise. 
He maintained that a clear account ofthe difference be-
tween real, mental, and ideal entities can only be given 
with the aid of intentiona! analysis. The ma in question 
for Husserl was the "how of the givenness" of ideal 
objects for consciousness. In contrast, Frege's critique 
ofpsychologism rejected any position that recognized 
ideal entities but was sti li interested in the question of 
their givenness to subjectivity. Husserl called philoso-
phy back to the "matters themselves," to the descriptive 
analytic investigation of experience itself: both to ob-
jects of every sort as they present themselves and to 
the structures of consciousness of such objects. 
The Logische Untersuchungen had an immediate 
impact. WILHELM DILTHEY described it as "epochal," 
and as its influence spread, Husserl attracted increas-
ing numbers of students to Gottingen. Another group 
emerged in Munich. ALEXANDER PFĂNDER, who used 
the term phenomenology even before Husserl in the 
title of a book, was the head of this group. Husserl 
visited Munich in 1904. While he was primarily con-
cerned with the philosophical foundations oflogic and 
mathematics and had focused on the phenomenology 
of cognition, those under his early influence begun to 
use his approach, especially his EIDETIC METHOD, on a 
quite diverse set of problems. The work they initiated 
during these early years on ACTION, EMOTION, ETHICS, 
FEMINISM, LANGUAGE, LAW, LOGIC, PERCEPTION, RELIGION, 
VALUE, etc. continued thereafter. This early group in-
cluded THEODOR CONRAD, HEDWIG CONRAD-MARTIUS, JO-
HANNES DAUBERT, MORITZ GEIGER, NICOLAI HARTMANN, RO-
MAN INGARDEN, ALEXANDRE KOYRE, HANS LIPPS, ALEXAN-
DER 
PFĂNDER, ADOLF REINACH, WILHELM SCHAPP, MAX 
SCHELER, EDITH STEIN, and, !ater, HERBERT SPIEGELBERG. 
At this same time, Husserl's work began to influ-
ence PSYCHIATRY through KARL JASPERS and LUDWIG BIN-
SWANGER. 
Most ofthe members ofthe early group ofphenome-
nologists at Gottingen adhered to so-called mundane 
or REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY. Their work involved 
substantive objections to Husserl 's own work along 
with their own creative appropriation of it. Some re-
mained essentially phenomenologists, while others es-
tablished independent philosophical positions strongly 
influenced by phenomenology. Although not strictly 
from Gottingen, the most influential philosopher be-
longing to this early group was MAX SCHELER, and much 
ofhis work continued tobe deeply phenomenological, 
especially his discussions of emotion, value, and reli-
gion, as well as ethics. But while Husserl was to speak 
of "anthropologism" as a philosophical error, Scheler 
became one ofthe advocates ofPHILOSOPHICAL ANTHRO-
POLOGY. 
Husserl had referred to phenomenology as "descrip-
tive psychology" in the first edition ofthe Logische Un-
tersuchungen. But he soon carne to characterize this as 
a misnomer. The descriptions of the intentiona! acts 
in which objects are given are themselves eidetic and 
refer toana priori. But for Husserl this was sti li insuf-
ficient for understanding phenomenology as a first phi-
losophy seeking an ultimate grounding. According to 
Husserl, this could only be achieved by a transcenden-
tal turn. In Ideen zu ei ner reinen Phiinomenologie und 
phiinomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913) he asserted 
that philosophical radicality requires us to view inten-
tiona! processes not as parts of the world, but rather in 
their function of constituting the world. Intentionality 
is the "origin" ofthe world qua phenomenon and thus 
cannot itselfbe merely another part ofthe world. Purely 
transcendental consciousness as an abject of study is 
the correlate of a specifically transcendental attitude 
on the part of the phenomenologist, and this attitude 
is adopted through transcendental EPOCHE AND REDUC-

272 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
TION. The transcendental turn for Husserl opened up 
the fu li range and significance of CONSTITUTIVE PHENO-
MENOLOGY. 
The 
idea 
of "ultimate 
grounding" 
(Letzt-
begriindung) as the central task of philosophy is 
neo-Kantian. The radical rejection of KANT and neo-
Kantianism in the Untersuchungen is considerably 
weakened in the !deen. Husserl even claimed that he 
was now a bie to recognize a pure transcendental EGO in 
the framework of his phenomenology. The treatment 
of Kant in his !ater work, though highly critica! with re-
spect to Kant's constructive and hypothetical method, 
is, in general, positive. In particular, Husserl recog-
nized the viability of Kant's transcendental question. 
The influence of the neo-Kantians and especially of 
Paul Natorp (1854--1924) on the development leading 
to the Ideen and beyond cannot be denied. Most ofthe 
phenomenologists of the Gottingen circle, however, 
were not able to follow Husserl's turn to transcenden-
tal constitutive phenomenology. Ingarden in particular 
was to write a sustained critique of Husserl 's tran-
scendental turn and a thoroughjustification ofrealistic 
phenomenology.ln the 1920s Husserl gathered together 
a group of young phenomenologists in Freiburg that 
incJuded OSKAR BECKER, EUGEN FINK, FRITZ KAUFMANN, 
LUDWIG LANDGREBE, HANS REINER, and above al!, MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER. Husserl 's hopes for the fu ture ofphenomen-
ology centered increasingly on Heidegger. He sketched 
out a project in which the task of Becker was to de-
velop the phenomenology of logic and mathematics 
as well as the NATURAL SCIENCES. Heidegger's domain 
was to be the phenomenology of the HUMAN SCIENCES. 
When Husserl retired from Freiburg in 1928, Heideg-
ger was his designated successor, but he soon decided 
that Heidegger had abandoned transcendental pheno-
menology and turned to anthropologism with the pub-
lication of Sein und Zeit (1927). Most ofthe members 
of the Freiburg ci rele eventually, and in different de-
grees, carne under Heidegger's influence. In the 1920s 
Husserl was also influential among phenomenologists 
beyond the Freiburg group such as FELIX KAUFMANN, AL-
FRED SCHUTZ, and ARON GURWITSCH. In fact, with the aid 
of GEST ALT PSYCHOLOGY, Gurwitsch deveJoped a subtJe 
criticism of certa in implications of Husserl 's transcen-
dental reduction without rejecting it completely. He, 
together with Schutz, Spiegelberg, the two Kaufmanns, 
and the Americans MARVIN FARBER and DORION CAIRNS 
took German phenomenology to the United States be-
ginning in the 1920s. 
Husserl 's own attempts to develop his project in 
further volumes of the !deen and most of his other 
work as well as his lectures and research manuscripts 
remained unpublished for many years. The richness of 
the work ofthe 1920s only appeared and had influence 
on German phenomenology after 1950. By his death in 
1938, Husserl had only published severa! variants of 
introductions to his phenomenology, among them the 
Encyclopaedia Britannica article ( 1929) and the Carte-
sianische Meditationen [ 1931] in its earlier French ver-
sion. Excluding the Vorlesungen zur Phanomenologie 
des inneren Zeitbewusstseins [ 1905], edited by Heideg-
ger in 1928, Husserl's last book published in Germany 
was Formale und transzendentale Logik ( 1929), a new 
exposition ofhis phenomenology oflogic in the frame-
work of transcendental phenomenology. The first two 
parts ofhis last great though unfinished work, Die Kri-
sis der europaischen Wissenschaften und die transzen-
dentale Phanomenologie ( 1936), where he developed 
the concept of LIFEWORLD, had to be published in YU-
GOSLAVIA. In addition, Erfahrung und Urteil ( 1939), 
a collection of manuscripts on the phenomenology of 
logic edited by Landgrebe, was printed outside Ger-
many in CZECHOSLOVAKIA and became available in Ger-
many only after 1948. 
Heidegger's preference in the 1920s for the pre-
transcendental phenomenology ofthe Logische Unter-
suchungen over transcendental phenomenology was 
the harbinger for the future. With the publication of 
Sein und Zeit in 1927, he shifted the focus of pheno-
menology to EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY and !ater to 
HERMENEUTIC AL PHENOMENOLOGY. The question of Be-
ing (Seins.fi·age) was for Heidegger the hidden presup-
position ofHusserl's approach. In his early lectures the 
analysis ofthe ontologica! difference took the place of 
the phenomenological reduction. In what he took tobe 
opposition to Husserl 's transcendentalism, Heidegger 
first turned to the interpretive analysis of a worldly 
situated and historical engagement. (Drawing on the 
work of Jaspers as well as Heidegger, HANNAH ARENDT 
appears the first in this existential-phenomenological 
tendency.) While Sein und Zeit was still genuinely 
phenomenological in inspiration, after the so-called 
Kehre or "turning" ofthe early 1930s, when Heidegger 
turned his attention from the analysis of DASEIN's pre-

GERMANY 
273 
comprehension of Being to Being itself, his thought 
became less and less phenomenological, although the 
origins in phenomenology never entirely disappeared. 
Toward the end of his life, Husserl himself real-
ized that the project of a pure transcendental pheno-
menology had lost its influence. The philosophies of 
Scheler and Heidegger, his "antipodes," and, accord-
ing to a letter to Ingarden, the general irrationalism 
of the 20th century dominated the field. His hope was 
that future generations would rediscover the signifi-
cance of his work for a true, rational philosophy. In 
the wake of the emergence of the interna! crisis of 
the phenomenological movement, the politica! and cul-
tural catastrophe ofthe Nazi regime and its racism and, 
ultimately, the war caused a brutal disruption ofphilo-
sophical discourse in Germany. Further discussion of 
different conceptions of phenomenology was simply 
impossible. 
In the first decades after the war, the phenomen-
ological movement "in the broader sense," as Spiegel-
berg !ater defined it, was ali ve in Germany in the strong 
influence of French existential phenomenology, above 
alJ through thc works of.JEAN-PAUL SARTRE and MAURICE 
MERLEAU-PONTY, on the one hand, and Heidegger on 
the other. Heidegger's involvement in the Third Reich 
was remembered in Germany after the war, but many 
considered it a personal mistake not connected with 
his philosophy. His earlier writings had had a powerful 
influence on Husserl 's students ofthe 1920s with very 
few exceptions, e.g., HANS REINER, and he was the lead-
ing figure in German philosophy from the 1930s into 
the 1 960s. 
With Sartre, Heidegger, and Jaspers the catchword 
of the first decade after the war in Germany was 
not "phenomenology" nor even "existential pheno-
menology," but EXISTENTIALISM, and Heidegger himself 
was initially understood as the leading figure of this 
movement. There was, in addition, a certain interes! 
in Scheler's !ater speculations but no intensive Scheler 
research. The older phenomenological movement was 
of interes! only for the first historical surveys of philos-
ophy in our century, e.g., that ofWolfgang Stegmi.iller. 
The question ofwhether or not Husserl was forgotten in 
Germany even began to be raised in non-professional 
intellectual journals. The question was justified since 
in general the rejection of the phenomenological re-
duction by Merleau-Ponty was, for different reasons, 
shared by the Heideggerians and even the former as-
sistants of Husserl. 
Right after the war Landgrebe's interes! was to find 
a transition from phenomenology to metaphysics, and 
Fink explored the possibilities of ontologica! expe-
rience; discussed the operational presuppositions in 
Husserl 's reduction; and was looking for new founda-
tions forphenomenology in speculative thinking. They 
kept a critica! distance from Heidegger, but admitted 
implicitly that Heidegger 's critique of Husserl was, in 
principle, justified. The attempt to do as much jus-
tice as possible to Husserl under these circumstances 
produced some myths in Husserl interpretation. Al-
most commonplace for a long time was the thesis that 
Husserl himself had abandoned his original program 
in his turn in the Krisis essays to the LIFEWORLD. In 
1963 HANS-GEORG GADAMER, by no means a follower 
of Husserl but still a skilled interpreter, proved that 
these myths were untenable. Unfortunately, this mes-
sage failed to reach many phenomenologists 1in Ger-
many and, especially, many outside Germany. 
The presupposition for a new start ofthe phenomen-
ological movement in Germany during the mid-1950s 
is the edition ofHusserl's collected works, the Husser-
liana, by the Husserl Archives founded by HERMAN LEO 
VAN BREDA at Louvain. The availability of the tran-
scriptions of Husserl 's research manuscripts at Koln 
and Freiburg was also significant for this new begin-
ning. The first eight volumes of the Husserliana in 
the late 1 950s and 1 960s triggered vigorous discus-
sion ofthe phenomenological method and its ultimate 
grounding (Letztbegriindung). The significance of the 
phenomenology ofthe consciousness ofinner TIME had 
already been discovered in this context and remained a 
central topic. The volumes ofthe Husserliana that fol-
lowed introduced further material relevant to the more 
application-oriented research after 1970. Other topics, 
not known in their significance before, include GENETIC 
and GENERATIVE PHENOMENOLOGY and INTERSUB.IECTIV-
ITY. The significance ofHusserl's late phenomenology 
for a phenomenology of HISTORY and the HUMAN sci-
ENCES could finally be discovered with the aid of this 
material, and new possibilities provided by Husserl's 
analyses of passive synthesis were used in the pheno-
menology of logic. 
The history of the institutional framework of the 
phenomenological movement in postwar Germany is 

274 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
a practica! guide to the periods of its development. 
The first phase, from 1950 to 1970, was in the begin-
ning sti Il under the guidance of scholars from FRANCE 
and THE NETHERLANDS. The center of the new begin-
ning was the Husserl Archives in Louvain. Landgrebe, 
fink, STEPHAN STRASSER, and WALTER BIEMEL, i.e., the 
first generation of postwar phenomenologists, worked 
at the Archives. In 1949, Fink founded the branch ofthe 
Archives at Freiburg. The branch at Koln was founded 
in 1951. Jts first director was KARL-HEINZ VOLKMANN-
SCHLUCK, who was followed by Landgrebe after 1956. 
Van Breda also initiated a series of international collo-
quia in phenomenology. Fink was the only German on 
the original committee. The first meeting took place 
in France in 1951, the second in Germany in 1956, 
the third again in France in 1957, and the fourth in 
Germany in 1969. 
The foundation of the "Deutsche Gesellschaft fUr 
phanomenologische Forschung" (German Society for 
Phenomenological Research) was prepared at the 
fourth colloquium in Schwabisch Hali. With this, the 
second period of the development of phenomenology 
in Germany began. Two international meetings in 
Munich in 1971 and Berlin in 1974 were organized 
by the society and published in the first three vol-
umes in the series of the society, Phanomenologische 
Forschungen (Phenomenological Studies), edited by 
ERNST WOLFGANG ORTH. The society institutionaiized its 
international meetings in 1976 and the proceedings 
of its biennial meetings have been published in the 
Phanomenologische Forschungen together with the 
proceedings of other conferences on phenomenology 
in Germany. The development leading to the activities 
of the Deutsche Gesellschaft was, in the beginning, 
devoted to the rediscovery of Husserl in the wake of 
the publication of the Husserliana. But the activities 
of the society were by no means restricted to such 
research. The entire extent of the phenomenological 
movement, both its past and future development, has 
been discussed. 
The first meeting organized by the society was de-
voted to "Munich phenomenology." It concentrated 
primarily on Pfander's work and was published in 
1975 in the Phaenomenologica series. Further research 
was done by Spiegeiberg and KARL SCHUHMANN. The 
Pfander-Studien (Pfander studies) were published in 
1982 by Spiegelberg and EBERHART AVE-LALLEMANT. 
The Pfander Archives at Munich are under the care 
of Ave-Lallemand. The center for Brentano research 
is Brentano-Studien, which was founded by Wilhelm 
Baumgartner. The Scheler Gesammelte Werke, under 
the care of Maria Scheler and MANFRED FRINGS, was 
published in Bern and !ater in Bonn beginning in 
1954, but very few publications devoted to Scheler's 
work have appeared. However, a collection of essays, 
Max Scheler im Gegenwartsgeschehen der Phi/oso-
phie, was published by PAUL GOOD in 1975. The Max 
Scheler Gesellschaft was founded in Ko1n in 1993. 
The first volume ofthe Heidegger Gesamtausgahe ap-
peared in 1976. The publication ofthese early lectures 
has shed new 1ight on the links between phenomen-
ology and Heidegger's first steps toward FUNDAMEN-
TAL ONTOLOGY. The Martin Heidegger Gesellschaft was 
founded in Messkirch in 1986 and has organized sev-
era! conferences and publishes its own series. 
The first postwar period of phenomeno1ogical re-
search had its roots chiefly in the circles growing out 
ofthe Husserl Archives at Louvain, Freiburg, and Koln. 
GERD BRAND, who worked at Louvain, published the first 
study extensively using the unpublished manuscripts 
of Husserl in 1955. 1so KERN, also connected with 
the archives, published a monumental historical work 
on Husserl's relations to Kant and the neo-Kantians 
in 1964. Landgrebe, the director of the archives at 
Koln, published his new conception in 1963 and Fink 
at Freiburg developed his critique of Husserl 's tran-
scendental phenomenology grounded in his personal 
knowledge of Husserl's intentions. He reached his fi-
nal position in which speculative thinking and dialec-
tic provide the foundation for phenomenology in Sein, 
Wahrheit, Welt ( 1958). Biemel contributed a signif-
icant essay on the development of Husserl's pheno-
menology. 
Landgrebe had many students and assistants in 
Koln and founded a very productive school. Two 
Festschrifien, one edited by ULRICH CLAESGESand KLAUS 
HELD, the other by Biemel, were both published in 1972. 
Independent publications belonging to this context are 
the early essays ofHERMANN LOBBE, a former assistant of 
Landgrebe; the investigations of HANS ULRICH HOCHE on 
non-empirica! knowledge in Kant and Husserl, KLAUS 
HELD on the transcendental ego and the living present; 
and Claesges on the constitution of SPACE. LOTHAR 
ELEY's critica! investigations concerning the crisis of 

GERMANY 
275 
the a priori, influenced by HEGEL and CRITICAL THEORY, 
belong to this early Koln tradition as well. 
The schoo] begun by GERHARD FUNKE at Mainz had 
a very different origin. Husserl 's development was ac-
companied in part by the sympathetic and in part by 
the critica] and even polemica] responses of the neo-
Kantians. The publications ofthe Husserliana renewed 
their interest. The critica] remarks of Hans Wagner 
and a series of essays written by Funke collected in 
a volume published in 1957 were the first responses 
of this type. WOLFGANG HERMANN M0LLER, a student of 
Funke, wrote the first book interpreting Husserl as a 
transcendental idealist. But an independent interest in 
Husserl's phenomenology can be found in Mainz be-
fore Funke inaugurated this Kantianizing tradition of 
Husserl interpretation there. ALWIN DIEMER wrote the 
first monograph on Husserl 's philosophy as a whole in 
1956. ALOIS ROTH's dissertation is the first attempt to 
reconstruct Husserl 's ETHICS. 
Funke's coming to Mainz developed a strictly 
transcendental methodological approach to Husserl 's 
phenomenology with a strong bias toward Kantian and 
neo-Kantian problematics. The main topics of con-
cern to this school were systematic and critica] reflec-
tions on the concept of phenomenology and the history 
of phenomenology and its development, especially in 
Husserl. Funke's program was corroborated and mod-
ified first by THOMAS M. SEEBOHM in 1962 and ]ater by 
Orth in 1967. The general tendency of this school is 
captured in the title of Funke's Phănomenologie­
Metaphysik oder Methode? (1966), which questions 
the tendency toward providing phenomenology with 
a metaphysical foundation, evident in such works as 
Langdrebe 's Phănomenologie und Metaphysik ( 1949). 
Furtherpublications belongingto this school have been 
published since 1970 in the series Conscientia and the 
Mainzer philosophische Forschungen. 
The structure of the phenomenological movement 
and the topics changed after 1970. ELISABETH STROKER 
became the director of the Archives at Koln and 
WERNFR MARX followed Fink at the Freiburg Archives. 
The phenomenological tradition continued at Mainz 
with Funke and ]ater Seebohm. But phenomenology 
was now well represented in severa! other universi-
ties. Munich became the center of Pfănder research. 
RUDOLF BERLINGER and HEINRICH ROM BACH, together with 
the psychiatrist DIETER wvss, are phenomenologists 
working at Wiirzburg; OTTO POGGELER and BERNHARD 
WALDFNFELS are at Bochum; He]d and ANTONIO AGUIRRE 
are at Wuppertal; and Orth together with KARL-HEINZ 
LEMBFCK are at Trier. The problems of the essence of 
phenomenology and the justification and possible lim-
its of especially Husserl's phenomenology have been 
discussed at length and the main interest has now 
turned to the various fields of phenomenological re-
search. The topics of the majority of the conferences 
organized by the German Society for Phenomenology 
are devoted to what can be called "applied phenomen-
ology." It is therefore difficult to distinguish differ-
ent phenomenological schools in this period. The dis-
tinction between the different fields of application is 
clearer. 
Phenomeno]ogy of the NATURAL SCIENCFS has a sigc 
nificant place in the work of Elisabeth Stroker, and 
other activities in this field were mostly results of her 
initiatives. Stroker has been in addition the leading 
figure in Husserl scholarship during this period and 
has made significant contributions to the phenomen-
ology of logic and of history. A collection of her es-
says was published in 1987. Werner Marx published 
studies of Heidegger and ]ater of Husserl. Interest in 
the phenomenology of logic in the narrower sense has 
been marginal and in general critica!. ERNST TUGEND-
HAT turned tO ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY after his influentiaJ 
book, published in 1967, on the concept of TRUTH in 
Husserl and Heidegger. He has since published sev-
era! critica! essays concerning Husserl's phenomen-
ology from this point of view. Hoche made a similar 
turn in 1982. Eley's metacritique of formal logic is 
written from a quasi-Hegelian perspective and also in-
cludes a metacritique of Husserl 's phenomenology of 
logic. Husserl's phenomenology of mathematics was 
analyzed in two monographs, one by ROGER SCHMIT, 
published in 1981, and the other by DIETER LOHMAR, 
which was published in 1989. Attempts to apply pheno-
menology to the state ofthe art in this discipline in the 
second half of the century have been made by See-
bohm. Most ofthis work has, however, been published 
in English. 
The vast majority of work during this period has 
been devoted to the Geisteswissenschaften, i.e., pheno-
menology of LITERATURE, SOCIOLOGY, HERMENEUTICS, 
etc. Significant work in this field had already been 
done before 1970- for example, Hans Reiner's in-

276 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
vestigations on the foundations of ethics. Fritz Kauf-
mann and Walter Biemel made significant contribu-
tions in phenomenological AESTHETICS. Roman Ingar-
den 's books on the literary work of art ha ve been highly 
influential in this area, and phenomenological research 
on history was revived as early as 1953 with the in-
vestigations of Wilhelm Schapp. History and lifeworld 
ha ve also been considered in the works ofboth Stroker 
and PAUL JANSSEN. Seebohm published a critica! pheno-
menological study on hermeneutics as a methodology 
of philological-historical research in 1972, and KARL-
HEINZ LEMBECK published work on history as a science 
in 1988. The phenomenology of the lifeworld along 
with the works of Merleau-Ponty, Schutz, and Gur-
witsch are at the center of the research conducted by 
the group surrounding RICHARD GRATHOFF conceming 
INTERSUBJECTIVITY and LANGUAGE. BERNHARD WALDEN-
FELS' study of dialogue published in 1971, his mono-
graph on French phenomenology published in 1983, 
and the series Ubergiinge ali belong to the activities of 
this group. 
In recent years, significant research has also been 
done on the prehistory and history of phenomen-
ology. Orth, Schuhmann, and lately also NIELS w. 
BOKHOVE ha ve published studies on the prehistory ofthe 
term "phenomenology:" An investigation conceming 
Husserl 's relation to FICHTE was published by HERMANN 
TIETJEN in 1980, and the dispute between Husserl and 
Jonas Cohn ( 1869-194 7), a neo-Kantian and Fichtean, 
is, together with a systematic comparison, the topic of 
REINALD KLOCKENBUSCH's most recent work. 
The productive phase of German phenomenology 
carne to its end with the last works of Heidegger af-
ter the war. The period of intensive interpretation and 
further development of this productive phase has lost 
its strength. German philosophy now has the character 
of experimental investigations including severa! influ-
ences from abroad, first of ali pragmatism and analytic 
philosophy. In addition most of the philosophers who 
had their education after the war and received positions 
at the universities wili retire within the next decade. In 
these circumstances it is very difficult to give a re-
liable estimate for the future, but perhaps there wili 
be a retum to the first phase of development, like the 
"back-to-Kant" movement in the middle of the 19th 
century.

GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY 
277 
Of ARON GURWITSCH and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, has 
most interested phenomenology. 
Gestalt psychology arose through examination of 
earlier work. In 1891 Christian von Ehrenfels ( 1859-
1932) in AUSTRIA published "Uber Gestaltqualităten": 
when one hears a piece of music, the notes that one 
senses are caused by externa! factors, i.e., air waves, 
but the me1ody is a "gestalt quality" that is added 
by the mind, something shown by how this quality 
stays the same when the notes are changed in melodic 
transposition. With similar views, Alexius Meinong 
(1853-1920) founded a school of psychology at Graz 
in which the experimentalist Vittorio Benussi (1878-
1927) posited a factor he called "production" as the 
subjective explanation of gestalt qualities. For those at 
Graz, the gestalt quality is an ideal object ofhigher or-
der, while for von Ehrenfels (and similarly for EDMUND 
HUSSERL in his Philosophie der Arithmetik [ 1891]) it is 
sensuous or quas1-sensuous. 
The Gestalt psychology of the Berlin school began 
when Wertheimer investigated apparent motion or phi 
phenomena in 1912: if objects a short distance apart are 
illuminated in rapid succession, a single object is seen 
to move and one can be said to ha ve seen a gestalt or 
configuration. A gestalt. in this new signification, is a 
concrete structure of constituents that mutually support 
and determine one another and not something added 
to sense data. Wertheimer and his followers held that 
neither a "gestalt quality" nor "sensations" can be given 
concretely. When two dots, for example, are seen as a 
twosome, both dots function as terminals, one to the left 
and the other to the right. In musical transposition, there 
is not an identica! melody but two or more particular 
auditory configurations ofnotes that are highly similar 
with respect to their structures. Many other gestalts 
have been described. Probably the most widely known 
is how, as Edgar Rubin ( 1886-1951) showed, the figure 
in figure/ground configurations is detached from the 
ground, contour belongs to it, the ground extends under 
the figure, and, while the figure is shaped, coherent, and 
particular, the ground is relatively shapeless, indefinite, 
and generic. The dot used as a period at the end of a 
sentence fits this description of a figure with the page 
as the ground, as does a sound against stillness. Rubin's 
work was accepted by the Berlin school. 
Then again, in what is known as "Stumpf's para-
dox," a device can produce three slightly different fre-
quencies of sound waves, .r, y, and .::, such that when 
the first two frequencies are produced in succession, 
one hears equal sounds, i.e., .r = y, when the second 
two are produced, one hears y = .::, but when the first 
and third frequencies are produced, one hears :r :f- .:. 
Koffka observed, however, that the constituents in the 
first two gestalts have a "platform structure" while 
the third has a "step structure," and contended that 
constituents in different structures are different con-
stituents. Reformulated as .r = y, y' = .::, and .r' :f- .:', 
there is no paradox: .r and .r', etc., are two and similar, 
not one and the same. 
So-called "categoria! terms" such as identity, dif-
ference, similarity, dissimilarity, equality, inequality, 
unity, and diversity ha ve been of interest to phenome-
nologists since Husserl 's Philosophie der Arithmetik. 
And the names of small numbers such as "three" can 
refer either to a gestalt of perceived items, a three-
some, or they can refer to sets of elements determined 
in categoria! thinking. The ideal structures constituted 
in thinking are distinct from the perceptual structures 
constituted in perception, according to Gestalt psychol-
ogy. 
In opposition to those in modern thought who distin-
guish sensations, sense data, or sensa as concrete parts 
within perceptual objects, the Berlin school follows 
Koffka 's 1915 rejection of the constancy hypothesis, 
according to which there is a one-to-one correspon-
dence between physical stimuli ( e.g., sound waves ); the 
neurological events they directly cause; and the sensa 
they then cause indirectly. In other words, if the same 
sense organ is stimulated in the same way, a sensation 
ofthe same sort must occur, which implies atomism not 
only in physics, but also in neurology and psychology. 
And if an analytic attitude fails to disci o se the predicted 
sensations, unnoticed objects and even unconscious 
processes are posited, and psychology is then preoccu-
pied with the discrepancies between what is predicted 
by the constancy hypothesis and what is actually ob-
served. Beginning in his French essays from the 1930s, 
however, Gurwitsch emphasizes that this hypothesis is 
neither self-evident nor experimentally demonstrable. 
Moreover, his friend Merleau-Ponty suggests in his 
first book, La structure du comportement ( 1942), that 
atomism is outmoded in 20th century physics and neu-
rology and that even to posit unobserved differences in 
data due to differences between sense organs- e.g., 

278 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the object as heard through the ear as sharply distinct 
from the object as seen through the eyes- assumes 
the constancy hypothesis (he urges instead the notion 
of synaesthesia, whereby gray objects look cool even 
when not touched). Many today nevertheless continue 
to assume this untestable "hypothesis." 
While the Graz school posited an often unobserv-
able difference in the percept due to externa! stimula-
tion, on the one hand, and interna! factors, especially 
Produktion, on the other hand, the Berlin school held 
that unitary effects might arise from multiple causes. 
Gurwitsch asserts this as the difference between ex-
planations of the form P = !1 (:re) + h(.ri) and P = 
f(.rc .. ri). Interna! factors include attitude and past ex-
perience and also physiological conditions (e.g., blood 
alcohol). Assuming the light reflected in the follow-
ing area and also the reader's neurological system re-
main constant, the interna! factor of attitude can be 
recognized with respect to the following set of sixteen 
asterisks. 
* * * * 
* * * * 
* * * * 
* * * * 
Through subtle shifts in attitude, one can see a 
square within a square, four horizontallines, two pairs 
of horizontals, four vertical li nes, two pairs of verti-
cals, groups of three lines with outliers above, below, 
to the left, or to the right, two ta li rectangles, two wide 
rectangles, a square of four squares, two horizontal 
pairs of squares, two vertical pairs of squares, four 
larger squares with L-shaped outliers, twenty triangles 
of varying size and orientation, eight tent-shaped fig-
ures on diagonals, i.e., at least sixty configurations or 
gestalts. In each there is a different structure in which 
the constituents play subtly different roles in relation 
to one another. 
One does not constantly "see" the same sensations 
and just "interpret" them differently, for one cannot 
reflectively observe sensa and concept in the percept, 
the one a sensuous object and the other an ideal object, 
nor can o ne distinguish a stratum of sensing and a stra-
tum of thinking within the perceiving. The tendency 
nevertheless to accept such an "interpretation theory" 
may stem from reflection on speech, where an identi-
ca! ideal concept is indeed expressed in different marks 
and sounds. The sixteen asterisks, however configured, 
are not a text with author, reader, or referent, which is 
not to deny that speech can function as yet another in-
terna! explanatory factor, e.g., how the exercise above 
involved the reader's vision being affected by his or 
her reading ofthe list of gestalts. 
According to Gurwitsch, "Following the dismissal 
ofthe constancy hypothesis, the percept has tobe con-
sidered as a homogeneous unit, though internally artic-
ulated and structured. It has to be taken at face value; 
as that which it presents itself to be through the given 
act of perception and though that act alone; as it ap-
pears to the perceiving subject's consciousness; as it 
is meant and intended (the term 'meaning' understood 
in a properly broadened and enlarged sense) in that 
privileged mode of meaning and intending which is 
perceptual presentation. In other words, the percept 
as it is conceived after the constancy hypothesis is 
abandoned proves to be what we called the perceptum 
qua perceptum, the perceptua/ noe ma or the perceptual 
phenomenon." 
The abandonment of the constancy hypothesis is 
considered by Gurwitsch tobe an incipient phenomen-
ological EPOCHE AND REDUCTION that enables avoiding 
the vicious circle whereby perception is "explained 
with reference to real things and physical processes 
which, in turn, have to be accounted for in terms of 
perceptual consciousness." Although he intends this 
as a transcendental-phenomenological epoche and re-
duction, it can also be construed as a psychological-
phenomenological epoche and reduction, whereby one 
remains in the worldly or natural (and even naturalis-
tic) attitude but suspends consideration of causal rela-
tions between psychic phenomena and not directly ob-
servable extrapsychic factors, such as photons. Gestalt 
results can thus be used in phenomenological PSYCHOL-
OGY. 
The phenomenological interest is not in the phys-
ical and neurological explanations but in the broadly 
descriptive results of Gestalt psychology, especially 
those concerning PERCEPTION. These include "gestalt 
laws" that hold within that which can be reflectively 
observed, e.g., if constituents are closer, similar, form 
a closed unit, or continue others, then they tend to be 
grouped. An analytic attitude is necessary to discern the 
connections of proximity, similarity, etc., among the 
constituents, and Merleau-Ponty urges that those that 

GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY 
279 
are antecedent conditions be called "motivcs" rather 
than causes to avoid confusion with externa! physical 
conditions, such as sound waves. An analytic attitude 
does not provide access to constituents independent 
of their ro les in gestalts, but rather reconfigures them. 
Gestaltist experimentation was practiced on subjects 
who remained in the unreftective attitude, but the psy-
chologists engage in reftection on others insofar as they 
relate the objects as perceived to the others perceiving 
them. Results ofreftective-descriptive analysis are ex-
pressed in statements that purport to be objective or 
nonrelative knowledge, which is to say that others of 
good will and skilled in the pertinent approach can 
verify, correct, and extend them. 
The attempt to appropriate Gestaltist descrip-
tions began with Gurwitsch 's dissertation of 1929. 
He begins with the analysis of the 
NOEMA in 
Husserl 's Ideen zu einer reinen Phiinomenologie 
und phiinomenologischen Philosophie I (1913). The 
object-as-it-presents-itself is distinguished from the 
thing perceived or the object-that-presents-itself. Then 
a distinction is roade within the object as it presents it-
self- the noema-between the noematic nucleus and 
the noematic characteristics, i.e., belief-characteristics, 
so that the latter can be disregarded. The emphasis is 
then on the nucleus of realities as perceived. Funda-
mental for Gurwitsch 's revisions of Husserl 's account 
of sensuous perception is his rejection, on Gestaltist 
grounds, of hyletic data as chaotic sensa, on the one 
hand, and sense-bestowing noetic functions on the 
other. 
Gurwitsch 's 
first 
phenomenological 
use 
of 
reftective-descriptive Gestalt findings concerns what 
is traditionally cal\ed attention. Whereas Husserl and 
others conceived of attention as a matter of the objects 
remaining the same while attention is directed at them 
in this way or that like a beam of light, Gurwitsch 
recognizes three series of modifications of the object 
as thematized. First, a house-theme can be enlarged to 
become the-house-and-yard or it can be narrowed to 
omit the porch; similar constituents then play subtly 
different roles within the configurations. Second, the 
theme can become relevant to another theme -
e.g., 
the house as destination of the person approaching it, 
the house as merely on the margin as one thematizes 
a scientific problem while sitting on the porch -
or 
the house can disappear from the perceptual field. And 
in the third series, the thematized object is internally 
restructured, as when one ignores the color to consider 
the shape. 
Gurwitsch 's second use, developed further in The 
Field of Consciousness ( 1964 ), concerns the overall 
structure of what one is at any moment aware of. 
There is always a "theme" in the center with "gestalt-
connections" among its constituents, e.g., windows and 
doors, and there is always a "thematic field" composed 
of items that are "relevant" to the theme and thus also in 
gestalt-connections with it, but extra- rather than intra-
thematically, e.g., the perceived porch can move from 
a role within the theme to something "outside" and 
relevant to it. Various nonrelevant "marginal" items 
are also always objects of awareness, but with merely 
"and-connections" between them and the thematic and 
relevant items. Interestingly, the perceiver's own soov, 
stream of conscious life, and WORLD are always objects 
of awareness, at least marginally, for Gurwitsch. 
Examples of functional objects such as houses raise 
the question of whether this account of relevance only 
holds in the perspective of NATURALISM or whether it 
also pertains to a cultural analysis in which spatial, 
temporal, and causal relations also ha ve practica! char-
acteristics and even VALUES for the subject and thus 
more than the noematic nucleus is considered. This is 
significant because there is "indefinite continuation of 
context" that extends from any real theme to the whole 
cultural lifeworld, aspects of which are approached in 
various ways in the HUMAN SCIENCES and CULTURAL DIS-
CIPLINES. Such cultural characteristics are suspended to 
yield the naturalistic objects thematized in the NATURAL 
SCIENCES. 
Gurwitsch 's third and fourth uses of Gestalt psy-
chology pertain to the structure of the perceptual ob-
ject naturalistically considered. A physical thing can 
be seen from a fixed distance and angle, but one can 
also move closer, around, within, and in addition touch, 
smell, hear, and otherwise sensuously perceive it. For 
Husserl, it would be the same noema while appear-
ances grew larger upon the subject's approach, but for 
Gurwitsch the appearance is part and parcel ofthe per-
ceptual noema and there is a series of noemata in this 
case. Then again, as one walks around the physical 
thing, it ceases to present itselffrom the front and goes 
on to present itself from a side, the back, the other 
side, the front again, and actually from an infinity of 

280 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
standpoints along the way, i.e., there is again an infinite 
multiplicity of noemata. 
Husserl holds that each noema has an interna! refer-
ence to an "X" or object-pole so that the sameperceived 
thing or object might present itself in infinitely differ-
ent ways. Gurwitsch contends that no such reference 
to an X is discernible (and also, in a way that was fol-
lowed by JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, that there is no need for an 
EGO to organize, pay attention to, etc., what are already 
self-organizing constituents) and that the entire object 
presents itselffrom each point ofview as a structure or 
system of noemata, some of which are quite indeter-
minate, e.g., the arrangement of rooms within a house 
one has never entered, though the house is presented 
as having an inside arrangement of some sort. The 
structure of the object as system of noemata he calls 
"conformity to sense," asserting that "the total noe-
matic system must be of such a kind as to be capable 
ofreceiving the present perceptual noema as a part or 
member of itsel(." 
Finally, the unity ofthe stream of consciousness in 
TIME, with its expected, protended, impressional, retro-
tended, and recollected phases can be observed refiec-
tively to be configured: conscious life is also a gestalt. 
The constituents are the actualized as well as the fu ture 
and past inactual immanent noetic phases, and ifthere 
is gestalt-coherence and indeed "good continuation" to 
the structure, then "the mutual confirmation of single 
perceptions following upon each other in the course 
of the perceptual process is, we submit, the sufficient 
condition of the existence of material things." Gestalt 
psychology is thus ultimately useful in coNSTITUTIVE 
PHENOMENOLOGY for the purposes offirst philosophy. 
Maurice Merleau-Ponty attended Gurwitsch's lec-
tures at the Sorbonne, himself !ater taught psychol-
ogy there for some years, and drew extensively on 
Gestalt psychology in La structure du comportement, 
Phimonu?nologie de la perception (1945), and !ater 
works. Earlier, he refiects on form in physiology (and 
physics) and, most significantly, in instinctual, replace-
able (amovable), and symbolic structures ofbehavior, 
the Berlin school having long recognized gestalts in 
speaking, writing, singing, sketching, etc. He further-
more opposes the naturalistic and even physicalistic 
tendencies of Gestalt psychology, is quite aware ofthe 
transcendental philosophical implications of his own 
critique, and seems prepared along the way to recog-
nize the double signification of categoria! terms: "I f o ne 
understands perception as the act that makes us know 
existences, ali of the problems that we have touched 
upon lead back to problems ofperception. It resides in 
the duality ofthe notions of structure and signification. 
A 'form,' such as the 'figure-ground' structure, is a 
whole that has a sense and thus offers a bearing for 
intellectual analysis. But, at the same time, it is not an 
idea- it constitutes itself, changes, and reorganizes 
itselfbefore our eyes like a spectacle." 
Merleau-Ponty's second book can be interpreted, 
following the repeated1y cited "Objectivite en psy-
chologie" ( 1 932) of the French Gestaltist Paul Guil-
laume ( 1 887-1962), as chiefiy approaching ali the 
same phenomena as the first book, but through self-
observation rather than through the refiection on others 
dominant before. The emphasis (and use ofthe some-
what Gestaltist neurologist Kurt Goldstein [ 1878-
1 965]) is, if anything, more on the BODY: "In the last 
analysis, ifmybody can bea 'Gesta1t' and ifit can ha ve 
privileged figures on indifferent grounds before it, this 
is insofar as it is polarized by its tasks, that it exists 
toward them, that it collects itself in order to reach its 
goal, and the 'body image' is finally a way of express-
ing that my body is in the world." The appreciation 
of Gestalt psychology by EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY 
in FRANCE is also evident in the work of SIMONE DE 
BEAUVOIR and JEAN-PAUL SARTRE. 
Interest in the first or Graz school of Gestalt theory 
has recentJy reemerged in REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY, 
where gestalt qua1ities are subjected to analysis, along-
side other categories, in the framework of FORMAL AND 
MATERIAL ONTOLOGY. The volume recently edited by 
Barry Smith contains not only essays and translations 
but also a 250-page annotated bibliography, includ-
ing one item on 100 gestalt laws and others show-
ing how this set of eight schools, going back to the 
1920s, included social psycho1ogy within its scope. 
While Gestalt psychology may have declined in recent 
decades due to the infiuence ofbehaviorism and other 
historical circumstances, it has not died, and there are 
those who currently believe it has great affinities and 
thus future in reJation to ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and 
COGNITIVE SCIENCE. Much more USe of such Gestaltist 
work as that of Albert Michotte (1881-1 965) on per-
ceived causation can be made within phenomenologi-
cal philosophy and psycho1ogy.

In the first edition ( 1960) of 
his classical work The Phenomenological Movement, 
HERBERT SPIEGELBERG headed his account ofphenomen-
ology in Britain as follows: Great Britain: Low Ebb. 
He went on to say, "There can be little doubt that at 
the present moment, phenomenology, along with exis-
tentialism has less philosophical status in Britain than 
in any other country outside Soviet Russia. It has no 
spokesman in either Oxford or Cambridge, and but few 
sympathizers elsewhere." He further pointed out that 
some ofthe more explicit statements about phenomen-
ology revealed an animus rather than sheer indiffer-
ence, and quoted Gilbert Ryle's remark in Philosophy 
(1946 ): "I do not expect that even the corporate zeal 
ofthe International Phenomenological Institute (sic!), 
will succeed in winning for Husserl 's ideas much of a 
vogue in the English-speaking world. In short pheno-
menology was from its birth, a bare. Its oversolemnity 
of manner more than its equivocal lineage will se-
cure that its lofty claims are ignored." Nevertheless 
Ryle then waxed prophetic and said that an offshoot 
of phenomenology known as EXISTENTIALISM may be 
smuggled overseas in someone 's warming pan; he con-
tinued, MARTIN HEIDEGGER's "graft upon his master's 
former stock is not unlikely before long to be adam-
ing Anglo-Saxon philosophy." It has taken about thirty 
years for this prophecy to come true. 
Ryle did in his early years show a certain amount 
of sympathy for phenomenology, although he became 
highly critica! of it !ater on. There are indeed a sur-
prising number of parallels between EDMUND HUSSERL 's 
phenomenological analysis of mental acts and Ryle's 
philosophical psychology, particularly in the fields of 
PERCEPTION and IMAGINATION. During the J920s and 
1930s, Ryle was one of the few British philosophers 
to show an interes! in continental philosophy. Starting 
from the theories of Bertrand Russell, GOTTLOB FREGE, 
and Alexius Meinong (1853-1920), he went beyond 
them to look at the work of FRANZ BRENTANO, among 
others. He was particularly interested in Edmund 
Husserl 's Logische Untersuchungen (1900-190 1 ), as 
he found in it an extensive treatment of some of the 
logica! problems he had been concerned with. Aris-
ing from his studies of these writers, Ryle reported in 
his autobiographical essay that he offered a course of 
lectures at Oxford, which had as its title: "Logica! ob-
jectivism: Bolzano, Brentano, Husserl, and Meinong." 
However, this course did not attract any students. We 
are told that these faur philosophers become known in 
Oxford as "Ryle's three Austrian railway-stations and 
one Chinese game of chance." 
Ryle's opinion of Heidegger is expressed in his re-
view of Sein und Zeit(1927), where he says: "He shows

himself to be a thinker of real importance by the im-
mense subtlety and searchingness of his examination 
of consciousness, by the boldness and originality of 
his methods and conclusions, and by the unflagging 
energy with which he tries to think about the stock 
categories of orthodox philosophy and psychology." 
It is interesting to note here that the fundamental dis-
tinction that Ryle draws in the The Concept of Mind 
( 1949) between "knowing how" and "knowing that''-
between practica! and theoretical knowledge- bears 
a considerable resemblance to Heidegger's distinction 
in Sein und Zeit between Zuhandenheit (readiness-
to-hand) and Vorhandenheit (presence-at-hand). There 
was much importance attached to this distinction in 
Ryle's work before it became known in Britain that 
Heidegger had made a similar distinction some twenty 
years earlier. 
Phenomenology was not much cultivated as a sub-
ject in Britain between the two world wars. There were 
Husserl 's somewhat abortive London lectures in the 
early 1920s, followed by two Joint Session Symposia 
in 1932 and 1959 respectively. The 1932 symposium 
reads as if the symposiasts were discussing a piece of 
intellectual history, as if phenomenology had carne to 
a dead end. They could not, of course, have any fore-
knowledge of the !ater developments of phenomen-
ology, expecially its influence on philosophical thought 
in FRANCE and GERMANY after Wor]d War II. 
Over the past three decades, however, there has 
been a growing interest in Britain in both phenomen-
ology and existentialism, partly as a result of the writ-
ings of .JEAN-PAUL SARTRE and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, 
which have been read and discussed by specialists 
in the field of French studies as well as by philoso-
phers. Phenomimologie de la perception ( 1945) has 
even been read and discussed by analytic philosophers. 
Merleau-Ponty was invited to Manchester in 1958, 
where he gave a seminar on politics and delivered a 
lecture criticizing LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN's theory oflan-
guage. Indeed, in more than one university department 
of philososphy, students have pressed for courses on 
Sartre. As a consequence of this increased interest in 
the subject, some philosophers began to turn to the writ-
ings of Husserl and Heidegger upon which Merleau-
Ponty's and Sartre's writings were based. The work 
of the PoJish phi]osopher ROMAN INGARDEN, a pupi] of 
Husserl, also struck a note of sympathy in Britain. He 
visited Manchester in the early 1960s lecturing on aes-
thetic theory. 
At first Sartre's philosophy, no doubt because ofits 
literary qualities, attracted attention. Analytic philoso-
phers like Mary Warnock wrote introductions to his 
thought that sold well. Later Merleau-Ponty's works 
aroused interest, and then Husserl began to be read. 
But even up to about twenty years ago Heidegger was 
still regarded as a figure to be poked fun at. His onto-
logica! use of the notion of "nothingness" was taken 
as a textbook examplc of the philosophical misuse of 
language, to be cured by analysis. How, it was asked, 
can a syncategorematic word such as "not'' be used in 
categorematic way? 
Sin ce about 1980, however, this pic ture has changed 
again quite significantly. Contradicting Ryle's forecast 
about the imminent death of what we generally caii 
"Continental philosophy," this time has witnessed a 
major revival of interest in Continental philosophy by 
the phenomenological movement. This started with a 
number of new universities, namely the Universities 
of Essex, Sussex, and Warwick, which concentrated 
their graduate work exclusively on German idealism, 
phenomenology, CRITICAL THEORY, and contemporary 
French philosophy. Now there is a wide range of insti-
tutions having strong "Continental departments," from 
those already mentioned to other places like Middle-
sex University, the University of North London, the 
University of Wales in Cardiff, and Greenwich in the 
south, as well as Manchester Metropolitan University, 
Lancaster University, and the Bolton Institute in the 
northwest. Many other universities, like the University 
ofNottingham, offer a Master of Arts degree in cultural 
studies or critica! theory, in which phenomenology is 
taught. The University of Essex, through its Centre 
for European Philosophy; the University of Warwick, 
through its Centre for Philosophy and Literature; and 
Manchester Metropolitan University, through its newly 
proposed Centre for European Philosophy, are well 
placed to build on and develop this revival of pheno-
menology in Britain. Even the other universities, spe-
cializing in ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY, tend to empJoy more 
specialists in phenomenology than ever before. This 
trend, due to positive responses on the part of students, 
is still on the increase. Philosophers who have been 
the odd ones out at their institutions now see their sup-
port increasing. Still, there has been a positive side

to its isolation: during the 1980s Britain saw the de-
velopment of a Iively community of people interested 
in phenomenology. Scholars traveled from conference 
to conference, in search of discussions with compe-
tent colleagues working in their own field. Interest in 
Husserl 's philosophy has always continued in those 
aspects that deal with MFANING and with FORMAL ANO 
MATERIAL ONTOLOGY. These are important to the ana-
lytic community insofar as they relate to Frege's ideas 
ofmeaning and signification. Scholars in SOCIOLOGY, in 
particular, seem taken up with Husserl 's notion ofL!FE-
WORLD. Furthermore, there had always been a sustained 
interest in Sartre's existentialism, which has been re-
newed by the recent translation of Cahiers pour une 
morale [ 194 7]. And sti li, while aga in entering through 
the back door, this "second revival" ofphenomenology 
during the 1980s did not go back to the existentialist 
avant-garde. Having realized the change of generations 
in FRANCE, it rathcr built upon POSTMODERNISM. As can 
be seen in the programmatic title of a paper given by 
DAVID wooo in the late 1980s to a conference on de-
construction at the University of Warwick, it was first 
through the significant impact of the work of JACQUES 
DERRIDA and MICHEL FOUCAULT on American academia 
-
on literary theory and sociology respectively- that 
British philosophers rediscovered phenomenology on 
its own merits. This paper was called "Heidegger after 
Derrida" and, thus combining two philosophers highly 
inftuenced by Husserl, reftected in its title the upsurge 
of research in phenomenology. Although Heidegger 
has become the most inftuential author of this tradi-
tion, as could be seen in the interest given to the Hei-
degger debate in Germany and France, the revival of 
phenomenology has led to a diversified and sustained 
academic interest in Continental philosophy in general, 
mirrored by the foundation of societies, like the Sartre 
Society of Creat Britain and the Nietzsche Society, 
and in the many publications on Nietzsche, Husserl, 
Merleau-Ponty, Maurice Blanchot, EMMANUEL LEVINAS, 
Derrida, and even Georges Bataille. Nowadays books 
on Heidegger are even reviewed in such journals as 
the Times Literal)' Supplement and the Times Higher 
Education Supplement. 
AII the same, the British establishment remains 
more than skeptical. Oxford and Cambridge are vir-
tually frec from phenomenology as from Continental 
philosophy in general, while some other old univer-
sities even discourage their lecturers from teaching 
HEGEL, because, after ali, he is not a serious philoso-
pher. This state is reftected by a prominent publishing 
house recently turning down an offer for a volume on 
Merleau-Ponty contributing to their scries ofintroduc-
tions to the masters of philosophy, on the ground that 
it would not sell enough copies. 
Contemporary British philosophers of an analytic 
turn of mind are thus sti li suspicious of what they see 
as the metaphysical worries about life and the uni verse 
that some Continental philosophers, they claim, man-
ifest. They participatc in ORDINARY LANGUAGE PHILOSO-
PHY and believe that their own function is rather to deal 
with problcms of conceptual nature that ari se through 
our misuse of language. They go on to argue that once 
these problems are resolved, philosophy will cease to 
exist as a subject. In this climate it was necessary for 
phenomenologists to find a context for their research. 
lndeed, one ofthe reasons for starting the British Soci-
ety for Phenomenology arose from the fact that when 
Merleau-Ponty died in 1961, COLIN SMITH and WOLFE 
MAYS suggested to a certain British philosophical soci-
ety that it should have a symposium on his work. The 
idea was not rejected but politely noted. Some thirty 
years have now elapsed, but the symposium has never 
materialized. 
The manner in which the British Society for Pheno-
menology came into existence explains why its ini-
tial membership consisted of individuals drawn from 
a number of different disciplines- PSYCHIATRY, psy-
chology, sociology, university teachers of French, and 
the occasional philosopher of an independent mind. 
The situation is somewhat different today. There is 
a strong contingent of young philosophers trained in 
phenomenology, who are now members of the soci-
ety. And for better or worse the society has a much 
more profcssional look that it had at its inception. 
Since 1969, the society has had at least one confer-
ence a year, and usually a workshop on some spe-
cialized topic. The annual conference is usually at St. 
Edmunds Hali, Oxford, at Easter, where it is regarded 
as a Trojan horse planted in the center ofthe stronghold 
of analytic philosophy. Our first joint conference was 
held at Southampton in September 1969, in conjunc-
tion with the Royal Institute of Philosophy and with 
many participants from the Continent, under the title 
of "Philosophers into Europe." The proceedings were 

284 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
!ater published as the volume Linguistic Analysis and 
Phenomenology (1972). Furthermore, there have been 
a number of small specialized workshops at the Univer-
sities ofReading, Manchester, and Warwick. They ha ve 
covered such topics as STRUCTURALISM, reductionism, 
IMAGINATION, the phenomenology ofthe soov, and the 
works of Merleau-Ponty, Hegel, Husserl, and Heideg-
ger. The activities ofthe society ha ve not been confined 
solely to phenomenology. The society has provided a 
focus ofphilosophical interest lying outside the narrow 
field of academic philosophy. 
The Journal of the British Society for Phenomen-
ology, which is published in January, May, and October 
of each year, first appeared in January 1970 under the 
editorship of Wolfe Mays. While it orginially had no 
university or other subsidy and not even secretariat 
help, it is now based in the Institute of Advanced Stud-
ies at Manchester Metropolitan University. Some ofthe 
past numbers of the journal ha ve been devoted to defi-
nite themes, such as, for example, the phenomenology 
ofthe imagination, structuralism, and phenomenology 
and LITERATURE. Special issues have been devoted to 
the work of Husserl, Sartre, ARON GURWITSCH, ROMAN 
INGARDEN, Michael Poianyi, and MAX SCHELER. Whiie 
being among other things concerned to publish schol-
arly work relating to phenomenology, the journal has 
kept in touch with philosophical developments on the 
Continent through its correspondents living there. Our 
American friends have also helped us by informing 
us about trends in the UNITED STATES. To keep these 
links alive there have been articles on philosophy in 
GERMANY, FRANCE, SCANDINAVIA, and AUSTRIA. The jour-
nai has since its inception wished to stimulate interest 
in the phenomenological approach in HUMAN SCIENCES. 
We publish on such topics as the relation of pheno-
menology to SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHIATRY, and EDUCATION. 
We believe phenomenology has a special role to play 
in enriching these fields of inquiry. 
Despite the difficulties faced by phenomenologists 
in Britain, the future seems to bring hope. The num-
ber of Continental philosophers is on the increase and 
consequently the quality oftheir research is rising too.

ARON GURWITSCH 
Born January 1 7, 1901 
in Vilnius, Lithuania, as the son of a wealthy timber 
merchant who !ater lost his fortune due to World War 1 
and the Russian Revolution, Gurwitsch studied mathe-
matics, philosophy, physics, and psychology at Berlin, 
where he also became a protege of Cari Stumpf ( 1848-
1936). He was sent by Stumpf to study with EDMUND 
HUSSERL at Freiburg in 1922, where he was especially 
impressed not only by the dedication of the pheno-
menologist, but also by his lectures on Natur und Geist 
(Nature and spirit), a theme that emerged periodically 
in his own work during the next fifty years. 
Stumpf subsequently sent him to study the prob-
lem of abstraction with the psychiatrist Kurt Goldstein 
(1878-1965) at Frankfurt am Main, who was working 
brain-injured veterans. During a lecture at Frankfurt by 
the Gestaltist Adhemar Gelb ( 1887-1936), Gurwitsch 
had the insight that the abandonment in GESTALT PSY-
CHOLOGY of the constancy hypothesis, whereby phys-
ical stimuli had been assumed to be in a one-to-one 
correlation with sensations, was an incipient transcen-

285 
dentaJ EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION. Thereafter, Gurwitsch 
eJaborated a vers ion of CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 
that may be called "Gestalt phenomenology." 
In his dissertation accepted by MORITZ GEIGER and 
published in Psycho/ogische Forschung, the organ of 
the Gestalt school, under the title "Phanomenologie 
der Thematik und des reinen Ich" (Phenomenology of 
thematization and the pure ego, 1929), Gurwitsch pro-
ceeds in the perspective ofthe Husserl's Ideen zu einer 
reinen Phanomeno/ogie und phanomenologischen 
Philosophie 1 ( 1913), but includes the beginning of 
his objections to Husserl 's theory of hyletic data. Phe-
nomenologically, hy/e and m01phe are not concretely 
distinguishable in perceptual objects as they present 
themselves, and Gurwitsch suspected that Husserl had 
mistakenly modeled perception on linguistic compre-
hension. 
Furthermore, ifsensuous objects are always already 
structured or organized, then there is no need for a pure 
EGO to structure or organize them and, in any case, Gur-
witsch returned to the position of WILLIAM JAMES and the 
Husserl of the Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901) 
whereby no pure ego can be observed on the inward 
side of conscious life. This position was also taken 
by JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, possibly under the indirect influ-
ence ofGurwitsch, who afterwards published "A Non-
Egological Conception of Consciousness" ( 1941 ), the 
first essay on Sartre in English. 
Gurwitsch goes on in his dissertation positively to 
analyze the inherent structure of any field of conscious-
ness whatever into the focus or theme of conscious-
ness; the thematic fie1d of items relevant to the theme; 
and the margin of items devoid of relevancy to the 
theme. Then he carefully describes severa! ways in 
which themes can be restructured within perception 
and thus without need for a separate act of attention 
bestowing form upon them. This account is refined 
in !ater works including the posthumously published 
Marginal Consciousness [ 1953], where he shows at 
length that the margin always contains the perceptual 
WORLD, the stream of consciousness, and the BODY, at 
least two of which are always intended to in nonthe-
matic rather than thematic awareness (and ali three 
of which are nonthematically intended to when ideal 
objects are thematic ). 
Husserl was impressed with this dissertation, per-
sonal discussions ensued, and the phenomenologist 
was willing to habilitate Gurwitsch at Freiburg if he 
could not find a position elsewhere. By 1931 he had 
completed most of his Habilitationsschrift, Die mit-
menschlichen Begegnungen in der Milieuwelt (Human 
encounters in the social world, [ 1931 ]). This posthu-
mously edited work is devoted to the problem ofiNTER-
SUBJECTIVITY raised at the end of the dissertation and 
draws on ERNST CASSIRER with respect to how humans 
are originally encountered as animate and also MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER's Sein und Zeit (1927) with respect to the 
originally encountered practica! world of equipment. 
Gurwitsch had begun to search for an academic po-
sition when the National Socialists carne to power in 
1933 and his fellowship from the Prussian Ministry of 
Education was canceled because he was a Jew. He had 
previously read Mein Kampfand immediately left Ger-
many for France, where he initially knew hardly any-
one but eventually was in contact with everyone. The 
Habilitationsschrift was abandoned because it would 
take too long to complete, adapt for the new philo-
sophica1 situation, and translate, and because ALFRED 
SCHUTZ's Der sinnhafte Aufbau der sozialen Welt (The 
meaningful structure of the social world, 1932), to 
which Husserl had drawn Gurwitsch 's attention, had-
although differently- begun the constitutive pheno-
menology ofthe HUMAN SCIENCES very well. 
In Paris, Gurwitsch soon met MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY, who then attended his lectures at the Sorbonne 
and helped to polish the expression on two of his 
French publications; the younger man had previously 
read Gurwitsch 's dissertation and !ater learned of the 
work of Goldstein and Gelb from him. Gurwitsch was 
pleased at his influence and reviewed Phhwnu!nologie 
de la perception ( 1945) twice. 
Gurwitsch 's pub1ications while in FRANCEare chiefly 
devoted to PSYCHOLOGY and the PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOL-
OGY-"La place de la psychologie dans 1 'ensemble des 
sciences" ( 1934) and "Quelques aspects et quelques 
developpements de la psychologie de la forme" ( 1936), 
the latter based on his first set of lectures at the Sor-
bonne, being the most significant. But a critica! study 
on the psychology oflanguage includes the first pheno-
menological appreciation of phonological linguistics, 
also known as STRUCTURALISM. 
Before he left Paris Gurwitsch was again well 
along in preparing a book manuscript, this one based 
on another set of his Sorbonne lectures and entitled 

286 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
L 'esquisse de la phenomenologie constitutive (Outline 
of constitutive phenomenology). Also abandoned due 
to politica! events and the exigencies of moving to yet 
another new country, this 1939 text has also been edited 
posthumously. It relates phenomenology to the modern 
tradition and continues the development of "Gestalt 
phenomenology." Along the way, and quite interest-
ingly, it distinguishes the NATURAL SCIENCES from the 
HUMAN SCIENCES in terms of whether the "functional 
characters" characteristic of cultural objects are ab-
stracted from or not. 
Gurwitsch always looked back on his time in France 
as his most creative, returning practically every sum-
mer in the 1950s and 1960s and continuing to publish 
there, but his early postwar attempts to find an aca-
demic position in the happiest stopping place in a life 
of forced wandering was unsuccessful. 
Gurwitsch arrived in the America in 1940 as a 
refugee from the Nazis for the second time. He had 
finally met Schi.itz in Paris in 1937. Alfred Schutz, Aran 
Gurwitsch: Briefivechsel, 1939-1959 (The correspon-
dence of Alfred Schutz and Aron Gurwitsch, 1985) 
documents their intellectual interaction and friendship 
as isolated representatives of a philosophy still alien 
in America. A division of labor arose between them 
whereby Schutz worked in the philosophy ofthe human 
or cultural sciences and Gurwitsch in the philosophy of 
logic, mathematics, natural sciences, and psychology. 
Gurwitsch only wrote again about the human sciences 
after Schutz had died. Schutz observed that Gurwitsch 
began with sensuous perception while he himself be-
gan with MUSIC. They disagreed about the ego and also 
about transcendental phenomenology, Schutz advocat-
ing the CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE NATURAL 
ATTITUDE. Even their theories of relevance are different. 
Nevertheless, they believed themselves to be digging 
a single tunnel from two si des of the same mountain. 
They also played leading ro les in the founding of the 
journal Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 
and ofthe ill-fated International Phenomenological So-
ciety just before World War II. 
Living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Gurwitsch 
held one-year jobs, received small grants, and taught 
physics and mathematics for a decade. Eventually he 
secured his first full-time continuing position in phi-
losophy in 1951 at Brandeis University when he was 
fifty years old. Meanwhile, Schutz -
who had also 
emigrated to the United States in 1940 and joined the 
Graduate Faculty of Politica! and Social Science at 
the New School for Social Research in 1943 -
had 
plans for forming a center for phenomenology, bring-
ing DORION CAIRNS there after FELIX KAUFMANN died, 
and making severa! attempts to bring Gurwitsch, who 
finally carne in 1959 as Schutz's successor. At the New 
School, Gurwitsch taught graduate students, and those 
whose work he directed include LESTER EMBREE, ROBERT 
JORDAN, FRED KERSTEN, WILLIAM R. MCKENNA, GIUSEPPINA 
MONET A, GILBERT T. NULL, OSBORNE WIGGINS, and RICHARD 
M. ZANER. 
Gurwitsch was also a leader in the second and 
more successful attempt at founding phenomenology 
in the UNITED STATES. "The Last Work of Edmund 
Husserl" ( 1956--57) is a long, two-part critica! study of 
Husserl 's Die Krisis des europăischen Wissenschafien 
und die transzendentale Phânomenologie ( 1936) that 
accurately presents that work and challenges the then 
common view that Husserl had turned to EXISTENTIAL 
PHENOMENOLOGY in the end. During the founding ofthe 
Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philoso-
phy in 1962, Gurwitsch was in particular responsible 
for the duality within that name. Overall, during the 
1960s he functioned as the grand old man of Ameri-
can phenomenology. In reaction to the student revolts 
of that decade, he urged a return "to the desks them-
selves." Besides his participation in French pheno-
menology Gurwitsch also helped in the restoration 
of phenomenology in GERMANY after the war, almost 
accepting a caii to Berlin and serving as a Fulbright 
professor at Koln in 1958-59, where he drafted his 
posthumously published Kants Theorie des Verstehens 
(Kant's theory of understanding, 1991 ). 
Gurwitsch 's magnum opus, The Field of"Conscious-
ness, was begun soon after he fled to America, but was 
first published in French translation in 1957 because 
an American publisher for a work in phenomenology 
could still not be found, the original finally appearing 
in English in 1964. After relating phenomenology to 
William James and various dualistic theories of per-
ception -
Husserl's included- he offers probably 
the best systematization of Gestalt theory; presents 
his version of constitutive phenomenology, including 
his Gestalt-phenomenological account of sensuous per-
ception; and sketches an ontology involving ideal and 
real "orders of existence," each with its own relevancy

principle. The "perceptual world"- which is actually 
also cultural and sometimes called the "lifeworld," and 
which has the objective time into which ali biogra-
phies and history find their places as its principle-
is the paramount reality of everyday life and includes 
familial, politica!, professional, and other "spheres of 
Jife" within itse]f. JAMES M. EDIE, JOSEPH J. KOCKELMANS, 
and HERBERT SPIEGELBERG, who were a]so becoming in-
fluentiaJ, immediately responded favorably, the latter 
in The Phenomenological Movement ( 1960) caii ing it 
"the most substantial original work produced by a Eu-
ropean phenomenologist in the United States." 
While at the New School, Gurwitsch published 
Studies in Phenomenology and Psychology ( 1966), 
which retrospectively includes eighteen essays from 
thirty-sevcn years and handsomely contextualizes The 
Field o(Consciousness. He also spent much ofhis last 
decade preparing Leibniz: Philosophie des Panlogis-
mus ( 1974 ). (Husserl's daughter once asked him how 
important her father had been and Gurwitsch replied 
"the greatest since Leibniz.") A different series of es-
says on physics, mathematics and logic, psychology, 
and the human sciences became chapters in Pheno-
menology and the Theory of Science (1974). Included 
there is his "Perceptual Coherence as the Foundation 
of the Judgment of Predication," which is his attempt 
to correct Husserl 's Er(ahrung und Urteil ( 1939). Gur-
witsch had planned to write Reality and Logic during 
his retirement. He became emeritus in 1972, and died 
June 25, 1973. Thcre was a Festschrift in 1972 and 
there ha ve been two memorial volumes thus far. 
While others would begin theoretically with phys-
ical objects and then consider cultural characteristics, 
animation, and attentional form as somehow added to 
them, Gurwitsch bcgins with cultural objects thema-
tized in the practica! attitude, some of which are from 
the outset animate. He then seeks how the cultural, for-
mal, and natural sciences originale in sociohistorical 
or lifeworldly experience. Unlike many phenomenolo-
gists, Gurwitsch follows Husserl in seeking a transcen-
dental grounding of science. In addition, and more than 
any other phenomenologist, he emphasizes analysis of 
the NOE MA. Then again, however, and contrary to most 
self-identified phenomenologists, Gurwitsch expends 
little energy in the interpretation of phenomenologi-
cal texts, but rather chiefly produces reflective analy-
ses of phenomena. He was among the very el o sest of 
Husserl 's followers, and not least for his critica! revi-
sions ofhis master's doctrines in the light ofthe matters 
themselves.

NICOLAI HARTMANN 
Hartmann (1882-
1 950) was educated in Riga, Latvia, his birthplace, 
and St. Petersburg (sometimes Leningrad), where he 
graduated from Gymnasium in 1901. He then studied 
medici ne at Tartu in Estonia and classical philology in 
St. Petersburg before taking his doctorate in philosophy 
at Marburg in Germany. There his academic career be-
gan with intensive work on ancient philosophy, includ-
ing his doctoral dissertation ( 1 907) under Hermann Co-
hen ( 1 842-1 9 1 8) and Paul Natorp ( 1 854--1 924) as well 
as Platos Logik des Seins (Plato's logic ofbeing, 1909), 
his Habilitationsschrift. But starting in 1912 his chief 
concerns shifted to epistemology, and there ensued a 
struggle against the logica! idealism of the Marburg 
school and against the general neo-Kantian approach. 
He acknowledged the work of EDMUND HUSSERL and 
MAX SCHELER tobe the contemporary inftuence that was 
decisive for this shift in his thinking. There seems little 
doubt that the inftuence went chiefty through study of 
Husserl's Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900--1901) and 
Scheler's Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die ma-
teriale Wertethik (Formalism in ethics and nonformal 
ethics of value, 1 9 1 3/19 1 6). He served during World 
War I in the German army on the eastern front from 
1914 to 1919, beginning work on his monumental Ethik 
( 1 925) in the trenches during the winter of 1916-1 7. 
Hartmann 's decisive rejection ofneo-Kantian idealism 
became public in the first work to be publishcd from 
this period, Grundzuge einer Metaphysik der Erken-
ntnis (Fundamental characteristics of a metaphysics of 
knowledge, 192 1 ), appearingjust after he succceded to 
the chair that Natorp had held at Marburg. This work 
declared his affinities with the results being achieved by 
phenomenologists, to whom he referred as his nearest 
philosophical neighbors. In the Marburg years, MAR-
TIN HEIDEGGER and Hartmann were close friends who 
often visited each other's family and discussed philos-
ophy. After Hartmann transferred to the University of 
Koln in 1925, his relationship with Scheler, whom he 
considered to ha ve become the leader in the phenomen-
ological movement, was close until the latter's death in 
1928. There also seems to ha ve been some contact with 
members of ALEXANDER PFĂNDER 's Munich group, in-
cluding MORITZ GEIGER. Hartmann transferred to a chair 
at Berlin in 1931 and to Gottingen in 1945. No con-
tacts are reported with other acknowledged members 
ofthe phenomenological movement between Scheler's 
death and his own on October 9, 1950. Still, there are 
very good reasons to count his works among the finest 
examples of REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY. 
Many of the affinities with and divergences from 
Husserl 's phenomenology are made quite clear even 
in Hartmann's Grundzuge. With Husserl he relies on 
EIDETIC METHOD and affirms that there are universal 
essences ("essentialities," Wesenheiten) and that they 
are transcendent, i.e., their way of being- which he 
terms "ideality" and contrasts with the way of being 
("reality") of whatever exists individually and tempo-
rally- is not that ofthought. Hartmann 's last writings 
affirm this position and its centrality to any adequate 
ontology and epistemology with no less emphasis than 
the 1921 book did. He is equally emphatic in assert-
ing that there are species of intuition through which 
such essentialities are given so that- since universals 
are transcendent rather than immanent- acquaintance 
with any ofthem is acquired. 
However, in line with other realistic phenomenol-
ogists and many interpretations -
more likely mis-
interpretations- of Heidegger, he insisted that ways 
of being given belong only to objects ( Gegenstande), 
whereas entities- whether real or ideal- as such are 
not essentially objects, but are "transobjective." The 
limits to what can be made an object and to what can 
be known are "gnoseological" (cognitive) limits; they 
do not coincide with those ofwhat there is. As such, a 
being ofwhatever kind is indifferent to whether it is or 
is not cognizable. Beings as such are affected by these 
limits neither in their quiddity nor in their being. 
Hartmann believed that the phenomenology of 
Husserl and Heidegger misconceived these limits when 
it proposed as a basic thesis that every being must ha ve 
some way of"showing itself." The correlation of noe-
sis and NOEMA that Husserl had asserted as an a priori 
principle becomes false when it is elevated to the sta tus 
of an ontologica! principle rather than one having its 
legitimate place in gnoseology or epistemology. Hart-

mann's necessitarian conception of real being made 
it impossible to conceive that a real entity, especially 
a material one, could have inherent ways in which it 
might be given even when it is not actually given. The 
real entity that is known must remain indifferent to, 
"untouched by," being known. Even in the case of an 
evidently true judgment where the entity as judged 
about (the abject, which is essentially relative to the 
judging) is itself given, this objectcannot coincide with 
(be identica! with) the entity in its transobjective status. 
Thus Hartmann is led back from the innovative view 
of Husserl and Heidegger toward a variation on the 
traditional representional theory ofknowledge with an 
accompanying conception of truth as correspondence. 
The possibility remains open that this divergence 
arose through a terminological misunderstanding fairly 
common in the literature on Husserl. It is clear that 
Hartmann employs "object" with a meaning closely 
akin to the way in which it is used in a long tradi-
tion, extending back at least to KANT. In this sense ali 
objects are cognizable or knowable since they are es-
sentially related to a knowing subject: they arise only 
in the synthesis of intuition and concept. This use of 
the term then carries over into post-Kantian idealism 
and into various schools of anti-intellectualist thought: 
vitaJistic (WILHELM DILTHEY, HENRI BERGSON); existen-
tial (Kierkegaard, KARL JASPERs); and voluntaristic 
(Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, WILLIAM JAMES). Hartmann 
tends to treat the theory of objects of Alexius Meinong 
(1853-1920) separately from Husserl 's phenomen-
ology and may have overlooked the affinity between 
the two. Husserl uses the word in such a way that x is 
an object ifthere is anything at ali that can be truly said 
ofx. This use would imply that the statement, "Entities 
in their transobjective status are not objects," is non-
sensical. The unity of ali objects rather than that of 
al! entities would then be the all-inclusive (absolute) 
unity. 
Hartmann, however, maintains that contact with the 
entity about which knowledge is gathered gives rise to 
a new immanent formation (Gebilde), one belonging 
to the realm of mental entities, the "idea" of tradi-
tional epistemology, which he also termed the "im-
age." The basic error of idealism is to identify this 
mental structure with the entity itself. Such immanent 
mental structures intend or represent entities through 
a phenomenon, the entity as intended. To think that 
this phenomenon might ever be the represented entity 
itself is an error, he thinks, no less serious than that 
of idealism. It appears to be the error of those whom 
he calls "the phenomenologists."Rejecting the "correl-
ativistic prejudice" leads Hartmann to his view that 
"being-in-itself' is not a strictly ontologica! concept. 
This appears to be the conclusion that led to his de-
cisive break with neo-Kantianism, and he found it to 
be greatly facilitated by the account of categorialform 
in Husserl 's phenomenology. A person p 's knowing an 
entity x is a relationship in which being-an-object-for-
p belongs to the abject of cognition, x as cognized, not 
to x in its transobjective status, which is presupposed 
by the knowledge relationship. "Being-in-itself' is the 
categoria! form ofthe phenomena through which x as it 
is "announces itself" in the knowledge-relation. Epis-
temology (gnoseology, phenomenology), not ontology, 
needs the form "being-in-itself' to differentiate objects 
of knowledge from mere objects of belief. Being as 
such, however, is not given primarily through doxic or 
cognitive acts, but pre-objectively (pre-categorially). 
That there are real entities that may correspond to phe-
nomena is indicated but not convincingly established 
by what can be known about them. Cognition can ex-
plicate what has been given in a noncognitive way, but 
the interpretation will never be immune to skepticism. 
Here Hartmann adopts a position closely akin to 
FICHTE's way of differentiating between what can be 
known and what can be shown only by the .feeling 
(necessarily obscure self-perception) inherent in voli-
tions or deeds. This sort of feeling shows the ground 
for faith, as Fichte termed it, in the reality of the nat-
ural and moral world order that is presupposed by ali 
volition. Voluntary strivings are the most prominent 
in the class of "emotionally transcendent acts," which 
include ali intercourse with persons and dealings with 
things, striving, desires, suffering, action, willing, and 
moods. Ali of these, not just the strivings emphasized 
by Fichte, involve the feeling of affecting or being 
affected by reality. 
"Reality" is Hartmann 's term for the way in which 
actual, i.e., temporal, individual thi11gs exist. It is the 
o11ly perfect, full way of bei11g. Idealities (esse11tiali-
ties), 011 the other hand, are no11temporal but 11011-self-
sufficie11t; they exist o11ly by being contained in real 
e11tities. Ideal bei11gs are, however, 110 less "tra11sobjec-
tive" tha11 real e11tities are. Thus despite the contrast be-

290 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
tween the way realities and essentialities are, Hartmann 
held ~in accord with Aristotle and with the idealism 
that he himself otherwise emphatically opposed ~ 
that 
real individuals have ideal essences as really inherent 
constituents. He seems to have been unaware that this 
position is contradictory to that of Husserl. Quite like 
Kant and very much in line with the mathematization of 
nature, the conception in Galilean science that material 
nature is mathematical in structure, Hartmann recog-
nized only two kinds of ideal entities: mathematical 
structures on the one hand and values (Kant's princi-
ples of practica! reason) on the other. This is one ofthe 
clearest indications that Hartmann conceived what he 
called "phenomenology" exclusively from within what 
Husserl termed the natural attitude as an objective sci-
ence of the subjective and of subjcctively relative phe-
nomenona. 
Although it is apparently acknowledged that there 
is a difference in degree ofbeing between essentialities 
and realities, there are no degrees of being within the 
sphere of reali(v. The concept of reality must encom-
pass material and immaterial traits. The actual world 
has a single unitary mode of reality: it is an error to 
think that spirit or soul has a preeminent mode of be-
ing, and it would be equally mistaken to attribute such 
preeminence to the material realm. Spirit has the pre-
eminence ofthe highest stratum ofbeings but not that 
of a higher mode ofbeing. The single, unitary realm of 
real entities is stratified in the graduation ofits forms of 
being, but its constituents are equally existent. The ex-
istence and reality ofthe spiritual stratum is not some-
how paler or weaker than the mode of being of the 
lower strata. The basic modallaw for the actual world 
is that the reality-character, as such, of actual entities 
neither diminishes nor increases as the highest stratum 
is approached. That the mental or spiritual traits of a 
person belong to a higher stratum than the person 's or-
ganic traits means that the former traits presuppose, are 
founded upon and dependent upon, the latter and that 
these limit the range ofthe mental traits the person can 
acquire. Higher traits are always "weaker" and lower 
ones "stronger," but only in that the higher are condi-
tioned by, dependent on, lower ones while the reverse 
is not the case. This "law of strength" is the most basic 
law for ali categories of real things. 
From the point of view of fundamental ontology, 
existence is common to the material, the vital, the psy-
chic, and the spiritual. To deny this commonality of 
existence is to deny existence in a shared reality, indi-
viduality, and temporality. Though ali real cntities are 
equally real and equally individual, Hartmann differ-
entiates the existence of any real entity from its reality. 
Only what is individual and singular and characterizes 
each real entity as individual is said to exist. Even the 
traits an individual has in common with other individu-
als are real, but only the individual as such, as distinct 
from ali other individuals, is said to exist. Existence of 
any real entity is higher in determinateness and way of 
being than is any of the "essences" it has in common 
with othcr entities. Existence depends on reality since 
an entity's existence is subject absolutely to whatever 
laws apply to ali entities ofthe same kinds. 
Nevertheless, every real entity is perf'ectly real, in-
dividual, and existent. Things are no less perfectly ex-
istent than persons are. Things and persons exist differ-
ently, but they do indeed exist together in one existing 
world, and existence itsell is perf'ectly alike in each 
case. Thus Hartmann appears to use "to exist" and re-
lated terms in a way quite different from the usage of 
existential thinkers such as Kierkegaard, Jaspers, and 
Heidegger. Moreover, he seems quite willing to ignore 
whatever prohibition Heidegger's conception of "on-
tologica! difference" entails against saying of a world 
either that it is or that it exists. 
The minds or spirits of vital, living individuals do 
indeed have essential traits, but a living spirit "is" not 
the set of such traits. lts individuality can neither be 
canceled nor "auf'gehoben," however much it may be 
considered in abstraction. Thus Hartmann rejects ide-
alistic attempts to conceive the egos of vital persons 
as forms that have "in themselves" an ideal way of 
being, and he clearly attributes such a conception to 
Husserl. Although each vital person is "subject to" its 
essential traits, bound by whatever essential laws they 
entail, sti li, each is unique and individual in the stric test 
sense of that word. The individuality of every person 
is incomparably richer than that of other material and 
organic entities and occurrences. 
Insofar as human persons ha ve a historical and cul-
tural being, they take part in an objective spirit as 
well as being vital spirits. Historical-cultural being is 
a higher being-stratum than that of organic reality and 
involves personal beings of a higher order than organic 
personal being. Such a spirit Hartmann characterizes 

N!COLAI HARTMANN 
291 
rather inadequately as that which is common to ali its 
members. Thus objective spirit is formed through the 
reality of its members (in contrast to their existence). 
Every objective spirit is, however, an individual in 
its own right, having its own existence distinct from 
but dependent upon and conditioned by their reality. 
Hartmann agrees with holistic conceptions of commu-
nity and society. Nevertheless, he emphatically rejects 
HEGEL 's conception according to which higher order, 
collective persons are universal entities who gener-
ate their human members, whose reality is therefore 
thought to depend on that of the objective spirit. An 
objective spirit is not exhausted by what is common to 
ali its vital members. lts way of being is nevertheless 
not ideality but reality. Each has its time and is quite as 
singular and unique as each member is. The individ-
uality of a structure is independent of the structure's 
order ofmagnitude. Moreover, a one-sided dependence 
of vital spirits on objective, collective ones would be 
contrary to the categoriallaw of strength. 
From the two ways of being, Hartmann differenti-
ates modes of being (Seinsmodi): possibility and ac-
tuality, necessity and contingency, and impossibility 
and non-actuality ( Unwirklichkeit). The "incompara-
ble richness" ofhuman existence vis-a-vis nonpersonal 
organisms and things has to do with the distinctive 
mode of being of vital persons and the freedom that 
this mode of being allows. Acknowledging that the 
will of persons is free is compatible with many forms 
of determinism, in the sense of wiLLIAM JAMES, i.e., the 
acknowledgment that freedom does not require really 
possible alternatives to choose from. It does, however, 
require denial of determinism in Sir William Hamil-
ton 's ( 1788-1856) sense ofthe word (naturalistic deter-
minism). It requires that there be occurrences that Hart-
mann dubs "incompletely real." Reality is the sphere 
ofbeing to which belong entities whose real possibil-
ity coincides with their real necessity: their possibility 
to be excludes the possibility not to be. There can be 
no possibilities that have not been and none that will 
not be actualized. Hartmann 's necessitarian doctrine is 
more consistent than that of John Stuart Miii. Whereas 
Miii thought that his ontology might tolerate unactu-
alized "possibilities of sensation," Hartmann will ha ve 
none of them. There are, however, entities whose real 
being is not just natural, whose real being is not sub-
ject merely to natural necessity. The necessity of ali 
real being does not imply uniform determinism for 
the world, but rather allows for a layering of differ-
ent forms of determination: the ought-to-be, artworks, 
and self-actualization ( Venvirklichung). This layering 
or stratification is what allows the distinctive sorts of 
autonomy prevailing in each stratum of real beings. 
The voluntary activities ofpersons generate the spir-
itual, a novel stratum of real being compared to real 
entities that are merely psychophysical. Volitions are 
free in a negative as well as in a positive sense. Only 
through them- so far as we know- do values have 
an effect on the actual course of events. VALUEs are laws 
or principles to which any entity conforms insofar as it 
"ought tobe." As principles ofwhat ought tobe, values 
are not indifferent to real being. However, real being 
and laws that describe merely what may, does, or must 
become real are indifferent to values and to what ought 
to be. Values exert a teleological causation involving 
an emotional awareness on the part of a potential agent 
that there are conditions or requirements tobe fulfilled 
if some value is tobe realized or "satisfied." Involved 
in this awareness is awareness of a tension or disparity 
between what is understood to be real and what ought 
to be real. More to the point, it involves an awareness 
of a disparity between what ought to become real and 
what will become or is likely to become real unless 
something happens tofavor what ought to occur. 
Through such awareness, values indicate to a po-
tential agent that something ought tobe done (a duty), 
though this is not true of ali the values agents sense. 
Values thereby make positive freedom possible, taking 
part in the generation of vital spiritual existence and of 
"imperfectly real" entities whose generation involves 
efficacy on the part of ideal values rather than being de-
termined exclusively by natural causes. A living being 
who is tobe an agent must therefore ha ve such traits as 
consciousness, resolute activity, energy, foresight, and 
purposive efficacy. Hartmann refers to this tension as 
"the ought-to-be of spontaneity or activity" (aktuales 
Seinsollen). Through it, values may be said to caii for 
there to be vital beings in the world who are also spir-
itual -
beings who are there through their ACTIONs. 
Through their act ion in the cause of values they ha ve 
positive freedom. 
On the other hand, the plurality of ideal values and 
their demands or requirements always allows negative 
freedom, i.e., choice and commitment in fa vor of some 

292

and against others- the positive and meritorious du-
ties in Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten 
( 1785). The traits required of potential agents there-
fore include the resolve to risk guilt. That there ought 
to be spontaneous action in the world requires, on the 
one hand, the real being of persons in communities of 
objective spirit and on the other hand, calls upon each 
spiritual being through its existence -
whether vital 
or objective- to take part resolutely in the creation of 
the world.

GEORG WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL (1770--1831) 
Broadly speaking, phenomenology can be character-
ized first of ali as EDMUND HUSSERL 's descriptive and 
interpretive approach to MEANING, which is the inten-
tiona! content of conscious life. It provides an ongo-
ing clarification of meaning in order to abide by the 
"matters themselves." The phenomenology of MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER discloses the meaning of Being as it onto-
logically and "proto-existentially" impends on human 
Jife. And MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY examines the BODY 
as a human being's pre-objective yet intentionally lived 
experience ofwhat is already there, enabling a human 
being to carry out tasks and projects as stable public be-
haviors in the world, thereby making personal identity 
unique and non-consignable. 
In contrast, Hegel's phenomenological program, as 
presented in his 1807 Phănomenologiedes Geistes, has 
never given anyone the slightest impression that it is 
concerned with meaning or sense. Yet with the excep-
tion of Husserl, many 20th century phenomenologists 
ha ve explicitly approached Hegel 's Phănomenologie 
in either of two ways: (a) by claiming that certa in as-
pects ofhis program are continuous with or have con-
tributed to their considerations of topics such as the 
practica] engagement with the WORLD, INTERSUBJECTIV-
ITY, the unconscious ofPSYCHOANALYSIS, and bad faith; 
or (b) by emphasizing that there are critica! differences 
between Hegel's project and their own. 
Phenomenologists in FRANCE are representative of 
the first position. In general terms, they are critica! of 
Hegel's gaal of"absolute knowledge," the identity of 
thought and Being, which they re gard as spirit's totaliz-
ing comprehension of some first-order truth about what 
there is. They thus reproach Hegel for what appears to 
be the organizing principle for his Phănomenologie, 
viz., his so-called metaphysical monism, because, as 
phenomenologists, their primary philosophical inter-
es!, allegedly unlike Hegel 's, is not the coherence of an 

GEORG WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL 
293 
intellectual system establishing a supersensible entity 
(Divine Mind) that both explains and coincides with 
the sensible or historical world. Rather, their concern 
is to render explicit the meaning or meanings ofthe pre-
theoretical or pre-reflective experience of phenomena 
that are for the most part tacit and unthematized. 
Nonetheless, phenomenologists representative of 
the first position ha ve gone to Hegel 's Phanomenologie 
for various themes or conclusions. Notice that what-
ever is selected from the Phănomenologie is presup-
posed to have an intelligibility independent of the 
alleged monistic context of spirit's self-knowledge. 
However, the consequence of separating themes in the 
Phănomenologie from the text's "movement" is a vio-
lation of Hegel 's express objections to such a separa-
tion. 
So Maurice Merleau-Ponty finds themes in Hegel's 
Phănomenologie attuned to an EXISTENTIALISM that 
is open to the movement of HISTORY, fitting for the 
contingencies of human ACTION, yet ill suited for 
the movement of thought's totalizing comprehension. 
The interplay of life, desire, struggle, recognition, 
death, and unhappiness -
these ali originating from 
the Phănomenologie -
becomes the foca! point for 
Merleau-Ponty to reveal that human subjectivity is not 
initially a consciousness in ample possession of clar-
ity and distinctness of thought, but a life to be lived 
through in the face ofthe world and other human sub-
jects and in ways in which difficult conditions are con-
fronted or evaded. 
This agrees with his concern for an account ofmean-
ing that is primarily explicated through PERCEPTION and 
the lived body. Yet Hegel's account ofperception of-
fers no help in such an explication. It does not offer a 
phenomenological description ofwhat it means for hu-
man beings to follow what is experientially significant 
in perception. Instead, Hegel describes the pitfalls of 
a philosophical theory claiming that individual objects 
can be identified through perception alone as instanti-
ating universal properties. 
For Merleau-Ponty, on the other hand, perceptual 
meanings are rooted in a spatio-temporal network of 
experience and hence dependent on a given experien-
tial context, i.e., they are bound to SPACE, TIME, his-
tory, and culture. They delineate the manner in which 
the object is presented in perception as already mean-
ingful and as tied in varying degrees to a network of 
other objects and experiences as well as to the inter-
ests and desires ofthe perceiver. The same can be said 
of the lived BODY since, for Merleau-Ponty, not only 
is the lived body an expressive and cultural object, 
but also his account of such a body is already his ac-
count of perception. Both are meaningful structures 
of behavior in an experiential context, and in terms 
of its aisthetic (from aisthesis or sensory perception) 
and practica! (pre-theoretical) engagements with the 
world the lived body is indistinguishable from the life 
of perceptual consciousness. For Merleau-Ponty, this 
phenomenological characterization of perception and 
the lived body has primacy over any scientific char-
acterization that theoretically severs them from these 
structures and context. 
Thus although Hegel's account of perception it-
self does not aid Merleau-Ponty's, separating the 
Phănomenologie from a metaphysics of(divine) spirit 
or from the "logica!" or "scientific" categories of 
Hegel 's system, together with cuii ing certain themes 
from the Phănomenologie, does enable him to recast 
Hegel's phenomenological program as an exploration 
ofhuman beings' practica! engagements with the world 
and their forming ofmeanings in contact with experi-
ence, subsequently modifying that experience by the 
meanings discovered therein. Understood in this fash-
ion, "phenomenology," Merleau-Ponty claims, "can be 
practiced and identified as a manner or style of think-
ing, [existing] as a movement before arriving at com-
plete awareness ofitselfas philosophy.lt has been long 
on the way, and its adherents have discovered it in ev-
ery quarter, certainly in Hegel and Kierkegaard, but 
equally in Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud." 
Clearly, PAUL RIC<:EUR would agree with Merleau-
Ponty's remark. Like him, Rico::ur separates Hegel's 
project from the metaphysics oftotalizing comprehen-
sion that allegedly is "absolute knowledge." He then 
interprets it as a phenomenological program emphasiz-
ing the practica! engagements ofhuman beings with the 
world. But unlike Merleau-Ponty, Rico::ur underscores 
the reflective activity that Hegel claims human beings 
bring to those engagements. In this sense, for Rico::ur, 
it becomes impossible to construe a human being's 
practica! engagements and his or her pre-reflective ex-
perience as being of one swath. Furthermore, and aga in 
following Hegel, the development of reflective activity 
comes for Rico::ur by understanding human subjectivity 

294 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
not as "consciousness," but rather as "spirit." "Spirit" 
is Hegel 's technical term for intersubjectively framed 
objective existence. It constitutes and depends on a 
human being's reflective attending to his or her own 
engagements in the world and with others (as well as his 
or her judgments about such matters) in a manner that 
is inseparable from his or her own reflective attending 
to him- or herself as one human being among others 
who likewise are reflectively attending to their engage-
ments and to themselves as intersubjective beings. Ac-
cord ing to Rica:ur, only spirit can accommodate the 
development of reflection, and it thus establishes re-
flection 's proper boundaries. Rica:ur's attention to the 
development of reflcction in and through spirit allows 
him to focus on such Hegelian themes as the ethical 
order, culture, evil, and forgiveness. And these in turn 
point to other matters with which Rica:ur has been 
concerned -
namely, the symbolism of evil, RELI-
GION, and faith. However, these interests, along with 
Rica:ur's developments ofHERMENEUTICS and Freudian 
PSYCHOANALYSIS, focus upon pre-reflective or uncon-
scious reality and speak, for him, to his concems about 
the limits of reflective consciousness in grasping and 
making wholly transparent subjectivity's practica) en-
counters in the world. In ali these areas, reflective 
consciousness runs up against the "problem of double 
meaning" in which expressions mean one thing while 
simultaneously meaning something else. Confronting 
this problem, human reflection can never make mean-
ing transparent. It constantly succumbs to meaning's 
multiplicity, and as a consequence, consciousness is 
found in the juncture where multiplicity of meaning 
and the equivocalness of existence meet and opacity 
reigns. In the context of psychoanalysis, for example, 
this is especially true for a reflective human being in 
whom the unconscious can and does speak. 
In this manner, Rica:ur seeks to rethink the tradi-
tional conception of reflective consciousness. At the 
same time, however, he wants to maintain that human 
beings do have an obligation to engage the world and 
to pursue their goals with greater reflection. In short, 
he seeks an answer both to the significance of the un-
conscious for a human being whose project is tobe re-
flective about his or her engagements in the world and 
the significance of reflection for a human being who, 
for the most part, acts pre-reflectively and is bound to 
the reality of instincts that the unconscious represents. 
Although Hegel does not have the enormous im-
pact that MARX does in JEAN-PAUL SARTRE's major )ater 
work, Critique de la raison dialectique (1960/85), he 
does play a significant ro le in L 'etre et le neant ( 1943). 
Sartre's approach to Hegel there is quite different from 
Merleau-Ponty's or Rica:ur's because ofhis earnest use 
of Hegel 's Logik. Emphasis on this work had not been 
a part of the French Hegelian tradition of Alexandre 
Kojeve ( 1902-1968) that influenced Merleau-Ponty 
among others. Sartre 's turn to Hegel 's Logik in L'etre 
et le neant is due to what he takes to be phenomen-
ology's inability to deal with the problem of Being, 
i.e., how to account for the relation between the being 
ofthe subject and the being ofthe abject experienced. 
It could be said that in his EXISTENTIALISM Sartre uses 
Hegelian notions to give an ontologica) reading to the 
Husserlian concept of INTENTIONALITY. He explicates 
this notion in terms of Hegel 's categories of"being-in-
itself," "being-for-itself," and "negation." These come 
to stand for the being of the subject (being-for-itself 
and negation) and the being of the object (being-in-
itself). But in Sartre's hands, they serve only as cover-
ing schemes lacking Hegel's immanent reconstructive 
development ofthought to mediate them. 
Thus they remain fixed opposites with pertinence 
only in the domain ofhuman experience, and not in the 
domain ofwhat can be thought. As a consequence, both 
notions possess no connection in thought and only one, 
being-for-itself, is an experience by virtue ofnegation. 
It is negation bome by the human subject that allows 
being-in-itself to be disclosed, but disclosed as requi-
site support of being-for-itself or the human subject. 
For Sartre, this is a "dialectic" not of thought, but of 
existence, in which antinomies or antitheses ofthought 
are transformed into dissatisfying realities that perme-
ate human existence and can never be overcome. And 
ali the necessary attempts by a human subject to tran-
scend them lead to what he calls "bad faith." Existential 
ambiguity is now set in ontologica) stone. 
Although 
Sartre 
does 
make 
use 
of the 
Phiinomenologie in both his analysis of "bad faith," 
which bears a strong family resemblance to Hegel's 
analysis of "dissemblance" in the Phiinomenologie, 
and his analysis of the "existence of others," which 
relies heavily on the "Lordship and Bondage" section 
ofthe Phiinomenologie, he cannot reach Hegel's con-
clusions. For Hegel, the life of "spirit" involves an 

GEORG WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL 
295 
interminable quest through destabilizing cognitive and 
ethical conflicts and setbacks for a kind of cognitively 
and ethically stabilizing like-mindedness with others as 
a self-conscious achievement. For Sartre, this reveals 
Hegel's philosophical optimism, failing to recognize 
that destabilizing cognitive, ethical, and affective set-
backs of human existence are ontologically fixed. In 
this manner, Sartre's existential formulation ofthe on-
tologica) dimensions of Hegel 's "logica)" notions in-
forms his use ofHegel's Phănomenologie. 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER is the most significant represen-
tative of the second position that 20th century phe-
nomenologists have taken on Hegel, viz., emphasiz-
ing critica) philosophical differences between Hegel's 
phenomenological program and their own. AII other 
representatives of this position can be seen as disci-
ples of Heidegger, the most renowned being JACQUES 
DERRIDA. Unlike representatives of the first position, 
Heidegger is a Hegel scholar in his own right with a 
groundbreaking and plangent interpretation and a no-
table body of work on Hegel. More importantly, what 
distinguishes Heidegger from representatives of the 
first position is that he does not cuii various themes 
from Hegel to fit into his own philosophical scheme. 
Rather, he concentrates on Hegel 's general project and 
investigates how it addresses the perennial question 
in the history of Western metaphysics, i.e., the ques-
tion of the meaning of Being. In so doing, Heidegger 
challenges the philosophical claims Hegel believes the 
Phănomenologie is entitled to issue. 
The inquiry ofphenomenological ontology into the 
being of subjectivity is originally established by Hei-
degger. But unlike Sartre, Heidegger does not make 
use of Hegel 's "logica)" notions as covering schemes 
to deal with the being of subjectivity. He rather points to 
the historical roots of subjectivity as explicated within 
the Western metaphysical tradition. Heidegger's FUN-
DAMENTAL ONTOLOGY illuminates the historical dimen-
sion of the inquiry into and the presuppositions of 
the being of subjectivity. What Heidegger claims to 
discover phenomenologically in the history of meta-
physics is that the being of subjectivity is the being 
of ali that is and that such a view culminates in the 
thought of Hegel. Moreover, Hegel comes to this view, 
Heidegger contends, by his own recognition, exempli-
fied in his Phănomenologie, that the "Absolute" moves 
within the am bit of the history of philosophy and si-
multaneously constitutes this movement as identica] 
with philosophy itself. So Heidegger believes that, like 
himself, Hegel makes phenomenology a historically 
oriented investigation into the being of subjectivity. 
But, unlike himself, he sees Hegel supporting the view 
that Being itself is absolute subjectivity, which repre-
sents the course of philosophy and its culmination in 
absolute certainty. 
Thus Heidegger goes to great lengths to point out the 
contrasts between what he takes tobe Hegel's histori-
cally oriented phenomenological ontology ofthe being 
of subjectivity and his own. First, despite his historical 
focus, Hegel, Heidegger argues, is still under the sway 
of Western metaphysics because he does not examine 
Being in the light ofits ontologica] difference from be-
ings. In short, the object ofthought for Hegel is Being, 
but only as appropriated by the subject in and as abso-
lute knowledge. For Heidegger, the object of thought 
is also Being, but only as the enabling condition of 
the difference between Being and subjectivity oras the 
"clearing" (Lichtung) in which this difference emerges 
and abides for a while. 
Second, according to Heidegger, Hegel 's work con-
ceives of subjectivity as being unconditioned in the 
act of thinking and representing such that it becomes 
wholly manifest to itself as the being of ali that is. 
Heidegger claims then that Hegel 's conception of the 
subject is the metaphysical imprimatur of the modern 
age. In this more global rather than textual context, 
any object whatsoever must come to stand in relation 
to subjectivity in order for that object to be at ali. In 
this sense, subjectivity becomes the measure for ali that 
is and objects are thus understood to be purely at the 
disposal of consciousness. 
In contrast, Heidegger's phenomenology conceives 
of subjectivity in terms of either the "facticity of DA-
SEIN" or the thoughtful remembrance of the arrival of 
what has been. The former refers to the being of a hu-
man individual as one who practically and affectively 
attends to his or her life as it impends at any given 
time such that the meaning of Being is disclosed and 
understood as an issue for this individual; the latter 
understands the human individual as one whose very 
being is mindfully to remember the meaning of Being 
as that which has been "unthought" in the history of 
philosophy and is thus yet to come. In both instances, 
contra Hegel, the meaning of Being is not compre-

296 
ENCYCLOPED!A OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
hended or represented in thought. 
Finally, Heidegger believes that Hegel's historically 
oriented phenomenology is organized in the form of a 
prospective movement that continually directs and in-
corporates the earlier and less developed in thought 
into the !ater and more developed. He is at odds with 
the Hegelian view that particular philosophical posi-
tions and epochs ofphilosophy arise from one another 
out of the necessity of a dialectica! process. Heideg-
ger's historically oriented phenomenology moves ret-
rospectively to that which has been "unthought" in past 
philosophical positions in order to reveal not only its 
original significance, but also the need for rekindling 
a kind ofthoughtfulness in philosophy appreciative of 
the lasting character of the "unthought" for a coming 
time. 
Of ali 20th century phenomenologists, none has 
given less consideration to the thought of Hegel than 
EDMUND HUSSERL. Philosophical comments by Husserl 
on Hegel 's work are virtually nil. Practically every 
Husserl scholar accepts without question Husserl 's lack 
of consideration of Hegel 's thought because they per-
ceive Husserl as dismissing or ignoring what he takes 
tobe a body of outmoded, ifnot dubious, metaphysical 
views having no relevance for the tasks ofphenomen-
ology. Furthermore, since Hegel's Phiinomenologie is 
usually regarded as considerably attuned with "EXIS-
TENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY," that work, it is beJieved, 
would be incommensurate with what is usually un-
derstood as either the robust Cartesian or the strong 
Kantian orientation of Husserl's coNSTITUTIVE PHENO-
MENOLOGY. 
Nevertheless, there are a few critica! remarks on 
Hegel in the first volume of Husserl's Erste Philoso-
phie [ 1923/24]. And what is noteworthy about these ob-
servations is that Husserl cites Adolf Trendelenburg's 
Logische Untersuchungen (2 vols., 1840). Although 
Trendelenburg ( 1802-1872) wrote another critica) text 
about Hegel, Die logische Frage in Hegels System 
(The logica! question in Hegel's system, 1843), there 
is no evidence that Husserl was familiar with it. Nev-
ertheless, these texts inaugurated what may be called 
the logica! critique of Hegel's Logik, which is quite 
distinct from the 19th century existential (scHELLING 
and Kierkegaard), psychological (Fries), and socio-
political (Feuerbach and Marx) critiques ofthis work. 
Trendelenburg initiates this critique of Hegel 's 
Logik based less on its allegedly spurious metaphys-
ical character than on its inauthenticity or deficiency 
as a logic. Despite the fact that Trendelenburg's crite-
rion of adequacy was a revamped Aristotelian logic, 
it was not difficult for that criterion to change due 
to the development (through FREGE) of formalization 
and axiomatization in logic, which, over the next fi ve 
decades, for the first time gave the discipline of logic 
a scientifically stable foundation for evaluating alter-
native "logics" both past and present. Consequently, 
since Hegel 's logic would be resistant to formalization, 
the division between the formalistic adequacy of sym-
bolic logic and the formalistic inadequacy of Hegel's 
logic could be drawn with significant precision. Given 
Husserl's own interests in LOGIC and MATHEMATICS dur-
ing this time, it is most likely that the logica) critique 
of Hegel, which Trendelenburg launched and which 
has been as current and longstanding as the existential 
and socio-political ones, had influenced and settled his 
views on Hegel. 
Moreover, in Erste Philosophie, Husserl claims that 
with Hegel "the character of speculative activity leads 
to the end of consciousness," and he cites the follow-
ing remark by Trendelenburg to support this claim: 
"In its highest synthesis of consciousness and uncon-
sciousness, speculation also requires the annihilation 
of consciousness itself." Sin ce Husserl 's concern was 
with the phenomenological elucidation ofthe concepts 
and formalism of logic through a conception of con-
sciousness as transcendental, he clearly would have 
been unsympathetic to a phenomenological program 
such as Hegel 's, in which "absolute knowing" would 
yield the elimination of consciousness. So once again, 
Husserl 's reliance on Trendelenburg provides him with 
his perspective on Hegel. 
Yet the reference to Trendelenburg may offer an 
opening to a more fruitful philosophical encounter be-
tween Hegel and Husserl than has previously existed. 
Trendelenburg's work downplays the alleged meta-
. 
. 
physical dimensîbn of Hegel in favor of examining 
the "logica!" element. It subsequently facilitates, as we 
have noted, the use of formalism as the criterion of 
adequacy for the discipline of logic. Both Hegel and 
Husserl are themselves critica! of formalism, despite 
its technical sophistication, because of its inability to 
account for the development of formalization and ax-
iomatization within either "thought's autonomous de-

GEORG WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL 
297 
velopment" (Hegel) or formalism 's genetic elucidation 
in (modalizing) experience (Husserl). 
Although Hegel's critique is quite terse and a 
polemic against (a historical\y earlier brand of) formal-
ism's criterial capacity, it is not as extensively worked 
out as Husserl 's. Yet both critiques presuppose the 
work of phenomenology as either, for Hegel, "the de-
duction of the concept of [the] science [of logic]" or, 
for Husserl, the clarification ofthe sense oflogic. The 
task of the former is to give access to an analysis in 
which the determinacy or sense of a logica! "object" 
is neither independently given nor categorially fixed in 
thought, but rather is subject to an intrinsically reflex-
ive revision in relation to other logica! "objects," even 
contrary ones. The task of the latter is to analyze the 
manner in which the sense or determinacy of a logica! 
"object" is given in the intentiona! experience of con-
scious life. Thus for both Hegel and Husserl, there is a 
strong connection between phenomenology and logic, 
because both argue for some conception of subjectiv-
ity to undo the criterial capacity of formalism for the 
discipline oflogic. 
Once this connection is understood, other areas 
for study open up. For example, Hegel's "phenomen-
ological deduction" and Husserl's "phenomenological 
clarification" would indeed yield different conclusions 
about the conception of subjectivity, yet both would 
be critica! of and resistant to PSYCHOLOGISM. Hegel's 
understanding of psychologism is not as well devel-
oped as Husserl's, but Hegel's Logik, in its own right, 
does sustain a dyslogistic account of psychologism. 
Moreover, the possibility of examining the "determi-
nacy of thought" ( Gedanke) in the light of "meaning" 
(Bedeutung) and vice versa would be quite feasible. 
Despite their different characterizations of pheno-
menology, then, both would claim that phenomen-
ology, using Hegel 's language, is a science system-
atically explicating the experience of consciousness. 
Yet the "experience of consciousness" needs tobe pre-
cisely delineated because, for Husserl, it refers to (a) the 
human subject's ability to pursue meaning and TRUTH 
in everyday Jife through PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, LAN-
GUAGE, MEMORY, EXPECTATION, and INTERSUBJECTIVITY, 
ali ofwhich disclose that pursuit as the following of an 
already stabilized course of meaningful conduct; (b) 
the work of logic and mathematics engaged in active 
cognitive pursuit of meaning and truth pertinent to, 
yet outside of, everyday life; and (c) the work ofphi-
losophy engaged in either the pursuit of the enabling 
conditions of both (a) and (b) or the establishment of 
(a) or (b) as enabling conditions themselves. For Hegel, 
on the other hand, the "experience of consciousness" 
refers only to (c). Although Husserl's phenomenology 
appears to examine a wider range of what counts as 
the "experience of consciousness" than Hegel 's, it is 
only (c) that can genuinely serve as the topic for a 
philosophically fruitful exchange between them. 
Furthermore, once the "experience of conscious-
ness" is understood as the work ofphilosophy, it com-
pels an examination of what distinguishes the pheno-
menological analysis from that which it appraises, viz., 
the experience ofconsciousness as the work ofphilos-
ophy. What distinguishes it is the fact that the work 
of philosophy is laden with the "natural assumption" 
(natiirliche Vorstellung) for Hegel and with the "natu-
ral attitude" (natiirliche Einstellung) for Husserl. These 
two notions are equivalent, however, only ifthey apply 
to the experience of consciousness as the work of phi-
losophy, because the "natural assumption" for Hegel is 
peculiar only to philosophy, while the "natural attitude" 
does extend to (a) and (b) above. 
Once applied to the work of philosophy, pheno-
menological analysis takes on a historical orientation 
for both Hegel and Husserl, and this gives to pheno-
menology a critica!, reconstructive, and transcenden-
tal stance. It is critica! because in illuminating either 
the natural attitude or natural assumption in the vari-
ous historical workings ofphilosophy, phenomenology 
can account for the unacknowledged presuppositions 
affecting those workings. It is reconstructive because in 
establishing differences between those various work-
ings beyond the boundaries where they have been tra-
ditionally drawn, phenomenology can disclose new 
frameworks, new standards, and new criteria. And it is 
transcendental because in establishing how the work-
ings of philosophy ought to proceed after historically 
disclosing their unrecognized presuppositions, pheno-
menology can claim to identify universal presupposi-
tions and to register a kind of theoretical knowledge 
transcendental in character. In each stance, the rele-
vance of spirit and intersubjectivity for the reftective 
work of consciousness as well as the correlation of 
rationality and actuality come to the fore in both phe-
nomenologies.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
What is poignant yet paradoxical is that Husserl, 
whose understanding of Hegel led him to say so little 
about him, may be the 20th century phenomenologist 
whose work in its own right offers the site in which 
Hegel 's thought resonates the strongest.

dissertation, Die Lehre vom Urteil im Psychologis-
mus (The theory of judgment in psychologism, 1913 ), 
was prepared under Artur Schneider ( 1875-1945). In 
1915 he completed his habilitation at Freiburg under

MARTIN HEIDEGGER 
299 
entry entitled HUSSERL and HEIDEGGER.) Heidegger was 
Privatdozent at Freiburg 1915-23, Professor Extraor-
dinarius at Marburg 1923-28, and Professor Ordinar-
ius and Chair ofPhilosophy at Freiburg 1928-46, also 
serving as the first Rector ofthe University ofFreiburg 
under National Socialism during 1933-34. Heidegger 
died in Freiburg on May 26, 1976. 
For the early Heidegger, phenomenology is so much 
identified with genuine philosophy that he believes not 
only that any contemporary or future philosophy must 
be phenomenological if it is to fulfill its mission, but 
also that ali of the important figures in the history 
of philosophy, from the Greeks up to the present, to 
the extent that they were genuine philosophers, had 
been practicing nothing other than phenomenology in 
its broadest sense. From his earliest Marburg 1ectures 
up through the major published work from his early 
period, Sein und Zeit ( 1927), Heidegger stresses the 
necessity of being guided by the "Sache," the issue 
or matter at stake in philosophy, and not by empty 
concepts or words. Moreover, he asserts that authentic 
philosophy consists first and foremost in putting into 
words what we implicitly know and experience, and not 
in following the model of mathematics by attempting 
to construct philosophical systems through the deduc-
tion of consequences from initial abstract and general 
assumptions. He takes this to have been the point of 
Husserl 's famous maxim "to the matters themselves!" 
and sees Husserl's renewed emphasis upon "seeing" 
as opposed to constructing or deducing as his deci-
sive contribution in the restoration ofphilosophy to its 
original calling. 
Accordingly, in §7 of the introduction to Sein und 
Zeit ( 192 7), Heidegger declares that the method to be 
employed in his investigation into the meaning ofBe-
ing in general, an investigation that he takes to be 
the fundamental question for any philosophy, will be 
phenomenological. In his explanation ofwhat the term 
"phenomenology" as the name for the proper method 
ofphilosophy means, he refers both to Husserl's maxim 
as well as to the original meaning of the term 's Greek 
roots, namely phainomenon and logos. Phainomenon 
is said to be that which shows itself in itself, what is 
manifest, so that an orientation upon the phenomena is 
directed to "the entirety ofwhat is exposed to the light 
of day or can be brought to light, which the Greeks 
occasionally simply identified with to onta (beings)." 
Important to note here is that beings, the phenomena, 
are not limited merely to that which is already or readily 
apparent, but also include anything that can be brought 
to light as well. 
The qualification "in itself' should be understood 
first in contrast to the way that something can show 
itself as what it is not in itself, as otherwise than the way 
it really is. Thus to refer to an entity as a phenomenon 
is precisely not to reduce it to a "mere appearance" or 
an illusion, nor is it even an appearance that refers to 
something else in the way that a symptom can be taken 
as an appearance of the disease that does not become 
manifest "in itself," but only in its symptoms. Thus 
phenomenology is also nota study of appearances that 
refer back to some other "things in themselves." Rather, 
to refer to the object ofinvestigation as a phenomenon 
points to its essential relatedness to the way that it 
becomes apparent, and to the philosopher's obligation 
to avoid positing hypothetical entities and to restrict 
him- or herself to a description of what is or can be 
made clearly apparent. It is important to note that what 
can be made clearly and explicitly apparent must not 
necessarily be so at the outset. It may rather reveal itself 
at first and for the most part in an implicit, nonthematic 
way; but it must nonetheless manifest itself somehow, 
and in the course ofthe philosophical analysis must do 
so directly and as it is, ifit is to become the phenomenon 
for phenomenology. 
This understanding is amplified in Heidegger's in-
terpretation of the second of the Greek roots of the 
term phenomenology. The fundamental trait of logos 
that Heidegger derives from his encounter with Greek 
philosophy, especially with Plato and Aristotle, is his 
interpretati an of logos in terms of its function, its abil-
ity to make something apparent. Rather than defining 
speech primarily in terms of its physical si de, its sounds 
or marks, or in terms of its grammatical structure, the 
Greek philosophers had recognized that its most basic 
characteristic is that it allows something to be seen, 
makes something accessible to the person to whom the 
logos is communicated. Furthermore, it has the struc-
ture of allowing something to be seen as something, 
which is reflected for instance in the subjectpredicate 
structure of declarati ve statements. Thus the logos has 
the ability tobe true or false, to allow the object tobe 
disclosed as it is, or- in a false statement-tobe seen 
as it is not. But even the false statement can only reveal 

300 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
an object as it is not if it has the fundamental character 
ofmaking it apparent in some way or another. 
Thus in subsection c of§7 Heidegger concludes that 
phenomenology is apophainesthai ta phainomena, an 
allowing tobe seen ofthat which shows itself as it is in 
itself, and declares that this expresses the same thing as 
Husserl's famous maxim "To the matters themselves!" 
quoted above. He thereby endorses Husserl 's own view 
that phenomenology is nothing other than a renewal of 
the ancient project ofphilosophy as a rigorous science 
begun by Plato and Aristotle, formulated now as the 
demand to begin again and accept only those general 
claims that can be grounded in the EVIDENCE of seeing 
for oneself, i.e., EIDETIC METHOD. However, at the same 
time Heidegger qualifies his endorsement by noting 
that this descrjption remains merely formal, that it de-
fines a method of philosophical procedure but leaves 
open the question of the proper object of phenomen-
ological philosophy. 
For Heidegger, what is most properly the object of 
phenomenology is that which for us is most in need of 
becoming a phenomenon, i.e., of becoming explicitly 
and directly apparent to us as it is in itself. This means 
both that it must be capable ofbecoming apparent to us 
in this way and that it must also at first and for the most 
part fail to be so, that it is something that is usually 
hidden or apparent to us only in a distorted way. In the 
introduction Heidegger asserts, and in the subsequent 
chapters of Sein und Zeit he tries to show, that the 
proper object of phenomenology is then nothing other 
than the Being of beings (Sein des Seienden), which 
has been addressed throughout the history of philoso-
phy in an oblique and distorted way ever since it was 
first made the object of explicit inquiry by the Greeks. 
Hence phenomenology for Heidegger in Sein und Zeit 
is most properJy FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY, which must 
address first of ali the question ofthe meaning ofBeing 
in general, and then its modifications and derivations. 
Ontology is possible only as phenomenology. 
To the equation of phenomenology and ontology, 
Heidegger adds a third element, namely, HERMENEU-
TICS. In Sein und Zeit, at least in the published first 
part, Heidegger addresses the question ofthe meaning 
ofBeing through an analysis ofthe structure ofhuman 
being, which Heidegger terms DASEIN. Since the mean-
ing of Being is to be examined through an explication 
of the basic structure of the way Dasein understands 
Being and the structures of Dasein's own existence, 
Heidegger concludes that the concept of hermeneutic~ 
is also appropriate for phenomenology as he conceives 
and practices it, since this explication proceeds as an 
interpretation, indeed a self-interpretation, of Dasein 
and its own activities: "Philosophy is universal pheno-
menological ontology, beginning with the hermeneutic 
of Dasein, which as an analysis of existence has tied 
the guiding thread ofphilosophical inquiry back to the 
place where it arises and to which it returns." 
In his endorsement of phenomenology as a formal 
method for philosophy, Heidegger clearly sees him-
self following Husserl at this stage of his thinking. In 
determining the extent to which his description of the 
specific issue of phenomenology as ontology and of 
hermeneutics as its point of departure represents a re-
vision or even a rejection of Husserl 's position, three 
issues must be addressed, albeit here only briefly, be-
ginning with the question ( 1) whether the emphasis 
upon Being as the central issue represents a rejec-
tion of Husserl's "transcendental turn" to coNSTITU-
TIVE PHENOMENOLOGY. The answer to this question is 
closely related to and hinges upon the answer to an-
other, namely, (2) whether Oase in is just another name 
for transcendental subjectivity. And, finally, there re-
mains the question (3) whether the turn back to pheno-
menology through an analysis of Dasein is not just 
a reversion back to a kind of anthropologism, which 
would undermine the a priori necessity of phenomen-
ology as a form of pure eidetic philosophy. 
Regarding the first question, the controversy would 
turn on the extent to which Being is either constituted 
by or essentially related to human being. Certainly, at 
least at this stage, Being can be a phenomenon only 
if it is in some way accessible to us, i.e., only through 
Dasein 's understanding ofBeing. So Heidegger clearly 
cannot be rejecting Husserl 's tenet concerning the es-
sential relatedness of ali objects to subjectivity in some 
form or other. And clearly at this stage, Heidegger 
is not reducing Being to human being, since he ex-
hibits in Sein und Zeit a number of forms of being 
(e.g., the readiness-to-hand ofuseful objects, the mere 
presence-at-hand of objects in the attitude of modern 
NATURAL SCIENCE) that are not identica! with human 
being. So whether Heidegger would accept Husserl 's 
mature view that transcendental EPOCHE AND REDUCTION 
involves the reduction to structures revealed through 

MARTIN HEIDEGGER 
301 
the analysis of pure transcendental subjectivity as such 
turns on the question ofthe differences between Dasein 
and subjectivity. 
This is the second question posed above. Whereas 
transcendental subjectivity can easily be taken as a 
kind of self-enclosed sphere with objects within it, Hei-
degger takes the Husserlian doctrine ofthe INTENTION-
ALITY of consciousness and emphasizes the openness, 
the other-directedness of human existence that finds 
itself not moving within an enclosed sphere, but al-
ways engaged with objects within the world wherein 
one lives. Furthermore, the very notion of subjectivity 
is closely connected with a theory of consciousness 
as a self-enclosed, at least potentially completely self-
transparent sphere, o ne that has a theoretical awareness 
of objects as its basic operation and then adds practi-
ca!, aesthetic, and moral values to them. Heidegger by 
contrast stresses the way that objects emerge for us in 
everyday life as permeated through and through by a 
practica! relevance that does not emerge first and fore-
most in explicit propositions about them, but instead 
is a part of the very way we encounter them from the 
outset. Thus Dasein is not conceived of as a sphere of 
self-certain theoretical awareness, but as a process of 
practica! engagement with things that are interpreted 
in terms of their relevance to Dasein's purposes. Just 
as the structures of transcendental subjectivity prede-
lineate the framework for the possible objectivity of 
objects, so too the basic structures ofDasein set up the 
framework within which things can emerge for us in 
the way they do. Yet the emphasis in the analysis ofDa-
sein is not upon reftection and theoretical awareness, 
but upon the process of one's engaging in the activity 
of everyday existence. Moreover, whereas Husserl's 
stress upon the constructive ro le of subjectivity led to 
charges of a revival of subjective idealism, Heideg-
ger's stress upon things appearing for us "as they are 
in themselves" is meant to undercut such charges from 
the outset. 
The move from transcendental subjectivity to Da-
sein means that the transcendental phenomenological 
reduction back to the sphere of pure consciousness is 
no longer a core requirement of phenomenology for 
Heidegger. But that does not mean that the notion of 
reduction has become entirely superftuous, since the 
analyses presented in Sein und Zeit clearly presuppose 
whatever is necessary for eidetic method. This point is 
also relevant for the answer to the third question posed 
above. Ifthe analysis ofDasein consisted strictly in a 
factual description of certa in characteristics of human 
beings, the way they happen to organize their lives, 
and the way that objects typically look to them de-
pending on how they perform this organization, then 
Heidegger's analyses could not avoid the charge of 
anthropologism that might be directed at them from a 
Husserlian perspective (which is why many, including 
Heidegger, took Husserl 's remarks in the 1931 public 
lectures on "Phanomenologie und Anthropologie" as 
criticisms of Heidegger's work). 
However, what one finds is that Heidegger's analy-
ses are consistently aimed at revealing the structures of 
human experience and the being ofvarious kinds of ob-
jects, and at showing how these two are essentially re-
lated. Specific examples are offered, but the method of 
generalization is in each case not inductive, but eidetic. 
Heidegger's analyses presuppose the method of eide-
tic variation since they are aimed at uncovering what 
Husserl might have called essential interconnections 
(Wesenszusammenhănge) and what Heidegger calls a 
structure, essential constitution or composition ( Ver-
fassung), or condition. Thus since Heidegger's anal-
yses are aimed at uncovering such necessary features 
of Dasein and its ramifications for the constitution of 
Being in its many forms and as such, the analyses do 
not fali under the charge of anthropologism as Husserl 
would use the term, but they escape this charge only 
by building on central insights and methods developed 
within Husserlian phenomenology. 
In addition to the rejection of the notion of tran-
scendental subjectivity as the ultimate ground for phi-
losophizing, Heidegger develops another position at a 
very early stage that separates him from the Husserlian 
practice of phenomenology. For Heidegger, system-
atic philosophy becomes the disclosure of fundamen-
tal structures of what there is and their modifications 
and possible concretions through the phenomenologi-
cal method· of intuitive disclosure. However, at the 
same time, when Heidegger points to the distortions 
that prevent Being from emerging as a genuine phe-
nomenon for us, he draws from them the conclusion 
that phenomenology must necessarily also involve his-
torical reftection. Failing to engage the history of phi-
losophy in an active way makes us captive to the dis-
tortions and concealments that have arisen over time. 

302 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
The active confrontation with the history of philoso-
phy is thus the condition for the possibility of gaining 
the proper access to the phenomenon at issue in phi-
losophy in two ways, one by helping us to come to see 
the distortions and concealing factors as such, and in 
addition by taking us back to the experiences that led to 
this history in the first place, so that we contemporaries 
might be in a better position to recapture these experi-
ences and perhaps gaina glimpse ofwhat inspired our 
predecessors, especially the Greeks. 
Thus phenomenology will also and inevitably in-
volve an element of destruction, an element of con-
fronting HISTORY, sifting through the sedimentations, 
trying to get a glimpse once more of the phenomena 
that inspired that history in the first place. Destruction 
then involves two elements, first the negative task of 
removing distortions, locating and eliminating false as-
sumptions that hide the phenomenon from view, and 
then second the positive task ofleading one back to the 
original experience of the phenomenon that is the ob-
ject ofphenomenology. From Heidegger's perspective, 
it was, among other things, Husserl 's failure to take into 
account this necessary element of phenomenology-his 
failure to consider the historical determinacy of any 
position, including that of the phenomenologist him-
or herself- that led him to repeat what Husserl had 
recognized as Descartes's problem, namely, the un-
questioned adoption of too many assumptions from 
the tradition that preceded him. 
Scholars disagree over the extent to which Heideg-
ger abandoned phenomenology during his middle and 
!ater periods in favor of a different approach to what 
had traditionally been taken tobe the primary issues of 
philosophy. As he begins to avoid the term "philoso-
phy," because it comes tobe seen as too closely identi-
fied with a specific metaphysical project, and moves to 
the tit le of"thinking" for his own efforts, so too the term 
"phenomenology" also recedes as a tit le for the proce-
dure ofthis thinking. Hence many have come to ques-
tion the degree to which Heidegger's work remains 
phenomenological. To the extent that phenomenology 
had been identified with the analysis of Dasein as the 
fundamental task of philosophy in Sein und Zeit, the 
shift away from analysis ofDasein toward the thinking 
of the history of Being in the middle and !ater periods 
can be seen as a shift away from phenomenology as 
well. 
Moreover, Heidegger begins to emphasize the role 
of LANGUAGE after the Kehre. This is the turn ing away 
from an analysis ofBeing by way of an analysis of Da-
sein in fa vor of an attempt to trace historical epochs of 
Dasein and everything else back to the history of Be-
ing and the ways in which it has shown and concealed 
itself throughout history. It may seem to signal a new 
approach in which one is no longer oriented toward 
seeing essences, but rather is responding to the address 
of language itself. Furthermore, the insight into the in-
escapable element of concealment inherent in Being 
itself calls into question the project of bringing com-
pletely to light something that will always essentially 
ha ve a tendency to conceal itself, so that the attainabil-
ity of the original goal of phenomenology may also 
seem to have been fundamentally misplaced. 
There can be no doubt that as Heidegger's own 
thinking continues to develop, the nature ofphenomen-
ology for him must at the very least be revised. Yet it is 
important to note that even in Sein und Zeit, it was not 
clear from the introduction whether the analysis of Da-
sein was tobe the sole task ofphenomenology or rather 
an essential, but nonetheless provisional, mode of ac-
cess to the question ofthe meaning ofBeing as such. In 
any case, certain essential features of the phenomen-
ological project in general remain central to Heideg-
ger's approach ali the way up to his final works. Four 
deserve special mention. 
( 1) Whether described as hearing or seeing, or as 
in some places as being touched by Being, the expe-
rience first of the thinker and then of the audience of 
Heidegger's writings remains an essential component 
of his work. Most vividly perhaps in the essays on lan-
guage, Heidegger repeatedly stresses the importance of 
having an experience with language, ofhearing a call. 
His work sti li attempts to avoid artificial constructions, 
abstract speculation, factual induction, or methodical 
deduction from first principles in fa vor of allowing that 
which is to show itself to us as it is, even if this takes 
place only in the form ofthe withdrawal ofthat which 
is. For here too it is not merely a matter oftalking about 
this withdrawal or providing a metaphysical deduction 
of it, but of experiencing it, of coming to see and hear 
it in such a way as to transform our thinking, feeling, 
and acting. 
(2) Although the terminology of eidetic intuition 
has long since been abandoned, nonetheless the way 

MARTIN HEIDEGGER 
303 
the works proceed is most often through the experi-
ence of a particular instance, a particular work of art or 
a poem, a particular example of technology or social 
policy, or a specific modern scientific development to 
point out something broader, something more perva-
sive that is at work in a particular epoch and in ali ofthe 
things that emerge within it. Moreover, these in turn 
point to features of what Heidegger ca lis "the truth of 
Being" (die Wahrheit des Se ins) or aletheia, "the clear-
ing" (die Lichtung), "the 'there is given"' (das "Es 
gibt "), or "the event of appropriation" (das Ereignis). 
In each of them certain enduring features about the 
way they emerge will be identified, features that show 
up in each of the epochs of the history of Being and 
are reftected in everything there is. So although the 
talk of an eidos disappears and there is an attempt to 
address more radically what is meant by the Wesen or 
way that something asserts its essence, the search for 
certa in basic and enduring traits of what is persists. 
(3) Heidegger's intensified concern with LANGUAGE 
AFTER HUSSERL does not mitigate the issue-oriented 
character of his thinking. Language itself becomes 
an issue, and Heidegger now emphasizes how our re-
sponse to language affects the way things show them-
selves to us, but for him words never become mere 
words. Language is a showing, a making apparent of 
what language names and allows to emerge in a certain 
light. Thus the emphasis upon language is never "mere 
poetry," but rather an attentive hearing and seeing of 
how things come to be present or absent for us. 
(4) The nature ofTRUTH as revealing and concealing 
does not mean that one should be content with allow-
ing forgottenness, distortion, and withdrawal to reign. 
Rather, the very showing of forgottenness, distortion, 
and withdrawal as such is meant to show something 
about Being itself under the various names that Hei-
degger assigns it in his middle and !ater periods, and is 
meant to make something apparent in a way that might 
prepare for a change in how things present themselves 
as a whole to us. Thus although the expectation of fu li 
and final disclosure is abandoned, at least the move-
ment from an undetected distortion and withdrawal to 
one that presents itself as such and thus paves the way 
for a new awareness of Being as such remains part of 
the impetus for thinking, an impetus not far from that 
ofthe original phenomenological project. 
It is therefore appropriate for one of Heideg-
ger's final published essays, "Mein Weg in die 
Phănomenologie" ( 1963), to close with the li nes," ... 
phenomenology in its most proper form is not a di-
rection. It is a possibility for thought that transforms 
itself over time and thus remains, the possibility of 
corresponding to that which claims us as what is to 
be thought. If phenomenology is experienccd and re-
tained in this way, then it can disappear as a title in 
favor of the issue for thinking, whose revelation re-
mains a mystery." Although the name might disappear, 
phenomenology as a possibility to be striven after and 
enacted remains up until the end in Heidegger's view 
the way to respond to the issues for what bas tradition-
ally been called philosophy and Heidegger in his !ater 
phases calls the thinking ofBeing.

HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY 
The 
phenomenology that emerged in EDMUND HUSSERL's 
Logische Untersuchungen (1900-190 1 ), and that 
was given programmatic statement in his Jdeen zu 
ei ner reinen Phănomenologie und phănomenologische 
Philosophie J ( 1913), was not only a philosophy in its 
own right, but had the power to evoke severa! suc-
cessors, including hermeneutica! phenomenology. In 
1900-1901, Husserl showed that our mental acts of 
perceiving, thinking, and imagining already possess 
MEANING prior to their being expressed in propositional 
form, and that they impress their mark, their meaning, 
upon the propositions. These "intentiona!" acts, for in-
stance, grasp a phenomenon according to some univer-
sal species; grasp it as a thing or an attribute, ora com-
posite; define it as possible or actual. Husserl pointed 
out that in these intentiona! acts, consciousness is detin-
ing an interpretative meaning (Aujfassungssinn) ofits 
data. Although we see an anticipation of hermeneu-
tica! phenomenology in this doctrine, neither the Un-
tersuchungen nor !ater works of Husserl can be said 
to exemplify hermeneutica! phenomenology in a strict 
sense. 
AII phenomenology thematizes human awareness, 
differentiating the many forms our awareness may take 
(PERCEPTION, MEMORY, etc.), investigating whether and 
how a form of awareness may be cognitive, exploring 
the connection ofawareness to object, etc. But Husserl 
claimed that the phenomenologist could gain access 
to consciousness and its many intentiona! formations 
by way of a primordial intuition (Anschauung) that 
presented consciousness as well as its intentiona! ob-
ject as it was in itself- as he said: die Sac hen selbst. 
Thus his phenomenology was intuitionistic. Moreover, 
his phenomenology sought to go behind language to a 
pre-linguistic mentallife; neither for mental life itself 
nor for the phenomenological study of it was the syn-
tax or the semantics of language essential. So it was 
mentalistic. Consciousness and its formations possess 
their essential features quite in advance of the linguis-
tic utterances that express them. Husserl 's was also 
a foundational kind of philosophy, with an acknowl-
edged affinity to Cartesianism. 
Phenomenology became hermeneutica! when it ar-
gued that every form of human awareness is interpre-
ti ve, when it was not content to regard interpretation 
as just one specific form of awareness directed to o ne 
particular range of objects- for instance, texts. If al! 
the intentions of our perception and IMAGINATION are al-
ready marked through and through by LANGUAGE, and, 
moreover, if the phenomenologist him- or herself can 
no longer claim an intuitive access to mental life, but 
is always interpreting it, then we are in HERMENEUTICS. 
This mutation of phenomenology was inaugurated by 
one book, MARTIN HEIDEGGER 's Sein und Zeit (1927), 
Lester Embree, Elizabeth A. Behnke, David Carr, J. Claude Evans, Jose Huertas-Jourda, Joseph J. Kockelmans, William R. McKenna,

HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY 
305 
though further developments were still to come. 
Characteristically, Heidegger's methodological ex-
position in §7 is already a bit of hermeneutics, an in-
terpretation ofthe Greek language. "Phenomenology" 
means: logos of the phainomenon. The phainomenon 
is that which makes itself manifest and logos is the 
power in a word or in a discourse that makes something 
manifest. Phenomenology accordingly is a practice of 
making something manifest that is in one way already 
manifest, and yet that is in another way stiH concealed, 
in need of further manifestation through a logos. And 
this phainomenon is Being; ordinary beings or entities 
are manifest enough to us, but the being of beings -
what it is to be -
is partially manifest and partially 
hidden. Heidegger conceived of phenomenology as a 
method, a method for ontologica! study (study of the 
being of beings) and the first reason why phenomen-
ology is hermeneutica! is that it focuses on something 
that is and remains both concealed and unconcealed. 
In such a case, its practice is interpretation. 
Sein und Zeit uses the capitalized Latin-based word 
Interpretation for phenomenological researches into 
Being and such related structures as TIME, TRUTH, and so 
on. Being is not merely an intellectual notion, category, 
or form, as the tradition tended to treat it; rather, it 
is an actual phenomenon disclosed to us in our life, 
manifested to us through actual experiences such as 
authenticity, death, and care -
a phenomenon that 
beckons to us and yet retreats from us as well. 
A second reason why phenomenology may become 
hermeneutica! is that the human being comes to take on 
a central ro le. This particular being, ourselves (Heideg-
ger calls us DASEIN), already possesses an understand-
ing of Being (Seinsverstiindnis), though it is a shad-
owy and vague one in which Being remains largely 
hidden from view. Philosophy is to interpret to DASEIN 
the "meaning" of Being as such, but, just the same, 
the meaning of Being is already grasped by Dasein to 
some limited degree. Philosophy's interpretations de-
pend on the pre-ontological understanding of Being 
that everyone possesses. Heidegger's phenomenology 
can never be without presuppositions ( voraussetzungs-
los) as Husserl 's aspired to be. It cannot analyze Ee-
ing and the "phenomena" that accompany it - time, 
truth, humanity itself- starting from scratch with an 
EPOCHE AND REDUCT!ON or a first principle of reason. 
Philosophy must not only address itselfto our quotid-
ian understanding, it will even gain some insights from 
it. 
Phenomenology may become hermeneutica! for a 
further reason. Not only is it addressed to Dasein, but 
Sein und Zeit is a study of Dasein. It consists of a 
"hermeneutic of Dasein" because it cannot proceed 
by any intuition of consciousness or of its intentiona! 
states, and this is owing to the character of our be-
ing. Intuition is an immediate presence, but Dasein can 
never be purely present in any relation, not even to 
itself. Dasein must be interpreted, just as the phain-
omenon of Being must be, because by its very way 
of being, it resists being made present. Heidegger's 
foca! topic, the being of Dasein, is interwoven with 
nonbeing. Dasein's self-distancing- he also calls it 
ekstasis- and transcendence is climactically realized 
as being-toward-death; we exist precisely as we are 
losing existence. 
There is a further hermeneutica! aspect of Heideg-
ger's work. Lying at the center of his study of Da-
sein is the phenomenon of Auslegung, treated in §32, 
the interpretation that is practiced in everyone's daily 
life. Auslegung proves to be the basis of the possi-
bility of the pre-ontological Seinsverstiindnis that ev-
eryone possesses, and likewise of the philosopher's 
ontologica! Interpretation that builds further upon it. 
In the ontologica! structure of Dasein this Auslegung 
is the point at which the import of hermeneutics for 
the phenomenological theory of knowledge and con-
sciousness is most apparent: interpretation is estab-
lished in place of the Cartesian and Husserlian themes 
of consciousness and perception, themes that are absent 
from Sein und Zeit because they have been supplanted 
atjust this point. All Auslegung has a "fore"-structure, 
i.e., always implements presuppositions, and it has an 
"as"-structure, i.e., invariably finds meaning in what 
it experiences. Again, just as Heidegger makes TIME a 
central component in human being (which is expressed 
in the title of the book), so he establishes the histor-
ical character of Dasein 's temporality, which brings 
the implication that a given generation can only live 
by a self-interpretation that makes reference back to 
earlier generations (§74). In accord with that histori-
cality is the nature of philosophical analysis itself-
it can never proceed separately from the retrieval and 
interpretation of past philosophical writing (§6). In-
terpretations of Aristotle, KANT, and others will never 

306

be merely supplementary, but central: they will be ger-
mane to ali Heidegger 's philosophizing. The words and 
statements ofhis phenomenology will not abandon past 
philosophy, but conserve, deconstruct, and interpret it, 
preserving the "force of the most elemental words in 
which Dasein has expressed itself." 
Yet Sein und Zeit does not carry out a hermeneu-
tica! shift completely and consistently. Its account of 
discourse (Rede) and language (Sprache) remains fun-
damentally in accord with Husserl's doctrine of the 
intentiona! act that subsequently becomes expressed in 
a linguistic form. Heidegger does not, therefore, show 
a linguistic constitution for everyone's understanding, 
interpretation, and articulation of meaning. For that 
reason, there is no evidence of a social and historical 
matrix for Dasein 's disclosedness and awareness- it 
is as ifthe individual achieved disclosure ali alone, and 
as if Dasein 's disclosure was always of the same type 
in every epoch and every civilization. 
In the years and decades after Sein und Zeit, Heideg-
ger tended less and less to use programmatic titles such 
as "phenomenoJogy," "FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY," and 
"hermeneutics," and for that reason commentators are 
sometimes loath to bring the !ater works under such 
headings. This is connected with the question of the 
"tuming," the Kehre, that was inaugurated in his !ater 
work. It is a controversy in the interpretation of Hei-
degger whether a major rupture was brought about, or 
whether the continuity ofthought is stronger. One fea-
ture that cannot be denied is that the interpretation of 
poetic works as well as interpretations ofpre-Socratic, 
classical, and modern philosophers looms very large, 
so that the !ater work is "hermeneutica!" through and 
through in the original Greek sense of the word (see 
Sein und Zeit, §7c), which signified the very practice 
of making interpretations. And in the course of many 
of these interpretations- whether of Holderlin, Trakl, 
or Stefan George; of Heraclitus, Kant, or Nietzsche-
Heidegger delivered himself ofmany thoughts bearing 
on "hermeneutics" in the modern sense of the word: 
theoretical thoughts regarding the con duct of interpre-
tation. 
He sharply criticized antiquarian scholarship that 
failed to appreciate how the poet's concern, or the 
philosopher's idea, has bearing also upon ourselves 
in our own time. His gift of reading was to make the 
"matters themselves" that were treated in the poem or 
the treatise-das Gedichtete and das Gedachte-Iiv-
ing and actual for the current generation. Yet precisely 
where Heidegger's readings were "hermeneutica!" in 
just this way, they were also "phenomenological," for 
such interpretations could bring the audience to see 
for themselves the "matters themselves" that had moti-
vated the writing. Heidegger also sought often, partic-
ularly in the study of philosophers' texts, to bring to the 
fore that which was "unthought"- das Ungedachte 
-in the work in question; thus these studies are indeed 
phenomenological in the sense ofthe term that he had 
defined in Sein und Zeit. 
These !ater works do reveal the linguistic character 
of ali Dasein 's disclosures, and the epochal, historical 
character of each form of understanding, so, although 
they rarely use the term "hermeneutics," they complete 
the mutation that was begun in Sein und Zeit. 
Heidegger attained great influence in GERMANY, first 
through the explicit phenomenological work of the 
1920s, then through the work of the 1940s and 1950s 
that was implicitly phenomenological. The particular 
heritage of hermeneutica! phenomenology was taken 
up and given a distinctive profile by his student, HANS-
GEORG GAD AMER. Gadamer was a classical scholar who, 
during the 1920s, sought to interpret Plato 's work by 
way of modem phenomenology- his viewpoint was 
thus that ofphenomenology, even as the practice itself 
was hermeneutics. His study ofthe Philebus, published 
in 1931-Platons dialektische Ethik-was described 
in the subtitle as a phenomenological interpretation. 
Gadamer shows us that dialogue, or dialectic, both as 
we see it in the work of Plato and in the nature of 
the matter itself (die Sache), has an ethical root in the 
openness of one speaker to another. Hermeneutics is 
thereby given an ethical twist, and phenomenology an 
intersubjective twist, which will remain characteristic 
of ali his work up to and beyond his magnum opus, 
Wahrheit und Methode (Truth and method, 1960). This 
is described in its subtitle as "Outlines of a Philosoph-
ical Hermeneutics," i.e., a comprehensive theory of 
understanding and interpretation. The prototype of in-
terpretation is, as before, in the Greek ethical principle 
of moral wisdom, phronesis. No interpreter can pro-
ceed alone. Each is always under the guidance of the 
horizon fumished by the language of his or her own 
community, and the history ofthat community's tradi-
tions. 

HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY 
307 
Philosophical henneneutics is no handbook for 
practice, but the investigation of the grounds of the 
possibility for practice: the linguistic character of a 
text, the history of its prior interpretations and effects, 
the linguistic character ofthe interpreter's own projec-
tions and reflections, and so on. Gadamer's theory is 
phenomenological in both a narrow sense and a broader 
sense: it is explicitly indebted to Husserl 's INTENTIONAL-
ITY and Heidegger 's teachings on LANGUAGE and TRUTH; 
more broadly, it maintains that interpretation is fulfilled 
by letting the Sache, the subject matter treated in the 
interpreted text, carne to appearance. Through many 
lectures and writings, Gadamer introduced a German 
public and a world public to central issues in pheno-
menology, hermeneutics, and their sources in the West-
ern tradition. 
Along with Gadamer, it is the French philosopher 
PAUL RICCEUR who has contributed most to making 
hermeneutics known in the world at large. Though 
he began as a Husserl translator and interpreter, his 
work from the 1960s onward tended to move away 
from phenomenology toward a philosophy of lan-
guage, promoting the encounter between hermeneutics 
and other traditions in the philosophy oflanguage such 
as French structuralism and Anglo-American "ORDI-
NARY LANGUAGE ANALYSIS." This work of mediation is 
well represented in Le conflit des interpretations ( 1969) 
and Temps et n?cit (1983). There are other currents 
in modern hermeneutics that have a tenuous connec-
tion at best with phenomenology, such as Hans Robert 
Jauss's Aesthetic Experience and Literary Hermeneu-
tics (1977), and such works fali outside this survey. 
Hermeneutica! phenomenology made considerable 
headway in the English-speaking world from the 1970s 
onward both in terms ofscholarship and in terms of new 
philosophical perspectives. As the works of Husserl, 
Heidegger, Gadamer, Ricceur, and others became avail-
able in translation, there appeared many books and ar-
ticles in English devoted to their work. At the same 
time, English-language philosophers continued to de-
velop this form of thought by exercising it in severa! 
domains of philosophy. 
CALVIN O. SCHRAG, beginning with his 1969 Experi-
ence and Being, has developed a philosophy of lan-
guage out ofthe tradition of hermeneutica! phenomen-
ology. In the philosophy of NATURAL SCIENCE, there ha ve 
been studies both phenomenological and hermeneuti-
cal in character, such as the work of .JOSEPH .1. KOCK-
ELMANS. He has published many studies showing the 
import of Husserl and Heidegger for physics, and his 
teaching and lectures on problems such as scientific 
realism and truth in science have become influen-
tial. In cooperation with THEODORE KISIEL, he edited 
Phenomenology and the Natural Sciences in 1970. 
PATRICK HEELAN draws upon both phenomenology and 
hermeneutics in order to deal with scientific hypothe-
ses and experimentation; in Space-Perception and 
the Philosophy of Science (1983), he links the sci-
ences to perception and its cultural conditions. GRAEME 
NICHOLSON has also treated the philosophy of percep-
tion hermeneutically and phenomenologically in See-
ing and Reading (1984), and his 1992 Illustrations of 
Being develops the consequences for ontology of the 
principle of aur pre-ontological understanding of Be-
ing. 
The discipline of phenomenological analysis and 
the suppleness of hermeneutica! reflection may con-
tinue to nourish each other in the decades to come. 
AESTHETICS, ETHICS, LAW, and RELIGION are certainly do-
mains of philosophical thought -
in addition to the 
philosophy of science, perception, language, and on-
tology- where this tradition may yet ha ve great con-
tributions to make.

HERMENEUTICS 
Hermeneutics is used in 
four different senses. According to the oldest sense 
it is the methodology of the interpretation of texts. 
According to the second sense it is the general theory 
ofunderstanding. According to the third sense it is the 
fundamental-ontologica! interpretation (Aus!egung) of 
Being. The fourth sense restricts hermeneutics to the 
hermeneutics of symbols, a dimension reaching into 
the latent and unconscious. 
Hermeneutics in the first sense was already known 
in antiquity under the name "the art of grammar." This 
art included grammar in the narrower sense but also 
other guidelines for the professional interpretation of 
texts. Mastery ofthis art leads to the universal wisdom 
ofphilology. Philology includes rhetoric, the art ofthe 
application ofthis wisdom, and vice versa. The church 
fathers called the art of grammar "hermeneutics" and 
used its guidelines for the interpretation of the Scrip-
tures, but added guidelines for the understanding of 
their "higher meaning." 
The development of modern methodical hermeneu-
tics starts with a new principle introduced in Protestant 
hermeneutics. This principle, !ater called by Schleier-
macher (1768-1834) the first canon of hermeneutics, 
demands that a text has to be understood in the context 
of its contemporary readers and not in the context of 
the interpreter, because the meaning of the text, origi-
nally clear for contemporary readers, can be darkened 
and corrupted by tradition. Classical philologists in the 
19th century, such as August Boeckh ( 1785-1867), de-
veloped refined hermeneutica! systems. It is their main 
merit to have removed the ambiguities in Schleierma-
cher's formulations of the second canon of hermeneu-
tics. This canon demands that the understanding ofthe 
whole ofthe text presupposes the understanding ofthe 
parts and vice versa, which is called the "hermeneuti-
ca) circ le." This principle is older than the principle of 
the first canon and can be traced back to antiquity. The 
basic thesis of the methodologists of the 19th century 
was that the MEANING of the parts is alrcady partially 
determined by the "whole" ofthe language ofthe time 
and the "whole" of the context of the text. To inter-
pret parts of the texts referring to wholes of this kind 
in the "lower hermeneutics" is precisely what the first 
canon requires. In the interpretation of style in higher 
hermeneutics the whole is the whole of an ensemble 
oftexts ofthe author(s) tobe studied by comparative 
methods. The whole ofthe text occurs only on the level 
of "generic hermeneutics," which interprets the liter-
ary genre and with it the purpose or intention of the 
author(s). 
Methodical hermeneutics has a hierarchy of lev-
els. The work of the lower levels is presupposed 
on the higher levels and assumptions on the higher 
levels clashing with the results of the lower levels 
must be rejected. Violations of this methodical prin-
ciple lead to vicious circularities. The methodologists 
never claimed they understand by method a Cartesian 
method leading to the discovery of"the" true interpre-
tation. Rather, the method eliminates errors; it falsi-
fies. Hermeneutica! methodology is furthermore crit-
ica! in the Kantian sense. It determines the limits of 
the method. The limits occur on the level of generic 
interpretation and critique. 
The method also demands that the work of inter-
pretation and the work of critique must be separated. 
Especially on the generic level the interpretation must 
be done prior to and without presupposing the results 
of higher critique, i.e., the answers to the questions of 
whether the text has attained its purpose and is true 
in this sense. These rules cannot be applied in case 
of the work of the genius, the eminent text. The stan-
dard for critique can only be found by means of the 
interpretation of the eminent text. Thus the circle of 
interpretation and critique, meaning and truth, cannot 
be methodologically dissolved in such cases. 
Recent literature on "traditional" hermeneutics is 
written from the viewpoint of the third or fourth 
sense of hermeneutics, i.e., without being interested 
in method or else having an interest in other methods. 
No real account for the rules and claims ofthe method-
ologists is given. A phenomenological account of the 
method presupposes a correct presentation. 
Hermeneutics as a general theory of understand-
ing can be treated as a branch of phenomenology. The

HERMENEUTICS

is the classification of the human sciences. WILHELM 
DIL TIIEY distinguished .\ystematic HUMAN SCIENCES, e.g., 
ECONOMICS, POLITIC AL SCIENCE, LAW, and SOCIOLOGY, and 
the historical-philologicalhuman sciences. The under-
standing of HISTORY and its function in the human sci-
ences is crucial. History has to apply the results of 
the systematic human sciences, but it also provides 
new material for their further development. History is 
thus not restricted to the interpretation ofwritten doc-
uments, but investigates ali traces ofhuman activities, 
i.e., tools, buildings, works of fine art, and other archae-
ological remains. The modern conception ofhistory is 
essentially governed by a modified vers ion of the first 
canon. Foreign cultures and the past must be treated as 
self-centered and must be each understood in its own 
context. 
The second task of the epistemology of the human 
sciences is a general theory of understanding. This 
theory wili be a phenomenological theory if the fol-
lowing requirements are fulfilied. ( 1) The search for 
causal laws, indispensable for the natural sciences, is 
not of basic significance for the human sciences. (2) 
The method is descriptive and interested in types and 
structures of lived experience. (3) Lived experience is 
not an experience of an in ner private realm but implies 
as an essential factor the givenness of other persons 
and cultural objects. Dilthey's general theory of un-
derstanding fulfilis these requirements. Dilthey never 
calied his general theory ofunderstanding "hermeneu-
tics." Hermeneutics for him is methodical hermeneu-
tics. The general theory of understanding was calied 
hermeneutics only in the literature ofthe second decade 
of our century. Dilthey considered EDMUND HUSSERL 's 
Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901) as a part ofhis 
own research program and !ater calied his own descrip-
tions phenomenological. Husserl, after his criticism of 
historical relativism in "Philosophie als strenge Wis-
senschaft" ( 1911 ), changed his evaluation of Dilthey. 
His own contributions to the epistemology of the hu-
man sciences and a general theory of understanding 
in the ldeen zu einer reinen Phiinomenologie und 
phiinomenologischen Philosophie Il [ 1912-15] and 
Phiinomeno/ogische P.l~\·chologie [ 1925] are exp1ica-
tions ofbasic concepts of Di1they in terms of Husserl 's 
own phenomeno1ogica1 system. He even said that 
Dilthey's idea of a universal human science, if reflect-
ing its own presuppositions, immediately leads to tran-
scendental phenomenology. MARTIN HEIDEGGER intro-
duced the third sense ofhermeneutics as the hermeneu-
tics of Being. Hermeneutics in this sense presupposes 
the ontologica! difference between Being (Sein) and 
beings (das Seiende). The only link between the sec-
ond and the third sense is the role of linguistical-
ity in Heidegger's FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY. The Jink 
still exists after Heidegger abandoned hermeneutics 
and HERMENEUTIC AL PHENOMENOLOGY together with the 
hermeneutica! circle as concepts that are stili too for-
mal for his enterprise. HANS-GEORG GADAMER 's critique 
ofmethodical hermeneutics and hermeneutics as a gen-
eral theory of understanding finds its ultimate ground-
ing in the principle of 1inguisticality. Already Heideg-
ger's move toward the ontologica] difference implies 
a rejection of phenomenology. A hermeneutics of Be-
ing in the medium of 1inguisticality has to cover ali 
understanding, including NATURAL SCIENCES. Methodi-
ca] hermeneutics as such is not interesting from such 
a viewpoint. Seen from the higher viewpoint of lin-
guisticality, methodical hermeneutics and methodical 
approaches in the human sciences are deficient modes 
ofunderstanding.It is necessary to criticize their inau-
thenticity. 
Hermeneutics in the fourth sense was developed by 
PAUL RICCEUR in his investigations of interpretation in 
PSYCHOANALYSIS and the hermeneutics ofsymbols. Both 
be1ong to the hermeneutics ofthe latent. A hermeneu-
tics ofthe latent deals with a latent that is also latent for 
phenomenology. There are reasons for the rejection of 
this thesis, but the discussion ofthis problem belongs to 
the phenomenology of the unconscious and to psycho-
analysis, and not to a phenomenology ofhermeneutics. 
Investigations belonging to phenomenological rsv-
CHOLOGY do not presuppose the transcendenta1-pheno-
menological reduction. It is also not necessary to show 
that the structures under investigation are a priori and 
relate to the EIDETIC METHOD in the phenomenological 
sense. The same holds for a general theory of under-
standing that is phenomenological. 
Dilthey distinguished clementa!)' understanding 
and higher understanding. Elementary understanding 
happens in ali social interactions. What is understood 
is not the other person, but this interaction and its goals. 
The understanding is not restricted to the understand-
ing oflinguistic expressions. The understanding ofthe 
actions of the body of the other and the use of tools 

310 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
one-sidedly found linguistic expressions. Higher un-
derstanding presupposes that the understanding per-
sons interrupt their involvement in interaction and take 
time to understand a whole context of life expressions 
and their meaning and significance. The goal ofhigher 
understanding is the understanding of the life-nexus 
or connectedness of life (Zusammenhang des Lebens). 
The structure ofnME, known immediately in the expe-
rience of ourselves, is the basic presupposed structure. 
The understanding of one's own life history, and its 
meaning and significance for the understanding person, 
is the basic model. The underlying temporal structure 
is, in Husserl's terminology, "appresented" in the un-
derstanding of other persons and their situations and 
life histories as a variant (Modifikation) of ourselves. 
Higher understanding can also be directed toward the 
sequence oflife expressions in the work ofart.lt is not 
the author ofthe work of art who is understood, but the 
work ofart as an expression oflife. 
Finally, higher understanding can be interested in 
the intersubjective structures of elementary under-
standing in its different dimensions -
family, econ-
omy, law, and politica! power. The phenomenological 
analysis of the different dimensions is an analysis of 
the basic concepts guiding the systematic human sci-
ences. The understanding of fixed life expressions on 
the linguistic level of texts and on the pre-linguistic 
level of tools, buildings, paintings, and sculpture, to 
the extent to which they represent past connectedness 
oflife, is the realm ofthe methodical understanding of 
the historical human sciences. Dilthey recognizes the 
work of the methodologists, but adds two viewpoints. 
First, lower hermeneutics has the preparatorytask ofre-
constructing the linguistic and the historical context of 
fixed life expressions in the past and in foreign cultures. 
It is the work demanded by the first canon. The work 
of higher understanding is the real task of hermeneu-
tics. It presupposes method but in addition a divinatory 
element leading to the hermeneutic correspondence be-
tween interpreter and text. Empathy is already required 
for a successful elementary understanding. The ability 
of emphathy is a divine gift, a talent. Some ha ve this 
talent in a very high degree. Successful work in higher 
hermeneutics requires not only methodical skills but 
an outstanding talent for empathy. Second, the study of 
effective connectedness, !ater called effective history 
(Wirkungsgeschichte), is tobe added, i.e., the history 
of the interpretation and application of fixed life ex-
pressions in the tradition- e.g., Shakespeare 's plays, 
Newton 's physics, Kant's Critique, the New Testament, 
the Forum Romanum, the White House. 
The material-ontologica! region of cultural objects 
and the general structures of the life environment 
(Lebensumwelt) or LIFEWORLD (Lebenswelt) is, accord-
ing to Husserl, the region of the human sciences. He 
gives general hints about the system ofthe human sci-
ences and the task of phenomenological research in 
this field. The references to Dilthey indicate that he 
considered Dilthey's work as a major achievement. He 
also shares Dilthey's view that phenomenological psy-
chology is the basic discipline ofthe human sciences. 
Husserl 's ma in contribution to the general theory of 
understanding is his analysis of INTERSUBJECTIVITY and 
the givenness of the other. Though he developed this 
theory in his published work only in the framework of 
transcendental phenomerwlogy, it can be considered on 
the level of a mundane phenomenology without fac ing 
the problem of solipsism. The givenness of the other 
originally occurs in the animal realm and the givenness 
of objects in the proper sense, including cultural ob-
jects, is founded in the givenness of other persons. The 
structures of this givenness are the condition for the 
passive associative appresentation of the other as an-
other living BODY. That the other is appresented means 
that the experience ofthe other cannot be given in orig-
inal EVIDENCE forme. It occurs as a transcendence in the 
immanence, as an absence that will never be present as 
such. I am bound to my own body and cannot have the 
experience of the other person in his or her own body. 
Understanding starts with elementary understanding. 
The other person is given as a variant (Modifikation) 
ofmyselfin his or her interactions with me. The devel-
opment of forms of higher understanding is sketched 
out by Husserl in the fifth ofhis Cartesianische Medita-
tionen [ 1931] and the manuscripts on intersubjectivity. 
The presupposition of ali predicative linguistic un-
derstanding is the givenness of the other and the 
elementary understanding of the other on the pre-
predicative level. Seen from the viewpoint of FORMAL 
AND MATERIAL ONTOLOGY, the animal region for itseJf 
is given only after performing an abstractive reduction 
in the lifeworld. Seen from the viewpoint of GENETIC 
PHENOMENOLOGY, the givenness ofthe other on the ani-
mallevel is one-sidedly founding for the givenness of 

HERMENEUTICS 
311 
the cultural objects in the lifeworld. Husserl's general 
theory of understanding is thus opposed to the turn to 
pure linguisticality. He recognizes what in other theo-
ries is called the "material" conditions of understand-
ing. It is an explication of Dilthey's thesis that objec-
tifications of life always imply nature in the sense in 
which nature is given in cultural contexts. Husserl's 
theory is furthermore in accordance with independent 
investigations of other phenomenologists such as ARON 
GURWITSCH, ALFRED SCHUTZ, and aJso MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY. Schutz's work is the main phenomenological 
contribution to a general theory of the systematic hu-
man sciences. 
Phenomenological investigations concerning me-
thodical hermeneutics have to presuppose the general 
phenomenological theory of understanding and inter-
subjectivity, but in addition they ha veto deal with spe-
cific questions. The differences in the structures of oral 
and written discourse have to be analyzed. Such an 
analysis leads to the difference between life expres-
sions bound to the temporal phase in which they occur 
and fixed life expressions that can be given as the same 
again in different phases oftime. Method presupposes 
fixed life expressions, fixed discourse. What Husserl 
said about writing as a presupposition for the origin of 
geometry is useful in this respect. Some observations of 
.IACQUES DERRIDA and others can be taken into account 
as well after bracketing their speculative background. 
The second problem is the difference of a literary 
tradition with and without methodical hermeneutics. 
Gadamer's theses about effective history, the priority 
of the lived tradition, and the impossibility of inter-
preters to reflect on themselves outside the context of 
the historicity of lived tradition can be derived from 
the phenomenology of the time of lived experience. 
His theses about linguisticality, however, are not ac-
ceptable from a phenomenological point of view. A 
phenomenological account ofunderstanding is also in-
terested in method. It has to analyze the "unclear ide-
alizations" underlying the method. Every methodical 
discipline, every science, presupposes specific ideal-
izations and abstractive reductions. The idealization of 
methodical hermeneutics is given with the decision to 
consider a past, represented in a fixed life expression, 
as a past present. The abstractive reduction brackets 
the fact that the fu ture ofthis pastisa past for the inter-
preter's present. Bracketing the future horizon of the 
past present means that ali assumptions about meaning 
and significance in the future horizon must be rejected 
ifthey are incompatible with contents in the context of 
the past present. 
The abstractive reduction also brackets application, 
because application happens in the present of the in-
terpreter. Interpretations and applications ofthe text in 
its fu ture horizon can be studied methodically if their 
past present is considered under the reduction. The re-
suit is a methodical study of the efficient history of 
a text. The abstractive reduction and idealization do 
not imply that interpreters reflect on themselves out-
side the lived tradition. The scientist performing his or 
her specific abstractive reductions does not and cannot 
leave the lifeworld either. Already Dilthey insists that 
the research of the human sciences has significance 
only if applied to the present self-understanding of the 
tradition. 
The next task is a phenomenological account ofthe 
genesis of methodical hermeneutics. It is essential to 
recognize that positive application of a tradition is al-
ways accompanied in complex literary traditions by 
rejections and repressions of parts of the tradition as 
false. To apply the Christian tradition means to reject 
the Jewish and Hellenistic traditions. Dilthey's invcs-
tigations have shown that the first canon is the result 
of reflecting on a specific situation in which a long 
tradition of the interpretation of a group of texts sti il 
recognized as true is rejected as false. A phenomen-
ological analysis of the genesis of pre-methodical and 
methodical hermeneutics has to analyze the structures 
of the interplay of application and rejection and the 
different rules for a scholarly treatment of texts in the 
literary tradition connected with them. Different types 
of hermeneutica! consciousness, i.e., attitudes of con-
sciousness toward tradition, and their genesis must be 
distinguished. The part-whole relation of the second 
canon will be of significance in this respect. A pheno-
menological theory ofparts and wholes can be used to 
analyze the different part-whole relations occurring in 
pre-methodical and methodical hermeneutica! proce-
dures. 
Other problems occur in the interpretation of fixed 
life expressions not connected with written discourse of 
the time. The possibilities and limits ofthe understand-
ing of such traces need clarification. The application 
of methods grounded in certain results of the natural 

312 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
sciences also requires phenomenological clarification. 
The basic question concerns how nature is a necessary 
and indispensable part of the cultural world and the 
lifeworld.

HISTORY 
In order to understand the complex 
relationship between phenomenology and history, the 
best place to begin is doubtless EDMUND HUSSERL 's essay 
"Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft" ( 1911 ). Husserl 
stands ready to unveil the "phenomenological grasp of 
essence" (die phanomenologische Wesense1jassung) as 
the culmination ofthe EIDETIC METHOD that will enable 
philosophy to be at last what is has always wanted 
but has so far failed to be: strict or rigorous science. 
But readers are told very little there about that method; 
they will have to wait for the ldeen zu einer reinen 
Phanomenologie und phanomenologischen Philoso-
phie l ( 1913 ). Instead, the essay is polemic, deal ing 
primarily with what Husserl considers the two greatest 
threats in his day to the ideal of philosophy as rigor-
ous science and its realization. The first is "naturalistic 
philosophy," which "falsifies" the ideal, i.e., pursues 
the idea of rigor in the wrong way; and the second is 
"historicism and Weltanschauungsphilosophie,"which 
"weakens" and ultimately calls into question the pur-
suit ofthe ideal altogether. 
In the latter case, some philosophers look at the his-
tory of thought and only see a series of failed attempts 
to ascertain eterna! truth. With this assessment Husserl 
wholeheartedly agrees. But then they move from that 
to the conclusion that philosophy can never be more 
than the expression of the Weltanschauung of its eul-
ture and its historical period. (Though he does not say 
so directly, Husserl implicates WILHELM DILTHEY in this 
move.) For Husserl this is an invalid inference and an 
instance ofthe self-refuting relativism he had attacked 
in the Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-190 1 ). Philos-
ophy should stop mulling over its own past and get 
on with its task. The history of philosophy is fine as 
a branch of history, but should not be substituted for 
philosophy itself. This is part of the meaning of the 
injunction "to the matters themselves." It is reinforced 
in the ldeen where Husserl tells us, even before intro-
ducing phenomenological bracketing, that we should 
in effect "bracket" the entire history of philosophy. 
Philosophy may in fact be in history, but its aim is to 
transcend history toward the timeless essences that are 
tobe grasped by phenomenology. 
Of course, this does not prevent phenomenology 
from attempting to grasp the essence of history itself, 
and Husserl makes some early efforts in that direction. 
"Geschichte" refers, like its English equivalent, both to 
the course ofhuman events, principally in the past, and 
to the discipline whose aim is to know those events. 
In severa! ways Husserl is like Dilthey and the neo-
Kantians ofhis time: he abjures Hegelian-style specu-
lation about the grand sweep ofhistory, aims instead at 
the clarification of historical knowledge, and consid-
ers history a HUMAN SCIENCE that cannot be reduced to 
Of integrated with the NATURAL SCIENCES. History is an 
empirica! discipline and thus deals with facts. But the 
facts it is concerned with are not those of the natural 
world. In ldeen ll [ 1912-15] Husserl works out the no-
tion ofthe spiritual or cultural world (geistige Welt) as 
a distinct region of reality with its own a priori ontol-

HISTORY 
ogy and its way ofbeing constituted in consciousness. 
Husserl 's approach throughout is to trace the basic con-
cepts ofscience back to the prescientific WORLD and the 
attitudes we take toward it. The "natural attitude" of 
ldeen 1 is subdivided in ldeen Il into the "naturalistic" 
and the "personalistic" attitudes, and it is in the Jatter 
that the human sciences have their source. The basic 
entities here are not things, but persons and communi-
ties of persons, and the basic occurrences are experi-
ences, thoughts, and actions that stand under relations 
of motivation rather than causality. 
When these structures of personal and social exis-
tence are related to TIME, they reveal features we think 
of as historical. Persons are not "in" time in the same 
way that things and natural events are in time. They do 
not simply persist through time, and the events of one 
moment in one's life do not simply produce those of 
the next causally. Rather, the past has meaning for the 
person, and forms an intentiona! background or hori-
zon for present and future. Persons "survey" time and 
think ofthemselves and the communities to which they 
belong in terms of their past and fu ture. 
By the time of the Cartesianische Meditationen 
[ 1931] Husserl was sufficiently attentive to both the 
social and historical aspects of conscious experience 
that he attributes them to transcendental and not merely 
to empirica! or "personal" consciousness. Constitution 
is cumulative and requires GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY; 
the EGO is not merely an empty subjective pole but is 
the substrate ofhabitualities. The ego constitutes itself 
for itself, he says, "in the unity of a history." While 
this statement suggests something like a personal or 
individual history, Husserl goes on in the Fifth Med-
itation to a discussion of "personalities of a higher 
order," i.e., social groups or communities conceived as 
collective subjects that likewise constitute themselves 
through their history (a theme already touched on in 
the "Gemeingeist" manuscripts of a decade earlier). 
This growing appreciation for the historical char-
acter of even transcendental subjectivity achieves its 
fullest expression in Husserl 's last work, Die Krisis 
der europaischen Wissenschaften und die transzen-
dentale Phanomenologie (1936). In part this may re-
flect the renewed influence of Dilthey. Though the lat-
ter had died in 1912, his collected works were being 
published posthumously. In 1927 volume 7 appeared, 
containing Dilthey's late manuscript on Der Au/bau 
313 
der geschichtlichen Welt in den Geisteswissenschaften 
(The make-up ofthe historical world in the human sci-
ences, [ 191 0]). Husserl was acquainted with this vol-
ume at Jeast through the work of his assistant LUDWIG 
LANDGREBE and of GEORG MISCH, who both pubJished 
significant studies of Dilthey in relation to phenomen-
ology in those years. There is some irony in the fact that 
Dilthey should have played a positive role here, since 
he was the intended target of Husserl's early polemic 
against historicism. 
In any case, Husserl's concern with history emerges 
in his last work out of his reflection on the sta tus and 
significance of science. It is a mistake to think that the 
scientific consciousness can simply transcend its con-
crete social situation and go directly to the TRUTH. The 
pursuit oftheoretical truth is itself historical. Even if it 
is the nature of consciousness to engage in this pursuit, 
the individual always inherits it as an ongoing activ-
ity of the society in which he or she takes it up. The 
incipient scientist also builds on the results already ob-
tained by others. Thus although a cognitive endeavor 
such as science -
even a "pure" or ideal discipline 
like geometry -
is pursued by individuals, it owes 
its undertaking in each case, as well as its capacity to 
advance, to the social context in which it exists. Each 
inquirer depends on the sedimented acquisitions ofhis 
or her predecessors.While the cognitive life ofthe indi-
vidual owes its birth to the social context, and depends 
on the same context for its success, there is a negative 
side to this dependence. The concepts and methods 
taken over from the tradition can equally function as 
prejudices that skew the individual 's perspective on the 
subject matter. It can happen in any field that theoret-
ical progress requires not building on, but criticizing 
and rejecting what is handed down. But even this takes 
place against the background ofthe discipline's tacitly 
accepted goals, problems, methods, and basic concepts. 
Thus even conceived as a critica! enterprise opposed 
to accepting anything on authority, science belongs to 
a historical tradition. 
In the Krisis Husserl recognizes that this analysis is 
no less true of philosophy itself than it is of the other 
disciplines. In the modern era philosophy has taken 
over from the sciences its mathematical-physical con-
ception ofthe world and then failed to understand sub-
jectivity because it has tried to explain it causally as an 
element within that world. Even KANT, who recognizes 

314 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the constitutive role of subjectivity, sti li conceives of 
the latter purely in relation to a scientifically construed 
world. Thus there is a need to return to the LIFEWORLD 
in which subjectivity has its home prior to science, 
and in which the activity of science, and every other 
cognitive activity, including philosophy itself, has its 
point of departure. While the sciences do not need to 
understand themselves philosophically in order to suc-
ceed, it is philosophy's task to understand them, and 
this means tracing them back to their prescientific ori-
gins. But philosophy must likewise understand itself, 
and must accordingly circle back on its own origins in 
the lifeworld. 
lfthe world-as-portrayed-by-science turns out tobe 
a historically developed and thus in some sense contin-
gent phenomenon, the prescientific lifeworld, by con-
trast, seems universal and necessary. Yet Husserl rec-
ognizes that the lifeworld is itself historical in a less 
obvious but more important way. Like the common-
sense world evoked by other philosophers with sim-
ilar concerns, the lifeworld turns out to contain the 
sediments of past scientific accomplishments. The pre-
given, naively intuited world of any individual, inno-
cent of explicit theoretical interpretation, is therefore 
a historically sedimented cultural world that may dif-
fer radically from the similarly naive world of another 
culture or historical period. 
Thus Husserlmoves from his early, rather hasty dis-
missal ofthe importance ofhistory, at least for philos-
ophy, to an almost obsessive preoccupation with it, to a 
conception of consciousness as deeply and pervasively 
historical at every level -
prescientific and scientific, 
individual and social. And he is led in this direction by 
phenomenology itself, in his usual relentless pursuit 
of die Sachen selbst. Yet this result is bound to raise 
serious questions about the original idea of phenomen-
ology as rigorous science- that is, as the inquiry that 
rises above historical contingency to attain universal 
eidetic structures. Though Husserl in the Krisis is far 
from giving up on the ideal -
indeed, he presents 
phenomenology with even more missionary zeal than 
ever before- it is clear that he is struggling mightily 
with some of the more disturbing implications of his 
own conception of history. 
Most of Husserl 's successors in the phenomenologi-
cal movement take over and develop further the con-
ception of historicity found in his late work. MAURICE 
MERLEAU-PONTY especially, as well as PAUL RICCEUR, are 
strongly inftuenced by the Krisis in their approach to 
phenomenology. In their work and in that of JEAN-PAUL 
SARTRE -
especially after L'etre et le neant ( 1943) 
-
and SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, the inftuencc of HEGEL 
and MARX leads to a heavily historicized conception of 
consciousness and human existence. For these thinkers 
the acknowledgment ofhistoricity is not fatal to pheno-
menology, but it does contribuie, together with other 
considerations, to a substantial curtailment of its pre-
tensions. The capacity to grasp timeless esscnces, and 
thus to attain the status of a rigorous scicnce, is no 
longer touted as phenomenology's chief virtue, as it 
was by the early Husserl, but phenomenology itself. 
somewhat more modestly conceived, survives. 
The case is somewhat different for MARTIN IIEI-
DEGGER, whose ideas on historicity developed con-
currently with those of Husserl. In a late chapter of 
Sein und Zei! (1927) Heidegger takes up the topic of 
Geschichtlichkeit (historicity) and reveals that he too 
has been inftuenced by Dilthey. Up to this point his 
discussion of authentic human existence has empha-
sized DASEIN's relation to the future and to the prospect 
of death. Now he turns his attention to birth and ori-
gins. His previous discussion of social existence or 
being-with-others as a dimension of Oase in had tied it 
primarily to inauthenticity (das Man ), suggesting that 
authenticity means isolation. Now he suggests that we 
derive possibilities of authentic existence by choosing 
heros and taking over existing traditions from the past. 
For many readers of Sein und Zeit, especially those 
inftuenced by the Sartrean EXISTENTIALISM it helped to 
inspire, one is struck by a sharp contrast when one 
arrives at this chapter: the authentic self, which had 
seemcd a figure oficonoclastic rebellion from the mass, 
now emerges as a stern and proud traditionalist paying 
homage by obedience to the authority ofthe past. 
But this conception of the historical character of 
Dasein is really only a reflection of a much deeper 
and more thoroughgoing notion of historicity that en-
compasses the nature of understanding and ultimately 
that of truth itself. Unlike Husserl, Heidegger is not 
content to raise questions about the historical character 
of knowledge, reason, and understanding. He is con-
vinced that human existence is radically finite, under-
standing is a projection of Oase in 's facticity, and truth 
is something like a historical occurrence ( Geschehen ). 

HUMAN SCIENCES 
315 
Such a conception is bound to conflict with the mani-
festly "transcendental" project of Sein und Zeit to artic-
ulate the general, i.e., the presumably timeless and tran-
shistorical, structures of human existence. This leads 
Heidegger, not long after the publication ofthat work, 
to what most interpreters see as an abandonment of 
phenomenology, at least in any form that could appear 
continuous with Husserl or even with the phenomen-
ological tradition in FRANCE. And it may be largely the 
influence ofthis !ater Heidegger in France that leads to 
the decline of phenomenology in that country during 
the POSTMODERN phase. It remains to be seen whether 
phenomenology will be done in by a conception ofhis-
tory that originally arose from phenomenology itself.

HUMAN SCIENCES 
DAVID CARR 
Emory Universi(v 
Also called the "eul-
tura! sciences," the human sciences (die Geisteswis-
senschaften, les sciences humaines) are special or pos-
itive theoretical sciences that are concerned in various 
ways with aspects of human cultural life and cultural 
worlds. These disciplines are related to practica! appli-
cations as well as to the everyday prescientific life from 
which they, like ali sciences and also philosophy, origi-
nale. This genus ofsciences currently includes COMMU-
NICOLOGY, ECONOMICS, ETHNOLOGY, GEOGRAPHY, HISTORY, 
POLITIC AL SCIENCE, PSYCHOLOGY, and SOCIOLOGY as sin-
gle disciplines, but human or cultural sciences are also 
increasingly included in multidisciplines such as EHI-
NIC STUDIES and those re}ated to ECOLOGY, FEMINISM, 
RELIGION, and TECHNOLOGY. The rise of sciences of this 
kind, which ha ve their prehistories in the medieval and 
ancient worlds and were accelerated through the ex-
panding contact with non-European societies in recent 
centuries, is as much a distinctive feature ofthe modern 
Western wor}d as the rise ofthe NATURAL SCIENCES. 
Beyond such chiefly theoretical disciplines there 
are what can be called normative, evaluative, or axi-
otic disciplines, which are concerned with ARCHITFC-
TURE, DANCE, FILM, LITERATURE, MUSIC, THEATER, etc., 
and there are also practica/ disciplines, such as ED-
UCATION, LAW, MEDICINE, NURSING, PIIYSICAL EDUCATION, 
and PSYCHIATRY. A broader category, CULTURAL DISCI-
PLINES, has been called for and theoretical, axiotic, 
and practica! species might then be recognized within 
it, although many cultural "sciences" already include 
practica! components, e.g., the way psychotherapy is 
often considered part of psychology. Practica! action 
always has cognitive foundations within it and when 
these foundations are scientific, scientific technologies 
and technigues can be spoken of. There are also eval-
uational foundations in, e.g., social work, that make 
nontheoretical disciplines normative. 
The mentioned non-philosophical disciplines have 
not only been reflected upon from standpoints in 
phenomenological philosophy, but also increasingly 
have phenomenological tendencies within them. Non-
philosophical contributors to disciplines affected by or 
convergent with philosophical phenomenology include 
the psychiatrists LUDWIG BINSWANGER and KARL JASPERS 
and the SOCioJogists GEORG SIMML'L and MAX WERER. Dis-
tinguishing philosophy as such from human science is 
among the problems of the philosophy of the human 
sciences. 
A human scientific discipline can be said to be 
phenomenological, first, if it is devoted to basing 
knowledge on the best possible EVIDENCE ofthe matters 
themselves in the relevant region. This evidence can 
occur with respect to the ancient Hellenic world, for 
example, not only through the study of texts, but also

through considering depictions and artifactual and non-
artifactual remains, the last mentioned including, e.g., 
the remains of wild animals, such as fish bones, that 
were available as food in the ecosystem of an ancient 
society. 
Second, it is characteristic of phenomenology in 
general for matters, persons and communities included, 
tobe taken as they present themselves to and are dealt 
with in the cultural life reflected upon, in which case 
the belief systems, value systems, and systems of ends 
and means correlative to the habitual believing, valu-
ing, and willing discernible in that culturallife can be 
reflectively observed and analyzed from the theoretical 
standpoint of a cultural science. The approach is then 
reflective, and such an approach is not alien to human 
sciences and philosophy prior to and independent of 
the rise of phenomenology. 
Third, an approach that is phenomenological distin-
guishes description of what phenomena are from the 
explanation ofthem in terms ofpsychological motives, 
historical influences, etc., and emphasizes both empir-
ica! descriptions and the a priori descriptions attain-
able through EIDFTIC METIIOD (most cultural scientific 
description and explanation is, however, in terms of 
empirica! types). 
Phenomenological phi losophy and phenomenologi-
cal human science are not distinguished, however, in 
these three respects, which they share. Some phenome-
nologists distinguish philosophical and cultural scien-
tific phenomenology in terms ofthe transcendental vs. 
the mundane attitude, others in terms ofthe ontologica! 
vs. the ontic, and yet others in terms of o ne worldly dis-
cipline, phenomenological psychology or PHILOSOPHI-
CAL ANTHROPOLOGY, on which the other disciplines are 
founded. 
There is an early history ofthe philosophy ofthe hu-
man sciences that goes back to Hume's Treatise ( 1739) 
and Mill's Logic (1843), where the title "moral sci-
ences" is used, if not to Vico, Hegel, Aristotle, Plato, 
and especially to the Sophists. The history, however, of 
this part ofphilosophy ofscience was foca! for the neo-
Kantians, most recently ERNST CASSIRER, as well as for 
various phenomenologists, and began in relation to WIL-
HELM DILTHl'Y's Ein/eitung in die Geisteswissenschaften 
(lntroduction to the Human Sciences, 1883). 
The expression Geisteswissenscha{t, currently ren-
dered in English as "human science," has been traced 
back to the Geschichte des Hellenismus (History of 
Hellenism, 1843) of Johann Droysen ( 1808~1884 ), but 
Dilthey made it prominent. The human sciences for 
Dilthey include the more humane disciplines that study 
the arts, the more socially oriented sciences, such as po-
litica! theory, and the more normative disciplines such 
as AESTHETICS and ETHICS, and his broad title for these 
disciplines played a certain role in the administrative 
structure ofthe Imperial German university. 
Dilthey is best known for defending the indepen-
dence ofthe human sciences from the natural sciences, 
but he also recognized that the world of spirit or eul-
ture is never separable from nature and that both kinds 
of science have a common base in our prescientific 
understanding of life. The difference for him is that 
the human sciences never Iose sight of the need to un-
derstand the original wholeness, connectedness, and 
purposefulness of life, while the natural sciences be-
gin with separated partial elements whose connections 
must be explained by hypothetical generalizations. 
Against the neo-Kantians Wilhelm Windelband 
(1848~1915) and Heinrich Rickert (1863~1936) ~ 
who were concerned to distinguish psychology from 
transcendental philosophy, considered it a natural sci-
ence, and excluded it from the Kulturwissenscha{ten 
~ Dilthey included psychology in the Geisteswis-
senschaften. His position became widely accepted 
in Germany; furthermore, these two titles are inter-
changeable in Cassirer's final writings and also in 
those of ALFRED SCHUTZ. The !ater Dilthey relied in-
creasingJy on the interpretation of expressions and ob-
jectivations of experience and Lebensphilosophie und 
Phanomenologie ( 1930), by Dilthey's follower GFORG 
MISCH, was widely read. Dilthey considered EDMUND 
HUSSERL 's Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-190 1) sup-
port for his project and Husserl came to acknowl-
edge considerable influence on him by Dilthey. In 
"Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft" ( 1911 ), Husserl 
objected to considering philosophy a worldview be-
cause that led to historicism, RELATIVISM, and skep-
ticism. But after correspondence with Dilthey, study 
of others such as Windelband and Rickert, and his 
own investigations of the constitution of the cultural 
world in the ldeen zu einer reinen Phanomeno/ogie 
und phanomenologischen Phi/osophie Il [ 1912~ 15) 
and elsewhere, he accepted Dilthey's problematics and 
advocated the phenomenological philosophy ofthe hu-

HUMAN SCIENCES 
317 
man sciences, which is also evident in Die Krisis der 
europăischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale 
Philosophie ( 1936). 
Husserl distinguished sciences in the "personal-
istic attitude" from those in the naturalistic attitude 
of the natural sciences and recognized both a natu-
ral scientific psychology and a human scientific psy-
chology, in the latter respect also adopting the strat-
egy ofproceeding from a human scientific psychology 
to how the social and historical world is constituted. 
In Phănomenologische Psychologie [ 1925] he praised 
Dilthey's psychology as a true phenomenological psy-
chology and advocated a way to transcendental pheno-
menology from Dilthey's universal human science as 
an alternative to his own Cartesian way that began, by 
contrast, in complete emptiness of content. This alter-
native path begins from the LIFEWORLD and ultimately 
invo[ves GENERATIVE PIIENOMENOLOGY. 
Besides the view of the lifeworld as cultural, 
Husserl 's own contributions are especially related to IN-
TERSUB.IECTIVITY and TIME-consciousness. Dilthey's dis-
tinction between elementary understanding and higher 
understanding can be used to refine Husserl's analyses. 
The former is immediate and does not usually require 
methodical interpretation, while the latter, founded 
upon it, requires empathic activities of reliving the 
social, historical, and personal contexts of life expres-
sions as structured wholes. Husserl 's phenomenology 
ofthe cultural world chiefly pertains to systematic hu-
man sciences such as economics, sociology, jurispru-
dence, and politica! science. Dilthey's concern with the 
historical and philological human sciences and their 
methods, i.e., HERMENEUTICS, is, however, missing in 
Husserl, but can be supplied. 
Husserl 's students LUDWIG LANDGREBE and FRITZ 
KAUFMANN wrote dissertations that were explicitly con-
cerned with Dilthey in relation to phenomenology, and 
EDITII STEIN and GERDA WALTHER earlier published es-
says in Husserl 's Jahrbuch on topics pertinent to the 
human sciences. MAX scHELER offered relevant insights 
on empathy, group solidarity, VALUE THEORY, and the 
sociology of knowledge. 
Philosophical reflections especially on the WORLD 
as historical and on history as a science of it are to 
be found in MARTIN HEIDEGGER's work, beginning with 
Sein und Zeit ( 1927). Heidegger is also chiefly respon-
sible for beginning the post-Diltheyan discussions of 
interpreti ve methods within HERMENEUTIC AL PHENOMEN-
OLOGY and for the enduring phenomenological con-
cerns with HISTORY, LANGUAGE, and TECHNOLOGY, which 
ha ve been carried further by IIANS-GEORG GADAMER, DON 
IHDE, .IOSEPII .1. KOCKELMANS, and PAUL RICCEUR. 
In Der sinnhafte Aufbau der sozialen Welt (The 
meaningful structure of the social world, 1932) and 
Collected Papers ( 1962-96), Alfred Schutz began phi-
losophizing about the social world and the specifi-
cally social sciences, particularly Weberian-style so-
ciology and Austrian-school economics. doing so in 
the perspective of a CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY OF 
TIIE NATURAL ATTITUDE; this effort has been contin-
ued by MAURICE NATANSON and others. Subsequent 
contributors to transcendenta[ CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMEN-
OLOGY of the cultural or human sciences include ARON 
GURWITSCII and THOMAS M. SEEBOHM. In FRANCE, the 
classica[ expression in EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY is 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY's "Les sciences de ['homme 
et la phenomenologie" ( 1961 ). His student, GEORGES 
GUSDORF, wrote lntroduction aux sciences humaines 
( 1960). Ricceur's hermeneutica[ phenomenology carne 
!ater. Non-phenomenologists in France, such as MICHEL 
FOUCAULT, and in GERMANY, such as Jiirgen Habermas, 
ha ve also been interested in the philosophy of the hu-
man sciences. lnterest in the philosophy of the hu-
man sciences as such in the UNITED STATES is chiefly 
phenomenological, but there is also interest in them 
in STRUCTURALISM, CRITIC AL THEORY, and even ANALYTIC 
PHILOSOPHY. 
Systematically speaking, the philosophy of the hu-
man or cultural sciences has a vast and complex subject 
matter. Natural matters- including those with psy-
ches, genetic endowments, and ecosystems-are rela-
tively easy to distinguish, classify, and re late, while the 
types of human persons, communities, and traditions 
approached in the cultural sciences are more numerous 
and have more aspects amenable to thematization, as 
the disciplines and multidisciplines listed at the outset 
of this entry already indicate. And unlike the natural 
sciences, the human sciences are prone to a reflexiv-
ity whereby there can be a sociology of psychology, 
an economics of sociology, a history of historiogra-
phy, etc., and also an overlapping of provinces, which 
hardly simplifies their tasks. 
Nevertheless, the human sciences can, upon reflec-
tion, be seen to approach the cultural world in o ne or an-

318 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
other ofthree species ofperspectives. This is analogous 
to the sorting of naturalistic sciences into the physical 
and the biologica!. The most popular approach begins 
with a reflective-experiential thematization of individ-
ual or personal human life, and then proceeds through 
social psychology to approach the social and then the 
historical world. Since there are actually severa! disci-
plines ~ 
e.g., child psychology, geriatrie psychology, 
and psychology of learning ~ 
within the psychologi-
cal perspective, it seems best to speak in the plural of 
psychological human sciences. 
Alfred Schutz bcgins with the constitution ofmean-
ingful behavior within an abstractly nonsocial individ-
ual life and then divides the world of others or social 
world in a broad signification into directly encountered 
"consociates," indirectly encountered but also simul-
taneously alive "contemporaries," and then the "pre-
decessors" and the "successors," who are of course 
deceased or yet to be born, respcctively. Consociates 
and contcmporaries make up the social world in a nar-
rower signification. There is interes! in the constitution 
of groups in these regions, but Schutz's emphasis is on 
the individuals and their social actions, interactions, 
and relationships. 
As Dilthey showed in Die Aufbau der geschicht-
lichen Welt in den Geisteswissenscha(ten [The con-
struction ofthe historical world in the human sciences, 
191 0], it is also possible, however, to begin in the phi-
losophy of the cultural sciences not with individual or 
personal life, but rather with collective or communal 
life. This can be done in two ways. In social sciences 
such as linguistics and politica] science, the function-
ing of communal life in relation to language or to the 
politica! system is considered synchronically, i.e., with 
great emphasis on how these systems are structured at 
a given time, usually the present. To be sure, histor-
ical considerations are not absolutely excluded when 
such aspects of the cultural world at one time are in-
vestigated, but they are subordinated. Because social 
scientific results often ha ve practica! applications in the 
current situation, the articulation of social science into 
particular sciences and academic departments and the 
numbers of scientists in them are considerably greater 
than in the psychological and historical sciences. For 
this reason and others, such as the current traditional 
academic classifications ofpsychology as a natural sci-
ence and of history as part of the humanities, the phi-
losophy of the human sciences is often narrowed into 
a philosophy ofthe social sciences. 
Yet there are also what are best called historical 
sciences, species of which include politica! history, 
economic history, history oftechnology, history ofart, 
military history, etc., whether or not these particulars 
are recognized as distinct disciplines with separate de-
partments in universities. Archaeology, for example, 
is properly understood as a historical human science, 
but, at least in most American universities, it is inter-
estingly combined with ethnology under the heading of 
"cultural anthropology" and placed among the social 
sciences. The historical sciences nonetheless ha ve it in 
common to thematizc the cultural world not only as it 
is lived communally, but also in a diachronic way, i.e., 
to emphasize continuities and changes over time. 
The human sciences have in general been much in-
fluenced by NATURALISM during the past two centuries. 
This is manifest in the positivistic attempt to imi tate the 
natural sciences by treating cultural objects as natural 
objects, if not physical things, and resorting to math-
ematics whenever possible. Opponents of positivistic 
tendencies within the human sciences and the philoso-
phy ofthem often reject mathematical methods, which 
seems unfortunate, in order to emphasize sheerly qual-
itative and interpreti ve methods. It is also important to 
recognize that cultural situations and worlds are formed 
of objects with cultural characteristics, i.e., the values 
and uses whereby objects are good and bad and ends 
and means. 
Some phenomenologists emphasize the considera-
tion of cultural characteristics not only as what distin-
guishes the region of the cultural sciences, but also as 
what justifies the contention that the latter ha ve prior-
ity over the former, which, phenomenologically, would 
seem to require an abstraction for the derivation of 
their naturalistic regions. When acceptance of the val-
ues and uses of cultural objects is not abstracted from 
for the sake of natural science, there can bea tendency 
of researchers to identify with ( or oppose) the cultural 
worlds they research. 
Besides the questions of the generic, specific, and 
particular subject matters and scienccs thematized in 
the phenomenological philosophy ofthe human or cul-
tural sciences ~ and the questions of the relations 
between such sciences and the natural and formal sci-
ences, on the one hand, and also between them and

thc everyday life from which they arise and in which 
their results are employed for practica! purposes, on 
the other hand- there are long stand ing methodolog-
ica/ prob/ems that have interested phenomenological 
philosophers. 
In the background of such problems are the prob-
lems in early 20th century neo-Kantianism concerning 
the social vs. the historical sciences in terms of distinc-
tions between generalizing and nomothetic vs. partic-
ularizing and idiographic disciplines, which have also 
been of concern to LOGICAL POSITIVISM, but ha ve not yet 
held much interest for phenomenologists. 
Stemming chiefly from the historical sciences, there 
is first of ali the methodology of interpretation and cri-
tique oftcxts and traces, which is called HERMENEUTICS 
and which drew much renewed attention by figures in 
Gcrmany from Heinrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834) 
to Wilhelm Dilthey. This classical modern hermeneu-
tics has been adapted creatively into what became 
hermeneutica! phenomenology by Heidegger and oth-
ers; atternpts have also been madc by THOMAS M. 
SEEBOHM to disclose the transcendental phenornen-
ological grounds of hermeneutica! method and by 
RUDOLF MAKKREEL to clarify its transcendental reflec-
tive grounds. It is not clear, however, that the rneth-
ods for the interpretation of nonlinguistic data, which 
Dilthey called "rnonurnents," ha ve been appreciated as 
well as the herrneneutics of texts. Such nonlinguistic 
data are fundamental for archaeology and LESTER EM-
BREE has attempted to clarify how they are accessed 
pre-predicatively. 
In the social sciences, STRUCTURALISM is a prominent 
method that addresses the structures of cultural objects 
in language and in nonlinguistic representations such as 
pictures. These stern largely from Ferdinand de Saus-
sure ( 18 5 7-1913) and are extended by Roland Barthes 
(1915-1980), MICHEL FOUCAULT, Jacques Lacan ( 190 ]-
), and Claude Levi-Strauss. Although many concepts 
and rnost terminology are different and also some of 
the concerns, e.g., those with unconscious processes, it 
is not clear that semiotic and structuralist methods are 
substantially incornpatible with those of phenomen-
ology, but most of the work of showing overlaps and 
complementarities has yet to be done. 
The other mcthodological concern stemming from 
reflection on chiefly social science occurs in Schutz 
when he attempts to develop Weber 's method of ideal 
types phenomenologically. Schutz holds that the cul-
tural sciences differ from the natural in that the latter 
rely on primary constructs about natural objects that 
are not pre-interpreted, while the former are conversant 
with secondary constructs, which are constructs about 
the constructs in ordinary languagc and everyday life. 
In other words, he is emphatic that the subjective mean-
ing or insider interpretations of individuals and groups 
are what the constructs of outsiders, theoreticians and 
philosophers included, are about. 
Whether or not comrnonsense interpretation some-
how includes the pre-prcdicative constitution of val-
ues and uses for Schutz is not always clear. But where 
the idealizing construction of the models used in the 
cultural sciences for selves, others, actions, interac-
tions, relationships, motives, human products, and so-
cial groups are concerned, his contributions are enor-
mous and also do not seern incompatible with the re-
sults of methodological reflections on hermeneutica! 
and also structuralist and semiotic efforts. The over-
laps and complementarities have begun to be studied, 
e.g., by RICHARD LANIGAN. 
Whilc individual personal life is treated in the his-
torical and social sciences as at best derivative from 
comrnunallife in the socio-cultural world, psycholog-
ical human science begins with personal life and, as 
mentioned, works out from there to the rest of the 
world. Its methods include interpretation and other ap-
proaches taken toward personal documents and other 
representations, but it can most effectively rcly on self-
observation and reflection on others. In the latter ap-
proach, it does proceed on the basis of somatie indi-
cations such as gait, gesture, posture, intonation, and 
visage, and thus has a prominent place for the pheno-
meno1ogy ofthe BODY. 
Because of the need to know a good deal not only 
about the current states but also the histories of the 
actual practices of observation and theorizing in the 
wide variety ofhuman sciences- as well as, e.g., de-
partmental structures within the academy- there is a 
tendency among ali philosophers, and thus not merely 
phenomenologists, to emphasize either particular cul-
tural sciences, e.g., sociology, or species of cultural 
science, e.g., the social sciences, and not the human 
or cultural sciences in general. But social science is a 
species of human or cultural science just as physical 
science is a species rather than the genus of natural sci-

320 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ence. Phenomenological reflection on this entire family 
of sciences is as difficult as it is desirable. 
Once the multiplicity of cultural worlds as opposed 
to the allegedly one natural world are understood to 
be the common theme, the perspectives, thematized 
aspects, and methodologies of particular cultural sci-
ences and their species can be approached, as can the 
basic question of the difference between and relations 
of the human and natural sciences. Further questions 
concern how the knowledge gained in the theoretical 
human sciences is used in cultural disciplines of the 
axiotic and practica! sorts. Included in these further 
questions is the already mentioned question ofthe dif-
ferences between and relations of philosophy and the 
cultural sciences. 
Emerging issues for the human sciences and the 
phenomenological philosophy of them include ecol-
ogy, ethnicity, and gender. If there are major differ-
ences between masculine and feminine worldviews in 
ali societies, earlier observation and theory is distorted 
and needs to be corrected for gendered variations in 
experience, believing, valuing, and willing, since over 
half of humanity is female. Ethnic identities, groups, 
and conflicts may ha ve been suppressed and ignored in 
many nation states and empires in the past, but this is 
increasingly difficult to do, and like gender, ethnicity 
is a fundamental structure of human culturallife. And 
while the environment might be thought, naturalisti-
cally, to be nature in relation to organisms, it is diffi-
cult, upon reflection, not to consider plants, animals, 
and ecosystems as parts ofhuman cultural worlds, i.e., 
as cultural matters shaped by and including values and 
uses for humans. 
Finally, there is an interesting issue for the philos-
ophy of the natural sciences insofar as they are now 
deeply interested in science as a human activity and 
thus how its traditions and communities are amenable 
to historical and sociologica! and other particular forms 
ofhuman scientific investigation. How does the natural 
scientific world ofphysics relate to the cultural worlds 
out of which it arises? What is the impact of physics 
back upon the cultural world, not only with respect to 
the natural scientific technologies that it makes possi-
ble, but also with respect to the everyday values and 
uses of cultural objects? How different is natural sci-
ence from religion in these respects? 
Can the same questions not be asked about the ori-
gins and impacts of the cultural sciences, e.g., how 
everyday thinking in some communities has come to 
be affected by MARXIST politica[ theory or PSYCHOANAL-
YSJS? And, most philosophically, can RELATIVISM and 
thus skepticism be avoided once one begins to re-
flect on how objects and theories present themselves to 
and are dealt with by socio-historical groups and indi-
viduals, scientists and philosophers included? In other 
words, are non-trivial and non-relative truths, values, 
and purposes attainable or not?

HUNGARY 
The emergence ofHungarian phi-
losophy at the beginning ofthe 19th century was inftu-
enced by two factors. On the one hand, as citizens of 
the Habsburg Empire, Hungarian philosophers sought 
to define a national identity by opposing speculative 
philosophy of German origin and promoting the writ-
ing ofphilosophy in Hungarian. This tendency, similar 
to other national awakenings throughout Austrian- and 
German-ruled East Central Europe, was paralleled by 
another tendency that aimed to absorb the results of 
German philosophy, especially those of Kant and his 
followers. Before the revolution in 1848 and the war 
ofliberation against the Habsburgs in 1849, there were 
attempts to create what was called "national philoso-
phy," along with a Hungarian vocabulary ofphilosoph-
ical terminology. The stai led development of Hungar-
ian philosophy after 1849 cannot be reduced to the 
defeat of the Magyars in their 1849 war of liberation. 
The Hungarian philosophers had also proved unable 
to develop an adaptable. practicable philosophical vo-
cabulary, or to cultivate a lasting national tradition in 
philosophy. 
The an ti speculative tendency ofHungarian philoso-
phy through the first half ofthe 19th century is likewise 
expressed by the far greater interest and sympathy of 
Hungarian scholars for politica) and legal rather than 
philosophical ideas. In this context, one could mention 
Janos Erdelyi (18 14-1868), who saw this tendency 
as a national characteristic of the Hungarian people. 
The other key inftuence in Hungarian philosophy can 
be clearly measured in the first systematic philoso-
pher writing in Hungarian, Kăroly Bohm ( 1854-1911 ), 
whose work shows the inftuence, first of KANT and Kan-
tianism, then, in the third volume of his Az ember es 
vi/aga (Man and his world, 4 vols, 1883-1942), of a 
revised yet naive kind of Fichtean subjectivism. 
The inftuence of phenomenology in Hungary was 
preceded by a renaissance of philosophical culture at 
the end of the 19th century. This renaissance took the 
form of an authentic Neo-Kantianism, connected with 
the name ofBernăt Alexander ( 1850-1927). Alexander 
was a genuine thinker, yet his pedagogica! talents and 
broad knowledge of the history of phi1osophy proved 
even more important for Hungarian philosophy. As 
a professor at Budapest, he taught whole generations 
of young philosophers, many of whom made impor-
tant contributions to international philosophical life 
(Valeria Dienes, GYORGY LUKACS, Geza Revesz, VILMOS 
SZILASI, Arnold Hauser, Menyhert Palăgyi). 
Some of Alexander's students became connected to 
phenomenology. These were also familiar with the an-
alytic tradition in Austrian philosophy (Bolzano, I'RANZ 
BRENTANO, and the representatives of Brentanism). 
From the viewpoint of phenomenology, these students 
of Alexander and other thinkers in this period can be 
divided into two groups. The first includes philoso-
phers who explicitly considered themselves phenome-
nologists (.!ENO F.NYVV ARI, vilmos szilasi); the second 
includes significant thinkers strongly inftuenced by 
phenomenology in some sense (Bela Zalai, Baron 
Ă.kos von Pauler, Kăroly Mannheim, ANTAL scHOTz, 
Săndor Sîk). Another figure, though not a phenomen-
ologist, was Menyhert Palăgyi ( 1859-1929), who be-
came known through his attacks on EDMUND HUSSERL 's 
position in the Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901 ). 
In Der Streit der Psychologisten und Formalisten in 
der modernen Logik (The conflict of psychologizers 
and formalizers in modern logic, 1903), Palăgyi up-
holds Husserl 's rejection oflogical PSYCHOLOGISM, but 
criticizes his approach as too closely resembling a Kan-
tian logica] formalism. Palăgyi's views on the inte-
grated character of sensation likewise inftuenced the 
history ofphenomenology-see especially his Natur-
philosophische Vorlesungen (Lectures in nature phi-
losophy, 1924) and his Wahrnehmungslehre (Theory 
ofperception, 1924), which was welcomed and devel-
oped by MAX SCHELER. 
JENO ENYVV ARI studied at Budapest and Gottingen, 
and was connected first to the Bolzanian tradition, 
then to phenomenology. His understanding of pheno-
menology was based on Husserl's Logische Unter-
suchungen; for him, the main task of phenomen-
ology was a precise description and analysis of 
the structure of human consciousness, reducing im-
mediate consciousness data to their essential con-
tenis. In A phansikus (phaenomenologiai) adottsagok

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
/enyegismeretehez (On the knowledge of phansical 
[phenomenological] data, 1912) he distinguishes bc-
tween two kinds ofiNTENTIONALITY. The first is pheno-
menological intentionality, which concerns immedi-
ate experience (Erlebnisse). Enyvvary calls the other 
kind "entailing" (inhaesiv) intentionality, meaning by 
this a second-order intentiona] operation in which the 
first kind of intentionality is contained, and thus re-
calls Husserl 's concept of(imgierende Intentionalităt. 
That is, his entailing intentionality intends the first 
(phenomenological) intentionality. In his other works 
he also treated problems of abstraction (Ada/ek az 
ideatio phaenomeno/ogiajahoz, [On the Phenomen-
ology ofldeation, 191 1]) and the knowledge of general 
laws through investigation of immediate experiences 
(Egy phaenomeno/ogiai adottsagosztalyr6! [A class of 
phenomenological data, 1911 ]). Enyvvary also wrote 
a philosophical dictionary (Philosophiai sz6tar, 1923 ), 
with the explicit aim ofapplying the method ofpheno-
menology to the definition of philosophical terms. 
VILMOS (WILHELM) SZILASI studied in Budapest, and 
was invited to Freiburg by Husserl in 1919. His first 
work (A tudati rendszerezes elmeleterâl, [On the the-
ory of the systematization of consciousness, 1919]) 
shows the influence of BELA ZALAI, and through him 
of a Meinongian Gegenstandstheorie. In 1946, he suc-
ceeded MARTIN HEIDEGGER in the chair of phiJosophy 
at the University of Freiburg. Although most of his 
works are in philosophy of NATURAL SCIENCE, he is 
among the important figures in the history of pheno-
menology. This is due to his pedagogica! activity, his 
early writings, and above ali to his book Einfiihrung 
in die Phănomenologie Edmund Husserls (Introduc-
tion to Edmund Husserl 's phenomenology, 1959). This 
book is outstanding in severa] ways. First, Szilasi was 
among the few who resisted popular interpretations of 
Husserlian phenomenology, such as the reduction of 
Husserlian views to nea-Kantian philosophy. Second, 
he resisted over-emphasizing differences among the 
developmental phases of Husserlian phenomenology, 
pointing out the integral and systematic character of 
Husserl 's work from the Logische Untersuchungen to 
Die Krisis der europăischen Wissenschafien und die 
transzendentale Phănomenologie ( 1936). In Szilasi's 
view, Husserl's phenomenology is no "Bewusstsein-
sphi/osophie" (a kind of subjectivist philosophy of con-
sciousness) as opposed to, say, Heidegger's FUNDAMEN-
TAL ONTOLOGY, but rather a broad attempt to establish a 
universal typology of forms of knowledge and being, 
overcoming thereby the dichotomy between objectiv-
ity and subjectivity. 
Ofthe second group ofthe Hungarian philosophers 
influenced by phenomenology, BELA ZALAI was, besides 
the young Lukacs, the most important. Zalai was born 
to a Calvinist family in Debrecen, Hungary, and died 
in a concentration camp in Omsk during World War 1. 
As a young man, he belonged to the Sunday Circle 
of philosophers in Budapest, among whose members 
we find ARNOLD HAUSER, Karo]y Mannheim and GY()RGY 
LUKĂcs. Zalai was a disciple of Alexander in Budapest, 
then spent years in Paris and Leipzig, where he stud-
ied HENRI BERGSON, Wundt, and especially Meinong, 
through whom he interpreted Husserl 's Logische Un-
tersuchungen and phenomenology in general. 
Zalai 's ma in philosophical concern, which he called 
the problem of systematization, shows the influence of 
Meinong's theory. Yet he saw both Meinong's Gegen-
standstheorie and Husserl 's phenomenology as intro-
ductions to what he called a theory of systems. In his 
view, Husserl overcame psychologism in his Logische 
Untersuchungen; phenomenology was, however, sur-
passed by Meinong's theory of objects. To complete 
this process, he proposed his theory of systematiza-
tion. Zalai held that there is no single act or datum 
of knowledge. What is perceived or experienced as a 
single moment is only the result of what he termed 
"transformation": through transformation, it becomes 
possible to see a segment of reality as a separate or 
isolated entity, although any such entity is only a part 
of a given system of knowledge and experience. Such 
systems are bound together in overarching systems, 
which are based on an ultimate context of systems. 
The task of philosophy, in Zalai 's view, is the in-
vestigation of this ultimate context; he often calls 
this activity "metaphysics," rather than philosophy. 
He explained this notion in many of his writings ("A 
kozvetlen tapasztalas osszefi.igges-rendszere" [The 
system of immediate perception, 1906]; "A filoz6fiai 
rendszerezes problemaja," [The problem of philo-
sophical systematization, 1911 ]; "A realitasfogalom 
tipusair61" [The types ofthe concept ofreality, 1911]; 
ali published in: A rendszerek altalanos elmelete [A 
general theory of systems, 1984 ]), but especially in his 
main work Allgemeine Theorie der s_vsteme (General 

HUNGARY 
323 
theory of systems, 1914; published in German, 1982). 
By his theory of aesthetics, Lukacs hopes to over-
Husserl's inftuence on Zalai's work can be seen in 
many respects, among which Zalai 's understanding of 
intentionality deserves special attention. As he writes, 
in most lived experiences the intentiona! character (in 
its original, Brentanian sense) is only a framework of 
an inherent structure that is not in itself intentiona!. 
He calls this structure "logica!" and identifies it with 
the content or matter of an experience. In lived experi-
ence, the intentiona] character and the intentiona! con-
tent forma unity. Only by abstracting from this original 
unity-which one couldcall, with the word ofthe ]ater 
Husserl, "hyletic"- is it possible to identify the char-
acter of intentionality as directedness to an object. On 
the other hand, the hyletic content has its own pattern 
of behavior, which Zalai terms, as before, a process 
of systematization. The term "systematization," then, 
ftuctuates in Zalai 's works between designating, on the 
one hand, the original process of reality and, on the 
other, the process of philosophical activity, by which 
reality of any kind is conceptually systematized. 
In his earJy period, GYORGY (GEORG) LUKĂCS, was 
also deeply inftuenced by phenomenology. His Heidel-
berger Asthetik (published posthumously first in Hun-
garian in 1972, then in the original German in 1974) 
was written between 1912 and 1918 in Heidelberg, but 
remained incomplete, mainly because of World War 
1. The main theme of this work is the special char-
acter of works of art, a subject matter that was !ater 
developed and specified by ROMAN JNGARDEN as well. 
Lukacs's approach to AESTHETICS has the remarkable 
characteristics that he, untypically in his time, starts 
his analyses with the question of the ontologica] and 
epistemological possibility of particular works of art. 
As he writes at the very beginning ofhis investigations: 
"There are works of art- the question is how they are 
possible." In developing his insights, he distinguishes 
between what he calls "logica] phenomenology" on 
the one hand, and "aesthetical phenomenology," on 
the other. "Logica! phenomenology" for Lukacs co-
incides more or Jess with Husserl 's concept of logic 
as a theoretical science in Logische Untersuchungen; 
"phenomenological aesthetics," on the other hand, is 
characteristically different from the former inasmuch 
as it is based, in a special sense, on psychology. As he 
writes, aesthetic phenomenology is a theory of forms 
of aesthetic experience. 
come any description of aesthetic experience that is 
grounded on the correlation between aesthetic expres-
sion and reception and concentrates exclusively on the 
very field of aesthetic forms. The three ma in forms in 
aesthetic experience are that of the artist (the o ne who 
produces particular works of art) on the o ne hand, that 
of the recipient (the one who sees, hears, etc., a given 
work of art) on the other hand, and, finally, that of the 
work of art itself. Each of these forms can be investi-
gated by applying a kind ofphenomenologicalmethod. 
Phenomenologicalmethod, however, is understood by 
Lukacs as a kind of formal analysis of particular expe-
riences- which, as he expressly states, cannot lead us 
to a complete grasp ofthe very meaning of a particular 
work ofart. Phenomenology is only an introduction to 
such a grasp of meaning, which can be completed by 
carrying out a kind of nonrational act of knowledge 
or "jump" (he refers in this context to Kierkegaard's 
famous definition of the act of faith). Lukacs presents 
an interesting, although not completely original, typol-
ogy of the person of the artist, according to which we 
can distinguish between the dilettante (the one who 
cannot organize his or her aesthetic experiences into 
a meaningful whole), the virtuoso (the one who per-
fectly knows the formal requirements of works of art, 
but lacks appropriate aesthetic experience ), and finally, 
the genius (who not only has aesthetical experiences, 
but also knows how to unite them into an aesthetically 
organic whole). 
Further on in his work, Lukacs investigates the his-
torical aspects of the work of art, and concludes that 
the eterna! meaning that we seem to recognize in ex-
periencing great works of art cannot be properly un-
derstood except on the basis of a formal analysis of 
the historical-cultural process of their production. At 
this point, even his understanding ofthe term "pheno-
menology" undergoes remarkable changes; while the 
Husserlian inftuence in his understanding of the term 
was obvious earlier, in the !ater chapters ofhis work he 
stresses more and more that the meaning of the term 
stands closer to a Hegelian kind of phenomenology. 
Although he believes that Husserlian and Hegelian 
phenomenology share common features, he seems to 
think at the same time that the main objective of 
Husserlian phenomenology was "to secure pure ob-
jectivity, and to bracket any subjectivity." This shows, 

324 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
however, that his understanding of phenomenology 
was from the very beginning weak methodologically 
and that, at the time of his Heidelberger Ăsthetik, he 
was not familiar with the ma in works ofHusserl 's tran-
scendental period. His understanding ofthe problem of 
the work of art, on the other hand, was a unique attempt 
in his time to create an encompassing phenomenologi-
cal aesthetics. 
Lukacs left Hungary in 1919, and gradually be-
came associated with MARXISM. His attitude concerning 
phenomenology in his !ater years was dominated by his 
then new philosophical and politica! orientation. This 
explains why he criticizes Husserl and phenomenology 
so sharply in severa! passages of A pol gari .filozofia 
valsaga (The crisis of bourgeois philosophy), which 
was published in 1949 after his return to Hungary. 
The influence of phenomenology in Hungary was 
fairly strong between the two world wars, yet neither 
Husserl nor any other phenomenologist had any com-
mitted followers other than Szilasi. In his early writ-
ings, however, Karoly (Karl) Mannheim (1893-1947) 
clearly shows the influence of Husserl. In his 1918 
work ("Az ismeretelmelet szerkezeti elemzese" [Struc-
tural analysis of epistemology]) he explicitly refers to 
Husserl, using the term EPOCHE in the Husserlian sense; 
his view ofthe correlation between subject and object 
as the central question of philosophy again betrays 
Husserlian influence. 
ANTAL SCHUTZ, ĂKOS VON PAULER, and SĂNDOR SlK 
were familiar with phenomenology and applied some 
of its results. Schiitz, the leading figure of neo-
Scholasticism in Hungary, spent some time in the in-
stitute of Oswald Kiilpe ( 1862-1915) in Wiirzburg. He 
understood Husserl's phenomenology as a new devel-
opment on Bolzano's philosophy of the facts of con-
sciousness. He applied, too, a wider understanding of 
the phenomenological method, inasmuch as he saw it 
as a necessary methodological precondition for philos-
ophy. For him, the phenomenological method enables 
us to reach an unbiased view ofthe objects of everyday 
experience (A bOlcselet elemei [Elements of philoso-
phy, 1940]). 
ĂKOS voN PAULER, the most important philosopher 
in Hungary during the first half of the 20th century, 
was strongly influenced by FRANZ BRENTANO, besides 
having personal contact with him during the early 
1900s. In his Az etikai megismen?s termeszete (The na-
ture of moral knowledge, 1907) he reflects the central 
notions of Brentano's Ursprung sittlicher Erkenntnis 
(The origin of ethical knowledge, 1895). Pauler, too, 
saw Husserl as the heir ofBolzanian philosophy. In his 
systematic work (Bevezetes afiloz6fiaba [Introduction 
to philosophy, 1920; German edition: Grundlagen der 
Philosophie, 1925]) he identifies the resul! ofthe vari-
ous phenomenological reductions with his own concept 
of"logical essences" (logismata) and praises Husserl 
for his notion of the epoche. As he writes, "Husserl 's 
most original insight was the necessity of a pheno-
menological attitude, as opposed to the natural atti-
tude." Pauler compared Husserl 's notion of intuitively 
grasped essences to the Platonic ideas, and argued that 
even Plotinus, in attempting to view the things of the 
natural world as they are in themselves, was applying 
a phenomenological method. It seems, however, that 
Pauler did not appropriately understand the Husserlian 
difference between eidetic and transcendental epoches 
and reductions. 
SĂNDOR sfK also considered the method of unpreju-
diced description of the world of everyday experience 
the main merit ofphenomenology. In his three-volume 
Esztetika (Aesthetics, 1942), he shows himself to be 
a follower of Husserl in that he emphasizes the im-
portance of EIDETIC METHOD. In particular, however, he 
seems to be deeply influenced by MORITZ GEIGER. By 
applying the phenomenological method in the context 
of his neo-Scholastic conceptions (he himself was a 
Catholic priest) his work becomes close to the attempts 
ofREALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY. His main concern, how-
ever, remains the hermeneutica! relation between sub-
ject and object in aesthetic experience. 
During the early 1960s some disciples of Lukacs 
started to investigate phenomenology within the his-
tory of philosophy. In fact, this historical approach 
to the problems of phenomenology became dominant 
from the early 1960s until the late 1980s. Among the 
products of this period, one must mention GYORGY 
MIHĂLY VAJDA 's two works on Husserlian phenomen-
ology (Zar6jelbe tett tudomany [Science in parenthe-
ses, 1968], and Mitosz es raci6 hataran [Between 
myth and reason, 1969]), LĂSZL6 ĂRON's monograph 
on Husserl ( 1982); and articles by JĂNOS KRIST6F NYfRI 
and ISTVĂN M. FEHER. 
During the late 1960s, Hungarian phenomenology 
developed a special orientation toward phenomen-

HUNGARY 
325 
ology of LITERATURE. following ROMAN INGARDEN and 
EMIL sTAIGER, Vajda considered and applied phenomen-
ological elements in his critica! works on the history of 
literature ("Fenomeno16giai szemlelet az irodalomtu-
domanyban es az irodalomban" [A phenomenological 
approach to literary theories and to literature, 1968]). 
The collapse ofthe Soviet system in Hungary again 
brought the end of one cultural period and the begin-
ning of another. This applies to philosophy as well, 
although it is not possible to make any sharp de-
marcation. The tendencies that have become visible 
since 1989 were latently present earlier, the scholars 
and philosophers who started work in phenomenology 
since 1989 having worked philosophically under the 
previous regime as well. 
Yet in all this a general change of interest can be 
clearly recognized. Whereas unti1 the early 1980s, Ger-
man philosophical traditions (Austrian traditions, Ger-
man idealism, HEGEL, and MARXISM) determined philo-
sophical orientation in Hungary, from the early 1980s 
philosophy from FRANCE has become more and more 
dominant. In reading present-day Hungarian philo-
sophical publications, one easily notes how many arti-
cles concern French philosophers such as JACQUES DER-
RIDA, MicheJ foucauJt, and JEAN-FRAN<;:OIS LYOTARD, but 
aJso EMMANUEL LEVINAS and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY. 
Readers are eager to learn more about relatively minor 
philosophical traditions; thus JAN PATOCKA or Emil M. 
Cioran are read more extensively. Phenomenological 
investigations are concentrated especially on the work 
of Husserl, Levinas, Heidegger, HANS-GEORG GADAMER, 
and PAUL RIC<EUR. There is, however, a tendency to re-
turn to the origins of Husserlian thought, and to the 
Austrian traditions in Hungarian philosophy. The in-
fluence of German philosophy seems to be weaken-
ing; at the same time, a strong interest in present-day 
English-speaking philosophy has grown in works by 
Janos Krist6fNyiri, Lajos T6th, and BALĂzs M. MEZEI. 
Perhaps the most influential young Hungarian 
philosopher of strong phenomenological interests is 
LĂSZLO TENGELYI. Although he published his first book 
on Kant ( 1988), his second work is a historical-
systematic analysis of the concept and interpretation 
of guilt in post-Cartesian history of philosophy (A 
bun mint sorsesemeny [Guilt as experience of destiny, 
1993]). Tengelyi's efforts are focused first on applying 
the phenomenological method throughout the history 
of a philosophical problem and second on ground-
ing philosophy in ethical principles. Ethical princi-
ples are established by a kind of phenomenological 
method, in which HERMENEUTICS and phenomenology 
prove complementary points of view. Tengelyi is also 
one ofthe leading figures in a group ofyoung philoso-
phers who investigate the questions ofphenomenology, 
hermeneutics, phenomenology ofreligion, and pheno-
menological ETHICS. In this ci rele, REALISTIC PHENOMEN-
OLOGY is also represented. 
It is also noteworthy how phenomenology, both in 
historical and systematic phenomenological studies, is 
emphatically present in the growing variety of philo-
sophical periodicals and publications in Hungary. The 
most significant periodica! is Magyar Filoz6fiai Szemle 
edited by the Association of Hungarian Philosophers. 
Gond, edited by Mihaly Vajda, but also Bela Bacs6's 
Athaeneum and Gabor Ferge's Existentia must be men-
tioned. In Ferge's periodica!, some materials are pub-
lished in German and English. In these periodicals, as 
in others, one finds vi vid discussion of the problems 
of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and philosophical 
methodology in general ( e.g., Balazs M. Mezei: "Guilt, 
Destiny and Job's Cartesianism," Budapest Review of 
Books, 1993). The rising interest in phenomenology in 
Hungary points to similar tendencies that can be seen 
in the CZECHOSLOVAKIA and in RUSSIA and the former 
UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS. Phenomenology 
appears in these countries, not as one movement among 
others in the history of philosophy, but as a unique 
opportunity to rediscover, after years of politica! and 
ideologica! oppression, an authentic and creative way 
of doing philosophy.

EDMUND HUSSERL 
BALÂZS M. MEZEI 
ELTE University Budapest 
The founder of the 
"phenomenological movement" was born in Prossnitz, 
Moravia- then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 
and now Prostejow, Czech Republic -
on April 8, 
1859. The Husserl family had been dornici led for many 
generations in this area -
the name itself seems de-
rived from the Czech huiscka, which means "gosling." 
Although Husserl's house of birth was located in the 
Jewish area of the town, his family was part of the as-
similation that occurred after the revolution of March 
1848, when Jews gained full rights as citizens and be-
came more integrated into communal and commercial 
life. Husserl 's father opened a textile business in the 
center oftown in 1860 and Edmund attended the public 
primary school in Prossnitz. 
From these rather humble origins, Husserl went 
on to the German Gymnasium in Olmiitz (Oiomouc, 
Czech Republic). He began his university studies at 
Leipzig, where from 1876 to 1878 he studied primarily 
astronomy with some interest in mathematics, physics, 
and philosophy. It was during this period that he be-
came acquainted with Tomas Masaryk (1850--1937), 
who later became the first president ofCzechoslovakia. 
With hindsight, it can be said that Masaryk played a 
substantial ro le in Husserl 's development, as he in-
spired Husserl to study Descartes and Leibniz as well as 
BRITISH EMPIRICISM. Furthermore, Masaryk introduced 
his compatriot to the work of FRANZ BRENTANO, which 
would be ofpivotal importance in Husserl 's intellectual 
life. 
Beginning with the summer semester of 1878, 
Husserl continued his studies in Berlin, where he fo-
cused upon mathematics under the tutelage of Karl 
Weierstrass ( 1815-1897). He completed his mathemat-
ical training in Vienna from 1881 to 1882, where his 
dissertation, Beitrăge zur Theorie der Variationsrech-
nung (Contributions to the theory of variation calcu-
lus), was accepted on October 8, 1892, and he was 
promoted to Ph.D. on January 23, 1883. 
Following a brief return to Berlin to work with 
Weierstrass, Husserl engaged in philosophical stud-
ies with Franz Brentano in Vienna from 1884 to 1886. 
Following Brentano 's recommendation, he studied fur-
ther in Halle an der Salle with Cari Stumpf ( 1849-
1936), a former student ofBrentano, and submitted his 
Habilitationsschrift in Halle in 1887. The tit le of this 
work -
"Uber den Begriff der Zahl. Psychologische 
Analysen" (On the concept of number. Psychologi-
cal analyses) is indicative of Husserl 's sh i ft towards 
a philosophical analysis of the methods and unproven 
presuppositions of MATHEMATICS. Husserl then began 
his academic career as Privatdozent at Halle, where he 
remained until 1901. 
Husserl's first major publication from the period in 
Halle was the Philosophie der Arithmetik of 1891 (the 
first four chapters of which contain, with only minor 
changes, the text ofhis Habilitationsschrift). One sees 
in this work both the marks of his early training and 
the themes that would characterize his )ater philosophy. 
Certainly the influences of Weierstrass and Brentano 
are apparent. Husserl would admit )ater that the desire 
of Weierstrass for a radical grounding of mathemati-
cal analysis by the mathematician through a rigorous 
development of the real number system set the tone 
for his own scientific work. Such a desire for abso-
lute and solid foundations is evident in ali of Husserl 's 
work, and certainly the model provided by the debate 
about foundations in mathematics is never far from 
Husserl 's mind. However, while Weierstrass saw the

laying of such foundations as a task of mathematics 
itself, Husserl takes such "foundation work" to be a 
properly philosophical task. 
Indeed, Husserl's early focus on the question of 
foundation in mathematics can be understood in two 
ways: first as an interest in establishing for mathemat-
ics a solid foundation; second as an interest in the way 
in which such a well-founded mathematics can then 
function as a foundation for other sciences. This ap-
proach corresponds exactly to what Husserl eventually 
would seek for philosophy itself-that is, a desire that 
philosophy be well founded, and consequently that it be 
the solid foundation for ali the sciences. In this broader 
conception of all-encompassing philosophical investi-
galion, Brentano's influence can be seen. Thus Husserl 
inherited not only a set of problems, but also the ethic 
of intellectuallife as a constant labor to achieve greater 
clarity not only about the objects of one's reflection, 
but also about the subjective motives and conditions 
of such reflection. Looking back on this early period, 
Husserl would say that "through philosophical work, 
I resolved to renounce ali great goals and to be happy 
when I could achieve here and there the smallest firm 
ground within the swamps ofunclarity lacking ali foun-
dation." 
Though Husserl did indeed labor intensely at Halie 
under less than ideal conditions, it was not un tii the turn 
ofthe century that another major publication emerged: 
the two volumes of the Logische Untersuchungen in 
1900-1901 (English translation 1970; also translated 
into Russian [ 1909], French, Spanish, Italian, Por-
tugese, Japanese, and Chinese). As implied above, ali 
ofHusserl's philosophical endeavors were determined 
by the problem ofthe connection between subjectivity 
and objectivity, and in his two early works ofthe Halie 
period this problem is discussed in the context of objec-
tivity within the spheres ofmathematics and LOGIC and 
its relationship to the subjective accomplishments of 
counting, judging, and forming conclusions. The Un-
tersuchungen can be seen as mapping out a twofold ap-
proach to the problem. First, there is a sharp refutation 
( especially in the first volume, Prolegomena zur reinen 
Logik [Prolegomena to pure logic]) of PSYCHOLOGISM, 
that is, the confusing of logica! laws with either psy-
chological laws or psychological acts -
a confusion 
evident in rnuch of the reflection on logic during this 
period. Second, there is a careful analysis ofiNTENTION-
ALITY as the definitive feature of consciousness. Here 
again, the shadow of Brentano is seen. The volurnes 
ofthe Logische Untersuchungen slowly gained recog-
nition for Husserl weli beyond Halie and Gottingen, 
where he was appointed Professor Extraordinarius of 
philosophy in 1901. 
The nurnber of substantial writings published by 
Husserl during his lifetirne is relatively smali when 
cornpared to the large quantity of rnanuscripts found 
by HERMAN LEO VAN BREDA on his first visit to Freiburg 
shortly after Husserl's death. Part of the reason for 
this is that Husserl literally "thought" through his 
pen, and his enorrnous self-discipline and ethic of at-
ternpting to describe the "phenornena" in their min-
utest details cornbined to produce a huge number of 
manuscripts, largely written in Gabelsberger stenog-
raphy. The period in Gottingen is no exception to this 
aspect ofHusserl 's philosophicallife, with the only ma-
jor publication appearing in 1913: ldeen zu ei ner reinen 
Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen Philoso-
phie, Erstes Buch (first English translation 1931, sec-
ond 1982; also translated into French, Spanish, Italian, 
Portuguese, and Japanese ). Despite this paucity ofpub-
lication, Husserl 's thought exerted influence during this 
period through his teaching and other avenues. For ex-
arnple, in 1902 JOHANNES DAUBERT, a student ofTheodor 
Lipps (1851-1914 ), visited Husserl in Gottingen and 
!ater introduced the Untersuchungen to other students 
ofLipps in Munich such as ALEXANDER PFĂNDER, MORITZ 
GEIGER, and ADOLF REINACH. In the subsequent years, 
contact with these "Munich phenomenologists" also 
influenced Husserl 's own developrnent. From 1905 on-
ward, severa! students carne frorn Munich to study 
with Husserl, and together with others formed the 
"Gottingen Philosophical Society," whose rnembers in-
cluded THEODOR CONRAD, HEDWIG CONRAD-MARTIUS, DI-
ETRICH VON HILDEBRAND, ALEXANDRE KOYRE, and EDITH 
STEIN. Many ofthe figures frorn this Gottingen period 
contributed to the formation of what has come to be 
called REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY. 
Perhaps due to the lack ofpublication in this period, 
the first book of the Ideen carne as a surprise to some 
early adherents of Husserl. It was viewed by some as 
a movement away frorn an ontologicaliy neutra! po-
sition to a more "idealistic" view of the intentiona! 
life of consciousness. For Husserl, though, the thirteen 
years since the Logische Untersuchungen had brought 

328 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
a clearer conception of the methodological hasis of 
his philosophical struggle to clarify the connection be-
tween subjectivity and objectivity. An important part 
ofthis new publication developed the notion ofEPOCHE 
AND REDUCTION. Central to this methodological inno-
vation (already mentioned in lectures in 1906-D7) is 
the "bracketing out" or "placing in parentheses" of 
the uncritical belief in the existence of the world in 
order to lay open the structures of transcendental con-
sciousness. Only through such a "pure" description 
of the ultimate constituting nature of consciousness 
could the naive NATURALISM that Husserl saw present 
in both ordinary life and the scientific inquiry of his 
day be overcome and a proper point of departure be 
established for the solution ofphilosophical problems. 
Hence the move from the Logische Untersuchungen to 
Jdeen 1 could be described as a shift from a descriptive 
to a CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY. No doubt, it was 
expressions such as the hypothesis of an "annihilation 
of the world" in the latter work that led many readers 
to see in this shift an idealistic motif. Important to the 
account of consciousness given in Ideen 1 is the in-
troduction ofthe term NOEMA to denote the intentiona! 
abject. 
The establishment by Husserl during his Gottingen 
years of the Jahrbuch fur Philosophie und phăno­
menologische Forschung (Yearbook for Philosophy 
and Phenomenological Research) gave the growing 
phenomenological movement an effective instrument 
through which it could speak. Until the cessation of 
publication in 1930, the Jahrbuch presented a great 
number of important phenomenological investigations. 
For example, the inaugural article was Husserl's own 
Ideen !, and other significant texts included MAX 
SCHELER's Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die ma-
teriale Wertethik (Formalism in ethics and nonformal 
ethics of value ), which was published in two parts in 
1913 and 1916, and MARTIN HEIDEGGER's Sein und Zeit 
of1927. 
In 1916 Husserl was appointed the successor to 
Heinrich Rickert ( 1863-1936) as holder of"Lehrstuhl 
1" within the philosophical faculty of the university at 
Freiburg im Breisgau. In the same year, his youngest 
son, Wolfgang, was killed at the Battle ofVerdun while 
serving as a volunteer in the German army. Husserl held 
his own nationalistic leanings (though less extreme 
than those belonging to some of his colleagues and 
students), and some traces of these sentiments might 
even be seen in his lectures on FICHTE in 1917. Nev-
ertheless, the terrible tragedy of World War I can be 
viewed as marking a shift in Husserl 's thought (for ex-
ample, there is development in Husserl's ETHICS). As 
pivotal as the war and its aftermath and the subse-
quent rise of National Socialism is for understanding 
the development of Husserl 's thought, it is crucial to 
note that for him these events were signs of some-
thing fundamentally amiss in European civilization, of 
a sickness whose roots went far deeper than the imme-
diate circumstances of these terrible events. Writing 
in 1923 of the "politica!, national, religious, artistic, 
and philosophical chaos" in Germany, Husserl was not 
only describing Weimar Germany, nor was he simply 
expressing his belief that the war, in a certain sense, 
had continued past 1918, "to be waged with psycho-
logical torture, moral deprivation, andeconomic need." 
Rather, the tragedy of the times is taken as an indica-
tion that Europe had lost sight ofits own rational te/os, 
ofthe project that Husserl takes in his !ater thought to 
be the very definition ofthe idea of"Europe": a belief 
in the possibility of a fully rational existence and in the 
ability ofhuman beings to justify and have insight into 
what they do and why they do it. 
Given this view that his age had succumbed to nar-
row and inadequate forms ofrationality that ultimately 
showed their bankruptcy, it remains to Husserl 's credit 
that he did not yield to the superficial pessimism or 
irrationalism that repeats itself in every age, nor did he 
simply pronounce solutions. Rather, in what amounts to 
a form of optimism in reason itself, he conducted ongo-
ing phenomenological investigations across a myriad 
of areas in order to uncover the primordial roots of the 
contemporary malaise, and remedy it through a proper 
grounding of reason itself. Husserl 's !ater thought can 
be seen, then, as an extension of his basic aim to exe-
cute a phenomenology of REASON in ali its expressions. 
What became more evident to Husserl is that descrip-
tion ofthe intentiona! structures of consciousness (the 
task of static phenomenology) must be accompanied 
by an account of how such structures develop -
in 
short, a phenomenological description of the genesis 
of meaningful intentiona! acts. Hence there emerges 
in Husserl 's ]ater work a GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY that 
is able not only to encompass the description of the 
constitutive origin of the world in transcendental sub-

EDMUND HUSSERL 
329 
jectivity, but also to give an account of the subject's 
relation to other subjects and an historicallifeworld. 
Throughout the 1920s Husserl struggled to sum-
marize the results of his phenomenological investiga-
tions into a systematic work. The closest this project 
carne to fruition was in the Cartesianische Meditatio-
nen, published in French in 1931. Nevertheless, the 
themes covered in the manuscripts and in university 
and other lectures (such as those in London in 1922, 
Amsterdam in 1928, and Paris in 1929) yield a clear 
view of Husserl's broad interests and give the sense 
of a systematic work. In the University lecture courses 
of 1923-24 one finds the extension of transcenden-
tal phenomenology as foundational science, as Erste 
Philosophie, and in other lectures the relationship be-
tween transcendental phenomenology and PSYCHOLOGY 
is explored. The study of intentiona\ PHILOSOPHICAL 
ANTHROPOLOGY and wor\d-apperception, INTERSUBJEC-
TIVE constitution, and prob1ems of TIME and individu-
ation are the concerns of many manuscripts. In 1929 
Husserl published the Formale und transzendentale 
Logik where he once again draws upon the themes of 
the Logische Untersuchungen, although now on the 
basis ofhis fully developed phenomenology. 
Especially important for Husserl 's postwar work 
were his private assistants: EDITH STEIN, LUDWIG LAND-
GREBE, and EUGEN FINK. They had the tasks ofmanaging 
the ever-increasing number of manuscripts, transcrib-
ing Husserl 's stenography, and preparing texts for pub-
lication. Out ofthis form of collaboration, only one text 
carne to publication during Husserl's Phănomenologie 
des inneren Zeitbewusstseins (On the phenomenology 
ofinternal time-consciousness) in 1928. This work was 
prepared by Edith Stein and edited by MARTIN HEIDEG-
GER, a1though, given the extensive work by Stein, it is, 
with certain reservations that this work can be consid-
ered an authentic text of Husserl. The same can be said 
of a text edited and revised by Landgrebe that appeared 
in 1939 entitled Erfahrung und Urteil (Experience and 
judgment). 
The relationship between HUSSERL and HEIDEGGER 
was also of great significance. Husserl placed great 
hope in Heidegger as the person to assume the leader-
ship of the phenomenological movement. In 1927-28 
there was collaboration with Heidegger on an article 
defining phenomenology for the Encyclopaedia Bri-
tannica. As Husserl entered officially into the status 
of professor emeritus at Freiburg in March 1928, it 
was Heidegger whom Husserl promoted as his succes-
sor. However, as became apparent to Husserl through 
subsequent careful reading of Heidegger's Sein und 
Zeit (1927), Heidegger's thought had gone in other di-
rections. In 1931, Husserl 's lecture "Phanomenologie 
und Anthropologie" delivered in Frankfurt, Halle, and 
Berlin, was clearly critica! of Heidegger for what 
Husserl took to be a betrayal of the principles of 
transcendental phenomenology. In addition to Heideg-
ger, two other assistants of the Philosophical Sem-
inar who worked with Husserl were osKAR BECKER 
and ARNOLD METZGER. It should be added that even 
an incomplete list of students from this period in-
dicates the depth and widespread nature of the in-
terests in Husserl 's phenomenology. Among those 
who worked with him were: FRITZ KAUFMANN, AL-
FRED SCHUTZ, ARON GURWITSCH, HANS-GEORG GADAMER, 
KARL U)WITH, HERBERT SPIEGELBERG, EMMANUEL LEVINAS, 
PAUL-LOUIS LANDSBERG, RudoJf Camap (1891-1970), 
and Herbert Marcuse ( 1898-1979), along with the 
Americans DORION CAIRNS and MARVIN FARBER and the 
Japanese SHUZO KUKI and HAJIME TANABE. 
The last years ofHusserl's life brought severe hard-
ship due to the seizure of power by the National So-
cialists in January 1933. His status as emeritus was 
suspended by the National Socialists on April 6, 1933 
(though he was reinstated on Ju1y 20, as the first set of 
race laws in Germany did allow for "non-Aryans" ap-
pointed to academic positions before August 1, 1914, 
to maintain their positions). Following the enactment 
of the Niimberg race laws of 1935, Husserl was fully 
excluded from academic 1ife and also had to vacate 
his home of over twenty years. Nevertheless, even in 
these dire circumstances Husserl 's philosophical inves-
tigations continued. He dialogued with many visitors 
such as GASTON BERGER and JAN PATOCKA. Jnvited Jec-
tures in Vienna and Prague in 1935 are the basis for 
the publication in 1936 of Parts 1 and II of Die Kri-
sis der europăischen Wissenschqften und die transzen-
dentale Phănomenologie in the Belgrade periodica! 
Philosophia. This poignant text struck some followers 
as embarking in new directions. An emphasis on HIS-
TORY, and a thematic focus on the concrete LIFEWORLD, 
yield the sense of a turn toward both a HERMENEUTICAL 
and an EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY. AJthough there 
are various approaches employed by Husserl in his 

330 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
work, its ultimate aim remains to the end an attempt at 
the foundational renovation ofphilosophy as a rigorous 
science. It was Husserl's conviction that only through 
a radical uncovering and verification of subjectivity by 
phenomenology would the danger of a one-sided ob-
jectivism and the opposing threats of skepticism and 
RELATIVISM be overcome. 
Reftecting back from the standpoint of the Krisis 
text, it is evident that Husserl's !ater thought does not 
make a radical break with the earlier. Already in the es-
say "Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft" published 
in the journal Logos in 1911 it is no longer a question 
of addressing a crisis in the foundation of a particu-
lar field such as mathematics (as one could interpret 
the Philosophie der Arithmetik), nor taking to task the 
inadequacy of reftection upon the forms of thought in 
general (LOGIC). Rather, the entire range of both the 
NATURAL and HUMAN SCIENCES is seen to suffer from 
prejudices of NATURALISM, positivism, psychologism, 
and historicism. These crises ari se due to the lack of a 
clear comprehension within particular sciences oftheir 
own task, origin, and foundation- in short, a lack of 
self-comprehension. However, at the same time that 
Husserl recognizes with growing clarity the crises in 
the various sciences and the need for a philosophical 
foundation for the sciences, he also perceives more 
clearly the impotence of the existing philosophy. Phi-
losophy is itself not in a position to provide what is 
needed "because it is not yet a science at ali." Husserl 
thus sees the first task of philosophy as being essen-
tially one of establishing itself as a rigorous science. 
It is also already apparent in "Philosophie als strenge 
Wissenschaft" that Husserl views these difficulties in 
the sciences and in philosophy to have far-reaching 
cultural ramifications. According to Husserl, culture in 
the West is based on science, and an insecure science 
results in an insecure culture. Hence the caii for phi-
losophy as a rigorous science is a caii to shore up the 
foundations of a eul ture. The themes of a crisis in eul-
ture and the relationship of philosophy to the pressing 
needs of modern life take on even deeper significance 
in the five essays on "Erneuerung" or "renewal" writ-
ten in 1922-23 for the Japanese journal Kaizo. Husserl 
calls for a renewal or rehabilitation of the European 
spirit based on renewed philosophy, and indeed, seeks 
a rehabilitation of the world based on a renewed Eu-
rope. The fundamental crisis is described as a loss of 
faith in REASON and renewal is the reestablishment or 
rekindling of faith in reason. 
The faith that was lost has sustained Europe since 
its "foundation" or origin, that is, since the Greeks. 
This faith not only proclaims the possibility of rational 
existence, but also that such an existence comprises a 
goal for authentic humanity, that in order for human 
life to be truly human, it must be rational. The belief 
that authentic human life is a rationallife is a beliefthat 
this life must be imbued with a sense of critique, and 
a desire to see for oneself, to accept nothing simply on 
the basis ofthe tradition, tobe willing to examine one-
self and one's actions. Rationality in its proper sense 
also implies an attitude that is not dominated by im-
mediate, pressing concerns. It is not interested solely 
in functioning, but in truly comprehending and know-
ing why the world and its inhabitants function as they 
do. The rationality of this critical-theoretical attitude 
should not be confused with the impoverished sense of 
rationality put forth by positivists and their equation of 
rationality with empirica! facts. lndeed, facts viewed 
merely as empirica! represent a certain "irrationality" 
for Husserl. Only a fu li sense of rationality concerned 
with universal, omnitemporal ideas is capable of re-
newing Europe and bringing it to a realization of the 
meaning of its own existence. 
The types of crises described by Husserl with such 
conviction in the Krisis parallel the form of the crises 
in mathematics and logic outlined in his earliest work. 
Functioning without insight into what one is doing, 
working with forms ofthought that are accepted with-
out question, lacking awareness of where these forms 
of thought come from -
these are some of the dom-
inant features of the eri sis of science, philosophy, and 
culture. In a text written in 1936 and !ater published 
by Fink under the title "Die Frage nach dem Ursprung 
der Geometrie als intentional-historisches Problem," 
Husserl gives an account of LANGUAGE that shows 
clearly that such crises do not prevent mere function-
ing. But a functioning wherein the meaning oflanguage 
is lost, and wherein one can speak and write words 
without really knowing what one is saying or writing, 
is similar to the loss of meaning that occurs in a sci-
ence that continues to function well as a "technique," 
but does not understand itself, its origin, or its goal. 
The struggle for a culture to have insight into 
itself and ali its activities parallels the struggle of 

EDMUND HUSSERL 
331 
the individual philosopher to be truly "answerable" 
for his or her own thought and action. Hence the 
fullest description of authentic human life for Husserl 
is self-responsibility, and the ultimate characteriza-
tion of Husserl's philosophy is one of absolute self-
responsibility. Tobe fully human is to know what you 
are doing and why you are doing it, and hence to be 
truly responsible for who you are. The struggle for 
such responsibility and the attempt to be accountable 
for who one is and what one does is no easy task. Yet 
for Husserl it is this struggle alone that provides the 
meaning ofboth personal and communal existence. 
Husserl 's ethos as well as his accomplishments go 
far toward explaining the growth and spread of the 
phenomenological movement across the planet. As he 
approached his death in Freiburg on April27, 1938, he 
feltjustified in claiming that his life had been true to the 
philosophical struggle for self-responsibility. Shortly 
thereafter, HERMANN LEO VAN BREDA managed to res-
cue over 40,000 pages of manuscripts from Freiburg 
and bring them to safety within the Institute of Phi-
losophy of the Catholic University in Leuven, Bel-
gium. Van Breda also managed to remove Husserl 's 
large philosophicallibrary containing 2,817 books and 
1, 152 offprints, as well as correspondence and further 
documentation concerning Husserl's life and career. 
Already in the autumn of 1938 one can speak of the 
founding ofthe Husserl Archives, as Van Breda man-
aged to hire Husserl 's last assistants Landgrebe and 
Fink. Before Husserl's death, Fink had begun to orga-
nize Husserl 's manuscripts, and this work on Husserl 's 
Nachlass continued in Leuven along with the transcrib-
ing ofthe manuscripts from Gabelsberger stenography. 
These transcriptions could then be studied by visiting 
scholars, as was already the case for MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY during his first visit to Leuven in 1939. The 
work of actually editing these manuscripts for publi-
cation could only begin in earnest after World War II 
and since that time over thirty volumes ha ve appeared 
in the Husserliana series -
the collected works of 
Edmund Husserl. The Archives continues the work to-
day of transcribing, editing, and publishing Husserl's 
works, as well as conducting research into the nature 
of Husserl's thought and its relationship to key devel-
opments in philosophy.

HUSSERL AND HEIDEGGER 
R. PHILIP BUCKLEY 
McGil/ University 
Despite a wealth 
of literature on this many-sided subject, a definitive 
appraisal of this relationship -
personal as well as 
philosophical and professional- at the very heart of 
the phenomenological movement remains to be writ-
ten. HERBERT SPIEGELBERG's reJiabJe initial account ad-
mittedJy falls short because of lack of factual infor-
mation on the development of the relationship. With 
the recent emergence of a wealth of documents from 
the archives, a thoroughgoing account of this close 
philosophical collaboration gone awry, during a period 
when neither EDMUND HUSSERL nor MARTIN HEIDEGGER 
was publishing, can now be reconstructed in its vari-
ous phases: old teacher and young student ( 1916-19); 
director ofthe Freiburg philosophical seminar and his 
teaching assistant ( 1919-23 ); the Marburg prelude to 
the philosophical succession with Husserl's impending 
retirement (1923-28); and the philosophical estrange-
ment and denunciation (1927-31). 
(1) The young student Heidegger was an enthusi-
ast of phenomenology years before Husserl assumed 
the Freiburg chair in philosophy in 1916. Husserl 's in-
fluence is second only to Aristotle during this period. 
Heidegger's dissertation on PSYCHOLOGISM in 1913, as 
well as the more historically oriented Habilitations-
schrift on a doctrine of categories and signification in 
1915, assume a distinctly phenomenological orienta-
tion (e.g., in intuitively "reading off' categoria! differ-
entiations directly from reality itself) in the context of 
the Aristotelian Scholasticism and neo-Kantianism that 
comprised Heidegger's primary schooling at Freiburg. 
Husserl was instrumental in having the Habilitations-
schrift published in 1916 and, by the end of 1917, 
actually 1ooks forward to the occasions of "sym-
philosophein" with "my most va1uab1e philosophica1 
co-worker, in whom 1 have great hopes." Before 1918 
ends, he nominates Heidegger as the "phenomenologist 
ofreligion" in his school, taking over where his former 
assistant, ADOLF REINACH, killed in the war, left off. 
In retrospect, Husserl regrets having come too late 
in Heidegger's philosophica1 upbringing, after he had

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
TUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL anafyses utilizing termino)-
ogy drawn from Ideen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie 
und phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913) abound 
in Heidegger's examination of the founding relations 
of motivation operative in the essential historicity of 
religious experience as reflected in the devotionallit-
erature. A growing sense of the hermeneutica! ratio-
nality of ali experience is still coupled with Husserl's 
centering of eidetic-transcendental phenomenology in 
a pure EGO of empty potentiality, which the young 
Heidegger sets over against a historical ego fulfill-
ing itself in its situations, while calling on a genetic 
phenomenology to develop the founding connections 
oforigin ofthe various "UFEWORLDs" (theoretical, aes-
thetic, ethical, religious) as motivated and constituted 
within the absolute historicity of pure consciousness. 
The initially medieval notion of INTENTIONALITY, al-
ready in place as a relation ofnoesis and NOEMA in the 
1915 work, is reduced from the theoretically oriented 
consciousness-over-against-an-object to the more pri-
ma! dynamis of a sheer directedness-toward, under-
stood as the wellspring and "giving" element of life, 
its elan vital. When Heidegger in his first course after 
the war calls this the prima) "It" instead ofthe prima! I, 
this "It" could still be construed by students common 
to them as what Husserl in his courses was already 
calling the "anonymously functioning intentionality" 
of inner time-consciousness. 
(2) Airman Heidegger returns from the war philo-
sophically transformed into a radical phenomenologist 
and, as Husserl 's teaching assistant, espouses their 
common cause in his first lecture course of 1919 by 
rebutting the 1912 objections of Paul Natorp ( 1854--
1929) -
objections still unanswered by Husserl -
against phenomenology's ambition to find access to 
and describe immediate experience, regarded by the 
tradition as inaccessible and inexpressible. The in-
stantaneous and astounding teaching success of his 
new spokesperson is regarded by Husserl as his own 
success and the success of the cause of phenomen-
ology. Terms like "lifeworld" (Lebenswelt), "destruc-
tion" or "unbuilding" (Abbau -!ater, in the hands of 
JACQUES DERRIDA, deconstruction), and "sense ofbeing" 
(Seinssinn) first occurring in their respective courses 
and manuscripts at this time suggest the fruits that are 
being borne in common from their continuing philo-
sophical conversations. Husserl's courses during this 
period are marked by a growing appreciation of the 
history of philosophy for his thought, the beginnings 
of a GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY based on his ear)ier stud-
ies of inner time-consciousness, and a confrontation 
with WILHELM DILTHEY's more hermeneutica) approach 
to phenomenology, as in the oft-repeated course enti-
tled "Natur und Geist" ( 1916-28) that continues the 
constitutive analyses of the then not yet published 
Ideen II [ 1912-15]. Indeed, Dilthey scholars like Ed-
uard Spranger (1878-1963) and GEORG MISCH already 
re gard Husserl 's phenomenology as HERMENEUTICS, and 
students at Freiburg common to Husserl and Heideg-
ger, like FRITZ KAUFMANN and GUNTHER STERN, serve 
only to reinforce this impression of the inner compat-
ibility of a HERMENEUTIC AL PHENOMENOLOGY and of a 
common problematic between Husserl and Heidegger 
at this phase in their development. 
Husserl 's implicit trust in his teaching assistant is 
demonstrated by the way they share the seminar duties 
of each semester, where new students are required to 
attend Heidegger's "phenomenological exercises for 
beginners" before they can participate in the exer-
cises "for advanced students" always given by Husserl. 
Husserl's strong respect for Heidegger's originality, 
manifested from the start in a highly idiosyncratic style 
of expression, is evident in letters of recommendation 
that regularly excuse Heidegger's lack of publication 
by pointing to the difficult labor of a ripening genius 
in search of his unique language. This respect will 
eventually backfire upon Husserl 's first encounter with 
the galleys of Sein und Zeit ( 1927), with a novel lan-
guage and impenetrable style in which he could no 
longer find his own way of thinking. But during the 
early Freiburg period of close collaboration in teach-
ing and in discussion, where he has occasion to read 
dense manuscripts penned by Heidegger like the 1921 
review of KARL JASPERS' Psychologie der Weltanschau-
ungen and the 1922 introduction to a book on Aris-
totle, Husserl comes to regard his brilliant young as-
sistant as his one true follower, to whom the future of 
the phenomenological movement was to be entrusted 
upon his retirement. The oft-cited anecdota! statement 
attributed to Husserl during this period thus rings true: 
"Phenomenology, that's Heidegger and I- and no o ne 
el se. "(3) In his seminar exercises, Heidegger makes no 
secret of his preference for Logische Untersuchungen 
(1900-190 1) over /deen 1 among Husserl 's then pub-

lished works. Heidegger's seminar on Jdeen J held in 
the winter semester 1922/23 thus marks a turn ing point 
toward a more public critique ofHusserl's constitutive 
phenomenology injuxtaposition to his own hermeneu-
tica! phenomenology, in a burst of independence that 
accompanies the shower of new concepts that would 
become Sein und Zeit. He writes KARL L<)WJTH: "In the 
final hour of the seminar, 1 publicly burned and de-
stroyed the Jdeen to such an extent that 1 dare say that 
the essential foundations for the whole [ ofmy work] are 
now cleanly laid out. Looking back from this vantage 
to the Logische Untersuchungen, I am now convinced 
that Husserl was never a philosopher, not even for one 
second in his life. He becomes ever more ludicrous." In 
a subsequent letter, he notes that his course on ontology 
in the summer of 1923 "strikes the main blows against 
phenomenology. I now stand completely on my own 
feet ... There is no chance of getting an appointment. 
And after 1 have published, my prospects will be fin-
ished. The old man [der Alte, referring to Husserl] will 
then realize that 1 am wringing his neck -
and then 
succession is out. But I can't help myself." And in July 
1923 he writes to Karl Jaspers about Husserl receiving 
a "call" to a chair in Berlin: "He 1ives from the mission 
of 'founder of phenomeno1ogy.' No one knows what 
that is ... no one understands a 'mathematics of the 
ethica1' (the latest!)." 
And indeed Heidegger's final Freiburg course un-
der Husserl entitled "Ontology: Hermeneutics of Fac-
ticity" de1ivers a blow against a sense of FORMAL ANO 
MATERIAL ONTOLOGY understood as merely a theory of 
objects, which thereby allows a more crucial sense 
of Being as object-free, yet sustaining the genesis of 
objects, to be overlooked. For a phenomenon is not 
merely a what, an object, but more basically a how of 
access and apprehension. But how it gives itself, the 
possibility latent in the designation of a phenomenon 
as intentionality, is betrayed by taking the ideal of sci-
ence tobe mathematical, with ali its concomitant tradi-
tional assumptions. What is needed in this situation is 
a critica! destruction of the tradition in order to return 
to Aristotle, where we shall see that something more 
original has lapsed into degeneration and concealment, 
and that even this self-concealment must be made a 
phenomenon by and for phenomenology. This is the 
explicative route taken by a hermeneutics of facticity. 
The first course at Marburg in the winter of 1923/24, 
"Introduction to Phenomenological Research," contin-
ues this historical critique by a running comparison 
of Husserl with Descartes, who infected Husserl with 
a "concern for known knowledge" that leads to an 
ideal of scientificity, certainty, and EYIDENCE that de-
cides in advance what the theme of the science of 
phenomeno1ogy is to be. Thus the rousing battle cry 
of"back to the matters themselves!" comes to disguise 
a dogmatism ofthe narrowest kind. Why is it that con-
sciousness becomes the central theme of phenomen-
ology? Why should its field of research be conscious-
ness, its acts, and its objects? Why is lived experience 
designated as being-conscious? Phenomenology thus 
becomes the mathesis of lived experiences, which as 
acts are intentiona! and as objects are apprehensible 
in inner perception, and as such define the region of 
consciousness. Concern for absolute scientificity -
for the security, universal binding force, and valid-
ity that it brings, where being is reduced to being the 
possible region of a science -
in fact draws pheno-
menology away from what is primarily decisive for it 
since its initial breakthrough, its capacity to speak of 
the freely given matters themselves. Heidegger in fact 
began the course with an initial exposure ofthese mat-
ters through his very first etymological analysis ofthe 
Greek roots of "phenomeno-logy," revealing that the 
self-showing ofphenomena must always contend with 
the ineluctable countermovement of self-concealment. 
He also notes that the very phenomenon of concern 
(Sorge), understood purely in its measure of restless-
ness and questioning, already serves to take phenom-
ena like consciousness, person, ego, subject, etc., back 
to their original soi! in factical DASEIN, back to the Greek 
concern for the Dasein of the world and the being of 
life. 
The course of summer 1925, "History of the Con-
cept ofTime," with its "destruction" ofthe sixth Logis-
che Untersuchungen and renewed "public burning" of 
Jdeen 1, provides the most sustained and detailed cri-
tique of Husserl that we shall ever get from Heidegger. 
In the context of developing his own "phenomenology 
grounded in the question of Being" against the back-
ground of its history and three breakthrough discover-
ies (intentionality, categoria! intuition, and therefrom 
a new sense ofthe a priori) made by Husserl, Heideg-
ger indicts his mentor and ali previous phenomenolo-
gists for a double ontologica! negligence, not only of 

336 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the question of the being of intentionality but of the 
question of the sense of Being itself. But in Husserl 's 
analyses ofintentionality and categoria! intuition in the 
Sixth Investigation, Heidegger sees the beginnings of 
the broadening ofthe sense oftruth and givenness in the 
direction of the pre-judicative, which Heidegger now 
wishes to radicalize back to its full Greek beginnings. 
Husserl's placing ofthe primacy on PERCEPTION and 
its overt bodily presence is reduced back to the more 
immediate presence of handy tools, which in turn is 
founded upon the more tacit non-objective presence of 
concernedness and its environing world. It is in this 
way that Husserl 's EIDETIC METHOD is displaced by a 
more fundamental understanding of Being, as a pri-
mary familiarity from which we understand everything 
else. In fact, in this context, Heidegger borrows a term 
first coined in Ideen II (written in 1912-15), "appre-
sentation," to describe the empowering relations of co-
presence between world and things. In noting Husserl 's 
transmittal to him of the unpublished manuscript of 
ldeen II, as well as the progress that Husserl had made 
beyond it toward a phenomenological PSYCHOLOGY, no-
tably in his repeated Freiburg courses on "Nature and 
Spirit," Heidegger adds a personal remark to his stu-
dents of 1925 concerning his ongoing relationship with 
his old mentor: "But Jet me say that Husserl is aware 
of my objections from my lecture courses in Freiburg 
as well as here in Marburg and from personal conver-
sations, and is essentially making allowances for them, 
so that my critique today no longer applies in its full 
trenchancy. Here it is not really a matter of criticism 
for the sake of criticizing but criticism for the sake of 
laying open the issues and promoting understanding. 
It almost goes without saying that even today I still 
regard myself as a learner in relation to Husserl." 
(4) The detailed dedication to Husserl found in 
the footnote in Sein und Zeit ( 1927) expresses grat-
itude to Husserl "for incisive personal guidance and 
free access to unpublished investigations" during their 
Freiburg years, which served to familiarize Heidegger 
with the most diverse areas of phenomenological re-
search, thereby allowing him to take a few steps himself 
toward disclosing the "matters themselves." The brief 
dedication page itself, along with the nearly complete 
rough manuscript of Sein und Zeit, was ceremoniously 
presented to Husserl "in grateful respect and friend-
ship" on his birthday in April 1926. 
In the same month, Husserl got his first real look at 
this long awaited book, now scheduled for publication 
in his Jahrbuch, in the form of the first galleys. The 
shock of alienation is immediate. Heidegger writes to 
Jaspers in May 1926: "From the fact that Husserl finds 
the whole thing strange and can 'no Ion ger find a place' 
for it in the usual phenomenology, 1 gather that 1 am de 
facto already further away than I myself believe and 
see." Despite the shock, Husserl continues to promote 
the cause of Heidegger, whose reputation in academic 
circles grows exponentially with the publication ofhis 
eagerly anticipated book. 
In October of 1927, Husserl, approaching manda-
tory retirement, invites Heidegger, his anticipated suc-
cessor, to collaborate with him on a joint statement 
defining "Phenomenology" for the Encyclopaedia Bri-
tannica. Spending ten days at Husserl's home, Hei-
degger writes a portion of the second of (ultimately) 
four drafts and begins the critique of Husserl's first 
draft and second partial draft. Draft and counterdraft, 
revisions and counterrevisions, annotations, and asso-
ciated correspondence together tell a detailed tale of 
confrontation of two phenomenologies attempting to 
meet halfway and find a rapprochement, and quickly 
ending in failure. 
In the first draft, Husserl introduces his transcenden-
tal phenomenology by way of psychological pheno-
menology. In his counterdraft, Heidegger pauses on 
this way in order first to situate phenomenology's re-
turn to consciousness within the history ofthe thought 
ofBeing, beginning with Parmenides' dictum relating 
Being ineluctably to its thought and ending in KANT's 
transcendental consciousness. (Elements ofthis talk of 
Being are carried over by Husserl into his third, but 
not the final, draft.) Heidegger thus seems to concede 
phenomenology's need to return to consciousness, but 
at once notes that the "field of problems" that is thus 
opened up is not simply that "of pure subjectivity," 
as Husserl quickly emends, but that "of the being of 
entities in the articulated multiplicity of its kinds and 
levels." Pull and counterpull thus continue throughout 
the draft. 
In his remarks and in a subsequent letter, Heideg-
ger tries to convince Husserl that the central problem 
of Sein und Zeit is likewise transcendental constitu-
tion, that this possibility is to be found precisely in 
the being that ek-sists and so is not something present-

HUSSERL AND HEIDEGGER 
337 
at-hand, but rather as a being-in-the-world that under-
stands Being -
an issue that they had been debating 
since Husserl first saw the galleys the year before. But 
Husserl could never accept that a world belongs to 
the essence of the pure ego, and Heidegger kept ask-
ing what this absolute ego could be in its being in 
distinction from the pure psychic ego. Thus Husserl 
concludes, in a letter to ROMAN INGARDEN, that Heideg-
ger "has not grasped the entire sense of the method of 
phenomenological reduction," and so the basic course 
ofhis thought. A month earlier, he had written: 
"Heidegger has become my close friend and I be-
long among his admirers. Ali the more reason why I 
have to regret that his work (and his lecture courses as 
well) appear tobe essentially different from my works 
and courses, and that, at least up to now, none of our 
common students has built viable bridges between us. 
There is a great deal in the ba lance for future philoso-
phy on how and whether he works his way through to 
an apprehension ofmy universal intuitions .... Now he 
is a power, absolutely honest and not ambitious, poised 
strictly on the issues. Every great one-sidedness, that 
oftruly independent thinkers, blazes the trai! anew. Let 
us hope so." 
The end ofthe year brings the first committee meet-
ing to nominate Husserl's successor at Freiburg, with 
Husserl participating in an advisory capacity. Heideg-
ger is notified of the proceedings along with a request 
to devote an entire day at the Husserl home "for a scien-
tific discussion ofyour book." The meeting takes place 
on Sunday, January 8, 1928. Shortly thereafter, Husserl 
notifies Heidegger that the committee had unanimously 
decided to submit his name as the sole candidate (unica 
loco) for the chair. The committee proposal to the 
provincial ministry of education observes, in support 
of Heidegger: "The work that appeared just last year, 
Sein und Zeit (First Part), placed him in the forefront of 
contemporary philosophers. He thus effectively joins 
in the movements stemming from WILHELM DILTHEY and 
phenomenology that seek to provide a new orientation 
for ali of philosophy. The astounding originality with 
which Heidegger attempts to develop and at once to en-
rich the basic ideas ofthese movements in their radical 
consequences has for years, even before the appearance 
of his work, manifestly had its effects solely through 
Heidegger's impressive lecture courses and seminars 
at Marburg. This researcher is undoubtedly also one 
of the most significant philosophical teachers of our 
time." 
In retrospect, Husserl admits to doubts in his own 
capacity to penetra te this new direction of thought so 
alien to his own way ofthinking, and thus accepts Hei-
degger's assurances that he is sti li pursuing a transcen-
dental phenomenology, as the forthcoming Second Part 
of Sein und Zeit (which shifts the formal focus from 
"ek-sistence" to "transcendence") would show. Feeling 
isolated by the recurrent tendency ofhis many students 
to go their own ways with his ideas, leaving him "a 
beckoning leader without followers," obsessed by the 
idea of assuring a fu ture for the transcendental pheno-
menology that he had founded, he sees the successful 
teacher Heidegger as the only candidate who could 
continue his "school," and so decides unconditionally 
in his favor. Despite his misgivings, the old Husserl 
looks forward to Heidegger's return to Freiburg as an 
opportunity to bring him back under his "instructive in-
fluence," thereby to "overcome his raw brilliance" and 
win him over through his own more sober and mature 
insights into "the radical new spirit of transcendental 
phenomenology." This hope would be sorely disap-
pointed. 
In April 1926, in view of the imminent appearance 
of Sein und Zeit in his Jahrbuch, Husserl had asked 
Heidegger to edit his 1905 lectures on inner time-
consciousness from manuscripts transcribed by EDITH 
STEIN. The only slightly reworked edition appears in 
mid-1928 asJahrbuch IX, now under Heidegger's gen-
eral editorship. Husserl complains of not even seeing 
the galleys, although Heidegger had sent him an ad-
vance copy of his unusually terse foreword ("Quite 
appropriate!"- "Durchaus angemessen!"- replies 
Husserl) at the same time that his appointment is con-
firmed by the provincial ministry. Heidegger's return 
to Freiburg in late 1928 proves to be far less reconcil-
ing than Husserl had hoped. By the end of the year, it 
becomes clear to Husserl that any intense philosophi-
cal interchange is for Heidegger "an unnecessary, un-
wanted, uneasy matter." The barest interchanges con-
tinue only on more formal public occasions. 
On April 8, 1929, at the university gathering of 
former students on the festive occasion of Husserl's 
seventieth birthday, Heidegger formally presents the 
Festschrift (a special edition of the Jahrbuch) to 
Husserl along with a short speech addressing Husserl 's 

338 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
leadership and their corresponding followership over 
the years, not without some allusion to their personal 
relationship: "And so the works we present to you 
are also only a testimony that we wanted to follow 
your leadership, not a proof that we have succeeded 
in being followers." Heidegger also rhetorically reiter-
ates some of the points that he had been making over 
the years concern ing phenomenology's "to the matters 
themselves!" as an open possibility for ever new di-
rections, as a breakthrough in attitude rather than as a 
particular doctrine, worldview, or school: "Or has your 
research not first of ali created a whole new space for 
philosophical inquiry, with new demands, transformed 
assessments, a fresh regard for the hidden powers of 
the great tradition ofWestern philosophy? Yes, exactly 
that!" 
With the publication of his Formale und transzen-
dentale Logik in mid-1929, Husserl finally takes the 
time (two months) for a meticulous reading of not 
only Sein und Zeit but also Kant und das Problem der 
Metaphysik ( 1929) and, of course, Heidegger's contri-
bution to his Festschrift, "Vom Wesen des Grundes" 
( 1929), "in order to come to a dispassionate and con-
clusive position toward the Heideggerian philosophy." 
The marginalia in his copies of these texts (ali auto-
graphed copies from Heidegger!) graphically record 
his thoroughgoing rejection of them both in method 
and in content. To Heidegger's dedications of"friend-
ship" and "heartfelt greetings," Husserl now counters, 
"amicus Plato magis amica veritas." The vei led attacks 
discrediting his works, which associates had warned 
him about for years, Husserl now finds in abundance 
in Heidegger's writings, as in the polemic against the 
primacy ofperception and the "worldless ego." 
Husserl rebuts Heidegger's "unjust objections" 
against Descartes as ifthey were attacks upon himself, 
and regards the forthcoming German edition of Carte-
sianische Meditationen [ 1931] as his reply to Sein und 
Zeit. He recognizes his Intentionalitiit in Heidegger's 
Verstehen and its a priori, as well as the drive toward 
a formal ontology that, however, would no longer bea 
mathesis inasmuch as Being is not objective ("l don't 
see this at ali," notes Husserl, for whom "being" is 
being-constituted); repeatedly asks "What does 'con-
stitute' mean"? in view of the polyvalence to which 
Heidegger subjects the term; and cannot comprehend 
Heidegger 's phronetic sense of "repetition" in view of 
his own more univocal Platonic sense. 
Husserl's "Nachwort zu meinen Jdeen" ( 1930) 
brings the first public denunciation of the new "phi-
losophy of Existenz," without, however, openly nam-
ing Heidegger. The same circumlocution occurs in 
Husserl 's lectures to the Kant Societies in Frankfurt, 
Berlin, and Halle in 1931, "Phănomenologie und An-
thropologie," which inveighs against the overriding in-
terest in a PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY among "the 
younger German philosophers." On January 6, 1931, 
Husserl writes his confidential letter to ALEXANDER 
PFĂNDER, baring his soul over the entire course of his 
relationship with Heidegger, "my dearest friend for al-
most a decade," from initial promise to final disavowal. 
"Incomprehensibility precludes friendship- this re-
versa) in scientific estimation and personal relationship 
was one ofthe most difficult ordeals ofmy life." 
Extant correspondence suggests that personal and 
politica! recriminations were exchanged between the 
Husserl and Heidegger households un tii Husserl 's 
death in 1938, when Heidegger's conspicuous ab-
sence from the funeral led to further recriminations 
in the ensuing years. Philosophically and pedagog-
ically, Heidegger held two seminars of "phenomen-
ological exercises" in the first semester of his return 
to Freiburg, only to drop such titles in his works and 
teaching until his !ater, more autobiographical essays, 
although Husserl and his phenomenology are men-
tioned on occasion in the thirty-year interim. In fact, 
the earliest of these philosophical-biographical tracts, 
the quasi-factual "Dialogue on/from Language" with 
the Japanese, is introduced by a note ( 1959) seeking 
"to counter widely circulated allegations" that Hei-
degger was responsible for the deletion of the ded-
ication to Husserl from the edition of Sein und Zeit 
that appeared in 1942. This dialogue on the "language 
of being" tacitly underscores the signal importance of 
the First lnvestigation on "Expression and Meaning" 
for the )ater Heidegger's permutation of intentional-
ity into a "hermeneutic relation" of mutual c1aim and 
"usage" between Being and human being. Other such 
tracts in which the old Heidegger retrospectively revis-
its his early personal-philosophical relationship with 
Husserl are the letter that prefaces WILLIAM RICHARD-
soN's Through Phenomenology to Thought ( 1963); 
the article dedicated to the publisher of the "pheno-
menological movement," Hermann Niemeyer, entitled 

HUSSERL AND HEIDEGGER 
339 
"Mein Weg in die Phănomenologie" (1963 ), and the 
Spiegel interview ( 1966, published 1976). In fact, Hei-
degger's modification of Richardson's original title, 
"From/Through Phenomenology to Thought," where 
phenomenology is the process of "allowing the most 
proper matter of thought to show itself," is itself an 
acknowledgment of a lasting debt to Husserl 's "princi-
ple of phenomenology" for Heidegger's own lifelong 
endeavor to variously indicate the place of emergence 
of the archaic Being (Seyn) that holds, draws, pulls, 
solicits, or is otherwise ineluctably related to human 
being. The "unrelenting speli" and "magic" ofthe Lo-
gische Untersuchungen, especially the sixth, invoked 
in "Mein Weg in die Phănomenologie," is coup1ed with 
the invocation, contrary to Husserl's shunning of the 
historical, of the authority of great thinkers like Aris-
totle in leading Heidegger to a deeper sense of the 
"self-manifestation of phenomena." 
In an essay entitled "Das Ende der Philosophie und 
die Aufgabe des Denkens" ( 1964), Husserl is criticized 
along with HEGEL for ending philosophy by making sub-
jectivity its "matter." Heidegger sees a deeper pheno-
menological matter that remains unthought in philos-
ophy's matter that it is the task of thought to indicate, 
namely, the clearing of an opening that allows any-
thing whatsoever to appear. The old Heidegger's last 
of four seminars with French scholars in Zăhringen in 
1973 is devoted almost exclusively to the question of 
how Husserl touches or "brushes" the question of the 
sense and truth of Being with his notion of categoria! 
intuition in the Sixth Investigation, thus for Heidegger 
the "focus of Husserl 's thought," and yet eventually 
neglects this question in the remainder ofhis thought. 
The doctrine of categoria! intuition broadens the no-
tion of givenness far beyond sense-givenness, to the 
categoria! realm that enables things to appear, which 
is thus appresent in presenting things. Being is accord-
ingly the presenting process that necessari1y presents 
things, not itself a thing but the clearing in which and 
by which things appear. Being is not a concept that 
takes into possession, but an horismos that firmly but 
gently environs what the re-gard is meant to guard. 
This clearing, the locus out of which the question of 
time and the truth of being is to be developed, is the 
matter "itself' of phenomenology, tautological think-
ing at its ontologica! best, where phcnomenology aga in 
recognizes its roots in Parmenides "himself."

IMAGINATION 
The emphasis placed in pheno-
menology on eidetic insight and PERCEPTION might 
seem to render the role of imagination superftuous 
or secondary. While both perceiving and essential in-
sight (Wesensschau) bear on stable, if not altogether 
fixed, regularities- namely, physical objects and ma-
terial and formal essences respectively- imaginati an 
would seem to be concerned with fugiti ve phenomena 
that elude the invariancy so highly prized in pheno-
menological description. Yet from the very beginning, 
EDMUND HUSSERL considered imagination a topic wor-
thy of serious pursuit in two respects: as something to 
be described in its own right, and as having special 
methodological merit. 
( 1) Imagination describedfor its own sake. At first, 
Husserl followed FRANZ BRENTANO in maintaining that 
there are no essential differences in the act-character of 
imaginati an and perception, both being modes of"rep-
rcscnting" ( Vorstellen ); the critica] differences consist 
only in the different kinds of content at stake in the two 
acts. But by the time of Husserl's lectures on "Phan-
tasie und Bildbewusstsein"- which were part of the 
same 1904/05 course that included the lectures on in ner 
time-consciousness- he had rejected this approach as 
inadequate, since it made the difference between phan-
tasms and perceptions either a mere matter of degree or 
a question of direct vs. indirect representation: sensa-
tions are direct and unmediated representations, while 
phantasms are mediated by connections and concepts 
of various kinds. He insists instead that there are dif-
ferences of kind, not just of degree, between what we 
imagine and what we perceive, which are not just two 
ways of "objectifying" in which the appearance of an 
abject occurs. 
The crucial differences are differences in act-
character, i.e., in modes of consciousness: in the pre-
sentation ( Gegenwărtigen, Prasentation) of something 
present vs. the non-presentation or RE-PRESENTATION 
(Nicht-Gegenwiirtigen, Vergegenwiirtigen) of some-
thing not-present. Perceptual consciousness gives its 
content the "credit" of being "actually there," as "it-
self," given "in person," while imagining conscious-
ness "discredits" it as "non-actual," "merely" re-
presented. In the case of an "image" qua "picture" 
(Bild), a more complex structurc emerges: Husserl dis-
tinguishes the picture (i.e., thc photograph, painting, 
etc.) as a perceived physical thing; the pictorial abject 
(e.g., the image of a child) as sheer appearance; and the 
subject of the picture ( e.g., the independently existing 
child who has been painted or photographed). 
These distinctions are sti li observed in Husserl 's 
analysis ofDurer's engraving "The Knight, Death, and 
the Devii" in ldeen zu einer reinen Phiinomenologie 
und phiinomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913). But 
analysis highlights the different modes of conscious-
ness at stake in experiencing it. "Normal perception" 
grasps the engraving as a physical thing, while "per-
ceptive consciousness" focuses on the figures, "knight 
on horseback," "devii," etc. "Aesthetic observation," 
on the other hand, seeks to apprehend the "depicted 
realities," e.g., a flesh-and-blood knight. Husserl em-
phasizes that the perceptive consciousness of the en-
graved figures is a "neutrality modification" ofthe ini-
tial perception of the material work of art: although 
the latter is posited as a really existing thing, the pic-
taria! abject itself is given ncither as existing nor as 
not-existing. This claim allows him to make the much 
more general assertion that "imagining in general" is 
a "neutrality modification ofthe 'positing' (setzenden) 
act ofre-presentation ( Vergegenwiirtigung), and thus of 
remembering in the widest sense of the term." Ali re-
presentations can therefore be divided into memories 
on the one hand and their neutralized re-presentations 
on the other -
i.e., into positing and non-positing 
re-presentations, of which imaginings form a signifi-
cant subset along with supposings, doubtings, etc. And 
thanks to this common genealogy, imaginings may 
combine with perceivings and rememberings in mani-
fold ways (sa that there can be imaginings of memories 
or perceptions as well as imaginings in memories) and 
with themselves (so that we can have "phantasies in 
phantasies"). 
This line of thought would seem to privi lege MEM-
ORY -and thus perception, from which most memories 
stem-over imaginati an as the mere (albeit sometimes 
complex) "modification" ofthe former. Yet Husserl in-

IMAGINATION 
341 
sists that while imagination is typically a modification 
of a positing re-presentation (i.e., an act of remember-
ing) ora positing presentation (i.e., an act of perceiv-
ing), it is not necessarily linked to a particular previous 
positing and need not modify any particular previous 
act as such, but can be an entirely spontaneous act. 
Such an act nonetheless preserves features basic to ev-
ery act of remembering or perceiving (e.g., horizon, 
the field structure of space, the successive nature of 
time, the fulfillment or cancellation ofintentions, etc.). 
Moreover, although the perceptual anticipations that 
are non-independent parts of ali acts of percei ving need 
not give rise to explicit acts of imaginati ve EXPECTATION, 
these predelineations can indeed motivate an intuitive 
filling-out, a kind of imaginati ve explication function-
ing as a quasi-determination ofwhat is given in passive 
synthesis as a determinable indeterminacy. Here too, 
there is neither a temporally nested re-production of 
any particular past course of experiencing nor a neu-
trality modification of something in particular already 
posited, but a kind of quasi-experiencing according to 
the general style proper to the type of objectivity in 
question. To such imaginative explication there must 
also be added the possibility of an imaginative trans-
formation ( Umfingieren) that varies some aspect ofthe 
given ( or constructs an entire phantasy-world) while 
respecting its general style, yielding an as-if experi-
encing and its correlative quasi-reality. 
In !ater writings such as Erfahrung und Urteil 
(1939), Husserl refers to such imagination as "quasi-
positing," i.e., it posits its objects as if they were exis-
tent, causally efficacious, etc. This brings imagination 
significantly closer to what is traditionally regarded 
as "fiction" and hence to the Coleridgean criterion 
of "willing suspension of disbelief." And it calls into 
question the necessity of any strict neutrality modifica-
tion, since the "as-if' is not ontically neutra): it takes 
the imagined object ( or state of affairs) to be possibly 
-but only purely possibly- the case. It also suggests 
thatfeigning, that is, pretending tobe the case, whether 
in action or in mentation, is an important variant form 
of imagining. 
(2) lmagination as methodologically valuable. It 
was thanks precisely to the recognition of a kind of 
imagination that is not necessarily tethered to memory, 
yet preserves fundamental structural features of experi-
ence per se in its free play that Husserl was able to em-
ploy it as a keystone in the arch of phenomenological 
method. For only by the "free variation" of examples 
through their imaginati ve exfoliation can genuine con-
sistencies and regularities appear that might otherwise 
never be grasped. In ldeen !, Husserl 's example of the 
free use of imagination in EIDETIC METHOD is the geome-
ter, who is not restricted to actual skctches or models, 
but elucidates essential clarifications by generating, in 
phantasy, variation upon variation of the geometrica) 
figure in question. Similarly, the phenomenologist can-
not derive ali pertinent essential knowledge from the 
primordial givenness of perception, but must supple-
ment what experience has actually delivered with what 
imagination can project. It is notable that this necessary 
supplement need not be restricted to the productions of 
the investigator's own imagination but can include-
indeed, should include- contributions from the imag-
inative work of others in the fields ofHISTORY and LITER-
ATURE (especially poetry); Husserl even names fiction 
a "vital element" and source for the truth phenomen-
ology seeks. (As MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY and others 
have pointed out, the investigator's own imagination 
is historically and culturally situated and thus limited, 
making recourse to others' stories even more crucial.) 
Husserl further refines and extends the methodolog-
ical use ofimagination in phenomenology in Erfahrung 
und Urteil. A given case (whether actually experienced 
or imagined) is taken as a "model" or example that is 
then varied in imagination; the imaginati ve activity can 
be active, i.e., willed as such, or spontaneous, i.e., just 
occurring on its own without explicit volition, and can 
be continued indefinitely. Eventually, sufficient "over-
lapping" (Deckung) occurs among the variants to allow 
a "unity of coincidence" to ari se, and an invariant- an 
ei dos or essence, that which is the same throughout-
emerges and can be grasped in its own right. Another 
crucial aspect ofthis procedure is what might be termed 
the test of "imagining away": if a given feature can-
not be eliminated in imagination, then it belongs to the 
phenomenon under investigation. What is essential to 
a phenomenon is what it cannot do without, and imagi-
nation is indispensable in establishing this sine qua non 
status. The via negativa of this approach rejoins and 
complements the via positiva of allowing the invariant 
to arise from the series ofvariations. But what matters 
most is that imagination, whether employed actively 
or passively, gives us access to a realm ofpossibilities 

342 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
considerably broader than any set of instances drawn 
from our own perceptual experience (and thus posited 
as actually happening oras having happened). 
Imagining is an essentially intuitional act rather than 
a conceptual one. Yet despite staking out the enor-
mous territory of re-presentations and doing much 
of the most extensive, painstaking mapping of it, 
Husserl rarely singled out the intuitional element ofre-
presentations as such, including the instance of imag-
ination. It was left to his close student and disciple, 
EUGEN FINK, to take this step in a prize essay and 
dissertation entitled "Vergegenwartigung und Bild," 
first published in the Jahrbuch fiir Philosophie und 
phiinomenologische Forschung in 1930. Fink consid-
ered ali re-presentations to involve an origi'lary access 
to temporal horizons not given in (oras) the present, an 
insight that had already led Husserl to his investigations 
of inner time-consciousness in his 1904/05 lectures. 
But Fink emphasizes that the temporal horizons and 
spatial parameters of what we imagine constituie an 
entire WORLD, a "phantasy-world" (a "quasi-world," as 
Husserl says in Erfahrung und Urteil). Fink describes 
this world as inherently "possible"- even when ele-
ments ha ve been incorporated into it from actual worlds 
and even though its "open leeway (Spielraum) ofpossi-
bilities" are structured in accordance with the "a priori 
laws of intuitiveness in general." The ontic status of 
such a world is that of"unreality," ofthe "as it were." 
Yet although objects in the phantasy-world are at once 
possible and unreal, they are coherent and consistent 
enough for predicative judgments to be made about 
them, and taken together, forma totality that transcends 
consciousness. 
This phantasy-world is not to be confused with an-
other image-world, also intuitional in character: the 
"picture-world" (Bildwelt) that opens to us when a cer-
tain appearance serves as its "bearer," e.g., the sur-
face of a painted canvas. This surf ace is typically hid-
den from direct apprehension; we see through it into 
the picture-world with which it coincides. Thus Fink 
calls the image a "window" onto the picture-world, 
and such a window, the unique point of access to the 
picture-world, is "nothing other than the pure picture-
phenomenon itself." 
JEAN-PAUL SARTRE's L 'imaginaire ( 1940) a]so ends 
with an analysis of a work of art regarded as what he 
calls an "externa! image." For Sartre, such an image 
serves as an effective "analogon" for a purely imagined 
object; by grasping it in its very materiality, we are con-
veyed to the latter, which is the only object that counts 
in imagination. In this way, Sartre merges into one con-
tinuous experience what Fink would keep rigorously 
separate: re-presentational acts of pure "phantasy" and 
presentational acts of picture-consciousness based on 
a "bearer." However, Sartre's study- based on his 
earlier study of alternative conceptions of imagination, 
L 'imagination ( 1936) -
is valuable for its broader 
typology of the "image family." The pure image-
usually regarded as a "mental image" -
is the first 
member of this family and possesses four traits: it is 
a consciousness not of an image, but of an object in 
image form; it does not possess an endless wealth of 
detail as does a perceptum, but "suffers from a sort of 
essential poverty''; its object is posited as a "nothing-
ness" that itself takes four forms (nonexistent, absent, 
existing elsewhere, or "neutralized," i.e., not posited 
as existing); and it is spontaneous. 
Sartre also discerns other kinds ofimages, largely on 
the basis ofthe difference in the materiality by which 
they are presented. Some of these possess a strictly 
physical medium of presentation (photographs, illus-
trations, portraits, caricatures, impersonations ), others 
a mixture of material and psychic media (faces in 
flames, arabesques seen in tapestry, hypnagogic im-
ages). What matters most, however, is not the medium 
ofimagining, much less its objects, but the precise "at-
titude of consciousness" or intentiona! stance we take 
up: e.g., seeing the painting of a person as a portrait, 
or regarding a schematic drawing as representing a 
dancing figure. Part of this attitude is also the knowl-
edge we bring to the act of imagination; thus I can 
never be surprised by what 1 imagine, since I find in 
the image only the very comprehension 1 ha ve brought 
to it, though affectivity or feeling is also integral to 
image-consciousness. For Sartre, then, the imaginer's 
intentiona] act transcends the images themselves, aim-
ing toward the real objects they signify. Yet what we 
get is nevertheless the "essential ambiguity" of an un-
real object in a derealized "anti-world," and in the very 
act of intending it, 1 "make myself unreal" as well. 
A less despairing view is found in EDWARD s. CASEY's 
lmagining: A Phenomenological Study ( 1976), which 
provides a twofold analysis of imagination, "inten-
tiona!" and "eidetic." On an intentiona! analysis, the 

IMAGINATION 
343 
object phase consists in the "image" (i.e., how the 
imagined object is given) and the "imaginative pre-
sentation," which is made up of the specific content 
imagined (i.e., just what we imagine); the "imagina! 
margin" (the edge of the content); and its "world-
frame" of imagina! space and time (the world-frame 
standing somewhere between Fink's commitment to 
a full-fledged imagined world and Sartre's dismissive 
idea of an anti-world.) The act phase comprises three 
main types of imagining: "imaging" (that is, sensu-
ous displays of discrete objects and associated traits), 
"imagining-that" (wherein the specific content is a state 
of affairs, itself either sensuous or non-sensuous), and 
"imagining-how" (i.e., how to do something, wherein 
the imaginer is involved as agent, either in person or by 
proxy). Combinations are frequent: we imagine how to 
swim the crawl stroke by imagining that a certain state 
of affairs obtains- e.g., that the pool water is warm 
-
and in so doing we generate a number of images 
that illustrate or support what we are imagining. Other 
act-forms are possible but not explored in this book: 
e.g., imagining-as or imagining-with-respect-to. 
An eidetic analysis ofimagining reveals a set ofsix 
paired traits. Spontaneity and controlledness exhibit an 
exclusivist "option-necessity": each act of imagining 
arises either spontaneously -
unbidden, on its own 
accord- oras solicited by the imaginer, who controls 
its course more or less completely. By the same token, 
every aspect and phase of imagining is self-contained 
-
i.e., coheres without having to rely on modes of 
continuation or supplementation- and se(f-evident: it 
is as it presents itse(f, without needing any additional 
experience or history to complete it. Where the first two 
pairs obtain for both object- and act-phases of imag-
ining, the third pair holds only for the object phase. 
lndetenninacy signals the way that each imaginative 
presentation trails off into an a ura of indefiniteness, an 
intrinsic vagueness that belongs to it and is nota failing 
or sign of incompletion. Pure possibility indicates that 
the status ofwhat we imagine is neither necessary nor 
actual, but possible- and not just possible but purely 
possible, that is to say, only possible, without any im-
plication of impending or even potential development. 
It is to be noted that indeterminacy and pure possi-
bility, along with self-containment and self-evidence, 
are "trait-necessary" insofar as they characterize every 
feature of imagining without exception. 
Following a comparative assessment of perception 
and imagination, Casey's study concludes with an ex-
amination of imaginati ve autonomy in terms of "inde-
pendence" (of causality, context, use) and "freedom of 
mind." The role of such "thin autonomy'' in various 
activities and fields- especially psychology, philoso-
phy, and art- is then investigated. 
Both Casey and Sartre end their studies ofimagina-
tion by referring to the importance ofimagining in art, a 
theme that has been actively discussed ever since Kant 
-
followed by Schelling, Coleridge, and other Ro-
mantics- suspected that imagination is indispensable 
to the creation and enjoyment of art. ROMAN INGARDEN 
takes up this theme in detail in Das literarische Kunst-
werk (The literary work of art, 1931 ), describing how 
imagination fills in gaps and fteshes out details beyond 
the indefinite descriptions or schematic adumbrations 
offered in the bare words of the text, thus creating 
sensuously intuitive scenes in "imaginative modes of 
appearing" that exceed what the words explicitly indi-
cate. 
In Phimomenologie de l 'experience esthetique 
( 1953 ), MIKEL DUFRENNE builds on Ingarden 's model 
ofliterature as dependent on the active participati an of 
the reader, extending it to a general theory in AESTHET-
Ics. Yet the very activity singled out by Ingarden and 
attributed to imagination- i.e., the fiii ing in of inde-
terminacies and opacities- is excluded by Dufrenne 
as unnecessary, for in art "appearance says ali" and 
does not require imagination to specify it further into 
representational concreteness. What is required, how-
ever, is "feeling," which derives from a "sympathetic 
reftection" in which objects (the proper concern of 
imagination) are replaced by "quasi-subjects," while 
appearances become aspects of an expressed and ex-
pressive world. Thus imagination is at once surpassed 
and suppressed in the experience of art. 
In subsequent writings, Dufrenne introduces the 
idea of "great images" that mediate between humans 
and nature and the notion of an "imaginary in depth" 
that anchors us in, and attunes us to, the natural world. 
A similar turn is taken by Gaston Bachelard ( 1884-
1962), who distinguishes between a "formal imag-
ination" that concerns itself with the elegances and 
niceties of sheer form (whether in art or science) and a 
properly "material imagination" that has to do with the 
way the four ancient elements -
air, fire, earth, and 

344 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
water- sustain poetic imaginaries of many kinds. A 
material imagination aims notat building up and shap-
ing represented objects, but at following the intricate 
and subtle pathways into the material world as it is 
co-imagined by poets and readers alike. Thus poetic 
images, far from taking us into the ethereal and ir-
real, "resonate" with the materiality of the very world 
around us and bring to light its oneiric depth. 
Others have explored the importance of imagina-
tion in art, notably WOLFGANG ISER in Der Akte des 
Lesens (The act of reading, 1976)- which takes up 
the "image-character ofrepresentation" in READING in a 
discussion heavily indebted to Husserl, Ingarden, and 
Dufrenne- and BRUCF WILSIIIRF, who in Ro le P/aying 
and ldentity ( 1982) investigates the ro le of imagina-
tion in acting and theoretical experience more gener-
ally, emphasizing its bodily and physiognomic instan-
tiations. Wilshire, like Dufrenne, is sensitive to the 
restrictions of imagination in art -
it "carries limits 
and obstructions" -
but he underlines the way that 
imagination also brings a vision ofthe unlimited. 
The boundless resources of imagination are such 
that its creative and constitutive character cannot be 
limited to the domain of art. To trace out its import and 
impact in other areas is an unfinished task, but one that 
stil! beckons with much promise. How is imagination 
part ofsociallife? OfRELIGioN? Ofpolitical action? Of 
erotic encounter? Of ordinary thought and LANGUAGE? 
Of perception and memory? With these questions we 
not only retilrn to a point of origin in Husserl 's first 
investigations into the interplay between imagination 
and other acts of re-presentation and presentation, but 
also look forward to future descriptive work in direc-
tions yet uncharted.

the two. Any such relationship is obviously out of the 
question for classical Indian philosophy. Nevertheless, 
we can look for phenomenological elements in Indian 
thought. Only when we come to speak about recent and 
contemporary Indian philosophy does it make sense to 
ask if the phenomenological movement has had any 
impact. 
One should bear in mind, to begin with, that Indian 
philosophy is not a homogeneous body of doctrines, 
theorems, theories, and argumentations, but contains 
within it an enormous diversity of opposed, conflicting 
philosophies rang ing from Carvaka materialism at one 
extreme to the Advaita Vedanta monistic idealism at 
the other. Saying something in general about Indian 
philosophy is as risky as saying something in general 
about Western philosophy. But one of the mistakes 
committed by many Western thinkers -

vantly in the present context, by both EDMUND HUSSERL 
and MARTIN HEIDEGGER- is to ha ve heJd the view that 
"philosophy"- not the word, but the concept, the dis-
cipline- is Western in origin and consequently that to 
speak of "Indian philosophy" is to contradict oneself 
and to speak of "Western philosophy" is to indulge in 
a tautology. This point of view, which goes back in a 
way to HEGEL, is based on ignorance ofthe conceptual, 
discursive, and theoretical contcnt of Indian thought 
and is mistaken. 
For present purposes it will be taken for granted that 
the key concepts ofphenomenology are consciousness 
or subjectivity, EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION, and constitu-
tion. This will guide an exploration of the complex 
world of Indian thought for phenomenological ele-
ments. 
Phenomenology, especially in the transcendental 
form of CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY, centers around 
a specific understanding of the nature of conscious-
ness. According to this understanding, consciousness 
is intentiona], not in the pre-phcnomenological sense 
of relatedness to an abject in the world, but in the 
sense of being necessarily correlated to a MEANING or 
a NOEMA. AJong with this understanding of INTENTION-
ALITY, phenomenology, in its transcendental form, un-
derstands the abject, with its specific object-sense, as 
being constituted by intentionality through an overlap-
ping ofthe meanings that the various acts con fer. Hen ce 
we ha ve the doctrine of constitution of the WORLD in 
consciousness -
in the sense that only through con-
345 
sciousness does the world come to be presented, and 
also in the sense that ali meanings that the world con-
sists in, including thc meaning "world," have their ori-
gins in appropriate structures of consciousness. It is 
also an important component of this complex theory 
that consciousness is intrinsically temporal and that 
by virtue of its intrinsic TIME, it constitutes itself as a 
flux, constitutes its unity as an enduring ego, as well as 
unities of immanent acts as temporal entities: ali these 
constitutive accomplishments, including the temporal 
dimensions of past, present, and fu ture, ha ve their ori-
gin in the "living present" that becomes, for Husserl, 
the absolute consciousness. 
At first sight, this thesis of a world-constituting, 
transcendental, and absolute subjectivity seems very 
close, in spirit, to a recurrent theme in Indian -
es-
pecially, Vedantic -- thought. For Vedanta, especially 
in the non-dualistic formulation that Samkara gave it, 
the foundational reality, the principle of ali principles, 
that which underlies and makes possible ali cognition, 
is consciousness (cit)- in metaphysical jargon called 
Atman and Brahman. But when we look closer at this 
Vedanta thesis, we begin to realize the enormous dif-
ference that obtains between it and Husserl 's position. 
Most importantly, consciousness, in Vedanta, is self-
showing (svayamprakasa) and, like light, it shows ali 
objects, but it is not intrinsically intentiona!. Its inten-
tionality, being-of-this-or-that-object, is only a "super-
imposed" property. Philosophical wisdom would then 
consist in precisely seeing this point- intellectually 
as well as intuitively- that pure consciousness, freed 
from the empirica! constraints of body and world, is 
one, not many, universal, not individual, not differen-
tiated into mental states and with no intentiona! direct-
edness toward the world. Such a consciousness can 
be the foundation of experience, but cannot constitute 
it. The possibility of empirica! experience requires, be-
sides consciousness, a principle oflimitation -avidyă 
or ignorance- that projects the world of names and 
forms on the one consciousness. 
However, if phenomenology is also a description 
of experience, then what the Vedantists do may well 
claim to be so. While in their logica] and discursive 
work they advance arguments in fa vor of such a rad-
ical thesis, they also attempt to describe the different 
modalities of experience in order to demonstrate that 
cultivating or realizing such an undifferentiated, uni-

346 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
versa! consciousness, freed from aii intentionality, is 
within the range of human possibilities. A common 
strategy was to distinguish between four stages of con-
sciousness: waking, dream, dreamless sleep, and the 
"fourth" (the "transcendent," turiya), ofwhich the first 
three, in graded withdrawal from intentionality, are 
available to aii, while the Iast is available only to the 
wise in the so-called "mystical" experience. Naturally, 
philosophers had to justify the claim that dreamless 
sleep was a state of consciousness by drawing upon 
the premise that the judgment, on waking, that one 
slept well but knew nothing, was a memory-judgment. 
A similar descriptive psychology of the various 
modalities of consciousness, in much greater detail, 
is to be found in the Buddhist Iiterature, beginning 
with the well-known five elements (skandhas): rupa, 
vedanii, samjiiii, vijiliina, and samskiira (form, feeling, 
perception, mind, and impulses)- a Iist in which, it 
should be noted, mental consciousness is distinguished 
from sensory consciousness, perceptual consciousness, 
feelings, and volitions. Each ofthese is further divided 
into subordinate types, so that early BUDDHISM offers 
a rich description of mental states not rivaled by any 
other tradition. 
But we still do not have a transcendental constitu-
tive phenomenology. In some of its forms, Buddhism 
was phenomenalistic with regard to material objects, 
which were construed as "aggregates" ofsensory data. 
Likewise, the self as an "I" was shown to emerge out 
of the way these five types of states intertwine and 
interact with each other- the substantial EGO having 
been denied. Could we say that the "I" is constituted 
by interna! features of the flux of states of conscious-
ness? In any case, the technique -
psychophysical 
and voluntaristic -
that the Hindu and the Buddhist 
traditions developed, nurtured, and theoretically de-
fended, the technique of Yoga and meditation, may be 
said tobe meant to do what Husserl's epoche and re-
ductions were to do- i.e., to "purify" consciousness 
of presuppositions and presumptions, from Iiving in 
the naive world-belief (in the case of Buddhism, be-
Iief in substantial things and egos), and thereby tobe 
able to achieve, to intuitively experience, transcenden-
tal subjectivity. (Of classical phenomenologists, only 
MAX SCHELER and, following him, HELMUTH PLESSNER 
recognized this function of Yoga.) But the consequent 
deepening and purifying of consciousness is still far 
from theoretically-scientifically exhibiting the consti-
tution ofthe world in consciousness. 
One reason why, in spite of a metaphysics of tran-
scendental consciousness and a rich descriptive psy-
chology of the inner Iife, Indian thought does not 
eo ipso yield a transcendental constitutive phenomen-
ology is that the Indian theories did not quite come to 
subscribe to the sort of theory of meaning or sense-
as distinguished from reference- that seems to ha ve 
Ied Husserl to a theory of constitution (primarily of 
sen~e). lf constitution is, in the first place, constitution 
of sense (meaning, noema) and only secondarily -
inasmuch as a thing can be shown to be a noematic 
structure- constitution of things, we ha veto Iook for 
such a doctrine only in Buddhism. The Hindu theories 
of meaning were referential. 
From the perspective of Western phenomenology, 
Buddhism offers greater affinity, and this for two rea-
sons. In its theory of meaning, Buddhism, in aii its 
forms, tended to deny direct reference, and tended to 
regard the thing to which Ianguage claims to refer to 
be rather a conceptual construct (vikalpa). In a more 
developed form, the theory of meaning became "dif-
ferential": the word "man," for example, means what 
it does inasmuch as it serves to exclude nonhumans 
but does not positively denote aii men. The system of 
meanings becomes a system of differences, much like 
certain suggestions of Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-
1913) or JACQUES DERRIDA. AJong with this theory of 
meaning and consequent disavowal ofreference, Bud-
dhism- as contrasted with the Hin du philosophies-
understood consciousness to be a stream of events (of 
consciousing) rather than as states of a substance, and 
also as having a form or content (iikiira) of its own, 
as opposed to the generally accepted Hindu view that 
consciousness is formless or contentless (nirakara), 
what appears to be a content being really an object 
out there. Given these two conceptual resources, Bud-
dhism could arrive at the view that both the ego and the 
object are but constructs- shall we say constituted-
in the ongoing stream of consciousness. 
The only Hindu system that recognized the inherent 
intentionality of consciousness is Nyăya, but it used 
this to bolster its realistic ontology: every seeming 
content of consciousness, even the content of a non-
veridical perception, has its place in the world. 
Whereas classical Advaita Vedănta, as developed 

INDIA 
by Samkara, devalued the soov as an object (a-cit) in 
the world ~ 
not to be confused with consciousness 
(cit)~ there were tendencies within Indian thought 
and sometimes explicit doctrines, to counteract this 
tendency and to ascribe to the body a positive role in 
spiritual life. Body, in these !ater modes of thinking, 
was regarded not as a hindrance to freedom, but as 
capable of being cultivated as a means to freedom. 
Yoga is an important part ofthis mode ofthinking. 
It is in contemporary Indian thinking that the idea 
of bodily subjectivity ~ 
quite independently of any 
influence from Western thought ~ 
is rescued from its 
anonymity in classical Indian thought and brought to 
the forefront, first in the metaphysical system ofSri Au-
robindo, but most interestingly in K. c. BHATTACHARYA's 
philosophy. The latter's The Subjectas Freedom (1931) 
is possibly the major contribution of Indian thought to 
genuine phenomenology thus far. Bhattacharya gives 
an account of various levels of subjectivity, beginning 
with the bodily. Contrary to Western thinking, Bhat-
tacharya brings out how at each level consciousness 
claims to be free from its object. This freedom, the 
first idea of which comes from the body's standing 
apart from the world, is realized progressively through 
psychic or mental subjectivity, but finally in the spiri-
tual subjectivity. I must add that there are also impor-
tant phenomenological insights in the works of Kalidas 
Bhattacharya, K. C. Bhattacharya's son. 
In more recent times, .1. N. MOHANTY's researches 
on Husserl began with Edmund Husserl s Theory of 
Meaning (1964) and has continued in Husserl and 
Frege ( 1982) and The Possibility of Transcendental 
Philosophy ( 1985). His main concern has been with 
Husserl 's philosophy of LOGIC, theory ofmeaning, con-
cept of intentionality, and the nature of transcendental 
philosophy. In a numberof essays, he has also explored 
the presence in Indian thought of a phenomenological 
strand. o. SINHA has instituted a phenomenological in-
terpretation of Advaita Vedănta. MARGARET CHATTERJEE 
has attempted original phenomenological descriptions 
of musical and religious experiences. D.P. CHATTOPAD-
HYAYA 's fallibilistic epistemology and )ater turn to an 
open-ended transcendental philosophy have been un-
der the influence of Husserl 's thinking, although he has 
never been a strict Husserlian. KRISHNA ROY has written 
a comparative study of Hermeneutics: East and West 
( 1993 ). ANINDITA BALSLEV has interpreted Samkara's 
347 
theory of vivarta as a theory of constitution (as con-
trasted with "creation" and "real transformation"). J. 
L. MEHTA has drawn attention to the re1evance of Hei-
deggerian HERMENEUTICS for interpreting the Hindu sa-
cred scriptures. In a remarkable essay, KARL scHuH-
MANN has given us a picture of Husserl's changing 
understanding of Indian thought, from his early Halle 
years through the )ater Freiburg years. In 1988, a con-
ference on "Phenomenology and Indian Phi1osophy" 
was held in New Delhi (under the sponsorship of the 
Indian Council ofPhilosophical Research and the Cen-
ter for Advanced Research in Phenomenology, Inc.) in 
which some leading European, American, and Indian 
scholars participated. This conference brought to the 
attention of a larger audience the relevance (and lim-
its) of phenomenology for Indian philosophy, leading 
to intense debate on the issues.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ROMAN INGARDEN 
lngarden was born in 
Cracow on February 5, 1893. In 1911 he began his 
studies of philosophy in Lvov, where he attended lec-
tures by Kazimierz Twardowski (1866-1938), a dis-
ciple of FRANZ BRENTANO. In 1912 he continued his 
stuides at Gottingen under EDMUND HUSSERL (philoso-
phy), David Hi1bert ( 1862-1943) (mathematics), and 
George E. Milller (1850--1934) (psychology). He fol-
lowed Husserl to Freiburg im Breisgau, where in 1918 
he received his Ph.D. with lntuition und lntellect bei 
Henri Bergson as his dissertation. That same year he 
returned to Poland, where he began teaching mathe-
matics in high schools. He was at first isolated because 
of the domination of logically oriented philosophy in 
Poland, the so-called "Lvov-Warsaw school." In 1924 
he completed his habilitation under Twardowski with 
Essenziale Fragen. Ein Beitrag zum Problem des We-
sens (Essential questions. Contribution to the problem 
ofuniversals) and became Privatdozent at the Univer-
sity ofLvov, where he became Professor Extraordinar-
ius in 1933. He accepted the chair ofphilosophy at the 
Jagiellonian University at Cracow in 1945. Although 
he represented REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY, he was ac-
cused of "idealism" in the 1950s and suspended from 
teaching philosophy. He used this time to prepare a 
critica! translation ofKant's Kritik der reinen Vernunft 
into Polish. Ingarden regained his chair in 1956 and 
retired in 1963. His philosophical activity did not stop: 
he published new works and educated a new genera-
tion ofthinkers. Ingarden died in Cracow on June 29, 
1970. 
As with many other early phenomenologists, Ingar-
den was strongly influenced by Husserl 's program of 
phenomenological philosophy as a strict, eidetic sci-
ence. His doctoral dissertation as well as his Habil-
itationsschrift belong to epistemo1ogy, but his deep-
est concern was with AESTHETICS. This research, pub-
lished in 1931 as Das literarische Kunstwerk (The lit-
erary work of art), took him away from the transcen-
dental and idealistic turn that appeared in Husserl's 
thought with the publication ofhis Jdeen zu ei ner reinen 
Phiinomenologie und phănomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 (1913). 
His work on aesthetics is the best-known part ofln-
garden's philosophy. His investigations are of an onto-
logica] nature and the knowledge he gained decisively 
shaped his philosophical system. Taking the connec-
tion between the mode ofbeing and the formal structure 
of objects as his point of departure, Jngarden submits 
the work of art to a phenomenological-essential anal-
ysis. Through ontologica] analyses he distinguishes 
three different and reciprocally connected ontic strata 
in works of art: ( 1) the materia/fundament ofthe work 
of art (e.g., a painted canvas); (2) the work of art, 
a purely intentiona] and schematic product founded 
upon the material object; and (3) the aesthetic abject, 
a concretization of the work of art accomplished by a 
perceiver in the aesthetic attitude. 
A work of art exists for Ingarden neither as real 
nor ideal, but rather as purely intentiona] and hetero-
nomic. It owes its existence both to the creative acts of 
consciousness and to the physical ( ontic) fundament, 
which is independent of these acts. This existence is 
describable neither in psychological nor in physical 
terms. As an intentiona! object every work of art pos-
sesses its own identity and is intersubjectively identi-
fiable. 
The differentiation between the work of art and the 
aesthetic object is, for Ingarden, essential. A work of 
art becomes an aesthetic object through the concretiza-
tion brought about in the aesthetic attitude. Through 
transforming the work of art into a schematic prod-
uct, this concretization brings the perceiver into con-
tact with aesthetic qualities and values. A work of art 
readily becomes an intersubjective object, whereas an 
aesthetic object remains "monosubjective," accessible 
only to the perceiver who accomplishes the aesthetic 
concretization of the work. To o ne and the same work 
of art may belong many different aesthetic objects 
through which it itself appears. 
Because of the dissimilarities in the process of aes-
thetic experience evoked by different types of art, In-
garden did not create a typology of aesthetic expe-
riences and objects. He treated differences in expe-
riencing pictures, musical works, or literature as not 
essential but rather matters of degree within continua. 
From the aesthetic attitude, which is only proper for 
the perception of works of art, Ingarden distinguishes 
the attitude of an "aesthetic consumer" (a work of art as 
a source ofpleasure), which he considers tobe rather a 
matter of a practica! nature. He also includes a certain 
distance toward works ofart as a condition ofaesthetic 
experience (i.e., freeing oneself from involvement in 
everyday life). This distance does not mean a contem-

ROMAN INGARDEN 
349 
plati ve attitude. Ingarden always emphasizes the active 
ro le ofthe perceiver in the process of contact with art. 
For instance, the process of intercourse with the liter-
ary work of art begins with the acts of grasping the 
phonic/visual signs and other creations in LANGUAGE. 
This is the basis for seizing the MEANING, for seeing the 
given objects and actions in IMAGINATION, and for the 
acts of understanding. 
According to Ingarden, the process of aesthetic ex-
perience has short moments of passive contemplation 
besides the active phases. Although he considers emo-
tions and feelings to be a relevant component of aes-
thetic experience, he does not deny the presence of 
cognitive factors in it. 
The most essential function of art, for lngarden, is to 
enable the perceiver to ha ve direct intercourse with aes-
thetic VALUES. This function is realized through affect-
ing the "emotionallife." Excessively intense EMOTIONS 
of the perceiver can, however, be a hindering factor 
in the efficient course of aesthetic experience. Among 
the preconditions ofthis experience, Ingarden includes 
concentration ofattention on works ofart, self-control, 
and peace of mind. Only some of the emotions con-
nected with experiencing art are of an aesthetic nature. 
Aesthetic value is a polyphonic harmony of aes-
thetic qualities founded upon the aesthetic objects. The 
values are neither the features ofthe object, nor some-
thing created by the subject who experiences them. 
Aesthetic values are not the only ones that are con-
nected with works of art. According to Ingarden, there 
also exist values- he named them "artistics"- con-
nected with special "skills" or "efficiencies" of the 
work of art, which enable an efficient creation of the 
aesthetic attitude and its result- the aesthetic object. 
The artistic values are thereforc of an instrumental na-
ture. Both the aesthetic and the artistic values belong 
to the intentiona! object (including the aesthetic object 
and the work ofart). This does not mean, however, that 
they are the purely intentiona! beings themselves. 
The ontologica! analyses of works of art affected 
lngarden 's entire ontology. lts best elaboration is con-
tained in Spor o istnienie swiata (The controversy over 
the existence ofthe world, 1947-48). A being, i.e., an 
object, can be considered in three differentrespects: (1) 
the material one, (2) the formal one, and (3) the exis-
tential one (modes ofbeing). Ingarden understands on-
tology as based on eidetic insight and intuitive analyses 
of the contents of ideas, i.e., upon the EIDETIC METHOD, 
which enables o ne to discover the necessary and purely 
possible relations between the pure ideal qualities. On-
tology is for him the most general theory of objects. 
He distinguishes it from metaphysics, which fulfills the 
ro le of an applied theory of objects and which, being 
based on ontology, considers the nature and essence 
of factual beings. The eidetic character distinguishes 
metaphysics from the so-called real sciences. 
Ontology aims at obtaining a general spectrum of 
eidetic possibilities and necessities with reference to 
any objects whatever. In the frame of an existential 
ontology, which has nothing to do with MARTIN HEIDEG-
GER's FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY, lngarden distinguishes 
and clearly defines four mutually exclusive pairs of 
moments of being: something can be (1) existentially 
autonomous or heteronomous, (2) existentially original 
or derivative, (3) existentially separate or not separate, 
and (4) existentially self-dependent or contingent. Con-
siderations connected with the analysis of the second 
pair has led Ingarden to an original interpretation ofthe 
relation of causality. His analysis of time has brought 
some additional pairs of existential moments, such as 
actuality and non-actuality; persistence and fragility; 
and fissuration and non-fissuration. These differenti-
ations enables him to distinguish and describe four 
basic modes of being ( consisting of noncontradictory 
combinations of existential moments ). These are: ( 1) 
absolute being (autonomous, original, separate, self-
dependent); (2) temporal (real) being; (3) ideal (ex-
tratemporal) being; and (4) purely intentiona! (quasi-
temporal) being. We cannot experience any existing 
abject without its mode ofbeing. 
In epistemology Ingarden distinguishes: ( 1) the pure 
theory of knowledge, which is actually a part of ontol-
ogy, because he describes it as an a priori analysis of 
the general idea "knowledge"; (2) criteriology, which 
researches such epistemic values as objectivity and 
adequacy; and (3) the critique of knowledge, which 
evaluates factually obtained results of scientific and 
philosophical cognition. 
Ingarden perceived Husserl 's phenomenology as 
a mixture of epistemological, ontologica!, and meta-
physical problems. He reproached him for not realizing 
that he took these as well as many other assumptions 
for granted. According to lngarden, it ali led Husserl to 
an unnecessarily extreme idealistic position connected 

350 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
with a strongly epistemological point of view on phi-
losophy. Ingarden himself defined phenomenology as 
a science dealing with the contents of ideas of pure 
experience, and treated it as a part of ontology. 
The philosophy of lngarden is a development of 
phenomenology as a cognitive discipline. He tried to 
avoid what he considered the vicious circle of Husserl 's 
transcendental reduction (the transcendentality of our 
consciousness is at the same time the result and the 
assumption of the transcendental reduction) through 
eidetic analyses derived from the view that our ways of 
direct experience of objects within the world depend on 
the ontic structure of these objects. Every reconstruc-
tion of our knowledge must begin from an analysis of 
the nature ofthe objects ofthis knowledge.

INTENTIONALITY 
For EDMUND HUSSERL, "in-
tentionality" is the name of a problem more than a name 
for a specific philosophical theory or doctrine. Once 
the transcendental phenomenological EPOCHE bas been 
exercised, and the thematic scope of the transcenden-
tal phenomenological reduction determined, the prob-
lem largely concems the objectivation and reflective 
clarification ofthe sui generic characterization of con-
sciousness ( or: mentallife, or perhaps better, just life ), 
which, no matter what specific differences may be dis-
cemed conceming it, nonetheless can be said to "intend 
to" something (reviving in English the obsolete sense 
of the verb ta intend according to which, for exam-
ple, "to intend one 's eyes to something" signifies to 
look at something; we thus avoid, among other things, 
the strictly purposive connotation of the verb "to in-
tend," e.g., to do something). Accordingly, mental pro-
cesses ( or: life-processes), such as perceivings, judg-
ings, wishings, willings, desirings, valuings, thinkings, 
and the like, are called "intentiona) or intentive pro-
cesses" (sometimes: "intentiona! lived experiences") 
or simply "intendings." In the older terminology of 
Husserl, but still occasionally found in !ater writings, 
intendings are also called "noeses," and what is in-
tended to as intended ta (or: what is intended as such) 
is called the "noematic sense ofthe noesis," or simply 
the "noema." The NOEMA is what is intended to, just 
and precisely ( or: "purely") as it is intended to in the 
noesis or intending to it. 
Yet another verb commonly used for "to intend" 
is the verb "to mean" (meinen). A mental process, 
any mental process, means something as something 
in being aware of it. The "something meant" is often 
called by Husserl a "sense," and sometimes an "ob-
jective sense." The word "sense," and allied words, 
emphasize the fact that the world and things in it and 
affairs exemplified by those things are not causally re-

lated to the awareness of them (although this is by no 
means to exclude the causally related as an object of 
consciousness). The word "sense" then serves as ater-
minological safeguard against confusing, for instance, 
perceiving as "transcendental" and as related in this 
perceiving to something perceived just and precisely 
as perceived, on the one hand, with the same process of 
perceiving considered as an event in the world standing 
in ( e.g., causal) relation to another event in the world, 
the perceived, on the other hand. An easy example of 
an "objective sense" is a verbal signification. The sig-
nification ofthe word "dog" is not the letters, "d," "o," 
"g"; nor does it consist of the marks "d," "o," "g." It 
is equally well expressed by the word "perro" or the 
word "Hund." The signification is rather something 
"ideal," not real as are the marks or sounds making 
up the word. The signification is an "objective sense" 
presented as it itself in an act of meaning, specifically 
verbal meaning. But verbal meaning is, after ali, only 
one kind of MEANING. 
There are, in addition, perceptual meanings with 
perceptual "objective senses," the perceived just and 
precisely as meant and, e.g., seen, or tasted, or sniffed, 
or heard. For example, 1 see a tree in the back yard. In 
seeing the tree, I distinguish, on the one hand, the see-
ing as really going on over a period oftime and, on the 
other hand, the tree presented as "it itself' in the mean-
ing and seeing of it. The seeing is a perceptual meaning 
of the tree as tree. Other cases of perceptual meaning 
would be olfactory meanings, tactual meanings, au-
ditory meanings. I might even go on to examine yet 
other meanings: rememberings (mnemonic meanings) 
of trees seen, judicative meanings (judgings of judg-
ments about trees), valuings of trees, and so forth. In 
any case, in our example, the seeing confronts me with 
a tree in definite although, as Husserl says, one-sided 
ways: from this rather than that side, straight before 
me, or occupying a lateral position near me, perchance 
far from me. Moreover, the tree is presented in and 
through the seeing of it with certa in prospects, such as 
casting shadows at certain times during the day, or as 
giving shade, or even as motivating the remembrance 
of the same tree I had seen before. Throughout ali the 
seeings the tree is presented and meant as the "same, 
real tree" just asI see it and believe in it as existing. 
The real thing, the tree, can only present itself ow-
ing to meanings belonging to a series of seeings, one 
perhaps following upon others. The seen tree is meant 
as "one and the same" over against the stream of the 
flowing multiplicity of seeings in and through which 
it is presented. The tree appears in my seeing of it 
as a meant and believed in identity, as identically the 
same. Were the tree not meant as identically the same, 
it would disappear with the multiplicity of seeings of it. 
Accordingly, it may be said that the "objective sense" 
of seeing and meaning the tree is "atemporal," hence 
"ideal" in much the way in which a verbal signification 
is "ideal." There is something meant as meant, identi-
ca! as meant, which, for this very reason, should not be 
confused with the succeeding and successive multiplic-
ity of seeings of the tree. Meantness as meant, the tree 
purely and precisely as meant, is "irreal," Husserl says, 
and its "irreality" consists of its atemporality; "TIME," 
then, is a necessary but not a suffi.cient condition for 
intentionality. 
Thus the multiplicity of seeings and their "noematic 
correlate," their sense, are mutually correlative, but 
also equally, as well as mutually, irreducible one to the 
other. The "real" and the "ideal" are then not opposite; 
they are not tobe confused; they are irreducible correla-
tives that mutually "imply" one another, are intimately 
and intentively bound up with one another. There is 
a "transcendental idealism" only by virtue of a "tran-
scendental realism," and conversely. (Husserl never 
denied a "transcendental realism," although he never 
seems to ha ve worked it out as he did a "transcendental 
idealism.") In still other words, there is something in 
and for itself only insofar as it is for me; and there is, 
conversely, something for me only insofar as it is in 
and for itself, just and precisely as intended to. 
Husserl attributed to FRANZ BRENTANO the discovery 
of intentionality, although he immediately transformed 
"intentionality" to signify a state of affairs radically 
distinct from what it signified for Brentano. Thus even 
though a term in common, "intentionality" conceals 
profound differences between them. In the first place, 
there is no transcendental-phenomenological epoche in 
Brentano in consequence ofwhich intentionality arises 
as a problem. In the second place, Brentano speaks, as 
Husserl never did, always and only ofthe "intentiona! 
relation" or "reference" that a single mental process 
has to its intentiona! or mental object- an object "not 
to be understood as real," Brentano says; single pro-
cesses, or acts of consciousness, are distinguished from 

352 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
each other in that each has a different intentiona! ob-
ject. Thus as LUDWIG LANDGREBE pointed out, the idea 
that two or more acts, descriptively different from one 
another, can have the same objective sense is alien 
to Brentano. Another difference between Husserl and 
Brentano is that for Husserl, the object intended to, 
the object meant, does not refer to a hypothetically 
assumed non-phenomenal real world that determines 
the order ofphenomena. Thus for Husserl whatever is 
intended to does not have what Brentano calls "inten-
tiona! inexistence"; what is intended to is, for Husserl, 
not numerically distinct from "the" object: the tree seen 
and meant in the seeing of it is indeed the "real" tree, 
"the" object, tree; it is this tree, just and precisely as 
seen. That the tree is intended to in my seeing of it does 
not mean the "the tree" is not what I see when I see the 
tree, ifthe tree exists. AII that terms such as "objective 
sense," "intentiona! object," and the like signify is that 
there is intentionality of a particular or specific kind-
a tree-seeing rather than a house-seeing. 
Finally, Brentano does not distinguish, as does 
Husserl, between everyday, public things and "sense 
data"; for Husserl we have to distinguish between the 
public tree and the private "sensations" we experi-
ence when we see a public tree. (Husserl's attempt 
to clarify the distinction is probably as unsatisfactory 
as Brentano's failure to make it; Husserl eventually in-
troduces the concept of"hyletic data," a non-intentive 
facet of intentionality, to do so. On the other hand, 
the attempt to clarify the distinction eventually Ieads 
to various formulations ofthe central idea ofthe LIFE-
WORLD.) "Intentiona! object," "objective sense," and 
Iike terms do not, then, signify a second object in some 
sense or other as "in the mind" and distinct from yet 
other objects; it is in no sense a "content" ofthe mind, 
although Husserl 's Ianguage, especially in his earlier 
writings, can be misleading ( e.g., as when he speaks of 
"primary contents"). 
lntention(l/ (l!lalysis involves two Iines of inquiry: 
a "noetic line" and a "noematic line." They are "lines" 
only because the making thematic and description of 
the o ne is always at Ieast implicitly the making thematic 
and description ofthe other. 
The noetic line of inquiry. In his writings, Husserl 
distinguishes at least three basic modes of intend-
ing: ( 1) simple believings, disbelievings, and doubt-
ings ("doxic intendings"); (2) intendings that are af-
fective, emotional, valuing modes ofintendings ("non-
doxic intendings"); and (3) intendings that are will-
ings and strivings ("conative intendings"). Addition-
ally, Husserl describes a "neutrality modification" that 
cuts across the three modes: neither disbelieving, be-
Iieving, or doubting, or emotional apathy, or conative 
obtuseness. We also have to mention that intentional-
ity, any intending, includes "horizonal intendings"-
in any particular intending, the object intended to can 
also be the object of other actual and possible intend-
ings of specific kinds. For example, I see the tree; the 
tree is seen as the object of other possible seeings (from 
close by, from another side, under these and those as-
pects). In seeing the tree, moreover, the tree is also 
meant as the object of possible tactual perceivings as 
well as something about which a judgment might be 
made oras something that may be willed the habitat of 
the village smithy. 1 mean the tree notjust as the abject 
or sense of other possible intendings, but also as some-
thing intendable to by others: it is "co-presented with 
the horizon" of being intended to by others than my-
self intending to the same tree, eventually to the same 
world. The noetic line of analysis consists Iargely of 
describing and making explicit co-intended actual and 
possible intendings. 
Intendings are said by Husserl to be either "evi-
dent" or "non-evident." (The term EVIDENCE [Evidenz] 
has a signification quite distinct from that expressed 
by the termin Anglo-American philosophy.) "Evident 
intendings" are also said by Husserl to be "experienc-
ings" in either a broad or a narrow sense. In the broad 
sense, "experiencing" is synonymous with "evidence 
in general," and in the narrow sense "experiencing" is 
synonymous with "evidence" ofsomething real as op-
posed to something ideal (where by "real" we signify 
something having its own Iocus in SPACE and TIME). 
As a rule, Husserl uses the term "empirica!" to des-
ignate experiencing in the narrow sense ("empirica!" 
is then not the opposite of "pure" or "transcendental" 
as in KANT). "Evident intendings" are those in which 
what is intended to shows itself as it itself; it is that 
intending in which something is a "phenomenon" in 
the broadest proper sense. According to Husserl, there 
are evident intendings not only to real things, but also 
to ideal things ( e.g., "universals," "eidetic singulari-
ties," and the Iike) intended to and presented as they 
themselves. Quite universally, Husserl says, things are 

JNTENTIONALITY 
353 
intended to as being of generic and specific kinds, and 
another task of intentiona) analysis is to describe and 
make explicit these intendings with respect to the de-
terminations that they must ha ve in order tobe possible 
examples of generic and specific kinds. 
Intendings are further characterized by being "lived 
or engaged in" by an EGO; such intendings are called 
"actiona) intendings," or just "acts." Not ali intendings 
are acts, many are not lived in at ali by the ego (hence 
are "non-actional''), and indeed in principle some can-
not be lived in by an ego ( e.g., retentions and pro-
tentions that comprise the stream of intendings, which 
in later terminology are said to proceed in "primary 
passivity"). In actiona) intendings, the ego is said to 
be "busied" with the "what" that is intended to in in-
tendings- the intendings are strictly the ego's own 
intendings to what is intended to. The ego, however, 
is not a really inherent part of any actiona) intending; 
what may be said tobe inherent is the "quality" ofbe-
ing Iived in by the ego, and it is this "quality" ofbeing 
lived in by the ego that is the phenomenological datum. 
The ego is not a content of the stream of intendings, 
nor a content of any intending. 
A basic feature of intentionality is synthesis, which 
for Husserl is that mode of combination, connection, 
or confirmation exclusively peculiar to intendings. It 
is that which gives unity to intendings so that each in-
tending is in itself a synthetic whole and each whole 
is combined with others (e.g., where a seeing is com-
bined with a remembering of the seeing). Synthesis 
is operative throughout a multiplicity of modes of ap-
pearances, for instance, visual, tactual, and auditory. 
Nonnally, Husserl says, 1 look "through" the appear-
ances and perceive the underlying shape or color of 
the world. The point is that the continuous sequence 
of appearances is connected synthetically, the appear-
ances characterized as "adumbrations" ofthe things or 
affairs in question. A fundamental form of synthesis 
is the "synthesis of identification" by virtue of which 
one and the same intentiona) object is meant and in-
tended to (e.g., seen) just and precisely as one and the 
same. For example, ali the while the seeing ofthe tree 
is proceeding, there is a continuous identifying and 
distinguishing of earlier phases of seeings throughout 
the )ater course of consciousness, or there is a contin-
uous identifying and distinguishing of physical things 
as selfsame and numerically distinct from other things 
(tree, garden, vulture in the tree) throughout the course 
of seeing or remembering. A phase of one 's mentallife 
or consciousness is continuously intended to as iden-
tica) throughout a multiplicity of changing temporal 
appearances as it recedes into the past. Or a physical 
thing, such as a tree, may be perceived or remembered 
as identica) and perhaps as unchanging throughout a 
multiplicity of changing spatial appearances (near, far, 
left or right). Another kind ofsynthesis is that of"asso-
ciation," to which identifying and distinguishing syn-
thesis is basic. 
As in the case ofidentifying and numerically differ-
entiating synthesis, where something is both intended 
to and meant as the same and as numerically distinct 
from something else, "associative synthesis" can be 
actiona) or passive. For example, two or more affairs 
are meant and intended to each as selfsame and, si-
multaneously, as not identica) with each other, as nu-
merically distinct. They are then not meant and in-
tended to merely as not identica) with each other, but, 
e.g., as more or less similar and more or Iess differ-
ent from each other, perhaps absolutely Iike or even 
unlike. Involved here is what Husserl calls a "transfer 
of sense." For example, suppose that simultaneously 
a round shape is itself presented as here and a round 
shape is itself presented as there. "Founded" on this 
presentation is an "associative transfer of sense," so 
that the transferred sense "round" and the presented 
sense "round" establish or "found" a synthesis of per-
fect likeness in shape. The transfer of sense is always 
mutual, and each ofthe two things is perceived as alike 
in shape: an associative synthesis. Other kinds of syn-
thesis that Husserl studies in various connections and 
with respect to a wide variety of philosophical prob-
lems are the synthesis of fulfillment (or verification), 
the synthesis of continuity and discontinuity, the syn-
thesis of annulment, and the synthesis of clarification. 
For Husserl, synthesis is not limited, as in Kant, to 
thinkings and judgings, but characterizes ali cases of 
intentionality. 
The noematic line of inquiry. In any "act" of in-
tentionality the ego is busy with something as having 
determinations of one or another kind; the act has its 
"objective sense." Something can be something, no 
matter what. But the something in question may very 
well have a highly determinate objective sense, may 
appear as it itselfin a very clearly defined manner. The 

354 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
clearly defined manner is ca !led the "what of the in-
tentiona! abject." By the term "what" Husserl is not 
referring to the species of something; instead, he is 
speaking of the determinations something is meant as 
having -
its being round, obnoxious, sweet-tasting, 
large or small, and so on. The term "objective sense" 
is often ambiguous in Husserl 's writings. Frequently 
it signifies the "what" of an intentiona! abject, the de-
terminations the abject is meant and intended to as 
having, rather than the act of intending. Here we can 
observe a relativity characteristic of intentionality -
to take an example from Husserl, Napoleon as victor 
at Jena and Napoleon as vanquished at Waterloo. In 
these differing cases of intentionality, Napoleon is in-
tended to as identica!, as the same intentiona! abject, 
but with differing objective senses- "victor at Jena," 
"vanquished at Waterloo." 
The intentiona! abject can be meant and intended to 
as having the same objective sense in acts that differnot 
only in kind, but also in terms of modes of givenness, 
of how the intentiona! abject is given or presented. 
In one case, there may be a perceptual mode of pre-
sentation or givenness, and in another there may be 
a memorial mode of presentation -
taking the term 
"presentation" ( or: "givenness") broadly enough to in-
clude non-presentation, "empty givenness." In addi-
tion, there may be further differences tobe investigated 
in modes of presentation themselves ( clear, obscure). 
Finally, there is, besides the "what" and "how" of 
the noema, its "thus-and-so." An act of simply believ-
ing in something is said to "pasit" its intentiona! abject 
as having an objective sense presented in this or that 
manner. The intentiona! abject posited with the objec-
tive sense may be made thematic in further reflection, 
and likewise the posited ( or: positional) characteris-
tic (sometimes: the "thesis," "doxic thesis," or "thetic 
characteristic"; in Logische Untersuchungen [1900-
1901 ], "qua1ity" or "belief-character") may be made 
thematic, or objectivated. The positional characteris-
tic of an abject may be, for instance, the existence 
( or nonexistence) of the abject; that is, the abject, we 
may also say, is believed in as existing or nonexisting. 
When objectivated, being or nonbeing are made the-
matic. Husserl also distinguishes a "non-doxic" pasit-
ing, e.g., when I like something, it is posited as good 
( or if I dislike something, as bad). When objectivated, 
goodness or badness are made thematic. But in neither 
case should posited characteristics be confused with 
the objective sense; they are not part of the objective 
sense ofthe intentiona! abject. Being and goodness are 
not "predicates." 
It should be added that doubting and disbelieving are 
said to be modifications of simple believing or pasit-
ing. If a simple believing in something as existing. 
for instance, undergoes modification into a disbeliev-
ing, there is a correlative alteration in the positional 
characteristic from existence to nonexistence. We say 
"simple" believing in this case because there are more 
complex cases ofbelieving, such as confirmatory acts 
in which something is verified as indeed existent ( or 
nonexistent). Or there are cases in which a simple be-
lieving proves to be not just prima facie confirmati an, 
but fully justified believing. Although the positional 
characteristic is not part of the objective sense of the 
abject as intended to, stil! together with the other com-
ponents it makes up the "thesis" ofthe act ofintending. 
However, if 1 am busied with seeing something, striv-
ing to make that something explicit in its "what" and 
"how," this is not ipso facto to make the positional 
characteristic thematic; this occurs only if there is a 
busiedness with this "being busied with the seen be-
lieved in as existing in the seeing of it." 
When the positiona1 characteristic is objectivated, 
there is a new act and a new positional characteristic 
with the previous positional characteristic as the objec-
tive sense. The distinction is an important one because 
it signifies that for every positional characteristic, there 
is always a possible ( doxic) objectivation. Thus ( doxic) 
positionality covers the whole realm of intentionality, 
"rational," "affective," and "practica!." But because 
objectivating the "what" and "how" is not ipso facto 
objectivating the positional characteristic, the pheno-
menologica1 concreti an ofhow/what/thus-and-so is not 
objectivatable, thematizable, as a concretion. 
This distinction has a significant consequence. Be-
cause what and how something is meant and intended 
to can be objectivated or made thematic in part or 
who1e without at the same time making its thus-and-
so thematic, the what and how of something comprise 
only a necessary, but never a sufficient condition for 
the existence ofthe meant and intended-to. Conversely, 
because it is only in a separate and further act that the 
thus-and-so is objectivated, it follows that existence is 
only a necessary, but never a sufficient condition for 

INTERSUBJECTIVITY 
355 
what and how something is meant and intended to. 
Accordingly, we distinguish ( 1) the noematic core 
comprising modes of givenness of the perceived, 
judged, liked, etc., along with the objective sense(s) 
of the intentiona! object, correlative to the noe tic core 
comprising the various intendings and meanings (per-
ceivings, judgings, thinkings, likings, conations), in 
some of which the ego lives and is busied in one or 
another way with the intentiona! object, as well as 
those intentive processes in which the ego has lived 
or in principle cannot live; and (2) the noematic mo-
ments comprising positional characteristics ( existence, 
goodness, beauty, etc.), correlative to noetic moments 
comprising positings (such as believings, assumings, 
presumings, doubtings, etc.). 
Note that in Logische Untersuchungen "content" 
consists of the noematic core, and "belief-quality" 
( or just "quality") consists of the noematic core 
plus the noematic moments; "material" consists of 
the noematic core and the modes of givenness. The 
1anguage of noesis and noema is drawn chiefiy 
from ldeen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 (1913). 
Intentionality turns out to be not only synthetic in 
various ways, but also high1y stratified in structure, and 
part of the problem of intentiona1ity consists in clari-
fying that structure and the "founding-founded" rela-
tions among the stratifi.cations, especially as they have 
a bearing on a diverse set ofproblems in LOGIC, MATHE-
MATICS, ONTOLOGY, PERCEPTION, and VALUE THEORY. fre-
quent]y those philosophica1 problems defi.ne the scope 
ofthe intentiona! ana1ysis tobe carried out. Many times 
in returning to a given set of philosophical problems, 
Husserl found it necessary to redefi.ne and correct pre-
vious analyses of specific cases of intentionality, some-
times seeking new ways of describing this sui generic 
feature of life. Husserl 's infiuence in this respect has 
been continuous and wide-ranging, from the question-
ing by MARTIN HEIDEGGER of the sui generic status of 
intentionality, to the adaptation of intentionality to the 
EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY of, e.g., JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, 
to the development and broadening of Husserl's own 
intentiona! analyses of the BODY and embodied life in 
the wor]d by MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, to the search for 
the in ner principles of organization of intentionality by 
ARON GURWITSCH. Others in ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY have 
found it necessary to modify Husserl's accounts of 
intentionality in order to deal with other sets of philo-
sophical prob]ems (John Searle, RODERICK CHISHOLM). 
And while some phenomenologists have sought the 
limits of intentiona! analysis (ALFRED scHUTZ), others 
have extended it to areas indicated by Husserl, but not 
extensively analyzed by him (the fi.eld of AESTllFTICS 
by ROMAN INGARDEN, experience of the ho]y by GERDA 
WALTHER, and ETHICS by MAX SCHELER).

INTERSUBJECTIVITY 
In EDMUND HUSSERL 's 
phenomenology "intersubjectivity" is not a title for a 
systematic, self-contained theme. Rather, in various 
thematic spheres intersubjective problems arise that 
are nevertheless connected with one another and have 
solutions that mutually condition one another. Even 
the primary method of Husserl's phenomenology, the 
EPOCHE AND REDUCTION to pure consciousness, has its 
intersubjective aspect. Furthermore, the distinction be-
tween one's own and another's consciousness, or be-

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
tween o ne 's own conscious "world" and that of another 
is an intersubjective problem. As regards the analysis 
ofthe constitution of different kinds of objects in con-
sciousness, there are on the one hand, intersubjective 
problems in a special sense: the experience of the body 
of another, the experience ofthe psychic experiences of 
another, and social communication. On the other hand, 
ali problems of constitution ha ve an intersubjective as-
pect: the constitution of objective TIME, of objective 
SPACE, of o ne 's own BODY, of o ne 's own person. and 
the natural and sociocultural WORLD. Intersubjectivity 
also plays a fundamental ro le in questions that arise in 
the theory of science, as in the distinction between the 
NATURAL and li UMAN SCIENCES, or that between the natu-
ra]istic and the personalistic attitudes. Finally, intersub-
jectivity occupies a central position in Husserl 's ETHICS 
and monadological ontology. Intersubjectivity there-
fore encompasses the whole of phenomenology, and 
a complete phenomenology of intersubjectivity would 
bea complete phenomenology in general. 
Even in his early years Husserl saw himself con-
fronted with problems of intersubjectivity and occu-
pied himselfmore and more with such problems in the 
course of his development. Already in the first of the 
Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900--1901 ), he spoke of 
the communicative function of linguistic expressions. 
He considered this function as the "announcement" of 
psychic experiences through "signs" (Anzeichen ), oras 
a perceptual understanding ofthese "signs" on the basis 
of associations. However, in the further course of the 
Untersuchungen he did not take these communicative 
functions of expressions in LANGUAGE into considera-
tion. The problem of intersubjectivity was not really 
important for Husserl un tii the years 1905 to 1907, 
when he methodologically defined his phenomenology 
as a specific research area through the epoche and re-
duction to pure consciousness. At that time he found 
himself in a dilemma: on the o ne hand, he ciung philo-
sophically to the idea of a multiplicity of conscious 
subjects, and, on the other hand, he saw himselflimited, 
by the form of the reduction he was operating with at 
that time, to a single pure consciousness (o ne pure flow 
of consciousness). He solved this dilemma in the lec-
tures on "Grundprobleme der Phănomenologie" (Basic 
problems of phenomenology, 191 O) by extending the 
phenomenological epoche and reduction to intersub-
jectivity, i.e., by also apprehending as pure phenomena 
of consciousness the experiences of others who are re-
presented to one through empathy, do ing this by means 
of the second step of a "double reduction." 
In this time between 1905 and 191 O, he also began to 
analyze the structure of empathy. He did this above ali 
in discussions with Theodor Lipps (1851-1914). He 
borrowed the word "empathy" (Einfiihlung) as well 
as the rejection ofthe analogy-inference theory for the 
experience of other persons from Lipps. But he rejected 
Lipps's own theory of empathy (instinctive projection 
of o ne 's own experiences into an externa! body) and he 
also selected another way of fonnulating the problem: 
in his theory of empathy Lipps had started out from 
the so-called "expressive movements" (for example of 
joy, anger, anxiety). Husserl instead asked first how 
we apprehend o uter bodies as sens ing ( endowed with 
sensations ). 
Also, in the discussion of empathy in the texts 
that were published after Husserl 's death as ldeen zu 
ei ner reinen Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologische 
Philosophie Il [ 1912-15], he started from the co-
perception of fields of sensation (the "aesthesiologi-
cal level") localized in the body of another. He had 
concerned himself with the problem of empathy in 
grea! detail probably in August or September 1915. 
At that time Husserl gained a new way of approach-
ing the problem of empathy: he came to the insights 
that no fields of sensation can be empathically expe-
rienced immediately in a body that is externally per-
ceived, and that this happens only insofar as the outer 
body becomes experienced as a living body fhr the 
other through the RE-PRESENTATION of that alien point 
of view. Thus, in these texts from 1915, he discussed 
above ali the problem of how the presentation of a 
conscious subject in space comes about, and he saw 
the re-presentation of the other subject as made pos-
sible by the outer re-presentation of oneself (phantasy 
of oneself in an externa] place in space ). However, he 
!ater rejected this attempt as "too constructive." 
Also very important for Husserl 's theory of empathy 
were the lectures "Einfiihrung in die Phănomenologie" 
(lntroduction to phenomenology, 1926/27). Here he 
solved the problem ofthe similarity between one's own 
body and the body ofanother (the similarity is the basis 
of empathy) by the immediately constituted correspon-
dence between perceived externa! spatial fonns, on the 
one hand, and kinaesthetically perceived movements 

INTERSUBJECTIVITY

of one's own body, on the other. With this, phantasy 
presentation of o ne 's own body in an o uter spatial form 
was no Ion ger the condition for empathy. In the fifth of 
the Cartesianische Meditationen [ 1931] Husserl gave 
a summary overview of his theory of intersubjectiv-
ity. But he left many earlier insights out of it (above ali 
those from the lectures of 1926/27). Also, he came back 
aga in and aga in to the problems of intersubjectivity in 
texts after 1930. 
After this short historical survey some themes from 
Husserl 's phenomenology of intersubjectivity will be 
discussed in a systematic way. 
In the fifth of the Cartesianische Meditationen and 
in other texts devoted to the problem of our experi-
ence of the other ( consciousness of another subject), 
Husserl starts with a special kind of "reduction" or 
thematic epoche: he confines himselfto an EGo's own 
consciousness and, within this limited transcendental 
sphere, analyzes the motivations and the context of ex-
periences in which the other comes tobe indicated. But 
this limited sphere, called "sphere of ownness" or "pri-
mordinal sphere," has two different meanings or scopes 
that are very often intermingled ( e.g., in the Fifth Med-
itation ). In the first sense, it is a sphere of solipsistic 
experiences that are the motivational base forthe empa-
thy of other consciousnesses and thcir intentiona! cor-
relates (their objects). This basic sphere is a sphere of 
originally given or immediately perceived objects and 
also comprehends spatial things, such as the physical 
bodies of others, and a psychophysical reality, namely 
the lived body or own-body. These immediately expe-
rienced objects ha ve no intersubjective meaning on this 
level, and the question is how, in this sphere of directly 
(immediately) perceived objects, "empathy" or "un-
derstanding" ofnot directly perceived and not directly 
perceivable objects (i.e., others' consciousnesses and 
their intentiona! objects) is motivated and confirmed in 
the further course of experience. In the second sense, 
the sphere of ownness or primordinal sphere also in-
cludes the ego 's own acts of empathy or comprehension 
because these acts are also originally or directly given. 
In this sense, the sphere of ownncss or primordinal 
sphere is defined by the originally or directly given, 
but it makes no sense to say that it functions as the mo-
tivational base for empathy, because empathies as my 
own acts are included in this sphere. But not included 
in this sphere are the intentiona! correlates, ( objects) of 
these acts of empathy, i.e., other subjects (conscious-
nesses) and their intentiona! correlates because other 
consciousnesses are never directly or originally per-
ceived, but only indicated (appresented) by means of 
directly perceived things. Thus, here the accent is on 
the best "originality" conceivable (rather than on the 
reduction to a "solo" sphere prior to empathy). This 
second sense of "sphere of ownness" or "primordi-
nal sphere" defines what Husserl calls a monad or a 
monadic EGO. Although it is a very important and fruit-
ful concept, it designates an abstract, i.e., a not sepa-
rately existing reality because, according to Husserl's 
own theory, an intentiona! act, e.g., empathy, is not 
separable from its intentiona! correlate, e.g., another 
person 's consciousness and his or her intentiona! cor-
relates. 
Empathy ( experience ofthe other). The primary mo-
tivational foundation of empathy is the perceptual sim-
ilarity between my own body and an externally per-
ceived body inside the primordinal sphere (in the first 
sense). This similarity is less a similarity between two 
externa! spatial forms than an immediately fel! corre-
spondence between the kinesthetically perceived inten-
tiona! movements of the own-body, on the one hand, 
and the outwardly perceived movements and positions 
of an externa! body, on the other hand. This similarity 
motivates an apperceptive transfer in which the exter-
na! body is apprehended in analogy with the own-body 
as a sensing and perceiving body. This apperceptive 
transfer is not a discursive act of thinking or a logica! 
inference, but occurs in o ne glance just as, without rec-
ollection and comparison, we transfer to the objects of 
our ordinary perception the sense that similar objects 
ha ve acquired for us in former experiences. 
But therc are two important differences between 
this ordinary apperceptive transfer and the appercep-
tive transfer of sense from my own body to a similar 
externa! body. First, in this latter transference, the orig-
inal object, i.e., my own body, from which the sense is 
transferred, is always perceptually present. So the own 
and the similar externa! body appear perceptually as a 
pair and the transfer ofsense is perfonned in the special 
fonn of an "association by pai ring" (Paarungsasso::.i-
ation). Second, in this transference of sense the other 
sensing and perceiving body is not apprehended sim-
ply as a duplicate of my actual bodily self, but as a 
different "point of view," i.e., as the point of view 1 

358 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
would have ifl were not here where 1 actually am, but 
there, in the situation ofthe other body. In other words, 
this associative transfer of sense is not immediate but 
mediated by my re-presentation ( Vergegenwiirtigung) 
of an actual "point of view" 1 actually do not ha ve. 
A further question is how the transferred sense, i.e., 
the appresentation of the psychic si de of the externa! 
body, can possibly be confinned in experience and why 
it is not simply annulled by the fact that it can never be 
immediately perceived by me. Basically, this confirma-
tion is made possible by the fact that the immediately 
perceived externa! body and its appresented psychic 
side stand, in my empathic experience, in a tempo-
rally continuous nexus of reciproca! motivations: the 
now perceived externa! body motivates (indicates, ex-
presses) by its perceivable form and behavior a psychic 
side, and this not perceivable psychic side motivates 
(requires as its expression) a further continuation in my 
expectation ofthe perceivable behavior ofthe externa! 
body. If such further behavior is in fact perceived by 
me, it confinns my former motivating appresentation 
ofthe psychic side and may again motivate (indicate) 
some other contents on the appresented psychic side 
that in their turn motivate (require) in my expectation 
some further mode ofperceptible behavior, and so on. 
There are also other styles of confirmation of empathy. 
Further problems in this line concern the awareness 
of an intersubjective objectivity (the same intentiona! 
objects in mine and the other's consciousness) and, 
finally, of a common world. 
Authentic and inauthentic empathy ( eigentliche und 
uneigentliche Ein(iihlung). Husserl distinguishes be-
tween these two modes of empathy mainly for the 
purpose of distinguishing between the naturalistic and 
personalistic exploration of the human being. In our 
inauthentic understanding ofthe other, only that which 
pertains to his or her externally perceivable body is pre-
sented in intuition, while his or her consciousness (the 
psychic) is but emptily (not intuitively) appresented 
by associative induction or empty indication. In other 
words, in this empty understanding I consider the other 
only from the outside intuitively and do not re-present 
intuitively his or her situation from his or her own point 
of view ("from the inside"). This inauthentic experi-
ence ofthe other indicates a special attitude toward him 
or her and is the foundation for the consideration ofhu-
man and other conscious beings from the standpoint of 
the natural sciences. From this standpoint the psychic 
may be erroneously interpreted as a mere annex ofthe 
physiological. 
In our authentic experience of the other, which 
Husserl also designates as "absolutely empathizing 
cognizance" (absolute ein(iihlende Kenntnisnahme), I 
li ve as if I were within the other by intuitively trans-
posing myself (hineinversetzen, hineinversenken, ein-
leben) into the motivations ofthe other's situation (in-
tuitive appresentation). This authentic understanding 
expresses the personalistic attitude toward the other 
and is the foundation for the human sciences. 
Social acts. Acts of empathy (Ein(iihlung, Kompre-
hension, Fremdverstehen) are not yet called social acts 
by Husserl. Accordingto him, social acts are acts ofad-
dressing others (sich an Andere wenden ). These are acts 
of communication, but not necessarily on a linguistic-
conceptuallevel. Gestures- e.g., pointing- are also 
communicative. Basic for social acts is the intentiona! 
evoking of the partner's awareness that I intend to 
communicate something to him or to her. This com-
munication may be merely an informative one (when I 
intend merely the other's taking notice of something), 
but it may also express my wish or my will that the 
other does something more, e.g., when I address others 
by requests or orders. In this context, Husserl speaks 
of a social or personal self-consciousness: I am aware 
of my own intentiona! acts as understandable and un-
derstood by others. 
The intersubjective transcendentalfield. By means 
ofthe reduction to intersubjectivity (the "double reduc-
tion," mentioned above), the consciousnesses of other 
subjects belong methodologically to the thematic field 
of transcendental phenomenology. They are intention-
ally included in this field by my own empathic and 
social acts. But the other subjects transcend my own 
sphere of consciousness sin ce they are re-presented in 
these acts as conscious beings, i.e., as being.for them-
selves ((iir sich selbst), and since this "being for them-
selves" is never originally (primordially) experienced 
by myself. At the same time, they are re-presented as 
co-subjects or co-constituting subjects, in their inten-
tiona! acts constituting together with myselfa common 
world, and as intentionally including myself by their 
empathic and social acts.

ITALY 
Phenomenology was originally in-
troduced by ANTONIO BANFI, whose early writings on 
Husserl, whom he had met personally in Freiburg, date 
back to 1923. In his main work, Principi di una teoria 
delia ragione ( 1926 ), Ban fi refers to both Logische Un-
tersuchungen ( 190{}-190 1) and ldeen zu ei ner reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 ( 1913) and explains Husserl's phenomenology 
as an investigation of experience that has broken free 
359 
of ali dogmatic premises. Such an approach is opposed 
to both idealism and positivistic empU'icism. Despite 
the opposition of neo-Scholasticism and the residues 
of positivism and pragmatism, the neo-idealism of 
Benedetto Croce (1866--1952) and Giovanni Gentile 
( 1875-1944) was dominant in Italy at that time. 
Through phenomenology and its descriptive method 
Banfi tried to work out a new critica! rationalism that 
could avoid the metaphysics of the subject and the 
naivete of realism. Husserl's EIDETIC METHOD was un-
derstood by the Italian philosopher as a way to seize 
the rational structure of experience without prejudice. 
The eidos does not exist beyond empirica! reality, but 
!ies on the si de ofthe world of experience as an infinite 
possibility of the rational order within the complex re-
lations revealed by experience itself. It is worth point-
ing out that Banfi soon realized that Husserl's eidetic 
analysis necessarily came to recognize the historical 
nature of phenomena. The complex relations of expe-
rience can be clarified only when referred to a concrete 
subject, i.e., through reference to operations carried out 
by humans in modes that are determined by their own 
historical frameworks. In the late 1930s Ban fi 's con-
crete humanism largely anticipated the central issue of 
Husserl's Die Krisis der europăischen Wissenschaften 
und die transzendentale Phănomenologie ( 1936). 
Banfi 's support of phenomenology was first echoed 
by a series of Husserlian studies, among them soFIA 
VANNI ROVIGHI's essays of 1933, followed by a mono-
graph, Husserl ( 1939). Her interpretation, of Chris-
tian inspiration, represents an interesting contribution 
to the lively controversy between neo-Scholasticism 
and neo-idealism, the latter being represented by Gen-
tile's actualism. Vanni Rovighi tries to demonstrate 
how Husserl's INTENTIONALITY justified a recovery of 
medieval Christian Aristotelianism, principally repre-
sented by Aquinas, in opposition to idealistic subjec-
tivism. A further intersting contribution was offered 
by NORBERTO BOBBIO in 1934-35, who tried tO apply 
the phenomenological method to law. 
By the end ofthe 1930s, however, interest in pheno-
menology declined in Jtaly, while the EXISTENTIAUSM 
ofMARTIN HEIDEGGER gained considerab[e ground. LUIGI 
PAREYSON, NICOLA ABBAGNANO, and ENZO PACI were the 
main representatives of existentialism in ltaly, even 
if they ali carne from different perspectives. The fi-

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
and Gentile began with the risc ofthis line ofthought. 
Pareyson was the most faithful to Heidegger's the-
ses; he emphasized their hermeneutica! character and 
turned his attention to irrational and religious issues 
of Kierkegaardian inspiration. Deal ing with the typi-
cal themes of anguish and the limits of existence and 
reason, Abbagnano opted for a "positive" solution, re-
ferring to the social sciences and the pragmatic em-
piricism of John Dewey. Paei, o ne of Ban fi 's students, 
emphasizcd the temporal and finite in human experi-
ence. The possibility of a rational meaning of life is 
to be related to death and should include an open and 
always relative conception oftruth. 
Banfi originally looked at the spread of existential-
ism in Italy with sympathy. Yet he never failed to assert 
the phenomenological inspiration of his own critica! 
rationalism, even ifthat meant engaging in open con-
troversy with his own students. He founded the journal 
Studi Filosofiei in Milan, the city in which he was 
teaching, in 1940. Among its contributors were names 
fated to become well known in the world ofltalian eul-
ture. Shortly before dying, Banfi dedicated his last and 
posthumously appearing essay, "Husserl ela eri si delia 
civilta europea" (1958), to the Husserliana edition of 
the Krisis. He saw in that work the confirmation of 
the tie between rationalism and historicism, between 
historical humanism and critica! rationalism, that he 
had discerned twenty-five years before as the ultimate 
result of phenomenological research. 
Enzo Paei, Ban fi 's heir and successor at Mi lan, in-
troduced phenomenology again in the early 1960s. Ex-
istentialism had exhausted its innovating spur, whereas 
neo-positivism, Marxism, and social science were ex-
tending thcir influence considerably. The main basis 
for a "return to Husserl" suggested by Paei !ies in the 
appearanee of Husserl 's posthumous works under HER-
MAN LEO VAN BREDA's leadership, Cartesianische Med-
itationen [ 1931 ], !deen Il and III (1952), and Krisis 
( 1954 ), as well as Etfahrung und Urteil ( 1939), edited 
by LUDWIG LANDGREBE, and Welt, fch und Zeit (World, 
l, and time, 1955) by GERD BRAND, etc. These works 
caii attention to remarkable issues, sueh as GENETIC 
PHENOMENOLOGY, passive synthesis, INTERSUBJECTIVITY, 
the intermcdiary function ofthe BODY between the sur-
rounding world and consciousness, and sense-making 
operations as pre-categorial processes occurring on the 
Jeve] of thc LIFEWORLD. 
According to Paei, such investigations belie ali 
charges of idealism and intellectualism ever brought 
against Husserl. Thc phenomenological framework 
seen from this point ofview should show how, far from 
being immune to misunderstanding and irrationalistic 
deftection, Heidegger's EXISTENTIAL PfiENOMENOLOGY 
represents only an cpisode within phenomenology. 
That is why Heideggcr's negative limits may be tran-
scended only by returning to Husserl. Abbagnano had 
already written about positive existentialism, but he 
had also shown an inclination for empirieism that Paei 
did not share. Abbagnano elaboratcd a phenomenology 
ofrelations, supported by externa! philosophical refer-
ences, among them the reference to the philosophy of 
process and eterna! objects of Alfred North Whitehead. 
Under the lead of Paei and his students, who kept 
the tradition of the Milan sehool ali ve and strength-
ened it through contacts with and inftuences on other 
parts of [ta]y (FILIASI CARCANO in Rome and GIUSEPPI 
SEMERARI in Bari), the return to Husserl prevailed in the 
1960s and the first half ofthe 1970s, when phenomen-
ology was widespread in Italy. The journal Aut Aut, 
founded by Paei, was its principle means of diffusion. 
This interest in phenomenology was marked by the 
systematie translation of Husserl 's work, un tii then un-
known in Italian except for ldeen!. A wide production 
ofbooks and essays gave rise to a lively debate. Mean-
while, works by JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY, PAUL RIC<EUR, LUDWIG LANDGREBE, EUGEN FINK, 
KAREL KOSfK, LUDWIG BINSWANGER, and others were 
being translated. Regarding publications by ltalians, 
we should first mention Paci's anthology Omaggio a 
Husserl ( 1960), which inaugurated the return to pheno-
menology, and then GUIDO PEDROLI's Lafenomeno!ogia 
di Husserl ( 1958), ENZO MELANDRI's Logica ed expe-
rienza in Husserl (1960), ENZO PA CI 's Tempo e veri ta 
ne/la fenomenologia di Husserl ( 1961 ), Giuseppe Se-
merari 's Scienza nu o va e ragione ( 1961 ), c ARLO SINI 's 
lntroduzione allafenomeno!ogia come scienza ( 1965), 
as well as his anthology La fenomenologia ( 1965), 
which colleeted the fundamental writings witnessing 
the return to Husserl. 
A systematic return to phenomenology was also 
recorded in FRANCE, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, YUGOSLAVIA, HUN-
GARY, and the UNITED STATES, and played a key ro]e 
in the International Congress of Phenomenology held 
in Mexico City in 1960. The phenomenological ap-

ITALY 
proach did not limit its influence to the philosoph-
ical sphere in Italy but affected rsYCIIIATRY (thanks 
to DANILO CARGNFLLO, LORFNZO CALVI, and FERDINANDO 
BARISON) and AFSTHETICS as welJ. The latter was well 
represented by the works ofLUCIANO ANCESCHI and DINO 
FORMAGGIO, both students ofBanfi. Anceschi, who was 
professor of aesthetics at Bologna, founded the review 
Il Ve1Ti and thereby began a center ofphenomenologi-
cal studies mainly devoted to LITERATURE, which pro-
duced works and activities of great interest and origi-
nality. Similarly, LUIGI ROGNONI was active in the field 
of aesthetics in MUSIC. 
In the early 1970s, the blooming Italian phenomen-
ology had to cope with the ris ing ti de of MARXISM in-
spired by Antonio Gramsci. Italian neo-Marxism not 
only participated in cultural motivations that actually 
influenced the whole of European cu !ture, but was also 
deeply rooted in the contemporary politica! situation. 
This situation reflected the constant electoral growth 
of the Communist Party along with the birth of the 
student protest, which followed the American, French, 
and German models, and eventually witnessed the deep 
eri sis of the democratic system threatened by the ter-
rorism of the Red Brigades. The secular culture was 
deeply affected by Marxism and generally tried to meet 
the requirements of economic justice and social recov-
ery, while restraining all violent excesses. 
It was within this framework that the last orig-
inal initiative in phenomenology was produced by 
Paei in his Tempo e verita ne/la fenomenologia de 
Husserl ( 1961) and Diario fenomenologico ( 1961 ). 
Paei suggested an approach between phenomenology 
and Marxism. He was followed by Semerari and his 
students, but he also met strong resistance in the or-
thodox wing of Marxism as well as among those who 
opposed Marxism. Paei was experimenting with a line 
ofthought in part similar and parallel to that of Sartre, a 
good friend whose work he deeply appreciated. But un-
like Sartre, who finally considered phenomenology no 
more than an introduction to Marxism, Paei recognized 
in Husserl an attempt to criticize and correct MARx's 
position. The main work reflecting the approach of 
phenomenology and Marxism is Paci's Funzione delle 
scienze e significato de!l'uomo (Function of the sci-
ences and signification of the human, 1963 ). In this 
work he begins from Husserl's Krisis, criticizes the 
HUMAN SCIENCES, and tries to draw conclusions from 
361 
Marxism in general and the Italian Marxist tradition 
in particular (Antonio Labriola and Antonio Gramsci). 
The relation turns upon the assertion of the subject's 
integral humanity that may be found in both Husserl 
and Marx. By criticizing the classical economic cate-
gories and recovering human labor as a pre-categorial 
operation and source of MEANING and VALUE. Marx an-
ticipates Husserl 's transcendental FPOCHf' AND RFDUC-
TION. Yet Marx retains some residual materialism and 
NATURALISM that Husserl corrects through the reduction 
to the LIFEWORLD, which is not tobe understood ata real 
world level, but as an opening to a possible sense, a life 
within infinite truth, beyond any fetishism and idola-
try, that is a call to ali humanity. Nevertheless, unlike 
Husserl, Marx did not limit the meaning of praxis to 
the theoretical practice of science and philosophy, but 
extended it more directly to human historical practice 
as a whole. 
In the 1980s, after a long period of eri sis, Marxism 
followed the same decline as Communism- a sort of 
premonition of its future collapse. Its influence grew 
weak, while the ideas of French STRUCTURALISM began 
spreading in ltaly. But it was the re turn toN ietzsche and 
Heidegger that produced an autonomous hermeneuti-
ca! line of thought. Remarkably influential was the 
inspiration of PAUL RICCEUR and HANS-GFORG GADAMFR, 
and particularly the awareness that the thought of Hei-
degger could not be reduced to the existentialist image 
that had prevailed in the 1940s and 1950s. 
Hermeneutica] philosophy in ltaly developed 
through two different experiences. The first one was 
led by GIANNI VATTIMO, whose Pensiero debole ( 1983 ). 
which also became popular abroad, ignored phenomen-
ology and identified in Heidegger the premise for a final 
overcoming of philosophical discourse, choosing adi-
rection that shows some affinities to that of Richard 
Rorty. In this way Vattimo developed the hermeneu-
tica! heritage of his master Pareyson, whom he had 
succeeded at Turin. 
The second development was introduced by CARLO 
SINI, Paei 's sucessor in Mi lan. In Semiotica e 
filosofia ( 1978; cf. La fenomenologia e la filosofia 
del/'esperienza [ 1987]), he acknowledged its pheno-
menological inspiration and linked it with thc prospec-
tivism of Nietzsche (brilliantly analyzed by Yattimo 
himself), as well as the unended semiosis ofthe pheno-
menology of Charles Sanders Peirce, the importance 

362 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ofwhich had already been understood by Paei. 
Ten years, HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY pre-
vailed in Italy, marking the theoretical decline of 
Husserl 's phenomenology. Stil!, historical surveys of 
his thought continued to be produced, thanks to the

In recent years the problem of the relationship 
between Husserl and Heidegger, within their mutual 
phenomenological inspiration, has once more proved 
tobe decisive in the understanding ofthe development 
of philosophy in our century. A considerable contri-
bution has been offered by JACQUES DERRIDA 's work 
and the posthumously published courses ofthe young 
Heidegger. ALFREDO MARIN! and PIER ALDO ROVATTI ha ve 
worked in this direction profitably. Dealing with is-
sues of pre-categorial operations in Husserl and the 
end of philosophy in Heidegger in Etica delia scrit-
tura (1992), Sini has carried out a reconstruction of 
phenomenology in terms of "phenomenography": it is 
writing and no longer the phenomenological voi ce that 
may possibly be the founding seat of the practice of 
philosophy.

WILLIAM JAMES 
At the height of his ca-
reer William James (1842-1910) unwittingly made a 
decision that in effect deprived severa! generations of 
philosophers in the UNITED STATES of easy access to one 
ofthe greatest philosophical works ofthe 20th century, 
EDMUND HUSSERL 's Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-
1901 ). In response to an inquiry from a prestigious 
American publishing house about the merits of an al-
ready completed translation of Husserl's work, James 
advised against its publication on the grounds that no 
one in America would be interested in another German 
work on logic. The cavalier and chauvinistic tone of 
this remark is untypical and unworthy of James, who 
would no doubt have been chagrined to discover that 
in the second edition of his work Husserl generously 
refers to James's "genius for observation in the field 
of descriptive psychology," and expresses his indebt-
edness to James for his help in achieving "my release 
from the psychologistic position." 
Contemporary scholars generally agree that Husserl 
was right to have detected affinities between James's 
work and his own. lndeed, it is now firmly estab-
lished that James independently developed many of 
the themes that would subsequently come to be asso-
ciated with the phenomenological tradition, e.g., IN-
TENTIONALITY, TIME, and the primacy of PERCEPTION. 
In the opening pages of the Principles of Psychology 
( 1890), James outlined a program for a natural scien-
tific psychology that would maintain a thoroughgoing 
dualism, while also investigating the causal links be-
tween physiological and mental states. BRUCE WILSHIRE 
has shown that this program gradually broke down in 
the course of the work, as James carne to realize that 
it is impossible to specify the nature of a mental state 
exclusively in terms of its extrinsic ca usa! conditions. 
Although in the Principles he never fully sorted out the 
ditferent strands of his emergent methodology, he did 
begin to distinguish between descriptive and explana-
tory modes of investigation, eventually referring to the 
latter as "physiological preliminaries." In James's !ater 
Essays in Radical Empiricism ( 1912), the inconsisten-
cies of psychophysical dualism were fully abandoned 
in favor of a return to "pure experience." According 
to James, the fie1d of pure experience does not present 
itself as merely subjective or psychological, but rather 
as a realm of givenness that precedes the distinction be-
tween subjective and objective and makes this distinc-
tion possible. Like Husserl, James concludes that the 
traditional modern interpretations of the immanence 
of conscious life and the transcendence of things must 
be redefined in terms of their differing modes of ap-
pearance within a prior and comprehensive zone of ali 
manifestation. James also developes the implications 
of this fundamental thesis. He repudiated the modern 
interpretation of"mind" as an inner space set offfrom 
the rest ofnature, and he rejects Kant's distinction be-
tween phenomena and things-in-themselves. He also 
rejects the view that the task of philosophy is to guar-
antee that our concepts and theories somehow mirror 
the world. 
The key to James's phenomenological turn is his 
gradual emancipation from the premises of BRITISH 
EMPIRICISM. The empiricists had generally described 
the mind as an interior space containing representa-
tions of reality. According to John Locke ( 1632-1704 ), 
for example, the "cabinet" of the mind is empty and 
dark at birth, and the organs of sensation are windows 
through which enter "visible resemb1ances or ideas of 
things without." The mind assembles into configura-
tions those elementary impressions that habitually oc-
cur together. If a subsequent impression or complex of 
impressions is similar to an earlier impressional con-
ten!, association triggers the revival ofthe earlier con-
ten!, and the mind then fuses earlier and !ater contents 
into a blurred general image. Thus association by con-
tiguity explains the recognition of unified things, and 
association by resemblance explains how we gradu-
ally acquire a repertory of ideas. James makes severa! 
criticisms ofthis theory. 
First, he rejects the notion that our most primi-
tive sensations are isolated atomic impressions. Al-
though sensation does present simple qualities, it al-
ways presents these as parts of "sensible totals" that 
are presentations of objects situated within "fringes" 
or horizons: "The 'simple impression' of Hume, the 
'simple idea' of Locke are both abstractions never re-

alized in experience. Experience from the very outset 
first presents us with concreted objects, vaguely con-
tinuous with the rest of the world." Second, he rejects 
the notion that cognition consists in the mere presence 
within the mind of sense impressions and associatively 
processed ideas. He points out that the empiricist ac-
count of mental processes fa ils to distinguish between 
mental acts and their contents or objects: "Mill and the 
rest believe that a thought must he what it means, and 
mean what it is." Finally, he suggests that it is incoher-
ent to appeal to unconscious processes of association 
by contiguity and resemblance without ever offering an 
account of how the mind registers these relationships 
in the first place. For example, unless !here occurs a 
consciousness of resemblance somewhere in the cir-
cuit, it is simply nonsense to speak of resemblances 
between impressions. In short, empiricism trades on 
a tacit acknowledgment of conscious intentiona! acts, 
while its overt theory reduces those acts to the mere 
having and processing of intramental impressions. 
If MF.ANINGs cannot be reduced to blurred general 
images, then neither can logica! laws be reduced to 
inductive generalizations about our thought processes. 
James criticizes John Stuart Mill ( 1806-1873) and Her-
bert Spencer ( 182G-1903) for failing to account for the 
fact that the logica! network of our meanings forms an 
ideal system whose relations have a necessity and uni-
versality that cannot be accounted for by habit and asso-
ciation. Speaking ofthe genesis of conceptual systems, 
he asks his readers to reflect on the following question: 
if a hundred different beings were created, each en-
dowed with powers ofmemory and comparison, and if 
each were presented with a "magic lantern show" that 
imprinted on its mind the same group of sensations, but 
in different combinations, and if a long enough time 
were tobe allotted for arrangement and classification, 
what results would occur? James contends that each of 
these beings would eventually develop identica! classi-
ficatory systems, because their powers of comparison 
would yield insight into the "relation between the in-
ward natures of the sensations," rather than merely 
registering patterns dictated by the order oftheir suc-
cession. In short, judgments of comparison ha veto do 
with relations between ideal meanings rather than with 
associative experiences on the perceptuallevel. 
James balances this defense of ideal meanings with 
a strong commitment to the primacy ofperception. Per-
ception puts into play discriminatory insight into the 
inward natures ofsensible totals that detach themselves 
from a rich relational context provided by the object's 
fringes. This discrimination is already the beginning of 
conception that focuses on sameness ofinward natures, 
and thus makes possible the identification ofperceived 
particulars and their description in fixed categories. In 
short, perceptual and categoria] intuitions work in tan-
dem as two different but intertwined ways ofpresenting 
the same objects. As JAMFS M. EDIL points out, this is 
the same position that Husserl develops in the Logis-
che Untersuchungen, where he describes the recipro-
ca] founding-founded relationship between ideal and 
perceptual dimensions. Unlike GOTTLOB FREGF., whose 
critique of PSYCHOLOGISM relegates ideal senses to a 
subsistent "third realm," James and Husserl focus upon 
their functional status. A meaning or sense is simply 
what we know when we know some particular. We 
grasp the "what" both as a surplus whose sense exceeds 
the particularity of this instance, and as the condition 
for the manifestation ofthe particular thing. 
James often observes that in conception clarity is 
gained, but richness is lost. Conception enables us to 
reach beyond the immediate field of experience, and 
thus to give meaning to the flow of life and to have 
some control over the future. Conceptual discrimina-
tion also permits the kind of detachment requisite for 
the precision and clarity of scientific theories. James 
firmly asserts that without such abstractive thinking 
we would be incapable of dealing efficaciously with 
things. However, he also insists that conceptual anal-
ysis functions for ends set by our practica! interests: 
"classification and conception are purely teleological 
weapons ofthe mind." We are always interested partic-
ipants before we are theoretical spectators. Things first 
appear not as objects of theoretical investigation, but 
as paths or obstacles in a vast instrumental complex. 
Overemphasis on conceptual abstractions generates the 
illusion ofthe absolute spectator, an attitude that James 
called "vicious inte11ectualism" in A Pluralistic Uni-
verse (1909). He concludes that a philosophical ac-
count of truth must always consider full facts rather 
than objects taken in abstraction. In The Varieties of 
Religious Experience ( 1 902), he asserts that a fact in 
its full concreteness is a "conscious field plus its object 
as felt or thought of plus an attitude towards the object 
plus a sense ofselfto which the attitude belongs." The

365 
originality of pragmatism, James contends, !ies in the 
prefercnce that it gives to the concrete sources of ab-
stractive thought. We encounter the deeper and richer 
features of reality only in our perceptual experience. 
We ought therefore to count only those conceptual sys-
tems as truc that help us to makc sense ofthe perccptual 
world, and that lead us back harmoniously along "the 
trunk line of meaning" to the realm of perceptual ac-
quaintance. Pragmatism, he asserts in The Meaning of 
Truth ( 1909), "begins with concreteness, and returns 
and ends with it." 
This emphasis on the roots of our conceptual net-
works in the perceived world accounts for a difference 
in tone between James's pragmatism and contempo-
rary versions of pragmatism that claim to revitalize 
his position, but in fact owe more to Dewey's natural-
ism and to Nietzsche 's perspectivalism. After realizing 
the incoherencc of causal accounts of cognition, James 
never again tried to account for rationality in terms of 
natural drives or adaptive powers. Moreover, he never 
construed perceptual and conceptual perspectives as 
illusory projections of a will to power. His pragmatism 
was always subordinated to his theory ofintentionality 
and to a strong sense that, as he puts it in The Will to 
Believe ( 1897), "the inmost nature of reality is con-
genial to the powers we possess." He recognizes that 
our acts of directedness toward objects are interpretive 
and selective achievernents, rather than merely pas-
sive registrations of already constituted entities. But 
he sees no reason to conclude that all of our knowl-
edge is relativized by reason ofits interested character. 
ALFRED SCHUTZ, o ne ofthe first scholars to give a pheno-
rnenological reading of James's analysis ofthe stream 
of thought, further developed James 's account of how 
our interestsdetermine our sense ofreality. James calls 
attention to the various worlds or "sub-universes" to 
which we seem at different times to belong. There is, 
first of all, the paramount reality of the world of per-
ception. Then there are the worlds of scientific theory, 
of ideal relations, of mythology and religion, of the 
"idols ofthe tribe," of dreams, ofphantasy, and ofmad-
ness. Each of these worlds has its particular cognitive 
style, its specific mode of conscious engagement and 
sociality ( or lack thereof). The world of perception is 
paramount because it is common to us ali, and because 
it is more fully and more consistently the locus of prac-
tica! interest and social interaction. Schutz points out, 
however, that the perceptual world itself is sedimented 
with socially constructed layers ofmeaning. As James 
himself observes, our pcrceptions are always shaped 
by a history and prehistory of interpretations. James 
concludes that there is no way to prove to a skeptic 's 
satisfaction the "postulates of rationality" that guide 
the elaboration of our conceptual networks. AII we can 
do is point to the harmonious interplay between percep-
luai consciousness and categoria! thought. Everything 
therefore suggests that James was never really preoc-
cupied by the quest for certainty or by the dream of 
finding privileged representations. His pragmatism is 
not so much the product of epistcmological concerns 
as it is a corollary of his cmphasis on the selective and 
interested character of our classificatory systems. 
In the Principles, James develops a complex theory 
of personal identity and frec agency. He distinguishes 
between the "me" (the empirica! self) and the 'T' (the 
agent of cognition and of human actions). However, 
he observes that even the most attentive reflection fails 
to discover a perduring sort of entity that is ordinar-
ily denoted by the term "EGo." This is because the 
present moment of consciousness cannot take itself as 
an object. Consciousness is a ternporally cumulative 
stream whose self-appropriation is always retrospec-
tive. James concludes that there is no need to postulate 
a substantial principle of unity from which each suc-
ceeding "judging thought" may be said to emanate or 
to proceed. The fringe-structure of the present mo-
ment of consciousness (its retention of the just past 
and its anticipation ofthe immediate future within the 
span of the present) provides an adequate explana-
tion of the continuity of human agency. Although the 
present thought never has itself for an object, part of 
its concrete object is always the immediately preced ing 
thought, which has not yet faded from within the hori-
zon ofthe present. Thanks to the "peculiar warmth and 
intimacy" that characterize this immediately preced-
ing thought, the present thought recognizes the earlier 
thought as its own. The next thought performs a similar 
act of appropriation, and thus the unity of conscious-
ness is preserved by a series of successive appropria-
tions. 
Although the present thought is always the agent of 
appropriation, its appropriation is ascribed to the self as 
lived in the bodily mode. 1 recognize my every earlier 
thought as belonging to the unity ofmy emergent self-

366 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
hood whose foca! point is the lived soov: "The body 
is the storm centre, the origin of coordinates ... Ev-
erything circles around it, and is felt from its point of 
view. The word 'I' then is primarily a noun ofposition, 
just like 'this' and 'here'" (Essays in Radical Empiri-
cism [ 1912]). ARON GURWITSCH argues convincingly that 
this description ofthe interplay between the stream of 
consciousness and the lived body makes for a remark-
ably comprehensive and nuanced phenomenology of 
personal identity and human action. He concludes that 
well before HUSSERL and HEIDEGGER, "James may be 
said to have discovered temporality as the fundamen-
tal structure of conscious life." 
James recognizes that the body is both the func-
tional center ofthe field of consciousness and the locus 
ofstimuli and reflexes. Indeed, he sometimes describes 
bodily movements in a mechanistic fashion as reflexes 
unrelated to the performances of consciousness. For 
example, he characterizes emotion as an automatic 
bodily reaction to physical stimuli. The only conscious 
activity involved in EMOTION is the experience of corpo-
real disturbances. However, his discussion of freedom 
and determinism gives priority to his more phenomen-
ological view ofthe body as the functional center ofthe 
field of consciousness. The key to our freedom is the 
power of consciousness to shift its attention. The focus 
of the present conscious act is not necessarily deter-
mined by its predecessors. Freedom appears wherever 
consciousness displays its mastery over the flow of ex-
perience by reason of its power to shift the focus of its 
attention. James adds, however, that our potential for 
freedom must be constantly cultivated ifit is not to suc-
cumb to deterministic influences of reflexes and habit. 
His writings in ETHICS continually appeal to the need 
to believe in freedom and in the value ofthe strenuous 
and creative life. The first ethical act is the decision to 
believe in freedom itself. 
It is unfortunate that James 's study of RELIGION has 
been largely neglected by scholars within the pheno-
menological tradition. James applies his critique of 
psychologism to those interpretations that question the 
value of religious phenomena by calling attention to 
their psychological conditions and origins. He is well 
aware of the "exalted emotional sensibility" of many 
religious geniuses, but he insists that it is a category 
error to explain away religious experience by identi-
fying it with fear of death, the spirit of resentment, or 
perverted sexuality. In a wry commentary on attempts 
to construe religious beliefs as products of repressed 
sexual drives, because of the barely concealed erotic 
imagery of some mystical writers, he observes that one 
might as well interpret religious faith as an aberration 
of the respiratory function, since religious texts often 
invoke the soul 's breathless panting. An honest account 
ofreligious experience must adopta pluralistic method 
that takes into account its total sense. James points out 
that religious experience does not seem tobe related to 
any particular bodily drive or emotion; rather, it makes 
use of the full range of emotions, desires, and motives 
to express intentions of a unique order. On the other 
hand, he also sets a limit to speculation based on a 
phenomenology of religious experience. Descriptions 
of mystical and other religious experiences do not jus-
tify theological or metaphysical conclusions. 
This emphasis on the limits of REASON is typical of 
James. The spirit of his pragmatism is perhaps best 
expressed in the essay "The Sentiment of Rationality" 
( 1897), in which he contends that human rationality is 
guided by two great passions ofthe mind: the passion 
for ever more lucid and elegant conceptual systems, 
and the rival passion for the richness and complexity 
of perceptual experience. He suggests that the harmo-
nious coordination ofthese intellectual passions yields 
our best chance for truth. When both of these pas-
sions are satisfied, we have the sense that there are no 
further questions tobe asked. Although this is no guar-
antee of the rightness of our convictions, there comes 
a point in any inquiry when it is imprudent or even 
pathological to continue to consider alternative possi-
bilities. A sense of the mean between extremes is as 
necessary in intellectual inquiry as it is in practica! 
affairs. As a philosopher, James was also committed 
to the view that the moments in which we experience 
the feei ing ofrationality are provisional resting places. 
Philosophy's role is ever to seek alternatives, and to 
criticize comfortable conclusions. There can be no to-
talizing syntheses. At a time when the latest swing 
ofthe pendulum has taken philosophy from excessive 
confidence in reason 's powers to an equally excessive 
reduction of ali truths to pleasing or powerful illusions, 
this balanced appraisal of human rationality offers an 
attractive alternative.

JAPAN 
Phenomenology was introduced into 
Japan by KITARO NISHIDA through his articles before 
Wor]d War l, and it is well known that EDMUND HUSSERL 
himself contributed two articles to the Japanese jour-
nal Kaizo in 1923 and 1924. During the 1920s HA.IIME 
TANABE, SATOMI TAKAHASHI, TETSURO WATSU.ll, and others 
visited Freiburg and heard lectures by Husserl, OSKAR 
BECKER, EUGEN FINK, and MARTIN HEIDEGGER. They re-
turned to Japan to introduce phenomenology in more 
detail and also tried more or less to criticize and solve 
various problems from their own points of view. The 
originality and high level oftheir accomplishments are 
still quite remarkable today. 
Kitaro Nishida is the greatest figure in modern 
Japanese philosophy, not only because of his found-
ing of the Kyoto school, but also through his broad 
influence on the philosophica1 activities ofthis country 
in general. Scarcely any Japanese philosopher of any 
originality has been uninfluenced by his thought. This 
fascination seems to come from his deep insight into 
reality as the ultimate unity that dominates through the 
multiplicity of world phenomena. This unity is not a 
mere object of cognition, but rather something that de-
mands the whole personality of each observer. Perhaps 
he attained his insight through his many years of Zen 
practice in his earlier years. Some ofhis poems (waka) 
reveal the purity and deep innocence ofhis personality 
to us. He expressed the unity of uni verse and person-
ality initially by the phrase "pure experience" (iunsui 
keiken) and then, in his !ater thought, with special refer-
ence to Plat o 's chăra by the term "seated field" (bas ha). 
This is the unity of (anonymous) consciousness and 
true Being. AII oppositions and even ali contradictions 
are reconciled in this unity because ali differences al-
ways assume a unity. Nishida was so concerned to 
ascertain this unity in phenomena that their differences 
were for him of only secondary significance, at least 
compared with their unity. Coincidentia oppositorum 
in various dimensions of experience was for him both 
an ideal and a reality. Concerning such an ultimate 
unity, Sein and Sollen are one and the same. This all-
embracing character of his thought gave it a kind of 
incomprehensible fascination. If phenomenology is a 
way of searching for truth through various phenomena 
as "they occur, Nishida's thought is quite phenomen-
ological. "Truth must be nothing other than reality as 
such" (Zen no kenf..:yii [Study of the good, 1911 ]; cf.

Jikaku ni okeru chokkan to hansei [Intuition and re-
flection in self-consciousness, 1917]; there are English 
translations of both books, and a German translation 
ofthe former). 
Hajime Tanabe, a younger colleague of Nishida 
at Kyoto, carne to criticize him for slighting the dif-
ferences among mundane phenomena and rejected as 
mysticism his concept of the immediate unity of con-
tradictory opposites. Tanabe proposed a new dialectic 
called the "logic of species," which means that ev-
ery contradictory opposition must be mediated by a 
third term just as a genus and an individual are to 
be mediated by a species (Shu no ronri no benshăhă 
[Dialectic of species logic], 194 7). The controversy 
between Nishida and Tanabe during the 1930s over 
the dialectica! method is a major event in the history 
of Japanese philosophy. Tanabe visited Freiburg in the 
middle of the 1920s and heard the lectures of Husserl 
himself. Thus he became one of the earliest to intro-
duce phenomenology into Japan. About phenomen-
ology he wrote: "The fact that the transcendental con-
sciousness of phenomenology !ies, unlike that of KANT, 
within the primordial sphere of the experienced must 
be accepted because of its concreteness over against 
the abstractness of the Kantian formalism. On the 
other hand, this fact becomes a disadvantage insofar 
as it makes phenomenology incapable of accomplish-
ing what Kantian transcendental philosophy has done." 
Generally speaking, transcendental consciousness is 
required to ground the transcendent being of objects. 
"But because Husserlian transcendental consciousness 
makes ali the object-intentionalities immanent in itself, 
it may be difficult to tind a criterion in the structure 
of transcendental consciousness itself for discriminat-
ing between a genuinely transcendent object and one 
that is only seemingly transcendent" ( Tetsugaku tsiiron 
[Elements of philosophy ], 1933). Tanabe had already 
begun the work of a dialectician, mediating practically 
between "spirit" and "transcendent material" under the 
influence ofNishida. 
SATOMI TAKAHASHI of Tohoku University in Sendai 
studied phenomenology in Freiburg during 1926-27, 
about the same time as Tanabe, and became the founder 
ofthe phenomenological tradition at his university. His 
monograph Husserl no genshăgaku (Husserl 's pheno-
menology, 1931 ), is one ofthe earliest comprehensive 
introductions of phenomenology in Japan. Moreover, 
his article "Genshogakutei kangen no kanosei" (The 
possibility of the phenomenological reduction, 1930; 
cf. Zen tai no tachiba [The standpoint oftotality, 1932]) 
may be called one of the most profound arguments 
ever dedicated to this theme. Concerning the relation 
between the phenomenological EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION 
and the neutrality modification, he asserts, even con-
trary to Husserl 's opinion, that the latter is always in-
volved in the former as a part of it. In other words, 
the phenomenological reduction is the act ofreflection 
upon what is neutralized in its thesis ofBeing. The iter-
ability of the neutrality modification, which is denied 
by Husserl, is admitted. Every being that is neutral-
ized is founded by Being in the condition (Zustand) of 
prima] experience, which culminates in eterna! love. 
On the other hand, Takahashi denies the absolute im-
manence of the stream of consciousness posited by 
Husserl in Ideen zu ei ner reinen Phanomenologie und 
phanomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913) as the mere 
result ofthe latter's metaphysical assumption ofCarte-
sian dualism. 
Takahashi was consistently interested in the phe-
nomenon ofTIMEand, through confrontation with HENRI 
BERGSON, HEIDEGGER, WILLIAM JAMES, and Augustine, 
etc., he reached his own position (Jikanron [On time, 
1953]). In his opinion there are three possible views 
according to whether the pivot of time is regarded 
as being (1) in the past, (2) in the present, or (3) 
in the future. Bergson holds the first, Heidegger and 
Hermann Cohen ( 1842-1918) hold the third, and St. 
Augustine and FRANZ BRENTANO hoJd, if anything, the 
second. Takahashi does not mention Husserl, whose 
position, however, seems to stretch over the second 
and third views. Takahashi himself claimed to take no 
exclusive position. He accepted not only the time that 
starts from the future and past, but also the one that 
either flows from the present over into past and future 
or arrives at the present from both opposite directions 
simultaneously. Among such times centering upon the 
present he discriminates ( 1) the intellectual (reflective) 
"thin" present and (2) the emotional "thick" present. 
The latter embraces both future and past tightly in it-
self, the most eminent example ofwhich is the present 
residing in love. 
TETSURO WATSUJI was an incomparably brilliant fig-
ure, not thoroughly focused on a single theme as was 
the case ofNishida. He produced many excellent works 

JAPAN 
in diverse domains ofthe HUMAN SCIENCES: ancient and 
modern history of Japan, history of major world reli-
gions, history of oriental and occidental thought, PHILO-
SOPIIICAL ANTIIROPOLOGY, FTHICS, ETIINOLOGY, compar-
ative study of cultures, and history of arts and AES-
THFTICS. In all these regions he produced research at 
the highest level. His approach was the HERMENEUTI-
CAL PHENOMENOLOGY inspired by Martin Heidegger's 
Sein und Zeit ( 1927), which he read during his stay 
in Europe ( 1927-28). Throughout his diverse stud-
ies, he consistently investigated the "Human Being," 
which has in itself a double-sidedness: the individual 
and the social. It is not a closed substance or cog-
ito, but a dialectica! relationship between two sides or 
moments that reach beyond inwardness into the tran-
scendence of other human beings. Watsuji points out 
that the Japanese word for "man" (nin-gen) means et-
ymologically "between man and man." Human Being 
is therefore a priori a relational Being or a Being-in-
between. 
On the relation between HFRMENEUTICS and pheno-
menology, Watsuj i asserts that Heidegger defines "phe-
nomenon" as that which manifests itself in itself. But 
what Heidegger seeks is Being by way of beings. So 
from his standpoint beings must be called "phenom-
ena" ofBeing. But beings are essentially different from 
Being itself (the ontologica! difference). They are not 
the "itself' of Being, but rather the "others" of Being. 
Thus Being often hides itself behind its phenomena. 
Through such a hiddenness the insufficiency of Hei-
degger's definition of"phenomenon"becomes clear. In 
fact, Being manifests itself not "in itself," but "in oth-
ers." What manifests itself does so only in that which is 
other than itself. And to let something manifest itselfin 
what is other (as other) is called "interpretation," where 
this other is its "expression." Heidegger's original in-
tention may be made clearer, says Watsuji, through 
such a hermeneutica! transformation of his concept of 
phenomcnon, while, on the other hand, the necessity 
of a phenomenological reduction that guides our eyes 
from beings to Being is stil! to be affirmed. Watsuji 
wants to substitute for such Being the "Human Se-
ing" as the inter- and intra-subjective relationships he 
conceives of ( cf. Fad o [Clima te], 1935; there are En-
glish and German translations) and Ningen no gaku 
toshiteno rinrigaku [Ethics as science ofhuman being, 
1934])

GOICHI MIYAKE, who studied in Freiburg during 
1930--31 and !ater taught at Sendai and Kyoto, ex-
pressed an elementa1 doubt about the validity of the 
Husserlian epoche. Referring to some portions of For-
male und transzendentale Logik ( 1929), where the 
naivete ofTRUTH and EVIDENCF becomes progressively 
apparent, Miyake says: "Here this gradual realization 
which Husserl called painful but inevitable stands in-
volved in the depths of transcendental subjectivity, 
leaving a profound anxiety. Husserl thought it pos-
sible to overcome this gradual realization, but if we 
consider it frankly, are we sure ofthis?" (Heideggerno 
tetsugaku [Heidegger's philosophy, 1950]). 
Miyake reports that during his stay in Freiburg he 
asked OSKAR RECKER and evcn Husserl about this point 
and also pondered it himselfin many ways, but he could 
not gain clarity. Miyake found the phenomena ofhori-
zon and TIME becoming the foundation of Husserlian 
phenomenology. In these, the Jiving Being ofthe philo-
sophical truth could be found, combining the static and 
the dynamic, the finite and the infinite. But an "anx-
ious" relativity and naivete emerges here in the to-be-
concluded but never-ending process that becomes the 
fundamental phenomenon of philosophical reasoning. 
This is an extreme situation for the phenomenology 
of REASON. But insofar as phenomenology stands upon 
reason, it will be impossible to Jessen this crisis by re-
course to a more fundamental ground. Miyake asks in 
the face ofthis impasse: "Should not philosophy stand 
upon a more original 'truth' than scientific truth?" 
The fertile accumulation ofphenomenological stud-
ies in the 1 930s by the thinkers mentioned and by oth-
ers was not continued smoothly and without interrup-
tion by their successors. The disruption in the tradition 
caused by World War Il was grave. From the end of 
the war unti1 the beginning of the 1 960s, Husserl 's 
phenomenology was known chiefly as the forerunner 
or background of Heidegger's and .Il· AN-PAUL SARTRE's 
ontologica! thought, and was rarely the proper theme of 
study. But together with the rise ofthe name ofMAURICE 
MERLFAU-PONTY and the introduction of Husserl 's !ater 
thought, interest in this common ancestor of EXISTEN-
TIAL PHFNOMENOLOGY was awakened, and the renais-
sance ofHusserl's phenomenology in Japan during the 
1970s followed. Since then severa! phenomenologi-
cal thinkers of originality ha ve emerged, among whom 
three may be mentioned. 

370 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
As already noted in the case of Nishida, Japanese 
phenomenological thinkers of originality converge to 
a great extent in attempting to overcome the subject-
object scheme of modern European thought as well 
as the mind-body dichotomy of Cartesianism. WATARU 
HIROMATSU recognizes the extension of the BODY (or 
body schema) into the tools that are being used by me 
in TECHNOLOGY or into another body when one feei the 
pain of another ego. (He calls the latter the Siamese-
twin structure.) Such experiences are not one's illu-
sion, though some philosophers want to say so, but 
genuine experiences that make up our daily life. Fur-
thermore, Hiromatsu denies the simple substantiality 
of any subject (EGO) and any object (thing). For him 
"phenomenon" is not only "that which manifests it-
self," but also "that which manifests something else 
than itself," e.g., the fine piece ofwood manifests "pen-
cil." The former is real and individual, but the latter is 
ideal and universal. Both comprise the essential double 
(ideal-real) structure of the object: this pencil. Corre-
spondingly, the subject ofthe ego who recognizes this 
object-pencil is more than a simple 1. On the one hand, 
it confronts the object individually here and now, but 
on the other hand, it is concerned with the ideality 
of the object beyond the here and now, i.e., as one 
of many congruent subjects: we. Thus the subject-I, 
too, has the double structure: I as "we" ( or we as "1"). 
This structure is called by Hiromatsu the "communal 
subjectivity" and considered the sine qua non of any 
role-taking and role-playing in our social life (Sekai 
no kyodoshukanteki sonzaik6z6 [The communal sub-
jective structure ofthe being ofthe world, 1972]). 
HIROSHIICHIKAWA is concerned with the interrelation 
between body and the world, where the former does 
not mean a physical entity in the world, but some-
thing beyond the traditional dichotomy between mind 
and body. He calls it, in archaic Japanese, "mi." (mi 
is said to be very like the "implexe" of Paul Valery 
[ 1871-1945].) Mi is either body as mind or mind as 
body. Mi consists of three dimensions of unity: ( 1) 
tropistic unity, (2) intentiona! unity, and (3) mediated 
(intentiona!) unity. These are not only hierarchically 
related to each other, but also interwoven like a mov-
able semi-lattice. Tropistic unity is accompanied by 
no consciousness or solcly by consciousness ofresults 
and not of process ( e.g., the control of muscles during 
walking). It founds other unities from inside. Inten-
tional unity is accompanied by consciousness or is 
easily brought to consciousness ( e.g., EMOTION, PERCEP-
TION, or IMAGINATION). It involves particular tropistic 
unities as substructures within itself and is determined 
by them while controlling them. Here the 'T' (ego) 
emerges as an intentiona! subject that is never com-
pletely objectified, because the 'T' is deeply rooted in 
the tropistic dimension. 
Mediated unity is the intentiona! unity of Mi me-
diated by tools and signs. In daily life 1 not only in-
tend objects in the world directly, but also work upon 
objects through tools and upon other human beings 
through signs, where tools and signs are no mere ob-
jects outside of mi, but are already incorporated into 
it as its lived elements of unity. The extended or ex-
panded unity of mi not only articulates itself, but also 
intentionally articulates the world in which it is living. 
The self-determination of mi is at the same time the cor-
responding determination ofthe world, e.g., "mood" is 
a tropistic determination of the world. Therefore, the 
environmental crisis of the world today means at the 
same time the crisis of unity of mi that results from an 
overload of machi nes and signs. Since as Mi involves 
an unconscious structure in itself, Ichikawa considers 
the phenomenological epoche and reduction of Husserl 
insufficient for the task of its disclosure. To clarify the 
"passive synthesis" involved in mi, one must consider 
its genetic process, while taking account of results of 
various scientific studies. At the same time one must 
endeavor to free oneself as far as possible from his-
torical and cultural restrictions laid tacitly upon one's 
consciousness (e.g., Husserl's "pure consciousness" is 
sti li quite European). Such a reduction must be neces-
sarily incomplete and demands infinite repetition (Mi 
no k6z6 [The structure of mi, 1984]). 
As shown in the cases of Nishida, Watsuji, and 
Hiromatsu, many Japanese thinkers have shared the 
common aim of trying to bridge the so-called abyss 
between the I and others, as well as that between mind 
and body or between subject and object. But except 
for Nishida, who knew very well the contradictory 
character of the coexistence of multiple individuals 
in INTERSUBJECTIVITY, the other thinkers seem to have 
comparatively weak ideas of individuality; for them, 
an individual means only an example or special deter-
mination of something universal, e.g., nothingness or 
the human genus, and does not mean anything more. 

KARL JASPERS

This tendency is not unrelated to the particular devel-
opment of the long historical and cultural tradition of 
Japan. 
One remarkable case of the recent theory of hu-
man coexistence that thematizes this tradition can be 
taken up here, namely, that ofBJN KJMURA, a phenomen-
ologist in PSYCHJATRY. As a specialist in the treatment 
of schizophrenia, Kimura pays attention to the phe-
nomenon of self-awareness. Phenomenology means 
for him, as for Heidegger, "to Jet be seen what man-
ifests itself, just as it does so from itself, hither from 
itself." But what manifests itselfhere is not Being, but 
the self of the human being. Through such a pheno-
menology, insofar as a doctor becomes aware ofwhat 
manifests itself from within the patient, the latter is 
helped to see what manifests itself from itself, namely 
the self wanted of him or her. Tbus Kimura makes 
much of the special multiplicity of the first and sec-
ond person pronouns in Japanese. In contrast to Euro-
pean languages, Japanese has more than ten kinds of 
these first person-second person pairs in daily usage: 
ware-nanji, watashi- ( or watakushi-) an ta ( or anata), 
boku-kimi. ore- (or washi-) omae (or kisama), shăsei­
kinden ( or kijo ), uchi-otaku, etc. These pairs are used 
strictly according to the situation in which a dialogue or 
communication occurs. The ma in standard of discrim-
ination is the social pecking order between the speaker 
or writer and conversation partner. 
In Kimura 's opinion this phenomenon manifests the 
comparatively strong dependence of the Japanese self 
not only on status and social order, but upon something 
"between" oneself and others. This self is very flexible 
and is able to adjust to the variety of the situation, be-
cause unlike the European self, the Japanese self has 
no rigid identity in itself, but has a very sofi identity 
always related to the mediate sphere in which I and 
others are not yet clearly discriminated. This sphere of 
the "in-between" must not be confused with the "I and 
Thou" of dialogical philosophy, such as that of Mar-
tin Buber ( 1878-1965), because while the latter comes 
forth only on the premise of existing individua1s (l and 
he, she, it), the former genetically precedes ali individ-
ual selves and then brings them about. The individual 
self must strive, while growing, to determine its own 
identity, starting from this mediate sphere; failing that, 
it will be threatened by the primitive others who re-
main undiscriminated within itse1f. Kimura says: "In 
the case of schizophrenia the others ha ve already gotten 
into the basis or home of the self' (Jikaku no seishin-
byări [Psychopatho1ogy of self-awareness, 1970]; cf.

Best known for his philosophy 
of existence, Jaspers ( 1883-1969) began his career in 
PSYCHJATRY. One cannot fully understand Jaspers' psy-
chiatry or philosophy without appreciating his earliest 
goals in MEDJCJNE. These emerged during his years in 
training as a research assistant. In the best medical tra-
dition, he sought to describe as concretely and as faith-
fully as possib1e the clinica! picture, i.e., the signs and 
symptoms, ofhis patients' illnesses. He was convinced 
that such explications of psychopatho1ogy could pro-
vide the basis for advancing psychiatry as a scientific 
discipline. What made him unique among his peers was 
his recognition that his efforts to furnish better clinica! 
descriptions would require him to confront epistemo-
logical and methodological questions. How can one

faithfully describe another person 's experience? What 
is the mode of access and evidence for these descrip-
tions? How can such accounts remain scientific? Ifthey 
are scientific, how do they compare with other scien-
tific approaches? This search for a method led Jaspers 
in directions unusual for a physician. He threw him-
self into the Methodenstreit of the early 20th century, 
debates concern ing the methods appropriate to the NAT-
URAL and HUMAN SCIENCES. He acquainted himseifwith 
the views and often the persons ofMAX WEBER, WILHELM 
DILTHEY, Wilhelm Windelband ( 1848-1915), Heinrich 
Rickert ( 1863-1936), EDMUND HUSSERL, and others. 
This concern with methodology is exemplified in 
early essays (1911-12), but it achieved brilliant ex-
pression in Allgemeine Psychopathologie (Genral psy-
chopathology, 1913). Although its author was barely 
thirty years old, this work-extensively revised in subse-
quent editions-still stands as one ofthe landmark texts 
in psychiatry. It merits careful study even today by 
philosophers and scientists interested in methodology 
in psychiatry, medicine, and the human sciences. The 
influence ofWeber, Dilthey, and GFORG SIMMEL appears 
in Jaspers' insightful use of the distinction between 
understanding and explanation. Weber also influenced 
Jaspers' argument regarding ideal types as a fruitful 
form of conceptualization in the human sciences. 
In early essays and in a section of the Allgemeine 
Psychopathologie, Jaspers adopts and extends Edmund 
Husserl 's phenomenology from the Logische Unter-
suchungen (1900-190 1 ). In the 1950s, he described 
his appropriation of Husserlian phenomenology in the 
following terms: "My own investigations as well as 
my reflection about what was being said and done in 
psychiatry (in 1911) had led me on tracks which were 
new at that time. Philosophers gave me the impetus ... 
As method I adopted Husserl 's phenomenology, which, 
in its beginnings, he called descriptive psychology; I 
retained it although I rejected its further development 
into insight into essences ( Wesensschau ). It proved to 
be possible and fruitful to describe the inner experi-
ences of patients as phenomena of consciousness. Not 
only hallucinations, but also delusions, modes of ego-
consciousness, and emotions could, on the hasis ofthe 
patients' own descriptions, be described so clearly that 
they became recognizable with certainty in other cases. 
-
Phenomenology became a method for research." 
Phenomenology plays a limited ro le in Jaspers' psy-
chopathology. It is restricted to serving as the method 
for developing the basic concepts of psychopathol-
ogy, such as delusion, hallucination, loose associa-
tions, thought-insertion, etc. Although he is strongly 
influenced by Husserl, he departs from Husserl 's meth-
ods in particular ways. First, Jaspers takes psychiatric 
phenomenology to be an empirica! method (ein em-
pirisches Verfahren ). This signifies that in his hands 
it is not a philosophical method. It is rather a method 
of empirica! science that attempts to describe the sub-
jective experiences ofthe psychiatric patient. Because 
Jaspers' phenomenology is an empirica] method, it dis-
regards Husserl 's EIDETIC METHOD of free variation in 
IMAGINATION that finally leads to an intuition of essential 
features ( Wesensschau ). 
Second, Husserl's phenomenology emphasizes ex-
amples of mental life given through self-reflection, 
while Jaspers' psychopathology examines particular 
cases of mental pathology present in patients. Because 
the psychiatrist seeks to comprehend the experiences 
of other people, he or she must employ a form of em-
pathy (Einfi'ihlung) or understanding ( Verstehen). The 
psychiatrist must foresake, then, the emphasis on self-
reflection of the Husserlian philosopher. The psychi-
atrist should strive instead to "intuitively re-present" 
(anschaulich vergegenwiirtigen) the pathological ex-
periences ofhis or her patient. 
Jaspers remarks severa! times that it is the patient 
and the patient alone who has direct access to his or 
her own subjective experiences. How, then, is the psy-
chiatrist able to gain cognitive access to these experi-
ences? Through an empathic "re-presentation" ( Verge-
genwiirtigung) of them. In "RE-PRESENTATION" the ob-
ject ofwhich one is aware is not itself directly given; it 
is not itself directly present to one's mind. But the ob-
ject is experienced as if it were itself directly given, as 
if it were directly present. In re-presentation I examine 
the object of my awareness as if it were directly given 
to me although in actual fact it is not. 
But if the object is not in fact directly given to me 
in re-presentation, how can Jaspers require that such 
re-presentation be "intuitive" (anschaulich )? Although 
Husserl developed his own technical sense ofthe term, 
Anschauung in German sometimes carries the conno-
tation of"experiencing an object in graphic detail." An 
intuitive experience thus differs from a non-intuitive 
experience for Jaspers in that the latter re-presents its 

KARL JASPERS 
373 
object vaguely and indistinctly while in the former 
the object is re-presented distinctly and graphically. 
When the psychiatrist "intuitively re-presents" to him-
or herself the experiences of patients, these patholog-
ical experiences are not and cannot themselves be di-
rectly given to the psychiatrist. But the psychiatrist 
must graphically re-present them to him- or herself in 
great detail as if they were directly given. Intuitive re-
presentation is the closest one person can come to the 
"direct presentation" of another person 's experiences. 
How can the psychiatrist begin to attain this dis-
tinct, detailed, and graphic re-presentation of a patient's 
experiences? Jaspers claims that the best help for at-
taining these re-presentations comes from the patient's 
own self-depictions (Selbstschilderungen). These self-
depictions can be provoked and tested in conversa-
tion with the patient. Moreover, the clearest and most 
complete self-depictions by patients are written ones. 
Jaspers is convinccd that the person who has the experi-
ence is the o ne who can most easily find the appropriatc 
depiction of it. The psychiatrist who merely observes 
the patient would struggle in vain to formulate what 
the patient can say about his or her own experience. 
Because it is patients, and not psychiatrists, who 
alone can directly observe pathological experiences 
through self-reflection, psychiatrists must rely on 
patients' communications. Psychiatrists should, of 
course, continually test the credibility of patients as 
well as their powers of judgment. And Jaspers is cog-
nizant of the mistakes the psychiatrist can make in 
accepting a patient's statements as all too reliable. But 
Jaspers also warns ofthe reverse mistake ofremaining 
radically skeptical of patients' reports. 
Jaspers follows Husserl 's method in the Logis-
che Untersuchungen in a further step: Jaspers main-
tains that the phenomenological method must remain 
"presuppositionless" (vorurteilslosig). The Jaspersian 
phenomenologist is not permitted to ascribe to the pa-
tient anything he or she is not actually experiencing. 
Jaspers writes, "Only that which actually exists in (the 
patient's) mental life should be re-presented; every-
thing that is not actually given in (the patient's) mental 
life does not exist." Under the influence of Husserl, 
Jaspers wants to do full justice to what the patient is 
actually experiencing; he does not want to overlook any 
real features, however complex, of the patient's expe-
riences. Yet at the same time, Jaspers does not want to 
impute to the patient anything that he or she does not 
actually experience; he wishes to describe exclusively 
what is present in the patient's own lived experience. 
This is precisely what Husserl 's "descriptive pheno-
menology" had sought to do: to describe the features 
of mental processes .fully but exclusively as they are 
lived through by the experiencing subject. This means 
that it would be erroneous to postulate the efficacy of 
causes, motives, or other origins ofthe patient's expe-
riences unless those causes or motives are themselves 
actual mental processes of the patient. This is why, 
for Jaspers as for Husserl, concepts and theories taken 
over from prior sources pose dangers. 
Concepts and theories carry connotations and im-
plications that may not apply to the real experiences of 
a particular patient or of any patient at ali. As Jaspers 
writes, 
"We must set asi de ali received theories, psycholog-
ical constructions, or materialist mythologies of brain 
processes. We must apply ourselves purely to what we 
can understand, apprehend, distinguish, and describe 
in its actual existence." He is here guarding against an 
"explanatory" psychopathology that would postulate 
underlying mechanisms that are not themselves expe-
rienced by the patient but are nevertheless supposed 
to produce what the patient does experience. A "de-
scriptive" psychopathology is distinguished from such 
an explanatory psychopathology because the former 
restricts itself to explicating the patient's experiences 
precisely and exclusively as the patient actually lives 
through them. For this reason, the phenomenological 
psychiatrist must employ a sort of EPOCHE AND REDUC-
TION to bracket or set asi de ali interpretations (Deutun-
gen) and prejudgments (Beurteilungen) and purely de-
scribe what is actually occurring in the patient's mental 
life. 
Jaspers acknowledges that achieving this prejudg-
ment-less attitude is not simple or easy. He warns, "As 
experience teaches us, this is a very difficult task. This 
peculiarly phenomenological presuppositionlessness is 
not an original possession. It is rather a laborious acqui-
sition after long critica! work and often futile efforts in 
constructions and mythologies. Just like we as children 
first draw things not as we see them but rather as we 
think them, so we as psychologists and psychopathol-
ogists go through a stage in which we somehow think 
mental processes to the stage of a presuppositionless, 

374 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
immediate apprehending of mental processes just as 
they are. Always renewed efforts are required, and we 
must repeatedly overcome prejudgments in order to 
earn this prize ( Gut): this phenomenological attitude." 
Jaspers' phenomenology is thus "presupposition-
less" in the sense that it does not impute features to 
mental processes just because some theory or set of 
concepts implies those features. It rather ascribes fea-
tures to mental processes only if those features can be 
intuitively re-presented on the basis ofthe evidence of 
the patient's speech or behavior. 
Later in the Allgemeine Psychopathologie Jaspers 
introduces additional methods to deal with aspects of 
the patient's life that phenomenology systematically 
"brackets" or sets asi de. He then describes ( 1) a "psy-
chology of understanding" (verstehende Psychologie) 
that will furnish scientific access to the various motives 
or meaningful sources ofthe patient's experiences; (2) 
an "explanatory psychology" ( erklărende Psychologie) 
that will investigate causal mechanisms that shape ex-
perience; (3) a "somatopsychology" for studying bod-
ily events in the patient that can be seen or detected by 
an outside observer; and ( 4) methods for intepreting the 
objective expressions or products ofthe patient's men-
tallife. But prior to the employment ofthese methods, 
Jaspers deems it essential to appreciate the patient's 
actual experiences cautiously and fully and not to leap 
precipitously beyond what the patient is actually living 
through. 
Why does Jaspers in his phenomenology empha-
size this descriptive procedure free from preestablished 
concepts,judgments, and theories? Ifthere are tobe any 
useful concepts in psychopathology, they must be built 
on a sound basis in EVIDENCE. Any psychopathological 
concepts that do not pay strict attention to the details, 
subtleties, and nuances of patients' experiences will 
fail to do full justice to its subject matter. Moreover, 
psychopathological concepts that imply more than is 
actually present in the patient's own lived experience 
cannot serve as a reliable foundation for theory for-
mation. Jaspers thinks, accordingly, that the evidential 
basis for any conceptual constructs in psychopathol-
ogy must be phenomenological; i.e., the evidential base 
must be a graphic and detailed re-presentation of the 
manifold features ofpatients' pathological experiences 
precisely as the patient lives through them. 
Intuitive re-presentation, while remaining a form 
of understanding and empathy, is the closest the psy-
chopathologist can come to direct observation of his 
or her subject matter. As Jaspers writes, "For the re-
presentation ( Vergegenwărtigung) of ali of these phe-
nomenologically ultima te qualities 1 ha ve already used 
severa) expressions like seeing, intuiting, empathizing, 
understanding, and the like. With ali of these expres-
sions 1 mean for the same ultimate experience to be 
understood. It is this experience which alone fulfills 
our concepts. It is this experience which in the psycho-
logical domain plays the same ro le as sense perception 
does in the natural scientific domain." 
Jaspers requires that psychopathology develop this 
phenomenology ofits basic concepts because he is wor-
ried that psychiatrists, when they interview patients, 
will rest content with only a vague, indefinite, and 
indeterminate awareness of the patients' experiences. 
Jaspers worries, in other words, that psychiatrists will 
content themselves with merely an awareness of the 
pregiven meanings of concepts and theories that the pa-
tients' reports bring to mind. What Jaspers demands, by 
contrast, is a detailed, definite, and graphic awareness 
of the experiences that patients actually undergo, and 
this detailed and graphic psychiatric awareness must 
be firmly based on what the patient says and how the 
patient acts. Jaspers expresses ali of this quite clearly 
himself: "In histology it is required that, when examin-
ing the cerebral cortex, we should account for each fiber 
and each ce li. Phenomenology places upon us entirely 
analogous demands: we should accountfor each men-
tal phenomenon, each experience which comes to light 
in the exploration of patients and their self-depictions. 
We should in no case remain satisfied with a global im-
pression ( Gesamteindruck) and a few details selected 
ad hoc, but we should know each single particularity 
and how to apprehend and judge it." 
In conclusion, we shall simply list those features 
shared by Husserl 's and Jaspers' phenomenologies and 
then those features with regard to which they differ. 
First, the shared features: ( 1) The phenomenologist de-
scribes mental processes fully and exclusively as they 
are lived through by the person whose mental life is 
under investigation. (2) The definition of phenomen-
ological concepts is based exclusively on the intuition 
of the phenomena that the concepts designate. This 
is what makes phenomenology "descriptive." (Nega-
tively stated: phenomenological concepts never refer 

KARL JASPERS 
375 
to mental processes that cannot be intuited; i.e., pheno-
menological concepts never refer to mental processes 
whose existence and features can only be inferred.) (3) 
Phenomenology "brackets" or sets aside ali explana-
tory theories of mental life insofar as these theories 
refer to explanatory factors that are not themselves ex-
perienced by the person whose mental life is under 
study. This is what renders phenomenology "presup-
positionless." 
The differences between Husserl 's and Jaspers' phe-
nomenologies consist in the following: ( 1) The con-
cepts developed by the Husserlian phenomenologist 
are essential concepts while the concepts defined by the 
Jaspersian phenomenologist are empirica! concepts. 
Husserl's phenomenology is an eidetic philosophy; 
Jaspers' phenomenology is an empirica! science. (2) 
The Husserlian phenomenologist takes his or her own 
mental life as one example (among many other possi-
ble examples) of mental life in general. The Husser-
lian phenomenologist thus emphasizes self-reflection. 
The Jaspersian phenomenologist studies psychiatric 
patients as individual examples of psychopathological 
mentallife in general. The Jaspersian phenomenologist 
therefore employs empathy and understanding (Versle-
hen). (3) Husserl 's methodological notion of"originary 
intuition" is the notion of a direct, self-reflective, and 
detailed presentation by the phenomenologist of the 
mental processes under study. Jaspers' notion of "in-
tuition" is the notion of a less direct, empathetic, and 
detailed re-presentation by the phenomenologist ofthe 
mental processes under study. 
In addition to adopting components of Husserl's 
method in Logische Untersuchungen, Jaspers also em-
ployed the phenomenological notion of intentionality 
in analyzing patients' pathological experiences. In A ll-
gemeine Psychopathologie Jaspers writes, "In percep-
tions as well as representations ( Vorstellungen) we dis-
tinguish three elements: the sens01y material (e.g., red, 
blue, the pitch of a sound, etc.), spatial and temporal or-
der, and the intentionat act (the intending directedness 
to something, the objectification). The sensory material 
is animated (heseelt) through the act and first attains 
through it the objectivity of its meaning." In his ensu-
ing descriptions of patients' experiences Jaspers shows 
how each of these three elements of intentionality can 
assume abnormal forms. 
Jaspers could make productive use of Husserlian 
phenomenology as long as he regarded it as an em-
pirica! (scientific) descriptive psychology. When he 
found Husserl portraying it as a philosophy, how-
ever, Jaspers dissented. He reacted strongly against 
Husserl 's "Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft" 
( 1911 ). In this essay he saw an emphatic requirement 
that philosophy seek to imitate the sciences by provid-
ing equally compelling and verifiable knowledge. Tak-
ing a position that was almost the reverse of Husserl 's, 
Jaspers contended that any attempt to make philosophy 
"scientific" violated its true nature as this had come to 
fruition in the great philosophies of the past. He thus 
regarded himself as having to shoulder the burden of 
defending genuine philosophizing against those who, 
like Husserl and the neo-Kantians, thought they were 
salvaging the respectability ofphilosophy by making it 
comparable to science when they were in fact thereby 
distorting and betraying it. In spite of his lack of for-
mal training in the field, Jaspers decided to become a 
philosopher. 
Jaspers educated himself by studying Descartes, 
Spinoza, Kant, Hegel, Schelling, Kierkegaard, and Ni-
etzsche, among others. He found a natural bridge from 
psychiatry to philosophy in the "psychology ofthe un-
derstanding" ( verstehende Psychologie) that he had de-
veloped in his Allgemeine P.1ychopathologie, primar-
ily on the hasis of Dilthey's descriptive psychology. 
lndeed, it seems that Dilthey's influence was strong 
when Jaspers wrote Psychologie der Weltanschauun-
gen ( 1919). This volume contains some ofthe concepts 
and patterns ofthought that shaped Jaspers' subsequent 
philosophy of existence. MARTIN HEIDEGGER 's lengthy 
review ofthis book remains important. 
As Jaspers developed his philosophy, he moved far-
ther and farther away from his early roots in Husserlian 
phenomenology. It may justifiably be said, however, 
that Jaspers' Philosophie ( 1932) sti li owes much to the 
skills he had acquired in carrying out phenomenologi-
cal descriptions in his psychiatric writings. And even 
in Jaspers' !ater works, such as Von der Wahrheit (On 
truth, 194 7), his interest in delineating different meth-
ods of thought remained central. Finally, despite his 
antipathy to Husserlian phenomenology as a model for 
philosophical thinking, Jaspers managed to find useful 
roles for some Husserlian concepts, such as intention-
ality, in his Die grossen Philosophen, voi. 1 (The great 
philosophers, 1957).

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Jaspers' writings on phenomenological psychother-
apy influenced psychiatrists between the wars in GER-
MANY, Switzerland, FRANCE, and other European coun-
tries. Indeed, these writings served as the first to 
demonstrate the fruitfulness of adapting Husserlian 
phenomenology to methodological and substantive is-
sues in PSYCHIATRY. The relatively recent appearance 
of an English translation of Jaspers' General Psy-
chopathology ( 1963) has meant that this work has in-
fluenced only the last two generations of English and 
American psychiatrists. Already, however, the book's 
impact is widespread, especially in England. In the 
UNITED STATES, the teaching and publications of Paul 
R. McHugh and Phillip R. Slavney in particular have 
helped to disseminate, update, and apply the Jaspersian 
approach. It is important to remember, however, that 
Jaspers utilized only Husserl 's Logische Untersuchun-
gen. It would fali to succeeding psychiatrists, psychol-
ogists, and philosophers to establish connections be-
tween psychopathology and Husserl 's )ater thought.

IMMANUEL KANT 
Two points of view on 
Kant ha ve served as catalysts for the critica) reconstruc-
tion of his philosophy in phenomenology. Both oper-
ate with Kant's transcendentalism, which is knowledge 
concerned not with objects, but with our a priori mode 
of knowledge of objects. One serves as the catalyst for 
EDMUND HUSSERL's critica! considerations of Kant, the 
other as the catalyst for MARTIN HEIDEGGER 's. In the first, 
the focus is on the grounding of NATURAL SCIENCE; in the 
second, the focus is on the grounding of metaphysics, 
not in the knowledge of the sensible world, but in the 
realm of free rational agency. 
Husserl contends that without phenomenological re-
construction, Kant's transcendentalism remains strin-
gently bound to the conditions ofscientific knowledge. 
He then broadens transcendentalism phenomenologi-
cally to include prescientific experience and the sub-
ject's own intentiona) awareness, whose reasonable-
ness is sustained in and by perception. Heidegger main-
tains that without reconstruction, Kant's grounding of 
metaphysics is tethered too strongly to subjectivis-
tic formulations and hence mistakenly identifies that 
which enables what we caii experience. He seeks to 
transform transcendentalism by referring to the Lich-
tung ( clearing) that enables anything-object, the sub-
ject, and his or her representationallvolitional activities 
-
to be disclosed as conditions at ali. The "clearing" 
is a non-representational horizon enabling both expe-
rience and its conditions to appear "for a time." 
Ali this reflects Husserl 's and Heidegger's concern 
with the Kritik der reinen Vernunft (1781/1787). To 
some extent, their phenomenological reconstructions 
converge. But ultimately, they produce influential Kant 
interpretations that diverge from each other. The rest 
ofthe "phenomenological movement" takes its cues on 
Kant from their approaches. Their interpretations also 
Jet them oppose the varieties of neo-Kantianism. For 
Husserl, neo-Kantianism rehabilitates transcendental-
ism in the face ofpsychologism, which reduces Kant's 
transcendentalism to the "facts of consciousness" and 
not to the subject's a priori conditions of experience. 
In other words, psychologism reduces the a priori el-
ements of experience to the psychical mechanism of 
the human species and subjects it to scientific observa-
tion. On the other hand, neo-Kantianism concentrates 
on the a priori presuppositions of mathematical natural 
science, but denies that they are intrinsic to conscious-
ness. Rather, they are logically pertinent to the con-
struction of objects in thought. So both psychologism 
and neo-Kantianism disavow that there are subjective 
sources that bear the a priori presuppositions of expe-
rience. 
It is Husserl 's doctrine of INTENTIONALITY that en-
ables access to those "subjective sources" by steering 
between the Scylla ofpsychologism and the Charybdis 
of neo-Kantianism. According to this doctrine, con-
sciousness is not representational, but essentially di-
rected toward objects, objects that thus stand in a tran-
scendent rather than immanent relation to it. Further-
more, acts of consciousness are directed toward objects 
via correlative ideal MEANINGS. Those acts are temporal, 
but their meaning-correlates ha ve the capacity ofbeing 
identified and reidentified over time. Ultimately these 
ideal meanings are accomplishments whose "origin" 
or "genesis" !ies in intentionallife. 
Husserl avoids the rocks of psychologism because 
he maintains that intentionality cannot be registered 
naturalistically as an item among other items in the 
causal order of nature. The method of EPOCHE AND RE-
DUCTION shows consciousness tobe a "region" indepen-
dent of the "region" of "nature." In contrast, natural-
istically driven psychologism reduces consciousness 
either to nature or some part thereof and holds that 
consciousness is subject to causal laws. Husserl also 
bypasses Neo-Kantian constructivism. Intentiona! ob-
jects are not logically constructed by consciousness in 
thought, but instead are rendered present to conscious-
ness by virtue of intentionality. Intentionality enables 
meanings or intentiona) objects to be given as intel-
ligible and essential structures within the conscious 
experience. For example, a perceptual act would be es-
sentially identified by its passive character; the object 
perceived would be essentially given as something out 
there in the world and indistinct from its sense. In con-
trast, a propositional act would be essentially charac-
terized by its expressible quality; the object expressed

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
(the meaning) and the object that the proposition is 
about would be rendered distinct in such an act. 
Intentionality as noetic-noematic correlation and as 
constitution signals Husserl 's fidelity to Kant's tran-
scendentalism and "Copernican turn." ARON GURWITSCH 
claims that Kant fa ils to recognize intentionality. How-
ever, others contend that Kant either operated with or 
anticipated a doctrine of directedness toward objects. 
Husserl himself believed Kant could anticipate inten-
tionality as both correlation and constitution, but was 
unable to give it express philosophical treatment. In 
Erste Philosophie [ 1923/24], he understands Kant's 
"Copernican turn" to consist in the determination of 
the sense of objectivity on the basis of the "correla-
tion between subjectivity and objective content," but 
believes Kant did not go deep enough in his analysis 
ofthis correlation. 
Regarding prescientific nature, Husserl challenges 
Kant's failure to formulate more sharply an account of 
consciousness "naively" heeding what is already tacitly 
organized, experientially significant, and contextually 
"sedimented" in the LIFEWORl.D and for PERCFPTION. He 
maintains that prescientific nature operates only "la-
tently" in Kant and thus it requires reconstruction. In 
Die Krisis der europdischen Wissenschaften und die 
transzendentale Phdnomenologie ( 1936), he takes his 
point of departure from Kant's 1781 "Transcenden-
tal Deduction." To show a theory of constitution and 
of prescientific nature in Kant, Husserl combines two 
readings of the "Deduction," each with two distinct 
proofs. One reading contends that the "Deduction" 
contains both "an objective deduction and a subjec-
tive one"; the other states that the deduction includes a 
proof"from above" and a proof"from below." The for-
mer regards the "objective deduction" as establishing 
the objective validity ofthe categories and the "subjec-
tive deduction" as establishing the manner in which the 
categories achieve that validity in relation to our cog-
nitive capacities. The latter reading offers two demon-
strations of how the relation between the categories 
and sensible intuitions can be established -
either 
from apperception through imagination to sensibility 
or from sensibility through imagination to appercep-
tion. On this reading, the imagination both coordinates 
the employment of the categories and facilitates the 
direction ofthat employment. 
No Kant scholar before or since combines both of 
these readings. By combining them, however, Husserl 
is able to reconstruct a hierarchical sequence of con-
stitution in Kant. The "objective and subjective deduc-
tions" enable Husserl to reconstruct the two functions 
of the understanding as two levels of intentiona! ac-
complishment. The "deduction from above and from 
below" allows him to re late these levels hierarchically, 
so that the scientific view, resulting from the under-
standing's functioning at the objective level, is shown 
to arise from the understanding operating passively, 
constituting the already organized and always devel-
oping sense ofthe lifeworld. 
Husserl recognizes that the "lifeworldly" structures 
cannot be expressly part of Kant's own theoretical en-
terprise for two reasons. First, his own notion of tran-
scendental subjectivity is registered in his discussion of 
constitution, and not in the metaphysically paralogistic 
orientation of pure reason. It is not entangled in some 
kind of double-world account, nor is it involved in jus-
tifying the objective validity of the a priori conditions 
of empirica! knowledge. Rather, it entails the spectrum 
of intentionality through which ali levels of meanings 
-
from higher-order idealizations of intellectual ac-
tivity to lower-order vague typicalities of lifeworld1y 
experience- are thematized. Unlike Kant's, Husserl 's 
notion of transcendental subjectivity is notat odds with 
empirica! subjectivity; rather, it is at one with it insofar 
as empirica! subjectivity is its unreflective yet inten-
tiona! life. 
The second reason has to do with Kant's concept 
of "formal intuition," i.e., an intuitive representation 
in which mathematical concepts can be constructed. 
Since a priori concepts of the understanding are not 
mathematical and hence not the result of idealization, 
they cannot be constructed or exhibited in a formal 
intuition. But they can be schematized. In that case, a 
formal intuition as a schema is an intuitive setting for 
making possible the temporal determination of sensi-
ble objects or empirica! intuitions in accordance with a 
priori concepts. It is a representation oftime that serves 
as an a priori condition for intuitively construing phe-
nomena as categorially objective, public phenomena 
in the spatiotemporal world and not as ad hoc psycho-
logical arrangements of mental states in an individ-
ual mind. But this non-mathematical yet objective and 
public world, of which Kant sought the conditions of 
knowledge, would not be equivalent to Husserl 's "life-

IMMANUEL KANT 
379 
world," since it would not be either the pre-objective 
aisthetic world of perceptual experience or the indeter-
minate yet ubiquitous horizon within which ali other 
worlds, scientific and prescientific, objective and pre-
objective, are disclosed. GERHARD FUNKE, ARON GUR-
WITSCH, ISO KERN, PAUL RICCEUR, and THOMAS M. SEEBOHM 
ha ve explored these and other aspects of Husserl 's re-
lation to Kant. 
Despite his criticism of Kant's sharp distinction 
between sensibility (receptivity) and understanding 
(spontaneity), Husserl views his own doctrine ofinten-
tionality as generally compatible with Kant's "Coperni-
can turn." In Husserl 's order of constitution, receptivity 
and spontaneity "dovetail" in a concrete colligation of 
intentionality, whcrein each stands with its correlate 
and refers beyond the temporal horizon of its corre-
late's mode of givenness to the temporal background 
of the modes of givenness of other correlates. The re-
suit, Husserl believes, enables him to account for the 
sense-history of theoretical knowledge or judgments. 
Unlike Husserl's, Heidegger's interpretation of 
Kant, especially in Kant und das Problem der Meta-
physik ( 1929), falls squarely on the "Schematism," 
whose argument presupposes the Kantian distinction 
between sensibility and understanding. This focus 
scrves the purpose of reconstructing Kant not as an 
incipient theorist of intentionality as constitution, but 
as an incipient theorist of"ecstatic temporality." 
In Sein und Zeit ( 1927), Heidegger argues that TIME 
does not consist of a stream of"nows" and is not itself 
an entity that is objectively there in the present. Rather, 
it is a horizon of the understanding of Being in which 
past, present, and future are the temporalizations of 
DASEIN. Heidegger's phenomenological ontology con-
strues the meaning of Being in terms of Oase in 's un-
derstanding ofBeing. Temporality in general is futural 
and can only be understood in terms of the situation 
in which Dasein confronts (a) the range of choices re-
gard ing the way it wants to carry out or to be its being 
and (b) the fact that Oase in has to carry out or be its 
being as its being is given to it. 
In Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik, Heideg-
ger again approaches time from the stance of Dasein, 
and in so doing, interprets the Kritik der reinen Ver-
nunft as Kant's unwitting or incipient identification of 
time and the unity of apperception. As a consequence, 
human subjectivity is shown to be fundamentally tem-
poral. Sin ce the "Schematism" offers the "sensible con-
ditions under which alone pure concepts of the under-
standing can be employed," it signals the place where 
Kant explains the results ofthe transcendental synthe-
sis of the imagination, whereby time is related to the 
objects of experience. Heidegger thus contends that a 
schema, or what Kant calls a "transcendental determi-
nation of time," is the horizon of constant presence in 
which an object is revealed as present. 
Although this places the objective character of ob-
jects in direct and essential connection with the finitude 
ofthe subject, the "Schematism" still does not charac-
terize temporality in what Heidegger believes is its 
more primordial sense. Heidegger maintains that tran-
scendental imagination is, for Kant, the concealed root 
of both sensibility and the understanding. lf Kant had 
followed this insight and explicitly identified transcen-
dental imagination with temporality, then temporality 
would be the condition on which the appearance of ob-
jects continually comes to pass as having been in the 
offing. Furthermore, as temporal, the finite subject is 
one whose being affected by the appearance of objects 
is always already in the offing. 
Heidegger concedes that his reconstruction concen-
trates on the 1781 or "A" edition of the Kritik and that 
such a reconstruction of the 1787 or "B" edition is 
nigh impossible. Since the 1787 version of the "De-
duction" seems to deny any paramount distinction be-
tween the imagination and the understanding, referring 
to the imagination as an "action of the understanding 
on the sensibility" oras belonging to "o ne and the same 
spontaneity" of the understanding, the primacy of the 
imagination, Heidegger believes, is surrendered there 
in fa vor of the understanding. Hen ce the source of ali 
synthetic activity is no longer the imagination, but the 
understanding. This represents, according to Heideg-
ger, Kant's "shrinking back" or "recoiling" from the 
"power of the imagination" in discursive thought, a 
power that rcnders discursive thought radically tempo-
ral and finite and that serves as the essential ground for 
Kant's "metaphysics of experience." 
But just as Heidegger reformulates the 1781 Kritik 
as an incipient precursor to Sein und Zeit, it is also pos-
sible to do likewise for the claims about the imagination 
according to the "two-steps-in-one proof structure" of 
the 1787 vers ion. Instead of claiming that the unity of 
apperception logically implies the unity of time, we 

380 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
can argue from thc determination or objectification of 
the unity oftime to the unity ofapperception. Since the 
determination of time is a result of the transcendental 
synthesis of the imagination, it must conform to the 
categories. If it did not, it could not be objectified as 
a unity. Since the categories are the necessary condi-
tions ofthe unity ofapperception (according to the first 
step ), the transcendental synthesis of the imagination 
necessarily conforms to the categories. However, since 
time is a formal a priori condition of ali appearances 
whatsoever, the items of the sensible manifold can be 
objectified together anly ta the extent that they are con-
nected to o ne another in a single time. Thus they can be 
conceptualized together in a single consciousness anly 
when they are given as connected in a single time (ac-
cording to the second step ). The unity of time thereby 
becomes a necessary condition of the possibility of 
human experience. But it is a condition established 
outside of apperception, although exacted upon apper-
ception, and hence serves to "restrict" it. This would 
be the kind of conclusion Heidegger would seek. 
Heidegger !ater proceeds with his interpretation of 
Kant in the context ofhis renowned Kehre. Although 
he continues to read Kant in terms of the ground-
ing of metaphysics, there is a shift whereby his mea-
sure is no longer the meaning of Being as a proto-
existentially impending issue for Dasein, but rather 
the meaning of Being as the "clearing." Die Frage 
nach dem Ding. Zu Kants Lehre van den transzenden-
talen Grundsătzen ( 1962) and "Kants These liber das 
Sein" ( 1963) are representative, though these are writ-
ten drafts oflectures originally given in the 1930s. Hei-
degger's "Briefe liber den Humanismus" (1947) offi.-
cially signals the appearance ofthe Kehre; however, the 
shift actually takes place in his writings ofthe 1930s, 
albeit without the !ater more "poetic" cast. The same 
is not true for his posthumous Die Grundprobleme 
der Phănamenalagie [ 1927] and Phănamenologische 
!nte1pretation van Kants Kritik der reinen Vernunft 
[ 1927 /28], which are pre-Kehre works. 
Prior to the Kehre, Heidegger's FUNDAMENTAL ON-
TOLOGY attempts to disclose the meaning of Being 
through an analysis of the structures or "existential ia" 
of Dasein. Subsequent to it, he asks how the meaning 
of Being is revealed by virtue of the way in which it 
is thought in the ancient, medieval, and modern meta-
physics of the "West." When Heidegger's Kant inter-
pretation is placed in this post-Kehre context, !here is 
less interest in reconstructing the first Kritik in terms 
of Dasein's temporality. As part of modern thought, 
this work is under the sway of"Western" metaphysics, 
because the "clearing" remains "unthought" in it and 
it understands Being as something subject to represen-
tational thought. 
In Die Frage nach dem Ding, the supreme principle 
ofKant's metaphysics of experience-"the conditions 
of the possibility of experience in general are likewise 
conditions of the possibility of the ohjects of experi-
ence" -- is for Heidegger Being as constant presence 
and as representational because what counts for things 
being objects of experience is their being known or rep-
resented. To be represented requires being present to 
and for the subject engaged in representing or knowing. 
Thus according to Heidegger, Kant conceives objectiv-
ity as the Being of ali things that can be experienced, 
known, or represented by the subject. He regards Kant 
as exclusively concerned with the ro le of pure concepts 
in the mathematical character of natural bodies present 
in space, and not with time as the condition of their 
application to ali appearances whatsoever. 
In "Kants These liber das Sein," Heidegger argues 
that Kant's thesis about Being, which normally appears 
episodically throughout his work, is actually a guiding 
idea ofthe first Kritik. Heidegger interprets Kant's first 
claim -
"'Being' is obviously not a real predicate, 
i.e., it is not a concept of something which could be 
added to the concept of a thing"- as distinguishing 
"reality" from "existence," "actuality," and "being." 
If "Being" were a real predicate, then it would serve 
as a determination belonging to the substantive or real 
content of a thing and could be attributed to that content 
in ajudgment. But since the real or substantive content 
of a thing can be thought in a concept without the thing 
existing before us, the thing's reality is not the thing's 
being or existence. 
Heidegger interprets Kant's second claim- "['Be-
ing'] is purely the positing of a thing, or of certain 
determinations in and of themselves" -
as asserting 
that, as a predicate nonetheless, Being does not predi-
cate substantivally what a thing is; it rather predicates 
modally that a thing is. The meaning of Being for 
Kant, according to Heidegger, is not real predication. 
It is positing modally. Positing, Heidegger says, is for 
Kant the establishment of something as existing by 

JMMANUEL KANT 
381 
virtue of a subject engaged in representation. In setting 
up something as possibly, actually, or necessarily ex-
isting, Being as positing essentially stands for Kant in 
relation to the representational capacities of the sub-
ject. (Again Heidegger draws the conclusion that Kant 
endorses the thesis of Being as representational, but 
he does so without explicitly considering how Kant 
could or did explain the role oftime in Being's pasit-
ing, especially in terms of the very strong connection 
Kant initiates between the schema of modality and the 
"Postulates of Empirica! Thought.") 
Temporality is thus criterial for Heidegger in in-
terpreting the kind and degree of success or failure 
the first Kritik has in addressing the meaning of Se-
ing and the grounding of metaphysics. In Kant und 
das Problem der Metaphysik, he finds in Kant the ele-
ments for a successful inquiry. In !ater works, he thinks 
Kant's pathway is closed. What makes the difference 
for Heidegger between Kant's success and failure is his 
openness to temporality. This openness is signalled by 
the possibility of giving greater emphasis to the self-
affection of human reason through the integral unity 
of the modalities of time than to the self-reflection of 
human reason through conceptual or representational 
thought. IfKant's analysis ofhuman experience is read 
as giving greater weight to the conceptual dimension 
ofthat experience, then he is approaching it, Heidegger 
believes, in a way that allows the meaning ofBeing to 
be "forgotten" in the history of Western metaphysics. 
Heidegger points human reason to a level of experi-
ence whereby the impact of sensibility, affection, and 
intuition on it, through time's integral unity, enables 
the meaning of Being to be an issue "taken to heart" 
by it in a distinctly non-representational manner. 
On this point, Heideggerian phenomenology is of a 
piece with Husserlian phenomenology. Husserl sees in 
Kant an incipient phenomenologist whose analysis of 
human experience could have moved in the direction 
of thematizing the non-representational or lifeworldly 
dimension. Kant is measured against this phenomen-
ological ability in both Heidegger's and Husserl's in-
terpretations, and this is reflected in the work of phe-
nomenologists as diverse as MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY 
with his emphasis on the a priori of BODILY intention-
ality and MAX SCHELER with his critique of Kantian 
formalism in ethics. 
Ultimately, however, there is a major difference be-
tween Husserl and Heidegger with respect to the non-
representational domain. Husserl 's phenomenology 
leads to the reflective incorporation of that domain. 
He believes that this evinces his deep affinity with 
Kant's "Copernican turn" and transcendentalism. Hei-
degger 's phenomenology, on the other hand, abi des by 
what it discloses, viz., the affective incorporation of 
Dasein into that domain, what Heidegger carne to call 
the fourfold ( Geviert).

Kaufmann was horn 
in Vienna in 1895 and received a doctorate in law 
from the University of Vienna in 1920. His disserta-
tion under Hans Kelsen ( 1881-1973) was published 
in 1922 as Logik und Rechtswissenschaft (Logic and 
jurisprudence). This work led to his appointment as 
Privatdozent in philosophy of law with the juridica! 
faculty of the University of Vienna. While a student, 
Kaufmann introduced his fellow law student, ALFRED 
SCHUTZ, to the philosophy OfEDMUND HUSSERL. Through 
the years, Kaufmann and Schutz read and discussed a 
number of Husserl 's seminal phenomenological texts, 
including Vorlesungen zur Phi.inomenologie des in-
neren Zeitbewusstseins [ 1905], Formale und transzen-
dentale Logik ( 1929), and Cartesianische Meditatio-
nen [ 1931]. Kaufmann received a doctorate in philoso-
phy from the University ofVienna in 1922, publishing 
this dissertation in 1924 as Die Kriterien des Rechts 
(Criteria ofright). While serving as Privatdozent, Kauf-
mann earned his living by working as a manager for 
the Anglo-Persian Oii Company. Meanwhile, he par-
ticipated in a number of intellectual circles, including 
the circle surrounding Hans Kelsen; a private semi-
nar of Richard von Mises ( 1883-1953); and the group 
that was !ater to become known as the Vienna Circle 
(where he referred to himself as "his majesty's loyal 
opposition," to indicate his nonpositivist stance). 
When Germany invaded Austria in 1938, Kaufmann 
accepted an invitation to join the New School for So-
cial Research in New York, where he fled with his wife 
and son. He was a member ofthe Graduate Faculty of 
the New School and also served as a founding mem-
ber ofthe International Phenomenological Association 
and on the editorial board of Philosophy and Pheno-
menological Research until his death. From the UNITED 
STATES, Kaufmann labored to help others escape from 
the Nazis, and also was actively involved in the preser-
vation of Husserl 's manuscripts and the relief effort for 
EUGEN FINK and LUDWIG LANDGREBE. 
Kaufmann 's research ranged widely, including pub-
lications in philosophy of LAW, the foundations of 
LOGIC and MATHEMATICS, ECONOMICS, SOCIOLOGY, and 
the methodology of the HUMAN and the NATURAL SCI-
ENCES. In his main interests (law, mathematics, and 
scientific methodology) Kaufmann introduces and de-
velops methodological insights, based upon key con-
ceptual and experiential analyses in Husserl 's writings, 
to recast traditional and contemporary controversies 
and problems. In each case he argues that a phenomen-
ological foundation leads to a more fruitful account of 
the problems at hand, and to resolution for a number 
of traditional controversies. A champion of Husserl 's 
phenomenology in the Vienna Circle, Kaufmann's de-
bates with RudolfCarnap (1891-1973), Cari Gustav 
Hempel, and others led to decades-long exchanges of 
articles on the nature of MEANING and TRUTH, the foun-
dations ofmathematics and the social sciences, and the 
status oflaws, principles, and data in scientific inquiry 
in general. Kaufmann, who characterized himself as a 
"methodologist," always sought to clarify and to so-
lidify the logica! and experiential foundations of any 
inquiry. Husserl regarded him as one ofthe most com-
petent logicians in the phenomenological movement 
and as one of his most loyal friends, and Kaufmann 's

acclaim by a diverse array ofrespected contemporaries 
is noteworthy. Albert Einstein ( 1879-1955) regarded 
him as one ofthe great living philosophers. 
Kaufmann develops Hans Kelsen's pure theory of 
law (according to which the normative nature of laws 
and legal terms cannot be derived from facts alone, 
since norms belong to a different "sphere") from its 
Kantian basis to a view based on a phenomenological 
analysis ofthe concept ofnorms. This analysis denies 
the existence of a separate "normative sphere" requir-
ing a peculiarly normative method. He also applies 
a phenomenological approach to key legal concepts, 
such as that of responsibility in criminal law. 
Kaufmann's Das Unendliche in der Mathematik 
und seine Ausschaltung (The infinite in mathematics 
and its exclusion, 1930) was regarded by Husserl as 
a major contribution to the phenomenology of math-
ematics, and engendered a great deal of interes! and 
discussion among the members of the Vienna Circle. 
In this and related works, Kaufmann develops a con-
structivist approach to the foundations ofmathematics 
based upon a phenomenological account of the basic 
facts of cognition. This account includes discussion of 
the JNTENTIONALITY of mental life, the objectivity of 
logica! and mathematical concepts, the nature of es-
sential features of the objects of consciousness, and 
the difference between empirica] and non-empirica] 
universal statements -
the distinction between indi-
vidual and specific universality drawn by Husserl in 
the Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900--1901 ). From this 
basis various problems in the foundations ofmathemat-
ics are analyzed, including the set-theoretic interpreta-
tion of mathematics, the extended functional calculus, 
the Dedekind cut, Cantor's diagonal procedure, trans-
finite numbers, and a number of logica! antinomies in 
mathematics and set theory. In each case Kaufmann 
uses his phenomenological approach to reject various 
interpretations of mathematical and logica! notations, 
procedures, and problems. 
Many of these problems are seen to stern from two 
methodological errors: interpreting symbols as repre-
senting sets of objects, when in fact they represent 
formation laws and not objects, and misunderstanding 
the nature of(and cquivocating between) empirica! and 
non-empirica! universal statements. The set-theoretic 
account of mathematics is rejected, and the concept 
of "set" is argued to be completely unnecessary for 
the definition ofthe natural number series. Kaufmann 
also rejects transfinite numbers and non-denumerable 
infinite sets, which he claims to be impure (because 
ambiguous and circular) pseudo-concepts. The natural 
numbers are defined as formal eidetic singularities (in 
Husserl's sense), and Peano's axioms are modified to 
clarify the definition of natural numbers. AII of math-
ematics flows from the definitions ofthe natural num-
bers and keeping this clearly in focus enables one to 
avoid many of the logica! antinomies of mathematics. 
While taking a constructivist position, Kaufmann also 
criticizes the tendencies toward PSYCHOLOGISM ofsome 
other constructivist mathematicians, such as Luitzen 
Egbertus Jan Brouwer ( 1881-1966). 
Kaufmann holds that methodology (which he de-
fines as the logica! analysis of scientific procedure) 
deserves the status of a separate field, independent of 
logic, whose goal is to explicate and clarify the rules, 
laws, postulates, and procedures of the social or hu-
man sciences and natural sciences. Central to this role 
is methodology's goal of clarifying the procedures for 
verifying and falsifying scientific claims. For Kauf-
mann, methodology presupposes objective MEANINGS 
that are already constituted (logica! analysis is the 
analysis of meanings, according to Kaufmann); thus 
methodology presupposes phenomenological analyses 
oflived meanings. Many ofhis methodological analy-
ses begin with explicit phenomenological analyses of 
basic scientific and prescientific terms and concepts. 
Kaufmann discusses a number of methodological is-
sues stemming from the social sciences, as well as 
some ranging over ali the sciences, both natural and 
social. 
For Kaufmann the key to the methodology of the 
sciences !ies in viewing science as an ongoing and 
highly structured human enterprise that is based upon 
lived meanings stemming in part from ordinary, pre-
scientific experience. Indeed, Kaufmann holds that the 
prescientific and scientific realms share some basic em-
pirica! procedures, and are thus (at that level) not en-
tirely distinguishable. A science is defined not in terms 
of its objects of study, but in terms of its rules of pro-
cedure. Although Kaufmann 's view of the structure of 
science went through development and modification, 
it is possible to find in his work a rather consistent 
set of the primary elements of scientific procedure: 
the ideals of science (such as truth, precision, and the 

384 
ENCYCLOPED!A OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ideal of a rational, and therefore knowable, cosmos 
-
these ideals serve as regulati ve ideas of science in 
Kant's sense); the basic rules of scientific procedure 
(unrelated to goals, these provide the criteria for the 
truth and falsity of propositions); preference rules of 
scientific procedure (related to scientific goals, hav-
ing the status of conventional norms for the gathering, 
verification, falsification, and employing of empirica! 
evidence); heuristic postulates (having the status of 
conventions, not refutable by empirica! evidence, e.g., 
the principles of ceteris paribus and marginal utility 
in economics, free will in sociology, uniformity ofna-
ture in physics ); the scientific situation ( the state of a 
given field of inquiry at a particular time ); the impor-
tance of grounds (with protocol propositions playing 
key ro les as grounds); and the layers or strata ofhuman 
experience (including the distinction between presci-
entific and scientific strata of experience ). Kaufmann's 
methodology of the sciences studies and clarifies the 
ways in which these elements interact in the pursuit of 
scientific knowledge. 
The basic rules of science guide research in every 
science, but they are not a priori laws. Rather, they 
serve as regulative ideas (so as not to violate the prin-
ciple of permanent control). Methodology ofthe Social 
Sciences (1944) identifies seven basic rules of science. 
These rules are: scientific decision (the basic decision 
in scientific research is that of adding or deleting propo-
sitions from the corpus of propositions belonging to 
a particular science); the methodological principle of 
sufficient reason (scientific decisions must be grounded 
in EVIDENCE and procedural rules); grounds (proposi-
tions recording sense observations must play a central 
role in evidence); scientific situation (a proposition be-
ing considered for addition to the scientific corpus must 
be judged in light ofthe totality of relevant knowledge 
available at the time of a scientific decision); the prin-
ciple of permanent control (no empirica! proposition is 
immune from rejection based on further evidence ); the 
procedural correlate ofthe principle of contradiction (a 
scientific decision may not admit any proposition to the 
scientific corpus that generates a contradiction in that 
corpus ); and the procedural correlate ofthe principle of 
the excluded middle (no undecidable proposition may 
be admitted into the corpus). 
Kaufmann traces many methodological problems 
( and the controversies surrounding them) to basic epis-
temological problems. Phenomenology plays a key 
role in sorting out and solving these problems. The 
issues of truth and knowledge are central to method-
ology. The concepts of "truth" and "verification" in 
science are defined in terms of coherence- a coher-
ence that can never be finally or ultimately established, 
and that is defined in terms of the rules of scientific 
procedure. Truth, knowledge, and probability must not 
be defined in terms of absolute or perfect knowledge. 
In spite of this, Kaufmann rejects RELATIVISM in its 
various guises (nominalism, sociologism, historicism, 
etc.). For him many ofthe methodological controver-
sies in the natural and the social sciences (for instance, 
the pervasive one between rationalism and empiricism) 
stern from a lack of clarity with respect to the status 
of the rules and postulates of science. These rules and 
postulates have the status ofnorms, and are not subject 
to the sort offalsification characterized by Karl Popper 
( 1902-1994 ). The reason for this is to be found in the 
scientific situation, in which rules, postulates, obser-
vations, mechanisms, and hypotheses are interrelated 
in an extremely complex fashion. An unexpected ex-
perimental result could stern from a faulty assumption 
about control parameters, an imperfection in a mecha-
nism or sample, or a false hypothesis. No experiment 
or observation taken by itself is sufficient to establish 
its own interpretation (the data cannot speak for them-
selves ). Kaufmann holds that scientific laws should not 
be interpreted as laws of nature but as laws relating ob-
servation to expectation, based on contemporary scien-
tific understanding and instrumentation. Thus even ba-
sic laws of physics such as the conservation of energy 
and the uniformity of nature are in essence heuristic 
postulates, rules guiding physicists in what to expect, 
and how to observe, in their experimental and theoret-
ical grappling with nature. Such postulates are subject 
to the principle of permanent control. 
Even logica! laws are often misunderstood in 
methodological controversies. For instance, Kaufmann 
argues that despite many claims to the contrary, the 
law ofthe excluded middle does not apply to synthetic 
propositions- its procedural correlate does (and this 
correlate is a property ofthe system of procedural rules 
of science, rules that determine how to proceed with 
a science, given the observational input and the con-
temporary scientific situation). Likewise, the concept 
of "ground" in science is related to the rules of sci-

FRIEDRICH LEOPOLD KAUFMANN

entific procedure and thus differs from the concept of 
"ground" in deductive logic. 
It is characteristic of Kaufmann 's work that his 
thought developed and changed. While his focus upon 
methodological and phenomenological issues and the 
clarity and precision of his thought and writing re-
mained steadfast, he continually refined his view. He 
published various lists of basic and procedural rules 
ofscience. His conception ofscience gradually shifted 
its emphasis from the side of logic ~ 
and the notion 
of science as a set of propositions and rules for ad-
mitting or rejecting propositions from the set ~ to 
science as a set of procedures and heuristic procedural 
rules. His reading of the work of John Dewey ( 1859-
1952), with whom he corresponded extensively in the 
!940s, contributed to a shift from stress upon deductive 
and a priori rules to a growing concern with inductive 
and probabilistic elements of scientific procedure. Al-
though Kaufmann 's work has been heretofore largely 
ignored, his methodological pluralism enabled him to 
assimilate ideas from many sources, and the insight, 
precision, and intellectual honesty ofhis work won the 
respect of thinkers as diverse as Edmund Husserl, Al-
fred Schutz, Albert Einstein, RudolfCarnap, and John 
Dewey.

FRITZ LEOPOLD KAUFMANN (1891-1958) 
Kauf-
mann is generally not well known to contemporary 
students of phenomenology and was not always un-
derstood by his contemporaries, but is actually one 
of the most innovative phenomenologists of the first 
generation. Kaufmann carne to phenomenology from 
the perspective of WILHELM DILTHEY's philosophy, with 
an eye to developing a "middle ground" or unity in-
corporating both philosophical positions. In doing so, 
he anticipatcd even MARTIN HEIDEGGER in viewing con-
sciousness as an essentially worldly phenomenon and 
the work of art as a world-revelatory phenomenon. 
Born in Leipzig, Kaufmann began his university 
career enrolled in the faculty of law at Geneva ( 191 O) 
and Berlin ( 191 ~Il). His interests quickly gravitated 
from law to philosophy. Only his unpublished and un-
submitted 1918 Leipzig Habilitationsschrift, entitled 

386 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Der Konflikt, conta ins material reflecting his legal stud-
ies. In Berlin, Kaufmann was quickly immersed in a 
philosophical tradition shared with EDMUND HUSSERL. 
He studied with Husserl 's former teacher Cari Stumpf 
(1848-1936) and with Benno Erdmann (1851-1921), 
among others. Both Erdmann and Stumpfstressed, al-
though quite differently to be sure, the relevance of 
psychology to philosophical investigation. From 1911 
to 1913, Kaufmann studied in Leipzig under Wil-
helm Wundt (1832-1920), Johannes Volkelt (1848-
1930) and Eduard Spranger ( 1882-1963). He was 
deeply indebted to Volkelt for introducing him to a 
metaphysically oriented aesthetics and especially to 
Spranger who, in his 1912 course, "Die Philosphie 
der Gegenwart," introduced Kaufmann to the philos-
ophy of Dilthey within the perspective of Husserl 's 
Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900--1901 ). The Dilthey-
Husserl connection is a key to understanding Kauf-
mann 's phenomenological orientation. 
Kaufmann studied with Husserl in Gottingen from 
April 1913 until the outbreak of the war in 1914. 
He came to study phenomenology, of course, but 
a phenomenology whose character and philosophi-
cal relevance he interpreted in a unique way. Even 
before he arrived in Gottingen, he did not inter-
pret phenomenology realistically, nor did he view 
Husserl's ldeen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913) as a retreat 
back into idealism. In both respects Kaufmann was 
unique in the Gottingen circle of Husserl's students. 
His interest in phenomenology was threefold. In the 
first place, he viewed Husserl 's "strengen Sachlichkeit" 
as an antidote to nea-Kantian system building. In the 
second place, he further interpreted Husserl 's rigorous 
method and insistence upon the constitutive function 
of consciousness and the correlation of subject and ab-
ject as the way to escape the traps of realism, idealism, 
and intuitionism. In the third place, and what most dis-
tinguishes Kaufmann the phenomenologist, is the fact 
that he saw Husserl 's 1913 constitutive analysis of con-
sciousness as a rigorous clarification and extension of 
Dilthey's interpretati an of historicallife. 
Already by 1913 Kaufmann was engaged in 
the phenomenological investigation of a historically 
viewed, embodied consciousness that can only be de-
scribed within the context ofthe world in which it finds 
itself. In a 1914 lecture on Kant's ethics, for example, 
he rejected both KANT's formalism and MAX SCHELER's 
intuitionism regarding values. He claimed that ethical 
values must be regarded as "meaning-elements of the 
everyday world which can only be understood within 
the context of that world." Moreover, as meaning-
elements of a historically viewed consciousness, values 
are accessible to phenomenological analysis. 
In Freiburg after the war Kaufmann continued his 
investigation of consciousness as a historical phe-
nomenon. While there, he met Heidegger for the first 
time. Although it would bea mistake to say that Kauf-
mann 's philosophical direction was altered by his en-
counter with the young Heidegger, it did intensify and 
focus his interest in historical consciousness in terms 
ofthe new structural analyses ofoASEIN and "being-in-
the-world." Heidegger's influence is clear in the first 
chapter ofKaufmann 's Freiburg dissertation, Das Bild-
werk als ăsthetisches Phănomen (The image as aes-
thetic phenomenon, 1924). lts three chapters progres-
sively deepen one 's insight into the consciousness of an 
artistic image in analyses that are existentially (Heideg-
ger), phenomenologically (Husserl), and finally histor-
ically (Dilthey) based. The dissertation sets out the ba-
sic ideas and subject matter that occupied Kaufmann 
throughout his life. His book on Thomas Mann ( 1957), 
the last major work that he completed during his life-
time, can be viewed as a mature expression of basic 
analyses and concepts already present in the 1924 the-
sis, applied this time to a particular artist and his work 
rather than to artistic consciousness in general. 
Kaufmann's philosophical vision is rooted in his 
passionate commitment to discovering the fundamen-
tal nature of reality. Above ali, he was in search of 
the TRUTH, and both the content and the form of his 
thinking are integral to this search as he conceived of 
it. Without understanding this, one cannot understand 
his writings or his life. His rejection of idealism and 
realism, his interest in the concept of representation, 
and his preoccupation with art and the artistic vision 
are ali motivated by that search. His interest in a mid-
dle ground between realism and idealism, Dilthey and 
Husserl, individual and universal must be understood 
in terms ofthe same motivation. 
Starting, as always, with historically determined 
consciousness, Kaufmann 's thesis examines the con-
stitutive process whereby the experience ofthe artistic 
representation causes a transformation of conscious-

KOREA 
ness and its intended object. In this transformational 
process the object of consciousness attains univer-
sal significance and consciousness itself becomes en-
dowed with universal meaning. Artistic consciousness 
is a privileged access to the true nature of reality, ac-
cord ing to Kaufmann, which explains its pivotal role 
in his writings as a whole. Without access to the true 
nature of reality, i.e., without art and, we might add, 
philosophy or religion, life is reduced to purely indi-
vidual meaning, which for Kaufmann would be a life 
that is not fully human, one completely engulfed in the 
present moment and its immediate demands. For Kauf-
mann, a life reduced to the merely personal is not worth 
living, and its valuelessness is revealed with each of 
life's tragedies. 
More than half of Kaufmann 's published works re-
ma in untranslated. His Nachlass, housed at the Husserl 
Archives in Leuven, contains both published and un-
published material written for the most part in German 
longhand and shorthand (Gabelsberger stenography), 
as well as in English. It includes notes for the lectures 
Kaufmann delivered in Freiburg from 1926 to 1935, 
offprints of his many articles in German and English, 
originals of his Leipzig and Freiburg Habilitations-
schriften, his doctoral thesis, notes for lectures deliv-
ered at Northwestern University ( 1938-46) and at the 
University ofBuffalo (1946--54) during his refugee pe-
riod in the United States, and much ofhis philosophical 
correspondence. The current grouping of many of the 
documents on aesthetics in the Nachlass, incorporating 
material from very early and late periods, reflects Kauf-
mann 's plans for a wide-ranging book, to be entitled 
Phenomenology of Art, which was never completed.

KOREA 
The earliest acquaintance of Korean 
scholars with phenomenology dates back to the late 
1920s and early 1930s, when a handful of Koreans at-
tending what was then known as the Keijo Imperial 
University in Seoul took part in seminars on EDMUND 
HUSSERL, MAX SCHELER, and MARTJN IIEIDF.GGER. Perhaps 
it was indicati ve of the general trend of reception of 
philosophy from GERMANY at institutions in .JAPAN like 
this before World War II that the main interest had al-
ready shifted from the somewhat "dated" Husserlian 
philosophy to Heidegger's thought. Still retaining the 
labei of phenomenology, Heidegger introduced an en-
tirely new and, especially to the Orientals, surprisingly 
intuitive and appealing way oflooking at human being 
and the world. Some of the clearest documents from 
this period are an article on Heidegger 's notion of care, 
"Haideiga-ni okeru Sorge ni tsuite" ( 1932), and one on 
"Haideiga-ni okeru chihei-no monddi" ( 1935), which 
were published in the journal Ris o by CHONG HONG PARK. 
On the other hand, KI-RAK HA, who wrote "Haidege-e 
issese kongkansengkwa sikanseng muncey'' (On spa-
tiality and temporality in Heidegger, 1940), criticized 
Heidegger for orienting his analysis of DASEIN one-
sidely to the issue ofTIME, neglecting the other essential 
aspect ofhumankind's being, namely, SPACE. 
A serious and systematic study of phenomenology 
in Korea shows not only that it reflected the worldwide 
Husserl "renaissance," but that it was also sensitive to 
what occurred in the works of major followers, reform-
ers, and critics of Husserl developed after World War 
Il. Seoul National University quickly emerged as the 
Republic of Korea's central academic institution af-
ter 1945. Its Department of Philosophy was occupied 
by respectable senior faculty, one of whom, HYONG-
KON KOH, conducted seminars on Heidegger while the

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
aforementioned Park lectured on Kierkegaard, Niet-
zsche, and JASPERS. But phenomenology did not gain a 
firm foothold on Korean soi! for at least another decade. 
Moreover, the ravages of the Korean War ( 1950-53) 
had c1aimed heavy tolls on the human and physical re-
sources ofthis newly emerging nation, rendering it ali 
the more necessary to seek graduate education over-
seas. 
Thus, from the viewpoint of the history of the re-
ception of modern Western philosophy in Korea and 
of phenomenology in particular, there was a nearly 
absolute hiatus between what was taught in a severely 
regimented cultural environment before 1945 and what 
was tobe a new learning experience for a growing num-
ber ofphilosophy students after 1945. KANT and HEGEL, 
the epistemology ofneo-Kantianism as well as BRITISH 
EMPIRICISM, pragmatism, and a variety of other schools 
of thought continued, but phenomenology was reju-
venated by a new generation of scholars who studied 
in Europe. During 1959--{) 1, .JEON sooK HAHN studied 
in Heidelberg and brought more recent knowledge of 
Husserlian phenomenology back to Korea. KAH KYUNG 
CHO, who had previously studied in Heidelberg, vis-
ited the Husserl Archives in Koln in 1963 and main-
tained a close relationship to LUDWIG LANDGREBE. He 
was also the first returnee from Europe to teach pheno-
menology at Seoul National University. Though he 
lectured mostly on Heidegger and his Siljon Chelhak 
(Philosophy of existence, 1961, 1 Oth ed. 1993) treated 
Husserl only marginally, he began Husserl seminars in 
the early 1960s, using Die Krisis der europăischen Wis-
senschaften und die transzendentale Phănomenologie 
(1936) and Erlahrung und Urteil ( 1939), as well as 
Landgrebe's Husserl interpretations. 
While three younger colleagues- YER-SU KIM, IN-
SUK CHA, and HYONG-HIO KIM- may also be considered 
pioneers among Korean phenomenologists trained in 
post-war Europe, a steady stream of aspiring students 
went to Europe in the 1 970s and 1980s. Thus by 1994, 
no less than thirty-five Koreans returned home with 
Ph.D. degrees, mostly from German universities, after 
having written on phenomenology or in closely re-
lated areas. Especially in the early stages ofthe expan-
sion and reorganization of Korean universities, study 
abroad was a crucial career decision. But unlike young 
academics dispatched and supported by their home 
institutions, the "freelancing" students never had the 
guarantee of an appointment upon returning home, 
and this lack of coordination contributed to an over-
supply of "foreign" Ph.D's. in philosophy. There are 
dozens of well qualified, but unemployed philosophy 
degree holders, not a few of them having been trained 
in phenomenology. Some moved away from pheno-
menology or sought employment in entirely unrelated 
areas. Meanwhile, incentives were given to those in 
academic positions without the Ph.D. (the degree not 
having been previously mandatory) to obtain it. There 
were at least twenty-three phenomenology-related dis-
sertations accepted during this "grace period" at var-
ious Korean universities, raising the current total of 
phenomenology-related degree holders, both home ed-
ucated and foreign trained, to about sixty. 
Given so many specializing in phenomenology, it 
was inevitable that phenomenologists formed a perma-
nent section of the Korean Philosophical Association 
in 1976, and as the volume ofactivity increased further, 
the Korean Society for Phenomenology was officially 
born in 1978. lts presidents ha ve been MYONG-RO YOON, 
JEON SOOK HAIIN, IN-SUK CIIA, and YOUNG-HO LEE. The 
official outlet of the Society, fl.vunsang-hak Yim-gu 
(Research in Phenomenology), was not intended as a 
journal in the strict sense. It is a series ofvolumes pub-
lished at varying intervals from papers presented at the 
meetings of the society. Such meetings are held four 
to six times a year, totaling eighty-four by the end of 
1994. Volume titles indicate the common theme under 
which the papers are collected and are, in English trans-
lation, What is Phenomenology? (1983 ), Phenomen-
ology and Individual Sciences ( 1985), Development of" 
Phenomenological Issues ( 1984 ), Husserl and Modern 
Philosophy ( 1990), Phenomenology of" Lif"eworld and 
Hermeneutic.\· ( 1992), World, Man, and the Intentional-
ity of Consciousness (1992), and Phenomenology and 
Practica! Philosophy ( 1993 ). 
A significant am o unt ofpubl ication, however, stems 
from individual initiatives. According to a recent sur-
vey of Korean phenomenology by Jeon Sook Hahn 
there are 35 books, roughly 250 articles, and over 36 
major titles of translated books that have appeared, 
for the most part, during the past quarter of a century. 
These statistics do not include the some 60 disserta-
tions referred to above, parts of which ha ve been pub-
lished separately in shorter articles. In Die Heidegger-
Rezeption in Korea ( 1991 ), GWANG-IL sw lists 288 

KOREA 
Korean-language titles of books and articles on Hei-
degger alone. No doubt there are more lists of spe-
cialized titles, such as those on JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, but 
such titles can only be suggested here: YER-su KIM, Die 
bedeutungstheoretische Problematik in den Philoso-

One may wonder what the central contribution of 
Korean phenomenology thus far might be. More than 
any other thought significantly accepted, transmitted, 
and assimilated across national and cultural bound-
aries, phenomenology is conscious· ofthe problematics 
of how and why such knowledge of the "other" is 
possible. The factual encounter with and the possible 
assimilation of an "alien world" (Fremdwelt) as dif-
ferent from my own "familiar world" (Heimwelt) is 
predicated on the structure of the "horizon" and the 
phenomenological sense of the WORLD as the "total 
horizon" of human experience. The alien part of the 
world, however, is never so totally severed from mine 
or so abysmally strange as to defeat ali my efforts to 
understand it. According to Husserl, it is always by 
way ofprojecting and extrapolating from my own per-
spective that 1 can have access to an alien perspective 
and assimilate it.

Time and again, students from Asia traveling to Eu-
rope would ha veto face the curious question from their 
Western teachers and peers as to how they overcame the 
barriers of language and the entirely different cultural 
tradition. Without false modesty, Asian students nor-
mally responded by saying that they had "brought with 
them" the basic ability to understand the seemingly dif-
ferent West and only failed previously to explain what 
they have been doing ali along, which was to bring 
what they already knew about their own tradition to 
bear upon the new and unfamiliar one. 
If Korean scholars have truly understood some of 
the most basic problems of phenomenology "origi-
nally," it must be because they were able in princi-
ple to recognize them as their own problems. This 
could be made manifest in the way they "interpret" 
those problems "differently," and yet in a manner es-
sentially faithful to the phenomena. Until recently, this 
"affinity recognition" has been ignored in the interest 
ofintellectually more gratifying higher-level construc-
tions. But we have to descend into the lower layers 
of conscious life and explicate the structures and re-
lations between what is "founding" and what is "be-
ing founded." Moods or basic states of mind ( Grund-
stimmungen) such as anxiety, sorrow, shame, boredom, 
wonder, and doubt are always there in reallife regulat-
ing the lifestyles of Buddhism, Zen Buddhism, Con-
fucianism, and Taoism, and yet, seldom analyzed in 
their constituting function for the higher order of ideas 
and values. They must become topics of sharpened 
analysis. In this connection, NAM-IN LEE's recent work 
has disclosed, through a great feat of empathetic read-
ing, a congenial ground in Husserl 's theory of instincts 
that shows his phenomenology to be a "universal vol-
untarism." More intercultural phenomenology may be 
built on this basis. 
There ha ve also been attempts to apply the insights, 
methodological and otherwise, gained of phenomen-
ology to inherently Korean thought. In Yul-Gok-kwa 
Merleau-Ponty bikyo Yengoo (A comparative study of 
Yul-Gok and Merleau-Ponty, 1972), HYONG-HIO KIM has 
compared, for example, Yul-Gok, a noted Confucian 
scholar of 16th century Korea, with MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY. He also connects Husserl 's notion of LIFEWORLD 
to the way the concept of TRUTH is formed in tradi-
tional Korean thought. But similar short essays by Kim 
on ancient stories and myths can be regarded more as 

390 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
preliminary pointers than precedent-setting exemplars 
in intercultural phenomenology. His most recent work, 
Derrida-wa Nojang-uy Tokbup (Derrida and the art of 
reading Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, 1987), is a much 
more spirited attempt at an East-West synthesis that 
merits international critica] review. Another philoso-
pher, .IYONG-BOK RIE, was a participant in the Third 
Oriental Phenomenology Congress, sponsored by the 
World Institute for Advanced Phenomenological Re-
search and Learning ( 1992), and presented a paper en-
titled "Eine Hermeneutik des Symbols im Buch der 
Wandlungen." 
Most Korean phenomenologists, though trained in 
Europe and multilingual, adjust to the academic envi-
ronment at home soon after returning, and are obliged 
to publish for the most part in their native tongue. 
Exceptions are those with long-term or permanent 
overseas appointments, thus having much freer ac-
cess to conferences and publications in Westem lan-
guages. For example, a POLITIC AL SCIENTIST residing in 
the United States, IIWA YOL JUNG, has made himself 
known through erudite and elegant essays on pheno-
menological, existential, and hermeneutica! subjects. 
Perhaps his "Heidegger's Way with Sinitic Thinking" 
( 1987) should be mentioned as a typically intercultural 
and international contribution by an overseas Korean 
scholar. YINHUI PARK, though now returned to Korea 
permanently, was also a frequent participant in pheno-
menological conversations in the U"'ITED STATES during 
his decades-long teaching career in Boston. 
However, a more durable bond has been estab-
lished between the international community of phe-
nomenologists and Korean scholars through the activ-
ities of KAH KYUNG cHo. His "Gedanken abseits der 
dichotomischen Welterklarung" ( 1967) was the first 
attempt by an Asian to review critically Heidegger's 
relationship with Lao Tzu and his conversation with a 
Japanese visitor entitled "Aus einem Geschach von der 
Sprache." Cho's lecture, "Anschauung und Abstrak-
tion im Lichte der modernen Wissenschaftentheorie" 
( 1969) was also the first major phenomenological pre-
sentation by a Korean scholar at an international con-
ference. More recently, at the Xlllth Conference ofthe 
General Society of German Philosophy, Cho pointed 
out the significance of physis for Heidegger's thought 
of Being in a widely noted paper, "Die okologische 
Suggestibilitat der Spatphilosophie Heideggers" (Eco-
logica! suggestibility in Heidegger's !ater philosophy, 
1986). 
Landgrebe noted in his introduction to Cho 's Be-
wusstsein and Natursein ( 1987) that whereas most 
Japanese tried to appropriate Husserlian phenomen-
ology by setting it against the background of Zen Bud-
dhism, Cho made his knowledge ofTaoist philosophy 
relevant to interpreting phenomenology. Phenomen-
ology was seen as an extreme form ofthe modern "phi-
losophy of consciousness." Gratifying though the great 
degree of self-transparency was that consciousness 
has achieved from its subject-centered coNSTITUTIVE-
PHENOMENOLOGIC AL perspective, Husserl himself even-
tually had to face the consequences of having blurred 
the boundary of ordo essendi and ordo cognoscendi. 
His talk of the primacy of the lifewordly a priori, and 
a bodily a priori, ofthe "norm-giving" authority ofthe 
"factual"- as well as his admission ofthe unsurpass-
ability of "world logic" by ali real as well as possible 
logics-all this points to the limits ofthe philosophy of 
consciousness and suggests the need for a different kind 
of openness toward what !ies beyond consciousness. 
Heidegger's !ater philosophy may be construed as an 
attempt at opening such a consciousness-transcending 
vîsta in an approximation to Lao Tzu's posture of"let-
ting be." 
The future ofphenomenology in Korea depends on 
the possibility of creatively participating in ongoing 
international dialogues. Fresh cues coming from reve-
lations about Husserl 's universal voluntarism and mon-
adology suggest, if anything, that the opportunity rad-
ically to rethink the problem of intersubjective and so-
cial understanding beckons- a very real opportunity 
if multi cultural and ETHNIC diversity are to function in 
today's globallife with more than a semblance ofhar-
mony born offear. Lack ofvenues, especially for those 
who were trained early to express themselves also in 
English or German, but having no means to keep it up 
once they returned home, has been a sorely felt handi-
cap for Korean scholars. The recently inaugurated se-
ries of publication, Orbis Phănomeno/ogicus, holds 
out a promise of bridging such a gap. Volumes under 
preparation include Korean Contributions to Pheno-
menology.

ALEXANDRE KOYRE 
Koyre was bom in 
Odessa on August 29, 1892, and died in Paris on April 
28, 1964. He went to Paris in 1908, probably to study 
mathematics (and philosophy). During winter 1909-
1 O he moved to Gottingen, at that time the "Mecca of 
mathematics," where especially Ernst Zermelo ( 1871-
1953) was working on set-theoretic paraduxes such 
as Russell 's antinomy, and ADOLF REINACH, appointed 
Privatdozent only in 1909, was working on classical 
paradoxes in philosophy (the liar, Zeno's paradoxes). 
Already at the end of his first Gottingen semester, in 
February 191 O, Koyre was a leading figure in the circle 
of young students of phenomeno1ogy there. He man-
aged to procure for Reinach a set of the proofs of an 
article on the psychology of judgment that Karl Marbe 
(1869-1953) was about to publish; probab1y on this 
basis Reinach criticized Marbe's views in an article on 
negative judgment that appeared in 1911. 
In summer 191 O, Koyre attended not only the lec-
tures of David Hi1bert (1862-1943) on fundamental 
problems of mathematics, but also Reinach 's lecture 
course on Plato, in which the pre-Socratics ( especially 
Zen o, who is criticized along with Russell 's Principles 
of Mathematics of 1903 ), Socrates, and three early di-
alogues by Plato were treated. Although Koyre stated, 
in his own lntroduction a la !ee ture de Platon ( 1945), 
that he had "leamed to understand Plato only by ex-
plaining him," it is noteworthy that in the first part of 
this work he treats Meno, Protagoras, and Theaetetus, 
which are precise1y the dialogues Reinach had dea1t 
within1910. 
In winter 1910--11 Koyre turned to experimen-
tal psychology and entered a lasting friendship with 
David Katz (1884-1953), an assistant in psychology at 
Gottingen whose psycho1ogical work was influenced 
by Reinach. He a)so tumed to EDMUND HUSSERL. He 
attended Husserl's lectures on logic as theory of cogni-
tion, those ofReinach on KANT's critique ofreason, and 
the meetings of the Gottingen Philosophical Society, 
where ali the students of phenomenology participated. 
Together with Reinach, MAX SCHELER, and two other 
students, he even participated in an "inner circle" of 
this society where he presented his own ideas on math-
ematical and logica! paradoxes. He also discussed them 
with Hilbert's assistant Richard Courant ( 1888-1972), 
a cousin of EDITH STEIN. 
In 1911 Koyre lectured to the society on HENRI BERG-
soN. He must have leamed about Bergsonian thought 
in Paris. Husserl first heard of Bergson through this 
lecture. In the same year Koyre prepared three unpub-
lished manuscripts, "Insolubilia," "Die Antinomien 
der Mengenlehre," and "Paradoxa als Perpetuum mo-
bile." His very first publication, "Sur les nombres de 
M. Russell" in Revue de Metaphysique et Morale, 
carne from this fund of ideas. Russell 's definition of 
number in The Principles of Mathematics was said

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
a foundation for mathematics (Russell published a 
"Reponse a M. Koyre"). From the same source Koyre 
also derived "Bemerkungen zu den Zenonischen Para-
doxen," which was published in Husserl 's Jahrhuch 
fiir Philosophie und phănomenologische Forschung in 
1922. There he insists, against Reinach 's way of sol v-
ing Zeno's problem by means of an analysis ofthe con-
cept ofmotion, that the paradox in question is common 
to motion, infinity, and continuity and thus requires a 
broader framework for its solution. Notwithstanding 
this critica! approach, the article is dedicated "to the 
memory of AdolfReinach": Koyre's erstwhile teacher 
who had been killed in action in 1917. Finally, the 
two !ater articles, "The Liar" and "Manifold and Cate-
gory," published in Philosophy and Phenomenological 
Research after World War II, are ultimately drawn from 
the same fund of ideas. 
In March 1912, Koyre submitted his manuscripts 
to Husserl, who studied them carefully and in part 
annotated and took excerpts from them. Neverthe-
less, he considered them insufficient as a basis for 
Koyre's projected doctoral dissertation. Finding his 
way thus blocked, Koyre followed Reinach's advice 
and returned to France in late 1912 or early 1913. Like 
his lifelong friend and fellow Gottingen student HED-
WIG CONRAD-MARTIUS, he had meanwhile developed a 
strong interes! in religion. At the same time, Reinach 's 
vast erudition had aroused in him a strong interes! in 
the history of philosophy. Accordingly, he took the 
doctorat es lettres at the Sorbonne in June 1923 with 
two works, L 'idee de Dieu et les preuves de son exis-
tence chez Descartes ( 1922) and L 'idee de Dieu dans 
la philosophie de Saint Anselme ( 1923). In his orals he 
defended Scheler's phenomenology of religion against 
the scholar of German literature Henri Lichtenberger 
(1864-1941). 
After Reinach's death, Husserl became the lead-
ing figure of the phenomenological movement for 
Koyre too. He paid him extended visits, first in July 
1921 and again in September and October 1922. An-
other visit in October 1928 was meant to help pre-
pare Husserl 's Paris lectures, for which Husserl had 
been invited by Lichtenberger at Koyre's instigation. 
In these lectures, given in February 1929, Husserl re-
ferred publicly to "the fine and profound investigations 
of Messrs. Gilson and Koyre" that had made clear the 
presence of Scholastic thought in Descartes 's philoso-
phy. Husserl had worked out a summary ofthese lec-
tures for the French audience and the translation, while 
anonymous, is without doubt the work of Koyre. In 
Paris Husserl was also present at Koyre 's defense of 
his thesis, La philosophie de .Jacoh Boehme ( 1929). 
Part of it also appeared, in Conrad-Martius's trans-
lation, as "Die Gotteslehre Jakob Boehmes" in the 
Husserl Festschrift ( 1929). Koyre was a bie to travel 
to Freiburg for the presentation because of a grant 
from Husserl. A month !ater Husserl sent the expanded 
manuscript ofhis Paris lectures to Koyre, who revised 
the french translation of it by EMMANUEL LFVINAS and 
Gabrielle Pfeiffer and supervised the publication of 
Husserl 's las! book, Meditations Cartesiennes (1931 ); 
in fact, Husserl considered him as the "true translator" 
of this work. In July 1932, while Koyre was staying 
with Husserl for what was to be his last visit to Ger-
many, Husserl was elected a Corresponding Member 
of the French Academie des Sciences morales et poli-
tiques. Here again Koyre had played a decisive role 
by writing the four-page report to Leon Brunschvicg 
(1869-1944) on the basis ofwhich Husserl was elected. 
In Paris, Koyre co-founded the journal Recherches 
Philosophiques ( 193 I-36), which introduced pheno-
menology into FRANCE by publishing translations of 
work by, among others, Conrad-Martius, HELMUTII 
PLESSNER, OSKAR BECKER, MARTIN HEIDEGGER, and KARL 
LOWITH. The journal also published the first studies 
of JEAN WAHL, GABRIEL MARCEL, and JEAN-PAUL SARTRE. 
When an eventually short-lived scientific committee 
for the edition of Scheler's posthumous work (he had 
died in 1928) was formed in 1932, Koyre was called 
to serve on its board. He was also among the first 
members ofthe International Phenomenological Soci-
ety founded by MARVIN FARBER in 1940. Nevertheless, 
he told HERBERT SPIEGELBERG in 1956 that he did not 
know whether he was a phenomenologist or not. At the 
same time, however, he spoke ofHusserl 's influence on 
him as decisive. Actually, this statement results from 
a certain distortion of historical perspective, for the 
Platonic realism, historical approach, and high regard 
for medieval objectivism that Koyre on that occasion 
erroneously attributed to Husserl are ali hallmarks of 
Reinach 's approach. 
It was also in line with Reinach that at the 1932 
meeting of the Societe Thomiste in Juvisy on pheno-
menology Koyre declared himself in agreement with 

ALEXANDRE KOYRE 
393 
Edith Stein, who asserted: "Husserl never managed 
to convince any of his old students of the necessity 
to arrive at a transcendental idealism." Such expres-
sions werc more of general convictions inherited from 
Reinach, rather than thcmes Koyre would ha ve worked 
on, for his interest in the connection between the his-
tory of philosophy and that of RELIGION soon had also 
led him to the bistory of NATURAL SCILNCE. It is in these 
historical fields and above ali on their interconnection 
that his work had become concentrated and that he at-
tained prominence. During 1922--40 he taught mainly 
at the Ecole Pratique des Hautcs Etudes in Paris. In 
1941 he became Professor at the French Ecole Libre 
co-foundcd by him at the New School for Social Re-
search in New York. He returned to the Ecole Pratique 
in 1945 and continued teaching there, except for vis-
its to the UNITED STATES (Columbia University, Univer-
sity of Chicago, Johns Hopkins University, and above 
ali the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study), which 
continued until 1962. 
Koyn!'s work spans an amazing variety ofthemes. 
As regards the history of phi1osophy, he published, 
besides his aforementioned books on Plato, Anselm, 
and Descartes, annotated French translations of texts 
by Anselm, Fides quaerens intellectum (1927), and 
Spinoza, Trai te de la reforme de l'entendement ( 1936). 
In 1944 his Entretiens sur Descartes appeared. He 
had written La philosophie et le probleme national 
en Russie au debut du X!Xe siecle in 1929. A col-
lection of related articles appeared in 1950 under the 
tit le Etudes d 'histoire de la pensee philosophique en 
Russie. Another collection, Etudes d 'histoire de la 
pensee philosophique ( 1961 ), brings together articles 
on Condorcet, Hegel, Louis de Bonald, and Heidegger. 
As concerns the history of religious thought, in 
1955 Koyre published, in addition to his early book 
on Boehme, a collection of articles, Mystiques, spir-
ituels, alchimistes du XV!e siecle allemand dealing 
with Valentin Weigel, Caspar Schwenckfeld, Sebas-
tian Franck, and Paracelsus. But he is above ali the 
author of severa! major classics in history of sci-
ence, such as his Etudes galileennes (Galilean stud-
ies, 1940), on the laws of falling bodies and iner-
tia; From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe 
( 1957), which traces the history of cosmology from 
Nicholas of Cusa to Leibniz; and the more special-
ized work, La revolution astronomique, Copernic, Ke-
plet: Borelli ( 1961 ). In 1965, 1. B. Cohen published 
Koyre's Newtonian Studies on Newton's "Rules of 
Phi1osophizing," his optics, and the law of attrac-
tion posthumously. A year !ater Rene Taton collected 
most of Koyre 's articles on Leonardo da Vinei, Gio-
vanni Battista Benedetti, Galileo, Bonaventura Cav-
alieri, Pierre Gassendi, Nicolo Tartaglia, and Blaise 
Pascal under the title Etudes d 'histoire de la pensee 
scientifique. Already in 1934 Koyre had published an 
annotated French trans1ation ofBook I ofCopernicus's 
main work as N. Copernic, Des revolutions des orbes 
celestes. Togetherwith 1. B. Cohen he also prepared the 
two-volume critica] cdition of Newton's main work, 
Philosophiae natura lis principia mathematica ( 1972). 
Materials of a more biographical nature are contained 
in De la mystique a la science: Cours, conferences 
et documents 1922-1962, edited by Pietro Redondi in 
1986. 
Koyre's influence made itself fe1t above ali among 
historians of science in the United States, France, and 
Italy. More particularly, it should be mentioned that 
Thomas Kuhn developed his theory of paradigms out 
of Koyre's work, where the very expression "scien-
tific revolution" was coined. A two-volume Festschrift, 
Metanges Alexandre Koyre publies a l'occasion de son 
70e anniversaire ( 1964), testifies to his unique signif-
icance in this field. An issue of the Revue d 'Histoire 
des Sciences et leurs Applications ( 1965) is devoted 
to his memory; also worthy of mention is Gerard Jor-
land, La science dans la philosophie. Les recherches 
epistemologiques d 'Aiexandre Koyre (1981 ). Under 
the title Science: The Renaissance of a History, Pietro 
Redondi published the proceedings of a conference on 
Koyre's thought in an issue of History and Technol-
ogy. Koyre's Nachlass is kept at the Centre Alexandre 
Koyre, Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris.

LANGUAGE AFTER HUSSERL 
See ORDI-
The pheno-
meno]ogica] prob]em ofLANGUAGE IN HUSSERL has been 
transformed in major ways by MARTIN HEIDEGGER, MAU-
RICE MERLEAU-PONTY, EMMANUEL LEVINAS, HANS-GEORG 
GADAMER, and PAUL RICCEUR. To begin with, this prob-
]em never ceased to haunt Heidegger, even iffrom the 
outset, as with EDMUND HUSSERL before him, he only 
perceived it through the logic of signification. Heideg-
ger's meditation took severa! ways, passing from the 
logica! approach to an existential approach, the o ne and 
the other sustained by his ontologica! preoccupation, 
prior to culminating in a quasi-mystical vision. In the 
first step, the region of sense and signification is first 
and autonomous in relation to language. The second 
step corrects the apparent indifference with respect to 
speaking and the speaking subject, for it places the 
human, this "animal who has speech," in the center. 
Language is no longer described as a simple instru-
ment in the hands of a subject capable of handling it 
in its guise as a neutra] activity by which a thinking, 
sensing, and acting being expresses him- or herselfand 
communicates more or less well with others. Taking its 
origin in the being-in-the-world of DA SEIN, the existing 
human being, language in Sein und Zeit ( 1927) appears 
initially as an ensemble of signs of the same order as 
the equipment that we use and that forms our every-
day practica! environment. But it roots itself in a world 
from now on invested with a preliminary "structure 
of significance" in which the possibility of significa-
tions properly so called resides, which in turn found 
the "possibility of speech and language." 
At the foundation of speech is discourse, a fun-
damental mode of existing, original in the same way 
as Verstehen (understanding) and Befindlichkeit ( onto-
logica] disposition); in contrast with the metaphysical 
tradition, neither the understanding nor reason, much 
less sensibility or affectivity, has preeminence over 
language. If speaking appears tobe a way of express-
ing oneself, of saying how o ne comprehends the world, 
others, and oneself, ofreacting in the face ofthings and 
beings, then the world is always already pre-articulated 
and valorized in its significance before any interpreta-
tion and appropriation by speech, which is only its 
explicit enunciation. 
The distinction of the essential components of lan-
guage into sign, expression, and signification that 
Husserl sti li retained is based on the metaphysical top-
i ca (topics) ofthe sensible and the intelligible that Hei-
degger rejects: the essence oflanguage does not reside 
in the semiotic or semantic function any more than 
in the expressive function. Significations are neither 
copies nor images of things or of lived experiences, 
nor the products of acts of a sense-bestowing subject, 
and speech consists even less in placing a signification 
on a previously neutra! and significationless datum. 
Far from being a property inherent in the being or the 
work of a subject who carries it within, creating it by 
a sovereign act or drawing it from reality, MEANING 
arises from the appropriating explication of being-in-
the-world; it is expressly instituted by the discourse 
that actualizes it in an articulated ensemble of sig-
nifications. Signification maintains a certain primacy 
over the word: everything happens as if the significa-
tions, already there, sought to molt into words, as if 
-
virtually ready to be said -
they become words 
through a spontaneous mutation and not an arbitrary 
act of giving meaning. Discourse is no less Aussage 
and Mitteilung, enunciation and sharing with others, 
establishing a view ofthe world in common. In exercis-
ing its communicative function, speech does not really 
transmit messages, opinions, or sentiments to others; 
the exchange of words is nothing like an exchange of 
commodities. Moreover, instead of founding commu-
nication, speech presupposes that existence is already 
in an everyday common world that expressly realizes 
Miteinandersein, being-in-the-world-with-others. 
To speak is not simply to pronounce words, emit 
sounds, and give them meaning by an intellectual act. 
The order of priority is reversed. Speech is founded in 
discourse and discourse is not derived from linguistic 
expression, even though genuine speaking is based on 
the acts of hearing and understanding. This original

LANGUAGE AFTER HUSSERL 
395 
thesis confirms the ordinary experience of communi-
cation: to speak and hear are its essential moments 
and the mode par excellence of Mitsein. The speak-
ing of language is determined neither beginning from 
its transmissions nor beginning from its signification, 
any more than hearing consists in catching a voice and 
sounds affecting our hearing. Language never plays 
its ro le better than when it effaces itselfbefore what is 
said: 1 never comprehend better what is said to me by an 
other than when 1 am "ali ears" and when, so to speak, 
the sounds ofthe other's voice, including the words he 
or she pronounces, fade away. Thus as early as Sein 
und Zeit and confirmed ]ater, a veritable "reversal" of 
our experience oflanguage announces itself, which, in 
restoring ali authority to the saying itself, deprives the 
word of its privilege. This is why Heidegger, like a 
mystic of old, praises the virtues of silence as the foun-
dation of the authentic being able to speak. Far from 
being the manifestation of a deficiency or impotence of 
speaking, silence ends the ordinary chatter of everyday 
life that is a deficient mode of speaking. People often 
abandon themselves to a facile common talk that is 
satisfied with repeating the sayings of the anonymous 
"they." To speak is tobe listening to a discourse already 
uttered or engendered by this "colloquy" (Gesprach) 
that we are; it is to receive and respond to the always 
already spoken words in the language that we speak. 
How could people in their everyday speaking not be 
held in the grips of ordinary language and the "they 
say" of common sense that is a depository of ali that is 
said and can be said about the world? 
More vigorously than ever, the !ater Heidegger 
fights against the entire phonocentric and logical-
grammatical representation of language that has dom-
inated from antiquity up until Husserl in order to sum-
mon us to the place where language itself speaks and 
where humans learn with humility that they are not the 
masters of language, but that it is rather they who are 
under the command oflanguage. The thinker, who does 
not disdain being near poets nor the teachings of the 
language that they speak, invites us to go through the 
region in which the enigmatic relationships between 
words and things are clarified and where we learn that 
speaking is not just using words in a banal fashion to 
name things and beings; naming cannot be reduced to 
providing an already known object with a name, to af-
fecting things with a labei that fits them like a glove. It 
is time to renounce this "thingly" imagery that makes 
ofthe word itself a thing, without, for ali that, clarify-
ing the relation that coordinates one with the other, the 
word and the thing named. Naming is not the arbitrary 
act of denomination that some believe it to be. Con-
trary to a tenacious image inherited from metaphysics, 
words are not barrels and buckets from which we draw 
the content of a pregiven meaning. 
To speak is to receive into oneselfthe saying ofthe 
words of our language. To name is "to caii the thing 
to the word," to summon it in its very absence into 
our presence, to invite it to do something in a world of 
things with the result that in ali strictness, according 
to the poet Stefan George ( 1868-1933), whom Hei-
degger cites in Unterwegs zur Sprache (On the way 
to language, 1959), "there is no thing where the ap-
propriated word naming it is lacking," for "the being 
of every thing lives within the word." Words are like 
gestures that engender a world by making things come 
to the world and the world come to the things. This 
is the "poietic" power of speaking attested to by the 
poet, who, better than anyone, knows that we do not 
cease to speak afier our language, which always walks 
in front of us in each of our steps. Language is like the 
"house of being" that humankind inhabits, the unique 
dimension in which we can establish residence, and 
where the paths of thinking always already pre-traced 
in our bosom are discovered. Provided we listen to our 
language, we become aware that we are always already 
caught up in its saying (Sage), in the inextricable in-
terweavings of the relations that it spins and to which 
we belong due to our own speaking. 
With the omnipresence and omnipotence of lan-
guage that is expressed in the unusual tautological for-
mula "Die Sprache spricht" (language speaks), humans 
do not speak except by providing a reply to it and by 
entering into correspondence with its saying. lf speech 
relieves humans of ali initiative, what they say, each 
of their words, is carried by the speaking of their lan-
guage. Language is like the "Gelaut der Stille" (the 
sounding of stillness) that nevertheless does require 
the speaking ofmortals in order tobe understood, pro-
vided that they are disposed to the quiet hearing ofthis 
eloquent silence. In his will to penetrate the mystery 
oflanguage, Heidegger discovers another name that is 
more appropriate because it gathers together in a sin-
gle word logos and Being, the Saying and the Said, and 

396 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
that which induces us to speak. He calls it "die Sage" 
(Saying), from an ancient word that has the same origin 
as deixis, the source ofsigns that are not made from the 
gestures ofhumans, but rather from the "gesture ofthe 
world." This is a remarkable hypostasis of language 
that seems to take away every power of the speaking 
subject in order to give this power to the Saying and the 
Said oflanguage. For the thinker, ali originallanguage 
is "the coming of Being into the Said" that it assumes 
as its destiny, and it is foundational for the history of 
the community ofhumans. 
At this point we are far from the initial phenomen-
ological approach to language, carried away into the 
mysterious land in which !ies the being of language as 
Sage (legend) and out ofwhich ali that "there is" in the 
world originates. 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY addresses the probJem of 
language by beginning from a criticism of Husserl's 
account and by taking a path opposite to what the latter 
had privileged. Centering his reflection on speech, he 
placed the accent on the act of expressing, which does 
not presuppose the anteriority of any language; thus 
speaking appears from the outset as rooted in corpore-
ity. It is one's own BODY that is the primordial signifier 
and ali meaning proceeds from it. Speaking itself as 
expression is a bodily gesture and even one ofthe fun-
damental functions of the body. It is the voice that 
incarnates meaning while externalizing it for others 
in the sign. There is something of a hodily language 
(langage corporel) and the bodily subject then liter-
ally defines itself by its "indefinite power to signify," 
to grasp and communicate a meaning. The "pheno-
menology of language" presents itself first of ali as a 
"phenomenology of speech." 
Language for Merleau-Ponty is never the simple 
clothing of a thought that possesses itself in fu li clar-
ity. He so objects to such an extent to the "phantom 
of a pure language" -
the idea of a language made 
up of entirely transparent signs designating the mat-
ters themselves, or already established pure signifi-
cations without remainder or equivocation- that he 
refuses the myth of a universal univocallanguage that 
presupposes the precise, arbitrary, and magica! corre-
spondence between language and what it signifies, as 
if signs could correspond adequately to significations, 
words to things. This model of a language that in its 
purity guarantees the coincidence between thought and 
reality is actually born from language spoken (langage 
parte), from language after the fact, which disappears 
before the meaning ofwhich it is the carrier. Once the 
word is spoken, the thickness of the words, their au-
tonomy, dissolves and they appear like neutra! tools in 
the service of significations. 
Instead of indicating it, the signifier rathcr harbors 
the meaning that, like that of gestures, is not in the 
elements of which it is made; rather, it is their com-
mon intention. The meaning is readable precisely as the 
linguistic gesture that is the incarnation of it. Merleau-
Ponty thus detaches himself from the early Husserl 
in order to converge with the !ater Husserl through 
the image of language as "Verleiblichung" ( embodi-
ment). The difference between speaking speech and 
spoken speech (parole par/an te and parole par/ee) is 
already accentuated in the Phenomenologie de la per-
ception ( 1945). Language appears there as operating 
and as enactment ofmeaning. The rooting ofthe ideal-
ity ofmeaning in the perceived is revealed at the same 
time. One can grasp it only in its place of cmergence 
in speech that is the dimension of embodiment where 
signification shows through. Yet expression overlooks 
itself as expressive operation in order to appear to itself 
as the translation of an ideal text. The task that imposes 
itselfin this is thus to reveal the speaking speech under 
the speech spoken. 
As the signifying power of the body, language at-
tests that linguistic signification prolongs and accom-
plishes the gestural signification that is deployed in 
bodily forms of behavior. Only if the verbal sign is 
arbitrary and non-natural is it impossible to derive the 
linguistic signification from a signification immanent 
in the bodily and phonetic gesture. And yet signifi-
cations do not precede signs, but arise in contact with 
them. Conform ing to the lessons in linguistics ofFerdi-
nand de Saussure (1875-1913), Merleau-Ponty holds 
that speech does not produce meaning independent of 
language. There is a primordial stratum in language, 
and meaning does not proceed from the representation 
ofthe thing in the word, but rises up in the very texture 
ofspeech. 
The idea of a perfect expression, through and 
through transparent, is nonsense, ali language is in-
direct, and meaning always comes to us circuitously, 
obliquely, incomplete. Speech is beyond the possibil-
ities inscribed in the language, while the language 

LANGUAGE AFTER HUSSERL 
397 
presents itself to the subject as a system of dispari-
ties between signs and significations. An irreducible 
precariousness strikes the language that, at the same 
time, says more than the words taken separately say. 
This is why to grasp speech in the nascent state is to 
catch it against the background ofsilence that precedes 
it. Meaning then appears at once as transcendent ofand 
immanent in the signs. It does not preexist the signs, 
it conquers itself in their active deployment without 
their ever losing their opacity to the benefit of a pure 
thought. This is an experience that confirms the Saus-
surian discovery that signs are only signifiers beginning 
from their differences, that meaning is not reducible to 
a positive entity, but is situated between signs. Sign 
and signified do not preexist the act of expression, and 
in no case are there pure signs and pure significations. 
Instead of clothing and conveying preestablished sig-
nifications, words are animated with an autonomous 
vitality. There is neither a one-to-one correspondence 
of signs with significations or with things, nor a to-
tal sayability of the real. In a language, there are only 
under-standings; the idea of total communication is ab-
surd. A thing is never entirely said or thought, for there 
always subsists something unwritten and unthought 
about it. 
The essential silence that underlies speech is not 
an obstacle to but a condition for signification. Much 
more than a meaning, language is something like a be-
ing. The expression is not on the level of material signs, 
which by themselves are insignificant, nor on the level 
of subjectivity, nor that of the object. This explains 
the unusual affirmation: "It is not we who speak, it is 
truth that speaks itself on the basis of speech." Rather 
than being a negation of language, the silence of the 
perceived world is primordial speech, the mute logos, 
and expression is only the infinite conversion of silence 
into speech and speech into silence. Coming closer to 
Heidegger than to Husserl, Merleau-Ponty ascends to-
ward an ontology of language, toward the enigmatic 
image of the language of Being that makes us under-
stand the "very voice ofthe things." This also confirms 
his formula according to which "it is being that speaks 
in us, and not we who speak ofbeing." 
The cthical requirement that guides EMMANUEL LEV-
INAS ca11s for a reinterpretation of the essence of lan-
guage, which he accomplishes through an explication 
using Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty. He ini-
tia11y inscribes the problem into the immediate relation 
with the Other, for to comprehend the Other is always 
at the same time to ca11 the Other, to address oneself 
to him or to her, to 5peak with the Other. This is the 
language that he ca11s ethics because, differing from 
the objectivating language of things and the world, it 
opens the eminent access to the Other. Speaking is an 
ethical event prior to being a logica) event. Ca11 to and 
vindication ofthe Other, language puts in question the 
EGO and the egocentric orientation of its life that liber-
ales it. It is only in responding to the Other, in sharing 
the world with the Other, that language is born as an in-
tersubjective system of objective determinations. Due 
to speech, the world becomes the common world, the 
world shared and the object of communication with 
others. Objectivating language is posterior and sub-
ordinate to the ethical language that is primordia11y 
encounter with the Other and the foundation ofthe ob-
jective system for the designation of things. Thus the 
essence of language according to Levi nas resides nei-
ther in signs nor in significations, but in the "originary 
coming ofthe face-to-face with others." 
The Other who origina11y is signifying alone is the 
source ofa11 signification and the condition ofthe pos-
sibility ofthe very function ofthe sign. But the signifi-
cation that emanates thereby bas nothing abstract about 
it; it is the indication of his or her own indigence, of 
his or her distress, and hence of my responsibility for 
the Other. Two types oflanguage fo11ow from this, that 
which is reference to things and that which is rela-
tionship to the Other, but speaking about things sti11 
always assumes speaking with others: "In designating 
a thing," Levinas notes, "I designate it to an Other." 
Nevertheless, there is a "language before language," a 
"speech before speech," that reveals itself in the face 
ofthe Other and that is the ca11 ofthe Other and salute 
to the one addressed. 
In Autrement qu 'etre (Otherwise than being, 1974), 
Levi nas further deepens his meditation by showing that 
language cannot be reduced to its function of denom-
ination. Rather, it surges through the Saying and the 
Said. Instead of being simply sign or expression of a 
meaning, it designates and consecrates "this here as 
that there" and by this means it enters into the order of 
"hearsay," of an already said. Language is this Saying 
that ali together carries, is absorbed by, and inscribes 
itself into the Said. Contrary to Husserl, Levi nas does 

398 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
not think that the word is a simple intention, nor even 
the expression of a meaning; it is literally JACQUES DER-
RIDA's "will to speak" (vouloir dire) par excellence, 
which at once proclaims and consecrates what it iden-
tifies in the already said. It is in the already said that 
words exercise their function of sign while the signifi-
cation ofthe Saying goes beyond the Said, beyond the 
essence assembled in the Said. Duplicating the Being 
that it designates and names, language is not indifferent 
to this Being; it does not just Jet it be seen. Tobe sure, 
the Said appears anterior to the communication and to 
the representation of Being, as if, prior to the language 
of humans, there was a language of Being that makes 
itself heard by the voice of silence that poetry puts 
into human words. But Levinas rejects the mysticism 
of language, somewhat similar to his view, that Hei-
degger propagates, and pleads instead for a language 
in which Saying is first and foremost testimony to and 
responsibility for the Other. 
HANS-GEORG GADAMER thematizes the prob]em of 
language beginning from the double rootedness of his 
thinking in Husserl 's phenomenology and Heidegger's 
ontology and in the double tradition to which he at-
taches himself: philological and philosophical issues 
from Plato and Aristotle to Hegel, Husserl, and Heideg-
ger. Concerned about hermeneutica! theory, method, 
and practice, his reflections bear upon every sector of 
cu! ture, from art to literature and philosophy, in which 
comprehension and interpretation of a MEANING that is 
only given through and within the play of dialogue are 
involved. Far from being reduced to the pure grasp of a 
neutra! signification subsisting, so to speak, "in itself," 
as the translation of meaning from one language to 
another could suggest, the act of comprehension is lit-
erally the "coming ofmeaning to language." Instead of 
hiding within the pure interiority of a thinking subject 
who uses language as a means of expression, meaning 
inhabits the language that harbors it. The celebrated 
Gadamerian formula according to which nothing can 
be understood and interpreted outside the element of 
language comes from this. 
True to the principle ofHERMENFUTICS, Gadamer be-
gins from a critique of the concept of language as de-
veloped in a long tradition in the Occident through two 
opposed approaches, the one privileging the thesis of 
the unity between language and thought and the other 
opposing them in a radical heterogeneity. Modern sci-
ence and philosophy ended by reducing language to a 
pure symbolic form (ERNST CASSIRER) and to only see-
ing in it one mode ofrepresentation among others ora 
simple means of expression, a pure instrument in the 
service of a sovereign thought. Instead of considering 
language as "language ofman" but following Wilhelm 
von Humboldt ( 1767-1835), Gadamer judges that ev-
ery act of speaking is anchored in a language that, 
rather than being an objective and indifferent system 
of signs, is an "image of the world" ( Weltbild): trac-
ing the contours and the articulation of a world that 
humans inhabit, language determines ali of their re-
lations to the world and of the things of the world. 
Consequently, if humankind is 1anguage, language is 
definitively the "1anguage of things" and the truth of 
our world. Under Heidegger's influence, Gadamer thus 
admits that Being is language and humans are held in 
its play. It is through it and in it that reality is manifest, 
it is in the dialogue that the thing changes into a spoken 
thing and offers itselfto thinking. 
An inextricable relation sea1s humans and language, 
language and world: there is only a world for us to the 
degree that it addresses itself to us and is expressed in 
language. The world is not prior to its structuration in 
the uni verse of meaning and language even though it 
is "in enunciation that it comes to language" and be-
comes manifest for us and that it is in dialogue that 
ali language has its effective reality, that the "putting 
to work of the understanding" between humans is in-
stituted. If the world "in itselr' is the ground and the 
te/os of our discourse, it is built up in the "commu-
nity of life" that is always already a "community of 
language," both of them engendered in one and the 
same historica1 genesis. Each of the languages traces 
its perspectives and the "profiles" of a unique and com-
mon world; each grasps, beginning from its view ofthe 
world pre-articulated in its language, the view of the 
world constituted in any language other than its own. 
Being at once a 1imit and an obstacle to the experi-
ence ofthe world and its support that cannot be gotten 
around, language is properly the "mark of finitude," 
which reflects itself ali together in the dependence of 
our speech in regard to a language, in our belonging 
to a historical "community of language" and its tradi-
tions, in the belonging of ali meaning to the dimension 
of language. 
For PAUL RICCEUR, just as for Merleau-Ponty, lan-

LANGUAGE AFTER HUSSERL 
399 
guage is an essentially philosophical stake that he ap-
proaches through the double chal/enge that opposes to 
the phenomenoJogist ORDINAR V LANGUAGE ANALYSIS, on 
the one hand, and ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHYand pragmatism 
on the other. The detour through the science of lan-
guage is an essential move for phenomenology today 
because structural linguistics has the merit of having 
posited language as a system of signs defined solely by 
their differences, and as an autonomous system whose 
closure it postulates. This is the major challenge that 
terminates the primacy and autonomy of the speaking 
subject in the operation of conferring meaning. Since 
the sign is no Jonger defined substantially, but in terms 
of relations to other signs at the hcart of the system, 
language appears as a selF5u{ficient and closed system. 
Ricceur does not accept ali the presuppositions of lin-
guistic STRUCTURALISM, criticizing its misappreciating 
ofthe primary intention oflanguage that intends to say 
something about something. With Husserl he admits 
that languagc at once expresses an ideal meaning and 
a reference to the real. But it crosses two thresholds in 
o ne and the same movement of transcendence: that of 
the ideality of meaning and also that of reference, for 
it has a grasp on reality and expresses at the same time 
the hold of reality over thinking. To recognize the lim-
its of structural analysis incites the phenomenologist 
to return both to the foundations of language, in order 
to rethink its unitary nature, and to consider the theory 
of signification afresh once more in order to put it to 
the test of semiology. 
Now according to Ricceur, language is based on the 
fundamental distinction between system and discourse 
and on the idea that language is a totality articulable in 
a series of levels, each one of which is characterized 
by a certain type of unity: phonemes, semantemes, 
morphemes, and then utterances or sentences. While 
admitting, with Husserl, the privilege ofthe signifying 
function of language, Ricceur insists upon the com-
plexity of tensions through which it is exercised in 
the word, the phrase, discourse, and finally the text. 
Every word indicates, identifies an object, and exer-
cises an ostensive function, but a sign only becomes a 
word in the position of a potential utterance, when o ne 
speaks in an instance of discourse. And at the same 
time the word is more than the utterance, since it sur-
vives the ephemeral moment of spcaking and returns 
to the system of language at the heart of which it has 
a use-value accumulated in the course of history. The 
word is more and less than the phrase; it is like an "ex-
changer" between the system of language and the act 
of speaking. In the successive occurrences- the ex-
pressions spoken on this or that occasion- a sentence 
has a content of meaning that transcends the act of 
enunciation in such a way that every discourse is both 
realized as an event and comprehended as an identica! 
signification. The latter has an objective side that is 
what the utterance signifies and a subjective side that 
is what the speaker means in a given situation. This 
ali refers, on the one hand, to Husserl's significational 
intention that constitutes language and whose decisive 
moment is the ideality of meaning and its reference to 
the reality of things and, on the other hand, to acts of 
discourse of a speaker engaged in a relation of inter-
action. Beyond this, as we have learned from GOTTLOB 
FREGE and Husserl, the objective dimension of signifi-
cation includes at once a sense and a reference, the first 
immanent in language and the second belonging to the 
order ofthe relations between language and world. 
Not only does every expression imply a common 
world without which no common language would be 
possible, but the institution of this world is from the 
outset inscribed in the intentiona! essence of language 
with respect to which it always intends in the sig-
nification something other than itself. To reduce the 
signification to the use of a word, as would LUDWIG 
WITTGENSTEIN, would abolish the signifying intention. 
If structural semiotics leads to renouncing the primacy 
of the speaking subject and to reconquering semantic 
unity for the sake of the primacy of structure over the 
process of significance- without, for ali that, juxta-
posing the openness oflanguage to the lived world and 
the closedness ofthe uni verse of signs- then the con-
frontation with linguistic analysis and its difficulties 
in explicating the discourse of action leads Ricceur to 
caii attention yet again to the intentionallived experi-
ence and to the genesis ofmeaning. The two steps, the 
semantics and the pragmatics, of action are called to 
join themselves in what engages the whole of analytic 
and descriptive discourse bearing upon the necessary 
elements ofthe language phenomenon. 
Ifthe theory ofsignification retains, for Ricceur, the 
value of a decisive contribution to the philosophy of 
language, he does not disdain the contributions that 
he finds as much in Heidegger's ontology and in the 

400 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
hermeneutics ofGadamer as in linguistic analysis. The 
model oflanguage urged by Saussure, who emphasizes 
the opposition of"langue" and "parole," reduces ali the 
substantial aspects of language to differences and di-
acritical values in order to Iead to a system of signs 
closed upon itself. Through this, the center of the gen-
esis of meaning is displaced from a "phenomenology 
of speech" centered on the speaking subject toward a 
theory that makes a detour through the synthesis ofthe 
act of speaking with the structure of language. As the 
place where this synthesis occurs, discourse not only 
makes reference to the world through its utterances in 
a self-referential representation, but also reestablishes 
the speaker and the interlocutor in their respective ro les 
and language itself in the ro le of universal "medium" 
in and through which the subject asserts itself and a 
world appears. 
Ricceur gradually deepens his reflection on the en-
Iivening power at work in the very heart of ordinary 
language. He illustrates it through the semantics ofthe 
metaphoric utterance, which, under the influence of an 
actual context, reveals a new signification. Even though 
it can be incorporated into the lexicon ofthe language, 
the metaphor does not ha ve an existence at first except 
as a deviation. As a dead metaphor, it enriches the pol-
ysemy of the current means of expression and it only 
lives on in its utilization and semantic impertinence. 
From the metaphor as poetic word one passcs on to 
ever more vast textual unities in a metaphoric discourse 
that has a double reference, literal at first and then 
metaphoric, that attests to the vitality of a language. 
Converging with Heidegger, Ricceur asserts that the 
philosophy of language is philosophy itself inasmuch 
as it thinks the rclationship of being and being-said. 
Elevated to a manifestation of Being, language conse-
crates the "simultaneous birth ofthe being-said ofthe 
world" and the "speaking being" ofhumankind; by the 
"closure oflanguage" it institutes itselfin a closed uni-
verse of meaning at the same time that it itself posits 
its own opening to Being. 
Another major transition leads Ricceur from the 
phenomenology of language to the hermeneutics of 
the text. If it is true from the linguistic point of view 
that the text is no less problematic than the discourse 
beginning from which he defines it, this does not hap-
pen without difficulty. Writing and reading a text is 
not a particular case of oral dialogue. Rather, the text 
is posited and conceived as an original possibility of 
discourse, the meaning of which no longer resides in 
the lived experience of the saying, but in the said; 
separate from the intention ofthe author, it takes onan 
autonomous life, finding itselffreed from ostensive ref-
erences to the dialogi cal situation and moving through 
this as a power free to refer to a new world, to unnoticed 
aspects of our being-in-the-world. Since the text is no 
Ion ger addressed to a determinate interlocutor but to an 
anonymous public, what it loses in situational efficacy 
it gains by multiplying and diversifying the referential 
possibilities. This is the triple autonomy that the text 
enjoys: with regard to the author, with regard to its ini-
tial aim, and with regard to the world and the context 
in which it was conceived. 
Yet Ricceur sti li refuses the "ideology ofthe absolute 
text" that not only suspends the relatio.1 to the world but 
Iiterally abolishes it and distances itself from the event 
ofthe interpretation of it. No longer seeing the hidden 
intentions of the author, but rather the deployment of 
the world that adumbrates itself in the very structure 
of the text, interpretation thus acquires an objectivity 
that is usually denied. Rather than a "work on the text," 
interpretation is, according to Ricceur, "the act of the 
text itself." If READING is in a sense the appropriation 
of the text, it engagcs in a disappropriation of the 
self of the reader- albeit without the listening to the 
text having to change into an unreserved obedience-
on the condition that it agrees to play the dialectica! 
game ofbelonging and distantiation that hermeneutics 
teaches. 
The confrontation with analytic philosophy, which 
has its center of gravity in the sphere oflanguage usage, 
quite naturally imposes itself on a theory of discourse 
that itself takes its point of departure from the utter-
ance. Careful to establish fruitful exchanges between 
the phenomenological approach and pragmatic and an-
alytic philosophy, Ricceur in turn enters into the privi-
leged field of exploration that is the theory of ACT ION, 
which must investigate the manncr in which acting 
is "said" and is described by revealing the aspects that 
permit treating it on the "model ofthe text." For what is 
accomplished by action is detached from the immediate 
situation of enacting in the same way as what is said is 
detached from the dialogical situation. The encounter 
between two concurrent approaches -
one of which 
insists on the meaning of lived experiences and their 

LANGUAGE IN HUSSERL 
401 
"sayability," while the other puts the stress on propo-
sitional utterances and already given expressions -
is, Ricceur is convinced, profitable to both, which can 
mutually correct and enrich themselves thereafter. The 
phenomenology oflanguage has thus progressively led 
Ricceur to a hermeneutics of symbols understood as 
signs in a double sense, then to a hermeneutics of 
the text, and finally yields a hermeneutics of action. 
Ricceur thus unceasingly moves through this vast field 
of investigation on the horizon of which stands the 
"great philosophy of language" that our epoch needs 
-
and that it attempts to actualize, with whatever de-
gree of success, along li nes that sometimes converge 
and sometimes diverge.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
bring about by reinterpreting his basic theses. Initially 
Husserl treated the problem of language as a logician 
more than as a philosopher. With John Stuart Miii and 
GOTTLOB FREGE he recognized the need for a reflection 
on language prior to one on thought. In order not to 
be a private phenomenon without objective validity, 
thought needs to be uttered, and in order to be utter-
able and communicable, it must color itself somehow 
in the fonn of an expression. AII thought worthy ofthe 
name is given in and through language. Acts of pure 
thinking are never experienced, only acts ofuttering. 
Phenomenology forbids recourse to linguistic, his-
torical, psychological, or any other objective theory 
and requires describing ~ without presupposition or 
prejudice ~ how we live language in speaking and 
hearing others speak naively and spontaneously. lnas-
much as speaking is to express oneself about some-
thing, eventually addressing oneself to somebody, 
Husserl 's reftections in the Logische Untersuchungen 
( 1900-190 1 ), especially the First and Fourth Investiga-
tions, pursue a Bedeutungslehre, a theory of expression 
and signification. By means of a series of reductions 
and progressive differentiations, he elucidates these 
two terms that, as a rule, apply only to the linguistic 
sphere and broadens them to cover ali acts of con-
sciousness ofthe sort he calls signifying or intentiona! 
acts. He starts with a double reduction: since expres-
sion always supposes an intention of signifying that 
"animates" the sensuous phenomenon with which it is 
mysteriously united and to which it gives life, there is a 
reduction ofthe sensuous aspect, on the one hand, and, 
on the other hand, there is a provisional suspension of 
the communicative function of language. 
Every verbal expression belongs to the category of 
sign, and language is defined by its semiotic function, 
the power of humans to create and institute signs, to 
comprehend and interpret them. There are two types of 
signs: those that are called indications, which provoke 
gestures, attitudes, practica! behaviors, reactions, etc., 
and those called expressions, which call for the pro-
duction of other signs, awaken thoughts, images, sen-
timents, etc. The indication is not "in itself' a sign; it 
does not express anything because it does not transmit 
anything that corresponds to an intention. The expres-
sion, however, is always a significant sign and the signi-
fication ofthe expression is always what a discourse or 
somebody means. lndications do not express anything 
~ 
or at least they do not as such perform the function 
of signification, which happens in the act of speaking. 
Contrary to MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, Husserl does not 
think that speaking is a sort of gesture or that the verbal 
expression is a sort ofindication, even ifthe expression 
indirectly indicate.1· the speaker's lived experience and 
a content of signification. 
Every sign is a sign of something, it is defined by its 
referential function; as an artificial and arbitrary sign, 
the word and what it signifies are interrelated within 
the same unity o/intentiona! consciousness, which re-
sults from an empirica! and contingent association. But 
the sign truly fulfills its function as sign only when it 
effaces itself, so to speak, before that which it signifies 
so well that, paradoxically, the indispensable physical 
face of the sign does not comprise its essence. Taken 
in themselves, signs ~ 
the printed word or the sound 
heard ~ are simply perceived objects, shapes traced 
on paper or sounds vaguely heard. As soon as the per-
ceived sign takes on its function as significant sign, 
however, our intention goes through it to bear exclu-
sively upon the object intended to in the act bestowing 
the signification. With an "unreadable" or difficult-to-
decipher handwriting, when 1 begin to comprehend, 1 
no longer see the black marks traced on the paper, or 
even the letters; through them 1 intend what they sig-
nify. The sign never plays its role better than when it 
ceases to be a pure sign in order to refer beyond it-
self to a sense, an object, a state of affairs. Likewise, 
the corporeal expressions that externalize sensations, 
sentiments, and emotions (a face that is called "expres-
sive") are not expressions in the strict sense ofthe term 
because they lack the intent to signify; they signify 
something only on the condition that one interpret~ 
them and to the extent that a specific act imposes a 
signification upon them. This is why mimicry, plays 
ofphysiognomy, and gestures, which are not animated 
by an emphatic intent to signify, are excluded from 
language. 
That every speech is, either actually or potentially, a 
speech addressed to others, that every locution is inter-
locution and elocution, does not imply that words that 
accompany gestures and even are phonetic gestures 
behave like simple gestures. Speaking and hearing are 
correlative and communication is an eminent function 
of human language. In order for an other to compre-
hend it, speech needs the mediation ofthe physical face 

LANGUAGE IN HUSSERL 
403 
of Janguage: when I hear the other, I only perceive the 
sounds that he or she emits directly, the objective cor-
poreal aspect of speech, while the subjective aspect, the 
intentiona) acts by which the speaker gives meaning to 
the signs that he or she produces, are not present, just 
as mine are not for the other. This is the irreducible 
limit of otherness. 
Yet when I grasp the other's expression as speech 
addressed to me, 1 must perceive the o ne who speaks as 
a person who does not emit incomprehensible sounds 
or cries, but speaks to me and intends to communi-
cate a message to me, and in return, must treat me as 
a person with whom he or she is able to enter into 
interpersonal relations. According to Merleau-Ponty, 
relations of reciproci~v are thus established in which 
the one who speaks and the one who hears join to-
gether in sharing the meaning of speech exchanged to 
such an extent that one cannot say whether it belongs 
to the one who speaks or to the one who Iistens. 
Nevertheless, the suspension ofthe communicative 
dimension is justified by the fact that the word ceases 
to be a word, the expression of a signification, at the 
very moment when interest is directed at the sensuous 
aspect, at the purely phonic or acoustic phenomenon. 
To pay too much attention to accent, to intonation, to 
the rhetorical elements of speech, is tantamount to tak-
ing the risk that the MEANING that it conveys will escape 
me or will be hidden under pragmatic, illocutionary, or 
gestural elements. Monologue shows that to communi-
cate with others is not the sole function oflanguage, for 
in thinking, which is a way of speaking to oneself, I do 
not communicate anything to myself and 1 do not need 
to have recourse to signs even though it can happen, 
in a pathological state ofauditory-verbal hallucination, 
that l speak to myself as an other. 
The word that one recognizes as such, the same 
word that is not confounded with the multiplicity of 
sensuous occurrences, is thus not reducible to the pure 
physical phenomenon. lf a linguistic sign is not identi-
fiable and recognizable in its form despite and through 
the diversity of elements of it that can vary, it can-
not fulfill its function. To do so, it must remain the 
same and be repeatable as such, despite its deforma-
tions by various speakers. The identity ofthe sign and 
the word is something ideal and owes nothing to their 
empirica) and real existence. Nevertheless, the ideal 
identity holds above ali for the signification that sub-
sists through and despite the diversity of the real acts 
conferring signification. This is not in contradiction 
with the jluctuation in the meaning of words, since if 
the signifying acts can vary, the ideal unities of sig-
nification in between which the acts oscillate remain 
invariant and identica) to themselves. On this condition 
the interlocutor comprehends a speech in the same way 
as the locutor. 
The unity and identity of the signification is con-
firmed even in the case of expressions whose significa-
tions change according to the context ofthe utterance, 
not in a fortuitous but in an essential way, as happens 
in expressions called subjective and essentially occa-
sional, such as expressions whose signification varies 
according to the person to whom o ne addresses oneself 
or according to the situation and interlocutive context: 
personal pronouns, demonstratives, adjectives, and ad-
verbs of place and time, ali of which imply a deictic 
function. They ha ve nothing Jess than an identica) core 
of meaning that is a general referential function con-
sisting in naming the immediate context of discourse. 
This category of expressions raises a crucial problem 
for the theory of Janguage because there are many of 
them in ordinary Ianguage. They do not depend solely 
on the interlocutive context; even the signification of 
objective expressions can vary as a function of circum-
stances, as is shown by impersonal utterances such as 
"it is raining," "it is cold," to which the qualification 
"today" or "here and now" is added tacitly. What varies 
and changes in function ofthe situation is not the sig-
nification, which remains identica) in its generality; 
rather, it is the signifying intention. The signification 
of most ordinary words is determined by context and 
appears to fluctuate according to circumstances, but 
the fluctuation is ascribable to the subjective acts of 
signifying, not to the signification in itself. Without 
the ideal identity of significations, ordinary Janguage 
itself could not function, nor could any communication 
between humans through Janguage take place without 
naive confidence in the univocity ofthe words founded 
uponit. 
The ideality and objectivity of the signification is 
such that Husserl even speaks of "significations in 
themselves," as Bernard Bolzano (1781-1848) had 
spoken of "truths in themselves," the difference being 
that ideality for Husserl has neither a normative sense 
nor the sense of an ideal Janguage a la Leibniz, i.e., a 

404 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
language with significations that are perfectly univo-
cal and determinate once and for ali. For Husserl this is 
an absurd hypothesis, for the ideality oflanguage only 
permits comprehending how, despite the fluctuation 
of signifying acts, significations remain communica-
ble and objective and not purely subjective and subject 
to the circumstantial hazards of the speech act. The 
ideality ofthe signification is no more in contradiction 
with the contingency of the subjective act of speaking 
than with the change in the meaning of words during 
the course of the history of a language. The significa-
tion of the words of a language does not exhaustively 
reduce to the psychological, sociologica!, historical, 
or pragmatic circumstances oftheir use. When one in-
quires into the meaning of a word, what o ne most often 
has in view is not the word pronounced hic et nunc, 
nor is it the fortuitous act of signifying. One intends 
the signification ofthe word as such. 
Ideal objectivity is not the privilege of the signi-
fications of scientific utterances. It is essential to ali 
the formations of meaning and works of culture that 
Husserl also qualifies as "ideale Sinngebilde." These, 
in order to be what they are, must bc comprehensible 
by anyone, expressible in discourse, and translatable 
from one language to another. The ideal objectivity 
of significations is the condition for their communi-
cability. Every language is built up entirely beginning 
from such ideal objectivities. Each word only comes 
but ance into the language; it is the element ofthe iden-
tica] meaning intended in innumerable expressions in 
which it can take part. In fact, the word enjoys a triple 
ideality. 
( 1) On the level of expressian as such, on the level 
of its phonological and graphic structure, and inside 
a historical language, each word is unique and not 
confused with any of its utterances. The speaker or 
reader recognizes it each time as the same word, even 
though its semantic content varies from one locutor to 
another, from one employment to another, from one 
context to another. 
(2) On the semantic level of"the unity ofsignifica-
tion," the word intends an identica! content ofmeaning 
across expressions belonging to different languages or 
across its different usages. The ideal identity ofthe sig-
nification is again what assures its translatahility and 
its reiterability in multiple occurrences in which the 
word takes part, ali the while being independent ofthe 
subjectivity of the subject and of the particular speech 
act. 
(3) On the third level, which no longer actually 
concerns language as such, the ideality is that of the 
abject or intended state of affairs. This is empirically 
conditioned as much by the perceptual acts of appre-
hension as by the two strata of ideality and by the 
objective reality itself. It follows that the signification 
of a word is never absolutely translatable nor commu-
nicable withaut remainder; various intuitive acts may 
be able to fulfill the intention of signification in var-
ious situations, but these fulfillments coincide neither 
necessarily nor perfectly due to the fact that the ideal-
ity of the meaning of language is of the same kind as 
what Husserl calls "bound" in opposition to the "frec" 
idealities (logical-mathematical formations): they al-
ways make reference to an empirica! subjectivity and 
are linked to some particular spatiotemporal territory. 
Every expression not only has its signification, but 
also relates through it to the objects that it names-
this actual psychic Erlehnis, that real state of affairs, 
or this or that situation that it renders in somc man-
ner manifest. In an optative utterance there is "partial 
coincidence" between the desire as abject, as signified 
by the utterance, and the desire expressed as subjective 
lived experience. In this case, the signification is the 
desire thought about, signified by words, not the de-
sirefelt. This is the distance that separates the gestural 
language of animals, to which some claim to reduce hu-
man speaking, from discursive language, the essential 
moment ofwhich is the uttered signification. 
A widespread notion claims to reduce language to 
its sole metaphoric function and to assimilate significa-
tion to the images that the word eventually evokes, as 
if comprehending an expression came down to finding 
the images that relate to it, and failing to do so would 
render the expression empty of meaning and incom-
prehensible -~as if the signification of a word were 
nothing other than the image ofthe matter designated. 
This hypothesis is denied by a large part of abstract 
vocabulary, even the most common of our everyday 
languages (science, government, freedom, differential 
calculus). Husserl refutes it as part ofthe nominalistic 
tradition that reduces the signification to the word it-
self, for to comprehend a word without thinking ofthe 
matter it represents is to have before the mind not the 
simple linguistic sign, but the singular act that confers 

LANGUAGE IN HUSSERL 
405 
its signification and its reference to the object upon it. 
To deprive a word of its function of signifying is to 
remove its character as a name and to reduce it to a 
mereflatus vocis. 
The expression always intends an object, a state of 
affairs, and by means of its signification it names it, 
but it does not, in the proper sense ofthe word, express 
it. The relation between words and things has some-
thing mysterious about it and one can legitimately ask 
whether or not there is correspondence between the ex-
pressive acts and the intuitive or perceptual acts through 
which the designated object can be grasped. Everything 
happens as ifthe word comes tobe placed on the object 
perceived, as if it comes to makc up part of it. Yet for 
Husserl, it is not the words and the things that enter 
into relation, but the expressive acts and the acts of in-
tuitive fulfillment in which things present themselves. 
And ifthe act ofsignifying harbors a reference to the 
object, provided the intention to signify animates the 
linguistic signifier, discourse occurs, even ifthe inten-
tion is neither fulfilled nor confirmed by an intuition. 
That is how one can speak without knowing or see-
ing. Thus signifying does not imply, either necessarily 
or in essence, the perception of the object, and lan-
guage fulfills its significational function regardless of 
the real object that it refers to. Utterances bearing upon 
a perceived object are perfectly independent ofthe per-
ception that 1 ha ve of it and can be comprehended by an 
interlocutor who does not have the object designated 
before his or her eyes. An expression is speech only if 
it can be comprehended in the absence of the object, 
outside of its real presence. But to pass from the per-
ceived "white color" to the utterance "this is white" 
adds nothing to the sense-content ofthe perceived, nor 
does it deform it. Every sense perceived, remembered, 
or imagined is susceptible of being expressed- this 
is the universalizable sayability of the sense- but to 
be the object of discourse, the sense must be registered 
in the order of linguistic signification. 
To use an expression "meaningfully" and to relate 
to the object that it represents is one and the same 
act, whether the intended object is real or fictional. 
In return, to posit that only the expression that relates 
to a real object is endowed with signification is to 
posit wrongly that an expression to which no real ob-
ject corresponds is devoid of signification. To identify 
signification and real object would come down to ban-
ishing most of the expressions of ordinary language 
(metaphors such as "mountain of gold") as devoid of 
signification. That there is a genuine difference be-
tween signification and intended abject is attested to by 
the very existence ofthe plurality ofhuman languages 
with phonetically dissimilar expressions but equivalent 
significations. Beyond this and contrary to an old and 
purely taxonomie notion, a language is not uniquely 
composed of common nouns designating objects and 
conveying significations that are independent, quasi-
self-sufficient, while others ( e.g., prepositions) that are 
dependent are not meaningful except as "composed 
with" autonomous significations. 
Finally, the last major thesis of Husserl 's the-
ory of language: no matter how intimate the con-
nection between language, grammar, and LOGIC. we 
must guard against confusing them. The often evoked 
logical-grammatical parallelism between concepts, 
judgments, reasonings, and their forms of grammatical 
expression does not exist either in fact or in principle. 
It would be naive to seek a logica! distinction behind 
every explicit grammatical distinction even though the 
alliance is close between acts of thinking and acts of 
speech. For there to be discourse, it is nevertheless 
necessary that the elements making it up are arranged 
in conformity with certain rules in order to form a 
unity of signification. Every language is based upon 
such a logical-grammatical system. It is not so much 
that there is a strict correspondence between the gram-
matical structure of discourse and the logica! structure 
of thought as it is unnecessary to presuppose the ex-
istence of an ideal, thoroughly logica!, language that 
must serve as a model for ali empiricallanguages. No 
language is more logica! than another, no one obeys 
better than another the logical/aws that determine the 
correctness of thought. 
But in every language there is something like an a 
priori architecture, an "ideal armature" that ali natu-
ral languages more or less imperfectly incarnate, for 
the grammatical rules they obey do not result from the 
pure and simple application of logica! laws, but rather 
from their long and confused histories. They were born 
in great part from the hazards of circumstance, from 
the manifold cultural and historical inftuences that they 
undergo. Every language includes a predetermined sys-
tem of categories of signification by virtue of which a 
word is a noun, a verb, an adjective, an adverb, etc., 

406 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
and also includes the laws that regulate the possibil-
ity or impossibility of combining such significations 
and such words; it thus establishes the conditions for a 
coherent discourse, the purpose of which is the intel-
ligible expression and communication of a meaning. 
The pure logica! grammar that Husserl conceives of 
and relates to the tradition of grammaire gimerale et 
raisonnee has as its goal to specify the conditions for a 
discourse to be a genuine discourse- to define "rules 
of coherence," independent of the intended objective 
reality, to determine which combinations of words be-
longing to different categories do not occasion any 
genuine signification, even if the combined elements, 
taken one by one, are perfectly supplied with meaning. 
Breaking with his initial thesis, Husserl insists in 
his last writings on the signifying act as such and its 
incarnation in acts of effective speech. He writes of 
"spiritual corporeality," holding that like the objectiv-
ity of the meaning, language is founded in a historical 
intersubjectivity and that the linguistic expression is 
always doubly enrooted, i.e., in the subjective acts of 
the speaker and in the significations already instituted 
and sedimented in the language the speaker speaks and 
actualizes through his or her speech. The speaking sub-
ject is no longer the passive witness ofthe emergence 
of significations in the act of discourse nor the disin-
terested spectator assisting at the genesis of sense in 
the objective structures instituted without and indepen-
dent ofthe speaker. Meaning engenders itselfin living 
speech by the institution of new unities of meaning; 
it is aii at once the presence of an already constituted 
sense and the genesis of a sense constituting itself. But 
like every formation of sense, language is rooted in 
the LIFEWORLD and is founded in predicative and pre-
predicative experience of this lived world that is as 
much subjective as intersubjective. Thus Husserl re-
covers the speaking subject and his or her Lebenswelt 
that from now on is a world constituted by and within 
language.

LAW 
Most of the relationship of phenomen-
ology and law has been tangential rather than substan-
tive because principal figures in the phenomenological 
movement ha ve either been content merely to refer to 
law in passing or because, when giving it more de-
tailed attention, they have done so in other contexts 
and for different purposes. EDMUND HUSSERL is an ex-
ample of the former, and for the latter one can think 
of MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY's varied comments about 
law in the framework of politics and language, and 
ALFRED scHuTz's remarks about law in terms of sub-
jective and objective meanings of group categories. 
Only occasionally have anything like full-fledged phe-
nomenologies of law appeared. 
The relationship between phenomenology and law 
has also been tangential in the reverse direction, i.e., 
in the ways that diverse legal philosophers outside 
the movement have found some inspiration in it for 
their understanding of law. For instance, certain Latin 
American legal philosophers have appropriated MAX 
SCHELER's and NICOLAI HARTMANN'S phenomenoJogies 
of objective values. This group includes the Spanish-
Mexican jurist LUIS RECASENS SICHES, who has tried to 
square the objectivity of legal values with the his-
toricity of the ideals they embody, and the Argen-
tinean philosopher, CARLOS coss1o, who has tried to 
blend phenomenological and existentialist thinking 
with Hans Kelsen's (1881-1973) nea-Kantian "pure 
theory" oflaw to developa view oflaw as "egological 
object." Cossio 's ma in interes! is judicial decis ion mak-
ing, but his analyses are not much different from what 
one finds in the work of philosophers and jurists well 
outside phenomenology such as Roscoe Pound ( 1870-
407 
1964), Benjamin Cardozo ( 1870-1938), Oliver Wen-
dell Holmes Jr. ( 1841-1935), and Lon Fuller (1902-
1978). 
Philosophers outside the phenomenological move-
ment ha ve also found inspiration in it in terms of the 
"nature of things" (Natur der Sache) view of law. 
Rooted in the 19th century, though mainly developed 
in France and Germany after World War II, this the-
ory sought to avoid both legal positivism and natural 
law theories. lts practitioners held that judges should 
be guided by the "nature of the thing" to which legal 
norms are applied and that a proper appreciation ofthe 
former should shape the latter. The Natur der Sache 
approach to law is mosi closely associated with Gus-
tav Radbruch ( 1878-1949) in Germany and Franc;ois 
Geny ( 1861-1959) in France, whose work embodies 
the "nature of things" view without the explicit labei. 
Their work actually had very little to do with pheno-
menology, but, following them, WERNER MAIHOFER did 
make much more use of phenomenology and also de-
veloped a much more expansive use of this approach 
to law. 
Rejecting existential thinkers who isolate the indi-
vidual and insist on an extreme individualism, Mai-
hofer argues for a contrasting solidary view ofthe self. 
With this change in view, the Natur der Sache view 
of law becomes a tool for constructing a fu ture world 
worthy of being lived. Correlatively, for him, despite 
the original intentions ofthe Natur der Sache view, the 
latter leads to natural law theory conceived not as ide-
ology, but as a utopia- a picture of a fu ture existence 
worth striving for. Unhappily, though, the Natur der 
Sache view has not always avoided discrediting ide-
ologies. As Wolfgang Friedmann has pointed out, this 
view was used by the West German Supreme Court 
in 1953 to argue that, under the Bonn Constitution of 
1949, it was in the "nature of things" that the husband 
represent the family to the "outer world" and that the 
wife 's proper sphere is the "inner order" of the hom~. 
(Maihofer himselfsharply criticized this decision.) 
There are diverse other ways in which legal philoso-
phers outside the phenomenological movement have 
been influenced by it. Much of this work has been 
published in France, Germany, ltaly, and Latin and 
South America; for a bibliography, see Paul Amse-
lek Methode phenomenologique et theorie du droit

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
and Simone Goyard-Fabre. But as Amselek has com-
plained, much of this work is valueless because the 
word "phenomenology" is used only as a convenience 
tabel rather than as a way to give us any insight into 
what an adequate phenomenology of law might be. 
For that one has to consult the works of Amselek and 
Goyard-Fabre themselves, as well as those of a hand fut 
of other philosophers. 
In the beginning of the phenomenological move-
ment, GERHART HUSSFRL, son ofthe founder and a lawyer 
in his own right, contributed severa! works on philos-
ophy and law. But the most important early work in 
the fie)d came from ADOLF REINACH, a Jeader in REALIS-
TIC PHENOMENOLOGY. In "Die apriorischen Grundlagen 
des biirgerlichen Rechtes" ( 1913), he explores the sig-
nificance of the promise for understanding civil law 
-
say, in interpreting contracts. He considers that a 
promise already has a pre-legal essence because it is 
an example of social acts in which it is already situ-
ated. He goes on to develop an ontology ofthose social 
acts through which legal norms are created, though his 
ma in interest is in the legal objects of those acts- for 
example, property, claims, duties, etc. 
For Reinach, these legal objects are not timeless en-
tities such as Platonic forms. Rather, they are tempo-
ral objects subject to creative and destructive acts. He 
wants to inquire into the essential laws- the essences 
-of, say, property, that guide such acts. Or again, it 
is part of the essence of a claim that it can be satisfied 
in a limited number of ways- by being waived, ful-
filled, or disavowed. Thus something essential about 
the nature of claims controls the positive law in terms 
of the ways that claims can be terminated. Of course, 
positive law might interfere in relationships that make 
up the essence of some legal object such as property 
or claims. It might decide that, say, claims under wills 
would not be honored if the heir murdered the testa-
tor to get the inheritance. But such possibilities only 
show, for Reinach, how the positive law depends on 
an essential law and that the latter would prevail in the 
absence of the former. There is an a priori ontologica) 
law expressed in the legal object such as a claim that 
the positive law finds rather than invents. 
A priori legal structures thus underlie social acts. 
Social acts are rather like processes, as Stanley L. Paul-
son has nicely argued, and legal nonns in any given 
legal system are the analogous products that embody 
the a priori legal structures. For instance, there is an a 
priori essence of correlativity such that social acts that 
generate legal norms will ha ve their discussion of cor-
relativity ofrights and duties governed by that a priori 
essence. 
One example that Reinach considers is the concept 
of obligation as it obtains in the law of contract. Here 
there is a correlativity controlled by a priori ontologica) 
laws that makes possible the obligation and the claim 
embodied in the social act of contracting. Positive law 
does not create the correlativity, but rather discovers it. 
One illuminating aspect ofReinach 's descriptions of 
the social acts through which legal norms are created 
is the issue ofhow the social acts involved differ from 
commands. Acts, he tells us, are either spontaneous 
or nonspontaneous. The former he further divides into 
the internat and the social, and within both categories 
there is a further distinction between those necessarily 
referring to another person and those not so. Issuing 
commands does necessarily involve such a reference, 
and commanding is a social act that also requires com-
munication. Such acts ha ve purposes that are objects of 
the acts, but not purposes achieved through their mere 
performance. Legally issuing norms, on the other hand, 
achieves its goat simply through their enactment. What 
had been unregulated is now regulated. For instance, 
Section One of the German Civil Code provides that 
"the legal capacity of an individual begins at birth." 
No one here is being commanded at any future time, 
and the legal norm does not depend on a command for 
its being and validity. 
A 
second 
major 
essay 
in 
the 
phenomen-
ology of law consists of PAUL AMSELEK 's Methode 
phenonu?nologique et theorie du droit ( 1964 ). The book 
seeks to avoid alt the unhelpful "phenomenological" 
excurses into law mentioned above by limiting itselfto 
a pure description of the ei dos of law and situating it 
onan existential plane-the relationships people have 
with it. The author sees a close analogy here both with 
Kelsen's "pure theory" of law- i.e., law purified of 
any politica) ideology- and with Husserl's struggle 
to distinguish phenomenology from psychology. 
For Amselek, the eidos of law has three kinds of 
elements. First, there are generic norms that are nei-
ther mental representations nor pure concepts. Rather, 
they serve as existential models for human conduct by 
permitting law to serve certain social aims. Law as a 

LAW 
nonn is seen as a tool or model for measuring what is 
expected in social behavior. 
The second kind of element in the essence of law 
consists of specific norms that are ethical in character, 
and that take on the function of commands. By "ethi-
cal" Amselek does not mean to defend one normative 
ethical theory rather than another or, still less, to at-
tempt a fusion of law and morality as in natural law 
theories. Rather, the meaning is that human beings ha ve 
a self-directive capacity unshared by other life forms 
and inanimate objects, and ethical norms in law guide 
our autonomous actions. Such norms are oftwo kinds, 
those that are imperative and those that are permissive. 
Although Amselek admits that it is odd to talk of per-
missive commands, he insists that both permissive and 
imperative norms are commands because both instruct 
us to do or to abstain from doing something. 
Insofar as the command theory goes, Amselek 
agrees with Kelsen, but he also disagrees with the lat-
ter's view that law consists of orders to officials to 
impose punishment for breaches of law. Legal norms 
do not present themselves to us as coercive, but they 
do manifest themselves as compulsory. Law is compul-
sory because. Reinach notwithstanding, ali legal norms 
are commands of public officials to direct human be-
havior. This is in fact the third kind of eidetic element 
that law possesses. 
SIMONE GOYARD-FABRE's Essai de critique phenomen-
o/ogique du droit (Essay in phenomenological critque 
of law, 1970) offers us another substantive essay in 
the phenomenology of law. She agrees with Amselek 
that human behavior is thoroughly regulated by law, 
and that law is neither a mere surface phenomenon in 
society nor an ensemble ofideas. Rather, law envelops 
us; it is a modality of human life. And she also shares 
his desire to get inside law rather than discuss it from 
the outside, to trace the origin of the phenomenon of 
law to its roots. For this to occur, we must first bracket 
previous theories of law to prepare the ground for a 
pure description of the legal world. Then we must ef-
fect a critica! reduction to uncover the principles and 
foundations of law. This second task is a reflective 
scrutiny of the legal world and its ultimate source in 
consciousness. 
For Goyard-Fabre, phenomenological description 
of law reveals it as a normative order that has an ap-
titude for organizing and regulating society. Law re-
409 
places mere aggregations of people with their associ-
ation as citizens. With this legal expression of public 
order, people are no longer independent entities ex-
isting partes extra partes, but members of an organic 
whole with powers, rights, and obligations. Legal nor-
mativity presents itself to us both as organizational 
structure and prescriptive injunction. It is not identica! 
to moral normativity, but rather has a factual existence 
in and through the ways that legal texts and judgments 
are applied to facts to create a normative order. The 
phenomenon tobe studied is therefore sociallife itself. 
The phenomenon of law provides the abject of the 
science of law, and this topic in turn leads Goyard-
Fabre to a discussion of Kelsen 's theory. She is in-
spired by the latter, but ultimately refuses to endorse 
it because of obscurities in his concept of the "basic 
norm" ( Grundnorm) for establishing legal validity. She 
prefers instead the radicality of Husserl's phenomen-
ology, which better permits us to grasp the foundations 
oflaw through an eidetic analysis ofthe essence ofthe 
juridica!. She wants to pursue a genealogy of law in the 
same sense that Husserl sought a genealogy of logic in 
his Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901 ). 
One valuable aspect of Goyard-Fabre's objective 
descriptions of "le phenomene juridique" consists of 
her rejection ofthe command theory oflaw endorsed in 
different forms by John Austin, Kelsen, and Amselek. 
She rejects the command theory for reasons much the 
same as those used by H. L. A. Hart in The Concept of 
Law (1961 ). For instance, she argues that pennissive 
norms are not, as against Amselek, commands because 
we do not live them that way, and it is misleading to 
describe them as such. Law does not manifest itself 
to us as an imperative so much as it does as advice. 
It expresses what deserves to be in order to regulate 
appropriate behavior. 
For Goyard-Fabre, as for Husserl, descriptions of 
the phenomena lead back to an examination of our 
consciousness of the phenomena, and it is this turn to-
ward the reflective attitude that allows us to attain the 
foundation of law and understand the final reason for 
its dynamic and structure. In other words, from pure 
description we proceed to a CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMEN-
Ol.OGY ofthe legal by seeking the transcendental func-
tion of consciousness that makes law possible. This 
turns out to be the interna! teleology of consciousness 
that drives us toward order. The normative structure 

410 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
of consciousness is such that there is a basic need for 
order, which, although never complete, unavoidably 
imposes itself upon life. Positive law is its concrete 
expression: it makes explicit reason 's transcendental 
lawgiving power just as, correlatively, we find in law, 
the fundamental legal dimensions of consciousness. 
The original need for order is the source for law as 
well as the first pure expression of the juridica!. 
Two other major phenomenological incursions into 
law go in opposite directions. The first is WILLIAM A. 
LUIJPEN's Phenomenology of Natural Law ( 196 7). This 
book attempts to defend natural law against legal pos-
itivism and bases its case on an EXISTENTIAL PHENO-
MENOLOGY construed broadly enough to include the 
works of not only MARTIN HEIDEGGER, but also Soren 
Kierkegaard. Luijpen argues that we have an implicit 
knowledge of justice revealed by the natural light of 
reason. This traditional concept of lumen naturale is 
described, however, in Heideggerian terms as "uncon-
cealment," "disclosure," etc. What is disclosed is that 
we ha ve a pre-thematic awareness of justice grounded 
in our perception of human beings as being-for-the-
other. Furthermore, this being-for-the-other is a pos-
ture of love that is described as an acknowledgment 
of the other's rights as subject. The essence of inter-
subjectivity contains at least the demand that we have 
to-be-for-the-other. 
For Luijpen, founding a legal order is the first step 
toward effectively humanizing many forms of coexis-
tence or -
to use the Hobbesian metaphor of which 
he is fond- taming the "wolf' of barbarism within 
us ali. The positive law is created to proiect our ability 
to affirm the other as subject, and this law in turn is 
grounded and justified by its minimum content of jus-
tice, i.e., its ability to keep us from destroying the other. 
Justice and law both originale from love, understood 
as the way one subject can be oriented to another. 
But such an approach leaves obvious problems not 
adequately dea It with here. JEAN-PAUL SARTRE's Critique 
de la raison dialectique ( 1960), for example, gets crit-
icized because it does not ascribe any meaningfulness 
to love in constructing a genuine intersubjectivity. But 
what about legitimate conflicts ofinterest and different 
perceptions of the demands of justice, which make up 
much of the daily life of the law and politica! debate, 
and for which appeals to being-for-the-other seem par-
ticularly unhelpful? 
It is also the case that, as Luijpen points out, the le-
gal order itself can degenerate and yield the possibility 
of human destruction. This is the subject of the last, 
and most interesting, part ofthe book. Here the author 
discusses war and peace, just war theories, and a de-
fense of the view that nuclear wars can never be just. 
This part ofthe text can be understood and appreciated 
independently of what preceded it because it neither 
relies on nor embodies any phenomenology. 
The last major phenomenological incursion into law 
is ]argeJy unknown. It is HERBERT SPIEGELBERG's Gesetz 
und Sittengesetz (Law and moral law, 1935). Only its 
preface has been translated into English (by E. F. Car-
ritt at Oxford in 1939). This work was written in 1931 
and 1932 and submitted as the author 's Habilitations-
schrift to become a Privatdozent in the University of 
Munich. However, the Nazi takeover of 1933 prevented 
the examination from taking place and Spiegelberg 
went to Zurich, where the book was eventually pub-
lished. Within the context of a REALISTIC PHENOMEN-
OLOGY, Spiegelberg delineates no fewer than sixteen 
different meanings of norms organized in fi ve broad 
categories: those that refer to the MEANINGs of concrete 
objects, states of affairs, logica! functions, and episte-
mological concepts, and finally those that explain these 
others in everyday language. He defends this phenom-
enal diversity against Kelsen 's theory, which reduces 
ali meanings of legal norms to commands. In arguing 
that the command theory is unhelpful for understand-
ing various senses of legal norms, Spiegelberg gives 
us an early example ofwhat would be discussed much 
]ater in The Phenomenological Movement ( 1982), i.e., 
opposing the phenomenologist's restorative brush to 
the tradition 's reductivist razor. In this context he also 
praised Reinach 's work on law as the only work that 
transcends the unilluminating tradition of legal theory. 
To conclude, there are in the English-speaking 
world today at least three philosophers doing work in 
the phenomenology of law. NEIL DUXBURY completed 
his doctoral dissertation on Reinach at the London 
School ofEconomics in 1985 and is interested in prob-
lems of law and power as discussed in critica] legal 
studies. In "Towards a Phenomenology of Legal Think-
ing" (1992), MICHAEL SALTER tries to investigate the es-
sential structures of legal thought. He bases his study 
on a HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY. Such thinking, 
he tells us, provides us the legal forms through which 

LAW 
we understand our experience ofvarious legal phenom-
ena and institutions: courts, legislatures, positive law, 
etc. We are then in a position to judge the adequacy of 
those institutions in the light ofthose experiences. 
Salter 's phenomenology of legal thinking is part of 
a broader plan to produce a phenomenology of legal 
experience in general. He considers, and intends to 
show, that his results will diametrically oppose those 
of analytical positivism in Austin and Hart, Kelsen's 
pure theory oflaw, and various thinkers associated with 
legal realism in America and Scandinavia. 
Lastly, WILLIAM s. HAMRICK has contributed a num-
ber of papers as well as An Existential Phenomen-
ology of Law: Maurice Merleau-Ponty ( 1987). That 
work tries to develop the main outlines of an EXIS-
TENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY of Jaw within the context of 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY'S phenomenoJogy of the SO-
cial world. He seeks to answer two main questions. 
First, if Merleau-Ponty had written a phenomenology 
oflaw, what would it have looked like? And second, if 
his phenomenological descriptions of the social world 
are correct -
as the author argues that they mostly 
are- what are the philosophical consequences for an 
adequate understanding oflaw? The answer to this sec-
ond question involves comparing and contrasting what 
Merleau-Ponty himself says about law with the views 
of severa! thinkers mentioned above, as well as others 
in mainstream legal philosophy. 
In the course of describing the origin of law and 
its essential structures, law and society, and law and 
morality, Hamrick shows, among other things, how 
Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of language can ex-
plain Hart's view of law as a combination of primary 
and secondary rules while also transcending Hart's 
positivism. This accomplishment disproves Roscoe 
Pound's assertion (in his Jurisprudence) that pheno-
menology is unimportant in the philosophy of law 
because its work had already been done by the rule 
skeptics of American legal realism. 
Looking to the future, there are severa! important 
tasks fac ing phenomenologists oflaw. On the one hand, 
they need to consolidate the gains they have made in 
order to determine whether the phenomenon of law 
can best be described within the context of existen-
tial phenomenologies and/or from the perspective of 
philosophers such as Husserl and Reinach. Freed from 
the allegiances ofprevious generations to one camp or 
411 
the other, it may be possible now to combine the best 
insights ofboth in a more adequate synthesis. 
Second, these revised descriptions should take into 
account discussions in the philosophy of law over the 
last two decades or so about a number of important 
issues. These include the relationship ofrules and prin-
ciples- e.g., in Ronald Dworkin 's criticisms of legal 
positivism. There is also a good deal of contemporary 
skepticism about the possibility of the objectivity of 
justice and the existence of law at ali as opposed to 
different types of power struggles -
as one finds in 
a variety of critica! legal theorists and postmodernists. 
And third, there are POSTMODERNISM's attacks on the 
universality ofreason underlying the project ofmoder-
nity in fa vor of a reason more limited to ("embedded" 
in), and not valid outside, particular historical contexts. 
In the legal world as well, such criticisms are crucial 
sin ce from them stern conceptions of rights and respon-
sibilities and the treatment of prisoners.

EMMANUEL LEVINAS 
Levinas was born in 
Kaunas (Lithuania) on January 12, 1906 ( or, according 
to the Julian calendar that was used then, on Dccember 
30, 1905). His parents were practicing Jews and mem-
bers of an important Jewish community in which study 
ofthe Talmud was practiced ata high level. As a child, 
Emmanuel learned to read the Bible in Hebrew, while 
Russian was the language in which he was educated. 
This enabled him to read the great novelists and po-
ets Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, etc., writers 
who, together with Shakespeare, remained important 
to his thinking. In 1916, during World War I, the family 
moved to Kharkov in the Ukraine, where Emmanuel 
attended high school and experienced the upheaval of 
the Revolutions of February and October 1917. 
In 1920, the family returned to Lithuania. In 1923, 
Emmanuel travelled to Strasbourg, where he matricu-
lated at the university, after having studied Latin for one 
year. In his autobiographic "Signature" (1963/1966) 
as well as in the interview Ethique et infini ( 1982), 
he mentions Charles Blondei ( 1876-1939), Henri 
Carteron, Maurice Halbwachs ( 1877-1945), and Mau-
rice Pradines ( 1874--1958) as the four professors who, 
for him, embodied ali the virtues ofthe French univer-
sity. These years also mark the beginning ofhis lifelong 
friendship with Maurice Blanchot. 
Having obtained his License in philosophy, on the 
advice ofGabrielle Pfeiffer, with whom he !ater trans-
lated Cartesianische Meditationen [ 1931 ], Levi nas be-
gan his study of EDMUND IIUSSERl's Logische Unter-
suchungen ( 1900--1901 ). Phenomenology, and espe-
cially the analysis of INTENTIONALITY and its horizons, 
revealed entirely new ways ofthinking, different from 
intuition, induction, deduction, or dialectics. He de-
cided to write a dissertation on Husserl's theory of 
intuition and spent the academic year of 1928-29 
in Freiburg im Breisgau, where he gave a presenta-
tion in one of Husserl 's last seminars. It was MAR-
TIN HEIDEGGER, however, who, through his Sein und 
Zeit ( 1927) and his teaching, impressed Levi nas as the 
greatest innovator and a great thinker on the level of 
Plato and KANT. In 1929, Levinas attended the famous 
encounter between ERNST CASSIRER and Heidegger in 
Davos, where he explained parts of Sein und Zeit to 
some French scholars. After returning to Strasbourg, he 
defended his dissertation, La theorie de l'intuition dans 
la phenomenologie de Husserl ( 1930), which received 
a prize from L 'Institut. This book had been preceded by 
a long review article on Husserl 's Ideen zu ei ner reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 (1913) in the Revue Philosophique de la France 
et de l'Etranger ( 1929). Through these and !ater publi-
cations on Husserl and Heidegger, Levinas introduced 
phenomenology to JEAN-PAUL SARTRE and other key fig-
ures ofpostwar philosophy in FRANCE. 
Levinas became a French citizen in 1930; he mar-
ried, performed his military service in Paris, and began 
to work at the school of the Alliance Israelite Uni-
verselle in Paris. This institution was a center that 
strived to emancipate Jews from countries around the 
Mediterranean, such as Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, 
Turkey, Syria, etc., through education. At the Sor-
bonne, Levinas attended the courses of Leon Brun-
schvicg ( 1869-1944) and ~ 
though irregularly ~ 
the 
famous lessons of Alexandre Kojeve ( 1902-1968) on 
HEGEL 's Phănomenologie des Geistes. at the Ecole des 
Hautes Etudes. There he also met Sartre, Jean Hyppo-
lite ( 1907-1968), and other future celebrities. He also 
participated in the monthly soirees of GABRIEL MARCEL. 
In his early Parisian years, Levinas began writing a 
book on Heidegger, but abandoned this project when 
Heidegger became involved with the Nazis. A frag-
ment ofthe book, "Martin Heidegger et !'ontologie," 
possibly the first essay on Heidegger in French, was

EMMANUEL LEVINAS

pub1ished in 1932. His next essay on Heidegger did 
not follow until 1948 and was the Spanish transla-
tion of a paper that Levi nas had given in 1940 to the 
students of Jean Wahl ( 1888-1974) at the Sorbonne. 
The French text appeared in 1949 in a collection of 
Levinas's articles on phenomenology, En decouvrant 
l"existence avec Husserl et Heidegger (Discovering ex-
istence with Husserl and Heidegger, 1949; augmented 
edition, 1967). 
Levinas's first thematic essay, "De l'evasion," was 
published in 1935. In retrospect, the central question of 
his ]ater work can be recognized in it: is it possible to 
transcend, in thinking, the horizon ofBeing? Although 
the question was not expressed in a polemic way, this 
essay was a first attempt by Levinas to wrestle free 
from Heidegger's ontology (as Levinas consistently 
ca lis Heidegger's "thought of Bcing"). 
In 1939, Levinas was called to serve in the war, 
where he functioned as an interpreter of Russian and 
German, and in 1940 he became a prisoner ofwar. As a 
French officer, he was not sent to a concentration camp 
but rather to a military prisoners' camp where he did 
forced labor in the forest. During his captivity he also 
read and discussed Hegel, Proust, Diderot, Rousseau, 
and others. Most members of his family in Lithuania 
were murdered by the Nazis. According to his own 
words, the forebodings, the reality, and the memory 
of the holocaust have always accompanied Levinas's 
thinking. 
His first personal book, most of which had been 
written during his captivity, appcared in 194 7, shortly 
after the war had ended. lts title, De l'existence a 
l'existant (From existence to the existent), clearly pro-
claims the need for a thought bcyond onto1ogy; it re-
verses the orientation of Heidegger's thought, which 
aims to transcend the "metaphysics" ofbeings (Seien-
des, l'etant, l'existant) to Being (Sein, etre, existence). 
Levinas points to another transcendence: the Good 
commands an exodus beyond the limits of Being. This 
book had bcen preceded in 1946 by the publication of 
a fragment of it under the title Ii y a. The expression "il 
y a" translates from the German es gibt (there is), but 
it receives an interpretation that is very different from 
Heidegger's: rather than the generosity of a radical 
giving, il y a is the name of a dark and chaotic in-
determinacy that precedes ali creativity and goodness. 
However, it was not until the 1951 article "L'ontologie 
est-elle fondamentale?" that Levinas presented an ex-
plicit critique of Heidegger's enterprise. 
In the context of postwar EXISTENTIALISM, where 
Marcel, Sartre, Camus, and others determined the 
philosophical scene, Levinas's first thematic publica-
tions went almost unnoticed, duc perhaps to their orig-
inality and extreme difficulty. But another publication 
of 1947 drew more attention. On the invitation of Jean 
Wahl, professor ofphilosophy at the Sorbonne and di-
rector ofthe parauniversitarian Ca/lege Philosophique, 
Levi nas gave a series offour lectures on "Time and the 
Other" (Le temps et l'autre) during the academic year 
of 1946--4 7. The text of these lectures was published 
in the same year as part of a collective book entitled 
Le choix, le monde, l'existence (Choice, world, exis-
tence ). Despite its sti li partially experimental character, 
it already expressed the core of ali of Levinas's ]ater 
work: the Other is the center, and TIME, as the ultimate 
horizon, determines the relations between the Other 
and the self. 
Until 1961, Levinas was known as a specialist in 
Husserlian and Heideggerian phenomenology, but his 
modest number of publications in the fie1d of phi-
losophy was no reftection of the fact that one of the 
most important thinkers of the century was preparing 
an impressive oeuvre. His contributions to philoso-
phy seemed far outweighed by his numerous essays 
on questions related to Jewish spirituality. Given his 
involvement in the education of foreigners at the Al-
liance's school, of which he had become the director 
in 194 7, and the fact that he did not hold an academic 
position ata French university, his inftuence in philoso-
phy was limited, as compared to his growing impact in 
the field of Jewish studies. After the war, he studied the 
Talmud under some ofthe best scholars and, in 1957, 
began giving a series ofTalmudic lessons of a personal 
nature at the annual colloquium of Jewish intellectuals 
who use the French Janguage. His philosophical fame 
was, however, established when he published Totalite 
et infini: Essai sur l'exteriorite ( 1961 ). This book was 
the ma in thesis that he presented for his doctorat d 'Etat, 
while the collection ofhis already published philosoph-
ical works was accepted as the complementary thesis. 
Soon his international fame led to many invitations 
and prompted an overwhelming number of papers on 
his philosophy. In 1961, Levi nas became professor of 
philosophy at the University of Poitiers and in 1967 

414 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
he was appointed to the University of Paris-Nanterre. 
From there he moved to the Sorbonne (Paris IV) in 
1973, where he became an honorary professor in 1976. 
He died in Paris on December 25, 1995. 
Totalite et infini proposes a revolution, not only in 
phenomenology, but with regard to the entire history 
of European philosophy, from Parmenides to Heideg-
ger. It even contains a critique ofthe whole ofWestern 
civilization, marked by the spirit ofGreek philosophy. 
Western thought and practice are ruled by a desire for 
totalization; an attempt is made to reduce the uni verse 
to an originary and ultimate unity by way of panoramic 
overviews and dialectica] syntheses. This monism must 
be criticized in the name of a thought that starts from 
the phenomena as they present themselves. Such a cri-
tique meets old traditions ofthought that reach back to 
Biblica] and Talmudic sources, but it is also perceptible 
in Plato and Descartes. Against such a Western "total-
itarianism" Levinas maintains that the human and the 
divine Other cannot be reduced to a totality of which 
they would only be elements. A truthful thought re-
spects the nonsynthesizable "separation" that charac-
terizes the relations between the Other and me, or-to 
borrow the terminology ofPlato 's Sophist- it respects 
the irreducible non-identity of the Same (tauton) and 
the Other (to heteron). The Same is clearly connected 
to the traditional subject, the EGO or consciousness of 
modern philosophy, a subject for whom the totality 
of beings is spread out as a panoramic uni verse, but 
the Other is associated with the Infinite. Whereas the 
category of totality summarizes the way in which the 
ego inhabits the world- its worldly economy- the 
infinite names the Other's ungraspable or incompre-
hensible character. "The Other" is in the first place 
the other human being 1 encounter; in a !ater develop-
ment it also stands for God. Levinas refers to the third 
of Descartes's Meditationes de philosophia prima for 
a formal analysis of the relation that simultaneously 
links and separates the Infinite and the ego, whose 
consciousness originarily contains "the idea of the In-
finite" and thus thinks more than it can fathom. His 
own, more concrete approach is given through a pheno-
menology ( or "transphenomenology") of the modes in 
which the human Other is revealed to me. The Other's 
face or speech ( or any other typically human aspect that 
manifests the Other) is revealed as a refutation of any 
totalitarian or absolutistic fonn of economy. Thus the 
Other presents him- or herselfneither as a phenomenon 
in the normal sense of phenomenology, for which ali 
phenomena belong to wider horizons, nor as a being 
within the totality of beings. "The face" transcends ali 
phenomenality and beingness and is, in this sense, "in-
visible," other than being, "ab-solved" and "absolute." 
The ego's contact with the Other's face or speech is in-
comprehensible but not unreal. It cannot be expressed 
in an ontologica] framework; the description must also 
use an ETHICAL terminology. To encounter another is to 
discover that I am under a basic obligation: the human 
Other's infinity reveals itself as a command; the fact 
of the Other 's "epiphany" reveals that I am his or her 
servant. 
The intentiona! ( or rather quasi-intentional) analy-
sis of the relation between the other and me reveals 
an asymmetrical relationship that precedes every pos-
sibility of choice or decision. Thc tension between this 
asymmetry and the economy ofthe ego 's enjoyment of 
the WORLD is unfolded in analyses of ali the topics of 
20th century philosophy such as ACTION, freedom, LAN-
GUAGE, BODY, PERCEPTION, VALUE, WOrk, HISTORY, )ove, 
death, etc., and many consequences for a radical trans-
formation ofphenomenology are made explicit. In con-
stant discussion with Heidegger, Levinas struggles to 
developa non-ontologicallanguage in order to express 
the beyond ofBeing, but, in doing so, he uses that very 
same language to overcome it. This struggle continues 
to lead in a direction that can already be perceived in 
those parts ofthe book that were written last. 
After 1961, Levi nas produced a considerable num-
ber of texts in which his second magnum opus was 
prepared. This was published in 1974 under the ti-
tie Autrement qu 'etre ou au-dela de 1 'essence (Other-
wise than Being or beyond essence). Clearer than De 
l 'existence a 1 'existant and Totalite et infini, this ti-
tie, a double translation of Plato 's characterization of 
the Good as "beyond the ousia," declares its inten-
tion to overcome ontology. Surprisingly new descrip-
tions of Being, interest, sensibility, language, ethics,

stitution, being a hostage, obsession, and persecution. 
Time is analyzed as radical diachrony. The unchosen

tivity. "Me voiei" (see me here; here I am) is shown to 
precede any self-consciousness, and God is referred to 
as having passed into an immemorial past, a passing 
that has left a trace from which the human Other rises 
up as primary command. 
The difficulty with any attempt to think beyond Be-
ing !ies in the philosophical unavoidability of a the-
matizing language. In thematizing the asymmetry of 
substitution, Levinas's text betrays the non-objective, 
nonthematic and non-ontologica! nature ofthat asym-
metry. The resulting incongruency is made explicit in 
the distinction between the Saying (le Dire) and the 
Said (le Dit). Philosophy produces instances of the 
Said, but every Said is preceded and transcended by a 
Saying, to which the Said must be brought back. This 
reduction refers all philosophical texts to the proxim-
ity of "the-one-for-the-other." If philosophy is !o ve of 
wisdom, it is also, and primarily, the wisdom of !o ve. 
The fact that Levinas not only published agreat deal 
on topics related to Judaism, but writes on God and RE-
LIGION in his philosophical work too has induced some 
interpreters to think that Levinas offers a masked the-
ology instead of a phenomenologically rooted philoso-
phy. Difjicile liberti? (Difficult freedom, 1963), Quatre 
lectures talmudiques (Four talmudic lectures, 1968), 
Du sacre au saint (From the sacred to the saint, 1977), 
and L'au-dela du verset (Beyond the verse, 1982) show 
his attachment to the Talmudic tradition; De Dieu qui 
vient a l 'idee (Of God who came to the idea, 1982) 
is an example of his philosophical concern about the 
question of God. Levi nas, however, and without ever 
denying his roots, always insists on the phi1osophi-
cal character of his work designated as such. In his 
philosophical studies he operates in a manner simi-
lar to Descartes, Hegel, or Heidegger; even when he 
quotes from the Bible, his argumentation does not ap-
peal to extraphilosophical authorities. All people able 
to read his texts are invited to validate the truth of his 
arguments on the hasis of their own experiences and 
thought. However, as a language that strives for uni-
versality, philosophy does not exclude the explicit and 
implicit thoughts of particular traditions and spiritual-
ities.

LITERA TURE 
Literature reflects the entire 
spectrum of human experience, presenting abundant 
themes for phenomenological investigation. Immedi-
ate, lived experience of literary works can be studied 
as a particular variety of aesthetic experience. Pheno-
menology can clarify the essential features of literary 
works as one class of aesthetic objects; it can inves-
tigate the character of subjective acts through which 
literary works are created, read, interpreted, and en-
joyed; it can consider the import of a given work as an 
expression ofhuman experience, a particular record of 
human concerns; it can attend to the same work as rep-
resenting a particular historical world in which human 
beings have found themselves situated. 
The immediate experience of litera ture, moreover, 
raises issues of more general nature. As linguistic com-
positions, literary works invite reflection upon the gen-
eral nature ofLANGUAGE in its various functions and its 
overall significance within subjective experience. As 
expressions of human subjective life, works of liter-
ature direct us to the widest questions of subjective 
and intersubjective experience. As representations of 
specific historical and cultural worlds, literary works 
solicit attention to the import ofthe experienced woRLD 
as the all-encompassing horizon of existence. As tex-
tual accomplishments crcated and read within preestab-
lished cultural settings, works of literature spur reflec-
tion upon the force of historical traditions, the chal-
lenges of interpreti ve understanding, and the continuai 
exchange ofreceived and novel conceptions ofhuman 
existence. 
Given this range of possibilities, there is no single 
phenomenological philosophy of literature; rather,just 
as the history ofthe phenomenological movement fea-
tures a variety of developments beyond the work of 
EDMUND HUSSERL, phenomenological studies of litera-
ture reflect these developments. Husserl himself, aside 
from occasional references to litera ture, never pursued 
a detailed theory ofliterature. Nevertheless, his pheno-
menology provides conceptual and methodological re-
sources that others ha ve utilized, in a variety of ways, 
for the study of literature. 
Of ali these thinkers, ROMAN INGARDEN'S work 
is most representative of a distinctively Husserlian 
phenomenological philosophy of literature. Although 
his work, compared to Husserl 's !ater work, re-
flects a sensibility more attuned with REALISTIC PHENO-
MENOLOGY, his analysis of the literary work recalls 
Husserl 's demand for rigorous criticism of subjective 
experience as a field of intended MEANING. Ingarden ap-
proaches the work strictly as it is intended in experience 
and articulates a general ontology ofthe work's partic-
ular manner of being. In this regard, his project uses 
EIDETIC METHOD on the work as a "purely intentionat 
object." Through adoption of a phenomenological ap-
proach, he resists the metaphysical presuppositions of 
idealism and realism. The literary work, phenomeno-
logically clarified, is neither a purely ideal object nor 
a purely real object. The experienced work is intrinsi-
cally tied in its meaning to the phonetically "material" 
textures of language; therefore, its being falls short of 
the pure ideality of a mathematical object, a meaning 
that completely transcends the empirica! reality of the 
language that expresses it. On the other hand, because 
the work is experienced as a formation of meanings, 
representing ideal, imaginative, or fictive entities, it is 
irreducible to the phonetic material of its signification. 
Existing purely as intended, the work remains bound 
to the empirica! reality ofits expressive language, even 
as it partially transcends the physical being of a book 
or the phonetic sounds recorded in it. Hamlet remains 
forever in Denmark, though my copy of Hamlet is lost 
and my recitation ofhis soliloquies forgotten. 
As a purely intentiona! object that cuts across the 
distinction between real and ideal objects, the work 
exists "heteronomously," governed both by the inte-
rior subjectivity of the reader and the intersubjective 
linguistic scheme of the text. As heteronomous, the 
work resists categorization either by positivistic or psy-
chologistic approaches. As a purely intentionat object, 
the work exists exclusively through inward, subjec-
tive experience of its meaning, a fact that positivism 
is ill equipped to reconcile. However, as a formation 
of meanings governed by a scheme of significations 
independent of any individual subjectivity, the work 
resists psychologistic reduction to the psychic experi-
ence of an author or a reader. The work, as a theme of 
experience governed by a textual scheme, transcends 
the psychic experience of the subject, even as it is 
made present only through the experience of a read-

ing or writing subject. Neither ideal nor real, reducible 
neither to individual psychic experience nor to the em-
pirica! existence of a series of linguistic utterances, 
the literary work is an essentially intersubjective phe-
nomenon. Tied as it is to a sequence ofpublicly acces-
sible linguistic significations, the work as experienced 
is a correlation of the individual streams of experience 
of author and reader. 
Ingarden's aim is to clarify the interplay ofthe var-
ious correlations between real, linguistic significations 
and ideal, represented meanings; between the given 
scheme of the work and the subjective experience of 
that scheme; and between the author's and reader's 
streams of subjective experience. To trace these cor-
relations as they contribute to the overall import of 
the work, he describes the work as a structure of var-
ious strata of meaningful contents. As heterogeneous 
elements of the work, these strata articulate the lev-
els of meaning unified through the sequential read-
ing ofwords, sentences, chapters, and so on. Ingarden 
distinguishes four basic strata: ( 1) the stratum of ver-
bal sounds, phonetic formations, and so forth, which 
serves as the empirically real basis of significations; 
(2) the centrally important stratum of semantic units 
of MEANING: the meanings of sentences and groups of 
sentences, which serve as basic "building blocks" of 
representational meaning; (3) the stratum of"schema-
tized aspects" of represented objects, in which, aspect 
by aspect, detail by detail, through the correlation of 
"semantic units" ofmeaning, particular represented ob-
jects are schematically brought to appearance; and (4) 
the stratum of fully realized represented objects and 
states of affairs, encompassing the "finished" import 
of the work, brought to maturity as representing an 
entire fictional "world." At this final level of accom-
plished meanings, the "serious" work, at least, conveys 
its philosophical or metaphysical import. Here, how-
ever, before this notion of strata, a note of caution is 
needed. Over the course of reading, the work is experi-
enced not as a piecemeal collection ofthese strata, but 
as an orchestrated, "polyphonic" unity of meanings. 
Analytically discrete, each stratum is essential to the 
experienced meaning of the work, but the work itself 
is experienced polyphonically, as a unified formation 
of meanings. 
This brings us to the manner in which the work is in-
tended by the reading subject. When reading a work of 
fiction, the reader adopts an attitude of"quasi-belief" in 
the states of affairs represented in the text. The declara-
tive sentences in a literary work are not regarded as ex-
pressing genuine judgments about the actual world, but 
"quasi-judgments" about a fictional world. The reader 
bestows upon the represented objects, characters, and 
events a character of reality short of genuine reality; 
the reader maintains an attitude of "make-believe" as 
he or she attends to the sequence of significations that 
express the meaning ofthe work. Reading amounts to 
a reorchestration in IMAGINATION of the strata of mean-
ings originally assembled in the work by its author. 
Therefore, Ingarden distinguishes the work from any 
o ne ofits individual readings, or "concretizations." The 
work itself is a merely schematic formation of mean-
ings riddled with "places of indeterminacy." Just as 
perception of the actual world is at best incomplete, 
dependent upon limited perspectiva! views of the per-
ceived object, literary description is never complete, 
however copious a descriptive style is employed by an 
author. An objectivity portrayed in the work- a thing, 
a person, a city, and so forth- is portrayed schemat-
ically, through a finite series of represented aspects. 
The reader thereby supplements the author's original 
scheme of meanings, imaginatively completing those 
aspects ofthe work that remain vague, ambiguous, un-
fulfilled, or only partially fulfilled. 
This notion of concretization replies to the problem 
of the plurality of interpretations. Each concretization 
of the work is unique, but given the inherent inter-
subjectivity of the work as a linguistic scheme, any 
particular concretization can be weighed for its rel-
ative accuracy. The work attains, to some degree, an 
independent, public, and objective existence. lts degree 
of determinacy depends upon its linguistic grace and 
the coherence it achieves as an orchestration of mean-
ings. Although the reader follows a scheme laid out by 
the author, it is a mere scheme; sites of indeterminacy 
inevitably disturb the agreement between concretiza-
tions, and the agreement achieved between author and 
reader is no exception. Relatively determinate as a rep-
resentational and expressive scheme, the work tran-
scends each concretization, including that which the 
author realizes in the moment of creation. The finished 
work subsists as an intersubjective scheme of poten-
tial experiences, a perpetually nascent formation of 
meanings. The work is fulfilled in numberless related

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
concretizations, mediated through the intersubjective 
adjudication of language. 
While Ingarden's analyses focus upon immediate 
experience of the work, other thinkers have turned 
to literature as an occasion for raising questions of 
somewhat wider scope. Philosophers associated with 
HERMENEUTICAL and EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY ex-
tend their analyses beyond the range of traditional aes-
thetic problems. These thinkers give primary emphasis 
to reflection upon the basic conditions of human ex-
istence. Therefore, philosophy of literature is attuned 
to the existential significance of litera ture as a cultural 
enterprise of se! f-definition and self-determination. 
MARTIN HEJDEGGER's work is chiefly concerned with 
issues of FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY; phenomenoJogical 
reflection is geared toward the origins of humanity's 
inherent understanding of Being. According to Hei-
degger, human existence is essentially endowed with 
a grasp of the meaning of Being, however vague that 
grasp remains; therefore, human existence is essen-
tially interpretive: understanding ofBeing already im-
plies interpretation of Being. Heidegger examines the 
conditions under which Being is interpreted and the 
ways in which this interpretation is borne out in human 
affairs. None the least of these affairs is the creation 
of works of art, includ ing literary works of art. Hei-
degger's work has therefore exercised considerable in-
fluence in 20th century literary theory. We may briefly 
distinguish two aspects of Heidegger's thought that 
bear relevance to the philosophy of litera ture. 
The first ofthese is a general theory of interpretation 
articulated in Sein und Zeit ( 1927), a theory seminal to 
the overall development of HERMENEUTICS. Hermeneu-
tics seeks to clarify the nature of interpretive under-
standing in general and the interpretation of linguistic 
texts in particular. In this context, the works of HANS-
GEORG GADAMER, PAUL RICCEUR, Hans Robert Jauss, and 
Mari o J. Val des are worthy of mention. Each of these 
thinkers has adopted Heidegger's basic orientation, in 
order to present more detailed theories of textual inter-
pretation. They share a sensitivity to the idea that in-
terpretation involves confrontation between two fields 
of meaning: that which is provided by the text, and 
most importantly, that which is brought to the text by 
the reader. Interpretation is essentially anticipatory, in-
scribed within a structure of preestablished meanings 
that Heideggercalled the "hermeneutica! circle." Since 
our understanding of a text is conditioned by the man-
ner in which we anticipate its meaning, as novel, as 
story, as poem, the practice of interpretation must re-
tain awareness of its own structure of anticipations. 
Such awareness is not intended to cleanse interpreta-
tion of its prejudices; according to this theory, unprej-
udiced interpretation is impossible in principle. Bereft 
of any preconception of what is to be interpreted, we 
would find ourselves unable even to begin the project 
ofinterpretation. Rather, in Gadamer's work reading is 
conceived as a dialogue between text and reader, and 
both text and reader contribute to a "fusion of hori-
zons" ofmeaning. Awareness ofwhat is brought to the 
text by the reader is intended to heighten the sense of 
confrontation between text and reader, to render that fu-
sion aware of itself for the sake of increasing the yield 
of unforeseen meanings. Hermeneutica! clarification 
of interpreti ve practices seeks chiefly to demystify the 
practice ofreading, on the one hand, and liberate it from 
misconceived ideals of objectivity, on the other. Truly 
"objective" reading is that which rccognizes itself as 
subjectively conditioned. 
Beyond the general theory of hermeneutica! under-
standing, another aspect of Heidegger's work is rel-
evant to our theme. Heidegger turned frequently to 
works of art and litera ture as expressions ofhumanity's 
interpretation ofBeing. His attention to creative works 
was militated by his view that Being, as the being of 
beings, resists disclosure through manners ofpresenta-
tion suited for the categorization of individual beings. 
Being as such, as a sense ofthe manner in which indi-
vidual beings exist, tends to conceal itself in any ordi-
nary concern for beings. The sense of Being, therefore, 
must be wrested out of particular entities through a cer-
tain form of phenomenological reflection -
through 
attention to the manner in which beings themselves in-
dicate a particular meaning of Being. Creative works 
of art and litera ture provide decisive subject matter for 
this sort of reflection, for the act of creation in a given 
medium is implicitly interpretive ofBeing. In any cre-
ative work, a particular interpretation of the self, the 
world, and the situation ofthe self in the world is borne 
out. 
Works of art and litera ture created in particular his-
torical epochs serve to disclose humanity's grasp of 
Being as it is interpretively understood within a par-
ticular epoch. The artistic or literary work serves as 

LITERA TURE 
419 
a localized "site" of expression in which is secured a 
particular presentation of a meaning of Being that oth-
erwise resists disclosure. The creative challenge ofthe 
visual or literary artist is to fashion a work, in a par-
ticular medium, that brings the meaning of Being into 
the open, into the world; the interpretive challenge of 
the audience or reader is to approach the work thought-
fully, to "preserve" it, such that the sense ofBeing that 
it discloses is further nurtured and is understood as a 
disclosure of Being. Literature, for Heidegger, serves 
as a critically important manifestation of humanity's 
understanding of itself as existing in the world, with 
Others, in a current of historical tradition, subject to 
the question of its own existence. 
For JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, the philosophical significance 
ofliterature lies in its status as a distinctive mode ofhu-
man ACTION. According to Sartre's EXISTENTIAL PHENO-
MENOLOGY, human beings are cast into the world in an 
ontologica] situati an of radical and unconditioned free-
dom. As a being for itself, the human being exists as an 
utterly indeterminate consciousness of self and world; 
the human being experiences itself authentically as a 
nothingness, a lack ofbeing and a desire for being. Hu-
man existence, in response to its freedom, is burdened 
with a total responsibility to choose itself, to project 
the manner in which it will pursue its being. The de-
cision to write, to express one's situation through the 
creati an of literary works, represents a specific variety 
of this "fundamental project." The creati an of literary 
works, therefore, is simultaneously an exercise in the 
creation ofthe self, the definition ofthe world, and the 
determinati an of values. Since literature originates in 
response to the basic condition of freedom, the prob-
lem offreedom also provides the sale authentic theme 
for literary expression. Sartre's own production as a 
writer provides ample testimony to this view. 
As a philosopher ofliterature, Sartre ca Ils for a liter-
ature of"engagement" committed to the enhancement 
of humanity's self-realization of freedom. Writing is 
at once a personal act ion and a politica! action .. Qne 
writes for the sake of oneself, but also for the sake of 
others. Writing represents a choice to confront one's 
freedom effectively or deficiently, in authentic recog-
nition offreedom or in the self-deceptive refuge ofbad 
faith; therefore, what is decisive in a literature of en-
gagement is the extent to which the issue offreedom is 
presented as a problem. I f the act of writing is to suc-
ceed as an authentic appropriation of freedom, then it 
must result in works that engage the reader's attention 
to his or her own situation as a radical responsibility 
to choose. It must also caii attention to the alienation 
of human freedom that results from humanity's situ-
atedness in politica! and social orders of enslavement. 
Sartre believed that a literature of"extreme situations" 
was best suited for pursuit of these goals. Works of 
fiction should depict situations in which characters are 
cast radically upon the issues of their own freedom, 
their total responsibility for their being, and the con-
tinuing exigency oftheir existential choices. 
Sartre's own considerable output in novels, short 
stories, and THEATER reflects this sensibility, and the 
same orientation can be found in the works of SI-
MONE DE BEAUVOIR. Reflection upon writing as an ex-
istential project is also the dominant motif of Sartre's 
literary criticism, most fully expressed in his biogra-
phies of authors such as Charles Baudelaire, Gustave 
Flaubert, and Jean Genet. MAUR! CE MERLEAU-PONTY has 
also touched upon issues of literature, usually in the 
context of a wider investigation into the phenomen-
ology of linguistic expression. 
ALFRED SCIIUTZ and MAURICE NATANSON offer inves-
tigations of literature that reflect some of the basic 
concerns of CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY. The Jiter-
ary work is examined as representing the lived experi-
ence of fictional human beings in fictional worlds. As 
a microcosm of subjective life, the literary work of-
fers insight into the manner in which the experienced 
world is constituted as a domain of typical and taken-
for-granted meanings. For Schutz and Natanson, how-
ever, the issue of meaning-constitution is understood 
as a fundamental question of INTERSUBJECTIVITY. The 
WORLD experienced in daily life is first and foremost a 
social world; its constitution as a field of shared, typ-
ified meanings must be referred back to a fundament 
of social action and interaction. On the basis of our re-
lations with one another, our share in a common stock 
of knowledge, our shared language, and our mutual 
recognition of one another as subjects for the world, 
the mundane world attains its particular meaning for 
us as the real domain of experience. The meaning-
constitution of the mundane world is a matter of on-
going, ifunreflected-upon, intersubjective negotiation. 
The value of litera ture, as a theme for phenomenologi-
cal inquiry, is its capacity to reflect, in a unified field of 

420 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
symbolic meanings, the originary status of subjective 
and intersubjective experience. Through the reading of 
the fictional work, we bear witness to the manner in 
which fictional characters come to terms with them-
selves, one another, and the sense of the world that 
they share. The fictional world, as a microcosm whose 
meaning is constituted through and for the interaction 
of fictional subjects, reflects our own constitution of 
the macrocosm, the world as experienced in daily life. 
Finally, the influence of phenomenological concep-
tions of litera ture is discemible in a variety of schools 
of literary criticism. Phenomenological concerns are 
recognizable within American New Criticism (Rene 
Wellek studied with Ingarden), within reader response 
theory ( the work OfWOLFGANG ISER on READING is partic-
ularly relevant), and within the Geneva school of criti-
cism (the works of George Poulet and Jean Starobinski 
are especially comparable with phenomenological ap-
proaches). Furthermore, although any detailed exam-
ination !ies beyond the scope of this survey, we must 
certainly note the historical importance of the rela-
tions between phenomenological theories of literature 
and the !ater theoretical movements of STRUCTURALISM, 
POSTMODERNISM, and CRITIC AL THEORY. PhenomenoJogi-
caJ criticism has, perhaps, enjoyed its heyday; never-
theless, its importance within the development of20th 
century literary criticism should not be overlooked. 
Phenomenological philosophies ofliterature ha ve pur-
sued a variety ofissues: clarification ofthe structure of 
literary works, reflection upon the practices of reading 
and writing, and criticism of the conditions of liter-
ary creation and interpretation; these questions remain 
central to the practice of literary criticism. In this re-
gard, the continuing relevance of phenomenological 
philosophy ofliterature is assured.

LOGIC 
LOGIC 
The phenomenology oflogic and MATH-
EMATICS is the main topic in EDMUND HUSSERL's earJy 
work, which culminates in the Logische Untersuchun-
gen ( 1900--1901 ). lts final version can be found in 
Formale und transzendentale Logik ( 1929), Etfahrung 
und Urteil ( 1939), sections in the !deen zu ei ner reinen 
Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 ( 1913 ), the Cartesianische Meditationen [ 1931 ], 
and lectures such as the Analysen zur passiven Synthe-
sis [ 1925/26]. 
Husserl 's conception oflogic was influenced by lo-
gicians and mathematicians of his time, first of ali the 
formalism of David Hilbert ( 1862-1943), but he never 
discussed the results of Kurt Godel ( 1906-1978). The 
Formale und transzendentale Logik distinguishes be-
tween logic as apophantic logic and logic as formal 
ontology. Apophantic logic analyzes logica! form in 
ordinary and formalized language. FORMAL ONTOLOGY 
investigates logica! forms as forms of objects in gen-
eral and includes pure mathematics, the theory of pure 
manifolds (structured sets). 
Three logica! disciplines can be distinguished. ( 1) 
First, there is the general theory of categorica] form, in-
cluding the pure logica! grammar separating meaning-
ful and meaningless expressions in apophantic logic. 
(2) The logic of consequence, i.e., of deductive infer-
ence, has as its principle the law of non-contradiction. 
The laws ofthe logic ofconsequence are also the laws 
governing the deductions of formal-ontologica! axiom 
systems of pure sets (rei ne Mannigfaltigkeiten). (3) The 
logic of TRUTH, i.e., semantics, is a general theory of 
modalization. The two-valued semantics of truth and 
falsity in classica1 logic presupposes the limiting case 
of perfect predicative and pre-predicative evidence of 
states of affairs. Many-valued logics and the semantics 
of"rossiBLE WORLDs" might today be viable candidates 
for Husserl 's project of a universal mathesis for the 
logic oftruth. 
The phenomenology of logic is for Husserl not 
merely one area ofphenomenological research among 
others. The EVIDENCE oflogical and mathematical truths 
is stronger than the fallible evidences of the empirica! 
sciences. AII attempts to explain their specific apodic-
ticity with the aid of a weaker evidence are spurious. 
PSYCHOLOGISM is such an attempt. A phenomenology 
of logic can be justified only if phenomenology itself 
starts with a first and apodictic cvidence. In the first edi-
421 
tion ofthe Logische Untersuchungen, phenomenology 
was sti li characterized as descriptive psychology. Such 
a phenomenology can prove that logica] objects are not 
mental entities, but it is as such still understood as a 
descriptive empirica] discipline. Looking back on the 
outcome ofthe Logische Untersuchungen, Husserl re-
alized that the descriptions there are actually descrip-
tions of a priori structures. He discovered in further 
reflections that even in this case phenomenology is a 
sublime psychologism and a proper target of GOTTLOB 
FREGE's and his own criticism ofpsychologism. 
The method of the Logische Untersuchungen im-
plies a sublime psychologism because the a priori sub-
jective structures ofthe givenness oflogical objects are 
still understood as the material a priori structures of a 
being in the world, and a material a priori in general 
presupposes the stronger evidence ofthe formal a priori 
of logic. He also admits !ater that his refutation of rela-
tivism in the Prolegomena zur reinen Logik ( 1900) was 
only a refutation ofpsychologistic NATURALISM and not 
a refutation of RELATIVISM in general, and thus did not 
include historism. Neither the Fregean nor the the Kan-
tian solution is acceptab1e in phenomenology because 
they rely on hypothetical substructions (transcenden-
tal arguments) that postulate either Platonic entities or 
an absolute subject. A phenomenology of logic can 
only be justified with the aid of the transcendental-
phenomeno1ogical reduction. 
Neither the significance of the phenomenology of 
logic for the development of the phenomenological 
method nor Husserl 's conception of logic was recog-
nized in the REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY of the ear]y 
phenomenologica1 movement. ALEXANDER PFĂNDER 's 
Logik ( 1921) is simply a manual of traditional logic; 
here logic is an independent discipline and is, together 
with phenomenology, a presupposition of epistemol-
ogy, while phenomenological investigations are useful 
only for investigating the relation of logica! forms to 
acts of thought and to intentiona! objects. They ha ve 
no significance for the clarification of logica! form 
as such. OSKAR BECKER was interested in fonnalized 
moda! logic, but not in a further development of the 
phenomenology of logic. MARTIN HEIDEGGER 's concep-
tion of logic includes formalized logic. His evaluation 
of the development of formal ontology is opposed to 
Husserl 's. Formal mathematics is, for him, the most 
deficient mode of thinking. A renewed interest in the

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
phenomenology oflogic occurs only in the phenomen-
ological movement in the UNITED STATES. 
The transcendental-phenomenological reduction is 
the final justification for the phenomenology of logic, 
but phenomenology of logic can be developed without 
giving a final justification at the outset. It is, however, 
immediately connected with the justification through 
the EIDETIC METHOD. The following steps can be distin-
guished. 
( 1) Intentiona! objects, in the terminology of the 
Cartesianische Mediationen, are either immanent, 
mental objects or they are transcendent objects. Imma-
nent objects can be identified as phases in the identity 
of the temporal unity of lived experience. Real tran-
scendent objects do not belong to the mental unity of 
consciousness. They can be given as the same in differ-
ent phases of conscious life. The identity of real tran-
scendent objects is inseparable from the matter (hyle) 
of perception. Ideal objects, e.g., a right triangle, are 
ideal because they are given as the same in different 
matter, e.g., black lines on white paper, or white lines 
on a green blackboard. They are nevertheless also tran-
scendent because they are given as the same in different 
phases of conscious life. 
(2) Setting aside some cultural objects, concepts, 
i.e., universal concepts (Allgemeinheiten in the termi-
nology of Elfahrung und Urteil), are recognized as 
ideal objects in the tradition. Phenomenological anal-
ysis can distinguish different types ofuniversals. Uni-
versals are either empirica! or pure. The pure universals 
are the ei de. The following distinctions belong to both 
types of universals: concrete universals refer to many 
things of the same kind than can subsist for them-
selves or to pieces of such things. Abstract universals 
refer to abstract moments that can only subsist together 
with other abstract moments in concrete objects, e.g., 
colors and shapes. Abstract moments are first given 
as themselves as singularities, e.g., a specific shade 
of red. They are nevertheless universals because they 
can be given as the same in different concrete things, 
e.g., the same shade of red in a car and in a bicycle. 
The givenness of abstract moments requires a specific 
abstraction or universalization. Abstraction in general 
presupposes acts of variation. To have a concept of 
a specific shade of red implies the consciousness of 
its possible givenness in varying contexts. The type 
of abstraction leading to abstract moments must be 
distinguished from generalizing abstraction leading to 
universals of higher order. Universals of higher order 
are either universals of higher order for lower univer-
sals of concrete things or for abstract moments, like 
"red in general" for different shades ofred and "color" 
for different colors. Generalizing abstraction requires 
the variation ofthe contents oflower order universals. 
What is in common and what is different in concepts 
can only be given in such variations. Considerations on 
this level are sufficient for the development of a tradi-
tional apophantic logic. But it is not possible to decide 
with their aid whether logica! concepts are pure, i.e., 
a priori, or empirica!, or whether they are material or 
formal. 
(3) Acts of abstraction require variation and vari-
ations are acts of IMAGINATION. A universal will be 
empirica! if the domain of variation is determined by 
pregiven experience. The givenness of a pure univer-
sal or eidos a priori requires, first of ali, the eidetic 
reduction. This reduction suspends acceptance of the 
real existence of an object and considers only the pure 
whatness. The other requirement is eidetic intuition. 
Eidetic intuition recognizes what is common and what 
is different in free variations, i.e., variations not bound 
to actual experience. "Free variation" is not arbitrary 
variation. It requires certain rules and viewpoints. 
(4) ldeen 1 distinguishes formal eide, belonging to 
apophantic logic and formal ontology, and material 
eide. It furthermore distinguishes exact material eide 
and morphological material eide. Many philosophers 
will admit that logica! forms are in some sense a priori. 
Some recognize the a priori character of exact material 
eide, e.g., of the eide of geometry. Many will deny 
that material morphological concepts can be a priori 
concepts. It may seem impossible to determine rules 
for "free variation." 
A solution can only be found in the further devel-
opment of the phenomenology of logic. The rules for 
free variation in formal apophantics are the rules offor-
malizing abstraction. Formalizing abstraction involves 
keeping unchanged some abstract component of sig-
nification or MEANING corresponding to a syncategore-
matic expression and varying other categorematic parts 
of the meaning. The "and so on" of variation can be 
indicated by variables for categorematic meaning that 
can satisfy the syncategorematic expression. Thus in 
compoundjudgments one can distinguish the sentence 

LOGIC 
connectives, e.g., "and" or "or," as syncategorematic 
parts and the judgments connected by them as cate-
gorematic parts, presented in formalizing abstraction 
as variables. Within one judgment we can distinguish 
the predicates as categorematic parts and the predicate 
connectives, including the copula, as syncategorematic 
parts of the expression. The syntcategorematic parts 
represent the categorica! form; the types of categore-
matic parts belonging to such a categorica! form are 
called categorica! matter. 
The Logische Untersuchungen introduce such 
considerations in the Sixth Investigation. Husserl 
points out that this analysis presupposes the formal-
ontologica! investigations of whole and part in the 
Third Investigation. The introduction to the second 
edition of the Logische Untersuchungen (1913) em-
phasizes that this investigation is essential for the de-
velopment of phenomenological method in general. 
According to ldeen 1 the rule guiding the variations 
leading to exact material ei de is the idea of an "and so 
on" in a well-ordered series leading to an ideal limit: 
a straight line is the shortest connection between two 
points. But such an idea receives its precise formu-
lation again in formal ontology and this idea can be 
applied only to abstract material moments ofthe genus 
extension, i.e., first of ali, SPACE and TIME. The rules for 
the variation leading to morphological material eide 
already surface in the Third Investigation. The basic 
rule is that abstraction has to isolate abstract moments 
connected by foundation relations ~ e.g., visual ex-
tension and visual quality ~ 
to keep one unchanged 
and to vary the other. This leads to the discovery of 
the laws offoundation between abstract moments. The 
first concrete eide that can be reached are the universal 
structures ofthe different regions of material ontology. 
Empirically general concepts are the result of varying 
the content of particular concepts. Morphological eide 
are given immediately in the highest degree ofuniver-
sality. 
The descriptions in the Logische Untersuchungen 
comprise a movement in a zigzag pattern focusing first 
on o ne aspect of the state of affairs, then the other, and 
then returning to the first again. The purpose of the 
zigzag is to clarify the methodical presuppositions of 
the first description with the aid ofthe second. Husserl 
begins with simple material descriptions of phenomena 
ofvisual perception. Reftections on the basic structures 
423 
ofthe phenomena that include formalizing abstraction 
discover that they entail structures not bound to the 
material. They remain the same in varying material 
structures and, therefore, belong to formal ontology. 
As such they can be applied to the realm of meaning 
and provide the rules for the variations necessary for 
the discovery of apophantic categories. Formal onto-
logica! structures can also be used as guidelines for the 
eidetic intuition of material eide, first of ali the ma-
terial eide governing the most universal structures of 
material ontology. The generalizing abstraction leading 
to universal empirica! concepts varies particulars that 
are pregiven in experience. Eidetic intuition, following 
the rules for varying that are pregiven by the formal-
ontologica! theory ofwhole and parts, reaches the first 
concrete wholes on the level ofhighest universality. 
The approach ofthe first four investigations is, in the 
terminology of ldeen !, directed at the NOEMA. They do 
not explain the nature ofthe priority offormal ontology 
for logica! theory and they do not explain why there 
ought to be a strict correspondence between the formal 
a priori of formal ontology and the formal a priori 
of apophantic logic. The static noetic analyses of the 
last two investigations do not solve these problems 
completely. After Formale und Transzendentale Logik, 
Husserl 's phenomenology of logic also includes the 
GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY of the noesis in Er(ahrung 
und Urteil and in Analysen zur passiven Synthesis, 
which contain lectures on the basic problems of logic 
and transcendental logic. These texts also provide some 
further information about the logic oftruth. 
The first prefigurations of logica! categorica! forms 
can be found in the forms of the structure of passive 
associative synthesis in pure perception. There are, on 
the one hand, the associative structures of coexisting 
content in the hyletic field: contrast and fusion of qual-
ities, units of contents in the foreground of a perhaps 
changing background, and configurations of such units 
in a common background. On the other hand, there are 
the materially determined temporal structures of pas-
si ve synthesis: disappointed and fulfilled contents of 
protention, the disjunctive split in modalized proten-
tions after disappointment, and the open possibility of 
protentions without associatively determined content. 
The givenness of categorically articulated objects 
requires active syntactic synthesis. Active synthesis on 
the pre-predicative level is a synthesis in intentiona! 

424 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
acts of imagination. It implies active attention. The 
attention is divided, i.e., it is directed to a concrete 
content on a background and, in addition, it is directed 
toward the interna] properties of the content and its 
relations to other units of content in the hyletic field. 
It has the character of a pre-predicative judgmental 
activity. The divided attention is unified in the tempo-
ral horizon of presently given and explicitly expected 
contents. The structures given in such syntactical syn-
theses are the structures of fulfilled and disappointed 
explicit expectations, modalized and disjunctively di-
vided expectations, and empty expectations of open 
possibilities. Split attention is also given in the recog-
nition of objects as similar or equal with other objects 
given in other temporal phases of experience. The dif-
ferent aspects ofthe structures ofpassive synthesis are 
given in the articulation of active synthesis as different 
and taken together in the unity of o ne intentiona! object. 
The intentiona! object is the categorically articulated 
object of PERCEPTION. Categorica! form as such cannot 
be grasped on the level ofpre-predicative experience. 
Predicative synthesis presupposes LANGUAGE and IN-
TERSUB.JECTIVITY. lntersubjectivity and pre-predicative 
interaction are pregiven in passive synthesis in the as-
sociative appresentation of the other as another living 
BODY. Intersubjectivity and language are necessarily 
implied in the givenness of objects in the proper sense, 
i.e., possible objects ofinteraction and communication. 
The communicative function of language is, however, 
not relevant for analysis of logica! form and its gene-
sis. Predication requires signs with a sign matter dis-
tinguished from the matter ofthe objects signified. The 
immediate intentiona! object ofpredication is the state 
ofaffairs meant. The state ofaffairs given in perception 
is bodily there, present in o ne of its aspects. It is absent 
in the meant state of affairs. The forms of categorica! 
articulation in a meant state of affairs are counterparts 
of the forms of categorica! articulations in the given 
state of affairs. The reference of linguistic expressions 
to states of affairs is possible because the system of 
categorica[ forms of meaning and those of being cor-
respond to each other and are represented, though in 
often ambiguous ways, in the gram mar of natural lan-
guage. The categorica! articulation of the meant state 
of affairs has its own ideal li mit in adequate evidence, 
which can be attained in clear and distinct judgmen-
tal articulation. Adequate predicative evidence does 
not imply the adequate evidence of categorica! artic-
ulation of objects given in immediate pre-predicative 
experience. Pre-predicative experience is modalized. 
Predica ti ve meaning referring to objects ofthis experi-
ence is, therefore, modalized as well. Truth and falsity 
are left as two possible mutually exclusive moda! val-
ues only in case of adequate predicative and adequate 
pre-predicative evidence. 
Predicative categorica! articulation refers to the 
state of affairs meant and not to categorica! forms as 
such.lt is the first presupposition for a possible formal-
izing abstraction and categorica[ intuition in which cat-
egorica[ form as such is thematic. The second presup-
position, following the hints of "Die Frage nach dem 
Ursprung der Geometrie als intentional-historisches 
Problem" ( 1939), is that oral discourse is given as writ-
ten discourse. Formalizing abstraction in traditional 
apophantics begins with the analysis of the grammat-
ical structure of a natural language, but it is not re-
stricted to it. Equivocations in grammatical structures 
of language can be discovered by comparing the cate-
gorica] articulation of the pregiven language with the 
categorica! articulation of the state of affairs meant 
and the categorica! articulation ofthe state of affairs as 
such. Formalizing abstraction must also from the out-
set include formal-ontologica] considerations. Already 
the first steps in the logica! regimentation of gram mar 
lead to the discovery ofthe formal eidetic impossibility 
ofunified meaning in certain categorica! articulations. 
They are impossible because they are contradictory. 
The distinction between contradictory and non-
contradictory judgmental structures leads to the devel-
opment of the logic of consequence and finally to the 
formal-ontologica! deductive systems of pure MATH-
EMATICS. They require the elimination of ambiguities 
with the aid ofthe construction offormalized languages 
in which the categorica! intuition oflogical categorica! 
form can be represented adequately. The development 
of categorica! intuition and formalizing abstraction pre-
supposes from the beginning the correlation oflogic as 
formal apophantics and logic as formal ontology. What 
is missing in Husserl 's ace o unt is a phenomenological 
analysis of the logic of truth in his phenomenology of 
REASON and his idea of a mathesis of possible truth. 
This is a task for further phenomenological research. 
Husserl 's approach in the phenomenology of logic 
is opposed to the Kantian approach. KANT separated

the categorica! forms of the understanding and intu-
ition. Thc schematism, presupposing a transcenden-
tal deduction, links both. The schematism of imagina-
tion has priority, according to the phenomenology of 
logic. What follows is the activity of syntactical pre-
predicative and predicative synthesis as the condition 
ofthe givenness ofthe ideal objects in formalizing ab-
straction and categorica! intuition. The objects of for-
mal eidetic intuition are not FREGE's Platonic entities. 
They are the necessary correlates of a consciousness 
under the tel os of reason.

Also known as "logi-

to the work of a single philosopher as to a unified 
set of doctrines articulated, shared, and developed by 
an international association of philosophers and sci-
entists in the 1920s and 1930s. The inception of logi-
ca! positivism as a philosophical movement, however, 
is closely tied to the person and work of the Ger-
man philosopher Moritz Schlick ( 1882-1936). Schlick 
came to the University of Vienna in 1922, at the be-

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
philosophy ofthe inductive sciences. In many ways his 
presence was but a continuation of a well-entrenched 
Viennese empiricist tradition. Having written his dis-
sertation in physics under Max Planck ( 1858~1947), 
he maintained that our knowledge of the world is to 
be drawn exclusively from the empirica! sciences, and 
that the primary task of philosophy is to provide a 
comprehensive theory of scientific knowledge. In re-
action to the speculative excesses of German idealism, 
Schlick insisted that philosophy has no special access 
to a reality over and above the reality addressed by the 
NATURAL SCIENCES. PhiJosophy is to clarify the mean-
ing and logic of scientific statements, not to produce a 
stock of its own. 
A forceful personality with a talent for provoca-
tive presentation, Schlick gathered around himself 
the group of scientists, mathematicians, and philoso-
phers that !ater became known as the "Vienna Cir-
ele." This circle included among others, Herbert Feigl 
( 1902~ 1988), Otto Neurath ( 1882~1945), Rudolf Car-
nap (1891~1970), and Kurt Godel (1906-1978). In 
1929 it published its manifesta -
"The Vienna Cir-
ele, Its Scientific Conception of the World" -
and 
held its first annual international congress in Prague, 
jointly sponsored by the Society for Empirica! Philos-
ophy in Berlin led by Hans Reichenbach (1891~1953) 
and Cari Hempel. In 1930 it took over the journal enti-
tled Annalen der Philosophie, renaming it Erkenntnis. 
Edited by Carnap and Reichenbach and published con-
tinuously until 1940, this periodica! became the chief 
literary outlet of the logica] positivist movement. In 
the course ofthe 1930s this movement achieved inter-
national scope, gaining adherents in POLAND, SCANDI-
NAVIA, THE NETHERLANDS, GREAT BRITAIN, and the UNITED 
STATES. Meetings ofthe Vienna Ci rele were attended by 
the American philosopher W. V Quine and the British 
philosopher A. J. Ayer, who !ater popularized the doc-
trines of logica! empiricism in the English-speaking 
world with the publication of Language, Truth, and 
Logic in 1936. Although LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN and Karl 
Popper were not members of the Vienna Circ le, they 
were in regular contact with it. Wittgenstein's Tracta-
tus Logico-Philosophicus ( 1921) had a profound influ-
ence on the logica! positivist theory ofmeaning (a the-
ory that Wittgenstein himself disowned), and Popper's 
Logik der Forschung (The logic of scientific discov-
ery) was originally published in 1935 as part of a series 
of monographs sponsored by the Vienna Ci rele. 
By the end of the 1930s, logica! positivism, as a 
movement, had lost much ofits social cohesion. Many 
members of the Vienna Ci rele and the Berlin Society 
had fled to diverse institutions in America in the face 
ofthe growing Nazi menace; Schlick had been shot to 
death by an irate student. By the 1950s it had lost much 
of its philosophical credibility as well, having been 
subjected to searching and detailed criticism, often by 
its own adherents. 
The ma in doctrines of logica! positivism can be or-
ganized around its central tenet: the principle ofverifi-
ability. Simply put, this principle states that only those 
statements that can be verified on the hasis of sense ex-
perience are meaningful. It is important to emphasize 
that this principle functioned for the positivists not as 
a criterion of TRUTH, but as a criterion of MEANING: it 
was not designed to expose ali statements that cannot 
be verified on the hasis of sense experience as false; 
rather, it was intended to show that they are mean-
ingless -
and hence can be neither true nor false. 
According to a phrase that became a slogan for the 
movement, "The meaning of a statement is the method 
of its verification." If a statement cannot be verified 
by an appeal to sense experience, then it simply has 
no meaning. Or so the logica! positivists declared. For 
this reason they did not claim to have solved the tra-
ditional roster of metaphysical problems, such as the 
immortality ofthe soul or the freedom ofthe will. They 
simply dismissed them as pseudoproblems. Claims of 
RELIGION and even judgments in ETHICS and AESTHET-
ICS were also excluded from the domain ofmeaningful 
discourse. Only the claims ofthe sciences, both formal 
and empirica!, remained. 
In this move the logica! empiricists made a con-
scious appeal to the philosophy of the BRITISH EMPIRI-
CIST David Hume. Hume divided the objects of ali our 
knowledge into "relations of ideas" and "matters of 
fact." The former are expressed in the propositions 
belonging to the formal sciences of LOGIC and MATH-
EMATICS, which are true only because they are, ulti-
mately, tautological; the latter are the proper objects 
of claims whose truth is decidable on the hasis of 
sense experience. AII other knowledge claims, Hume 
insisted, should be discarded. In a famous passage at the 
end ofhis Enqui1y Concern ing Human Understanding 
( 1748), he suggests that we run through the libraries 

LOGICAL POSITIVISM 
427 
of the world and, taking into our hand any volume 
of religion or school metaphysics, ask ourselves the 
following questions: Does this volume contain any ab-
stract reasoning concerning quantity or number? Does 
it contain any reasoning based on experience concern-
ing matters of fact? If the answer to both of these 
questions is "no," then we must consign the book to 
the flames, "for it can contain nothing but sophistry 
and illusion." 
The doctrina! development of logica! empiricism 
can be traced in successive attempts to offer a plausi-
ble philosophical explication of the principle of veri-
fiability. On the one hand, the logica! positivists owed 
the world an account ofthe logic of"verification," and 
on the other, an account of the sta tus of the "veri fier." 
Substantial difficulties, however, were encountered on 
both fronts. In the attempt to state the necessary and 
sufficient conditions for verification, the basic problem 
was to exclude metaphysics without excluding a good 
deal of science, and to retain science without retain-
ing a good deal of metaphysics. The "strong version" 
of the principle of verifiability, promoted by Schlick, 
erred in the former respect. According to this vers ion, a 
statement can be verified ifand only ifit can be directly 
and conclusively established through sense experience. 
Clearly this version would exclude ali statements of 
general law in science as meaningless, for a general 
claim can never be completely verified through a finite 
series of sense experiences. We might claim, for in-
stance, that free-falling bodies accelerate at the rate of 
9.8 meters per second squared. And we might con duct a 
few experiments to see ifthis is true. Or we might con-
duct many experiments to see if it is true. But as Hume 
pointed out, no matter how many experiments we con-
duct, it is always possible that future experience will 
provide the exception. Since science is largely made 
up of just such law-like statements, the strong version 
ofthe verifiability principle is too strong. It excludes a 
good deal of science. 
However, the "weak version," espoused by Neu-
rath and the !ater Carnap, turned out to be too weak, 
erring in the opposite direction. According to it, a state-
ment is verifiable if and only if it can in principle be 
directly verified on the basis of sense experience or 
confirmed through indirect methods of empirica! test-
ing. General statements oflaw, then, could be admitted 
into the circ le of meaningful discourse as empirically 
testable hypotheses. Although they cannot be directly 
and conclusively verified through sense experience, 
they can, when joined with suitable hypotheses, find 
confirmation through experimental procedures. When 
their observable implications, under given hypotheses, 
match the yield of sense experience, their probability 
is rai sed. This version, however, is too weak, allowing 
metaphysical statements to creep in as antecedents of 
conditiona! claims with testable consequents. 
Consider the following claim: "If the Absolute is 
tired today, then l weigh 185 pounds." If 1 affirm the 
antecedent of this conditiona!, I can derive an empiri-
cally testable statement, the one concern ing my weight. 
My weight can be verified on the scale, hence the 
claim "The Absolute is tired today" is, on this ver-
sion, meaningful, for when joined to the hypotheses 
represented by the conditiona! statement, it yields an 
empirically testable consequence. lf we seek to fore-
stall this problem by disallowing any non-empirica! 
conditiona! claims in the premises, we are sti li not out 
of the woods. For any metaphysical statement can be 
conjoined to any empirically testable statement, thus 
forming a conjunction that is itself empirically testable 
by virtue of the logica! operation of simplification, as 
the American logician Alonzo Church pointed out. So 
the statement, "The Absolute is tired today and I weigh 
185 pounds" turns out to be meaningful on the weak 
version of the principle of verifiability. 
Similar problems were encountered in attempts to 
give an account of the "verifiers." Thus far vague ap-
peals to "sense experience" have been made. But what 
is it, exactly, in sense experience that verifies a state-
ment? In an attempt to maximize the degree of certainty 
at the foundation of scientific knowledge, some held 
that the verifying statements must be restricted to in-
trospective reports on current sense data (e.g., "This 
patch ofblue here, now"). But it would seem that such 
reports on particular episodes of private experience 
are too slender a basis to support the entire edifice of 
scientific knowledge concerning the objective world. 
They may ha ve the epistemic virtue ofbeing certain, of 
representing, as Schlick put it, "unshakable points of 
contact between knowledge and reality," but they are 
not objective in the sense ofbeing intersubjectively ac-
cessible. On the other hand, to employ the language of 
physical objects in issuing verifying statements would 
represent a gain in objectivity, but only at the expense 

428 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
of rendering them irreducibly hypothetical in charac-
ter. For any claim about physical objects exceeds what 
is actually given in sense experience. Ifl claim, on the 
basis of present perception, that there is a chair be-
fore me, I do so with reference to an ostensible chair 
sense datum given in that perception. That statement 
may turn out to be false, on subsequent experience, 
were the chair sense datum not followed by a typi-
cally coherent series of chair sense data. To pasit a 
physical abject, or to state a fact about one, is to utter 
a statement that has an infinite number of particular 
experiential implications, but only a finite number of 
them can be realized in my experience. This, how-
ever, entails a view of verification that was far less 
exciting than what the principle ofverification initially 
promised. For the original idea was to test scientific 
hypotheses against conclusively established empirica! 
fact, not against another hypothesis. 
Problems in specifying a plausible version of the 
principle of verifiability were indeed substantial, but 
philosophical unhappiness with it came to a head when 
it was applied to itself. Is the principle of verifiability 
meaningful by its own standard? Consider the state-
ment, "A statement is meaningful if and only if it can 
be verified on the hasis of sense experience." Can such 
a statement itself be verified on the basis of sense ex-
perience? It is difficult to see how it could. ls it, then, a 
formal truth, a tautology, acceptable for the same rea-
sons that the statement "A is not non-A" is acceptable? 
It would appear not- for it seems to say something 
new, interesting, and informative about what it is for 
a statement to be meaningful. lf, on the other hand, 
it is merely a stipulative definition, then it is hard to 
see why it is especially binding- others are free to 
stipula te other definitions ofmeaningful statements for 
other theoretical purposes. ls it, perchance, a disguised 
recommendation- something like the following: ac-
cept only those statements as meaningful that can be 
verified the basis of experience? Then it must be con-
strued as a wish that the logica! empiricists had for 
the world. But again it is difficult to know why those 
antecedently convinced otherwise should welcome it. 
Despite these and other difficulties, EDMUND HUSSERL 
found himself in complete agreement with the posi-
tivists on one major point: their rejection of philosophy 
as speculative system building. Both Husserl and the 
positivists demanded that philosophical work be tied to 
what is actually experienced. In fact, in ldeen zu einer 
reinen Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen 
Philosophie 1 ( 1913), he claimed that if "positivism" 
means the unprejudiced grounding of ali sciences on 
the "positive," that is, on what can be grasped in di-
rect experience, then "we are the genuine positivists." 
But Husserl quickly parted ways with the positivists, 
principally on two issues: the range of experience 
available to philosophy and the kind of experience 
required by philosophy. In "Philosophie als strenge 
Wissenschaft" ( 1911) he characterizes positivism in 
general as a species of "NATURALISM"- the tendency 
to reduce ali spheres of being to nature as conceived 
by the natural sciences. Husserl held that there are in 
fact three ontologically distinct spheres of being -
nature, consciousness, and ideas- and that the natu-
ralization of consciousness and ideas would invariably 
lead to RELATIVISM and make it impossible for philoso-
phy to fu! fiii its proper task. The positivistic restriction 
of experience to what is actual in sense perception 
means that science and philosophy can only articulate 
what happens to be the case, not what must be the 
case. But, he maintained, above the actuallies the do-
main of the necessary and the possible- the realm of 
pure ideas. From insight into this realm the philoso-
pher can derive necessary synthetic principles of strict 
universal validity. From the pure idea of TRUTH, for 
instance, the philosopher can derive a body of prin-
ciples regarding the conditions that must be met by 
any true proposiiion. Husserl was convinced that the 
procedure for deriving a body of such principles is not 
analytic, as if ali necessary truths were mere tautolo-
gies, nor speculative, leading to philosophical systems 
based on ultimately arbitrary definitions, but rather ex-
periential, for he thought, unlike the positivists, that 
it was possible to experience -
to intuit -
neces-
sary states of affairs and therefore rigorously confirm 
necessary truth claims. Such forms of intuition- the 
"intuition of essence" generated by the EIDETIC METHOD 
-
would serve as the source of well-grounded philo-
sophical statements regarding the necessary principles 
ofthought, VALUE, and ACTION. 
To deny that experience reaches to the realm ofthe 
necessary is to deny philosophy the possibility of ar-
ticulating the conditions of its own validity as a body 
of truth claims, thus leading, upon reflection, to skep-
ticism. Moreover, to restrict the range of experience to 

LOGICAL POSITIVISM 
429 
the actual is to convert ali questions of absolute norma-
tivity to questions of mere fact, thus making it impos-
sible for reason to pronounce in a universally binding 
way on the unavoidable human questions of ultimate 
truth, value, meaning, purpose, and the like. In this way 
-as Husserl put it in Die Krisis dereuropăischen Wis-
senschaften und die transzendenta!e Phănomenologie 
( 1936)- positivism "decapitates philosophy." Under 
the constraints of positivism, neithcr science nor phi-
losophy could play a normative role in the formation 
of human cui ture; moreover, the great Enlightenment 
ideal of human life guided by REASON alone, to which 
Husserl wholeheartedly subscribed, could not even be 
approached. 
Like the naturalization of ideas, the naturalization 
of consciousness also leads to an epistemological im-
passe. The basic question of epistemology, according 
to Husserl, is whether and how consciousness makes 
contact with reality. It is not possible to give a non-
question-begging answer to this qucstion on the hasis 
of empirica! scientific research, as the positivists advo-
cated. Ali of the sciences, Husserl maintains, operate 
within the "natural attitude": they accept and take as 
their point of departure the givenness of the world in 
experience. Conflicts in scientific claims regarding the 
specific disposition of the world are to be adjudicated 
primarily by appcals to experience. But philosophy 
proposes to question experience itself; it wants to ask 
whether and how consciousness is in touch with the 
world in the first place. Any attempt to answer this 
question on the hasis of empirica! scientific investiga-
tion necessarily begs the question, for empirica! sci-
entific investigation assumes the very connection with 
the world that philosophy wants to make problematic. 
Therefore, if the specific level of the philosophical 
problem of knowledge is to be recognized and hon-
ored, philosophy must make use ofnovel methods and 
a novel form of experience. 
To investigate the relationship between conscious-
ness and reality, the philosopher cannot simply take 
leave of the standpoint of consciousness and look at 
reality in order to see if it really is the way it ap-
pears to be within consciousness, for any access to 
reality is necessarily mediated by consciousness. The 
only viable approach to this philosophical problem, 
Husserl insists, is to reflect upon one's own conscious-
ness, then to investigate and faithfully to describe the 
way in which consciousness relates itself to reality (a 
theory of INTENTIONALITY) and the way in which con-
scious experience serves as a source ofjustification for 
beliefs about reality (a theory of rationality). Setting 
aside the natural belief in the existence of the world 
in what Husserl called the "transcendental EPOCHE AND 
REDUCTION," the philosopher must attend solely to the 
experience of the world within the domain of pure 
consciousness and its unique mode of being. Unlike 
the worldly items that appear within it, expericnce is 
itself an unending flux of acts and appearances tied 
together by specific relations within immanent TIME. 
The philosopher- now a practicing phenomenologist 
-must investigate how such acts and appearances are 
temporally structured so as to present -
or represent 
-objects, as well as how they are related to each other 
so as to provide a hasis for justified belief concern ing 
those objects. By instituting the "transcendental reduc-
tion" the philosopher creates for him- or herself the 
kind of experience that is required if the central ques-
tions of epistemology are to be solved through care fui 
and detailed research. And such fundamental research 
will in turn serve as a hasis for the phenomenological 
clarification ofthe knowledge claims advanced by the 
empirica! sciences within the natural attitude.

IMI 
GABRIEL MARCEL 
The son of a former 
Ministre Plenipotentiaire to Sweden and Directeur des 
Beaux Arts at the Bibliotheque Nationale and other na-
tional museums, Marcel ( 1889-1973)attended the Sor-
bonne and had as his teachers Andre Lalande ( 1867-
1964 ), HENRI BERGSON, and Victor De\bos ( 1864--1916). 
He took the agn?gation in philosophy, along with JEAN 
WAHL, who was in his class. Marcel held teaching po-
sitions in various lycees until 1940, when he decided 
to make his living entirely from his work as music 
and drama critic for severa\ literary reviews and as 
a consultant to severa! publishers. In addition to his 
many philosophical works, Marcel wrote music and 
over a dozen plays. He was awarded membership in 
the Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, and 
delivered, in 1949-50, the Gifford Lectures, and in 
1961, the William James Lectures at Harvard Univer-
sity.With his Journal nu!taphysique (1927), Gabriel 
Marcel began to publish the personal reflections in 
diary form that he had begun in 1914, and Etre et 
avoir (1935) continues this. In a note dated October 
13, 1933, Marcel remarks that a "phenomenology of 
having" would serve well his purpose of a renewed 
reflection on the question of Being. That Novem-
ber he presented his famous lecture "Outlines of a 
phenomenology of having" to the Lyons Philosophi-
cal Society. Despite the use of "phenomenology" in 
the title of this address, and severa! other places in 
which Marcel apparently identifies his work as being 
within the phenomenological tradition, one must note 
HERBERT SPIEGELBERG's judgment that there is no ev-
idence that Husserl had any significant influence on 
his understanding of phenomenology. Marcel admit-
ted that he read ldeen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie 
und phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 (1913) prior 
to World War I and attended Husserl's 1ectures at the 
Sorbonne, but indicated that he was not impressed. 
By Marcel 's own admission, his primary interest 
was in a renewed analysis of Being. His phenomen-
ological studies (of having, fidelity, hope, promising, 
etc.) would involve certain "concrete approaches" to 
ontology. To Marcel a "phenomenological analysis" 
means an analysis of the content of thought as such, 
an analysis that prescinds from factual, psychological 
states. His phenomenology is a search for the "mean-
ing" intrinsic to a certa in type of experience as opposed 
to a reduction of experience to empirica! conditions. In 
the estimation of his pupi! PAUL RICCEUR, Marcel used 
EIDETIC METHOD carefully to explore examples primar-
ily of personal experience to determine their essen-
tial meanings: "hoping in" as distinct from "hoping 
for," having-as-possession as distinct from having-as-
implication, etc. 
The ontology served by Marcel 's phenomenologi-
cal studies had much in common with that of MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER (although Marcel did not encounter Heideg-
ger's works until his own thought had already taken 
shape) insofar as both launched a critique of "episte-
mological" thinking and foundations in the "cogito." In 
his article (which has the force of a true, original mani-
festo) of 1925, "Existence et objectivite," he speaks of 
exploring the "limits of objectivity," and ofthe attempt 
to reach a ground that transcends the classical subject-
object relationship. Without having studied Heidegger, 
and unbeknownst to himself, Marcel's early writings 
parallel Heidegger's contemporaneous critique of the 
founder of phenomenology. 
The publication of the Journal metaphysique 
marked Marcel's conscious break with his earli-
est philosophical influences, idealism in its German 
(scHELLING) and British (Bradley) varieties. His de-
cision to publish his thoughts in their original, diary 
form signaled the rea1ization by Marcel ofthe finitude 
of human thinking, of the circumscription of thought 
by time and place that he would come to characterize 
throughout his works as "situatedness." In the Jour-
nal metaphysique and in "Existence et objectivite," he 
explores what he referred to as the "irreducible" and 
"uncharacterizable" dimensions of experience, dimen-
sions against which it is impossible to set ourselves 
in the position of onlookers, and thus dimensions it 
would be impossible to doubt. "Existence" itself is pro-
claimed the basic irreducible, although what he means 
by existence is tied directly to what he calls "sensu-
ous presence." Sensuous experience of existence is a 
matter of "feeling" rather than of thought and does

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
not, Marcel insists, possess the subject-object struc-
ture of cognitive, intellectual experience. Feei ing of-
fers an "assurance" that is not that of"certitude." Feei-
ing is something primordial and to try to translate it 
into other, logical, categories and to impose foreign 
criteria of validation is to betray the primordial sense 
of feei ing, which bel ies the subject-object distinction. 
Feeling, sensation, is "immediate participation" of a 
subject in its world, a relation in which the subject is 
not in a confrontational relationship to an object. 
It is in the Journal metaphysique that Marcel first 
raises the centrality of embodiment. Not only is the 
BODY one's enrootedness and emplacement in exis-
tence, but embodiment shows the irreducibil ity of ex-
istence to objectivity. While ali instances of "having" 
implicate one's body, Marcel contends that one does 
not have one's body, since the EGO who supposedly 
"has" the body would be bodiless, with ali of the ab-
surdities of Carstesian dualism ensuing. The sense of 
"my body," which characterizes participant experience 
of embodiment, belies dualism and finds expression 
in "1 am my body." Marcel 's groundbreaking work on 
embodiment stands as one of his most important in-
ftuences on subsequent EXISTENTIAL PHFNOMENOLOGY, 
especially that of MAURICE MFRLEAU-PONTY. 
With the publication in 1933 of his essay "Posi-
tions et approches concretes du mystere ontologique," 
Marcel's discourse turned distinctively to the question 
of Being. His former preoccupation with existence as 
sensuous irreduciblity to objectivity and as primordial 
participation is subsumed into a more comprehensive, 
and social, framework. "Being" retains the irreducibil-
ity of existence so that he says that his inquiry into Be-
ing presupposes an affirmation with respect to which 
one is, in a sense, passive, and of which one is the 
"stage" rather than the subject. The subject cannot 
objectify the ontologica] participation constitutive of 
itself. At this time Marcel clearly sees the difficulty 
besetting his claims about irreducibility. What is the 
relation ofthought to immediate participation? Marcel 
had claimed in hisJournal metaphysiquethat existence 
cannot be characterized. Yet clearly he does not mean 
to say that what is not objectifiable in the strict sense 
is thereby unknowable. In "Positions et approches ... ," 
Marcel introduces his distinction between problem and 
metaproblem (mystery). 
A problem finds its intelligibility in itself, in front of 
one, exemplifying the modern notion of the unbiased 
and distanced investigator. According to the episte-
mology of modernity, the investigator can and must, 
in order to gain "objectivity," separate his or her per-
sonality, politica] views, emotions, etc., from his or her 
"scientific" identity. In the properly ontologica! realm, 
for Marcel, this is a distortive methodology. In the 
ontologica] realm a "problem," such as embodiment, 
involves the investiga tor. Only a being who has partici-
pant experience of embodiment can, for Marcel, reveal 
what it is like tobe such a being (to grasp the cssence 
of embodiment). A truly "neutra]" investigator of em-
bodiment, one totally frec of prejudice, would be an 
unembodied being. 
Such an unembodied investigator would be com-
pelled to study embodied beings from without and 
could only note certain common externa! character-
istics of their behavior. But for Marcel, echoed more 
recently by Thomas Nagel, such an investigation would 
completely miss the participant sense of embodiment 
characterized by the enunciation "1 am my body." A 
metaproblem (mystery), then, is intelligible, but re-
veals its intelligiblity in participant experience. One 
cannot extract oneself from such experience without 
losing intelligibility. Being, of course, is the most fun-
damental ofmetaproblems for Marcel. One cannot step 
out of Being and assume some sort of externa! per-
spective upon it (hence one is the "stage" in this regard 
rather than the "spectator"). Marcel is convinced that 
one cannot credibly hold to the "fiction" of a transcen-
dental EGO, for this would commit o ne precisely to such 
a vicious abstraction. 
At the same time Marcel realizes that he is ap-
parently driven toward a contradiction, for would not 
any thinking (including his own) necessarily objectify 
what he has claimed is unobjectifiable? In response, he 
offers, parallel to the problem-metaproblem distinc-
tion, that ofprimary and secondary reftection. Primary 
reftection is objectifying and analytic, and character-
izes science and scientifically minded philosophy. Sec-
ondary reftection is "recuperative," repairing the dam-
age done to participation by primary reftection, and 
drawing out positively the "essences" of participant ex-
perience. Yet to recognize the insufficiency of primary 
reftection is, in some way, alreac~v to know existence 
or Being. Thus Marcel is led to posit an "intuition" 
within the immediacy of participation to ground both

of the essences of participatory experience. Secondary 
reflection is a recovery only by being grounded in a 
"blinded intuition" of participant experience. This in-
tuition is not self-conscious, and can know itself only 
in its various fonns of expression. It is in this vein that 
o ne must understand Marcel 's claim at the beginning 
of his Gifford Lectures, Le mystere de t•etre, that his 
reflections comprises a true Socratic "anamnesis," or 
recollection. 
In his !ater writings Marcel no longer found the 
word "intuition" acceptable and moved in the direc-
tion of an "indirect ontology," in which Being is not 
confronted, but always "vei led." In effect, this concern 
with an indirect approach led Marcel in the direction of 
hermeneutica! theory. This is clear in the chapter "My 
Life" in Le mystere de ll!tre, in which Marcel reiterates 
his critique of objectivity in light of his understand-
ing of situatedness. He refers to artistic judgments as 
paradigmatic. Artistic judgments are always subtended 
by unconsciously accepted general assumptions. The 
"historically conditioned attitude" in such matters is 
"inescapable," for judgments free ofthe local, the tem-
poral, the personal are impossible. 
Marcel applies this appreciation to self-understan-
ding. One cannot adopt a reflective position toward 
oneself free of situatedness. In reflection, a certain 
distance or withdrawal occurs, but one in which one 
never becomes the "pure epistemological subject." Onc 
always carries along one's life. Self-understanding is 
possible only in the form of a "story," a "narration." 
One shapes "episodes" into a meaningful framework, 
which, however, is a "construction" that cannot "repro-
duce" life as it is lived. Instead of a correspondence, 
narration makes "allusion" to a participant experience 
searching for a means of expression. The "allusion" is 
to life as participantly lived, and even though Marcel 
now emphasizes the fragility of intelligible construc-
tions, it is evident that he must retain his previous 
contention that there is, of necessity, some degree of 
consciousness on the level of participant experience. 
This makes possible expressions of a certain "ade-
quacy" regarding intelligible expressions of lived ex-
perience. One must, then, take into consideration the 
move toward an "indirect" ontology in assessing Mar-
cel 's notion of essence and his phenomenological stud-
ies. Ricocur has noted Marcel 's genuine eidetic abili-
ties, but it is clear that Marcel 's critique of reflection 
moves him in the direction of HANS-GEORG GADAMER 's 
"fusion of horizons," toward a communicative devel-
opment of universality. Philosophy is essentially dia-
logica!. 
Being is not understood by Marcel solely to 
be the ground of our existence. From the Journal 
metaphysique on, he spoke of Being as a "fullness" 
and of an "exigency" for Being on our part. This Au-
gustinian dimension runs consistently throughout his 
writings and forms the context for a number of his 
phenomenological studies (hope, despair), particularly 
those regarding intersubjective life (being-with, avail-
ability, fidelity). Here can be found his sharpest criti-
cism offorms of transcendental idealism. In dialogical 
life, in the encounter with the Thou, there is experi-
enced an "anti-Copernican" revolution, a decentering 
of self in fa vor of the "hold" of the Thou over us. Re-
spect for the Other is a condition of dialogue. Here 
COMMUNICATION and ETHICS arc inextricab]y linked. 
Dialogue requires recognition of the Other as a 
value, as a "presence," a singular existent, with a name 
and a face, irreducible to concept, abject, impersonal 
identity. In intersubjective relationships, Being reveals 
itself to have a "depth" dimension. Not only does 
Marcel, in his phenomeno]ogy of INTERSUBJECTIVITY, 
join with EMMANUEL LEVINAS in recognizing the ethical 
claim of the Other, "Thou shalt not kill," but Marcel's 
phenomenology of love insists that "Thou shalt not 
die." Of course, the intelligibility ofthe life of dialogue 
and intersubjective relations is essentially dramatic (he 
continually insists that his dramas are an integral part 
of his thought) and not systematic, involving freedom 
of response, fidelity or betrayal, hopefulness or despair. 
In such matters, Marcel insists in his !ater writings as 
in his first that commitment and witnessing are asked 
of us and that the cogito as "guardian of the threshold 
of validity" is out of place. 
Marcel 's critique ofprimary thinking and of"objec-
tivity" is not merely epistemological. He is convinced 
that the root of much contemporary malai se, socially 
and politically, is the insinuation of instrumental reason 
into human relationships, the unrestricted proliferation 
ofTECHNOLOGY, the prevalence of propaganda, of mass 
conformity. Indeed, his last writings show him as con-
vinced as ever that we are living in a "broken world," 
in which philosophy must return to its Socratic ro le of 

434 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
"awakener" to new possibilities ofhuman ftourishing. 
Both Herbert Spiegelberg and Paul Ricreur discern 
an authentic phenomenological mood or tone in Mar-
cel's writings. For Spiegelberg, Marcel's phenomen-
ological studies exhibit the very best marks of pheno-
menological analysis. For Ricreur, it is a similar en-
thusiasm for "research" and "concern for subtle dis-
tinctions." At the same time, both critics agree that 
Marcel clearly rejects the quest to make philosophy a 
rigorous science, the move to foundations in the cogito, 
and the transcendental EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION. Ricreur, 
who considers himself in many ways to be continu-
ing Marcel's work, has questioned the adequacy ofthe 
latter's theory ofreftection, "the status ofits own state-
ments." Marcel always insisted upon the integrity of 
philosophy and contended that its work was an intel-
lectual one, yet his own development ofwhat he meant 
by secondary reftection was tentative. Ricreur thinks 
that in reacting to tendencies in modern thought to-
ward a restrictive understanding ofreason, Marcel has 
separated primary and secondary reftection in an un-
helpful, non-dialectica! fashion, exposing his thought 
to a self-referential weakness. Ricreur's own preoccu-
pation with ITiethodology can be viewed as an attempt 
to address this difficulty. 
Toward the end ofhis career, Marcel became aware 
that STRUCTURALISM had entered the philosophical scene 
with a view "quite alien" to his. Given the upheaval in 
philosophy spurred by structuralism, and now seeing 
20th century philosophy from this si de ofthat upheaval, 
it can be said that, after ali, Marcel 's EXISTENTIAL PHENO-
MENOLOGY and the phenomenological movement itself 
have much more in common (subjectivity, conscious-
ness, intentionality, the relation between meaning and 
experience) than not.

MARXISM 
The relationship between pheno-
menology and Marxism has a long history, espe-
cially in Europe. The best summary of the more re-
cent encounter is to be found in the four volumes of 
papers stemming from meetings organized by ANTE 
PAZANIN, Jan M. Broekman, and BERNHARD WALDEN-
FELS, held in Dubrovnik from 1975 to 1978. Apart 
from this encounter, there are numerous philosoph-
ical trends that combine and employ both Marxism 
and phenomenology. The CRITICAL THEORY of Max 
Horkheimer ( 1895-1975), Theodor Adorno (1903-
1 969), and Ji.irgen Habermas is influenced by both 
trends. SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, and 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY in FRANCE were influenced 
by Alexandre Kojeve, Georg Lukacs ( 1885-1971 ), ED-
MUND HUSSERL, HEGEL, and Karl Marx as well as MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER. In ITALY, ENZO PAC! and the praxis theory 
of Antonio Gramsci are combined in a unified trend. 
Under the inftuence of ROMAN INGARDEN, Sartre, and 
partially Heidegger, philosophers in POLAND have re-
vitalized Marxian humanism. In CZECHOSLOVAKIA the 
Prague Linguistic Circle, through JAN PATOC'KA, had 
direct contact with Husserl; KAREL KosiK became a 
phenomenologically inspired Marxist. In HUNGARY the 
Budapest schooi, stemming from the work of Lukacs 
and actively carried on by Mihaiy Vajda, shows inti-
mate ties between the two trends. In YUGOSLAVIA the 
Praxis Group, including Gajo Petrovich and Mihailo 
Markovich, developed Marxism under the influence of 
Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty. In GER-
MANY, SUCh figures as LUDWIG LANDGREBE, KARL-HEINZ 
VOLKMANN-SCHLUCK, and EUGEN FINK have engaged in 
analyses to show the connections between Marxism 
and phenomenoiogy. Only thinkers who have made 
substantive connections between phenomenology and 
Marxism and whose work had a founding inftuence for 
these connections will be discussed here. 
The theme ofthe LIFEWORLD brings together a vari-
ety of concerns in both Marxism and phenomenology. 
For Husserl the lifeworld is a world of temporal open-
ness, for Sartre it is the locus of the possible vectors 
of choice and action, for Merleau-Ponty it is the phe-
nomenal field, and for Marx it is the domain of so-
cioeconomic struggles and critica! predictions of rev-
olution. In turn, both trends offer a human-centered 
universe, from which the human can be alienated in 
diverse ways. For phenomenology, both the objectiva-
tion and psychologization ofhuman awareness empties 
the world of MEANING, while for Marxism the objecti-
vation of human activity as pure labor power leads to 
alienation. Both converge in their critique of scientistic 
reification of the human as an alienating overlay upon 
the lifeworld. 
The lifeworld is equally a basis for overcoming 
dualisms, in particular the one between idealism and 
metaphysical materialism. Prior to dualism, there is a 
constant connection to the world: in the case of Marx-
ism, it is tabor, in the case of phenomenology, it is 
INTENTIONALITY. Variations are also notable. Marx re-
ferred to labor by the working class as the concrete 
overcoming of dualism, while Lenin alloted that func-
tion to the revolutionary elites. Although at one level 
Sartre separates the in-itself from the for-itself, this 
duality is abolished at the level of projects and pre-
reftective awareness. Merleau-Ponty demonstrates the 
impossibility of dualism by anchoring ali human ac-
tivities in the perceptual-corporeal field as mutual in-
teraction of phenomena and activity, arguing that it is 
as impossible to extricate either from the other as it is 
impossible to extricate human activity from the human 
corporeal interaction forming the sociopolitical body. 
For Husserl, various layers of awareness, from ki-
naesthetic to passive syntheses, make dualisms redun-
dant. For Landgrebe, even the question ofmetaphysical

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
materialism is undercut at the level ofthe kinaesthetic 
constitution ofspatiality and temporality, and hence the 
active production of historical SPACE and TIME. At this 
level Landgrebe is in agreement with a basic Marxian 
conception that history is not based on theoretical time, 
buton the time of activities directed and organized pur-
posively, and purposes are intentiona!. 
Although Husserl rejected the theory of dialectics 
in a most emphatic way as a mass confusion of chaotic 
concepts, various Marxists, such as Lukacs, were able 
to combine phenomenological conceptions of essence 
and form, articulating them in historical settings, such 
as the "essence of class consciousness" or the "essence 
of capitalistic society," and regarding them as a more 
scientific mode of articulating dialectical-historical re-
lationships than other methods. Essence and form are 
not abstractions behind singular objects, but comprise 
a concrete totality of interconnections within which 
singular objects find their function and meaning. Con-
sciousness is interpreted by Lukacs in terms of social 
class, with the claim that the proletariat has a con-
sciousness from whose vantage point the entire society 
becomes comprehensible as a constitution ofboth the-
oretical and practica! understanding. Lukacs !ater lent 
support to the sterile notion of dialectics, promoted 
by the poJitics of the UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST RE-
PUBLICS, but he returned after the Hungarian revolution 
of 1956 to the phenomenological articulation ofsociety 
as "social ontology" allowing for partial subject-object 
conjunctions at the level ofmeaning. This narrows the 
Husserlian conception of intersubjective objectivity. 
Husserl articulated a triadic morphology of( 1) the con-
stitution of the sense of the other as similar to myself; 
(2) a mutual founded-founding between the individ-
ual and the we-consciousness as a polycentric aware-
ness; and (3) an intersubjectively signified objectivity 
present in dialogue and praxis. 
A closer connection to phenomenology, and specif-
ically to the credibility of the primacy and/or the in-
clusion of consciousness in theoretical works, became 
preeminent in Marxism after World War II. The crisis 
of scientific reason, including the claims to science by 
dialectica! theorists, became manifest. 
Apart from Husserlian analyses in Die Krisis der 
europiiischen Wissenschafien und die transzenden-
tale Phănomenologie ( 1936), critica! theory offers a 
more complex investigation ofthe crisis by conjoining 
phenomenology and Marxism at the level of"praxis." 
The latter is evoked to demonstrate the crisis of the 
modern sciences, specifically in their NATURALISM, and 
to offer a critique of "instrumental rationality." This 
critique is designed to provide clues for deciphering 
hidden ideologies and to make emancipatory praxis 
possible. Critica! theory extends the notion ofpraxis in 
the lifeworld beyond the common Marxian economic 
limitations; it includes a variety of purposive-rational 
activities. 
In France, Sartre was at the forefront and led the de-
bate. Although his first major work, L 'etre et le neant 
( 1943 ), may seem more compatible with Hegel than 
with Marx, his critique of static Being (and by impli-
cation "materialism") allowed Sartre to reread Marx-
ian theory against the Soviet dogmatic conception of 
materialism and its "mirror theory of consciousness." 
Sartre recoups knowledge for Marx in terms of a praxis 
in which practica! knowledge is designed not to mir-
ror but to transform the world. Any passive theory of 
mirroring reality is best suited to accommodate the 
interests of a ruling or an elite class, leading to an 
"eterna!" bondage ofthe working class. Thus Marxism 
must be interpreted as a theory of purposive activity, 
comprising the reality of the human and the active 
transformation of the world as a genuine understand-
ing of this world. Praxis both unmasks and modifies 
reality, and thus avoids objectifying reification. This 
implies that the proletariat is best suited to understand 
the world of concrete praxis. The task ofthe proletariat 
is to unmask the reification ofthe objectified world and 
to rebel against its continuous maintenance in fa vor of 
a radically new project. As soon as a worker recog-
nizes his or her consciousness as class consciousness, 
as serial consciousness, he or she becomes part of a 
new awareness of mastery over the "objective" world 
and ofbeing in a position to project boundless possibil-
ities for transforming the given reality. Sartre here sti li 
includes the notion of"transcendence" ofthe given ob-
jective conditions, although he interprets this move in 
practica! terms. No type of materialism can accomplish 
such a move. 
Maurice Merleau-Ponty relates Marxism and 
phenomenology not only on the hither si de of projects 
and politica! aggregations, but also prior to the com-
mon views of praxis that emphasize labor as means 
for the transformation ofthe environment. Subtending, 

MARXISM 
437 
pervading, and enveloping all objects and activities is 
the phenomenal-perceptual field. Every human action 
is inextricably intertwined in this field and signifies 
the solicitations, suggestions, shifts, and above all the 
depth and ambiguity ofphenomcna. lndeed, the signi-
fications are the phenomena that cradle every datum, 
and significations come in clusters, opening other dus-
ters. No signification can be traced in its pure essence 
without residua of ambiguities. Merleau-Ponty locates 
the ambiguities ofthe historical development ofMarx-
ism and its various practices in Humanisme et terreur 
( 194 7) and Les aventures de la dialectique ( 1 957). The 
first ambiguity, stemming from Lukacs's work, is con-
cerned with the subject-object dichotomy and whether 
it could be surpassed in the relationship between the 
institution of the elite party and the proletariat. The 
party clarifies the proletariat to itself, while the latter 
-as the truth ofhistory-mediates the party's actions 
by the interests ofthe proletariat. Second, the ambigu-
ity of the first relationship is resolved in favor of the 
party, which claims privileged knowledge ofhistorical 
purpose and thus must lead the proletariat. The party 
is the universal subject, while the proletariat is its ob-
ject. This is Leninism and Stalinism and results in a 
violence of humans against humans. Third, the solu-
tion to this violence requires the lending of priority to 
spontaneous revolutions by the proletariat, since it is 
the historically destined group capable of abolishing 
subject-object dichotomies. But this too is ambiguous, 
since the proletariat acts not of its own accord, but due 
to inevitable historical forces. Meanwhile, the latter 
turned out to be historically false, since the proletar-
ian revolutions either did not take place in their purity, 
or they led to dictatorships of groups as subjects over 
other groups as objects. 
The conclusion drawn by Mcrleau-Ponty suggests 
that human situatedness in the phenomenal field pre-
cludes trusting in any unconditional universality of 
"reasonable human beings" forming all-encompassing 
human relationships. In consequence, relationships are 
not only situated in the field of signification, but are 
shi fting and lead to continuous ambiguities. Due to this 
conception, it is no longer feasible to claim a basic the-
sis, such as economy, that would explain everything. 
Rather, one must begin at the intersection of current 
relationships within which humans live; this includes 
customs and culture and above ali LANGUAGE. The lat-
ter is central in interpreting and transforming not only 
nature, but also the human being. 
The Marxist Lucien Goldmann shows the connec-
tion between phenomenology and Marxism in terms of 
a subject-subject, society and object nexus. Apart from 
Marxian dialectics, he uses Lukacs's and Heidegger's 
theories to break out of the sterile neo-Kantian dual-
ism. Goldmann favors Lukacs's theory ofthe primacy 
ofsociety over Heidegger's "authentic individualism" 
that resulted in the latter's acceptance ofthe Nazi mys-
tification of society as das Volk. 
Enzo Paei, who represents phenomenological 
Marxism in ltaly, points out the inadequacies of the 
French phenomenologists, particularly Sartre, with re-
spect to the practice of phenomenological method re-
quired to lead to the concrete subject and its intentiona! 
life. The method helps articulate the constitutive role 
of subjectivity and thus comprises means to overcome 
the traditional dichotomies of inner and outer. This 
point helps Paei claim that the proletariat can be cog-
nizant of the intentiona! structure of the reified world 
and thus can take on the class struggle in intentiona! 
praxis. This aspect is analyzed by Paei from the vantage 
point of Husserl 's Krisis. He regards the eri sis in terms 
of increasing reification and thus alienation through 
the reduction of human relations to object relations. 
These are expressed in the capitalistic divinization of 
scientistic objectivity, manifested in the process ofpro-
duction. The sole way ofthwarting this crisis consists 
of Husserl's phenomenological method and- prop-
erly understood- the works of Marx. Both attempt 
to recoup the place of the human in the lifeworld and 
to overcome the fetishism of reification. This requires 
that humans take responsibility for their world and for 
the realization of human -
and not object -
possi-
bilities. The latter are latencies of the lifeworld as a 
sedimentation of intentionalities. The latencies can be 
rearticulated and shown to possess human intentiona! 
ground. Here the subject and the lifeworld are the tran-
scendental grounds ofpraxis and social relationships. 
Ludwig Landgrebe relates phenomenology and 
Marxism at the level ofthe activity ofthe BODY, which 
abolishes subject-object dichotomies and is a ground of 
teleological conccptions. Moreover, the presumption 
of metaphysical materialism is inadequate without the 
prior grasp of concrete activities and kinaesthetic prac-
tices that correlate with the environment as purposive. 

438 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Kinaesthetic practices are involved in every activity 
that implicitly functions in the context of expectations 
and their fulfillment. In this sense, the conception of 
materiality is already framed in its practica! meaning: 
it makes sense insofar as it is correlated to the purpo-
sive bodily engagements. This is the dissolution ofany 
metaphysical dogmatism. Bodily activity also subtends 
sense awareness, thus phenomenologically confirming 
Marx 's claim that even the senses are nota pure means 
of knowledge, but are primarily engaged in practica! 
activity. 
For Landgrebe, such activities comprise the pri-
macy of the "I can" as the condition of subsequent 
abstractive and formalizing capacities. For him this is 
the basic Husserlian transcendental condition for the 
cognition of the world. The latter is prior to the scien-
tifically constituted world of homogeneous space and 
time. It is centered on the active bodily orientations 
toward tasks, deploying objects as up-down, left-right, 
front-back, from here to there, from now to then. This 
orientation is given from a position that is passively 
present prior to the "I think." It is the here-now region 
as an absolute fact prior to the distinction between 
essence and its factual exemplar. Thus it is the ground-
ing transcendental condition of the human lifeworld. 
In addition, this absoluteness combines both necessity 
and contingency. 
At this point HISTORY appears as the sedimented ac-
tivities both of individual and intersubjective orienta-
tions in and to the lifeworld. An individual is mutually 
oriented in and by the sedimented activities ofthe life-
world's history. The phenomenological background is 
used by Landgrebe to articulate the dilemmas in which 
Marxian metaphysicians have reduced Marx's thought 
to the metaphysics of "material nature." On the one 
hand, material nature is regarded "scientifically" as an 
explanatory category, and on the other hand, nature is 
regarded as a function of a lifeworld and its sedimented 
historical practices. For Landgrebe, Marx's thought is 
grounded in the latter conception in such a way that 
the "material base" is not metaphysical, but a "science 
of practices" wherein nature is a basis for purposive 
tasks and human orientations, inclusive of politica! de-
cisions concerning property and production, tasks in-
volving social classes, and the changing relationships 
between these two factors. Such relationships are not 
static; they change with different tasks and their correl-
ative bodily activities. Marxism is phenomenological 
at this level, and ali the metaphysical impositions by 
Marxists attempting tobe "scientific" fa il to appreciate 
Marx 's position. 
While seldom mentioned in connection to Marx-
ism, the work of Eugen Fink mediates between the 
two trends. At various levels, he shows the presence 
of rulership and labor and their shifting temporal re-
lationships to be among the fundamental phenomena. 
Temporality is a reflective cognizance that allows both 
the belonging of the human to nature and fulfillment 
of natural needs as well as the freedom to be open to 
the world. This cognizance is what comprises the basis 
of work and rulership, what compels human beings to 
be concerned with their fu ture and to secure it through 
work or rulership. The latter are coextensive with EDU-
CATION and with social relationships. They comprisc a 
techne that both relates the human to, and allows work 
with, nature. Work, rulership, and education are social 
phenomena. Society is, in principle, coextensive with 
the fundamental phenomena. 
At issue for Fink is the abstractive tendencies in 
philosophical thinking, tendencies that attempt to use 
one basic phenomenon as all-explanatory. Work, rulcr-
ship, temporality, and education arc interconnected 
with other basic phenomena. Losing sight of these 
interconnections leads to utopian ideologies and one-
sided power. This power shows up specifically in mod-
ern philosophies, where ali thought is regarded instru-
mentally and the environment is posited as material 
for productive labor. The latter requires freedom, with-
out which the human being could not grasp work, and 
freedom cannot be without work. In this sense, one 
can produce one's future because one is cognizant of 
one's needs, but also because work is an opening of 
freedom, and not a mere reaction to an environment. 
Modern thought stretches the notion of freedom to the 
li mit and as a result conceives ofwork as all-powerful, 
capable of any remaking of the environment. While 
Marxism does not reach the ontologica! grounds of 
modern philosophical thinking, it is one ofthe leading 
manifestations of this modern thought: through work, 
humans are in a position to restructure the environment 
and to obtain total freedom from it. Nonetheless, Marx-
ian thought must be connected to other phenomena if 
it is to avoid abstractive ideologica! utopias. 
Karl-Heinz Volkmann-Schluck is best known for

his ontologica! investigations of various philosophies 
and various periods. What is relevant for the connec-
tion between phenomenology and Marxism in his work 
is the opening of the ontology of modern age that 
subtends Marxism. MODERN PHILOSOPHY is metaphysics 
gone wild in a variety of forms, from Platonism and 
ideal human constructs to power drives, ali imposed 
arbitrarily on "indifferent nature." Even mathematical 
theories embody in their essence rules for the transfor-
mation of nature in accordance with the requirements 
of reflective will and are, therefore, a kind of TECH-
NOLOGY. This will posit, for the modern age, the iden-
tity between freedom and equality. Modern history is 
the tension between these two concepts, such that at 
times they converge and at times they diverge. The 
project ofMarxism is to show how these two concepts 
have diverged in capitalism; one has politica! freedom, 
but economic inequality. It will require communism to 
make these concepts identica! once again. 
Although there are controversies between pheno-
menology and Marxism, and between phenomenolo-
gists and Marxists objecting to each other's and their 
own camp's interpretations of these two trends, there 
appear to be major convergences and sufficient mutual 
respect to warrant continued dialogue.

MATHEMATICS 
The idea of a distinctively 
phenomenological philosophy of mathematics has its 
origin in the work ofEDMUND HUSSERL. Husserl received 
his Ph.D. in mathematics, and his philosophical views 
grew out of his early efforts to address some basic is-
sues in the foundations ofmathematics. His first book, 
Philosophie der Arithmetik ( 1891 ), expresses severa! 
ideas about a phenomenological approach to mathe-
matics that would, in one form or another, continue 
to play a role in his !ater philosophy. Husserl came 
to regard that work as deficient in a number of re-
spects, however, and his conception of a phenomen-
ological philosophy of mathematics varied somewhat 
as his views matured. After launching an attack on PSY-
CHOLOGISM in Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901) 
and taking a turn into CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY, 
he continued to give serious thought to general issues 
about LOGIC and mathematics in ldeen zu einer reinen

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
und die transzendentale Phănomenologie ( 1936), Er-
fahrung und Urteil ( 1939), and numerous unpublished 
works. 
A number of themes concerning mathematics 
emerge from Husserl 's mature, transcendental pheno-
menology. A central theme is to show how the subjec-
tivity ofthe cognitive acts and processes by which we 
come to have knowledge can be reconciled with the 
objectivity of "ideal" mathematical objects and truths. 
Husserl approaches this problem through his theory of 
INTENTIONALITY, according to which consciousness is 
directed at ( or "referred" to) mathematical objects by 
way of the contents ( or "MEANINGs") of its acts. Thus 
the phenomenology of mathematics would require an 
analysis ofthe acts, contents, and objects ofmathemat-
ical cognition, which would provide, at the same time, 
an analysis ofthe meaning and reference ofmathemat-
ical expressions. 
Let us first consider what Husserl says about the ob-
jects of mathematical cognition. He argues that math-
ematical objects must be understood as "ideal," not as 
"real." Mental acts and processes have temporal du-
ration and are "real," but mathematical objects cannot 
be characterized this way. Mathematical objects, like 
other objects, are identities through different cognitive 
acts, but they must be understood as abstract, and as 
not located in space and time. They are omnitempo-
ral and acausal. In Etfahrung und Urteil he says that 
they are "free idealities," meaning that they are ide-
alities that are not bound to particular times, cultures, 
places, or persons. To assume that they are not "free," 
Husserl argues, would make it impossible to account 
for the science of mathematics as it is actually given 
and practiced. 
These comments on mathematical objects suggest 
that Husserl was some kind of a Platonist or mathe-
matical realist. There has been some disagreement in 
the literature about exactly how to interpret his real-
ism. The matter is complicated by the fact that Husserl 
seeks a transcendental, "constitutive" phenomenology 
of our awareness ofmathematical objects and facts, and 
this suggests to some that he is some kind of an ideal-
ist. Many commentators ha ve emphasized one ofthese 
tendencies in Husserl's thought to the exclusion ofthe 
other, but interpretations ofthis kind do not seem tobe 
in the spirit of his effort to show how the perspectives 
can be reconciled. It can be argued that he is an ideal-
ist about the nature of our awareness of mathematical 
objects, but not about the objects themselves. 
The objects transcend our cognitive acts and pro-
cesses and are seen as such in a more detailed pheno-
menological description. We see, for example, that acts 
directed to mathematical objects are no different from 
other kinds of acts in having "horizons," where these 
horizons are determined by the meanings ( or contents) 
of the acts. The horizon of possible ways of fiii ing in 
our knowledge of a number, set, or function given un-
der a certain description shows that our knowledge of 
such objects is not complete. To this extent, the num-
ber, set, or function transcends our grasp of it and is 
mind-independent. We also cannot will such an object 
to be anything we want. Only certain possibilities are 
compatible with the meaning under which the object is 
thought. These and other considerations lead Husserl 
to criticize naive forms of metaphysical realism and 
idealism about mathematics. 
Husserl's mingling of idealism and realism has 
some historical precedent in the work of Bernhard 
Bolzano (1781-1848), and also in KANT's claim that 
one can be a transcendental idealist and an empirica! 
realist. The difference between Husserl and Kant is 
that Husserl wants to be a realist about mathematical 
objects as well. The problem with Kant's view of math-
ematics is that the discipline has changed significantly 
since the 18th century. 
Husserl also began to develop an analysis of the 
cognitive acts and processes by which we come to 
ha ve knowledge of mathematical objects. In Philoso-
phie der Arithmetik he argued against GOTTLOB FREGE 
and others that the concept (in the intensional sense) 
ofnumber could not be defined and that we must seek 
to understand it by investigating the cognitive acts and 
processes in which our awareness of number had its 
origins. He found that acts of collecting, authentic 
counting, and comparing, along with certain acts of 
abstraction, reflection, and formalization were, in ef-
fect, conditions for the possibility of the awareness of 
number. In !ater works, he developed and refined his 
analysis of the knowledge of ideal objects. In ldeen !, 
for example, he argued that the transition from SPACE 
to the mathematical idea of a Euclidean manifold was 
a function of a formal universalization that must be 
distinguished from generalization. 
In the Logische Untersuchungen Husserl argues that 

MATHEMATICS 
441 
knowledge of founded "categoria!" objects, of which 
mathematical objects and facts forma species, requires 
that our intentions to such objects be fulfilled. Knowl-
edge is a function ofthe fulfillment of our empty inten-
tions, whether in ordinary perception or in the founded 
intentions of mathematics. He defines the notion of 
intuition in terms of the fulfillment of intentions and 
holds that intuition is the basic source of EVIDENCE. It 
follows that there must bea kind of categoria! intuition 
and, for mathematical objects in particular, a kind of 
mathematical intuition that is built up from straightfor-
ward perceptual acts in various founded acts, such as 
acts of abstraction and reflection. Husserl had already 
noted in the Logische Untersuchungen that different 
types and degrees of evidence could be provided by 
intuition. Evidence could be of an a priori nature or 
not, it could be apodictic or not, more or less adequate, 
and more or less clear and distinct. 
From these general claims we can derive a number 
ofbasic features of a phenomenological view ofmath-
ematical intuition, evidence, and TRUTH. First, Husserl 
holds that mathematical knowledge is a priori, and that 
mathematical truths are apodictic (i.e., necessary), al-
though there can be certain adjustments or corrections 
in our understanding of which truths are apodictic. 
Mathematical knowledge can be more or less clear and 
distinct, and also more or less adequate. By the time of 
Formale und transzendentale Logik, Husserl came to 
regard perfect adequacy as an ideal limit. In order to 
ha ve adequate evidence concern ing a mathematical ab-
ject, every possible act required to make knowledge of 
the abject complete would ha veto be carried out. Sin ce 
we are onlyfinite beings we would have to say, with 
respect to our knowledge of objects, that mathematical 
truth is always "truth within its horizons." This is still 
compatible with Husserl's distinctive form of realism, 
since it means that there is something about an abject 
that transcends our knowledge, that there is more that 
we could come to know. 
Since Husserl 's analysis of knowledge starts with 
the notion of intentionality, we arrive at a view that 
is quite different from a causal theory of knowledge. 
This is especially important in the philosophy ofmath-
ematics, for adherence to a causal theory ofknowledge 
seems to rule out the possibility of explaining mathe-
matical knowledge. It could be argued, moreover, that 
any causal theory would presuppose such an intention-
alist view. Another notable feature of Husserl's posi-
tion is that in taking mathematics to ha ve its origins in 
our everyday experience in the LIFEWORLD we have an 
advantage over alternative views on which it is diffi-
cult to explain how parts of mathematics could have 
applications. 
Many additional features of the phenomenological 
view of mathematics derive from the centrality of the 
notion of intentionality. Consciousness, as we said, is 
directed at ( or "referred" to) mathematical objects by 
way of the intentiona! contents ( or "meanings") of its 
acts. It frequently happens that the same object is given 
to us under different "meanings," but we do not always 
know when this is the case. This fact induces a rather 
strict criterion ofintensional identity and difference on 
the contents of our acts. Husserl says we must always 
start with objects precisely as they are intended. This 
leads him, in generaL tobe very cautious about elimina-
tive reductionist schemes in philosophy. Reductionism 
is the effort to collapse the differences between the 
meanings under which we think objects by introduc ing 
translation schemes and the like. Ifthis is coupled with 
eliminativist motivations, we can encounter problems. 
The philosophy ofmathematics in particular is rife with 
eliminativist programs, since mathematics has been the 
last bastion of abstract or ideal objects. 
Predictably, Husserl argues that such programs do 
not do justice to our mathematical intentions and to 
the way in which mathematical objects are intended in 
our acts. Husserl objected to psychologism for these 
reasons. Psychologism was just a fonn of empiricistic 
reductionism. Other forms included anthropologism, 
nominalism, and some forms of fictionalism. In gen-
eral, Husserl was opposed for these reasons to various 
forms of empiricism, NATURALISM, positivism, and con-
ventionalism about mathematics. These views simply 
do not do justice to what we know in the science of 
mathematics. They fail to respect mathematics itself 
as it is actually given and practiced, and they could 
actually hinder progress in the science of mathematics. 
We also see in this attitude a resistance to a one-sided 
extensionalism about logic and mathematics. 
Empiricist reductionism is also typically accompa-
nied by some form of RELATIVISM, and so a phenomen-
ology of mathematics should avoid such relativism, 
but without going to the opposite extreme of abso-
lutism about mathematics. Mathematical truth, for us, 

442 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
is truth within its horizons, and our knowledge is sub-
ject to degrees of adequacy and clarification. In !ater 
writings, like the Krisis, Husserl extended these ideas 
to a critique of historicism about mathematics (in par-
ticular, geometry) and science, but argued that an ah is-
torica! rationalism about mathematics was equally mis-
taken. What is needed instead is a descriptive meaning-
clarification that is not reductionistic, and that could be 
applied to the primitive terms and axioms ofmathemat-
ical theories. The EIDETIC MFTHOD of free variation in 
IMAGINATION would serve the purpose of such informal 
rigor. Husserl also continued to emphasize the role of 
the GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY ofbasic Concepts oflogic 
and mathematics, for the point ofsuch analysis is to caii 
us back to the basic meanings ofthese concepts and to 
see how meanings come to be sedimented in founding 
and founded acts in a way that reflects our own a priori 
cognitive role in the development ofmathematics. 
In his criticism of Frege in the Philosophie der 
Arithmetik, Husserl points out that even Frege's at-
tempt to provide an explicit, extensional definition 
of number in the Grundlagen der Arithmetik (1884) 
amounts to a kind of reductionism about the meaning 
of the concept of number. Since the effort to provide 
such a definition is central to logicism, it is clear that 
the phenomenology of mathematics must be different 
from logicism. 
Formalism in the style of David Hilbert ( 1862-
1943) might also be associated with a reductionist out-
look, but there are also other problems with it. For-
malism, taken seriously, involves just the kind of for-
getfulness of meaning, or forgetfulness of origins, that 
Husserl decries. This does not mean that formalization 
has no value. On the contrary, Husserl thinks it has 
great value as long as it does not preclude the notion 
of meaning and de generate into "mindless" or "mean-
ingless" technical work. Indeed, the "crisis" ofthe sci-
ences described in works like the Krisis is supposed to 
involve just such a degeneration. Husserl 's idea is that 
where there is REASON there is thinking of objects under 
certain concepts or meanings. It is these meanings that 
govern our thinking of objects, and hence our investi-
gations. The horizons of our acts are determined in a 
rule-like way by the meanings, and they fix our expec-
tations and our understanding of how to work toward 
the ideal of completing our knowledge through posing 
and solving open problems. Hence to eschew meaning, 
or meaning as we actually have it in mathematics, is 
to Iose our aims and in some sense to subvert reason 
itself. 
In the process of developing these central ideas, 
Husserl put forth and sometimes withdrew many other 
interesting ideas on geometry, arithmetic, logic, the 
theory of parts and wholes, FORMAL ONTOLOGY, mani-
fold theory, formalization, axiomatization, and related 
subjects. 
A number of philosophers and phenomenologists 
who followed Husserl ha ve investigated these ideas or 
compared them with developments in logicism, for-
malism, intuitionism, predicativism, mechanism, and 
the rise of Cantorian set theory. Early investigators 
inciuded OSKAR BECKER, FELIX KAUFMANN, and ARON 
GURWITSCH. Severa! mathematicians and logicians were 
also influenced in some measure by phenomenology. 
HERMANN WEYL invokes Husserl's work in his devel-
opment of predicative analysis, his flirtations with in-
tuitionism, and his views on mathematical cognition. 
Arend Heyting (1898-1980), following Becker, iden-
tifies the constructions of intuitionistic mathematics 
with fulfilled mathematical intentions. KURT GODEL ar-
gues for a phenomenological foundation ofmathemat-
ics. The recent work of PER MARTIN-LOF on intuitionistic 
meaning theory has also been influenced by phenomen-
ology. 
At present, there is a renewed interes! among 
philosophers in the phenomenology of mathematics. 
It is likely that this will continue. GOdel, for example, 
has argued that phenomenology holds the promise of 
providing the most workable philosophy ofmathemat-
ics in light of developments following the discovery of 
the set-theoretic paradoxes and the demise of Hilbert's 
programat the hands ofthe incompleteness theorems. 
There is also much that can be done in light of other de-
velopments in the philosophy and foundations ofmath-
ematics sin ce Husserl 's time. There is not only room 
for more work on the relation ofthe phenomenology of 
mathematics to logicism, formalism, mechanism, intu-
itionism, predicativism, and the rise of Cantorian set 
theory, but also on its relation to new forms of Platon-
ism, empiricism, nominalism, fictionalism, structural-
ism, and the use of moda! concepts in mathematics. We 
could also expect to deepen our understanding of math-
ematics through further analysis of phenomenological 
ideas in connection with the work of seminal figures

MEANING 
One of phenomenology's 
main preoccupations is with the meanings and 
meaning-structures characterizing experience. ( Some-
times meaning [Sinn] is rendered as "sense.") A the-
ory of meaning is of central importance for pheno-
menology. For this, we go back to the first of ED-
meaning that is intended, and also distinguished be-
tween the meaning that is intended and the abject that 
is referred to through that meaning. The mental act is 
a real, psychological occurrence belonging to the in-
ner life of an EGO, and the abject that is being referred 
to may be a real spatiotemporally individuated entity 
or an irreal entity (an essence ora number, for exam-
ple) or even nonexistent. In contrast, the meaning is 
an ideal entity, not spatiotemporally individuated, not 
a real part ofanyone's mentallife, but capable ofbeing 
communicated and shared and of being again. Men-
tal life thereby comes to be conceived as a many-one 
correlation between real acts and ideal meanings. 
Husserl's own theory went through at least five 
phases. At the beginning, in the Philosophie der Arith-
metik ( 1891 ), he thought it possible to clarify meanings 
by showing how they originale in mental life. Later 
rejecting this attempt as a sort ofpsychologism, he ad-
vanced the thesis in the first edition ofthe Logische Un-
tersuchungen that the meaning of a meaning-intending 
act (Jinguistic or otherwise) is a species whose in-
stances are ali those acts that intend that meaning. Later 
he held that as so stated, the theory fails to distinguish 
between the ideality of meanings and the ideality of 
universal objects, and thus he replaced it by the theory 
that the ideal meanings are correlates of acts. 
Meanings are now called noemata, which are said to 
be constituted by meaning-conferring acts "animating" 
the hyletic data of one's experience. The problem with 
this account centered around the concept of "hyletic 
datum" is that no such pure, uninterpreted data could 
be identified, and experience, however far one may 
proceed to decompose it or trace it back to simple ele-
ments, is always found to be meaningful in the broad 
sense. With this remnant of empiricism overcome by 
ARON GURWITSCH and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, the uni-
versality of noesis and NOE MA, experience and mean-
ing, becomes the defining feature of both descriptive 
and CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY. 
The fourth phase of Husserl 's thinking about mean-
ings is to be found in the Jdeen zu einer reinen

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
phie 1 ( 1913 ), where a distinction is ma de between 
sensuous, perceptual meanings (now called Sinne) and 
their transformations into conceptual and logica! form 
(now called Bedeutung), the latter being expressible in 
LANGUAGE. 
Finally, constitutive and especially GENETIC PHENO-
MENOLOGY proposed tracing every meaning back to its 
Urstiftung or "original establishment" in history. HIS-
TORY is then studied as history ofmeanings, and mean-
ings are said to be historical in their origin. Ali this 
should nevertheless be understood in the context ofthe 
central thesis of the ideality of meanings. It is only 
ideal meanings that are truly historical. 
Unlike in ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY, the bearer of mean-
ing for phenomenology is not a sign, nor a word or 
sentence regarded as a linguistic entity, but rather an 
intentiona! experience or, technically, an act. Linguistic 
meaning is grounded in contentual meanings that them-
selves are ideal contents of actual and possible acts. 
Perceptual meanings are meanings of perceptual acts. 
In each case, ideality implies repeatability. A meaning 
is not an evanescent particular. Early on, Husserl saw 
that the thesis of the ideality of meanings cannot ac-
commodate the meanings ofthe so-called "occasional 
expressions" or indexicals that are essentially tied to 
variable spatiotemporal and subjective contexts. Hold-
ing fast, however, to that basic concept, he went on to 
distinguish between the function of indic ating mean-
ing and the indicated meaning, and suggested that the 
former is an invariant meaning-function of indexicals, 
while the latter changes from occasion to occasion. 
But Husserl was soon dissatisfied with this account 
ofindexicals and ata certain point oftime was tempted 
to regard indexicals as somewhat like proper names in 
that the name coincides with the object: on this changed 
theory, an indexical names its object by pointing (via an 
act of intending) to that object. In the course oftime he 
began to think that occasional elements were contained 
in ali experiences of real things. This change of view 
was connected with his discovery that ali intentiona! 
experience is horizonal, so that even the so-called ob-
jective meanings, which were earlier contrasted with 
subjective and occasional meanings, threatened to be 
subsumed under indexical ones. 
The thesis that ali experience is horizonal also en-
tails that an atomism of meanings must be rejected. 
But does the rejection of atomism of word meanings 
entail an unmitigated holism for which the context of 
meanings cannot be limited, so that against the limit-
lessness of context the distinction between valid and 
invalid meanings, between meaningfulness and mean-
inglessness, would disappear. Here phenomenology 
must abide by the principle that a horizon is a horizon 
insofar as it lets a thematic figure stand out. Identities 
( ofmeaning) get constituted within a horizon (of a con-
text, of a tradition, of a history), and we need not set up 
a speculative construct of a limitless contexture within 
which identities are merely vanishing ripples. 
An intentiona! act, like an expression (an utterance, 
for example), not only has a meaning, but is about 
something, that is to say, it has an objective correlate. 
Even in the absence of a really existent object or even 
of an ideal entity, an expression may have meaning. 
With the question of real existence or nonexistence of 
its object thus placed within brackets, an intentiona] 
act may have its meaning and its intended object. The 
two do not coalesce inasmuch as the same object may 
be intended in a different manner, and so through a 
different sense. Since there is no direct access to an 
object sa ve through a sense, and since there is no route 
from an object to a sense, but rather always from a 
sense to the object referred to, the identity ofthe object 
becomes a function ofthe various senses through which 
it may be referred to. Hence the priority ofmeaning in 
phenomenological research. 
The goal of knowledge is TRUTH, i.e., apprehen-
sion of the object as it is. If this goal is not to be 
a chimera, what it entails is that the te/os of know-
ing as an intentiona! act is achieved when the object 
is experienced exactly as it was intended. The cog-
nitive movement, then, is from meaning-intention to 
meaning-fulfiliment, to a coincidence of the intended 
meaning and the fulfilied meaning. The fulfilling or 
verificatory experience itself does not con fer meaning 
upon an expression. The ideal meaning is prior to per-
ceptual or experiential confirmation. But the fulfilling 
experience has its own meaning-content as weli. 
Thus from the phenomenological perspective, there 
is no escape from meaning. A phenomenology of PER-
CEPTION therefore has to do with perceptual meanings, a 
phenomenology of RELIGION with religious meanings, 
a phenomenology of AESTHETIC experience with aes-
thetic meanings, and so on. In each case, the task is to 
describe the meanings, to look for their constitution, 

MEANING 
445 
and to watch for how the meanings, in each case, make 
up a different world. 
In other philosophers belonging to the phenomen-
ological movement, the idea of meaning departs con-
siderably from Husserl 's. In this account we shall refer 
to the views of MARTIN HEIDEGGER, MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY, and JACQUES DERRIDA. In Heideggcr's view, the 
origin of meaning is not in the sign, nor is it in con-
sciousness, i.e., in the meaning-intending act, but rather 
in DASEIN 's understanding of Being. The sign itself, for 
Heidegger, is a case of being ready-to-hand (zuhan-
den), and so the reference of the sign presupposes a 
more fundamental reference- i.e., "being useful for" 
-
characterizing the mode ofbeing of ali that is ready-
to-hand. Every ready-to-hand is a movement in a total 
functional context. But the Iatter totality refers back to 
a primary "toward-which" or "for the sake of which" 
(Worum-willen)- which is constitutive ofthe being 
of Dasein. This account denies the Husserlian intuition 
of meanings. Understanding is not intuitive, but pro-
jective. "Sinn" means "the toward-which (Woraufhin) 
of the primary project, which makes comprehensible 
something as that which it is in its possibilities." An 
entity has "meaning" when it is understood in the light 
of such a project. 
Perhaps one can formulate the difference between 
Husserl 's and Heideggcr's theories of meaning thus: 
for Husserl, theoretical meaning, which is the con-
ten! of intentiona] acts of consciousness, is primary, 
whereas for Heidegger practica] meaning deriving 
from Oase in 's practica! projects is primary. 
In Phenomenologie de la perception ( 1945), 
Merleau-Ponty rejects Husserl's grounding of mean-
ings in subjective acts, of the meaning of words in 
achievements ofthe thinking subject, and would rather 
return to "la langue," and then embed language in the 
pre-objective lived world. The word is neither "merely 
a psychic, physiological, or even physical phenomenon 
set alongside others" nor an "empty container," a 
merely externa! accompaniment of thought. Both em-
piricism and intellectualism are mistaken. The word 
itself has a meaning. Speech is not a sign of thought, 
but by its physiognomy and together with its gestural 
and existential significance, it is "the subject's taking 
up of a position in the world of his [ or her] meanings" 
that already are in the lived, cultural, world. 
Derrida 's critique of a Husserlian theory of mean-
ing does not require having recourse to a phenomen-
ological theory of human beings and their world. It 
is rather an attempt to radicalize Husserl 's own tran-
scendental move. The Husserlian ideal meanings, by 
their very ideality, are independent of any particular act 
of speaking ( or intending) them, just as they are also 
independent of any fulfilled reference. The ideal mean-
ings are repeatable, but for their repeatability, they 
precisely require the written text that the Husserlian 
account rejects as a mere externa) and accidental ac-
companiment. While this dependence of ideality on 
writing shows that idealities are not purely transcen-
dental (i.e., they, in their full identity, cannot be con-
tents of the inner acts), their repeatability implies a 
never-to-be-completed process of repetition. Besides, 
repetition implies difference, so that the alleged pure 
identity ofmeaning threatens tobe dissolved into infi-
nite and endless differences. Taking up Husserl's idea 
of horizon -
that every meaning-intention functions 
within a contexture- Derrida sees no way of limiting 
this horizon, while an endless opening of the context 
would obliterate the distinction between the meaning-
ful and the meaningless. The thesis of "ideal unity 
of meaning" thereby gets "deconstructed" -
not de-
nied or refuted. The validity ofthis "critique" depends 
upon the correctness of Husserlian ideas of "ideality," 
"constitution," and "repeatability" : on these matters, 
it would seem that the Derridian reading of Husserlian 
texts is on the one hand clase and on the other hand 
flawed by a rhetoric that goes beyond phenomenology.

MEDICINE 
J. N. MOHANTY 
Temple University 
Despite its historical diversity, 
the phenomenon of medici ne reveals two fundamen-
tal themes. ( 1) People become ill or injured; as this 
is experienced as unsettling, a "dis-ease," they seek 
help. (2) However "help" may be construed, others 
profess that ability. In whatever tradition or approach, 
what Edmund Pellegrino calls the "architectonic" of 
medici ne is the relationship between healer and person 
to be healed: the clinica! event. The complex, domi-
nant allopathic model of medici ne is only one among 
severa] approaches, including osteopathy, homeopathy, 
chiropractic, etc., that, for various reasons, have notat-
tained its prestige or influence. Within allopathy there 
are diverse traditions- dogmatism, empiricism, and 
methodism -
that have been influential at different 
times. 
The marriage of medicine to biomedical NATURAL 
SCIENCE avidly promoted since the 19th century, and 
politically supported in the 20th, resulted in much so-
phisticated TECHNOLOGY (transplantation, contraceptive 
pills, gene splicing, etc.) and diagnostic wonders (ultra-
sonography, computed tomography, cardiac catheteri-
zation, etc.). Especially in the biomedical sciences, the-
ory and practice are merged: to know is to have power 
over things known. "Nature" (and human "nature") be-
came conceived in terms of the ability to control and 
alter what is known. As Hans Jonas argues, "practica] 
use is no accident but is integral to it ... 'science' is 
technological by its nature." 
Medical technologies provide powerful means for 
transfonning human nature, effecting Jasting changes 
in sexuality, genetic predispositions, etc. Technologi-
cal and biomedical prowess pose serious moral and po-
litica] dilemmas. Psychopharmacology makes it plau-
sible to control individuals and populations, render-
ing present-day humanity, especially more vulnerable 
members, a crucial moral problem. Mortality may be 
controlled and makes the extension of life and death 
heady moral and policy issues. 
Medicine's central theme is clear: the clinica] 
event governs. The physician must determine "what's 
wrong," "what's likely to happen," and what can 
and, with the patient or legal surrogate, should be 
"done about it." Diagnostic, pharmacological, and 
other knowledge is strictly therapeutic, for the sake 
of afflicted people, specifically, the 130DY -
circum-
stances and conditions permitting, its aim is to cure, 
improve, or at least comfort. 
This was recognized throughout medical history. 
Many Hippocratics thought that diseases stemmed 
mainly from opulent living. Changes in the soul (mood, 
habit, temperament) were thought to be connected to 
changes in the body, and whatever was taken in had 
effects. When intake is improper or creates an imbal-
ance, a healer must exercise clinicaljudgment, assess-
ing the relationship among the powers (physies) of the 
body along with those of illness and the healing "art." 
Clinica] judgment yields insights into the forces oflife 
and death; the healer's word counts. The clinica] event 
is a unique complex of knowledge, experience, and 
practice employed by healers, as the Hippocratic oath 
affirmed, solely on behalf of afflicted people. 
Medicine is a craft, an artful exercise of informed 
reasoning, a diagnostic and prognostic science, and an 
interventional enterprise. In each respect, it abounds 
in interpretations of personal and bodily signs. The 
meaning ofthese differs historically and within differ-
ent traditions, depending on which ofwhat Susanne K. 
Lan ger ( 1895-1985) ca lis "generative ideas" ha ve gov-
erned the interpretation of signs, therapies, knowledge, 
practice, the meaning of illness or health, etc. Interpre-
tations are as diverse as the data to which physicians 
attend, and lead to interventions governed by therapeu-
tic goals. 
One core generative idea is "symptom." lts orig-
inal dogmatic interpretation is that they are externa] 
signs ("visibles") of interna] disorders ("invisibles") 
stemming from the imbalance or improper location 
of "humors." For contemporary physicians, however, 
interpreting and treating diseases involves a form of 
analogical reasoning that moves from externa] bod-
ily signs ( effects) to interna] pathological events in

MEDICINE 
447 
search of causal connections (the original meaning of 
diagnosis) suggesting statistically significant patterns 
("logica! classification of disease") forming distribu-
tion curves along which a particular condition will, 
with more or less probability, be found. Recently, im-
portant changes have raised questions about the allo-
pathic model, espccially as medicine has shifted from 
its primary focus on scientific discovery (of diseases 
and their causal mechanisms) to intervention. This shift 
is toward a more prominent concern for the individual 
sick person, making clinica) judgment and discourse 
thematically central. 
This shift also demonstrates the place of interpre-
tation and HERMENEUTICS. Some urge that sound prac-
tice requires new kinds of knowledge: not only biol-
ogy, but COMMUNICOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY, and 
other HUMAN SCJENCES. The shift also revived generative 
ideas from a rival medical tradition. Known as empiri-
cism in Hippocratic times, one of its main forms !ater 
evolved into medical skepticism or, due to its concern 
with method and the priority oftherapy, methodism. 
Skeptics opposed dogmatics on every topic, includ-
ing "humors." Their interpretation of"symptoms," for 
instance, emphasized the patient's personal and histor-
ical characteristics: place and style of living, dietary 
regimen, moods, habits, and the like. Medical reason-
ing focused on the person in search of historical con-
nections for the patient's illness so as to devise plans 
of action to alter the course of illness and lifestyle. 
"Symptoms" became "commemorative signs" indicat-
ing those connections: semeiesis supplanted diagnosis. 
Rather than analogically derived causal connections 
between "visibles" and "invisibles," the personal, his-
torical circumstances determine illncss and health: epi-
logismos replaced analogismos. 
Similarly, contemporary physicians increasingly 
emphasize "communication skills" in relating to pa-
tients, to understand and treat them- beginning with 
the patient's own experience and understanding of iii-
ness and narrative about it, then diagnosing the patho-
physiology. The major diseases of our times (heart dis-
case, stroke, diabetes, malignancies like lung cancer 
and AIDS) occur, Eric Cassell notes, "primarily from 
the way we live"- echoing the skeptic's emphasis. 
The "art'' is essentially therapeia and episteme is based 
on it, for it is only in the course of treating illnesses 
that they are known and understood. History-taking 
and clinica) conversations are as necessary as physical 
diagnoses, and aim at devising interventional strategies 
jointly with patients, families, or surrogates-the true 
authorities for decisions. 
In allopathic medicine, understanding disease re-
quires that particular symptoms and their mechanisms 
be generalized into statistica) diagnostic patterns. Typ-
ically expressed in regular ways in cells, organs, or 
enzyme systems, biologica) reactions may also be al-
tered by genetic makeup or changes in the immune sys-
tem. Clinica! intervention suggests that such abstrac-
tion risks undermining the aim of the clinica) event. 
Personal habits, diet, the environs, and the like are 
equally significant for understanding and treatment. 
Sensitive clinica) care requircs affirming the patient's 
experience in the patient's own terms -
and in light 
ofthese, negotiating acceptable therapies or preventive 
measures. Increasingly recognized as crucial to clinica! 
judgment are, Arthur Kleinman insists, the narratives 
in which patients express and order their experience of 
illness. It is thus important to develop listening skills 
in order to learn how patients express and interpret 
their experiences in their own narrative language. Of-
ten, neither patients nor families te li their stories well, 
at times making it difficult to determine whethcr they 
are informed, uncoerced, and capable of making deci-
sions. Helping patients tell their stories is thus a vital 
clinica) responsibility. 
Nevertheless, physicians are rarely trained tobe sen-
sitive and reftective interpreters of different systems of 
meaning. They are also rarely taught that biologica) 
processes are known only through socially constructed 
categories. Not only is interpreting patient discourse 
a "semiotic activity," but so are diagnosis, therapeu-
tic determinations, and prognosis. Clinica) judgment 
thus denotes initiating and interpreting patient narra-
tives and translating them into medical discourse, to 
determine what is wrong and what can be donc about 
it, and then, with the patient, family, or legal surrogate, 
deciding what can and should be done. 
Beyond interpreting bodily signs, the physician 
must attend to each patient's embodiment: experiences 
and interprctations of the body and self woven into, 
expressed by, and displayed through the rich tapestry 
of personal narrative. Within their personal and cul-
tural context, symptoms are, like textual symbols, mu-
tually determinative and enlightening: context elab-

448 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
orates meaning, symbol crystallizes context. Clinica! 
judgment is, Kleinman remarks, "more like literary 
criticism or anthropological analysis of a ritual ... than 
like the interpretation of a laboratory test or a micro-
scopic slide of a tumor," and, therefore, the physician 's 
methodology is best understood as a form of EXISTEN-
TIAL or HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY. 
Other aspects ofthe clinica! event need attention and 
caii for insights from phenomenologically informed 
sociology, psychology, communicology, and other dis-
ciplines. As noted, diagnostic, pharmacological, prog-
nostic, and other knowledge is strictly designed and 
ordainedfor the sake ol afflicted people- its aim is 
to cure, improve, or at least comfort. The clinica! event 
governs, but even in its most rudimentary form the re-
lationship between healer and person needing help is 
quite complex. A phenomenology of medicine should 
at least attend to the following aspects of the clinica! 
event. 
( 1) At least two persons are engaged in a kind of 
con versation at a particular time in each of their re-
spective biographies, the dialogue going on within spe-
cific circumstances (e.g., intensive care) occurring in 
one among many settings (hospital, oftice, or clinic), 
involving other providers (nurses, consultants, social 
workers) and various ofthe patient's intimates (family, 
friends, acquaintances). Each setting has its own writ-
ten and unwritten guidelines, protocols, regulations, 
and laws, ali of which are set within the broader so-
ciety with its prevailing values concerning sickness, 
wellness, and the like. 
In addition to what ALFRED SCHUTZ terms their re-
spective biographical situations -
including values, 
beliefs, habits, personal histories -
physicians be-
long to a specific profession_ (medicine) and specialty 
(surgery or pediatrics)- at times, even subspecialty 
(neurosurgery or neonatology)- each of which has 
its own codes and standards of practice. Medical work, 
moreover, is conducted within some institutional ar-
rangement (partnership, clinic, or hospital) with its 
committees, policies, etc. The particular region and 
state have their regulations and laws as does the fed-
eral government; the medical profession and specialty 
organization ha ve their standards of practice and codes 
-ali of which are components of the current cui ture 
with its folkways, mores, laws, institutions, and his-
tory. Personal, professional, institutional, and prevail-
ing social value-contexts configure and influence each 
clinica! encounter. Understanding the specific issucs 
at stake in any clinica! encounter requires identifying 
and explicating these elements and how they shape 
what is attended to and interpreted by the situational 
participants. 
(2) On the side ofthe patient is an equal though less 
formal cultural ordering. Their biographical situations 
reveal distinctive values, attitudes, histories, linguistic 
usages, and habits, some of which are shared by the 
person 's intimates. Patients typically belong to social, 
business, politica!, or religious groups that have their 
own traditions, values, and usages- which in various 
ways indicate much about the patient. Like physicians, 
patients are part of the same ( or some) cui ture with 
its prevailing social values, mores, and folkways. Un-
derstanding the patient's experience of illness, injury, 
or handicap requires identifying and explicating these 
elements, principally by careful attention to linguistic 
usages (images, metaphors, etc.), paralinguistic char-
acteristics (pauses, emphases, etc.), and situational de-
terminants (place, time, setting, etc.)- accomplished 
through cautious mindfulness to the participants' nar-
ratives. 
(3) Structurally, the relationship is essentially asym-
metrical, with most power on the si de ofthe physician. 
Physicians, not patients, have the knowledge, skills, 
access to resources, social legitimation, and legal au-
thorization to deal with illness. Not only does illness 
compromise the patient, so does the relationship itself. 
The patient is multiply disadvantaged. This structural 
imbalance suggests that the relationship !ies within the 
moral order. The unavoidable trust by the patient in-
vokes, on the healer's si de, a peculiar blend of virtues 
of justice (dike) and self-restraint (sophrosyne): the 
physician ought never take advantage of the exposed 
and vulnerable patient, family, or household. In this 
respect, the myth of Aesculapius at the heart of the 
Hippocratic tradition stands in dramatic contrast to the 
vi sion of social life embodied in another great mytho-
logical tradition expressed in the ring of Gyges tale in 
Plato's Repuhlic- in which "taking advantage" ofthe 
vulnerable is precisely the point of asymmetrical social 
relations. 
(4) Current social conditions (fragmentation, spe-
cialization, vertical and horizontal mobility) are such 
that asi de from a person 's ci rele of intimates and more

or less stable neighborhood, people for the most part 
interact as strangers. They do not know to what extent 
they share values, be\iefs, or attitudes about health and 
illness and do not usual\y know what claims they may 
make on each other. A need for help and the offer to 
help brings them together, but their relationship can 
be difficult. When that need is signaled by serious iii-
ness, involving aggressive and intimate interventions, 
the situation is ripe for conflict. Yet the sick person 
has little choice but to trust in numerous ways: people 
( often anonymous, from anaesthesio\ogists to manu-
facturers), things (equipment, substances), and proce-
dures (tests, operations). There are substantive reasons 
for ensuring ongoing, sensitive conversations with pa-
tients, but among strangers these can be awkward. Di-
alogue deeply informed by the structural asymmetry 
of their relationship is essential -
the sole means by 
which the physician can at ali earn that trust, even 
temporarily. 
(5) Talking with patients, the physician is engaged 
in complex interpreti ve efforts to find out what's going 
on, what's going to happen, and what can and should 
be done. This means that the physician is responsi-
ble for taking nothing for granted about the patient, the 
content ofpatient discourse, and its paralinguistic char-
acteristics, physiognomic gestures, and the setting that 
mutually determine the sense ofwhat is said and done. 
The physician must also determine the pathophysiol-
ogy and the form it takes within this person's embody-
ing organism, personal life, and cultural milieu. That 
they are strangers ineluctably influences their conver-
sation, especially when recommended surgeries, med-
ications, diets, and other treatments are aggressive, in-
vasive, and intimate. The physician must attend to the 
patient's pertinent history, ability to understand and 
comply, and willingness to accept recommendations. 
(6) Reflection on the experience of illness reveals 
that space, place, time, relations between se\fand body, 
etc., undergo alterations that disclose emotive, voli-
tional, and cognitive components that are specifically 
focused. Attention is directed-to the sick person ("How 
do you feei?"), oriented-toward the patient's particu-
lar circumstances ("What's wrong with you?"), and 
aimed-at his or her possible futures ("When will you 
get bettcr?"). This displays an almost visceral alertness 
-a bodily tug tobe mindful ofthis person within the 
context of compelling vulnerability. As thus focused, 
these constituents propel the self beyond itself. They 
are in this sense an elemental ec-stasis; to be self is 
to be-beyond, always already with the other. "Subjec-
tivity" is from the outset of life "co-subjectivity." Self 
(person) is an accomplishment, a prize won through 
complex developmental experiences that at times un-
dergo profound changes within the experience of iii-
ness. 
(7) Certa in phenomena are therefore especially crit-
ica! to understanding medical practice and the illness 
experience: body, self, and JNTERSUBJECTJVITY in partic-
ular (self: that ee-static moment so deeply embedded, 
embodied, inscribed inwardly; embodiment: that "inti-
mate un ion" that frustrated Descartes and many others 
after him). So "intimately" is selfbound to its embody-
ing body that there is the constant temptation to say, "1 
am my body": hit "my" body and you hit "me." Here is 
the source of"be\onging," from it springs other senses. 
Yet however intimate and profound is the relation be-
tween self and self's body, it is equal\y truc that the 
body can be experienced as strange and alien. 
1 am my body; but in another sense 1 am not simply 
my body. This otherness is so profound that we feei 
forced to qualify the "am" : it is not identity, equality, 
or inclusion. It is "mine," but this means that self is 
distanced from its body, for otherwise there would be 
no sense to "belonging," to experiencing it (and other 
things) as "mine." So close is the union that one's ex-
perience ofthe own-body can be surprising (its happy 
obedience that the self notices for the first time ), even 
shattering (its hateful refusal to obey my wishes). So 
intimate is it that self has moments in which it feels 
"at home" with it. Yet so other is it that there are times 
when self treats the own-body as a mere thing that is 
other ( obsessively stuffing it with food or otherwise 
mistreating it; or as when it is encountered as "having 
a life ofits own" to which self must willy-nilly attend). 
(8) Embodiment is essentially expressive. It is that 
whereby feelings, desires, strivings, etc., are enacted 
(in culturally and historically different manners). Em-
bodiment is valorized, for what happens to embodying 
organism happens to embodied self. As the embody-
ing organism is that whereby the individual "ru\es and 
governs," the embodied self is at the same time sub-
ject to its conditions. What happens to it matters to the 
self whose body it is: the embodying organism !ies at 
the root of the moral sense of inviolability of self, of 

450 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
personhood- of"privacy," "integrity," "respect," and 
"confidentiality." 
This VALUE character of the embodying organism 
helps.elucidate why many bioethical issues- preg-
nancy, prenatal diagnosis, abortion, psychosurgery, 
withdrawal of life-supports, euthanasia, etc.- are so 
highly charged and deeply personal. On the other hand, 
the profound moral feelings evoked by certain medical 
practices (surgery, chemotherapy, dialysis) and much 
experimentation (the human genome project) are un-
derstandable. They are ways of intervening into that 
most intimate of spheres: the embodied person. Self is 
embodied, enacts itself through that specific animate 
organism that is "its own." Bodily schemata, attitudes, 
movements, actions, and perceptual abilities are ali 
value-laden modalities by which self enacts and ex-
presses its character, personality, habits, goals: that by 
which selfis alive. 
(9) As ali ve, the embodied self is intimately bound 
to death; when horn we are old enough to die. At the 
same time, there is something else about human birth. 
Unless nurtured by others, a baby most surely will die. 
Unlike other animals and most primates, humans do 
not come ready equipped at birth with the repertoire 
of instincts necessary to make it on their own. Social-
ity is fundamental to human life. The typical opposi-
tion, "nature versus nurture," is a half-truth. Whatever 
our biologica! endowment, "being" is "becoming" (as 
GABRIEL MARCEL said, to be human is "etre-en-route"), 
and becoming is necessarily a being enabled-to-be by 
a myriad ofnurturing actions. Others are inscribed and 
dwell within us, enabling us to be who we are. 
( 1 O) Kierkegaard was right: these relationships are 
reflexive. lndeed, selfis a reflexive expression divested 
ofthe pronominative it modifies ("my-," "your-seJr'). 
Self is thus related to an other: it is that in the relation 
that the relation relates itselfto its own self. So under-
stood, however, it is still not completely grasped, for 
"that in the relation that the relation relates itself to its 
own self' is, as Kierkegaard saw, set into play either by 
itself or by another. As the first possibility is incoherent 
-
such a caus a sui cannot exist, cannot bring itselfinto 
nor maintain itself in being- the relation that relates 
itself within that relation to itself must ha ve been set 
into play by another. He postulates a "Power" that, "as 
it were," lets this peculiar inwardly-outward reflexive 
relatedness "go out of Its hand" and lets it be on its 
own: the phenomena of parenting and birth. Mother 
lets baby go from her womb (better: baby finds itself 
biochemically ready to exit and there it is, worlded). 
Baby is enabled-to-be whatever it may be within the 
womb, where there are already the beginnings of mu-
tual relationships. 
Each human being is a reflexivity: self is self-
reflexive, however minimally this may beat any partic-
ular stage. Its being/becoming is "staged," temporally 
phased in its being/becoming-what-it-is. In different 
terms: within the relation, mother is reflexively related 
to and as herself in and by her being related to baby; 
baby is reflexively related to and as itself in and by 
being related to its mother; and both are related to and 
as each other in and by being self-and-other-related 
within the relationship. There are thus two self-related 
reflexivities related, within their relation, to one an-
other, bound to and as each other inwardly- mutually 
situated and oriented to one another. 
The ec-stasis is a "being oneself by and as being 
with others." The ee-static being is one whose inward-
ness and awareness of self is enabled by the other. Tobe 
human is thus to be a reflexive inwardness turned (by 
the mutual relationship with the other) reflexively out-
ward from the outset. The immediate nurturing other 
(parent/baby) is already within the self(baby/parent) as 
that whereby the baby is at ali able to be and become. 
Subjectivity is intersubjectivity (esse is co-esse). By 
enabling the baby to be-en-route, mother is enabled to 
be-herself (i.e., she is mother by and as mothering or 
nurturing her baby) -
and conversely. To be self is 
at root tobe enabled-to-be-self-aware, to whatever ex-
tent and in whatever way it may be. Even a miminally 
self-aware infant cannot continue to be without the 
enabling, nurturing mutuality relationships of mother 
(and others) with baby; the infant's being as self-aware 
arises through those relationships with mother (and 
others) and correspondingly, mother becomes mother 
through her mutually relating relationships with baby. 
(Il) Sick or well, people not only experience and in-
terpret their own bodies (pain, discomforts, or hunger) 
and themselves (well, sick, or poorly), but also react 
emotionally to what is happening to them ( fear, hope, or 
uncertainty). Patients want to know, at times fervently, 
about their illnesses; they want to know "what's go-
ing on" and "what can and should be done about it"; 
they want to know that the people taking care of them 

MEDICINE 
451 
also care for them. Whether their doctors inform them 
(well, poorly, or notat all) about their ailments, people 
interpret their own illnesses in typical ways: as "bron-
chitis," a "cold," "ulcers," but also as "unfortunate," a 
"damned nuisance," or "devastating." Within the clin-
ica! event, the same complex, mutually related reflex-
ivities are evident between healer and patient. Each 
relates to, experiences, and values the other (doctor: 
"This patient needs help"; patient: "This doctor is very 
careful"). Each experiences and values him- or herself 
within the relationship to the other (doctor: "I think 
1 can help you"; patient: "She really cares for me"). 
Each relates reflexively to, experiences, and values the 
relationship itself (doctor: "Helping you is rewarding"; 
patient: "I felt as if I were a part of a team"). 
(12) By another principle of clinica! hermeneutics, 
the doctor is engaged in "second-order" interpreta-
tions (Schutz), precisely because the doctor is always 
faced with the patient's experiences and interpretations 
(of self, body, world, as well as of physician, nurse, 
or drugs). In different terms, like language, illness is 
complex: the way it is manifested, what it means to 
the patient, what the doctor says and how this is un-
derstood by the patient (and vice versa), what family 
or friends say, and still other factors to be taken into 
account. Medical interpretations are multidimensional: 
the doctor interprets the pathophysiology, the way the 
disease is uniquely manifested in a particular patient, 
how it is experienced and what its significance is for the 
sick person, how the patient reacts to the physician 's 
talk, etc. 
(13) Medicine, finally, is an essentially fallible en-
terprise; mistakes are always possible. What distin-
guishes medicine from most other professions is the 
constant possibility of doing terrible harm to a vulner-
able person. This suggests a third principle of clinica! 
hermeneutics: the physician's work with patients must 
always include the possibility of diagnostic, therapeu-
tic, prognostic, and other types of interpreti ve error and 
make concrete plans in the event that mistakes occur. 
The relationship with patients thus also includes the 
oftentimes difficult effort to communicate to patients 
the risks and uncertainties associated with every treat-
ment- after all, they must li ve with the aftermath of 
every decision. 
As Samuel Gorovitz and Alasdair Maclntyre put it, 
human beings are "particulars" like hurricanes and salt 
marshes, which interact continuously with a variety of 
uncontrollable environmental factors. The systematic 
focus on particulars, then, involves other values than 
those belonging to truth seeking and problem solv-
ing, and these are just as interna! to medicine as truth. 
Particulars are wholes that flourish or languish in the 
world; they involve a sense ofvalue: what that particu-
lar's own "good" is. We cannot even study particulars 
without some reference to that good, nor without ref-
erence to its own perspectives and striving. Unless one 
understands what it is for a tree, dolphin, or gorilla to 
flourish, one fails to understand them as the particulars 
they are. A type of regard or respect for their integrity 
is a precondition for understanding. Therefore, a sci-
ence of particulars cannot be concemed simply with 
finding law-like generalizations, and the best possible 
judgment may always turn out to be erroneous because 
of the necessary fallibility of our knowledge of partic-
ulars. 
As regards different types of particulars- hurri-
canes, dolphins, or people -
the kinds of predictive 
power and corresponding law-like generalizations by 
which we know whatever it is we do know about them 
will necessarily differ. We always face regions of ig-
norance regarding any type of individual- variations 
in environmental context, specific factors about their 
history, specific configurations of physical and other 
operative mechanisms. Some of these factors, more-
over, vary in unpredictable ways (environmental con-
texts ofpeople even within the same ethnic group, for 
instance ). Thus the types of generalizations available 
for each type of particular are in principle generaliza-
tions prefaced by "characteristically and for the most 
part," or in Husserl 's well-known phrase, "un tii further 
notice." 
To be sure, patients are encouraged to believe that 
physicians will not make mistakes, even though the 
desired results may not be achieved and even though 
it is undeniable that some physicians make mistakes. 
Because of the necessary fallibility of medical science 
and practice, it is in the nature of medical practice that 
mistakes are possible. Thus the patient-physician rela-
tionship must be understood as including that prospect; 
errors occur, sometimes culpably, sometimes because 
of the current state of development of medicine, and 
sometimes because of the necessary fallibility of the 
art itself.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Whether one focuses on allopathic medicine or the 
altematives mentioned or refiects on the traditional di-
versity of medical history, the two core clues for a 
phenomenology of medicine are the afflicted and vul-
nerable person who seeks help and those who profess 
the ability to help. Whichever tradition or approach 
is followed, the relationship between healer and per-
son needing help is critica!: the clinica! event is the 
common thematic thread. On that basis, an array of 
other issues inherent to the relationship must be probed. 
Because medicine in any form falls within the moral 
order, a range of ethical questions must also be ad-
dressed: values governing "helping"; diversity of moral 
values (patient, family, professional, institutional, cul-
tural) and how inevitable confiicts may be resolved; 
whether or not different moral traditions can compre-
hend the range of ethical, social, and politica! issues 
raised by the "new genetics"; whether or not "health" 
and "illness" are moral values; and still others. 
Medicine is a rich mine for detailed phenomenologi-
cal work: the place of "free phantasy variation" in di-
agnostic and linguistic interpretations; the forms of 
EVIDENCE and TRUTH in medical work; the precise ways 
in which "doctoring" involves special forms ofEPOCHE 
AND REDUCTJON; and the phenomena of embodiment, 
self, person, intersubjectivity, and the forms of social-
ity- and how these are constituted within the clinica! 
event.

MEMORY 
Memory has been on the agenda of 
phenomenology since the beginning. As early as 1893 
EDMUND HUSSERL concemed himself with the question 
ofhow the unity of a changing event is retained after the 
event itselfhas ceased to occur. How is it that we keep 
in mind something such as a melody that has ended as 
something actually heard? Indeed, how do we even re-
taina melody as a selfsame event as it is unfolding and 
then vanishing? To address these epistemic and experi-
ential issues, in Vorlesungen zur Phanomenologie des 
inneren Zeitbewusstseins [1905] he distinguished be-
tween "fresh memory" and "full recollection." In fresh 
memory, I hold together a continuously fading event; 
in full recollection, I repeat it. But in what does such 
fading and repeating consist? 
In pursuing stricter descriptions of these two kinds 
of memory -
each a basic phase of the "conscious-

MEMORY

ness of interna! time"- Husserl developed subtle dis-
tinctions between what he called (inspired by WILLIAM 
JAMES) "primary" and "secondary" memory or (increas-
ingly after 1908) "retention" and "recollection." In re-
tention, I hold onto an event that is "just past'' by a 
"unique kind of intentionality." What is unique is that 
I intuit- indeed, I can even be said to perceive- a 
transpiring event before it has expired by virtue of the 
fact that I grasp it in a continuum of fading phases. The 
retaining is not a specific grasp of something determi-
nate or object-like; it is itself embedded in the flow of 
TIME as a "comet's tai!" ofthe event 1 experience. Even 
though every retention stems from an originary source-
point of time perceived as "now," the retention itself 
gives rise to a series of modifications of itself: reten-
tions ofretentions ofretentions ... In this way a given 
retention bears "the heritage of the past in the form 
of a series of adumbrations." As "adumbration" (Ab-
schattung) suggests, it is a matter of shadowings-forth 
of the original temporal event, to which corresponds 
the "running-off' (Ablaufen) of retentions that stream 
from this event as a persisting unity. Where the suc-
cession of newly arising "nows" represents "ever new 
life," the sinking-down (Absinken) ofretentional series 
passes into obscurity in a "march of death." At every 
stage the temporal event assumes a modified "way of 
appearing" that is at once continuous and yet ever dif-
ferent, thereby effecting a "continuous transition of 
perception into primary memory." 
Husserl 's passion for making EIDETIC distinctions 
is nowhere in better evidence than in his claim that 
secondary memory or recollection must be distin-
guished sharply from primary memory or retention. 
His paradigm case remains musical, but now it is a 
matter ofremembering an entire concert, notjust a sin-
gle melody. In recollecting a concert, I am stationed 
in time after the event-to-be-remembered has ceased 
to happen. I must repeat or "reproduce" it, and I do so 
by re-presenting it in my mind. Presentational aware-
ness ( Gegenwărtigung)- a mode of perception- has 
given way to RE-PRESENTATION ( Vergegenwărtigung), a 
positing "presentation" that is distinguished from the 
non-positing presentations of pure IMAGINATION. The 
running-off of retention has ceded place to the running-
through of recollection. What I run through is the en-
tire previous experience, both its row ofnows and the 
"temporal fringes" that flank each now. 1 recollect the 
concert-event itself as "an immanent or transcendent 
enduring objectivity," and I am aware of a new series 
of retentions- those that now accompany my current 
recollection. In short, remembering the fully expired 
past is a complex phenomenon in which there is adi-
versity of "modes of accomplishment" ranging from 
f!ash memories to full-scale reproductions. The variety 
ofthese modes is considerably greater than is possible 
in primary memory. While there is only one way for 
the just past to be run off in retention -
i.e., to sink 
continually downward- there are many ways for the 
elapsed past to be run through in recollection. 
Similarly, there are various ways in which to antici-
pate or expect the fu ture- ways that contrast with its 
spontaneous protention, the analogue of retention and 
the forward frînge of every present moment. But EX-
PECTATION, in contrast with recollection, is essentially 
empty and unfulfilled. 
The acute differences between retention and recol-
lection (including the fact that retention is intuitive and 
recollection is not) must not diminish the fact that both 
are modes ofmemory. As such, they cannot be utterly 
divergent and, in fact, they draw close to each other on 
severa! counts. For one thing, every recollection has 
its own retentions. More importantly, a particular re-
tention is, in its very partialness, revised and repeated 
in an eventual recollection that includes it and other 
related retentions. When I recollect a given event, I 
bring it back as ifit were present; recollecting is qua~i­
perceiving; it is running through the original event "as 
it were." The present of the reproduced event is not 
given, nor is it itself even presented as such, but it is 
nevertheless re-presented. For there is an identity be-
tween what is the retained and what is the recollected 
object: I recollect the same event that is retentionally 
modified in the first experiencing of it. 
Husserl 's celebrated Vorlesungen of 1905- edited 
extensively by EDITH STEIN and (to a much lesser ex-
tent) by MARTIN HEIDEGGER- were continually supple-
mented, especially through 1917. The emphasis of the 
lectures and their supplements was placed on precise 
description, and it can be argued that they represent 
the purest and most complete examples ofphenomen-
ological analysis ever produced by Husserl himself. 
He never lost interest in memory- it sti li comes un-
der close scrutiny in the C manuscripts of 1930---35 
-but his attention was drawn increasingly to special 

454 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
problems rai sed by remembering rather than to the phe-
nomenon as such. In the late text Erfahrung und Urteil 
( 1939), for example, the question of the "unity of the 
remembered" is taken up at length. 
A sti li more revealing instance of Husserl 's !ater, 
more focused concern with memory is found in the 
fragment entitled "Die Apoditizkităt der Wiedererin-
nerung" [ 1922/23]. This remarkable text opens with a 
skeptical question: Ifl do not have apodictic certainty 
regarding my past experiences, am I not confined to 
the momentary truth of my "ego cogito"- i.e., what 
is true at this very moment about my current cogitation? 
How can I be certain that my past life of experience 
and thought is my experience and thought? How can I 
lay claim to it if I am not absolutely certain that it is 
mine? Again employing a musical example, this time 
the memory of a song I ha ve heard, Husserl argues that 
1 recollect this past experience with varying degrees 
of "adequacy"- as more or less certain up to a limit 
of complete adequation in "perfect memory": "some 
recollections may unveil more ofthe object, and some 
unveilless." 
But more than differing degrees of adequation or 
fulfillment is at stake in recollection. When I recollect 
my previous experience of a song, I also reftect ( on 
myself) in the recollection: I find my (former) self in 
its very intentiona! content. To do this I must first of ali 
reduce the spatiotemporal "world-reality" ofthe song 
and its sin ger. Then, by a further "apodictic reduction," 
1 gain access to the past flowing that belongs to the past 
remembering, indeed to my entire "past transcendental 
life." In particular, I experience apodictic evidence of 
my past perception of the song; it is as if my present 
self or ego and my past self were "swimming together 
in a stream," albeit in contrary directions, my present 
self going downstream, my past selfupstream. In thus 
rejoining my previous self, my intention of the past 
is continually fulfilled. Hence recollection, despite the 
fact that it deals with an already elapsed experience, 
possesses apodictic contents. We see this most saliently 
in the case of recollecting an experience that has just 
ended: about this experience I have an "ineliminable 
certainty." Even in the case ofrecollecting temporally 
remote experiences, we can say that "the mode of cer-
tainty runs inalterably through the entire continuum of 
intentionality." In the end, nothing is altogether or in 
principle uncertain, even ifwe must recognize degrees 
of certainty and the fallibility of memory with re gard 
to particular details. Every recollection has its "frame 
of uncertainty," but this is compatible with the fact 
that it "will also always and necessarily ha ve a certain, 
universal, and ineliminable content." 
Beyond establishing the evidential certainty ofrec-
ollection in the face of a dire Cartesian skepticism, the 
fragment of 1922/23 also attributes to recollection an 
indispensable epistemic ro le in mentallife: namely, the 
enduring truth of that to which we return in recollec-
tion "again and again." This truth can be simply em-
pirica!, as in the ascertainment of certain facts whose 
repeatability in recollection supports their objectivity, 
or it can be eidetic: i.e., at the level of law or essence. 
In his introduction to his 1962 French translation of 
Husserl's "Die Frage nach dem Ursprung der Ge-
ometrie als intentional-historisches Problem" ( 1939), 
JACQUES DERRIDA has emphasized the paradox ofmak-
ing essential structures dependent on their own reit-
erability in memory. At the very least, Husserl points 
to the continuai reinforcement that occurs in the ordi-
nary course of remembering. The same thing that is 
given in an "original now" of perception is prolonged 
in the "just now" of retention, and it appears once 
more in the "as it were now" of recollection (itself 
often repeated again and again). The same synthetic 
logic of retentive-cum-reproductive reinforcement ob-
tains in the case of essences, which are thereby "rec-
ognizable again and again as absolutely the same, i.e., 
[as] 'again'-experienceable." Certainty and sameness 
show themselves to be two si des of the very power of 
remembering to bring the past back in a consistently 
reliable format: to re-present it as ever equal to itself. 
One important phenomenon of memory to which 
Husserl did not systematically attend is forgetting. It 
was left to Heidegger to address forgetting as some-
thing to be taken seriously in its own right- as Sig-
mund Freud had already indicated. In Sein und Zeit 
( 1927, the year before he edited and presented Stein 's 
edition ofHusserl's time lectures) Heidegger proposes 
that there is a primary forgetting that, far from being 
merely a deficient remembering, enables the latter it-
self to exist: "Just as expecting is possible only on 
the basis of awaiting, remembering is possible only on 
that offorgetting, and nof vice versa." On Heidegger's 
account, far from forgetting being a reason for search-
ing for ever greater memorial certainty -
much less 

MEMORY 
455 
apodicticity- "having forgotten" ( Vergessenheit) is a 
positive form of disclosure for DASEIN, indeed an "ee-
statica! mode of one's having been- a mode with a 
character of its own." Just as o ne becomes "authentic" 
(eigentlich) only on the basis ofbeing inauthentically 
embroiled in the everyday WORLD, so one remembers 
only from forgetting as the horizon of memory itself. 
It follows that forgetting is not simple oblivion; it is 
not a passive process; it is an active forgetting- as 
Nietzsche might call it- of one's own thrown being-
in-the-world. 
Indeed, forgetting, like authentic temporality, has 
its own "ec-stasis," albeit one that has as its effect a 
closing-off: "the ecstasis (rap ture) of forgetting has the 
character ofbacking away in theface of o ne 's ownmost 
'been,' and of doing so in a manner which is closed 
off from itself- in such a manner, indeed, that this 
backing-away closes off ecstatically that in the face of 
which one is backing away, and thereby closes itself 
off too." Paired with disclosure is a double closure-
or, more exactly, a double foreclosure: of the forgot-
ten event itself and of oneself as sealed off from this 
event in non-remembering. "Only on the basis of [Da-
sein's] forgetting," remarks Heidegger, "can anything 
be retained by the concernful making-present which 
awaits ... To such retaining there corresponds a non-
retaining which presents us with a kind of 'forgetting' 
in a derivative sense." Such secondary non-retaining 
corresponds to the ordinary sense of forgetting the past 
-
the very sense that spurred Husserl to write "Die 
Apodiktizităt der Wiedererinnerung." Heidegger pro-
poses that an ontologically prior sense of forgetting 
sets the stage for remembering in its many guises. Such 
forgetting abets the work of "repetition," the authen-
tic form ofDasein's having-been as the handing down 
of the possibilities of existence. In repetition I do not 
attempt to bring back the past as I do in recollection; 
instead, 1 resolutely anticipate what can be repeated in 
the future as a "reciprocative rejoinder" (Erwiderung) 
to possibilities ofthe very Dasein that has already been 
there. 
In !ater writings as well, forgetting figures promi-
nently in Heidegger's subtle and highly suggestive ap-
proach to memory. It figures, above ali, as the way in 
which Being has become "veiled" from adequate on-
tologica! remembrance. This lethic veiledness is not a 
belated product of ontologically obtuse thought but has 
been present from the earliest moments ofGreek med-
itation on Being: "What is most thought-provoking, 
what long sin ce and forever gives us food for thought, 
remains in its very origin withdrawn into ob1ivion 
(Vergessenheit)." The task of memory is not merely 
to recapture or restore what has been forgotten but 
to keep in mind what must be thought about, and to 
do so by fostering and preserving what remains to 
be thought. In this light, "keeping is the fundamen-
tal nature and essence of memory." Such memory is 
a thinking-back (Andenken: commemorative thinking, 
a re-thinking that responds) to Being as the thought-
worthy. But it thinks back only from within the horizon 
of oblivion itself: "only from within the unknown an-
nounced by this horizon does Being appear come to 
meet us." 
It follows that any reduction of memory to repre-
sentational thinking will be inadequate to the task of 
such an ontologically adequate remembering. Mem-
ory therefore means "something else than merely the 
psychologically demonstrable ability to retain a men-
tal representation ( Vorstellung), an idea, of something 
which is past." As the stepchild ofMnemosyne, mem-
ory is more a matter of"heart" (Gemut) than of"mind" 
(Geist). It is a mindfu1ness that is ''the gathering and 
convergence of thought upon what everywhere de-
mands tobe thought about first of ali." In "Das Ding" 
( 1951) Heidegger asserts that the encounter with a bare 
"thing" caUs for more than representational recollec-
tion: the thing becomes a mere "object" when "we 
place it before us, whether in immediate perception or 
by bringing it to mind in a recollective re-presentation" 
(erinnernden Vergegenwărtigung: Husserl's word is 
here explicitly invoked). 
Others in the phenomenological tradition ha ve taken 
up the question of memory in productive ways. In Der 
Formalismus in der Ethik und die materiale Wertethik 
(Formalism in ethics and nonformal ethics of value, 
1913/1916), MAX SCHELER briefty but pointedly treated 
"immediate" and "mediate" remembrance as types of 
memory that are not reducible to retention and rec-
ollection, since the first bears on the content and the 
second on the act of remembering. Forgetting, strictly 
speaking, belongs only to mediate, act-bound remem-
brance, as does the allied phenomenon of "trying to 
remember X." WILLIAM EARLE has argued forcefully for 
a "direct realism" of memory in his Autobiographical 

456 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Consciousness (1972). In order to remember some-
thing (i.e., to "recollect" it in Husserl 's sense ), no rep-
resentations, much less images, are required- given 
that the past, albeit elapsed, presents itself to us in 
person and as such. Heidegger's critique of represen-
tationalist views of memory is here strengthened by 
a positive thesis concerning the past's unmediated ac-
cessibility (unmediated even by the act-character of 
remembering itselt). 
If Husserl's treatment of recollection has been 
widely disputed, his account of retention has rarely 
been challenged. Nor has its considerable promise of 
possible extensions been fully explored. One such ex-
tension, for instance, is found in MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY's account ofthe "customary body," whose repet-
itive skillful actions imply a specifically habitual BODY 
memory. As outlined in his Phenomenologie de la per-
ception (1945), such a body memory, in its contin-
ual availability and instantaneous enactability, is the 
corporeal complement of primary memory as envis-
aged by Husserl. The organist or typist- in Merleau-
Ponty's leading examples- draws upon a fund ofim-
mediately accessible bodily actions that require no in-
tervention ofrepresentations (indeed, the interpretation 
of such representations would risk aborting the actions 
themselves). Habitual body memory exemplifies the 
"corporeal intentionality" upon which Merleau-Ponty 
insists as an expansion upon FRANZ BRENTANo's original 
yet unduly mentalistic notion of act-intentionality-
which cannot contain, much less explain, the varieties 
and vicissitudes ofbodily experience. 
To posit body memory is to open up a Pandora's 
box of further possibilities. Some of these have been 
explored in EDWARD s. CASEY's Remembering: A Pheno-
menological Study ( 1987). Investigating severa! non-
habitual forms of body memory, this book also exam-
ines place memory (not only memory of place as such 
but the crucial, though hitherto undiscussed, role of 
place in virtually ali remembering) and commemora-
tion (in which the past is less recollected than reenacted 
in a participatory manner). Considered as well are three 
"mnemonic modes" that make up the proximate envi-
ronment ofthe remembering self: recognition, remind-
ing, and reminiscing, each of which is intermediate 
between mind and world in distinctive ways. The in-
herently social character of commemorating and rem-
iniscing is emphasized, as are the special indexical di-
mension ofreminding and the close (but not exclusive) 
alliance with perception in the case of recognizing. A 
critique ofmentalism is conjoined with an effort to cir-
cumscribe the paradigma tic position to which recollec-
tion has been assigned in Western thought from Plato 
onward (though reaching an apogee in early modern 
philosophy). Emphasized here is the "thick autonomy'' 
of memory- its enmeshment in the toils of perduring 
process, its continuing existence in density, depth, and 
slow sedimentation. Despite its intrinsic thickness, re-
membering is also seen to possess its own freedom, at 
once active and passive, based equally in the self and 
in the other, and situated in the present and in the past 
(and even, by its adumbrative power, in the future). 
We are what we remember ourselves to be. Yet at the 
same time, our remembering in-gathers the diversities 
and marginalities and forgottennesses of our conscious 
life, taking everything experienceable in as remem-
bered- and giving it back out aga in as re-membered 
in the ongoing place-world. 
The matter of memory is stil! far from settled. Ever 
more precise descriptions of remembering -
and of 
forgetting-are needed ifphenomenology is to realize 
its mission offinding the essential structures of a basic 
phenomenon such as this. Moreover, questions of just 
how a phenomenological approach to memory might 
contribute to contemporary concerns in coGNITIVE sci-
ENCE and ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE are unreso]ved but 
important to address. In contrast with most ofthe cur-
rently employed paradigms in the areas just mentioned, 
phenomenology offers a nuanced treatment ofmemory 
in its experiential, qualitatively specific aspects. This 
treatment, despite its incompleteness at the present mo-
ment, not only complements other more quantitative 
approaches, but is called for in any adequate account-
ing ofthe many remaining mysteries ofmemory.

MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY 
Although a 
contemporary and friend of JEAN-PAUL SARTRE and SI-
MONE DE BEAUVOIR, Maurice Merleau-Ponty spent his 
life as an academic. He was bom in Rochefort-sur-
Mer, Charente-Maritime, on March 18, 1908, studied 
at the Ecole Normale Superieure, and taught philoso-
phy and psychology at the Sorbonne and finally at the 
famous College de France. He died in Paris on May 
3, 1961, only 53 years old. Merleau-Ponty's interest in 
philosophy was supplemented with scientific interests, 
particularly in PSYCHOLOGY and the HUMAN SCIENCES. 
His first book, La structure du comportement ( 1942), 
dealt with the question whether the scientific study of 
animal and human behavior should be mechanistic. 
No doubt there were humanistic concems behind this 
question. How can we in our scientific study do justice 
to the distinctive nature of animals and, in particular, 
human beings? How are we to counter those tendencies 
of NATURALISM in science that reduce the human being 
to nothing more than a material or natural object? 
La structure shows the influence of GESTALT PSY-
CHOLOGY, a school ofpsychology that emphasized the 
need to recognize structures or forms, particularly 
in perception. Applying this way of thinking more 
broadly, Merleau-Ponty argued that a particular case 
of animal or human behavior is not a response to a 
physically or chemically determined stimulus-object, 
but a response to a structured environment in which 
both the object and that particular response ha ve a spe-
cific, holistic sense or meaning for the animal. A type 
ofbehavior, in short, is tobe seen in correlation with a 
meaningful environment, which for its part is specific 
to that behavior. 
Merleau-Ponty took this development in the sci-
ences to converge with the insights ofphenomenology. 
For as he saw it, the question as to what mode of exis-
tence a form has could not be avoided. From the earlier 
discussions in La structure, it had become clear that a 
form is nota (first-order) object, but rather the milieu 
through which such objects appear to a sentient being. 
From the standpoint ofbiology or Gestalt psychology, 
to be sure, it appears as an object of sorts, but this is 
clearly due to the objectification intrinsic to the scien-
tific attitude. The question remains: what is a form, ifit 
is not an object but rather a condition for the possibility 
of experience? To answer this question, according to 
Merleau-Ponty, we should adopta reflective stance and 
try to appreciate structures from the standpoint of the 
being whose behavior is so structured. This realization 
led him to phenomenology, the movement of thought 
of which he became a classical representative and to 
which he remained loyal to the end of his life. 
The founder of that movement, EDMUND HUSSERL, 
had held that phenomenology is a retum to the "mat-
ters themselves," i.e., a reflection on the experience 
in which objects present themselves to us. He inter-
preted this retum in the spirit ofthe Kantian tradition, 
namely as a retum to the subject as a condition for the

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
possibility of the WORLD. In the absence of this tran-
scendental subject, Husserl thought, there would be no 
world at ali. Because this subject constitutes whatever 
is or can be thought, it cannot be a part of the world. 
He therefore called it pure consciousness. Husserl's 
CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY, it is clear, is reminis-
cent of KANT, who agreed with Hume that what we are 
given by sense is an unintelligible manifold, and then 
proceeded to argue that what is needed to overcome 
Hume's problem are acts that interpret the manifold 
and thus create for us a world of objects. The Kantian 
principles of interpretation are the so-called forms of 
sensibility and the categories ofthe understanding. 
Merleau-Ponty, however, interpreted the idea of 
phenomenology in his own way, as MARTIN HEIDEG-
GER had already done in Sein und Zeit ( 1927). The 
work that established his reputation was entitled La 
phimomenologie de la percep ti an ( 1945). In it he ar-
gued that the most primordial form of experience is 
that of embodied PERCEPTION, rather than pure con-
sciousness. Embodied percipience, he went on to say, 
does not precede the world but is a part of it. For when 
I perceive things and other people in my environment, 
Ido so by virtue ofthe cognitive capacities within my 
own BODY. Experience does not begin with a sensi-
ble manifold that stil! has to be interpreted, i.e., given 
a MEANING, by an essentially disembodied conscious-
ness. This manifold is already meaningful. 
For example, the moment we perceive anything at 
ali, we take it as something belonging to a milieu or 
a field, as something we can look at from a different 
perspective oras something with which we can do this 
or that. As the Gestalt psychologists had put it, it stands 
out as a figure against a background. And this back-
ground is in a sense known to the percipient, because 
it is that in which he or she can move about. In fact, 
the percipient is from the outset in that field: the back-
ground is that which can be explored by proceeding 
from his or her present point of view. The field, we 
might say, is the scope of the body's capacities with 
which the percipient from the very beginning of ex-
perience knows he or she is endowed, and which are 
ready to be exercised. And the exercise of a particular 
capacity on a given occasion -
e.g., an act of vis ual 
focusing on a particular object- does not wait for a 
deliberate decision, but is rather a response elicited by 
what comes to us out ofthat field. In slightly different 
terms, an appearance is taken to be the appearance of a 
specific object because of its place in the body's field. 
In fact, the appearance is not at ali given prior to that 
interpretation, as if the latter were a conceptualization 
of it, or an act of inference based on the appearance. 
The perceptual act goes straight to the object itself, so 
that we cannot say, as has often been said, that we begin 
our experience with appearances. 
This notion offield is clearly similar to the notion of 
structure that he used in La structure, except that it is 
viewed phenomenologically. In both cases, it amounts 
to a framework that embraces both perceptions and 
their objects but that is not itself either a perceptual 
awareness or an object. Its role is cognitive in that it 
guides the perceptions to their objects and in doing so 
it overcomes the so-called subject-object dichotomy. 
Thus we see that Merleau-Ponty understands the 
body as itself "cognitive." lts perceptions and capaci-
ties open up the world and enable us to move around 
in it with confidence. But such a view of the body-
which had also been advocated by GABRIEL MARCEL, 
whose work was familiar to Merleau-Ponty-made it 
necessary for him to argue at great length against the 
view according to which it is simply an object ofphys-
iology and anatomy. He tried to justify his position by 
citing a wealth of detail from contemporary psychology 
and physiology, particularly in their medical applica-
tion to patients. The body, to be sure, can be made into 
an object and we can have knowledge ofthat objectifi-
cation, but at the primordial level of our experience it 
is not an object but a subject, a body-subject. Even to 
caii the body an instrument is inadequate, because that 
would suppose that we can somehow discern the user 
apart from the instrument used. Such a formulation 
would suggest, for example, that a user would be able 
to examine the instrument before actually using it. In 
Merleau-Ponty's view, however, my body is essential 
to my very being. Whatever objective knowledge there 
may be, including that of the body, it can be acquired 
only by using the body's perceptual capacities, i.e., by 
proceeding from the world it opens up. 
Within the pages of the Phenomenologie one finds 
agreat many analyses ofthe various modalities of our 
experience of the body, executed in astounding detail 
and with critica! discussion of existing literature. Not 
only visual perception but also the SPACE and motility 
ofthe body are discussed. An entire chapter is devoted 

MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY 
459 
to the body as sexuality, including an important dis-
cussion of PSYCHOANALYSIS. Another topic is that of 
LANGUAGE -
the body as expressing itself in linguis-
tic and other gestures, a topic to which Merleau-Ponty 
frequently returned in his !ater work. Other analyses 
are directed more at the way the world appears to us 
by virtue of our bodily access to it, for example, the 
characteristics that distinguish its oriented space from 
that of pure geometry. Our experience of other people 
in INTERSUBJECTIVITY is also discussed, for the world 
appears to us as a world shared by different persons. 
In fact, as Merleau-Ponty, following MAX SCHELER, ar-
gues, the most primordiallevel of embodied existence 
is general and pre-personal, rather than articulated as 
mine over against yours. Private individuals, and the 
always present possibility of disagreements and con-
fticts between them, exist only on the basis of an un-
derlying co-existence. Needless to say, we do not find 
in Merleau-Ponty a sympathetic treatment ofthe tradi-
tional problem of other minds. 
As noted, embodied perception is in his view the 
most primordial form of experience. So he also resists 
the tendency of"intellectualism" to go further and ex-
plain this "cognitive" character of the body by refer-
ence to supposedly more original intellectual functions. 
Phenomenology can only describe the body's knowl-
edge for what it is, namely access to the world. It can-
not offer explanations that would make us understand 
it from a more ultimate point ofview, for example, that 
of a universal, all-surveying, disembodied conscious-
ness, as he believed Kant and Husserl had held. He 
remarked in criticism of the latter that the possibil-
ity of phenomenological EPOCHE AND REDUCTION ends 
here, at the lifeworld. We can give a critique of NATURAL 
SCIENCE by explaining the origins of scientific abstrac-
tions, objectifications, and conceptualizations out of 
the lifeworld of embodied perception, but the body's 
cognitive achievements are "hidden" from us in the 
sense that they cannot be derived from earlier beliefs. 
They give us a world that is real and true, but do this 
in a way that we ourselves cannot understand. We are 
in the world as a matter offact, not by virtue ofbeliefs 
we hold. 
The doctrine ofthe body-subject must be counted as 
Merleau-Ponty's most original contribution to pheno-
menology. Although it draws on Husserl's then un-
published Ideen zu einer reinen Phdnomenologie 
und phdnomenologischen Philosophie II [1912-15), 
it amounts to a very important reinterpretation of that 
phi1osopher. The latter's methodological concept of 
reduction, while not completely rejected, has on1y a 
limited validity. Even if phenomenology is synony-
mous with philosophy, such a philosophy's claim to 
be able to eliminate all presuppositions, to be a rigor-
ous science, is dropped. For ifthe body-subject is rock 
bottom, it is certainly not a point of view having no 
presuppositions. 
Although the Phimomimologie was to remain the 
author's principal work, he applied the doctrine ofthe 
body-subject to topics other than perception in the re-
stricted sense. For example, he contributed to a pheno-
menological AESTHETICS by writing severa! important 
articles as well as a small book, L 'cei! et l 'esprit ( 1961 ), 
on the art ofpainting. Paul Cezanne, he argued, did not 
want to imi tate nature, as realistic art had done, but he 
wanted to give expression to nature as it shows itself 
to the body-subject. 
The phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty is some-
times distinguished from Husserl 's constitutive pheno-
menology by calling it EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY. 
The reason for this designation is in part the empha-
sis on embodiment as an ultimate fact. And embodied 
perception expresses the actually existent in its full 
concreteness, in a richness of detail never captured by 
words or concepts. Merleau-Ponty also stressed, some-
what as had been done in EXISTENTIALISM, that each of 
us is in the world (au monde) as an individual existence. 
Now phenomenology cannot but use general concepts, 
thus giving the impression of describing what Husserl 
called essences, e.g., the essence ofbeing human. But 
according to Merleau-Ponty, we should not overlook 
the fact that beneath or behind an essence, such as we 
capture with a general concept, there exists the finite, 
flesh-and-blood individual person, whose own being is 
particular and unique, not that of an object of knowl-
edge. 
From the emphasis so far given to the doctrine ofthe 
body-subject one should not conci ude that his descrip-
tion of it comprises his entire philosophy. Merleau-
Ponty clearly recognizes that human experience is not 
coextensive with our bodily commerce with the world. 
The Phenomenologie therefore contains agreat deal of 
other material. He discusses such traditional philosoph-
ical themes as knowledge, HISTORY, TIME, and freedom. 

460 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
With respect to this last topic, he particularly criticizes 
Sartre's doctrine. He even provides an outline of an on-
tology. There is also a wealth of critica! discussions of 
historical figures in philosophy. And last but not least, 
he explores the question ofthe nature ofphilosophical 
refiection. 
After the publication of his main work, Merleau-
Ponty published a great many articles on a variety of 
topics, for the most part collected in two volumes, Sens 
et non-sens (1948) and Signes (1960). He also pub-
lished two books on POLITIC AL PHILOSOPHY, Humanisme 
et terreur ( 194 7) and Les aventures de la dialectique 
( 1955). Both are discussions of Marxist thought, for 
which he, like Sartre, had great sympathy, based es-
pecially on the then recently discovered manuscripts 
of 1844. The terror and repression of the Communist 
regime in Moscow, however, presented great problems 
to his humanist mind. It was an issue that his attach-
ment to MARXISM made it difficult for him to resolve, 
but he did eventually break with Communism, a deci-
sion that led to a public break between himself and his 
friend of many years, Sartre. 
During the sixteen years following the publication 
ofhis Phenomimologie, he worked on a book that was 
to be a follow-up to it, but it remained incomplete. 
The manuscript on which he was actively working at 
the time of his death was posthumously published un-
der the ti tie Le visible et l 'invisible ( 1964). Because 
the text is not only incomplete but extremely difficult, 
interpretations of it must be tentative. This text is pri-
marily concerned with what he intended to be a new 
ontology. Severa! interpreters hold that it implies a far-
reaching critique, perhaps even an outright repudiation, 
of the earlier work. But is can also be argued that Le 
visible et l 'invisible is intended as a formulation of the 
most basic ontologica! assumptions of his phenomen-
ological analyses, a task he had already begun in the 
Phenomenologie. 
In the earlier book Merleau-Ponty argued, as dis-
cussed, that the body-subject is "cognitive" in the sense 
that it opens up a world that the percipient sponta-
neously and without hesitation or doubt considers real. 
By virtue of its existence in a field, embodied percep-
ti an reaches out beyond the appearances toward the 
object as it really is. But he did not think that this cog-
nitive achievement ofsense perception could be further 
explained, for instance, by trying to penetra te to a pure, 
transcendental consciousness, as Kant and Husserl had 
suggested. Merleau-Ponty rejected this as intellectual-
ism or idealism, but neither was he inclined to accept 
the doctrine of being of classical realism. He wanted 
an ontology that would confirm his phenomenology of 
perceptual knowledge. 
As he had also stipulated in the Phenomenologie, 
ontology must itselfbe phenomenological, i.e., an elu-
cidation ofthe sense ofreality already pre-reftectively 
envisaged by the percipient. In Le visible et l 'invisible 
he propounds the thesis that being is fiesh. To under-
stand this we have to recall that embodied percipience 
owes cognitive success to its field-character. A per-
ceptual act reaches a reality "beyond appearances" by 
virtue ofthe fact that the latter occupies a place in the 
same field in which the percipient moves, a field that 
is ultimately temporal rather than spatial. In Le visible 
et l 'invisible, Merleau-Ponty goes further and suggests 
that being a perceiver and being an abject of percep-
tion are reversible roles within that field. He saw such 
a reversibility illustrated by the fact that a hand touch-
ing something in its milieu can itselfbe touched by the 
percipient's other hand. And he took this tobe a bodily 
analogue of reftection, the body refiecting on itself and 
revealing it tobe both subject and object. One and the 
same thing appears as both perceiving and perceived. 
The two ro les are different, but being as flesh is neutra! 
with respect to both, though it exists only as the unity in 
the subject-object differentiation found in experience. 
The unity ofbeing here designated as flesh would seem 
to be very similar to what surfaced in earlier works as 
the unity of a field. 
Traditional epistemology often saw the body as an 
obstacle to knowledge, taking it to be one of the pri-
mary sources ofthe subjectivity and relativity that ha ve 
to be overcome to obtain knowledge of the things 
in themselves. Wanting to rehabilitate the sensible, 
Merleau-Ponty clearly wanted to detine being, not as 
correlative with some higher-level power of thought, 
but in a way consonant with the body's role in percep-
tion. And he tried to do this by his ontology ofthe ftesh. 
For this implies a positive evaluation ofthose features 
of the body that had traditionally been held to be ob-
stacles. Although a perception always envisages things 
from a place in a field- which is in the last analysis a 
place intime- it does nevertheless perceive the mat-
ters themselves in their very being, because their being 

MODERN PHILOSOPHY 
461 
consists precise1y in being so accessible, i.e., their field-
character. As he put it in Le visible et l'invisible, what 
had been construed as an obstacle between a percipient 
and the abject, "the thickness of the flesh," is exactly 
what the latter 's visibility consists of. In short, this new 
ontology has tumed the obstacle into a gateway to the 
being ofthings.

MODERN PHILOSOPHY 
HENRY PIETERSMA

One way to un-
derstand the phenomenological method of EDMUND 
HUSSERL is to see it in the context of the history of 
philosophy, to consider it, for example, in relation to 
classical modem philosophy, particularly Descartes, 
Leibniz, Hume, and KANT. 
Husserl 's phenomenology has deep ties to the Carte-
si an tradition. One ofhis !ater works was, in fact, a radi-
cal reworkingofDescartes's view and was titled Carte-
sianische Meditationen [ 1931]. Husserl agreed with 
Descartes on a number of key points. Both believed

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
that philosophy can and should be built on a founda-
tion of certainty. Related to this, they were committed 
to the accessibility of a class of self-evident ("clear and 
distinct") truths. Foremost among these is the cogito 
("I am thinking"). And for both philosophers the no-
tion of"thinking" was tobe understood in a very broad 
sense. As Descartes put it, I am a "thing that doubts, 
understands, affirms, denies, is willing, is unwilling, 
and also imagines and has sensory perceptions." This 
cogito was to be the foundation for ali knowledge, 
including the sciences. In turn, this meant that knowl-
edge was to ha ve its grounding in subjectivity- I am 
thinking. 
But Husserl also disagreed with Descartes on sev-
era! crucial issues. Unlike Descartes, he was not willing 
simply to add to the bare cogito the notion of a mental 
substance that was do ing the thinking. On Husserl 's 
view, if one really looked for absolutely certain foun-
dations for knowledge, one had tobe extremely careful 
not to smuggle into the cogito any naive assumptions 
arising from a substance metaphysics. On the same 
grounds Husserl was unwilling to assume at the out-
set the validity of causal laws. Descartes had used 
these laws in his proofs for the existence of God, and 
thereby the externa! world. But for Husserl such laws, 
along with substance metaphysics, remained assump-
tions that were far from self-evident truths. In addi-
tion, Husserl rejected the use ofDescartes's deductive 
method, claiming that LOGIC, like MATHEMATICS, was a 
special science in need ofphilosophical grounding and 
could not be circularly employed in that task. 
Rather than simply assuming the validity of the 
method of logic and mathematics, Husserl argued that 
a genuine "first philosophy" must proceed by an un-
mediated intuition of self-evident truths. His pheno-
menological method therefore involved the careful de-
scription ofthe intuited data that presented themselves 
clearly and distinctly to reflection. His appeal to in-
tuition is not meant to invoke some unusual state of 
consciousness. He sees intuition on the model of PER-
CEPTION -
the direct awareness of something present 
to consciousness. The elements that present themselves 
in intuition will provide the truths on which pheno-
menology will build. Descartes 's notions of substance, 
causality, etc., may surface again at a !ater stage of 
investigation, but then they should be understood as 
MEANINGs that can be given on the hasis of EVIDENCE 
that is weaker than the self-evidence required at the 
start of philosophical inquiry. 
Husserl thus trimmed the Cartesian cogito to those 
elements that he took to be self-evident. But then he 
added one element that, he argued, appeared to be as 
self-evident as the original cogito. It was nothing that 
Descartes had denied, it was simply an element on 
which Descartes had failed to capitalize: namely, if I 
am certain that I am thinking, Husserl argued, I am 
equally certain that I am thinking about something. 
This "something" is the experienced object. The ob-
vious problem, of course, is that the things I think 
about do not always exist. I can imagine a unicorn or 
believe in Santa Claus, and my mere thinking about 
them does not bestow existence on them. So the cogito 
does not, by itself, give one warranted certainty about 
the existential status of the things one thinks about. 
Nonetheless, ifthere is tobe any access to reality, it is 
here in the objects-thought-about that this reality will 
appear. 
This emphasis on the fact that thinking is directed 
toward some sort of object, real or fictional, Husserl 
calls the INTENTIONALITY of consciousness, following 
FRANZ BRENTANO, with whom he had studied. Brentano 
had argued that one can distinguish between physical 
and psychological phenomena on the grounds that only 
the latter has an intentiona! structure. That is to say, 
only psychological states ha ve "reference to a content 
... directedness toward an abject." Physical objects, on 
the other hand, do not have this characteristic. Unlike 
Brentano, however, Husserl does not use intentional-
ity as a means of making the traditional metaphysical 
distinction between the mental and the physical. He 
explores intentionality only as an essential structure of 
conscious experience. Ali metaphysical claims must 
ha ve their grounding in this experience. 
One other profound difference between Descartes 
and Husserllies in their understanding of science. For 
Descartes, the NATURAL sciENCEs dealt with a transcen-
dent reality whose existence required proof. Transcen-
dent reality lay on the far side of an epistemological 
chasm. The existence of a subject could be known 
clearly and distinctly; the existence of the physical 
world, by contrast, was knowable only through fallible 
sensory experience that provided only mental represen-
tations ofphysical reality. One needed a philosophical 
"bridge" to guarantee the veracity of our ideas of the 

MODERN PHILOSOPHY 
463 
physical world. Descartes built that bridge by appeal-
ing to the existence of a nondeceiving God. 
Husserl, on the other hand, refused at the outset to 
accept any epistemological gulf between conscious-
ness and its experienced objects. The notion of tran-
scendent reality, he argued, needed fresh understand-
ing. The obj ects that appear in experience carry varying 
degrees of evidence regarding their existential status. 
On the basis ofthe evidence that they carry with them, 
consciousness assigns to them their most likely exis-
tential status. One crucial piece of evidence for tran-
scendence is that the object appears only partially. lts 
temporal and spatial aspects never appear in their en-
tirety. Such objects are assigned the meaning "transcen-
dent." Transcendence is no longer seen tobe on the far 
si de of an epistemological divide; rather, it is among 
the meanings assigned to some experienced objects. 
Husserl is not claiming, of course, that consciousness 
gives existence to physical reality. His concern is with 
the meaningthat o ne gives to some aspects of one's ex-
perience. "Transcendent" is one such meaning. Again, 
the issue is not metaphysics, it is experience. 
This fresh way of looking at transcendence carries 
with it a new understanding of science. The latter, 
Husserl argues, is not simply a description ofthe laws 
governing objective reality, as it appeared to be for 
Descartes. Husserl sees science as an intersubjectively 
constructed system of meanings, an interpretation of 
aspects ofthe experienced world. 
The difference between the two views can be seen 
quite clearly in their respective attitudes toward the 
"mathematization of nature." Descartes, like Galileo, 
attributed the secondary properties of objects (e.g., 
their color, taste, smell, etc.) to the mental or subjec-
tive side of experience. As such, these properties did 
not belong to physical nature. Primary qualities (e.g., 
shape, quantity, etc.), on the other hand, were taken 
to be genuine properties of physical objects. These 
properties lend themselves to mathematical (often ge-
ometrica!) treatment. So Descartes, following Galileo, 
believed that theories ofphysical objects, based exclu-
sively on their primary qualities, could be constructed 
on a mathematical basis. That is, he was committed to 
the mathematization of nature. 
For Husserl, the assumption that one could for-
mulate a mathematical science of nature without ex-
amining the relationship between mathematics and 
subjectivity was an example of the error he termed 
"objectivism." Objectivist theories simply assumed 
knowledge ofthe physical world (in this case, knowl-
edge of its mathematical properties) without any ref-
erence to the role played by conscious experience 
in ali knowledge claims. Husserl, in Die Krisis der 
europăischen Wissenscha:fien und die transzendentale 
Phănomenologie (1936), argues at length that by fol-
lowing in the footsteps ofthinkers such as Galileo and 
Descartes, modern philosophy has lost sight of the real 
origin ofmathematical and geometrica! insights. He ar-
gues that even mathematical properties must be under-
stood within the framework of conscious experience. 
Beginning with ordinary, imprecise experiences, tran-
scendental subjectivity gradually and through a process 
of idealization constitutes the "li mit forms" of mathe-
matical properties. The views ofGalileo and Descartes, 
bypassing the constitutive function of consciousness, 
suffer from "objectivism." 
Acknowledging that ali he has is his cogito- i.e., 
acts of consciousness- and the objects of conscious-
ness, which may or may not actually exist (and also 
the EGO, which can be omitted here), Husserl intro-
duces his phenomeno)ogicaJ EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION. 
This reduction is in the spirit of Descartes 's methodic 
doubt. The motivation for it is the beliefthat one cannot 
merely make assumptions about the existential status 
of experienced objects; one needs clear evidence to 
support such claims. To highlight the dubitability of 
our judgments about the existential status of objects, 
Descartes had appealed to the possibility of doubt; with 
his reduction, Husserl appeals to neutrality. The pheno-
menological reduction is a maneuver intended to put 
aside any unexamined assumptions about the existen-
tial sta tus of objects that appear in experience. 
One might wonder what has happened to the "com-
monsense" view of the world in ali this. On Husserl 's 
view, most of our commonsense beliefs, like most sci-
entific and philosophical beliefs, are infected with the 
fallacy of objectivism. In contrast, he argues that we 
are never in a position to know anything about mind-
independent objects alone. Whatever we know about 
them is always known in the context of our experience 
of them. A naive acceptance of commonsense beliefs 
about our knowledge of the physical world has been, 
he claims, the source of agreat many of philosophy's 
missteps. 

464 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Husserl 's insistence on the ineliminable connection 
between subject and object in experience led him to 
describe the subject, the ego, as a "monad." His debt to 
Leibniz is explicit here, but he is also quick to point out 
that his notion of the monad is not metaphysical. He 
identifies it, not with substance, but with what he calls 
the "concrete ego." The concrete ego includes ali its in-
tentionat acts and objects. This Husserlian monad is the 
full field of actual and potential conscious experience. 
Given this characterization, one can see the analogy 
with the Leibnizian monad- both are self-contained, 
neither has need of a "window" to something outside it-
self. The Leibnizian monad mirrors the whole uni verse; 
the Husserlian version encompasses a whole universe 
in virtue of its inclusion of ali actual and possible ex-
periences. As Husserl put it, the phenomenology of 
the monadic ego coincides with phenomenology as a 
whole. 
One question that faces any account of subjectivity 
as a monad without windows is that it appears to end in 
solipsism. But Husserl, with his claim that the monadic 
ego includes ali actual and possible experience, argues 
that the notion of any being (ego or otherwise) lying 
outside that scope is nonsense. The issue, then, is to 
uncover within the field of experience evidence for 
the real existence of other egos. This Husserl attempts 
to do with his account of empathy, particularly in the 
fifth of his Cartesianische Meditationen; in fact, in 
research manuscripts ofthe early 1920s, he announces 
that monads do indeed have windows, and that these 
"windows" are precisely the experiences of empathy 
through which we are open to others. 
Husserl 's first debt to Descartes is his insistence 
on grounding philosophy in the absolute certainty of 
the cogito, but his supplement to Descartes, his adding 
of the intended object to the act of thinking, brings 
him not only to Leibniz but also to a vers ion of KANT: 
subject and object become inextricably linked. Husserl 
preserves the most general aspect of the Kantian tra-
dition in that he insists on giving serious considera-
tion to the contributions of both subject and object in 
experience. For him, as for Kant, any effort to under-
stand objects requires that one take into consideration 
the subjective state in which they are experienced. On 
Husserl 's view, understanding what the subjective state 
is will shed light on the possible existential status of 
its object. So, for example, if I ha ve evidence that the 
subjective state I am in is imagining, then I have evi-
dence that the object I am experiencing is probably not 
actual. Reciprocally, if I have evidence that the object 
of my awareness does not exist, then I ha ve evidence 
that I am probably imagining rather than perceiving. 
Husserl is not naive about the degree of certainty that 
one can have about the existential status ofthe objects 
of one's experience. Like every other philosopher who 
takes our fallibility seriously, he believes that we can 
achieve varying degrees of probability about whether 
the experienced object is actual or fictional. What he 
offers are explicit indications about how to look for 
relevant evidence. 
Husserl was just enough of a Kantian to insist that 
perceptual experience (an important basis for natu-
ral science) is not purely receptive. As he puts it in 
Formale und transzendentale Logik (1929), "nothing 
exists for me otherwise than by virtue of the actual 
and potential performance of my own consciousness." 
One always has only experienced objects, and that 
means for him that one always has only interpreted 
objects, meaningful objects. Phenomenology becomes 
the philosophical investigation of meanings. 
But in highlighting his debt to Kant it is important to 
point out that Husserl was not simply a Kantian. In one 
important departure from Kant, Husserl was committed 
to pre-predicative, as well as predicative, experience. 
In addition, while Kant inferred transcendental subjec-
tivity from the objects he believed were structured by 
it, Husserl claimed that the transcendental ego could 
be observed in its structuring role through reflection. 
Most importantly, he denied Kant's distinction between 
phenomena and noumena. While phenomena include 
fictional objects ofvarious sorts, for Husserl they also 
include aspects of reality. Those aspects are always 
partial, but they are nonetheless aspects of reality. 
The issue for Husserl was not between realism and 
metaphysical idealism. His phenomenology was in-
tended as a third alternative that simply bypassed that 
traditional quarrel. Both naive realism and metaphysi-
cal idealism were, he thought, misconceived. Each, in 
a sense, emphasized o ne aspect of experience to the ex-
clusion ofthe other. Thus realism claimed access to an 
objective, uninterpreted world, while idealism reduced 
the world to the subjective, to utter mind-dependency. 
For Husserl, the truth lay somewhere between these 
two extremes. He indeed accepted the existence of a 

MODERN PHILOSOPHY 
465 
world that was not the product of the mind, but he 
argued that access to that world would always be con-
ditioned by the consciousness that experienced it. Any 
science that we construct, as well as any metaphysics, 
must always understand itself as an interpretation of 
reality by conscious subjects ~ 
neither a simple mir-
roring nor a pure construction ofthat reality. 
Husserl 's claims about the importance of recogniz-
ing the ro le ofsubjectivity and interpretation in experi-
ence might suggest that he was advocating a view about 
the theory-ladenness of observation. But that is not the 
case. N orwood Russell Hanson ( 1924--196 7) argues in 
Patterns of Discovery (1958) that one's observations 
are shaped by what one knows, by one 's background in-
formation. Husserl 's claims are more fundamental than 
that, focusing as they do on structures that are univer-
sally shared by ali subj ects, rather than on the particular 
background knowledge of individual observers. So, for 
example, in the case ofphysical objects, he argues that 
ali perceivers will experience them partially, they will 
experience temporal and spatial "perspectives" (i.e., 
partial aspects of the objects ), but never the entire ob-
jects themselves. Husserl highlights these sorts of uni-
versal structures goveming experience, to indicate one 
essential portion ofthe subjective conditions that shape 
our experience. 
The early phase in Husserl 's philosophy carne tobe 
known as his "static" phenomenology because it paid 
so little attention to developmental aspects of knowl-
edge. One might expect that a more developmental 
framework for his theory of knowledge would bring 
Husserl closer to Hanson 's view. And in one small 
way it does. In !ater years, especially in Formale und 
transzendentale Logik and his Cartesianische Medita-
tionen, Husserl spells out a GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY, 
one that pays attention to the development (the "sed-
imentation") of meanings in experience. But even in 
its genetic phase, with its emphasis on development in 
knowledge structures, Husserl 's phenomenology does 
not concern itself primarily with the ro le of individual 
differences in background knowledge. Rather, he fo-
cuses on the laws that govern what types of experiences 
must precede other types, and on the laws that govern 
the development ofhabitual or dispositional states. The 
emphasis continues to be on essential structures gov-
erning any consciousness; the difference between the 
static and genetic accounts is that the latter takes se-
riously the temporal relations among those types of 
structures. From the early phase through the !ater one, 
this much of Kant remains: the focus is on a priori 
structures of experience, not on empirica! differences 
among subjects. 
How does one put together a Cartesian quest for cer-
tainty and a Kantian insistence on the pervasive ro le of 
subjectivity in experience? This is where Husserl re-
vises a bit ofDavid Hume. Husserl was as committed as 
Hume to the necessity of grounding o ne 's philosophical 
claims in experience. But he was strenuously opposed 
to Hume's skepticism. His remedy was to argue that if 
one looks closely at experience, one will discover that 
it is not filled with random bits of data ("impressions" 
or "ideas") that somehow gravitate toward one another 
by associative mechanisms. Rather, on closer investi-
galion one discovers that experience is filled with es-
sentially distinct types ofthings. And these types, their 
characteristics, and the relations among them, are law-
governed and predictable. Even Hume's claim about 
the distinction between "impressions" and "ideas" is 
based on a recognition oftwo different types of expe-
rience. On Husserl's view there are many more than 
two types, but Hume's acknowledgment of the two is 
enough to give Husserl his opening. 
Husserl 's view can be elaborated in the following 
way: if I can distinguish between impressions and 
ideas, I do so on the basis of certain qualities of the 
two (vividness, etc.). Once that distinction is made, 
I can go on to distinguish among the kinds of psy-
chological states in which those objects appear. If the 
abject appears vivid, etc., I take myselfto be perceiv-
ing, ifit is faded, etc., I take myselfto be remembering 
or imagining. In other words, there are law-governed 
relationships between the types of objects I experi-
ence and the types of psychological states in which I 
experience them. Framed in Humean language, when 
I take myself to be experiencing an impression, that 
counts as some evidence that I am perceiving. When 
I take myself to be experiencing an idea, that counts 
as some evidence that I am remembering or imagin-
ing. So the correlations between the characteristics of 
the data and the type of experience one takes oneself 
to be having are not random; they are law-governed 
and predictable. This is the sort of Humean assump-
tion that Husserl makes explicit and capitalizes on. As 
he did with Descartes, so Husserl does with Hume ~ 

466 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
he ferrets out an unexploited assumption and puts it to 
use. 
The recognition of these types and their law-
governed relationships is what Husserl calls the "in-
tuition of essences" or EIDETIC METHOD. Recall that by 
"intuition" he merely means the seeing of something, 
even partially, as it is. And it is this capacity to see, 
to intuit, law-governed types in experience that, on 
Husserl 's view, disarms skepticism. It is true that 1 
never have certainty about the existential status ofthe 
object. 1 can, after ali, take an object to be physical 
when it is a hallucination. Any philosophyneeds to rec-
ognize this possibility. Nonetheless, 1 can have some 
degree of certainty about the types of experiences that 
I have, about the types of objects that appear in them, 
and about the laws that govern the two. 
Notice an important distinction here. The certainty 
that Husserl claims for us is not certainty that 1 am, for 
example, now perceiving. Rather, it is certainty about 
what would have to be the case if 1 were perceiving. 
When 1 take myself to be perceiving a chair, 1 do so 
because I believe (perhaps mistakenly) that a particular 
set of conditions has been met. For example, 1 believe 
that if 1 were to walk around the object it would con-
tinue to appear as a three-dimensional object, that if 1 
were to see it at a !ater time it would still appear as a 
chair, etc. That is, my experience (notjust objects pure 
and simple) forms a structured set of law-governed 
types. To that extent, one is capable of some degree 
ofknowledge about experience. One may misread the 
data, but o ne sti li has some knowledge ofwhat the rules 
are that govern the proper assignment of meaning to 
both acts and objects in experience. 
This is where the Cartesian quest for certainty and 
the Kantian commitment to the pervasiveness of sub-
jective interpretation come together. By carefully ex-
amining experience, one can discover with some de-
gree of certainty the laws that govern the subjective 
assignments ofmeaning. But Husserl also believes that 
one can assume with some degree of certainty that ev-
ery possible consciousness is governed by the same 
set of laws. His claims about the essential structures 
of conscious experience are not, then, empirica! claims 
about human psychology. They cover every conceiv-
able type of thinking being, from gods and animals to 
humans. So for Husserl, an insistence on the role of 
subjective interpretation does not entail simple subjec-
tivism or even species-relativism. Absolutely univer-
sal, a priori laws are supposed to be at work. 
One further point can be made regarding Husserl 's 
emendations on Hume. For Hume, our perceptual ex-
perience is limited to awareness of purely subjective 
impressions. In this he presses the Cartesian subjective 
starting point to its limits: we are not, on his view, in 
a position to know that our mental contents are caused 
by or are semblances of a mind-independent world. 
Conscious experience, for him, seems to be denied any 
basis for knowledge of an externa! physical world. 
Husserl, by contrast, characterizes consciousness as 
intentionality. It is not a "container" of ideas or im-
pressions; it is directedness toward things. Objects and 
events in the physical world are among the objects to-
ward which it is directed. As he did with Descartes, 
so here too Husserl rejects the gulfthat is supposed to 
separate consciousness and its surrounding world. 
Husserl 's phenomenology, then, has a Cartesian 
starting point in what he takes to be the absolute cer-
tainty ofthe cogito. He pares down the cogito to elim-
inate any appeal to substance, causality, or deduction, 
and expands the act, cogito, to include an intentiona! 
object. The intentiona! (act-object) structure of experi-
ence is taken tobe law-governed in the types ofmean-
ings that are assigned to acts and to their correlated 
objects. And ali ofthis is taken to entail the view that 
objects alone are never available to philosophical theo-
rizing; they can only be treated as experienced objects, 
objects that ha ve been gi ven meaning of some sort. The 
existential status of these experienced objects cannot 
be assumed at the outset; one applies the "phenomen-
ological reduction" and then looks for evidence in the 
characteristics of the phenomena that will point, with 
some degree of probability, to their existential sta tus, 
to their possible transcendence. Husserl acknowledges 
the possibility of subjective error but argues that con-
scious subjects are the source not only ofpossible error, 
but also of ali meaning. 
Later phenomenologists -
including MARTIN HEI-
DEGGER, MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, SIMONE DE BEAUYOIR, 
and JEAN-PAUL SARTRE -
leveled further objections 
against modern philosophy. Among the most inftuen-
tial objections was the claim that philosophy ought 
not have its starting point in a purely subjective, and 
exclusively cognitive, state. These !ater phenomenolo-
gists also argued that modern philosophy had underes-

MUSIC 
timated the importance ofthe BODY, and ofthe relation 
between LANGUAGE and thought. The human person, 
they argued, had been understood narrowly, as a spec-
tator of its world rather than as a free and active player. 
This in turn minimized the significance ofboth choice 
and ACT ION. Some ofthese criticisms, of course, applied 
to Husserl's phenomenology as well as to his forebears 
in modern philosophy.

MUSIC 
One ofthe many links between pheno-
menology and music is already implied in EDMUND 
HUSSERL 's dedication of his Logische Untersuchungen 
( 1900-1901) to Cari Stumpf ( 1848-1936), whose con-
cept of Verschmelzung (fusion)- developed to de-
scribe the way a musical consonance (e.g., the interval 
of a fifth) is already perceived as a consonance without 
our having to perform an active synthesis of separate 
sounds- is appropriated and extended by Husserl, no-
tably in Analysen zur passiven Synthesis [ 1918-26]. Of 
more importance for a phenomenology of music, how-
ever, are the many examp1es of tone and melody in 
Husserl 's discussions ofTIME and MEMORY in Vorlesun-
gen zur Phiinomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins 
[1905]. 
When we perceive a melody, the tone we are hearing 
now has a double temporal "halo," horizon, or "frînge" 
that Husserl describes with the terms "retention" and 
"protention" : the just-past tone is "retained" in con-
sciousness (not as a literally still sounding echo, but 
as the still present sense of something havingjust hap-
pened), while the immediate further unfolding of the 
melody is "protended" more or less indeterminately. 
As the melody progresses toward completion in musi-
cal time, its opening tones recede further into the past, 
yet are still retained, precisely as earlier moments of 
the same melody and as contributing to its unfolding 
sense. In this way, the melody's sounds and silences 
are not successive events in flat chronological time, 
but have a characteristic temporal density, with each 
tone simultaneously directed toward the emerging next 
tone and bearing, as it were, a comet's tai! ofprevious 
phases. Thus the whole melody, rather than individ-
ual sounds, is constituted as a single coherent temporal 
process. Even a single enduring tone is a reticulation of 
retentions and protentions knitting each "now" -phase 
into the continuous sounding ofthe tone as a whole. 
Similarly, during any "now" instant in a larger mu-
sical work, past stretches ofthe piece are retained while 
future developments are protended: what is sounding 
at any moment is sustained by a temporal depth em-
bracing all that has come before, even as further pos-
sibilities are ongoingly indicated and fulfilled, disap-
pointed, or modified as the piece proceeds. Thus a 
unitary consciousness of a complex musical whole is 
built up step by step, growing richer in content until

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the piece finally comes to completion. Then it is this 
temporally extended unity itself that recedes into the 
past, eventually moving out ofthe immediate,just-past 
horizon of retention into a more distant past reached 
only by recollection, which in turn can re-play, for 
example, the melody heard yesterday -
generating 
"the same" melody, step by step, anew. Moreover, as 
Husserl points out in Formale und transzendentale 
Logik ( 1929), a work such as Beethoven's Kreutzer 
Sonata is itself an ideal unity irreducible to its per-
formance on this or that occasion. Hence Husserl 's 
account deals not only with the constitution of tempo-
ral unity- be it that of a tone, a melody, or an entire 
piece- but also with the identity and repeatability of 
musical works. 
No systematic account is yet available of occasional 
early work in phenomenology of music. This would 
include, for example, "Versuch einer Phănomenologie 
der Musik" (1922-23) and "Zur Phănomenologie der 
Musik" ( 1925), by musicologist and joumalist Hans 
Mersmann (1891-1971), and "Zur Phănomenologie 
der Musik" ( 1926), by composer, theorist, and critic 
Herbert Eimert (1897-1972). In what sense and to 
what extent these and similar works from this pe-
riod are phenomenological nevertheless remains to 
be determined. In some cases, the term simply con-
notes a general rejection of PSYCHOLOGISM in AESTHET-
Ics, coupled in some authors with an investigation 
of fundamental elements pertaining to the appearance 
of the musical work of art -
an emphasis that re-
calls the object-oriented focus ofREALISTIC PHENOMEN-
OLOGY. That not ali early phenomenology of music 
follows this trend can, however, be seen in "Beitrăge 
zu einer Phănomenologie der Musik" ( 1931 ), by Gus-
tav Giildenstein ( 1888-1972), who had studied with 
Husserl in Freiburg in the early 1920s and whose The-
orie der Tonart (Theory of tonality, 1928) Husserl (to 
whom the work is dedicated) praised for its "genuinely 
phenomenological spirit." 
Mersmann and Eimert were not only among the first 
in the field ofmusic to turn to phenomenology, but were 
also advocates of new music; a similar conjunction is 
found in lntroduction a la musique de douze sons (In-
troduction to twelve-tone music, 1949), by Rene Lei-
bowitz ( 1913-1972 ), who explicitly refers to Husserl 's 
notion of phenomenological reduction in suggesting 
that the twelve-tone system of composition as it was 
developed by Arnold Schonberg (1874--1951), places 
the tona! system in brackets. 
Similar points are made about the atonal music 
of Anton Webern (1883-1945) by LUIGI ROGNONI in 
Fenomenologia delia musica radicale (1966; enl. ed. 
1974). Though Rognoni also cites such works as 
"Fenomenologia delia relazione e musica contempo-
ranea" (1960) and "Annotazioni per una fenomenolo-
gia delia musica" (1964) by ENZO PACI, he rei ies 
chiefty on Husserl 's Die Krisis der europiiischen Wis-
senschaflen und die transzendentale Phiinomenologie 
( 1936) in elucidating the emergence of a tona! and elec-
tronic music in the 20th century. On the other hand, 
in Les fondements de la musique dans la conscience 
humaine (The foundations of music in human con-
sciousness, 1961 ), the well-known conductor Ernst 
Ansermet (1883-1969) appeals to a Sartrean pheno-
menology of consciousness and existence in defending 
the supremacy of tona! music over any type of poly-
tonality, atonality, musique concrete, etc. It is never-
theless significant that whichever side phenomenology 
has been invoked in service of, musicians themselves 
have turned to phenomenology in grappling with is-
sues raised as the taken-for-granted structures of mu-
sical sense were being put in question by alternative 
musical styles based upon radically different presup-
positions. 
ROMAN INGARDEN's phenomenology of music (de-
veloped in the late 1920s and first published in Polish 
in 1933), however, takes standard "classical music" as 
its guiding example. He is concerned primarily with 
the problem ofthe musical work's ideal, "supratempo-
ral" identity, which governs yet transcends any given 
performance ofthe work. The work is also irreducible 
to its written score, since it is a complex formation 
of sounding tones and their qualities -
and not a se-
quence of printed signs- that is the intentiona! object 
ofthe musical experience per se. Yet the score assures 
the work's identity over historical time by embody-
ing it in a system of relatively determinate symbols 
-a set of instructions delimiting a "schema" that any 
competent performer can ftesh out in presenting a spe-
cific, spatiotemporally individuated performance "of' 
this enduring work. A similar concern for the work of 
music as an ideal object is found in ALFRED scHuTz's 
"Fragments on the Phenomenology ofMusic" [1944], 
which also addresses the constitution of the unity of 

MUSIC 
a musical theme in inner time-consciousness; the ro le 
of continuance, intermittence, and repetition; and the 
question ofthe "frame ofreference" the Iistener brings 
to the musical experience. In contrast, Schutz's essay 
on "Making Music Together: A Study in Social Re-
Iationship" ( 1951) focuses on the "mutual tuning-in 
relationship" that allows participants not only in music 
making, but in any form of social communication to 
experience themselves as a "We" insofar as they expe-
rience the unfolding of a complex temporal formation 
together. 
Despite the earlier studies mentioned, phenomen-
ology ofmusic did not begin to emerge as a distinct sub-
field within phenomenology un tii the 1960s and 1970s, 
Iargely due to the pioneering and dedicated efforts of 
phenomenologist and musicologist F. JOSEPH SMITH. His 
numerous works span more than three decades and 
carry into effect his commitment to shi ft and restructure 
the visual-spatial bias he detects in phenomenology as 
a whole. According to Smith, emphasis on the visual 
dimension of experience has worked to the detriment 
of a phenomenology of sound and music, and he ac-
cordingly calls for phenomenology to be enriched by 
an "akoumenology" that can do justice to sound -
including non-Westem and 20th century music -
in 
its own terms. Smith's explicit and pivotal movement 
away from visual metaphor and toward the Iived expe-
rience ofsound-as-such is a fundamental development 
in phenomenology of music, and is confirmed in de-
tailed parallel studies independently undertaken by DON 
IHDE in Listening and Voi ce ( 1976). Though some of 
Smith 's essays rest upon a Husserlian treatment of time 
and ofpassive synthesis, he also appeals to MARTIN HEI-
DEGGER's work, and is critica! ofany solely mentalistic 
approach or any sort of"subjective idealism." Instead, 
he calls for recognition of the intersubjective, bodily, 
and ontologica! dimensions of music, and suggests-
without working it out in detail- that music not only 
expresses a genuinely social consciousness, but can 
itself foster social participation. 
Interest in applying a phenomenological approach 
to issues in music continued to grow during the 1970s 
and 1 980s, as can be seen for instance, in a number 
of dissertations; many authors tend to favor Husserl's 
descriptive phenomenology, but others have tumed 
to the works of Heidegger and MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY, as well as SCHUTZ, MIKEL DUFRENNE, INGAR-
469 
DEN, PAUL RICCEUR, and HANS-GEORG GADAMER. One key 
book from this period- Music as Heard (1983), by 
THOMAS CLIFTON- rests Iargely but not exclusively on 
Husserl 's phenomenology. Clifton identifies four in-
variant constituents ofmusical experience: time, space, 
play, and feeling. His discussion ofmusical TIME, which 
rests on Husserl's descriptions, discloses such struc-
tures as beginning, ending, continuity, contrast, inter-
ruption, and various simultaneous time "strata"; his 
treatment of musical SPACE Iocates such features as 
musical line, surface, and depth, including, e.g., ex-
periences of sounds penetrating, overlapping, or in-
tersecting. Play in music is examined in terms of rit-
ual, heuristic behavior, agonie e1ements, etc., and feei-
ing is approached in terms of a fundamental relation-
ship of mutual "possession" between music-as-heard 
and the bodily-kinaesthetic, receptive-participative self 
who experientially appropriates and Iives through its 
movement. Indeed, for Clifton, tonality itself is a "cor-
poreal acquisition," a habit ofthe Iived BODY. 
LAWRENCE FERRARA 's Philosophy and the Anafysis 
of Music (1991) provides a methodological synthesis 
of phenomenological and hermeneutica! approaches 
with conventional techniques in music analysis in or-
der to produce an integrative account of musical expe-
rience. Unlike Ingarden- for whom music is a single-
Iayered art, in contrast to the multilayered structure of 
works of LITERATURE -
Ferrara demarcates at Ieast 
six strata of musical significance: historical context; 
formal structure or syntax; sound-in-time; represen-
tation; virtual feeling, understood as in the work of 
Susanne K. Langer (1895-1985); and onto-historical 
world. His "eclectic" methodology enables music an-
alysts not only to engage each ofthese strata individu-
ally within any given work, but also to respond to their 
polyphonic interplay and to provide concrete sugges-
tions for performers. In this approach -
which has 
been successfully applied in a number of dissertations, 
as well as in Ferrara's own publications-Husserlian 
phenomenological techniques are used for the descrip-
tion of sound-in-time; conventional formalist methods 
( e.g., harmonic analysis, analysis of thematic and in-
tervallic relations, etc.) are used to analyze musical 
syntax; and approaches informed by the hermeneu-
tics of Heidegger, Gadamer, and Ricceur provide a 
means for the "interpretation" of musical reference. 
But through what Ferrara calls "bridging," the inter-

470 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
pretations offeeling and onto-historical world are care-
fully grounded in the syntax and sound-in-time levels, 
making such interpretations intersubjectively corrob-
orable, since they are tied to specific features that can 
be objectively located through formal analysis of the 
score or experientially confirmed in phenomenological 
evidence. Throughout, however, he wams against both 
a solipsistic "subjectivism" resulting from any focus 
on individual consciousness taken as isolated from the 
world (and from the intersubjective community) and 
an untenable "objectivism" seeking some sort of abso-
lute certainty without re gard for human situatedness in 
language and tradition. Classical phenomenology, he 
argues, may be an appropriate approach to the sheer 
sound-in-time dimension of music, and is especially 
helpful where the usual formalist methods fali short, 
e.g., in some atonal and electronic music. But it should 
be supplemented by hermeneutica! procedures in order 
to do justice to music 's referential meanings and onto-
logica! import, and may in some cases be juxtaposed 
to psychological and semiological methods as well; 
such multifarious methodological configurations may 
be the wave ofthe future for studies in phenomenology 
ofmusic. 
For example, Peter Faltin's Phanomenologie der 
musikalischen Form. Eine experimentalpsychologis-
che Untersuchung zur Wahrnehmung des musikalis-
chen Materials und der musikalischen Syntax 
(Phenomenology of musical form: An experimental-
psychological investigation into the perception ofmu-
sical material and musical syntax, 1979) is conceived 
in a phenomenological spirit in that it is oriented to-
ward the "matters themselves" -
the sounding phe-
nomenon, "music" (rather than, say, its printed score) 
-
yet relies on psychological research methods to 
measure listeners' perceptions of musical structures 
and qualities. YIZHAK SADA! has developed a pheno-
menology of musical style and a unique approach to 
music analysis, coupling his phenomenological roots 
and concerns with investigations into the temporal and 
poietic aspects of music represented by the work of 
Michel Imperty; the semiological accounts ofmusic as 
in the work of Jean-Jacques Nattiez and Jean Molino; 
and musical perception as seen in the work of Irene 
Deliege. He is also committed to corroborating theory 
through experimental activities, and the resulting brand 
of "experimental aesthetics" is enriched with a back 
and forth movement to fundamental questions of the 
epistemological status of music-as-experienced. And 
GIOVANNI PlANA is committed to a "structural pheno-
menology" of music, i.e., an investigation of deep un-
derlying a priori structures of musical sound. Through 
the work ofthese authors as well as John Gilbert, David 
B. Greene, FRIEDRICH JAECKER, ZIJA KOCUKALIC, JUDITH 
LOCHHEAD, and many others, there has been an on-
going effort to bring phenomenological methodology 
into the mainstream ofmusicology and music analysis. 
The phenomenological contribution is to be respon-
sive to the experienced sound phenomena themselves, 
thereby bringing out features usually not adequately 
dealt with in the visual-spatial paradigms and terminol-
ogy of conventional music theory. On the other hand, 
a notable strength in formal methods ofmusic analysis 
and factualistic accounts of music history is that they 
provide a high degree of empirica! adequacy because 
claims about musical structure and historical fact can 
be shown tobe true or false by their correspondence to a 
musical score or historical document. Thus such tech-
niques as the "bridging" used in Ferrara's "eclectic" 
method arise from a dialogue between the resources of 
phenomenology and hermeneutics on the o ne hand and 
the needs and criteria of a preexisting discipline on the 
other. 
Another emerging trend in phenomenology of mu-
sic gives increased emphasis to improvised music, 
which is addressed, for example, by DAVID suDNOW, 
ROBERT CREASE, and ELIZABETH A. BEHNKE (who also ex-
pJores bodily-kinaesthetic dimensions of music mak-
ing). The theme ofimprovisation has been carried even 
further by BRUCE BENSON, who exposes the historical 
and philosophical roots of the notions that a musical 
"work" is a completed unity, with its own autonomous 
(i.e., context-independent) identity, created by an indi-
vidual genius; that the ideal ofperformance ought tobe 
complete fidelity in reproducing this work unchanged; 
and that "classical" music (i.e., the "classics" ofWest-
ern tonality that still dominate the repertoire) is the 
finest form of music, providing the standard in terms 
ofwhich ali other music (popular music, contemporary 
"serious" music, "early" music, jazz, blues, spirituals, 
world music, etc.) is judged (and often marginalized). 
In contrast to the paradigm based on creating, preserv-
ing, and revering classic "works," he suggests returning 
to an older paradigm of context-dependent "pieces" of 

MUSIC 
music, and recommends thinking of ali music mak-
ing in improvisational terms. Performers, for instance, 
necessarily improvise in some regards in bringing the 
score to life in sound and making it speak to us, and 
they do so in the context both of a historically shift-
ing performance tradition and of a historically situated 
community of listeners. 
For example, "restorations" of medieval, Renais-
sance, and baroque music inevitably reveal the values 
of the present "restorers" even as they attempt to let 
past music speak for itself, since the very appeal to 
"authenticity" in performance is not only a historical 
phenomenon, but one alien to the original context in 
which these pieces were performed. Moreover, like 
performers, composers do not make music in a vac-
uum, but improvise within- and shift- the limits of 
a tradition. Thus making music, like ACTION in general, 
not only relies upon the possibilities available within a 
certa in type of order, but can transgress and transform 
this order itself. Benson ultimately characterizes mu-
sical activity as a communal, contextual conversation, 
which implies- as in EMMANUEL LEVINAS- genuine 
respect for the Other, so that no one voice, be it that 
of composer, performer, or listener, is allowed to dom-
inate or drown out the other voices. Here Benson's 
work converges not only with Smith's interest in mu-
sic's community-building potential and Schutz's use 
of music as a model for social relationships, but with 
similar concerns in the work of GABRIEL MARCEL. 
Recurring themes in phenomenology of music in-
clude an abiding commitment to addressing the experi-
enced musical sound itselfrather than substituting, say, 
the analysis ofvisual scores for the direct experience of 
musical phenomena ( or "akoumena"); a persistent fo-
cus on music as a temporal formation, including ques-
tions of unity or cohesion, identity or ideality, and his-
torical situatedness and interpretation; some emphasis 
on bodily, kinaesthetic, and intersubjective/communal 
dimensions of music making; and an emerging con-
cern for music in the context of its world. The latter 
point has been addressed from the perspective of the 
HUMAN SCIENCES in, for example, The Sociology of Mu-
sic ( 1984), by FABIO DASILVA, as well as by Ferrara and 
Benson from a hermeneutica! standpoint. But it can 
also be approached within phenomenology itself (as is 
already indicated by, e.g., the analyses of music and 
Jifeworld by BERNHARD WALDENFELS). 
471 
Here we may allude to methodological issues that 
are not unique to a phenomenology of music, but 
can arise in any of the CULTURAL DISCIPLINES when-
ever it is a question of the phenomenological inves-
tigation of complex historical-cultural formations. It 
is sometimes held that it is nccessary to "go beyond" 
Husserlian phenomenology, repairing its deficiencies 
by turning, for example, to EXISTENTIAL PHENOMEN-
OLOGY or to HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY. (Claims 
of this sort were especially prevalent when key early 
works by Husserl -
notably Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phanomenologie und phanomenologischen Philoso-
phie II [ 1912-15] -
were not yet readily available, 
and persist where Husserl 's contributions to a GEN-
ERATIVE PHENOMENOLOGY concerned with intersubjec-
tive, historical-cultural phenomena have not been suf-
ficiently recognized.) Some of the issues that are at 
stake in this context can be sketched out with refer-
ence to the notion of"freedom from presuppositions." 
It is surely true -
as Ferrara points out -
that 
holding the presumptions and procedures of conven-
tional music analysis in abeyance can open the way for 
alternative approaches, such as a phenomenological 
concern with sound-in-time. Moreover, as Smith re-
minds us, we must be ready to set asi de prejudices and 
expectations derived from, say, the music of Mozart's 
time when we listen to music based on utterly dif-
ferent principles (e.g., work by John Cage). But as 
both Ferrara and Benson emphasize, it is precisely the 
presuppositions proper to a given tradition that pro-
vide the structures of pre-understanding allowing us 
genuinely to hear the music of this tradition. And as 
Clifton indicates, the pre-understandings in question 
are not merely intellectual. Rather, an informed lis-
tener is one who has developed the appropriate sensi-
bility for the music of a given tradition by acquiring 
certain sedimented modes of comportment in the lived 
body. Both music and its listeners are thus inevitably 
situated; consequently, the argument runs, any attempt 
at a completely "presuppositionless" investigation is 
not only wrong-headed, but impossible. 
Yet we need not interpret the phenomenological no-
tion of"freedom from presuppositions" as though it is 
equivalent to the goal of"having no presuppositions at 
ali." Rather- as Husserl tells us in the introduction to 
the second volume of Logische Untersuchungen- the 
"principle of freedom from presuppositions" only at-

472 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
tempts to exclude any assumptions or statements "not 
permitting of a comprehensive phenomenological re-
alization." If we accept Husserl's initial phenomen-
ological impulse as valid (e.g., ifwe are willing to take 
phenomena as correlative to consciousness or world-
experiencing life, rather than seeing them primarily as 
manifestations ofBeing and clues toward a FUNDAMEN-
TAL ONTOLOGY), we may note that presuppositions or 
pre-understandings are intertwined with the phenom-
ena themselves as part ofthe "how" oftheir givenness. 
Tobe "free from" such presuppositions does not mean 
making them go away, but freeing ourselves from au-
tomatically and naively taking them for granted, i.e., 
from tacitly and unquestioningly assuming their valid-
ity and force without even noticing that we are do ing so. 
Instead, we begin to appreciate them for what they are, 
and they may be explicitly thematized, reactivated, ap-
propriated or placed in question, and so on. Thus we do 
not attempt to strip away presuppositions in search of 
some pure "origin," but undertake a "phenomenologi-
cal realization" that makes these very presuppositions 
themselves experientially available. 
This has profound implications not only for the fur-
ther development of a phenomenology of music, but 
a!so for such fie!ds as ETHNOLOGY and ETHNIC STUDIES. 
We may understand a piece of music as gathering and 
guarding a WORLD -
as sustaining and holding open 
the historical-cultural world it presupposes so that this 
world can endure. But music must be heard tobe music. 
And for music to be heard in such a way that its world 
endures, we, the listeners (and performers), must be 
free to appropriate its presuppositions experientially, 
at least to some extent. This does not mean seizing 
them from some supposedly desituated perspective, 
but suspending the hegemony of our own assumptions 
enough to let other possibilities move us as well. This 
may not result in a perfect "fusion" of horizons (to 
borrow Gadamer's term), but can foster at least a tem-
porary and partial coincidence ofhorizons such that the 
lived experience ofthe music of an un familiar tradition 
can open us to the world ofthis tradition and allow us 
to respect it as irreducible to, yet co-possible with, our 
own. Phenomenology ofmusic begins by retuming us 
to the experienced music itself as that which provides 
the evidence for descriptive, eclectic, and hermeneuti-
ca! investigations of it. But with this, phenomenology 
of music also has the potential to contribute to an em-
bodied ETHICS capable ofresponding to the challenges 
of diversity in an increasingly pluralistic world.

NATURAL SCIENCE IN CONSTITUTIVE PERSPEC-
TI VE 
Philosophy of science, as usually under-
stood, approaches scientific theories from the method-
ological standpoint, i.e., it theorizes about scientific 
procedures in order to make scientific knowledge un-
derstandable. In such an approach the problem of sci-
entific validity becomes the chief philosophical is-
sue. Phenomenology proceeds in a way different from, 
but in clase connection with, this methodological ap-
proach. Instead of taking natural science for granted 
-
i.e., science as a system ofpregiven scientific state-
ments and arguments that only require logica! and 
methodological analysis -
it inquires into the con-
ditions that make such statements and arguments pos-
sible. 
These conditions can be understood in various 
ways: they can be the real conditions of worldly ob-
jects themselves or they can be the conditions of the 
scientists as members of a scientific community with ali 
the personal, social, and sociocultural relationships that 
make their research possible. But phenomenology con-
fronts a different set of conditions. Through philosoph-
ical reflection on science in the proper sense, pheno-
menology rei ies on the EIDETIC METHOD to inquire into 
the universal structures of human subjectivity, which, 
in the final analysis, count as the ultima te conditions of 
the possibility of objectivity in general and of scientific 
objectivity in particular. These subjective conditions to 
which phenomenology claims to gain access are, to be 
sure, not the defacto capacities and cognitive activities 
of particular scientists, for these could not be the con-
ditions in which such matters as scientific validity and 
TRUTH are grounded. Rather, something like transcen-
dental subjectivity will prove necessary for objective 
knowledge to be possible. 
It was EDMUND HUSSERL who first took up the task 
of grounding science in this way and who stressed 
throughout his life that phenomenology was to provide 
such a grounding. The method he developed for this 
purpose was initially a type of descriptive analysis that 
only !ater became part of what is called constitutive 
analysis. Both names, however, are only informative 
with respect to the domain of phenomenological analy-
sis. The way in which everything we deal with is given 
and becomes accessible only through intentiona! acts 
ofconsciousness shows that the domain ofphenomen-
ology is focused on the relations between intentiona! 
acts and intended objects. Thus Husserl 's turn to the 
abject was simultaneously supplemented by a turn to 
the subject. He relies on a new type of reflection that 
discloses relations between the subject and the abject, 
referred to as INTENTIONALITY, as a matter of mutual 
relations. It is basically these relations that count as the 
"given" in his phenomenology. Phenomenology must 
investigate what is given in the world of everyday life 
as well as in the scientific universe correlative to such 
intentiona! activities, which stand behind ali scientific 
research. 
Husserl 's insight into the parallelism between the 
structures of subjective acts and the structures of the 
objects to which these acts refer forms the basis for the 
first conception ofthe phenomenological grounding of 
natural science: science is tobe regarded as constituted 
in specific intentiona! activities ofthe subject in such a 
way that these activities always take place on the foun-
dation of simple originary acts. For example, the truth 
of an empirica! proposition as asserted in processes 
of thinking is founded upon perceptual processes of 
observing the objects that such claims are about. It 
then becomes a principal task for phenomenological 
analysis to show how the epistemological roots of fun-
damental scientific concepts -
for instance, space, 
time, mass, force, energy -
can be traced back to 
the corresponding concepts formed and used in the 
nonscientific world of everyday life and how, on the 
other hand, the scientific concepts originale and are 
built up from these original concepts. The different 
kinds of abstraction and the specific types of general-
ization, idealization, and formalization -
which are 
intentiona! activities and constituie scientific concepts 
step by step at different levels of consciousness until 
their precise meanings in science are achieved- need 
to be analyzed, distinguished, and classified. 
Husserl himself actually presented no detailed anal-
yses of these processes, leaving them instead to his 
successors, but he struggled throughout his research to 
tind the true starting point for such inquiries. Numerous

NATURAL SCIENCE IN CONSTITUTIVE PERSPECTIVE

descriptions of things and states of affairs of everyday 
life and- especially in his last work, Die Krisis der 
europaischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale 
Phănomenologie ( 1936) -
his turn to the LIFEWORLD 
were principally motivated by the concern to scrutinize 
the relations between this world of everyday life and 
natural science. It is obvious that the so-called world 
of science does not represent a second world beside 
or above the reality of everyday life, for it is precisely 
the latter world that is, on the one hand, experienced 
straightforwardly and is, on the other hand, objectified 
by science. 
This led Husserl to the fundamental question ofhow 
the objectification of the world by natural science can 
be comprehended and how science in general can be 
understood as an achievement ofthe subject. This fun-
damental issue of his phenomenology refers basically 
to the problem of the structure of subjectivity. How is 
it that the same subject who lives its life here and now 
within the world as a finite being is, at the same time, 
capable of constituting, examining, and corroborating 
statements in science, thus participating in truth and 
bringing forth accomplishments of scientific validity 
that outlast its life in the everyday world? 
This problem of subjectivity led Husserl to a radi-
calization of his analysis of constitutive acts. In terms 
of method it is characterized by a series of "reduc-
tions," the most significant ofwhich is the transcenden-
tal EPOCHE AND REDUCTION providing the crucial move 
from the earlier descriptive phenomenology of acts 
of consciousness to the [ater CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMEN-
OLOGY of subjectivity. The transcendental EPOCHE ANO 
REDUCTION involves an abstention from all judgments 
ofbeing and does so in such a way that the WORLD, and 
all that belongs to it, becomes a theme for phenomen-
ology as a world as it is "meant as being." That is, in 
Husserl 's terminology, the world is thereby reduced to 
the "transcendental phenomenon" of the world. This 
phenomenon is "transcendental" in the sense that the 
subject, while performing this peculiar reduction, es-
tablishes itself as a transcendental subject: reflecting 
on its own intentiona! activities, it detects doxic po-
sitional or thetic components in all acts that "posit" 
being and do so only as being in a certain sense. By 
these components the intentiona! acts are now recog-
nized as sense-bestowing (sinnstifiende) acts, and are 
set out and investigated as such in strict correlation 
with the modalities of being of the intended objects. 
Through the latter being "given" in the natural attitude, 
transcendental phenomenology thereby arrives at the 
insight that the being of all that is given is "posited" 
in the course of its experience. Ali natural givenness 
in everyday life as well as in natural science is thus to 
be recognized as a transcendental sense-product of a 
subjectivity in which being is posited. 
The phenomenological concept of constitution thus 
acquires its precise meaning through the transcenden-
tal reduction, which is then, so to speak, the gateway 
to a field of discoveries to be made by "constitutive 
analysis." The constitution of an object in this field 
no longer simply means that the phenomenon is to be 
described in its essential features, nor does it mean 
merely the mental procedures of identifying syntheses 
as they are in principle needed for the unification of in-
dividual modes of appearance of any object in order to 
make it conceivable as one and the same. Rather, con-
stitution in the strict sense of transcendental pheno-
menology means that the former merely descriptive 
analyses, being referred to singular intentiona! acts, 
must be replaced by investigations ofthe intentionality 
that, from the teleological standpoint of its function, 
make the synthetic unity possible. 
This holds especially for al! constituted unities of 
theory and object in science, which are extremely com-
plex in themselves and based on unities in the lifeworld. 
Constitutive analysis must trace these back to the life-
world by reactivating their sense levels, on which for-
mer sense-bestowing achievements are "sedimented." 
Constitutive phenomenology must furthermore exam-
ine these transcendental achievements in all their com-
plexity and implications through penetration into the 
"intentiona! horizons" of every performance. 
What is especially significant are the intentiona! re-
lations between actuality and potentiality with respect 
to sense-bestowing acts. These show that ali acts are 
temporal and that the constitution of an object can in 
principle only take place as a process in TIME. This 
holds for the constitution of any object whatsoever and 
is, in a final analysis, due to how consciousness is basi-
cally structured temporally. Thus since the temporality 
of constitution essentially consists in the fact that what 
has been already achieved is included in the present 
constitution, all constitution is genetic constitution. 
GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY opens up a wide field of 

476 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
constitutive analysis for Husserl, especially where the 
constitutive problems of natural science are concerned. 
This is a science for which nature must first be given, 
for nature is that which is approached through the meth-
ods of science. According to constitutive phenomen-
ology, this implies that one has to regard the constitut-
ing subject not only as a transcendental subject, but at 
the same time as a human subject who is the origin not 
only of natural science but ofthe constitution ofnature 
as we11. 
The inherent problems ofthis twofold determinati an 
of the subject and of its identity need not be pursued 
here. But it should be mentioned that the human sub-
ject is the foundation of natural science -
and this 
not only because, and not only insofar as, it is active 
in science, but already by virtue of its ro le in consti-
tuting the sense of existence of the object of science, 
i.e., nature. Furthermore, nature thus conceived is to 
be constituted as the hasis for a science of nature that 
claims objective knowledge in a special sense. Its ob-
jectivity refers to a certain property ofpropositions and 
arguments about its objects that we ca11 "objective" if 
they can in principle be made by and demonstrated to 
everybody. Objectivity can only be constituted by a 
plurality of subjects. A solipsistic subject would not 
be able to understand the term "objectivity"; it could 
not even conceive it. Objectivity essentia11y refers to 
INTERSUBJECTIVITY. 
Further study shows how Husserl tried in very subtle 
and detailed investigations to elucidate how intersub-
jectivity itself is constituted. In conducting these in-
vestigations he again carne across the human, i.e., the 
somatie existence of the subject as one of the neces-
sary conditions for intersubjectivity. The human BODY 
is thus not irrelevant to foundations of natural science. 
In turn, the possible commonality in which the differ-
ence and distinctiveness ofthe single subjects must be 
overcome is the commonality oftheir sense-bestowing 
achievements that make the objectivity of natural sci-
ence possible. 
Notwithstanding that Husserl had not solved a11 the 
problems ofthe constitutive analysis of intersubjectiv-
ity, he could thus claim to have discovered the tran-
scendental origin of natural science. One of the ur-
gent requirements placed on philosophy of science in 
general is then to revive and preserve in our present 
consciousness the knowledge of the constitutive con-
ditions of natural science. This is so not only because 
science is the theoretical structure developed in the 
highest and most advanced form ofhuman activity, but 
also because the progress of science is accompanied by 
an ever increasing estrangement ofhumanity from sci-
entifica11y investigated and configured nature. Husserl 
had this estrangement in mind when he ca11ed atten-
tion to the "covering over" ofthe sense ofthe originary 
lifeworld and thus the forgetting ofthis foundation and 
spoke ofthe crisis ofthe modern sciences. Ifthis crisis 
is to be overcome, it must first be exposed, i.e., the 
concealments and the shiftings of sense through for-
mer sense-bestowals have to be made visible and the 
genesis of sense reactivated by methods of constitutive 
analysis. 
Thus Husserl 's constitutive phenomenology of na-
ture is to serve a double purpose: (1) to show the fruit-
fulness ofthe phenomenological method for establish-
ing a philosophical grounding of natural science, and 
(2) to help us better understand what natural science is 
and what is means for our practica! life that the world 
is increasingly shaped by natural science.

NATURAL SCIENCE IN HERMENEUTICAL PERSPECTIVE 
477 
NATURAL SCIENCE IN HERMENEUTICAL PER-
SPECTIVE 
The basic insights of HERMENEUTI-
CAL PHENOMENOLOGY can be appJied to the domain of 
the natural sciences. Authors who work in this field 
often take their point of departure from MARTIN HEIDEG-
GER and particularly from his conception ofthe nature 
of science and of the relation of the sciences to phi-
losophy. Heidegger formulated his view in Sein und 
Zeit (1927), in some essays in Holzwege ( 1950), and 
in Vortrăge und Aufsătze, as well as in Die Frage nach 
dem Ding (1962). 
Some authors working in this field have made an 
effort to explain Heidegger's own position in regard 
to the natural sciences in detail or to subject it to 
a critica! analysis (CARLOS ASTRADA, HAROLD ALDER-
MAN, RAINER BAST, PIETRO CHIODI, KARLFRID GRUNDER, 
THEODORE KISIEL, JOSEPH J. KOCKELMANS, HANS SEIGFRIED, 
VINCENZO VITELLO, MICHAEL ZIMMERMAN). Others, in ad-
dition, have made an effort to develop these semi-
nal ideas in new directions (PATRICK HEELAN, THEODORE 
KISIEL, JOSEPH J. KOCKELMANS). Although JOHN COMP-
TON's work in the philosophy ofscience was deeply in-
ftuenced by MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, and that of JOSEPH 
ROUSE has found inspiration in MICHEL FOUCAULT, one 
can nonetheless in an indirect manner find the inftu-
ence ofHeidegger's conception ofthe sciences also in 
their ideas. 
Hermeneutica! phenomenology is not preoccupied 
with logica!, methodological, or epistemological is-
sues, but rather focuses on the ontologica! problems 
with which the natural sciences confront us. The fol-
lowing are some examples of such questions: what is 
the ontologica! status of the concept of "nature" as 
this is studied in physics, chemistry, and biology? In 
what sense and within what limits can one meaning-
fully speak about the TRUTH of scientific theories and 
scientific claims? To what do the empirica! sciences 
of nature really owe their high degree of rigor and 
certainty? What is the ontologica! status oftheoretical 
entities? What is one to think about scientific realism, 
constructive empiricism, conventionalism, etc.? How 
does the LANGUAGE used in the natural sciences relate 
to the language we speak outside the domain ofthe sci-
ences? How is one to measure the enormous impact of 
the sciences on our entire world through modem TECH-
NOLOGY? How do the sciences affect the way we think 
outside the domain of the sciences? How do the sci-
ences affect our conceptions ofRELIGION, morality, AES-
THETICS, and our politica! practice? What is the impact 
of the natural sciences on our "system" of EDUCATION? 
How do the sciences actually change our social and 
politicallife? There are many other such questions, yet 
the basic questions are always: what is natural science? 
How do scientific activities relate to nonscientific ac-
tivities? Precisely what happens when one adopts the 
theoretical attitude? What is the exact relationship be-
tween a scientific object and the corresponding thing 
that we encounter in the everyday WORLD? What is the 
nature of our scientific thematization and objectivation 
and what is the ontologica! status ofthe objects consti-
tuted in the scientific thematization and objectivation? 
It is one ofthe basic theses of hermeneutica! pheno-
menology that understanding, to the degree that it is 
articulated and unfolded, is interpretation. This thesis 
implies that our scientific understanding ofnature, too, 
is no more than an interpretation of what is. Thus our 
large-scale research programs and theories are ali very 
sophisticated interpretations of natural phenomena that 
rest on a limited number of assumptions, the validity 
of which cannot be justified on the basis of empirica! 
grounds alone. This state of affairs implies, in turn, 
that no research program or theory can ever compre-
hensively express the ontologica! structure ofthe real, 
natural world. Every scientific theory, even though it is 
and remains a theory ofwhat is real, is in truth no more 
than a possible interpretation of a large set of phenom-
ena on the basis of certain principles, some of which 
are accepted only on pragmatic and historically condi-
tioned grounds. To explain what is characteristic for a 
hermeneutico-phenomenological approach to the natu-
ral sciences, it is necessary first to show that the natural 
sciences are indeed in need of careful ontologica! re-
fiections that concern themselves with the meaning of 
scientific theories and claims. From the discussions 
between dogmatists, skeptics, transcendentalists, op-
erationalists, logica! empiricists, positivists, etc., it is 
clear that the foundations of the natural sciences can 
be, and have been, interpreted in different ways. Thus 
it is necessary to determine critically the precise mean-
ing of scientific theories and claims, and to explain 
how such claims relate to other possible claims about 
natural phenomena. 
In this task hermeneutica! phenomenologists care-
fully examine how the theoretical approach to the

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
world develops from a more original practica! preoc-
cupation with things. Here they are particularly con-
cemed with the meaning and function ofthe objectify-
ing thematization in which the mathematical projection 
ofthe natural world is brought about. In our prescien-
tific life we deal concemfully with things. When we 
adopt the scientific attitude we give up this concemful 
preoccupation in order to look at things in a purely the-
oretical manner. Yet adopting the theoretical attitude 
does not consist in abandoning our concern, but rather 
in taking a second look at things. 
Because ofthe change in our attitude toward them, 
the things that originally were things of concern now 
begin to assume a different character. They Iose their 
location in their original world and henceforth appear 
only in a place that is unrelated to us and is also without 
limitations. The thing's actuallocation does not matter 
any longer; its location has become a world-point, as it 
were, which is in no way distinguished from any other 
such point (demundanization). In addition, space and 
spatial determinations of things we encounter in our 
everyday life also become objectified and stripped of 
their typicallimitations. At the same time, a similar ob-
jectification takes place in the temporal determinations 
and aspects ofthings and events as well as in the con-
ception of time characteristic of everyday life. For in 
the sciences we no longer consider these things in the 
perspective oftheir possible use in concrete situations. 
The advantage of this way of proceeding is that from 
now on we are a bie to describe and determine with pre-
cision the structural moments ofwhat is merely there, 
present-at-hand. 
Another important characteristic ofthe modem nat-
ural sciences consists in the fact that these sciences 
make the things appear only in that kind of objectivity 
which is constituted by the different scientific objec-
tivations. It appears that the things can be made into 
objects of theoretical research in more than one way. 
Each form of objectivation implies a particular attitude 
ofthe scientists toward the things in the world, so that 
the things that are encountered in this way are always 
seen from a particular point ofview. By making the as-
pect that has been revealed from a given point ofview 
the object of a critica! and methodical inquiry, the sci-
entists, in their theoretical attitude, lay the foundation 
of a particular empirica! science. 
Accordingly, by their very attitude toward the things 
in the world, the scientists definea certa in area ofthings 
as their domain of inquiry. The discovery and delim-
itation of a well-defined domain of inquiry is the first 
step of every form of scientific inquiry. The entities 
that belong to this domain are then made into a theme 
of investigation and constituted as objects with only 
a limited number of characteristics. In Newton's me-
chanics this is brought about by definitions and "laws 
ofnature." Once the objects ofthe domain are thus pro-
jected mathematically, the rest is then also determined: 
the approach to this domain is given its particular me-
thodical direction, the structure of the conceptual and 
discursive explanation has received its orientation, and 
a specific technical language is established. The pur-
pose ofthematization is to free the things ofthe world, 
or a particular group of them, in such a way that they 
can be the object of a purely theoretical discovery and 
can therefore be examined objectively. 
Now if it is indeed true that ali forms of human 
knowledge are forms of interpretation, then it is also 
legitimate to claim that scientific PERCEPTION, too, is 
already an interpreti ve act. One can show, for instance 
-
as does Heelan -
that visual space tends to have 
a Euclidean geometrica! structure only when the envi-
ronment is filled with objects that always ha ve the same 
pattern and always show the same aspects, and when 
these shapes and patterns continually exhibit standard 
Euclidean shapes. On the other hand, our perception 
tends to have a hyperbolic structure when vision is 
not aided by these clues. From this it follows that ali 
scientific perceptions are hermeneutica!. The scientific 
observers leam to "read" perceptual and instrumental 
stimuli as one learns to read a text. Thus the hermeneu-
tica! aspect ofthe natural sciences is located at the heart 
ofthese sciences where one would ha ve least expected 
it, namely within the acts of scientific observation. 
Other hermeneutica! dimensions of the natural sci-
ences on which hermeneutica! philosophers have fo-
cused are scientific discovery and scientific rationality. 
As far as the first issue is concemed, hermeneuticists in 
this case take up issues raised earlier by Norwood Rus-
se! Hanson, Stephen Toulmin, and Michael Polanyi. In 
the view of these authors, one was concerned in the 
tradition of logica! empiricism mainly with scientif1c 
explanation, and a very sophisticated logic of science 
was developed there. It is usually assumed in that tra-
dition that there is no parallel logic of discovery. With 

NATURAL SCIENCE IN HERMENEUTICAL PERSPECTIVE 
479 
respect to questions conceming discovery one usuaUy 
appealed to intuition, the gestalt switch, the concept 
of genius, etc. Problems of scientific discovery were 
claimed to lie outside the domain of philosophy of 
science proper, and were thus usually relegated to psy-
chology and the social sciences. 
Later, when a revisionist movement in philosophy 
of science developed that focused explicitly on science 
as an ongoing process in finite historical contexts, the 
history of science began to play a much more impor-
tant role in philosophical reflections on the sciences; 
in some cases sociology of knowledge and cognitive 
science also played important parts. Yet the work done 
in this movement was mainly philosophical in nature. 
Hermeneuticists are positive about this development 
in the philosophy of science. Yet they are also con-
vinced that many of the authors working in this area 
are somehow stuck in an unacceptable philosophical 
framework ofmeaning. This is the reason why the ba-
sic issues need to be rethought from the perspective of 
hermeneutic phenomenology and why one must pay 
special attention to the meaning and function of the 
hermeneutica! circle in reflections on scientific discov-
ery. 
As far as the debate about REASON in the sciences is 
concemed, some hermeneuticists feei that the domain 
ofthe rational in logica! empiricism was usuaUy more 
or less identified with the domain of the logica!. This 
led, in turn, to the view that scientific discovery cannot 
be rationally accounted for; thus there simply cannot be 
a logic of discovery. There can only bea psychology or 
sociology of discovery. Hermeneuticists disagree with 
this view and propose that one pay more attention to 
the situation and the historical context in which every 
discovery comes about, instead of one-sidedly focus-
ing on the actual behavior ofthe relevant scientists. To 
substantiate their criticism ofthe logica! empiricist po-
sition and to justify their own hermeneutica! approach 
to the natural sciences, these hermeneutica! phenome-
nologists reflect criticaUy on a number of issues that 
psychologists and sociologists often tend to overlook. 
First, scientific problems arise oftheir own accord; 
they are not solicited; they demand the attention of 
the scientists. The scientists respond to this appeal; 
this is the reason why a psychology of discovery is 
not very helpful. Second, problems are always very 
complex because they manifest themselves as some-
thing that runs against a background of meaning with 
which they conflict. In addition, the problem always 
stands in a much broader background of meaning that 
is taken to be unproblematic and that is assumed to 
contain in principle aU the insights needed to sol ve the 
problem. Furthermore, scientific discovery takes place 
within the domain of language in which ali known in-
sights have already been formulated in a manner that 
severs them from their historical situation so that they 
can be applied time and again in new and different 
contexts. Third, scientific problems have a vectorial 
character that is closely related to their contextual na-
ture: they are obtrusive, solicit inquiry, and push, as it 
were, in a certain direction, as far as possible solutions 
are concerned. FinaUy, these problems appear to show 
themselves from a chiaroscuro situation; they are not 
seen or experienced by aU, but must be brought into the 
open, clearly formulated, and placed into their proper 
contexts. 
These issues explain why we need a hermeneutic 
of the natural sciences. For the rationality of scien-
tific discovery can perhaps be described best by caU-
ing scientific discovery a narrative explanation. The 
process of scientific discovery always takes place in 
a social and historical situation; it is articulated and 
structured from the perspective of a shared tradition, 
and it is studied by researchers trained in the skiUs, 
habits, attitudes, and conditions of the discipline at a 
certain stage of its development. Scientific discovery 
can therefore correctly be called a rational -
be it 
also a faUible- response to a changing problem situ-
ation that is interpreted and resolved according to the 
resources provided by a concrete conceptual context 
or world. The kind of rationality operative here can 
be called ontologica!, because it is concemed with a 
set of relationships between the context of meaning 
from which the discoverers proceed and the scientific 
problem and meaning with which they are concretely 
concemed; it is in this domain that the hermeneutic 
circle is of great importance. This rationality can be 
caUed hermeneutica!, insofar as discovery is always an 
interpretive response, a response from the perspective 
of a carefully defined horizon of meaning. FinaUy, this 
rationality is historical to the degree that the discov-
erer rei ies on a particular tradition for its resources and 
insofar as every discovery is irreversible in time. 
The question ofwhether the position ofhermeneu-

480 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
tical phenomenology can be called realistic is debated 
among phenomenologists. Heelan caUs his position re-
alistic but qualifies the term by calling it hermeneu-
tica! or horizonal realism. For in his view it belongs 
to the essence of science to specify ever new hori-
zons of reality that become accessible to perception 
by "readable technologies," a special product of sci-
entific theory. Kockelmans, on the other hand, argues 
that hermeneutica! phenomenology cannot be called a 
form of realism, because every form of realism is at 
root stiU a form of dogmatism, whereas hermeneuti-
ca! phenomenology is a transcendental, critica! form 
ofphilosophy. Yet at the same time, he also maintains 
that every good scientific theory is a theory of what 
is, just as every good scientific claim is a claim about 
what is. To avoid contradiction in this latter view, it is 
necessary to broaden the classical coherence theory of 
truth and to detine truth basically as revealment.

NATURALISM 
Sometimes also called scien-
tism, positivism, or objectivism, naturalism has been 
and remains the main opponent of phenomenology. 
In most naturalism, nature is ali that there is; gen-
uine philosophical and scientific knowledge is solely 
based on the sensuous perception of physical objects; 
and thus values and purposes, as well as minds and 
gods, are beyond nature, do not exist at ali, or can-
not be known. They are merely words. Other forms of 
naturalism recognize humanly imperceptible realities, 
such as x-rays and the unconscious. ANALYTIC PHILoso-
PHY, ORDINARY LANGUAGE ANALYSIS, LOGICAL POSITIVISM, 
MARXISM, and PSYCHOANALYSIS are naturaJistic. In ad-
dition, ECONOMICS, POLITICAL SCIENCE, SOCIOLOGY, PSY-
CHOLOGY, and others of what are sometimes called the 
"behavioral sciences" are often pursued in a behavior-
istic fashion that is associated with naturalism. Behav-
iorism classically denies that the inside or first person 
perspectives on subjects can yield scientific results. Fi-
nally, naturalists tend to deny insight into ideal objects, 
such as logica! forms, and thus tend to be nominalists 
as well. 
There ha ve been naturalistic movements in AESTHET-
ICS and LITERA TURE that emphasize nature in contrast to 
the traditionally emphasized human or religious sub-
jects. The naturalism in philosophy and science that 
phenomenology opposes is not incompatible with such 
cultural movements. But the chief source of inspiration 
for "intellectual naturalism," as it might be called in 
order include psychological and social scientific dis-
ciplines, is not the aesthetic experience of nature, but 
rather modem NATURAL SCIENCE. Such science, which is 
basically mathematical physics, began to supersede an-
cient and medieval Westem natural philosophy around 
the time of Galileo; it has produced century after cen-
tury ofstunning accomplishments, and is well reftected 
in the epistemology and metaphysics of modern phi-
losophy. That KANT as well as Descartes were also 
physicists of the first rank seems not unrelated to this 
emphasis. 
Naturalism has been considerably strengthened in 
two respects since the second half of the 19th cen-
tury. First, this was when the centuries-old dreams of 
scientific TECHNOLOGY began to be fulfilled with the ap-
plication ofphysical scientific knowledge in founding 
and developing the chemical and electrica! industries, a 
process that has intensified and generalized into every

industry sin ce then. Second, this was also when Darwin 
made his revolution in biology, which was followed by 
a biologica! form of naturalism before World War 1 
that affected HENRI BERGSON and WILLIAM JAMES among 
others. Continuing developments in biologica! science 
and biotechnology promise to support considerable bi-
ologica! naturalism into the 21 st century, some of it 
currently reflected in COGNITIVE SCIENCE and ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE. 
Few phenomenological philosophers (and none of 
the leading figures) either disparage the achievements 
of modem natural science per se or are unconcemed 
about the problematic impacts of scientific technol-
ogy, which became unignorable with the industrialized 
slaughter of World War 1. But they have grave hes-
itations about the generalization of natural scientific 
attitudes into philosophy such that metaphysics is in 
effect considered coterminous with physics and episte-
mology is considered conterminous with the method-
ology ofphysics. They do not oppose science but sci-
entism. The peripheralization if not outright ignoring 
of normative disciplines such as AESTHETICS, ETHICS, 
and POLITICS in the name of how human nature "actu-
ally works" is also cause for concern, for what besides 
particular economic interests can then guide the vast 
powers ofscientific technologywhen traditional values 
are set aside and no altematives ha ve been developed? 
For naturalism to be understood phenomenologi-
cally, NATURAL SCIENCE and its relations to everyday 
life, the cultural or HUMAN SCIENCES, the formal sci-
ences, technology, and philosophy itselfneed tobe re-
flected upon. This reveals that the nature investigated 
in natural science is the result of special efforts, so 
that natural science is nothing natural. Fundamentally, 
a specific attitude must be cultivated in order to thema-
tize contents of cultural worlds as naturalistic objects. 
In this attitude, the practica! and evaluational character-
istics that belong to objects as originally encountered 
in everyday life are habitually regarded. Then the sun 
and moon, for example, have their ordinary human 
uses as means to recognize the time of day, month, 
or year abstracted from and become strictly abstract 
astronomical objects. That such objects can be more 
easily related to mathematical models and that such 
models then make more precise clocks and calendars 
possible is part of the attraction of the naturalistic ap-
proach, which advances not merely theoretical science 
but also scientific technology. And when an approach 
is astonishingly effective in one specialized area, it is 
often tried in ali disciplines, philosophy included. 
It would be an error merely to consider the naturalis-
tic attitude of natural science as theoretical in contrast 
to the practica! attitudes of nonscientific life. This is 
an error because it is possible to take up a theoreti-
cal attitude toward contents of the everyday lifeworld 
that does not abstract from their everyday values and 
purposes and that thus remain basic concrete objects. 
One can then theorize about communities, traditions, 
persons, and wor!ds in ECONOMICS, ETHNOLOGY, COM-
MUNICOLOGY, GEOGRAPHY, HISTORY, POLITICAL SCIENCE, 
SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY, and other human Or cultural 
sciences. A scientific attitude specifically pertaining 
to sciences of this kind can consider teleological ex-
planations. In contrast, explanations of phenomena in 
terms of ends and values for persons and communities 
are suppressed in the naturalistic attempt to explain 
events in terms only of efficient causes, which become 
prominent when the WORLD is regarded as structured 
not in terms of culture, communities, and traditions, 
but solely in terms ofnaturalistic events in space, time, 
and causality. 
One consequence ofthe remarkably rapid advance 
of not only the theoretical natural sciences but also the 
natural scientific technologies derived from them is the 
contemporary tendency in the common mind to iden-
tify "science" with "natural science" to the disregard 
of the human sciences, e.g., history and sociology. A 
more balanced view would recognize the scientific in 
general and then divide it along one dimension into 
the natural or even the naturalistic and the human or 
cultural sciences and along another dimension into the-
oretical and applied science, so that there are then four 
bideterminate forms ofthe scientific, and this is stiU not 
to consider the formal sciences of LOGIC and MATHEMAT-
ICS. It is in disciplines such as ARCHITECTURE, MEDICINE, 
NURSING, and PSYCHIATRY that cultural scientific knowJ-
edge as well as natural scientific knowledge can be 
used for practica! purposes. An adequate account of 
"application" is still needed, but it can begin with the 
insight that rarely are results and methods from but 
one theoretical discipline employed in a science-based 
practica! discipline. 
It is also a common mistake among the less sophis-
ticated opponents of naturalism to include the promi-

482 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
nence of mathematical methods in modern natural sci-
ence among the defining characteristics of what they 
oppose. Such thinkers would tend to advocate qualita-
tive instead of quantitative approaches. This is an error 
first of all because qualitative accounts have always 
been produced in the phase of natural science called 
"natural history." Second, it needs tobe recognized that 
not all mathematical methods are quantitative in the 
strict sense that requires units, counting, and measure-
ment. The recognition of nonquantitative mathematics 
helps it be seen that mathematics is fundamentally con-
tinuous with logic in what might generically be called 
"formal analysis." Such formal analysis has also been 
consciously practiced since ancient times in logic (and 
applied in rhetoric) and is thus nothing peculiar to sci-
ence that is either modern or natural or, for that matter, 
to naturalistic technology, philosophy, and culture. 
If the error of considering formal analysis, which 
can also be called "applied formal science," as a detin-
ing trait of naturalism is avoided, then a place for math-
ematics in the cultural sciences can be recognized as of 
methodological use apart from any naturalistic abstrac-
tion to which the originaUy useful and valuable cultural 
objects of socioculturallife might be subjected. This is 
not to deny that mathematical approaches in sciences of 
aU types involve formalization and idealization as ab-
stractive techniques that transcend the various unique 
qualitative features of naturalistic as well as cultural 
objects. Then again, there is also no denying that for-
mal methods, which are chiefly statistica!, have made 
possible the constantly more powerful science-based 
techniques for manipulating cultural life, e.g., in the 
advertising industry and also in the opinion polling that 
increasingly guides politica! campaigning and gover-
nance. 
The physicalistic emphasis within naturalism in-
volves a further disregarding of the psychic com-
ponents that were the preoccupation of premodern 
thought and are always the preoccupation ofprescien-
tific life, where people are chiefly interested in people. 
Thus the question of whether the heavenly bodies are 
gods is excluded by physicalistic astronomy. Beyond 
this, humans as weU as other animals also have their 
psyches physicalistically disregarded and then only 
atoms, molecules, chemistry, and physiology are reaUy 
real. A naturalistic epistemology tends to emphasize 
physicalistic forms through a preoccupation with the 
sensuous perception of material objects and an empha-
sis on the logica! reconstruction of natural scientific 
methods for establishing knowledge of such objects. 
This excludes methods for understanding personalities, 
traditions, and communities through RE-PRESENTATION 
and interpretation, all of which involve psychic lives, 
values, volition, teleological explanation, and culture. 
Chief among the techniques included in the cultural ori-
entation ofthe human sciences are those that pertain to 
HERMENEUTICS, which is concerned with the interpreta-
tion and critique not only of texts but also of traces, 
i.e., data that are nonlinguistic, such as archaeological 
remains and facial expressions. Hermeneutics is much 
appreciated by phenomenologists of ali tendencies. 
When psychic, social, historical, and cultural ob-
jects are not as such excluded from consideration, the 
issues central for disciplines and multi-disciplines such 
as ETHNIC STUDIES, ECOLOGY, and FEMINISM can be ap-
proached, aUowing difficult problems of RELATIVISM 
and reductionism to emerge and be generalized. Are 
objective or nonrelative knowledge and purposes at 
aU possible when even scientists and practitioners and. 
what they claim to know and do might vary accord-
ing to the professional (and, sometimes, extraprofes-
sional) communities and traditions in which their ac-
counts and purposes are constituted? Would recourse 
to EIDETIC METHOD in order to establish what holds for 
any cultural situation or world whatever be sufficient 
in such a case? One of the attractions of naturalism as 
a broad outlook in philosophy as well as science is that 
if one habituaUy abstracts from cultural characteristics 
in order to gain access to naturalistic objects, then one 
readily believes in a nature that is the one nonrelative 
reality in contrast to the many relative cultural worlds. 
But the price ofthis objectivity is suspiciously cheap. 
What is essential for natural science and naturalism 
as the general outlook if not ideology derived from it is 
that the cultural characteristics with which ali objects 
are originally encountered are abstracted from in order 
to have the naturalistic objects. The naturalistic atti-
tude is fostered in the professional training of natural 
scientists and natural-science-based technologists and 
practitioners and is thus automatically adopted in or-
der to do physics or, in different variants, botany, and 
behavioristic psychological and social science, engi-
neering, as weU as some areas of medicine and even 
types ofpsychiatry. As intimated, however, naturalism 

NATURALISM

is ultimately a new and problematic type of culture. 
Natural scientific knowledge and thus control ofnature 
has even become an object of a new and religion-like 
faith for many, while for others the very project and 
its consequences are deeply disturbing. It is ironic that 
an alternate to traditional religion would engender new 
religious attitudes. 
While an increasing tendency to oppose natural-
ism can be discerned in the history ofphenomenology, 
phenomenology cannot be said to ha ve been utterly in-
nocent of naturalism. EDMUND HUSSERL was originally 
interested in astronomy, received his doctorate in math-
ematics, chiefly published works in the philosophy of 
logic and mathematics, and developed his philosophy 
at Gottingen, a major center not only for 20th century 
mathematics and physics, but also for natural scien-
tific technology. Naturalism was opposed by him as 
part ofhis objection to PSYCHOLOGISM in Logische Un-
tersuchungen ( 1900--1901 ), where he vigorously held 
that ideal objects can be grasped in categoria! intuition. 
Places for a theory of VALUE, a theory of ACTION, and 
a philosophy of the human or cultural sciences can be 
found in subsequent publications of his lifetime, be-
ginning with "Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft" 
( 1911) and in his characterization ofthe natural attitude 
in §27 of Ideen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 (1913). Neverthe-
less, after the emphasis on the grounding of logic and 
mathematics, Husserl 's emphasis in the works of his 
lifetime is on natural scientific psychology and physics. 
Only with the posthumous publications in 1952 of 
Jdeen II [1912-15], with its central distinction within 
the natural attitude between the naturalistic attitude of 
natural science and the more fundamental personalis-
tic attitude of the cultural sciences; the publication in 
1954 ofthe full text of Die Krisis der europăischen Wis-
senschaften und die transzendentale Phănomenologie 
( 1936), with its emphasis on the world as lifeworld; and 
the publication in 1962 of Phănomenologische Psy-
chologie [ 1925], with its project of a human or cultural 
scientific psychology, did it become conspicuous that 
any naturalism in Husserl was a matter of emphasis 
rather than essence. 
The philosophy of the cultural sciences of AL-
FRED SCHUTZ, beginning with Der sinnhafte Aujbau 
der sozialen Welt (The meaning-structure of the so-
cial world, 1932), is at least as naturalistic in empha-
sis as the works Husserl published, but, again, careful 
study discloses not only the teleological explanation 
involving "in-order-to motives" but also the inclusion 
of values and purposes under his operative concept 
of MEANING. SimilarJy, ARON GURWITSCH's The Fiefd of 
Consciousness ( 1964) and other works, and the GEST ALT 
PSYCHOLOGY centrally appropriated by him, will be 
comprehended naturalistically if one does not watch for 
the occasional passages devoted to how the "percep-
tual world" and the life-spheres within it are originally 
cultural, something systematically advocated in !ater 
essays and in the posthumously published Die mitmen-
schlischen Begegnungen in der Milieuwelt [Human en-
counters in the social world, 1931] and Esquisse de 
la phenomlmologie constitutive [Sketch of constitutive 
phenomenology, 1937]. Such naturalistic emphases in 
the second generation of CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 
relate in part to the times and audiences in GERMANY 
and the UNITED STATES before and after World War II. 
More recent work, such as that of RICHARD M. ZANER 
in the philosophy of medicine, THOMAS M. SEEBOHM in 
the philosophy of hermeneutics, and LESTER EMBREE in 
the philosophy of archaeology reflect more culturally 
oriented work in this tendency. 
The analyses of equipment, practica! concems, lan-
guage, and interpretation in MARTIN HEIDEGGER's Sein 
und Zei! ( 1927) can hardly be considered naturalistic. 
Carefully considered, the opposition to naturalism dis-
cernible in the EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY in FRANCE 
of JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, and SI-
MONE DE BEAUVOIR does not include opposition to natu-
ral science, but only rejection of its naturalistic attitude 
for metaphysical and epistemological purposes. Fol-
lowing the work of GABRIEL MARCEL as well as MAX 
SCHELER, the phenomenology of the BODY in France 
opposed the naturalism that would reduce the corps 
propre from the culturally encountered soma of a psy-
che to the naturalistic object of anatomy and physi-
ology. Merleau-Ponty was especially concemed with 
naturalism in biology and psychology. Later concems 
in French phenomenology with history, politics, and 
feminism show an appreciation of the lived world as 
cultural and of human existence as more than the in-
tellects of natural scientists. "The world is more than 
nature" might be an apt slogan. After all, human life or 
existence always already includes valuing and willing 
and its situations and worlds always already include 

484 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the cultural characteristics that are constituted in those 
strata oflife; naturalism can only pretend that they are 
not there. 
With the work of HANS-GEORG GADAMER and others, 
including PAUL RICCEUR and JOSEPH J. KOCKELMANS, and 
in complex connections with other approaches, includ-
ing STRUCTURALISM and CRITICAL THEORY, HERMENEU-
TICAL PHENOMENOLOGY has additionally COntributed !O 
the philosophy ofthe human sciences and the appreci-
ation of cultural life and cultural worlds as such. But 
that phenomenological alternatives to naturalism are 
positively interested in natural science is clear in the 
work of PATRICK HEELAN as well as Kockelmans for 
hermeneutica! phenomenology, JOHN COMPTON for ex-
istential phenomenology, ELISABETH STROKER for con-
stitutive phenomenoJogy, and HEDWIG CONRAD-MARTIUS 
for REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY. DON IHDE Jeads the cur-
ren! hermeneutica! phenomenology oftechnology. 
Systematically speaking, the alternatives to natu-
ralism among phenomenologists are oftwo sorts. The 
worldly or mundane alternative consists essentially in 
an appreciation of cultural worlds and ali that this 
entails in the way of theories of understanding and 
interpretation, emphasis on values, purposes, teleolo-
gies, personalities, communities, traditions, etc. This 
position is epitomized in the widespread phenomen-
ological contention that the human sciences are prior 
to the natural sciences. At least tacitly, the assump-
tion in mundane or worldly phenomenology is that ali 
genuine philosophical problems can be solved from 
intramundane standpoints. In this perspective, the dif-
ference between philosophy and science may be only 
that between the one "generality" and the numerous 
specialities. Schutz's CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY OF 
THE NATURAL ATTITUDE seeks phiJosophically to found 
historical and social science upon psychology in the 
same way that many philosophers of natural science 
would found biology upon chemistry and physics, but 
it is sometimes mistaken for sociology, while he in-
creasingly Jooked to a PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 
The other non-naturalistic phenomenological philo-
sophical alternative is transcendental. The modem 
project of grounding ali specialized theoretical, nor-
mative, and practica! disciplines in conscious life goes 
back to Descartes and can be seen in MODERN PHILOS-
OPHY, BRITISH EMPIRICISM, KANT, FICHTE, and others. It 
would be an error to see an exclusive historical con-
nection ofthis modern project in first philosophy with 
naturalism and the rise ofnaturalistic science and tech-
nology as essential, for Husserl and others in transcen-
dental phenomenologycomfortably include the human 
sciences (and cultural scientific methods) along with 
the formal sciences of logic and mathematics and the 
physical and biologica! natural sciences among the pos-
itive disciplines in need of transcendental grounding. 
The primary difference between the mundane and 
transcendental alternatives to naturalism concerns the 
status of conscious life. Secondary issues include 
whether the life in question is exclusively human or 
includes nonhuman species and whether it is funda-
mentally personal or communal. But can conscious 
life have the always already established belief in its 
own being-in-the-world suspended, so that the prob-
lems of grounding the whole of the world in a part of 
it are dissolved, or must conscious life be considered 
only as part ofthe world, so that the modern transcen-
dental task of grounding the world, nature included, 
must be abandoned? In other respects, there are many 
convergences between the mundane and transcenden-
tal versions of phenomenology on various issues, ali 
of which are, in various ways, opposed to naturalism 
but not natural science. 
In decades to come, as natural sciences and natu-
ral scientific technologies will continue their astonish-
ing progress, phenomenologists will constantly need 
to examine how these disciplines originate from and 
then ha ve social and environmental impacts back upon 
basic cultural life. Work in value theory, ethics, and 
philosophical politics, along with the philosophies of 
human and formal as well as natural science and tech-
nology, will be indispensable. Naturalism will not go 
away.

THE NETHERLANDS AND FLANDERS 
Two 
dominant movements can be distinguished within the 
philosophical climate in The Netherlands and Flanders 
at the beginning ofthe 20th century with respect to the 
reception ofphenomenology. Neo-Thomism was dom-
inant within the Catholic circle and neo-Kantianism 
was dominant outside this circle. This climate deter-
mined the reception of phenomenology until the end 
ofWorld War II. 
From a neo.:rhomistic point of view, which had its 
firm base in the Higher Institute ofPhilosophy at Leu-
ven, the central question was whether Husserl 's pheno-
menology is reconcilable with a realistic metaphysics. 
In 191 O in the first French article on Husserl, Mgr. 
Leon Noei (1878-1953) considered the Logische Un-
tersuchungen (1900---190 1) as an effective refutation 
ofpsychologism. He notes with satisfaction that in the 
Prolegomena Husserl defends the traditional Scholas-
tic logic against the customary contempt of that time. 
Some decades !ater, in his capacity as president of the 
Higher Institute, Msgr. Noei would be one ofthe peo-
p1e who made the foundation ofthe Husserl Archives 
possible. 
During the first decades ofthe 20th century ali com-
mentators agreed that Husserl had turned toward an 
idealistic philosophy. The debate now focused on the 
question whether Husserl's phenomenology had been 
an idealistic philosophy from the outset or whether 
phenomenology, taken as a purely descriptive method, 
could be separated from the idealistic doctrine. Some 
participants in this discussion were Joseph Marechal 
(1878-1944 ), who claimed that such a separation was 
not possible, and Rene Kremer (1887-1934), who de-
fended the other option. 
Outside the Catholic ci rele Husserl 's phenomen-
ology was mainly received in a neo-Kantian perspec-
tive. The University of Groningen, where Gerard Hey-
mans (1837-1930) taught at the time, held a compe-
tition in 1922 on A Comparative Study Concerning 
Plata s Doctrine of Ideas and Husserl s Doctrine of an 
Intuition of Essences. Henri Schmidt Degener ( 1891-
1969) wrote his doctoral dissertation for this occasion. 
His study relies heavi1y on Paul Natorp's (1854-1924) 
interpretation of both Husserl and Plato. He claims 
that after the Logische Untersuchungen, Husserl's 
thought developed more and more in a Kantian di-
rection. He concludes that in Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 ( 1913 ), Husserl 's essences can no longer be 
distinguished from ideas in the Kantian sense. 
HENDRIKJ. ros was one ofthe first in The Netherlands 
and Flanders to apply the phenomenological method 
to a specific scientific discipline, namely linguistics. In 
the 1920s he studied under Heinrich Rickert ( 1863-
1936) in Heidelberg and under Husserl in Freiburg. 
In his doctoral thesis, Kritische Studien iiber philol-
ogische Methode ( 1923 ), he stresses the necessity of 
a phenomenological, i.e., a descriptive analysis of the 
ways in which, in this case, linguistic phenomena are 
given. He opposes this newly discovered method to 
the constructive method, which he attributes to Paul 
Natorp, among others. In a contribution to the volume 
of the Revue Internationale de Philosophie dedicated 
to Husserl in 1939, Pos pointed out the importance of 
Husserl 's discovery of the LIFEWORLD as the founda-
tion for ali scientific knowledge, including that about 
LANGUAGE. Pos also organized Husserl's visit to The 
Netherlands in 1928, where he gave his so-called "Am-
sterdamer Vortrage" (Amsterdam lectures), published 
in 1962 in Husserliana, volume IX. 
The development ofphenomenology in The Nether-
lands and Flanders gained momentum after World War 
Il. This impetus was called EXISTENTIAL PHENOMEN-
OLOGY. Important sources of inspiration wcre MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER, GABRIEL MARCEL, and JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, but 
above ali the influence ofMAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY can 
hardly be overestimated. Existential phenomenology

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
not only became the dominant movement within the 
philosophical climate of The Netherlands and Flan-
ders, but also determined the way in which Husserl's 
phenomenology was interpreted. 
The work of ALPHONSE DE WAELHENS can illustrate 
this. In some articles dating from the 1930s he re-
jected Husserl's phenomenology: it cannot even serve 
as a philosophical method because as such it inevitably 
leads to idealism. According to de Waelhens the same 
holds true, mutatis mutandis, for Heidegger. After 
World War II, however, he strikes a different note. 
He then stresses the importance of the discovery of 
the Jifeworld, i.e., the existential reservoir of ali sense 
that is to be constituted. Because of this discovery it 
is possible, according to de Waelhens, for phenomen-
ology to overcome the traditional opposition between 
realism and idealism. He repeatedly defended the pos-
sibility of interpreting Husserl 's phenomenology along 
these lines, for instance during the second and third 
International Colloquia on Phenomenology. The pre-
refiective experience of an anonymous subject is also 
the central theme of La philosophie et les experiences 
naturelles ( 1961 ). De Waelhens played an important 
ro le as a mediator between phenomenology in FRANCE 
and GERMANY. Besides severa] extensive studies on 
Heidegger, he translated, partly in collaboration with 
WALTER BIEMEL and RUDOLF BOEHM, a number of Hei-
degger's works into French. Finally, the monograph on 
his greatest source of inspiration- Une philosophie 
de l'ambiguite: L 'existentialisme de Maurice Merleau-
Ponty ( 1951)- should be mentioned here. 
Numerous philosophers threw themselves into ex-
istential phenomenology during the first decades after 
World War II. Within the scope ofthis survey only a few 
names can be mentioned. NICO WIM LUIJPEN acquired 
international fame with his Existentiele fenomenologie 
( 1959; Existential Phenomenology, 1960), which was 
translated into severa! Janguages and reprinted severa] 
times. In this work he calls the notion of existence or 
INTENTIONALITY the fa it primiti[ of existential pheno-
menology. He defines this notion as the unity ofrecip-
rocal implication ofhuman being and world. With this, 
it is possible to escape the dichotomy between realism 
and idealism. Luijpen points out that the openness of 
the subject is not restricted to the world. It includes the 
possibility of a relation to the transcendent absolute, 
God. He elaborates on this point in Phenomenology 
and Metaphysics (1965; Fenomenologie en metafYs-
ica, 1966). 
Closely related to the position of Luijpen is that 
of REMIGIUS KWANT. Together with Luijpen he de-
fended existential phenomenology against the objec-
tion, mainly from neo-Thomistic opponents, that it ex-
cludes the possibility of a metaphysics. Kwant's main 
source ofinspiration was Merleau-Ponty. He wrote sev-
era! studies on his philosophy, for instance on his !ater 
work in From Phenomenology to Metaphysics ( 1966). 
In other works he also relies on the oeuvre ofthe French 
phenomenologist, for instance in Mens en expressie, in 
het licht van de wijsbegeerte van Merleau-Ponty ( 1968; 
Phenomenology of Expression, 1969). 
REINOUT BAKKER also paid a great deal of attention 
to Merleau-Ponty's thought. He translated some ofhis 
work into Dutch. He was also the first and only one in 
The Netherlands and Flanders to write a general history 
of phenomenology, De geschicdenis van het fenome-
nologische denken (The history of phenomenological 
thought, 1964 ), in which he deals with MAX SCHELER as 
well as Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty. 
JOSEPH J. KOCKELMANS was the first in The Nether-
Jands and Flanders to write a general introduction 
to Husserl 's thought, Edmund Husserl. Een inleiding 
tot zijn fenomenologie ( 1963; A First Introduction to 
Husserl 's Phenomenology, 1967). He concludes this 
book with an attempt to settle the issue concerning the 
realistic or idealistic character of Husserl's doctrine. 
He argues in favour of the unity in the development 
of Husserl 's thought by stressing the different attitudes 
from which Husserl thinks. Because the transcendental 
attitude is most fundamental for Husserl, his pheno-
menology can be considered an idealistic doctrine. But 
this does not affect the lasting value ofhis analysis from 
a phenomenological or existential point ofview, if only 
the phenomenological reduction is seen as a reduction 
from the cultural world to the lifeworld. Kockelmans 
has also written a study of Husserl 's phenomenological 
psychology entitled Defenomenologische psychologie 
volgens Husserl. Een historisch-critische studie ( 1964; 
Edmund Husserl 's Phenomenological Psychology: A 
Historico-Critical Study, 1967) and an introduction to 
Heidegger's thought, Martin Heidegger. Een inleiding 
in zijn denken ( 1962; Martin Heidegger: A First Intro-
duction to his Philosophy, 1965). In addition to these 
historical studies Kockelmans has also written severa!

books in the phiiosophy of NATURAL SC!ENCE- for in-
stance, Phaenomenologie en natuurwetenschap ( 1962; 
Phenomenology and Physical Science, 1966). 
In the 1950s and 1960s phenomenologywas applied 
to the sciences on a large scale, particularly the HUMAN 
SCIENCES. It has often been said that the most original 
contributions to phenomenology in The Netherlands 
and Flanders lie in this field. The so-called Dutch, 
or more specifically, the Utrecht school in particular 
gained an international reputation. The members of 
this school applied the phenomenological method to 
PSYCHOLOGY and PSYCHIATRY. 
The central figure around whom this school was 
formed was FREDERIK J. J. BUYTENDIJK. His interest in 
phenomenology was first aroused in the 1920s, when 
he regu!ariy met MAX SCHELER and HELMUTH PLESSNER. 
On the occasion ofBuytendijk 's sixty-fifth birthday his 
companions offered him a collection of essays, Per-
soon en Wereld. Bijdragen tot de Phaenomenologis-
che Psychologie (Person and world: Contributions to 
phenomenological psychology, 1953). The main theme 
ofthis phenomenological psychology is human situat-
edness. Human beings can on1y be understood from 
their lifeworld. On the one hand, this is a world in 
which one finds onese1f, and on the other, it is a world 
that one actively constitutes. Much attention is paid 
to the human BODY and HISTORY. The point of depar-
ture and the touchstone ofthis psychology is everyday 
lived experience. It finds its theoretical justification in 
the philosophical notion of intentionality, because this 
notion refers to the indissoluble bond between human 
beings and the world. 
The leading members ofthis Utrecht school are the 
psychiatrists HENRICUS RUMKE and JAN HENDR!K VAN DEN 
BERG; the theorist of EDUCAT!ON MARTINUS LANGEVELD; 
and the psychoiogists DAVID VAN LENNEP and JOHANNES 
LINSCHOTEN. Two other collections of essays with which 
this school presented itself are Situation: Contribu-
tions to Phenomenologica! Psychology and Psycho-
Pathology ( 1954) and Rencontre, Encounter. Begeg-
nung ( 1957). 
The concept of phenomenological psychology 
this group advocated was not undisputed. STEPHAN 
STRASSER, Buytendijk's colleague at the University 
of Nijmegen, was never a member of this school. 
Without explicitly referring to this group, he wams 
in his Fenomenologie en empirische menskunde. Bij-
drage tot een nieuw ideaal van wetenschappelijk-
heid ( 1962; Phenomenology and the Human Sciences, 
1963) against the dangers of what he calls phenomen-
ological impressionism. In the Dutch edition of this 
book he predicts that a fu ture historian of phi1osophy 
will conclude that an incomplete knowledge ofpheno-
menology has led especially in The Netherlands to a 
conception of phenomenology that can be expressed 
in two words: I see! In this connection the Husser-
lian phrase Bilderbuchphănomenologie (picture book 
phenomenology) is often used. 
Johannes Linschoten, once considered to be Buy-
tendijk's most talented pupi!, eventually tumed away 
from phenomenological psychology. This did not 
mean, however, that he renounced phenomenology 
altogether. In his article "Die Unumgiinglichkeit der 
Phanomenologie" ( 1962) he argues that so-called 
phenomenological psychology, which concentrates on 
describing the pre-reflective sphere of experience, co-
incides with phenomenology in general. This pheno-
menology, being a philosophical discipline, is relevant 
to psychology, but Linschoten now reserves the term 
"psychology" for the scientific endeavorthat strives for 
objective knowledge by means of formalizing, quan-
tifying, and experimental analyses. With this vision 
Linschoten anticipated the actual developments. In the 
mid 1960s phenomenological psychology rapidly lost 
ground to experimental psychology. 
Existential phenomeno1ogy as a whole lost its dom-
inant position in the philosophical climate of The 
Netherlands and Flanders during the 1960s.lt was con-
fronted with the rise of various new movements such 
as CRITICAL THEORY and STRUCTURALISM. Some authors 
who commented on these confrontations from a the-
matic point of view are, besides the above-mentioned 
K want and Bakker, JAN BROEKMAN and KEES STRUYKER 
BOUDIER. 
In 1966 and 1967, the confrontation with ANALYTIC 
PHILOSOPHY led to a fierce controversy, in which nu-
merous authors participated. One of them was coR-
NELIUS VAN PEURSEN. In Fenomenologie en analytische 
filosofie (1968; Phenomenology and AnaZvtic Philos-
ophy, 1972) he defends phenomenology by pointing 
out the convergence between developments in ana-
lytic and phenomenological philosophy. In both move-
ments an awareness has broken through that the logica! 
realm cannot be separated from the realm of contin-

488 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
gency, i.e., in the case of analytical philosophy, OR-
DINARY LANGUAGE, and in the case of phenomenology, 
the lifeworld. More recently, Herman Philipse's (195 1) 
doctoral dissertation on De fundering van de logica in 
Husserls 'Logische Untersuchungen '(The foundations 
oflogic in Husserl 's Logica! Investigations, 1983) was 
motivated by the question whether this work is still 
valuable from a analytic philosophical point ofview. 
Another participant in this discussion was THEO DE 
BOER. His defense of Husserl's phenomenology rests 
partly on stressing Husserl's own phenomenological 
orientation, which he distinguishes from the domi-
nant existentially oriented interpretation of Husserl's 
phenomenology. This point is elaborated in De on-
twikkelingsgang in het denken van Husserl (1966; 
The Development of Husserl s Thought, 1978). In this 
study De Boer argues that many Husserl interpreta-
tions approach his philosophy too much from existing 
philosophical movements. Consequently they misun-
derstand its unique character. These approaches often 
result in making absolute what is only a stage in the de-
velopment of Husserl 's thought. He argues for the unity 
of Husserl's oeuvre as being a unity of development. 
The same major problems are dealt with by Husserl in 
an ever more radical manner, ultimately leading to a 
transcendental idealistic solution. 
The impact of Heidegger's philosophy on philo-
sophical Iife in The Netherlands and F1anders is doc-
umented by many interpretive monographs and es-
says. After de Waehlens, it was especially SAMUEL 
ussELING who wrote authoritative studies of Heideg-
ger, beginning with his doctoral dissertation on Hei-
degger. Denken en danken, geven en zijn (Heidegger: 
Thinking and thanking, giving and being, 1 962). Later 
he investigated the relations between phenomenology, 
HERMENEUTICS, and rhetoric in Retoriek en Filosofie. 
Wat gebeurt er wanneer er gesproken wordt? (1975; 
Rhetoric and Philosophy in Conflict: An Historical 
Survey, 1976). Theo De Boer published an important 
study in 1978 on Heidegger's critique ofHusserl in Sein 
und Zeit. PAUL RICCEUR became known to the Dutch pub-
lic through the edition ofthree antho1ogies in Dutch by 
ADRIAAN PEPERZAK in 1968, 1970, and 197 J. 
The first Dutch translation ofEMMANUEL LEVINAS ap-
peared in 1966. It was a rather deficient translation of 
Totalite et infini and did not attract much attention. A 
very good new translation with notes by Theo De Boer 
was published in 1987. In 1969 Adriaan Peperzak pub-
lished Het menselijk gelaat (The human face), a collec-
tion of central texts by Levinas translated into Dutch. 
In his own work, Peperzak has defended a version of 
phenomenology in which elements of Hegel, Heideg-
ger, and Levinas are combined with elements of the 
metaphysical tradition. This can be seen in Verlangen 
(Desire, 1971) and in Weeftels (Textures, 1974). U en Ik 
(You and I, 1976) tries to overcome the differences be-
tween Levinas's descriptions of intersubjectivity and 
Hegel 's analysis of the master-slave relation. In Sys-
tematiek en geschiedenis (1981; System and History 
in Philosophy, 1986), he defends a phenomeno1ogical 
perspective on the unity of thematic philosophy and 
the history ofphi1osophy. 
Finally, there is the way in which phenomenology 
is dealt with from a deconstructive point of view. The 
guide here is of COUfSe JACQUES DERRIDA. RUDOLF BERNET 
has paid considerable attention to Derrida's Husserl 
reading. A number of articles bear witness to this. In 
"Is the Present ever Present? Phenomeno1ogy and the 
Metaphysics ofPresence" ( 1982), for example, Bemet 
offers a deconstructive reading of Husserl 's analysis of 
time-consciousness. He argues that Husserl carne to a 
result that could undermine his program, which can be 
characterized as a metaphysics of presence. However, 
Husserl recoiled from these results and did not want 
to accept the consequences of his own analysis. Some 
of Bernet's essays on Husserl and the ways in which 
his phenomenology ha ve been interpreted are collected 
in La vie du sujet: Recherches sur 1 'interpretation de 
Husserl dans la phenomenologie (1994). 
A survey ofphenomenology in The Netherlands and 
Flanders, or for that matter ofphenomenology in gen-
eral, is not complete without mentioning the Husserl 
Archives in Leuven, Be1gium. One name is closely 
Jinked to the Archives, that of HERMAN LEO VAN BRE DA. 
He rescued Husserl 's Nachlass. This resulted in the 
foundation ofthe Archives in 1939. Van Breda initi-
ated the publication of Husserl 's collected works in the 
series Husserliana, and the series of studies in pheno-
menology called Phaenomenologica. Up to now thirty 
volumes ha ve been published in the Husserliana series. 
The complete series will contain some forty volumes. 
Furthermore, Van Breda was the initiator of severa! in-
ternational colloquia on phenomenology in the 1950s 
and 1960s. Sin ce the death of Van Breda, Samuel IJs-

THE NETHERLANDS AND FLANDERS

seling bas been director ofthe Husserl Archives. 
In the course of time the Archives have known 
numerous collaborators who edited volumes in the 
Husserliana series. Restricting ourselves to those who 
worked or still work in The Netherlands and Flan-
ders on a more permanent basis, the following names 
can be mentioned. Stephan Strasser, already referred 
to above, was the editor ofthe first volume, Cartesian-
ische Meditationen und Pariser Vortriige, published in 
1950. Walter and MARLY BIEMEL edited six volumes. 
Rudolf Boehm edited three volumes; since 1974 he 
has been co-responsible for the series. KARL SCHUH-
MANN edited the new edition of Jdeen zu einer reinen 
Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen Philoso-
phie I in 1976. Furthermore, he edited the first volume 
in the series Husserliana-Dokumente, entitled Husserl-
Chronik (1977), a very detailed survey of Husserl's 
philosophical life. Together with his wife, Elisabeth 
Schuhmann, he has edited the third title in this se-
ries, Husserl's ten volume Briefwechsel (1994). He is 
one of the founders of the journal Husserl Studies. At 
present he teaches at the University ofUtrecht. ULLRICH 
MELLE edited two volumes in the Husserliana series. At 
present he teaches at the Katho1ieke Universiteit Leu-
ven, as does the above-mentioned RudolfBernet, who 
is responsible for the fourth series in English, Edmund 
Husserl: Collected Works. 
Some of the authors mentioned ha ve made sugges-
tions concerning the future of phenomenology. One 
of them is Stephan Strasser. Having been occupied 
with phenomenology for some fifty years, an occupa-
tion that led among many other studies to Das Gemut 
(1956; PhenomenologyofFeeling, 1977), he asks him-
self in Welt im Widerspruch (posthumously published 
in 1991) what the significance ofphenomenologyis to-
day. According to Strasser, phenomenology, Husserl 's 
phenomenology included, is a philosophy of experi-
ence rather than a reftective philosophy. The possibil-
ity of reflection presupposes an original contact with 
the world, and experience brings about this contact. 
Strasser's answer to the question ofthe most fundamen-
tal experience differs from that of Husserl. According 
to Strasser, perception cannot be the fundamental mode 
of experience, not even inner perception, because its 
results are inevitably ambivalent. In the search for a 
fundamental experience he finds support in Levinas. 
The most fundamental experience has to be an ethical 
experience that shatters the noetic-noematic scheme, 
an experience that consists of an unselfish turn toward 
the other. This foundation is in a way reconcilable 
with Husserl's own intentions because, according to 
Strasser, these pertain to ETHICS. 
In an article published in 1985 and included in his 
Van Brentano tot Levi nas. Studies over defenomenolo-
gie (From Brentano to Levinas: Studies on phenomen-
ology, 1989), Theo de Boer evaluates the phenomen-
ological method, especially EIDETIC METHOD. He con-
cludes, in accordance with Heidegger, that essences 
should not be taken as objects, but instead as the frames 
or conditions of possibility of ali experience. These 
frames themselves, however, can be experienced, and 
thus the element of Husserl 's intuitionism is preserved. 
De Boer agrees with Rica:ur that phenomenology is 
not only the abject of criticism by HERMENEUTICS, or 
for that matter, by a deconstmctive reading. It also is 
the foundation for the possibility of criticism insofar as 
phenomenology, on the level of perception, discloses 
the dimension of sense along which hermeneutics as 
well as a deconstmctive reading li ve.

KITARO NISHIDA 
The founder of the so-
called "Kyoto school" of philosophy, Kitaro Nishida 
(1870-1945) was called to a professorship at the Im-
perial University in Kyoto in 1911. Through his teach-
ing and his writings he played such a preeminent ro le 
in Japan's academic philosophy that many talented 
philosophers gathered around him. Nishida is almost 
the only philosopher in Japan since the Meiji Restora-
tion ( 1868) to build up an independent and original 
philosophical system. He introduced phenomenology 
into JAPAN, and his Students- HAJIME TANABE, SHUZO 
KUKI, GOICHI MIYAKE, TOKURY0 YAMAUCHI, and others-
were so attracted to phenomenology that they went on 
to study with EDMUND HUSSERL, MARTIN HEIDEGGER, and 
EUGEN FINK in Freiburg im Breisgau. 
With his strong desire for knowledge, Nishida, in the 
Far East, steeped himself in the European and Ameri-
can philosophy ofhis time. He was the first in Japan to 
recognize the important meaning of the philosophers 
of that time, such as HENRI BERGSON, Husserl, Alexius 
Meinong ( 1853-1920), FRANZ BRENTANO, and WILLIAM 
JAMES. His sympathy with James's philosophy is al-
ready to be found in his diaries before the appearance 
of his first work. And he retained a strong affinity to 
Bergson ali his life. This is not to deny that Husserl, too, 
had a deep and strong affinity to James (e.g., the con-
cept ofthe "fringe") and Bergson (e.g., ROMAN INGAR-
DEN showed that the "dun?e" ofBergson is very similar 
to Husserl 's concept of the stream of consciousness ). 
Nishida was born near Kanazawa. He experienced 
the rise of the Japanese empire and died in 1945 as 
it fell. He was eleven years younger than Husserl, 
whose first important work, Logische Untersuchun-
gen, appeared at the turn ofthe century (1900-1901). 
Nishida 's first major work appeared in the year 1911, 
entitled Zen no kenyku (A study of good). This work 
already evinces his characteristic thought. He was 
the first in Japan to present Husserl's phenomen-
ology in its connection with neo-Kantianism and with 
the Brentano school. His papers, e.g., "Ninshikiron 
niokerujun-ronri-ha no shutyo nitui te" (On the position 
ofthe purely logica! school in epistemology, 1911) and 
"Gendai niokeru risoshugi no tetsugaku" (The idealis-
tic philosophy of the present, 1917) are representative 
works of that time. 
Another simi1arity between Husserl and Nishida is 
their JifeJong interest in LOGIC and MATHEMATICS. It is 
well known that Husserl began his studies and his aca-
demic career as a mathematician and that his disser-
tation, Beitriige zur Theorie der Variationsrechnung 
(1882), and his Habilitationsschrift, Ober den Begriff 
der Zahl (1887), published in Philosophie der Arith-
metik ( 1891 ), dealt specifically with the foundations 
ofmathematics. On the other hand, Nishida had some 
hesitation about choosing his professional field. He 
chose philosophy because the problem of life was of 
the greatest interest to him. But he retained his interest 
in the foundations of mathematics throughout his life, 
as the countless letters to Shimomura, his pupi! and a 
philosopher of mathematics, show. 
There is also a similarity in their modes ofthinking. 
Tokuryu Yamauchi, his eminent student and pheno-
menologist, who studied with Husserl in Freiburg and 
was the successor to Nishida's chair at Kyoto Univer-
sity, called Nishida "a man who thinks as he writes." 
Likewise it bas been said: "Husserl ne pensait qu 'en 
ecrivant." Both philosophers dedicated their lives to 
the analysis ofthe "matters themselves." It is no exag-
geration to say that they died thinking and writing. 
Nishida related himself to Husserl 's phenomen-
ology in a somewhat different manner than did the 
philosophers ofthe Kyoto school, such as HAJIME TAN-
ABE, TOKURY0 YAMAUCHI, GOICHI MIYAKE, KEIJI NISHITANI, 
and others. As Nishida was the founder of this school 
and a contemporary ofHusserl, Bergson, and James, he 
considered phenomenology to be valuable and a pos-
sibility of philosophical thinking, but he maintained 
a critica! distance from it. In addition, it should be 
mentioned that Nishida practiced Zen meditation in 
temples. He built up his system of philosophy on the 
experience of Zen meditation, which is expressed in 
his concept of pure experience. This concept was de-
rived from the experience of sanmai, e.g., samiidi, in 
Zen BUDDHISM. Thus Keiji Nishitani bas said rightly: 
"Nishida's philosophy owes its originality to the East 
Asian spiritual tradition, that is, to Buddhism."

KITARO NISHIDA

Nishida's attitude toward Husserl 's phenomenology 
is expressed critically with respect to the essence of 
consciousness. Nishida poses the question ofhow con-
sciousness is determined to be consciousness, i.e., the 
question ofthe essence of consciousness. Nishida was 
dissatisfied with Husserl's phenomenology on the fol-
lowing points: (!) its subjectivism, that is, the circum-
stance that consciousness is regarded only as an indi-
vidual existing entity and experience as always belong-
ing to an individual person; (2) the difference between 
the subject and the object is presupposed as already 
self-evident; and (3) comprehension, feeling, and will 
are considered tobe only different levels of conscious-
ness. 
In actuality, the question is put in such a way 
that while phenomenology defines the essence of con-
sciousness as consciousness of something, that is, as 
directedness toward something, it does not go on to 
inquire into the essence of INTENTIONALITY. It seems 
to Nishida that insofar as the essence or basis of con-
sciousness is not discussed, phenomenology is not ad-
equately established. That Nishida maintained this ob-
jection until his death is clear in his letters to his dis-
ciples, RISAKU MUTA! and GOICHI MIYAKE. Nishida posed 
the question as to the essence of consciousness radi-
cally and found a way out of solipsism. 
A Study of Good has four topics: ( 1) pure experi-
ence, (2) real being, (3) the good, and (4) religion. The 
concept of "pure experience" also appears in William 
James, but with Nishida this concept is independent 
of the historical connection. This work is very near to 
phenomenological research in the sense of its descrip-
tive way ofthinking. 
The concept of pure experience is a concept of im-
mediate consciousness and thus a psychological con-
cept insofar as it is about a kind of consciousness. 
Yet it is never a subjectivistic concept. Investigation 
into true being begins with doubting everything that 
one can doubt. This doubting approach corresponds to 
the phenomenological method of EPOCHE. By means 
of doubting as his method, Nishida gains "immedi-
ate consciousness, which one cannot doubt." This is 
a fact of intuitive experience, namely, knowledge of 
the phenomenon of consciousness. But the conscious 
phenomenon is an essence prior to the difference be-
tween subject and object, thus before the realm ofthe 
subject-object relation. "The appearance-phenomenon 
of what is present and the becoming-consciousness 
of what is present are simply the same." This recalls 
Husserl 's theory of the difference and indifference of 
thing-appearance and the appearing act. 
The so-called externa! thing, i.e., the thing-
phenomenon, is not transcendent and independent 
of our consciousness. The immediate primordial fact 
is the consciousness-phenomenon, never the thing-
phenomenon. Our BODY is a part of our consciousness-
phenomenon. Consciousness is not in the body, 
but vice versa, the body is in the consciousness-
phenomenon. The consciousness-phenomenon is ali 
there is. The thing-phenomenon is only that as-
pect of the consciousness-phenomenon that is com-
mon to everyone and unchanged. The consciousness-
phenomenon does not consist of the soul separated 
from the thing. 
"Experience" means to know the fact, after be-
coming aware of it and putting prejudices aside. 
"Pure" means the state of experience per se, without 
adding thought or judgment. Thus experience is pre-
predicative experience. Pure experience is prior to the 
relation of consciousness to its object. According to 
Nishida it is something prior to directedness-toward-
something. It is the original experience per se on which 
intentionality is grounded. 
Nishida reftects on the nature of pure experience. 
This reftection is similar to phenomenological reftec-
tion. Although pure experience is implicitly complex, 
it is always a simple fact in the moment of percep-
tion. When past-consciousness gains a new mean-
ing in present-consciousness, the experience of the 
past-consciousness is not the same as past conscious-
ness itself, even when it is only a repetition of past-
consciousness. That which is analyzed by present con-
sciousness is stiU not the same as present conscious-
ness. This problematics is the same as Husserl 's in his 
late philosophy of time-constitution. 
Nishida grounds the purity and immediacy of pure 
experience on the fact of the unity of concrete con-
sciousness. "Consciousness actually forms a system," 
he says. This concept of the system of consciousness 
is similar to Husserl 's concept of the horizon, which is 
expressed as the wholeness of the phenomenological 
consciousness, the world. Consciousness per se is for 
Nishida a chaotic unity from which various manifold 
states of consciousness differentiate themselves. 

492 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Even in the case of externa! perception, attention 
is not directed by the externa! thing, but by an un-
conscious unifying power of consciousness. Attention, 
turned toward the externa! thing, is actually directed by 
the unity of consciousness. By means of the concept 
of the "unity of consciousness" (the unifying power of 
consciousness), Nishida designates consciousness as a 
system that develops itself out of itself. Thus think-
ing overcomes PSYCHOLOGISM. There is neither inward 
nor outward experience. Consciousness is, as a unified 
system, true being. For Nishida consciousness is an 
ontologica! concept. 
Pure experience shows itself as present-conscious-
ness. In the present it is the unity of consciousness, 
which, as an attentive gaze, is itself the foca! point 
of consciousness. MEANING (sense) or judgment results 
from the present-consciousness's distancing itselffrom 
the unity of itself. Thereby the present-consciousness 
becomes a past-consciousness, i.e., a represented con-
sciousness. Thence a difference between subject and 
abject comes to expression. Consciousness estranged 
(alienated) from itself is united in the greater con-
sciousness by means of now-consciousness. Pure ex-
perience shows itself as present-consciousness. In the 
present it is unifying. Therefore meaning (sense) or 
judgment is based on the interruption of the unity of 
consciousness. Yet the interruption is produced by the 
opposition between present-consciousness and past-
consciousness. It is phenomenologically understand-
able that Nishida regards consciousness as a system, 
but not that he explains two modes of consciousness, 
present and past regarding consciousness, through 
consciousness-unity and its interruption. 
Thinking is first of ali an act that brings a relation-
ship to unification. In judgment, the fact of original 
pure experience is analyzed and developed into sub-
ject and predicate. Judgment is in the deepest sense 
the self-division of primordial ( originary) being. Be-
hind every judgment !ies the experience of that which 
it unifies. According to Nishida, in the background of 
purely logica! judgment there is intuitive pure expe-
rience. "The horse is galloping" is based on the pure 
experience in which the galloping horse appears as 
such. "Only when we have surrendered ourselves to 
the object ofthought and have lost our self in it, do we 
see thinking accomplished." 
That thinking develops itself out ofitself is a central 
thesis. Therefore Nishida's basic view ofTRuTH is that 
"truth will emerge by means of our always losing our 
subjective self and becoming something objective." 
His description ofthe self-differentiation oftrue being 
is carried out phenomenologically: the whole (as hori-
zon) appears at first implicitly. Its content differentiates 
itself and presents itself. When this self-differentiation 
oftrue being is accomplished, the whole oftrue being 
is actualized and perfected. In short, the One develops 
itself out of itself. 
The distinctiveness ofNishida's thought consists of 
the following points: ( 1) The basic experience, namely 
pure experience, is grasped metaphysically as true be-
ing. (2) The development of true being is regarded as 
a dialectica! movement. (3) The ground (basis) of the 
world and my ground are the same, i.e., the self. Phe-
nomenologists may assert, in objection to Nishida's 
thought, that he was metaphysically oriented from the 
beginning. Many objections may be raised against the 
presupposed dialectica! method and his assertion about 
the self in us and in the world. 
But if one chooses to evaluate Nishida's way of 
posing the question positively, one must remember 
that Husserl viewed the intentionality of conscious-
ness as unarguable. In intentiona! analyses the basic 
idea, "consciousness of something," is presupposed as 
self-understood. Nishida found Husserl's subjectivism 
inadequate. But if we could interpret the question of 
the essence of consciousness as the essence of inten-
tionality, we could conclude that the question as to the 
essence of consciousness is concerned with the scope 
ofthe relation between subject and abject. This scope 
is precisely that upon which the intentionality of con-
sciousness is based. With Nishida the question as to 
the essence of consciousness -
as a question about 
the scope of the relation- is: what is placed between 
the subject and the abject? He inquires into and seeks 
the bases of the relation of the two as such, which is 
precisely as a relation that is neither subject nor object. 
The relation as such is grasped as pure experience, 
which is the immediate consciousness of the unity of 
subject and object. 
When HEINRICH ROMBACH distinguishes the basic in-
tention of Heidegger's phenomenology from that of 
Husserl, Nishida's question as to the essence of inten-
tionality may be seen to have something in common 
with Heidegger's criticism of Husserl, for intention-

ality itself is a founded mode of being-in-tbe-world. 
Wbat Nisbida and Heidegger bave in common is tbe 
question of tbe mode of being of directedness to tbe 
object, tbus oftbe relation between subject and object. 
Tbe question of tbe mode of being of intentionality 
was carried out, in Nisbida, as tbe self-differentiation 
of pure experience, and in Heidegger as FUNDAMENTAL 
ONTOLOGY. Rombacb's interpretation oftbe fundamen-
tal concept of Husserl 's pbenomenology is quite close 
to Nisbida's pure experience wben be writes: "Tbey 
(subject and object) always bave to appear togetber, 
for tbe subject is notbing otber tban tbe structured lo-
cus of tbe capacity-for-presence of a particular kind of 
object and tbe object is notbing otber tban a manner of 
possible being-grasped by a subject." 
From tbe perspective ofbis late pbilosopby,A Study 
of Good is merely tbe beginning of Nisbida 's pbilos-
opby. Tbereafter, based on tbe tbeory of pure experi-
ence, be confronted tbe nea-Kantian pbilosopbers and 
carne to tbe point wbere pbilosopbical reflection could 
be carried out no further. Tbis spbere of irreflectiv-
ity involved tbe same problematics tbat Husserl found 
in bis very last years in connection witb tbe "living 
present." In Husserl too pbenomenological reflection is 
founded onan unreflective dimension. Nisbida tbougbt 
tbat tbis unreflective dimension is tbe absolute will 
(Jikaku niokeru chokkan ta hansei [Intuition and re-
flection in self-consciousness, 1917]). Tbis will must 
be transformed by action-intuition seeing (Hataraku 
mono kara mitru mana e [From tbat wbicb acts to tbat 
wbicb sees, 1927]). 
BODY and action-intuition are tbe tbemes in 
Nishida 's late pbilosopby. We could find some pbeno-
menological elements in tbese tbemes, but tbe bigb-
est point of bis late pbilosopby !ies in tbe tbougbt of 
"place" as absolute notbingness. In bis final stage of 
pbilosophical tbinking be elucidates tbe "place" (topos) 
and tbe "notbingness" oftbe world. In tbis connection, 
be analyzes tbe structure of tbe judgment. Wbat does 
not become tbe subject but becomes tbe predicate is 
tbe foundation of tbe consciousness as tbe wherein of 
consciousness, its essence. "Not to become tbe sub-
ject" means "not to be objectified." Consciousness is 
tbe place wberein objectification occurs. Tberefore, if 
consciousness as sucb becomes conscious, tben tbis 
is tbe objectified consciousness. Consciousness as act-
ing is always bidden in tbe darkness of tbe "place" of 
"notbingness." Consciousness is tbe "place" of"notb-
ingness" in wbicb being is. 
But consciousness is not really tbe "place" of ab-
solute "notbingness." Tbere is a most comprebensive 
notbingness, tbe ultimate wherein in wbicb conscious-
ness is tbe place oftbe notbingness tbat Nisbida names 
"absolute notbingness." Tberefore, tbere is a tbreefold 
stratification: (1) tbe "place" of being, (2) tbe "place" 
of relative notbingness, and (3) tbe "place" of absolute 
notbingness tbat is endless openness. Tbese places mir-
rar eacb otber. Tbis tbougbt about tbe tbreefold place 
again recalls tbe concept ofborizon. Husserl too defines 
tbe concept of borizon as tbe possibility of tbe scope 
and finds it in tbree dimensions: ( 1) tbe o uter borizon, 
(2) tbe inner borizon, and (3) tbe universal borizon, 
tbe borizon of borizons as tbe WORLD. Tbe borizon in 
Husserl bas tbe cbaracter of endless openness, but it 
bas notbing to do witb notbingness. 
Tbere are also similarities between Nisbida and 
Heidegger. For Heidegger tbe buman being is in tbe 
world: being-in-tbe-world. Tbe buman being or DA-
SEIN is out of itself, in tbe openness of tbe world. 
In tbis sense Nisbida's late pbilosopby is very simi-
lar to Heidegger's, even if be expressed critica! argu-
ments against Heidegger. For example, be objected tbat 
in Heidegger's pbilosopby tbe place wberein we will 
die will be found, but tbere is no place in wbicb we 
will be bom. Nishida also asks wbere tbe project (En-
twurf) comes from and in wbicb place tbe resoluteness 
(Entschlossenheit) occurs. He says tbat it is out of tbe 
self-consciousness ofnotbingness tbat we can explain 
tbese. 
Nisbida does not besitate to say: it is in my self 
tbat I know my self. Tbere is a definitive difference 
between "I know tbis tree" and "I know my self." "I 
know my self' is not adequately expressed, because 
it can be said about tbe objectified knowledge of my 
self. Tberefore Nisbida adds "in my self': "1 know 
my self in my self." Wbere tbis knowing act bappens, 
namely in my self, is very important. Tbe self is out of 
my self, existence. Tbis wherein is tberefore necessary, 
because I must distinguisb object-knowledge from self-
knowledge. Tbis expression "in my self' means tbe 
realm between tbe subject and tbe object, wberein I am. 
Tbe place of my self is illuminated by tbe openness of 
tbe place in wbicb my self is. Tbis place in wbicb my 
knowledge ofmy selfwill bappen is tbe world and tbis 

494 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
world is vertical, structured into absolute nothingness. 
This nothingness is the endless openness ofthe world. 
This world, the place of the absolute nothingness, is 
structured in vertical and horizontal ways such that 
the place of our selves, the world, has the manifold 
structured dimensions in depth and width of endless 
openness. 
Nishida's method is ultimately not phenomenologi-
cal but dialectica!. Therefore, what Goichi Miyake, 
Nishida's eminent disciple, said as a phenomenologist 
against Nishida's absolute reflection is very impor-
tant. It is precisely by virtue of absolute reflection 
that Nishida could insist that pure experience is the 
essence of consciousness. His inquiry into the realm 
ofthe subject-object or the absolute place ofnothing-
ness is the result ofhis absolute reflection. But he had 
to base it on the phenomenological theory of reflec-
tion. Reflection on our experience confirms that there 
is no reflection that- illuminating itself as a source of 
light- at the same time performs the act of reflection. 
In other words, with reflection there is always some-
thing dark left over that is not illuminated by reflection. 
Therefore, no philosophical reflection, insofar as it is 
based on experience-reflection, can escape naivete. Ac-
cording to Miyake, Nishida's absolute reflection is to 
be condemned as impossible. Miyake's objection leads 
to the final situation ofhuman being-in-the-world.

NOEMA 
TADASHI 0GAWA 
Kyoto University 
EDMUND HUSSERL introduced the 
technical term noema in Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 ( 1913) to denote the intentiona! abject of con-
scious experience. In that work Husserl describes the 
INTENTIONALITY of experience as a noesis-noema corre-
lation. These terms refer to the two moments (insepara-
ble parts) of the intentiona! experience. "N oesis" refers 
to a really inherent content of the "subject's" experi-
ence, viz., the meaning-intention that is directed toward 
an abject in a determinate manner and with certain po-
sitional or thetic characteristics. "Noema" refers to the 
intentiona! content of the experience, its "objective" 
correlate, i.e., the intentiona! abject or the object as in-
tended. These terms were meant to be used in the course 
of phenomenological descriptions. However, Husserl 
also gives us an account ofwhat they themselves mean 
and how they are to be used in phenomenological de-
scriptions. Unfortunately, his account, at least in ldeen 
1, is somewhat tentative and appears ambiguous. 
Husserl uses (1) the language of objects, suggest-
ing the noema is the intended abject itself but simply 
as intended (e.g., the perceived as such, as perceived); 
(2) the language of contents (irreal, ideal, or inten-
tiona! contents); and (3) the language of sense (i.e., 
language that connects the notion of noema to that of 
sense as a determinate mode ofpresentation). Because 
he used a new term and used it in an apparently am-

biguous way, exactly what he meant by the term and 
what he meant to denote with its use has become a sub-
ject of much controversy, especially among American 
philosophers concemed with the interrelation between 
so-called Continental and so-called ANALYTIC PHILOSO-
PHY's theories oflanguage. 
Husserl understood himself to be advancing a new 
theory of intentionality that avoided central difficul-
ties in the theories of intentionality known to him, 
especially FRANZ BRENTANo's. Husserl first explicitly 
developed his theories of meaning and of intentional-
ity in the Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900--1901 ). This 
work, even while disagreeing with Brentano, extends 
the latter's notion of what is best called "descriptive 
psychology." Husserl distinguishes the really inherent 
contents of an individual experience from its inten-
tiona! contents. The really inherent contents (e.g., the 
temporally successive phases of an experience and the 
sensation-contents) are the concrete parts that make up 
the real bcing of an experience as a psychic occurrence; 
they are peculiar to an individual experience and con-
stitute it as an intentiona! experience. The intentiona! 
contents belong to the experience by virtue of its being 
directed toward a particular objectivity; they present 
that objectivity in a determinate manner and can be 
common to many individual experiences. They are not 
really contained in the act; they are "ideal" or "irreal'' 
contents. 
More particularly, Husserl in the Untersuchungen 
distinguishes the object that is intended from the ob-
ject as it is intended in a particular experience, and 
he incorporates the latter into his notion of intentiona! 
contents. He then claims that the intentiona! content or 
the MEANING ideally contained within an experience is 
related to the experience itself as a species is related 
to its instantiation. Insofar as the intentiona! content 
is distinct from the real contents and insofar as the 
intentiona! content explains how different acts can be 
directed to the same object in the same determinate 
manner and with the same thetic character, the inten-
tiona! content must be separate from the real content 
of the act. However, insofar as the intentiona! content 
directs this particular act to its object, it must be really 
present in the act. This doubled character of intentiona! 
content is possible on the view that the intentiona! con-
tent or the meaning ofthe act is a species (an essence) 
instantiated in particular acts. 
495 
Husserl soon carne to recognize that phenomen-
ology could not properly be conceived merely as a 
descriptive psychology, for as such it was unable ade-
quately to address problems surrounding the nature of 
cognition. Consequently, he moved beyond descriptive 
psychology to an explicitly transcendental CONSTITU-
TIVE PHENOMENOLOGY. His understanding ofthe distinc-
tion between really inherent and intentiona! contents is 
transformed in his transcendental phenomenology, and 
comes to be expressed in the language of noesis and 
noema. The decisive moment in this transformation is 
Husserl's development ofthe theory ofthe phenomen-
ological or transcendental EPOCHE and transcendental 
attitude. The epoche or reduction is a methodological 
technique by which the philosopher suspends partic-
ipation in the general thesis of the natural attitude, 
the thesis or positing whereby the objects of our ex-
perience -
including the experiences themselves as 
refiected upon in the science of psychology- are real, 
worldly existents. The result ofthe performance ofthis 
suspension is that our attention is drawn away from 
objects simpliciter, as straightforwardly experienced, 
to the objects of experience simply insofar as they are 
objects experienced in a certain manner and with cer-
tain determinations. The performance ofthe reduction, 
in other words, invites the philosopher to concentrate 
attention on the intentiona! correlation between expe-
rience and its object precisely as experienced, i.e., the 
noesis-noema correlation. It is in Ideen 1 that Husserl 
first explicitly recast his theory of intentionality in the 
light ofthe reduction, and in so doing he fashioned the 
technical vocabulary ofnoesis and noema. 
The terms are first introduced as a way of explicating 
the distinction between the real and intentiona! con-
tents of experience. Husserl characterizes the noema 
(using ontologica! terms such as "the perceived [ ob-
ject] as perceived," "the remembered [object] as re-
membered," "the judged [state of affairs] as judged," 
or, more generally, "the intended [object] just as in-
tended." He analyzes the noema into three components, 
but his language now begins to vacillate between onto-
logica! and logica! terms. He speaks ofthe "full noema" 
within which he distinguishes the "characteristics" of 
the noema, i.e., its thetic character as well as its manner 
of givenness, from the "noematic core." The noematic 
core is also characterized as the "noematic sense," and 
is further analyzed into an object and its attributes or 

496 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
"predicates." The object, which Husserl calls the "de-
terminable" or "pure X," is the identica! object intended 
in the experience and the logica! subject ofthe "predi-
cates." 
Writing this article, for example, I am perceptually 
aware of the computer monitor. I see it as presenting 
the words I write, as sand-colored, as having a set of 
controls along its bottom, as resting on the shelf of a 
computer table to the left ofthe laser printer and above 
the dot-matrix printer and keyboard. I am aware of 
its base, of the unseen si des and rear of the monitor, 
and all the while I take for granted its existence as a 
real, physical entity in the world. To understand this 
perception in Husserl's terms, we might say that the 
determinable X of the perceptual noema is the spatial 
individual of a particular type; its noematic sense or 
core are those elements (including the determinable 
X) that present the object as such-and-such. Hence, 
the noematic sense ofthis experience is the "computer 
monitor as sand-colored, on the computer table, to the 
left of the laser printer, and so on." In the full noe ma 
is added to this noematic sense the object's manner of 
givenness (perceived) and the thetic characteristic that 
posits the perceived object as (presumptively) existent. 
Moreover, if outside my study I recall the look of the 
monitor and describe it to someone, both the noematic 
sense of the memorial experience on the hasis of which 
I offer my description and the noematic sense of the 
describing experience- which is at the same time the 
expressive sense of the description- are the same as 
the noematic sense of the perception. Furthermore, I 
continue to posit the real existence ofthe monitor, al-
though the manner of its givenness has changed from 
perceptual to memorial and presented in words. Were 
the monitor destroyed in a fire, I could still remember 
it, and this experience would have the same noematic 
sense as the previous perception, memory, and descrip-
tion; the monitor's manner of givenness would remain 
memorial, but I would no longcr posit its real exis-
tence. I would instead posit it- and thereby, vary for 
the first time the thetic characteristic ofthe full noema 
-as once, but no longer, existing. 
In these descriptions there already appears an in-
dication of the ambiguities surrounding the ways in 
which Husserl speaks ofthe noema. He sometimes de-
scribes it as the intended object just as intended, which 
certainly leaves open the inference that the noema is 
ontologically identica! with the intended objectivity 
itself. But insofar as the object that is intended is dis-
tinguished from the object as intended, he also leaves 
open the inference that the noema is an intentiona! ob-
ject ontologically distinct from the intended objectivity 
itself. At other times, Husserl speaks ofthe intentiona! 
contents of an act, and since he has given the notion 
of"intentional contents" at least three different mean-
ings in the Logische Untersuchungen, there is room 
for controversy about how to understand the doctrine 
of intentiona! contents in Ideen 1. At still other times, 
he identifies the noema ( or at least a part of it) with the 
notion of (expressive) sense. And, finally, since it is 
possible that an experience can be directed to an object 
that does not actually exist or to that object in a manner 
other than it actually exists, the formulations in terrns 
of"content" and "sense" again lea ve open the inference 
that the noema as intentiona! object is an intensional 
entity (i.e., the meaning of a linguistic expression) that 
is ontologically distinct from the intended objectiv-
ity, but bears a referential (i.e., semantic) relation to it. 
The notion ofthe noema cannot properly be understood 
unless some account is given of the relation between 
the notions of"intentional content," "sense," "intended 
object as intended," and "intended object itself." 
Since interpreters of Husserl must clarify what he 
means by the term "noema," and given the ambiguities 
in Husserl 's own usage, it is no surprise that contro-
versy has ensued. His interpreters, adhering at least at 
the outset to the principle of charity, must reconcile 
these different formulations and these different per-
spectives when giving a comprehensive interpretation 
ofhis theory ofthe noema. And any such account must 
explicate the relation between the noema and the in-
tended objectivity itself, for even ifthe intentiona! ob-
ject is ontologically identica! to the intended objectiv-
ity, there remains some manner of difference between 
the intended objectivity itself and that objectivity con-
sidered just in the manner in which it is intended. 
AROJ\ GURWITSCH was among the first of Husserl's 
followers to focus attention specifically upon the 
noema as a theme. His criticism of Husserl 's theory 
of hyletic contents in perception led him to develop a 
detailed account of the perceptual noema. Gurwitsch 
views the perceived object, i.e., the object that is in-
tended, as a whole of parts, i.e., the infinite, system-
atically organized totality of the object's (noematic) 

NOE MA 
appearances (the object as intended). The object is the 
ideally realizable, but not actually realized or realiz-
able, totality of noemata presenting it. There are clear 
difficulties in Gurwitsch 's account. Sin ce the noema for 
both Husserl and Gurwitsch is, at least in part, a sense, 
and since for Gurwitsch the perceived object is a total-
ity of noemata, his view transforms the intended object 
into a whole composed of a multiplicity of senses. Even 
if Gurwitsch could avoid this charge by distinguishing 
the full noema from its core, i.e., the noematic sense 
itself, his interpretation, understanding the noema as 
the appearance of the object, yields a phenomenalism 
wherein the perceived object itself is a whole whose 
parts are perceptual appearances. Gurwitsch's account 
fails properly to distinguish the whole ( or concrete) 
presentation of the object with its multiple noemata 
from the identica! perceived object itself. 
JOHANNES DAUBERT, a leader in the development 
of REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY at Munich, was another 
early interpreter of Husserl who investigated the doc-
trine of the noema. Unlike Gurwitsch, however, who 
sought to develop the notion of the noema as an as-
pect of the experienced object, Daubert criticizes the 
Husserlian notion of the noema. He interprets the re-
duction and the disclosure ofthe noema as a separation 
of consciousness and sense from the object, as a retreat 
from the autonomous reality of the experienced world 
in favor of a dependent world of consciousness and 
its ideal world of senses, and as a reduction of the real 
world to an ideal world. Daubert understands Husserl 's 
claim that acts intending nonexistent objects have a 
noematic correlate tobe a falsification ofthe very cog-
nition on which Husserl claims to reflect. According 
to Daubert, normal cognition is always engaged with 
real objects and is nothing apart from them. This direct 
engagement with objects is an immediate awareness 
(Innesein) to which intentiona! consciousness with its 
noema is secondary. In immediate awareness itself, 
and here Daubert departs from Husserl and Gurwitsch, 
there is no noema. Intentiona! consciousness arises 
when an interpretive moment, a taking-the-object-as, 
supplements our immediate awareness. But, and here 
Daubert agrees with Gurwitsch, the noema-sense is de-
pendent upon the object of immediate awareness and 
can never be separated from an object; it is impossible 
for Daubert that there exist a noema without an object 
from which it is derived. 
497 
Another interpretation of the noema departs from 
what most concemed Daubert, viz., Husserl's sepa-
ration of sense from the object. This interpretation 
arose as an alternative to Gurwitsch 's and its spirit was 
shaped by DAGFINN F0LLESDAL 's claim that Husserl 's 
phenomenology was very much influenced by the 
thought of GOTTLOB FREGE. This "Fregean" interpre-
tation of Husserl 's doctrine of the noema, developed 
at [ength by DAVID WOODRUFF SMITH and RONALD MCIN-
TYRE, centers around two claims: ( 1) the noema is the 
intentiona! content but not the intended object of the 
act, and (2) the noema is an abstract, intensional entity 
that is to be understood as a linguistically expressible 
meaning and characterized basically as Frege charac-
terized meaning. This interpretation transforms Gur-
witsch's "object theory" of intentionality, wherein the 
noema is the intended objectivity itself (as intended), 
into a "mediator theory" of intentionality, wherein the 
noema is the intentiona! (but not intended) object that 
mediates semantically the experience's directedness to 
the intended object itself. 
The Fregean interpretation, unsurprisingly, did not 
go unchallenged, and the challenges to it, especially 
those of RICHARD HOLMES, LENORE LANGSDORF, and 
ROBERT SOKOLOWSKI, were directed at the central the-
sis of the Fregean interpretation that the intentiona! 
object is an abstract, intensional entity ontologically 
distinct from the intended object and semantically me-
diating the act's directedness to the intended object. 
Holmes and Langsdorf stress the point that the iden-
tica!, determinable X, which Husserl calls the object, 
is the most fundamental moment contained within the 
noematic core; hen ce there is no mediating relation be-
tween the noema and the object. Sokolowski, on the 
other hand, stresses the point that the manner in which 
Husserl discloses the apophantic domain, i.e., the do-
main of sense, in, for example, Formale und transzen-
dentale Logik ( 1929), is prior to and different from 
the phenomeno[ogica[ EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION; hence 
the notions of noema and sense are not identica!. In-
sofar as ali these challenges insist on some sort of 
identity between the noema and the intended objectiv-
ity itself, they are also defenses of the Gurwitschian 
interpretation. However, beyond asserting the identity 
of noema and intended objectivity, these challenges to 
the Fregean reading did not detail a new understand-
ing of the relation between the object as intended and 

498 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the intended objectivity itself to replace Gurwitsch's 
whole-part analysis, although much of Sokolowski's 
other work suggests one. 
Other authors, while disagreeing with important fea-
tures of the Fregean reading, have tried to mediate 
the dispute in various ways. J. N. MOHANTY for ex-
ample, argues that the differences between the Gur-
witschean and Fregean readings are not as marked as 
they first appear and that the two readings can ulti-
mately be reconciled. If we understand the perceptual 
noema as a pre-conceptual but conceptualizable en-
tity, we render Gurwitsch's view reconcilable with the 
Fregean interpretation, which understands the noema 
as an abstract (conceptual) entity. This account, how-
ever, seems to ignore Gurwitsch's insistence that the 
perceptual noema is the perceived object as perceived. 
DONN WELTON and MARY JEANNE LARRABEE argue instead 
that the two interpretations are each correct within a 
limited range of application- more specifically, that 
Gurwitsch's reading is appropriate for perceptual noe-
mata while the Fregean account is appropriate for non-
perceptual, e.g., judgmental, noemata. 
JOHN DRUMMOND, on the other hand, insists on the ir-
reconcilability ofthe two readings. He stresses the fact 
that Husserl 's development of the theory of the reduc-
tion brings about a new understanding ofthe notion of 
phenomenological contents, one that is not limited, as 
in the Untersuchungen, to the real contents of experi-
ence to which are opposed intentiona! contents. Rather, 
the phenomenological contents, to which phenomen-
ological reflection is directed, are now understood to 
include both real and intentiona! contents. Thus the 
intended objectivity itself as intended, is now under-
stood as a moment of the transcendental correlation 
between experience and its experienced world. Drum-
mond also argues for a revised interpretation of the 
relation between the noema and the intended object it-
self; his interpretation, while maintaining Gurwitsch 's 
position that the noema is the intended objectivity itself 
as intended, differs from Gurwitsch in arguing that the 
' 
relation between the noema (the intended abject as in-
tended) and the intended object simpliciter is analyzed 
as an identity-in-manifold, rather than a whole-part, 
relation. 
This survey of the history·of a "metaphenomeno-
logical" controversy cannot, of course, do full justice 
to the range of detail and the subtlety of argument in-
volved in the positions mentioned. The controversy, 
however, is important, since a proper understanding 
ofthe noema and its relation to the phenomenological 
reduction and phenomenological reflection points in 
three directions. First, in the Cartesianische Medita-
tionen [1931] Husserl speaks ofthe object and, hence, 
transcendentally considered, of the noema, as a "tran-
scendental clue" to the structures of intentiona! con-
sciousness. The care fu! analyses of the noematic cor-
relate of an experience, therefore, by presenting to us 
the structures and levels involved in the object's sig-
nificance for us, points toward correlative structures 
and levels in the noesis intending that object in a de-
terminate manner, with a determinate significance, and 
determinate thetic characteristics. We are thereby led 
into the proper domain ofphenomenological reflection, 
viz., intentionality, the noesis-noema correlation. Sec-
ond, by virtue ofthe fact that the noesis-noema struc-
ture is universal, i.e., that every intentiona! experience 
has its noematic correlate, there are noematic analy-
ses for every type of experience: PERCEPTION, MEMORY, 
EXPECTATION, IMAGINATION, VALUING, etc. The analyses 
of the noemata of these various kinds of experiences 
reveal not only the necessary structures of each kind 
of experience, but also the interconnections among the 
various kinds, for example, between perception and 
memory, or memory and expectation, between percep-
tion and judgment, between imagining and idealizing, 
between idealization and scientific theorizing. Noe-
matic analyses thereby lead as well to an understanding 
ofthe unity ofhuman experience and ofits single cor-
relate, the WORLD. Third, a proper understanding ofthe 
doctrine of the noema and of intentionality clarifies 
Husserl 's relations to philosophers such as Descartes, 
Hume, KANT, and others in MODERN PHILOSOPHY, against 
the background of whose philosophies Husserl devel-
oped his own philosophy. Moreover, ifthe doctrines of 
the reduction and of intentionality, including that ofthe 
noema, involving as they do a correlational conception 
of consciousness and an overcoming of the sharp dis-
tinction between intending subject and intended object, 
signify that Husserl 's theory of cognition has broken 
from modern philosophy's epistemological paradigms, 
then an understanding of these notions also clarifies 
Husserl 's position in the controversies between mod-
ern thought and POSTMODERNISM.

NURSING 
Interest in phenomenology among 
nursing scholars developed rapidly during the late 
1980s and early 1990s. Illustrating this, the Cumu-
lative Index to Nursing Literature lists 143 items con-
cerning phenomenology and nursing that appeared be-
tween 1991 and 1993. The degree to which phenomen-
ology is involved in these articles and the quality of 
phenomenological research varies greatly. Most ofthe 
articles listed are attempts to describe the experiences 
of clients that are of significance to nurses. The sec-
ond most frequent theme concerns the experiences of 
nurses in giving certain kinds of care. Some articles are 
about theoretical issues in the study of nursing. Most 
of these studies describe certain aspects of nursing in 
which phenomenology is used as the method or as a 
method in a qualitative or HUMAN sciENCE study. Few, 
however, address the fundamental phenomenological 
issue ofwhat constitutes nursing. 
Although most phenomenological studies of nurs-
ing do not directly describe the essence of nursing, 
these studies usually grow out of an interest in artic-
ulating the meaning of nursing from nursing practice 
itself. This focus on nursing practice represents a rejec-
tion of the attempt to establish the place of nursing in 
academia by defining nursing as a science or an applied 
science that occurred when nursing moved into aca-
demic settings. Focusing on nursing practice itself led 
some scholars, beginning with MADELEINE LEININGER, 
who used ethnography to define nursing as caring. This 
definition gained increasing acceptance in nursing dur-
ing the 1980s and early 1990s. Some nursing schools 
included caring in their curricula and some, especially 
Florida Atlantic University, based their entire program 
on caring. The dissatisfaction with defining nursing as 
a science or applied science was amplified by FEMI-
NISM. As nursing scholars attempted to articulate the 
meaning of nursing from nursing practice, they fol-
lowed qualitative and human science approaches and 
especially phenomenological methodology.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Most nursing scholars who follow 
EDMUND 
HUSSERL's dictum "back to the matters themselves," 
have articulated aspects of nursing practice. Some 
nurses merely saw in phenomenology a way of artic-
ulating nursing as practiced. Others were attracted, as 
well to phenomenology itself, as is evident in descrip-
tive and eidetic studies of FRAN REEDER and MARILYN 
D. RAY. At present, only PATRICIA BENNER, SALLY GADOW, 
NANCY DIEKELMANN, ANNE BISHOP, JOHN SCUDDER, JEAN 
WATSON, JOSEPHINE PATERSON, and LORETTA ZDERAD have 
attempted to articulate the meaning of nursing itself. 
Benner has described the essence of nursing in terms 
of competencies and the movement from novice to ex-
pert in nursing. Watson has developed a philosophical 
science ofnursing as a moral ideal based on phenomen-
ology and transpersonal pyschology. Gadow has inter-
preted the nurse as an existential advocate. Diekelmann 
has described nursing education as dialogical, pheno-
menological interpretation ofnursing practice. Bishop 
and Scudder have articulated nursing as a caring prac-
tice. 
Benner is a nurse who became interested in pheno-
menology under the influence of HUBERT DREYFUS be-
cause she saw in phenomenology a way ofarticulating 
the meaning of nursing as practiced. Benner's study 
of competency and expertness in nursing has proba-
bly drawn more attention to phenomenology than any 
other work. Initially, she received a grant that made it 
possible to assemble a team, send out questionnaires, 
and do extensive observation and interviewing. From 
this study, she selected exemplars of nursing excel-
lence that disclosed the meaning of competent nursing 
practice and through HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY 
explored the meaning of nursing itself. She describes 
thirty-one competencies, grouped in seven domains. 
Rather than defining these competencies categorically, 
she discloses their meaning through exemplars that 
were interpreted phenomenologically. She further de-
scribes the movement from novice to expert, drawing 
on the work of Hubert Dreyfus and Stuart Dreyfus. 
Novices follow rules, those moving from novice to ex-
pert apply principles in situations, and experts respond 
immediately to situations, drawing on experience and 
understanding. Her work has much influenced nursing 
practice and nursing education by describing compe-
tencies and excellence in nursing in a way that makes 
sense to those engaged in practice. 
Sally Gadow, a nurse who holds a Ph.D. in philos-
ophy, develops her conception of the nurse as an ex-
istential advocate from the perspective of EXISTENTIAL 
PHENOMENOLOGY. Rather than beginning with nursing 
practice as Benner does, Gadow attempts to develop a 
philosophy for contemporary nursing that is distinctly 
different from traditional nursing. She claims that exis-
tential advocacy is, in fact, the essence ofnursing. She 
describes existential advocacy as three ways of being 
with patients. The first is the nurse helping clients to 
exercise their right of self-determination through deci-
sions that fully express their values. Self-determination 
is such a basic human right that Gadow believes that 
it ought to be respected even if it goes counter to fos-
tering good health. The second is that nurses should 
relate to patients with their whole selves, rather than 
merely as professionals. The third is that nurses should 
assist patients in unifying their experience of the or-
ganic with that ofthe lived BODY, thereby not reducing 
the patient to the moral status of an object. 
Anne Bishop and John Scudder, a nurse-philosopher 
team, have attempted to articulate the meaning ofnurs-
ing by bringing together phenomenological philosophy 
and nursing practice. They have drawn on Benner's 
study, on their own studies, and on phenomenological 
interpretations ofthe meaning ofhuman being that are 
especially relevant for nursing practice. They contend 
that Benner has articulated well the essential aspect of 
nursing in which the nurse has the legitimate authority 
to act as a competent professional. In addition, they 
have articulated the in-between stance of nursing in 
which nurses act in-between the physician, patient, and 
administrators to give everyday care to patients. They 
contend that the in-between position is a privileged, 
though difficult, one from which to make moral deci-
sions that involves bringing together MEDICINE, agency 
resources, and patients' desires. They conducted a 
phenomenological study of fulfillment in nursing that 
indicated that practicing nurses overwhelmingly find 
fulfillment through moral acts and personal relation-
ships. This finding challenges the implication in much 
of nursing litera ture that nursing primarily consists of 
following the dictates of the nursing profession or ef-
fectively using TECHNOLOGY. 
Nursing, rather then being essentially a professional 
or technological enterprise, is, according to Bishop 
and Scudder, a practice in the sense of HANS-GEORG 

NURSING 
501 
GAD AMER 's interpretation of practice. Nursing is a prac-
tice in that it seeks to foster the good through his-
torically developed ways of caring for patients. Thus 
nursing is the practice of caring. Their interpretation of 
caring is informed by Nell Noddings and Carol Gilli-
gan, but they point out that an interpretation of care 
suitable to nursing must extend beyond personal care 
in a network ofrelationships to include the historically 
developed ways of caring that are central to the practice 
ofnursing. When nursing is interpreted as the practice 
of care, then nursing ETHICS is primarily concemed with 
fostering good care and only occasionally with making 
judgments about exceptional cases such as when to ter-
minate the technological means that may be the only 
thing keeping a patient organically (though not exis-
tentially) "alive." Bishop and Scudder have expanded 
their interpretation of nursing by developing an ethic 
of practice that begins with the moral sense of practice 
and focuses on the fulfillment ofthat sense. 
Much confusion in nursing comes from the fail-
ure to distinguish between nursing as a practice and 
the study of nursing -
the term "nursing" refers to 
both the practice and the discipline. The discipline of 
nursing should articulate the practice ofnursing rather 
than reducing nursing practice to an applied science. 
The study of nursing is a practica! human science, as 
interpreted by STEPHAN STRASSER, in that it not only 
articulates the practice but seeks to improve it. 
Phenomenological methodology is well-suited to 
articulating nursing practice, but some nursing schol-
ars have questioned its capacity for fostering needed 
reform in nursing. Some critics ofthe work ofBishop 
and Scudder ha ve challenged their belief that signifi-
cant reform of nursing can come from discovering and 
realizing the possibilities in nursing practice. These 
critics contend that such reform will not foster the type 
of autonomy needed by nurses individually and profes-
sionally because their place in the health care system 
has been limited to that of a helping role by those 
who dominate health care. For example, JEAN WATSON, 
a leader in nursing theory and an advocate of pheno-
menological study ofnursing, has questioned its ability 
to foster needed reform. DAVID ALLEN and JANICE THOMP-
SON, along with many other feminists, have drawn on 
CRITICAL THEORY to support reform ofhealth care. 
Although phenomenology has been criticized as in-
adequate to foster reform, it has, in part, spawned one 
of the major reform movements in nursing education. 
This movement, called the "new curriculum," is based 
on the belief that nursing is basically care and that the 
goal of education is to foster understanding of nurs-
ing by interpretation of its meaning in clinica! situ-
ations. NANCY DIEKELMANN, a leading advocate of the 
new curriculum, contends that curriculum develops out 
of dialogue between students, practitioner, and faculty 
interpreting the meaning ofnursing care. She rejects at-
tempts to teach nursing theoretically, claiming instead 
that practice is theory-generating when interpreted di-
alogically. The new curriculum has been strongly sup-
ported by the National League for Nursing, the ac-
crediting agency for programs in nursing education. 
Perhaps the involvement of phenomenology in the re-
form ofthe curriculum can show how phenomenology 
can contribute to reform. 
At present, however, one major problem facing the 
phenomenological interpretation of nursing still con-
cems the place of phenomenological interpretation of 
nursing in the reform of health care. A second prob-
lem is the relationship of the studies of the meaning 
of nursing itself, such as those of Benner, Gadow, and 
Scudder and Bishop, to the many phenomenological 
studies ofthe various aspects ofnursing currently tak-
ing place. The third is whether phenomenology will 
play a major ro le in articulating the meaning of nurs-
ing or will it be regarded merely as a methodological 
option in the qualitative interpretati an of nursing. The 
fourth concems the role phenomenology will play in 
developing a philosophy of nursing.

ORDINARY LANGUAGE ANALYSIS 
"Lin-
guistic analysis" has been used to designate a number of 
different philosophical schools. In its broadest sense it 
has included LOGICAL PosmvisM; logica! behaviorism; 
logica! atomism; formal analysis and ideal language 
philosophy; and ordinary language philosophy. In its 
narrower sense it frequently designates only the last 
two of these, and it is with the latter that we shali be 
primarily concemed. 
At the turn of the 20th century, philosophers were 
looking for new paradigms and new methods for phi-
losophy. The phenomenal success of the natural sci-
ences provided a seductive model. Scientific theories 
were clearly stated, carefuliy argued, and appeared to 
be progressing toward consensus. Some philosophers 
looked on these characteristics as providing a standard 
for philosophy as well. They urged an emphasis on 
clarity, attention to logic and argument- ali issuing 
in a focus on the structure and use of language. But 
the particular ways in which philosophers attended to 
language differed in teliing respects. 
The logica! positivists, the logica! behaviorists, and 
the philosophers involved in constructing artificiallan-
guages ali shared one basic assumption: that ordinary, 
everyday language was either the source ofphilosophi-
cal problems or was at least incapable ofresolving such 
problems. For the logica! positivists, it contained some 
meaningless statements that purported tobe metaphysi-
cal; for the logica! behaviorists, it contained misleading 
mental terms that needed to be reduced to behavioral 
equivalents; and for the artificiallanguage enthusiasts, 
interested in constructing a logically perfect language 
for philosophic use, the syntax and much of the se-
mantics of ordinary language were misleading. Logica! 
atomists, on the other hand, saw in portions of it ( e.g., 
atomic and molecular propositions) a reflection ofthe 
structure of reality (atomic and molecular facts). For 
the first group, ordinary language was unsystematic 
and deceptive; for the second group, careful analysis 
showed that some of it mirrored the structure of facts. 
In contrast to both groups, ordinary language phi-
losophy was committed to the view that everyday lan-
guage is philosophicaliy useful and important as it 
stands, but does not offer anything like an unambigu-
ous reflection of reality. Ordinary language philosophy 
abandoned the quest for absolute logica! precision and 
for certainty about the nature of reality. To see how 
some of the details of the view were advanced, con-
sider two of its leading proponents-Wittgenstein and 
Austin. (Some other philosophers whose work !ies at 
least partialiy within ordinary language philosophy in-
clude Gilbert Ryle, Stuart Hampshire, P. F. Strawson, 
and John Searle.) 
LUDWIG W!TTGENSTEIN, an Austrian by birth, was ed-
ucated at Cambridge University in England by G. E. 
Moore, Bertrand Russeli, and others involved in the 
founding of ciassicaJ ANAL YTIC PHILOSOPHY. In 1922 
he published Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, a work 
squarely within the tradition of logica! atomism. But 
by the early 1930s his views had begun to change dra-
maticaliy. In 1933, he dictated a set of class notes that 
were circu1ated in a blue cover, and carne to be known 
as The Blue Book. Two years !ater he dictated a second 
set of notes; these circulated with a brown cover, and 
were known as The Brown Book. Together, these pro-
vided the raw material for his enormously influential 
book, Philosophical Investigations, which was pub-
lished posthumously. In these three works the "!ater" 
Wittgenstein argued strenuously against his own ear-
lier logica! atomism and argued for the philosophical 
importance oflooking carefully at language as it func-
tions in everyday life. 
Early in The Blue Book Wittgenstein claims that phi-
losophy's efforts to mimic science, by explaining and

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
generalizing, lead into "complete darkness." Philoso-
phy's primary business is to describe, not to explain 
or to reduce anything to anything else. This in itself 
marks a decisive departure from the spirit of the lin-
guistic philosophy practiced earlier in the century. It 
is also a point of convergence with phenomenology. 
Clarity will continue to bea standard for ordinary lan-
guage analysis, but complete precision, and progress 
toward explaining reality, are now said to ha ve impor-
tant limits. 
One motivation for this softening of the standards 
borrowed from the sciences lay in Wittgenstein's atti-
tude toward concepts. For the tradition of Leibniz and 
Kant, concepts were thought to have sharply defined 
boundaries. Wittgenstein challenges this notion, writ-
ing in The Blue Book, "We are unable clearly to circum-
scribe the concepts we use; not because we don 't know 
their real definition, but because there is no real 'def-
inition' to them." His view that concepts have fuzzy 
edges, and that the meaning they have can vary from 
one context to another, dominates virtually ali of his 
!ater work. 
In Philosophical Investigations he uses the concept 
"game" to illustrate his point -
there are bal! games, 
board games, solitary games, games with scores and 
games without scores, games with winners and losers 
and games without winners and losers, etc. That is to 
say, the concept "game" covers a number of different 
cases that ha ve overlapping similarities but do not ha ve 
any one essential and defining characteristic. They are 
connected only by a set of"family resemblances." It is 
important to notice that "game" is only one illustration 
of his more general claim. The concept of LANGUAGE 
itself, according to Wittgenstein, is best understood as 
a series of overlapping games that can be played, for 
which there are a series of conventional rules but no 
one essential definition. 
In The Brown Book Wittgenstein constructs a long 
series of possible "language games," many of which 
exclude elements that are part of our own ordinary lan-
guage but that he takes nonetheless to be reasonably 
usable languages. Some ofthese he creates completely 
out of commands, part ofhis effort to show that naming 
is not the only, nor even the most important, function 
of language. His point seems to be that the elements 
actually involved in ordinary language are largely con-
tingent. 
Furthermore, he argues that the psychological states 
thought to accompany aur use of language are also 
quite contingent. An interna! state of meaning or un-
derstanding or knowing is not obviously necessary, on 
his view, in explaining the competent use oflanguage in 
ali cases. In the case of learning and using a language, 
for example, Wittgenstein considers what is involved 
infollowing a rule. He argues that if, in order to ex-
plain how one follows a rule for language-use, one's 
final appeal is to the mental states of individuals -
for example, their intentions- ali manner of diverse 
interpretations ofthe rule can be made plausible. Ulti-
mately, one needs to rely on social practice to decide 
how particular rules are meant tobe followed. And o ne 
has then to look to behavior rather than to individual 
mental states in order to decide when the rule is being 
followed. 
While he makes repeated attempts to move discus-
sions of understanding, interpretation, meaning, etc., 
away from notions ofinternal mental states and toward 
behavior- relating them, for example, to being able to 
go on, being able to compare one (externa!) thing with 
another, etc. -it is probably an oversimplification to 
depict his view simply as behaviorism. He does not 
deny the possibility of interna! mental states, but he is 
at pains to show that we can explain what needs to be 
explained about language-use without having recourse 
to them. 
Wittgenstein maintains that the same ftexibility that 
attends our use of the concept "game" also prevails 
for concepts like "understanding," "interpreting," "in-
tending," etc. There is not some one interna! abject 
that these terms name, an abject that might be "pointed 
to" introspectively. The terms are used in connection 
with a wide variety of situations and behaviors, and 
any insight into what the terms mean will require that 
these variable factors be taken into account. Mental 
concepts, like most ofthe others, have fuzzy, ftexible, 
overlapping boundaries. 
In addition, Wittgenstein suggests that some mental 
states have a character analogous to what phenome-
nologists would cal! a "temporal horizon." States like 
believing or loving or hop ing cannot, he says, last only 
for an instant. They require a certain duration and nor-
mally get their meaning as part of a larger context. 
That, he claims, is an additional reason why they do 
not lend themselves to simple introspection. "Do not 

ORDINARY LANGUAGE ANALYSIS

try to analyse your own inner experience ... what is 
at issue is the fixing of concepts," he writes in his 
Philosophical Investigations. 
One ofthe reasons that Wittgenstein argues for flex-
ibility in our understanding of concepts is that he sees 
the MEANING of words as something that we give to 
them. Meanings do not descend from some source in-
dependent of us. And we give words their meanings 
in the context ofvariable "language games" and broad 
"forms of life" that develop and fade. Thus there is no 
reason to assume that the meanings we give to words 
will be fixed within rigid boundaries. Essential defini-
tions will be rare, occurring mostly in areas like logic 
and mathematics. But even here one needs to take ac-
count ofWittgenstein's view ofthe a priori: "But ifit is 
a priori, that means that it is a form of account which 
is very convincing to us." Even the a priori loses every 
trace of immutability. 
Against logica! atomism he argues that one cannot 
understand language by approaching it atomistically; 
words must be taken in the context of a rich and vari-
able set of relations- relations to other words, to the 
conventions ofthe particular language game, to the sit-
uations in which they are used, to the forms oflife from 
which they emerge. On his view, ordinary language be-
comes philosophically problematic only when one tries 
to abstract it from these normal relations. 
J. L. Austin also argues for the philosophical im-
portance of ordinary language. Like Wittgenstein, he 
opposes both logica! atomism and the philosophical 
importance of constructing artificial languages. What 
then is the philosophical task in relation to language? In 
his Philosophical Papers (1961) he writes that words 
are "our tools, and ... we should use clean tools ... 
[ and] realize their inadequacies and arbitrariness, and 
... relook at the world without blinkers." Ordinary 
language, on his view, will not simply tell one, unam-
biguously, about reality, but if one uses it with care 
and attention, it is likely to provide some valuable dis-
tinctions and connections that have been found useful 
through generations ofuse. Here there is a convergence 
with HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY. 
Austin agrees with Wittgenstein that the meaning 
of terms is a function of the context of their use. In 
this connection he emphasizes the importance of con-
sidering the meaning of statements or utterances and 
not simply sentences or isolated words. He expands on 
the notion of the use of an utterance to ca li attention to 
what he termed the "illocutionary forces" oflanguage-
use. Among these he gives special consideration to 
the "constati ve" and "performative" uses of language. 
The former includes ali ofthe ways in which we assert 
things. The latter, the performative use, includes ali the 
things that we do simply by our use of words- like 
promising, bequeathing, commanding, etc. -
and as 
he eventually shows, even stating and asserting ha ve a 
performative aspect. Austin 's point is that to link the 
meaning of language to its use requires that one take 
full account of the many dimensions of its use. The 
different contexts in which individual words can be 
used is important in understanding their meanings -
he gives a fine example ofthis in his discussion ofthe 
term "real." But taking account of the ways in which 
whole utterances can be used, the total "speech act," 
is equally important if one is fully to understand the 
meaning of a piece of language. 
Austin's discussion of language is particularly in-
structive in eliminating a common misconception 
about ordinary language philosophy. It has sometimes 
been suggested that the latter concerns itself solely with 
discussing pieces oflanguage, and ignores ali the more 
significant problems of traditional philosophy. Austin 's 
book Sense and Sensibilia (1962) makes it quite clear 
that this is untrue. In it he uses a detailed analysis of 
various terms of ordinary language- "real," "look," 
"illusion," etc.- to argue that phenomenalism, ofthe 
sort offered by A. J. Ayer and others, is based on a 
mistaken use of terms of ordinary language. His goal 
is to dislodge a misguided theory of perception; his 
tools include an analysis of ordinary language. Simi-
larly, he uses the view he shares with Wittgenstein-
namely, that not ali nouns must name something- to 
argue against the existence of universals -
including 
the universal "meaning." 
Again, like Wittgenstein, he acknowledges that or-
dinary language is sometimes not adequate to our 
needs. Austin himself coined the term "performative" 
because he found no other term that captured the spe-
cific aspect of speech that he wanted to highlight. In 
deciding a particular case, however, one needs to pay 
close attention to the facts of both experience and lin-
guistic conventions. In Philosophical Papers he writes: 
"We are using a sharpened awareness of words to 
sharpen our perception of, though not as the final ar-

506 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
biter of, the phenomena. For this reason 1 think it might 
be better to use, for this way of doing philosophy ... 
'linguistic phenomenology' ." 
This well-known statement by Austin suggests that 
ordinary language philosophy shares some common 
ground with phenomenology. And indeed it does. Both 
the ordinary language philosophers and the phenome-
nologists argue for the importance of context, of re-
lations; both groups oppose atomistic approaches to 
philosophical issues. And for both groups (including 
the !ater work of EDMUND HUSSERL and Wittgenstein) 
this means looking at problems in the context of a lived 
world, a cu! ture. Both schools are unwilling to take the 
model of science or of logic as the only valid frame-
work for doing philosophy. Furthermore, both groups 
place heavy emphasis on description. On the one hand, 
this means an effort to avoid imposing theoretical pre-
suppositions on their investigations; on the other hand, 
it also means somewhat less emphasis on argumentand 
proof, and more emphasis on laying out the data clearly 
for others to see for themselves. Philosophy is seen by 
both Husserl and the ordinary language philosophers 
as a method rather than as a body of doctrine. 
Some phenomenologists, notably the early MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER, shared with ordinary language philosophers 
a valuing of the commonplace. Both find everyday 
things (whether hammers or speech) tobe philosoph-
ically relevant and revelatory. Furthermore, Wittgen-
stein, MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, and the !ater Heidegger 
ali argue for the inseparability ofthought and language 
(a view apparently not shared by Husserl). Merleau-
Ponty also shares with ordinary language philosophy 
an emphasis on the social dimension of language; one 
begins, he says, to understand a foreign language by 
"taking part in a communallife." He analogizes one's 
use of language to one's "use" of one's own soov: 
neither requires an interna! mental act to represent it. 
Language is simply part of the "equipment" that one 
can reach toward and use. 
There are, however, important differences between 
phenomenology and ordinary language philosophy. 
These become more apparent when one considers the 
philosophers individually. Where Husserl, for exam-
ple, looks for an absolutely certain starting point for his 
philosophy, the ordinary language philosophers aban-
don such a quest. (But then, so too do some of the 
!ater phenomenologists.) Where Husserl is concerned 
to uncover essences, universals, and commonalities, 
both Wittgenstein and Austin are committed to un-
covering particularities, differences, and distinctions. 
Where Husserl takes concepts to have clean bound-
aries, Wittgenstein and Austin see them as far less tidy. 
On Husserl's view, one task ofphenomenologyis to 
uncover the defining characteristics of diverse mental 
states by intuiting and then describing them. Wittgen-
stein, by contrast, argues that reflection on our mental 
states is not what reveals their meaning. Rather, we 
learn their meaning by seeing how the words we use to 
describe them play roles in different language games 
and involve differing types of contexts and behaviors. 
For Husserl, the act ofmeaning-giving on the part ofthe 
individual EGO is of central importance; for Wittgen-
stein and Austin, meaning is largely a function of so-
cial contexts and conventions. And for them, meanings 
are not entities of any sort, while for Husserl they are 
"ideal" (i.e., timeless) entities. When Husserl does talk 
about language, and he rarely does that in the context 
ofhis phenomenology, he is primarily concerned with 
its logica! structure rather than with the web of dis-
tinctions embodied in its everyday uses. He speaks, 
in fact, of the desirability of having an unambiguous 
language in which to articulate precisely the insights 
revealed by his phenomenological analyses- a view 
profoundly at odds with ordinary language philosophy. 
While Husserl is heavily committed to the importance 
of the a priori, Wittgenstein counts it as no more than 
psychologically compelling. And although Austin, like 
Husserl, opposes skepticism, unlike Husserl he does 
not opt for the cogito as a certain starting point ofphi-
losophy. Rather, he tries to undercut the very sort of 
argument that allows skepticism to gain a foothold in 
the first place- the argument from illusion. 
In the case of Heidegger, too, there are significant 
divergences from ordinary language philosophy. For 
him, a careful investigation of language will help to 
uncover the true meaning of Being, while for Wittgen-
stein it will help to uncover the mistaken notion that 
language has some privileged relation to reality, a re-
lation that is revelatory of the nature of that reality. 
While both Wittgenstein and Heidegger refer to the 
importance of the relation between understanding po-
etry and understanding language, Wittgenstein is not 
concerned, as Heidegger is, with the originality of the 
use oflanguage in poetry, nor with its capacity to reveal 

JOSE ORTEGA Y GASSET 
507 
Being. Rather, he focuses on the idea that the under-
standing ofpoetry carries with it a slightly different and 
important sense of "understanding" than it does in the 
context ofunderstanding, say, scientific prose. For Hei-
degger (and at least the early Husserl), one discovers 
the meaning of terms. With Heidegger this frequently 
involves tracing the etymology of the term. Wittgen-
stein and Austin, by contrast, take the meanings of 
words to be human constructs. For them, etymology 
is entirely legitimate, but it is not taken as revealing 
the "true" meaning ofwords; it might simply highlight 
some meanings that ha ve been forgotten or altered over 
time. Finally, for Heidegger language is not so much 
an object to be analyzed as it is one of our vehicles 
for being-in-the-world. It is, as he says enigmatically, 
the "house ofBeing." Ordinary language philosophers 
would be likely to reply that such a phrase uses ordi-
nary words in a most extraordinary way.

Ortega (1883-
1955), was bom and died in Madrid. After completing 
his studies at the University of Madrid in 1904, he did 
postdoctoral work in Germany ( 1905-8, 1911 ), pri-
marily at Marburg and especially with Herman Cohen 
( 1842-1918). In 1912, he became familiar with pheno-
menology as practiced by EDMUND HUSSERL in his Lo-
gische Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901 ). After that, his 
works were to contain numerous references to ques-
tions and authors of phenomenological import. His 
broadly conceived and far-reaching pedagogica! effort 
~implemented by means ofhis teaching at the Univer-
sity of Madrid (1911-36) and elsewhere, his writings 
and lectures (leamed and semi-popular), his journal, 
Revista de Occidente (first period: 1923-36), and the 
publishing house by the same name that he founded 
-
permitted him to give shape to and foster a phe-
nomenologically oriented movement throughout SPAIN 
ANO LATIN AMERICA. 
Ortega's early and generous reception of pheno-
menology was not uncritical. By the time of his first 
book, Meditaciones de! Quijote ( 1914), he had arrived 
at the conviction that idealism, as the philosophical 
doctrine and attitude proper to the modern era, had al-
ready exhausted its historical potentialities. Hence he 
saw his philosophical task as essentially involving the 
critique and overcoming of idealism, both classical and 
phenomenological, and therefore of modemity. 
Since the time of Descartes, conscious experience 
had primordially meant self-consciousness or reflec-
tion. This axiom was rooted in the search for the 
indubitable, which could be recognized by its non-
dependent sta tus. In the eyes of Descartes and his foi-

lowers, this required denying the world an absolute 
character, for one gains access to the WORLD not directly 
but by means of consciousness, which is thus taken as 
the non-dependent sphere (;_,Que es filosofia? [What is 
philosophy?, 1929]). This notion, which corresponds 
precisely to Husserl's understanding of Cartesianism, 
had to be corrected by the founder of phenomenology 
as the expression of a faulty description. Consciousness 
was indeed self-consciousness, but only through and in 
conjunction with the primordial phenomenon ofbeing 
"conscious of' something or other. Yet this duality is 
not tantamount to the availability of two realities that 
would subsist si de by side, even if one (consciousness) 
refers to the other (world); it is instead, as Ortega put 
it in his lnvestigaciones psicol6gicas ( 1915-16), the 
event consisting in one referring to the other, which is 
what Husserl called INTENTIONALITY. 
Now, just as Husserl subjected Descartes's under-
standing of the nature of the absolute dimension of 
experience to a critique that, descriptively speaking, 
showed it tobe incomplete, so too did Ortega endeavor 
to establish that Husserl 's thesis to the effect that the 
fundamental fact is the dual unity of consciousness and 
world was likewise essentially inadequate. As he put 
it in La idea de principio en Leibniz ( 194 7), Husserl 's 
phenomenological philosophy, or the idealistic inter-
pretation of it, is nota pure description but involves an 
hypothesis, namely, that an act of consciousness is real, 
but its object is only intentiona!, and thus irreal. Such 
a position is not in keeping with the goal pursued by 
philosophers, who are basically after some primordial, 
exemplary, ultimately firm reality to which they may 
refer ali others, i.e., something that can serve as their 
foundation. 
That notwithstanding, Husserl's effort was not seen 
by Ortega as being either groundless or arbitrary. On 
the contrary, he understood Husserl tobe trying to iden-
tify something that the philosopher would not posit, 
but just the opposite- namely, that which would be 
im-posed on him, something therefore that would be 
self-posited, something "positive" or "given." This he 
believed to have found in "pure consciousness," i.e., 
in the contemplative regard in which one is confined 
to the self-aware presentation ofthings as they appear, 
whatever their sort. But then the world would be re-
duced to sense, phenomenon, or pure intelligibility, as 
the correlate and outcome ofthe freely executed act of 
consciousness that Husserl in Jdeen zu einer reinen 
Phanomenologie und phanomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 ( 1913) called the phenomenological EPOCHE AND 
REDUCTION. Equivalently, Husserl took consciousness 
as being relative only to itself, and what appears thereto 
(i.e., the world) as being relative to the acts of con-
sciousness ("Apuntes sobre el pensamiento," 1941 ). 
But that is altogether impossible. Ortega's critique of 
the notion of epoche or reduction hinges on the dis-
tinction between a primary and a reflective act of con-
sciousness and the adequate descriptive account ofthe 
difference between them. According to him, a primary 
or straightforward act of consciousness is naive or un-
reflective, and therefore it is a performance in which 
people believe in what they think about and effectively 
will what they will, etc. In other words, it is the un-
mediated access to the world, for to such an act nothing 
is just an object; rather, everything is a rea1ity. Now, 
if this is correct, one is already in possession of what 
Husserl was looking for, i.e., the self-positing or ab-
solute dimension of experience, which cannot be the 
outcome of an ad hoc intellectual process in which one 
would be involved subsequently, as is the case with 
one's arriving at the world qua phenomenon as the 
result of carrying out the phenomenological reduction. 
Naturally, Ortega did not mean thereby that one is 
unable to perform an act of consciousness by means 
of which one would deal with a preceding act in one 
of severa! possible ways ( e.g., analysis or description). 
Quite the contrary: one can even go, in fact, so far as 
to cancel it with respect to the truth claims it makes 
by considering it, say, as an error or an illusion. But 
one cannot un do, de-realize, or suspend the reality of a 
prior act, if for no other reason than the reality of such 
an act, as concluded, is no longer able to be altered. 
In Ortega 's opinion, here in !ies the fundamental rea-
son why idealism must be overcome. The ultimate fail-
ure of description, which is part and parcel of that doc-
trine, even in its exacting phenomenological version, 
amounts to this: that it approaches the given as if it were 
a "primary and naive act of consciousness," which is 
precisely what it is not. Rather, it is reality itself, the 
living situation in which the real is rendered available 
non-mediately. Accordingly, it is Ortega's position in 
his "Prologo para alemanes" (1934) that ali idealists 
presuppose the real by making their departure on its 
basis and then, by placing themselves in another real-

JOSE ORTEGA Y GASSET 
509 
ity, proceed to characterize the primary act as a mere 
act of consciousness. Moreover, the idealistic turn of 
phenomenology is logically contradictory, for were it 
practicable, then the result would be that reflection 
would do away with the most essential feature of the 
primary act, to wit: its character ofreality, thus showing 
itself to be incompatible with the basic aim of pheno-
menology-namely, to effect the essential-descriptive 
analysis of what is given, just as it is given, not to en-
gage in the explanation of it ("Sobre el concepto de 
sensaci6n," 1913 ). Therefore, Husserl 's search for the 
absolute would ha ve come to grief precisely with the 
performance ofthe epoche, which, ifOrtega's analysis 
is correct, would be both unnecessary and impossible. 
In light of this, Ortega grasped the need to identify 
something that would truly be given non-mediately by 
means of an essential and adequate description of ex-
perience. 
Recently an intriguing suggestion has been made 
by Javier San Martin- namely, that Ortega 's critique 
ofthe idealist interpretation ofphenomenology and his 
elaboration of a systematic, descriptive account of hu-
man life qua radical reality are consistent with many of 
the posthumouslypublished analyses that Husserl con-
ducted after Jdeen 1. Be that as it may, as submitted 
to Husserl through EUGEN FINK, Ortega's "liminal ob-
jection" to phenomenological idealism may then be 
summarized as follows: first, the suspension of the 
most intrinsic dimension of an act of consciousness, 
namely, its performative value, vollziehender Charak-
ter, or positing power, is tantamount to its nullification; 
second, one is called upon to suspend the performa-
tive value of an act of consciousness by means of the 
"phenomenological reduction," which, though reflec-
tive, is as much an act of consciousness as the primary 
act and is thus in no special position to suspend it; and 
third, the reduction, though an act of consciousness, is 
nonetheless allowed to keep its vollziehender Charak-
ter and to posit primary consciousness as absolute be-
ing, which is accordingly understood as Erlebnis, or the 
self-aware givenness of something other precisely as 
it appears ("Ensayo de Estetica a manera de pr6logo," 
1914 ). 
In short, reflective consciousness is assigned a priv-
ileged status in both classical and phenomenological 
idealism, and such a status is none other than that of 
a weltsetzend or world-positing power. But this is pre-
cisely the problem, for it is contradictory to assign 
it such a status and yet make it amount to its self-
removal, for, on the one hand, it is presented as the 
straightforward access to reality and, on the other, it is 
taken tobe the objectivation ofthe latter and its reduc-
tion to the disclosure ofthe phenomenal. Accordingly, 
Ortega contended that "consciousness" is "precisely 
that which cannot be suspended or revoked," since it 
is no act of pure contemplation, but rather consists in 
our being placed without mediation at the real. How-
ever, if this is so, "consciousness" is "reality, not con-
sciousness." In consequence, he was called upon, on 
the grounds of his refined descriptive analysis of the 
phenomenon "consciousness of," to abandon idealism 
and to substitute something else for consciousness as 
the first datum concern ing the uni verse. Individual hu-
man life was to play this role for Ortega. 
This formulation, however, does not do complete 
justice to Ortega 's motivation in his effort to overcome 
idealism. In his "Pr6logo," he argues that philosophy 
had reached maturity with German idealism (FICHTE, 
SCHELLING, and HEGEL), in which the movement of re-
flection achieved the fullness of its intellectual form. 
According to Ortega, this meant that, for the first time, 
philosophers had arrived at an understanding of their 
discipline as the product of a systematic way ofthink-
ing that, inasmuch as it deals with its own problematic 
possibility and is content with nothing but the plen-
itude of the real, cannot be mistaken for a science. 
This notwithstanding, the excesses of Romantic ide-
alism, arising from the conflict between philosophy's 
commitment to truth and its systematic manner ofpro-
ceeding, had to be brought under control. At the turn 
of the century, the neo-Kantians, among others, were 
faced with this task. Yet this school was found wanting 
by Ortega and other members ofhis generation, such as 
NICOLAI HARTMANN and Heinz Heimsoeth (1886-1975), 
his fellow students at Marburg, for it did not thor-
oughly subject its theses to an unprejudiced confronta-
tion with the real, taking instead something derivative 
("culture") as the originary. They had, however, the 
"good fortune" of finding the "wondrous instrument" 
called phenomenology, which permitted the required 
confrontation (truthfulness), yet failed as the means 
to systematic thought, for, by its very nature, pheno-
menology is incapable of arriving at a systematic form 
or structure. Accordingly, ifphilosophy was to remain 

510 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
practicable at the level of its maturity, it had to be-
come an essential-descriptive analysis of a self-giving 
reality that, as given, would prove itself to be system-
atically structured and come to be adequately grasped 
as such. It was precisely Ortega's contention that only 
individual human life measured up to such a require-
ment, and it was his lifelong philosophical endeavor to 
demonstrate it. 
Ortega's first mature expression of the idea of life 
is his formula "1 am 1 and my circum-stance," which 
is found in Meditaciones de! Quijote. This amounts to 
a descriptive radicalization ofHusserl's concept "con-
sciousness of," and so it was taken tobe by Ortega, who 
brought it now to signify, first of ali, the coexistence of 
myself and my world. But this meant that the unity of 
reciprocity of which life basically consists cannot be 
seen any longer as synonymous with the notion of ego 
cogito cogitatum qua cogitatum, as Husserl was !ater 
to enunciate it in Cartesianische Meditationen [ 1931], 
for human life so understood is not ideality, i.e., inten-
tionality, but reality itself. Life is an irreducible event 
amounting to my ongoing struggle with my circum-
stance. lf one wishes to go on employing terms like 
Erleben and Erlebnis to present life at the level ofpri-
mordiality, then one should strip them oftheir intellec-
tualistic and idealist connotations and lea ve them only 
with their basic signification -
namely, that which 
points to life as the happening in which something be-
falls me absolutely and cries out for my making sense 
of it, so that 1 may be able to li ve and go on living. Ac-
cordingly, 1 am no res cogitans or thinking being; 1 do 
not exist because 1 think, but the other way round: cog-
ito quia vivo. I think because 1 experience my being, 
without mediation or choice, as my struggle to exist in 
the world. In fact, 1 am a being who is condemned to 
translate this necessity into freedom. Freedom is born 
in and conditioned by such an encounter. 1 am thus 
a res dramatica, the drama enacted by myself in the 
world with things ofthe world. 
1 am aware of this encounter, but not by means 
of an explicit presentation. My glance is not directed 
upon my engagement with things in the same way as it 
is objectively conscious of and straightforwardly con-
cerned with them. The self-presence of my life is the 
paradox of its transparency, for my life is the neces-
sary and ongoing giving of itself to the things of the 
world ("Guillermo Dilthey," 1933-34 ). This, however, 
should not be misunderstood as ifit were a contempla-
tive affair. To begin with and always, living is, to some 
degree or other, "finding ... [myself] shipwrecked in 
the world" ("Centenario," 1930) and thus in need of 
guidance that cannot be dispensed with except at the 
perii of my life. (One could compare this notion with 
Heidegger's Geworfenheit.) In other words, thinking, 
in the formal acceptation of the word, cannot be my 
fundamental way of being connected with things, for 
when 1 set out to think 1 do so as a response to my pre-
intellectual and dialectica! relationship with them, to 
wit: the problematic situation that 1 already find myself 
living in, and that 1 have to overcome in order to be 
able to continue living with a modicum of sense. 
This brief categoria! analysis oflife is pregnant with 
consequences (cf. Un as lecciones de meta.fisica, 1932-
33 ). First of ali, it implies an interpretation of the his-
tory of philosophical reftection, and second, it cries out 
for a characterization of our POSTMODERN predicament. 
Already in 1916, while lecturing at the University of 
Buenos Aires, Ortega had succeeded in providing both. 
According to him, it is possible to take the movement 
of philosophical thought as a search for the absolute, 
which, in succession, is identified with the independent 
reality of the world (as conveyed by the metaphor of 
the wax tablet) among the thinkers of antiquity and 
the Middle Ages, and with the independent reality of 
thinking (as given expression by the metaphor of the 
container and its contents) among the thinkers of the 
modern era. The articulation of these two stages was 
provided by the critique of realism found at the heart 
of idealism; the articulation of the second phase and 
our postmodern situation is the critique of idealism that 
Ortega thought he had adequately carried out ("Las dos 
grandes metaforas," 1924). But again the outcome is 
to be a new metaphor, and he proposed that of Cas-
tor and Pollux, the Dioscuri, Gemini, or Twins who 
can exist only as Dii consentes or mutually consenting 
deities. This metaphor is useful to present the abso-
luteness of human life as a dual unity of reciprocity, 
and corresponds to the sense of Ortega's formula, "1 
am 1 and my circum-stance," provided that the "and" 
can be descriptively shown to be irreducible and not 
just a matter of appearance, inasmuch as it means the 
"dynamic dialogue between 'myself and my circum-
stance.'" 
To appreciate the full significance of Ortega's for-

JOSE ORTEGA Y GASSET

mula, one must underscore the fact that it contains at 
least two differeni senses of self or EGO. One of them 
is fundamental or grounding, and the other derivative 
or grounded. The former may be characterized as the 
awareness constitutive of life, that is to say, as the per-
formative or entitative availability of life to itself (or 
as life's being-for-itself, which is expressed by the first 
"I" of such a formula). The latter may be characterized 
as an awareness occurring in life, that is to say, as the 
consciousness in which I objectivate some matter of 
concern or other in the world (oras life's engagement 
with things, which is expressed by the second "I" of 
the formula). The failure to recognize this distinction 
and its irreducibility is the error of idealism. 
Self-reflection, as the mark ofhuman life, is thus no 
longer tobe mode led after objectivating consciousness. 
If it were, it would cancel itself in contradiction. The 
one-thinking-itself (der Sich-selbst-denkende) would 
then posit itself, as any positing activity (conscious-
ness) would, but that would be tantamount to pre-
supposing itself, i.e., to taking itself as its own ter-
minus, or as being already endowed with a (posited) 
nature. Now, ifanything, life is that which, ofnecessity, 
is always in the offing as that which is to be fashioned 
by itself. Hence life turns out to be the most elusive of 
"phenomena," for it is in no sense readily available, ei-
ther as one ofits products (the posited) oras any ofthe 
identifiable acts of (positing) consciousness. But nei-
ther is it reducible or merely retraceable to the temporal 
bed of such events or to the mental flow "springing" 
therefrom (Bewusstseinsstrom), as Husserl seems ulti-
mately to ha ve believed (i_,Que es conocimiento? [What 
is consciousness? 1929-31]; cf. Husserl 's Vorlesun-
gen zur Phdnomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins 
[ 1905]). Moreover, if any act of consciousness per-
formed by me -
i.e., by the second "I" of Ortega's 
formula -
is reflective in character (in a derivative 
sense), then the act that is being reflected upon (in-
cluding its reference to its NOEMA) must already be 
self-reflective ( or reflective in a primordial sense as a 
being-for-itself), or the terrors of infinite regress and 
the lack of final intelligibility would ensue. Life, there-
fore, is the "non-objective, straightforward entitative 
self-presencing ofbeing," the "sphere ofreflection in-
itself," or the domain of originary reflexivity wherein 
I (as the second "I" of Ortega's formula) actually find 
myself"immersed ... as it were, in a medium oflight." 
In view of this, one must say that Ortega's meta-
physical position clearly entails a radical reformula-
tion of the commerce of life and REASON. In a sense, 
he has "generalized" the concept of reason, for hu-
man life is seen by him, even in the most humble of 
its engagements, as an adventure consisting in making 
sense of self and world. However, in opposition to the 
physical-mathematical and technical forms of reason, 
which are only some ofits specialized styles ofperfor-
mance, "living reason" fundamentally proceeds on the 
basis ofthe why (what have I done or become?) and the 
whatfor (what amI aiming to do and transform myself 
into?). Hence the basic form ofreason is narrative and 
its character is historical, whether one is considering 
individual or collective life ("Historia como sistema," 
1935). We have occasion to appreciate this in terms of 
the logic of the unfolding of philosophical reflection, 
for, in order to think adequately, philosophers must 
first "understand the nature of the historical situation" 
in which they find themselves. Self-justification, in the 
sense just indicated, is the.first principle ofphilosophy. 
Consistent with this, phenomenology, like other philo-
sophical positions before it, was adjudged "naive" by 
Ortega to the extent that it left the nondoctrinal reasons 
motivating and requiring its emergence- i.e., the eri-
sis of idealism and modernity -
outside the scope of 
its examination. 
Ortega 's commitment to the clarification and justi-
fication ofthings in life, as the locus of experience and 
understanding, thus precluded him from falling prey 
to subjectivism or irrationalism (cf. El tema de nuestro 
tiempo, [The theme of our time, 1923 ]). Consistent 
with such a position, first philosophy or metaphysics 
was taken by him to be the endeavor to carry out the 
systematic categoria! analysis of life, which is possi-
ble only if life itself exhibits a systematic character. 
To be sure, that could not have been done by Ortega 
without the methods and tools belonging to pheno-
menology, and yet, as we have seen, his goal showed 
itself to be incompatible with Husserl 's account of the 
phenomenon "consciousness of," to the extent that his 
description of it is essentially inadequate. Ortega's step 
beyond Husserl amounted to seeing, first and foremost, 
that our individuallives are, pre-theoretically and with-
out mediation, at reality itself. Taking that step, how-
ever, did not imply for Ortega that metaphysics would 
be transformed into the "thinking of Being," as hap-

pened with Heidegger, or into an onto1ogy, whether in 
the form ofMARTIN HEIDEGGER's fundamentalproject in 
Sein und Zeit (1927), or in that ofNicolai Hartmann's 
regional onto1ogies, or in that of JEAN-PAUL SARTRE's EX-
ISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY in L 'etre et le neant (1943). 
And it could not have meant any such thing because 
Being, in any ofits forms, is "only endowed with sense 
as a question posed by a subject ... who is essentially 
a movement toward it" ("Filosofia pura," 1929). This 
movement is the endeavor to fathom itself that human 
life basically amounts to, and the manifo1d significa-
tions attributed to Being in the history ofthought are, in 
light of this, reducible to a "subsistent relationship" to 
human beings qua living reason ( even, by way of para-
dox, in the case of the idea of Being as the In-Itself). 
But ifthis is so, then Being is "only an hypothesis"-
perhaps the most radical o ne- that human life has pro-
duced for its se1f-interpretation (El hombre y la gen te, 
1949-50), yet an hypothesis nonethe1ess. Accordingly, 
those "disciplines," and the manners of thinking from 
which they arise, presuppose life as the radical reality 
and thus cannot come to constitute an ultimate "sci-
ence," which, in keeping with Ortega's position, may 
not be any other than metaphysics, if construed as the 
categoria! analytic ofhuman life.

PERCEPTION AFTER HUSSERL 
There are 
fi ve paradigms around which a taxonomy of contempo-
rary phenomenological accounts of perception might 
be organized. Rene Descartes is neither a phenomen-
ologist nor a contemporary, but his understanding of 
perception set the context and problem structure for 
debates concerning it in MODERN PHILOSOPHY, includ-
ing the contemporary challenges to modern thought, 
and his paradigm survives in contemporary schools of 
scientific or empirically oriented thinking. Descartes 
maintained a causal theory ofperception in which there 
are two kinds of causality operative. A real object or 
thing, extended in space and time, and transcendent to 
human consciousness, exerts a causal influence upon 
our organs of sense in such a manner as to generate a 
likeness or copy of itself in the imagination, the faculty 
of our minds that retains images. The imagination can 
also have a causal influence on the immanent image: 
it can separate aspects of the image ( e.g., its figure or 
shape, its color, its weight, odor, etc.) from each other 
and recombine them in different ways. This accounts 
for the "false and fantastic images" we ha ve in dream-
ing, hallucinating, etc. 
The Cartesian model generates the epistemological 
problem of determining whether the immanent image 
is a true copy of the transcendent thing. Since ali we 
know of the transcendent thing is what is revealed in 
the immanent image and there is no way to compare the 
two, the result is skepticism: we can never be certain 
that the information derived from perception provides 
veridical knowledge about the world. Ultimately, we 
ha veto trust in God that the faculties we are endowed 
with are reliable for practica! purposes. The real world 
is known only to God, and finite human minds can only 
approximate that measure. 
IMMANUEL KANT introduced the paradigm that has 
been most influential on the deve!opment of pheno-
menology, the transcendental model. Like Descartes, 
Kant established the measure of ultimate truth about 
the world in terms of the God he held to have cre-
ated it. God is the ens realissimum, the most real thing, 
but is unknown to finite humans. God and the world, 
or "thing-in-itself," are noumenal; they are absolutely 
transcendent to human cognition, beyond the realm of 
human experience. We must presuppose that God and 
the thing-in-itself exist, however, in order to give ac-
counts of our own existence and the existence of the 
phenomenal world, i.e., the world as we experience it. 
Kant follows Descartes in conceiving perception as 
the result of two kinds of causality. (1) Our sensations 
-
sounds, colors, odors, tastes, textures, etc.- are the 
raw data produced in us somehow by the action ofthe 
thing-in-itself upon our sense organs. These raw data 
are fleeting and incoherent. (2) They are organized or 
synthesized into abiding objects standing in stable rela-
tions to one another by mental faculties known as "pure 
forms of intuition" and "categories of the understand-
ing." Space and time, as pure forms of intuition, are 
immanent structures that account for the fact that we 
perceive objects as extended in three dimensions and 
events as succeeding one another in a one-dimensional 
linear sequence. 
Our science consists in knowledge, not ofthe world 
in itself, but of the phenomenal world, the world as 
mediated by the categories governing our manner of 
understanding. One of the key categories is causality. 
The laws of science reflect our manner of synthesizing 
or unifying experience according to causal relations. 
Thus (a) the matter of perception is attributed to an 
origin in the transcendent or noumenal domain, but 
(b) the form of perceptual experience is explained by 
the transcendental or organizing activity of our mental 
faculties. The phenomenal world is an immanent do-
main, that is, a human domain constituted by us, and 
what we know of it cannot be asserted tobe true ofthe 
thing-in-itself. 
The account of perception in EDMUND HUSSERL rad-
icalizes Kant's transcendental approach through a 
methodology known as the transcendental EPOCHE AND 
REDUCTION. Kant had argued that since our cognition 
is limited to the phenomenal domain structured by the 
pure forms and categories ofhuman understanding, we 
can neither claim to ha ve knowledge of the thing-in-
itselfnor apply the structures making up human experi-
ence to the noumenal domain, the transcendent world. 
Husserl notes that natural scientists do not observe this

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
restriction, but typically contend that the laws of sci-
ence govem the "real world," the world transcendent 
to or independent ofhuman cognition. He regards this 
attitude as both naive and natural. The transcendental 
epoche suspends the thesis ofthe natural attitude, this 
thesis being the taken-for-granted beliefthat we expe-
rience the world as it is in itself. This belief can be 
"bracketed" or "placed in abeyance." Working within 
the purified sphere, one regards the objects of expe-
rience as objects of experience, i.e., as phenomena, 
and not as real things existing apart from us. In other 
words, we "intend" objects or constitute objects as real, 
but the phenomenologist takes the intentiona! object as 
just that, an object constituted by consciousness. 
Husserl argues that this INTENTIONALITY of con-
sciousness is its defining characteristic. He maintains 
that "ali consciousness is consciousness of an object," 
claiming thereby that the activity whereby conscious-
ness directs itselftoward its objects consists of a formal 
synthesis over time of the features that define the ob-
ject as it is experienced. In the perceptual domain, he 
observes that although we see objects one si de ata time 
( e.g., we can see at most only three facets of a cubical 
object in any one perspectiva! viewing), we synthesize 
the various views or "adumbrations" into a six-faceted 
intentiona! object. We intend the object or constitute 
the object as six-sided, as a cube, even though strictly 
speaking we are only ever witness to three, because 
we link or synthesize the adumbrations into a unity or 
totality. So long as we refrain from makingjudgments 
about the transcendent world and restrict ourselves to 
the domain of phenomena, we can be assured that our 
assertions about the latter are certain because there is 
a coincidence of what we experience evidentially and 
what we assert or judge to be the case. If I say that 
there exists a cube in the transcendent domain, I may 
be mistaken, but I cannot be wrong in saying that I 
intend this object now present to my consciousness as 
a six-sided figure, ali of whose facets are constituted 
as square. 
Perception is privileged among the other possible 
"noetic modes" of consciousness ( e.g., MEMORY, IMAG-
INATION, EXPECTATION) in that it provides the starting 
point for phenomenological analysis. We take the per-
ceptually given,just as it is given, without making any 
theoretical claims about what caused it to be given 
(because any such claim could never be warranted by 
experiential EVIDENCE), and then go on to describe the 
constitutive acts and receptivities performed by con-
sciousness in the active and passive syntheses whereby 
it intends the object as an object of a certain kind. 
So conceived, perception is an intentiona! act of con-
sciousness that structures sensory contents (the ma-
terial of sensation or what Husserl sometimes calls 
"hyletic data") with MEANING originating within con-
sciousness. 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER was one of Husserl's students, 
perhaps his most famous, who developed phenomen-
ology along existentiallines. Instead oftaking science 
as the foca! point of his philosophical inquiry, Hei-
degger concerned himself with the full spectrum of 
human existence. Whereas Husserl tended to regard 
consciousness as disengaged, reflective, spectatorial 
thought, Heidegger took up the standpoint of DASEIN, 
literally "being-there," referring to human existence in 
ali its rich complexity, including such everyday modal-
ities of engagement as care and mood in addition to re-
flective distantiation. Heidegger has also been regarded 
as a transcendental thinker in the Kantian tradition, 
that is, as someone attuned to the human proclivity 
to project our own existential structures ( or "Existen-
tialien," to use his term) upon the world in which we 
dwell, but in Heidegger 's case, it is not clear that ali the 
meaning ofhuman experience derives from projection. 
In his best-known book, Sein und Zeit (1927), Hei-
degger writes as though we perceive the world at 
the most fundamental level as an equipment complex 
(Zeugganzheit) or totality of things structured around 
their use. Instead of seeing objects as removed from 
the context of human concerns, Heidegger argues that 
our primordial or most basic contact with things takes 
place ata level in which we take them for granted, even 
overlook them, because we concentrate on what we are 
doing with them, what we are using them for. For ex-
ample, it is only when a tool breaks that we begin to 
pay attention to the item for its own sake. Within this 
schema, perception might be regarded along Husser-
lian lines as transcendental projection on the part of 
Dasein, but with the constitutive framework oriented 
around goal-directedness and utility rather than cogni-
tion for its own sake. 
In the same book, however, Heidegger follows a line 
ofthought that might be seen as a departure from tran-
scendental thought insofar as it involves a suspension 

PERCEPTION AFTER HUSSERL 
515 
ofthe projection ofhuman categories. Heidegger refers 
to this using the Greek term aletheia, which designates 
at the same time both "truth" and "unforgetfulness." 
The idea here is that the knowing of a thing involved 
in using it is an overlooking or forgetfulness of the 
thing because it subsumes the thing under the struc-
tures of our concerns, and that the thing itself might 
reveal itself in a different way if we just Jet it be. To 
Jet be (sein lassen) in this manner is not to ignore or 
neglect something, but to still one's own concems and 
attend to the thing or attune oneself to it on its own 
terms as one might give oneself over to the sound of 
music in a manner of listening that is neither merely 
active nor merely passive but both. 
In !ater works, Heidegger uses the German term 
"Ereignis" ~ 
"event" or "appropriation" ~ 
to refer to 
the way in which in perception, things claim or appro-
priate us just as we are intent upon grasping or appro-
priating them. Things steadfastly remain themselves 
as they traverse the opening provided by aletheia and 
come into the place (Stelle) or context of finite hu-
man concerns. Since at the primordiallevel, Dasein is 
unmindful of itself when engaged in perception, one 
might picture Heidegger's paradigm of perception as 
the emergence of a thing within the finite framework 
(Gestell) established by the manner in which Dasein is 
tacitly attuned to Being at a given moment. ("Being" 
here refers to the broadest horizon functioning as the 
latent context of Oase in 's attunement to the world at 
large.) 
JEAN-PAUL 
SARTRE, heaviJy infiuenced by both 
Husserl and Heidegger, conceived perception much as 
did Husserl, with two important modifications. 
( 1) Sartre does not refrain from making an onto-
logica! or existential claim about the domain of tran-
scendence, to which he referred as "being-in-itself' 
(''l'etre-en-soi"), but does refrain from making episte-
mological or knowledge claims about it. "It is," Sartre 
said, and "it is in-itself," but that is all that can be said 
about it. Being-in-itself is one of two "transphenom-
enal phenomena"; it is the phenomenon that accounts 
for the being of every phenomenon, but that always 
appears as mediated or constituted by consciousness, 
and hence cannot be known as it is in itself. "Being-
for-itself' ("! 'etre-pour-soi") is Sartre's term for con-
sciousness, the other transphenomenal phenomenon; it 
is the one that defines or delimits all phenomena. Con-
sciousness, the nothingness referred to in the title of 
Sartre's major work, L 'etre et le neant (1943), projects 
its negativity into the world as the defining edge or 
limit of the perceptual gestalt that gives the figure its 
perceptual meaning against the relatively undefined 
background ofthe world. 
(2) Whereas Husserl regarded consciousness as 
grounded in the structures of a transcendental EGO, 
Sartre adopts a non-egological view of consciousness 
and conceives consciousness as absolutely ungrounded 
and radically free. The for-itself, or consciousness, is 
"condemned to be free"; that is, it is not bound by any 
innate structure in its activity of projecting meaning 
into the phenomenal world. Consciousness, however, 
always finds itselfin a particular situation or historical 
context, and is inclined to fiee the burden of freedom 
and responsibility by fali ing into the habitual structures 
operative in its situation. 
Sartre designates this fiight from freedom as "bad 
faith," a form of self-deception in which the for-itself 
seeks to ground its projections by adopting prevalent 
forms of projecting meaning, thereby gaining the ap-
proval of popular sentiment, but at the expense of its 
own authenticity. The doctrine of bad faith, then, ac-
counts for the regularity and predictability of socially 
regulated forms ofperception such as racism and sex-
ism. One may see persons of a different race or eul-
ture as inferior, not because they are, but because one 
seeks to evade responsibility for seeing them in a cre-
ative manner (i.e., in accordance with one's freedom 
to project one's own meaning upon the world and its 
denizens ), and falls back upon the norms prevalent in 
one's situation. 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, Sartre's friend and coedi-
tor with him ofthe avant-garde magazine, Les Temps 
Modernes, until a falling out over politica! issues, de-
parted sharply from Sartre on epistemological and on-
tologica! issues centering around questions concerning 
perception. He is best known for his seminal work 
on the philosophical implications of human embodi-
ment and his innovative ontology based on the notion 
ofthe "fiesh ofthe world." Like Sartre, Merleau-Ponty 
was heavily influenced by the phenomenological think-
ing of Husserl and Heidegger, but he took this line of 
thought in new directions using GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY. 
Perception played a central ro le in Merleau-Ponty's 
thinking throughout his career. Shortly after the publi-

516 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
cation of his major work, Phenomimologie de la per-
ception ( 1945), he wrote that "the perceived world is 
the always presupposed foundation of all rationality, 
all value and ali existence." Since the fallibility ofper-
ception has been a dominant theme in Westem philos-
ophy sin ce the time of the ancient Greeks, this thesis 
amounts to a significant revision of the tradition. It 
is based upon the thought that perception provides a 
paradigm for veridicality. Whereas the tradition had 
sought for nonperceptual criteria to use in determining 
the reliability of perception, Merleau-Ponty reverses 
this in declaring that it is from perception that we de-
rive our most basic model of valid knowledge. 
This claim immediately runs up against the various 
arguments from illusion that have traditionally pro-
vided the basis for distrusting perception: sometimes 
we know that we are deceived by perceptual experi-
ence, e.g., we see a person on a walk through the woods 
only to discover that it was an oddly shaped tree, not a 
person at ali. But Merleau-Ponty points out that the dis-
covery of perceptual error is itself a perceptual event; 
perception thus provides the basic paradigm for the 
discovery and rectification of error. Just as the waking 
world dispels the dream, making it difficult or even 
impossible to recall, so in the unfolding of perceptual 
experience, the resolution of uncertainty in the veridi-
cal perception displaces the errancy of the perceptual 
quest for trustworthy understanding. 
Merleau-Ponty conceives perception as a complex 
interaction taking place between the human BODY and 
the woRLD. Sin ce the traditional dis trust of perception 
was correlated with a derogation ofthe body and eleva-
tion ofthe mind, his attention to the body as the core of 
human understanding and spirituality also amounts to a 
philosophical revolution. Bodily motility- including 
retina! focusing, manual probing, and selectivity ofthe 
senses working together in synaesthesia- reveals that 
the body is both active and questing as well as passive 
and receptive in its interrogation ofthe world: how the 
world reveals itselfto us is a function ofthe manner in 
which we attune ourselves to it. 
Merleau-Ponty conceives the relationship of the 
lived body and the perceptual world as one of re-
versibility: the truth of empiricism is that our percep-
tual powers adjust themselves to the world and take 
the measure of reality from worldly things. But there 
is a truth to transcendental claims too: what we take 
from the world is also a function of our expectations, 
which vary according to our conceptual framework, 
cultural setting, attitude, even the range of sensitivity 
of our sense organs. The result is an understanding of 
perception as reciproca! accommodation ofworld and 
body that reveals the real world, but reveals it only to 
the extent that the body is capable of perceiving it. 
The tree we see is real and our vision is trustwor-
thy, but we might see more if our eyes were capable 
of seeing beyond the current limits of vision, which 
stop before ultraviolet and infrared. Furthermore, the 
perceptual world has the capacity to draw us out of 
conceptual and cultural predispositions: it has taught 
us, against expectation, that tobacco is not an enhance-
ment to life, that bloodletting does not restore health, 
and that different races are equally human. 
Merleau-Ponty's reversibility thesis led him to de-
velop an ontology in which the classical oppositions of 
mind vs. body, selfvs. other, spirituality vs. corporeal-
ity, thought vs. matter, etc., give way to the model of 
the flesh of the world folding back upon itself. When 
I touch a tree or a person, when I feei a breeze or dip 
my hand into running water, the event that takes place 
is that of one manifestation ofworldly corporeality in-
teracting with another: I could not touch the tree if I 
were not touched by the tree, nor could I see the tree 
were I not visible myself and capable of being seen 
from the perspective defined by the standpoint of the 
tree. The tree and I retain our individual identities -
one of us will li ve after the other dies -
but we are 
both emergences ofthe flesh ofthe world, and our in-
terdependence did not begin with our births nor will it 
end with our deaths. 
JACQUES DERRIDA might well be regarded as the cen-
tral figure in the contemporary movement known as 
POSTMODERNISM. The philosophy of deconstruction has 
grown up around his writings. His thought is relevant 
here because it poses a strong counterthesis to the var-
ious phenomenological accounts of perception. In a 
phrase, Derrida's contention is that "there never was 
any 'perception' ... " This is not as radical a thesis as 
this phrase, taken out of context, might indicate. In fact, 
Derrida argues against a relatively narrow view ofper-
ception taken from his interpretation of Husserl. In this 
view, perception consists in a coincidence oftwo forms 
of presence: the presence of a perceptual abject to con-
sciousness, and the presence of consciousness to itself. 

PERCEPTION IN HUSSERL 
517 
As noted above, Husserl grounded one of his claims 
to apodicticity on the coincidence of a judgment ( e.g., 
I see the chair) with the state of affairs judged (e.g., 
the chair actually seen): if there is no difference be-
tween these two, then it is impossible for the judgment 
to be false. Derrida maintains that there is, indeed, a 
difference here, that to see the chair as a chair and as 
identica! to itself over time requires the functioning of 
an ideality, the idea of "chair," which itself depends 
on the functioning of a signifier ( or a "trace") capa-
ble of providing the linkage between the temporally 
dispersed representations ofthe object in question. 
Derrida's paradigm might be regarded as a variation 
ofKant's, described above. AII our representations are 
mediated by formal idealities, hence there is never any 
direct presentation of the thing itself. He differs from 
Kant, however, in his understanding of the nature of 
this mediation. Kant described the mediation as in-
volving pure forms of intuition and pure categories of 
the understanding, both of which he regarded as uni-
versal and necessary. Derrida conceives the mediation 
as involving the play of signifiers, taken as traces that 
displace the trace left or inscribed on the sensory ap-
paratus prior to any conscious awareness or perceptual 
experience of the abject. These mediators are neither 
universal nor necessary, but subject to such vicissitudes 
as the historical evolution of systems of signifiers. 
In Derrida 's view, what we take as a percep-
tual presentation is actually a RE-PRESENTATION (Verge-
genwartigung). The perception of a chair, for example, 
does not involve a coincidence of seeing and judging, 
but rather the tacit subsumption ofthis perceptual ab-
ject under the ideality "chair" (i.e., the seeing of the 
chair as a chair) and thus differs from itself insofar as 
the abiding ideality differs from the momentary per-
cept. There is also an intrinsic moment of deferring 
in the perception insofar as the object adumbrated is 
seen as an aspect of a totality (i.e., the chair as it is it-
self, which comprises the totality of adumbrations) that 
can never be apprehended, but functions as the ideal 
synthesis that regulates our sense of a finally adequate 
vision. This play of differing and deferring, designated 
by Derrida in the neologism "differance," is necessar-
ily at work in the process we caii perception; hence, 
if what is meant by "perception" is the coincidence 
asserted by Husserl, then "there never was any 'per-
ception.'"

PERCEPTION IN HUSSERL 
M. C. DILLON

All experiences 
in which something is "itself present" to someone are 
included under the broad concept of perception by 
EDMUND HUSSERL. This distinguishes perceiving from 
other types of experiences such as the IMAGINATION, 
MEMORY, Of EXPECTATION of a physica! thing where we 
do not have the sense of encountering the original in 
person but rather of envisioning or reproducing such 
an encounter. 
Husserl 's definition extends the concept of percep-
tion beyond sensory perception. Ideas- for instance, 
propositions- are "perceived" when we actively and 
insightfully produce them. Retention, the conscious-
ness of the just past, although not perception in the 
full sense, is "perceptive" because it gives us the orig-
inal, although not as now present. It is rather original

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
consciousness ofthe past. There is thus a tendency for 
Husserl to call "perception" ali forms of consciousness 
of an original resulting in a concept of perception that 
coincides with his concept of"EVIDENCE." 
Within this broad generic concept, there are differ-
ent specific forms of"perception" relating to different 
kinds of objects or dimensions of reality. Sensory per-
ception is one species and is original consciousness 
of spatiotemporal objects. This species of perception 
is emphasized by Husserl, and that emphasis will be 
followed in the remainder ofthis entry. 
In Husserl's early work, e.g., Logische Unter-
suchungen ( 1900--1901 ), the topic of sensory percep-
tion is discussed mostly in logica! and epistemological 
contexts, particu1arly in connection with the develop-
ment of a theory ofthe verification ofthought. Here the 
ma in concern is to produce a detailed analysis of per-
ception that identifies the characteristics that contribute 
to its privileged epistemic ro le in verification and to de-
velop a theory of conciousness that relates perception 
to other forms of awareness in a way that emphasizes 
what these other forms derive oftheir nature from their 
relationship to perception. Logica! and epistemologi-
cal issues remained a context for Husserl 's writings on 
perception throughout his career. One notable devel-
opment beyond the early work was the working out 
of a genetic phenomenology of the relationship of per-
ception and thought, which one finds in works such as 
Analysen zur passiven Synthesis [ 1918-26], Formale 
und transzendentale Logik ( 1929), and Erfahrung und 
Urteil ( 1939). This effort involved such things as trac-
ing logica! syntax, such as the disjunctive form, back 
to the experience ofperceptual conflict. 
Partly because of problems encountered in the 
pursuit of that concern, and also for other motives, 
Husserl 's discussion ofperception broadened into what 
could be called an "ontologica!" direction wherein 
perception's ro1e in the existence and composition of 
the world of human experience is analyzed. Of the 
work Husserl published, this direction is most evi-
dent in Ideen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 (1913) and Carte-
sianische Meditationen [ 1931]. The account below will 
attempt to relate to both the epistemological and onto-
logica! aspects of the theory. 
According to Husserl, the "objects" of perceptual 
experiences are originally "constituted" in those expe-
riences. This is the central idea ofHusserl's coNSTITU-
TIVE PHENOMENOLOGY of perception. This idea is best 
understood within the context of his effort to develop 
a theory of REASON that would safeguard reason from 
cultural developments that he thought threatened it. 
Among other things, he saw PSYCHOLOGISM in logica! 
theory and NATURALISM in the philosophies of the NAT-
URAL and HUMAN SCIENCES as harmfu] deve]opments. 
Husserl 's theory addressed the naturalistic theories 
of perception that were involved in these develop-
ments. He sought to give an account of perception that 
was not based on any assumptions about the world, 
an account where both the objective reference of per-
ceptions and their role in producing knowledge could 
be understood without postulating any mundane re-
lationship between the objects of perception and the 
perceiving mind. In his theory, the capacity ofpercep-
tual consciousness to be consciousness of something 
objective, i.e., its INTENTIONALITY, is an intrinsic fea-
ture of perception, something that can be accounted 
for without assuming the existence of a world of ob-
jects causally interacting with consciousness. 
Proceeding by actively abstaining from such as-
sumptions (by using the method of phenomenological 
EPOCHE AND REDUCTION), the theory deve]oped as a form 
of idealism ("transcendental idealism"). However, the 
theory also had a component of realism. Husserl sought 
to address problems about the objective reference of 
consciousness that stemmed from Cartesian dualism 
-
problems that had led to important forms of natu-
ralism -
with a theory that tried to show how expe-
riences of perceiving can and do ha ve as their objects 
the very mundane objects that we normally experience 
our WORLD to consist of, and to explain how these ob-
jects ha ve the features that they ha ve for us in ordinary 
experience. Thus the existence ofthe world of normal 
experience is not at all denied by the theory. Rather, an 
account of how we can perceive it is one of its main 
goals. 
The idea of the intrinsic intentionality of percep-
tion is captured in Husserl's concept of"constitution." 
According to him, the world is "constituted" in con-
sciousness. This can be taken to mean that the "being 
on hand" ( Vorhandenheit) of the world, i.e., its pres-
ence to us, or else its being there for us as available 
to become present, is achieved through suitably struc-
tured processes of consciousness. In Husser1's theory, 

PERCEPTION IN HUSSERL 
519 
constituting the world in the mode of presence is the 
specific function of sensory perception. 
Husserl's idea of constitution is that whatever is on 
hand to us is present or there as available tobe present 
only through processes of consciousness whose own 
composition corresponds to the particularity ofwhat is 
on hand. Perceiving something, then, is not in any re-
spect like an empty, featureless opening onto the world 
that allows the world to impress its nature onto our 
mind. The encounter with any object involves a highly 
specific "way ofbeing conscious" without which there 
could not be an experience of that object. Moreover, 
such "ways ofbeing conscious" make possible the very 
basic sense of "encounter" and produce the sense of 
the world being ready-made and already there in such 
a way that we have the sense of discovering it through 
our perceptions. 
Perceptual experience operates, then, on two levels. 
On one level, it seems to function to inform us about a 
spatiotemporal world that is given to it as already there 
and ready-made. Such an understanding ofperception 
is part of our "natural attitude" toward the world and 
our relation to it. But on a deeper level this very un-
derstanding and the experiences ofthe world on which 
it is based are the result of a productive functioning of 
subjectivity that "constitutes" the world of experience. 
Husserl 's "world-constitutive" theory of perception 
proceeds from the idea that whatever feature of the 
world is considered, the account of the perception of 
that feature must never rely on the assumption that it 
is simply there, but must find the relevant processes of 
consciousness that achieve awareness of that feature. 
Phenomenological investigations of perception, then, 
result in identifying sets of correlations between fea-
tures of the world as experienced and components of 
consciousness that achieve those features. 
Husserl identifies three major components of per-
ceptual experience that function together to make it 
intrinsically intentiona!. A perception of something 
comes about when ( 1) sensory contents of conscious-
ness motivate and sustain (2) an interpretive content 
in a certain way such as to give rise to (3) awareness 
of an "object as experienced." Each of these contents 
requires further discussion. 
The sensory contents of perception, called "sen-
sory data" or "hyletic data," are parts of the temporal 
flow of mental life and are constituted in inner TIME-
consciousness. They are qualitatively distinctive and 
diverse phenomena, sometimes of complex organiza-
tion, the flow ofwhich in our mentallives does not by 
itself amount to an experience of anything, i.e., does 
not present us with something identica! and identifiable 
across time. They are, however, the bearers of inten-
tionality in that they can motivate and sustain "noeses," 
i.e., interpretive or "sense-giving" components within 
the same perceptual experiences, and then take on an 
objectifying ro le. For example, a flow of qualitatively 
particular auditory sensations within someone's men-
tal life can become part of the experiencing of the 
sound of a telephone ringing in the next room if it can 
support the relevant spatial and generic apprehensions. 
Unlike many other theories of perception, in Husserl 's 
theory sensory data do not become parts of what is 
experienced, but rather remain as components of the 
experiencing of it. 
One's entire waking (and dreaming) life is filled 
with fields of sensory data. There is a distinct and sep-
arate field for each of the senses and the fields are or-
ganized according to various associative connections. 
There are hyletic data correlated with both the struc-
tural and qualitative aspects of what is perceived, and 
it is in virtue of this correlation that hyletic data con-
tribute to the intrinsic intentionality ofperception. For 
instance, there is a field ofvisual hyletic data that cor-
relates with the visible sector of the world. Among 
other things, this hyletic field contains correlates to the 
spatiality ofthe world through the "quasi-space" ofthe 
visual hyletic field. 
When we perceive something, we are aware of some 
of its features in an intuitive way -
we actually see, 
feei, hear them. This "fullness" ofthe visible colors,felt 
surface qualities, etc., correlates with the hyletic data. 
It is in part due to this fullness that objects, environ-
ments, etc., are experienced as "themselves present." 
Hyletic data thus perform a very important function 
within rational consciousness. As the intrinsic factors 
in experience that help "achieve" the "embodied pres-
ence" of objects, they help rationally to motivate a 
perceptual belief in the reality of objects and of the 
world in general and to give perception the special 
epistemic value that it has in relation to other modes of 
consciousness of objects. 
The bestowing of sense correlates with "what" the 
perceived is experienced tobe in a particular act of per-

520 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ception. This "what" includes ali the features (generic, 
individual, and relational) that the object is experi-
enced to ha ve in that perception. Hyletic data can often 
sustain different sense-bestowings in that they can un-
derdetermine the sense-bestowings that they support, 
making perceptual error possible about what, how, or 
even that an object is. By the same token, the disclo-
sure of perceptual error can and most often does take 
place within perception, when new experience better 
supports a different sense-bestowal. 
Error and correction of error are made possible by 
an anticipatory dimension ofperception. In bestowing 
sense, consciousness projects in more or less specific 
ways what would be experienced of its object in the 
immediate fu ture, in continuing cxperience ofthe same 
object, and anticipates a future that will be consistent 
with and thus sustain the operative sense-bestowal. On 
occasion, expectations are disappointed as experience 
proceeds, and this motivates a retroactive reinterpreta-
tion and corrected apprehension. 
Husserl envisions that in an extreme case, sensory 
data could ensue in such a way that no sense-bestowal 
could be sustained, because ali anticipation would be 
disappointed and experience would become chaotic, 
possibly even to the extent that our normal perceptual 
belief in the actuality and being on hand of the world 
(the "natural attitude") would cease to exist and thus 
we would no longer ha ve a world. In this way, Husserl 
determines the correlate of the actuality of the world 
to be the coherence of perceptual experience insofar 
as it motivates and sustains the natural attitude. While 
this determination continues a thought of the modern 
rationalist tradition, Husserl 's analyses supporting his 
view surpass those of ali predecessors, chiefiy due to 
the superiority of his analysis of time-consciousness. 
Sensory data and noeses are "really intrinsic" (reel[) 
components of experiences, components that ha ve their 
individual identity determined by the temporality ofthe 
experience of which they are a part, in particular by 
their locus in subjective time. There are other parts of 
experiences, however, that are not really intrinsic parts. 
One example ofthis outside ofthe realm ofperception 
is the experienced verbal MEANING of an act of think-
ing or of speaking. Meanings are parts of experiences 
in the sense that they are dependent on them for their 
existence. However, their individual identity is not tied 
to the temporality ofthe experiences ofwhich they are 
a part; rather, they are capable of being repeated as 
numerically the same in any number of experiences. 
And unlike worldly objects that have "real" existence, 
they have "ideal" existence. This means that their in-
dividual identity is not determined by spatiotemporal 
factors. The same (numerically identica!) meaning can 
be apprehended in numerically different acts ofthought 
of different persons in different places at the same time. 
Husserl claimed that perceptual experiences con-
tain an ideal component called a "NOEMA" and that 
consciousness is structured as a noetic-noematic corre-
lation. The really intrinsic components of a perception 
are correlated with features its object is experienced to 
have in the perception, but these features might not be 
features ofthe object as it actually is (as future experi-
ence will determine it tobe). Or it may be that (as fu ture 
experience would show) the perceived object does not 
really exist at al!. Despite such eventualities, there be-
longs to every perception the "object as experienced." 
Husserl terms the object as experienced the "noematic 
sense" (Sinn) of a perception and claims that it belongs 
to the perception as an inseparable, ideal (not reell) 
part. 
The "object as perceived" is not a part of nature, 
Husserl claims, and has no natural properties. This de-
terrnination is of great significance for Husserl 's theory 
of perception, for it is one of the chief ways that he 
sought to combat naturalism in epistemology. It does 
this by making knowledge- whether in the form of 
the productofperceptual exploration (which involves a 
continua! synthesis ofperceptual senses) or in the form 
of the verification of thought by perception (a synthe-
sis of linguistic and perceptual senses)- the result of 
ideal syntheses, i.e., syntheses of ideal entities. Such 
syntheses are subject to ontologica! or logica! norms, 
and not naturallaws. 
Husserl finds that the noematic sense is an "abstract 
form" within the "full" noema. The fu li noema contains 
characteristics of the "object as experienced" that are 
not "parts" or "features" of the "object" per se, such 
as the reality status with which the object appears and 
the clarity or obscurity ofpresentation. It also includes 
features that relate to the kind of experience to which 
the noematic sense belongs. Thus the "same" noematic 
sense can be part oftwo different experiences, such as 
an act ofthought and an act ofperception. This makes 
it possible for perception to verify thought: the identity 

PERCEPTION IN HUSSERL 
521 
of sense allows the two types of experience to come 
together by being about "the same" in a strict sense, 
and the difference in the way that the object is given 
in each type of experience provides the basis for their 
different epistemic values. 
Given that an object has more features than it is ex-
perienced to ha ve and that this fact is part of our aware-
ness of the object, the perceptual noema has within it 
the "idea" of a fully determined object, a component 
of the perceptual sense that Husserl calls the "deter-
minable X." The idea of the fully determined object 
functions teleologically: it attracts afuture directed in-
terest in perceptual exploration of an object and thus 
provides a basic epistemic orientation to life. In con-
nection with this, the idea of a fully determined object 
motivates "co-presentational" act-components within 
the noesis, which together make up what Husserl calls 
the "inner horizon" of a perceptual experience. These 
components are not "borne" by sensory data and have 
ali the non-intuitionally fu li aspects of the perceptual 
sense as correlates. Such aspects relate to the non-
visible parts of material things, for example. The co-
presentations set out sense-components consistent with 
the idea of the object as that which is posited on the 
basis of the intuitional moments. 
These co-presentations provide the basis for the 
anticipations discussed above that arise during the 
course of perceptual exploration of an object. In this 
exploration, syntheses are experienced wherein co-
presentations give rise to anticipations that are fulfilled 
or disappointed as intuitional moments enter into iden-
tity syntheses with moments that are not intuitional. 
Husserl thought that provided they progressed harmo-
niously along certain lines, such syntheses maintained 
and increased in rational power a positing of "actually 
existing" objects and an "actually existing" world. It 
is through this idea of synthesis that Husserl's ace o unt 
of perceptual intentionality begins to realize the goal 
of solving problems about the objective reference of 
perception that were created by Cartesian dualism. 
This brief account has of necessity left out severa! 
aspects of Husserl 's theory ofperception. Among these 
is the topic of kinaesthesia (consciousness of move-
ment), to which Husserl devoted many analyses in his 
phenomenology ofthe BODY. This is an aspect ofper-
ception opened up by Husserl 's thought that MAURJCE 
MERLEAU-PONTY has developed extensively. 
Numerous lines of inquiry concerning perception 
have been opened up by Husserl and provide oppor-
tunities for creative phenomenological work. One of 
these concerns Husserl's claim that perception has an 
ideal component, the noema (and noematic sense). In-
vestigations are particularly needed to learn more about 
the nature ofthis ideality in order to answer questions 
about any possible subjection to some kind of non-
naturalistic historical change, which have serious im-
plications for a Husserlian phenomenological theory 
of knowledge and truth. In addition, Husserl 's claims 
about the privileged ro le of perception in relation to 
other kinds of experience deserve more investigation 
in light ofthe criticisms of JACQUES DERRJDA and others, 
who have seen more relative originality and epistemic 
value in signitive and other non-intuitional forms of 
consciousness than Husserl seems to allow. Finally, 
Husserl's use of hyletic sensory data in his theory has 
for a long time aroused controversy. There is first of 
ali a real need for a work of scholarship that gives a 
comprehensive picture of Husserl's theory of sensory 
data and then some original investigations aimed at 
settling some ofthe concerns that ha ve been raised, for 
exampJe, in the work of ARON GURWITSCH.

PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 
The 
term "anthropology" appears in the 16th century, at 
about the same time as "psychology" and in the con-
text of German Scholastic philosophy. Magnus Hundt's 
Anthropologium de hominis dignitate, natura et pro-
prietatibus, de elementis, partibus corporis humani, 
physiognomia etc. appears in Leipzig in 1501. Otto 
Casmann, a pupi! of Rudolph Goclenius (the latter 
had brought out a work entitled Psychologia in 1590), 
wrote a Psychologia anthropologia sive animae hu-
manae doctrina (1594); its second part appears as An-
thropologiae Pars II, h.e. de fabrica humani corporis 
methodice descripta ( 1596). The definition of anthro-
pology as "doctrina humanae naturae" encompasses 
here the bodily characteristics of humans as well as 
their spiritual-psychic and moral dignity (including 
their fallibility). Odo Marquard's claim that the school 
philosophy ofthat time had thereby freed itselffrom the 
theologically oriented metaphysical tradition is exag-
gerated and seems infiuenced by !ater developments. It 
underestimates the "theomorphic" approach to human 
beings even in 20th century anthropology. Marquard 
sees the point of departure for the concept of anthro-
pology in the question of how the human being is to 
be understood, ifnot (any longer) through metaphysics 
and not (yet) through mathematical-experimental sci-
ence. But this is anachronistic and unhistorical. 
IMMANUEL KANT divides his Anthropologie in prag-
matischer Hinsicht ( 1798) into the physiological and 
the pragmatic, and the latter is clearly motivated 
by the moral-metaphysical considerations of "self-
responsibility" and the "divine voice of conscience" 
according to his Metaphysik des Sitten (Metaphysics 
of morals, 1797). This shows the thoroughly religious 
basis of the humanism that comes to the fore as "hu-
manity" in Kant's practica) imperative and serves as the 
basis for the pragmatic anthropology that asks "what 
can or should human beings as free agents make of 
themselves?" True, Kant wanted to make anthropology 
into a "proper academic discipline"; he even wanted to 
make it the source of all the practica! subjects of morals, 
manners, and education. But this source hardly seems 
tobe a science. Even for Kant it is more like a collection 
ofinteresting observations leading to worldly wisdom, 
which he !ater calls "anthropology from a pragmatic 
standpoint." This is clearly a "philosophical anthropol-
ogy," but it is neither a critically organized metaphysics 
nor a rigorous special science like physics. 
It does ha ve a metaphysical perspective for ordering 
and interpreting the manifold phenomena ofhuman re-
ality it observes, right down to physical geography. The 
metaphysical orientat!on of Kant's pragmatic anthro-
pology is expressed in the notion that human beings 
can have a representation of the "I," and that the hu-
man being is thereby elevated above all other beings on 
earth. Through the unity of consciousness the human 
being is a person, a being completely different in rank 
and dignity from things. For philosophy, the question 
of man -
as anthropology -
comes to encompass 
all other questions. Accordingly, anthropology cannot 
be compared structurally with other "ologies": for one 
thing, the human being cannot be divided up into areas, 
and for another, the human being actively brings forth 
such things as sciences and, in particular, anthropology 
itself. 
By the turn of the 19th century it is already clear 
that the theme of anthropology is not only the nature of 
man, but also the problem of experience, which is -
more broadly than in Kant- that of man 's total con-
crete encounter with and understanding of the world. 
Occasioned by the attempt to acquire, ground, and sci-
entifically order experiences about the human being, 
experience as human reality becomes problematic and 
with it the whole system of the sciences. Indices for 
this post-Kantian development are the appearance of 
the "sense for history" and the establishment of the

so-called HUMAN SCIENCES ( Geisteswissenschaften) and 
the social sciences. They ali ha ve a peculiar double as-
pect: on the one hand, they provide in formation about 
the reality ofman (as one reality among others), and on 
the other hand, they treat man as a quite peculiar reality 
that functions as the locus of any possible understand-
ing ofreality. WILHELM DILTHEY's work is an important 
landmark here. The world becomes the human world, 
i.e., culture. The difficult emergence ofthe concept of 
culture in the 19th century thus becomes the decisive 
presupposition for the conception ofphilosophical an-
thropology as it is propagated in the 1920s. 
In the 19th century Rudolph Hermann Lotze ( 1817-
1881) put his entire work- in the special sciences as 
well as in philosophy and metaphysics- in the frame-
work of an anthropology. For Lotze, who explicitly 
links up with Kant, anthropology is not the name of a 
discipline ora method; rather, it indicates the guiding 
standpoint under which ali knowledge ofthe world is 
to be evaluated. Since it is the concrete human being, 
as a conscious natural and cultural being, to whom 
appearances appear, ali world-apprehension must be 
dealt with in terms of human beings' concrete ways 
of living and thinking, their views of the world. This 
is why the term "philosophical anthropology" is used 
for the most part negatively, i.e., as distinguished from 
physiological anthropology or from other, even more 
specialized forms and this is why even in the 18th cen-
tury a positive meaning of the term is hard to locate. 
The new philosophical anthropology that unfolds 
against this background in the 1920s, and tends to 
become a new sort of philosophia prima, could also 
be called "cultural anthropology," though this term is 
usually used as equivalent to ETHNOLOGY and thus more 
narrowly. Basic to the new philosophical anthropology 
is the idea that the concept of the world is mediated 
by culture, as formulated in 1884 by Wilhelm Windel-
band ( 1848-1915), who considers eul ture the "ultimate 
synthesis" of our experiential knowledge ofthe world. 
In the same vein ERNST CASSIRER declares in 1923 that 
"the critique ofreason thus becomes the critique of eul-
ture." The concept ofthe world can be transposed into 
the concept of eul ture because the world is always the 
human world. Culture and man imply each other. This 
is to say that world and humankind are inseparable 
correlates. The resulting concept of "cultural anthro-
pology" (before the term even exists) proves tobe less 
an overcoming of metaphysics- as some of its advo-
cates claim -than a new form of it. Kant's "culture of 
reason" sti li influences the new concept of eul ture, and 
for Kant, "metaphysics" was the culmination of ali the 
culture ofhuman reason. 
Thus anthropology develops, as Jiirgen Habermas 
says, in connection with a theory of nature and a the-
ory of society and history. But this occurs with a fun-
damental focus on the incomparable reality of man 
himself, since "nature" and "culture" are both the re-
ality of humankind itself and the basic dimensions of 
their experience. Thus the philosophical anthropology 
that was developed in the 1920s by phenomenologists 
and neo-Kantians oscillated between metaphysics and 
description. The first worked out and published philo-
sophical anthropology of this sort was MARTIN HEIDEG-
GER 's interpretation of human DASEIN as FUNDAMENTAL 
ONTOLOGY in Sein und Zeit ( 1927). In this sense Heideg-
ger belongs with authors like MAX SCHELER, HELMUTH 
PLESSNER, Cassirer, and ARNOLD GEHLEN. 
Heidegger is vehemently opposed to characterizing 
his work as anthropology because the term is either 
used too empirically or else is completely vague. If it 
is one of the peculiarities of human beings that they 
produce widely differing pictures of themse1ves and 
their world, then one should not limit oneself to one 
picture. This is why Plessner speaks ofthe human be-
ing as homo absconditus. Besides, Heidegger thought, 
"no age has been so ignorant about man as ours. For no 
other age has man been so questionable." But in this 
regard Heidegger could refer to Scheler's early essay 
"Zur Idee des Menschen" ( 1915) and his short book 
Die Stellung des Menschen im Kosmos (The position 
of humankind in the cosmos, 1928). Cassirer too, on 
the occasion of his 1929 encounter with Heidegger, 
declared that it is epochs of crisis that lead to the prob-
lem of philosophical anthropology: reflection on the 
world is essentially self-reflection, posing the question 
ofthe nature ofhumanity. This crisis theme is also ex-
pressed in Plessner's notion of eccentric (ex-centric) 
positionality and in his positively interpreted notion 
of destabilizing (Entsicherung). Gehlen points to the 
human being's "structure oflack" and "need for inter-
pretation." The paradoxical character ofthis anthropo-
logical point of departure is typical: because humans 
are in principle beings of crisis, ex-centric, unstable, 
unfixed, and in need of interpretation, times of acute 

524 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
crisis and disorientation can bring forth anthropolo-
gies; thus Heidegger can introduce fundamental ontol-
ogy as (philosophical) hermeneutics ofDasein because 
human existence is always already the hermeneutics of 
Dasein. 
Heidegger's 
concepts 
of disclosedness 
(Er-
schlossenheit) and resoluteness (Entschlossenheit) can 
also be compared structurally as a philosophical an-
thropological insight with Scheler 's concept of"world-
openness." The "worldhood" of Dasein in Heidegger 
can be seen as humankind 's original relatedness to eul-
ture. Like the "world-horizon," culture is the frame-
work in which ali entities appear, including that spe-
cial entity, the human being itself. Heidegger's use of 
the terms "being" and "appropriation" (Ereignis) ex-
presses the non-reducibility of the cultural anthropo-
logical model metaphysically. 
Max Scheler's anthropology can be traced back to 
his 1915 essay "Zur Idee des Menschen," where the 
connection to Husserl's concept of intentionality and 
to Westem metaphysics is made. Scheler's 1928 book, 
by contrast, emphasizes an idea that was neglected 
by Heidegger, which is the human being's place in na-
ture. Following a hierarchy, Scheler first locates human 
beings in the realm of organic nature, in order to ac-
knowledge their special position at the fifth level, that 
of world-openness (which is theoretically linked with 
Husserl's idea of reduction). The "drive to become" 
( Werdedrang) and the "becoming God" ( werdender 
Gott) are the terms that thematize the happening ofbe-
ing or appropriation (Ereignis) (as in Heidegger) and 
defy rational derivation and empirica! analysis. 
The hierarchical scheme that sometimes appears 
contrived in Scheler is more convincing in Plessner. 
Human beings are positional- i.e., they are living be-
ings distinct from the surrounding, inorganic world of 
things- but they also stand in relation to this position-
ality, and this "eccentric positionality" condemns them 
to cu !ture. This means that humans must lead their lives 
between utopian placelessness and concretely profiled 
expression. Condemned to personal self-assertion, the 
human being is forced to project roles, and to assume 
a kind of "Doppelgănger" sta tus that leads by way of 
other people to the concept of God. In the attempt to 
go deeper than the usual historical characterization of 
humankind, Plessner must presuppose a natural his-
tory that admittedly has no teleological order, so that 
the production of humanity reveals the unpredictable 
nature of its occurrences. 
Emst Cassirer interprets the human being, who may 
not be presupposed as a metaphysical substance, as 
animal symbolicum. What the tradition calls the soul-
body relation is for him the prime example of a "sym-
bolic relation." Humans construct themselves in their 
"symbolic forms" and establish a reality- eul ture-
as a symbolic universe. For Cassirer there is nothing 
before or after the symbolic formation; hence it is an 
irreducible phenomenon. 
Arnold Gehlen seeks to establish an "empirica! phi-
losophy" and seems to distance himself as far as pos-
sible from metaphysical and "purely philosophical" 
concerns. Yet he attributes to philosophical anthropol-
ogy a foundational role in philosophy. The crisis struc-
ture ofhumanity is understood biologically, in that the 
character of human needs is described concretely in 
comparison with animals. But it is to be noted that 
Gehlen repeatedly emphasizes the incomparable value 
of human biology, which leads him deep into the do-
main of research into mentalities. Interna! and exter-
na! "sensory overload" can be stabilized by "institu-
tionalization." "World-openness" and "projects of self-
understanding"- which must be understood as prac-
tica! and lived phenomena- are the essential traits of 
the human being. In Urmensch und Spătkultur Gehlen 
characterizes these basic anthropological behaviors in 
their cultural-genetic and open development. He works 
out the "categories" that ari se out ofhumanity's histori-
callife situations and that find their place in the context 
of a theory of action. One of Gehlen's metaphysical 
presuppositions is human consciousness, which can 
be descriptively analyzed and treated functionally, but 
is irreducible. In his early writings Gehlen 's point of 
departure is "phenomenological," without much refer-
ence to EDMUND HUSSERL; by this he means the descrip-
tion of situations that sticks to what can be intuitively 
experienced and is free of speculation. 
What the important 20th century philosophical an-
thropologies have in common is the tendency toward 
the so-called concretization of subjectivity, coupled 
with an extraordinarily rich elaboration of this con-
cept, extending into the realm of anonymous structures. 
Husserl's phenomenology is an extremely important 
influence on 20th century philosophical anthropology, 
even though Husserl, in a 1931 Berlin lecture, crit-

PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 
525 
icized his students for their "anthropologizing." But 
precisely the genuinely and purely phenomenological 
theories, SUCh as the theory of INTENTIONALITY, EPOCHE 
ANO REDUCTJON, and JNTERSUBJECTIVITY, ied Husserl in 
the direction of anthropology before he even knew it. 
Intentionality presupposes an empirica!, organic, hu-
man subject, a living being interacting with others. 
That is, the transcendental subject is also necessarily 
a concrete human being. The reduction that arises out 
of the epoche is an act of freedom. As constituted, the 
world is an intersubjectively accessible cultural world, 
and subjectivity as intersubjectivity exists in the pro-
cesses of constitution. In 1932 Husserl even speaks of 
transcendental phenomenology as "universal human 
science as anthropology." 
It is thus no wonder that phenomenologically ori-
ented authors such as MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, COR-
NELIUS VAN PEURSEN, ENZO PACI, KAREL KUYPERS, HEIN-
RICH ROMBACH, JEAN-DOMINIQUE ROBERT, and many oth-
ers have developed and discussed philosophical an-
thropology as phenomenological. 
The problem of this anthropology, especially when 
it claims to be first philosophy, will always be that it 
must describe its basic structures in very general and 
highly modifiable ways and must always deal with new 
situations and questions whose investigation will take 
place in fields other than philosophical anthropology. 
In addition, phenomenological anthropology is faced 
with the ambiguous difficulty that it must deal, on the 
one hand, with appearances, and, on the other, with 
appearing itself and must hope to come to terms with 
the one by appealing to the other.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
PHILOSOPHY OF COMMUNICATION 
The 
phenomenon of human communication has occupied 
a critica! if not always central position in phenomen-
ological philosophy. The description and analysis of 
the phenomenon was begun by EDMUND HUSSERL him-
self. As in many other instances, he charted much of 
the problematic -
its peculiar paths and aporias -
for those who would follow. Following him, the phe-
nomenon has been addressed in one way or another 
by a number of philosophers in the phenomenological 
tradition. In addition to Husserl 's work, that of MAU-
RICE MERLEAU-PONTY, MARTIN HEIDEGGER, and EMMANUEL 
LEVINAS will be considered here. 
For ali its originality, phenomenology bears legacies 
ofthe philosophies it engages, whether it does so wit-
tingly or not. The broad outlines ofthe phenomenologi-
cal problematic of communication are already drawn 
in the opening lines of Aristotle's Peri Hermeneias. 
He observes that ali people are gathered together in a 
shared experience of the world, that the world itself 
is held in common, as is the experience ofthat world, 
which is directly symbolized (homoios) in mental ac-
tivity. But the bits of sound and the broken scratchings 
that come directly and then indirectly to symbolize 
(symbolon) this mental activity, words spoken or writ-
ten, are different among various peoples. Ofimmediate 
concern here- and of perennial preoccupation- is 
the nature of these "symbolizations"; first, of the re-
lation of "mental act" to "physical act" in speaking, 
writing, and the like; and second ofthe correlative co-
incidence of "mental acts" presumably established by 
the relation. 
The character of the relation and so of the cor-
relative coincidence that symbolization is to achieve 
is further complicated for phenomenology proper by 
Descartes's radical sundering of res cogitans and res 
extensa -
by extension, of actio cogitans and ac-
tia extensa. The distinction between "mental act" and 
"physical act," drawn gradually in Greek, Roman, and 
medieval thought, is completed in the Meditationes de 
Prima Philosophia ( 1641 ). The implication here that 
"mental acts" and "physical acts" takes shape in fun-
damentally incommiscible substances seems to create 
irresolvable difficulties in determining the character 
of the relation of "mental act" to "physical act" and 
so also of determining the character of the correlative 
coincidence of"mental acts." 
Husserl gathers these legacies together when he 
takes up the issue of communication early in his Lo-
gische Untersuchungen (1900--190 1 ). Taking speech 
as his exemplar- for which he is much criticized by 
JACQUES DERRIDA in La voix et le phenomene ( 1 967) and 
elsewhere- he describes the communicative act from 
the standpoint of a speaker's intent to express certain 
thoughts to another. For him, this intention manifests 
itself in indication and intimation, whereby, through 
the manipulation of physical bits of sound, the speaker 
at once indicates to the listener a desire to express 
something about something and in this indication in-
timates the content of the expression itself. This in-
tent to communicate is fulfilled in the communicative 
moment proper, by the hearer's recognition that the 
speaker intends to communicate through these bits of 
sound; by the hearer's comprehension that such bits of 
sound are accompanied by certain sense-giving acts on 
the part ofthe speaker; and by the hearer's subsequent 
participation with the speaker in a peculiar sort of"cor-
relation ofthoughts" achieved by reproducing more or 
less corresponding sense-giving acts. 
The possibility of such a fulfillment here, however, 
presents a dilemma. The requisite recognition, com-
prehension, and participation that fulfills the speaker's 
intent to communicate presupposes, on the part of lis-
tener and speaker alike, a correlation of "mental acts" 
regarding the relation of"mental act" to "physical act," 
the very relation that has yet to accomplish this corre-
lation. In order to achieve what must concurrently be 
accomplished, Husserl finds it necessary to appeal to 
the intuitive fulfillment ofthe speaker's intent to com-
municate. In this, the listener's intuition somehow sur-
mounts the otherwise insurmountable rift between the 
"mental act" and "physical act" and so, in turn, between 
"mental acts" themselves. (In a 1925 lecture course, 
Prolegomena zur Geschichte des Zeitbegriffs [Prole-
gomena to the history of the concept of time, 1979], 
Heidegger suggests that the mediation that intuition 
performs here is immediate, amounting to something 
of a spontaneous recognition.) 
In the fifth of the Cartesianische Meditationen 
[ 1931 ], apparently dissatisfied with the earlier appeal 
to intuition as a viable means of crossing the Cartesian 
chasm, Husserl steels himselfto the necessity of estab-
lishing a communication prior to communication itself. 
Attempting to resolve the dilemma, he tums from the 

PHILOSOPHY OF COMMUNICATION 
527 
analysis of overtly communicative acts -
speaking, 
writing, and the like, i.e., acts in which communica-
tive intent is preeminent- to an analysis of acts that 
are covertly communicative- acts exemplified in the 
"concordant bodily behavior" encountered in the pres-
ence of another, i.e., acts that need involve no commu-
nicative intent, no express movement toward another. 
Husserl begins his analysis by reducing the other 
along with the rest of the world 's contents to their ap-
pearance in the immanent "sphere of ownness" that 
circumscribes phenomenological consciousness ("my 
own" consciousness, as Husserl has it). By means of 
this reduction, the other is divested of ali transcen-
dence save an immanent transcendence in reflection 
in which the other appears over against me, a body 
amid other bodies, a possible abject of my attention. 
Portraying what is essentialiy a prereflective process 
in a reflective manner, the analysis proceeds as fol-
lows: by way of a "mundanizing apperception," in this 
"sphere of ownness," 1 can carne to discem the re-
lation of "mental act" to "physical act" in coming to 
appreciate the relation ofmy EGO and BODY or "animate 
organism." Locating this related ego-body amid other 
worldly bodies, 1 find myself confronted with the body 
of another. And as against the behavior of other objects 
in my world, in the "concordant bodily behavior" of 
that other, 1 discover a clue that provokes me to postu-
late a relation between a "physical act" and a "mental 
act" on the part ofthis other that mirrors the relation I 
find in myself. By way of an "apperceptive transfer," 
an "analogizing apperception," I postulate a relation 
between the other's body and an alter ego that reflects 
the one I ha ve discerned in myself. Having determined 
these relations, it occurs to me to consider how my 
behavior might look if I were there, what relation of 
"mental act" to "physical act" might be obtaining were 
I that other. 
But I am not that other. I am nowhere "there," but 
"here." ţ:onsequently, such a consideration cannot, in 
principle, insure the requisite correlation of"acts," the 
correlative coincidence essential to the resolution of 
the dilemma. In order to complete this covert commu-
nication, this communication prior to communication, 
Husserl finds it necessary to appeal to a notion of em-
pathy -
the functional equivalent of the appeal to 
intuition in his analysis of overt communication. Like 
intuition, however, empathy too requires the accom-
plishment ofthat which has yet tobe achieved, that is, 
a correlative coincidence of"mental acts" with respect 
to the relation of "mental act" and "physical act." The 
dilemma remains unresolved. 
With the turn to the LIFEWORLD made explicit in !ater 
manuscripts- such as the texts that make up Die Kri-
sis der europiiischen Wissenschaften und die transzen-
dentale Phiinomenologie ( 1936)- an ali but palpable 
tension is produced as the transcendental confronts the 
existential. Amid this tension, the dilemma of the re-
lation of "mental act" and "physical act" and that of 
the correlative coincidence of "mental acts" becomes 
even more pressing. The problem, however, is simply 
pushed into the transcendental realm. There it remains, 
unresolved as the analysis ofthe Fifth Meditation, for 
ali intents and purposes, is repeated. 
In Phimomenologie de la perception (1945), MAU-
RICE MERLEAU-PONTY moves out from the tension 
present in Husserl's !ater work- a tension frustrat-
ing but fertile. He uses this tension to his own ends, 
pushing the implications of the confrontation produc-
ing it until finally the radical priority ofthe existential 
is forced into evidence. Merleau-Ponty points out that 
Descartes himself was made to concede in his letter 
to Elisabeth (June 28, 1643) that the quotidian admix-
ture of "mental act" and "physical act" stands prior 
to any reflective analysis that would divide them into 
mutualiy exclusive realms. For Merleau-Ponty, this an-
tecedent union is present in each and every mundane 
act of expression. 
As Husserl understood it in Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 ( 1913 ), expression is first and foremost concep-
tual expression. As such, expression neither requires 
nor demands corporeality. In this immaterial state ex-
pression is essentially non-productive. Despite enig-
matic hints to the contrary, it is limited here to "mirror-
ing" or "depicting" the MEANING or signification (Be-
deutung) of sense (Sinn) already accomplished in a pre-
expressive fundament. Expression is said to exhaust it-
self in the expressing as such. But in Merleau-Ponty's 
hands conceptuality presses itself into corporeality and 
only there does it find itself as such. Corporeality at 
once completes and accomplishes conceptuality. The 
reflective iliusion that distorts and disfigures this re-
lation is shattered. In deed and in word, "mental act" 
participates with "physical act" whether doing or say-

528 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ing is called for, called forth, or recalled. 
Expression, the upsurge of this participation, ex-
presses itself as a bodily dialectic of movement and 
spatiotemporality. This dialectic is not that of a merely 
"mobile" body at once oblivious to coordinates deter-
mining its position in the abstract axes of space and 
time, indifferent to its own motion or magnitude. It is 
that of a motile body oriented with respect to a space 
and a time borne by both matter and matters, by ob-
jects and by others: the space and time of doing and 
of saying. In the movement of doing and saying, the 
dialectic proceeds from the done and the said -
the 
material residue of do ing and saying ( or, by implica-
tion, of not doing and not saying) -
toward what is 
to be done and said, toward what, in the end, will be 
done and said. Thus doing and saying determine the 
significance ofwhat is and ofwhat can be (both in the 
sense of what is able to be and of what is permitted 
to be ), a significance gathered in and gathered from 
doing and saying itself. This ongoing determination of 
significance is the intelligibility- the manifest sense 
(sens)- of do ing and saying. Such intelligibility is the 
communicativeness of expression: the covert commu-
nicativeness of doing, the overt communicativeness of 
saying. 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER had already explored the charac-
ter of this intelligibility- the logos or Rede of do ing 
and saying- in Sein und Zeit ( 1927), though in a man-
ner that made its embodied "nature" less evident than it 
would become with Merleau-Ponty. He too takes lea ve 
of Descartes, ofboth his premises and his project. This 
does not, however, am o unt- at least in Sein und Zeit 
-
to a turn away from Husserl 's work. Rather, with 
respect to the intelligibility of doing and saying, Hei-
degger clearly exploits many ofHusserl's fundamental 
investigations. In this, much ofhis originality !ies in the 
audacity and the creativity with which he "existential-
izes" structures already delineated by Husserl (where 
such "existentializing" amounts, at least in part, to a 
profound and protracted eradication of the Cartesian 
element in what he takes over from Husserl). 
Husserl 's formulation of the genetic and constitu-
tive structure of the intelligibility of do ing and saying 
-
its intricate intentionality- must be gathered in de-
tai! from a number ofworks, but can broadly be said to 
consist of a tripartite complex of signification, expres-
sion, and indication. Signification is the signification 
of sense, the attribution of MEANING to the perceptual 
complex of sense data and its fulfillment- to the ex-
tent that such fulfillment occurs. In its simplest form, 
it consists of an intentiona! act directed in a particular 
manner toward an intentiona! object, the latter subsist-
ing, in part, in a synthesis of matter and form. Ex-
pression, as mentioned, is conceptual expression, the 
coming to consciousness of signification, presumably 
arising from and moved by the energies of attention. 
Indication is the non-essential corporeal accoutrement 
to this expression, somehow indicating the occurrence 
of the expression, and, by means of this indication, 
somehow intimating its content. 
At once with and against Husserl, Heidegger in 
his 1925 lecture course Prolegomena zur Geschichte 
des Zeitbegriffs is adamant that ali signification is ex-
pressed signification, and that ali expressed significa-
tion is disclosive (whether or not such disclosiveness 
is indicati ve and as such intimative or something more 
profound from whence the indication itself derives). 
In Sein und Zeit, Heidegger reformulates this assertion 
in terms of his own "existential" reworking of these 
Husserlian structures. Husserl 's perceptual complex of 
sense data becomes a totality of significance that stands 
as the horizon of an "involved perception," the ongo-
ing circumspection ofmundane preoccupations (where 
totality of significance names a complex intermeshing 
of what can be and what may be amid what is). Cir-
cumscribed by an emergent and emerging familiarity, 
this totality of significance is determined by compre-
hension ( Verstehen)- whatever its present degree-
and "colored" by disposition (Stimmung)- whatever 
its current valuative dimensions. 
The particularity of this totality is, for Heidegger, 
always in the midst of being rearticulated in the ar-
ticulation, the synthesis and diaresis, of significance 
that comprises doing and saying. Guided by whatever 
project is at hand, comprehension and disposition are 
specified in this articulation as the matter and manner 
ofthat doing and saying (a reformulation of Husserl's 
signification of sense). Termed interpretation by Hei-
degger, this specification (a reformulation of Husserl 's 
expression of signification) amounts to taking hold of 
something as something for the sake of something, an 
appropriation ofwhat is in terms of its significance, in 
terms ofwhat can be and what may be. 
The structure of this "something taken hold of' is 

PHILOSOPHY OF COMMUNICATION 
529 
clarified in, among other places, "Die Frage nach der 
Technik" (1954). Drawing there upon the "doctrine of 
the four causes" in Aristotle's Metaphysics, Heidegger 
delineates this "something taken hold of' in terms of 
what is gathered together in it, as the complex "debt" 
it owes for what it is. It is indebted to the material from 
which it stems, that is, what that material is, how it 
stands at present and has arrived at that standing. It 
is indebted to the possibilities this material contains, 
what it can be and may be with respect to what it now 
is. It is indebted to the doer or the sayer as the one who 
gathers material and possibility together according to 
comprehension and disposition. And it is indebted to 
the project of the doing or the saying, to the tel os that 
guides and sets bounds to the gathering itself. 
In the gathering- the articulation of significance, 
to return to Sein und Zeit -
that comprises doing 
("being-in," as Heidegger would have it), what is ap-
propriated is what can be and what may be, insofar 
as it actually (and presently) can be and may be. Put 
in different terms: in doing, the potentiality of what 
is, insofar as it is a potentiality of what is, is appro-
priated and, in this appropriation, actualized- using 
here the medieval rendering of the doctrines set forth 
in the ninth book of Aristotle's Metaphysics. In saying 
(for Heidegger, "being-with"), what is appropriated is 
what can be and what may be as such, as an asserted 
possibility of what is (this wou1d explain his other-
wise enigmatic statement in "Brief uber den Human-
ismus" [ 194 7] that "language is the house of Being"). 
Again, to put this in different terms: in saying, poten-
tia1ity is brought into actuality as potentiality per se, as 
possibility (BRENTANo's study, Van der mannigfachen 
Bedeutung des Seienden nach Aristoteles [Ofthe man-
ifold meaning of being in Aristotle, 1862], is helpful 
in coming to terms with the necessity of actualizing 
the potential as such). It is evident here that doing and 
saying require one another, that they are necessarily 
coextensive: doing is the do ing of saying (the actual-
ization ofthe potentialization ofwhat is) and saying is 
the saying of doing (the potentiality ofthe actuality of 
what is). 
The movement of appropriation in doing and say-
ing is a movement of EXPECTATION: a question in the 
guise of an assertion, a question awaiting response 
(this movement is explored with great facility by HANS-
GEORG GADAMER in Wahrheit und Methode [Truth and 
method, 1960]). This expectation is "worked out" in 
the encounter with what is, with objects in do ing and 
with others in saying; it is met in that encounter, and, 
in this meeting, to one degree or another, it is satis-
fied and it is disappointed. It is by means of the latter 
-
in grasping the response that disappoints -
that 
comprehension and disposition are cultivated. 
The perpetually shifting synthesis and diaresis of 
significance resulting from this cultivation marks the 
movement of appropriation and is the intelligibility of 
that movement (and so ofboth the do ing and the saying 
that this movement consists in). This intelligibility !ies 
nowhere behind or beneath the movement, but is the 
movement itself. Taking hold of their respective ob-
jects, doing and saying disp1ay this intelligibility in the 
ongoing articu1ation ofsignificance (this would bea re-
formu1ation of Husserl 's notion of indication). In this 
continuing determination of (potential) significance, 
the specification of comprehension and disposition in 
doing and saying is disclosed, as is the (actual) sig-
nificance of objects and of words in the satisfaction 
and disappointment of that determinati an (a reformu-
lation of Husserl 's notion of intimation). This display 
and disclosure is both the covert communicativeness 
of doing (and of saying insofar as saying is a doing) 
and the overt communicativeness of saying (and of 
doing insofar as doing is a saying, that is, is directed 
toward another with the intent to communicate ). Here, 
in the recuperation of Husserl 's work, the dilemma of 
the relation of "mental act" and "physical act" is re-
so1ved as is the dilemma ofthe correlative coincidence 
of "mental acts." 
But expression, the communicativeness of doing 
and of saying, is not yet communication ( GEORGES GUS-
DORF has made much ofthis distinction in his too often 
overlooked La parole [Speech, 1953 ]). As a byproduct 
of expression in Sein und Zeit, Heidegger can con-
ceive of commmunication only in a patronizing sort 
of relation: as a "leaping in for" and dominating the 
other, in its "negative" instance; or, in its "positive" in-
stance, as a "leaping ahead of' and liberating the other. 
Here Heidegger remains within the bounds established 
in Husserl 's concern to resolve the dilemma of the 
corre1ative coincidence of "mental acts" by means of 
the communicativeness of do ing and saying. But what 
was a means to an end for Husserl, and a problematic 
to which he returns time and again, comes to an end 

530 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
for Heidegger, who appears never to ha ve reconsidered 
this initial formulation. 
In Autrement qu 'etre ou au-dela de l 'essence (Oth-
erwise than being or beyond essence, 197 4 ), EMMANUEL 
LEVINAS rejects the reduction of communication as such 
to the communicativeness of doing and saying. This 
critique, perhaps already begun in the closing remarks 
of Theorie de l 'intuition dans la phenomenologie de 
Husserl (1930) and developed at length in Totalite et 
infini (1961), reaches its pinnacle here. For Levinas, 
the communicative relationship is not in its essence 
one of appropriation: it is neither the singular appro-
priation ofthe other in body or thought (a tyranny that 
he discusses at length in "Liberte et commandement" 
[1953] and that Heidegger also considers when for-
mulating the fundamental distinction between "being-
in" and "being-with" in Sein und Zeit), nor is it a co-
appropriation mediated by some "third term," a term 
that provides the common element for communion (for 
Husserl, a co-appropriation mediated by the indications 
of speaking or by "inferences" from concordant bodily 
behavior; for Heidegger in Sein und Zeit, mediated in-
authentically by the vague "certainties" shared in "idle 
chatter" or authentically by the "truth" disclosed in 
"resolute saying"). This co-appropriation, made pos-
sible by the communicativeness of doing and saying 
and by the response that this communicativeness elic-
its (itself a doing or a saying), cannot, of course, be 
discarded in considerations of communication as such. 
It is rather that this reciproca! expressiveness, however 
important, obscures a more fundamental relationship. 
Prior to this reciproca! expressiveness- a relation 
that for the most part, seeks the assurances of a certain 
sameness (a coincidence of thought, of ego with alter 
ego, of self with other as another self) and the relative 
security this sameness provides -
!ies the "face-ta-
face" encounter, the fundamental communicative re-
lationship, a relationship of risk, a reciprocity of al-
terities. Levinas describes this "face-to-face" relation-
ship as one of"proximity." The notion of"proximity" 
describes, perhaps paradoxically, the distance without 
distance that comprises this relationship. On the one 
hand, it is at once the irreducible distance opened up 
by the absolute alterity of the other; here, the insight 
of Descartes is recovered, yet the inviolability of this 
otherness is no longer an ontologica! inviolability, but 
one that pertains to ETHICS. And on the other hand, it 
is a reciproca! caii for openness and a demand for re-
spect that sounds across this uncrossable distance, a 
reciprocity of responsiveness to and of responsibility 
for the other that stands prior to and eludes, in this 
otherness, ali appropriation. It is a giving of oneself to 
the other, a receiving of oneself from the other. 
Whatever else communication is, it is a dialogue 
-
a dialogue of self with other, of self with self as 
other; and it is a perpetua! beginning -
a beginning 
without origin or end. Whatever else phenomenology 
may teach us about communication, it will bring us 
implicitly or explicitly to symbolon, the term that fig-
ures so prominently in the opening lines of Aristotle's 
Peri Hermeneias, a term whose radical sense is "being 
thrown together."

PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY 
531 
PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY 
More than 
sixty years ago EDMUND HUSSERL spoke publicly for the 
first time in a systematic fashion about phenomeno1ogi-
cal PSYCHOLOGY, which he had discovered around 1900 
in his search for a new foundation for phi1osophy. In 
a lecture course of 1925 entitled Phiinomenologische 
Psychologie he envisioned this new psycho1ogy as a 
discipline destined to p1ay an important role in the a1-
ready established empirica! psychology as well as in 
philosophy. Husserl characterized PHENOMENOLOGICAL 
PSYCHOLOGY as an a priori, eidetic, intuitive, purely 
descriptive, and intentiona! science of psychic phe-
nomena, in which science remains entirely within the 
natural, mundane, or worldly attitude. 
From this characterization it is clear that phenomen-
ological psychology, as the a priori and eidetic study 
of psychic phenomena, is to be distinguished from 
traditional empirica! psychology insofar as pheno-
menological psychology is concerned only with the 
"essences" or ei de of the psychic phenomena and not 
with the psychic facts purely as such. Thus it re-
lies on the EIDETIC METHOD. Furthermore, contrary to 
empirica! psychology, phenomenological psychology 
tries to explain these "essences" as unities ofmeaning 
within the realm uncovered by a typical psychological-
phenomenologica1 EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION. Phenomen-
ologica( psychology is distinguished from transcen-
dental phenomenology because only in philosophy is a 
transcendental reduction performed and is ali meaning 
explained as constituted by transcendental subjectivity. 
Under the influence of Husserl 's ideas about pheno-
menological psychology, an extensive phenomenologi-
cal psychological movement has developed in many 
countries, especially GERMANY, THE NETHERLANDS, the 
UNITED STATES, and SOUTH AFRICA. There are, however, 
very few psychologists who have used Husserl's in-
sights and ideas without major modifications in con-
tent, method, or both. The major difficulties experi-
enced by psychologists who have studied Husserl's 
ideas in this regard are not rooted in his view of empir-
ica! and phenomenological psychology as such, but 
are traceable to his transcendental phenomenology. 
Most phenomenological psychologists cannot under-
stand, or cannot accept, Husserl 's position on tran-
scendental reduction and on transcendental subjectiv-
ity. This was the reason why many phenomenological 
psychologists turned to the existential interpretation of 
Husserl 's phenomenology that was initiated by MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER 's Sein und Zeit ( 1927). To understand the 
basic move made from the Husserlian philosophy of 
phenomenological psychology to the existential one it 
is necessary to say a few words about the manner in 
which Husserl justified his conception and why this 
justification was found to be unacceptable to EXISTEN-
TIAL PHENOMENOLOGY. 
In his discussion of the reduction, taken as the 
"bracketing of ali being," Husserl stated that an at-
tempt to practice the transcendental reduction and the 
systematic self-examination that is made possible by it, 
as well as the actual uncovering ofthe ego 's whole con-
scious life, reveal that all that is and exists for the pure 
EGO, including consciousness itself, is constituted in 
and by it, and that every kind ofbeing has its own way 
of constitution. After such a reduction it thus becomes 
clear that every imaginable entity, whether immanent 
or transcendent, falls within the domain of transcen-
dental subjectivity, which constitutes ali meaning and 
being. 
In Husserl 's view it is nonsense to conceive of the 
uni verse of apodictically true being as something that 
!ies outside the uni verse of consciousness and is related 
to it merely externally. Both belong together essentially 
and, as such, they are concretely one, in the absolute 
concretion of transcendental subjectivity. If transcen-
dental subjectivity is the uni verse of al! possible MEAN-
ING (Sinn), then an outside of consciousness must be 
nonsense ( Unsinn ). Thus if carried out with system-
atic concreteness, phenomenology is necessarily tran-
scendental idealism. Yet this is neither a psychological 
idealism that would derive a meaningful world from 
meaningless, sensuous data (Berkeley), nor a Kantian 
idealism that somehow believes in the possibility ofthe 
world ofthings-in-themselves in addition to the world 
of phenomena. Rather, it is a transcendental idealism 
as a consistently executed self-explication in the form 
of a systematic egological science. This is not a form 
ofsolipsism because, in the final analysis, it is possible 
in such a phenomenology to explain how the problems 
of intersubjectivity and the entire intersubjective world 
can be solved in a truly radical manner. 
Heidegger was convinced that Husserl 's phenomen-
ology does not respect the limits imposed both on hu-
man reason and on the meaning of Being. In his view, 
both are inherently temporal, historical, and finite. No

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
forms ofhuman understanding are ever more thanjus-
tifiable interpretations. There is no absolute knowledge 
and no presuppositionless philosophy. Furthermore, in 
Heidegger's view, it makes no sense to reduce a hu-
man being to a transcendentally pure consciousness 
and Being to being-object. No one experiences him- or 
herself as a pure consciousness; rather, we experience 
ourselves as beings that stand open to the world, and 
thus are beings-in-the-world, who ek-sist. As a being-
in-the-world, whose essence is ek-sistence, transcen-
dence, and freedom, each human being experiences 
Being always in the concrete form of a WORLD. This 
world to some degree reveals Being; yet in other re-
spects it also necessarily conceals it. 
It is evident that anyone who wants to develop a 
phenomenological psychology ofthe kind Husserl had 
in mind, yet at the same time wants to follow Hei-
degger in his reinterpretation of Husserl's idealistic 
phenomenology, and thus can admit only a hermeneu-
tica! phenomenology, or anyone who at least somehow 
follows Heidegger in his criticism of Husserl's tran-
scendental phenomenology, must try to find another 
way to explain the radical distinction between philos-
ophy and phenomenological psychology. As we have 
seen, Husserl explained this difference by making a dis-
tinction between the psychological-phenomenological 
reduction employed in phenomenological psychology 
and the transcendental reduction employed in transcen-
dental phenomenology. Now for Heidegger, a transcen-
dental reduction is impossible and is to be eliminated. 
In other words, an ontology concerned with the mean-
ing ofBeing has to take the place ofHusserl's system-
atic egology. 
In working out the details ofthe move from a tran-
scendental to a HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY, not 
ali authors who have been interested in the status 
of phenomenological psychology have followed the 
same route. Some (Heidegger, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, MAU-
RICE MERLEAU-PONTY, etc.) take their point of departure 
in Husserl 's lecture course on phenomenological psy-
chology, whereas others (sTEPHAN STRASSER, etc.) prefer 
to begin in Husserl 's la test works, notably Die Krisis 
der europă ischen Wissenschafien und die transzenden-
tale Phanomenologie ( 1936). 
To understand the second position, it is necessary 
to say a few words about Husserl 's view of the re-
lationship between phenomenological psychology and 
transcendental phenomenology as he gradually carne 
to conceive of this during the last decade of his life. 
Husserl seems to have realized that a systematically ex-
ecuted phenomenological reduction as used in pheno-
menological psychology must necessarily evolve into 
the transcendental reduction. But this would mean 
that phenomenological psychology ultimately would 
be taken up into transcendental phenomenology. This 
conception was strongly promoted by EUGEN FINK, who 
at that time was o ne of Husserl 's assistants. Strasser 
follows this interpretation and thus accepts the view 
that what is called phenomenological psychology is 
not a special discipline distinguished from both em-
pirica! psychology and phenomenological philosophy; 
rather, the term refers to a certain conception of em-
pirica) psychology that can be justified philosophi-
cally by phenomenological philosophy. In other words, 
for Strasser, the term "phenomenological psychology" 
refers to a determinate current or school within the 
realm of empirica! psychology as a whole. This school 
leans on phenomenological philosophy as far as its 
philosophical foundations are concerned. It thus is to 
be distinguished from the kind ofpsychology promoted 
by Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), Carl Stumpf (1848-
1936), John Watson (1878-1958), Max Wertheimer 
(1880-1943), etc., who assumed quite different kinds 
of philosophies. 
Sartre, on the other hand, explicitly maintains that 
phenomenological psychology is to be conceived as 
a special discipline and not as a particular trend in 
contemporary psychology. He explains the difference 
between empirica! psychology and phenomenological 
psychology by stating that the meaning of phenomen-
ological psychology is to furnish empirica! psychol-
ogy with the necessary foundations for its empirica! 
investigations by explaining the human meaning ofthe 
phenomena with which empirica! psychology deals in 
its observations, experiments, tests, explanations, cor-
relations, etc. In reference to the relationship between 
phenomenological psychology and philosophy, Sartre 
was convinced that phenomenological psychology is 
regressive in that phenomenological psychology nec-
essarily has to take into consideration the facticity of 
humankind's ek-sistence, which necessitates a regular 
recourse to the domain of the empirica!. Philosophy, 
on the other hand, is progressive in that the study of 
the very essence of the human cannot be verified by a 

PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY 
533 
recourse to empirica! facts. 
From Heidegger's point of view, one can add to 
this that any philosophical study of humans is ulti-
mately oriented toward the question ofthe meaning of 
Being, whereas phenomenological psychology is ori-
ented toward an understanding of the concrete human 
phenomena themselves. Yet distinguishing the two sci-
ences does not at ali entail that they are also to be 
separated. On the contrary, ali phenomenological psy-
chology is and must be necessarily oriented toward 
a philosophical investigation of humankind in which 
it finds its foundation. It is understandable that those 
who follow Heideggerpreferto call phenomenological 
psychology, thus interpreted, "existential psychology," 
because the philosophical study of the human being, 
in which phenomenological psychology finds its ulti-
mate foundation, is an analytic of DASEIN's ek-sistence 
in Heidegger's sense. 
Psychologists who accept the need for a pheno-
menological psychology- regardless ofwhether they 
identify this science with a certain philosophical con-
ception of humankind (Strasser) or whether they con-
ceive of it as a "scientia media" between the philo-
sophical and empirica! studies of human beings -
defend the view that empirica! psychology tries to ex-
plain, at least in principle, exactly demarcated aspects 
of the lives of human beings, taken individually or 
socially, by reducing them to objective structures and 
rules that are universally valid and intersubjectively 
acceptable as such. This necessarily implies formal-
ization, functionalization, and some form of quantifi-
cation. As forms ofreduction, these procedures lead to 
reductive models, which objectively describe certain 
aspects ofthe life and behavior ofhuman beings. 
lf o ne accepts this point ofview, then as a necessary 
consequence one must also defend the thesis that an 
empirica! science of human beings as such, of human 
beings as persons, is impossible. Empirica! psychol-
ogy, because ofthe reductions necessarily imposed by 
the empirica! methods tobe used, has to restrict itselfto 
quantifiable aspects of humankind's existential orien-
tation toward the world; the term "quantifiable" is here 
to be taken in a very broad sense in view of the fact 
that one will usually employ only statistica! methods. 
It has been observed by severa! authors that an em-
pirica! psychology that would make use of the objec-
tifying procedures and methods mentioned would by 
necessity be reduced to physiology and biology. Ev-
ery phenomenologist who defends the point of view 
briefty outlined above is aware that an objectifying 
thematization, which necessarily includes formaliza-
tion, functionalization, and quantification, will lead to 
reductive models that are relatively poor in comparison 
with the concrete ek-sistential orientations toward the 
world and the immediately lived experiences as such. 
But here one must realize first that no possible kind of 
theoretical knowledge is able to describe and to explain 
the concrete as concrete. Furth«rmore, in presenting 
ek-sistential orientations of humans toward the world 
with the help ofreductive models, we must indeed set 
asi de certa in aspects of a human being's life that, seen 
concretely, may be ofthe greatest importance. 
Yet one must also realize that in this way one gains 
the possibility of defining certain aspects of human 
"behavior" unambiguously and of describing it in con-
nection with other quantified phenomena. Finally, it 
is certainly not true that an empirica! investigation 
must completely set aside human phenomena such as 
meaning, INTENTIONALITY, purpose, teleology, gestures, 
and linguistic behavior as expressions ofEMOTIONs and 
meaning, as can be shown easily with the help of con-
temporary literature in which it is apparent that under 
certain conditions these aspects of our orientation to-
ward the world can be quantified in an indirect manner. 
Psychology as an empirica! HUMAN SCIENCE relying to 
some extent on quantitative methods is feasible. 
Under the inftuence of certain publications by Hei-
degger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty, many phenomen-
ological psychologists have come to the conclusion 
that the methods ofphenomenological psychology can-
not be the methods recommended by Husserl. One is 
convinced that in view of the fact that the knowledge 
achieved by the application of descriptive methods is 
and remains some form of interpretation, the methods 
to be used are those described by the French authors 
mentioned as ek-sistential analyses or by Heidegger 
as hermeneutica! interpretations, precisely because of 
the inh~rently temporal and historical nature ofhuman 
behavior. 
It is important to note that the necessity of a pheno-
menological psychology as a new science between em-
pirica! psychology and the philosophical study of the 
mode ofbeing ofhuman beings was not defended here 
on the ground that there is a gap to be filled between 

534 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
empirica! psychology and the psychotherapeutic prac-
tice in which the results of empirica! investigations are 
applied to practica! situations and problems of concrete 
human beings. It may very well be the case that such 
a gap indeed exists; yet it is not the task ofphenomen-
ological psychology to fill it. It seems that this would 
be the task of an art and not one of a scientific theoret-
ical discipline that is to provide empirica! psychology 
with basic concepts, principles, and specifications for 
the use of methods. 
Yet underlying the issues touched upon here there is 
another very important one. The empirica! psycholo-
gists who effectively make use ofthe insights brought 
to light by phenomenological psychology interpret the 
psychic phenomena and the various forms ofbehavior 
from the perspective ofthe theoretical framework made 
available by phenomenological psychology. When the 
results of empirica! research are brought to bear by psy-
chotherapists on the difficulties and problems clients 
bring up in psychotherapeutic sessions, the clients 
themselves interpret the phenomena and forms of be-
havior they present to the psychotherapists within a 
framework of meaning that in most cases is different 
from that of the therapists. It stands to reason that the 
therapists will be able to help these clients to the de-
gree that they are a bie to "penetra te" the framework of 
meaning from which the clients understand their own 
situations. For only ifthe therapists can do so will they 
be able fully to understand their clients' positions and 
needs, and help them effectively. 
Now where one projects phenomena upon a frame-
work of meaning or world in empirica! psychology, we 
also encounter here the need for the opposite procedure, 
namely to enquire back from the known phenomena to 
the world from which they ideally can be understood. 
The work of the psychotherapist is here similar to the 
work ofthe person who interprets the meaning of a text 
by projecting it upon a horizon or world from which 
it can be understood. It is in this kind of research that 
the methods of HERMENEUTICS, first developed in clas-
sical philology, are to be employed. In other words, in 
addition to empirica! and descriptive psychology there 
is still a need for an interpreti ve psychology. To avoid 
needless confusion, it is perhaps recommendable not to 
speak about three different sciences, but instead to say 
that psychology contains empirica!, descriptive, and 
interpreti ve components.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
535 
PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
One of the key 
themes of the phenomenological movement is the no-
tion ofthe lived BODY. Yet the phenomenological recog-
nition of the body-subject, and the disclosure of the 
centrality of lived bodily experience, is itself an ongo-
ing historical process taking place within a larger cul-
tural context marked not only by new ways of paying 
attention to bodily life, but also by new bodily prac-
tices and new ways of theorizing about practices. For 
example, by the time ofthe inception ofthe phenomen-
ological movement, both DANCE and physical education 
were already feeling the influence of a non-dualistic ap-
proach to movement, gesture, and expression inspired 
in part by the work ofFran<;ois Delsarte ( 1811-1871) in 
Paris; one effect ofthe new approach was the very shift 
in terminology in North America from physical "train-
ing" to physical "education." Military-style drill meant 
to discipline the physical body gradually gave way to 
addressing the whole experiencing person through cre-
ative play and rhythmic movement. Meanwhile, the 
first three decades ofthe 20th century in Europe saw a 
move away from traditional gymnastic exercises and an 
emergence ofvarious forms of"harmonic" and "rhyth-
mic" gymnastics (some ofwhich influenced European 
pioneers in soMATICS, who in turn gave courses on their 
own new work in body and movement awareness for 
physical education -
or "physical re-education" -
teachers). Eventually, an appreciation for the situated, 
personal subject moving in lived TIME and SPACE -
as presented, for example, in the phenomenologically 
shaped PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY of FREDERIK J. J. 
BUYTENDIJK -
was incorporated into some European 
physical education theory. (This is reflected not only 
in citations in the literature, but also, for instance, in 
the fact that some physical education teachers trained 
in THE NETHERLANDS have been required to take course-
work in phenomenological PSYCHOLOGY.) 
But while an implicitly phenomenologica\ orienta-
tion seems to lie at the core of physical education, the 
actualized version is both underexplored and underde-
veloped. Over the past two decades, explicitly pheno-
menological work has been gaining ground in North 
American physical education; however, the gains have 
largely been theorists doing research on phenomen-
ology rather than practitioners do ing phenomenology. 
There has also been research done using phenomen-
ological methods developed for the HUMAN SCIENCES, 
but do ing phenomenology in an applied way is not yet 
prevalent. The phenomenological character ofphysical 
education seems to manifest itself in three loose cat-
egories: work that acknowledges phenomenology as 
relevant and useful; work that involves using pheno-
menological methods; and work that is based in doing 
phenomenology in an applied and/or heuristic fashion. 
Theorists in the philosophy of physical education 
and sport have been making the case for the rele-
vance of phenomenology as a theoretical framework 
for philosophical inquiry and analysis in physical edu-
cation. R. Scott Kretchmar's 1974 dissertation offering 
"A Phenomenological Analysis of the Other in Sport" 
is a case in point. We might a\so point to the fact 
that CALVIN O. SCHRAG's "The Lived Body as Pheno-
menological Datum" ( 1962) is included in William J. 
Morgan and Klaus V. Meier's anthology concerning 
Philosophic Inquily in Sport ( 1988), as are excerpts 
from JEAN-PAUL SARTRE and GABRIEL MARCEL and es-
says by ALPHONSO LINGIS and IRIS MARION YOUNG. The 
volume also contains an excerpt from EUGEN FINK's 
Oase des Glucks. Gedanken zu einer Ontologie des 
Spiels (Oasis of happiness: Thoughts concerning an 
ontology of play, 1957) in a translation that also ap-
peared in the journal Philosophy Today in 1960 (and 
again in 1974), while Meier's own essay on "Embod-
iment, Sport, and Meaning" contrasts Cartesian dual-
ism with MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY's investigations of 
"incarnate consciousness" and unequivocally recom-
mends a phenomenologica\ approach to philosophy of 
sport. The Schrag, Fink, and Meier pieces mentioned 
are also included in Ellen W. Gerber's edited collection 
devoted to Sport and the Body ( 1972; 2nd ed. 1979), 
as is SEYMOUR KLEINMAN's 1964 essay on "The Sig-
nificance of Human Movement: A Phenomenological 
Approach." Kleinman has also published or presented 
many other papers dedicated to justifying the kindred 
association between phenomenology and physical ed-
ucation. For instance, "Phenomenology- The Body 
-
Physical Education" ( 1964) deals with the relcvance 
ofMerleau-Ponty's notion ofbody-subject to physical 
education, while "Physical Education and Lived Move-
ment" ( 1971) takes ERWIN w. STRAUS 's "Le mouvement 
vecu" ( 1935-36) as its point of departure. Kleinman 
has since shifted from a more theoretical perspective 
aimed toward introducing phenomenological concepts 
to physical educators to the actual "do ing" of pheno-

536 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
menological work within a somatics context, a turn 
reflected in the degree program he heads at The Ohio 
State University and in the yearly conferences he or-
ganizes as we11 as in some of his more recent essays. 
For example, in "Intelligent Kinesthetic Expression" 
( 1990), he recommends a "kinaesthetic" and "somatie" 
phenomenology of artistic and athletic movement, and 
in "Researching Lived Experience in Movement and 
Dan ce" ( 1991-92 ), he warns against di vorcing "pheno-
menology" as the production of texts (an aspect em-
phasized in MAX VAN MANEN's 1990 work on phenomen-
ological methodology, Researching Lived Experience) 
from direct somatie encounter and from the living prac-
tice of moving. 
By far the bulk ofphenomenological work in phys-
ical education is in the area of using phenomenology 
and phenomenological methods in the conduct of in-
quiry- in the design, implementation, analysis, and 
reporting of research. Expository work on the "how 
to" aspects ofphenomenology is evident, for instance, 
in the 1969 master's thesis by Peter Spencer-Kraus on 
"The Application of 'Linguistic Phenomeno1ogy' to 
the Philosophy of Physical Education and Sport"; in 
Sharon K. Sto11's 1982 essay on "The Use of Pheno-
menology to Investigate and Describe Sport in the 
Historical Genre"; and in Kathleen Pearson's presen-
tation of "Methods of Philosophic Inquiry in Physical 
Activity" (1990). Phenomeno1ogical work that is ac-
tua11y descriptive and experientia11y oriented is also 
becoming more prevalent, particularly in master's the-
ses and doctoral dissertations. Notable examples in-
clude Nancy Wessinger's master's and doctoral work 
on the child's experience of games in physical edu-
cation; Brian Pronger's work on gay men and ath-
letics; Rick Osbourne's thesis on "Competition and 
the Ultimate Athletic Experience: A Phenomenologi-
cal Approach" ( 1979); Janice L. Progen's disserta-
tion comprising "An Exploration of the Flow Expe-
rience among Selected Co11ege Athletes" ( 1981 ); and 
Katherine A. Welter's thesis concerning "Complete 
Moments in Sport: A Phenomenological Approach" 
( 1978). Stephen Smith 's doctoral work on seeing a risk, 
and MAUREEN CONNOLLY's doctoral work on difficulty, 
have since inspired more applied phenomenological 
work in the area ofteacher preparation in physical ed-
ucation. 
There 
is 
also 
a 
relatively 
strong, 
albeit 
sma11, descriptive-narrative phenomenological tradi-
tion within physical education, especia11y in Canada. 
Ph(momenology and Pedagogy and Lifeworld Editions, 
two publication series sponsored by the University of 
Alberta (Edmonton, Alberta), were powerful vehicles 
for this descriptive-narrative phenomenological work, 
and some ofthe more compe11ing descriptions are from 
physical education: HEATHER DEVINE's "The Pheno-
menology of Training" ( 1984 ), COLIN LORBACK 's "Wa-
ter Experience" (1981 ), and DAVID P. JOHNs's "Pheno-
menology and the Gymnastic Movement" ( 1981, rpt. 
1985). Related essays have appeared in the United 
States in, for instance, Dorothy J. A11en and Brian 
Fahey's edited co11ection on Being Human in Sport 
( 1977), e.g., Kenneth Ravizza's "Potential ofthe Sport 
Experience" and Ginny Studer's "Moment-to-moment 
Experiences of Self." More widely published work 
in the descriptive-narrative tradition that resonates 
strongly with physical education includes the work of 
JAN HENDRIK VAN DEN BERG and MARTINUS LANGEVELD 
(both members of the so-ca11ed Utrecht school). JAN 
BROEKHOFF, a Netherlands scholar based at the Univer-
sity of Oregon, is another who advocates a narrative 
approach that is deeply invested in the body; he sup-
ports the necessity of body-based phenomenological 
work in physical education. 
Fina11y, there is an emerging trend toward do-
ing phenomenology in physical education in an ap-
plied/heuristic fashion. For example, the field of adap-
tive physical education (physical education for special 
populations) provides many opportunities for this kind 
of work. Zeroing in on eidetic features of a particu-
lar type of movement experience can make it clearer 
how to modify an activity so that persons with vari-
ous capacities can a11 participate, as can asking special 
needs "insiders" directly about their own experience 
and making recommendations based on their frame of 
reference (rather than tacitly assuming that of able-
bodied experience). Moreover, working with insiders' 
descriptions and stories -
and developing a richly 
detailed yet non-dual language for articulating bodily 
experiences- wi11 not only reveal the body as a basis 
of meaning for self and self with others, but can also 
foster empathy, contact, and understanding the Other 
-even the differently-abled Other-"from the inside 
out." Conno11y's work in phenomenology and special 
populations is supported by the seminal work ofs. KAY 

POLAND 
TOOMBS (The Meaning of lllness: A Phenomenological 
Account of the Different Perspectives of Physician and 
Patient, 1992) and her remarkable account ofthe lived 
experience of multiple sclerosis, which amply demon-
strates how descriptive phenomenological work can 
bring clarity and empathy to the preparation of prac-
titioners, be they teachers or physicians. Thus here-
as in NURSING- the phenomenological movement has 
begun to make a contribution to practice in the field, as 
well as to theory building and research within the field 
and philosophical reftection about the field. 
Physical education has been practicing phenomen-
ology "in the wild." The narrative tradition in phys-
ical education is neither strong nor encouraged; de-
spite this, it has retained its voice and sustained itself. 
Ironically, many in physical education use pseudo-
phenomenological concepts in a largely unreftective, 
unacknowledged manner in their teaching and leam-
ing. The connections must be made explicit so that 
the full force of ali that phenomenology has to offer 
can be experienced as fully as possible. By using the 
resources of a phenomenological orientation -
such 
as experientially grounded language, narrative descrip-
tion, insider experience, and a sensitivity to common 
patterns across contexts ( eidetic features) -
the body 
could return to its place of authority in physical educa-
tion and the lifeworld.

POLAND 
Polish phenomenology has been 
shaped by both externa! circumstances, especially po-
litica! realities, and by Polish intellectual culture, tra-
dition, and language. Phenomenology as a distinct 
movement was first introduced to Poland in 1913 by 
WLADYSLAW TATARKIEWICZ, who \ater became one ofthe 
most prominent Polish historians of philosophy and 
aesthetics. ROMAN INGARDEN published his first article 
on phenomenology in 1919. 
In 1928, LEOPOLD BLAUSTEIN pub\ished Husser-
[owska nauka o akcie, tresci i przedmiocie przedstaw-
ienia (Husserl's science ofthe act, content, and subject 
of representation). Next to Ingarden, Blaustein was 
the only significant phenomenologist in Poland be-
fore World War II. He published frequently until 1938. 
He was silenced and !ater died during World War II 
in a Nazi concentration camp. Blaustein, like Ingar-
den, was connected with Lvov, the birth place of the 
Lvov-Warsaw school in philosophy and logic. Neither 
of them, however, commited himself to that school. 
At that time, they both promoted EDMUND HUSSERL's 
version of phenomenology. Ingarden eventually de-
veloped his own version. One should notice, however, 
that the founder ofthe Lvov-Warsaw school, Kazimierz 
Twardowski ( 1866--1938), was, like Husserl, a student 
of FRANZ BRENTANO. Twardowski's theory of objects 
of thought caused a polemica! reaction in Husserl. 
Roman Ingarden was a student of both Twardowski 
and Husserl. His option for phenomenology resulted 
in an outsider's position in Lvov where he lived before 
World War Il. 
The years 1939-56 were very unfavorable for Polish 
intellectual life in general, phenomenology included.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
regime that saw in phenomenology a threat to Marxist 
ideology. In the early 1950s, MARXISM became the only 
philosophy taught in state universities. 
The Communist Party introduced a more friendly 
policy toward intellectuals in 1956 and there was rel-
ative prosperity for Ingarden and a growing interest in 
phenomenology thereafter. Severa! articles on pheno-
menology were published in Polish philosophicaljour-
nals each year. But the philosophical mainstream in 
Poland was dominated by disputes between Marxists 
and non-Marxists (mainly Roman Catholics). Pheno-
menology never enjoyed a central position. Together 
with its old adversary, the Lvow-Warsaw school and 
its descendents, it was rather a "neutra!" zone since the 
1960s. A phenomenologist ora philosopher of science 
could also be a Marxist ora Catholic. The ideologica! 
approach was a hidden one. What appeared on the sur-
face was an objective, "ideologically neutra!," rational 
investigation. Nevertheless, the frequently taken ap-
proach was manifested in the question: what is wrong 
in this philosophy? rather than: is the statement under 
scrutiny true? 
Roman lngarden had a group of students and 
colleagues who continued and developed his tra-
dition of phiJosophizing (ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA, 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA, WLADYSLAW STROZEWSKI, ADAM 
WEGRZECKI, and ANDRZEJ POLTAWSKI). Ingarden's views 
and judgments were crucial to the way most of the 
youn-ger Po1ish philosophers (not only his students) 
approached phenomenology. The main interests ofthat 
group of phenomenologists was in AESTHETICS, VALUE 
THEORY, and PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 
Another scholar whose philosophy and charismatic 
personality attracted students to phenomenology was 
KAROL WOJTYLA (Pope John Paul II). Wojtyla was intro-
duced to phenomenology by his philosophy professor, 
Roman Ingarden. Next to him, TADEUSZ STYCZEN and 
JOZEF TISCHNER are the most prominent Roman Catholic 
clergy phenomenologists in Poland. Both can be de-
scribed as Thomist ( or neo-Thomist) personalists, or 
Thomist phenomenologists. Their main field of inter-
est is ethics, philosophical anthropology, and social 
and politica! philosophy. The phenomenology of Sty-
czeri and Tischner has been formed in the tradition of 
Jacques Maritain ( 1872-1973 ), the French existential-
isi, and Scheler, under the heavy infl.uence of Karol 
Wojtyla. Many young scholars continue this tradition. 
In 1967, Karol Martei published the first book 
on Husserl in Poland after World War II: U pod-
staw fenomenologii Husserla ( At the base of Husserl 's 
phenomenology). This book was for many years an 
important text for philosophy students interested in 
phenomenology. 
After 1970, when the so-called "normalization" of 
the politica! relations between Poland and West Ger-
many took place, Polish authorities no Ion ger objected 
to research on such prominent German thinkers as 
Friedrich Nietzsche, MARTIN HEIDEGGER, KARL JASPERS, 
and others. Until then, each ofthose philosophers had 
been virtually banned from intellectual life in Poland, 
at least on its official, public level. Nietzsche was seen 
through the Ienses of Gyorgy Lukacs, i.e., as being 
above aii the forerunner of Nazism. Heidegger's un-
doubted links with the Nazi Party had made the ap-
propriateness of not only any affirmative, but even of 
any neutra!, "purely philosophical," study of his phi-
losophy questionable. Jaspers was labeled as an anti-
communist. However, after West German chancellor 
Willy Brandt visited Poland and paid tribute to those 
killed by the Nazis on Polish soi!, the era of "building 
bridges between West and East" was declared. Polish 
philosophers, especially those of the younger gener-
ation, eagerly tried to catch up with the West and to 
explore long forbidden terrains. Hence from the early 
1970s one can witness in Poland a growing number of 
publications on German phenomenologists. 
The idealism-realism controversy between Ingar-
den and Husserl doubtlessly contributed to agreat pop-
ularity of Edmund Husserl in Poland. The interest in 
his philosophy was to a certain degree a result of in-
teres! in Ingarden. Husserl's works are the works most 
frequently discussed by Polish philosophers interested 
in phenomenology. 
Polish phenomenologists from the generation ofln-
garden's students are more or less "lngardenists." This 
resulted from the authority oflngarden and from signif-
icant inaccessibility of foreign books in Poland. With 
the exception of Ingarden, ali great phenomenologists 
of the "classical" period of this movement were non-
Polish. Even lngarden wrote some of his works origi-
nally in German. In some cases, it was years until these 
were translated into Polish. 
For the above reasons and also because ofthe high 
position of HISTORY as a discipline in Poland, many 

POLAND 
of the post-World War II works on phenomenology 
( especially those written before the 1980s) belong to 
the field ofthe history ofphilosophy. 
Since many original works were inaccessible, the 
way in which the views of a foreign philosopher were 
presented to Polish readers affected their opinion of 
that philosopher. Therefore, some scholars who are 
not really phenomenologists are very important for 
phenomenology in Poland. This is especially true in 
the case of Leszek Kolakowski. Because of the im-
portance of Kolakowski 's own original works, and be-
cause ofhis inftuence on the present young generation 
of Polish philosophers, which is greater than that of 
Ingarden, Kolakowski's opinions about Husserl, HENRI 
BERGSON, etc., have great weight. Many young Polish 
philosophers-to-be became interested in Husserl be-
cause Kolakowski wrote about him. Kolakowski treats 
phenomenology first and foremost as part of the his-
tory of European philosophy, i.e., as being a search 
for answers to "timeless" questions already asked in 
pre-Socratic Greece. The human condition, our quest 
for knowledge, our fascination with transcendence are 
subjects of his interest. 
KRZYSZTOF MICHALSKI aJso had a significant impact 
on the reception of phenomenology in Poland. In the 
1970s, he published extensively on phenomenology, 
especialJy on Heidegger and HANS-GEORG GADAMER. 
His comprehensive and challenging work on Heideg-
ger was titled Heidegger i filozofia wsp6lczesna (Hei-
degger and contemporary philosophy, 1978). In it he 
translated the specifically Heideggerian terms into Pol-
ish (many of them for the first time) and strongly in-
ftuenced the perception of Heidegger in Poland. His 
translation of Heidegger 's neologisms, being basically 
an imposition of a certain interpretation, is by now 
well-rooted in Polish philosophical jargon. 
Free from the obstacles it faced in Poland, pheno-
menology was developed by some Polish philosophers 
abroad. Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka is the most success-
ful among them. The other great Polish name in pheno-
menology in the UNITED STATES is ROBERT SOKOLOWSKI. 
However, being already a third-generation American, 
Sokolowski does not regard himselfas part ofthe Pol-
ish philosophical community. Tymieniecka received 
her initial philosophical education in Poland, being 
a student of Ingarden whose phenomenology -
as 
well as Karol Wojtyla 's- she energetically promotes 
539 
worldwide. Tymieniecka has elaborated her own ap-
proach to phenomenology. With a major interest in 
aesthetics, she focuses her philosophy on the problems 
of human creativity and life. 
Many of the leading phenomenologists in France 
as welJ as Germany (JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, GABRIEL MAR-
CEL, MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, MARTIN HEIDEGGER) were 
known in Poland as existentialists rather than phe-
nomenologists, since the term EXISTENTIAL PHENOMEN-
OLOGY was not commonly used in Poland un tii recently. 
Next to his philosophy offreedom, Sartre 's atheism 
was a foca! point for the philosophers in Poland, which 
has been a battlefield in the war between the Roman 
Catholic Church and the Communist Party. In 1961, 
one ofthe most brilliant Polish philosophers, and at that 
time one ofthe Jeading Party ideologists, Adam Schaff, 
published Marksizm a egzystencjalizm (Marxism vs. 
existentialism). Schaff's role in stimulating interest in 
phenomenology was similar to Kolakowski's. In this 
book, which really opened the debate on EXISTENTIAL-
ISM in Poland, Schaffpresented Sartre as an existential-
ist and the problem of"existentialism and humanism" 
vs. "Marxism and humanism" as the kind of problem 
Marxist philosophers could and should be occupied 
with. Humanism here had three aspects: the Heideg-
gerian concept presented in his "Brief iiber den Hu-
manismus" ( 194 7), the Renaissance concept, and the 
popular understanding of humanism as basically syn-
onymous with "atheism." Many philosophers jumped 
on the bandwagon at that time. At the same time, the 
Roman Catholic philosophers, notably Wojtyla, pro-
moted Maritain's existential humanism. 
Ultimately, the problem of"religious faith vs. philo-
sophical faith" became a major subject ofinvestigation. 
Philosophers such as Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Leon 
Shestov, Nikolai Berdyaev, Martin Buber, Jaspers, and 
Heidegger were discussed from that position. 
An anthology of texts by leading French, German, 
and Russian existential phenomenologists titled Filo-
zofia egzystencjalna (Existential philosophy) was pub-
lished by Leszek Kolakowski and Krzysztof Pomian 
in 1965. They wrote a very insightful introduction 
to this anthology. Both the introduction and the texts 
published in Filozofia egzystencjalna served students 
for years as a basic source of knowledge about ex-
istentialism. With time, however, the initial fascina-
tion with existentialism faded. Today, there is some 

540 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
interest in particular philosophers (Sartre, Jaspers, Bu-
ber, Shestov, Berdyaev) or in particular problems (the 
Other, communication, freedom, reason vs. faith, etc.) 
rather than in existentialism as a movement. In 1972, 
in a special issue of Studia Filozoficzne devoted to 
Roman Ingarden, Stefan Sarnowski published a text, 
"Fenomenologia i egzystencjalizm" (Phenomenology 
and existentialism), that can be regarded as a summary 
ofthe debate on existentialism in Poland. 
Discussions of Sartre and existentialism did not en-
tirely dominate the phenomenological movement in 
Poland. Roman Catholic phenomenologists like ADAM 
WţGRZECKI were interested first of ali in Max Scheler. 
Karol Wojtyla's occupation with Scheler's philosophy 
contributed to this interest immensely. Wojtyla was one 
of the most important Polish phenomenologists, even 
before he became pope. His election to the Holy See 
only magnified interest in his philosophy among Pol-
ish scholars. Numerous works are devoted to his philo-
sophical views, and even more are written in the spirit 
ofhis philosophy. Wojtyla's phenomenology, focusing 
on the ethical and metaphysical sta tus of a person as 
well as his theory of action is strongly influenced by 
Thomas Aquinas. This combination of Thomism and 
phenomenological anthropology and ethics is visible 
in many works ofPolish philosophers in the 1980s and 
1990s. 
After Husserl and Scheler, Heidegger became the 
most important foreign phenomeno1ogist for Poland. 
In the same decade, serious scholarship on Jaspers 
was initiated by Roman Rudzir\.ski, whose untimely 
death in 1985 left his work unifinished. In the 1980s, 
Jaspers's philosophy became a major point of inter-
est for KRYSTYNA GORNIAK-KOCIKOWSKA and CZESLAWA 
PIECUCH. Maurice Merleau-Ponty, NICOLAI HARTMANN, 
PAUL RICCEUR, and HANS-GEORG GADAMER are a[so fre-
quent[y discussed in Polish philosophical literature. 
From the late 1970s on, they were joined by HAN-
NAH ARENDT, DIETRICH VON HILDEBRAND, EDITH STEIN, EM-
MANUEL LEVINAS, JACQUES DERRIDA, and OCCasionally by 
ALFRED SCHUTZ. JACEK SOJKA published a book on the 
social onto1ogy of Schutz entitled Pomi?dzyfilozofig a 
socjologig: Spoleczna ontologia Alfreda Schiitza (Be-
tween philosophy and sociology: The social ontology 
of Alfred Schutz, 1991 ). 
Persona1ism was another field of interest for 
Catholic phenomenologists. GABRIEL MARCEL ( 1889-
1973), Emmanuel Mounier ( 1905-1950), and Jacques 
Maritain were introduced to the Polish audience as per-
sonalists or "re1igious existentialists." Karol Wojtyla's 
interest in Maritain contributed very strong1y to the 
popularity ofhis philosophy in Po1and. Some Marxists 
(e.g., Klara J<;drzejczak, Ryszard Poplawski) specia1-
ized in critica!, anticlerical presentations of personal-
ism. Others attempted an "objective," "nonreligious" 
analysis of that movement. Even Protestant thinkers 
like Andrzej W6jtowicz participated in the dispute on 
the meaning of a Person. 
One of the best known concepts of the Poznan 
schoo1 of methodo1ogy (Jerzy Kmita, Leszek Nowak, 
Wlodzimierz Lawniczak, etc.) ~ the method of ab-
straction and gradual concretization, which has been 
presented (wrong1y, as shown by A. Kocikowski) 
as "Marx's scientific method" ~ has visible traces 
of Husserl 's "princip1e of all principles" and of ln-
garden 's concept of "concretization" as presented in 
Das literarische Kunstwerk (The literary work of art, 
1931 ). Although the Poznan school of methodo1ogy 
originated from the phi1osophy of one of the most 
prominent members ofthe Lvov-Warsaw schoo1, Kaz-
imierz Ajdukiewicz, it has enough space left for its 
members and supporters to be creatively interested in 
phenomenology. Works by younger scholars ~ 
e.g., 
EWA KOBYLINSKA'S investigation on INTENTIONALITY and 
hermeneutica! pansemiotism, S6jka's on Schutz, and 
PAWEL ozoowsKI's texts on Ricceur ~ 
can serve as ex-
amples. Barbara Kotowa wrote on Ingarden's aesthet-
ics. However, Poznan never really was a very signifi-
cant center ofphenomenology in Po1and. 
On the other hand, the achievements of the mem-
bers ofthe Poznan school ha ve an influence on the way 
phenomenology is dealt with in Poland today. Scholars 
ofthe younger generation use texts written by members 
of Poznan school. For examp1e, writing on aesthetics, 
LUKASZ A. PLESNAR supports his views by quoting Jerzy 
Kmita and Wlodzimierz Lawniczak's work in aesthet-
ics and theory of culture, although neither Kmita nor 
Lawniczak are phenomenologists. Phenomenology in 
Poland is not iso1ated. Scholars from different philo-
sophical orientations influence and creatively stimulate 
one another. 
Thanks to Ingarden, the interest in phenomenologi-
cal aesthetics was very high among Polish philoso-
phers. Anna-Tere sa Tymieniecka, Maria Golaszewska, 

POLAND 
Alicja Kuczynska, and Wladyslaw Str6zewski are 
the most significant. Aesthetics was an area where 
"friendly coexistence" of opposite philosophical po-
sitions occasionally turned into a battlefield. For in-
stance, Ingarden was criticized for proposing "false 
solutions" for some problems important for the soci-
ology of literature and for not showing enough inter-
est in the social context ofthe reception ofthe literary 
work. Numerous authors, such as JANINA MAKOTA, JERZY 
SWIECIMSKI, and G. SZULCZEWSKI, used phenomenology 
for solving specific problems in aesthetics, especially 
in the visual arts. In the United States, WOJCIECH CHOJNA, 
who was educated in Poland, and !ater studied under 
J. N. MOHANTY and Joseph Margolis, uses his Ingarden-
oriented phenomenologyto investigate problems in so-
cial philosophy and aesthetics. 
R. w. KLUSZYNSKI deals with the place ofphenomen-
ology in the theory of FILM as do WACLAW M. OSADNIK 
and LUKASZ PLESNAR. Osadnik and Plesnar claim that 
intentiona! objects are the hasis for the creation ofthe 
representational stratum of a film work. Having their 
work rooted in the linguistic theories, they propose to 
speak ofthe quasi-intentional character of such objects 
in the same sense as one speaks ofthe quasi-linguistic 
nature of film communication, because it stresses their 
theoretical character. 
Philosophy of language is a major field of interest 
for HANNA BUCZYNSKA-GAREWICZ. Her other interest is 
the problem of freedom. She is inftuenced mainly by 
Husserl and Scheler. 
Part ofthe works by ANDREZEJ POLTAWSKI, Krystyna 
Zamiara, A. Zalewski, K. Sroda pertain to phenomen-
ological PSYCHOLOGY. P6ltawski was a disciple of In-
garden, but is also strongly inftuenced by Karol Wojtyla 
and HENRI EY. His other point of reference is the phi-
losophy of G. E. Moare (1873-1958). His interest in 
the problems of consciousness and PERCEPTION make 
philosophy of knowledge and phenomenological psy-
chology his main fields of activity. P6ltawski's book 
Swiat, spostrzeienie, Swiadomosc: Fenomenologiczna 
koncepcja swiadomosd a realizm (World, perception, 
consciousness: The phenomenological concept of con-
sciousness and realism, 1972) belongs now to the canon 
of classic texts in the field. Another area of his in-
vestigation is philosophical anthropology. Converg-
ingly, GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY, especially in the work of 
Kurt Lewin ( 1890-194 7) and Wolfgang Kohler ( 1887-
541 
1967), who inftuenced Jan Dembowski's Psychologia 
malp (The psychology of apes, 1951 ), has been appre-
ciated in Poland. An important book written from the 
position ofGestalt theory, Trud istnienia (The hardship 
of existence, 1986) by Kazimierz Dl_lbrowski, author 
of a theory ofpositive disintegration, serves as support 
for Brunon Holyst's views on Husserl 's ethical an-
tirelativism. Phenomenologically inftuenced works by 
Jacek S6jka, Jacek Tittenbrun, Zdzislaw Krasnodl_lbski, 
M. Czyzewski, and others, have been published in so-
CIOLOGY. Stanislaw Czerniak published a book on Max 
Scheler's sociology of knowledge entitled Socjologia 
wiedzy Maxa Schelera (Max Scheler's sociology of 
knowledge, 1981, with a summary in German). 
A new generation of more "world-oriented" schol-
ars, scholars who are ready to join the international 
community, is emerging now in Poland. However, the 
present "atomization" of phenomenology in general, 
i.e., its split into numerous quite separate divisions, 
does not make the situation easy. At present, it is dif-
ficult to say which of the phenomenological orienta-
tions, if any, will gain the greatest popularity among 
the young Polish philosophers and will be creatively 
developed. It is also too soon to see how will they use 
the freedom from ideologica! and politica! pressure. 
However, the new politica! situation after the fali of 
Communism, and the new generation ofphilosophers, 
seem to be promising for the future of Polish pheno-
menology. In general, the direction provided by Karol 
Wojtyla is continued by his disciples and by the young 
generation of scholars trained by them. This is today 
the strongest current in Polish phenomenology. Thanks 
to much greater freedom than was the case in older gen-
erations, Polish philosophers participate intensively in 
the international exchange of ideas. A significant num-
ber of them live and publish outside of Poland. For 
many (e.g., K. G6rniak-Kocikowska, J. S6jka, and W. 
Zelaniec) phenomenology is one but not the only field 
of interest. In other cases, a philosopher is interested 
in certain problems (such as time, freedom, creativ-
ity, etc.) and investigates this problem from different 
perspectives with phenomenology being one of them. 
There are new initiatives and new fields of interest, 
some of which are presented below. 
Bogdan Baran wrote the first book in Poland pre-
senting phenomenology in the UNITED STATES. It is both 
a short history ofthat movement there and the introduc-

542 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
tion of some of its most important achievements. Baran 
names JAMES M. EDIE, LESTER EMBREE, DON IHDE, HUGH SIL-
VERMAN, ROBERT SOKOLOWSKI, HERBERT SPIEGELBERG, and 
Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka as representative for con-
temporary American phenomenology. From his point 
of view, Americans started to be interested in pheno-
menology when phenomenology in Germany was dy-
ing, which in his opinion happened in the 1940s. Baran 
is very cautiously optimistic about the fate of pheno-
menology in its last fortress, America. 
MARIA BIELAWKA writes on the discovery of inner 
time-constituting consciousness in an essay in Studia 
Filozoficzne, 1990. In that paper, she shows a pos-
sible way of explaining the epistemological paradox 
of our consciousness, which is timeless but has the 
ability of constituting TIME. She accepts the thesis that 
Husserl 's opening up of the domain of in ner conscious-
ness was possible because of a momentary, apodicti-
cally certain, transcendental or critica! self-reflection. 
Bielawka sides with Husserl in the conclusion that it 
is a necessity of reason to accept the existence of a di-
vine being (the absolutely creative consciousness). Her 
strong statement about the meaning of "constitution" 
by Husserl as co-creation of reality through the agency 
ofthe structure of our mind somewhat summarizes the 
years of discussions Polish phenomenologists ha ve had 
on the nature ofhuman being and ofhuman actions. By 
saying that the human being is the co-creator of reality, 
and by tracing this view back to Husserl, she places the 
achievements ofPolish Roman Catholic phenomenol-
ogists in the legitimate Husserlian tradition. 
Extensive work in the field of Husserl studies has 
been done by STANISLAW JUDYCKI, whose book /nter-
subiektywnosc i czas (lntersubjectivity and time, 1990, 
with a summary in German), focuses on Husserl's late 
writings. Judycki is also interested in the investigation 
ofphenomenology per se. His articles on the nature and 
subject matter of phenomenology provide valuable in-
formation and insight. Judycki frequently refers to the 
works of German and American phenomenologists. 
The "Aletheia" Foundation publishes a periodica! 
entitled Aletheia and a series ofbooks, mostly transla-
tions of contemporary classic philosophical positions. 
An issue on Heidegger dzisiaj (Heidegger today) was 
published in 1990. It contains short writings by Hei-
degger, including "Mein Weg in die Phănomenologie" 
(1963), and texts about Heidegger. The volume is de-
voted to his philosophy and to the controversy about 
Heidegger and Nazism (with a bibliography on that 
subject). As it was in the past forty years, Cracow, 
Lublin, and also Warsaw remain the cities in which 
most of the research in phenomenology is concen-
trated.

POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY 
Every philosoph-
ical movement that deals thematically with the distin-
guishing features of human existence has important 
implications for politica) thought. And the history of 
Western politica) philosophy shows that major concep-
tual developments tend to occur when politica! life is 
particularly strife-ridden. Given the central concems 
of the phenomenological movement and the histori-
cal era in which it emerged, it is not surprising that it 
has generated a considerable body of politica! thought. 
Some of this thought builds upon fundamental claims 
defended by phenomenologists. And some of it grows 
out of criticisms directed against part orali ofthe over-
all phenomenological orientation. 
EDMUND HUSSERL 's late "Vienna" )ecture, "Die Krisis 
des europăischen Menschentums und die Philosophie" 
( 1935), draws together themes from throughout his cor-
pus. Among them are severa! whose politica! signifi-
cance becomes evident in the politica) thought ofthose 
whose philosophical work he inftuenced. In this essay, 
he argues that human beings are not merely corporeal 
entities subject to the laws of physical causality. They 
are also essentially free agents who fashion a culture 
and a history that are always open to innovation and 
that in turn provide them with resources to produce 
new achievements. He argues that because scientific 
or philosophical NATURALISMS of whatever sort treat 
human life as nothing other than one of many types 
of being, ali of which are wholly a product of and 
subject to causal mechanisms, they are both not only 
theoretically mistaken, but also practically dangerous. 
They mislead people into misconstruing the sources 
of ACTION and the possibilities for fruitful, harmonious 
communal life. 
At least as important for politica! thought is the 
analysis of human existence that MARTIN HEIDEGGER 
presents in Sein und Zeit ( 1927). This seminal work 
stresses, among other things, both the distinctiveness 
of human existence and its historicality and finitude. 
We are born into a material and cultural WORLD not of 
our own making, we inevitably modify it in ways not 
fully under our control, and we hand over the outcome 
of our transactions with one another and the surround-
ing world to the next generation. Much ofHeidegger's 
subsequent work was devoted to developing, and sig-
nificantly transforming, his treatment of these topics. 
His own politica) activity during the reign of Nazism 
clearly deserves severe censure. To what extent his con-
duct has its basis in his philosophical analyses remains 
a matter of deep controversy. Nonetheless, those anal-
yses have continued to influence the politica) thought 
of the many scholars who ha ve always been opposed 
to totalitarianisms of ali sorts. 
Both Husserl and Heidegger recognized their debt 
to KANT. But they drew different lessons from him. 
Husserl's work shows an unwavering dedication to the 
modernist Enlightenment ideal of a self-critica) com-
prehensive science toward which we are able to make 
unending progress. Heidegger's work, with its atten-

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
tion to the limitations that pervade ali thought and 
action, opens the way for sustained reflection on the 
disunities and discontinuities in ali parts ofhuman ex-
perience. This emphasis has found echo in the multiple 
versions of POSTMODERNISM. Nietzsche, who had no dis-
cernible influence on Husserl, is prominent particularly 
in Heidegger's !ater thought. 
The politica! and social context in which both 
Husserl and Heidegger lived was riddled with con-
flict. The turmoil and widespread misery that industri-
alization and the workings ofbourgeois capitalism had 
brought with them provoked strong criticism of the 
prevailing politica! order. Both fascism and Marxist 
communism gained great strength not only in intellec-
tual circles but also in daily life. MARXISM, though, held 
the much greater intellectual attraction. 
A major intellectual outcome of the rise of inter-
es! in Marx 's work was the return to prominence of 
Hegelianism, particularly those parts of it that deal 
with history and politics. Thus Marx and HEGEL, along 
with Kant, Nietzsche, Husserl, and Heidegger, estab-
lished the conceptual context in which, after World War 
II, a distinctive corpus of politica! thought developed 
that bears the unmistakable mark ofphenomenology's 
influence. 
Two of the most eminent German philosophers to 
have developed the politica! implications ofthis intel-
lectual heritage have been HANS-GEORG GADAMER and 
Jilrgen Habermas. HANNAH ARENDT, who produced her 
most important work in the United States, was also a 
native German reared in this tradition, largely under 
the tutelage of Heidegger and KARL JASPERS. 
Gadamer, whose principal work is Warheit und 
Methode (Truth and method, 1960), is in the forefront 
ofthose who followed the lead of Sein und Zeit and de-
veloped a HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY. Hermeneu-
tica] phenomenology seeks to discern meanings, uni-
ties, and continuities underlying the multiple phenom-
ena that comprise our experience of living with one 
another in a common world. Included in this search is 
the practica! aim ofbringing our own thoughts, aspira-
tions, and objectives into effective dialogue with those 
of our predecessors as well as of our contemporaries. 
In practicing this hermeneutica! phenomenology, 
Gadamer explicitly invokes the Platonic dialogues and 
Aristotle 's practica! philosophy to complement the tra-
dition of German philosophy since Kant. In particular, 
Gadamer has emphasized the linguisticality of human 
life. We always think and act on the basis of LANGUAGE. 
Rather than our having language as an acquisition, lan-
guage is constitutive ofus and the context in which we 
li ve. And, like us, language is thoroughly historical. 
Among the main implications Gadamer's work has 
for politica! philosophy are ( 1) that no theory, politica! 
or otherwise, can ever attain definitive validity, and (2) 
that ali norms for conduct, politica! or otherwise, bear 
the marks oftheir historical articulation, interpretation, 
and application. This is so because oftheir dependence 
upon traditions in which they arise and the linguisti-
cality of ali traditions. 
Thus for Gadamer, the Enlightenment project of 
seeking to achieve sufficient independence from our 
material and cultural circumstances so that we could 
exercise impartial, autonomous critica! judgment on 
either theoretical claims or practica! activity is mis-
guided. What we can come to know of the true or 
the good we know in and through the resources of 
the tradition to which we belong. Our tradition does 
not isolate us from others. Rather, it provides us with 
the wherewithal to understand. In principle, no part of 
human HISTORY is wholly inaccessible to us. But no 
interpretation of o urs of any part of it can be definitive. 
By contrast, Jilrgen Habermas's work- culminat-
ing in his theory of communicative action, which gets 
its fullest expression in Theorie des kommunikativen 
Handelns (Theory of communicative action, 1981)-
represents an attempt to refurbish the Enlightenment 
project to make it responsive to the conceptual and 
practica! contexts oftoday's politicallife. Like Husserl 
and Heidegger, Habermas rejects naturalism. But with 
Marx he emphasizes the material and social conditions 
that shape ali aspects of human life. Hegel has taught 
him the intersubjective or dialogi cal character of rea-
son. And from Kant he has learned that for each sort of 
activity there are permanent norms that determine the 
validity of any performance thereof. 
Habermas has his roots in the Frankfurt school 
of CRITIC AL THEORY. Other distinguished members of 
this school are Theodor Adorno ( 1903-1969), Karl-
Otto Apel, Max Horkheimer (1895-1973), and Her-
bert Marcu se ( 1898-1979). Pragmatism and speech 
act theory have also figured significantly in his work. 
Habermas emphasizes that we live in a linguistically 
articulated and hence public world of shared experi-

POLJTICAL PHILOSOPHY 
545 
ence. This world comprises three domains to which 
linguistic performances refer, namely, the domains of 
objective, social, and subjective reality. Politics is part 
of social reality. 
For Habermas, the central task for contemporary 
politica! thought is to determine the valid basis for the 
norms that are to guide politica! practice. He rejects the 
efforts of systems theorists and others to make politica! 
practice subject to norms derived from the exercise of 
instrumental reason. Instead he proposes a theory of 
communicative action whose norms are those required 
for undistorted communication. Only such communi-
cation, he holds, can do justice to the complexity of 
the lifeworld. The LIFEWORLD, a notion he has adapted 
from Husserl 's !ater thought, embraces all three do-
mains of reality. Norms for appropriate conduct can 
only be formulated and tested in discourse in which, 
in principle, everyone is equally entitled to participate. 
To promote and engage in such discourse is to en-
gage in fully rational communicative action. Thus the 
task of politica! practice is to establish and maintain 
institutions that support and foster communicative ac-
tion. Constitutional democracy, with the discourse and 
practices that are inherent in it, is the proper politica! 
structure for so doing. 
Among the principal contributions that Hannah 
Arendt has made to politica! philosophy are the dis-
tinctions she makes between politics and other sorts 
of activity and the account she gives of the kinds of 
achievements that politics promotes. The politica! do-
main is primarily a domain of persuasive discourse in 
which we share our opinions and judgments about how 
we should best act to set our distinctive stamp on the 
resources of the common world into which we have 
been born. The objective of politica! effort is to be-
queath to our successors a heritage that both bears the 
mark of what we ha ve accomplished and nonetheless 
leaves room for them to make their own contributions. 
For her characterization of the distinctive features of 
politics, spelled out in detail in The Human Condition 
( 1958), Arendt drew heavily on her understanding of 
the Greek polis and Aristotle's reflections on it. She 
also made extensive, though not always explicitly ac-
knowledged, use of the analysis of human existence 
that Heidegger presented in Sein und Zeit. 
Besides the German strand, there has also been a 
French strand, represented most notably by JEAN-PAUL 
SARTRE and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY. At the root oftheir 
politica! thought, in addition to the works of Husserl 
and Heidegger and their predecessors in German phi-
losophy, are the lectures of Alexandre Kojeve ( 1902-
1968) on Hegel, delivered between 1933 and 1939 and 
given book form as La lecture de Hegel (The reading 
of Hegel, 194 7). 
The politica! dimension of Sartre's work springs 
from his lifelong attention to the matter of freedom. 
In his most famous work, L'etre et le neant (1943), 
Sartre raises the issue of what we should do with the 
freedom that is unavoidably o urs. His efforts to respond 
to this issue extend over the rest ofhis work. Already in 
the review Les Temps Modernes, which he edited with 
Raymond Aron ( 1905-1983 ), SIMONE DE BEAUYOIR, and 
Merleau-Ponty and which first appeared in 1945, Sartre 
argues that we should commit ourselves to addressing 
the urgent politica! and social questions of our times. 
To do this effectively, we must recognize the dialectica! 
structure ofhuman existence. That is, in the course of 
our lives we both shape our milieu and are in turn 
shaped by it. 
Bourgeois thought, Sartre claimed, could not do jus-
tice to the dialectica! character of life. But Marxism 
provided important guidance for doing so. Commu-
nism, as a movement, brought Marxism to bear on 
contemporary social and politica! issues. But it itself 
tended to disregard the freedom constitutive of each 
person. Sartre therefore argued that a fully developed 
politica! philosophy would have to show how indi-
vidua1s, groups ofpeople, institutions, and material re-
sources ali dialectically interact, and then foster ways to 
ensure that individual freedom would always be given 
its due recognition and opportunity to be exercised. 
His Critique de la raison dialectique ( 1960) gives a 
detailed account of the dialectica! view of politics at 
which he arrived. 
The sources of Merleau-Ponty's politica! philoso-
phy were much the same as those of Sartre's. But the 
investigations that culminated in Phenomenologie de 
la perception ( 1945) led him to what he found to bea 
more subtle dialectic that was structured by ali dimen-
sions of human ]ife. PERCEPTION, MEMORY, and IMAGI-
NATION, speech, action, work, and thought ali display a 
dialectica! structure that shapes each of them and ties 
them to one another. This dialectic also ties us to one 
another, to institutions, and to our material surround-

546 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ings. Because of this pervasive dialectic, ali aspects 
of our lives display an ambivalence or ambiguity that 
never gives way to a Cartesian clarity or certainty. 
Reflecting on the politics ofhis time in Humanisme 
et terreur (1947), Merleau-Ponty maintained a hope 
that Soviet Communism would come to show itself as 
a progressive force in history, one whose violence gave 
promise of reducing subsequent violence. But Soviet 
activity connected with the North Korean invasion of 
South Korea convinced him in 1950 that this hope no 
longer had any defensible basis. 
Adding to his ongoing reflection on contemporary 
politica! events an analysis of language inspired by 
Saussurian linguistics, Merleau-Ponty came to the con-
clusion that none of the versions of Marxism that 
served as the theoretical hasis for any actually exist-
ing regime was defensible. Instead, in Les aventures 
de la dialectique ( 1955), he concluded that parliamen-
tary democracy was the best presently available form 
of regime. Because it provides for an expression of 
opposition to established practices and policies, parlia-
mentary democracy in effect gives formal recognition 
to the inevitable ambiguity ofpoliticallife. 
CLAUDE LEFORT, who worked cioseJy with him, 
has continued to develop politica! themes central to 
Merleau-Ponty's thought. Among these developments 
are Lefort's studies ofthe French Revolution and of de 
Tocqueville's reflections on democracy, which are to 
be found in his Essais sur le politique ( 1986). 
Though PAUL RICCEUR has not written extensively on 
politics, what he has written is of considerable interest. 
His reflections on politics are applications ofhis studies 
dealing with TIME, history, ACTION, and the self. The 
sources on which he draws are Jargely those that inform 
Merleau-Ponty's work. But as Soi-meme comme un 
autre (Self as another, 1990) shows, he has also taken 
into account pertinent parts of recent Anglo-American 
ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY. 
FRANCE is also home to a postmodern current 
of politica! thought, many of whose principal fig-
ures develop at least parts of their positions in ex-
plicit opposition to phenomenology. Among them are 
Gilles DeJeuze, JACQUES DERRIDA, MICHEL FOUCAULT, EM-
MANUEL LEVINAS, and Jean-Francois Lyotard. The post-
modernists agree that the Enlightenment claims for a 
reason that is able to establish universal, ahistorically 
valid truths and norms are indefensible. So too are any 
phenomenologically based claims that consciousness 
or the self is capable of attaining wholly undistorted 
insights either into itself or into its surrounding world. 
Nietzsche or Freud or both, by reason oftheir diagnoses 
of the numerous ways in which we delude ourselves, 
provide resources that many postmodernists deploy in 
articulating their critiques of politica! doctrines and 
practices. 
Contemporary French FEMINISM tends to agree with 
the general postmodern critique of any thought deriv-
ing from Enlightenment principles or from phenomen-
ological analyses of consciousness. Prominent here are 
Helene Cixous, Luce Irigaray, and Julia Kristeva. 
Both the German and the French strands of po-
litica! philosophy informed by phenomenology have 
had a significant impact upon recent politica! thought 
in North America. Numerous books and articles on 
topics in politica! thought that reflect phenomenologi-
cal influence appear each year. This influence is also 
evident in the presentations made at many meetings 
of professional academic societies. Among the many 
American scholars who have brought phenomenolog-
ically informed politica! thought to prominence in the 
UNITED STATES and in the process have critically en-
riched it, severa! are particularly deserving of men-
tion. FRED DALLMAYR has made clear, subtle analyses 
of major parts of both the German and the French 
strands. His work on Heidegger is especially notewor-
thy. Comparable clarity, insight, and scope is charac-
teristic of Richard Bernstein's studies ofboth ofthese 
strands. Seyla Benhabib, Thomas McCarthy, and Tom 
Rockmore ha ve produced impressive critica! studies of 
principal parts ofthe German strand. Benhabib, Nancy 
Fraser, and IRIS MARION YOUNG have ali made notable 
contributions to feminist thought by drawing on both 
German and French sources. 
No less noteworthy work has been done by Amer-
ican scholars on the French strand. Ronald Aronson, 
WILLIAM MCBRIDE, and THOMAS FLYNN have done im-
portant work on Sartre's politica! philosophy. Flynn 
has also contributed substantially to Foucault schol-
arship, as have James Bernauer and David Hoy. SONIA 
KRUKS 's and HWA YOL JUNG 's critiques ofMerleau-Ponty 
and other French phenomenological thinkers also merit 
mention. JOHN CAPUTO and William Connolly ha ve help-
fully drawn attention to the politica! implications of 
severa] French postmodemists. The phenomenologi-

POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY 
547 
cally informed environmental philosophy that ALBERT 
BORGMAM has developed likewise has weighty impli-
cations for politics. 
Mention also should be made of the affinities be-
tween contemporary communitarian politica! thought 
and the phenomenological tradition. They both stand 
in opposition to the individualism that is ingredient in 
many versions of politica! liberalism. Instead, commu-
nitarians emphasize the ties that not only bind us to 
communities but are indeed constitutive of us. Each 
of these communities has its own distinctive history, 
a prominent part of which is some accepted view of 
a shared or common good that its members should 
seek to realize. Hence- liberalism notwithstanding 
-
each person's own individual good is inextricably 
bound up with those of his or her fellow citizens. It 
follows then that justice is not first and foremost a pro-
cedural matter and that it is indissociable from the com-
mon good rather than enjoying a priority overthe good. 
Two of the most prominent communitarians, Charles 
Taylor and Alasdair Maclntyre, clearly recognize their 
affinities with important parts ofthe phenomenological 
tradition. 
Running through the wide-ranging debates that 
comprise the politica! thought nurtured by or generated 
in opposition to phenomenology is much the same set 
of issues that has been perennial in Westem politica! 
philosophy. Among these issues are four that are par-
ticularly prominent now at the end of the 20th century. 
One of these is the nature of the politica! agent. To 
what extent, if any, can individuals exercise genuine 
agency? If they can, then how do they come topos-
sess the appropriate qualifications for exercising it? A 
second, closely related, issue concems how a person 
acquires legitimate authority over others. What limits 
are there to legitimate politica! authority and how are 
these limits tobe enforced? Third, how does one deter-
mine the proper relationships between the individual 
person and his or her fellows and their politica! institu-
tions? For example, to what extent is family life tobe 
subject to politica! regulation? The fourth of these is-
sues is perhaps the one that most distinguishes our era 
from previous ones. It is the issue of how the human 
community is to respond to the scarcity of resources. 
This ever more obvious scarcity of a number of vital 
resources, e.g., water, arable land, usable energy, and 
health care, raises questions concerning just distribu-
tions whose complexity is without precedent. Dealing 
well with the scarcity of these and other resources is 
no longer something that an individual state, however 
powerful, can do. The scarcity can only be effectively 
dealt with intemationally. Today, a politica! philoso-
phy that does not respond to ali ofthese issues in some 
detail is seriously impoverished. Each ofthese matters 
is weighty and they ali impinge upon one another. How 
one deals with any ofthem has ramifications for ali of 
them. 
By its rej ection of ali versions of naturalism, pheno-
menological thought implies that the future is open to 
human initiative that can be either good or bad. What 
at least some of us do at least some of the time intro-
duces something genuinely new into the world. One 
domain in which the new can occur is that ofpolitics. 
Phenomenological reflection therefore sets two endur-
ing tasks for the politica! philosopher. First, it calls for 
him or her to describe as fully as possible the scope and 
nature of our capacity to bring about something new in 
the public order of our relations with o ne another. And 
second, it calls for an analysis of what distinguishes 
the beneficent new from the trivial or the maleficent 
new.

POLITICAL SCIENCE 
BERNARD P. DAUENHAUER 
University of Georgia 
This discipline has 
come to ha ve a fairly exact meaning in the second half 
of the 20th century: the attempt to study politics by 
using methodologies that replicate, as far as possible, 
those of NATURAL sciENCE. This undertaking generally 
grounds itselfin a model ofscientific inquiry as "value-
free" -
as a study of "facts" only, conducted by a 
neutra] and dispassionate observer. It offers a positivist 
account ofpolitics, treating politica! phenomena as sets 
of objective, empirica! data from which explanatory 
and- ideally- predictive models can be developed, 
particularly through the use of aggregating quantitative 
techniques. It is behaviorist in orientation, focusing 
on the observable behaviors and the recordable and 
quantifiable opinions of politica! actors to the exclusion 
of more experiential dimensions of politics. It is also 
atomistic in its conceptions, regarding individuals as 
fundamentally discrete entities and politica! systems 
as devices that aggregate their interests and actions. It 
fosters NATURALISM. 
Politica! science thus conceived developed above 
ali in the UNITED STATES. Although contested today, it 
still continues to be the dominant paradigm for the 
study ofpolitics there, and has also been influential on 
the academic study ofpolitics in European universities 
and elsewhere. The entire "canonica!" phenomenologi-
cal tradition, from EDMUND HUSSERL to the !ater work 
of JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, contains an incipient critique of 
politica! science, putting into question its claims to 
objectivity and value-neutrality and its behaviorist ex-
clusion ofiNTENTIONALITY, MEANING, and consciousness 
from the study of politics. However, none of the ma in 
figures of the tradition ha ve engaged directly with the 
discipline. 
The point of origin for a phenomenological critique 
of politica! science perhaps !ies in Husserl 's critique 
of the "natural attitude" in science and his insistence, 
in his late work Die Krisis der europăischen Wis-
senschaften und die transzendentale Phănomenologie 
(1936), on the priority of the "lifeworld" (Lebenswelt) 
as a pre-refiective dimension that must ground any kind 
of conscious investigation or activity. The lifeworld is 
thus both the ground for the conceptual operations of 
politica! science itself and also always exists as the 
ground for politica! action of any kind. In neglecting 
this, the positivist politica! scientist fails to grasp his 
or her own lived relation to what is being studied and 
also ignores fundamental dimensions of politica! real-
ity, instead fiattening the ambiguous world of politics 
into a domain of exact and manipulable data. 
This last point can be further illuminated through 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER's account of technology. The 
essence ofTECHNOLOGY, Heidegger argues, is a mode of 
disclosure ofBeing that "enframes" or brings forth na-
ture as mere "standing reserve" for human uses. Such 
an attitude replaces the open and refiective questioning 
ofBeing that is the essence ofthe human being with a 
calculating rationality that "entraps" nature. Moreover, 
such an enframing threatens to extend itself from the 
domain ofnature to humans themselves, reducing even 
human beings to merely quantifiable resources. Viewed 
from such a perspective, politica! science is part of a 
dangerous and potentially dehumanizing movement. 
Heidegger also puts into question the atomistic con-
ception of human beings on which politica! science 
rests by arguing that human existence is always a form 
of co-being or Mitsein. The self is not a sharply de-
lineated EGO or a self-referential cogito, but always a 
dwelling in the world with others. Thus aggregating 
"individual" opinions or actions will not take us very 
far in understanding the politica! domain. 
In the french EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY of MAU-
RICE MERLEAU-PONTY, a critique of atomistic and empiri-
cist notions of the self is yet more directly brought to

POLITICAL SCIENCE

bear on the HUMAN sciENCES and on the analysis ofpol-
itics and HISTORY. For Merleau-Ponty human existence 
is always embodied. Thus the observer is situated in his 
or her field of perception, and knowledge is always at 
root perspectiva!. A detached vision, such as positivism 
claims to have of its objects of study, is never possi-
ble. Merleau-Ponty criticizes both behaviorist psychol-
ogy and the positivism of"orthodox MARXISM," which 
claims to have an objective and scientific knowledge 
of the "laws" of history. He insists that both miss the 
necessarily open, or indeterminate, quality of human 
existence. Although we can talk of tendencies in hu-
man history, and of "sedimentations" that predispose 
individuals, and even societies, toward particular ends, 
the realm ofhuman ACTION remains one of openness-
indeed freedom -
that precludes definitive explana-
tions or predictions. Freedom, as Merleau-Ponty puts 
it in Phenomenologie de la perception ( 1945), "thrusts 
roots into the world," such that human existence must 
rather be conceived as a dialectic offreedom and struc-
ture, ofthe contingent and the necessary. 
Given such a dialectica! quality to human existence, 
it follows also that the distinction between facts and 
VALUEs -
on which politica! science places such im-
portance -
is put into question. Facts can never be 
wholly "objective," while values do not belong to the 
sphere ofjudgment alone, but are created in a concrete 
situation not always wholly of our own choosing or 
making. The project of a value-neutral politica! science 
is, following Merleau-Ponty, not merely misguided but 
hazardous, for it refuses to recognize its own values and 
evades responsibility for their consequences. It also in-
volves an unjustifiable hubris conceming the capacity 
of human reason to understand the world of politics, 
for this is a world where sense can rapidly turn into 
nonsense and good intentions into sources of suffering 
or violence. 
Phenomenology does not only engage with polit-
ica! science as a methodological critique. There are 
also some thinkers who develop phenomenologically 
informed accounts ofthe politica! world. These bear on 
the substantive concems of politica! science while also 
addressing issues, notably about the place of freedom 
and MEANING in politics, that politica! scientists nor-
mally disregard. This is particularly true ofthe work of 
HANNAH ARENDT (in her youth a student of Heidegger), 
who wrote extensively on politics after World War II. 
As a German Jew and a refugee in the United States 
for most ofher productive life, Arendt's concerns were 
shaped by the politica! evils of Nazism and other totali-
tarian regimes in ways in which the work of Heidegger 
certainly was not. But much ofher work can be read as 
a critica! appropriation and development for the realm 
of politics of his account of DASEIN as a disclosure of 
Being. 
In The Human Condition (1958), Arendt distin-
guishes between labor, work, and action as the three 
central dimensions ofhuman existence. Although labor 
(the cycle of repetitive tasks necessary for the basic bi-
ologica! maintenance ofhuman beings) and work (the 
fabrication of durable things through which humans 
put their mark upon nature) are both necessary to the 
human condition, it is in the sphere ofaction-the vita 
activa- that human being and freedom most fully ap-
pear. It is in this sphere also that she locates politics, at 
least at its best. 
The vita activa is the life of action, including speech, 
and it requires as its basic condition what Arendt calls 
"human plurality." By the latter she means the exis-
tence of a web of human relationships between peo-
ple who are never identica!, yet who experience them-
selves as sufficiently equal tobe a bie to understand one 
another other. Were they identica!, were there no dis-
tinctions between them, action as a way of disclosing 
the self to others would not be necessary. But it is in 
action that human beings uniquely reveal who they are, 
that the self discloses and creates itself. For this dis-
closure to take place there must be a possible space of 
disclosure-that is, a public space, ora politica/ arena. 
Thus politics is not properly about economic matters 
or the pursuit of personal self-interest, but is about the 
free disclosure of self, through deeds and words, to 
one 's equals in a public realm. It was to ancient Greece 
that Arendt looked for this paradigm of politics- to 
the polis. There, within a literal and moral space de-
fined by the fabric of the laws, free and equal citizens 
could engage, in Aristotle's words, in the "sharing of 
words and deeds." 
This vision takes politics tobe significantly different 
from the power-centered and interest-laden object of 
study ofthe modem politica! scientist. But although she 
looks to ancient Greece for the original model, Arendt 
uses this vis ion as a powerful heuristic tool for analysis 
and critique of the modern politica! world. Through it 

550 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
she brings to light the ways in which the instrumentality 
associated with labor has degraded the politica! sphere. 
She also persistently searches for the specific forms in 
which public spaces for appearance have, from time to 
time, reappeared in history and addresses the question 
ofhow such spaces might further be fostered now. Thus 
starting from what politica! scientists would categorize 
as a normative theory- one about what politics ought 
ideally to be, not about what it is -
she develops an 
analysis of modern politica! institutions and processes 
that can cast new light on some of the substantive 
matters with which politica! science concems itself. 
The modern world, Arendt shows, is one in which 
the "instrumentalization of action" and the concomi-
tant "degradation ofpolitics" into mere means for other 
ends has become pervasive. Production, consumption, 
and species survival have invaded what ought to have 
been the sphere of action for its own sake. In her es-
say On Revolution ( 1963 ), Arendt examines how what 
now passes for politics has come, since the period of 
the American and French Revolutions, increasingly to 
concern itself with nonpolitical matters: with the "so-
cial question," the utilitarian "pursuit of happiness," 
and the attempt to regulate the economy. She demon-
strates that as these concerns ofthe world oflabor ha ve 
invaded politics, the spaces for the public disclosure of 
self- the "spaces offreedom" that were created in the 
original moments of both the French and the Ameri-
can Revolutions- increasingly ha ve tended to close 
up. The institutionalization of the initial democratic 
impulse, particularly the growth of unwieldy and un-
responsive forms ofrepresentation, party systems, and 
new elites, has now stultified politics, converting it 
from a realm offree action into a set ofinstruments for 
the efficient administration of power for material ends. 
Worse, it has brought about the passivity and anomie 
ofthe masses on the basis ofwhich totalitarian regimes 
have, in some instances, been able to emerge. 
Politica) scientists, claiming to focus only on "what 
is," conceive of politics as indeed about the wielding 
of power for instrumental ends. But this focus on what 
immediately presents itselfto observation functions to 
obscure knowledge of other kinds of politica! reality. 
For as Arendt goes on to demonstrate in On Revo-
lution, there does also exist another tradition, one in 
which politics as the disclosure of being, or the realm 
of freedom, remains possible. The "lost treasures" of 
the revolutionary tradition, the "islands" and "oases" 
of freedom, presently need to be identified and nur-
tured, instead of being occluded by politica! science. 
They are to be found in the practices of face-to-face 
debate and direct action that have surfaced fleetingly 
-
yet repeatedly -
in modern politics: in the early 
American town meeting, the politica! clubs of revo-
lutionary Paris, the workers' soviets in Russia (before 
the business ofrevolution became "professionalized"), 
resistance to the Nazi occupation in Denmark, or the 
civil rights and antiwar movements ofthe 1960s in the 
United States. We need to bold onto the memory of 
such moments of free action and examine them as a 
counterpoint to the technologized emptiness of what 
today passes for politics, or as a tradition from which 
politics as a space of human disclosure and freedom 
might once again be created. 
A rather different account ofpolitics in the modern 
world, but one that also bears on the substantive con-
cerns of politica) science, can be drawn from the !ater 
work of JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, particularly from sections 
of his Critique de la raison dialectique ( 1960). Like 
Arendt, Sartre is concerned with the loss of meaning 
that human action undergoes and the ways that free-
dom comes to be "deviated" in the modern world. He 
does not operate with Arendt's distinctions between 
labor, work, and action. On the contrary, he takes what 
he calls praxis- the intentiona! transformation of na-
ture to meet human needs that Arendt calls work -
as paradigmatic of human action in general. This is 
because he argues that ali action, politica! action in-
cluded, has to take place one way or another through 
the mediations of the material world, mediations that 
always impose certain logics or "exigencies" upon it. 
Sartre's earlier work was explicitly phenomenologi-
cal. His major opus, L'etre et le neant (1943), built, 
albeit rather unfaithfully, on the work of Husserl in de-
veloping a phenomenology ofhuman existence. In the 
Critique, Sartre's aim is to integrate a phenomenologi-
cal dimension into MARXISM. For Marxism (like polit-
ica! science) has attempted to treat the human world 
as a realm ofpurely objective facts, amenable to com-
prehension through "analytical" or positivist reason. 
Against this view Sartre builds on his earlier work in 
arguing that since ali individual praxis is intentiona! 
in character, thus involving a project, the entire edi-
fice of the human world- from economic production

circuitous and complex they may be, of a multiplicity 
of such praxes. A "science" that ignores the intention-
ality ofhuman praxis~ that is, its aspect of freedom ~ 
will be able to arrive at no more than one-sided or "ab-
stract" explanations. Such a non-phenomenologically 
informed science loses sight of the concrete praxes 
through which even seemingly self-regulating systems 
and institutions are in fact maintained. Thus it ends 
by condoning evasions of responsibility for the con-
sequences ofpraxis. For example, those French social 
scientists who explained the low wage levels ofthe in-
digenous population in colonial Algeria as arising "nat-
urally," as an "inevitable" outcome ofthe interaction of 
a modem and a primitive economy, served to obscure 
the ongoing project of racism and violence through 
which generation after generation of colonialists ac-
tively perpetuated the system of low native wages. 
Much of the Critique is concemed with examining 
the diverse forms praxis can take because of the fact 
that it is always intrinsically social. Sartre develops 
a typology of different kinds of social groups, distin-
guished by the manner and extent to which they de-
flect, alienate, or even in part destroy freedom. In what 
he calls a "fused group," no loss of freedom initially 
occurs because each member experiences his or her 
aim as identica! to that of ali the others and because 
each realizes that the action of ali is needed to achieve 
it. Such groups are small, face-to-face, and sponta-
neous, and generally ari se under conditions of extreme 
threat. They are rather similar to Arendt's "islands" 
and "oases" offreedom, though Sartre's own example 
is of the crowd that spontaneously carne together and 
stormed the Bastille during the French Revolution. 
In describing the aftermath ofthis event, Sartre bril-
liantly extends the insights of Arendt, showing why 
such groups cannot endure without a deviation or a 
diminution of freedom. Having achieved their initial 
common goal, the members ofthe group face two kinds 
of pressures. One kind comes from outside: to maintain 
control ofthe Bastille, they must organize themselves. 
Some must work the guns, others must keep watch, 
arrange for food, etc. Thus a differentiation of func-
tions and the need to coordinate them starts to dilute 
their initial unity of purpose. In doing their allotted 
task, each stil! freely engages in their shared project, 
yet each also has to agree only to do certain things ~ 
to restrict his or her praxis ~for the group to continue 
its project. 
The second kind ofthreat is interna!: members might 
for various reasons want to defect, but the continued 
presence of each is a necessary condition for success. 
Interna! coercion must therefore be brought against 
members to ensure that they remain in the group. In 
responding to both externa! and interna! pressures, the 
group suffers a dispersa! of its energies, and individu-
als increasingly find their initial project coming back 
to haunt them as demands or "exigencies" that they 
had not anticipated. In more extreme forms, as groups 
become bureaucratized ~as coordination and control 
are formalized in fewer and fewer hands and in increas-
ingly rigid institutions, such as parties and structures of 
the state~ freedom seems increasingly to turn against 
itself, so that what started as "goals" end by becom-
ing "destinies": individuals stil! recognize their own 
project, but now as something other than what they 
had intended. 
Neither the work of Sartre nor that of Arendt 
and other phenomenological thinkers implies that one 
should seek wholly to replace the subject matter or 
methods of politica! science by phenomenology. For 
as Sartre shows so well, human action does indeed 
give rise to institutions and structures that ~ 
once es-
tablished ~ 
take on their own dynamics, develop their 
own objective processes. The methods of positivist so-
cial science thus continue to have their place as the 
study of such processes. But they need to be integrated 
into a wider study ~ what Sartre calls a dialectica! 
investigation ~ 
that also includes the place of human 
intentionality and freedom in the coming into being, 
perpetuation, and alteration of such processes. 
Could there be a phenomenological politica! sci-
ence? The term appears to be an oxymoron. Insofar 
as phenomenology concerns itself exclusively with the 
world as it appears to intentiona! consciousness and po-
litica! science with the world as a set ofindubitably ex-
isting real entities amenable to empirica! investigation, 
they would appear to offer incommensurable and even 
contradictory accounts ofhuman reality. However, po-
litica! science and phenomenological inquiry into po-
liticallife are perhaps best seen as two different aspects 
of what might be conceived as o ne broader and more 
synthetic investigation of politics. There could not bea 

552 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
phenomenological "politica! science," but there could 
bea study ofpolitics that would integrate the study of 
objective processes with a phenomenological exami-
nation of politica! experience and intentionality. Such 
a study would reveal the world of politics to be more 
ambiguous and less predictable, more a realm of val-
ues and freedom and less a realm offact, than politica! 
science today is willing to admit.

The German founders of pheno-
menology inspired the Portuguese phenomenological 
movement. DELFIM SANTOS, lecturer in Portuguese at 
Berlin between 193 7 and 1942, had direct contact with 
NICOLAI HARTMANN and MARTIN HEIDEGGER. The influ-
ence of contemporary German philosophy on his doc-
toral dissertation at the University of Coimbra, Con-
hecimento e realidade (Knowledge and reality, 1940), 
is striking. He considers phenomeno1ogy not merely 
one among many philosophical currents but indeed 
as the philosophy of philosophy insofar as transcen-
dental consciousness constitutes the absolute ground 
that gives significance at ali spheres ofbeing. Santos's 
understanding of phenomenology has a metaphysical 
character, a tendency that will prevail in subsequent 
Portuguese phenomenology. 
JOAQUIM DE CARVALHO, professor at Coimbra, used 
the introduction to the Portuguese translation in 
1952 of EDMUND HUSSERL 's "Philosophie als strenge 
Wissenschaft" (1911) to present a well-documented 
synopsis of Husserl's thought. From the concep-
tion of absolute truth in the Logische Untersuchun-
gen ( 1900-1901) to the theory of noesis and 
NOEMA in the Jdeen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie 
und phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 (1913), this 
thought has a unity in the idea ofphilosophy as a rigor-
ous science. This means that philosophy is, at the same 
time, a methodology and an a priori objective meta-
physics or, in other words, the pure science of essences. 
On the basis of HERMAN LEO VAN BRE DA 's article, "Les 
Archives-Husserl a Louvain" (1947), Carvalho calls 
attention to the unpublished work of Husserl, "which 
is more important than his publications," and this led to 
studies by Portuguese scholars in the Husserl Archives 
at Leuven and Koln. 
LUIS CABRAL DE MONCADA, law professor at Coim-
bra, worked under the influence of especially Husserl, 
MAX SCHELER, and Hartmann in composing Filosofia 
do direito e do estado (Philosophy of law and the 
state). Scheler's Der Formalismus in der Ethik und 
die materiale Wertethik (Formalism in ethics and non-
formal ethics ofvalue, 1913/ 1916) is cited abundantly. 
Moncada succeeds in overcoming positivism in law 
by means of the enlarged notion of experience in 
the phenomenological approach, where data are not 
restricted to spatiotemporal phenomena but include 
among other things the domain ofvalues.

The role of the Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia 
(RPF) cannot be overestimated where the diffusion of 
phenomenology in Portugal is concerned. This jour-
nal has been edited since 1945 by the Jesuit Philo-
sophical Faculty at Braga. Its second volume ( 1946) 
includes two articles on phenomenology, DIAMANTINO 
MARTIN's "Fenomenologia e Imortalidade" and SEVE-
RIANO TAVAREs's "Os arquivos de Husserl." In 1955 
JULIO FRAGATA published two articles in it, namely, "A 
fenomenologia de Husserl" and "A possibilidade da 
filosofia como ciencia rigorosa." The following year, 
two more articles appeared in RPF: "A fenomenolo-
gia" by CARLO GIACCON and "O arquivo de Husserl em 
Louvaina" by Van Breda and RUDOLF BOEHM. Numerous 
articles on phenomenology have appeared in it since 
then. 
During the late 1950s and the 1960s phenomen-
ology in Portugal showed an extraordinary develop-
ment, particularly with re gard to the study of Husserl, 
even earning a laudatory reference by HANS-GEORG 
GADAMER in the Philosophische Rundschau ( 1963) in 
an article on the phenomenological movement. To a 
great extent this is due to the group of researchers 
who organized the first Portuguese Colloquium of 
Phenomenology in November 1964 at Braga (Per-
spectivas da fenomenologia de Husserl, 1965) and 
the founding at Coimbra of the Centro de Estudos 
Fenomenol6gicos: ALEXANDRE MORUJĂO, GUSTAVO DE 
FRAGA, MANUELA SARA IVA, and JULI O FRAGATA. The three 
first mentioned belonged to the Philosophical School 
at Coimbra and the last mentioned was of the Philo-
sophical Faculty at Braga. These scholars had ali done 
research at the Husserl Archives in Koln or Leuven and 
had studied with the most illustrious phenomenologists 
ofthat period, in particular LUDWIG LANDGREBE and Van 
Breda. 
ALEXANDRE MUROJĂO is the most outstanding figure 
in the Portuguese phenomenological movement. After 
graduation in electrica! engineering from the Univer-
sity of Oporto in 1948 and in philosophy from Coim-
bra in 1954, he continued his studies in Koln with 
Landgrebe and KARL-HEINZ VOLKMANN-SCHLUCK and in 
Leuven with Van Breda. His study of Husserl focuses 
fundamentally on the concept of INTENTIONALITY. In A 
doutrina da Intencionalidade em Husserl: Das Inves-
tigac;ăes L6gicas ds Meditac;ăes Cartesianas ( 1956), 
he exhibits three different concepts of intentionality in 
Husserl: the psychic (receptive) intentionality, the tran-
scendental (understanding) intentionality, and the con-
stitutive (productive-creating) intentioJllality. Although 
these differences do not imply distinct1 intentionalities, 
they show different degrees ofintentionallife. Murojâo 
points to the ontologica! question that is raised by the 
problem of intentionality. The intentiona! abject is just 
an abject of pure logica! consistency in which any exis-
tential index is neutralized. But by leaving the ontolog-
ica! question unanswered, the very question in inten-
tionality requires deeper investigation. Morujâo 's most 
comprehensive work is Mundo e intencionalidade: En-
saio sobre o conceito de mundo na fenomenologia de 
Husserl ( 1961 ). It aims at a deepening ofthe ontologi-
ca! question that is implicit in the idea ofintentionality. 
The result is that the world as a horizon- as opposed 
to the world as "omnitudo realitas"- cannot be inte-
grated into the constitutive function of consciousness. 
It is precisely there that the deficiency of Husserlian 
phenomenology is found: it does not ontologically jus-
tify the phenomenological thesis that there is an experi-
ence of a being that is not linked to the experience ofthe 
world. Murojâo's studies of Husserl's work included 
other themes as well, such as JNTERSUBJECTIVJTY and 
HISTORY (Subjectividade e Hist6ria, 1969), but always 
with a realistic perspective on phenomenology. 
The aim of Gustavo de Fraga in Husserl e 
Heidegger: Elementos para uma problematica da 
fenomenologia (1966) is to show that Husserl's 
transcendental phenomenology was not constructed 
against metaphysics; on the contrary, the operative con-
cepts in Husserl's thought, as EUGEN FINK called them, 
include metaphysical consequences that need tobe de-
veloped. According to Fraga, the concept of intention-
ality, when viewed with respect to TEMPORALITY, is of a 
teleological nature. It is in this way that the pure atmo-
sphere of subjectivity appears in Husserl as the only 
way to reach the absolute. The apodictic evidence of 
the "1 am" is embedded in a historical movement that 
culminates in a supratemporal and transhistorical telos. 
It is precisely here that phenomenology needs theology 
and reveals that inspiration in religion. A new concept 
of intersubjectivity results from a teleological and the-
ological reading of Husserl 's transcendental idealism. 
The universal and absolute will that lives in ali tran-
scendental subjects is identified with the divine will, 
which requires the structurallayer of intersubjectivity

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
in order to concretize itself. The early philosophy of 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER~ which Jimits itse]fto the anaJytic 
ofDASEIN, and is therefore intertwined with anthropolo-
gism and historicism ~ 
thereby also limits the opening 
to the transcendentallife of consciousness, which has 
been made possible by the reduction of the factual to 
the absoluteness of the phenomenon. The metaphys-
ical dimension of Husserl's CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMEN-
OLOGY is taken up again by Fraga in the second part of 
Fenomenologia e dialectica {1972). 
Manuela Saraiva presented her Ph.D. thesis, 
L 'imagination selon Husserl, at the Catholic Univer-
sity of Louvain in 1963 and it was published in the 
Phaenomenologica series in 1970. The works of JEAN-
PAUL SARTRE on the imagination led her to investigate 
the relations between Husserl and Sartre and thereupon 
to systematize the Husserlian theory of the imaginary. 
But Sarai va 's research also attempts to clarify the link 
between this Husserlian theory and the aesthetic doc-
trines of ROMAN INGARDEN and MIKEL DUFRENNE. The 
essential results of Saraiva's systematization are that 
the imagination is an intuition, a RE-PRESENTATION, and 
a neutralization: (1) the imagination is intuitive be-
cause it visualizes the object; (2) it is a re-presentation 
in its own right that does not copy PERCEPTION and 
does not intertwine itself with it; and (3) it is a neu-
tralization in the sense of a passage to an irreality 
and in this way it makes free imagination and also 
aesthetic consciousness possible. Saraiva's main ob-
jection to Husserl concerns the latter's application 
of re-presentation through similarity to aesthetic con-
sciousness. For Husserl, questions of AESTHETICS in-
volve both re-presentation and neutralization, but In-
garden, Sartre, and Dufrenne al! reject the idea of re-
presentation and maintain merely that of neutraliza-
tion. In !ater work Saraiva has been concerned with 
the relations between philosophy, LITERATURE, and rsv-
CHOANALYSIS. See in particular the articles "Filosofia 
e psicanalise" in RPF ( 1978) and "Sartre e o mito do 
her6i" in RPF ( 1982). 
Julio Fragata attempts both a global interpretation 
of Husserl's pheomonology and, at the same time, an 
analysis of partial aspects of it. In A fenomenologia 
de Husserl coma fundamenta da filosofia ( 1959), he 
presents Husserlian phenomenology as a knowledge 
with a radical foundation in which there is a total 
absence of presuppositions and in which the things 
are data in themselves for an authentic intuitive EVI-
DENCE. However, Fragata's overall positive assessment 
of Husserl 's work does not prevent him from objecting 
precisely to Husserl 's lack of radicalism in his total ap-
proach to being, namely in its ontologica! dimension. 
By not going into this question, Husserl did not avoid 
the "enigma of transcendence" and did not provide a 
solution to it. In searching for a solution beyond re-
alism and idealism, Husserl was eventually overcome 
by idealistic prejudices that led him to betray his own 
demand for radicalism. Attention must be drawn to the 
last three studies in Problemas da fenomenologia de 
Husserl ( 1962), which is mainly a collection of Fra-
gata's articles in the RPF, namely, "Metafisica Husser-
liana e metafisica Tomista," "O Problema de Deus 
na fenomenologia de Husserl," and "Fenomenologia 
e problema critica." 
In "O pensamento Filos6fico de Julio Fragata" 
( 1986 in an issue of RPF devoted to Fragata), Alexan-
dre Murojâo concisely expounds the position of Fra-
gata vis-a-vis Husserl. Fragata contests the idealism of 
transcendental phenomenology, which he considers a 
methodological idealism that ends in an idealization. 
From Husserl's phenomenology the demand is obvi-
ous for a natural though intimately reflective attitude 
as the fundamental beginning of a knowledge or, in 
other words, the demand for a transcendent world. 
Although the reception of the work of Martin Hei-
degger was not comparable to that of Husserl, his in-
fluence was important in the Portuguese philosophical 
panorama, both directly and through French EXISTEN-
TIAL PHENOMENOLOGY. De!fim Santos published "Hei-
degger e Holderlin" in 1939 and "Filosofia como on-
tologia fundamental," where he presents the existential 
analysis of Heidegger, in 1955. Also Gustavo de Fraga 
approaches the themes ofthe Kehre, ontology, and the 
links of the philosopher with National Socialism and 
Catholicism in a small work entitled Sobre Heidegger 
( 1965). But it is especial!y CELESTINO PIRES and JOSE 
ENES who have occupied themselves most intensely 
with Heidegger's work. The first mentioned published 
various articles in the RPF: "Heidegger e o ser como 
hist6ria" (1963), "Da fenomenologia a verdade: Um 
caminho de Martin Heidegger" ( 1966), "Deus e teolo-
gia em Martin Heidegger" ( 1970). For his part, Enes, 
although not treating the work of Heidegger directly, 
represents the hermeneutica! dimension of Heidegger 's

philosophy in the best way in A Porta do Ser: Ensaio 
sobre ajustţficar,;iio noetica do juizo de percepr,;iio ex-
terna em S. Tomas de Aquino (At the gates of being: 
Essay on the noetic justification of the judgment of 
externa! perception in Aquinas, 1969) and Linguagem 
e ser (1983). He considers HERMENEUTICS as the in-
evitable method for ontologica! discourse today. On-
tologica! discourse, worked out philosophically, is a 
metalanguage of pre-predicative ontologica! experi-
ence significant for ali discourse that human beings 
have when living their existence. 
It is most of ali the French existentialism, mainly the 
thought of Jean-Paul Sartre, that was the most widely 
read in Portugal, especially in extra-academic circles, 
LITERATURE in particular. VIRGILIO FERREIRA Stands OUt 
here. From his first novels, among which Aparir,;iw 
( 1959) and Cantico Final ( 1960) are the most notewor-
thy, the crucial themes of existentialism ari se: the ab-
surdity of existence, li mit moments ofthe alarming and 
lucid discovery of death; the inhospitality ofbeing-in-
the-world, where people find themselves alone, though 
free, vis-a-vis the absurd; and anxiety. In a brilliant 
and extensive essay, "Da fenomenologia a Sartre," 
which he used to introduce his translation of Sartre's 
L 'existentialisme est un humanisme (1 946), Ferreira 
traces the road from Husserlian phenomenology to the 
existential philosophy of Sartre and provides a theoret-
ical and critica! reflection ofthe foundations ofSartre's 
position. 
CurrentJy, HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY is cen-
tral in Portugal. In Fenomenologica e hermeneutica. 
A relar,;iw entre as _filosofias de Husserl e Heideg-
ger (1992), JOĂO PAISANA treats the relation between 
Husserl's and Heidegger's phenomenologies precisely 
on the basis ofthe structures of interpretation. Paisana 
characterizes Husserl 's phenomenology as a reflective-
explicative phenomenology, which, in the Cartesian 
tradition, regards being as an object-being. This means 
that priority will be given to predicative logic. Heideg-
gerian phenomenology, however, is a hermeneutica! 
phenomenology, pre-objective and pre-predictative. 
The main concern ofthis phenomenology is the discov-
ery of the hermeneutic structures of Dasein, structures 
that establish ali the apodictic activity ofknowledge. 
MICHEL RENAUD and MANUEL SUMARES have been es-
pecially interested in French phenomenology, in par-
ticular in the work of PAUL RICCEUR. Among Renaud's 
various studies ofRica.:ur and his hermeneutics, special 
emphasis should be given to "Fenomenologia e her-
meneutica. O projecto filosofico de Paul Rica.:ur," pre-
sented at the Second Portuguese Colloquium on Pheno-
menology (RPF, 1985). He views Rica.:ur's philosoph-
ical project as a disagreeing agreement or, in other 
words, as an agreement ofthe most radically disagree-
ing intellectual, scientific, and philosophical opposi-
tions. Hermeneutics provides Rica.:ur with the possi-
bility of extending the Husserlian analysis to the most 
diverse fields of philosophy and science. 
In Para ali!m da necessidade: O sujeito ea cultura 
na .filosofia de Paul Ric(Eur ( 1987), Manuel Sumares 
shows that there is a practica! dimension to Rica.:ur's 
attempt to overcome the alienation of immediate con-
sciousness, a practica! dimension that would be a cre-
ative poiesis allowing new ways of relating to things, 
outselves, and others. Rica.:ur places this poiesis in the 
intersubjective experience of language, communica-
tion, and history. 
To close, it may be said that Portuguese pheno-
menological studies will continue. The thematic is-
sues of Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia on Edmund 
Husserl (1988), Martin Heidegger (1 989), GABRIEL 
MARCEL ( 1989), Paul Rica.:ur ( 1990), and EMMANUEL 
LEVINAS ( 1991) are proof of this.

POSSIBLE WORLDS 
Phenomenology as a 
science of essences is concerned with pure possibili-
ties rather than with what is merely actual. "To each 
essence," writes EDMUND HUSSERL in Ideen zu einer 
reinen Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen 
Philosophie 1 ( 1913 ), "there corresponds a series of 
possible individuals as its factual instancing." In this 
sense, an essence is a pure possibility and is appre-
hended through an act of phantasy that imagines pos-
sible variations upon a given or imagined particular 
case, i.e., by EIDETIC METHOD. If a world consists only of 
real, determinate individuals, and since not ali concrete

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
essences- i.e., essences that by themselves, without 
further supplementation, can be realized in individuals 
-are in fact instantiated, there are more possible indi-
viduals than are real and actual, and so more possible 
worlds than the actual. Thus Husserlian phenomen-
ology, since its inception, stands in close proximity to 
the Leibnizian thesis that the actual world is only one 
ofmany possible worlds. 
It is, however, only in more recent times that system-
atic attempts have been made to understand Husserl's 
thinking from the perspective of what has come to 
be calied "possible-worlds semantics." In the classical 
Fregean semantics, expressions in intensional contexts 
refer to their customary MEANINGS. Thus "p" in "Bob 
believes that p" does not refer to its truth-value (as 
it does ordinarily, according to GOTTLOB FREGE), but 
rather refers to its own sense, i.e., to the thought that 
p. By this theory of indirect reference, Frege is able to 
find solutions to the problem ofthe apparent failure of 
identity for singular terms in act-contexts as weli as to 
the problem of the failure of substitutivity, in belief-
contexts, of sentences with the same truth-value. It also 
has an explanation ofwhy existential generalization of 
terms in act-contexts seems to fail. But the Fregean 
theory has to admit such abstract entities as senses and 
thoughts into its ontology, and it does not aliow, in 
act-context, de re sentences, sentences that are about 
concrete, particular objects: ali our beliefs are, on this 
theory, about abstract entities such as thoughts. 
Possible-worlds semantics finds a way out of this 
impasse. A possible-worlds theory of meaning was 
first proposed by Rudolf Camap in 1955. According 
to this theory, meaning is understood as a set-theoretic 
function that is a set of ordered pairs, each pair consist-
ing of a (possible) world and the individual to which 
the term would refer in that world. Meanings are thus 
functions ofpossible worlds. 
In order to interpret the Husserlian theory of mean-
ings in light of possible-worlds semantics, it is neces-
sary to ask if the Husserlian conception of meaning as 
an ideal entity, and the overali thesis of INTENTIONAL-
ITY, can be preserved and brought in accordance with 
that semantic theory. The first attempt in this direction 
was made by JAAKKO HINTIKKA in 1969 and 1975, but 
the realiy fuli-fledged work on this topic is stili DAVID 
SMITH and RONALD MCINTYRE'S Husserl and fntentiona/-
ity ( 1982). 
Hintikka 's theory is based on the assumption that 
ascribing a propositional attitude to a person ("S be-
lieves that p") involves dividing ali possible worlds into 
two classes: those possible worlds that are compatible 
with that attitude and those that are incompatible with 
it. "S believes that p" is then equivalent to "in ali the 
possible worlds compatible with what S believes, it is 
the case that p." Belief- in general, intentionality-
on Hintikka's theory is not, as it is in Frege's, a rela-
tion to an abstract entity such as a thought, but rather 
a relation to a set of possible worlds. Hintikka not 
only develops such a Carnapian theory, but interprets 
Husserl 's intentionality in the language of this theory, 
denying the need for abstract entities calied meanings, 
and admitting only a theory of reference, i.e., refer-
ence in many possible worlds. A belief is de re when 
the meaning-function-"in this case, an individuating 
function, corresponding to Carnap 's individual con-
cepts"- assigns the same individual to every relevant 
world. Although thus getting rid of Husserlian mean-
ings, Hintikka claims to ha ve recovered the Husserlian 
thesis that the identity ofindividuals is "constituted" by 
the individuating function ranging over many possible 
worlds. 
Two objections were raised against such a theory 
of intentionality by J. N. MOHANTY in 1981. In the first 
place, the theory reduces meanings ( or Husserlian NOE-
MATA) to sets of ordered pairs extensionaliy conceived. 
Second, the theory makes use of a naive ontology of 
possible worlds, and does not ask about their consti-
tution. Both of these objections ha ve been taken into 
account in later papers by Hintikka and others. First 
of ali, Smith and Mcintyre have proposed retaining 
the Fregean sense along with a possible-worlds the-
ory; second, Hintikka (along with CHARLES HARVEY) 
has made room for a theory of constitution of possi-
ble worlds. The former proposal refuses to identify ( or 
even define) the meanings in terms of extensionaliy 
conceived sets, but recognizes the value of explicat-
ing the former in terms ofthe latter; it also recognizes 
that a theory ofmeaning as belonging to philosophy of 
language and theory of intentionality goes beyond the 
needs of a semantic theory. Smith and Mcintyre also 
recognize that Husserl 's theory of intentionality admits 
of a version that does not assume possible entities, i.e., 
an actualist version. The real issue, however, is not 
which version to choose, but how the actual (the act) 

POSSIBLE WORLDS 
557 
and the possible are interrelated. 
In 1981, Hintikka recognized that meaning-
functions as set-theoretic entities are not adequate ex-
plications of Husserlian intentionality. What is needed 
is to develop suitable operationalizations ("recipes" or 
"algorithms") that would answer the question ofhow it 
is that the object of an act ( or the reference of a linguis-
tic expression) is determined in each possible world. 
But is not the use of"possible world" likely tobe a sort 
of naive ontology? Hintikka and Harvey ha ve sought 
to take this criticism into account, and make use of 
Husserl's account of"modalization" in Erfahrung und 
Urteil ( 1939), fruitfully supplementing the account of 
"modalization" to be found in contemporary logica) 
theory. The former account begins with "motivated" 
possibilities, and needs to be able to construct logica) 
( or rather "free") possibilities. The latter begins with 
"free" (and so unlimited) possibilities, and so needs 
to be able to develop a principle by which these un-
limited possibilities may be limited only to those that 
are grasped in understanding the meaning of an ex-
pression (for we cannot be said to grasp the unlimited 
possibilities). This last point shows that a possible-
worlds semantics cannot be an analysis of the actual 
phenomenological content of consciousness, although 
the latter would show that possibilities (as contained in 
the horizon) are involved in one's actual understand-
ing. 
How is a possible world constituted? Starting with 
a "home world" and a "principle of production," one 
can follow Husserl in using disjunction and negation 
to generate possibilities and eventually, by an act of 
reflective reification, to constitute pure possibilities. 
Thus a possible-worlds semantics stands in need of 
a constitutive grounding in intentiona! consciousness. 
One also cannot but ask, with THOMAS M. SEEBOHM in 
1988, what has happened to the concept of "world"? 
The real world is "open": it is not determined whether 
a sea battle will be fought tomorrow. But a possible 
world, if understood as a maximally consistent set of 
statements, is an ideal entity. In Leibnizian thinking, 
God's infinite intellect was the original home of al! pos-
sible worlds. Shom of this topos, the possible worlds 
could only be "fictional variants" of the real world, 
constituted by a finite intellect. The thesis of al! pos-
sible worlds, as also of a possible world in its totality, 
is a thesis from God's point of view. Nothing in ex-
perience warrants this totalization. As Husserl writes 
in Cartesianische Meditationen [ 1931 ], "a world itself 
is an infinite idea, related in infinities ofharmoniously 
combinable experiences- an idea that is the correlate 
of the idea of a perfect experiential evidence." It is in 
view of these problems that Hintikka admits that "we 
cannot even hope to operate actually with any possible 
world as a completed whole. The best we can hope to 
do is to deal with parts or partial specifications ofpossi-
ble worlds." And as he also notes, "possible worlds ... 
are never present to one's mind individually, one by 
one, but always come to us in bunches." 
Ali this hangs together closely with the phenomen-
ological theory ofthe horizon ofthe intentiona) act.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
POST-MODERNISM 
"Post-" paradigms dom-
inate the inteliectual landscape of the contemporary 
academy everywhere. They are multiple and sprawl-
ing rhizomaticaliy: post-modern, post-structuralist, 
post-metaphysical, post-Western, post-Marxist, post-
colonial, even post-philosophical, and now inevitably 
post-phenomenological. Although they are ali imbri-
cated, postmodernism is the paramount "post-ism" of 
ali. The prominent Italian postmodern thinker GIANNI 
VATTIMO is almost ready to distance himself from it 
because it has become, he fears, an inteliectual fad. 
Phenomenology, too, is a philosophical movement. 
As a movement, it is neither a school of thought nor 
a fixed set of dogmas: it is never stagnant but al-
ways dynamic. Its vitality is preserved in its capac-
ity to transform itself. As a perpetua! beginner, the 
phenomenologist is one who maintains, according to 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, the constant vigiJance that 
would not Jet us forget the source of ali knowledge: 
the end of phenomenology is the account of its begin-
ning. From EDMUND HUSSERL to MARTIN HEIDEGGER, JEAN-
PAUL SARTRE, SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, ALFRED SCHUTZ, HANS-
GEORG GADAMER, PAUL RIC<EUR, EMMANUEL LEVINAS, and 
JACQUES DERRIDA, phenomenology has gone through 
REALISTIC, CONSTITUTIVE, EXISTENTIAL, HERMENEU-
TICAL , and perhaps, deconstructive phases covering 
a vast array of themes such as AESTHETICS, ECOLOGY, 
ETHICS, FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY, HISTORY, LANGUAGE, 
NATURAL and HUMAN SCIENCES, RELIGION, POLITICS, SO-
CIOLOGY, and TECHNOLOGY. 
Phenomenology is not of but in postmodernity. 
Phenomenology and postmodernism are directly in-
tersected by JEAN-FRAN<;'OIS LYOTARD'S two works: La 
phenonu!nologie ( 1954 ), which went through its tenth 
edition in 1986, and La condition postmoderne ( 1979), 
which defined postmodernism as a philosophy. The 
first work is a critica] account of phenomenology based 
primarily on Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-
Ponty. It has been called a "phenomenology ofpheno-
menology," an expression familiar from Husserl and 
Merleau-Ponty. The latter work sketches postmodern 
knowledge in bold and broad strokes. "Postmodern 
knowledge is not simply a tool of authorities; it refines 
our sensitivity to differences and reinforces our ability 
to tolerate the incommensurable. Its principle is not 
the expert's homology, but the inventor's paralogy." 
Merleau-Ponty was also suspicious, from the start, of 
any attempt of phenomenology to provide an apodictic 
foundation of knowledge and was ready to recognize 
ambiguity as endemic to the order of things and its 
multiple dimensions. He found phenomenology, in the 
!ater Husserl, functioning not as a "rigorous science" 
but as a "pure interrogation." 
JACQUES DERRIDA 's deconstructionism is both a post-
modern affair and the latest phase in the movement of 
phenomenology as a philosophy. In part it is a criti-
que of Husserl 's privileging of speech over writing, as 
phonocentrism. It may be said, nevertheless, that Der-
rida's technique of destabilizing the established regime 
of knowledge is not entirely new. Husserl 's critique 
in Die Krisis der europăischen Wissenschaften und 
die transzendentale Phiinomenologie ( 1936) of mod-
ern scientism as based on the Galilean mathematiza-
tion ofnature that takes the LIFEWORLD as the sociocul-
tural infrastructure of science for granted is in itself an 
exemplary exercise in deconstruction. In Die Grund-
probleme der Phănomenologie [1927], Heidegger, for 
whom questioning is the "piety ofthinking," used the 
expression Destruktion, which is as basic as reduc-
tion and construction to phenomenological ontology 
and has been translated into French as deconstruction. 
He not only deconstructed modern philosophy from 
Descartes to Nietzsche as "humanism," but also mod-
ern "technologism" as Gestell (enframing). For many 
commentators in the phenomenological tradition, the 
lasting legacy of Heidegger's thought resides in his 
claim that technology, which includes media technol-
ogy and cybernation, has become one-dimensional, 
autonomous, planetary, hyperreal, and above ali ho-
mogenizing, i.e., a "modernization" that is a planetary 
homogenization. If a postmodern society is a society 
of the mass media and what makes postmodern soci-
ety "transparent" is mass communication or "telemat-
ics," then Heidegger's deconstruction oftechnology as 
Gestell is indeed far ahead of the postmodern condi-
tion. 
Postmodernity is a constellation of many different 
and colorful ideas. The conceptual world it fosters is a 
"rhizomatic" assemblage of such notions as connect-
edness (interbeing or intertextuality), multiplicity, het-
erogeneity, alterity, and marginality. By nature the rhi-
zome has the characteristic of lateral, subterranean, 
and profuse growth with neither beginning nor ending. 
"Interbeing" or "intertwining" cherishes the transver-

POST-MODERNISM

sai movement of the rhizome. Except for difference, 
which is opposed to both separatism and inferiority, 
there would be neither relation nor multiplicity. With-
out difference, there would be no need to speak of 
interbeing. To put it in a nutshell, difference is the ax-
ia! principium of postmodernity. What identity is to 
modernity, difference is to postmodernity. It is the no-
tion of difference that makes ali the difference between 
modernity and postmodernity. Lyotard's postmodern 
condition demands a discernment of and to differ-
ences. To play on the titles of Vattimo's two works: 
at the "end of modernity" !ies the "adventure of differ-
ence," which again is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's 
critique ofthe dialectics in HEGEL and MARXISM for the 
sake of MAX WEBER 's appreciation of the plurality and 
ambiguity ( Vielseitigkeit) of historical facts. No won-
der there is a proliferation of the ideas of difference 
in postmodern thought: among the most prominent 
are Heidegger's Differenz as Unterschied, Derrida's 
differance, Lyotard's differend, Levinas's heteronomy, 
Michel de Certeau's heterology, and Mikhail Bakhtin's 
heteroglossia. 
Let us compare the "modernist" Hegel and the 
"postmodernist" Heidegger on the question ofthe dif-
ference bctween identity and difference. In his eager-
ness to prove the teleology of history as the march 
of Reason, of world history or the end of historical 
progress, Hegel falls short of making the dialectic 
open-endcd. After history's final synthesis or, as Mark 
C. Taylor puts it, the identity ofidentity and difference 
that coincides with the coming ofthe State, his dialec-
tic reaches or fulfills the "end of history." In the end, 
the State fulfills and totalizes the end of history. Vat-
timo concludes, therefore, that the Hegelian dialectic 
consummates the long metaphysical tradition of iden-
tity in Western philosophy. The modernist Marx only 
inverted the Hegelian dialectic by making it stand on 
its feet (materiality) rather than on its head (spiritual-
ity). For Marx, the end of history is not the State but, 
some say, anarchism. 
Contrariwise, Heidegger 's Dif.ferenz as Unterschied 
offers a postmodern alternative to the cultural politics 
ofidentity. Unterschied doubles difference with the be-
tween ( Unterlschied) that at once connects, preserves, 
and promotes difference and the relational (i.e., inter-
being). Difference as dif/ference is capable of conserv-
ing the principle ofcomplementarity (and reversibility) 
that refutes the Hegelian and Marxian principle of op-
positionality as the driving force ofhistory. 
Without differencc, there would be no reciprocity, 
no reciprocity between the I (ipseity) and the Other 
(alterity). Alterity is the name given to the otherness 
of the Other in interhuman relationships. In order to 
emphasize the importance of alterity in such relation-
ships, in the ethical, it might very well be spelled "altar-
ity," which is the neologism of Mark C. Taylor. What 
differance is to Derrida, altarity (alterity) is to Tay-
lor. The term altar comes from the Latin altere, which 
signifies "a high place." Thus the idea of"altarity" el-
evates the world ofthe Other and makes the reading of 
it an elevated text. The birth of heterocentricity is the 
elevation ofthe Other to "altarity." 
After the Copernican discovery of a "Thou" by Lud-
wig F euerbach in the 19th century, there is no other 
philosopher who celebrates heterocentricity more seri-
ously than Levi nas, who introduced Husserl 's pheno-
menology to the French intellectual world. Levinas is 
the ethical thinker par excellence because his philos-
ophy is not only a single-minded elaboration of the 
ethical, but also a culmination of the ethical based on 
heterocentricity. 
Only by way of heterocentricity is an ethics possi-
ble in which the Other is not only not an alter ego but 
is more primary than the self. In the ethics of "altar-
ity," responsibility precedes freedom, for the former is 
other-directed while the latter is self-centered or ego-
centric. The ethical is the conception ofthe selfwhose 
center is "elsewhere" and "otherwise": the only ethical 
self is a "responsible self." Levinas calls this concep-
tion of the ethical "meontology." From the standpoint 
ofhis heteronomy or meontology, the very idea of exis-
tence ( ex/istence) has been profoundly misunderstood 
among its antagonists as well as its protagonists: as its 
etymology shows, what is really central to it is not the 
centrality but the eccentricity (ex-centricity) ofthe self 
toward the world of other people (Mitwe/t) and other 
things ( Umwelt). The human as eccentric is a being 
who is exposed to and outreaches the outside world 
or what Levinas calls "exteriority." Thus the motto of 
existence must be: Do not go inside, go outside! Be 
an ethical agent first, not an epistemological subject. 
The authenticity of existence is guaranteed not by ego-
centricity, but only by heterocentricity or dialogue of 
eccentric agents. It is found not "in here" but "out 

560 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
there," not in"( en)closure" but in "disclosure." 
FEMINISM, Luce Irigaray insists, is the issue of our 
epoch. It represents asea change. Ecriture feminine ( or 
parler-femme) engenders, incorporates, and embodies 
what is principally postmodern. In many respects, it is 
the standard-bearer or exemplar of postmodernism. It 
not only serves as Ariadne's thread to postmodernism, 
but is also the joyful and even prophetic voice of Or-
pheus welcoming the dawn of a new world rather than 
the owl of Minerva that takes ftight only at dusk. In 
sum: the deconstructive endeavor of ecriture feminine 
both destroys a "real" world and constructs a "possible" 
one. Judith Butler considers feminism, as a philosophy 
of sexual difference, the "subversion of identity." Iri-
garay contends that Hegel was "obliged to detine man 
and woman as opposed and not as different." There is 
indeed the difference between un and une philosophe, 
between a male and a female philosopher. Sexual dif-
ference has become paradigmatic to feminists, and fe-
male emancipation -
upon which the emancipation 
of the whole of humanity may depend- is the cele-
bration of sexual difference itself. As the subversion 
of identity, the feminist philosophy of sexual differ-
ence argues against what Fran<;oise Collin considers 
"phallic monism" and "homogenizing equality," that 
is, a "one-sex model" in which man is the measure of 
ali things and woman does not exist or does not ex-
ist as an ontologically distinct category -
in which 
woman does not exist independently of or differently 
from man. Sexual difference is a substrate of alterity,' 
but this feminine substrate is not just a "fig leaf' hiding 
difference. 
The theory of human nature (as universal) has 
marginalized the feminine and feminine difference in 
that it regards woman not so much as different from 
man, but rather as less than man. According to the the-
ory ofhuman nature, what is particular in woman is al-
ways particular and what is particular in man is readily 
universalizable. Herein !ies the inftuence ofBeauvoir's 
Le deuxieme sexe ( 1949) on the social and cultural con-
structivist view of femininity: gender is made, it is a 
factum, that is, one is not horn but becomes a woman. 
It is the "morphology" rather than the anatomy of the 
body, Irigaray insists, that has marginalized and disem-
powered woman. The universalizing or essentializing 
theory ofhuman nature independent of cu !ture and his-
tory is a fiction or chimera. 
The feminist philosophy ofthe BODY or what Eliz-
abeth Grosz calls "corporeal feminism" has created 
multiple waves and ripples on philosophical think-
ing today. Chantal Chawaf says: "lt's a privilege to-
day to be a woman." Feminism as a philosophy of 
the ftesh exemplifies a postmodern concern to unearth 
and transverse not only the modernist dualism ofmind 
and body, but also a host of other issues. The Carte-
sian cogito is the epistemological principle founded 
on the mind as purely disembodied or incorporeal rea-
son (res cogitans, "thinking thing") in separation from 
and alienation to the body as a part of nature (res ex-
tensa, "extended thing"). In the cogito, disembodied 
logocentrism and mental interiority are sealed offfrom 
corporeal exteriority. 
The primacy ofbody over mind is the invention of 
Nietzsche, who has pervasive inftuence on postmodern 
thought: the human is solely body, and soul is only 
another name for something about the body, an idea 
that is deeply rooted in Vico and Spinoza. According to 
ERWIN w. STRAUS, the body is the root of sociogeny. Only 
because of our body are we said tobe social: tobe social 
is first and foremost to be intercorporeal. Only by way 
ofthe body are we made visible. In contrast, the mind is 
related only to one body; it is directly related to neither 
other minds nor other bodies. The mind becomes a 
relatum only because the body populates a world with 
other bodies. 
The body is the ftesh that is a living subject capa-
ble of authoring the world before merely responding 
to it. The return of subjectivity in corporeal feminism 
signals the reinsertion of subjectivity in philosophical 
discourse. STRUCTURALISM challenged phenomenology 
as a philosophy of consciousness, of subjectivity, of 
intentionality, and spoke of the "death of man," of 
"man" as a living subject. Some phenomenologists 
acknowledge the "twilight" zone of subjectivity and 
reconceive subjectivity as decentered. It is notewor-
thy that in Der philosophische Diskurs der Moderne 
( 1985), Jilrgen Habermas-the staunchest defender of 
modernity as an unfinished project-also criticizes the 
subject-centered rationality ofphenomenology, includ-
ing Merleau-Ponty's subjectivity finding itselfcentered 
in its body. Habermas, however, is unaware ofthe fact 
that reason defined as communicative action requires 
the body as its root. The philosophy of communicative 
action defined in terms of mind as the site of reason 

POST-MODERNISM 
561 
and body as the site ofunreason is self-defeating. If, as 
MICHEL FOUCAULT asserts, power and resistance are in-
separable twins or "compatriots," feminism as a theory 
of resistance to and subversion of the status quo is in 
need of affirming a subject that is capable of activating 
or instituting transformation. 
Corporeal feminism celebrates and valorizes the 
body as the site ofjouissance (carnal enjoyment). The 
French expressionjouissance is what makes the fem-
inine "calendar of the flesh," which is consonant with 
the cyclical rhythm ofnature. It is uniquely a feminine 
construction. Jouissance may be said tobe the Nirvana 
principle of femininity and the principium of corpo-
real feminism. Since it empowers the feminine, it is 
also feminine puissance. Incorporating the "fertility of 
the body" in our thinking and doing, it denounces the 
false dichotomy between the mind (con/ception) and 
the body (per/ception) as a "patriarchal bifurcation." 
As the conceptual or morphologicallocus of feminine 
difference,jouissance is not singular and oppositional 
but multiple and complementary. 
The most interesting aspect of jouissance is the 
homonymous play on the sound ofthe word as "j'oui's 
sens," which means "I hear meaning" and which is 
intended to subvert the way of privileging masculine 
ocularcentrism, of the ocularcentric epistemology of 
the Cartesian cogito, which is in pursuit of "clear and 
distinct ideas." The subjectivity ofwomen, it has been 
emphasized, is reinserted into philosophical discourse 
as an argument against scopic phallocracy, i.e., against 
the objectifying look ofmen.ln sum,jouissance auscul-
tates the valorizing voi ce of feminine difference with-
out losing subjectivity at the edge of objectivity. It is 
an epochal attempt to overcome and defenestrate phal-
locracy. 
Touch or caress, like hearing, is the sense of prox-
imity, while vi sion is the sense of distance. Influenced 
by Levinas's ethics of proximity, of the face-to-face, 
Irigaray claims that the eye or look privileges the mas-
culine and that investment in vision at the expense 
of the other senses impoverishes the body's material-
ity and corporeal relations. While "spectatorial" vision 
glorifies the masculine, the "participatory" sense of 
touch valorizes the feminine. To feminize body poli-
tics (the plural ofthe body politic) is therefore to accent 
the senses of proximity (hearing, touching, and tasting) 
and to decenter or de-panopticize the haunting specter 
of vision in our thinking and doing. 
The feminine way embodies the communal sense of 
intimacy by way oftouch, contact, proximity, face-to-
face consociation, and "soft" knowledge. Based on the 
sense of proximity, particularly of touch, the ethics of 
care is uniquely a feminine ethics. Joan Tronto holds 
that what masculine identity is to justice, feminine dif-
ference is to care. In the tradition ofphenomenological 
philosophizing, it is Heidegger who defines DASEIN as 
care (Sorge, cura), in his epochal work Sein und Zeit 
(1927). Based on the Latin fable ofHyginus, Dasein is 
inspirited with care with its body (corpus) as the gift 
of earth (tellus, humus). 
The feminine ethics of care in the United States 
has surged ahead with Carol Gilligan 's discerning cri-
tique of the gender-biased psychology of Lawrence 
Kohlberg on the stages of moral development. When 
the ethics of care is engendered and monitored by femi-
nine difference, it takes on a radically new countenance 
or gives birth to a new, postmodern ethics. It sub-
verts the modernist ethics based on individual rights 
and transmutes it into a postmodern ethics based on 
responsibility. The ethics of care interrupts and trans-
forms egocentricity into heterocentricity, self-absorbed 
"taking" into other-directed "giving" that is the moral 
locus of care. It calls for the sacrifice ofthe self for the 
Other (i.e., self-transcendence). It is indeed a Coper-
nican revolution in moral thinking. There has been 
no philosopher who was more emphatic than Levinas 
about the inseparability of ethics, heteronomy, and re-
sponsibility. Ethics is for him primary, and everything 
else begins as ethics. Because of this primacy of the 
ethical, subjectivity is for Levinas asserted never for it-
self, but only for another (pour l 'autre).ln other words, 
subjectivity ( or ipseity) comes into ( ethical) being as 
heteronomic: it is my non-transferable answerability 
or responsibility to the Other (l'autrui) that makes the 
individual an authentic and unique subject. Only be-
cause subjectivity is described in heteronomic, ethical 
terms is responsibility understood as the fundamen-
tal structure of subjectivity: I am who I am because 
1 am responsible for others. Although responsibility 
without autonomy or freedom is a sham, autonomy 
is ancillary but not contrary to responsibility simply 
because we can be autonomous without being respon-
sible, but we can never be responsible without first 
being autonomous.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
By way of conclusion, it is worth noting that CAL VIN 
o. SCHRAG has recently developed the idea oftransver-
sality to structure connections in the face of the dif-
ference between modernist identity and postmodernist 
difference. Transversality is the new hinge that al-
lows philosophizing to swing across both disciplinary 
boundaries and cultural borders.lt is a way ofweaving 
different texts, of composing intertexts. By transmuting 
universality into transversality, he opens up a new hori-
zon in order to deconstruct what might be called mod-
ern man 's white mythology, which has masgueraded as 
Eurocentrism, sexism, and even speciesism. Inspired 
by the philosophical insights ofMerleau-Ponty, Sartre, 
Foucault, Lyotard, and Gilles Deleuze and Felix Ouat-
tari, Schrag favors and argues for "the transversal logos 
of communicative rationality" by refuting the "univer-
sal logos of logocentrism." Transversality promotes 
dialogical enrichment across differences and embraces 
the conception of truth as the way of communicabil-
ity. It intends to circumvent the modern hegemony of 
identity on the one hand and the postmodern anarchy 
ofmultiplicity on the other. It administers, as it were, a 
double-edgedpharmakon to both modernity and post-
modernity. By splitting the difference between them, 
i.e., by maximizing the advantages and minimizing the 
disadvantages, Schrag indeed advances the cause of 
phenomenology as a philosophical movement.

PSYCHIATRY 
Modern psychiatry, as rep-
resented by Emil Kraeplin (1856-1926), and pheno-
menology, as developed by EDMUND HUSSERL, began 
around the same time, namely, during the last decades 
of the 19th century. Moreover, psychiatry and pheno-
menology have always shared a common goal: they 
have both sought detailed descriptions ofhuman expe-
rience. This communality of goals has repeatedly led 
psychiatrists to turn to phenomenology for aid in expli-
cating mentallife. For many psychiatrists it has seemed 
that phenomenology offered a method that could help 
them better understand and conceptualize the experi-
ences of their patients. As a re suit, psychiatrists ha ve

PSYCHIATRY

utilized various phenomenological approaches just as 
phenomenologists have explored subjects in psychia-
try. 
The history of this relationship has remained am-
biguous, however. Frequently a gap has yawned be-
tween the broad theoretical perspectives adapted from 
phenomenology and the needs of clinica! practice. Fur-
thermore, psychiatrists -
who are often trained in 
the biologica! and natural sciences -
may feei dis-
inclined to delve deeply into explorations of the sub-
jective when these explorations appear to them to re-
main too abstract or metaphysical. And, returning the 
compliment, phenomenologists have usually exhibited 
a profound reluctance to ascribe centrality to biological 
and naturalistic perspectives. In the post-World War II 
years, impressive progress in empirica! research has 
provided physicians with powerful means for diag-
nosis and treatment, for example, with psychopharma-
cology; because psychiatrists are always pragmatists at 
heart, these new means ha ve tended to supplant pheno-
menological insights. 
More recently, the relationship has grown more 
complicated, and these complexities offer hope of a 
revitalized cross-fertilization between psychiatry and 
phenomenology. On the one hand, empirica! research 
in psychiatry continues at an even more rapid pace. 
On the other hand, many physicians and patients are 
more aware ofthe gaps, inadequacies, and even unto-
ward consequences ofthe one-sidedness ofthese new 
developments. This has spurred a turn toward holistic 
medici ne, wellness, and environmental medicine that is 
more congenial to phenomenological views. Moreover, 
there is a growing recognition that phenomenological 
and neurobiological perspectives can no Ion ger oppose 
one another. Indeed, it is becoming apparent that these 
two perspectives require one another; when properly 
conceived, each will strengthen the other. We shall 
first sketch a briefhistory ofthe relationships between 
phenomenology and psychiatry. Subsequently, we shall 
delineate possible directions that future inquiry might 
take. 
The main value of phenomenology for psychiatry 
has historically consisted in phenomenology's careful 
descriptions of the many facets of human existence. 
On the level of clinica! practice, psychiatrists who are 
schooled in phenomenology have leamed to explore 
the subtleties and nuances of their patients' experi-
ences. On the level ofresearch and theory, phenomen-
ological psychiatrists have been able to conceptualize 
invariant features of abnormal mental Iife. Moreover, 
phenomenology, because of its emphasis on the con-
crete situatedness ofpersons through embodiment, eul-
ture, and HISTORY, has made psychiatrists more aware 
ofthe complexity ofhuman existence. 
The first influence of phenomenology on psychi-
atry is found in the work of KARL JASPERS. Jaspers 
began his career as a psychiatrist, tuming to philos-
ophy only !ater. The first article indebted to pheno-
menology was concemed with morbid jealousy ( 191 0). 
His early book, Allgemeine Psychopathologie (Gen-
eral psychopathology, 1913), was decisively shaped 
by the ideas of Husserl, WILHELM DILTHEY, and MAX 
WEBER, among others. Drawing on Husserl's Logis-
che Untersuchungen (1900-190 1 ), Jaspers developed 
his own phenomenological method. This phenomen-
ology was designed to detine the basic concepts ofpsy-
chopathology, such as "delusion" and "hallucination." 
Jaspers' phenomenology resembled Husserl's in be-
ing descriptive, intuitive, and presuppositionless. But 
because psychopathology pertains to the patient's ex-
periences, Jaspers viewed understanding (Verstehen) 
and empathy (Einfiihlung) as essential components of 
the method. He did diverge from Husserl by explicitly 
rejecting EIDETIC METHOD. Jaspers saw his own pheno-
menology as empirica!. 
Jaspers' phenomenological approach influenced 
psychiatrists in what carne tobe known as the "Heidel-
berg school." This school included HANS GRUHLE, KURT 
SCHNEIDER, and WILLY MAYER-GROSS. Schneider assisted 
Jaspers with rewriting and expanding the Allgemeine 
Psychopathologie (fourth edition) during World War II. 
The fourth edition incorporated notions from Jaspers' 
philosophy of existence. 
Mayer-Gross carried the phenomenological orien-
tation to GREAT BRITAIN in 1933. His textbook, Clini-
ca/ Psychiatry (1969, 3rd edition), influenced numer-
ous British psychiatrists. By then, however, Jaspers' 
phenomenology was viewed as empirica! in contrast to 
Husserl's. Moreover, Husserl's phenomenology carne 
to be misperceived as a mere precursor to MARTIN HEI-
DEGGER's analysis of DASEIN as imported into psychi-
atry by LUDWIG BINSWANGER. Jaspers' contributions to 
psychopathology are usually regarded as definitive in 
Great Britain. Furthermore, present-day British work 

564 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
in the field tends to deny Husserl 's inftuence on Jaspers. 
Under the leadership of AUBREY LEWIS, the Mauds-
ley Hospital in London disseminated Jaspersian pheno-
menology to the English-speaking world. The Ameri-
can psychiatrist PAUL R. MCHUGH trained there. McHugh 
in collaboration with PHILLIP R. SLAVNEY has done much 
to advance Jaspersian and other facets of phenomen-
ological psychiatry in the United States. 
At the Tavistock Institute in England, R. o. LAING in-
troduced an EXISTENT!AL-PHENOMENOLOG!CAL approach 
to schizophrenia. While this approach draws on a num-
ber of existentialists, it is indebted mainly to JEAN-
PAUL SARTRE. Laing also studied interpersonal aspects 
of mental disorders. He is perhaps best known for his 
criticisms of psychiatry, especially his challenges of 
the standard sanity/madness distinction. 
In Germany and elsewhere in Continental Europe, 
other important schools of phenomenological psychi-
atry ha ve developed. The most significant figure in the 
Continental appropriation of phenomenology is prob-
ably the Swiss psychiatrist, Ludwig Binswanger. Bin-
swanger's phenomenology is nourished by his exten-
sive clinica! experience. He searched his entire life for 
a proper form of phenomenological conceptualization 
and method. First inftuenced by Husserl, Binswanger 
subsequently employed central features ofHeidegger's 
analytic of Dasein. In his last works, under the inftu-
ence of VILMOS (WILHELM) SZILASI, Binswanger again 
turned to Husserl 's ideas. 
In Switzerland the most important follower ofBin-
swanger was ROLAND KUHN. Kuhn developed a pheno-
menological conception ofthe Rorschach test. He com-
bined psychopharmacology with psychotherapy and in 
fact invented imipramine (Tofranil), which even to-
day is considered a standard drug for the treatment of 
depression. 
In Germany most ofBinswanger's students worked 
in the Department of Psychiatry at Heidelberg. HEINZ 
HĂFNER applied Binswanger 's approach to patients with 
personality disorders (such individuals are called "psy-
chopaths" in Germany) and KARL P. KISKER to patients 
with schizophrenia. HUBERTUS TELLENBACH extended 
Binswanger's concepts to the world of the melan-
cholic. Tellenbach constructed a typology of depres-
sives, focusing on pre-morbid characteristics, e.g., an 
extreme tendency toward orderliness. He inspired AL-
FRED KRAUS to study existential types and role theory. 
WOLFGANG BLANKENBURG developed a phenomenoJogi-
caJ understanding of characteristic features of chronic 
schizophrenics and described the loss of taken-for-
grantedness (Selbstverstăndlichkeit). 
Earlier in Heidelberg there were physicians in-
terested in the field of psychosomatic medicine. An 
anthropological approach was created by the in-
ternist, Viktor von Weizsăcker. Inftuenced by MAX 
SCHELER's reftections on biologica! philosophy, von 
Weizsăcker's conception of the Gestaltkreis (forma-
tive cycle) posited an interaction between perception 
and movement. Also inftuenced by Scheler was VIKTOR 
voN GEBSATTEL. Von Gebsattel developed his ideas in 
association with Binswanger, EUGENE MINKOWSKI, and 
Straus. He adopted what he called an "anthropological-
existential" framework for investigating such topics as 
the world of the compulsive, depersonalization, and 
addictions and perversions. HERBERT PLOGGE has writ-
ten a number of essays in "medical anthropology" that 
are focused on various dimensions ofhealth and illness 
and on the experiences of one 's body. 
In the last two decades, the phenomenological tra-
dition at the University ofHeidelberg has sought to in-
corporate empirica! investigations and neurobiological 
perspectives. WERNER JANZARIK has explicated a com-
prehensive "structural-dynamic" theory. This theory is 
geared to providing a holistic approach that will make 
both biologica! and psychopathological data relevant 
to practicing clinicians. CHRISTOPH MUNDT has investi-
galed severa! concepts ofrNTENTIONALITY, including the 
most recent ones, e.g., Daniel Dennett's. In both theo-
retical and empirica! studies he applies these concepts 
to schizophrenia. As the present director ofthe Psychi-
atric Clinic at the University of Heidelberg, Mundt is 
interested in revitalizing the phenomenological tradi-
tion there, but he insists on do ing so in conjunction with 
empirica! investigations of populations of patients. In 
this regard Mundt has voiced sharp criticisms of the 
"autistic" tendencies in past phenomenologies. 
J0RG ZUTT in Frankfurt has developed an "under-
standing anthropology" (verstehende Anthropologie) 
aimed at overcoming mind-body dualism. From this 
point of view he has contributed severa! insights into 
the psychopathoJogy ofthe lived BODY. GERHARD BOSCH, 
a student of Zutt's, has studied infantile autism from 
the perspective of a "phenomenological anthropology." 
He employs Husserl's analyses of intersubjectivity in 

PSYCHIATRY 
565 
order to explicate the defect involved in the autistic 
child's social encounters. 
ERWIN W. STRAUS, along with von Gebsattel, Bin-
swanger, and Zutt, founded the joumal Der Nervenarzt 
in 1930. Straus was trained as a psychiatrist and neurol-
ogist, but he also possessed a profound knowledge of 
classical authors such as Aristotle, Augustine, Goethe, 
and Shakespeare. From the University of Berlin Straus 
emigrated to the United States in 1938. He taught psy-
chology at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, 
engaged in research at Johns Hopkins University, and 
in 1946 moved to the Veterans Administration Hospi-
tal in Lexington, Kentucky. At Lexington in the 1960s, 
he helped disseminate phenomenology to Americans 
through his conferences on "Phenomenology: Pure and 
Applied." 
Straus was convinced that abnormal mental condi-
tions could be adequately understood only as deforma-
tions of normal experience. He also insisted that scien-
tific psychology, especially in its behavioristic forms, 
furnished only misconceptions of normal mental func-
tioning. These two convictions led him to undertake 
anew the study of normal experience, primarily sensory 
experience, but to undertake it in a manner different 
from that of traditional scientific psychology. Straus 
first called his own approach "anthropological" and 
!ater "phenomenological." In the area ofpsychopathol-
ogy he devoted specific studies to obsessions, compul-
sions, hallucinations, disorders of time in depressive 
states, and the pseudoreversibility of catatonic stupor. 
His broader concern, however, was the pathology of 
I-world relationships. 
Kurt Goldstein ( 1878-1965) was a biologist and 
physician who developed a GESTALTIST conception of 
the human organism. Goldstein 's inftuence on ARON 
GURWITSCH and MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY ied these two 
younger phenomenologists to investigations that bear 
on psychiatric problems. Goldstein's own descriptions 
of the breakdown of organization and the organism's 
"catastrophic" responses remain highly relevant today. 
In Dutch psychiatry the two most prominent figures 
have been H. C. RUMKE and JAN HENDRIK VAN DEN BERG. 
Rilmke has warned of the dan ger involved in the loss 
of scientific and objective criteria in phenomenologi-
cal psychiatry. Caii ing for a genuinely "scientific psy-
chology," he has studied the experiences ofhappiness, 
compulsion, and affective contact. Rilmke's sensitive 
description of the psychiatrist's "praecox feeling" in 
the presence of schizophrenic patients remains highly 
relevant. J. H. van den Berg is perhaps best known 
for The Changing Nature of Man: Introduction to a 
Historical Psychology ( 1975). Also of interest is A 
Different Existence: Principles of Phenomenological 
Psychopathology (1974). 
In Switzerland MEDARD soss has carried Heidegge-
rian views directly into psychiatry, especially in the 
areas of psychotherapy and psychosomatic medicine. 
Boss's writings apparently have the approval of Hei-
degger himself. Heidegger personally participated in 
some of Boss's seminars, and Boss has published ex-
tensive records ofthese under Heidegger's own name. 
GION CONDRAU has continued to elaborate a Bossian 
approach to psychotherapy, also drawing directly on 
Heidegger. 
EUGENE MINKOWSKI, a native of Poland who settled 
in FRANCE, was strongJy inftuenced by HENRI BERGSON. 
Minkowski may be regarded as the first psychiatrist to 
take seriously the notion that a mentally il! person is 
fully human and should be treated as a fellow human 
being. Minkowski lived with mentally ill people and 
sought to understand them on their own terms. Cen-
tral to his understanding of mentally ill persons is the 
notion that for them access to the future is blocked. In 
1929, Minkowski helped found the group L 'Evolution 
psychiatrique, which published a journal by that name. 
After World War II, 
HENRI 
EY worked with 
Minkowski to revive L'Evolution Psychiatrique. In 
1972, HERBERT SPIEGELBERG wrote of Ey, "his is the 
most thorough and original utilization of phenomen-
ological philosophy in French psychiatry." Drawing 
on concepts from evolution, Ey has developed an 
"organo-dynamic" model ofpsychopathology; he thus 
seeks to integrate consciousness and brain processes. 
Starting first from a phenomenology of normal mental 
life, he attempts to understand mental illnesses as "de-
structurations" of consciousness. Of special interest is 
Ey's reinterpretation ofthe unconscious. 
PAUL RICCEUR 's study of Freud, De l 'interpretation: 
Essai sur Freud ( 1965), established strong ties between 
PSYCHOANALYSIS and HERMENEUTICS. This work aJso sets 
forth a hermeneutica! critique ofHusserlian phenomen-
ology, especially connected with Freud's understand-
ing of the unconscious. Ricceur's writings led some 
people to reevaluate the scientific status of psycho-

566 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
analysis. On this topic an interesting counterweight to 
Ricreur's book is AdolfGrunbaum's The Foundations 
of Psychoanalysis: A Philosophical Critique ( 1984 ). 
Among Japanese psychiatrists, BIN KIMURA is the 
leading representative of phenomenological and ex-
istential approaches. His investigations of the "in-
between" (the mood or atmosphere between two peo-
ple) utilizes a theme in Japanese culture that allows him 
to explicate aspects ofthe doctor-patient or therapeutic 
relationship. 
American psychoanalysts, such as Harry Stack Sul-
livan ( 1892-1949), ha ve introduced much needed so-
cial perspectives on mental illness. They view the self 
and its personal identity as constituted through INTER-
SUBJECTIVITY. Their psychology is thus "interpersonal" 
rather than "intrapsychic." 
Henri F. Ellenberger has written an important his-
torical study, The Discovery ofthe Unconscious: The 
History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry ( 1970). 
Ellenberger criticizes the narrow (i.e., theory-based) 
view of the unconscious and emphasizes that there is 
more to this field than Freud. As one of the coedi-
tors of Existence: A New Dimension in Psychiatry and 
Psychology ( 1958), Ellenberger helped bring pheno-
menological and existential approaches to psychiatry 
and psychology to the attention of Americans. 
Ro Ilo May (1909-1994) was another coeditor of 
Existence. He also coedited other compilations of es-
says that in the 1950s and 1960s helped familiarize 
American readers with phenomenological and existen-
tial psychiatry. In his own early writings, such as Psy-
chology and the Human Dilemma ( 1967), May sought 
to clarify for an American audience the links that the 
new psychiatry and psychology bore to Kierkegaard, 
Husserl, Tillich, Sartre, and other European thinkers. 
Irvin D. Yalom's Existential Psychotherapy (1980) 
offers an account of mental problems as arising from 
confticts rooted in the basic "givens of existence": 
namely, death, freedom, isolation, and meaningless-
ness. 
ono DORR-ZEGERS has carried the Heidelberg tra-
dition of Blankenburg and others to SPAIN AND LATIN 
AMERICA. Dorr-Zegers' work has also been strongly in-
ftuenced by HANS-GEORG GADAMER and Heidegger. In 
Spain phenomenology has been represented primarily 
by RAMON SARRO, P. LAIN ENTRALGO, and J. J. LOPEZ IBOR. 
Lopez Ibor in his book, Angustia vital (Vital anxiety, 
1952), draws mainly on ORTEGA v GASSET, Scheler, and 
Heidegger. He remains more willing than most phe-
nomenologists, however, to extend the field to include 
psychopharmacology and biology. 
During the last thirty years a growing number of 
French psychiatrists have been systematically devel-
oping phenomenology by incorporating German and 
American insights. ARTHUR TATOSSIAN spearheaded this 
development in Marseille. An emerging figure in this 
school today is JEAN NAUDIN, also in Marseille. In 
order to explicate the subjective experiences of pa-
tients, these writers draw on the ideas of Binswanger, 
Blankenburg, Kraus, and other German psychiatrists. 
Their recent work connects Binswanger's conception 
of inner life history with a narrative model of mental 
illness derived from John Strauss and Larry Davidson. 
For a broader understanding of the relationship be-
tween story and personal identity Naudin draws on 
the work of WILHELM SCHAPP, a student of Husserl. 
Other members ofthis new French school include JEAN-
MICHEL AZORIN, S. GIUDICELLI, D. J. PRINGUEY, MARC GER-
AUD, MARIE-CLAUDE LAMBOTTE, and YVES PELICIER. 
If we turn to imagining directions of collaboration 
between phenomenology and psychiatry in the future, 
we can conceive ofat least three. Two ofthese are con-
tributions phenomenology can make to psychiatry: ( 1) 
a PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY through which mental 
disorders can be comprehended and (2) methods for 
explicating human existence in great detail. Both of 
these contributions should include detailed investiga-
tions of the healthy human being as well as the ill, 
in contrast to the preoccupation of mainstream psy-
chiatry with illness alone. In addition, psychiatry can 
contribute to phenomenology by (3) furnishing exam-
ples of unusual human experiences that can stimulate 
and inform phenomenological investigations. 
( 1) Elements of a philosophical anthropology can be 
gleaned from Husserlian and Schelerian phenomenolo-
gies and from the philosophies of existence- namely, 
those of Jaspers, Heidegger, GABRIEL MARCEL, Sartre, 
Merleau-Ponty, and Ricreur. From a psychiatric point 
of view, however, the limitations that pervade pheno-
menology and existentialism consist in the fact that 
they remain too idealistic: either they put aside or ig-
nore the physico-biological dimensions ofhuman life, 
or, as in the case of Heidegger, they scorn approaches 
that ascribe centrality to biology. Scheler remains the 

PSYCHIATRY 
567 
sole exception to this criticism. Jaspers and Merleau-
Ponty appear at first glance to provide exceptions to it. 
But while Jaspers does allot a place for biology, he also 
insists on a rigid dualism that separates the biologica! 
from the existential. Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of 
the lived body should definitely be accorded a primary 
place in psychiatric anthropology, but ultimately even 
he attributes too little importance to the human body 
as explained by biology and neurophysiology for his 
position to prove adequate. The potential relevance of 
philosophical biologists and philosophical anthropol-
ogists, including Hans Jonas (1903-1993), HELMUTH 
PLESSNER, Adolph Portmann, Arnold Gehlen, and Mar-
jorie Grene, has not been sufficiently appreciated. Their 
importance !ies in the centrality that they accord tohu-
man biology and in their opposition to traditional mind-
body dualism. Furthermore, these thinkers analyze the 
interaction between society and biology in ways that 
ha ve yet tobe incorporated into either phenomenology 
or psychiatry. 
It should also be recognized that while Jonas, 
Gehlen, Plessner, Grene, and Portmann provide the 
larger organic context, this context must be filled in 
with contemporary neuroanatomy and neuroscience. 
Kenneth Schaffner and other philosophers of biology 
are relevant to this task. 
(2) Methods for explicating human existence in 
great detail are needed in order to apprehend suffi.-
ciently the complexity of mental disorders. A pheno-
menological method that is scientifically rigorous, nu-
anced, and securely based on EVIDENCE could provide 
the basic concepts for psychopathology: such meth-
ods could specify the differences, for example, among 
delusions present in schizophrenia, mania, and delir-
iuru. In addition, a carefully developed hermeneutica! 
method is needed to explore the life histories of indi-
vidual patients. Here the narrative structure and tem-
porality ofhuman existence as studied by Paul Ricceur 
and DAVID CARR would prove crucial. 
(3) Psychiatry and other disciplines within MEDICINE 
can furnish examples of unusual human experi-
ences that can stimulate, inform, broaden, and 
challenge phenomenological investigations. Merleau-
Ponty's and Gurwitsch's uses of Goldstein's stud-
ies provide instructive illustrations of how pheno-
menology benefits. Oliver Sacks and Alexander Ro-
manovich Luria (1902-1977) show how richly expli-
cated clinica! case histories deepen our appreciation of 
what it means to be human.

Psychoanalysis is a psy-
chological school that appeared at the same time 
as phenomenology. The two determining researchers 
are EDMUND HUSSERL in phenomenology and Sigmund 
Freud ( 1856-1939) in psychoanalysis. Both devel-
oped extensive frameworks for a psychology that was 
deemed "scientific." Although these two frameworks 
are fundamentally different, in the course of time, 
phenomenology and psychoanalysis met through PSY-
CHOLOGY. 
The fundamental works at the beginning of pheno-
menological psychology are FRANZ BRENTANo's Psy-
chologie vom empirischen Standpunkt ( 18 7 4 ), HENRI 
BERGSON's Essai sur les donnees immediates de la con-
science (Essay on the immediate givens of conscious-
ness, 1889), WILLIAM JAMES 's Principles of Psychol-
ogy ( 1890), and Husserl 's Logische Untersuchungen 
(1900-1901). 
Brentano especially examined the EVIDENCE of in-
ner perception, in comparison with which the evidence 
of outer reality remains questionable in principle. He 
defined the basic character ofpsychologicallife as the 
performance of intentiona! acts: every psychic phe-
nomenon is distinguished by its relation to a content. 
The acts are always given as a unity; the inner conti-
nuity of intentiona! consciousness is thus established. 
Brentano distinguished between genetic and descrip-
tive psychology: the task of descriptive psychology 
or descriptive phenomenology is to understand con-
sciousness by analyzing it. Bergson also wanted to 
describe immediate data of consciousness. He particu-
larly analyzed the duration of experienced time, which 
can only be differentiated qualitatively and can only 
be experienced by intuition. The continuous stream of 
duration carries the psychological acts and the concrete 
ego, which as such is free, because it is not under the 
control of o uter material conditions. 
According to James, ali events of consciousness 
can be explained by physical processes, but they them-
selves are about the choice of means to reach an end. 
They therefore ha ve a special function within the pro-
cesses oflife: thinking is a "stream ofthought" that only 
belongs to one individual and that constantly changes. 
It is oriented toward objects that exist outside of it; it 
establishes a selective activity that is guided by interest. 
James's theory of instinct includes a complex number 
of vital motivational structures, which are inherent and 
which cannot be reduced to a few. 
Husserl, for his part, put emphasis on the intentiona! 
character of consciousness, which includes the entire 
stock of the EGO. With the anaJysis of INTENTIONALITY, 
consciousness is the central theme: with constitution it 
actively creates and passive1y experiences the mean-
ing of objects in the world as well as its own unity. 
Thus consciousness lives as an active and passive syn-
thesis, which it can e1ucidate empirically, eidetically, 
and transcendentally. The empirica! task goes to de-
scriptive phenomenological psychology, which is in 
the service of the self-enlightenment of the teleology 
ofREASON. Transcendental-phenomenological rational-
ism is therefore a philosophy of mind that embraces 
ali being, including nature and the nature of the hu-
man being. Husserl 's phenomeno1ogical psycho1ogy is 
a psychology of consciousness with universal tasks. It 
is not psychology of the drives and has, because of its 
task and method, no access to the drives. 
Psychoanalysis is the work of a single man: Sig-
mund Freud. His most important works are Die 
Traumdeutung (The interpretation of dreams, 1900), 
Vorlesungen zur Einfiihrung in die Psychoanalyse (In-
troductory lectures in psychoanalysis, 1917), and Das 
Ich und das Es (The ego and the id, 1923 ). Freud un-

PSYCHOANALYSIS

derstood psychoanalysis (a) as a method to discover 
so-called repressions, (b) as a theory of neurotic disor-
ders based on this method, and ( c) as a universal theory 
of human beings, especially their sublimation and de-
structive tendencies. The main parts ofpsychoanalyti-
cal teaching are concemed with repression, inhibition, 
childhood experience, sexuallife, and the unconscious. 
Freud saw in his psychoanalysis the basis for an entire 
psychology; as "depth psychology" it was furthermore 
essential for ali sciences. Freud worked ali his life with 
neurotic people. After having treated hysteric neurotics 
and after having published his interpretation ofthe eti-
ology of this illness, he extended psychoanalysis to 
dreams, slips of the tongue, perversions, psychosis, 
artistic production, psychological theory of personal-
ity, aggression, and the origin of religion. 
Freud thought of psychoanalysis as a NATURAL scr-
ENCE, because the mind to him was an epiphenomenon. 
In the course of his life as a researcher, however, 
he transformed psychoanalysis into a universal theory 
of understanding. From 1874 to 1876 Freud attended 
Brentano's lectures in Vienna, but was hardly influ-
enced by him. Thinkers with a strong influence on him 
were Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887), Arthur 
Schopenhauer (1788-1860), Friedrich Wilhelm Niet-
zsche ( 1844-1900), and Theodor Lipps (1851-1914). 
He thus shared his philosophical opinions with the 
atheistic, evolutionary positivism of the late 19th cen-
tury. His metapsychological writings claim tobe philo-
sophical, although he himself despised philosophy-
systematic philosophical thinking he saw as close to 
paranoid mania. He explicated philosophical thoughts 
psychogenetically: to him the categorica! imperative, 
for example, was an heir to the Oedipus complex. 
In the field of psychology he thought the research 
of unconscious drives to be more important than the 
description of phenomena of consciousness. The term 
"phenomenon" he used very rarely, and only with re-
gard to the li nes of processes of consciousness, which 
according to him were incomplete and which had tobe 
completed from the point of view of drive dynamism. 
Thus he clearly rejected the equal status ofpsychologi-
cal processes and consciousness as well as the assump-
tion of the evidence of in ner perception. 
Phenomenology and psychoanalysis are divergent. 
(a) The research topic ofphenomenology is conscious-
ness, that of psychoanalysis is the subconscious. (b) 
Intentionality works teleologically and creates objec-
tive meaning, while drives have a causal effect and 
create factuallife history. (c) From a phenomenologi-
cal point of view, the task of reason is the universal 
elucidation of the world and the self, and this task is 
thought tobe soluble. From a psychoanalytical point of 
view, consciousness is the victim of "rationalization," 
which comes from the tendencies in the superego of 
the so-called psychological apparatus. 
According to Freud's psychoanalysis a theory of 
autonomous subjectivity is not possible. ( 1) The unity 
of consciousness and primordiality of the individual 
are rejected. Repression is a more original process 
than the synthesis of consciousness. The main aim 
is not self-knowledge, but dissociation from the plea-
sure principle and acceptance of the reality principle. 
(2) A transcendental subject as the creator of mean-
ing is fictional. Human beings are govemed by their 
subconscious and by the laws of the id. Reason is a de-
rived condition balancing between ego and superego. 
(3) There is no autonomy of practica! reason, and the 
ego is not morally independent; the entire psycholog-
ical apparatus can only be preserved with difficulties 
against the desires ofthe drives. 
Husserl did not comment on psychoanalysis. His 
phenomenology is research into consciousness. He and 
Brentano are skeptical and disapproving of the sub-
conscious. If formerly unconscious processes appear 
in consciousness, though, they can be examined phe-
nomenologically- psychologically and transcenden-
tally. Within the development of Husserl 's phenomen-
ology there are different stages of distance from psy-
choanalysis. The EIDETIC METHOD examines essences 
by a procedure that is not historical, and therefore it 
is without a connection to the history of drives. Tran-
scendental phenomenology, on the other hand, has sev-
era! approaches open to it, among others the historical 
approach of GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY. So the differ-
ence between phenomenology and psychoanalysis is 
reduced. 
In contrast to the moderate openness of pheno-
menology that follows as a consequence, orthodox 
psychoanalysis remains hostile to philosophy: Freud's 
metapsychological approach leaves humanity in a 
closed system of forces, which displace, shift, and fix 
each other as ifthey were under the laws ofnature. Hu-
mans are not autonomous subjects, but are carried by a 

570 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
psychological apparatus that has tobe examined scien-
tifically. The human being remains a "human animal"; 
the evolution ofhumankind needs no other explanation 
than the evolution of animals. 
Phenomenology and psychoanalysis are compared 
in the literature for the first time in 1911. Arthur Kro-
nfeld criticized the concept of symbol in psychoanal-
ysis and saw the most important task of phenomen-
ological psychology in the psychology of emotions. 
He thought Brentano 's psychology to be more pro-
ductive than Husserl 's approach. In 1927 Heinz Hart-
mann (1894-1970) again compared both schools of 
thought and he examined the method of psychoanaly-
sis: it wants to give reasons for the qualitative diversity 
ofthe psyche by reducing it to simpler confrontations 
of drives. Compared with that, phenomenological psy-
chology tries to understand this qualitative richness as 
a whole and in its own right, without trying to deduce it 
from causes. Causal and historical interrelations stand 
in contrast to static connections of essence. 
The anthropological phenomenologist MAX SCHELER 
dealt with psychoanalysis intensively; he acknowl-
edged repression and saw in it a source of deception 
for inner perception. For him EMOTIONs were of cen-
tral significance. As a phenomenologist of essence he 
acknowledged actual emotions as what they are. They 
must not be deduced psychogenetically and hypothet-
ically from supposed assumptions of drives. 
Representatives of the depth psychological school 
of thought are Alfred Adler (1870-1937), who ex-
amined feelings of inferiority, and Cari Gustav Jung 
(1875-1961 ), who put forward the hypothesis of the 
collective unconscious. Neither dealt with phenomen-
ology. From psychoanalysis there also emerged the 
neo-analytical branch: Harald Schultz-Hencke ( 1892-
1953) focused on the inhibition ofhuman beings as a 
central theme. He described INTENTIONALITY as the ba-
sic structure of inquisitiveness and regarded the entire 
organization of experience of drives as shaped by it. 
Phenomenology was altered by MARTIN HEIDEGGER's 
Sein und Zeit ( 1927). It here became the hermeneutics 
ofthe state (constitution) ofthe being ofthe human be-
ing, i.e., the being-there, DASEIN. Yet the phenomenon 
remains that which "shows-itself-in-itself, the obvi-
ous" within its horizon. Dasein as "being-in-the-world" 
is existent especially in the existentials of original 
"world-openness," ofTIME and SPACE, of mood, of care, 
and of"being-toward-death."With this, in other words, 
the psycho1ogica1 characteristics of anxiety, guilt, and 
conscience are named, which are a ma in topic of psy-
choanalysis. Heidegger knew psychonanalysis, but he 
rejected it absolutely. He thought of a psychoanalytical 
life history as a constructed naturalistic causal chain. 
There are no philosophical similarities between 
Freud and Heidegger. Both, however, emphasize death 
as no thinkers did before them. In his late years Freud 
put forward the death drive, which, he thought, belongs 
to every cell and it drives back to the beginning ofthe 
past. Heidegger's Dasein is characterized as "being-
toward-death"; it is an existential of human being; it 
makes an enormous future possible. 
"Daseinsanalyse," a school of thought in German 
and Swiss PSYCHIATRY, is based on Freud and on pheno-
menology. Its main representatives are LUDWIG BIN-
SWANGER and MEDARD BOSS. Using psychoanaJysis, this 
school is based in part on Husserl but mainly on Hei-
degger. It translates Heidegger's ontologica! approach 
into a conception of psychiatry that is aimed at con-
crete courses oflife. Freud and Binswanger exchanged 
thoughts intensively, and Boss and Heidegger worked 
together. Binswanger's intention was to decipher the 
uniqueness of a life history, not its drive-genetical 
organization. According to Boss the phenomena of 
human existence can only be understood adequately 
when they are not traced back causally to other pro-
cesses. A psychoanalytically interpretable history of 
drives might happen in human beings; the openness of 
existence, though, remains foreign to such a history. 
It is the significance of neuroses and perversions that 
has an effect on life history, not the genesis, which 
is externa! to its contents. Daseinsanalyse especially 
deals with endogenous psychoses, neuroses, perver-
sions, and dreams. Its therapeutic successes are con-
troversial. 
The method of VIKTOR VON GEBSATTEL is similar to 
that of Daseinsanalyse, without him being a repre-
sentative of this school. Beginning from Husserl and 
Heidegger, as well as Freud and Jung, he pointed to 
the "worlds" that are characteristic of the sick person 
-for example, the characteristic worlds of phobias, in 
which anxiety works as an original phenomenon oflife, 
even if it has been specified by individual accidents of 
drive. Daseinsanalyse has been continued since 1955 
in the UNITED STATES as "existential analysis." 

PSYCHOANALYSIS 
571 
In FRANCE, German phenomenology took effect 
through the intluence of Scheler. The central figure 
of phenomenological psychiatry in France, EUGENE 
MINKOWSKI, was intluenced by Scheler and Bergson. 
From Scheler he took the distinction between the psy-
chogenesis and the significance of psychological phe-
nomena. In the 1920s the teaching of Husserl was 
spread by JEAN HERING and ALEXANDRE KOYRE. The 
!ater version of French phenomenology was mainly 
shaped by Georges Politzer ( 1903-1942). His Critique 
desfondements de la psychologie ( 1928) had an effect 
from MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY and JEAN-PAUL SARTRE to 
Jacques Lacan (190 1-1981 ). Politzer opposed the me-
chanics of the subconscious, but he emphasized the 
linguistic hasis ofthe psychoanalytic dyad. 
In the course of the 1930s the thinking of Husserl 
carne to the fore, mainly because of his Paris lectures 
and the works of ARON GURWITSCH, GASTON BERGER, 
and Sartre. On the French psychoanalytical side AN-
GELO HESNARD began trying in the 1940s to develop 
a phenomenological psychoanalysis. He called Freud 
"un phenomenologue avant la lettre." According to 
Hesnard the psychotherapeutically important problem 
of the relation to the other can only be solved on the 
basis of a phenomenoJogy of INTERSUBJECTIVITY. 
In his early works Sartre examined the transcen-
dence of the EGO and the power of IMAGINATION. His 
main ontologica! work, L 'etre et le neant ( 1943 ), is 
a phenomenology of the being of phenomena and 
consciousness without reference to a transcendental 
grounding. The world of consciousness is extended by 
the psychoanalytical themes ofthe BODY and intersub-
jective sexuality. The assumption of the unconscious, 
however, is sharply rejected. The self-understanding 
of the human being works before any explicit refiec-
tion. What is known provisionally can be clearly rec-
ognized by "existential psychoanalysis." Sartre calls 
Freudian psychoanalysis "empirica! psychoanalysis." 
With it Sartre's "existential psychoanalysis" shares the 
opinion that there are no original conditions, that the 
life of the subject has to be reconstructed from birth 
-
there "empirically," here "existentially." Thus he 
develops the method "which shall bring the subjec-
tive choices out into the open, by which every indi-
vidual creates itself as an individual." Freud's psy-
choanalysis elucidates by using dreams, slips of the 
tongue, and neuroses; Sartre 's psychoanalysis is con-
cemed with conscious thoughts, completed acts, and 
the entire lifestyle. 
The most extensive examination of German pheno-
menology in France was dane by MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY. Following Husserl 's taking up ofthe LIFEWORLD 
and Heidegger's treatment ofDASEIN, he interpreted the 
unity of existence and world in relation to the immedi-
ate performance of the lived life. This unity precedes 
the differentiation between subject and refiection and 
between abject and being. The lifeworld he analyzed 
especially as a natural-historical world of PERCEPTION. 
Humans understand their original being-in-the-world 
by their bodies. The body in which we live opens 
the world to us. The existence of humankind is au-
tonomous within itself, but also dependent on the body 
and therefore ambiguous. By emphasizing the role of 
the body Merleau-Ponty is nearer to psychoanalysis 
than to the transcendental position. According to him, 
phenomenology has to make use of the expansion of 
experience that was made possible by psychoanalysis. 
As long as this is dane critically, even the energetic 
models of psychoanalysis can become a guide to un-
derstanding the history ofthe subject. At the end ofhis 
life Merleau-Ponty emphasized that not even pheno-
menology explained clearly the facts that were told 
confusedly by psychoanalysis. 
The work of PAUL RICCEUR is also a lifelong exami-
nation of phenomenology. At first he set his EXISTEN-
TIAL PHENOMENOLOGY against the transcendental point 
ofview; in it a phenomenology ofwill takes the place of 
constitution. After a so-called "ontologica!" phase he 
reached a HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY. Jn it LAN-
GUAGE becomes the abject of phenomenological in-
terpretation. This hermeneutics of MEANING contrasts 
with the Freudian energetics of drives. In his main 
work, De l 'interpretation (1965), Ricreur undertook 
the most extensive examination to date ofpsychoanal-
ysis. The parts he thought useable he incorporated in 
his philosophical hermeneutics. His basic thesis is that 
psychoanalysis is a mixed discourse -
partly ener-
getic, partly hermeneutica!. Like a natural science, it 
reduces psychological phenomena to forces, and like 
the HUMAN SCIENCES, it uncovers their meaning. 
Ricreur accepted only the conversation between pa-
tient and analyst as the psychoanalytical field of expe-
rience. The only abject ofhis psychoanalytical theory 
is the definite experience in this dyadic transaction. 

572 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
According to him, observable behavior does not cre-
ate facts that can be used for theory. In psychoanalysis 
he therefore did not see a science of observation; its 
research has to be restricted to the semantics of de-
sire, because desire wants to be expressed, it gradually 
wants to become meaning. Accordingly, psychoanal-
ysis must seek the origin of the meaning of psycho-
logical phenomena not only in the archaisms of the 
drives, but also in the progressively constituted te/os 
ofmeaning. 
In the end Ricreur strove for a metaphysical and 
religious revelation of experience: he wanted to trans-
fer the genetic archaeology of psychoanalysis and the 
hermeneutica! teleology of his phenomenology from 
phenomenology of religion to that of the "absolutely 
different." 
Jacques Lacan is not a genuine phenomenologist, 
but his school ofthought also fought against every cog-
ito-philosophy in psychoanalysis, American ego psy-
chology, and Sartre's existential psychoanalysis. By 
frequently referring to linguistics, LOGIC, and cybernet-
ics he tried to show that psychoanalysis on the whole is 
not psychology. Knowledge and intention are no longer 
taken as individual processes. Lacan allocated the un-
conscious a structure analogous to that oflanguage; it is 
"the speech ofthe different one." The Belgian philoso-
pher ALPHONSE DE WAELHENS has tried to construct a Jink 
between phenomenology and Lacan's psychoanalysis. 
In his version, the unconscious is "the chapter in the 
history of humankind that has remained blank or that 
remains occupied by a lie. It is censored, but its truth 
can be regained." 
The confrontation between phenomenology and 
psychoanalysis has fascinated philosophers and the in-
telligentsia concemed with the human sciences and 
the CULTURAL DISCIPLINES. The encounter between the 
schools ofthought, however, had the insoluble task of 
connecting the doctrine ofthe revelation ofpsycholog-
ical phenomena in consciousness and the doctrine of 
the control of consciousness by the drives.

PSYCHOLOGISM

Most generally, psycholo-
gism is the philosophical position that regards empir-
ica! psychology as the most basic philosophical disci-
pline: empirica! PSYCHOLOGY as first philosophy. That 
means especially that normative and practica! branches 
of phiJosophy, such as LOGIC, ETHICS, AESTHETICS, and 
epistemology ha veto be grounded in empirica! psycho-
logical findings. This doctrine, enunciated originally by 
two otherwise obscure German philosophers ofthe first 
half ofthe nineteenth century, Jakob Fries ( 1783-1844) 
(System der Metaphysik, 1824) and Friedrich Beneke 
( 1798-1854) (Die Philosophie in ihrem Verhăltnis zur 
Erfahrung, zur Spekulation, und zum Leben, [Philoso-
phy in its relation to experience, speculation, and life, 
1833]), arose as an empirically oriented opposition to 
the idealism of HEGEL as well as to KANT's transcen-
dental philosophy. The most prominent philosopher 
to provide a thorough articulation and defense of the 
psychologistic position was John Stuart Miii. By the

PSYCHOLOGJSM 
573 
end of the 19th century, psychologism had become 
widespread as an unquestioned presupposition in much 
of German philosophy, incorporated even in standard 
logic texts such as the Logik (1873-78) of Christoff 
Sigwart (1830-1904). 
Neo-Kantian philosophers, however, continued to 
resist its acceptance and to pose a significant alternative 
to it. For about the first half of the 20th century, psy-
chologism was known mainly as the target of devastat-
ing attacks leveled specifically against logica! psychol-
ogism by GOTTLOB FREGE and EDMUND HUSSERL. In recent 
years, however, the long influential antipsychologism 
ofFrege and Rudolph Carnap (1891-1970) has in turn 
come to be challenged, especially by Willard V. O. 
Quine, as based upon unwarranted dogmatic assump-
tions. Further, some followers of LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN 
interpret logica! principles as conventional rules that 
define the game called "thinking" ( on analogy with, 
say, the rules of chess, truth being an achievement 
gained by permissible moves, as is checkmate). Hence 
they are sometimes thought to be proposing a radical 
sort ofbehavioral social psychologism. 
CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY OWeS many ofits dis-
tinctive traits to the fact that it originated in a form 
of logica! psychologism and developed in opposition 
to the most serious perceived flaws of psychologism, 
but remained closer in spirit to psychologism than to 
the most radical antipsychologism, which would insist 
on eliminating ali reference to mental categories from 
the analysis of logic and of scientific knowledge. The 
development of Husserl's philosophy can be set into 
five stages with respect to psychologism. The first, 
psychologistic stage, embodied in his Philosophie der 
Arithmetik ( 1891 ), precedes the development ofpheno-
menology. The second stage is that ofthe Prolegomena 
zur reinen Logik ( 1900), the first volume of Logische 
Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901 ). It presents a set of argu-
ments against logica! psychologism, as well as a sketch 
of a phenomenological conception ofthe main features 
of objective formal logic, liberated from ali psychol-
ogistic interpretation. The second volume of Logis-
che Untersuchungen ( 1901) introduces a philosophi-
cal clarification of logic and of scientific knowledge 
in general that employs an approach termed, equiv-
alently, "phenomenology" and "descriptive psychol-
ogy." Hence it may be regarded as a third stage, one 
that is thought by many not to be clearly differenti-
ated from epistemological psychologism. The fourth 
broad phase is that of successive attempts to provide 
and defend clear and definitive distinctions between the 
method and subject matter ofpsychology and of pheno-
menological epistemology, so as to avoid ali suspicion 
oflogical or epistemological psychologism. More fully 
developed constitutive phenomenology may be taken 
as presenting a fifth stage, in which some ofthe previ-
ous clear distinctions are somewhat blurred. 
Husserl's Philosophie der Arithmetik was subtitled 
Psychologische und logische Untersuchungen. In ac-
cordance with the approach favored by his teacher of 
mathematics at the University of Berlin, Karl Weier-
strass ( 1815-1897), Husserl aimed to clarify the con-
cept of number by tracing it back to its psychological 
origin in the experience of counting. In doing so, he 
applied to the concept ofnumber the psychological dis-
tinction emphasized by FRANZ BRENTANO between au-
thentic (seeing, intuitive) presentations and inauthen-
tic (blindly symbolic) presentations. The aim was to 
illuminate the nature and scope of the authentic con-
cept of number, that is, the extent to which one can 
count in full awareness of what is involved in such 
mental processes as denumerating, adding, and recog-
nizing equality. The further aim was to illuminate both 
the need and the rational possibility of supplementing 
authentic numbers with inauthentic, merely symbolic, 
calculative techniques. For some time, it was widely 
assumed that Husserl was converted from psycholo-
gism by the stern critique ofhis book written by Frege. 
However, it has since been accepted that Husserl had 
been dissatisfied with his own lack ofsufficiently clear 
fundamental distinctions, such as the crucial one be-
tween the psychological event, presentation ofnumber, 
and the nonpsychological object, number, even before 
Frege published his criticism. 
In his foreword to Prolegomena to Pure Logic, 
Husserl recounted his experience of disillusionment 
with logica! psychologism: "I began work on the pre-
vailing assumption that psychology was the science 
from which logic in general, and the logic of the de-
ductive sciences, had to hope for philosophical clarifi-
cation ... There were, however, connections in which 
such a psychological foundation never carne to sat-
isfy me . . . I became more and more disquieted by 
doubts ofprinciple, as to how to reconcile the objectiv-
ity ofmathematics, and of ali science in general, with a

psychological foundation for logic. In this manner my 
whole method, which 1 had taken over from the con-
victions ofthe reigning logic, that sought to illuminate 
the given science through psychological analyses, be-
came shaken, and 1 felt myselfmore and more pushed 
towards general critica! reflections on the essence of 
logic, and on the relationship, in particular, between 
the subjectivity of knowing and the objectivity of the 
content known." 
Since Husserl had found himself at a theoretical 
impasse, his arguments against logica! psychologism 
focused upon its perceived interna! inconsistencies and 
implicit skeptical consequences. Further, sin ce his con-
cern was with psychologism as a general and diffused 
orientation toward logic, his arguments centered on sig-
nificant thematic points and referred to specific philo-
sophical writings mainly by way of occasional illus-
trations of those points. Some such illustrations are 
relatively easy targets of his critique because they are 
inherently confused; hence they probably serve as apt 
symptoms of the state of psychologism in Germany at 
the time. 
Sigwart, for instance, held that logica! principles are 
universal and necessary propositions. But he also main-
tained that they have to be grounded in empirica! psy-
chology. That position provided a clear illustration of 
theoretical absurdity: logic, a deductive system of pre-
cise propositions derivable as necessary consequences 
from axiomatic, universal, and necessary propositions, 
cannot justifiably be grounded in an empirica! science 
that can yield at best only highly probable generaliza-
tions, inherently vague in their reference to accompa-
nying circumstances. The position undermines itself, 
implying an unwitting consequent skepticism. In an 
effort to save the possibility of universal and neces-
sary propositions, Sigwart only made things worse by 
appealing to a special feeling of necessity as provid-
ing their evidence, and then assigning to logic the task 
of clarifying the psychological conditions under which 
such a feeling emerges. Since strong feelings ofneces-
sity are more likely to accompany our most cherished 
and unquestioned prejudices than unbiased assertions 
of abstract logica! principles, the position is without 
merit. But those defects do not necessarily establish 
the inherent absurdity of logica! psychologism. Sig-
wart's position may well be merely a poor example 
of psychologism, to be rejected by more careful psy-
chologistic thinkers as readily as by antipsychologistic 
ones. 
John Stuart Mill, for example, avoided the incon-
sistency illustrated by Sigwart's position. He held con-
sistently that ali inference yielding real knowledge is 
inductive, including the knowledge of logica! princi-
ples, which therefore do not enjoy the status ofuncon-
ditioned necessity. He maintained that deductive syllo-
gistic arguments, rather then yielding real knowledge, 
only apply empirically known general principles to the 
interpretation of more particular cases. He refused to 
grant any evidential status to feelings of necessity or 
of inconceivability, which he regarded as contingent 
facts to be explained by references to our past history 
and mental habits. And, significantly for the psychol-
ogism controversy, Mill distinguished clearly between 
beliefs, as states of mind, and propositions, as unities 
ofmeaning that are not modifications ofthe mind. His 
view oflogic rejected as mistaken the philosophical no-
tion prevalent since Descartes that propositions were 
to be understood by reference to acts of judgment. 
Antipsychologistic arguments directed against 
Mill's position tend to beg the question. His psycholo-
gism is deemed deficient because it cannot account for 
the unconditioned universality and necessity oflogical 
principles. But that logica! principles enjoy that status 
has to be shown, not simply asserted. His position is 
rejected as a relativistic skepticism. Buton Mill's own 
grounds, the recognition of the relativity of knowl-
edge to the psychological conditions ofthe knower is a 
virtue, not a fault. His position is not a self-refuting or 
self-defeating absolute skepticism, but it is a resolute 
skepticism with regard to absolute knowledge claims. 
The contrary position of logica! absolutism has to be 
established, not assumed as an unquestioned premise. 
The disagreement as to the status of logic as a sci-
ence is itself rooted in a basic epistemological opposi-
tion. The phenomenological position ofthe Prolegom-
ena maintains that logic articulates the objective unity 
of theory that is grounded purely in the sense of such 
objective concepts as "theory," "truth," "proposition," 
"relation"; that objective theoretical unity (the unity of 
a deductive system) is a necessary characteristic of ide-
ally possible science; and that formal objective logic is 
self-grounding since its principles are self-evident and 
self-evidently universal and necessary. 
When asked how one can possibly know, rather 

PSYCHOLOGISM

than merely assert, the details of that position, pheno-
menology appeals to the ideal possibility ofimmediate 
insight into principles. That is, it appeals to a form of 
knowledge of which empiricism is inherently suspi-
cious. Further, such insight into principles is character-
ized, phenomenologically, as not being a form of real, 
or natural, knowledge.lt provides no knowledge of any 
real fact, general or particular, about existing nature, 
either physical or psychological nature. At that point, 
the basic epistemological opposition is manifest. Psy-
chologism has to be rejected by the logica! absolutist 
because psychology, as an empirica! NATURAL SCIENCE, 
is unable to provide or to ground the ideal (nonreal, 
non-natural) knowledge that characterizes the science 
of objective formal logic. From the opposite perspec-
tive, naturalistic empiricism refuses to acknowledge 
any form of scientific knowledge other than that form 
that has proven its success in modern physical sciences 
and promises to render the study of the mind equally 
scientific, a form ofknowledge that rejects immediate 
intuitions and relies upon the observation and causal 
analysis of facts. It would seem safe to assume that 
psychologism is likely to remain a live philosophical 
option as long as NATURALISM does. 
Ifthe logica! absolutist's quarrel is with the empiri-
cism and naturalism that characterize psychologism, 
and if the logica! absolutist has to appeal to the lived 
experience ofimmediate insight to justify the possibil-
ity oflogic as a form ofknowledge, should the remedy 
be a new and improved psychologism, resting upon a 
non-empirica!, non-natural psychology? That seemed 
to be the rationale of the second volume of Logische 
Untersuchungen, which presented the rudiments of a 
descriptive psychology, or phenomenology, ofthe ele-
ments of knowing. 
Instead of submitting the reflectively observed el-
ements of psychic life to a causal explanation, such 
a phenomenology analyzes cognitive lived experience 
in terms of non-natural, non-empirica!, directly intu-
itable categories, such as the intending of MEANING, 
the fulfillment of meaning, rational motivation, and 
intrinsic whole-part relations. Thus, for example, the 
principle of noncontradiction can be analyzed as be-
ing necessarily true just in virtue ofwhat a proposition 
is, what propositional truth is, and what contradiction 
is, ali regarded purely as ideally possible and com-
possible unities of meaning. And the question of the 
justification for knowledge of that principle is not re-
ferred to a causal analysis of any psychological condi-
tions, such as pertinent laws of association of ideas, by 
which someone comes to believe it. Rather, the ques-
tion becomes one ofwhether such a beliefis rationally 
motivated or not. And direct insight or evidence into 
the appropriate relations of meanings to one another 
is deemed a fully rational motivation for asserting, for 
example, that two contradictory propositions cannot 
possibly both be true. 
Within that descriptive psychological approach, in-
trinsic aspects of cognition are subjected to ramified 
distinctions crucial to maintaining the possibility of 
objective knowledge, and the many often confused 
senses of such terms as "act," "content," "presenta-
tion," and "object" are clarified. But at the same time, 
essential relations between, for example, meanings and 
intendings of meanings were articulated as ideal pos-
sibilities of intentiona! lived experience. The overall 
project was to clarify both the (nonpsychological) ob-
jectivity ofmeanings, as the subject matter oflogic and 
the discursive medium of science, and the relevance 
of meanings to the subjective (psychological) possi-
bility ofknowledge. The result was such that WILHELM 
DILTHEY, who had himselfproposed a reform movement 
within psychology and epistemology to take advan-
tage methodologically of the difference between the 
givenness ofpsychic life and the givenness ofphysical 
nature, saw the Logische Untersuchungen as an epoch-
making achievement in the application of descriptive 
psychology to epistemology. 
The fourth stage of phenomenology's encounter 
with psychologism was to surrender the title "descrip-
tive psychology" as a misleading way of characterizing 
the phenomenological approach to epistemology. One 
problem with comprehending psychologism is that it 
involves what John Stuart Miii referred to as "logica! 
and psychological speculations." That is, the issue does 
not concern particular logica! axioms or rules of deriva-
tion, nor any particular psychologicallaws. Rather, the 
questions re late to various interpretations of logic and 
ofpsychology and oftheir relations to one another. But 
equally at stake, whether explicitly recognized or not, 
are epistemological questions concerning the nature of 
knowledge, and then, stil! further, questions ofhow to 
re late epistemology to logic and to psychology. 
A fifth stage, involving further development in the 

576 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
phenomenological discussion ofthose basic themes be-
yond the level represented in Husserl's Ideen zu einer 
reinen Phdnomenologie und phdnomenologischen 
Philosophie 1 ( 1913 ), suggests a need to reconsider 
the classic opposition to ali forms ofpsychologism. 
More developed phenomenology continues to ac-
cept logic and mathematics as non-empirica!, a priori, 
disciplines. But the original logica! absolutism of the 
Prolegomena gets qualified eventually as one-sided, 
dogmatic, and naive. It becomes balanced with the 
recognition of the kemel of truth in psychologism: 
numbers, despite their ideal character, are produced 
in counting, and judicative propositions are produced 
in judging activity. 
At the same time, phenomenology transforms its 
original situation by developing an eidetic, intentiona! 
psychology that would not be disqualified, on the same 
grounds as empirica!, naturalistic psychology, from be-
ing foundational for the clarification of a priori sci-
ences. Such a psychology is able to reflect eidetically 
upon the intentiona! correlations holding among lived 
experiences, the senses they intend, and the objects 
to which such senses refer. It also includes within its 
themes basic questions of motivation, as distinct from 
natural causality, including the epistemic question of 
the rational motivation of scientific knowledge pro-
cesses. 
A further complication ofthe earlier black and white 
opposition to psychologism stems from a double line 
of sophistication in the phenomenological approach to 
the constitution of scientific objectivity. On the one 
hand, the consideration of abstractly intellectual sci-
ences gets integrated within the broader context oftheir 
grounding in the prescientific LJFEWORLD. On the other 
hand, transcendental consciousness becomes subject to 
more concrete analysis, disclosing the essentially per-
sonal, INTERSUBJECTIVE, and HISTORICAL character ofthe 
constitution of objectivity. Finally, tobe true to its sub-
ject matter, psychology also has to engage in the study 
of the constitution of the personal surrounding world 
from the perspective ofthe psychological subject. 
The blurring of the original distinction serves to 
highlight a more important hasis for the same differ-
entiation. Rather than the opposition between a priori 
and empirica! sciences, what needs tobe emphasized is 
a distinction in levels of reflection and discussion. On 
the one hand, there is the level ofref!ection and discus-
sion within sciences directed toward domains that they 
have to accept as given in some appropriately defined 
mode of evidence. Philosophical reflection upon and 
discussion of such sciences has to occur at a different 
level, one that does not proceed upon the grounds of 
acceptance of their domains as given to their appro-
priate modes ofEVIDENCE, but rather involves a critica! 
analysis of those grounds. 
From that perspective, psychology is an experiential 
natural and HUMAN SCIENCE, even ifit succeeds in inter-
preting psychological data by way of categories based 
upon eidetic, and even transcendental, phenomenologi-
cal reflection. Ultimately, its subject matter is psychic 
or mental facts, objectified in factually existing forms 
ofhuman and animal subjects, discoverable within the 
larger horizon of the world as accessible to experi-
ence. It is responsible for discovering, by appropriately 
formed experiential observation, facts and regularities 
characteristic ofpsychological subjects in the contexts 
ofactually existing natural and cultural conditions. Al-
though experience of objects existing in the world is 
also a psychological fact to be observed, clarified, and 
analyzed in its various types and conditions, psychol-
ogy cannot suspend the acceptance ofthe experience of 
psychological subjects as existing within the world, so 
as to submit such psychologically directed experience 
to an epistemological critique, without undercutting its 
own necessary ground. 
Epistemology, on the contrary, includes within its 
scope a rational critique of the possibility of contribu-
tions to knowledge ofthe world stemming from expe-
rience. To undertake that task, it does have to suspend 
acceptance ofwhat such experience presents, including 
ref!ective psychological experience. Consequently, the 
transcendental approach to cognitive lived experience 
is not directed toward analyzing the eidetic structures 
of actually or possibly existing psychological subjects 
that psychology has to assume as accessible to psycho-
logical experience. Rather, the epistemological con-
cern has to be with ideally possible intentiona! lived 
experience, as intuitively implicated in ideally possible 
constitution of objects of possible knowledge, includ-
ing experiential knowledge, i.e., the EIDETIC METHOD 
is relied on. Methodologically this means that the in-
stances of relevant forms of cognitive lived experi-
ence may just as well be fictitious as factual. lf they 
are factual, they are taken as presented to transcen-

PSYCHOLOGY 
577 
dental rather than psychological reflection, that is, to 
an experience that does not accept its data as belong-
ing to the natural or social world. Thus the approach 
taken has to be both eidetic and transcendental. What 
this implies, further, is that pure, epistemologically ori-
ented, phenomenologiucal reflection cannot establish 
a single psychological fact, nor can it appeal to any. 
Accordingly, epistemologically (transcendentally) ori-
ented phenomenology is not to be understood as itself 
a form of psychology or as based upon o ne, not even 
a radically reformed descriptive or phenomenological 
psychology. In the phenomenological project, episte-
mological (transcendental) psychologism also has to 
be supplanted, as well as logica! psychologism.

PSYCHOLOGY 
JOHN SCANLON 
Duquesne University 
(See also PHILOSOPHY OF 
PSYCHOLOGY) AJthough EDMUND HUSSERL adamantly 
warned against the pitfalls of PSYCHOLOGISM -
REL-
ATIVISM and skepticism -
he was convinced that a 
nonpsychologistic descriptive psychology could be 
carried out in a phenomenological attitude. The causal 
theory of experience is the source of psychologism's 
relativism. Although this theory pervades natural sci-
entific psychological approaches to experience, deter-
minism is not a necessary approach for psychology. 
A phenomenological psychology could set aside the 
objectivist-deterministic pair in order to study human 
experience precisely as experienced and in its own 
right. Today the pervasiveness of objectivism, deter-
minism, and NATURALISM in psychology is no less ap-
parent than it was in Husserl's day. In fact, the model 
has become strengthened and multiplied itself in a wide 
variety ofnaturalistic approaches that were never imag-
ined by early positivistic psychology. Consequently, 
phenomenological psychology has taken on the per-
sistent chore of continuing Husserl 's early criticisms, 
amending them for a continually changing and diver-
sifying naturalistic psychological field. 
In 1963 STEPHAN STRASSER pub]ished Fenomendo-
gie en empirische menskunde (Phenomenology and the 
human sciences) aiming largely at the "objectivist" il-
lusion characterizing the behaviorist psychology that 
dominated the day. AMEDEO GIORGI's Psychology as a 
Human Science ( 1970) aimed phenomenological criti-
cism at the dispersion in psychology that has resulted 
from objectivism's lack of a coherent and meaning-
ful understanding of human subjectivity as a totality, 
continuing an argument initiated by early phenomenol-
ogists such as JEAN-PAUL SARTRE. In his introduction to 
Esquisse d'une theorie des emotions (Outline of a the-
ory ofthe emotions, 1939), Sartre wondered about the 
juxtaposition of topics typically found in introductory 
psychology textbooks. What could be more different 
than the stroboscopic illusion and the inferiority com-
plex, he asked, and how could one even hope to develop 
a vision of the human psyche that would incorporate 
the two in a coherent way? 
More recent phenomenological critiques of natu-
ralistic psychology have shifted their focus as cog-
nitive appruaches have begun to dominate the field. 
ROBERT ROMANYSHYN's Psychological Life: From Sci-
ence to Metaphor (1982) dialogued with structuralist 
approaches, replacing objectivist notions of structure 
with phenomenoJogicaJ ones. DONALD POLKINGHORNE's 
Methodology.for the Human Sciences: Systems of In-
quiry (1983) returned to the ubiquitous causal fixation 
and its correlative obsession with the past, utilizing 
newer hermeneutica! trends and EXISTENTIAL PHENO-
MENOLOGY to expand the notion ofpsychology beyond 
causal explanation. 
While phenomenological psychology is continu-
ally called to object to the enveloping naturalism 
in psychology at large, it is also called to reunder-
stand the field in its own terms. Human being is not 
like the being of an object; it is an intentiona! be-

ing and therefore must be undcrstood teleologically, 
in terms of its aimedness, rather than deterministi-
cally. The model for psychological intentiona! analysis 
was provided in Husserl's Phanomenologische Psy-
chologie [1925]. Without any reference to transcen-
dental issues, which would have rendered the work 
more philosophical than psychological, Husserl car-
ried out intentiona! investigations of perceptual con-
sciousness with the characteristic two-sided constitu-
tive anaJysis and thus CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 
OF THE NATURAL ATTITUDE. On the one hand, a noetic 
inquiry unraveled the acts of consciousness intend-
ing the perceptual world; on the other hand, an anal-
ysis of the NOEMA revealed the structures of appear-
ance that unfold to present the perceptual world. In-
terestingly, these analyses do not differ much in sub-
stance when compared with perceptual analyses found 
in his more strictly philosophical writings. In fact, 
Husserl's 1930 "Nachwort" to the Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phanomenologie und phanomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 ( 1913) suggested that the work can be read 
either as transcendental philosophy or as descriptive 
psychology. In other writings, such as Die Krisis 
der europaischen Wissenschaften und die transzenden-
tale Phanomenologie ( 1936), Husserl suggested that 
the psychological-phenomenological reduction and the 
transcendentalphenomenological reduction are sepa-
rate and distinct, with only the latter demundaniz-
ing consciousness. The wide variety of complexi-
ties and seeming contradictions engendered between 
Husserl's versions ofthe psychological reduction were 
outJined scrupulousJy in JOSEPH J. KOCKELMANS' Ed-
mund Husserl s Phenomenologica/Psychology ( 1967), 
although they are not resolved by any means. 
It is interesting to note that from the start, pheno-
menology as practiced in psychology and PSYCHIA-
TRY was not involved in ironing out the philosoph-
ical complexities in its own field. Whether or not 
phenomenological-psychological reductions ought to 
be adapted from transcendental conceptions, they are 
nevertheless adapted. LUDWIG BINSWANGER, for exam-
ple, freely borrowed from Husserl 's constitutive the-
ory in accordance with criteria of usefulness, not 
theoretical cohesion. For example, in Melancholie 
und Manie. Phanomenologische Studien ( 1960), Bin-
swanger applied Husserl 's description of inner time-
consciousness, presumably a strictly transcendental 
description, to empirica! investigations of manic-
depressive psychopathology. Binswanger similarly 
borrowed from other phenomenologists. MARTIN HEI-
DEGGER's existentialist theories were as important as 
Husserl's constitutive approach. From a Heideggerian 
ground, Binswanger developed the ideas of Umwelt 
(the biologica! and physical world), Mitwelt (the so-
cial world), and Eigenwelt (self-consciousness). Each 
of these human worlds is govemed by its own prin-
ciples, even by its own time, he asserted. There is 
an objective time flowing in the Umwelt; a less stan-
dardized phenomenal psychological time that charac-
terizes our life in the social world; and finally, a kind 
oftimelessness to the Eigenwelt, with its transcenden-
tal dimension. Binswanger accused ali forms of deter-
ministic psychology, and especially Freudian PSYCHO-
ANALYSIS, of confusing the principles goveming those 
separate worlds and of reducing them from highest to 
lowest. Ultimately, Freudian psychoanalysis finds its 
explanations in the biologica! (id) root causes, that is, 
in the Umwelt. Psychological theories outside of psy-
choanalysis have been even more obviously rooted in 
Umwelt explanations. Binswanger attributed the fix-
ation of psychology with the past to its reliance on 
understanding the dynamics ofthe Umwelt. Past deter-
minants are less important in the psychological social 
relations, where future possibilities permeate life and 
expectation, and the past virtually loses itself in the 
transcendental moment of the Eigenwelt. (The use of 
HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY beginning with Hei-
degger has been urged in PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY.) 
Since Binswanger's beginning, phenomenological 
psychological theories ha ve become more and more en-
compassing, reunderstanding even biologica] embod-
iment in intentiona! rather than deterministic models. 
Beginning with MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY'S La struc-
ture du comportement (1942), even seemingly auto-
matic reflex behavior is understood as a lived, though 
not reflectively thematized, intentiona! response to a 
meaningful situation. Merleau-Ponty spent much ofhis 
analysis on Pavlov's classical conditioning, a leaming 
theory that sti li occupies the first chapters of psychol-
ogy textbooks today. For Merleau-Ponty, the classical 
conditioning process is manipulated so that the condi-
tioned subject must dissociate stimuli from the overall 
environment, and must in turn give a partial response, 
equally dissociated from the overall situation. Such 

PSYCHOLOGY 
579 
dissociation requires an act of intellectual effort if the 
conditioned subject is human, or a psychotic splitting 
if the conditioned subject is a dog. It is no wonder, 
Merleau-Ponty speculated, that the poor dogs eventu-
ally suffered from what Pavlov termed "experimental 
neurosis." 
In Phenomenological Psychology: Selected Papers 
(1966) ERWIN w. STRAUS, one ofthe young members of 
Binswanger's circle, continued the attack on Pavlovian 
reftexology, going so far as tocite Husserlian transcen-
dentalism as the necessary counterpoint that makes the 
objectivist stance in reflexology possible. Both stances 
are continuations of an impossible Cartesian dualism. 
There is neither a purely mechanical body nor a purely 
intentiona! consciousness, but rather an embodied lived 
becoming that can be described as a whole but cannot 
be unraveled in constitutive analyses, which would ul-
timately result in Cartesian splits. The subject who 
experiences, Straus wrote in his book on the senses, 
Vom Sinn der Sinne (Concerning the meaning of the 
senses, 1935), is not consciousness. Rather, the subject 
is embodied, involved, and "pathic." Even Heidegger's 
existentialized phenomenology missed this truth, he 
suggested, for Heidegger's "care" is too removed from 
the "animalia" of human existence, the biologica! im-
perative. 
In Der Menschliche (The human, 1958) FREDERIK 
J. 1. BUYTENDIJK -
a Dutch biologist influenced by 
French phenomenologists, including Merleau-Ponty 
and GABRIEL MARCEL (and aJso MAX SCHELER)- com-
pJemented Straus 's stress on the human animalia. Buy-
tendijk argued that human life must be understood as 
a part of the larger kingdom of animal life, in contrast 
to earlier phenomenologists more inclined to stress di-
mensions that distinguish human life from other life. 
Where Husserl was interested in cognition and math-
ematics, Buytendijk was interested in the phenomen-
ology of play, pain, or gender differences, ali dimen-
sions oflife we share with the animal kingdom at large. 
This is not to say that human gender differences mirror 
those of other species, only that, as animals, we will 
be expected to live those differences. For example, as 
animal beings our gender differences are fixed and can 
be described as fundamentally different structures of 
embodied intentionality, as they can be described for 
other members of the animal kingdom. In his book De 
Vrouw (Woman, 1958), Buytendijk focused on specific 
behaviors, such as styles ofwalking, to discern differ-
ences between male and female embodied intentiona! 
modes. His essentialism -
asserting that the female 
gait is naturally less aggressive and more flowing than 
the male gait, which aims to conquer- has won him 
much criticism from contemporary FEMINISM. 
Taking the intentiona! life of the subject to be real 
(wirklich) and embodied, even at the same time that 
it is constitutive of every real and embodied event, 
puts phenomenological psychology in the paradoxi-
cal but interesting vantage point of focusing on em-
pirica! psychological research of people's intentiona! 
lives. Husserl proposed this task for phenomenologi-
cal psychology in the Krisis. Through an "empathic 
understanding," the psychologist grasps the intentions 
of others, taking them as really occurring events in 
the natural world, yet constitutive of those people's 
worlds. The phenomenologically naive subjects under 
investigation intend a natural world in the natural at-
titude; yet the psychologist does not "co-perform" the 
"validity" of the acts, Husserl wrote, but neutralizes 
the acts and brackets the real world, thus performing a 
phenomenological reduction by way of empathy. 
But how do others' intentiona! lives offer them-
selves for empirica! phenomenological research? De-
spite its stress on embodiment, phenomenological psy-
chology has not found descriptions of the behaviors 
of others by other researchers to be sufficient. Often 
comportments reveal general attitudes (a person looks 
concerned, for example ), but noematic details ofthe ex-
perienced world are revealed mainly through what the 
other expresses in language. Phenomenological ciini-
cal psychologists had carried out case studies based on 
the remarks of patients in therapy, but it was not un tii 
ADRIAN VAN KAAM's Existential Foundations ofPsychol-
ogy ( 1966) that the informal technique was formalized 
as an empirica! research method. 
Duquesne University's psychology department, 
whose graduate program was initiated by Van Kaam, 
has continued to develop and diversify this method. 
The technique differs from statistica! psychology's 
"content analysis" of subjects' self-reports, where in-
stances ofword usages or categories ofword usages are 
simply counted. In contrast, phenomenological anal-
ysis of experiential self-reports emphasizes implicit 
meanings hidden in explicit expressions, emphasizes 
the importance of gestalt relationships between parts 

580 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
in determining meanings, and emphasizes the role of 
researchers' own imaginary variations in making sense 
out of the subjects' expressions. Although Husserl's 
account of the "apperception" of others (in Cartesian-
ische Meditationen [ 1931]) has been roundly criticized, 
his insistence that the intentionalities of others are 
given through an "analogical pai ring" performed by an 
observer has been supported by much phenomenologi-
cal psychological research. The role of a researcher's 
imaginati ve activity has been stressed by a number of 
recent researchers in phenomenological psychology. 
Generaliy, clinica! studies on psychopathology and 
psychotherapy have had more popular appeal in psy-
chology than have empirica! research studies, and 
phenomenological psychology is no exception. Despite 
Husserl 's original promotion of psychological theory, 
phenomenology achieved from the start a greater ap-
peal in the clinica! arena. Because of its emphasis onan 
empathic ratherthanjudgmental attitude in psychother-
apy, phenomenological approaches have had an espe-
cialiy profound inftuence on the variety ofhumanistic 
approaches, including Cari Rogers' On Becoming a 
Person ( 1961) and Abraham Maslow's Toward a Psy-
chology of Being ( 1968). Recently, Albert Margulies, 
in his book The Empathic Imagination (1989), con-
sidered wonder as a clinica! stance and means toward 
intersubjectivity and understanding of the essence of 
another. 
Binswanger must be credited with the initiation 
of clinica! phenomenological theory and practice, al-
though previously KARL JASPERS had employed pheno-
menological concepts sparingly. Binswanger, a student 
of Freud, was concerned with psychological dynam-
ics qua psychological, rejecting biologica! accounts of 
psychopathology. Unlike Freud, however, Binswanger 
equaliy rejected causal explanations involving uncon-
scious mechanics and energetics ~ 
psychoanalytical 
dynamics said tobe transcendent to consciousness, and 
therefore subject to the neutralization of the reduc-
tion. Instead, Binswanger understood the unconscious 
to be a marginal mode of consciousness-ambiguous, 
often confused, and difficult to reftect upon, but imma-
nent to consciousness nevertheless. Binswanger pro-
posed that even in this mysterious side, conscious-
ness is meaningful and makes a coherent whole that 
can be uncovered. Even the "uninteliigible" aspects 
of psychopathology that Jaspers had exempted from 
phenomenological analysis are in fact inteliigible when 
taken in the framework of the larger system of mean-
ings forming a patient's LIFEWORLD. In The Divided 
Se/((1960), R. o. LAING continued and radicalized Bin-
swanger's claim, viewing psychopathology as an en-
tirely meaningful response to a chaotic life situation. 
Binswanger's work on the unconscious was the first 
of many phenomenological attempts to evaluate and 
redefine psychoanalytical concepts. JAN HENDRIK VAN 
DEN BERG (A Dif.ferent Existence [ 1972]) continued the 
tradition, suggesting, first of ali, that we understand 
the patient's unconscious as "for" the therapist's con-
sciousness since the therapist is the one claiming to ex-
perience it. In many ways this is true ofpsychopathol-
ogy itself. The patient "suffers" from the psychother-
apist's point ofview, van den Berg wrote. In addition, 
he examined many psychoanalytical defense "mech-
anisms," de-mechanizing them by casting them in an 
intentiona! light. For example, projection (in the psy-
choanalytical sense) can be understood as the inftuence 
of a person's project (in the existential sense) on the 
way the person constitutes the psychological meanings 
forming the lifeworld. More recently, Richard Ches-
sick's What Constitutes the Patient in Psychotherapy 
(1992) continues van den Berg's stress on empathy and 
deftly weaves the works of severa! phenomenological 
and post-Freudian thinkers together in order to question 
the disparity between therapist as subject and patient 
as object tobe known, in light ofthe fact that both are 
human subjects. 
Finaliy, the role of freedom and choice has been 
central to clinica! phenomenological psychology. Inftu-
enced by Sartre's and Heidegger's ontologica! descrip-
tions, phenomenological psychotherapists have coun-
tered psychoanalytic and behavioristic determinisms 
with an existential glorification of freedom. VIKTOR 
FRANKL's "logotherapy," outlined in Ein Psycholog er-
lebt das Konzentrationslager (A psychologist lived 
through the concentration camp, 1946), revolved 
around the importance of human freedom to consti-
tute meaning with regard to ali aspects of life. With 
dramatic illustrations taken from his own experience 
as a prisoner, Frankl insisted that the will to live is, 
phenomenologically, the will to invest positive mean-
ing in even the most chaotic or horrendous situations. 
Positive values can be constituted in any and ali of 
life 's circumstances, and the ro le of psychotherapy is 

PSYCHOLOGY 
581 
to open the way for patients to choose positive mean-
ingful values in their lives. 
Following Heidegger's early work, Rollo May 
(1909-1994) (The DiscoveryofBeing [1986] andFree-
dom and Destiny [ 1981]) also focused on human free-
dom in psychopathology and psychotherapy, relating 
it to issues ofanxiety. For May, the goal ofpsychother-
apy is not necessarily to reduce anxiety. There is an 
inauthentic anxiety arising from flights from freedom, 
and such anxiety is indeed harmful to human growth. 
But there is an authentic anxiety as well, arising from a 
realization of personal freedom. It is not the task ofpsy-
chotherapy to tranquilize this latter anxiety because it 
serves a positive ro le as the background against which 
an energized human becoming is highlighted. 
Overall, clinica! phenomenological psychology has 
been an eclectic enterprise, beginning with Bin-
swanger, and becoming even more so today. Many 
phenomenological clinicians take the phenomenologi-
cal reduction tobe an opening to a theory-free clinica! 
approach; oddly, that attitude often results in an appre-
ciation for and absorption of a wide variety of clini-
ca! theories and approaches, always with the goal of 
grounding those approaches in a lifeworldly descrip-
tion. It is ironic that out of Husserl 's concern with 
developing a pure and self-consistent phenomenologi-
cal theory there has grown a clinica! approach that is 
one of the most eclectic in ali of psychology.

READING 
A phenomenological description 
of the act of reading presupposes an EIDETIC METHOD, 
including a bracketing of ali actual reading experiences 
in order to grasp the patterns that structure the read-
ing process. Such an abstractive and self-restraining 
attitude, as a basic requirement for phenomenologi-
cal investigation, allows us to delineate the operations 
that occur in the reading process through which a text 
is a NOEMA correlative to the reader's consciousness. 
In contradistinction to given objects in our ordinary 
world, which can generally be viewed or at least con-
ceived as a whole, a text of more than severa! words 
can never be perceived at any one time in its entirety. 
The "intended" object ofthe text can only be imagined 
by way of different consecutive phases of reading. The 
relation between text and reader is therefore quite dif-
ferent from that between object and observer: instead 
of a subject-object relationship, it is a viewpoint that 
moves along inside that which is to be apprehended. 
The reader's wandering viewpoint is, at one and the 
same time, caught up in and transcended by the in-
tended object to be apprehended. Apperception can 
only take place in phases, each of which contains as-
pects ofthe intended object tobe constituted, but none 
of which can claim to be representative of it. Thus 
the object cannot be identified with any of its mani-
festations during the time-flow ofreading. The incom-
pleteness of each manifestation necessitates syntheses, 
which occur in every phase ofthe journey ofthe wan-
dering viewpoint. 
At the sentence level, what is known as the "eye-
voice span" designates that portion of the text which 
can be encompassed during each phase of reading and 
from which we anticipate the next one. The syntactic 
units of sentences are residual "chunks" for perception 
that join in diverse ways to form semantic units of a 
higher order. The sentences themselves, as statements 
and assertions, serve to point a way toward what is 
to come, and this in turn is prestructured by the actual 
content ofthe sentences. Thus a process is set in motion 
that willlead to the formation ofthe intended object as 
a correlative in the mind ofthe reader. 
In describing the inner consciousness of time, ED-
MUND HUSSERL once wrote: "Every originally con-
stituent process is inspired by protentions, which con-
struct and collect the seed ofwhat is to come, as such, 
and bring it to fruition." The semantic pointers of in-
dividual sentences always imply an EXPECTATION of 
some kind ~ Husserl calls these immediate expec-
tations "protentions." This structure is inherent in ali 
sentences, from which it follows that their interplay 
willlead not so much to the fulfillment of expectations 
as to their continuai modification. Since each sentence 
aims at things to come, the prefigured horizon will of-
fer a view ~ 
however concrete it may be ~ 
that must 
contain indeterminacies, and so arouse expectations as 
to the manner in which these are to be resolved. 
As far as the sequence of sentences is concerned, 
there are two fundamentally different possibilities. If 
the new sentence begins to confirm the expectations 
aroused by its predecessor, the range of possible se-
mantic horizons will be correspondingly narrowed. 
This is normally the case with expository texts that are 
to describe a particular object, for their concern is to 
narrow the range in order to bring out the individuality 
ofthat object. In LITERA TURE, however, the sequence of 
sentences is structured in such a way that expectations 
are either modified or frustrated. Consequently, they 
have an automatically retroactive effect on what has 
already been read, which now appears quite different. 
Thus every moment ofreading is a dialectic ofproten-
tion and retention, conveying a future horizon yet to 
be occupied along with a past (and continually fading) 
horizon already filled; the wandering viewpoint carves 
its passage through both at the same time and leaves 
them to merge together in its wake. There is no escap-
ing this process, as the text cannot at any one moment 
be grasped as a whole. 
The sentences of a text are always situated within 
a perspective, which is most easily observed in Iiter-
ary texts and depends on whether the utterances are 
made by the author, the narrator, or the characters. Al-
though each text is perspectively organized, the wan-
dering viewpoint is not confined to any one of these 
perspectives. On the contrary, it constantly switches 
between these perspectives on the text, each of the

switches representing an articulate reading moment: 
it simultaneously offsets and relates the perspectives. 
But if the wandering viewpoint defines itself by way 
of the changing perspectives, it follows that the past 
perspectiva! segments must be retained in each present 
moment throughout the reading. The new moment is 
not isolated, but stands out against the old, and so the 
past will remain as a background to the present, exert-
ing influence on it and, at the same time, being itself 
modified by the present. 
The wandering viewpoint permits the reader to 
travel through a text, thus unfolding a multiplicity 
of interconnecting perspectives that are offset when-
ever there is a switch from one to another. This gives 
rise to a network of possible connections. These are 
characterized by the fact that they do not join isolated 
data from the different perspectives, but actually estab-
lish a relationship of reciproca! observation between 
stimulant and stimulated perspectives. This network of 
connections potentially encompasses the whole text, 
but the potential can never be fully realized; instead 
it forms the hasis for the many selections that have 
to be made during the process and that, although in-
tersubjectively not identica!, remain nevertheless in-
tersubjectively comprehensible insofar as they are ali 
attempts to optimize the same structure. 
The wandering viewpoint is a means of describing 
the way in which the reader is present in the text. This 
presence is at a point where MEMORY and expectation 
converge. The interaction between the two provokes 
the reader into a synthesizing activity. These syntheses, 
then, are primarily groupings that bring the interrelated 
perspectives together into an equivalence that has the 
character of a configurative MEANING. The wandering 
viewpoint divides the text up into interacting structures 
and these give rise to a grouping activity that is fun-
damental to the grasping of a text. The nature of this 
process is shown clearly by a remark of E. H. Gom-
brich in Art and Illusion (1 962): "In the reading of 
images, as in the hearing of speech, it is always hard 
to distinguish what is given to us from what we sup-
plement in the process ofprojection which is triggered 
off by recognition: ... it is the guess of the beholder 
that tests the medley of forms and colors for coherent 
meaning, crystallizing it into shape when a consistent 
interpretation has been found." 
The consistent gestalt endows the linguistic signs 
with their significance, and this grows out ofthe recip-
roca! modifications to which the individual positions 
are subjected due to the need for establishing equiva-
lences between the signs. The consistent gestalt might 
be described, in terms used by ARON GURWITSCH, as the 
perceptual noema of the text. This means that, since 
each linguistic sign conveys more thanjust itselfto the 
mind ofthe reader, it must be joined together in a single 
unit with ali its referential contexts. The unit ofthe per-
ceptual noema comes about by way ofthe reader's acts 
of apprehension: the reader identifies the connections 
between the linguistic signs and thus concretizes the 
references not explicitly manifested in those signs. The 
perceptual noema therefore links up the signs, their im-
plications, their reciproca! influences, and the reader's 
act of identification, and through it the text begins to 
exist as a gestalt in the reader's consciousness. 
Through gestalt-forming, we are caught up in the 
very state of affairs we are produc ing. This is why we 
often ha ve the impression, as we read, that we are living 
another life. For Henry James, this "illusion of having 
lived another life" was the most striking quality in 
reading narrative prose. This entanglement, however, 
is never total, because the gestalts remain at least po-
tentially under attack from those possibilities that they 
ha ve excluded but dragged along in their wake. Indeed, 
the latent disturbance ofthe reader's involvement pro-
duces a specific form of ten sion that leaves the reader 
suspended, as it were, between total entanglement and 
latent detachment. Such an involvement is a precondi-
tion for converting the text into an experience. MAURICE 
MERLEAU-PONTY once remarked in Phimomenologie de 
la perception ( 1945): "It is true that we should never 
talk about anything if we are limited to talking about 
those experiences with which we coincide." 
Experiences arise only when the familiar is tran-
scended or undermined; they grow out ofthe alteration 
or falsification ofwhat is already ours. G. B. Shaw once 
wrote: "You have leamt something. That always feels 
at first as if you had lost something." Reading shares 
its structure with that of experience to the extent that 
our entanglement has the effect of pushing our various 
criteria of orientation back into the past, thus suspend-
ing their validity for the new present. This does not 
mean, however, that our previous experiences disap-
pear altogether. On the contrary, our past sti li remains 
our experience, but what happens now is that it begins 

584 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
to interact with the as yet unfamiliar presence of the 
text. This remains unfamiliar so long as our previous 
experiences are precisely as they had been before we 
began our reading. But in the course of the reading 
these experiences will also change, for the acquisition 
of experience is nota matter of adding on- it is rather 
a restructuring of what we already possess. This can 
be seen onan everyday level; we say, for instance, that 
we have benefited from an experience when we mean 
that we ha ve lost an illusion. 
The acts of apprehension brought about by the wan-
dering viewpoint organize the transfer of the text into 
the reader's conscious mind. This happens by the for-
mation of syntheses through which connections be-
tween signs are identified and their equivalences rep-
resented. These syntheses are of an unusual kind. They 
are neither manifested in the printed text, nor produced 
solely by the reader's IMAGINATION, and the projections 
of which they consist are themselves of a dual na-
ture: they emerge from the reader, but they are also 
guided by what the signals of the text stimulate. It is 
extremely difficult to gauge where the signals leave 
offand the reader's imagination begins in this process, 
thus blurring the distinction between subject and object 
out ofwhich a complex reality arises. This "reality" is 
complex not just because the signals can only take 
on their full significance through the projections of a 
subject, but also because syntheses take place below 
the threshold of consciousness. Since they are formed 
quite independently of conscious observation, we shall 
call them- in Husserl's terms- passive syntheses 
in order to distinguish them from those resulting from 
predications andjudgments. Passive syntheses are pre-
predicative and, because they are subconscious, we 
continue to produce them throughout our reading. 
The basic element ofthese passive syntheses is the 
image, which MIKEL DUFRENNE describes as a "middle 
term between the brute presence where the object is 
experienced and the thought where it becomes idea" 
so that "it allows the object to appear, to be present as 
represented." Such an imagery is something that ac-
companies our reading and it is not itselfthe object of 
our attention, even when these images link up into a 
whole panorama. This panorama unfolds itselfthrough 
a continuai change of imagery. Whenever new infor-
mation has to be accomodated, the image previously 
formed is discarded and replaced by a new o ne. The se-
quence of ideation develops by dropping and building 
ever new images, each of which, however, bears the 
imprint of the one it has supplanted. In this peculiar 
way the imagination "shows itself to be productive: 
this is the only case where it creates something truly 
new in ideation- namely, the temporal quality." Each 
individual image therefore emerges against the back-
ground of a past image, which is thereby given its posi-
tion in the overall continuity. The time axis that is thus 
produced basically conditions and arranges the overall 
meaning by making each image recede into the past 
and subjecting it to inevitable modifications which, in 
turn, bring forth the new image. 
Consequently, ali images cohere in the reader's 
mind by a constant accumulation ofreferences, which 
develop like a snowball. It is therefore difficult, if not 
impossible, to isolate individual phases ofthis process 
and ca li them the meaning or INTENTIONALITY of the text, 
because meaning in fact stretches out over the whole 
sequence of eide. Meaning itself, then, has a temporal 
character, the peculiarity of which is revealed by the 
fact that the articulation of the text into past, present, 
and future by the wandering viewpoint does not result 
in fading memories and arbitrary expectations, but in 
an uninterrupted synthesis of ali the time-phases. As 
the images take on their time dimension and are trans-
formed through ideation into transient objects, there 
arises a tendency to relate these objects to one another 
as and when they form along the time axis. 
When we imagine, for instance, the hero of Henry 
Fielding's Tom Jones during our reading ofthe novel, 
we must put together various facets that were revealed 
to us at different times. Such an interlinking, however, 
is not additive. The different facets always contain ref-
erences to others, and each view of the character only 
gains its significance through being related to other 
views, which may overlap, restrict, or modify it. It fol-
lows that our image of Tom Jones cannot be pinned 
down to one particular view, because each facet is sub-
ject to modification by others. Our imagery is therefore 
constantly shifting, and every image we have is duly 
restructured by each of its successors. We are most 
aware of this process when the hero 's con duct is not 
what we had expected; the facets appear to clash, but 
we must incorporate the new circurnstances- which 
means retrospectively to change our past images. In 
imagining the character, we do not try to seize upon 

READING 
585 
one particular aspect, but we are made to view him 
as a synthesis of ali aspects. The image produced is 
therefore always more than the facet given in any one 
particular reading moment. Obviously, then, the image 
of Tom Jones cannot be identica! to any ofthese facets; 
they only provide individual items ofknowledge given 
along the time axis ofreading, out ofwhich an overall 
image ofthe character has tobe formed. 
Since meaning develops along the TIME axis, time it-
self cannot function as a frame of reference, and hen ce 
it follows that each concretization ofmeaning results in 
a highly individual experience ofthat meaning, which 
can never be totally repeated in its identica! form. A 
second reading ofthe text will never have the same ef-
fect as the first, for the simple reason that the originally 
assembled meaning is bound to influence the second 
reading. The sequence of image-building is overshad-
owed by what has been produced in the first instance, 
which inevitably has repercussions on the way images 
qualify and condition each other in the time-flow of 
our reading. With each new reading, it is only the time 
dimension that changes, but this alone is enough to 
change the images, for it is their position along the 
time axis that initiates processes of differentiation and 
combination. This position endows them with ali their 
references and enables them to establish their own in-
dividual stability. As Husserl once put it, the position in 
time is the "fountainhead of individuality." Since the 
time position is not in itself determinate, it provides 
the foundation necessary for the individuality of each 
meaning realized. 
The temporal character of the reading process acts 
as a kind of catalyst for the passive syntheses through 
which the meaning of the text forms itself in the 
reader's mind. Passive syntheses differ from predica-
tive ones in that they are not judgments. Unlike judg-
ments, which are independent oftime, passive synthe-
ses take place along the time axis of reading. The ex-
pression "passive synthesis" would be a contradiction 
in terms if it merely denoted processes of acceptance 
and composition that took place automatically below 
the threshold of consciousness. The schematic descrip-
tion of the constitutive process reveals the extent to 
which the reader is involved in composing images out 
of the multifarious aspects of the text by unfolding 
them into a sequence of ideation and by integrating the 
resulting products along the time axis ofreading. Thus 
text and reader are linked together, the one permeating 
the other. We place our synthesizing faculties at the 
disposal of an unfamiliar reality, produce the meaning 
ofthat reality, and in so doing enter into situations that 
we could not have created out of ourselves. Thus the 
meaning ofthe text can only be fulfilled in the reading 
subject and does not exist independently ofhim or her; 
it is just as important, though, that the reader, in consti-
tuting the meaning, is him- or herself also constituted. 
Herein !ies the full significance ofthe so-called passive 
synthesis. 
This experience is what underlies the reader's de-
sire to comprehend the significance of the meaning. 
The inevitable quest for the significance shows that in 
assembling the meaning, we ourselves become aware 
that something has happened to us, and so we try to find 
out its significance. Meaning and significance are not 
the same thing, as GOTTLOB FREGE has pointed out: "The 
fact that o ne has grasped a meaning does not yet makc it 
certain that one has a significance." The significance of 
meaning can only be ascertained when the meaning is 
related to a particular reference, which makes it trans-
latable into familiar terms. As PAUL RICCEUR has stated 
with regard to ideas advanced by Frege and Husserl: 
"There are two distinct stages of comprehension: the 
stage of 'meaning' ... and the stage of 'significance,' 
which represents the active taking-over of the mean-
ing by the reader- i.e., the meaning taking effect in 
existence." It follows that the intersubjective structure 
of meaning-assembly can ha ve many forms of signif-
icance, depending on the social and cultural code or 
the individual norms that underlie the formation ofthis 
significance. Now subjective dispositions play a vital 
ro le in each realization ofthis intersubjective structure, 
but every subjective realization remains accessible to 
INTERSUBJECTIYITY precisely because it shares the same 
intersubjective structure as its basis; however, the sig-
nificance ascribed to the meaning, and the subsequent 
absorption of the meaning into existence, can only be-
come open to intersubjective discussion if the codes 
and conventions that ha ve guided the interpretati an of 
the meaning are revealed. It is important, however, 
that the distinction between meaning and significance 
should be maintained, for these are two separate stages 
of comprehension. Meaning is the referential totality 
that is implied by the aspects contained in the text and 
that must be assembled in the course of reading. Sig-

his or her own existence.

REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY 
This tradition 
was founded in the first years ofthis century by a group 
of students of the philosopher-psychologist Theodor 
Lipps (1851-1914) in the University ofMunich. The 
members of the group had been inspired to rebel against 
their teacher Lipps, a proponent of PSYCHOLOGISM, by 
a certain JOHANNES DAUBERT, a talented organizer who 
had read EDMUND HUSSERL 's Logische Untersuchungen 
( 1900-1901) and had persuaded his fellow students to 
accept this work as their philosophical bible. The term 
"phenomenological movement" was in fact first used 
by the group around Daubert to describe its activities, 
and already in 1900 ALEXANDER PFĂNDER pubJished his 
Phănomenologie des Wollens, a work written under 
Lipps's direction that reveals many ofthe characteristic 
features oflater works in realistic phenomenology. 
To understand the phenomenology of the Munich 
school it is useful to distinguish two strands within 
Husserl's own thinking. On the one hand is the strand 
-
represented by the slogan "Back to the matters them-
selves!"- of "phenomenological description." This 
yields an object-oriented phenomenology that holds 
that we are in possession of a priori (which is to say: 
non-inductive) knowledge relating to certain funda-
mental structures in a wide range of different spheres of 
objects (for example, colors, tones, values, shapes ). On 
the other hand is the strand of act-oriented phenomen-
ology presented most clearly in Jdeen zu einer reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologischen Philoso-
phie I ( 191 3) and drawing to some degree on German 
idealist sources. Both strands are already present in 
the Logische Untersuchungen and both draw on work 
in metaphysics and on the descriptive psychology of 
FRANZ BRENTANO and his followers. 
The Munich realists, now, remained faithful to the 
descriptive strand of object-oriented phenomenology 
and they rejected what they saw as the move to "tran-
scendental idealism" in Husserl's !ater writings. They 
preserved an interest in the work of Brentano and his 
school and in wider contemporary developments in 
logic, linguistics, and empirica! and theoretical psy-
chology, and they also followed Brentanians such as 
Alexius Meinong (1853-1920) in defending a realis-
tic theory of values and of our knowledge of values. 
Realistic phenomenology thus has important roots in 
AUSTRIA. 
The historical importance ofthe Munich group can 
be seen in the fact that phenomenology became impor-
tant in Gottingen only after members of the Munich 
group, and especially ADOLF RFINACH, had moved to 
join Husserl there, where they served to propagandize 
the latter's ideas and to assist in making them accessi-
ble to new generations of students. (HERBERT SPIEGEL-
BERG refers in this connection to the "Munich invasion 
of Gottingen.") Of the fi ve initial editors of Husserl 's 
Jahrbuch, four- ALEXANDER PFĂNDER, MORITZ GEIGER,

nich. Of these, Pfander ( 1870--1941) is most famil-
iar as the author of a phenomenological logic and of 
work in descriptive psychology on willing, motivation, 
etc. (Herbert Spiegelberg is the most prominent among 
his students.) Geiger is the author of work on pheno-
menological AESTHETICS, on EMOTIONS, and on the a 
priori foundations of geometry as a science of essen-
tial structures of space. Scheler is the author of Der 
Formalismus in der Ethik und die materiale Wertethik 
(Formalism in ethics and nonformal ethics of value, 
191311916), a defence of value realism and a critique 
of Kantian "formalist" ethics that also includes a de-
tai led treatment of the aprioristic methodology of the 
Munich school. Reinach was the author of a work en-
titled "Die apriorisichen Grundlagen des blirgerlichen 
Rechts" (The a priori foundations of civillaw), a con-
tribution to the phenomenology of law and to the on-
tologica! foundations of the social sciences that was 
published in the first volume of Husserl 's Jahrbuch 
in 1913. The work presents in particular a theory of 
promising and ofrelated "social acts," and offers a re-
markable anticipation of the !ater work on speech act 
theory of John Austin ( 1911-1960) and John Searle. 
Other first generation members ofthe Munich group 
were THEODOR CON RAD, AUGUST GALLINGER, and WILHELM 
SCHAPP. The second generation ofthe realist phenomen-
ological movement inciuded: THEODOR CELMS, HEDWIG 
CONRAD-MARTIUS, ERICH HEINRICH, DIETRICH VON HILDE-
BRAND, AUREL KOLNAI, EDITH STEIN, and KURT STAVEN-
HAGEN, as well as the already mentioned Spiegelberg. 
ROMAN INGARDEN, too, was allied with the Munich re-
alists and was responsible for some ofthe most impor-
tant criticisms of Husserl 's turn to idealism. Common 
to ali of these thinkers is the attempt to describe in 
painstaking fashion -
in a way that is opposed to ali 
reductionism -
the fundamental ontologica! princi-
ples governing different spheres, whether in LANGUAGE, 
LAW, ACTION, PERCEPTION, AESTHETICS, VALUE, POLITICS, 
or RELIGION. Ingarden took realist phenomenology to 
POLAND, where it had an inftuence also on the philo-
sophical thinking of the young KAROL WOJTYLA and is 
exemplified in the latter's work on Scheler. 
Contemporary philosophers allied with realistic 
phenomenology include Roderick Chisholm, J. N. FIND-
LAY, WLODZIMIERZ GALEWICZ, GUIDO KUNG, KEVIN MUL-
LIGAN, OI ETER MUNCH, ANDRZEJ POL TAWSKI, KARL SCHUH-
MANN (the historian of the movement), PETER SIMONS, 
BARRY SMITH, ROBERT SOKOLOWSKI, DALLAS WILLARD, 
DAVID WOODRUFF SMITH, and WOJCIECH ZELANIEC. As will 
be clear, realistic phenomenology is set apart from !ater 
phenomenological schools by its closeness to certain 
tendencies in AngJo-American ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY. 
This holds most conspicuously of Reinach's work on 
speech act theory and on the foundations of logic. The 
value realism ofthe Munich phenomenologists recalls 
the ethical work ofG. E. Moore (1873-1958), and their 
work on essences recalls more recent work in the ana-
lytic tradition on essentialism and natural kinds and on 
the "universals" of language and cognition. 
That Daubert's work is little known follows from 
the fact that his many shorthand manuscripts, which re-
mained unpublished in his lifetime, ha ve only recently, 
through a massive effort directed by Karl Schuhmann, 
been brought into readable form. Daubert's critique of 
Husserl's idealistic turn rests on the thesis that con-
sciousness functions in a normal way precisely when 
it "hits" an object, above ali in veridical perception. 
Consciousness is then- for Daubert as for JEAN-PAUL 
SARTRE- exhausted in this relation to an object. It can 
be substantivized as an EGO only by becoming deprived 
of this, its original function- for example through a 
special "phenomenological reduction": only when con-
sciousness withdraws from contact with reality does it 
acquire a pseudo-being of its own. 
This entanglement of consciousness with reality-
to the detailed elucidation ofwhich many ofDaubert's 
manuscripts are dedicated- makes it impossible for 
phenomenology to achieve any "pure" description of 
an "absolute" consciousness. Husserl's (Cartesian) ar-
gument in Ideen 1 to the effect that where one thing 
can turn out to be a hallucination, nothing will be safe 
against this possibility, is countered by Daubert with 
the thesis -
since familiar from the work of MAU-
RICE MERLEAU-PONTY, Wittgenstein, and Austin- that 
doubt, error, and hallucination make sense only when 
seen against the general background of the veridical 
awareness of reality. A single abject of consciousness 
might turn out not to be real, "but only with regard to 
the standard of reality itself." 
Further contributions to our understanding of the 
inextricable entanglement of consciousness and world 
are to be found in the work of Daubert, Reinach, 
Pfander, and Ingarden on facts and states ofaffairs. Al-
ready Husserl had seen in the Logische Untersuchun-

588 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
gen that genuine, veridical ("fulfilled") experience of 
reality is possible not only via PERCEPTION but also via 
judgment. The world itself (the realm of the "matters 
themselves") is correspondingly organized not merely 
in terms ofthe objects, qualities, events, and processes 
that are given (for example) in perception, but also in 
terms of the states of affairs that make our judgments 
true. Pfander distinguishes in his Logik ( 1921) two va-
rieties of judgment-correlate: the intentiona! Sachver-
halt that is "projected" in dynamic fashion and simulta-
neously posited as real through the act ofjudgment; and 
the "Selbstverhalten des Gegenstands" on the side of 
the object itself- a segment of reality that is "thrown 
into relief' through the given act. A judgment is true 
precisely when its intentiona! state of affairs stands in 
perfect coincidence with the corresponding "disposi-
tion of the things" on the side of the object. LOGIC, 
accordingly, as scicnce oftruth and falsehood, must be 
built on the theory of Sachverhalte as its basis, and a 
conception of the laws of logic as "nothing other than 
general principles expressing relations between states 
of affairs" was worked out in detail by Reinach in his 
essay "Zur Theorie des negativen Urteils" of 1911. 
It was against the background ofthis work on logic, 
language, and intentiona! directedness that Reinach 
put forward in 1913 the first systematic theory of 
the phenomena of promis ing, questioning, requesting, 
commanding, accusing, etc., phenomena that he him-
self collects together under the heading "social acts." 
Reinach's work provides a rich taxonomy ofthe vari-
ous different speech act varieties and of their possible 
modifications. It contains a detailed treatment of the 
quasi-legal status of speech acts and of the relations 
between legal and ethical obligations and also of the 
relations between the a priori laws governing social 
formations of different sorts and the enactments of 
lawmakers. It also contains a discussion of one feature 
of speech acts that seems hardly to ha ve been dealt with 
in the !ater Anglo-American literature- that feature 
whereby such actions may be performed by proxy, as 
when an action of promis ing or commanding or invit-
ing is carried out by one person in the name of another. 
Husserl had distinguished in the Logische Unter-
suchungen between the "quality" and "ideal content" 
o fan act-thus, for example, between the quality of an 
act of judgment and its ideal content (as a judgment to 
the effect that snow is white, that Fritz is saluting, etc.). 
.Such ideal contents or "propositions" can be abstractly 
discriminated in contexts of quite different sorts. Thus 
we canjudge that a given proposition is truc; but we 
can also regret that it is true, and we can wish or doubt 
or hypothesize that it be true, and so on. As Pfander 
pointed out in his Logik, there is a veri table plethora of 
"propositional formations" that result thereby. He men-
tions questions, assertions, reports, thankings, recom-
mendings, requests, warnings, aliowings, promisings, 
invitings, summonings, incitements, prescribings, or-
ders, decrees, prohibitions, commands, laws -
ali of 
which share with judgments the fact that their ideal 
contents are propositional in nature. 
By developing a scientific taxonomy of such propo-
sitional formations, the Munich phenomenologists 
were able to develop a theory of the communicative 
aspects of language more sophisticated than that of 
Husserl, who was to some degree blind to the phenom-
ena in question by virtue ofhis insistence that language 
and linguistic meaning is present in unmodified form 
even in silent speech. 
Reinach's own work on speech act theory was inftu-
enced not only by the work of Husserl and his Munich 
colieagues, but also by his background as a student of 
LAW, which helped him to do justice to the legal and 
normative aspects of the phenomenon of promising, 
aspects that had been neglected in traditional accounts 
(for example, ofHume and Lipps). The latter had seen 
the action of promising either as the expression of an 
act ofwili oras the declaration of an intention to act in 
the interests ofthe party in whose fa vor this declaration 
is made. The most obvious inadequacy ofthis account 
is that it throws no light on the problem of how an 
utterance of the given sort can give rise to a mutualiy 
correlated obligation and claim on the part ofpromisor 
and promisee. The bare intention to do something has, 
after ali, no quasi-legal consequences of this sort, and 
it is difficult to see why things should be different in 
reftection of the fact that such an intention is brought 
to expression in language. 
Reinach's thesis, now, is that to do justice to phe-
nomena such as claim and obligation, it is necessary to 
recognize that speech acts are not built up out of inde-
pendently existing (mental and linguistic) parts: they 
are structures of a new sort, within which mental and 
linguistic aspects can be distinguished only abstractly 
(and not as separable elements). Such structures are 

REALISTIC PHENOMENLOGY 
589 
marked further by the fact that they demand an alien 
subject toward whom they are directed and by the fact 
that the utterance-aspect must of necessity be regis-
tered or grasped by the subject in question. A promise 
ora command must be received and understood by the 
one to whom it is addressed (something that does not 
apply, for example, to an act ofblessing, forgiving, or 
cursing). 
A promise, then, cannot be identica! with the expres-
sion or intimation of an act of will or of an intention, 
because some of the acts that underlie a promise are 
such that they are simply not able to exist outside the 
compass of a whole of just this sort. And similarly 
there is no independent and self-contained mental ex-
perience that is somehow brought to expression in the 
issuing of a command. Hen ce, a fortiori, social acts of 
these kinds cannot be mere reports of such experiences. 
Reinach's treatment of speech act phenomena thus 
belongs neither to the province of logic or philoso-
phy of language nor to the philosophy of law or to the 
theory of action. Rather, his work shows that speech 
acts and related phenomena are structures of a tran-
scategorial sort, so that their proper treatment would 
require a theory embracing within a single frame not 
merely the linguistic and logica! aspects, but also the 
psychological, legal, and action-theoretic dimensions 
of the phenomena in question. There is, now, a com-
mon tendency within the history of philosophy to seek 
to reduce transcategorial structures down to one single 
dimension. It can be seen at work in the "methodologi-
cal soJipsism" of CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY, which 
seeks to reduce ali phenomena to the single dimension 
of"constituting consciousness." But it is at work also in 
the tendency among analytic philosophers to conceive 
claims, obligations, values, etc., as mere reflections of 
our ways of speaking. This tendency was resisted by 
the Munich phenomenologists. 
From the realistic perspective the world contains 
promisings, commands, claims, obligations, etc., just 
as it contains instances ofbiological and logica! species 
such as !ion and tiger or judging and inferring. As 
Husserl saw in the third ofhis Logische Untersuchun-
gen, the species that people the world can be divided 
into two sorts. On the one hand are independent species 
whose instances require specific instantiations of no 
other species in order to exist. Lion might be taken as 
an example of an independent species in this sense. On 
the other hand are dependent species whose instances 
donot exist in and ofthemselves but only in association 
with instances of complementary species of determi-
nate sorts. And then, as Husserl emphasized, the rela-
tions of complementation here are not arbitrary; rather, 
they reflect "firmly determined relations of necessity 
... which vary with the species of dependent contents 
and accordingly prescribe one sort of completion to 
one ofthem, another sort of completion to another." 
Judging is an example of a dependent species in 
Husserl's sense: a judging exists only as the judging of 
some specific subject (as a smile smiles only in a human 
face). Promising, too, is an example of a dependent 
species. Here, however, we see that the dependence 
is multifold: a promise requires that there be also at 
least the species claim, obligation, utterance, and reg-
istering act, reticulated together with language-using 
subjects within the framework of a single whole of a 
quite specific transcategorial sort. Moreover, the men-
tal acts that underlie a promise are themselves such that 
they are not able to exist outside the compass of such 
a whole. Hence we have to deal here with a relation 
oftwo-sided dependence: the promise is as a matter of 
necessity such that it cannot exist except in association 
with an intending act, but this intending act is itself of a 
special (promising) sort and is as a matter ofnecessity 
of such a nature that it can exist only in the framework 
of the given whole. It is only superficially similar to 
an intending act of the sort that can exist outside the 
framework of a promise. 
Promising involves, then, a ccrtain sort of complex 
structure in reality. Each such structure will consist of 
instances of given species reticulated together in spe-
cific ways. Such structures can be understood on two 
distinct levels. On the one hand they exist in re, i.e., to 
the extent that their constituent species are instantiated 
here and now in some region of empirica! reality. On 
the other hand, however, they are from the structural 
point of view always structures among the correspond-
ing species, and the latter may be realized, in principle, 
at any time or place. In this respect they have the char-
acter of universals, and the dependence relations that 
tie them together ha ve the character not of contingent 
associations, but of necessary laws. 
The structures in question are therefore both neces-
sary and universal. Now as is well known, KANT had 
specified "necessity and strict universality" as "sure 

590 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
and certain marks" ofthe a priori that "belong together 
inextricably." His remarks to this effect are of course 
formulated within the wider context ofhis own episte-
mological theory ofthe a priori. The Munich phenome-
nologists, however, turn the tab les on Kant, exploiting 
the features of necessity and strict universality as the 
hasis of an ontologica! theory ofwhat they caii "a priori 
structures" or "essential connections" (Wesenszusam-
menhănge or Wesensgesetze). Such structures do in-
deed have certain epistemological peculiarities. That 
a promise cannot exist except in association with a 
mutually correlated claim and obligation is something 
we know not merely through experiment and induc-
tion ("aposteriori," in the usual epistemological sense 
of this term), but rather because the relation in ques-
tion possesses an intrinsic intelligibility of its own: it 
can be grasped immediately, in the way that we grasp, 
for example, that a triangle is not a circle, that blue is 
not a shape, or that nothing can be simultaneously red 
and green ali over. This, however, is for realist phe-
nomenologists a consequence of their necessity and 
universality as ontologically conceived. 
At the core ofrealistic phenomenology,now, !ies the 
thesis that such intelligible, universal, and necessary 
structures may caii forth entire disciplines of an a priori 
sort. The family of such disciplines includes much of 
logic and mathematics, as well as Reinach 's a priori 
theory of law. And it includes also what Husserl and 
his Munich followers called "phenomenology."

REASON 
Reason is an issue that leads to 
the core of EDMUND HUSSERL'S CONSTITUTIVE PHENO-
MENOLOGY. His phenomenological analysis of reason 
can be found in Part IV of the Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologischen Philoso-
phie I (1913) and in the third of the Cartesianische 
Meditationen [ 1931]. The place of these parts in both 
books indicates that the phenomenology of reason is 
the final stage of the analysis of intentiona! acts and 
of active synthesis. In the Third Meditation Husserl in 
addition points out that essential parts of the pheno-
menology of reason had to be used naively in the 
considerations preparing the first exposition of the 
transcendental-phenomenological reduction. A correct 
and complete understanding ofthe concepts used in the 
development of the transcendental-phenomenological 
reduction is possible only with the aid ofthe corrobo-
rated phenomenology of reason. This is not a vicious 
circle.lt is possible to developa phenomenology ofrea-
son in phenomenological PSYCHOLOGY, i.e., in the natu-
ral or mundane attitude. The phenomenology of reason 
is also presupposed in the idea of a tel os of humanity 
in the Die Krisis des europăischen Wissenschaflen und 
die transzendentale Phănomenologie ( 1936). A pheno-
menology ofreason is, therefore, of central significance 
in phenomenology. lfphenomenology is understood as 
the replacement of traditional first philosophy and if it 
is understood as transcendental phenomenology, then 
a phenomenology of reason is of central significance 
in phenomenology.

REASON 
mind that can be distinguished from other faculties, 
e.g., intuition and understanding. Reason is also not a 
name for certain types of intentiona! acts and active 
syntheses. Reason is the striving for possible verifica-
tion. This striving is present in ali intentiona! acts. Con-
sciousness is intentiona! and as such strives toward the 
self-givenness of its object and the fulfillment of empty 
or partially empty intentions. From this broad concep-
tion ofreason it follows that each type of intentiona! act 
has its own rules of reason guiding verification. They 
will be considered below and refer to the specific inten-
tiona! objects and the types of evidence. Verification, 
therefore, has different structures in different realms 
of intentiona! objects. Perception and feei ing, i.e., the 
subjective bodily aspects of perceptions and the emo-
tional reactions inside the body like pleasure and pain, 
to the extent that they involve active synthesis, already 
have their own rules ofreason guiding the striving for 
the self-givenness of objects of perception and feei ing. 
Striving for verification in intentiona! acts and in con-
sciousness in general have a goal, a telos. As such the 
striving requires rules. The rule can ha ve the character 
of a "Kantian idea" ifthe goal of complete verification 
and fulfillment cannot be reached according to the very 
nature of the corresponding intentiona! objects. It has 
tobe kept in mind, however, that the system ofideas of 
reason in KANT is restricted to very few types of striving 
and does not cover the scope ofthe phenomenological 
conception ofreason and ali possible ideas ofreason. 
Seen from this viewpoint, the phenomenology of 
reason is the final step of intentiona! analysis and thus 
a part of intentiona! analysis itself. From the very be-
ginning the search for the rules of active synthesis is a 
search for the rules ofthe givenness and possible self-
givenness ofthe corresponding intentiona! objects. The 
ideas ofTRUTH, true being, and actuality (Wirklichkeit) 
are the necessary correlates ofreason considered from 
the aspect ofthe NOEMA and the aspect ofthe intentiona! 
objects as guiding threads of intentiona! analysis. The 
different rules and ideas of reason can therefore be 
specified according to the different realms of FORMAL 
AND MATERIAL ONTOLOGY. Such reaJms are the reaJm of 
doxic givenness, of VALUEs, and of ACTIONS. The rules 
of formal LOGIC and formal ontology belong to rea-
son in general. The rules guiding the givenness of pure 
doxa belong to the material region ofthe natural things. 
The rules for the self-givenness of values are the 
591 
rules of formal and material axiology. Formal axiol-
ogy presupposes judgmental activity like formal on-
tology. Formal axiology investigates the axiologica! 
forms of value judgments. Value judgments in turn 
presuppose the immediate pre-predicative experience 
ofvalues. The rules offormal ontology are valid in for-
mal axiology, but formal ontology adds formal view-
points belonging only to the realm of values. Value 
judgments have, for instance, three semantic values: 
objects with positive values, value-free objects, and 
objects with negative values. Values are, in addition, 
not concrete objects, i.e., self-subsisting entities. They 
are properties, abstract moments, given with and in ob-
jects belonging to the realm of doxic givenness. Values 
in general belong to the realm of culture, INTERSUB-
JECTIVITY, and the givenness of others and myself as 
persons in this realm. Objects belonging to the mate-
rial realms ofphysical and ofliving beings have value 
only to the extent to which they occur in cultural ob-
jects. Two mai'n classes of values here are the utility 
values and the aesthetic values. Vital values -
orig-
inally experienced in sensible feelings, and therefore 
belonging to the realm of animality- are values in the 
proper sense only if they are given as the vital values 
of persons. Personal values are the values given in the 
character, i.e., the system of habits. Practica! values 
are the values of actions, i.e., the moral values in the 
narrower sense. 
Formal axiology has, like formal ontology, a the-
oretical and a normative aspect. The idea of reason 
guiding formal ontology is perfect evidence and truth 
and the idea of reason' guiding formal axiology is the 
idea of the highest good, the summum bonum. It is 
misleading, given Husserl 's narrow definition of the 
practica!, to speak about a priority of practica! reason 
in his philosophy. The additional normative aspect that 
can be found in reason in general and, closely con-
nected with it, the teleological character ofreason and 
its striving for absolute self-responsibility represent an 
ought of a higher order for rational beings. It is imme-
diately connected with the spontaneity and activity of 
transcendental subjectivity. 
The concepts of verification, self-givenness, and 
fulfillment are ambiguous, because they are different in 
different regions. A general clarification ofthese ambi-
guities is possible in the phenomenology of EVIDENCE. 
The phenomenology of evidence is of essential signif-

592 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
icance not only for the project of the logic of TRUTH 
sketched out in Formale und transzendentale Logik 
(1929), but also for the proper understanding of the 
transcendental-phenomenological reduction. In Ideen 
I Husserl says that striving for verification is striving 
for evidence. Evidence is thus nota specific property of 
certain representations indicating truth without qualifi-
cations. As a consequence of this terminological stip-
ulation, whoever says that verificati an or falsification, 
i.e., in Husserl 's terms "verified negation," are mean-
ingful concepts has to accept his specific concept of 
evidence. Reason as the striving for verification is the 
striving for perfect evidence transcending ali imper-
fect evidence. The second aspect of phenomenology 
of reason is therefore the phenomenological analysis 
of evidence. The difference between perfect and im-
perfect evidence can be determined in a preliminary 
description. Perfect evidence is self-givenness oftruth 
without implying empty, non-fulfilled intentiona! acts 
and without admixture of modalizing doubt, i.e., as true 
or false in strict disjunction without a third in between. 
What is given with such admixtures is given in imper-
fect evidence. Reason, therefore, is the sum total ofthe 
rules in which consciousness strives from imperfect to 
perfect evidence, i.e., to the givenness oftruth. 
The further development of the phenomenology of 
reason as a phenomenology of evidence is one of the 
most diffi.cult tasks of transcendental phenomenology. 
The distinctions introduced by Husserl in the Ideen 
I and elsewhere are not clear. In the Cartesianische 
Meditationen he introduced serious changes in the def-
initions ofthe meanings ofhis terms for different types 
of evidence without indicating that such changes ha ve 
been made. There are three kinds of imperfect evi-
dence vs. perfect evidence and these distinctions can 
also serve to clarify his earlier usage. 
(1) Original evidence, i.e., the bodily self-givenness 
ofthe abject in the present, is perfect evidence. Given-
ness in signitive intentions and empty intentions in 
general is imperfect. (2) There is perfect evidence as 
adequate evidence, i.e., the original givenness ofthe in-
tentiona! abject in ali of its aspects and adumbrations. 
Imperfect evidence in this sense is inadequate. (3) Per-
fect evidence can also be understood as apodictic ev-
idence, i.e., an evidence accompanied with the con-
sciousness of the impossibility of negation and doubt. 
Imperfect evidence in this sense is an evidence with an 
admixture of modalizing doubt. ( 4) The distinction of 
the Ideen lbetween assertoric evidence and evidence of 
eidetic intuition is explained in terms ofthe other types 
of evidence. Evidence in eidetic intuition is an original 
and apodictic evidence. In addition, it can be adequate. 
Assertoric evidence, i.e., the evidence of real objects, is 
original only in the immediately given adumbrations. 
It is never adequate and apodictic. (5) The distinction 
in Formale und transzendentale Logik of perfect evi-
dence as clear and distinct and imperfect evidence as 
obscure and confused is restricted to the specific type 
of evidence belonging to judgmental predicative evi-
dence. (6) The distinction between pre-predicative vs. 
predicative evidence is introduced in the Cartesianis-
che Meditationen. The basic distinctions are thus the 
distinctions between original, adequate, and apodictic 
evidence and their imperfect counterparts. According 
to the Ideen I apodictic evidence is adequate evidence 
but not vice versa. The thesis that apodicticity implies 
adequacy can still be found !ater in Erste Philosophie 
[1923/24]. 
The distinctions in the First and the Third Medita-
tions are different. Apodictic evidence is indubitable 
because the doubt itself implies the assertion of the 
abject of doubt. Apodictic evidence in this sense is 
therefore restricted to the self-givenness of the ex-
istence of the subject and to certain aspects of its 
essence, e.g., temporality. Apodictic essence in this 
sense is original, but it is not adequate. It follows that 
an adequate evidence can be original evidence only 
in case of very basic eidetic intuitions. The distinc-
tions of the Cartesianische Meditationen have seri-
ous consequences for the proper understanding of the 
transcendental-phenomenological reduction. NATURAL 
SCIENCE and HUMAN SCIENCES are interested in adequate 
evidence, but this adequacy is not given in original evi-
dence. Only one part of a scientific theory can be given 
in original evidence in the present. The other parts of 
the theory are given in the horizon in empty intentions 
and expectations. Science is not interested in apodictic 
evidence, but philosophy is and has been because only 
apodictic evidence can be used for the purpose of the 
ultimate grounding of ali knowledge in first philoso-
phy. The transcendental-phenomenological reduction 
is therefore a reduction to an apodictic and original 
evidence and the only evidence ofthis kind is the evi-
dence ofthe self-givenness ofthe subject. According to 

RELATIVISM 
593 
the Krisis the telos ofhumankind is the self-realization 
of reason in both directions: the final grounding in an 
apodictic evidence in transcendental phenomenology 
as first philosophy, and the infinite task ofthe extension 
of scientific knowledge striving for adequate evidence. 
Reason is understood in MARTIN HEIDEGGER's Sein 
und Zeit ( 192 7) in terms of the Greek understanding of 
logos, noe in, and an. As such, it is the place oftruth, the 
awareness ( Vernehmenlassen) of the being of beings. 
The modern conception of reason as ratia is o ne of the 
central issues in Heidegger's critique of metaphysics 
and with it the teleology belonging to reason in Husserl 
and the tradition, e.g., Kant. The essay "Der Satz vom 
Grund" ( 1956), one ofthe works ofHeidegger in which 
the Kehre is prepared, opposes two readings of the 
principle of sufficient reason. The first is the reading 
of the metaphysical tradition, leading in the end to 
the reckoning of modern logic and technology. In the 
second reading, the Satz vom Grund, the principle of 
the ground, is understood as a Satz in den Grund, a leap 
into a ground that is the un-ground, i.e., into being. 
Reason is nota topic for MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY. 
Husserl's interest in reason presupposes a critica! but 
neverthe1ess positive evaluation of objective science 
and an understanding ofphenomenology itself as a rig-
orous science with rigid methodological norms. Pheno-
menology in Merleau-Ponty's sense is strictly opposed 
to objective science and the ideal of a scientific first 
philosophy with strict methodo1ogical norms. There-
fore, reason cannot be of significance for his pheno-
menology ofperception and his ontology ofwild pre-
reflective being. 
JACQUES DERRIDA radicalizes Heidegger's critique of 
reason. Reason, logos as awareness of being in Hei-
degger's sense, is included in his critique of the lo-
gocentrism of the Western metaphysics of presence. 
He deconstructs Kant's conception ofreason, claiming 
that reason is, in the last instance, essentially unknow-
able, and uses this type of deconstruction in his critique 
of other philosophers for whom reason remained the 
core and the goal ofphilosophy. His critique ofreason 
is immediately connected with the development ofthe 
concept of differance. 
Thus reason is of significance only for phenome-
nologists belonging in addition to the tradition of the 
rationalism of Kantianism and German idealism such 
as GERHARD FUNKE. Reason in its different aspects is of 
crucial significance in his Phănomenologie- Meta-
physik ader Methode? ( 1966).

RELATIVISM 
The view that TRUTH is not abso-
lutely the same for everyone, but varies with the indi-
vidual person or group is relativism. The most radical 
relativism denies that there are any universally valid 
truths; more limited versions assert relativity only in 
a specific domain. For example, ethical and aesthetic 
relativism relativize moral and aesthetic values, but 
not the principJes of MATHEMATICS or of the NATURAL 
or HUMAN SCIENCES. Epistemic relativism holds that 
knowledge varies with the subject, rather than truth

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
itself. Forms of relativism are also distinguished ac-
cording to the features ofthe subject held to condition 
truth ( or knowledge or values ). Common examples are 
psychoiogicai make-up (PSYCHOLOGISM); HISTORY and 
historical worldview (historicism, We!tanschauung-
reiativism); culture (cultural relativism); LANGUAGE 
(linguistic relativism); conceptual scheme (conceptual 
relativism); and interests and aims (pragmatic rela-
tivism). 
Relativism and its aporias are perennial themes in 
the history of philosophy. The pre-Socratics empha-
sized the relativity of sensations of color, taste, and 
smell, in contrast to the conclusions of reason. The 
extension of relativism to rational knowledge can be 
traced back at least to the famous saying ofthe sophist 
Protagoras, chronicled by Plato, that "man is the mea-
sure of ali things, of those which are, that they are; 
of those which are not, that they are not'' (Theaete-
tus, 152a). Many modem versions of relativism are 
derivatives of KANT's view that the phenomenal world 
is structured by the subjective cognitive faculties. Rela-
tivism results when the Kantian thesis ofthe universal-
ity ofthe subjective structures is rejected in fa vor ofthe 
view that these structures are historically, culturally, or 
psychologically variable. 
Certa in logica! objections to relativism are as peren-
nial as relativism itself. It is objected that to claim that 
there is no absolute truth is to claim that there is one: 
the thesis of relativism itself; thus a global relativism is 
self-refuting. Relativism is also notorious for violating 
the law ofnoncontradiction, asserting that ajudgment 
can be true for one person but false for another, and 
hence both true and false at the same time. However, 
some philosophers find that these objections are incon-
clusive, or that they can be avoided through alternate 
formulations ofthe position. There remains little con-
sensus as to whether relativism is defensible, and the 
definition itself is increasingly under dispute. 
Relativism is of special interest in phenomenology 
for both historical and systematic reasons. Relativism 
was a burning issue for EDMUND HUSSERL, the founder 
ofphenomenology, whose development ofhis CONSTI-
TUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY was motivated in part by the 
desire to overcome it. Much the same was the case for 
MAX SCHELER in the ethical domain. However, !ater heirs 
ofthe phenomenological tradition, such as MARTIN HEI-
DEGGER and HANS-GEORG GADAMER, are often thought to 
have succumbed to relativism, and some believe this 
was as a consequence of phenomenology itself. The 
appearance of a systematic consonance between rel-
ativism and phenomenology arises primarily from its 
rejection of metaphysical realism. According to meta-
physical realism, reality exists independently of any 
actual or possible apprehension by subjects, and is es-
sentially subject-invariant. By contrast, for phenomen-
ology, reality is phenomenal reality, and essentially 
related to subjectivity. The variation in what is ex-
perienced as reality by different persons seems to ren-
der phenomenology especially vulnerable to relativism 
and its aporias. Thus a central issue for contemporary 
phenomenologists is whether phenomenology is nec-
essarily committed to some form of relativism, and if 
so, how to address the standard objections. 
Husserl 's intense engagement with relativism was 
sparked by his perception of the spiritual and moral 
decline of Europe, and his identification of skepticism 
and relativism as the root causes. He hoped that by 
providing a secure, universalist foundation for knowl-
edge and values, phenomenology would restore confi-
dence in REASON and help to foster an age of spiritual 
renewal. However, while Husserl is a virulent abso-
lutist in his early writings, in his !ater period he recog-
nizes that phenomenology itself gives rise to relativism 
in a certain form, and attempts to accommodate this 
within his overall foundationalist project. The extent 
of Husserl 's !ater concessions to relativism remains a 
matter of scholarly de bate. 
Husserl 's first explicit treatment of relativism is in 
the Prolegomena zur reinen Logik ( 1900). Here the 
main opponent is PSYCHOLOGISM, the view that the prin-
ciples of LOGIC are valid only relative to the psycholog-
ical make-up ofthe human species. Husserl 's approach 
in this early writing is largely formal. In addition to the 
common self-refutation objections, he argues that rel-
ativism incoherently presupposes the absolute status 
of the subjective conditioning structures themselves, 
as that to which truth is relativized. He also brands 
relativism inconsistent with the very meaning of the 
term "true," which he alleges always means "true for 
everyone and ali times." 
The next confrontation is in "Philosophie als 
strenge Wissenschaft" ( 1911 ). Here the focus is shifted 
from psychologism to historicism, epitomized by the 
Weftanschauung phi!osophy of WILHELM DILTHEY, a 

RELATIVISM 
595 
shift reflecting Husserl's growing concern to estab-
Iish the irrelativity of philosophy (as opposed to mere 
logic), and of phenomenology in particular. Formal-
logica! objections paralieling the Prolegomena are bol-
stered by a consideration of the moral implications of 
the respective truth-ideals of phenomenology and his-
toricism. The historicist, Husserl charges, assimilates 
truth to pragmatic values relative to the concerns and 
aims of a specific historical community. This concept 
oftruth is characteristic ofnaturallife, but when taken 
as a goal-idea, it reinforces a pragmatic moral charac-
ter. By contrast, phenomenology pursues the ideal of 
an ultimate and universaliy valid justification of each 
"position-taking" on the hasis ofthe individual's own 
rational insight. The pragmatic, historicist truth-ideal 
has its place in ordinary living and moments requiring 
an immediate decision, but the pursuit of the abso-
lute truth-ideal yields the ethicaliy highest and most 
responsible life. The philosopher, as the functionary of 
humankind, is charged with in fus ing this ethos through 
society as a whole. A similar association between a uni-
versalist philosophical truth-ideal and the moral weli-
being of society is asserted in the Kaizo articles ( 1923-
24) and the Vienna Lecture (1935). 
Husserl 's highly negative assessment of rela-
tivism is softened in light of the phenomenology of 
the LIFEWORLD. As early as Jdeen zu einer reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologischen Philoso-
phie II [1912-15], and continuing through the period 
of Die Krisis der europăischen Wissenschaften und die 
transzendentale Phănomenologie ( 1936), Husserl em-
phasizes that the WORLD of lived experience is subject-
relative, varying with physical and cultural-historical 
differences between persons and groups. In this con-
nection, Husserl develops a notion of situational, life-
worldly truth, set in contrast to the strictly subject-
irrelative truth sought by natural science. Lifeworldly 
truths have only a limited degree of exactness, justi-
fication, and intersubjectivity, these limits being fixed 
by the practica! interests governing typical situations 
within a specific lifeworld. Reversing the claim of the 
Prolegomena, Husserl maintains that at the level ofthe 
lifeworld, when we hold a judgment to be true, we do 
not mean that it is "true for everyone," but rather that 
it is justifiable relative to certain interests and techno-
logical means, and a matter of possible consensus for 
a limited intersubjective community. 
Similarly, the phenomenological equation of reality 
with concordant phenomenality leads to the affirma-
tion that the subject-relative objects of the lifeworld 
are real, even if, as in the case of cultural and reli-
gious entities, they are experienced only by limited 
groups. The !ater Husserl 's particular version of rela-
tivism circumvents the usuallogical paradoxes because 
while it violates the principle of the excluded middle, 
it respects the principle ofnoncontradiction. Within its 
limited domain of application, a lifeworldly judgment 
is either true or false, but never true for one person 
and false for another; outside that domain, it makes no 
claim, and has no truth-value at ali. This relativism is 
also a limited rather than a global relativism, and hen ce 
is not self-refuting. 
Despite his concessions to relativism at the level 
ofthe lifeworld, Husserl never abandons universal va-
lidity as the guiding truth-ideal for the sciences and 
for phenomenology in particular. This defense is com-
plicated by the fact that the sciences, which are to 
be subject-irrelative, are founded upon the lifeworld, 
which is subject-relative. Husserl addresses this para-
dox in a twofold way. Problems of relativity due to 
physical or other abnormalities in subjects (e.g., blind-
ness, insanity) are overcome by the natural develop-
ment at the level of the lifeworld of a concept of the 
"normal" world, the world "there" for ali normal per-
sons. Cultural-historical relativity can be overcome, 
according to Husserl, because ali concrete lifeworlds 
(or at least ali "normal" ones) share common struc-
tures, and these shared structures can provide the foun-
dation for the universaliy intersubjective concepts and 
evidence of science. Although the analysis of the uni-
versal lifeworldly structures was never fully worked 
out, candidate structures proposed by Husserl include: 
SPACE and TIME; the distinction between persons and 
things; some type of causal order; and cognitive rea-
son in the form of the distinction between truth and 
falsehood, or reality and illusion. 
Husserl 's claim of universallifeworldly structures, 
and with it the ultimate phenomenological overcoming 
of relativism, remain highly controversial. A central 
point of debate is whether the existence of universal 
structures can be given a phenomenological demon-
stration, rather than merely being dogmatically pre-
supposed with a view to grounding science. Another 
contentious issue is Husserl's assertion in the Krisis 

596 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
and the Kaizo articles that European rationality, and its 
scientific conception of truth as universal validity in 
particular, represent the spiritual te/os ofhumanity as 
a whole. Here again there is the appearance that, mo-
tivated by urgent historical events and deep personal 
conviction, Husserl's philosophizing speculatively ex-
ceeds what can be established in a rigorously pheno-
menological fashion. 
A more detailed phenomenological defense of ab-
solutism in the ethical domain is developed by MAX 
SCHELER, especially in Der Formalismus in der Ethik 
and die materiale Wertethik (Formalism in ethics and 
nonformal ethics of value, 1913/1916). According to 
Scheler, phenomenological analysis of the givenness 
of VALUES demonstrates that they are "objective," ir-
reducible to the subjective experiences in which they 
appear. Their status is analogous to that ofthe essences 
of sensuous objects: they are ideal objectivities exist-
ing in nature wholly independently of any real abject, 
subject, or experience. The same is the case for the 
system ofrankings among values. 
Like any ethical absolutism, Scheler's view must 
come to terms with the wide divergence of existing 
moral beliefs and practices. Scheler argues that these 
are due not to the relativity ofvalues themselves, but to 
significant individual and historical differences in the 
ability of people to feei the values existing indepen-
dently in nature. For example, some individuals and 
groups are more sensitive to utilitarian values, others 
to spiritual or religious values. He maintains that values 
"exist" in the phenomenological sense and are valid for 
persons so long as there is a propensity toward them. 
While the propensity to lower types ofvalues (pleasure 
values, use values, vital values) depends upon sensi-
bility, which is variable, the propensity to the higher 
values (spiritual values, holy values) is independent of 
sensibility and universally possessed by all persons. 
According to Scheler, the ethical sensibility of hu-
manity gradually actualizes its propensity to the higher 
values over the course of history, becoming ever more 
perfect and sensitive to the true order of ranking. This 
teleological development is brought about primarily 
through the activity ofthe "moral genius," the individ-
ual with an extraordinary capacity for value-feeling, 
far surpassing that of society in general. Yet while em-
phasizing the uniqueness of the ethical sensibility of 
each group and even each individual, Scheler claims 
that some de facto value-estimations are universally 
shared. In these cases, any appearance of disagreement 
is due to different definitions of things rather than to 
differences in values. For example, theft, murder, and 
adultery are always held evi!, although they are very 
differently defined by different societies. 
Scheler's combination of absolutism at the level 
of values with historicism at the level of value-
consciousness could seem to lead to an epistemic para-
dox: if all knowledge of values is historically condi-
tioned, then knowledge of absolute values is impos-
sible. Scheler's own view, however, is that there are 
some few individuals who are capable of rising above 
the times to cognition of the objective, timeless or-
der of values. This distinguishes his view from that 
of Husserl, who puts a greater emphasis on the funda-
mental cognitive similarity of human beings, and on 
consensus as a criterion of universal validity. Scheler's 
position is also open to the charge of being specula-
tively rather than phenomenologically grounded. 
Another influential phenomenological approach to 
relativism is COntained in the EXISTENTIAL PHENOMEN-
OLOGY of the early MARTIN HEIDEGGER. Although Hei-
degger does not explicitly defend relativism, his po-
sitions in Sein und Zeit (1927) seem to have a quasi-
Kantian relativism of truth as their consequence. Ac-
cording to Heidegger, the true is what comes forth into 
appearance, what is unconcealed to DASEIN. However, 
Dasein always finds itself with a "pre-understanding" 
of moods, interests, plans, and dispositional attitudes 
that influence and make possible all understanding and 
apprehension. In contrast to Husserl and Kant, Hei-
degger emphasizes the individuality and historicity 
of these world-constituting features, as well as their 
noncognitive character. Thus although Dasein cannot 
arbitrarily choose what will appear and hence be true, 
because what appears is conditioned by variable exis-
tential features of the individual, neither will truth be 
the same for all persons. 
The Heideggerian equation of truth with uncon-
cealedness is clearly phenomenological in inspiration, 
for it correlates the true with the given, and not with 
what "is" apart from its phenomenality. However, Hei-
degger's conception is freed of the requirement of in-
tersubjective validity, retained by Husserl at least for 
the sciences. This is accompanied by a radically differ-
ent assessment ofthe phenomenologicallegitimacy of 

RELATIVISM 
597 
the scientific, universalist conception oftruth. In a pas-
sage of §44 of Sein und Zeit directed against Husserl, 
Heidegger argues that there is truth only insofar as 
there is Dasein, and that even Newton 's laws were not 
true prior to their discovery by Newton. He charges 
that the very concept of atemporal, universal truth is 
a chimera, an unpurged remnant of dogmatic theology 
in phenomenological analysis. The attainment of in-
tersubjective agreement and uniformity of opinion is 
associated with inauthenticity and subordination to das 
Man. The scientific conception of truth is "abkiinftig" 
(derivative), which, in addition to meaning "founded" 
in the Husserlian sense (i.e., on the relative truth ofthe 
lifeworld), also bears the connotation ofinauthenticity. 
Thus whereas for Husserl the quest for universality em-
bodied by science represents the highest ethical ideal, 
for Heidegger it is a "fali ing" of the self away from its 
true identity into a depersonalized, dominated form of 
being. 
A number of difficulties face the Heideggerian po-
sition. Even ifthe historicity ofDasein is granted, it is 
not clear that phenomenological contingency is so per-
vasive as to exclude all universals. The argument that 
universality can be achieved only by way of inauthen-
ticity is similarly questionable, for the phenomenologi-
cal content of the distinction between the "authentic" 
and the "inauthentic" is left largely unclarified. Finally, 
insofar as it is a global rather than partial relativism, 
the Heideggerian view confronts the charges of in-
consistency and incoherence common to ali totalizing 
relativisms. 
An important elaboration ofthe early Heidegger's 
quasi-Kantian position is presented in the philosoph-
ical hermeneutics of HANS-GEORG GADAMER. A\though 
Gadamer is not always considered a phenomenologist, 
his critique of traditional ideals of objectivity in the hu-
man sciences is based on Heidegger's phenomenologi-
cal analysis ofthe thrownness and historicity ofDasein. 
In Wahrheit und Methode (Truth and method, 1960), 
Gadamer characterizes his own method as pheno-
menological: unlike traditional HERMENEUTICS, which 
prescribes methodological norms and ideals, philo-
sophical hermeneutics provides a phenomenological 
description of what actually happens in interpreta-
tion. A central result of this analysis is that inter-
pretation is always affected and indeed made possi-
ble by "prejudices," or "prejudgments" ( Vorurteile): 
the pre-thematic beliefs, interests, and perspective of 
inquiry (Fragestellung) inherited by the interpreter 
from tradition and history. The traditional hermeneu-
tica! ideal of methodical self-effacement is declared 
by Gadamer to be unattainable, because effective-
historical consciousness ( wirkungsgeschichtliches Be-
wusstsein, consciousness imbued with the effects of 
history) participates in constituting the object of inter-
pretation; without it, the "meaning of the text" would 
ha ve no phenomenological being at ali. 
Gadamer is generally perceived as a historical rel-
ativist by his critics, since he denies the possibility of 
transhistorically valid interpretation, and consequently, 
it would appear, the legitimacy of this ideal for the 
hermeneutica! disciplines. However, he has consis-
tently rejected the relativist designation. On some oc-
casions this is due to his equation of relativism with 
random arbitrariness in interpretation, a view he deci-
sively rejects on the basis ofthe constraining action of 
the phenomena. On others this is because of his lim-
ited acceptance of transhistorical validity as an ideal, 
despite its unattainability. In "Hermeneutik und His-
torismus" ( 1965), for example, he maintains that there 
is no logica! contradiction in the unconditional asser-
tion that ali knowledge is historically conditioned, be-
cause there is a distinction between being held true 
(which is always historically conditioned) and being 
true (which is not). This suggests that Gadamer is a 
historical relativist at the level ofbeliefs, but unlike the 
early Heidegger, he remains an absolutist at the level 
of truth. However, as in the case of Scheler, the com-
bination of epistemic relativism and truth-absolutism 
is problematic, because it undermines the possibility 
of the justification of claims to truth. Yet in contrast to 
Scheler, Gadamer strongly denies that any individual 
could rise above local historical context to uncondi-
tioned knowledge. Thus his position remains entrapped 
in an epistemic aporia. 
Many areas of inquiry remain open for further re-
search. Assuming that the basic Husserlian theory of 
universal lifeworldly structures is sound, a detailed 
specification and description ofthese structures is still 
outstanding for numerous important domains, such 
as ETHICS, AESTHETICS, RELIGION, LANGUAGE, REASON, 
and EMOTION, to name just a few. The relative (non-
universal) structures ofthese domains are also in need 
of additional specification and concrete analysis. The 

598 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
general problem of typologies of relative and univer-
sallifeworldly structures raises a significant theoretical 
issue for further investigation as well: the relation of 
phenomenology to the empirica! sciences. According 
to Husserl, in the most fundamental type ofphenomen-
ological analysis, the results of empirica! science are 
to be "bracketed" (together with the existence of the 
world itselt). Following this methodology, universal 
Iifeworldly structures are derived solely from EIDETIC 
METHOD (free variation) and performed on the lifeworld 
as such, and are ali eidetic necessities. However, this 
method yields a quite reduced, if especially certain, 
specification of universal structures (e.g., space and 
time); and, as even Husserl seems to concede, some 
highly significant structures are universally shared by 
aii human lifeworlds although they are only contin-
gently and not eidetically so (e.g., the practice ofmea-
suring). A fu li typology of universal structures needs to 
be two-tiered, analyzing both necessary and contingent 
features. Yet phenomenology of the contingent univer-
sal features is clearly on the border of PHILOSOPHICAL 
ANTHROPOLOGY, and needs to take into account the re-
sults of empirica! sciences such as ETHNOLOGY, without 
being wholly determined by these. Further inquiry into 
the proper mode of appropriation of empirica! results 
would solidify the theoretical foundations of pheno-
menological typologies ofuniversallifeworldly struc-
tures.

RELIGION 
The earliest writings on re-
ligion within the phenomenological movement are 
MAX SCHELER's discussions of the holy in Der For-
malismus in der Ethik und die materiale Wertethik 
(Formalism in ethics and nonformal ethics of value, 
1913/1916) and the tantalizing §§51 and 58 of ED-
MUND HUSSERL 's Ideen zu ei ner reinen Phănomenologie 
und phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913). Adolf 
Reinach 's joumal entries on "The Absolute" shortly 
before his death in 1916 may also be mentioned. But it 
was Max Scheler's "Reue und Wiedergeburt" as well 
as "Probleme der Religion" in Vom Ewigen im Men-
schen (The eterna! in humans, 1920) that may be said to 
ha ve inaugurated the phenomenology of religion with 
Lester Embree, Elizabeth A. Behnke, David Carr, J. Claude Evans, Jose Huertas-Jourda, Joseph J. Kockelmans, William R. McKenna,

an eidetic analysis of the religious act and its inten-
tiona! region and object, the absolute sphere and the 
holy. The pioneering reflections of especially RUDOLF 
OTTO in his Das Heilige (The holy, 1920) are acknowl-
edged by Scheler. Scheler's work spawned efforts on 
the 1920s to study religion "phenomenologically" by 
phiJosophers such as JEAN HERING, GERDA WALTHER, HED-
WIG CONRAD-MARTIUS, KURT STAVENHAGEN, ROBERT WIN-
KLER, and OTTO GRUNDLER. 
Then carne the philosophically conversant students 
of Religionswissenschaft, such as Gerardus Van der 
Leeuw (1890--1950), Joachim Wach, Mircea Eliade 
(1867-1953), and William Brede Kristensen (1867-
1953) in the 1930s through the 1960s. Although these 
writers had a somewhat loose grasp ofphenomenology 
they were extremely learned, and at least one ofthem, 
Mircea Eliade, was endowed with an intuitive poetic 
genius. 
Much of MARTIN HEIDEGGER 's discussions of Sein, 
anxiety, the upsetting, the clearing, unconcealment, po-
etic dwelling, etc., are explicated in terms redolent of 
religion. (The same can be said for the discussions of 
KARL JASPERS and GABRIEL MARCEL on the encompass-
ing, mystery, etc.) Heidegger also addressed himself 
to the topic of phenomenology and religion explicitly, 
especially in his essay "Phănomenologie und Theolo-
gie" ( 1927), as well as in some other early lectures and 
!ater shorter writings. 
It was through Heidegger's work especially that 
mid-20th century theology took on, first, the form of 
a demythologizing analytic of DASEIN in Rudolf Bult-
mann (1884--1976) and PAUL TILLICH, and then, !ater, 
in the last quarter of the 20th century an essentially 
hermeneutica! cast, through the work of HANS-GEORG 
GADAMER, and most recently JACQUES DERRIDA. While 
sharing the caution and skepticism of HERMENEUTIC AL 
PHENOMENOLOGY, PAUL RICCEUR'S study of the eidetics 
and poetics of the will and the unconscious, as well as 
his multi volume study of narrative, has been a monu-
mental accomplishment. 
Finally, in the 1950s and 1960s, the elaborate neo-
Piatonic phenomenological philosophies ofreligion of 
HENRY DUMERY and J. N. FINDLAY revived the original 
aspirations of both Husserl and Scheler toward a full-
blown philosophical theology. We may now turn from 
the history to the issues of a phenomenology of reli-
gion. 
Religion is a term that can refer to matters that are 
among the most basic of phenomenology, but in the 
natural attitude it covers a variety ofbeliefs and prac-
tices that, within a cu! ture, enjoy a universality for the 
cu1ture. Whether this universality dissolves into mere 
"family resemblances" beyond the cultural borders or 
whether there is a universal pattern, an archetype, or 
an eidos that founds comparisons is much debated by 
Eliade, Wach, Van derLeeuw, C. G. Jung (1875-1961 ), 
and others, as well as by their critics. 
Religion is lived, with a few exceptions- as per-
haps in the mysticism of Meister Eckhart, Vedăntists, 
and Buddhists- in the natural attitude. Because of the 
destructive rupture, there is a kind of impiety properly 
associated with a concomitant second-order reflection 
on the first-order spontaneous acts of worship, repen-
tance, thanksgiving, and stillness. Furthermore, there 
is a kind of essential elusiveness because of the very 
transcendence and rich implicit felt sense of religious 
intentionality. For this reason, the phenomenology of 
religion can intially surprise the unreflective believer 
or, more importantly, it can easily be distorted by the 
student who, succumbing to the need to have a de-
finable field of research, makes the theme of religion 
commensurate with themes in other academic disci-
plines. 
The study of religion while in the natural attitude 
is similar to the study of a cultural phenomenon like 
"marriage." Assuming my first-person experience ful-
fills basic preconditions, i.e., that I am not bereft of 
a sensibility to eros and a capacity for and interest in 
companionship, I can study "marriage" by empathic 
perception and imaginative variation whether or not I 
myself ha ve experienced marital lif1e. One ,may won-
der with Otto whether the religious NOEMA admits of 
a kind of basic a priori deficiency analogous, e.g., to 
color blindness and moral pathology. Similarly, I can 
study by empathic perception and imaginative vari-
ation, e.g., animal sacrifice, regardless of whether I 
think it is the sort of thing one ought to do or believe 
that what it intends exists. And I can bring to bear the 
results ofresearch in my culture on the seemingly sim-
ilar themes in strange cultures. Whether in the course 
of such comparison the empirica! material explodes, 
resists, or supplements the necessities of my imagina-
tive variation is an empirica!, contingent matter. Often 
enough, "religious" beliefs and practices, especially 

600 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
when they range away from the "limit situations" of 
birth, death, sexuality, and illness, resist such a ho-
mologization -
not only because of differences that 
make practices and beliefs approach incommensurabil-
ity, but also because "religion" is nota special category 
for some cultures (not even a word for "religion" is to 
be found in these cultures), but seems to coincide with 
ali of life. 
For the philosophical phenomenology of religion or 
phenomenological theology, there are additionalphilo-
sophical problems beyond the analysis of the religious 
object as it is meant. Is there an EVIDENCE for its exis-
tence apart from the religious act- as in "proofs for 
the existence ofGod" or Sophocles' claim that humans 
are the most uncanny of ali beings- or is it knowable 
properly only in and through religious INTENTIONALITY? 
Are there moral preconditions for the disclosure ofthis 
noema in its authentic forms? How, given the (typical) 
sense of its noema, e.g., its infinite perfection and mys-
tery, does it lend itselfto being an object of an act? Do 
themes in the transcendental attitude occasion religious 
reflection? If so, would they not transform and be nor-
mative for the sense of religion in the natural attitude 
upon which they would nevertheless be parasitic? We 
address only some ofthese issues here. 
Not only "religious" objects but ali perceptual ob-
jects tend to transcend themselves in ways that are 
similar to and different from the manner of linguistic 
MEANINGS. Clearly in presencing both religious objects 
and linguistic signifiers the mind is carried beyond 
them to what is not given, but frequently only pre-
sentable through them. The presence of another person 
makes evident the clearest kind of chasmic transcen-
dence, i.e., one in which there is no hope for a filled 
intention (EMMANUEL LEVINAS). Here, as with ali the 
linchpins in phenomenology, the task of reason is not 
undone simply because, as THOMAS PRUFER says, "it 
can never be so completed that its sense is filled by 
an achievement with nothing left stil! tobe achieved." 
Two other examples are the prima! presencing of the 
dati ve of manifestati an, i.e., transcendental subjectiv-
ity as that to which appears ali that appears, and an 
infinite regulati ve idea as an ideal, e.g., of the WORLD 
or a life of absolute perfection. Whereas the former 
eludes by being essentially presupposed as the condi-
tion of wakefulness to anything whatsoever, the latter 
eludes by being always further emptily intended in the 
endless achieving of its approximation. 
There is an abiding essential possibility of tempta-
tion to "idolatry," e.g., of collapsing the intentionality 
of ideals to goals or of the world to what is within the 
world, because the ideals and world as the horizon of 
goals and things are immanent in their explication; this 
possibility is intensified in the presence of an Other, 
i.e., another lived body to whom the world is manifest. 
The embodiment ofthe transcendent may be sacra-
mental in the sense that the signifier participates in 
some of the qualities that are proper to the signified: 
the patriot does not throw the flag out with the garbage 
because the flag is a sacred thing (Paul Tillich). There 
is a kind of dialectica! tension between the signification 
and the signified inasmuch as the sense ofthe signifier, 
even though bound to the first-order sense ofthe signi-
fied, typically eludes an explication that is commensu-
rate with the proper, first-order sense. The statue ofthe 
mother holding the infant, the Father who is in Heaven, 
the portly figure sitting in a lotus position, etc., ali 
have proper, familiar, "first-order" references, e.g., the 
familiar sense of motherhood and fatherhood and med-
itating person, but that which they signify affirms and 
negates these and points beyond them to an analogous 
referent whose full meaning indeterminately exceeds 
any such first-order explications (Paul Ricceur). This 
non-definability, indeed its peculiar "nothingness," is 
demonstrated by the way, e.g., the Pauline text, "Eye 
hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into 
the heart of man," functions for religious conscious-
ness: the negation of determinations does not result in 
a paucity of meaning; rather, a referent is evoked that 
exceeds in richness ali determinations (Otto, Scheler, 
Findlay). 
"Horizon," "field," "ideal-pole," etc., are ways of 
talking about how the transcendence of certain things 
"within" the world, as well as of the intentionality 
apprehending them, is manifest. We intend world anal-
ogously to the way we intend the ideal-pole of a spa-
tiotemporal "thing" in and through endless adumbra-
tions or profiles; that which we intend exceeds any 
particular profile or any particular finite collection of 
them. To say that things are within the world is to say 
that they are within a unique transcendent horizon that 
unifies and determines them not only as belonging to 
a contextual unity of space and time, but also as ha v-
ing a cultural-historical determination as well as an 

RELIGION 
601 
essential-meaning topos (they are of some natural or 
ideal kind within a network ofkinds). 
Some people, things, and events "gather" and "cen-
ter" the world, i.e., embody in an urgent, impressive 
way the whole endless meaning of a person 'sora com-
munity's world-life and/or transmarginal conscious-
ness. These loom as supremely important, the "one 
thing necessary," and perhaps even become the "abso-
lute ought"(Husserl), because they condense ali ofthe 
world and our life in the world, i.e., ali ofthe habitual 
life-will, in their seemingly finite borders. Indeed, so 
stirring can this embodiment ofworld and the life-will 
be that it can unsettle, cause alarm, or defamiliarize us 
with our customary settings. 
World as constituted by beliefs, hopes, and pre-
sumptions has not only the facet of the promise of 
positive value, but also the possibility of disappoint-
ment, rejection, and absurdity. Experiences may oc-
cur in which the essential contingency, fragility, and 
surds loom most prominent; then in such moments of 
anxiety, despair, and dread, another, negative, facet of 
world is made present. In nightmarish and apocalyptic 
circumstances the diabolica! and horrifying may be-
come themes. Here there is a "decentering," but not 
that of a dissemination of centers of power- instead, 
one that allows no hold and indeed menaces us in our 
very attempt to take hold and orient ourselves. 
The noetic achievement ofthe these centering, gath-
ering objects -
e.g., myths, artworks, extraordinary 
persons, great politica! events- is a gathering, center-
ing act that synthesizes the typically disjointed, discon-
nected themes and phases of one 's life. An example of 
such acts is believing-in, which is tobe contrasted with 
the merely cognitive and doxastic belief-that. "Belief-
in" is the act by which and through which a life may 
be centered around an ideal that one counts on uncon-
ditionally and to which one's identity is inextricably 
tied. In times of misfortune and irrationality it and the 
accompanying beliefs in its postulated conditions are 
ali the means one has in the agony ofholding the mind 
together. Fidelity to these ideals and Others, is, as a 
way of defying their absence, simultaneously a way to 
secure their immortality. But insofar as they are essen-
tially inseparable from the divine, these have, in this 
respect, a less precarious immortality. 
Celebration, cult, liturgy, and rituals are ways in 
which both the negative and positive aspects of the 
world as such are made present and in which the belief-
in is explicated. Just as the constitution ofthe artwork 
is not an achievement given cognitively prior to the 
achieving but only comes for the first time to aware-
ness in the achievement, so the meaning ofbelief-in is 
actualized both in responsibilities of agency to which 
life calls as well as through participation in the ex-
emplary identifying narratives and rituals tied to one's 
ideals. 
An aspect of ritual may be elucidated by analyzing 
the performative character of speech acts. The faithful 
performance ofthe LANGUAGE in liturgy does not merely 
inform or describe a state of affairs, but brings about, 
effects, through the very saying ofthe ritual, the state 
of affairs: "1, John, hereby take you, Mary ... ," "This 
is my Body ... ," "1 baptize you ... " 
Ifwe think ofthe world as that which transcends ali 
that is "within" the world, may we think of the world 
itself as being suffused with eros or in development, as 
itselfhaving an ideal-pole? The Good as divine would 
be transcendent of the world as the world is transcen-
dent of ali that comprises the world. As such, it would 
be an ideal-pole of poles, which, from the viewpoint 
of the myriad rational subjectivities, would be an in-
finite regulative ideal of a eutopian intersubjectivity 
(Husserl). But as the Good, as the summum bonum, it 
would be a "value" that would both summarize and 
consummate ali the other goods, i.e., it would include 
in itself the goodness of the world and the goods of 
the world. Would it, however, as that for the sake of 
which everything else might be sacrificed (Scheler), be 
able to absorb other goods in the sense that no sacri-
ficed good is lost? Yet if tragedy is not spurious for 
humans- if it is not possible to lay claim to a secret 
that finds sweetness in ali bitterness and that enables 
the will 's ratification of ali pain and suffering because 
one believes that only by renouncing ali can one gain 
the Ali- then the life of the world has an ingredient 
of ananke even for the divine, and thus genuine goods 
may perish. 
But still, may we- motivated by the belief or hy-
pothesis that perhaps the cruelest contradictions will 
reveal the basic meaning of the life-will and world-
horizon, and moved also by the eidetic variation to 
conceive "that than which nothing greater can be con-
ceived" -
think of the necessities of the world, the 
world as a whole itself, and even its divine moments, 

602 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
i.e., the "divine" as principle ofits Whence and Whither 
(see below), as created and not ultimately necessary? 
And may we, as Thomas Prufer and ROBERT SOKOLOWSKI 
have proposed, then think of a sense in which "God," 
independent of the world, both encompasses and in-
finitely transcends the infinity of ali that exists, i.e., 
a sense of "God plus the world is not greater than 
God alone"? In this case it might well be possible 
that we could gain access to the divine transcendence 
not through theory and reflection, but through a kind 
of emptiness and self-abnegation. Then, as Maurice 
Blondei (1861-1949) put it, mortification would be 
the "true metaphysical experiment." 
If it is evident that world, or that open space within 
which beings come to presence, functions as the hidden 
defining context for these beings, and ifthis context is 
inseparable from the gathering and letting be present 
ofthe prima! presencing in passive synthesis (Heideg-
ger and Husserl), then a kind of "stepping back" and 
silence emerges to which we may be exhorted, one 
that fi ies in the face of re gard ing Being as that which 
is to be grasped, named, or manipulated, or as a re-
source at our disposal. This exhortation to what we 
most fundamentally already do and are, urges that the 
most basic kind of thinking is a "poetic dwelling," a 
"gathering," or "letting go" that has affinities with pro-
posals of Meister Eckhart and some representatives of 
BUDDHISM. 
This stepping back and attentiveness to the anony-
mous functioning of the dati ve of manifestati an in the 
world's appearing raises the basic issue of whether 
the disclosure of the ultimate consideration can be in 
any kind of objective form. That is, if objectivism or 
unmindfulness of the functioning of mind in the dis-
closure of the world is the "original sin" of theoret-
ical reflection and a fortiori that of theology, is not 
the appropriate procedure for phenomenological the-
ology one of reduction instead of demonstration and 
objective-noematic horizon analysis? Ought the proper 
reflection not be in the uncovering of the essentially 
non-nameable, indeterminate, non-objectifiable meon-
tic Whence of ali objectifying acts (Dumery)? And 
does not authentic living then aim at a silence and 
rest the sense of which is the logos and striving that 
preceded it on the way to the ultimate reduction? In 
such a case, we would have to agree with Plotinus: the 
Whence is the better and the Whither lacks the perfec-
tion ofthe Whence alone. In this case, the development 
and eros pervading the world are rei ati vized, derogated, 
and, if possible, suppressed. But such a view negates 
the sense of the divine experienced in the authentic 
striving to realize infinite ideals. Further, the "no" to 
life implicit in this view, as essential as it is to the 
emergence ofthe life of spirit and the capacity of spirit 
to dwell in the realm of idealities, acknowledges the 
equiprimordiality ofthe force (Drang) oflife (Scheler). 
Coeval to the pervading "divine" ideas and ego logica! 
principle is the unbegun and undying "creativity" or 
"hyletic streaming" (Husserl) as an equal constitutive 
moment of the prima! presencing of transcendental 
subjectivity. Here the divine is not only the Whence 
and more immanent to subjectivity than the I-center of 
acts, and not only the Whither or ideal pole-i dea ofthe 
world; it is also coeval with a principle of ebullience 
and determinability: ananke, hyle, Drang. The divine 
is thus bipolar, "entelechy," formal and final principle 
of world-life and the nexus of intersubjectivities, and 
therefore it is a constitutive moment ofthe whole. As 
such the divine needs the world and the wakefulness 
and authenticity of finite forms of consciousness in or-
der for the divine to realize itself, i.e., to realize the 
eutopian godly person of a higher order. Humans are 
immortal at least by reason oftheir participation in the 
self-realization process of divinity and in the unbegun 
and unending prima! hyletic stream. 
The reflections that generate these kinds of claims 
are not founded merely on given "religious" phenom-
ena or acts; they arise primarily out of the most ele-
mental and foundational issues within phenomenology, 
foremost the teleology and facticity of REASON. Nev-
ertheless the claim's themselves are homologous with 
some religious experiential claims, e.g., ofthe Buddha-
nature as the principle and origin of ali beings. The 
claim that human struggle is the vehicle for the di-
vine self-realization, however, is one that is mediated 
by the modem critique ofreligion, i.e., it is a form of 
alienation.

RE-PRESENTATION 
The term representation 
is among the most ambiguous in philosophical and 
psychological usage. Following "Husserl's suggestion 
in conversation" -
as reported by DORION CAIRNS in 
his Guide for Translating Husserl (1973) under the 
heading of the word Vorstellung- the term represen-
tation will be used to refer to those phenomena that 
EDMUND HUSSERL designated by the terms Darstellung 
and Vergegenwiirtigung and it will be explained how 
Husserl took Darstellung to be one mode of Verge-
genwiirtigung, which itself will be translated as re-
presenta tion. 
It may be helpful to recall that the word Vorstel-
lung was originally introduced into German philoso-
phy by Christian Wolff in the 18th century as equiv-
alent for the Latin repraesentatio and that it is vari-
ously translated in English by presentation, represen-
tation, (mental) objectivation, etc. Here (mental) ob-
jectivation will be used to translate Vorstellung so as 
to be able to save presentation for Gegenwiirtigung 
and to use representation as indicated above. But it 
should be kept in mind that in English Husserl 's term 
Vergegenwiirtigung is sometimes, following Caims's 
own proposal, translated by presentiation, along with 
presentiating, non-original presentation ( or intuition ), 
and, as in the French presentification, by presentifica-
tion, but also by re-presentation (hyphenated), which 
has the advantages that it can be clearly spoken and 
heard in English as well as suggesting the repetition 
that Husserl carne to consider important. 
Husserl was interested in phenomena of re-
presentational consciousness at least since the 1890s, 
and particularly in connection with the preparation of 
his Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900--1901 ). In close 
relation to that work he turned again and again, dur-
ing the Gottingen years, to the study ofthe individual 
forms ofre-presentation, whereas in the !ater Freiburg 
years the modes of re-presentational consciousness 
were dealt with in the context ofthe phenomenological 
theory of transcendental subjectivity. 
Considering the philosophical significance of intu-
itive re-presentation for Husserl, it may be said that 
the topic shifted somewhat from being part of a more 
specific aim earlier to serving a broader function !ater. 
First the aim of clarifying intuitive re-presentation as 
such and with respect to each of its forms, especially 
in contrast to perception, formed part of elaborating a 
"critique of REASON" step by step from the bottom up. 
In particular, it was to be one aspect of a systematic 
phenomenological investigation of intuition. Husserl 
thought such an investigation necessarily prior to a 
study ofjudgment, sin ce intuitive acts of consciousness 
form in his view the hasis of the specifically logica!, 
conceptual, and categoria! acts involved in the higher-
level judgmental acts of cognition or theoretical reason. 
The task of a "critique of reason" also involved a study 
ofTIME, as Husserl carne to realize, and as will be seen, 
his investigations of intuitive re-presentation reached 
their perhaps most important results in connection with 
his research into the nature and significance of inner 
time-consciousness.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ond part of Husserl 's lecture course of 1923/24, ded-
icated to the theory of the phenomenological EPOCHE 
AND REDUCTION -
the studies of the diverse forms of 
re-presentational consciousness proved tobe ofutmost 
importance for Husserl 's mature theory of transcenden-
tal subjectivity. Along with analyzing acts of intuitive 
re-presentation, for a single subjectivity as well as for 
an INTERSUBJECTIVITY, Husserl showed how the phe-
nomenon of "intentiona! implication," as it occurs in 
re-presentational consciousness, was crucial for dis-
closing the pure constituting transcendental subjectiv-
ity. Thus the at first rather speciallooking task allowed 
him at last to catch sight ofunsuspected depths and in-
terconnections in the intentionallife of consciousness. 
Still !ater in his career, the analyses of re-
presentation were no doubt also of particular signif-
icance for Husserl 's gradually developed view ofwhat 
makes up the human person as a rational being. Espe-
cially in the 1930s, Husserl repeatedly addressed the 
question ofwhat comprises the specifically human sub-
jectivity or consciousness and the specifically human 
surrounding world, as against the animal world. As he 
points out, the nonhuman animal li ves in a world of the 
present and constitutes itself as a subject of presence 
in a presently surrounding world. In contrast, the sur-
rounding world ofhumans, and in particular its charac-
ter ofbeing a cultural WORLD, requires a personality of 
an essentially different kind that is able to li ve not only 
in the present but throughout its whole life, the life of 
its past and its future as well as the life of possibili-
ties, and through various forms of empathy- another 
sort of re-presentation -
the life of other minds. In 
this context Husserl meditates on the transcendental 
conditions of such possibilities of life, thereby putting 
forward in outline the view that the human egological 
structure is unique in that human beings are persons 
for themselves and for each other. And persons, unlike 
animals, have an ability ofrepetition (Wiederholung), 
of an identifying repetition and reflection. 
Now according to Husserl, ali re-presentation is 
something like repetition; repetition has the character 
ofre-presentation ( Vergegenwiirtigung). With re gard to 
various forms of re-presentational consciousness such 
as imagining, remembering, etc. -
which nonhuman 
animals allegedly lack, being confined, therefore, to 
the surrounding world in its present- he says that hu-
mans ha ve reason ( Vernunft), and he asks whether what 
he has said about those forms ofre-presentation desig-
nates the lowest level of rationality ( Verniinftigkeit). 
It is characteristic for Husserl that he approached 
the phenomena of re-presentation from the standpoint 
of INTENTIONALITY. Consider our ordinary conscious 
experiences. Prominent among them are such experi-
ences of re-presentation ( Vergegenwiirtigung) as IMAG-
INATION, MEMORY, or EXPECTATION with respect to an 
event in which there is some "imagery," for example a 
vi vid daydream or the "picturing" of a scene from our 
pastor our future. Again, what Husserl calls "picture-
consciousness" (Bildbewusstsein) denotes experiences 
in which we are aware of something by means of a 
physically embodied representation (Darstellung) of 
it, experiences such as seeing a photograph of a land-
scape or seeing a painting of a person. Such experiences 
are unlike what he called purely signitive conscious-
ness where, as when we merely think of someone on 
the occasion of hearing his or her name, the object we 
have in mind does not appear in anything like a per-
ceptual manner. Now when we experience any ofthose 
phenomena ofimagining, remembering, etc., we know 
that we do not simply perceive something in the here 
and now, but that we are aware that we somehow or 
other relate to something that is not really here but is 
only re-presented. As Husserl emphasized, in everyday 
life we ali normally "know" what it is, e.g., to imagine 
a flying elephant, or to remember a hike in the moun-
tains, to see a group of people in a painting, but we 
know it only implicitly. 
The phenomenologist's task is to explicate the dis-
tinctions among those conscious experiences of re-
presenting something, to describe the constituent parts 
making up this or that variety ofre-presentational con-
sciousness, and to clarify its specific cognitive achieve-
ment. Thus, as Husserl would say, the phenomenologist 
studies the phenomena of re-presentation as so many 
distinctly different modes of consciousness, i.e., of in-
tentionally referring to something (an object, event, 
etc.). The question Husserl pursued can be formulated 
in this way: how is the re-presentational effect that 
the diverse forms of re-presentation ha ve in common 
achieved? How is consciousness structured and how 
do the different components of its structure function 
so that we can have experiences in which something 
appears to us, yet is not integrated into the appearing 
world ofthe actual perceptual present? 

RE-PRESENTATION 
605 
Quite generally, phenomena of re-presentation 
( Vergegenwărtigung) are thus to be seen for Husserl 
in close relation to, yet at the same time in 
sharp contrast to, phenomena of simple presenta-
tion (Gegenwărtigung). In his mature account he will 
generalize the concept of re-presentation, as alluded 
to above. Translating both Vergegenwărtigung and 
Darstellung with the same term "re-presentation" can 
be taken to indicate that those Husserlian terms refer to 
twofundamentalforms of re-presentational conscious-
ness: ( 1) reproductive or purely mental re-presentation, 
and (2) perceptual re-presentation, i.e., re-presentation 
( Vergegenwărtigung) in a picture, in pictori al Darstel-
lung (re-presentation ). 
Husserl was first inspired to concern himself with 
the study of mental objectivations ( Vorstellungen) by 
FRANZ BRENTANO. Like Brentano he contrasted intuitive 
( or intuitional) objectivations with conceptual objec-
tivations belonging to the domain of MEANING (Bedeu-
tung, signification), which received his main attention 
in the six investigations published as the second part of 
the Logische Untersuchungen. Whereas an abject ora 
state of affairs (Sachverhalt) is signified in conceptual 
objectivation, it is generally characteristic of intuitive 
objectivations that in them an abject appears, either 
the abject itself or a picture (Bild) of the latter. One 
of the main tasks for the analysis of intuitive objecti-
vations consists then in setting off the diverse forms 
of intuitive re-presentation ( Vergegenwărtigung) from 
the basic form of intuitive consciousness, namely per-
ception understood as presentation ( Gegenwărtigung). 
Husserl mentions more than once Brentano's "un-
forgettable course oflectures on 'Selected Psychologi-
cal and Aesthetic Questions'" of 1885/86 at Vienna in 
which, according to him, Brentano strove nearly exclu-
sively after an analytical clarification ofthe objectiva-
tion ofimagination or phantasy in comparison with per-
ceptual objectivations. He crucially relied on a distinc-
tion between proper (authentic) and improper (inau-
thentic) objectivations (eigentliche und uneigentliche 
Vorstellungen) already elaborated earlier in lectures on 
logic; he discussed the distinction between conceptual 
and intuitive objectivations; and he examined the role 
of sensation (Empjindungen) in relation to imagina-
tion. The important point for Brentano was that ordi-
nary objectivations ofphantasy are not intuitions (An-
schauungen), but rather concepts with an intuitional 
nucleus. The core of his ideas of inauthenticity (Un-
eigentlichkeit) of objectivations was that they are me-
diated by relations or by concepts. 
Husserl gradually elaborated his own descriptive-
eidetic account of mental objectivating (Vorstellen), 
which permitted him to make fine-grained differenti-
ations by redefining the idea of inauthenticity within 
the range of intuitive objectivations, while at the same 
time, unlike Brentano, elaborating a sharp contrast be-
tween conceptual and intuitional objectivations. From 
early on, Husserl rejected the attempt, often pursued 
by philosophers, to account for the essential difference 
between perception and intuitive re-presentation, espe-
cially phantasy, in terms of characteristics of the intu-
itive content ofthese experiences, characteristics such 
as differences in liveliness, consistency, and elusive-
ness. Around the time of Logische Untersuchungen, he 
first defined a contrast between improper and proper 
objectivations obtaining within the range of the intu-
itive objectivations by distinguishing the act-character 
of pictoricity or iconicity (Bildlichkeit) from the act-
character of the self-giving of the abject in properly 
objectivating perception. Iconicity was seen to be an 
essentially novel way of intention, an indirect or medi-
ate and hence an improper one, characteristic of intu-
itive re-presentations. As such it is distinct both from 
Brentano's conceptual or relational inauthenticity and 
from the directness or authenticity ofperceptual inten-
tions. 
But Husserl was soon radically to question this ap-
proach to intuitive re-presentation. During an impor-
tant lecture course of 1904/05 he developed a new ac-
count ofthe matter. He carefully analyzed the relations 
of coexistence and conflict between the field of percep-
tion constitutive ofthe present and the field ofphantasy, 
showing that the latter, unlike what obtains in ordinary 
pictorial objectivation, does not constitute any picto-
rial object (Bildobjekt) appearing within the perceptual 
field of re gard. On this basis, he came to believe that 
in phantasy and remembering we do not ha ve anything 
present, that the relation to something present is totally 
absent from the phantasy and memory appearance, and 
he concluded that unlike the pictorial objectivation 
proper, the phantasy objectivation in itself and as such 
(and similarly for memory) does not contain a multi-
ple intention. Rather, he then thought, in phantasy (and 
in memory) a pure consciousness of re-presentation is 

606 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
performed, and what appears is immediately the non-
present. He considered phantasy, remembering, and 
analogously expectation as proper objectivatings of 
something, for these modes were seen as forms of re-
presenting something directly as it itself, comparable 
to properly presenting something directly as it itself 
in perception. Thus, for example, when we playfully 
phantasize angels and devils, dwarfs and nymphs, or 
when our memory carries us back into the past that 
passes by in our mind in intuitive ways, the appearing 
objects and events are not taken by us as pictorial ob-
jects (Bildobjekte), as mere representatives, analogies, 
or pictures of other objects and events; instead, Husserl 
then thought, these objects, etc., are re-presented di-
rectly as such, just as the perceived tree over there in 
the meadow is presented directly as such. In contrast, 
pictorial, symbolic, and signitive re-presentation were 
said tobe improper forms, for they in different ways 
ali objectivate something indirectly, while it itself is 
not directly given. 
This position, however, was not Husserl's last word 
about the achievement of the re-presentational effect. 
For the purpose of more deeply clarifying the pair 
of opposites, presentation and re-presentation, Husserl 
began, in the last part of the lectures of 1904/05, an 
analysis of inner time-consciousness. He saw an in-
timate connection between intuitive acts and time-
consciousness and realized that analyses of perceiv-
ing, imagining, remembering, and expecting could not 
be accomplished as long as the temporality of these 
acts was not taken into account, just as an analysis 
oftime-consciousness, on the other hand, presupposed 
to a large extent the study of those acts. He realized 
that only with the retum to the fundamental, tem-
porally interpreted distinction between impression or 
presentation ( Gegenwiirtigung) and reproduction or re-
presentation ( Vergegenwiirtigung) could the distinction 
between the immediate intuitability of what is bodily 
present (in perception) and what is not bodily present 
(in phantasy, memory, expectation) be made intelligi-
ble. 
In the years following his lectures, Husserl elab-
orated ever more clearly the intentiona! structure of 
re-presentation understood as reproductive modifica-
tion. He recognized that re-presentations "have a sec-
ond, differently structured intentionality, one which 
is proper to them alone and not to ali experiences." 
Briefly, this concems the fact that a re-presentation 
is not merely consciousness of an object but is in it-
self, in "inner consciousness" or time-consciousness, 
also a reproductive consciousness of the correspond-
ing impression, of the corresponding originary course 
in which consciousness ofthe now re-presented object 
was (will be) first constituted (in the past, in the future, 
in phantasy, or as pure possibility). One or two years 
before Jdeen zu einer reinen Phiinomenologie und 
phiinomenologischen Philosophie I (1913), he sums 
up this universal structure or "eidetic law" concern ing 
re-presentations in terms of intentiona! modification or 
implication of consciousness, casting it in a perspicu-
ous formula: it is the case that R(Pa) = V3 • For ex-
ample, the re-presentation of a house Va and the repro-
duction of the perception of this house R( Pa) exhibit 
the same phenomena. Normally, that is, whenever 1 do 
not perform a reflection in phantasy or memory, my in-
tentionality is directed toward the re-presented abject. 
However, it is not a matter here of a "simple" inten-
tionality but of a "peculiar mediacy." Importantly, this 
mediacy is no Ion ger interpreted as iconicity, nor is the 
re-presentational effect taken tobe a simple, direct in-
tentiona! reference to something re-presented. Rather, 
the mediacy or more complex intentiona! structure is 
now seen to rest on the fact that forme, for example, the 
past event cannot "directly'' attain to givenness aga in, 
but can do so only upon being mediated by a reproduc-
tive consciousness of the past experience of mine that 
was constitutive of the remembered event itself, etc. 
Husserl now understood the intentiona! structure ofre-
presentations in general to be a reproductive modifica-
tion of consciousness of something in such a way that a 
"re-presented present" ( vergegenwiirtigte Gegenwart), 
with ali its modes of the flow of consciousness, can be 
reflectively shown to be intentionally implied, be it a 
past, fu ture, possible, or merely phantasized present-
or, as in the special case of empathy, an alien present. 
Husserl's elaboration of the structure of the inner 
reproduction of acts enabled him to deepen the anal-
ysis of re-presentational consciousness in severa! re-
spects. Within the domain ofreproductive modification 
Husserl brought to bear the distinction between pasit-
ing (setzende) re-presentations, on the one hand, such 
as, e.g., acts of remembering and expectation, and, on 
the other hand, non-positing, inactual, or neutralized 
re-presentations, such as in pure phantasy and in the 

RE-PRESENTATION 
607 
re-presentation ofpictorial objects. As regards positing 
re-presentations, it is essential that the person performs 
them in an awareness of the actuality of belief. In the 
case of a memory, for example, the reproductively per-
formed experience of perceiving a landscape is given 
in the consciousness of the "again," which is a "be-
lieving consciousness." Above ali, he argues, this also 
means that forward-pointing and backward-pointing 
intentions adhere inseparably to the re-presented per-
ception, and the intentions serve to arrange the recol-
lected experience in the total nexus of the stream of 
the person's past consciousness. Analogous relation-
ships would hold for re-presentations relative to future 
experience. 
It is characteristic of positing re-presentations that, 
for example, in cases of error correction and of doubts, 
a person plays as it were one positing re-presentation 
off against the other, i.e., that the person moves 
throughout on the terrain of doxa (belieD and ali the 
possible belief modalities. In contrast, Husserl under-
stood pure phantasy as a neutralizing modification of 
the positing re-presentations. Stated quite generally, it 
is accordingly the case in phantasy ( or imagining) that 
the person does not actually experience ali the expe-
riences, whichever they may be (cognitive, emotional, 
etc.), but only re-presents them to him- or herself (in 
imagination, einbildend), performs them only inactu-
ally in a neutralizing manner, i.e., without a positing 
of belief. Thus, for instance, I phantasize a seeing of 
a flying elephant (whether I thereby draw myself into 
the phantasy-world or not); I feei as if I were see-
ing the animal in its surroundings, etc. It is similar 
for other merely re-presented experiences; it is as if 
1 were, say, speaking, doubting, questioning, willing, 
desiring, and so on. According to Husserl, the whole 
affair, be it a coherent phantasy-world, be it an incoher-
ent sequence of individual phantasy situations, is given 
in the modification of the as if, without performing a 
consciousness of belief or of positing -
it is given 
as unreality. Consequently, in the case of pure phan-
tasy -
that is, phantasy free of the consciousness of 
being mixed with a now or once actual experience-
a continuity of the re-presented experiences with the 
presently actual now makes no sense. For the world 
of phantasy is thoroughly a world of the as if without 
an absolute spatial and temporal position in objective 
space and time. 
Moreover, Husserl carefully analyzed what he 
called phenomena of overlapping ( Verdeckung) or con-
flict ofintuitions, which is connected with the fact that 
in the stream of consciousness nothing is thinkable in 
isolation from the rest ofthe stream. Whatever is given 
seemingly in isolation, such as a phantasy, in truth 
overlaps (verdeckt) something in the actually given 
world. He argues that an intuitable "at the same time" 
of presence ( Gegenwart) and absence or nonpresence 
(Nichtgegenwart), say, something nonpresent posited 
in the past, or the future, or something merely phan-
tasized, is impossible. Regarding these relationships, 
he points out, in particular, that however much the 
surrounding perceptual world may Iose its "actuality" 
when a person is living in re-presentational conscious-
ness, the perceptual would does not vanish from his or 
her consciousness altogether, or else the person world 
no Ion ger be re-presenting but simply presenting anab-
ject or event by way of ( day)dreaming, hallucinating, 
suffering a trance, or undergoing a vision. What was 
thus intuited would at once ha ve the character of the 
"itself-there," of bodily present actuality, and would 
also be believed in and no longer merely be given in 
the consciously experienced modification ofthe "as if' 
or the "as it were again" and the like. 
Husserl's analysis of the other fundamental form 
of intuitive re-presentational consciousness- namely 
re-presentation in a picture, usually called picture-
consciousness (Bildbewusstsein)- makes clear that 
pictorial objectivation is in a way a combination of 
presentation and re-presentation. The re-presentation 
here involved is no longer purely mentally reproduc-
tive, as in phantasy and memory, but is rather perceptu-
ally founded. In the lecture course of 1904/05 Husserl 
develops his views about the phenomena of iconicity 
(Bildlichkeit) in close contrast to the consciousness of 
phantasy. It was precisely in opposition to mental im-
ages or mental iconicity that he there speaks of physical 
iconicity in the case of picture-consciousness proper. 
More specifically, the re-presentational effect of a con-
sciousness of depiction or of a re-presentation in a 
picture (in the sense of Vergegenwiirtigung as Darstel-
lung im Bild) can, according to Husserl, be achieved in 
the following two essentially distinct modes: it can take 
place as inner (or immanent) iconicity oras outer (or 
transcendent) iconicity, the latter being subsumed un-
der a broader concept of symbolic re-presentation. As 

608 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Husserl explains, inner iconicity is the basic, genuine 
form of properly pictorial re-presentation. 
To understand his distinction of these two modes, 
it is important to appreciate his distinction of the 
following three types of objects involved in picture-
consciousness: ( 1) the picture (Bild) as a physical thing 
that is given perceptually, as hanging on the wall, etc.; 
(2) the picture (Bild) qua pictarial abject (Bildabjekt) 
-for example, the landscape that appears "perceptu-
ally" ( on the canvas, the photograph, etc.), and yet is 
not apprehended as actual reality; and (3) the picture-
subject (Bild-subjet), for example the landscape itself. 
Now in inner iconicity we behold the subject in the 
picture itself; as Husserl describes the experience, the 
pictorial object itself intuitively makes objective the 
subject, and this to a greater or lesser extent, according 
to a greater or smaller number of iconifying moments, 
such that what appears is meant, that we behold the 
similar in the similar. By contrast, in outer iconicity 
the picture shall, by means of similarity and by other 
entwined relations, make objective something differ-
ent from what appears in the pictorial object itself; here 
the similar only points to the similar as sign. 
In the inner iconicity, the nonpresent, the depicted 
object, does not appear yet a second time in addition 
to the appearance ofthe pictorial object. For example, 
when a person views a picture of a tree in an aware-
ness of inner iconicity, the depicted (real or fictional) 
tree does not appear somehow separately from, or in 
addition to, the tree's pictorially appearing in the pic-
ture in front of the person. Rather, the tree appears, it 
is depicted (bildet sich ab) or re-presented (stellt sich 
dar), in the "present" pictorial object. In the appearing 
pictorial object, the person "views," in the modified 
way of a neutralized re-presentational viewing, the 
subject immanently. Husserl thus speaks of a dauble 
abject (doppelte Gegenstăndlichkeit) or an object-pair 
( Gegenstandspaar), namely, the unity of the depicted 
object as it appears in the pictorial object in virtue of 
two apprehensions penetrating (durchdringen) one an-
other in a foundational relationship within the pictorial 
objectivation. The conscious relation to the subject, 
as he argues, is consciousness of the re-presentation 
(Vergegenwărtigung) of something that does not ap-
pear, within that which does appear, a consciousness 
that arises on the basis of some similarity. 
The appearing pictorial object, however, has the 
character of unreality, of mere semblance (blosser 
Schein) in the midst of the perceptually appearing 
surroundings of the picture that, as a physical thing, 
does itself belong to the perceptually given world. 
But Husserl makes clear in numerous texts that in 
the case of pictorial re-presentation, the conscious-
ness of semblance or unreality cannot be a matter of 
fiction-consciousness in the sense of an illusion, for 
properly speaking, the pictorial object does not ap-
pear within the unity of the perceptually real world, 
but rather within a space of its own that in itself has 
no direct relation to real space. Picture-consciousness, 
then, is re-presentational consciousness, but it is not 
purely reproductively, purely mentally re-presenting 
consciousness like phantasy, etc. Rather, it is percep-
tual re-presentation, i.e., penetrating a founding per-
ceptual consciousness, not unlike, in this respect, sig-
nitive or symbolizing consciousness, where the symbol 
appears for itselfbut is the bearer of a relation to some-
thing else that is designated therein. 
As subsequent work by some !ater phenomenolog-
ically oriented philosophers shows, the topic of re-
presentation in the Husserlian acceptation received 
further attention and elaboration. To mention a few 
signposts, there is EUGEN FINK 's inaugural disserta-
tion of 1929, entitled Vergegenwărtigung und Bild. 
Beitrăge zur Phănomenologie der Unwirklichkeit (Re-
presentation and image. Contribution to the phenomen-
ology of unreality), which the author elaborated un-
der Husserl 's guidance in close connection to, as Fink 
put it, the problem horizons opened up by Husserl. 
A fine study of re-presentational experiences, pub-
lished in 1968 under the title Zur Wesenslehre des 
psychischen Lebens und Erlebens (On the essential 
doctrine of psychic life and living), was written in 
the 1940s by THEODOR coNRAD, a former student of 
Theodor Lipps and !ater of Husserl. Of special interest 
here is Conrad's elaboration of what he called expe-
riences of displacement ofthe EGo, or I-experiencing-
situations ( Vesetzungserlebnisse ), showing an unremit-
ing shift of being-here and being-elsewhere in one's 
mind. Again in many ways close to Husserlian 
themes, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE's L 'imaginaire: Psycholo-
gie phimomenologique de l'imagination ( 1940) offers 
nonetheless an original contribution ofhis own, already 
prefiguring important metaphysical tenets of L 'etre et 
le neant ( 1943) that transcend the properly phenomen-

o logica! methodology. More recently, 1so KERN, in Idee 
und Methode der Philosophie (Idea and method ofphi-
losophy, 1975), has illuminatingly placed the Husser-
lian concept of re-presentation ( Vergegenwiirtigung) 
at the center of a systematic treatise on the notion of 
REASON, arguing forcefully for a fundamental differ-
ence between the constitutive achievements ofpresen-
tational and re-presentational consciousness, respec-
tively, and for a connection of the notion of the 1 
with re-presentational consciousness only, and not with 
consciousness in general. In a number of publications 
over the last twenty years, ROBERT soKOLOWSKI has also 
developed the theme of presence and absence as it 
is involved in diverse forms of re-presentation, pay-
ing particular attention to the phenomenon of ego-
displacement and the achievement of identity in re-
presentational consciousness. LESTER EMBREE, too, has 
made productive use of the Husserlian distinction be-
tween presentational and re-presentational awareness 
in severa! papers, applying it, for example, to archae-
ological observation. Very recently, EDUARD MARBACH, 
guided by Kem 's systematic clarification of Husserl 's 
concept ofre-presentation, has proposed a phenomen-
ological notation in order to reveal clear-cut distinc-
tions among different forms of mentally re-presenting 
and thereby intentionally referring to something.

Along with SIMONE DE BEAU-
VOIR, MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, and JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, 
Ricreur was one of the first philosophers in France to 
be influenced by EDMUND HUSSERL and to use a version 
of the phenomenological method in his own works. 
For many years, Ricreur has been seen as the principal 
representative ofphenomenology in France, although, 
as we will see, his views have shifted radically over 
the years from a fairly orthodox phenomenology -
by French standards- to his most recent interest and 
writing on narrative. The latter shares with Husserlian 
phenomenology only its interest in understanding the 
WORLD and human ACTION and its commitment to de-
scription and narration over scientific or philosophical 
theorizing. From beginning to end, Ricreur remains a 
"reflexive" philosopher concerned with understanding 
ofthe self. His method or orientation has changed from 
a Husserlian EIDETIC METHOD to an EXISTENTIAL PHENO-
MENOLOGY, and then to a HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMEN-
OLOGY, culminating in his elegant Soi-meme comme 
un autre (Self as another, 1990), which calls on the 
results of severa! philosophical methods, but always 
with the aim of reflectively understanding the self and 
its relation with others. 
Paul Ricreur was born in 1913 in Valence in southern 
France, where his father, originally from Normandy, 
was a high-school teacher. His mother died when he 
was only a few months old and his father was killed in 
the battle of the Mame in 1915. He was rai sed in Brit-

610 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
tany by his paterna! grandparents. His education was at 
the University ofRennes and the Sorbonne. In 1935, he 
received his Agregation and began teaching in lycees. 
During this period he was a devout pacifist, socialist, 
and Protestant, strongly influenced by GABRIEL MARCEL 
and Roland Dalbiez. 
Ricreur was mobilized in the fali of 1939 as an in-
fantry officer with the 47th Infantry Regiment from 
St. Malo. He was captured in June 1940 and spent 
the next five years in a German prisoner ofwar camp 
in north-eastern Germany. After the war, he went to 
Chambon-sur-Lignon where he taught at the College 
Cevanol. This town was famous for sheltering thou-
sands of French and foreign Jews and helping them 
escape to Switzerland or Spain. It was here that his 
prison camp notes and journals were turned into his 
first books on Marcel and KARL JASPERS and into his 
first major work on the phenomenology ofthe will. 
In 1948, he was called to the chair of the history of 
philosophy at Strasbourg, a successor to Jean Hyppo-
lite (1907-1968). Eight years !ater, he succeded Ray-
mond Bayer in the Chair of general philosophy at the 
Sorbonne. During this period, he was attached to the 
Centre Nationale de Recherche Scientifique as the di-
rector of the Husserl Archives in Paris. In 1966, he 
left the Sorbonne to become o ne of the founding pro-
fessors at the new branch of the University of Paris at 
Nanterre, a suburb west of Paris. He had written exten-
sively on reforming the university and believed that a 
new university would be an occasion for seeing these 
reforms put into practice. Unfortunately, this was not 
to be the case. In 1969, Ricreur was elected principal 
administratorofNanterre. By then, the famous "Events 
of May 1968" began at Nanterre, were quickly trans-
posed to Paris, then returned to Nanterre. There were 
daily battles between leftist and rightist students, an 
invasion of the campus by petty criminals from the 
neighborhood, and an atmosphere charged with unrest 
and rebellion. This situation culminated with a three-
day battle between students and police that left the 
new buildings severely damaged. Ricreur, having been 
physically attacked once and his office occupied on 
severa! occasions, resigned. He took a three-year lea ve 
of absence from the French university. 
This was the beginning of a twenty-year "exile" dur-
ing which he taught at the University of Chicago, suc-
ceeding Paul Tillich ( 1886-1965) in the John Nuveen 
Chair. He also taught in Belgium at the University of 
Leuven and lectured ali over Europe, Japan, and many 
other countries. His writings from this period on reflect 
the increasing influence of Anglo-American ORDINARY 
LANGUAGE PHILOSOPHY, and Ricreur brilliantly exp\oits 
this tradition in a dialectic with the phenomenological 
tradition ofhis early works. During much ofthis period 
he still taught at Nanterre, until taking his retirement 
in 1980. For the next ten years he continued to teach at 
the University of Chicago and lecture extensively. In 
1991, he retired from his chair at Chicago. 
In the winter of 1986, Ricreur gave the Gifford Lec-
tures in Scotland. These lectures were revised and re-
fined over a four-year period and became his most 
recent major work, Soi-meme comme un autre. What 
is so remarkable is that after his 65th birthday, he has 
written five major works and fifty or sixty articles. 
Husserl had become known to French philosophers 
during the late 1930s. His theories and views were 
discussed, although his works had not yet been trans-
lated into French. Ricreur's chance to study Husserl 's 
work thoroughly carne during his captivity in a Ger-
man prisoner of war camp from June 1940 until May 
1945. During this period, he also read MARTIN HEIDEG-
GER and KARL JASPERS and wrote the outline and first 
draft of his own first major work. In 1943, thanks to 
the Swiss Red Cross, Ricreur obtained a copy of the 
third edition ( 1928) of Husserl 's Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 and for the next year and a halfread and studied 
it. He began translating it into French in the margins 
of the book. After the war, he finished his translation, 
notes, and commentary, and they were published in 
1950. 
In his first major work, Le volontaire et 
l 'involontaire ( 1950), Ricreur follows the Husserlian 
method partway. He used the EIDETIC METHOD to dis-
clase the fundamental structures of willing or of the 
will. He says that in the first instance, phenomenology 
is a description that uses an analytic method, asking 
what does it mean to speak of willing, acting, desi r-
ing, and so forth. On Ricreur's reading, at this stage 
of conceptual analysis the eidetic reduction "brackets" 
or suspends acceptance ofthe actuality of examples of 
individuals deciding and acting in the world, but rather 
concentrates on the network of concepts or eide that 
make up the field of willing, such as motive, project, 

PAUL RICCER

action, agent, cause, necessity, consent, and so forth. 
From a methodological point of view, Ricceur says 
phenomenology presupposes the fundamental discur-
sivity of every subjective process (vecu, Erlebnis), thus 
opening it to reflection, description, and analysis. This 
approach converges chiefly with REALISTIC PHENOMEN-
OLOGY. 
In applying this method to the will, Ricceur claims 
that there are three fundamental structures (Ricceur 
calls them "moments") to willing: decision, voluntary 
movement, and consent. Each of these meanings of 
willing or of the voluntary is reciproca! with a corre-
sponding experience ofthe involuntary. Motives; effort 
and resistance; and necessity represented by character, 
the unconscious, and life form a reciproca! dialectic 
with the voluntary. Each term or pole, the "voluntary'' 
and the "involuntary," is intelligible only in relation-
ship to the other. In terms of understanding, the vol-
untary aspects of the will have precedence over the 
corresponding involuntary: needs and wants become 
motives only when they are possible reasons for a 
choice. Effort and resistance ofthe body and the world 
gain their significance from voluntary action. Finally, 
the absolute necessities of character, the unconscious, 
and life take on their meaning in relation to the act of 
consent in which the voluntary is reconciled with these 
features ofthe involuntary. 
As phenomenology developed in France, it moved 
away from abstract descriptions of eide -
and from 
Husserl 's idealistic ambitions- and was increasingly 
animated by certain "existential" themes originating in 
the work of Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche. 
Three of the most important existential themes are 
the "lived BODY," (le corps vecu), "freedom," and the 
"other." The body-as-subject- the incamate self, as 
Marcel puts it- is a refusal to accept the dichotomy 
of an incorporeal and anonymous epistemological sub-
ject on the one hand and the body as a physical object 
among objects on the other. This dualism, inherited 
from Descartes, was rejected and overcome by the 
analyses of Marcel, Merleau-Ponty, and Ricceur. The 
inftuence of existential phenomenology on Ricceur is 
seen in the very choice of the will as object of pheno-
menological description. His discovery ofthe recipro-
ca! relation between the voluntary and the involuntary 
reinserts the subject into a world of choice and respon-
sibility against a background of necessity. One thread 
that unites ali ofRicceur's work is thus an abiding con-
cern with the "acting and suffering individual," i.e., 
with the individual who not only acts, but "lives" and 
"undergoes." 
The existential component of Ricceur's existential 
phenomenology is also found in his bracketing the 
"fault" and "transcendence" for the sake of his ei-
detic description of the fundamental structures of the 
will. However, he treats the fault directly in Finitude 
et culpabilite ( 1960). The first part, L 'hommefaillible 
(Fallible man), is a transcendental study in the manner 
of KANT ofthe conditions necessary for evi! or sin (the 
fa uit) tobe possible. His answer, in the briefest terms, is 
that there is a disproportion within humankind itselfbe-
tween our possibilities and our limitations that renders 
us "fragile": when will we have enough possessions, 
when will we have enough power, and when will other 
people respect and esteem me? Ricceur moves from 
the structural possibility of evi! to its actual avowal in 
the second part, entitled La symbolique du mal (Sym-
bolism of evi!). His thesis is that evi! is never de-
scribed literally, but is always spoken of symbolically 
or metaphorically, for example, in terms of sta in, bur-
den, errance, separation, or captivity. He explains the 
importance of symbols or double-meaning terms and 
the methods of their interpretation. The myths of cre-
ation or origin of the uni verse, including the Adamic 
myth, are first-order explanations of the origin of evi! 
in the world. 
The other two existential themes of"freedom" and 
the "other" are also constants in Ricceur's work, from 
his first writings on the will to his most recent work 
on the self and the other. His interests have been and 
stil! are "existential," although his methods and ap-
proaches have changed from eidetic to hermeneutica! 
phenomenology. 
His interest in the symbolism of evilleads Ricceur to 
an interest in symbolic Janguage and interpretation in 
general. He broadens the scope of symbols to include 
oneiric and cultural symbols and extends interpreta-
tion to include ali of the techniques of Freudian PSY-
CHOANALYSIS. In De 1 'interpretation: Essai sur Freud 
( 1965), he claims that Janguage is the crossroads of ali 
philosophical approaches and provides a common in-
teres! for ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY as well as ORDINARY LAN-
GUAGE PHILOSOPHY. The underlying concern of Freud is 
a semantics of desire: how do desires manifest them-

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
selves in speech; how are they expressed and how does 
speech fail to express them? It is this rapport between 
desi re and meaning that gives psychoanalysis a promi-
nent place in any philosophy ofLANGUAGE. Throughout 
this book, he establishes a dialectic between symbolic 
language that is a distortion or mask or promotes an il-
lusion, and symbolic language that can be a revelation 
of the sacred. 
The question of method here is how is HERMENEU-
Tics stiU a phenomenology. He says that hermeneutica! 
phenomenology is a reflexive philosophy that remains 
within the fundamental inspiration ofHusserl's pheno-
menology. From the very beginning, Ricc.eur has re-
jected Husserl 's attempt to establish a self-foundational 
philosophy. He rejects any Cartesian -
or Husser-
lian -
attempt to found knowledge and the self on 
immediate and transparent consciousness. The most 
fundamental truth, the cogito, is as empty as it is cer-
tain. The self can only be understood by the "detour" 
through works, actions, literature, and institutions. Ali 
self-understanding requires a hermeneutics oftexts and 
text-like structures. In turn, this is how hermeneuti-
ca! phenomenology frees itself from the idealism that 
Husserl thought was essential to phenomenology. 
But in what way is hermeneutics stil! a kind of 
phenomenology? First of ali, it is phenomenology, 
claims Ricc.eur, that did not remain faithful to its fun-
damental discovery of intentionality: the meaning of 
consciousness !ies outside ofitself. In Logische Unter-
suchungen (1900--190 1 ), Husserl is interested in ex-
pression and the MEANING of consciousness and inten-
tionality. Consciousness is outside of itself, directed 
toward meaning. This is what the central discovery of 
phenomenology implies. Second, the most fundamen-
tal phenomenological presupposition of hermeneutics 
is that every question about any sort of being is a 
question about the meaning of that being. As a re-
suit, hermeneutica! phenomenology consists in the use 
of ali the interpretative methods of hermeneutics to 
accomplish the fundamental goal and inspiration of 
phenomenology. 
To say this slightly differently, Ricc.eur claims 
that there is a continuity between phenomenology 
and hermeneutics, as well as a discontinuity between 
hermeneutics and CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY. Both 
phenomenology and hermeneutics are committed to an 
understanding ofthe selfand both are reflexive meth-
ods that start in the middle of things, with both the 
world and our intersubjective experiences as givens. 
But Ricc.eur rejects Husserl 's idealistic interpretation, 
which depends on intuitive and immediate grasping of 
the essences of mental phenomena. He also rejects the 
goal of a scientific phenomenology that could found 
or establish the ultimate conceptual foundation of ali 
thought. For Ricc.eur, there is never an absolute start-
ing point ora self-validating foundation. His continuai 
concern for understanding human action and suffer-
ing requires the long detour through an interpretation 
of the symbols, texts, monuments, works, and institu-
tions that mediate our understanding of the self and its 
relation to others. Phenomenology opened up the field 
ofthe "meaningful," while hermeneutics-rather than 
an eidetic or transcendental reduction- is the appro-
priate method. 
The hermeneutica! method is extended from the 
interpretation of texts to the creation of poetic and 
narrative meaning in Ricc.eur's next two books, La 
Metaphore vive (The living metaphor, 1975) and Temps 
et rixit !, Il, III (Time and narrative, 1983, 1984, 
1985). Although they were published eight years apart, 
Ricc.eur claims that they are "twins" sin ce they are both 
devoted to semantic innovation. The thesis of the first 
book is that the destruction of literal meaning in a 
metaphor permits a new meaning to ari se. In the same 
way, the reference of the literal sentence is replaced 
by a second reference, that of the metaphor. The cre-
ative and poetic function of metaphor only appears to 
ruin its referential function. Rather, Ricc.eur says that it 
creates a new reference that allows us to describe or, 
better, redescribe the woRLD, or part of the world, that 
was inaccessible to direct and literal description. Po-
etic language makes a new "world" appear, the world 
of the work. This world is "fu sed" with the everyday 
world of action and represents a possible world forme, 
a world in which I could live and act and suffer. In 
short, the poetic creation of metaphor allows us to say 
something new about the world of our experience. 
In the three-volume work on time and narrative, 
Ricc.eur patiently shows how narratives create new 
meaning by the synthesis of heterogeneous elements 
(purposes, intentions, causes, chance events, desires, 
etc.). Through the activity of emplotment these dis-
parate elements are woven into a story and a new 
order of congruence arises from apparently discon-

PAUL RICG:R 
613 
nected happenings. The plot of a story is similar to 
the metaphorical process in that it makes a new whole. 
It integrates diverse events, chance occurrences, and 
especially, human actions into a complete story. 
The experience oftime is inextricably bound up with 
narrative. Ali narratives are fundamentally temporal 
and they serve as the privileged access to our confused, 
unformed, and at the limit mute temporal experience. 
The central thesis of this entire trilogy is that TIME 
becomes human time to the extent that it is organized 
into narratives and narratives are meaningful to the 
extent that they represent our temporal existence. 
Rica::ur begins his analysis of time and narrative 
-
and the extended test of his thesis -
by a care fui 
account of St. Augustine's struggle with the concept 
oftime and Aristotle's explanation ofhow emplotment 
creates a meaningful whole out of disparate elements, 
a new order out of disorder, a coherent narrative out of 
disconnected elements. Time and narrative are brought 
together in mimesis praxeos, the creative imitation of 
human action. Mimesis belongs to both the imaginary 
world and the real world of action. It is at the center of 
historical narratives and fictional narratives. 
The remainder of this magisterial work is a long and 
patient test ofhis thesis through a careful examination 
of the epistemoJogy of HISTORY and LITERATURE. He 
claims that if history breaks its bonds with the basic 
competence we ha veto follow a story, then it loses its 
distinctive character and is reduced to one ofthe other 
HUMAN SCIENCES. In the second volume, he engages 
current literary theorists on the function of narrative 
and illustrates his thesis by a thorough analysis ofthree 
famous novels dominated by time: Virginia Woolf's 
Mrs. Dalloway, Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, 
and Marcel Proust's Rememberance ofThings Pas!. 
In the final volume, Rica::ur reviews the aporias of 
time and ali ofthe attempts to resolve them in the his-
tory of philosophy. He takes up the debate between 
Kant and Husserl and between Heidegger and "meta-
physics" on the nature oftime. He examines the relation 
between the experience of time and the time of na-
ture, and discusses the reality of the historical past. He 
finishes this study with a discussion of the hermeneu-
tics of historical time. His conclusion is that ali of the 
philosophical attempts have failed and only narratives 
of time give us refl.ective access to the experience of 
time. 
Each successive work deviates more from the orig-
inal eidetic phenomenology, yet retains a core of ei-
detic, existential, and hermeneutica! phenomenology. 
The eidetic element is the concern to work out the 
"constitution" of central concepts such as metaphor, 
mimesis, and the whole conceptual network of action 
and agent. The existential element is in Rica::ur's abid-
ing goal ofunderstanding human action and suffering, 
and in understanding ourselves, our relations with oth-
ers, and our social and politica! institutions. Finally, his 
work remains faithful to the demand of hermeneutica! 
phenomenology that we can come to understand our-
selves only through the "long path" of understanding 
our texts, actions, monuments, and institutions.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
RUSSIA 
The investigation of consciousness in 
19th century Russian philosophy anticipated pheno-
menology in some respects and was an important 
preparatory factor for its rapid and broad reception 
early in the 20th century. 
Already the fathers ofthe Slavophil school, Ivan V. 
Kireyevsky (1806--1856) and Aleksei S. Khomyakov 
( 1804-1860), conceived the problem of consciousness 
as going beyond the theory of knowledge and related 
it to the question of the integrity of human spiritual 
life. For Kireyevsky, philosophy "is not just one of 
the fields of science, nor is it faith. Rather, it is the 
grand total of and general foundation for ali the fields 
of science and a conductor of thought between them 
and faith." The inner integri(v of the mind, the focus 
of selfconsciousness, and the unity of the mental and 
spiritual powers ali have for him an ontologica! sta-
tus and require an "inner consciousness" assumed to 
accompany every mental process. And the peculiarity 
ofthe thought process ofthe Greek Orthodox believer 
consists, according to him, in a dual effort: "While 
keeping track of the development of his understand-
ing, he, at the same time, keeps track of the mode of 
his thinking, continually striving to elevate his mind 
to a level on which he could feei in harmony with his 
faith." 
Khomyakov anticipates the Husserlian distinction 
between meaning-intention and meaning-fulfillment 
by differentiating the consciousness necessarily ac-
companying ali rational actions, "but not yet fully clear 
about itself," from the consciousness that concludes a 
given action and recognizes "an agreement of the ap-
pearance with the thought." Moreover, he holds that a 
higher consciousness is inherent in humankind, albeit 
in a rather slight degree, and it can comprehend the 
relation of a particular appearance with the universal 
law governing the appearance. This "higher conscious-
ness" is in fact consciousness o fan ideal abject. The de-
grees ofconsciousness are manifold, from mere aware-
ness to complete understanding. "The world ofthe sub-
jective consciousness with its space and time is as real 
as the o uter world." Khomyakov also differentiates be-
tween the logica! and the life-immersed consciousness 
and sees the latter as centered in the will. Thanks to 
the will, one can distinguish what has been made in the 
world of things, the objective world, through creative 
(subjective) activity from what has been produced in-
dependently of it. The intrinsic similarities between 
the ear]y SJavophiJs and FRANZ BRENTANO and EDMUND 
HUSSERL may furthermore be seen in how they ali con-
nect the being of consciousness with the search for 
ways to rejuvenate humanity's spirituallife against the 
background of crisis in Western cui ture. 
Michail 1. Karinsky (1840-1917), professor at the 
St. Petersburg Theological Academy beginning in 
1867, may rightly be called the Russian Brentano. Like 
Brentano and long before the latter's article on the 
faur phases of philosophy, Karinsky had objected in 
his Kriticheski obzor poslednego perioda germanskoi 
.filosofii (Critica! review ofthe latest period in German 
philosophy, 1873) to irrational tendencies traceable 
back to KANT. In an article on appearance and reality, he 
furthermore and quite independently ofBrentano made 
the following fundamental phenomenological distinc-
tions. There is a distinction between the things of the 
externa! world that "cannot squeeze themselves into 
our consciousness," and representations as substitutes 
for reality, the substitutes being essential for commu-
nication. This distinction rests on the observation that 
each of us is not alone in the world. Like Brentano, 
Karinsky denies any distinction between reality and 
appearance in the inner world; "the states of percep-
tion, thought, or emotional agitation can be none other 
than facts, than reality." He denies that the EGO is the 
real basis of consciousness, which would ha ve led to 
the understanding ofthe real subject and its mental pro-
cesses as appearances. Although he does not use the 
term "inner perception," his descriptions of conscious-
ness are clase to those of Brentano: "Any ordinary 
change of a given psychic state is followed at lightning 
speed by the memory of it, which in turn gives place 
to a new state ... we continually respond to the inner 
states being experienced by us .... " 
The outstanding Russian philosopher of the 19th 
century, Vladimir Solovyov ( 1853-1900), developed 
a concept of "philosophia prima" in Teoreticheskaya 
.filosofia (Theoretical philosophy, 1897-99) that is es-
sentially similar to phenomenology. He reasons from 
the assumption that philosophy strives for absolute cer-
tainty and truth and that it ought to be free from any 
presuppositions; "theoretical philosophy should have 
its starting point in itself, the process ofthinking has to 
start from the very beginning." Unequivocally true is 
the knowledge that we experience certain inner states 

RUSSIA 
and inner actions, such as feelings, images, desires, res-
olutions, etc.; this is reflected in the words so-znanie, 
con-scientia, Bewusstsein (the prefix "be" rei ating back 
to "bei," Bei-wusstsein). 
Pure consciousness (a term used by Solovyov) or 
the knowledge of psychic processes has quite narrow 
boundaries. "In the pure consciousness there is no dif-
ference between the imaginary and the real." On the 
other hand, in pure consciousness things are given in 
their definitiveness- for example, a fireplace as seen 
in a dream, a hallucination, or normal perception is 
always a fireplace and never a chessboard. 
The other type of truth !ies in the realm of logi-
ca! thought. The very assertion that the psychic data 
are self-evident is a thought going beyond any sin-
gle psychic act. The generalizing thinking "outgrows" 
and transcends the present state of consciousness. Two 
essentially different parts coexist necessarily in any 
thought, i.e., "the single state of the subjective con-
sciousness and the thought which is formulated ... in 
a general manner." Logica! thinking has as its "mate-
rial" the facts of the immediate consciousness, but it 
is not directly inferred from them -
it is conditiona! 
upon the memory that retains various psychic states and 
provides "timeproof' psychic material for making the 
words that are the proper element of logica! thinking. 
The word is a symbol, i.e., "a sign uniting in itself the 
present singular and the universal meaning." Thus "the 
memory is something supratemporal in consciousness, 
and the word is both supratemporal and supraspatial." 
But the logica! generality of thinking is not the truth 
itself, but a route toward it and a means by which it 
may be found. 
In his reflections on the immediate presence ofpsy-
chic states, Solovyov is el o se to Brentano's understand-
ing ofiNTENTIONALITY, while what he says about logica! 
thinking reminds o ne of the Husserlian concept of ab-
straction and ofthe latter's differentiation between the 
physical and the sense-giving components of the ex-
pression ("the word as sound tums out to be a mobile 
shell of the word as sense"). Analogous to Brentano 
and the early Husserl and apparently under Karinsky's 
influence, Solovyov objects to the conception of the 
subject or ego as the real basis in which ali our expe-
riences and reactions are allegedly rooted and as the 
"supreme principle of consciousness." 
Solovyov argues that Descartes makes an incorrect

transition from the self-evident fact of thinking to the 
metaphysical subject inherited from Scholasticism and 
does not distinguish between, on the one hand, the pure 
subject of thinking -
which can be none other than 
one phenomenological fact among many, even though 
it differs from the psychic states in beingjust their link-
ing empty form or "a colorless channel through which 
the stream ofpsychic being passes" -and, on the other 
hand, the empirica! ego, which is not self-evident. Nei-
ther ego can provide the foundation for philosophical 
thinking. The genuine philosophical subject is charac-
terized by his or her resolve to know TRUTH. And it is the 
truth rather than our ego, be it even transcendentally 
expanded, that is the starting point of philosophical 
cognition. 
In "O prirode chelovecheskogo soznaniya" (On the 
nature of human consciousness, 1889-91) and in the 
introduction to Metafizika drevnei Gretsii (The meta-
physics of ancient Greece, 1890), Prin ce Sergei N. Tru-
betskoi ( 1862-1905) develops a metaphysical theory 
of consciousness, the theory of the supraindividual ba-
sis of consciousness, which also contains, as it were, 
"phenomenological seeds." Consciousness is "a collec-
tive function ofhumankind ... , a li ve and concrete uni-
versal process." The real, the universal, the objective 
may be achieved only on the condition that every indi-
vidual consciousness enters into the unity of ali indi-
vidual consciousnesses. Conci1iatoriness (sobornost ') 
is in Trubetskoi a notion analogous to Husserl 's tran-
scendental INTERSUBJECTIVITY, which becomes realiz-
able thanks to the fact that in its acts the individual 
consciousness goes beyond its own (psychological) 
confines. 
The primary condition for experience is the ability 
to distinguish one state of consciousness from another. 
This ability exists only in virtue of the inner TIME in-
herent in consciousness and passing inside it. Time 
as a fact of consciousness secures the latter's extra-
empirical sta tus: the empirica! actuality of the present 
is in reality the actuality of the past, and the present 
is grasped by consciousness only in the future. Trubet-
skoi distinguishes the reality from its representation or 
image in regard to both the externa! things and one's 
own consciousness. The representation is a substitute 
for reality (as with Karinsky), but reality is irreplace-
able: we do not cognize the reality of a thing; rather, 
we become conscious of it in exactly the same way as

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
we become aware of our own existence. 
The reception of Husserl 's phcnomenology in Rus-
sia dates from the beginning of the 20th century. The 
assimilation of Brentano 's and Husserl 's ideas appears 
to have begun in Russia earlier than elsewhere. David 
Viktorov was o ne of the first to expound the antipsy-
chologistic position of Husserl in the light of the ob-
jections directed against Emst Mach's principle ofthe 
economy of thinking. 
NICOLAI LOSSKY was the first in Russian philosophy 
to comment on the second volume of Husserl's Lo-
gische Untersuchungen ( 1900--1901 ). In works such 
as Obosnovanie intuitivizma (The foundation of intu-
itivism, 1906), he expounds his interesting views on 
the universal and particular, views that amount to a 
defense of realism (in medieval terms) and are typo-
logically close to phenomenology. Lossky reinforces 
his arguments by invoking Husserl's ideas as applied 
to the following points. ( 1) ldentity as an absolutely 
indefinite concept is a presupposition for the equality 
or similarity of objects. The general and the partic-
ular do not absorb one another; "thinking about the 
universal is by no means always a thinking about a 
class, in fact, it may be equally performed as a think-
ing about the general that is a self-contained element 
('spezifische Einzelheit' as contrasted to 'individual 
Einzelheit' in Husserl 's terminology)." And in his pa-
per "Transtcendentalno-fenomenologicheski idealizm 
Gusserlya" (Husserl 's transcendental phenomenologi-
cal idealism, 1939), Lossky proceeds mainly from the 
Cartesianische Meditationen [ 1931]; using the French 
translation, he subjects the Husserlian concepts of con-
stitutive intentionality and intersubjectivity to criti-
cisms, and drawing support from LUDWIG LANDGREBE's 
"Husserls Phănomenologie und die Motive zu ihrer 
Umbildung" ( 1939), he points out that Husserl had 
shifted to a nea-Kantian position. 
In "Edmund Gusserl i psichologisty nashikh dney" 
(Edmund Husserl and contemporary defenders ofpsy-
chologism, 1908), GEORGI LANTS develops Husserl 's 
anti-psychologism. The concept ofintentionality is re-
lated to the notion of truth and the ideal object and 
follows Husserl. Emphasizing the affinity with Plato, 
Lants suggest the following image: truth "is the realm 
of pure science. The world ofbeing is reftected in ali its 
details in this realm as in an immovable mirror. Each 
abject, every tiny part ofthe abject, throws its shadow, 
its ideal specter, there ... " Lanz !ater moved to the 
UNITED STATES and taught at Stanford University. 
The first two Russian translations of Husserl were 
of the first volume of the Logische Untersuchungen 
in 1909 and "Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft" 
( 1911) in 1911. Boris Yakovenko ( 1884-1948) pub-
lished in Novye idei v filosofii ( 1913) an assessment of 
the Logische Untersuchungen that was more detailed 
and critica! than that ofLants. While noting the merits 
of considering the logica! as an ontologica! category 
and recognizing that supersensuous intuition is nec-
essary for the process of cognition, Yakovenko thinks 
that the study ofthe sphere of experiences in the second 
volume is in fact a retum to PSYCHOLOGISM. He doubts 
that phenomenology and the method of pure descrip-
tion can be free of presuppositions; furthermore, he 
raises the question ofthe way in which the unity ofthe 
intending act, the intentiona! sense, and the intended 
object is established. 
Yakovenko published "Ed. Husserl und die russis-
che Philosophie" ( 1929~30) on the 70th anniversary 
of Husserl's birth. This article outlines the reception 
of phenomenology in Lossky, Yakovenko, Spet, and 
Losev; discusses less obvious connections with Boris 
Vysheslavtsev and lvan Ilyin; and mentions, among 
others, Pavel Blonski, Vasily Zenkovski, SEM ION FRANK, 
Dmitzy Chizhewsky, and GEORG GURVITCH. At the end, 
he remarks that Husserl was motivated to philosophi-
cal research by an admirer and connoisseur of Russian 
philosophy, Tomas Masaryk (1850--1937), and notes 
that the first course in France on German phenomen-
o1ogica1 philosophy was by Georges Gurvitch in 1928. 
One other review of professiona1 caliber was "Psi-
chologia myshleniya ... " (Psychology of thinking in 
Franz Brentano, Goswin Uphues, Edmund Husserl, 
and Cari Stumpf, 1914), written by A. 1. KUNZMAN. This 
review measures teachings on consciousness using the 
peripatetic and Scholastic traditions as a yardstick. 
GUSTAV G. SPET -
according to their letters, one 
of Husserl's favorite and most highly regarded stu-
dents -
was the first in Russia thoroughly to inter-
pret Husserl 's Ideen zu einer reinen Phanomenologie 
und phanomenologischen Philosophie I ( 1913 ). Spet 
dedicated his Yavlenie i smysi. Fenomenologia kak 
osnovnaya nauka i yeyo problemy (Appearance and 
sense: Phenomenology as the fundamental science and 
its problems, 1914) to Husserl. 

RUSSIA 
Spet draws a methodological dividing line between 
negative philosophy, which restricts itself to studying 
the apprehending subject and the forms of cognition, 
and positive or affirmative philosophy, the subject mat-
ter ofwhich is being, that ofthe subject included. Spet 
holds that phenomenology is a "turn to a creative con-
struction ofthe foundation ofphilosophy"; it wants to 
investigate "everything," but everything "essentially" 
or "ideally," i.e., eidetically. The main point ofthe most 
fundamental science is, for Spet, that "the physical 
thing, the apprehended, in any possible consciousness 
in general cannot be given as really immanent ... Be-
tween being as a mental process and being as a physical 
thing there appears a basic and essential difference ... 
between the two types of beings, namely conscious-
ness and reality, as well as between the ways in which 
they are given to us, viz., in one case being as given 
directly in its essence and in the other through adum-
brations in appearance." The immanent perception is 
always the intuition of the essence, positing the "ab-
solute reality" of its object, i.e., of the mental process 
itself, while the pure ego is the center of the absolute 
being, transcendent in immanence. The pure ego can-
not be subjected to a phenomenological epoche; it is 
not correlati ve with the stream of mental processes ( ob-
jects are correlative). The ego is realized in the being 
of consciousness, imparting absoluteness to it. 
Later Spet changes his position on the ego as the 
ontologica! center. In "Soznanie i yego sobstvennik" 
(Consciousness and its proprietar, 1916), he criticizes 
the subjectivism whose progenitors he sees not in 
Descartes and Locke, but rather in Kant and Fichte. 
The principal error ofthis subjectivism Iies in the ille-
gitimate reversal ofthe thesis that "the ego is the unity 
of consciousness." By no means is every unity of con-
sciousness an ego for Spet; for example, the religious, 
moral, or national unities are not. The ego is not the 
foundation, but the object of consciousness, a social 
"thing," the thingpar excellence: "Even though ego as 
object maintains relations and connections with other 
objects, it may still be called absolute, seeing that there 
is no relationship from which it might be uniquely and 
necessarily determined .... Ego as a social object bear-
ing a proper name is absolute in the sense that it is not 
only a 'carrier' but also a 'source,' not only 'predestina-
tion' but 'freedom' as well." Spet returns to the notion 
of Vladimir Solovyov that we are not proprietors of 
617 
consciousness. The question "whose consciousness?" 
may be asked only within a social context and is an 
indication of a certain objectification. 
The differentiation between ego and unity of con-
sciousness is part of an attempt to represent the ego 
as something unique, as a "thus-and-so" and as simul-
taneously contained in the unity of the "sobornoye" 
(conciliar) consciousness, and is made by Spet within 
the framework ofthe hermeneutica! turn, the main fea-
tures ofwhich were already evident in his book on ap-
pearance and sense. He finds for the di fference between 
appearance and object a corresponding difference be-
tween acts of consciousness that posit the meaning 
of the appearance ( or a linguistic expression) and the 
hermeneutica! acts through which the sense is grasped 
as inherent in the objects themselves. The hermeneu-
tica! act proceeds from what he calls "urazumenie" 
( comprehension ), and this is an intuition that, in his 
view, underlies the empirica! and the ideal intuitions. 
Spet remarks that Husserl singles out only two kinds 
ofintuition and does not raise the question concerning 
the social being and the means for its comprehension. 
The social intuition, he claims, is penetration into the 
entelechy of an object, understanding its predestina-
tion. When entelechy is viewed broadly enough, any 
consciousness can, according to Spet, be regarded as 
hermeneutica!. This is manifested in the communica-
tion in which the conveying of sense is not the con-
sciousness of ... but it is nevertheless an intentiona! 
object that we not only grasp but also understand. We 
grasp MEANING that may be manifold. However, un-
derstanding reveals the sense of the object and this 
sense has, following Spet's logic, invariably one def-
inite social predestination. Every cognition is rooted, 
he contends, in sociality, which he treats very broadly, 
i.e., as the world oflife and history. 
Others in Russia wrote on phenomenology. Alexan-
der Ognev's paper, "Idealnoe i realnoe v soznanii" 
(The ideal and the real in consciousness, 1918), 
Iikens phenomenology to panlogism and subjects 
Husserl 's hypostatization of the ideal to criticism. 
Fiodor Kurlarski devotes a part of his critica! anal-
ysis of contemporary philosophy in Kritika tvorch-
eskogo soznaniya: Obosnovanie antinomizma (Cri-
tique of creative consciousness: Substantiation of anti-
nomism, 1923) to Husserl 's concepts of intuition and 
antipsychologism. 

618 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Spet's 
creative work, some ofhis students and followers pre-
pared a handwritten collection of materials entitled 
Quartet devoted to problems ofphenomenology. These 
may be sketched as follows. 
ALEXANDER AKHMANOV's "Intellektualnaya intuitsiya 
i esteticheskoye vospriyatie" (lntellectual intuition and 
aesthetic perception) characterizes ideal being in accor-
dance with Husserl and defines the distinctive features 
of aesthetic contemplation. ( 1) It is an intuition of ideal 
being and is itself a kind of intellectual contemplation. 
(2) It is a perception of an objectively given quality of 
the realization of an idea or the quality ofthe interna! 
structure ofthe thing. (3) It contains activity that trans-
forms the intuiting soul into an organ for the adequate 
contemplation of ideas. And (4) it is an intuition that 
restores the inner dynamics determining sense data of 
the thing by means of an idea. 
In "O suzhdenii" (On judgment), Nikolai Volkov 
treats the doctrine of judgment in Brentano and Anton 
Marty ( 1849-1914) and objects to the traditional view 
that the judgment is a relation between two concepts. 
Volkov maintains that "the judgment leads us to reality 
. . . . " Through its sense, it is directed at concreteness 
and the sense presupposes the act of comprehension 
("uazumenie," a term from Spet). 
Nikolai Zhinkin wrote "Veshch" (The thing) for the 
Quartet. In it he claims that the cardinal antithesis in 
metaphysical teachings is between thing and symbol. 
from this angle and following WILHELM DILTHEY, he 
examines various types of Weltanschauung as well as 
different connotations ofthe word "thing" in logic and 
ethics. He reviews the structural descriptions of the 
thing in Husserl and in HEDWIG CONRAD-MARTIUS, and 
arrives at the following conclusion: no description of 
the outer appearance of a thing, even though indispens-
able for gaining an approach to it, produces conscious-
ness ofits reality. The essence of a thing !ies, according 
to Zhinkin, in its use; each different quality ofthe use 
creates a new thing and draws, as it were, a demarca-
tion line between them. The act itself of using a thing 
(the deed) is always an event in the realm of culture. 
"It is not the thing that renders culture understandable, 
rather the culture makes the thing understandable." In 
other words, a body becomes a thing only within acul-
tural context. A body in a certain sphere of its use is 
defined by Zhinkin as the axiologica! inner form ofthe 
thing on the analogy of the "inner form of the word" 
in Spet. 
"O stroyenii obshchestva" (On the structure ofsoci-
ety) by Alexander Sack seeks to construct a social the-
ory making use ofHusserl's ideas on part and whole in 
the Logische Untersuchungen. The last contribution to 
the Quartet is A. Zires's "Vozmozhnost" (Possibility), 
which examines various interpretations of "possibil-
ity." 
Finally, Aleksei Losev ( 1893-1988) published 
Filosofia imeni (Philosophy of the name, 1927) and 
Muzyka kak predmet logiki (Music as subject matter of 
logic, 1927). In these, he works out his thought draw-
ing directly on the phenomenological method of pure 
description of eide as well as on the antimetaphysi-
cal and antinaturalistic tendencies of phenomenology. 
At the same time, Losev does not accept the alleged 
total rejection by phenomenologists of the principle 
of explanation, attempting to combine the phenomen-
ological method with the dialectica!. 
From the 1930s to the early 1960s, phenomenology 
was proclaimed in the UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST RE-
PUBLICS tobe a variety of reactionary bourgeois philos-
ophy .

JEAN-PAUL SARTRE 
Sartre was bom in 
Paris on June 21, 1905. He studied philosophy and 
passed his agregation examination at the Ecole Nor-
male Superieure in 1929. After eighteen months of 
military service as a meteorologist he taught ata lycee 
in Le Havre from 1930 to 1936. During this time he 
became greatly inftuenced by phenomenology, partic-
ularly by the writings of EDMUND HUSSERL and MAR-
TIN HEIDEGGER. Although precise details of when and 
how Sartre was exposed to their writings are still be-
ing chronicled, what is clear is his strong attraction, 
which led him to study Husserl 's writings in Berlin 
from November 1933 to July 1934 on a grant from the 
French Institute. It was during this period that he wrote 
La nausee ( 1938), arguably a phenomenological novel, 
and began La transcendance de 1 'ego ( 1936), his first 
sustained treatment of Husserl 's work. 
From then on phenomenology, as Sartre developed, 
modified, and extended it, played a prominent role 
in his work, even as he seemed to reject it !ater in 
his career. In his earliest work he cites, and clearly 
has studied, Husserl 's Logische Untersuchungen (2nd 
ed., 1913 ), ldeen zu einer reinen Phiinomenologie und 
phiinomenologischen Philosophie 1 ( 1913 ), Vorlesun-
gen zur Phiinomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins 
(1928), Formale und transzendentale Logik (1929), 
and Meditations cartesiennes ( 1931 ). In addition, he 
seems to ha ve read widely in other of Husserl 's writ-
ings and some ofhis commentators such as EUGEN FINK. 
Sartre 's version of phenomenology has its roots in Hei-
degger's writings as well; his working from Sein und 
Zeit ( 1927) and Was ist Metaphysik? ( 1929) is espe-
cially clear in his L 'etre et le neant ( 1943 ). 
Severa! of Sartre's earlier writings, including the 
previously mentioned works as well as L 'imagination 
(1936) and L 'imaginaire (1940), are direct responses 
to themes in the writings of Husserl and Heidegger. 
Chief among these are the · INTENTIONALITY of con-
sciousness; the distinction between consciousness and 
that of which there is consciousness; IMAGINATION vs. 
PERCEPTION; EMOTION; the status of the EGO; and the 
roJe of EIDETIC METHOD and FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY. 
As many of Sartre's commentators have tried to sort 
out, his versions ofhow Husserl and Heidegger devel-
oped these themes may be based on some misunder-
standings, yet his own descriptions can be appreciated 
in their own right. 
Fundamental to Sartre's method was his notion of 
reflection as focusing on conscious intentionallife. He 
characterized phenomenology as proceeding through 
intuition, by which he meant putting oneself, in reflec-
tion, in the presence of the object being described as 
it is presented, as a NOEMA. This was Sartre 's way of 
characterizing Husserl 's phenomenological reduction. 
He very early described the intentionality of conscious-
ness as putting us in direct contact with objects and he 
effusively praised Husserl, as early as 1939, for the 
move to seeing objects as not being immanent in con-
sciousness. The object ofreflection could be either the 
consciousness ofwhatever, or that ofwhich conscious-
ness was conscious ~ 
the latter being a particular fac-
tual object, a previous or expected consciousness of 
whatever, or an essence. This meant the resulting de-
scriptions could be either factual or eidetic. Although 
Sartre called this method a transcendental o ne, he used 
the term "transcendental" to apply to the present phase 
of consciousness whether it is reflecting or not. What is 
meant by "intuition," "reflection," and "transcenden-
tal" can be seen particularly well in his description of 
consciousness as nonegological. 
In La transcendance de !'ego, Sartre described the 
ego, or self, as a "relative" existent, like the objects 
ofthe world, that is, an object for consciousness; con-
sciousness itself is non-egological. According to him, 
every time I reflect on my conscious life an ego ap-
pears as the one who was doing the thinking. This 
ego appears, however, only in a reftective operation 
wherein consciousness looks upon itself as an object. 
In other words, the reflecting conscious process directs 
itself to the reflected-upon conscious process, which 
did not reflect upon itself previously but was, instead, 
a straightforward consciousness ofwhatever. It is only 
in this further act that an ego appears. The ego observed 
at the reflective level is given as transcendent and per-
manent apart from the individual conscious process 
through which it is presented; it does not appear as the

reflected-upon consciousness, but rather as apart from, 
or behind, the particular consciousness through which 
it appears. The ego is seen as having a real existence 
that is transcendent to the object being confronted, in 
this case, the activity of viewing. Consequently, the 
ego is like ali objects and can be given in intuition, 
i.e., the direct seeing of the object, "in person." Ini-
tially and most fundamentally consciousness is none-
gological. This fundamental level of consciousness is 
termed by Sartre transcendental consciousness. This 
is the for-itself (le pour-soi), the impersonal sponta-
neous consciousness. It is impersonal because there is 
no person, ego, or self at this level and it is sponta-
neous because there is no-thing determining or even 
motivating a necessary course of action or project. 
With this description of consciousness Sartre clearly 
followed Husserl 's method and descriptions to the 
point of accepting without question the correlation of 
consciousness and its intended object as intended, both 
ofwhich are given at one stroke. The object is relative 
to consciousness and yet is not a part or piece of it. 
From his earliest writings on, Sartre continued to praise 
Husserl 's method and results for restoring to things 
their reality while preserving the role consciousness 
plays. The application of this method was displayed 
extremely well in his work on the imagination in the 
books mentioned above. 
Sartre wanted to claim that the way an image, or 
feigned object, appears is analogous to PERCEPTION, 
rather than an image being a copy of a perceptual ob-
ject. Both an act of perception and an act of imagina-
tion aim at their objects, which are not parts of con-
sciousness. The difference between them is partly on 
the si de of the conscious act; imagination is a kind of 
quasi-observation in which the object is characterized 
as lacking certain positive existential characters. Yet 
ali intentiona! objects have transcendence. Basically 
this means, as it did in the case of the ego, that ali 
objects give rise to the "ontologica! proof." As Sartre 
develops it in L 'etre et le neant, this is the move from 
seeing that the phenomenon ofbeing- being as it dis-
closes itself in a particular phenomenon, which is the 
intentiona! object- requires in its essence that what 
exists for consciousness must exist not only insofar as 
it appears. 
Consciousness itself is not sufficient to account for 
what appears and the being ofthis appearance, because 
consciousness always and of necessity aims not only 
at, but beyond, its object, which is the totality ofits ap-
pearances. This totality of appearances cannot exist, be 
given to consciousness, aliat the same time. Instead it is 
essential to what it means tobe a series of appearances 
that they are ali absent except for the one to which 
attention is now directed. It is their absence coupled 
with their presence through the past appearings that 
gives them objectivity. The being of the appearances, 
Sartre argues, is defined as a lack, as that which is not 
consciousness. Their being is revealed as a being that 
is not consciousness and as already existing when con-
sciousness reveals it. This is part of Sartre's contention 
that consciousness is not something that confers being; 
rather, it is nothing apart from that of which it is con-
scious. Thus the essence ofwhat appears includes that 
its existence does not depend on the consciousness of 
it for its being. 
This transphenomenal being is not a noumenal be-
ing hidden behind the appearings, the phenomena. By 
"transphenomenal" Sartre means that the being of the 
phenomenon presents itself as not reducible to either 
the consciousness of it -
otherwise there would be 
no objectivity- nor to a transcendent object- then 
there would be no appearing distinct from this object. 
Each appearance is itself a transcendent being, and 
consciousness of it can be defined only in terms of 
this something that is transcendent and whose being is 
transphenomenal. Consciousness is consciousness of 
itself in a nonobjectivating awareness of itself as that 
which is supported and defined by this phenomenon 
whose being is transphenomenal. The picture is of con-
sciousness aware of itself as that which 1s supported in 
its being by a being that is not itself. 
Severa! important points emerge from these analy-
ses of the ego and intentiona! objects yielding further 
insight into the relation of Sartre's phenomenology to 
that of Husserl and Heidegger. Although Sartre tried to 
distance himself significantly from Husserl, especially 
with respect to the ego and the reality ofthe intentiona! 
objects, there is hardly any difference in the result-
ing descriptions, as the preceding analyses show. The 
correlation conception of consciousness, with the at-
tendant status of the ego and objects as constituted 
through the workings of consciousness, is very much 
the same in both Husserl and the early work of Sartre. 
The primary difference is Sartre's articulation of the 

622 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ro le of nothingness, or lack, at the fundamental level 
of consciousness, which results in a dualism of an im-
personal spontaneous consciousness and its object. 
However, both Sartre and Husserl did ontology in 
the same way. As experienced, reality is not tobe com-
pared with some unexperienced or "true" reality, nor 
is it to be questioned about its origin. Instead, to para-
phrase Sartre, experienced reality just is. In this way 
they challenged the assumption and did not enter into 
the controversy about whether they have made a cor-
rect description of some unavailable transcendent real-
ity, or whether such a description is possible. This shift 
of attitude, which is the phenomenological reduction, 
moves from the necessity of an answer to the ques-
tion "what is the nature of reality?" to a description 
of how the various worlds including the "real" one, 
as well as this question, arise in and from our experi-
ence. Most importantly, the description of being as it 
is meant in our experience is explicated and found to 
be the answer desired. This kind of concern eventuated 
in Sartre 's ontologica! "proof' that the essence of the 
being of the phenomenon includes its transphenom-
enality. Consequently, Sartre developed a phenomen-
ological ontology but without a prejudice about what 
the answer must look like or that it must answer the 
traditional questions. 
Sartre 's relation to Heidegger is much more difficult 
to track because it is an interactive one. Sartre said he 
learned about historicity and authenticity from Heideg-
ger as he turned from Husserl 's idealism toward Hei-
degger, around 193 7. Fundamental to this turn, which 
was not a complete one because Sartre throughout re-
tained his notion of consciousness as described above, 
was a perceived need to ground his analyses in the 
concrete, in human reality as situated in the historical 
world. In Esquisse d 'une theorie des emotions (Sketch 
of a theory ofthe emotions, 1939), Sartre praised Hei-
degger for giving us a view of human reality and the 
need to question ourselves-a view that is phenomen-
ological, yet with a shift in focus. As he wrote in Les 
carnets de la drâle de guerre: Novembre 1939-Mars 
1940 (War diaries, 1983), Sartre thought that Heideg-
ger had given him the tools to understand his history 
and situation. However, Heidegger's own assessment 
was quite different: he claimed Sartre had vulgarized 
his ideas in L "etre et le neant. 
At this stage in his development Sartre basically 
conflated the Husserlian consciousness with Heideg-
gerian DASEIN while emphasizing the voluntaristic na-
ture of consciousness set over against ali objects; the 
for-itself and the in-itself are heterogeneous. Pure re-
flection should reveal consciousness freely constituting 
its projects and the world such that being-in-the-world 
is only a characterization of the reflected-upon con-
sciousness ofthe world. 
In his !ater writings, Sartre seemed to think pheno-
menology was inadequate to cope with the experience 
of social conditioning and that concrete situated free-
dom was at odds with the empty spontaneous con-
sciousness of his previous work. lnterestingly, how-
ever, one can see him still using phenomenology even 
in "Question de methode" and Critique de la raison 
dialectique ( 1960), wherein he promoted the dialecti-
ca! progressive-regressive method, which moves back 
and forth from an awareness of the social and his-
torical conditioning -
the cultural context -
to the 
historical particularity of the individual. This dialec-
tic is still based on a phenomenological appreciation 
and description of human experience as the starting 
point of the analysis. The emphasis on the role of 
lived experience in his !ater writings can be seen as 
retaining the need for a phenomenological explication 
of experience but with an increasing commitment to 
contextualizing phenomenological descriptions by co-
ordinating the ro le of interior and exterior experience, 
as well as acknowledging the force of circumstances. 
In Cahiers pour une morale (Notebooks for an ethics, 
1983), which was finished around 1945, Sartre goes 
even further and explicitly says that Husserl and Hei-
degger are minor philosophers, and HEGEL and MARX 
are seen by him as having a major influence on his 
ideas. 
Severa! other phenomenologists played a role on 
Sartre's development. His earlier reading of MAX 
SCHELER helped convince him that as part of each of 
our personal fundamental projects there exists VALUEs 
that help to regulate our acts and judgments. These are, 
in effect, part of our lived experience and not derived 
from some universal value system. WILHELM DILTHEY's 
influence is particularly evident in Sartre's explication 
of lived experience as including an understanding of 
how individual projects are enabled in their interaction 
with the historical system. Sartre's long association and 
collaboration with SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR and MAURICE 

SCANDINAVIA 
623 
MERLEAU-PONTY resulted in an extensive crossfertiliza-
tion of each oftheir works. A full appreciation ofhow 
their individual works interpenetrated and inftuenced 
each other is stil! underway. 
Many of the themes in Sartre's philosophizing 
are further evident and developed in his numerous 
contributions to LITERATURE, THEATER, and POLITICS. 
Throughout these works, as his various concems 
emerged, matured, and were modified, there remained 
a consistent appraisal and reappraisal of how con-
sciousness/freedom interacts with the historical con-
ditions/conditioning. 
Sartre seems to further decenter the primacy ofthe 
individual consciousness in the very last period ofhis 
life and speaks of individuals as always already ob-
ligated toward the Other and as given within a so-
cial and historical set of conditions. However, what 
remains clear throughout his work is a strong com-
mitment to describing human experience as experi-
enced. Whether or not a full and adequate description 
oflived experience will reveal and uphold Sartre 's orig-
inal views about the primacy of individual spontaneous 
consciousness and the independent ro le of objects re-
mains an open question. What is clear, however, is his 
continuous attempts until his death on April 15, 1980 
to legitimate his insights about how human beings are 
both free and products of themselves and their situa-
tions.

Sweden, Denmark, and Nor-
way make up Scandinavia. Often, however, Finland 
and Iceland are added to make the five Nordic Coun-
tries. The five countries will be discussed in the order 
in which they got their first universities, which coin-
cides with the order in which phenomenology carne 
into these countries. In Sweden phenomenology was 
taken up in 1911, while in the other four countries sig-
nificant developments did not start until after World 
War II. The survey includes main contributions, pri-
marily by those who write in major languages. It does 
not include the many PSYCHOLOG!STS and HUMAN SC!EN-
TISTS who have been inftuenced by phenomenology.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
fore Copenhagen by two years, and Lund, founded in 
1668, twenty-eight years after Fin1and's first university. 
Stockholm was, for a short time, the residence of the 
most illustrious philosopher ever to work in the Nordic 
countries (rivalled only by S0ren Kierkegaard and by 
LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN, who spent Jong periods ofhis Jife 
in Norway). In 1649 Rene Descartes carne to Stock-
holm as Queen Christina's teacher. The following year 
he died from pneumonia. Not un tii three centuries !ater, 
in 1937, did Stockholm get its first regular professor of 
philosophy, at what was then Stockholm 's Hogskola. 
In 1960 Stockholm 's Hogskola was made into a univer-
sity. Sweden bas a large number ofphilosophers work-
ing within ali main areas of philosophy. Uppsala and 
Lund have the most positions. The other universities 
have fewer positions, but Stockholm and Gothenburg 
(Gotenborg) have very active departments and produce 
many doctoral candidates. The University ofUmeâ in 
the north has focused on the philosophy of science and 
the University of Linkoping has focused on medical 
ethics and action theory. 
The first philosopher in Scandinavia to write on 
phenomenology was Adolf Phalen (1884-1931) in 
1911. Phalen, who carne back to EDMUND HUSSERL sev-
era! times, became professor of theoretical philoso-
phy in Uppsala in 1916, and together with his col-
league, Axei Hagerstrom (1868-1939), founded the 
so-called Uppsala school of philosophy. Their suc-
cessors at Uppsala went in other directions. However, 
the Flemish-born Andries MacLeod ( 1891-1977), who 
studied with Phalen, wrote severa! penetrating stud-
ies of the contents of consciousness, reality, and 
negation that show affinities with the early Husserl. 
Also, Thorild Dahlquist includes Husserl and pheno-
menology in his broad philosophical repertoire. The 
main publications in the phenomenological tradition 
at Uppsala since Phalen have come from the De-
partment of Literature, where THURE STENSTROM has 
written severa! major works on EXISTENTIAL!SM, par-
ticularly JEAN-PAUL SARTRE. In theology, Eberhard Her-
rmann wrote his dissertation on Bolzano, Der religion-
sphilosophische Standpunkt Bernard Bolzanos unter 
Beriicksichtigung seiner Semantik, Wissenschaflstheo-
rie und Moralphilosophie (1977). 
It was, however, at Gothenburg more than at Up-
psala that the phenomenological tradition found a 
home. Inspired by Phalen, IVAR SEGELBERG wrote sev-
erai phenomenological studies from 1945 on. He be-
came professor of philosophy in Gothenburg in 1951 
and bas engendered a general awareness of pheno-
menology among his students. His successor, MATS 
FURBERG, bas written extensively on speech act the-
ory, and bas in recent work attempted a reconciliation 
between speech act theory and HERMENEUT!CS. Furberg 
bas also written engaging books on death and the mean-
ing oflife. 
One of Segerberg's students, DICK HAGLUND, now 
professor of the philosophy of religion in Lund, is 
the main contributor to phenomenology in Sweden 
today. Haglund received his doctorate in Gothenburg 
on Perception, Time, and the Unity of Mind ( 1977). 
More recently, he bas published Phenomenological 
Studies 1 (1979) and On the Nature of Hyletic Data 
(1984). Unfortunately, much ofHaglund's careful and 
interesting work is unpublished or published only in 
mimeographed form. 
Another of Segelberg's students, HELGE MALMGREN, 
wrote his unpublished dissertation on intentionality 
and knowledge ( 1971) and bas published on the early 
Wittgenstein and his affinity with phenomenology. 
Also at Gothenburg, Thomas Wetterstrom published 
an expanded version of his 1973 dissertation, Inten-
tion and Communication: An Essay in the Phenomen-
ology ofLanguage ( 1977). He combines impulses from 
Segelberg and Furberg and exploits Husserl 's distinc-
tion between the matter and quality of acts to throw 
light on Austin's distinction between locutionary and 
illocutionary acts. In Towards a Theory of Basic Ethics 
( 1986), he presents a normative ethical theory based 
onan intuitionistic VALUE THEORY, "mental quality he-
donism," explained in terms of Husserl 's "intentiona! 
moods." Wetterstrom has also written on AESTHETICS 
and on "Consciousness from a Quality-Instance Point 
ofView" (1974). 
One of Wetterstrom's students, ĂKE SANDER, has 
written a two-volume dissertation ( 1988) using Husser-
lian phenomenology to study the ro le played by RELI-
GION in the constitution of the LIFEWORLD. One of his 
points is that religious belief is a kind of practica! com-
petence rather than an intellectual attitude of holding 
something true. Sander is now engaged in a pheno-
menological study ofthe way Moslem immigrants en-
counter the Swedish society. 
JAN BENGTSSON has written on the reception and in-

SCANDINAVIA 
625 
fluence of phenomenology in Scandinavia, culminat-
ing in his dissertation on the phenomenological move-
ment in Sweden ( 1991 ). This book collects a wealth of 
material on references to Husserl, possible influences 
from Husserl, etc. in Swedish philosophy. It is, how-
ever, seriously marred by the author's crusade against 
philosophers who do not share his views. 
STAFFAN CARLSHAMRE has written a remarkably lu-
cid and well-argued dissertation, Language and Time: 
An Attempt to Arrest the Thought of Jacques Derrida 
( 1986) and is now working in Stockholm. 
At Lund there is not much phenomenology, except 
for that which is do ne by Dick Haglund. However, LARS 
FROSTROM discussed various theories ofjudgments and 
propositions, including those of Husserl and Meinong, 
in his 1983 dissertation. 
Recently, the center of phenomenological activity 
in Sweden has gravitated from Gothenburg to Stock-
holm, largely due to a major project on phenomen-
ology and related subjects supported by the Axei och 
Margaret Axelson Johnsons Foundation. The initia-
tive for this project was taken by DAG PRAWITZ, pro-
fessor of theoretical philosophy in Stockholm. Work-
ing with him are ALEXANDER ORLOWSKI, PER MARTIN-LOF, 
STAFFAN CARLSHAMRE, HANS RUIN, DANIEL BIRNBAUM, and 
SVEN-OLOV WALLENSTEIN and DICK HAGLUND from Lund 
and DAGFINN F0LLESDAL from Oslo. Their themes are 
connected with Husserl, FRANZ BRENTANO, MARTIN HEI-
DEGGER, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, ROMAN INGARDEN, MAURICE 
MERLEAU-PONTY, HANS-GEORG GADAMER, PAUL RICCEUR, 
and JACQUES DERRIDA, and also on the influence of 
phenomenology in LITERATURE and the arts. 
A key person in the development of phenomen-
ology in Stockholm has been ALEXANDER ORLOWSKI, 
who carne from Poland in 1971 after having taken his 
doctorate at Lodz with a dissertation on Schelling. Or-
lowski has worked extensively on Husserl, Kazimierz 
Twardowski (1866--1938), Sartre, and Heidegger, and 
on the reception of German philosophy in Central and 
Eastern Europe. 
PER MARTIN-LOF, research professor in logic at Stock-
holm, has taken a strong interest in Husserl's pheno-
menology, both in his study ofMFANING and in his work 
on MATHEMATICS. 
STAFFAN CARLSHAMRE is working on the reception of 
phenomenology in FRANCE and how it is merged with 
modern text theory and aesthetics. HANS RUIN wrote 
his dissertation entitled Heidegger and Historicity: 
Enigmatic Origins-Tracing the Theme of Historicity 
Through Heidegger 's Works (1994) and is now con-
tinuing his work in phenomenology and hermeneutics. 
He is also active as a translator, editor, and contrib-
utor to cultural journals. DANIEL BIRNBAUM is writing 
on Husserl 's late philosophy, while SVEN-OLOV WAL-
LENSTEIN is working on Heidegger's way ofwriting the 
history of philosophy. 
Also at Stockholm, HANS-JORGEN ULFSTEDT has writ-
ten a dissertation on Brentano 's views of existence and 
judgment, and JENS CAVALLIN obtained his doctorate in 
1990 with a dissertation entiled Content and Object, 
Twardowski and Psychologism. E. PEREZ-BFRCOFF has 
written Para una lectura hermeneutica de Sartre (For 
a hermeneutica! reading of Sartre). 
At Umeâ in the north of Sweden, INGVAR JOHANS-
soN, who studied with Segelberg, wrote his disserta-
tion on Karl Popper ( 1902-1994) and has !ater turned 
to phenomenology. His main work so far is Ontolog-
ica! Investigations: An Inquiry into the Categories of 
Nature, Man, and Society (1989), where he tries to find 
an adequate set of categories for those matters. 
In Denmark, Soren Kierkegaard anticipated aspects 
of phenomenology through his descriptions of human 
experience and through his conception of the now 
(oyeblikket). When Kierkegaard was fighting against 
the dominance of HEGEL 's thought at the University 
of Copenhagen, the university was already old. It was 
founded in 1479 and remained the only university in 
Denmark until the University of Aarhus (Arhus) was 
established in 1928. This was followed by the Univer-
sity of Odense (1966) and the "University Centers" in 
Roskilde ( 1970) and Aalborg (Alborg) ( 1971 ). 
One may distinguish two main phases in the de-
velopment of phenomenology in Denmark, one start-
ing with the Aarhus theologian Kund Ejler Logstrup 
( 1905-1981 ), and one beginning to develop among 
some young philosophers who are oriented toward 
Husserl and the problems with which he was grap-
pling. 
Inspired by Kierkegaard and the phenomenologi-
cal tradition, severa! Danish theologians have been 
working on phenomenology, mainly at the Institute 
for Ethics and the Philosophy of Religion at Aarhus. 
Logstrup has been a source of inspiration for most of 
them, particularly through Den etiske fordring (The 

626 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ethical claim, 1956), but also through his many other 
infiuential works. Logstrup 's phenomenological ap-
proach to the philosophy of religion is central for the 
dissertation ofhis successor, SVEND ANDERSEN, Sprog og 
skabelse (Language and creation, 1989). The book dis-
cusses religious language drawing both on phenomen-
ology and ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY. Andersen has pub-
Jished severa! other books and articles and is now ac-
tive in Denmark's council of medical ethics. Another 
main follower of Logstrup at Aarhus is the theologian 
H. c. WIND, who wrote his dissertation on historicity 
and ontology in Heidegger (1974), and has also writ-
ten a general presentation of Heidegger's philosophy 
and articles on phenomenology. 
The most infiuential of Logstrup 's students was 
JORGEN K. BUKDAHL, who during his short Jife wrote 
a number of articles on philosophical movements in 
Germany and France that inspired many ofthe younger 
philosophers in Denmark. 
Aarhus has also had an Institute of the History of 
Ideas for some years. It was founded by Johannes Slok, 
who has written a large number ofbooks, including an 
introduction to Kierkegaard ( 1990). His successors at 
the Institute have largely been infiuenced by MARX-
ISM. Hans Jorgen Schanz wrote his dissertation on the 
relations between metaphysics and modernity ( 1981 ), 
and is now working largely on Heidegger, Adorno, and 
Wittgenstein. 
Also at Aarhus, Soren Gosvig Olesen has writ-
ten the yet to be published Wissen und Phănomen. 
Eine Untersuchung der ontologischen Klărung der 
Wissenschaft bei Edmund Husserl, Alexander Koyre, 
und Gaston Bachelard (Cognition and phenomenon. 
An investigation ofthe ontologica! clarification of sci-
ence in Edmund Husserl, Alexandre Koyre, and Gaston 
Bachelard). 
At the young university at Roskilde, NIELS OLE 
BERNSEN is working on the borderline between pheno-
menology and COGNITIVE SCIENCE. In Know/edge: A 
Treatise of Our Cognitive Situation ( 1978), he argues 
that epistemological positions presuppose assumptions 
belonging to what is nowadays called "cognitive sci-
ence." His concept of a "cognitive situation" is an at-
tempt to capture this interdependence, including the 
unique epistemological sta tus ofvarious commonsense 
beliefs. He has pursued these ideas further in Heideg-
ger s Theory of Intentionality ( 1986) and has written 
over a hundred articles and books; he has been Re-
search Professor of Cognitive Science at Roskilde Uni-
versity since 1989, where he established the Centre of 
Cognitive Science in 1990. 
Work on the borderline between cognitive science 
and phenomenology is also done in Copenhagen by 
Ole Fogh Kirkeby, who teaches at Copenhagen Busi-
ness School. He took his doctorate at the Univer-
sity of Aarhus with Event and Body-Mind, where he 
presents a theory of consciousness that draws on MAU-
RICE MERLEAU-PONTY's discussions ofthe BODY, on Hei-
degger, and on Wittgenstein and philosophy of lan-
guage. Kirkeby has earlier written on Marx and artifi-
cial intelligence. 
Also in Copenhagen PETER KEMP has a very large 
production in French, much of it relating to the work of 
PAUL RICCEUR. He has also, together with David M. Ras-
mussen, edited The Narrative Path: The Later Works 
of Paul Rica!ur ( 1989), in which he has an article, 
"Toward a narrative ethics," that refiects his turn to-
ward ethics, particularly medical ethics. POUL LOBCKE 
has also written extensively, mainly on Kierkegaard, 
Husserl, and Heidegger, but also on TIME, on personal 
identity, and on medical ethics. He has coedited and 
contributed large parts of the two-volume survey Die 
Philosophie unserer Zeit. ARNE GRON has also written 
on French philosophy. 
The last few years have seen the emergence of a 
group of young Danish philosophers who are com-
bining careful Husserl scholarship with an awareness 
of the contemporary discussion of the central issues 
dealt with in phenomenology. DAN ZAHAVI has been re-
markably productive. After a Master's A. thesis on 
Intentionalităt und Konstitution ( 1992), he went to 
Leuven to write his dissertation with RUDOLF BER-
NET: Husserl und die transzendentale lntersubjek-
tivităt. Eine Antwort auf die sprachpragmatische Kritik 
(Husserl and transcendental intersubjectivity: An an-
swer to the criticism of linguistic pragmatism, 1996). 
Zahavi has also written articles in Husserl Studies, Man 
and World, Etudes Phenomenologiques, and other jour-
nals, and edited a volume on subjectivity and lifeworld. 
He now has a research fellowship in Copenhagen. 
SOREN HARNOW KLAUSEN in Qdense has a similar 
combined interest in phenomenology and philosophy 
of language. He studied for his doctorate in Ttibingen, 
writing a dissertation on Zur Sinnfrage in der Philoso-

SCANDINAVIA 
627 
phie des 20. Jahrhunderts (The question of meaning 
in 20th century philosophy, 1996), and is now working 
on Husserl, Heidegger, FREGE, and Wittgenstein. 
Finland's first university was founded in Turku 
(Abo) in 1640 and moved to Helsinki (Helsingfors) 
in 1828. Turku got a Swedish university in 1918 and 
two years !ater also a Finnish one. These two cities are 
the main centers for philosophy in Finland, the other 
four universities where philosophy is offered ha ve very 
small departments, but in Jyvăskyla and Tampere there 
are people working on phenomenology. 
Together with Georg Henrik von Wright and Erik 
Stenius, JAAKKO HINTIKKA at Helsinki has been a lead-
ing figure in Finnish philosophy during the past thirty 
years. Ali three have had wide interests, and those of 
Hintikka include phenomenology. He has written sev-
era! studies relating to phenomenology, in particular 
The Intentions of Intentionality ( 1975) and "Degrees 
and Dimensions oflntentionality" in The Logic ofEpis-
temology and the Epistemology of Logic ( 1989). He has 
also written on applications of phenomenology to art. 
Among his students, MARTIN KUSCH has been particu-
larly productive. He carne to Finland from Germany in 
1981, but has now moved to England. In his disserta-
tion, Language as Calculus vs. Language as Universal 
Medium: A Study in Husserl, Heidegger, and Gadamer 
(1989), he uses Merrill and Jaakko Hintikka's gen-
eralization of Jean van Heijenoort's 1967 distinction 
between "logic as calculus" and "logic as language" 
to throw light on Husserl, Heidegger, and HANS-GEORG 
GADAMER. 
A preeminent contributor to phenomenology in Fin-
laud is LEI LA HAAPARANTA. Her dissertation is Frege s 
Doctrine ofBeing ( 1985), but she has since published a 
1arge number of articles on Husserl, including her own 
contributions to her editions of Language, Knowledge, 
and Intentionality: Perspectives on the Philosophy of 
Jaakko Hintikka ( 1990); Mind, Meaning, and Mathe-
matics: Essays on the Philosophical Views of Husserl 
and Frege ( 1994 ), and Mind and Cognition: Philosoph-
ical Perspectives on Cognitive Science and Artificial 
Intelligence (1995). 
Lilli Alanen is a leading Descartes scholar, but has 
also written on intentionality and is directing a research 
group on intentionality and the foundations of cogni-
tive science. 
Maria Johanna Sara is writing a dissertation on the 
phenomenology of the body and has also written arti-
cles Oll Merleau-Ponty, SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, and re]ated 
topics. 
At Turku, SVEN KROHN showed an interest in pheno-
menology in the 1950s. LAUR! ROUTILA, who wrote 
his dissertation on Die aristotelische Idee der ersten 
Philosophie (The Aristotelian idea offirst philosophy, 
1969) and taught in Turku for a while, is now teach-
ing at Jyvăskylă in central Finland. Routila has written 
on Husserl, Heidegger and hermeneutics. His interests 
in meaning, interpretation, and Husserl come together 
in Wahrnehmung und lnterpretation (Perccption and 
interpretation, 1974). 
At Tampere, between Jyvăskylă and Turku, ERNA 
OESCH has written Squaring the Hermeneutic Circle-
A Treatise in the Borderland of Two Traditions ( 1985) 
and has also written articles on related subjects. Also 
at Tampere, JAANA PARVIAINEN has written her Mas-
ter's thesis on phenomenology ofthe body and modern 
DANCE and written related articles. 
An early admirer of Husserl in Finland was YRJ6 
REENPĂĂ, professor of physiology in Helsinki, who 
wrote a number of studies of perception using Husser-
lian ideas, in particular Wahrnehmen, Beobachten, 
Konstituieren (Perception, observation, constitution, 
1967). 
The first positions in philosophy in Norway carne 
with the establishment of the University of Oslo in 
1811. Until then, Norwegian academics had received 
their education abroad, mainly in Copenhagen. Ali stu-
dents at Norwegian universities have to study philos-
ophy for one half semester when they enter the uni-
versity. Due to this, Norwegian universities have large 
philosophy departments, the department in Oslo hav-
ing presently forty-five full time faculty members in a 
variety of fields. 
In Norway, the study of phenomenology started at 
Oslo in the 1950s and then spread to the other univer-
sities. Arne Na:ss showed some interest in phenomen-
ology at that time and in 1965 wrote the Norwegian 
version of what !ater became Faur Modern Philoso-
phers: Carnap, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Sartre ( 1968) 
and is well known for his DEEP ECOLOGY. In 1956, 
DAGFINN F0LLESDAL Wrote the first major study in 
phenomenology in Norway, his Master's thesis entitled 
Husserl und Frege (1958), and has !ater written more 
on Husserl, and also on Heidegger and Sartre. HANS

SKJERVHEIM, who was professor at Roskilde in 1968-69 
and professor at Bergen until he retired, received his 
M.A. in Oslo in 1957 with Objectivism and the Study 
of Man ( 1959). Basing himself largely on Husserl 's 
phenomenology, in it he criticized various tendencies 
to "objectivize" mental and social phenomena and not 
recognize their intentionality. 
ELLING SCHWABE-HANSEN received his doctorate in 
1987 with Das Verhăltnis zwischen transzendentaler 
und konkreter Subjektivităt in der Phănomenologie Ed-
mund Husserls (The relation between transcendental 
and concrete subjectivity in Edmund Husserl 's pheno-
menology, 1991 ), in which he presents and critically 
discusses Husserl 's theory of the two egos: the em-
pirica! and the transcendental. Schwabe-Hansen has 
also written severa! articles on intentiona! systems, the 
body, and the lifeworld. EINAR 0VERENGET has just re-
ceived his doctorate from Boston College with a dis-
sertation entitled Heidegger: A Phenomenological Jn-
terpretation of Subjectivity, and has published severa! 
articles on related topics. Among the other members of 
the faculty at Oslo who ha ve written within phenomen-
ology are ARNE TUV, who wrote his Master's thesis on 
Concepts of Erlebnis, Bewusstsein and Jch in Husserl s 
Logische Untersuchungen and Ideen (Concepts of ex-
perience, consciousness, and I in Husserl's Logische 
Untersuchungen and Ideen ). 
A!so in Oslo GUTTORM FL0ISTAD, since 1975 profes-
sor of the history of ideas, has written on Heidegger, 
on Verstehen, and on many other topics. DAG 0STER-
BERG has written a book on forms of understanding 
(1960), a major study of Sartre (1993), and a number 
of other works. BERNT VESTRE has worked on contem-
porary French philosophy, as has ASBJ0RN AARNES, pro-
fessor ofFrench literature, who has lately concentrated 
on EMMANUEL LEVINAS. 
Bergen got its university in 1948; before then some 
research and higher education had taken place at the 
Bergen Museum, which dates from 1825, and at the 
Christian Michelsen Institute, established in 1930. At 
Bergen, the main figures in phenomenology besides 
HANS SKJERYHEIM have been KNUT VENNESLAN, who has 
written Der Wissenschaftsbegriff bei Edmund Husserl 
(The concept of science in Edmund Husserl, 1962), 
and GUNNAR SKIRBEKK who wrote his dissertation on 
Heidegger's theory oftruth (1969), but has !ater tumed 
more toward POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY and phiJosophy of 
NATURAL SCIENCE, and in 1993 published a volume on 
the relationship between rationality and modemity. 
KONRAD ROKSTAD wrote his Master's thesis on the !ater 
Husserl. 
Trondheim has a long and venerable academic tra-
dition, much of it connected with the oldest high school 
in Norway, the Cathedral School, which recently cel-
ebrated its 800th anniversary, and the oldest scien-
tific society in Norway, the Royal Norwegian Soci-
ety of Sciences and Letters, founded in 1760 by Johan 
Ernst Gunnerus, who was a professor ofphilosophy in 
Copenhagen before becoming bishop in Trondheim. In 
1837 the Society gave Schopenhauer one ofhis first of-
ficial recognitions, for a prize essay Ober die Freiheit 
des menschlichen Willens. 
The Society's Museum was one of the three insti-
tutions that in 1968 joined to form the University of 
Trondheim, the other two being Trondheim Institute 
of Technology, founded 191 O, and the College of Arts 
and Science, founded 1922. In 1962 the University 
got its first faculty member in philosophy, Ingemund 
Gullvăg. Gullvâg and most of the other philosophers 
who now make up the department combine a concern 
with Continental trends in philosophy with an inter-
est in analytic tendencies. Gullvâg has written some 
unpublished work on phenomenology. Severa! contri-
butions by the other members of the department that 
relate most closely to phenomenology should be men-
tioned. 
MAGNE DYBVIG has mainly been working within epis-
temology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of sci-
ence. The Husserlian notion of "lifeworld" recurs in 
severa! ofthem, for example in a study of geometry and 
the lifeworld. AUDUN 0FSTI started out in mathematics, 
but most of his philosophical work has been devoted 
to various aspects of a transcendental approach to phi-
losophy, particularly to issues connected with "objec-
tivism" and with the use oflanguage. He comes closest 
to phenomenology in a recent note on INTENTIONALITY 
(1994). HELGE H01BRAATEN is the latest arrival in Trond-
heim. His interests, like those of0fsti, are mainly prag-
matics conjoined with transcendental philosophy, with 
applications in the social sciences and the humanities. 
Hoibraaten is also working in politica! philosophy and 
is currently engaged in a project on modernity. KARl OP-
DAHL wrote a Master's thesis entitled Phenomenology 
-A Semantic-Ontologica! Synthesis.

Tromso has the world's northernmost university, 
founded in 1968. JON HELLESNES, in studies of self-
knowledge and other minds and of socialization 
and technocracy, brings in phenomenologica1 anti-
objectivist elements, partly in criticism of Wittgen-
stein. In addition to severa] books on these themes 
in Norwegian, he has written an article that relates 
to phenomenology entitled "Die Transzendentalprob-
lematik und die Frage nach dem Sinn des Lebens" 
(The transcendental problematic and the question of 
the meaning oflife, 1993 ). Hellesnes has also published 
novels and collections of widely read essays. Pheno-
menology also has inspired ATLE MĂSEIDE, who in "How 
to do things with words- Notizen zum Verhăltnis 
zwischen Phănomenologie und Pragmatik" ( 1986) and 
other articles has argued for the importance of tacit 
knowledge in various areas. ELIN SVENNEBY has written 
a Master 's thesis in which she makes use of Heideg-
ger's Sein und Zeit ( 1927) to throw light on the notion 
oftoo] in ETHNOLOGY. 
Iceland, with a population of merely 250,000, has 
two universities, Hask6li Islands at Reykjavik, founded 
in 1911, and a small university, established in 1987, in 
Akureyri in the north. At both universities the com-
pulsory "philosophicum" is taught, but only Reykjavik 
has permanent positions for philosophers. Two ofthem, 
in particular, have been working on phenomenology. 
ARNOR HANNIBALSSON wrote his dissertation on ROMAN 
INGARDEN's ontology (1973) and has also been working 
on Husserl and on Meinong and Brentano. His main in-
terests are epistemology and aesthetics. PĂLL SKULASON 
wrote his (unpublished) dissertation on Heidegger and 
Ricoeur and has mainly been working on Hegel and 
Heidegger. He also has done some work on Husserl, 
but his philosophical orientation is closer to Heidegger 
than it is to Husserl. Skulason is an active and produc-
tive philosopher, but is primarily writing in Icelandic. 
DAGFINN F0LLESDAL 
University of Oslo 
MAX SCHELER 
Scheler was born in Munich, 
Germany, on August 22, 1874. His mother was of Jew-
ish extraction, his father was Lutheran. He joined the 
Catholic religion early in his life but !ater he became 
noncommittal in favor ofmetaphysical attempts to ex-
plain the divine as becoming together with humankind 
and world in absolute time. He received his doctorate at 
Jena University in 1887 and finished his Habilitations-
schrift there in 1899. After teaching at Jena until 1906, 
he joined the University of Munich. In 191 O he lost 
his position there because of a divorce, alienating the 
predominantly Catholic administration. It was only in 
1919 that he received a professorship in philosophy 
and sociology from the University ofKoln. He was en-
gaged in the politica\ situation in Europe and by 1927 
had repeatedly warned the public of the rising Nazi 
movement in Germany and Fascism in Italy. His work 
was suppressed in Germany during the Nazi regime 
from 1933 to 1945. 
From 1909 on, Scheler was an avid reader of 
WILLIAM JAMES and Charles Sanders Peirce and is the 
on1y European phenomenologist who entertained a 
lifelong interest in American pragmatism. In English, 
Scheler's name is mentioned first in a favorable review 
ofhis book Zur Phiinomenologie und Theorie der Sym-
pathiegefuhle und van Liebe und Hass, in Mind (To-
wards the phenomenology and theory of the feeling 
of sympathy and of love and hate, 1914). Among his 
early American admirers were Howard Becker ( 1889-
1960), Paul Arthur Schilpp (1897-1993), and the so-
ciologist Alb ion Small ( 1854-1926). Toward the end 
ofhis life he received invitations to lecture extensively 
in Japan, Russia, and the United States, but followed 
hesitatingly his physician 's advice not to embark on the 
trip. A rapidly deteriorating heart condition caused his 
death in Frankfurt am Main on May 19, 1928, shortly 
after he hadjoined the university there. He is buried in 
Koln. 
Scheler made a number of references in his works 
to the fledgling phenomenologica\ movement early this 
century and to the part he played in it. His first discus-
sion with EDMUND HUSSERL occurred in 190\. It centered 
on the concepts of intuition and PERCEPTION. Scheler, 
who was fifteen years younger than Husserl, outlined 
his novel concept of intuition. He explained its scope 
as much wider than either sensible components or log-
ica! forms. Husserl remarked that he too had come up 
with an analogous extension of the concept, probably 
referring to the categoria! intuition ofhis Logische Un-
tersuchungen ( 1900--1901 ). Between 191 O and 1916, 
Husserl recommended Scheler highly for various ca-

reer opportunities, but the relationship had cooled by 
the end of World War 1. As a freelance writer from 
191 O to 1919, Scheler had an almost incredible record 
ofpublications spreading his name fast throughout Eu-
rope, prompted also by addressing politica! issues of 
the time, such as war, the feminist movement, resent-
ment, the causes of hatred of Germans, the future of 
capitalism, the psychology of social security expecta-
tions, and global overpopulation, among many others. 
Like other phenomenologists in Germany at 
the 
time, 
Scheler was 
not 
only 
critica! of 
Husserl 's Ideen zu ei ner reinen Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie 1 (1913 ), charging 
him with ego logica! Cartesianism and methodological 
shortcomings, but also of his Logische Untersuchun-
gen. The critique of the latter was formulated by 1904 
and is contained in his posthumous Logik I. It provides 
incontrovertible evidence ofhis early independence in 
matters phenomenological and from what he called the 
"loose circle" ofphenomenologists he knew in person, 
such as MORITZ GEIGER, DIETR!CH VON H!LDEBRAND, JO-
HANNES DAUBERT, THEODOR L!PPS, ALEXANDER PFĂNDER, 
and ADOLF REINACH. He charged Husserl with "platoniz-
ing" phenomenology in the Logische Untersuchungen 
with the notion oftruth in itself as separate from objects 
and thinking, and as existing prior to judgment-making. 
This was, of course, incompatible with Scheler's con-
tention- anticipating as early as 1904 his subsequent 
interest in American pragmatism- that thinking must 
be conceived as functional (Denkfunktion) with states 
of affairs and things. 
His independence from the early phenomenological 
movement carne fully to light, however, in lectures held 
in 1908-9 on the foundations of biology. They con-
tained the central themes of his emerging phenomen-
ology of time. These lectures and the treatises Lehre 
van den drei Tatsachen (The theory of the three facts) 
and Phănomenologie und Erkenntnistheorie (Pheno-
menology and the theory of cognition, 1911-14), are 
his only works dealing exclusively with phenomen-
ology. The remainder ofhis phenomenological contri-
butions are unfortunately dispersed in his works, in-
cluding his first magnum opus: Der Formalismus in 
der Ethik und die materiale Wertethik. Neuer Versuch 
der Grundlegung ei nes ethischen Personalismus (For-
malism in ethics and nonformal ethics ofvalues: New 
attempt at the foundation of an ethical personalism). 
Its two parts were completed by 1913 and published 
in 1913 and 1916 respectively in Husserl 's famous 
Jahrbuch. There is clear evidence of Scheler's inftu-
ence on ARON GURW!TSCH's Phănomenologie der The-
matik und des reinen lch (Phenomenology of the the-
matic and of the pure I, 1929) and Die mitmenschliche 
Begegnung in der sozialen Welt [Human encounters 
in the social wor]d, 1931); MAUR!CE MERLEAU-PONTY'S 
"Christianisme et ressentiment" ( 1 936), and JEAN-PAUL 
SARTRE's Les carnets de la drâle de guerre: Novembre 
1939-Mars /940 (War diaries, 1983), ALFRED SCHUTz's 
Der sinnhafte Aufbau der sozialen Welt. Eine Ein-
leitung in die verstehende Soziologie (The meaning-
structure ofthe social world, 1932) and Collected Pa-
pers ( 1962, 1964, 1966), and other figures. 
Scheler's phenomenology has remained in the back-
ground of the post-World War II phenomenological 
movement for severa! reasons. The German collected 
edition began only in 1954 while the growing pheno-
menological movement centered on Sartre, Merleau-
Ponty, Husserl, and also MARTIN HEIDEGGER, largely be-
cause ofthe international availability oftheir writings 
and promoters ]ike HERMAN LEO VAN BREDA, HANS-GEORG 
GADAMER, ARON GURW!TSCH, HERBERT SP!EGELBERG, LUD-
WIG LANDGREBE, ERW!N W. STRAUS, and others who had 
known some of the first generation of phenomenolo-
gists in person. 
The phenomenology of Scheler is distinct from 
those of other phenomenologists in severa! respects: 
phenomenology is not tobe based in a method; pheno-
menology must suspend sensory data in intuition; time 
originates in the center ofthe self-activity oflife; con-
sciousness presupposes the being of the person; emo-
tive intentionality is pregiven to ali other acts; the ego 
is an object of interna! perception; and reality is resis-
tance. 
Method. It must first be pointed out that the noetic-
noematic bipolarity of act-consciousness and the con-
sciousness of noematic meaning-contents conjoined 
with the former allows two approaches to lay bare 
the structure of consciousness: it is possible to investi-
gate its noetic INTENTIONALITY or to make the meaning-
contents of the NOEMA conjoined with it subject to 
investigation. The noetic approach is referred to by 
Scheler as act phenomenology, the noematic one as 
phenomenologyoffacts. The former shows "how" phe-
nomena are given, the latter "that" they are given. How-

MAX SCHELER

ever, while using either approach it is not possible to 
exclude its correlative opposite entirely. 
At the basis ofScheler's project !ies the phenomen-
ological tenet "that" Being, as ultimate background 
of all meaning-contents, is pregiven to the cognition 
(Erkenntnis) ofthem. There is no cognition, including 
phenomenological cognition, without the pregivenness 
of the meaning of Being, including the meaning of its 
ultimate incomprehensibility. The pregivenness to cog-
nition must not be understood as sequential but as in 
the order offoundation. From this it follows that a phe-
nomenon is a fact of consciousness or consciousness 
is "of'' facts. A fact is given as the content of an iru-
mediate intuition. Such phenomena are, for instance, 
spatiality, temporality, materiality, relationality, thing-
ness, aliveness, the divine, or the absolute. 
Methods, observations, and definitions, says 
Scheler, presuppose that which is to be found or clari-
fied by them. This is why "that" something is spatial, 
temporal, material, or alive is neither observable nor 
definable as "something" to be uncovered by a method. 
Phenomena are therefore "pure" facts. The fact of spa-
tiality would allow an observation ora method only to 
the extent that a particular extended configuration of 
a thing- say, something triangular- is in question. 
But the "fact" of the spatiality of something triangu-
lar or the "fact" of the aliveness of something alive 
are already intuited, a priori meaning-contents devoid 
of sense experience. They are, as Scheler also put it, 
"there" (da). This does not exclude the thereness of 
illusions occurring in the field of intuition, on which 
Scheler focused agreat deal. An illusion occurs, for ex-
ample, when something is apprehended as displaying 
the phenomenon of aliveness when in reality it is not 
ali ve. Such illusions are distinct from logica! errors. 
Descriptions of intuited facts are always found early 
in his numerous treatises, such as those of shame, the 
tragic, repentance, and resentment. Concern ing the fact 
of the divine in consciousness, he developed an entire 
Wesensphiinomenologie der Religion. Ali pure facts 
not only have in common that they can neither be 
observed nor subjected to methods, but also -
con-
trary to facts of the LIFEWORLD and facts in science 
-
they are indifferent to truth and falsity. This is be-
cause intuited facts are pre-logical. They are only in-
tuitable or "seen" in a phenomenological attitude or 
"Bewusstseinseinstellung." Scheler was aware that in 
this respect his phenomenology was akin to psychic 
techniques in BUDDHISM. Granted that phenomena are 
pure facts in the inception of intuition rather than the 
result of a method, the question of whether or not the 
senses play any part in intuition must be addressed. 
Sensibility. Scheler's independence of the early 
phenomenological movement is further substantiated 
by the role that he assigns to sense data. Since intu-
ition is much richer than sense experience, it cannot 
be maintained that the latter is primordial, let alone 
that it is the only experience a person can have. The 
structure of the lifeworld conceptualized first, albeit 
not in a phenomenological sense, in 1885 by Scheler's 
teacher RudolfEucken (1846-1926), who called it the 
"workaday world" (die Arbeitswelt), and renamed in 
1908 by Scheler as the natural world view (niiturliche 
Weltanschauung), is given prior to the functions ofthe 
senses. Only those sensory data come into play that the 
structure ofthe lifeworld "allows." This also pertains to 
the "milieux" of animals. The ro le of sense data is said 
to be a vehicle of an organism 's reactions to preserve 
its life. Showing this to be the case, sense experience 
is no conditionat all for facts of intuition. On the con-
trary, assigning sense experience a foundational role 
for intuition resists a scrupulously phenomenological 
approach. 
Time. The phenomena of spatiality and temporality 
must not be confined to human beings alone. Rather, 
they are generated in two powers of any living be-
ing: self-movement and selfalteration. Spatiality and 
temporality take their root neither from the lived body 
nor from consciousness and intuition. They stern, like 
reality itself, from a four-dimensional manifold of vi-
tal energy, called "Drang," meaning "impulsion," in 
which they are not yet separated. The state of impul-
sion is pure, ftuctuating variation (Wechsel). There is 
no substance as a bearer of it and it may be compared to 
wave patterns of atomic physical energy whose reality, 
according to Scheler, also rests on impulsion. Four-
dimensional impulsion suffuses ali entities. It reaches 
also into the visual field of humans where parallels, 
as in four-dimensional geometry, do not exist. In the 
visual field itself, for instance, parallel railroad tracks 
"meet" at the horizon. 
lmpulsion is both individual and universal. In every 
one of its phases of ftuctuating variations, it is simul-
taneously "becoming and un-becoming" (Werden und 

632 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Entwerden), a character translucent in the continuous 
simultaneous decline and growth ofliving beings. The 
following two laws obtain: al! movement issues from 
impulsion and is, in principle, reversible, even if only 
in thought; ali alteration issuesfi·om impulsion and is, 
in principle, irreversible. This allows any fluctuating 
variation in practice to be interpretable as either re-
versible movement or as irreversible alteration. Seen 
as reversible, it turns into spatiality and, in the end, 
objective SPACE. Seen as irreversible alteration it turns 
into temporality and, in the end, objective TIME. For 
instance, one can interpret the fluctuating variation of 
lights and shadows under a tree exposed to sun and 
varia bie winds as either reversible movement of specks 
of shadows and light, oras irreversible alterations of a 
particular surface. 
Granted that impulsion propels life into a continu-
ous becoming-unbecomingprocess in any ofits phases 
and that space and time are not separated in it, the 
phenomenological constitution of time-consciousness 
must take its root in impulsion. This may be condensed 
in the following way. Impulsion breaks up into three 
main drives: propagation, growth (power), and nutri-
tion. Its fluctuating variation divides the drives into 
reversible movement (spatiality) and irreversible al-
teration (temporality): what in drive-life is more "ur-
gent" becomes "near" and "first"; what is less urgent 
becomes "distant" and "!ater." The main drives are 
conjoined with three germ layers of vertebrate organ-
isms (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) in the gasto-
cele stages of an embryo. By dint of complex rami-
fications with other drives, this plays a basic role in 
the temporalization of passions, needs, and interests, 
as well as perception, which is, accordingly, always 
drive-conditioned. 
The first phenomenological experience of spatial-
ization as detached from temporalization is a vague 
about-awareness (das Herumbewusstsein), while the 
first phenomenological experience of temporaliza-
tion as detached from spatialization consists in pre-
conscious runoffs of phases "filled" with phantasmic 
images in impulsion and drives. Scheler stresses that 
living beings do not li ve "in" objective space and time. 
First and foremost, they spatialize and temporalize 
themselves out of the vital energy of impulsion. 
The passage of impulsion into alteration reaches 
consciousness in the form of"absolute," not objective, 
time. Absolute time is characterized by three qualities: 
( 1) simultaneous congruence of meanings and their 
phases, (2) continuous becoming-unbecoming, and (3) 
the runoff of absolute time "in" transitions between 
any A turning into a B; the latter implies the transition 
between one meaning and another in consciousness, or 
between potency and actualization. The absolute time 
oftransitions also applies to protentions turning into re-
tentions. Timeconsciousness may be described, there-
fore, as absolute self-temporalization of transitions in 
the flux ofbecoming and unbecoming meanings locked 
in their phases, ali propelled by impulsion. 
Absolute time is also latent in the continuous tran-
sitions from aging toward death. This holds, a fortiori, 
forthe shifting in consciousness ofthe horizons ofpast, 
present, and future. In its early stages, consciousness 
has before it an endless future horizon. A small hori-
zon of the past begins to grow and grow until both 
horizons are in relative balance in midlife phases and 
increasingly squeeze the present between them. From 
this stage on, the future horizon retracts by closing in 
on the present, while the horizon ofthe past gets wider 
and wider, pressing against both the present and future 
until their resistance collapses. The shifting dynamics 
of the three transient time horizons is a fact of time-
consciousness. Aging runs off in absolute time. Dying 
is absolute ending "in" absolute time and not in ob-
jective time. Aging and dying are not to be seen in 
an empirica! experience of objective time. In contrast 
to absolute time, in objective time, MEANINGS and their 
phases are separable. Everyday meaning-contents such 
as plans are as open to schedule changes as physical 
events can be assigned new time frames in the sciences. 
Objective time, says Scheler, may be an enormous il-
lusion in the human species. StiU, measurable time is 
indispensable for human progress. 
Person. Scheler tells us in the 1913 Jahrbuch that 
the being of the person is the foundation of ali inten-
tiona! acts. This implies that the sphere of the person 
is subject neither to absolute time-consciousness nor 
to objective time. Rather, person is "supratemporal." 
As such, "person" is the form of consciousness. Each 
act of consciousness is different in essence from any 
other act. He declares that especially feelings as well 
as volitions and religious acts must not fali victim to 
the traditional privileging of rational acts and reason 
in the wake ofthe Cartesian cogito. For this and other

reasons he branded the concepts of a consciousness 
in general and a transcendental ego as "evident non-
sense." Both concepts overlook the being and the self-
value ofthe person permeating ali acts. More precisely, 
what is called person exists solely in the "execution" 
ofany and ali possible acts. The person is no substance 
of acts. The execution of acts, however, is different in 
each person by virtue ofthe "qualitative direction" acts 
take in each different person. The individual person ex-
ecutes his or her own existence, a point foreshadowing 
JEAN-PAUL SARTRE'S idea of existence. 
Emotive intentionality. Ali perception, willing, and 
thinking are based on the experience ofvalues, a tenet 
ofScheler's value-ethics. That every act is suffused by 
the person and that the person varies in each different 
act by virtue of said qualitative direction encompasses, 
a fortiori, emotive intentionality, that is, acts of EMO-
TION or feeling and their correlates: values. VALUE is 
the pre-rational, intentiona! referent or the noema of 
emotive intentionality. It hinges on the act of loving. 
Like colors, values are independent of their substrates. 
The value of beauty may pertain to a landscape or a 
musical work of art, just as the sky or a cloth can be 
blue. Ali values are ordered in a spectrum of fi ve as-
cending ranks: the values ofwhat is bodily agreeable or 
not; pragmatic values of what is useful or not; the life 
values ranging from noble (edel) to faulty (schlecht); 
the rank of the mental values of beauty, justice, and 
cognition oftruth; and the rank ofthe holy and unholy. 
Emotive intentionality consists in the act of prefer-
ring higher (or lower) values to given ones. Preferring 
them is nota rational act of choosing them; rather, it is a 
spontaneous leaning toward something. This "leaning 
toward" has no rational reasons. lts seat is the heart, the 
"ordo amoris" whose "reasons" ha ve a logic of their 
own. In this, Scheler followed "le coeur a ses raisons" 
of Pascal. Good and evi! do not belong to the above 
five value-ranks. They are not intentiona! referents of 
emotive intentionality. They emerge during the realiza-
tions of preferring higher (lower) values and "ride on 
the back" ofthese acts. They are purely temporal and, 
phenomenologically, an emotive instance of passive 
synthesis. As such, they are not objects. 
Ego. Since a phenomenology of consciousness-of 
presupposes for Scheler the being ofthe person, it fol-
lows that ali consciousness, be it human, divine, or 
fictional, must be in person. The EGO is no founda-
tion in the make-up of the human being, nor is it a 
point of departure of acts. This Schelerian assessment 
ofthe ego, also made in the 1913 Jahrbuch, appears to 
be the very opposite of the foundational ro le the ego 
has for Husserl in the same Jahrbuch. Scheler locates 
the ego in terms of fi ve descending steps. ( 1) The ego 
is shown in the book on sympathy to emerge around 
the age of two and against "pregiven" alter egos. (2) 
Pure intuition in the sphere ofthe person alone encom-
passes interna! and externa! intuition. Pure intuition is 
not linked to the presence of a lived body. (3) In real-
ity, however, the ego belongs to a lived BODY, which 
spawns three separate act-qualities: sense perception, 
remembering, and expecting, ali encompassed by pure 
intuition. ( 4) The three act-qualities ha ve as intentiona! 
referents "being-present" (hic et nunc), "being-past," 
and "being-future." Like protentions, retentions, and 
the fleeting present between them, these referents do 
not occur in objective time. The being-present as in-
tertwined with retentions and protentions yields the 
division between externa! and interna! perception. (5) 
The ego is constituted in interna! perception as its "ob-
ject." But this object appears neither as extended nor 
as sequential because past and present experiences as 
well as future expectations are "intercontained." The 
ego 's intercontainment (das lneinandersein) is the ulti-
mate object of the acts of interna! perception, whereas 
those of externa! perception is "pure expanse" (das 
A useinandersein ). 
The traditional Cartesian dualism between non-
extension and extension does not hold. While the ego 
can be pure, as in states of personal ingatheredness or 
self-communion, and while in such cases the lived body 
becomes less important, it can also "spread" through-
out the lived body and undergo the transition from pure 
ego to a lived body-ego. This occurs in many human 
conditions such as in extreme physical exhaustion, in-
toxication, and gluttony. It may be, says Scheler, that 
in a dreamless sleep the ego disappears altogether un tii 
it begins to resuffuse the lived body during waking up. 
Reality. While the concept of reality weighs heav-
ily on Sche]er's ]ater PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY, it 
must be mentioned that it is, in part, a result of a cri-
tique of Husserl's phenomenological reduction. This 
reduction must not center in a method, but in a "tech-
nique" of nullifying (aufheben) the factor of reality 
in the lifeworld so that pure phenomena can appear 

634 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
in consciousness. As Scheler sees it, Husserl's under-
standing ofthe reduction is not radical enough. Instead, 
he proposes to eliminate the very root that posits real-
ity. This root is the capacity to posit reality: impulsion. 
While consciousness can only posit whatness, it or the 
mind is "impotent" (ohnmachtig) to posit reality. A 
temporary nullification of impulsion can be achieved 
only by the technique of the "phenomenological atti-
tude" mentioned above. It alone promises a momentary 
access to "pure intuition" offacts severed from the re-
ality oflifeworld and the world of science. Scheler also 
envisioned a reversal ofsaid technique by momentarily 
suspending the sphere of the person instead of impul-
sion in order to "see" the essence of impulsion. He 
called this technique "dionysian reduction." 
Throughout his work, Scheler developed his own 
phenomenology of intuition, which was not an appli-
cation of Husserl 's method. As increasing attention is 
devoted to his work, he is increasingly recognized for 
his many brilliant insights into the nature ofthe human 
person as a whole.

FRIEDRICH WILHELM JOSEPH VON SCHELLING 
(1775--1854) 
Schelling does not engage in "pheno-
menology" in the senses of either HEGEL or EDMUND 
HUSSERL, but he encounters problems !ater confronted 

FRIEDRICH WILHELM JOSEPH VON SCHELLING 
635 
by MARTIN HEIDEGGER as the latter tums away from the 
"phenomenology" he had earlier embraced. 
Hegel's Phănomenologie des Geistes (Phenomen-
ology of spirit, 1807) is an investigation that purports 
to lead the reader along a path compellingly ordered 
by dialectica! logic, from a presuppositionless and 
immediately available natural standpoint to sophisti-
cated positions from which an "absolute knowing" is 
possible. This "absolute knowing" is then articulated 
through the unfolding of the Hegelian system in Wis-
senschafi der Logik (Science of logic, 1812-16) and 
the philosophies of nature and spirit (Enzyklopiidie 
der philosophischen Wissenschafien [Encyclopedia of 
philosophical sciences, 3rd. ed., 1830]). Hegel intro-
duces his Phanomenologie des Geistes in part as a 
reaction to Schelling's attempts, in such early works 
as System des transzendentalen Idealismus (System of 
transcendental idealism, 1800) and Darstellung meines 
Systems der Philosophie (Exhibition of my system of 
philosophy, 1801 ), simply to begin from an absolute 
standpoint, without showing how that standpoint is at-
tained. In Hegel 's view, Schelling's absolute appears 
"as though from a pistol." 
From as early as 1795, in his Philosophische Briefe 
iiber Dogmatimus und Kriticismus (Philosophicallet-
ters concerning dogmatism and skepticism), Schelling 
insists that there could be no need for any preliminary 
discipline of the sort Hegelian phenomenology was 
supposed to be, arguing that problems arise not with 
attaining the absolute, but only with escaping it: "we 
would all agree concern ing the absolute ifwe never left 
its sphere." Even following the appearance of Hegel's 
Phănomenologie, Schelling never acknowledges the 
need for a discipline serving its purpose. 
Husserlian phenomenology differs most strongly 
from other philosophical endeavors in its reliance 
on description of experiences rather than on abstract 
or theoretical argument. Schelling, however, engages 
throughout his career in what the young Heidegger 
-
still in his own "phenomenological" days- calls 
"theory without phenomenology," i.e., rational con-
structions not grounded in descriptions of human ex-
periences. 
Unlike both Hegel and Husserl, Schelling is con-
cerned not with experiences that human beings do or 
could have, but instead with experiences attributed hy-
pothetically to an absolute spirit attempting to come to 
know itself. In displacing human experiences from the 
heart ofhis system, Schelling opposes phenomenology 
in both the Hegelian and Husserlian senses. 
If there is a positive connection between Schelling 
and a form of phenomenology, it is with the form 
projected by the young Heidegger. Just as Schelling, 
throughout his career, attempts to reconcile the con-
fiicting demands of freedom and system- to develop 
a system that would be comprehensive without denying 
the latitude and fiexibility required by human freedom 
-
the young Heidegger envisages a phenomenology 
that would reconcile the conflict ing demands of tem-
porality and foundationalism- an account that would 
be strictly scientific without denying or distorting what 
THEODORE KISIEL has called "the evasive immediacy of 
the human condition." 
Heidegger looks positively to Schelling only af-
ter he abandons his "scientific" project, and with 
it his description of his own work as "phenomen-
ological." Although he alludes to a Schelling ti-
tie -
Philosophische Untersuchungen iiber das We-
sen der menschlichen Freiheit und die damit zusam-
menhăngenden Gegenstănde (Philosophical investiga-
tions into the essence of human freedom, 1809)- in 
naming his 1930 lecture course "On the Essence of 
Human Freedom," Schelling is not considered in that 
course. In 1936 and 1941, however, he devotes courses 
explicitly to the work recalled by his earlier title, de-
scribing that work as "the peak of the metaphysics 
of German idealism" and its author as "the genuinely 
creative and most broadly provocative (am weitesten 
ausgreifende) thinker of this entire epoch of German 
philosophy." 
Schelling's central contribution, according to Hei-
degger, is his completion ofthe transformation of"the 
idealism ofthe 'I think (ich stelle vor)' of Descartes to 
the higher idealism of 'I am free,' to the idealism of 
freedom," a transformation stimulated by KANT's Kritik 
der praktischen Vernunfi (Critique of practica! reason, 
1788), but also retarded by the problematic relation, 
in Kant's thought, between the practica! employment 
of reason and the theoretical. Schelling does not rec-
ognize that this transformation entails ( 1) a shift of 
attention from the absolute sought by the German ide-
alists ·to the finitude that is "the essence of all being" 
(das Wesen a/les Seyns), and thus (2) the abandon-
ment of metaphysics (and !ater of "phenomenology," 

636 
ENCYCLOPEDJA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
as foundational science). Nevertheless, that Schelling's 
thought was "shattered" by his own work is, in Heideg-
ger's view, evidence ofhis decisive importance within 
the history ofWestern philosophy.

ALFRED SCHUTZ 
ALANWHITE 
Williams College 
Schutz was horn in Vienna 
on April 13, 1899 and, after service in the Austrian 
army in World War I, he attended the University of 
Vienna where he received a doctorate in law in 1921, 
concentrating chiefly in international law. Upon re-
ceiving his degree he became executive secretary of 
the Austrian Banker's Association, joining the private 
bank of Reitler and Company in 1929 -
remaining 
with the company when he emigrated with his family 
to France in 1938 and to the United States in 1940. In 
1943 he received a part-time teaching position at the 
newly formed Graduate Faculty of Politica] and Social 
Science at the New School for Social Research. It was 
not until 1956, however, that he was able to devote 
himself to the responsibilities of a full-time academic 
position. 
Schutz's intellectual interests and studies were mul-
tifarious, as can be seen in the collection of early 
writings edited by ILJA SRUBAR under the title Theo-
rie der Lebensformen ( 1981, subsequently translated 
under the title Life Forms and Meaning Strucures). 
Between 1921 and 1929, however, he developed the 
central focus for his many interests in the sciences and 
the humanities. There are numerous factors that con-
tribute to that focus, outstanding among them being 
the inftuence ofhis teachers Hans Kelsen (1881-1973) 
and Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973) in LAW and ECO-
NOMICS. Study of the former suggested to Schutz the 
need to find a way from the normative discipline of 
law to its application and underpinnings in the HUMAN 
SCIENCES and then to the underlying "subjective" inter-
pretations of social, legal, and economic phenomena; 
study of the latter, especially with respect to the anal-
ysis of impersonal economic and legal mechanisms, 
suggested to Schutz the need to revise and develop 
anew and more broadly the ideas of subjectivity and 
understanding, and, after intensive study of the work 
ofMAX WEBER, the way in which mutual understanding 
among human beings comes about in the first place. 
This focus ofSchutz's studies, guiding him throughout 
his life, was first formally developed in Der sinnhafte 
Aujbau der sozialen Welt (The meaningful strucure of 
the social world, 1932) and still significantly informs 
the project and plan of his last, uncompleted book, 
Strukturen der Lebenswelt (The structures of the life-
world, posthumously completed by his student THOMAS 
LUCKMANN in 1979/1984 ). 
Schutz soon realized that Weber's work, important 
as it was, could not adequately account for how the 
self-understanding and self-interpretation that proceed 
in common sense can be made into the subject matter of 
the social sciences and amenable to theoretical inves-
tigation. To develop this problem Schutz sought inspi-
ration in HENRI BERGSON's examination of the duree or 
inner duration characterizing the life of consciousness. 
Here he found the means for bypassing the difficulty of 
having to begin with concepts to disc! o se the basic na-
ture ofthe relationship ofl and Thou and its typifying 
(otherwise taken for granted by social scientists such 
as Weber), which, while not the domain of the social 
sciences, nonetheless defines the very daily world in 
which they locate their problems. 
In short, how is legitimate scientific knowledge pos-
sible of the world defined by everyday, nonscientific 
life in the natural attitude? The solution for Schutz was 
to find a way to proceed from the inner duration to the 
common, typifying I-Thou world ofthings and events 
that comprises the foundations of everyday working 
life. Schutz's first attempt to deal with the problem

ALFRED SCHUTZ

was in terms of"life forms," a concept derived as much 
from WILHELM DILTHEY as from MAX SCHELER and Berg-
son. It was also in this connection, in the late 1920s, 
that Schutz first began to formulate the problem ofrel-
evance, which was inaccessible from the standpoint 
of the concept of life forms, and his own ideas about 
the sociality ofthe I-Thou relationship. These were to 
become the central themes of Der sinnhafte Aujbau, 
which required a more reliable foundation than that 
provided by Bergson. That foundation was found in 
the work of EDMUND HUSSERL. 
Quite early on, possibly in his university days, 
Schutz had been encouraged to read Husserl by FE-
LIX KAUFMANN. However, it was only from about 1928 
on that Schutz turned to the intensive study of Husserl: 
Husserl's lectures on the consciousness of inner time 
( Vorlesungen zur Phanomenologie des inneren Zeit-
bewusstseins, 1928), then the newly published book 
on transcendental logic (Formale und transzenden-
tale Logik, 1929), afterwards Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologische Philosophie 
1 ( 1913 ), and finally the early Logische Untersuchun-
gen (1900---190 1) -
all of which he read and dis-
cussed, section by section, with Felix Kaufmann. In 
a very short time Schutz had thoroughly mastered the 
phenomenology of Husserl, which can be seen in his 
mid-1930s reviews of Formale und transzendentale 
Logik and Meditations cartesiennes ( 1931) and his de-
tai led review of Grundlegung der Lehre vom sozialen 
Verband (Foundations ofthe theory of social organiza-
tion, of 1932) by his friend from Japan TOMOO OTAKA. 
Because the latter work was largely based only on 
Husserl 's Logische Untersuchungen, Schutz severely 
criticized it by showing that it is rather in the context 
of Husserl's !ater transcendental phenomenology that 
the necessary philosophical underpinning for clarify-
ing the constituting of social organizations with respect 
to legal, economic and politica! theory may be found. 
To be sure, Schutz had already suggested this in his 
extensive analyses ofthe components and structures of 
sociality in Der sinnhafte Aufbau, published the same 
year as Otaka's book, and in which Schutz either sup-
planted or reinforced Bergson 's insights with Husserl 's 
in coming to grips with the phenomena of I and Thou 
and the constituting of subjective and objective MEAN-
ING in a rich diversity of situations in the intersubjective 
everyday world of working. 
Alfred Schutz had as many criticisms of Husserl 
as of Weber, but as the review of Otaka shows, he 
strongly held the belief that Husserl was right about 
the transcendental dimension of human experience in 
the social world. To be sure, his interests were often 
different, and he limited himself to certain problems, 
as did his friend Felix Kaufmann, and as Kaufmann 
noted, deliberately to limit oneselfto certain problems 
does not mean to be limited. Thus, for example, in 
Der sinnhafte Aufbau Schutz limited himselfto certain 
problems in the psychology and sociology of the ev-
eryday world ofworking, but always within the frame-
work of transcendenta[ CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY. 
This strategy persisted throughout his last writings. 
Thus Schutz writes that the aim of his book, "to 
analyze the meaning-phenomena in mundane social-
ity, does not require the acquisition of transcenden-
tal experience beyond [ mundane sociality] and there-
fore a further remaining in the transcendental pheno-
menological reduction." Referring to Husserl 's "Nach-
wort zu meinen 'Ideenlldots "' ( 1930), Schutz explains 
what he means by saying that he is not concerned 
with the phenomena of constitution in the transcen-
dentally reduced sphere, but instead with their "corre-
sponding correlates in the natural attitude"- "corre-
lates" because for every proposition in transcendental 
phenomenology there is a correlative one in psychol-
ogy and sociology, but the converse need not be the 
case. He then proceeds to formulate a transcendental-
phenomenological eidetic account of the conscious-
ness of inner time, applying the results to the clar-
ification of the natural attitude not as transcenden-
tallyphenomenologically reduced, but as p~ychologi­
cally-phenomenogically reduced. Schutz then devel-
ops a psychological, and by extension, a sociologica! 
phenomenology of great originality consistent with a 
transcendental phenomenology, but actually a CONSTI-
TUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE NATURAL ATTITUDE. 
Moreover, because not every proposition in a tran-
scendental phenomenology is included in phenomen-
ological psychology or sociology, it is possible to pro-
ceed without having to maintain the transcendental 
phenomenological attitude. In this context, too, Schutz 
locates much of his criticism of Husserl: namely, that 
not every proposition about intersubjectivity and the 
ego, about behavior and action in the taken-for-granted 
world of working and its systems of relevance and 

638 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
typifying, is included in the transcendental phenomen-
ology. 
At the same time, this signifies that some method-
ological procedures in the social sciences must be de-
veloped that have their own warrant and legitimacy 
because they deal with "correlates in the natural atti-
tude" of subjective and objective meanings of action, 
even though set in the context of transcendental pheno-
menology. Like the natural scientist, the social scientist 
deals with theoretical constructs, but rather "ofthe sec-
ond degree," for in contriving them the social scientist 
must make allowance for the interpretations that social 
actors ha ve ofthemselves and of each other in the daily 
world ofworking. Schutz was able then to further cir-
cumscribe the limits of transcendental phenomenology 
especially in "The Problem of Transcendental Inter-
subjectivity in Husserl" ( 1957), as well as in essays 
concerning methodology. 
Schutz sent a copy of Der sinnhafte Aujbau to 
Husserl, who responded enthusiastically. Through the 
auspices of Felix Kaufmann, Schutz met Husserl for 
the first time in 1932, and he continued to visit Husserl 
three or four times a year up to Christmas of 193 7, 
shortly before Husserl 's death. It was at Husserl 's re-
quest that Schutz wrote his reviews of Meditations 
cartesiennes and Formale und transzendentale Logik. 
He also heard Husserllecture in Vienna in May of 1935 
and again in Prague in November of 1935, when he 
watched Die Krisis der europaischen Wissenschqften 
und die transzendentale Phiinomenologie ( 1936) take 
shape, supplying new impetus and ideas for the focus 
of his work on the lifeworld. We may say with ARON 
GURWJTSCH that Schutz's work is truly re1ated to this 
last phase of Husserl 's thought. 
With his emigration to the United States and in-
troduction to academic life at the Graduate Facu1ty, 
Schutz increased his knowledge ofthe works of Amer-
ican sociologists and anthropologists, finding a shared 
concern for basic social theory as well as important 
ideas for its philosophical underpinnings. At the same 
time he became acquainted with the work of WILLIAM 
JAMES, John Dewey (1859-1952), Alfred North White-
head (1861-1947), and George Herbert Mead (1863-
1931) among many others; and at the instigation of 
MARVIN FARBER, he became an editor and contributor 
to the newly foundedjournal, Philosophy and Pheno-
menological Research. Atthis time Schutz commenced 
to address the academic communty in lectures, first at 
Harvard and then elsewhere, as he steadily gained a 
wider audience in philosophy and sociology. By the 
mid-1940s Schutz had begun to develop in detail some 
ofthe ideas he had already spawned in the !ater 1930s 
on the social person; the lifeworld as the working world 
of everyday life with its empirica! and pure typifyings; 
and onfinite provinces of meaning and their correlative 
"multiple realities," which, along with his concepts of 
sign and symbol, provided him with the conceptual 
means to unify his focus with respect to law, eco-
nomics, LITERATURE, painting, MUSIC, phantasms, and 
dreams. 
While his essays "The Stranger" ( 1944) and "The 
Homecomer" (1945) deepened the connections be-
tween American sociOLOGY and his own attempts at the 
phenomenological grounding of sociology, in the late 
1940s and early 1950s Schutz extended and enlarged 
his investigations into the problems of intersubjectiv-
ity and relevance in both sociology- e.g., in "Making 
Music Together" ( 1951) and "Mozart and the Philoso-
phers" (1956)-and philosophy, e.g., in "Equality and 
the Meaning Structure of the Social World" (1957), 
"Max Scheler's Epistemology and Ethics" ( 1957-58), 
and 'Tiresias or Our Knowledge of Future Events" 
( 1959). 
By the late 1950s Schutz decided to puii together 
in three volumes of Collected Papers some thirty pub-
lished essays displaying various approaches to his fo-
cus of thought achieved from the late 1930s. He also 
realized that the focus required a systematic presenta-
tion impossible in essay form. Shortly before his death, 
he began planning a large work. However, the precari-
ous state ofhis health prevented him from carrying out 
this task, leaving only outlines and plans for analysis of 
both old and new themes, working pa pers, and instruc-
tions for completion of the work; as mentioned, the 
task was eventually completed by Thomas Luckmann. 
Alfred Schutz died on May 20, 1959. 
Alfred Schutz was a remarkable and powerful, at 
times mesmerizing, teacher who brought out the best 
in his students, some ofwhom were able to become his 
collaborators and explore in original ways the frontiers 
of social and philosophical thought that he opened up. 
In his teaching as well as in his scientific research he 
sought to produce a systematic phenomenology and so-
ciology ofthe lifeworld, detailing and analyzing its spe-

cific structures and interna! workings (with the "epoche 
of the natural attitude"), its various principles of orga-
nization; and its shifts of accents of reality in various 
provinces of meaning with respect to the "paramount 
reality" of the working world of daily life. Moreover, 
he provided a large body of supporting and substan-
tiating phenomenological analyses with his "method 
of ideal types" reconstructing the typifications of daily 
life by exploring the typifying intentionalities of the 
lifeworld, revealing their phenomenological genesis 
from pre-predicative grounds to self-conscious gener-
alizations and formalizations grounding what MAURICE 
NATANSON has termed an "epistemology of the social 
world" that is of great importance for the various so-
cial and cultural sciences. 
Schutz's critica! studies revised Bergson's idea of 
dud:e in light ofHusserl's idea ofinnertime; Bergson's 
notion of memory and shifting accents of reality was 
broadened and redeveloped in terms of James 's subuni-
verses ofreality; and both Weber's notion ofsubjective 
and objective meaning and Mead's notion of the ma-
nipulatory sphere of action as core of the paramount 
reality of daily life were carried to their radical extreme 
when redeveloped in terms of the typicality of social 
ro les, the stock of knowledge at hand, and the moti-
vations of actions. Schutz's published correspondence 
with Talcott Parsons (1902-1979), ARON GURWJTSCH, 
and Eric Voegelin ( 190 1-1985) is especially important 
for new insights into sociology and phenomenology as 
well as for revealing the bearing ofhis criticism. 
In brief, if Aron Gurwitsch may be said to have 
sought the principles of organization of the noematic 
characterization of the sociocultural world, Alfred 
Schutz sought the principles of organization of its 
correlative, constituting noetic characterization. At his 
death, his work was not just incomplete in a negative 
sense, but also in the positive sense ofproviding a pro-
gram for furture work. The focus of his life's work 
included tasks that he realized were still unfulfilled, 
such as developing in the spirit of Leibniz a "logic of 
everyday thinking" that sti li remains a major requisite 
for establishing the foundations of the phenomenology 
and sociology of the lifeworld. Yet it is as much in 
the accomplished work as in clear sight of the unful-
filled tasks that his greatness and continuing inftuence 
in many different fields lie.

GEORG SIMMEL 
The German sociologist-
philosopher Georg Simmel is generally remembered, 
along with his contemporaries Emile Durkheim ( 1858-
1917), Ferdinand Tonnies (1855-1936), and MAX WE-
BER (1864-1920), as a founder of modern sociOLOGY 
and a major impetus to sociology's elevation to scien-
tific status. Even today's more empirically trained soci-
ologists possess at least a general familiarity with Sim-
mel's theoretical writings on the philosophical foun-
dations of sociology and other matters sociologica!. 
The same cannot be said, however, of philosophers. 
Even philosophers whose interests lie in contemporary 
Continental philosophy have generally failed system-
atically to study Simmel's work. Consequently, highly 
interesting and provocative points of contact between 
Simmel's philosophy of history and Lebensphiloso-
phie and the phenomenological philosophies of ED-
MUND HUSSERL and MARTIN HEIDEGGER have llOt been 
recognized. 
Born in Berlin on March 1, 1858, Simmel pur-
sued his university studies and spent most of his pro-
fessional life there. He began his studies in history, 
Vălkerpsychologie, and philosophy at Berlin in 1876 
and remained there until the completion of his Ha-
bilitationsschrift in 1884. Shortly thereafter he began 
teaching as a Privatdozent at the university, and in 1901 
he received an appointment as Extraordinarius profes-
sor. Despite his success as a lecturer and an impressive 
record ofpublications, Simmel was never promoted to 
Ordinarius or fu li professorship at Berlin. He also twice 
failed- in 1908 and again in 1915 -
to secure a full 
professorship at Heidelberg. In 1914, Simme1 accepted 
what he considered to be a 1ess desirab1e appointment 
to Ordinarius professor at Strasbourg where, after just 
four years, he died on September 28, 1918. 
Simmel's disappointing academic journey from 
Berlin to Strasbourg was perhaps portended in his 
student days. His first dissertation -
Psychologisch-
ethnographische Studien iiber die Anfiinge der Musik 
(Psychological-ethnographic studies concerning the 
origin of music)- was rejected by his readers, Her-
mann Ludwig von Helmholtz ( 1821-1894) and Eduard 
Zeller (1814-1908), and in order to complete his doc-
toral studies, Simmel submitted a second dissertation, 
Das Wesen der Materie nach Kants physiker Mon-
adologie (The essence of matter according to Kant's 
physical monadology, 1881 ). Simmel returned to Kant 
for his Habilitationsschrift but once again found him-
self beset with difficulties that would delay the com-
pletion of his habilitation until 1884. The problem this 
time was Zeller's "unsatisfactory" (ungeniigend)judg-
ment ofSimmel 's Probevorlesung, ajudgment that was 
ostensibly based as much on the tone as the substance 
of Simmel's response to Zeller's question regarding 
the precise location ofthe soul. 
It is difficult to explain why a thinker such as 
Simmel, whose work shows genuine creativity and 
originality, would experience such difficulties in gaiu-
ing acceptance. Some oft-cited reasons are that anti-
Semitism within the German academic community 
hampered his efforts to secure an academic position 
commensurate with his accomplishments; concerns

over his alleged relativism and aestheticism made it 
generally difficult to accept his thought; reservations 
about the new field of sociology within philosophical 
circles extended by association to Simmel himself for 
his involvement in it; and Simmel's "lively and versa-
tile" intellect, as R. G. Collingwood once described it, 
was insufficient to overcome questions about the con-
tent and unsystematic character of his philosophical 
writings. 
Of course, Simmel did not help his own cause when 
he intentionally eschewed the scholarly convention of 
scrupulously citing the works of contemporaries and 
predecessors to whom he might be indebted; deliber-
ately approached objects of study in interdisciplinary 
fashion, at times obfuscating the lines of demarcation 
between sociology, psychology, and philosophy; and 
steadfastly refused to engage in textual exegesis as 
an end in itself. Simmel was much less inclined to-
ward scholarship in the strict sense than he was toward 
philosophizing about the matters themselves. His goal 
was to philosophize not "vis-a-vis books, but vis-a-vis 
life," and this effort alone is reason enough to sug-
gest, as MICHAEL LANDMANN has, that SimmeJ fuJfilJed 
in his own fashion the injunction issued by Husserlian 
phenomenology- "zuriick zu den Sachen selbst." 
The matters themselves that carne under Simmel's 
gaze represent the broadest conceivable range of cul-
tural phenomena and philosophical issues and included 
such "unphilosophical," quotidian topics as coquetry, 
music, money, society, FEMINISM, and fashion, as well 
as the more traditional philosophical themes of AES-
THETrcs, HISTORY, TIME, and ETHICS. GeneralJy speak-
ing, though, Simmel's philosophical interest was more 
focused than it first appears because each investiga-
tion probes the same basic philosophical question, viz., 
what is the precise nature of the relationship between 
subjective experiential life and the objective cultural 
forms that it engenders and encounters? Objective 
forms are rooted in life; they arise from our mental ac-
tivities, yet they bear the sense of autonomous entities 
because, once created, they follow their own indepen-
dent logic and momentum, which means we can, and 
often do, experience them as opposing life and block-
ing its development. For Simmel, this tension between 
life and its creations is the source ofwhat he calls the 
"tragedy of eul ture." 
The importance Simmel attaches to the objective 
content or MEANING (Sinn) belonging to expressions of 
life defuses any attempt to explain the phenomenon 
of cu! ture in terms of NATURALISM and PSYCHOLOGISM, 
and at the same time, it provides an unmistakable 
bridge connecting him to the phenomenological tradi-
tion. Even though Simmel 's connection with that tradi-
tion has received little attention, it has been noted that 
Simmel's sociocultural studies should have a certain 
appea1 for phenomenologists, that his approach to so-
cial phenomena is "phenomenological in method and 
spirit" (GEORGE PSATHAS), and that there is a possible 
direct link between Simmel and phenomenology via 
his influence on Husserl and ALFRED SCHUTZ. There is 
good reason to believe that Simmel influenced not just 
Husserl, but also Heidegger, and any consideration of 
Simmel's relevance to the development ofphenomen-
o1ogy needs to look in both directions. 
As regards Heidegger, an observation by his former 
student, HANS-GEORG GADAMER, provides the essential 
clue as to where we should begin looking for Sim-
melian traces in Heidegger's thought. Gadamer men-
tions in a note in his Wahrheit und Methode (Truth and 
method, 1960) that as early as 1923, Heidegger spoke 
to him "with admiration" of Simmel 's !ater writings. 
He goes on to identify Simmel's temporal conception 
of life as "truly past and future," a conception that 
Simmel articulates in his Lebensanschauung (View of 
life, 1918), as the source of Heidegger's admiration. 
Gadamer obviously takes this matter quite seriously, 
since he underscores the fact that Heidegger's remark 
was "not just a general acknowledgement of Simmel 
as a phi1osopher." 
A cursory study of §72 of Heidegger's Sein und 
Zeit (1927) against the backdrop of Simmel's Leben-
sanschauung will uncover enough suggestive and 
provocative parallels between Heidegger 's analysis 
and Simmel 's thoughts on life and death to support 
Gadamer's contention. For Heidegger, the "connect-
edness of life" derives from the manner in which DA-
SEIN "stretches along between birth and death." In or-
der fully to appreciate the way this "connectedness" 
is lived, Dasein's orientation toward the future, its 
being-toward-death, as Heidegger would say, must be 
comp1emented by looking back at the other end of 
the temporal arc, the beginning, and thus at Dasein 's 
"being-toward-the-beginning." From this new perspec-
tive, o ne can understand why the "question" ofhow life 

642 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
forms a unity as it passes through successive moments 
of time is, in fact, a pseudoproblem that only arises 
when life is viewed from the outside, as a mere en-
tity having the continuity of a thing in objective time. 
Here only the experience that is present-at-hand in the 
"now" is thought to be real, and "those experiences 
which have passed away or are only coming along, 
either are no Ion ger orare not yet 'actual'." 
With Heidegger's observations in mind, we turn 
to Simmel's Lebensanschauung, where, especially in 
Chapter 1, we tind him covering much the same ground 
as Heidegger. When Simmel wrote this work he was 
aware of his own impending death, yet he also recog-
nized that the moment was really no different from any 
other during his life except perhaps for a heightened 
awareness of death, because it was evident that "death 
is imminent in Iife from the outset .... " For Simmel, 
an individual 's death is not just another predictable 
event, something that undoubtedly occurs one day and 
establishes the Iimit of the individual 's Iife but has no 
bearing on the present. On the contrary, death is an es-
sential part oflife as it is being lived, and for that reason 
it has a bearing on the individual 's life from beginning 
to end. AII this follows from Simmel 's conception of 
the temporality of Iife. 
Simmel anticipates Heidegger's characterization of 
life as stretching out in the twofold directions ofbirth 
and death, because for him birth and death are not mere 
appendages to Iife, as though life were nothing more 
than the content filling the temporal space between 
these two poles. Rather, Iife embraces both poles be-
cause "life is truly past and future .... " As Simmel 
expresses it, "The mode of existence which does not 
restrict its reality to the present moment, thereby plac-
ing past and future in the realm of the unreal, is what 
we calllife. " 
As with Heidegger, Simmel finds any conception of 
life that reduces Iife to a thing among things, i.e., to an 
entity like any other that is in time, tobe a misconcep-
tion. Nonetheless, even on this mistaken view, Iife is 
assigned a type of temporality, but only to the extent 
that it is thought to traverse a succession of"nows," and 
this is at best a secondary and derivative notion oftime 
and one that is incompatible with life as experienced. 
The reality of Iife cannot be confined to the present 
simply because its past is thought to be no longer and 
its future not yet, because to do so would render Iife 
atemporal. From the perspective oflife itself, its being 
is time. "Time is Iife," remarks Simmel, "because life 
alone transcends the atemporal present of every other 
kind of reality in both directions and thereby realizes 
... the temporal dimension, that is, time." 
For Simmel, the temporal structure of Iife is the 
condition for the possibility of HISTORY as a science, 
or, as Heidegger notes, "historiology, as the science 
of Dasein s history, must 'presuppose' as its 'object' 
the entity which is primordially historical." Although 
they see the past, present, and future as inextricably 
intertwined in Iife -
or Dasein, as Heidegger would 
say- they nonetheless both accord a certain priority 
to the future insofar as it is the source from which the 
past and the present derive their significance for us. 
Simmel emphatically makes this point in one of his 
last works dealing with the problem of history, "Die 
historische Formung" (1917-18), where he notes that 
the "historical moment" must be understood in terms 
of the future, i.e., its possibilities and consequences. 
Human events and creations are authentic objects of 
"history only ifthey fali under the form oflife." In fact, 
a distinguishing characteristic of HISTORY as a HUMAN 
SCIENCE is its connection with Iife. History, of course, 
is not life, but neither "does it cut the umbilical cord 
that connects it to the bloodstream ofhuman Iife as it is 
actually Iived. The inner dynamic that is derived from 
life itself also vibrates within the structure of history." 
Perhaps, as Heidegger observes, Simmel's philosophy 
of history is primari1y concerned with setting forth an 
epistemology of historiography, but his insights ha ve 
deeper significance, as Heidegger himself no doubt 
recognized. 
Heidegger's encounter with Simmel's work is not 
the only occasion to caii for a consideration of Sim-
mel's impact on phenomenological philosophy, for 
Husserl too apparently consulted Simmel 's phi1osophy 
of history and was probably influenced by it. Interest-
ingly, Husserl's attention seems to have focused pri-
marily on those works in which the issues pertaining 
to history, including questions of historiography, are 
directly confronted. What makes the Husseri-Simmel 
connection particularly noteworthy is the likelihood 
that the Iines of influence ran in both directions with 
Husserl influencing Simmel and Simmel influencing 
Husserl. There are a dozen letters from Simmel to 
Husserl in the Husserl Briefwechsel. 

GEORG SJMMEL 
643 
It is widely accepted that the problem of history 
gains prominence in Husserl's phenomenology during 
the last phase ofhis philosophical development,just as 
it is widely accepted that Husserl 's concern for history 
and the historical world owes much to his familiar-
ity with WILHELM DILTHEY's philosophy of the human 
sciences. What is less recognized is the mention by 
LUDWIG LANDGREBE in a Selbstdarstelfung that Husserl 
presented the 1905 second edition of Simmel 's Die 
Probleme der Geschichtsphilosophie (The problem of 
the philosophy ofhistory) as a seminar topic in the sum-
mer semester of 1924. Unfortunately, there appear tobe 
no lecture notes in Husserl's Nachlass corresponding 
to Die Probleme. Nonetheless, Husserl 's copy of this 
work, along with his copies of Simmel's Hauptprob-
leme der Philosophie (Major problems ofphilosophy, 
191 O) and Vom Wesen des historischen Verstehens (On 
the essence ofhistorical understanding, 1918), are part 
of his personal library now preserved at the Husserl 
Archives in Leuven. Each text contains sufficient un-
derlinings and marginal notes to offer a glimpse of 
where, from Husserl's point of view, there is agree-
ment and disagreement between the two men. More 
importantly, these textual notations provide evidence 
that Husserl took Simmel 's contributions to the philos-
ophy ofhistory seriously. 
Three points of convergence stand out: ( 1) their 
criticism ofhistoricism, (2) their rejection ofpsychol-
ogism, and (3) their acceptance of"motives" as some-
how central to the process of historical understanding. 
At Ieast six years before Husserl 1aunched his own 
weli-known attack on historicism in the Logos article, 
"Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft" ( 1911 ), Sim-
mel had already set out to extricate philosophy from 
its grip. Simmel 's strategy was not to transform phi-
losophy into a rigorous science as it was with Husserl. 
In fact, in a certain sense, Simmel's approach more 
closely resembled Dilthey's inasmuch as he consid-
ered philosophy itself a Weltanschauung that flows 
from and reflects a particular type of human spiritu-
ality. That said, however, Simmel clearly has no in-
tention ofyielding ground to the forces ofhistoricism, 
especialiy when philosophy itself is at stake. Antici-
pating Husserl, he Iaments that the "concept ofhistory 
has become an idol," and that historicism tends to draw 
at least two erroneous conclusions regarding philoso-
phy: ( 1) that the history of philosophy comprises the 
legitimate subject matter of philosophizing in general 
and (2) that philosophical theories and the philosophers 
that proffered them can only be understood historically, 
i.e., in terms of the place they occupy in a historical 
sequence. 
Simmel takes issue with both points. He rejects 
historicism's first claim because it rests on the false 
assumption that the realm of philosophy can be ac-
cessed without actually philosophizing. What results 
is a mode of reductionism that conflates philosophi-
cal reflection and purely historical reflection, if indeed 
there is such a thing for Simmel. The mark of philos-
ophy is not mere receptivity, but productivity, which 
is why he describes genuine philosophizing as "abso-
Iutely ahistorical." What renders it ahistorical is not 
the epistemic value of its content, and certainly not if 
this were to imply the miraculous discovery and ex-
pression of immutable truths beyond history. Nothing 
could be more foreign to Simmel 's thought than such 
a conception of philosophy. On the contrary, if philos-
ophy is ahistorical, it is so only insofar as ali genuine 
philosophizing brings forth something new, something 
that cannot be accounted for if a particular philoso-
phy is viewed as nothing more than an effect in a long 
causal series. For Simmel, ali genuine philosophizing 
arises from a fresh perspective on the "matters them-
selves," although such a perspective will sti li be shaped 
by an intimate awareness of antecedent perspectives. 
The history ofphilosophy is not simply a kaleidoscope 
of disparate and inchoate philosophical perspectives, 
but a nexus of such perspectives that is held together, 
however fragile1y, by their logica! content and by the 
fact that for those who seek to philosophize, the his-
tory of philosophy is their history, their past, and, as 
such, be1ongs to their present. This is the reason why 
the philosopher needs history, as Husserl himse1f rec-
ognized as early as the Logos article even though he 
failed fully to capitalize on the insight until his his-
torical reflections of Die Krisis der europăischen Wis-
senschaften und die transzendentale Phănomenologie 
(1936). 
AII of this brings us to Simmel 's reason for reject-
ing historicism's second claim that philosophies and 
phi1osophers must be understood historically, which, 
in turn, will shed light on his efforts to distance him-
self from the psychologistic orientation of the first 
edition of his Die Probleme. Even his early piece, 

644 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
"Uber Geschichte der Philosophie" ( 1904), reveals his 
attempt to void his theory of interpretation ofpsychol-
ogism and his last writings on the question of history 
-
including Das Problem der historischen Zeit (The 
problem ofhistorical time, 1916), "Die historische For-
mung" ( 1917-18), and Vom Wesen des historischen 
Verstehens ( 1918)- continue the effort with renewed 
vigor and conviction. 
As with Husserl, Simmel argues in Vom Wesen that 
even the "sort of interpretati an that seems to be purely 
historical regularly employs a form of trans-historical 
or superhistorical interpretation." Indeed, we could not 
even "understand the what or essence of things by ref-
erence to their historical development unless we al-
ready had some sort of independent understanding of 
this essence." Put another way, every historically ex-
isting philosophy expresses an objective content that 
is independent of the time and place in which it hap-
pens to appear, as well as of the psychic acts of the 
particular philosopher responsible for its articulation. 
For this reason, the author's intention has no bearing 
upon, and no role to play in, the objective interpre-
tation inasmuch as the sale aim is to understand the 
meaning of the work. To stress this point and at the 
same time to underscore his rejection of the histori-
cist's claim that we understand a philosophy when we 
understand the philosopher who elaborated it, Simmel 
reverses the matter and suggests instead that "we un-
derstand the philosopher insofar as we understand his 
[or her] philosophy." 
Of course, one might argue that Simmel 's abandon-
ment of his early psychologistic stance owes at least 
as much to Dilthey as it does to Husserl, but one needs 
to recall that Dilthey himself credits Husserl's Logis-
che Untersuchungen (1900--190 1) with providing the 
necessary conceptual tools to deal with the problem 
of psychologism. What these critiques of psycholo-
gism share- especially Simmel's and Husserl's-
is the acute awareness that to overcome or reject psy-
chologism is not a license to ignore the subjective or 
noetic si de of the intentiona] equation. Of course, any 
investigation ofthe mental acts necessary to constitute 
mental creations runs the risk of being interpreted by 
others as a relapse into psychologism, as was the case 
when Husserl tumed his attention in that direction in 
the sixth ofhis Logische Untersuchungen. Such inter-
pretations rest on a failure to recognize that what is at 
issue for Husserl and, of course, for Simmel, are not the 
real psychic acts of particular persons but the essential 
structures manifested in them and accessible via what 
Husserl calls EIDETIC METHOD. 
Just how successful Simmel is at overcoming psy-
chologism will undoubtedly remain open to discussion 
and debate, if for no other reason than his refusal to 
abandon his commitment to the idea of reconstructing 
or re-creating the mental activities that engender the 
sociohistorical phenomena one wishes to understand. 
However, "recreation" (Nachbildung) is nota question 
of achieving some sort of numerica! identity with an 
author, artist, or historical personality, for as Simmel 
himself observes, one need not become a Caesar in 
order to understand Caesar. What is of concern in the 
process ofre-creation pertains to the "trans-subjectivity 
or super-subjectivity of psychological structures them-
selves, structures which are only independent of their 
realization in any given mind." To paraphrase Sim-
mel, one could assert that the mental acts necessary 
for the accomplishments of objective culture are im-
manent to subjective life, and yet independent of the 
name ofthe individual who performs them. Simmel is 
not far from Husserl on this score, for the latter also 
maintains in Phănomenologische Psychologie [ 1925] 
that whenever numbers, propositions, or theories, for 
example, become objects of consciousness, the correla-
tive lived experiences must ha ve "essentially necessary 
and everywhere identica! structures." What is more 
significant, especially in light of Simmel 's remarks, is 
that Husserl 's observati an extends beyond the realm of 
purely theoretical accomplishments to include "psy-
chic correlations referring to objects of every region 
and category." 
It is also noteworthy that Simmel cautions against 
naturalistically conceiving the relations between men-
tal performances and then between these performances 
and their objects. Mental activities may legitimately be 
viewed psychophysically, but not when it is a matter 
ofunderstanding human behavior or sociocultural cre-
ations. What Simmel has in mind in Die Probleme is 
precisely what Husserl develops in considerable detail 
in §56 of Jdeen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie und 
phănomenologischen Philosophie II [ 1912-15] under 
the rubric of motivati an as the type of lawfulness that 
obtains in the spiritual realm. Husserl 's articulation 
and elaboration ofthe "law ofmotivation" would ha ve 

GEORG SIMMEL 
645 
helped Simmel clearly to distinguish the type of regu-
larity and necessary connections relevant in the sphere 
of life from the "nomological necessity" applicable in 
the domain of nature. As for Husserl, we should at 
least mention in this context that the importance that 
his conception of the human sciences attaches to mo-
tives and motivations has considerably more affinity 
with the principal tenets ofSimmel's thought than with 
Dilthey's theory of historical understanding. 
Naturally, there is still much that needs to be in-
vestigated regarding Simmel's relation to Husserl and 
Heidegger beyond the interna! connections and conver-
gences that have been mentioned. Although not dis-
cussed here, it is noteworthy that MAX SCHELER also 
held that money economies tend to ignore the quali-
tative dimension of reality and thus function hand in 
hand with the mechanistic conception of nature. Fur-
thermore, it is not surprising that Simmel's thoughts 
on time invite comparison with HENRI BERGSON's in-
fluential work on the same topic, given the fact that 
Simmel 's Lebensphilosophie was developed in part un-
der Bergson's influence. But even if one ignores these 
historical connections and especially the question of 
Simmel 's inftuence on Husserl and Heidegger, there 
are reasons to consider his treatment of temporality 
as phenomenological inasmuch as he does not simply 
give an account of TIME per se but, more precisely, 
attempts to describe the lived experience oftime. Fur-
thermore, even though his phenomenology of time is 
not explicitly articulated until the Lebensanschauung, 
it evidently already informs his philosophy ofhistory, 
and particularly his expression of it in his last writings. 
The true import ofhistorical understanding is not real-
ized if one thinks that it pertains merely to that which 
is "no longer." The "past as it really was," even if we 
could recreate it, would have neither significance nor 
relevance for us because it would be located outside 
the temporal structure of life. Here again the accent 
is on lived experience. Simmel 's work deserves to be 
considered a part of the complex web of inftuences at 
work in the formation and development of phenomen-
ological philosophy.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
SOCIAL GEOGRAPHY 
The expression 
"ge6graphie sociale" was coined by the French sociol-
ogist Paul de Rousiers ( 1857-1934) in a review of the 
first volume of Elisee Reclus's Nouvelle ge6graphie 
universelle: La terre et les hommes (New universal ge-
ography: The earth and human beings, 1876). This is 
one of the most comprehensive works in the history 
of geography since the publications of Alexander von 
Humboldt (1769-1859) and Cari Ritter ( 1 779-1859). 
Reclus ( 1830-1905) was inspired by George P. Marsh 's 
Man and Nature: Physical Geography as Modified by 
Human Action ( 1864 ), which is o ne of the founding 
texts of modern ECOLOGY, and was opposed to natural 
or environmental determinism, which was the domi-
nant geographical view ofhis time. 
In describing geographical conditions, Reclus and 
members of the Le Play school recognized the emer-
gence of new social formations produced by industrial-
ization. Everyday life went through dramatic transfor-
mations. Actors were confronted with labor and land 
markets and with competition for positions in the pro-
duction process and subsequently with competition for 
social positions. Furthermore, they had to deal with the 
bureaucratic order of sociallife through the radicalized 
territorial control mechanisms ofthe nation state. Thus 
the traditional "society"-"space" nexus changed from 
a religiously and culturally dominated one to a ratio-
nally constructed market and an institutionally con-
trolled bureaucracy. "Society" could then appear as a 
spatial mosaic, patterned in correspondence with social 
differences that are economically based- i.e., slums, 
business districts, fine residential areas- and norma-
tive or legally defined territories, i.e., counties, nation 
states, etc. 
In its beginning, social geography was first of ali 
and understood by most geographers as the geogra-
phy of the social. The aim of this subdiscipline of 
geography and/or sociOLOGY was to analyze the spatial 
patterning of the social facts. Guided by the ideal of 
natural sciences, the theoretical target for many social 
geographers was to discover the spatial (causal) laws 
of the social world. In the French tradition, the social 
geography of the Reclus and Le Play schools could 
not succeed. Paul Henri Vida! de la Blaches's (1845-
1918) "geographie humaine" dominated the discipline, 
defined not as HUMAN SCIENCE or social science but as 
science of places. Only in the late 1940s could Pierre 
George and Max Sorre establish social geography at 
French universities. They were interested in the social 
aspects, the regionallife forms, and the spatial pattern-
ing and regional differences of social classes. 
In the English-speaking world, the Chicago school 
of sociology pioneered this field of research by the turn 
ofthe 20th century. The models ofplant ecology ofthe 
Danish biologist Johannes E. Warming (1841-1924) 
had been applied to the study of regularities in the 
social patterning in cities. This starting point, strength-
ened by the scientific spatial approach pioneered by 
William Bunge and Brian J. L. Berry, had a strong 
infiuence on British and Anglo-American social ge-
ography until recently. On the one hand, the current 
orientations are linked to David Harvey's integration 
of MARXISM into the geographical discipline and to the 
application ofHenri Lefebvre's ( 1901-1991) theory of 
the production of space. On the other hand, strong ef-
forts are made, mainly by Derek Gregory and Nigel 
Thrift, to establish social geography as a discipline of 
critica! social science drawing on social theory and 
cultural studies. 
In the early 1920s, Sebald R. Steinmetz ( 1862-
1940) claimed for the Dutch tradition that "sociogra-
phie" should provide a knowledge of villages, cities, 
counties, and countries in their "concreteness" and pre-
ciseness, as the natural sciences do for the physical 
world. This knowledge should promote regional and 
urban planning, the most important application of so-
cial geography, especially in Continental Europe af-
ter World War II. In the 1950s Wolfgang Hartke for-
mulated a research program for the German "Sozial-
geographie" that was oriented toward the delimitation 
ofthe space established by the same social geographi-
cal behavior, meaning spaces of homogeneous values, 
and norms of behavior. Dietrich Bartels (1931-1983) 
brought this together with the claims of the Chicago 
school to discover spatiallaws in the pattern ing of so-
cial formations, settlements or urban systems, and the 
determinants of human actions, such as social norms 
and cultural values. The German and English-speaking 
debates merged in the 1970s and early 1980s into the 
scientific spatial approach. 
The humanistic critique of behavioral geography 
in the 1970s is focused on this combination of the 
spatial dimension, everyday life, and the scientific at-
titude. On the basis of EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY,

SOCIAL GEOGRAPHY

ANNE BUTTIMER, EDWARD RELPH, and DAVID SEAMON ob-
jected to the Cartesian idea of rationalistic, objective 
sciences that are alienated from the LIFEWORLD and 
-
at least implicitly -
from the Western project of 
reason. Instead of searching for spatiallaws and expla-
nations, human geography should be interested in the 
subjective meaning of places, the subjective percep-
tion of geographic spaces (mental maps) and objects, 
as well as in the subjective evaluation of natural haz-
ard and risk. The underlying hypothesis is that these 
aspects play an important role for environmental be-
havior and behavior in space. To make such knowledge 
available is seen as behavioral geography's contribu-
tion to a better understanding of human behavior. 
But for behavioral geography "space" is still the 
center of the geographer's attention and is still taken 
for granted. "Behavior" happens "in space" and "en-
vironment" is "perceived." What is not asked is if 
"behavior" and "perception" are concepts compatible 
with phenomenological thought. Neither are "space" 
nor "environment" seen as constituted by the know-
ing and acting subject. Therefore, this first reference to 
phenomenology is an adaptation from the perspective 
of traditional geographical concepts and frameworks. 
It is not an adaptation of phenomenological principles 
as such to the field of geographical research, including 
the task of questioning everyday realities. 
Based on phenomenological ground beyond psy-
chological categories, DAVID LEY questions some as-
pects of the "taken-for-granted world." Referring to 
ALFRED SCHUTZ'S CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE 
NATURAL ATTITUDE, he emphasizes the constitutive and 
meaningful character of INTERSUBJECTIVITY by moving 
from behavior to ACTION as the focus of research. He 
ca Ils on geographers to pay more attention to the sub-
jective meanings of actions produced in the natural 
attitude. They should not, consequently, be interested 
merely in the subjective perception ofplaces, but also 
in the subjective constitution ofthe meaning of"place." 
The city is no longer seen as a special pattern of social 
acts, but rather as a "mosaic of social worlds" with 
specific meanings of particular places. 
Torsten Hăgerstrand and the time geography ofthe 
LunJ school look at the paths of the agent's social 
actions through TIME and SPACE. The agent's BODY is 
recognized as an indivisible unit. Accordingly, action 
in space is always time consuming, and urban and re-
gional planning includes time planning. Schutz's con-
cept of"reach," and COURTICE ROSE's interpretation of it, 
are used in this context for the reconstruction of space-
time action pattems in the everyday world as well as 
for their optimization through urban and regional plan-
ning. SOLVEIG MĂRTESSON's studies of the "formation 
of biographies" and subjects' stocks of knowledge in 
space-time categories open a new research perspec-
tive for the analysis of children's socialization pro-
cesses. The influence of the rhythms and conflicts of 
parents with institutional space-time patterns become 
more transparent. 
For more encompassing social geographical studies, 
the BODY can be seen-in Schutz's terms-as a func-
tional link between inner processes and movements 
directed toward the outer world. On the one hand, the 
body in the physical world becomes a medium of ex-
pression for intentiona! consciousness. On the other 
hand, the spatial dimension is mediated and incorpo-
rated via the body, especially in face-to-face situations. 
Thus the physical or geographicallocation ofthe body 
affects the nature of pure duration experiences and 
thereby this location affects, as Schutz puts it in re-
ferring to HENRI BERGSON, memory-endowed duration. 
Therefore, the function of the body is to mediate be-
tween duration and the homogeneous space-time world 
of extension. 
Furthermore, the body is crucial for the constituting 
process and intersubjectivity. If a subject is learning 
intersubjectively valid rules of interpretati an that exist 
within a certain sociocultural world, then it is necessary 
for this subject to verify his or her interpretations and 
evaluations. This means that the constitution and ap-
plication of intersubjective meaning-contexts depend 
on the possibilities oftesting the validity ofallocations 
of MEANING. The attainment of certainty about inter-
subjectively valid constitutions of meaning is possible 
above ali in the immediate face-to-face situation. Here 
the bodies of the actors face each other directly as 
fields of expression for the ego and alter ego. This 
makes it possible to support communication through 
subtle symbolic bodily gestures, thus li miting the num-
ber of misinterpretations. Accordingly, co-presence is 
the prerequisite condition of ontologica! and interpre-
ti ve security, on which both the more abstract and the 
more anonymous allocations of meaning are based. 
For social geography this is oftwofold significance. 

648 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
First of ali, in the context of urban theory, this helps us 
to understand how face-to-face communication is still 
important for decisions in modern business worlds, 
even if telecommunication is largely available. In ur-
ban planning, this helps to make clear the social sig-
nificance of public spaces. Second, the significance of 
co-presence makes possible a deeper insight into con-
ditions ofthe everyday social worlds. The corporeality 
of human actors is thus central for an understanding 
ofthe so-called "society"-"space" nexus. In traditional 
societies highly tied to face-to-face situations, mean-
ing worlds have therefore much more thoroughgoing 
regional limits and are internally less segregated than 
in modern societies. 
To grasp these regionally differentiated worlds in an 
appropriate way is o ne of the premises of intercultural 
understanding as mutual understanding of actors living 
in different (regional) sociocultural worlds. Tradition-
ally, social and cultural geography play a crucial part 
in producing the knowledge of these regionally dif-
ferent worlds. This needs empirica! research in a sub-
jective perspective. In traditional human geography, 
"subjective" rarely refers to the subjective standpoint 
of the analyzed actor or action in the natural attitude. 
It rather refers to the subjective standpoint of the re-
searcher. This naive subjectivism can be overcome by 
a genuine adaptation of phenomenological methodol-
ogy, whereby Schutz's postulates of subjective inter-
pretation and adequacy are maintained. 
"Space" and "place" were and still are the unques-
tioned given key "objects" for most geographers and 
many "geographical investigations" ofthe world. JOHN 
PICKLES criticizes the objectivation of "space" and un-
derstands phenomenology as a method that seeks to 
clarify these concepts. On the basis of the existential 
phenomenology of MARTIN HEIDEGGER he elaborates a 
perspective in which "space" cannot be the abject of 
theoretization and empirica! research, but "spatiality" 
can. For him, an "ontology of spatiality" is needed 
to determine what must be the case if there can be 
anything like spatial and environmental behavior. The 
aim of social geography would then be the appropriate 
interpretation of "human spatiality." 
Starting from Heidegger's premise that the spatial 
ordering of entities occurs through human activities, 
we can understand that the spatiality of "ready-to-
hand" entities always belongs to a place within the 
"equipmental" context of a particular activity. It is im-
portant to point out that according to Heidegger, space 
and time do not serve merely as parameters. Both are 
rather foundational for DASEIN. "Space" (Raum) is the 
result of răumen (clearing away) and therefore has an 
existence of its own. However, neither is "space" part 
of the subject, nor does the subject observe the world 
"as if'' the world !ies in a Newtonian or container space. 
Rather, the subject for Heidegger is spatial and "spa-
tializes" the world through his or her mode of being. 
Consequently, in geography the assertion was made 
that human spatiality has to be part of a spatial theory. 
The fu ture of social and human geography will depend 
-
that was and sti li is largely the argument- on the 
nature ofthe research program that develops from this 
incorporation. Therefore, human geography should be 
understood as a human science of human spatiality. 
But is empirica! investigation of "spatiality" possible 
in spatial categories and can "spatiality" be the "abject" 
of spatial theory? Would it not be more accurate to link 
"spatiality" methodologically to human activities and 
actions instead of "space"? Nevertheless, spatial the-
ory would not be the core of the geographer's interest 
anymore. 
The constitutive phenomenology of EDMUND 
HUSSERL and Schutz makes it possible to start from 
the hypothesis that what geographers describe as spa-
tial problems are in fact problems of certain types of 
actions, actions in which corporeal involvement and 
material things are fundamental parts. The fact that the 
self experiences the body primarily in movement also 
means that it experiences the body only in, and not as, 
a functional context. The experience of movement is 
necessarily reinterpreted as an experience of space and 
opens up access to the world of extension. With the ex-
perience ofthe spatial character of one 's own body, the 
spatiality of things is discovered. The constitution of 
the material world and of"space" is thus bound up with 
the experiencing, moving, and acting "1." Apart from 
the experience ofthe spatiality ofthe physical-material 
world, the subject also experiences the qualities ofthe 
various objects in relation to his or her own body, veri-
fying them with corresponding meanings for her or his 
actions. 
With a radical integration of phenomenological 
thinking into social geography and the adaptation of 
action theory, the project of social geography changes 

SOCIAL GEOGRAPHY 
649 
its focus. The center of interest is no longer "space" or 
"spatiality." In accordancewith Schutz's idea ofthe so-
cial sciences, the aim of social geographical research 
is then the scientific reconstruction of the everyday 
making of geographies in the natural attitude. We cer-
tainly need precise theoretical categories to grasp the 
different types of everyday geographies. 
Schutz and THOMAS LUCKMANN offer a body-centered 
view of geographies in the natural attitude. This view 
begins from the distinction between the "world within 
immediate reach" and the "world within potential 
reach." The "immediate reach" encompasses a "pri-
mary" and a "secondary zone ofinftuence." The first is 
the zone of direct manipulation, the area that offers the 
fundamental text of ali reality. The "secondary zone of 
inftuence" is defined as that part of the world that the 
agent can only affect through the use of technological 
aids. Developments in technology offer a qualitative 
leap in the range of experience and an enlargement 
of the zone of operation. The areas within "potential 
reach" are divided into the world "within restorable 
reach" and "within accessible reach." The former was 
at one time the agent's core ofreality. Chances ofreach-
ing the latter depend, first, on physical and technolog-
ical capacities in a particular time and society and, 
second, on the access a particular agent has to such 
means. 
To analyze everyday geographies in a phenomen-
ological perspective indicates that scientific investi-
gation has to put subjects and not primarily spaces, 
regions, or spatiality at its center. Then the question 
is how subjects produce geographies by placing ob-
jects for particular activities and how they maintain 
a certain order of objects by consumption. As Schutz 
and Luckmann show, this can happen and does happen 
in the "secondary zone of inftuence" and with differ-
ent degrees of probabilities "within accessible reach." 
Therefore social geographical research is not just in-
terested in the geography of objects and the subjects in 
the world, but also in how the subjects tie the "world" 
to themselves through their actions of production and 
consumption. 
A seconddomain of everyday social geography con-
cerns the normative-politica! interpretations of zones 
of actions, of territories. Starting points are the body-
centered regionalizations of the front-regions of social 
presentation, i.e., stage, performance, etc., and back-
regions of social hiding, i.e., intimacy, shame, etc., with 
their differentiation with respect to age, sex, sta tus, and 
role. Another form concerns the territorial regulations 
of inclusion and exclusion of actors through property 
rights, politica! or legal definitions ofnation states, and 
citizen rights. These forms of everyday social geogra-
phies are linked to the authoritative control of people 
through territorial means, as "geographies ofpolicing" 
and the specific types of control of the means of vio-
lence. A very important form of making everyday ge-
ographies are the activities of regional and nationalistic 
movements aiming for a new politica! geography, and 
all different forms of regional and national identities 
they are based on. 
Finaliy, a third research area of everyday geography 
is asking how the constitution process of the actor's 
stock ofknowledge is linked to global telecommunica-
tion and how this affects symbolization processes. This 
kind of informational-significational social geography 
is first of ali interested in the conditions of coMMUNICA-
TION, networks, and the "access particular agents have 
to such means." This geography of the distribution of 
in formation has to be differentiated by different means 
and channels of communication (books, newspapers, 
radio, television, data highways, etc.). But this form 
of constitution of the stock of knowledge has to be 
linked to the constitution ofmeaning-content and sym-
bolization processes of different areas of the everyday 
world. 
In this way, a phenomenologicaliy informed and 
action-based social geography reconstructs the every-
day regionalizations ofthe lifeworld and the taken-for-
granted geographical representations of the world by 
subjects.

SOCIOLOGY IN GERMANY 
It was via 
the UNITED STATES that a so-called "phenomenologi-
cal sociology" as an independent theoretical paradigm 
within the social sciences emerged in postwar Ger-
many. Two factors were of major importance. The first 
was the German translation of ALFRED scHuTz's Col-
lected Papers in the early 1970s and the renewal of 
an action-oriented and hermeneutica! tradition also as-
sisted by the German translations of studies like Peter 
Winch's The Jdea of a Social Science ( 1966); Aaron Ci-
courel 's Method and Measurement in Sociology ( 1970) 
and Cognitive Sociology ( 1976); and some articles by 
Harold Garfinkel, as well as Richard J. Bemstein's 
Praxis and Action (1975). 
The second and decisive factor was the transla-
tion ofPETER BERGER and THOMAS LUCKMANN'S The So-
cial Construction of Reality (1966) in 1969. Berger 
and Luckmann inaugurated a synthesis of the sym-
bolic interactionism of George Herbert Mead ( 1863-
1931) and Schutz's phenomenological approach that 
also emerged a little !ater in the United States. In ad-
dition, they referred to the tradition of German PHILO-
SOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY that dominated the intellectua1 
scene between World Wars I and II and featured such 
authors as MAX SCHELER, HELMUTH PLESSNER, Pau] Lud-
wig Landsberg ( 1901-1944 ), ERNST CASSIRER and, ]ater, 
Arnold Gehlen. 
The first independent reception of these develop-
ments can be found in Jurgen Habermas's essay "Zur 
Logik der Sozialwissenschaften" ( 1967), which fo-
cuses on the "problem of understanding meaning in 
the empirical-analytical sciences of action." Under this 
heading Habermas dealt with the phenomenological 
approach exemplified by the works of Abraham Erving 
Kaplan, Cicourel, Schutz, Garfinkel, and Erving Goff-
man, even though he looked with outspoken skepticism 
upon the project of"phenomenological sociology." Out 
ofthis context Ulrich Oevermann and his group devel-
oped the project of a so-called structural or objective 
hermeneutica! approach. 
A second line of reception combined phenomen-
ological and interactionist aspects into a new the-
oretical perspective. This was initiated through two 
textbooks edited by Walter L. Buhl ( Verstehende 
Soziologie, [Interpretive sociology, 1972]) and Heinz 
Steinert (Symbolische Interaktion, 1973) as well as 
through the documentation edited by the research 
group of sociologists at Bielefeld around Joachim 
Matthes and Fritz Schutze. In Alltagswissen, lnter-
aktion, und gesellschaflliche Wirklichkeit (Everyday 
knowledge, interaction, and social reality, 1973) this 
group introduced texts by Garfinkel, Cicourel, and 
GEORGE PSATHAS to a German-speaking audience for 
the first time and thus laid the foundations for the de-
velopment of ethnomethodo1ogical and conversation-
analytical research in Germany. A following volume 
on Kommunikative Sozialforschung (Communicative 
social research, 1976) by the same group gave addi-

tional impetus to research. A 1978 supplement to the 
Kălner Zeitschrift fiir Soziologie und Sozialpsycholo-
gie with the ti tie Materialien zur Soziologie des Alltags 
(Materials for a sociology ofthe everyday) and the an-
thology Alfred Schiitz und die Idee des Alltags in den 
Sozialwissenschaften (Alfred Schutz and the idea of 
the everyday in the social sciences, 1979), edited by 
WALTER SPRONDEL and RICHARD GRATHOFF, documented 
the beginning ofthe professional institutionalization of 
these research perspectives. 
In Germany as well as in the United States the in-
terest in phenomenological research developed in con-
nection with a systematic critique of the general sys-
tems theory ofTalcott Parsons ( 1902-1979). The need 
for new theoretical orientations emerged not only in 
action theory but also in the CRITICAL THEORY of the 
Frankfurt school and in German system theory itself. 
The ongoing development ofNiklas Luhmann 's theory 
of social systems and Habermas's efforts to continue 
the project of a critica! theory of modem societies rely 
implicitly or explicitly on phenomenological concepts, 
e.g., the concepts of TIME and MEANING in Luhmann 's 
Soziale Systeme ( 1984) and the concept of LIFEWORLD 
in Habermas's Theorie des kommunikative Handeln 
(Theory of communicative action, 1981 ). 
The beginning of phenomenologically infiuenced 
studies in German sociology could also rely on a broad 
stream fiowing from PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY and 
phenomenology of sociality between World Wars I and 
Il. These include Theodor Litt, EDITH STEIN, and GERDA 
WALTHER, who developed a phenomenology of soci-
ety in the sense of an ontology of community; Al-
fred Vierkandt, who introduced a phenomenological 
approach as a counter to positivism, and especially 
Max Scheler and Helmuth Plessner. 
The basic motives were defined by the problems of 
classical German sociology. Even though MAX WEBER 
and GEORG SIMMEL understood social reality as an al-
ready meaningfully ordered sociocultural reality and 
declared meaningful actions to be the central topic of 
the social sciences, they did not answer the question 
ofthe social constitution ofmeaning itself. Within this 
basic orientation related to the analysis of- as Max 
Scheler puts it- the "relatively natural attitude" of ev-
eryday life, the socio-phenomenological approaches of 
Scheler, Plessner, and Schutz find their specific profite. 
Max Scheler's philosophical anthropoiogy concen-
trates on the question of the development of social 
identity, on the constitution of social milieus, and on 
the connection of pragmatic and cognitive moments 
in human access to the world. With analytical stress 
on the pre-refiective, emotional, animate, and norma-
tively accentuated constitutive elements of experience 
and the definition of the situation of pragmatic world 
access, his epoch-making contribution illuminated the 
autogenesis of social reality through the plasticity of 
human beings and their world. 
Helmuth Plessner's natural-philosophical and so-
cioanthropological studies presented a constitutive the-
ory of life focusing on the conception of positionality, 
i.e., the relationship ofthe BODY to its confines, which 
leads to an anthropology of sociology on the basis of 
the fundamental axiom of ex-centric positionality. The 
importance of Plessner's writings for the project of 
what is often called "phenomenological sociology of 
everyday life" is illustrated by his preface to the Ger-
man translation ofBerger and Luckmann's The Social 
Construction of Reality. 
Finally, the first major work of the inaugurator 
of a phenomenological foundation of sociology, Al-
fred Schutz's Der sinnhafte Aufbau der sozialen Welt 
(The meaning-structure ofthe social world, 1932), was 
reprinted in Germany in 1960 and 1974. This led to a 
rediscovery of his earlier manuscripts and the dozens 
of essays ofhis American period. The works ofSchutz, 
who can be called the founder of "phenomenological 
sociology," have become most influential in Germany 
within this context ofthe actionist turn in sociologica! 
theory in the 1970s. Subsequent to Max Weber's con-
ception of"understanding" or "interpreti ve" sociology 
and the inclusion ofphilosophical motives of Leibniz, 
HENRI BERGSON, EDMUND HUSSERL, MAX SCHELER, and 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER, Schutz developed an independent 
phenomenological approach to sociologica[ theory. 
Schutz starts from the basic assumption of Husserl 's 
philosophy, according to which every worldview is 
constituted by the way the world is given in the inten-
tiona! acts of consciousness. lf, according to Husserl, 
the meaning of the world, i.e., the constitution of re-
ality, constitutes itself in the intentiona! acts of con-
sciousness, then the constitution of social reality as a 
meaningful interactive context has tobe understood as 
emerging from individual acting. For Schutz this means 
that one has to examine the constitution ofmeaning in 

652 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the realm of mundane sociality. Thus the reception 
of phenomenological motives in sociologica! research 
leads to processes in which rules of social action are 
brought forth by social acting itself. The systematic ex-
amination of everyday reality, considered a meaningful 
result of social action, also ca lis for the development of 
a new sociologica! type oftheory. A constitutive theory 
of social reality has to be conceived by which the au-
togenesis ofbasic processes and structures ofthe life-
world can be grasped. A theory of action has tobe at the 
same time a theory of the lifeworld as well as a theory 
of its action-orienting and action-regulating meaning-
structures, which are produced and reproduced in con-
crete actions. 
The further development of German "phenomen-
ological sociology" owes much to Peter Berger and 
Thomas Luckmann's The Social Construction ofReal-
ity, which can aptly be called a classic. They attempted 
to elaborate Schutz's theory of the pragmatic consti-
tution of the lifeworld in the sense of a sociology of 
knowledge leading to a general theory of social reality 
and society. They applied Schutz's "proto-sociological 
studies" concern ing the structures of the lifeworld to 
the level of everyday life and analyzed the mechanisms 
and forms ofinstitutionalization of social action as well 
as of the legitimation of finite provinces of meaning, 
and were thus able to relate Schutz's basic theoretical 
perspective to central concepts of modern sociologi-
cal theory, such as identity, socialization, social dif-
ferentiation, social roles, language, and knowledge. In 
general, they aimed at an alternative to established so-
ciologica! theories of action. If Schutz's assumption 
that social reality is a product of meaningful and self-
regulated social acting is correct, then it must follow 
that in every given part of any given social interaction 
there are mechanisms identifiable, and in their formal 
aspects describable, by which this self-constitution and 
self-regulation are achieved. The description of these 
mechanisms and their contexts lead to a general theory 
of action that proceeds constitutive-genetically and is 
thus a sociologica! theory ofthe autogenesis ofthe so-
cial world. The common ground ofphenomenological-
sociological approaches is found in stressing both sub-
jective and intersubjective experiencing and acting as 
processes by which meaning is established. 
From a developmental point of view two lines of a 
specifically phenomenological approach can be differ-
entiated. A first line goes back to the works ofThomas 
Luckmann, while a second line, influenced mostly by 
Harold Garfinkel, initiated research in ethnomethodol-
ogy and speech analysis. These stimuli led to a complex 
field of theory and research, which can be roughly di-
vided into two groups: ( 1) studies of theoretical and 
methodological problems and conceptions of theory 
and research in "phenomenological sociology," and (2) 
empirica! fields ofresearch built on a phenomenologi-
cal foundation and concentrating on ethnomethodolog-
ical and ethnographical studies, conversational analy-
sis, biographical research, family sociology, cpistemol-
ogy, and the sociologica! analysis ofreligion. 
(1) Thomas Luckmann, who completed Schutz's 
unfinished last work on the Structures ofthe Life World 
( 1973 and 1984 ), in his own writings develops a pheno-
menological conception of "proto-sociology." He in-
terprets the structures of the lifeworld as a universal 
"matrix," as a mathesis universalis, which serves as 
guide to sociologica! typology and research. This ma-
trix allows a comparison and verification of sociolog-
ica! statements concerning different aspects of the so-
cial world. His empirica! research concentrates on the 
sociology of RELIGION and mainly on the sociology of 
LANGUAGE, in which he examines the structures of ev-
eryday communication and its genres, i.e., structured 
communicative actions as components of the societal 
stock of knowledge (instructions, moral communica-
tion, etc.). Other important studies focus on the prob-
lems of personal identity. 
In contrast to Luckmann, Richard Grathoff attempts 
to find a direct phenomenological access to social real-
ity, developing socio-phenomenology as a phenomen-
ological social theory. It was the edition ofthe Schutz-
Gurwitsch correspondence ( 1985) that triggered his 
approach. Influenced by Schutz's conceptions of typi-
fication and relevance as well as by ARON GURWITSCH's 
concept of miii eu, Grathoff interprets the lifeworld as 
a milieu-world, the meaning-structures of which he 
finds in concrete phenomena like generations or neigh-
borhoods. Thus according to Grathoff, the concept of 
lifeworld includes a dynamic dimension and cannot 
be seen as a formal matrix only, as Luckmann does. 
Grathoff's approach establishes the concept of life-
world as a central sociologica! category, similar to the 
concept of ro le in the 1950s and 1960s. 
The works of Luckmann and of Grathoff mark the 

SOCIOLOGY IN GERMANY 
653 
two poles ofthe relation between phenomenology and 
sociology in Germany. Severa! other authors concen-
trate on its clarification and on methodological ques-
tions within this field. The emphasis ofHANSFRIED KELL-
NER's research is on the constitution of social orders. 
On the philosophical level, Husserl's transcendental 
approach serves him as analytical access to the con-
cept of rule. On the sociologica! Jevel, he is guided 
by Schutz's methodological concepts. He analyzes, for 
example, POSTMODERN constructions of lifestyles and 
the changing cultural dimensions of economic actions 
in late capitalist societies. 
ILJA SRUBAR starts with a reconstruction of Schutz's 
oeuvre on the basis of the unpublished material of his 
estate. He shows that the anthropological dimensions 
of sociality, temporality, and reflexivity and their prag-
matic molding are essential for the constitution of ac-
cess to the human world. On these foundations he at-
tempts to analyze how human acting and interacting 
regulate themselves. 
ULF MATTHIESEN pleads for cooperation between 
phenomenology and Habermas's critica! theory for 
an analysis of the crisis of modern lifeworlds and 
discusses the difference and common grounds of 
socio-phenomenological conceptions ofhermeneutics, 
on the one hand, and Ulrich Oevermann's objective 
hermeneutics, on the other hand, in order to state more 
precisely the methodological conception of what is 
called "Deutungsmusteranalysen." 
THOMAS EBER LE (Switzerland) is the author of a crit-
ica! study on the formation of phenomenological ap-
proaches in sociology. He especially concentrates on 
the further development of Schutz's methodological 
conception and on the examination ofthe influence of 
the Austrian school of ECONOMICS on his methodologi-
cal thinking. 
BURKHARD LEHMANN points OUt the eminent impor-
tance ofthe principle of adequacy of everyday and sci-
entific typifications for the methodology of interpreti ve 
sociology, with critica! reflections on ethnomethod-
ological research strategies. 
The theoretical and empirica! works of HANS-GEORG 
SOEFFNER are devoted to the conception of a social sci-
entific hermeneutics of everyday lifeworlds. His main 
field of research is the conscious and mundane mark-
ings of the meaning-structures of the lifeworld. Thus 
he refers to Husserl 's philosophy, to Schutz's and Gur-
witsch 's sociophenomenological approaches, and to 
Scheler's and Plessner's traditions of PHILOSOPHICAL 
ANTHROPOLOGY. He focuses primarily on symbolic or-
ders in different social milieus, where his works meet 
with the tradition of symbolic interactionism. 
(2) Recent empirica! sociologica] studies in some 
way related to phenomenological foundations are, as 
mentioned, more or less influenced by the works of 
Luckmann and Garfinkel. At least six fields ofresearch 
can be differentiated. 
(a) Conversational analysis and research on so-
cial structures of knowledge and communication. The 
works ofFRITZ SCHUTZE and JORG BERGMANN derive from 
Garfinkel 's impulses as they were taken up by the 
aforementioned research group at Bielefeld. Schtitze 
discusses the philosophical implications of a sociolog-
ica! account of language, and his research is especially 
on the analysis of everyday narratives and on the devel-
opment and application of the technique of "narrative 
interviews." Some ofhis recent empirica! studies focus 
on biographical research. 
Jorg Bergmann, together with Luckmann, studies 
the structure of everyday communication. He views 
the ethnomethodological and conversation-analytical 
methods as instruments by which Schutz's theoreti-
cal outlines, especially his theory of everyday life-
typifications, can be transformed for empirica! re-
search. An example ofhis procedure is Klatsch (Gos-
sip, 1987), a study of gossip as a communicative genre 
of social control. 
Also starting from Luckmann's conception of ev-
eryday communicative structures, Angela Keppler ex-
amines different kinds of talk in contemporary soci-
eties. In her study on Tischgesprăche (Table talk, 1994) 
she draws attention to the sociology of communication 
and offamily sociology. By examples of table talk she 
illustrates the community-building role of everyday 
communications and analyzes the principal communi-
cational forms and mechanisms that play an important 
ro le in the development of the social milieu within a 
family. In this context she makes special reference to 
the ro le of the mass media as "social occasions" for 
the contents of speech and the construction of reality. 
The discussion ofthese occasions in families leads to a 
specific interpretation ofthe families' biographies and 
their everyday lives. 
HUBERT KNOBLAUCH dea]s systematically with the 

654 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
symbolic communicative structures that transform the 
lifeworld into a culturc world, i.e., a "communcative 
lifeworld." With reference to Luckmann's studies of 
communication he tries to show on an empirica] level 
the connection between action and structure within 
structure forming and changing processes of human 
communication, thus supplying the basis for a "the-
ory ofthe communicative construction of cultural con-
texts." 
(b) Sociologica! analysis of religion. In the tradi-
tion of Luckmann's Die Unsichtbare Religion (Invisi-
ble religion, 1 967) and with the help of Schutz's con-
cept oftranscendence, Knoblauch approaches a "social 
ethnography" by studying the social milieus of eso-
teric and new religious movements. Walter Sprondel's 
contribution within this field goes back to his Ger-
man edition of the Schutz-Parsons correspondence in 
1977. Focusing especially on institutionalization pro-
cesses of social reality, Sprondel discusses religious 
conversion as a mechanism of social control of in-
dividual experience and thus as the crucial factor in 
defining religious phenomena, and he pays attention 
to structural effects of cultural modernization through 
such antimodernist protest movements as the German 
"Lebensreform" movement. 
Also to be mentioned are WOLFRAM FISCHER (-
ROSENTHAL)'s earlier studies on problems of profes-
sional identities and institutional career patterns, in-
ftuenced theoretically by Berger and Luckmann and 
methodologically by Fritz Schutze. 
(c) Biographical research. Wolfram Fischer (-
Rosenthal)'s recent interest is in theoretical and 
methodological questions of biographical research-
in the context of which he intends to overcome the 
micro-macro polarity in sociologica] theory- and in 
empirica] studies, some ofwhich are especially located 
in the intersection of biographical research and medi-
cal sociology inftuenced by Anselm Strauss. Here he 
concentrates on examining the constitution of nonlin-
ear biographical time structures in relation to viewing 
chronic illness as a crucial point between everyday rau-
tine and lifespan-projects. His wife Gabriele Rosenthal 
concentrates on the field of historical biographical re-
search and on the analysis of intergenerational relations 
following the tradition of oral history. The principal in-
terest ofbiographical research in times of personal and 
social crises becomes highly visible in her studies of 
German National Socialism, World War Il, and the re-
sulting problems. 
(d) Ethnomethodology and ethnography. In 1980, 
CHRISTA and THOMAS FENGLER presented one ofthe first 
German empirica! ethnomethodological studies, A lltag 
in der Anstalt (Everyday in the institution), in which 
they analyzed the practice of psychiatric treatment in 
order to explain the emergence of the idea of a norma-
tively correct psychiatric therapy within the everyday 
life-processes of its normalization. On the hasis of a 
nineteen month stay in a psychiatric hospital they re-
constructed the processes in which the members of 
this social organization are continuously constituting 
its social order by describing and explaining it. 
Similarly, STEPHAN WOLFF's research centers on the 
question of the rhetorical constitution of social or-
ders. A study under this title in 1976 was based on 
Cicourel 's concept of cognitive sociology and the con-
cept of ethnomethodological analysis, and gave both 
a transcendental turn in order to reach a "theory of 
a priori fundamental mechanisms" of the constitution 
of social experience to sol ve the ethnomethodological 
problems of application and indexicality. A subsequent 
study, Die Produktion von Fiirsorglichkeit (The pro-
duction ofthoughtfulness), concentrated on the scenic 
practices of the construction of social reality with an 
empirica! analysis of the everyday routines of a social 
welfare oftice and the acting of its clients. His mostre-
cent study is about the rhetoric of psychatric experti se 
in court. 
ELISABETH usT works on methodological problems 
of ethnomethodology and on the formulation of a FE:vi-
INIST theory and research on socio-phenomenological 
grounds. She concentrates on showing the implicit but 
always actually present horizon of selfevidences of 
the "mtellectuallandscape ofthe male-stream" and on 
defining the outline of a feminist pattern of conscious 
dissent. 
Jo Reichertz concentrates in his theoretical writings 
on aspects of developmental and conceptual problems 
of the so-called structural or objective hermeneutics. 
In his research he focuses on the question whether 
there is a logica! procedure by which it is possible to 
acquire knowiedge and whether this procedure can be 
methodized. He illustrates these problems by empirica! 
studies done dunng a six month stay with a criminal 
investigation dcpartment. 

SOCIOLOGY IN JAPAN 
655 
In this context the ethnographic and lifeworld-
analytical studies of RONALD HITZLER and ANNE HONER 
can also be taken into account. In the tradition ofBENITA 
LUCKMANN's analysis of The Small Li(e-Worlds of Mod-
ern Man ( 1970), Honer, fac ing the plurality and com-
plexity of modern acting perspectives and quests for 
meaning, searches for the possibilities and problems 
of withdrawal into very small and extremely closed 
provinces of meaning. In his recent studies Hitzler pays 
attention to the conceptualization of a "proto-theory" 
of politica! action. 
(e) With the starting point in the phenomenological 
conception ofmilieu worked out by Scheler and Gur-
witsch, BRUNO HILDENBRAND works on the genesis of 
familial lifeworlds over severa! generations. He is in-
terested in pathological developments, that is, the gen-
esis of and the coping with physical il! ness in the pat-
terns of familial communication and interaction. The 
author refers to studies on phenomenologically ori-
ented PSYCHOLOGY and PSYCHIATRY, especialiy to those 
of LUDWIG BINSWANGER and WOLFGANG BLANKENBURG. 
Another central point of his research is the analysis 
of the consequences of modernization processes in the 
mi !ieu of farmer families. 
Inftuenced by Anselm Strauss and Fritz Schiitze, 
CHRISTA HOFFMANN-RIEM has studied the structural dif-
ferences of everyday processes of reality construction 
and normalization in families with double parenthood. 
She also pays attention to the consequences oftechno-
logical developments for the organization of modern 
family life. 
(f) With reference to Schutz's methodological re-
ftections, KARIN KNORR-CETINA concentrates on empir-
ica! studies of cognitive operations in laboratory sci-
ences, pointing out the transepistemological compo-
nents and transversive alignments of scientific work. 
Some of her recent studies apply to the methodology 
of the variants of constructivism in sociology. 
It needs to be mentioned, finally, that the pheno-
menological approach in German sociology owes other 
important impulses to phenomenological work in psy-
chology and psychiatry (CARL F. GRAUMANN as well as 
BJankenburg) and EDUCATION (KĂTE MEYER-DRAWE).

SOCIOLOGY IN JAPAN 
There are various 
stances in what is broadly called phenomenological so-
ciology. For example, the reflexive sociology of Alvin 
W. Gouldner, the symbolic interactionism of Herbert 
Blumer, and the dramaturgical approach of Erving 
Goffman are sometimes called phenomenological soci-
ology. This is also true in Japan. The term "phenomen-
ological sociology'' will be restricted here to sociology 
that consciously attempts to found itself on insights 
found in phenomenological philosophy. 
There are two eminent sociologists who tried 
to

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ology began from the ideas that the social was an expe-
rienced fact and that the essence of society could only 
be approached through the given in experience. Crit-
icizing the position of GEORG SIMMEL, which searched 
for the fundamental structure of society in mental in-
teraction (die seelische Wechselwirkung), he instead 
posited the "reciprocity ofperspectives" and the "con-
tact circle" as fundamental for society. He analyzed the 
experience of SPACE and TIME from that standpoint and, 
drawing on theoretical insights in THEODOR LITT, con-
structed a theory of social relationship, social group, 
and the whole of society. 
Jisho Usui also sought a firm foundation for so-
ciology in phenomenology. He studied under KITARO 
NISHIDA, the philosopher who introduced phenomen-
ology into JAPAN, and after completing his university 
studies, visited Freiburg and studied under EDMUND 
HUSSERL and MARTIN HEIDEGGER during 1930-32. He 
did this along with GOICHI MIYAKE, a leader of pheno-
menology in Japan, and TOMOO OTAKA, who was AL-
FRED scHuTz's Japanese friend. Usui's main concern 
was with how sociology as a rigorous science is possi-
ble. He began with MAX WEBER's work and in particular 
his notion of ideal type. He was disappointed because 
the criteria of validity for ideal types were rather rel-
ative and ambiguous. He hoped that essences in the 
sense of the EIDETIC METHOD might serve in sociologi-
cal cognition. Taking hints from Heidegger's ontology 
in Sein und Zeit ( 1927), he posited concrete sociohis-
torical beings as the theme of sociology. His accounts 
of social reality in terms of meaning-configurations 
(Sinnzusammenhănge) and the understanding of oth-
ers (Fremdverstehen) drew on works of Husserl and 
can be called phenomenological. 
These early phenomenological sociologies did not 
have far-reaching influence in Japan. Indeed, from the 
beginning of the 1960s through the mid-1970s, most 
leading Japanese sociologists tended to equate socio-
logica! theory with the structural functionalism ofTal-
cott Parsons ( 1902-1979) and oriented almost ali of 
their theoretical concern toward it. 
But a change in theoretical sociology appeared 
in Japan in the mid-1970s. Some sociologists be-
gan to consider phenomenological sociology. For ex-
ample, a symposium entitled, to translate it, "New 
Trends in Contemporary Sociology'' was included in 
the forty-seventh annual meeting of the Japan Socio-
logica! Society in 1974. One of the four presentations 
was "Amerika shakaigaku no doko ~ 
Genshogaku-
teki shakaigaku wo chushin ni" (The trend in Amer-
ica around phenomenological sociology) by Yasuhiro 
Aoki. The next year a symposium ofthe same title in-
cluded a paper entitled "Rikai-shakaigaku no seiritsu-
tenkai to genshogaku" (The origin and development 
of verstehende Soziologie and phenomenology) by 
Teruyoshi U gai. Both of these presentations sketched 
aspects of Alfred Schutz. Since then, phenomenologi-
cal sociology has been almost entirely identified with 
the Schutzian perspective of CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMEN-
OLOGY OF THE NATURAL ATTITUDE. "New trends" con-
noted altematives to Parsonian structural functional-
ism, and phenomenological sociology in Japan, as in 
SOCIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES, was one such trend. 
From that time, the number of papers referring to 
works of Schutz read at the annual meetings of the 
Japan Sociologica! Society has gradually increased. 
The first Schutz session was held at the fiftieth an-
nual meeting in 1977 and one or two have been held 
every year, except 1982, until 1987. Then for severa! 
years there were Schutzian approaches presented in 
sessions on such topics as communication, discrim-
ination, and FEMINISM, and then Schutz sessions each 
year since 1992. As regards publications, many articles 
were published between the mid-1970s and the early 
1980s by those who had been presenting papers and 
became the leaders ofthe phenomenological sociology 
movement in Japan: YUMIKO EHARA, HIDEO HAMA, MASA-
TATAKA KATAG!Rl, HISASHI NASU, KAZUHISA NISHIHARA, HI-
ROSHI OGAWA, HIROSHI SAKURAI, and YOSHIKUNI YATANI. 
They may be called Schutzian sociologists of the first 
generation. Other sociologists, who had begun in other 
theoretical perspectives, e.g., those of Parsons, We-
ber, or CRITICAL THEORY, also wrote about Schutzian 
SOcioJogy: YOSHIKAZU SATO, YOSHIYUKI SATO, NAOHARU 
SHIMODA, TAKESHI YAMAGISHI, and SETSUO YAMAGUC'HI. 
Their topics included rationality, understanding, 
motivation, ACTION, objective and subjective meaning, 
and the everyday intersubjective lifeworld. The works 
ofSchutz were used to establish one ofthe bridgeheads 
for a "paradigm revolution" in which the sociologica! 
enterprise seeks to break through the "over-socialized" 
conception ofhumanity (Denis Wrong), the "static and 
conservative conception of society," and "methodolog-
ical dualism" (Alvin Gouldner), which were consid-

ered inherent in Parsonian structural functionalism. A 
new phase in Japanese sociology was ushered in. 
Scholars who were not sociologists also became in-
terested in phenomenological sociology. A book by an 
eminent ETHNOLOGIST, MASAO YAMAGUCHI, discussed the 
relationship between centrality and marginality from 
the perspective ofSchutz's multiple realities; an article 
by the POLITICAL SCIENTIST KAZUHIKU OKUDA surveyed 
the new trends in North American sociology in detail; 
an article by an EDUCATION theorist, TAKESHI ISHIGURO, 
examined Schutz's methodology ofthe social sciences; 
and a book by an ethicist, ISAMU NAGAMI, dealt, on the 
basis of Schutz, with the relationship between soci-
ety and knowledge. These publications brought more 
attention to Schutz. 
There is no doubt that translations ha ve contributed 
to the spread ofphenomenological sociology in Japan. 
Part two of Schutz's Collected Papers l (1962) was 
translated by SHOZO FUKATANI in 1974 and "Concept 
and Theory Formation in the Social Sciences" and 
"The Problem of Rationality in the Social Sciences" 
were translated in anthologies by Kiyoshi Matsui the 
same year. "The Stranger" was trans1ated by Shizuya 
Okazawa in 1977. In 1980 part two of Schutz's Col-
lected Papers Il ( 1964) was trans1ated by Atsushi Saku-
rai and HELMUT WAGNER's anthology of Schutz texts, 
On Phenomenology and Social Relations ( 1970), was 
translated by Makio Morikawa and HIDEO HAMA. The 
Theory of Social Action and Der sinnhafie Aufbau 
der sozialen Welt (The meaning-structure of the so-
cial world, 1932) were translated by YOSHIKAZU SATO 
in 1980 and 1982. Re.fiections on the Problem of Rele-
van ce was translated by HISASHI NASU, HIDEO HAMA, CHIE 
!MAI, and MASAKATSU IRIE in 1995. finally, the project 
of a complete translation of the Collected Papers by 
HIKARU WATABE, HISASHI NASU, and KAZUHISA NISHIHARA 
produced volumes one and two in 1983, 1985, and 
1991. 
Against this background, the Genshogaku-teki 
Shakaigaku Kenkyu-kai (The Society for Research in 
Phenomenological Sociology), organized by younger 
sociologists, held its first meeting in 1980 and has 
met to discuss members' research once or twice a 
year since. In December 1983 Nihon genshogaku 
shakaikagaku-kai (The Japan Society for Phenomen-
ology and the Social Sciences) was organized so that 
philosophers and social scientists of the older and 
younger generations with a common standpoint might 
meet to discuss topics of common interest. The annual 
meeting has held multidisciplinary symposia on inter-
subjectivity ( 1984 ), everydayness ( 1985), manners and 
customs (1986), symbols (1987), rationality (1988), 
power ( 1989), communality ( 1990), system ( 1991 ), 
discrimination ( 1992), information ( 1993), relativism 
(1994), and sound (1995). 
There are various developments in the current situ-
ation of phenomenological sociology in Japan. Some 
Japanese scholars ha ve visited GERMANY, the UNITED 
STATES, and CANADA for discussions or study under lead-
ing scholars: RICHARD GRATHOFF (Bielefeld), lUA SRUBAR 
(Konstanz), LESTER EMBREE (Fiorida Atlantic Univer-
sity), MAURICE NATANSON (Yale University), GEORGE 
PSATHAS (Boston University), JOHN o'NEILL (York Uni-
versity), and JOSE HUERTAS-JOURDA (Wilfred Laurier 
University). The number of sociologists interested 
in it is also increasing, largely because the above-
mentioned Schutzian sociologists of the first genera-
tion have taught phenomenological sociology at vari-
ous universities and interested graduate students in it. 
The developments ha ve taken, generally speaking, four 
directions. 
(1) Schutz's works are being closely examined, his 
perspectives are being elaborated and philosophical 
and sociologica! possibilities are being pursued. Top-
ics here include action, choosing among projects, in-
order-to- and because-motives, multiple realities, typi-
fication, reification, relevance, the everyday lifeworld, 
and the relationship between subjectivity and objectiv-
ity. 
(2) Schutz's perspectives are being introduced into 
wider contexts by philosophers and sociologists and 
related to the perspectives of Weber, Husserl, Jiirgen 
Habermas, Niklas Luhmann, symbolic interactionism, 
ethnomethodology, and HERMENEUTICS and also the his-
torical circumstances in the Vienna of the 1920s and 
the sociologica! trends in the United States in the 1960s 
and 1970s. 
(3) Some sociologists are trying to introduce 
Schutzian perspectives for rather empirica! topics such 
as anonymity, discrimination, privatization, organi-
zations, social movements, and so forth. These at-
tempts concern themselves with phenomena that were 
long taken for granted before being considered from 
Schutzian viewpoints. 

658 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
(4) Finally, many studies in ethnomethodology 
should be mentioned. It attracted the attention of 
Japanese sociologists in the mid-1970s. It was ini-
tially spoken of together with Schutzian phenomen-
ology, symbolic interactionism, and the Goffmanian 
perspective, i.e., as one of the new complex trends 
in American sociology, and the connections between 
ethnomethodology and Schutz were emphasized. 
From about the middle ofthe 1980s, however, some 
younger sociologists have gradually come to focus 
on the phases of ethnomethodology as a perspective 
sui generis, especially the perspective called conver-
sational analysis, and to emphasize the differences 
as well as the similarities of Schutzian phenomen-
ological sociology and ethnomethodology. Articles and 
books have been written and translated. Empirica! re-
search has been conducted into sexism, discrimina-
tion, wheelchair users, psychotherapy activities, daily 
conversation, television news, space cognition, etc. 
The following sociologists belong to this group: Yu-
taka Kitazawa, Aug Nishizaka, Nobuo Shiino, Tomiaki 
Yamada, Keiichi Yamazaki, and Hiroaki Yoshii. The 
Esunomesodoroji-Kaiwa Bunseki Kenkyuakai (Soci-
ety for Research in Ethnomethodology and Conversa-
tional Analysis) includes not only social scientists but 
also natural scientists, and has met since 1993. 
Currently, most ethnomethodologists are not inter-
ested in phenomenology. But if their interest in the 
taken-for-granted assumptions of everyday activities 
and their emphasis on reflexivity in accounting for 
practices are considered, ethnomethodology is stil! a 
practice inspired by phenomenology.

SOCIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES 
The 
influence of phenomenology on sociology in CANADA 
and the UNITED STATES has been extensive, although its 
effects are not always readily apparent. (Phenomen-
ological sociology is ied in GREAT BRITAIN by MAURICE 
ROCHE, MICHAEL PHILLIPSON, and DAVID SILVERMAN). Ma-
jor postpositivist currents in the development of so-
ciology in the latter half of this century have been 
influenced by EDMUND HUSSERL (via ALFRED SCHUTZ), 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, and MARTIN HEIDEGGER. 
Important precedents to these developments may be 
found in the work of European sociologists and Ameri-
can philosophers, psychologists, and sociologists. MAX 
WEBER, whose influence on sociology has been exten-
sive and pervasive, had defined the disciplinary enter-
prise as concemed with the interpreti ve understanding 
of social action. His interest in the subjective dimen-
sion, his use of the method of ideal types, and his con-
tinued focus on understanding (verstehen) provided a 
strong sociologica! underpinning for !ater scholars such 
as Schutz, who sought more explicitly to incorporate 
the phenomenological insights of Husserl. GEORG SIM-
MEL developed a "formal sociology'' focused on the 
study of forms of sociation and examined the partic-
ulars of situations and their contents in order to dis-
ceru those structures that underlay the particularities, 
a quest that parallels the EIDETIC METHOD ofphenomen-
ology. Karl Mannheim ( 1893-194 7), a former student 
of Husserl, contributed much to the development of 
a sociology of knowledge. He not only showed the 
significance of the subjective dimension of sociallife 
-
the ways in which institutions and social structures 
provide frameworks for intellectual life and activity 
-
but also focused on individual activities as these 
are part of and comprise group, class, or collectively 
expressed thought. 
MAX SCHELER contributed important phenomen-
ological insights in such areas as the sociology of 
knowledge, EMOTIONS, VALUE THEORY, and RELIGION. His 
studies of the nature of sympathy and ressentiment are 
among the most widely known ofhis works. However, 
despite his significant contributions, his ideas and ap-
proaches have not affected or been incorporated into 
phenomenological sociology in the United States. 
In the United States and under the influence of 
WILLIAM JAMES among others, Charles Cooley (1864-
1929), W. I. Thomas (1863-1947), and George Her-
bert Mead ( 1863-1931) ali saw society as a process, 
the individual and society as closely interrelated, and 
the subjective aspect of human behavior as a neces-
sary part of the process of the formation and dynamic 
maintenance of the social self and the social group. 
Mead's theorizings in particular contributed to a view 
of the self as a reflexive process and of the human be-
ing as an active, interpreting, symbol-using, and self-
interacting socialized being. Since ACTION is ongoingly 
constructed by persons, their meanings and ideas must 
be understood since these are actively involved in so-
cial interaction. Society was also conceptualized as a 
process by Mead, group life being constructed from the 
meaningful actions of individuals. Institutions, roles, 
statuses, organizations, norms, and values were consid-
ered as developing and reciprocally influencing those 
engaged in their construction and maintenance. The 
methodological significance of these views was that 
the actor's perspective, meanings, and ideas were to 
be considered seriously in order to understand human 
action. 
Alfred Schutz, a philosopher and social scientist 
trained in Austria and familiar with Husserl's pheno-
menology, was the central figure in the development 
and influence of phenomenology on sociology. He 
sought to clarify the significance of Husserl 's thought 
for sociology and for the philosophy of the social or 
HUMAN SCIENCES. His Der sinnhafle Aujbau der sozialen 
Welt (The meaning-structure ofthe social world, 1932) 
represented an effort phenomenologically to expand 
and clarify Weber's interest in the subjective dimen-
sion. Schutz's most important contributions focused 
on the description and analysis of the essential fea-
tures of the WORLD of everyday life; on discovering 
the presuppositions, structures, and significations of 
that world; and on the realization of a CONSTITUTIVE 
PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE NATURAL ATTITUDE. Among his

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
many interests, besides the theory of action, were the 
study ofthe intersubjective world of everyday life (the 
lifeworld), the study of commonsense knowledge, the 
significance ofLANGUAGE in the sedimentation ofmean-
ings and in the processes oftypification, the problems 
of multiple realities, and the methodological problems 
of the human sciences. 
Those whom Schutz infiuenced in sociology during 
his teaching at the New School for Social Research 
include PETER BERGER, THOMAS LUCKMANN, and HELMUT 
R. WAGNER. KURT WOLFF a[so advanced Schutz's ideas, 
particularly in the sociology of knowledge. Wagner 
became a major American expositor as well as biogra-
pher of Schutz. He wrote extensively on themes from 
Schutz and undertook to elaborate the Schutzian per-
spective. His own work sets out in lucid fashion the 
major points in phenomenology and their relation to 
psychology and sociology while drawing extensively 
on Schutz's conceptualizations. 
Schutz's dominant influence on American sociol-
ogy was mediated by the incorporation of many of 
his key ideas in Berger and Luckmann 's The Social 
Construction of Reality ( 1966). Berger's own promi-
nence as a sociologist of religion as well as a social 
theorist with a broad humanistic perspective attracted 
many younger sociologists to his ideas as well as to 
those of Schutz. In Germany Luckmann continued to 
advance Schutz's ideas in his subsequent writings and 
completed the final Schutz manuscript. 
A major approach in American social science 
known as "social constructionism" has taken its name 
from the Berger and Luckmann volume, although most 
of its practitioners do not see themselves either as phe-
nomenologists oras Schutz scholars. Nevertheless, as 
an approach, it is oriented to the subjective dimen-
sion of human activities by considering the ways in 
which human actors construct MEANINGs in everyday 
situations. Its practitioners use qualitative methodolo-
gies such as interviews, field studies, case studies, and 
narrative analysis as well as developing interpretive 
analyses of the meaning( s) of social actions, situations, 
and organizations. In fact, the approach has gained a 
major foothold in the study of social problems and so-
cial problems theory, replacing the "labelling theory" 
perspective, although derivative from it to some de-
gree. "Social constructionism" has also affected some 
theorists associated with symbolic interactionism (the 
sociologica! approach most directly related to Cooley, 
Thomas, and Mead). Some of its most recent inter-
preters have borrowed from Heidegger, HANS-GEORG 
GADAMER, and PAUL RICCEUR in the effort to introduce the 
perspectives of HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY into 
sociology. 
Kurt Wolff, who was trained in Europe but has 
taught in the United States since the 1940s, has made 
many original contributions to phenomenological the-
ory and method as well as to the sociology of knowl-
edge. Infiuenced by Mannheim as well as Schutz, he 
developed the phenomenological approach of"surren-
der" (total involvement, suspension of received no-
tions, pertinence of everything, identification, and risk 
of being hurt) and "catch" (the cognitive or existen-
tial result, yield, or harvest of surrender, the begin-
ning, new conceiving, or new conceptualizing that it 
is). Wolff's field research has provided insights into 
the ways in which this theoretical and methodologi-
cal approach can be incorporated in descriptions and 
reflections about lived experience. His !ater writings 
ha ve added a concern for the crisis of Western cu !ture, 
a macropolitical, economic, ecologica!, and cultural 
crisis, a concern that is penetrated by his own recall 
of the horrific Nazi years. The recovery of meaning 
and concern is possible through such means as surren-
der and catch and the direct confrontation of our lived 
circumstances in their historical moments. 
GEORGE PSATHAS actively relates Schutz's pheno-
menological sociology to developments in eth-
nomethodology. Since his first edited volume, Pheno-
menological Sociology ( 1973 ), which introduced many 
American sociologists to the work of severa! Schutzian 
scholars (RICHARD M. ZANER, Wagner, Wo!ff, and EGON 
BITTNER, among others ), he has continued to teach and 
publish in phenomenology, to organize conferences in 
ethnomethodology, to co-found the Society for Pheno-
menology and the Human Sciences in 1981, and also to 
found, in 1979, an international quarterly journal, Hu-
man Studies, which is devoted to phenomenological 
approaches in the human sciences. Psathas's approach, 
influenced by Mead, Schutz, and Garfinkel, has been 
to focus on questions ofhow the lifeworld is organized 
and how social order is ongoingly produced, and to ad-
dress these interests in empirica! studies oflifeworldly 
phenomena ranging from social psychological exper-
iments in the laboratory and observations of mobility 

SOC!OLOGY IN THE UN!TED STATES 
661 
and orientation among blind travelers to interaction-
ally produced sets of travel directions. His critiques 
of Schutz ha ve focused on the static and nontemporal 
character of Schutz's studies, on his emphasis on sed-
imented meanings rather than on the ongoing emer-
gence of meaning in interaction, and on his concern 
with the description of structures in the lifeworld rather 
than with the production ofthe sense of social structure 
for persons operating in the natural attitude. 
At Boston University, Psathas (with VICTOR KESTEN-
BAUM and ERAZIM KOHĂK in phiJosophy) and JeffCouJ-
ter (and Michael Lynch in recent years) in sociology 
have influenced a number of students who have con-
tinued to teach and research in both phenomenologi-
cal sociology and ethnomethodology; these include 
FRANCES WAKSLER, JAMES OSTROW, ANN RAWLS, DAVID 
BOGEN, and DUSAN BJELIC. The International Institute 
for Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysism 
begun at Boston University by Psathas and Coulter, 
has sponsored conferences since 1975 and developed 
a publishing program in 1990. 
Ethnomethodology is frequently cited as one of 
the post-Schutzian evolutions of phenomenology. Its 
founder, HAROLD GARFINKEL, can be shown to have 
retained a phenomenological foundation, evolving 
from an interest in Husserlian phenomenology and 
ARON GURWITSCH's phenomenoJogicaJ PSYCHOLOGY to 
Schutz's phenomenology ofthe lifeworld, to Merleau-
Ponty's studies of the lived BODY, and to Heidegger's 
HERMENEUTics. His penetrating analyses of the signif-
icance of the taken-for-granted assumptions operative 
in the world of everyday life and the natural attitude, 
together with the use of "breaching experiments" for 
their discovery, and his explication of the methodical 
practices of participants in everyday life have shown 
how phenomenologically oriented research on practi-
ca! reasoning and practica! actions can be conducted. 
As Garfinkel states in Studies in Ethnomethodol-
ogy ( 1967), the aims of ethnomethodology are to dis-
cover, describe, and analyze "the how it [society] gets 
put together; the how it is getting done; the how to 
do it; the social structures of everyday activities ... 
studying how persons, as parties to ordinary arrange-
ments, use the features of the arrangement to make 
for members the visibly organized characteristics hap-
pen." These would include ali methods of practica! 
reasoning, methods of interpreting, methods of corn-
municating, methods of interacting, and methods of 
accomplishing ali manner of practica! activities in the 
world of everyday life. Since many of these practices 
are repeated and patterned, their methodical charac-
ter, their orderliness and their organization, can be 
discovered and described. Garfinkel's writings have 
combined critica! refiections on sociologica! theories 
and methods; the formulation of program policies to 
guide ethnomethodological studies; and the con duct of 
a variety of empirica! studies ranging from how jurors 
decide on the "correctness" of a verdict; how a trans-
sexual, born male, passed as female and convinced 
others of the necessity of a sex change operation; to 
the discovering practices of astrophysicists. 
Among the major concepts of ethnomethodology 
are indexicality and refiexivity. Indexicality refers to 
the fact that for members of a group, the meaning 
of what they say and do is dependent on the context 
in which their doing and saying occurs and, signifi-
cantly for the human sciences, such indexicality cannot 
be remedied by developing standardized or idealized 
conceptualizations. Refiexivity refers to the fact that 
for members, the features of society are produced by 
persons' motivated compliance with background ex-
pectancies, i.e., with commonsense knowledge of the 
features of society. There is thus a reflexive relation 
between the "facts" about society and the ways that 
members use practica! reasoning and commonsense 
knowledge to depict society. 
In contrast to Schutz, ethnomethodology makes 
commonsense knowledge and commonsense under-
standings topics for study in order to learn how these 
may be used in the accomplishment of everyday ac-
tivities. For ethnomethodology, knowledge and under-
standing can be studied directly, considered not as men-
talistic phenomena and inaccessible, but as practically 
demonstrated in the ongoing actions and accomplish-
ments of members, in the ways that they are produced 
and achieve their recognition and visibility for mem-
bers. Garfinkel's starting point is not consciousness, 
but practica! action in the lifeworld. 
The works of Garfinkel himself and his closest stu-
dents and associates, e.g., Harvey Sacks, EGON BIT-
TNER, David Sudnow, D. Laurence Wieder, Kenneth 
Liberman, Eric Livingston, Mic haei Lynch, and David 
Goode demonstrate the breadth and depth of pheno-
menological and ethnomethodological ideas and per-

662 
ENCYCLOPEDJA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
spectives. Sudnow, drawing on Merleau-Ponty's ap-
proach to the lived body, has produced a remarkable 
study of embodied actions in the work of the hands at 
the keyboards of the piano and the typewriter. Liber-
man has studied "understanding" as an interactional 
achievement, examining Australian aborigines' rea-
soning practices as well as those of Tibetan monks. 
Goode has studied the lived experience of deaf-blind 
children and the ways in which they achieve com-
munication in contexted relations with others. Lynch 
has studied the discovering practices of astrophysicists 
and the laboratory practices of microbiologists. He 
has contributed to the development of a research per-
spective characterized as "social studies of science," 
an approach heavily influenced by ethnomethodology. 
Coulter has traced the relevance of the philosophy of 
LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN for ethnomethodo]ogy, an inter-
est that Lynch has also pursued. Wieder has contributed 
studies ofthe reasoning practices ofmembers in every-
day situations ranging from the residents of a halfway 
house and their telling of the code (i.e., the uses of 
"norms" in the organization of accounts of action) to 
the artful practices of magicians and to the interac-
tional production and interpretation ofthe meaning of 
the behavior of chimpanzees by their trainers and by 
animal researchers. 
Other sociologists influenced by ethnomethodology 
and by phenomenology include MELVIN POLLNER (who 
studied practica! reasoning in theoretical and applied 
work), EGON BITTNER (with theoretical work and ap-
plied studies ofthe po]ice), DOROTHY SMITH, and JAMES 
HEAP, among others. Smith moved from her early read-
ings of Schutz and Merleau-Ponty to an active en-
gagement with elements of Marxist and ethnomethod-
ological perspectives. She developed what she calls a 
sociology for women, which is grounded in women's 
experience and which begins with the study of concrete 
actions of persons engaged in concerted social rela-
tions. Her early dissatisfaction with Schutz's greater 
emphasis on the cognitive and her active incorpora-
tion of feeling and lived experience has resulted in 
a feminist perspective that is, in large part, grounded 
in phenomenology. Her work shows the importance 
of connecting the experientiallevel to extended social 
re]ations at the macro-]evel. LOUISE LEVESQUE-LOPMAN 
also relates Schutz's thought to FEMINISM. 
JAMES HEAP has combined interests in phenomen-
ology and ethnomethodology to focus on the meaning 
of action as constrained by what language makes pos-
sible. He has also developed ethnomethodology in an 
applied direction in empirica! studies of READING and 
writing in instructional settings in education. His in-
terest is in the study of culturally possible ways in 
which activities can be done and with how actions are 
organizable such that they can be recognizable and in-
telligible. 
EDWARD ROSE represents another sociologica! blend-
ing ofphenomenological and ethnomethodological in-
terests. His studies and !ater writings, including The 
Werald (1992), demonstrate a unique and perceptive 
approach that is historical, etymological, textual, and 
analytic with a focus on the study ofworldly order, the 
everyday lifeworldly actions ofpersons. 
JOHN o'NEILL has been a major contributor for over 
two decades to a variety of phenomenologically in-
formed studies and writings in sociology. He at first 
devoted his attention to the philosophy of the so-
cial sciences and pursued both the Frankfurt school 
of CRITICAL THEORY and phenomenology in their fo-
cus on the problem of the complementarity between 
causal and hermeneutica! explanations. Both as trans-
lator and expositor of his views on politics, history, 
Janguage, and art he has specialized in the work of 
Merleau-Ponty. He has also concentrated on interdis-
ciplinary studies in MARXISM, phenomenology, and eth-
nomethodology. In more recent years his research has 
explored problems in politica! economy and the semi-
ology of embodiment, and, following the linguistic turn 
and Wittgensteinian philosophy, he has also studied 
the theory oftextuality and discourse production, con-
sidering phenomenological, STRUCTURALIST, and POST-
MODERN theories of discourse production and intertex-
tuality. In his position at York University O'Neill co-
founded a graduate program that has continued to focus 
on, among other approaches, Continental thought; he 
has been instrumental in the formation of the journal 
Philosophy of the Social Sciences; and he has edited 
a book series, the International Library of Phenomen-
ology and Moral Sciences. In these va:rious activities he 
has contributed to advances in phenomenological ap-
proaches in sociology and his wide-ranging scholarship 
and intellectual vigor has influenced many students. 
A number of other scholars ha ve produced a corpus 
of works that reflects ongoing interest in phenomen-

SOMATICS 
663 
ological themes. These include PETER MANNING in his 
fieldwork studies ofthe police and in his effort to link 
semiotics and fieldwork; MARIANNE PA GET for studies of 
communicative practices ofphysicians as well as fem-
inist studies ofwomen artists; RON SILVERS and VIVIAN 
DARROCH-LOZOWSKI, whose visual and reflexive studies 
are phenomenoJogicaJ; KENNETH MORRISON and PETER 
EGLIN, who have engaged in textual studies; JACK KATZ 
in methodology and criminology; and GISELA HINKLE, 
BURKHARDT HOLZNER, and MARY ROGERS who ha ve made 
various theoretical contributions. 
The issues confronting sociologists who continue 
to retain a connection to phenomenology are how to 
pursue their studies of social phenomena and connect to 
the broader and larger-scale interests ofthe sociologica! 
mainstream. The development of ethnomethodology 
has attracted a number of researchers as an approach 
that offers both rigor and theoretical acumen in the 
pursuit of studies of Iifeworldly actions by members 
of society. However, the interweaving of the various 
themes raised by phenomenology into the fabric of 
empirica! sociology in the United States has not as 
yet produced coherent "schools" of thought based on 
phenomenology.

SOMATICS 
Encounters between phenomenology 
and the body- and movement-centered approaches col-
lectively known as "somatics" can best be understood 
by recognizing that phenomenology and somatics are 
contemporaries within a broader historical and cultural 
context characterized by a new type of focus on the 
BODY appearing in the !ater 19th and early 20th cen-
turies in Europe and North America. Here the body is 
no longer exclusively conceived as a physical object

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
opposed to a disembodied mind, but is increasingly rec-
ognized as subjective, expressive, and primordial. For 
example, while EDMUND HUSSERL emphasized the fun-
damental role ofkinaesthesis as early as 1907 in a !ee-
ture course concerning the perception ofthings in space 
(now published under the ti tie Ding und Raum ), educa-
tors such as Emile Jaques Dalcroze (1865-1950) and 
Rudolf Laban ( 1879-1958) as well as modern dancers 
such as Isadora Dune an ( 1878-1927) and Mary Wig-
man (1886-1973) were pursuing novel movement ex-
plorations of their own during the same period. That 
early phenomenologists were not altogether isolated 
from new trends in the DANCE, PHYSICAL EDUCATION, 
and general physical cu !ture movement of their time 
is suggested by MORITZ GEIGER 's use of the notion of 
"Eurhythmie" in o ne of the essays in his Zugănge zur 
Asthetik (Approaches to aesthetics, 1928), where eu-
rhythmy is presented as the foundation for ali artistic 
form; the word is perhaps most closely associated with 
Dalcroze, who was already working out his principles 
of eurhythmics as applied to music and movement by 
the turn ofthe century at the Geneva Conservatory (and 
whose college of eurhythmy was established at the ex-
perimental community ofHellerau, outside Dresden, in 
191 0), but the term was also used by Laban during the 
1920s with reference to dance movement and appears 
in the works of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) as well. 
In fact, as cultural historian Hillel Schwartz has sug-
gested, the 20th century itself has been characterized 
by a new appreciation for the kinaesthetic dimension 
in many areas oflife, notjust in specific disciplines ad-
dressing it directly. Thus phenomenology is not only 
-
as HERBERT SPIEGELBERG has pointed OUt -
part of 
a larger historical turn to immediate experience, in its 
full range and richness, but is also situated in a cultural 
milieu in which new experientially-grounded bodily 
practices (as well as new ways oftheorizing about the 
living, moving body) have emerged. 
The field of somatics embraces a great number of 
such bodily based educational and therapeutic prac-
tices, including various "body work" and "body aware-
ness" approaches. Though its full history has yet to be 
written -
especially regarding its 19th century roots 
-
it is often associated with the names of such pi-
oneers as Frederick Mathias Alexander ( 1869-1955), 
Elsa Gindler (1885-1961 ), Ida Rolf (1896-1979), and 
Moshe Feldenkrais ( 1904-1984); it also includes body-
centered practices developed in the 20th century by 
many other individuals, along with such approaches as 
biofeedback, sensory integration, and dan ce and move-
ment therapy. Moreover, it embraces such traditions as 
yoga, martial arts, and massage, each of which has a 
Jengthy history of its own. Yet somatics owes its rela-
tively recent emergence as a field or discipline (rather 
than a mere collection of competing "marginal" or "al-
ternative" practices) to the work in EXISTENTIAL PHENO-
MENOLOGY ofTHOMAS HANNA, and phenomenoJogy not 
only played a key ro le in its inception, but continues to 
contribute to its development, offering critica! reflec-
tions on its assumptions as well as eidetic descriptions, 
and constitutive and genetic analyses, concerning the 
"matters themselves" proper to the field. 
Hanna's establishment of the field may be seen as 
comprising two phases. (1) In articles published in the 
late 1960s and the early 1970s, and in Bodies in Re-
voit ( 1970), he retrieves the old term "somatology" as 
a title for a new HUMAN SCIENTIFIC multidiscipline that 
would draw on the one hand from such fields as evo-
lutionary biology, ethology, and developmental psy-
chology, while on the other hand also incorporating 
the phenomenological notion ofbodily subjectivity, as 
well as an existential concern for human freedom. Al-
though he was not aware of it at the time, his project 
echoes Husserl 's own proposal, in Ideen zu einer reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologischen Philoso-
phie III [ 1912], for a "somatology" that would combine 
research in such natural sciences as physiology with the 
direct somatie perception that each researcher has, ex-
perientially, only with regard to his or her own lived 
body. Hanna's somatology is nondualistic in severa! 
ways: it explicitly accomodates both scientific, third-
person knowledge and experiential, first-person knowl-
edge without requiring either ofthese tobe assimilated 
to the other; it takes into account both the evolution-
ary adaptation of an organism to its environment and 
the existential adaptations roade possible by human 
awareness, autonomy, and Jearning; and it moves res-
olutely beyond mind-body dualisms by focusing upon 
the soma, which in earlier formulations is defined as 
an organic whole or process comprising many inter-
articulating "mental" and "physical" functions. In that 
Hanna's somatology is concerned not only with habit-
ual, "acquired" kinaesthetic patterns but also with an 
instinctual substratum of somatie life, it also converges 

SOMATICS 
665 
with the !ater Husserl 's investigations of Triebinten-
tionalităt, as well as with MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY's 
analyses of an anonymous, pre-personal "motor inten-
tionality" in Phenomimologie de la perception ( 1945). 
And Hanna 's detailed treatment of upright posture in 
The Body of Life ( 1980)- including its frontal orien-
tation, its possibilites of lateral manipulation, and its 
temporal coordination -
is reminiscent of ERWIN w. 
STRAUS 's work on similar themes in, for instance, "Die 
aufrechte Haltung" ( 1949). 
(2) Though Hanna's earlier works made use ofthe 
adjective "somatie" (a term also found in Husserl, 
Merleau-Ponty, and ARON ouRwnscH), he coined the 
noun "somatics" in a 1976 essay, "The Field of Somat-
ies," appearing in the first issue ofajoumal ofthe same 
name. By including essays and book reviews devoted to 
the many body-centered practices making up the field, 
this joumal brought diverse approaches together in a 
common context or forum, and although not all prac-
titioners necessarily agreed with Hanna's own project 
of somatology, they rapidly carne to see themselves 
as members of a common field called somatics. Dur-
ing Hanna's years as editor of Somatics (1976-90), not 
only did the joumal publish a number of essays in or 
referring to phenomenology, but Hanna himself grad-
ually refined the notion of the soma to emphasize the 
phenomenological roots of the concept, culminating 
in a definition of the soma as "the body experienced 
from within" -
which recalls the phenomenological 
concept of"lived body" (Leib). 
Though some somatie practices rely on metaphysi-
cal frameworks from various world traditions and oth-
ers are associated with various schools of psychother-
apy, the most common framework is NATURALISM; for 
instance, practices may be explained and justified in 
terms ofthe way neurological activity controls muscu-
lar activity. There is also a tendency toward what Don 
H. Johnson terms "somatie Platonism"- comparing 
all individual bodies to some abstract ideal image or 
model of the body and seeing bodies only through the 
grid of assumptions that this paradigm entails. Never-
theless, some somatie practitioners have become ac-
tively interested in phenomenological discourse as a 
way of giving voi ce to the rich nuances oflived bodily 
experience their work elicits, while others tind eidetic 
phenomenology a useful tool in exploring similarities 
and differences among various somatie approaches. 
Still others make use of phenomenological concepts in 
their theoretical writings and/or cite phenomenological 
works among their sources. In addition, ELIZABETH A. 
BEHNKE is conducting a series of phenomenological in-
vestigations of somatie practice. Thus phenomenologi-
cal work continues to contribute to theory and research 
in the field of somatics. Furthermore, in addition to his 
important contributions to somatie theory, EUGENE T. 
GENDLIN 's development of the notion of a bodily "felt 
sense" in Focusing (1978; rev. ed. 1981) and other 
works is a classic example of an outstanding contribu-
tion by a phenomenologist to practica! somatie educa-
tion. Another indication of interchange between these 
fields is found in the fact that on severa! occasions, per-
sons trained in or familiar with phenomenology have 
left the world of academic philosophy to become full-
time somatie practitioners. And during the 1980s, two 
graduate programs in somatics emerged, one directed 
by SEYMOUR KLEINMAN at The Ohio State University and 
the other by Don Hanlon Johnson, whose program is 
currently located at the California Institute of Integral 
Studies in San Francisco; both programs draw upon 
the phenomenological tradition in various ways. 
However, in addition to the influences ofphenomen-
ology upon somatics, it is also possible to see somatics 
as contributing to phenomenology- in part because 
in some respects, they are kindred movements or tra-
ditions. For example, many phenomenologists have 
pointed out that as we go about our daily life, we are 
caught up with things, tasks, and others, and seldom no-
tice our own bodily comportment itself; as Husserl ac-
knowledges, a special "asking back into" (Riickfrage) 
is necessary to thematize the operative kinaestheses 
and make them available for phenomenological de-
scription. Similarly, F. Mathias Alexander character-
izes everyday life in terms of "end-gaining," and caUs 
for a turn to the usually unnoticed "means whereby," 
bringing to light the ongoing "how" of somatie life, 
including its deeply sedimented habits. With transfor-
mative somatie practice, however, what is taken for 
granted in the everyday attitude is not merely disc! o sed 
as a theme for possible theoretical reflection, but is ac-
tually changed: habitual tensions and restrictions are 
released, movement becomes easier, bodily alignment 
becomes more optimal, and so on. And in the process, 
somatie practice allows one to appreciate many nu-
ances ofkinaesthetic and somaesthetic experience that 

666 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
were previously vague ( or out of awareness altogether). 
Thus somatie practice can help phenomenologists de-
velop what ROBERT SOKOLOWSKI refers to in Husserlian 
Meditations ( 1974) as "appropriate sensibility" for cer-
tain sorts ofphenomena. This in turn recalls Husserl's 
emphasis in "Entwurfeiner 'Vorrede' zudenLogischen 
Untersuchungen" [ 1913] on phenomenological "see-
ing" as a ski li that can be developed, so that phenomen-
ological research depends on the evidence available 
to an experienced observer and is not identica! with 
what can be garnered through naive "seeing." More-
over, somatie work suggests a further methodological 
refinement. In The Context of Self ( 1981 ), RICHARD M. 
ZANER demonstrates the use of what he terms "promi-
nence by absence"- i.e., a key feature ofthe matters 
themselves under investigation can become conspicu-
ous precisely by considering cases where this feature 
is lacking- as an additional strategy complementing 
the free phantasy variation that is a part of the EIDE-
nc METHOD. What the richness of distinctions evoked 
by practica! somatie work suggests is the parallel pos-
sibility of "prominence through heightened optimal-
ity," i.e., the use of striking "plus" variations (rather 
than "minus" variations where a key feature is miss-
ing) in elucidating the usually tacit structures of the 
type of experience in question. Thus while phenomen-
ology enriches somatics by providing a language and a 
framework within which to articulate its assumptions 
and achievements, somatics enriches phenomenology 
-
especially, but not exclusively, phenomenology of 
the body -
by opening up a realm of hitherto unno-
ticed phenomena and specifying attitudes and styles of 
comportment that allow these phenomena tobe thema-
tized and explored in great detail. 
This is of particular importance in ensuring that 
certain themes pertaining to CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMEN-
OLOGY and GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY -
e.g., passive 
synthesis (Husserl), kinaesthetic consciousness (uL-
RICH CLAESGES), and the distinction between the body as 
constituted and the body as constituting (LUDWIG LAND-
GREBE) -
are not merely taken up conceptually, but 
can be worked out by subsequent phenomenologists 
on the basis of the appropriate experiential EVIDENCE. 
Such investigations are in turn crucial to demonstrating 
that the Husserlian conception of transcendental "con-
sciousness," "subjectivity," or "person" cannot be con-
fused with a Cartesian ego radically sundered from a 
thing called a "body," but already includes a corporeal-
kinaesthetic stratum (as JITENDRA NATH MOHANTY has 
indeed suggested in severa! essays). 
Yet another area of convergence between pheno-
menology and somatics can be indicated by borrowing 
(and extending) the notion of a "critique of corporeal 
experience" mentioned by ENZO PACI in Funzione delle 
scienze e significato dell 'uomo (Function of the sci-
ences and signification ofthe human, 1963). Like FEM-
INISM, somatics is often critica! both ofthe objectified, 
commodified body endlessly measured up against ex-
ternally imposed ideals and ofthe ruthless domination 
of a "naturalized" body by medical authorities. For 
example, in Body (1983 ), Don Hanlon Johnson uses 
the notion of "techniques ofthe body" introduced in a 
1934lecture by Marcel Mauss ( 1872-1950) to contrast 
"techniques of alienation"- bodily practices that dis-
empower us by disconnecting us from our own somatie 
experience and foster authoritarian control of bodies 
-
and "techniques of authenticity," which take lived 
experience seriously (Johnson explicitly credits pheno-
menology with helping to develop this as a historical 
possibility) and foster embodied self-responsibility as 
the hasis for true community, as well as honoring bodily 
diversity rather than positing some sort of"ideal" body 
as standard or goal. Here and elsewhere, somatie theory 
recognizes not only that bodies are in general socially 
shaped, but that- as MICHEL FOUCAULT has pointed out 
-
our own history in particular has been geared in 
many ways toward molding "docile bodies." Yet many 
somatie practitioners and theorists see somatie prac-
tices as providing a genuinely liberatory alternative 
whose effects need not be confined to isolated individ-
uals, but are increasingly seen as having the potential 
to change bodily practices, and embodied power re-
lations, within the intersubjective/intercorporeal field. 
In other words, somatie practice cannot be reduced 
to a narcissistic focus on the "self," but elicits styles 
of bodily comportment and action that challenge or 
shift current social patterns by responding to a situ-
ation in an innovative and productive way, thus en-
abling new kinds of social order to emerge (a theme 
emphasized in Gendlin, resonating in certain respects 
with recent work independently pursued by BERNHARD 
WALDENFELS). 
Finally, we may point to some emerging links be-
tween somatics and a phenomenologically grounded 

SOUTH AFRICA 
667 
ETHICS. Like other practica! disciplines, somatics finds 
a variety of concrete ethical issues arising during, for 
instance, a session between an individual client and a 
practitioner. But at a deeper level, there is a core theme 
in both Hanna's !ater work and Gendlin's recent work 
that has to do with being able to experience oneself 
as being addressed by the Other rather than solely as 
addressing the other, oras being looked at by the Other 
rather than solely as observing the other, a theme rem-
iniscent of the work of EMMANUEL LEYINAS. for both 
Gendlin and Hanna, however, there is a fundamental 
fellowship not only among human somas, but among 
humans and animals and plants, which recalls Merleau-
Ponty's notions of reversibility and flesh ofthe world. 
Thus the somatie philosophy of Hanna and Gendlin 
moves toward an embodied ethics with implications 
for ECOLOGY. 
Somatics is a field that is still in the process of cre-
ating a disciplinary identity, retrieving the threads of 
its history, and searching out an appropriate language 
for its theory and practice. Yet its own historical roots 
and "proto-phenomenological" elements have already 
fostered significant relationships with the phenomen-
ological tradition, based largely on the fact that for 
both fields, the body is no Ion ger relegated to the sta tus 
of a thing among things, but is an active, expressive, 
responsive, and transformative lived body that is im-
plicated in ali our experience. Though the interaction 
between phenomenology and somatics is still in its 
early stages, we may expect an increasingly fruitful 
collaboration between these disciplines in the years to 
come.

Phenomenology in South 
Africa carne into full swing in 1948 with the appoint-
ment of CAREL KRUGEL OBERHOLZER to the chair of phi-
Josophy at the University of Pretoria. That university 
remained the center for phenomenology un tii recently, 
when the center shifted to the University of South 
Africa (Pretoria), especially to the faculty of education. 
In 1950 PETRUS SECUNDUS DREYER returned from Eu-
rope, having studied PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY un-
der HELMUTH PLESSNER and EXISTENTIALISM under KARL 
JASPERS. In 1952 Dreyer was appointed lecturer at the 
University ofPretoria. Right from the beginning, Ober-
holzer taught the principles of phenomenology and EX-
ISTENTIALISM. By that time Europe and the UNITED STATES 
had been working in this direction for practically half a 
century. As a result, phenomenologists in South Africa 
tried to start at the level of European and American 
phenomenology and they could manage this only by 
taking the study ofthe phenomenological classics, in-

cluding EDMUND HUSSERL, for granted. On the one hand, 
they tried to move on the European level; on the other 
hand, they tried to apply phenomenological principles 
to the problems- scientific and otherwise -
of the 
South African situation. Beginning at this level had its 
advantages, but also disadvantages. 
Right from the beginning the South African pheno-
menological movement was greatly inftuenced by Eu-
ropean philosophical anthropology, especially Hel-
muth Plessner, Amold Gehlen, FREDERIK J. J. BUY-
TENDIJK, Martin Buber, Erich Rothacker, MAX SCHELER, 
NICOLAI HARTMANN, Adolph Portmann, and, indirectly, 
Baron Jakob von Uexkiill, the teacher of many ofthese 
philosophers. Of equal importance was the inftuence of 
existentialism, especially Soren Kierkegaard, Friedrich 
Nietzsche, MARTIN HEIDEGGER, Karl Jaspers, and to a 
much lesser extent JEAN-PAUL SARTRE. Fundamental, 
however, was the influence of Husserl, most of ali his 
view of knowledge and science, and his phenomen-
ological EPOCHE AND REDUCTION and EIDETIC METHOD. 
The undisputed leader ofphenomenology in South 
Africa was Oberholzer, professor of philosophy and 
fundamental pedagogics at Pretoria. He was primar-
ily interested in EDUCATION, and published ali his most 
important work in this field. According to Oberholzer, 
however, every science has an ontic base, a field of 
reality that is the primary object of study of the partic-
ular science, and that at the same time determines the 
parameters and the basic principles ofthe science. The 
educational reality must be based on the anthropolog-
ical reality, because the phenomenon of education can 
only be understood as a human activity. The ontic foun-
dation ofpedagogics is the human being. Pedagogics as 
a science must necessarily be based on a valid view of 
the human being. Such a view ofthe human Oberholzer 
found by way of Husserl 's method of Wesensschau. He 
was absolutely convinced of the view of the human 
being that he developed inside the phenomenological 
horizon through phenomenological analysis; the philo-
sophical anthropology of the school of von Uexkiill 
(especially Buytendijk, Portmann, and some medi-
cal anthropologists; the psychology ofviKTOR FRANKL, 
and existential philosophy, especially Heidegger and 
Jaspers. This view of the human was the foundation, 
on the one hand, ofhis most important work, in partic-
ular Prolegomena van 'n prinsipiele pedagogiek (Pro-
legomena to pedgogic principles, 1968) -
and, on 
the other hand, an untiring struggle against ali forms 
of perspectivism, RELATIVISM, reductionism, PSYCHOLO-
GISM, NATURALISM, scientism, etc. 
Oberholzer's view ofthe human can be summarized 
as follows: the prim eva! (in the sense of original, basic, 
not further to be reduced, that which makes something 
what it is, essential) qualities ofbeing human are open-
ness, possibility, being qualified by norms, freedom, 
responsibility, accountability, and existentiality. Only 
when these qualities determine our view ofhumankind 
is it possible to understand human beings in their be-
ing and actions. A child is a human being growing up, 
a human being becoming mature. Being on the way 
to maturity does not make the child less of a human 
being, but it does imply a not yet, a movement to the 
future of maturity. This phase of being human is a 
phase of needing help, especially in the form of pro-
tection and guidance. Being a child is a mode ofbeing 
human that essentially appeals to a responsible human 
being to respond by giving protection and guidance 
on the way. The essence of education is the relation-
ship of an adult human being giving protection and 
guidance to an immature human being on his or her 
way to maturity, an adult human being responding to 
the appeal of an immature human being. This response 
is always guided by values and norms. This is essen-
tially the meaning of the word "pedagogic," which is 
derived from the Greekpaidos (child), and agein (to 
lead). An implication of this view of education is that 
terms like adult education, reeducation programs, dis-
tance education, in-service education, etc., can only 
have analogical meaning. Education in the true sense 
of the word is a direct relationship between an adult 
and a child. 
A result of Oberholzer's approach of ontologica! 
analysis was an extraordinary emphasis on the impor-
tance of ontologica! categories to describe the phe-
nomenon of education. This was strongly influenced 
by Heidegger's "analytic ofDASEIN." The discovery of 
categories makes the formulation ofnorms for educa-
tional practice possible. For some students of Ober-
holzer this became a somewhat one-sided activity. 
Under Oberholzer's influence a strong phenomen-
ological movement arose (and is still going strong) in 
education at the Universities of Pretoria, South Africa 
(Pretoria), Port Elizabeth, and the Rand Afrikaans Uni-
versity (Johannesburg), with leading figures WILLEM A.

LANDMANN, STEPHANUS J. SCHOEMAN, JACOBUS J. PIENAAR, 
PIET VAN ZYL, DANIEL J. GREYLING, MAURITS OTTO OBER-
HOLZER, PH!LIP HIGGS, and CHRISTIAN GUNTER (Univer-
sity of Stellenbosch). Common to this movement is 
the conviction that a radical reflection on the educa-
tional situation is required in order to understand the 
phenomenon of education. Such a radical reflection 
will lead to a description of the essence of the edu-
cational situation in terms of pedagogica! categories 
and corresponding criteria derived from them. In pen-
etrating the essence of the phenomenon of education as 
it occurs universally, the phenomenologist is required 
to suspend provisionally his or her extrinsic aims and 
beliefs. 
Dreyer joined and supported Oberholzer enthusias-
tically in his struggle against psychologism, natural-
ism, and scientism, and especially against ideologica! 
thinking. Primarily he was interested in the fundamen-
tal epistemological problems of the HUMAN SCIENCES 
( Geisteswissenschaften ). His field of speciality was the 
theory of HISTORY, especially the historian 's concept of 
time, the problem of subjectivity and objectivity, the 
truth and validity ofhistorical propositions, and the ap-
plicability ofKANT's Zur Natur des Menschen gehOrige 
Metaphysik (Metphysics belonging essentially to hu-
man nature) to history. Related to this field ofstudywas 
his interest in culture as an essential human character-
istic. Basic problems that arose time and again were the 
problems of the relation and communication between 
persons separated from each other by space, time, and 
culture, as well as the methodological problems ofthe 
phenomenological approach to a phenomenon that be-
longs to past history. 
In his Inleiding tot diefilosofie van die geskiedenis 
(Introduction to the philosophy of history, 197 4) and 
a number of papers published in journals, Dreyer em-
phasizes that history is the science that has its field of 
study in the reality ofhumans in their LIFEWORLD exist-
ing in the past. The universal essence of the human is 
openness; the human being is completely part ofhis or 
her lifeworld, and yet able to transcend the lifeworld 
to stand on its periphery in order to change it; thus the 
human is a normative being that is constantly active 
in consciously knowing, evaluating, and changing his 
or her self and lifeworld. Human beings are funda-
mentally and essentially cultural beings. Culture is the 
nature of humankind. 
This view of the human is the pivot for the ap-
proach of history. It enables the historian- a unique 
human being in his or her own unique life world- to 
look back from one point intime (the present) to other 
unique human beings in their unique lifeworlds and 
their points in time (the past), in such a way that they 
can be understood. In this way the past becomes a !iv-
ing, meaningful past into which we of the present can 
enter and that we can grasp nearly as well (and often 
better) than we can grasp our own world or the people 
of the past theirs. Only on the basis of this view of the 
human is it possible to know history in the true sense of 
the word. It is the guide of the historian 's approach to 
the epistemological problems ofhistorical study; ofthe 
constructions a historian has to make to bridge gaps in 
his or her knowledge ofthe past and to give a coherent 
narrative ofthe past; ofthe evaluation ofthe so-called 
laws of history; of the search for meaning in history; 
and so on. 
As an illustration, a short summary ofDreyer's ap-
proach to the problem ofthe TRUTH ofhistorical inter-
pretation can be offered: the intention ofthe historian is 
to te li the truth about the past, but the past is notat hand. 
We must penetra te the past by way of the memory of 
people, documents, and monuments. We must establish 
facts ofthe past. Facts according to the realist-positivist 
approach are statements that correspond to events of 
the past. These events, however, do not lie around like 
stones on a beach. They must be reconstructed and 
evaluated in the historical narrative, which compels the 
historian to discover and evaluate facts in the context 
of a coherent whole. This is the source of the never-
ending difference between realists-positivists, on the 
one hand, and idealists, on the other hand, between 
adherents of correspondence or coherence. Neither a 
catalogue of facts nor an abstract system of coherent 
pronouncements can give a meaningful and compre-
hensive narrative ofthe past. Without facts, knowledge 
ofhistory is impossible; without coherence, the impor-
tance, meaning, and even the factuality offacts are in-
conceivable. A simple combination of correspondence 
and coherence does not solve the problem. Only when 
the historian remembers that the objects of history are 
humans, who are the makers of history, therefore also 
the subjects of history; that humans are never things 
among other things; that the human story can never 
be told, except when the human essence- that which 

670 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
makes us human beings- is fully expressed; only, in 
other words, when historians remember that humans 
of the past are subjects even as the historian is him-
or herself, subjects only to be approached through in-
tersubjective communication, only then can a true and 
meaningful narrative ofthe past be told. 
The influence ofphenomenology was disseminated 
by Dreyer's students. Students of the history of eul-
ture, ARCHITECTURE, and history -
some to the level 
of magister -
attended his lectures and seminars. In 
philosophy a number ofhis students played an impor-
tant role, although each had his own special field of 
interest. 
FREDERIK J. ENGELBRECHT wrote his doctoral disser-
tation on the phenomenon of the threshold. He was 
greatly interested in and influenced by the metabletika 
of J. H. van den Berg. Before he retired, Engelbrecht 
was head ofthe department ofphilosophy and dean of 
arts at the University ofthe North. 
GERRIT VAN wvK's doctoral dissertation was on the 
ethics of Nicolai Hartmann, and he became head of 
the philosophy department at the University of Zul-
uland. ERSMUS D. PRINSLOO doctor's thesis was on the 
phenomenological approach. His special field is infor-
mallogic and he is head ofthe philosophy department 
at the University of South Africa (Pretoria). 
c. s. DE BEER's doctor's thesis was on meaning in 
history. He is Professor of Communication Sciences at 
the University of South Africa. His special field is the 
philosophy of PAUL RICCEUR. 
JENS KROGER's doctor's thesis was on the concept 
of horde in the philosophies of Nietzsche, ORTEGA Y 
GASSET, and Heidegger. He is a senior lecturer at the 
University of South Africa. 
ANDRIES 
P. 
DU TOIT's doctor's thesis was on 
Kierkegaard. His special field is logic and he is the 
head ofthe philosophy department at the University of 
Pretoria. 
Indirectly the influence of phenomenology can be 
seen in other sciences, e.g., the PSYCHOLOGY ofREX VAN 
vuuREN, currently at the University of Pretoria. 
In ETHNOLOGY at the University of Pretoria the fun-
damental approach has changed from evolutionary, 
naturalistic principles to phenomenological principles. 
Terms from the phenomenological sphere, like life-
world, horizon, scale of values, cultural values and 
norms, the uniqueness of the human being, etc., ha ve 
become part of everyday language, even outside scien-
tific circles, in South Africa.

SPACE 
As early as the preface to Philoso-
phie der Arithmetik ( 189\ ), EDMUND HUSSERL spoke of 
another volume devoted to studying additional con-
cepts belonging to mathematical analysis and to fash-
ioning a new philosophical theory of Euclidean and 
non-Euclidean geometries as well as their relation to 
arithmetical analysis. This volume was never com-
pleted, although manuscripts treating these issues dat-
ing from 1886 to 1901 ha ve been published as Studien 
zur Arithmetik und Geometrie. These texts distinguish 
faur senses in which we ordinarily employ the word 
"space": (l) the space of everyday living, i.e., the in-
tuitive space that is both before and beyond science; 
(2) the space of pure geometry or MATHEMATics; (3) the 
space of applied geometry, i.e., the space of the NAT-
URAL SCIENCEs; and ( 4) the space of metaphysics. The 
texts devote themselves, however, primarily to the first 
two senses. 
The early studies of intuitive space in these 
manuscripts are not as developed or extensive as those 
of the 1907 Dingvorlesung published as Ding und 
Raum ( 1973). By 1907 Husserl had begun to clarify 
his conception of the phenomenological EPOCHE AND 
REDUCTION and method. In the earlier texts he is al-
ready aware of an important distinction that is easily 
overlooked and that continues to operate in the 1907 
text, viz., the distinction between the conceptual con-
tent of the description of intuited space and intuited 
space itself. We must be careful not to ascribe the con-
ceptual properties used in the description of intuited 
space to intuited space as such. In other words, even 
though our philosophical description of intuited space 
and ofvisual fields might employ mathematical terms 
and structures, it does not follow that we intuit or im-
mediately experience space as mathematically struc-
tured. Indeed, a careful reflection on this distinction 
shows that we must distinguish different senses ofthe 
intuitive experience and of intuited spaces, for if the 
geometric presentation of space depends on the ideal-
izing of intuited space, as Husserl says it does, and if

SPACE 
in our everyday perception of space we use analogues 
ofmathematical concepts, as Husserl says we do, then 
there must be a more fundamental or immediate ex-
perience of space already contained within this ordi-
nary perceptual experience. One implication of such a 
distinction, as JOHN DRUMMOND argues, is that immedi-
ately experienced space in and of itself does not ha ve 
a particular mathematical structure, although PARTRICK 
HEELAN argues a contrary position in his detailed study 
of the relations between the perceptual experience and 
the scientific understanding of space. 
Husserl 's differentiation in the 1907 text of the 
"phantom"-i.e., the purely sensible object, within the 
ordinary, concrete material object ofperception with ali 
its ca usa!, functional, and value-properties- permits 
him to speak ofthe immediate experience ofspace and 
the sensible experience of the phantom as they occur 
within ordinary, perceptual experience. Within PERCEP-
TION our investigation of the sensible properties of an 
object can never be complete; our experience can never 
exhaust the object's sensible appearances. In ordinary 
experience, the tendency toward a more complete and 
precise determination of an object is limited by the 
practica! interest momentarily governing our percep-
tual life. This interest calls forth certain qualities for 
attention and demands that the object be given so that 
we can best experience those qualities. In the case of 
vision, for example, the possibility o fan optimal given-
ness of an object relative to our practica! interest in the 
object requires, among other things, that the object be 
( 1) given in the center of the vi sua! field rather than at 
its margins, (2) presented at a suitable distance from 
the perceiver ( not too ne ar and not too far), and (3) sus-
ceptible to careful and comprehensive scrutiny by the 
perceiver. 
The key to understanding the satisfaction of each 
part of this requirement is what Husserl calls "kinaes-
thesis," by which he means ( 1) the capability of per-
ceiving subjects to move their sense organs and BODY 
such that the position ofthe sense organs relative to the 
object changes and (2) the appertinent awareness in ki-
naesthetic sensations ofbodily movements and bodily 
attitudes. Husserl describes the motivational connec-
tion between a particular course ofkinaesthetic sensa-
tions and the sensations (hyletic data) that present the 
objective determinations ofthe object existing in space, 
although Drummond argues that the motivational con-
671 
nection properly exists between the bodily activities 
themselves and the objective qualities as intended. The 
awareness ofspace, then, is achieved by virtue ofthose 
kinaesthetic activities that produce the satisfaction of 
the requirement for optimal appearances. The first part 
ofthe requirement deals with an appearance's position 
within the visual field, whereas the second and third 
parts deal with an object's position in space relative 
to the percipient. The satisfaction ofthe first part does 
not require that the whole body move, whereas, at least 
with respect to vi sion, the satisfaction ofthe second and 
third parts do. 
Husserl identifies levels in the awareness of space, 
levels in the sense that a more complex experience 
presupposes a less complex one even when the less 
complex cannot concretely and independently exist. 
As ULRICH CLAESGES has shown, the visual fields that 
present space can properly be conceived as correlates 
of kinaesthetic systems. Starting with the artificial ki-
naesthetic situation in which the perceiver is perfectly 
at rest, Husserl identifies the visual field simpliciter, 
the field consisting entirely of aflat expanse of areas of 
contrasting apparent qualities filling delimited parts of 
the field. He then begins systematically to add different 
kinaesthetic systems, beginning with the system of eye 
movements. The resultant oculomotoric field differs 
from the previous field insofar as objects newly appear 
and disappear at the margins ofthe field and ali objects 
continuously change their orientation in the field as the 
eyes are moved. The oculomotoric field, then, is the 
quadridirectional (up and down, left and right) widen-
ing ofthe visual field simpliciter generated by moving 
the eyes both left and right and up and down. 
Different kinaesthetic systems can up to a point sub-
stitute for or extend one another. The changes found in 
the oculomotoric field, for example, can be duplicated 
if the eyes are kept still but the head moves. More 
importantly, the changes introduced by eye movement 
can be extended by additional movements ofthe head 
to the left and right and up and down. The result is 
the cephalomotoric field, the correlate of eye and head 
movements; it is a field that forms a closed, cyclical 
unity in the left-right dimension, but remains limited 
in the up-down dimension. The movements ofthe eyes 
and the head enable the object to which our interest 
and perceptual attention are directed to be brought to 
the center ofthe visual field. But we do not yet experi-

672 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ence objective, three-dimensional space; the fields are 
two-dimensional presentations of space, and no third 
dimension is available within the field itself. 
The kinaesthetic activities necessary for the consti-
tution of three-dimensional space involve the move-
ment ofthe whole body; they are two, viz., distancing 
and orbiting. Distancing is the movement ofthe body 
toward or away from the object such that its apparent 
size expands or contracts, as does the apparent size of 
the other appearances forming the background against 
which the object appears. It allows us to ensure that 
the object is at a suitable distance for optimal view-
ing. Orbiting is the movement ofthe body around the 
object such that there results an apparent tuming mo-
tion of the object, specifically an axial rotation of its 
appearances and of the field presenting the thing in 
space. This allows us to become aware of the bodily 
enclosedness ofthe object and to inspect the object in 
its various dimensions and aspects. 
Husserl identifies vision and touch as the two forms 
ofperception that bring an identica!, objective space to 
presence. There are two important differences between 
the kinaesthetic activities involved in touch and vi sion. 
The first is that a single tactual system, that of the 
hand with its fingers, is sufficient for the constitution 
of tactual space. The systems of the lower arm, upper 
arm, and whole body are merely extensions ofthis basic 
system and are brought into play because ofthe size of 
the object or for convenience and comfort. The second 
difference is that in tactile perception, distancing does 
not present a continuous third dimension. Although it 
still does indicate the object's own position in space 
relative to the moving body parts, distancing in touch 
is a simple binary system: the object is distant and not 
touched or it is near and in contact with the tactual 
organs. 
Husserl rejects both a priori and empiricistic ac-
counts of the origin of our geometric experience of 
space. He claims instead that this presentation is 
grounded in an idealizing abstraction of empirica!, in-
tuited spatial structures and in the asymptotic approxi-
mation of a li mit. The idealizing presentation of shape 
has three aspects: ( 1) the limitation of a general concern 
with objects to a theoretical concern with their shapes 
simply as measurable; (2) the focusing of attention on 
a side or appearance of an object in abstraction both 
(a) from the field and its horizons in which the side or 
object is presented and (b) from other si des and views 
of the object; and (3) the limitation of attention to the 
two-dimensionality ofthe presentation ofthe object or 
its side. We perceptually attend to the side or appear-
ance ofthe object as measurable, focus on its surface, 
and then idealize this edge, and this idealization con-
sists precisely of the approximating approach to pure 
two-dimensionality, to the two-dimensional limiting 
surface, e.g., a square ora rectangle. This process can 
be repeated to yield the awareness ofthe line and then 
the point. With similar starting points and a similar 
process we can arrive at other geometric notions, such 
as continuity, congruence, distance, direction, and po-
sition. 
The point is the intersection ofthe geometrica! con-
cern with shapes and volumes -
a concern that ide-
ally postulates the point as the li mit of one-dimensional 
magnitudes and that fully developed itselfin Euclidean 
plane and solid geometry- and the geometrica! con-
cern with position, which developed itself most fully 
in analytic, coordinate geometry. The introduction of 
number and of algebraic techniques in the coordinate 
geometry is a significant step beyond the idealization 
found in Euclidean geometry, for numbers are achieved 
in formalizing abstraction. As such, numbers are purely 
formal concepts, applicable to anything whatsoever. 
The significance ofthis arithmetization of geometry is 
that the coordinate pairs or triads used to indicate points 
in either two- or three-dimensional space are no Ion ger 
limited to a spatial interpretation. The formalization of 
geometry breaks the essential connection between the 
idealized geometries and the shapes ofbodies. 
The further significance ofthe formalization of ge-
ometry is that the algebraic functions used to describe 
the relations between those things designated by pairs 
or triads of numbers can be complicated in a variety 
ofways through the exercise ofmathematical "choice" 
with its conventions. One way is to introduce a greater 
number of variables into the formulas. This produces 
"geometries" that are n-dimensional (n > 3) wherein 
"points" are identified by n-tuples. The development 
of such hyperspaces is crucial for the development of 
a faur-dimensional space-time continuum in Einstein 's 
theory of relativity. 
Husserl's development of multiplicity or manifold 
theory allows him to distinguish between geometry 
as an idealization of intuited structures and geometry 

SPACE 
as an instance of manifold theory. In the case of Eu-
clidean geometry, the abstraction of the theory-form 
from the idealized geometry yields a Euclidean man-
ifold of three dimensions. Other n-dimensional Eu-
clidean and non-Euclidean manifolds can then be con-
structed by mathematical "choice." For Husserl, then, 
the Euclidean manifold and the Euclidean space for 
which it is the pure categoria! form are prior to the 
non-Euclidean manifolds and spaces. Indeed, the the-
ory of non-Euclidean manifolds is for Husserl a logica! 
consequence ofthe theory ofEuclidean manifolds. 
The clarification ofthe distinction between regional 
ontologies and FORMAL ONTOLOGY and of that between 
idealization and formalization allows us to view the 
Euclidean idealizations as a regional ontology and the 
Euclidean manifold as a formal ontology, which, while 
normally applied to space, is applicable to any object or 
region ofbeing at ali. Since the three-dimensional Eu-
clidean manifold is the formalization (via abstraction of 
the theory-form) of idealized geometry it can safely be 
applied in a physical geometry. Once free mathemati-
cal constructions are introduced into the manifolds and 
these manifolds are interpreted as "geometries" and ap-
plied to spatial objects of experience, however, "false" 
regional ontologies might result. In the case of space, 
this means that a mathematically derived manifold is 
applicable as a physical geometry only if it is consis-
tent with the Euclidean idealizations ofthe local space 
in which we li ve. Since Husserl was writing before the 
publication ofEinstein 's papers on the theory ofrelativ-
ity, we can obtain from these texts no indication ofwhat 
he would ha ve thought about this theory. We can point 
out, however, that even though relativity theory in-
volves the application of a faur-dimensional manifold, 
it satisfies this condition. And we can also point out 
that Husserl apparently approved OSKAR BECKER's dis-
cussion of the philosophical significance of relativity 
theory. As Becker points out, however, one reason for 
the successful application of Einstein 's theories is that 
the four coordinates of space-time cannot be arbitrar-
ily interchanged; every point in the faur-dimensional 
continuum involves a splitting apart of three spatial 
dimensions and a time dimension. 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER's phenomenology of space in 
Sein und Zeit( 1927), sharply distinguishes the immedi-
ate experience of spatiality from the cognitive and for-
mal intuition of an objective and homogeneous space. 
673 
Heidegger stresses the need to ground analyses of space 
in the comportment of DASEIN toward the world rather 
than in the subject's cognitive awareness of space. This 
difference is manifest in his discussion of distancing. 
For Heidegger, distancing is not essentially related to 
objective distance; instead, the activity of distancing is 
the overcoming of a state of distance by bringing close, 
making ready-to-hand, what was formerly remote from 
our practica! concems. For the analysis ofthe cognitive 
and formal awareness of higher-order space, Heideg-
ger simply refers to Becker's study. Similarly, MAURICE 
MERLEAU-PONTY, who is primarily concerned with an 
account of how space comes to presence in a bodily 
relation to the world, refers to Becker for detailed anal-
yses of the bodily activity involved in our awareness 
ofspace. 
Becker, to whom the texts of Ding und Raum and 
Studien zur Arithmetik und Geometrie were not avail-
able, provides a slightly different account of the lev-
els in the constitution of space: ( 1) the pre-spatial 
or quasi-spatial fields, further distinguished into the 
sense field ( corresponding to the sense field simpliciter) 
and the kinaesthetic field (corresponding to the ki-
naesthetic sensations themselves and the oculomotoric 
and cephalomotoric fields they motivate); (2) oriented 
space, wherein the perceiving body is considered a 
body in the world and the absolute "here," i.e., the 
absolute point of orientation for ali other objects; and 
(3) homogeneous space, which (a) is essentially char-
acterized by the relativization of the "here" and by 
intersubjectivity and (b) is the space of concern to 
mathematical and scientific investigation. Becker's no-
tion of homogeneous space leads beyond the space of 
immediate and perceptual awareness to the space con-
stituted in the mathematical and physical sciences. He 
characterizes the approximating approach to the limit 
as the contraction ofthe visual fields to the line and to 
the ideal vanishing point. Since Becker is concerned 
to show how geometric axioms are grounded in the 
original experience of space, he tends to disclose these 
perceptual foundations in the same order required by 
the axiomatic system in which they are mathemati-
cally presented. From this starting point, Becker can 
then clarify the awareness of the definite mathemati-
cal manifold and the mathematical continuum, both of 
which are important not only in geometry itself, but 
in its physical applications. Becker indicates how Eu-

674 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
clidean geometry is the categoria! form for the space of 
everyday experience and how non-Euclidean geometry 
is the categoria! form for the space of NATURAL SCIENCE. 
ELJSABETH STROKER also develops a comprehensive 
view of different levels of the experience of space. 
Whereas Becker's study is more Husserlian in char-
acter, limiting itself to the discussion of the experien-
tial foundations of geometry in our intuitive experi-
ence and to the discussion of geometric and physical 
spaces; Stroker's develops Heideggerian insights. She 
more fully explores the ordinary, lived experience of 
space as manifested in our comportmenttoward things; 
she then proceeds to a discussion of mathematical 
spaces, but ignores issues raised by their application 
in physics. Stroker discusses the foundations of our 
geometric experience of space in lived space, within 
which she distinguishes (1) "attuned" space, (2) the 
space of ACTION, and (3) intuitive space. The distinction 
between these spaces is fundamentally a distinction 
between three different spatial structures correlated to 
three different styles of bodily comportment in which 
the body is viewed as ( 1) the carrier of expressive con-
tent, (2) the physical aspect of practica!, goal-oriented 
activity, and (3) the center of perception. Within ge-
ometric or mathematical spaces Stroker distinguishes 
(1) Euclidean and (2) non-Euclidean spaces, and un-
der (2) she distinguishes (a) hyperbolic and (b) Rie-
mannian geometries. Stroker identifies the elements in 
the pre-theoretical experiences of space that contribute 
to the grounding and understanding ofthe various ge-
ometries, and thereby avoids discussing non-Euclidean 
geometries solely in terms ofthe mathematical propen-
sities that led to their development, although she, like 
Husserl, maintains the priority of Euclidean geome-
try over non-Euclidean geometries. She also discusses 
intuitability and the pictorial symbolism of analytic 
and formalized geometries, as well as the relationship 
between mathematical demonstration and the constitu-
tion of mathematical idealities. 
Discussions of the perceptual and affective experi-
ences of space can also be joined together in a con-
sideration ofthe aesthetic experience ofspace. Stroker 
has in another context discussed problems of perspec-
tive in pictorial art, and Heelan has tied his discussion 
of the mathematical features of perceptual space to a 
discussion of our experience of pictori al space in art. 
In addition, Gaston Bachelard ( 1884---1962) explores in 
detail the affective dimensions of the various kinds of 
space and spatially characterized objects that capture 
the attention ofpoets. Finally, EDWARD s. CASEY inves-
tigates the richly articulated phenomenon of "place," 
in contrast to mere "sites" in homogeneous, isotropic 
"space." 
Reftection on the nature of space has traditionally 
been central to philosophical reftection. This centrality 
stems from the fact that space, again along with TIME, 
is a form governing the objects of the physical world 
in which we live. As such, space becomes central to 
ali our experiences of those objects, from our most 
immediate encounters with individual things to our 
most detached, theoretical explanations ofthe physical 
world as a whole. Space is experienced in multiple 
ways in these various experiences, and these ways need 
tobe carefully distinguished, but care fu! attention must 
also be paid also to their interrelationships, indeed to 
their unity, for it is one space we experience. Reftection 
on the experiences of space is thus necessarily complex 
and varied; indeed, this complexity makes it difficult 
to provide a truly comprehensive account of ali the 
varied modes in which space might be experienced 
and present itself to us.

SPAIN AND LATIN AMERICA 
Phenomen-
ology was introduced into Spain by JOSE ORTEGA Y GAS-
SET, whose first book, Meditaciones de! Quijote (Medi-
tations on Quixote, 1914 ), contains phenomeno1ogical 
themes- the condition ofbeing latent or patent, mean-
ing as a correlative notion to interpretation, flesh as the 
depth dimension ofthings-along with the first formu-
lation ofthe thesis that "I am 1 and my circumstances." 
In a course given in 1915/16, published as Investiga-
ciones psicol6gicas ( 1982), Ortega went on to develop 
a pure descriptive science ofnoetic phenomena, draw-
ing heavily on EDMUND HUSSERL 's ldeen zu ei ner reinen 
Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen Philoso-
phie 1 (1913). The issue of Ortega's relationship to 
phenomenology has long been debated, particularly in 
view of his statement that he abandoned phenomen-
ology at the very moment in which he received it. But 
he also made clear that it is necessary to go through 
phenomenology and its method of intuition and de-
scription as opposed to abstract conceptual thought in 
order to situate philosophy in a dimension of system-
atic thought grounded on a phenomenon that by itself 
is a system, i.e., the life in each one ofus. 
Life is described as the radical reality in which ali 
other realities are grounded. It should be understood 
as the coexistence and interaction with circumstances 
or the world. Neither 1 nor my circumstances can be 
conceived of separately because they are rooted in the 
ultimate reality that is life. Change, development, and 
hence history are distinctive traits of life insofar as it 
unfolds as a problem, a being occupied with things, a 
preoccupation with oneself, a life project or vocation 
based on choice, and a radical insecurity as ifwe were 
shipwrecked in the midst ofthings. 
This presentation oflife resembles in some respects 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER'S characterization of DASEIN. Ortega 
acknowledges this connection, yet claims precedence 
for himself, arguing that it forms the core of his own 
work since his first book. On the other hand, Or-
tega's notion oflife exhibits similarities with Husserl 's 
"worldexperiencing life" in that it entails the simul-
taneity of subject and object in a singular event and 
is the presupposition on which alone it makes sense 
to assert any other reality whatsoever. In El tema de 
nuestro tiempo (The theme of our time, 1923 ), Ortega 
states that each life is a point ofview upon the uni verse, 
and analyzes the divergence and complementarity of 
perspectives between persons, peoples, and epochs. A 
reduction ofthe world must be accomplished, i.e., its 
transformation into the horizon of a living subject or 
the life course that runs through peoples, generations, 
and individuals. It must be noted that he speaks of 
the "world of our life" as an encompassing unity or 
immense circumstance. 
Ortega's influence was exerted not only through 
teaching and writing, but also as the editor of a jour-
nal and a series of books. After 1923 they were 
the chief channel through which phenomenology was 
made known to the Spanish-language world. The group 
that gathered around Ortega included MANUEL GARciA 
MORENTE; JOSE GAOS, whose translation of Husserl 's Lo-
gische Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901) was decisive for 
Lester Embree, Elizabeth A. Behnke, David Carr, J. Claude Evans, Jose Huertas-Jourda, Joseph J. Kockelmans, William R. McKenna,

the dissemination of phenomenology; and JOAQUiN Xl-
RAU, author of Lafilosojia de Husserl ( 1942), the first 
comprehensive presentation of Husserl in Spanish. 
XAVIER ZUBIRI received his doctorate in philosophy 
under Ortega with a dissertation in which Husserl's 
theory of judgment is examined in terms of both sub-
jective acceptance and objective intention. Having !ater 
attended Husserl's and Heidegger's courses, he carne 
to emphasize the double function of phenomenology 
for his generation in the sense that it made possible the 
apprehension of the content of things and laid open a 
free domain for philosophy against the constraints of 
psychology and science. But he objects that reality is 
not the problematic arrival point, but ratherthe point of 
departure. Intentionality must be understood not only 
as "going toward" but also as "starting from." lts dou-
ble movement is grounded on that primordial sentient 
intellection of the real as such that characterizes the 
human being. Being prior to the subjective and objec-
tive pole of intentionality, this intellection breaks up 
into them and so establishes them as related terms. 
lnftuenced by Ortega and Zubiri, PEDRO LAiN EN-
TRALGO has dealt with phenomenological standpoints 
on the knowledge of others. Important also for his 
efforts to keep phenomenology on the scene is SERGIO 
RĂBADE ROMEO. In Experiencia, cuerpo, y conocimiento 
(Experience, body, and cognition, 1985), he examines 
the relationship holding between the lived BODY and 
knowledge and provides a careful historical and sys-
tematic account ofthis problem. But the foremost rep-
resentative ofphenomenology in this transition period 
is FERNANDO MONTERO MOLINER, who argues both for an 
expansion in order to include subjects closely related to 
those ofHERMENEUTICS and ORDINARY LANGUAGE ANALY-
SIS, and for a retum to the historical forerunners who in 
the past ha ve contributed to the unveiling of genuine 
phenomena. For instance, Husserl's phenomenology 
of time should be complemented with an analysis of 
objective time inspired by Aristotle. 
JAVIER SAN MARTIN has Jaid emphasis On the oppo-
sition between a descriptive and a critica! project in 
Husserl 's phenomenology. He contends that the task of 
explication is incompatible with the initial motivation 
that seeks for absolute assurance. Nevertheless, in the 
practice of phenomenological analysis there emerges 
a different critica! project that belongs to the sphere 
of practica! REASON. Another significant philosophi-
cal contribution is to be found in the differentiation 
of structure, function, and principle within phenomen-
ology. 
San Martin has been, since its foundation in 1989, 
president of the Spanish Society of Phenomenology, 
which has organized annual conferences and a seminar 
devoted successively to the phenomenology ofOrtega, 
the lifeworld, and cultural pluralism. A bulletin has 
been issued regularly and will henceforth be expanded 
into the joumal lnvestigaciones Fenomenol6gicas. 
Prominent members are interested in a variety of top-
ics. MIGUEL GARCiA-BAR6 is best known for his studies 
of Husserl 's concept oflogical reason and the relation-
ship holding between transcendental phenomenology 
and rational theology. JEsus CONILL stresses the pheno-
menological motives in Ortega and Zubiri and the 
metaphysica] significance of HERMENEUTICAL PHENO-
MENOLOGY. JOSE GOMEZ HERAS is concemed with the 
phenomenological foundations for an ETHICS of NATU-
RAL SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY. CESAR MORENO MARQUEZ 
offers in La intersubjetividad en Husserl ( 1989) an 
analysis ofhow the intentiona! openness of experience 
to a manifold of perspectives requires the implication 
of othemess in egological subjectivity. AGUSTiN SER-
RANO DE HARO has attempted to show the significance 
of the ontologica! framework supplied by the theory 
of parts and wholes. NEL RODRIGUEZ RIAL deaJs in 0 
planeta ferido (The wounded planet, 1991) with the 
contribution of phenomenology to ECOLOGY. 
Remaining to be mentioned are ANTONIO PINTOR 
RAMOS, author of El humanismo de Max Scheler 
(1979) and studies on Zubiri and LEVINAS, and MIGUEL 
OLASAGASTI, who, in Introducci6n a Heidegger (1967) 
has provided an accurate presentation of this philoso-
pher with an appraisal ofthe possibilities ofhis thought. 
Ortega has also played an outstanding role in the 
introduction of phenomenology into Latin America 
because of his visits to Argentina in 1916, 1928, 
and 1939. A key figure there was FRANCISCO ROMERO, 
who was consulting foreign editor for Philosophy and 
Phenomenological Research from its foundation. He 
developed a "theory of man" under the inftuence of 
Husserl, Sche]er, and NICOLAI HARTMANN. His most im-
portant thesis is that a movement oftranscendence runs 
through reality and increases as it gradually advances 
from inorganic reality through life, pre-intentional psy-
chism, and intentiona! psychism to the realm of spirit.

Reality as a whole is permeated by the general tendency 
of entities to go beyond themselves. This universal im-
petus increases its rhythm as we ascend in the scale and 
provides the ground out ofwhich intentionality stems. 
The re-encounter of reality with itselfthrough an inten-
tiona! duplication implies an abrupt and revolutionary 
change in the sense that reality not only continues to 
be what it is, but is also its reflection in consciousness. 
Along with the essential intentionality of the human 
being, Romero holds that the basic intentiona! struc-
ture is cognitive. 
In applying Husserl 's phenomenology to the philos-
ophy of law, CARLOS coss1o has propounded an "ego· 
logica! theory" structured according to a formal logic 
ofLAW consisting in an analysis oflegal norms and sys-
tems (logic of parts and wholes) and a transcendental 
legal logic or theory of! egal knowledge. Following the 
Ii nes laid down by Heidegger, CARLOS AS TRADA empha-
sizes in El juego existencial (Experiential play, 1932) 
that play is the metaphysical essence ofthe human be-
ing and tries to take into account the historical elements 
in the constitution ofDasein. Influenced to some extent 
by Romero, EUGEN! O PUCCIARELLI advocates a hierarchi-
cal theory oftime that takes account ofthe stratification 
ofhuman reality in order to harmonize the plurality of 
temporalities that occur in different levels. Also con-
cerned with Heidegger, ADOLFO P. CARPIOargues in favor 
ofthe resolvability ofphilosophical problems once we 
transcend beings toward a comprehension of Being. As 
this leap cannot be but each one's event, metaphysics 
shows a "pluranimous" character. 
Another type of Heideggerian interpretation is es-
poused by HECTOR MANDRIONI, who has also written on 
MAX SCHELER. His point is that in view of the human 
situation in the technological world, a disclosure ofthe 
ways in which poetic and conceptual discourse emerge 
in the articulation of silence and language is essential 
to unveil the originary sense of experience. Whereas RI-
CARDO MALIANDI has undertaken a revision ofScheler's 
and Hartmann's material-value ethics from the stand-
point of Karl Otto Apel's transcendental pragmatics, 
and MARIO A. PRESAS has written on the hermeneutica! 
transformation of phenomenology, ROBERTO WALTON at-
tempts to show that the notion of horizonality has en-
abled Husserl not only to foreshadow new versions 
of phenomenology, but also to point toward cognitive 
sources for other forms of transcendental philosophy. 
Also influenced by Husserlian phenomenology are JU-
LIA IRIBARNE, who, in La intersubjetividad en Husserl 
( 1987), provides a characterization of monadology ac-
cording to the levels of intersubjectivity, and ALCIRA 
BONILLA, who, in Mundo de la vida (Lifeworld, 1985), 
examines the a priori structure ofthe Iifeworld. The Ar-
gentine Society for Phenomenology and Hermeneutics 
was founded in 1992. 
An interest for phenomenology in Mexico goes back 
to Antonio Caso-who, although not tobe counted as a 
phenomenologist, wrote Lafilosofia de Husserl ( 1934) 
and summarized the antagonism between phenomen-
ology and positivism- and EDUARDO GARclA MĂ YNEZ, 
who, influenced by Hartmann and ALEXANDER PFĂNDER, 
attempted to develop a theory of VALUE that would 
provide the foundations for positive law. Exiled from 
Spain after the Civil War, JOSE GAOS continued his ex-
tensive work as translator of Husserl, Heidegger, and 
Hartmann in Mexico. A personal student ofGaos, FER-
NANDO SALMERON, wrote his doctoral dissertation on 
the theory of ideal being and has also written on the 
problem of meaning and language in Heidegger. LUIS 
VILLORO has published a collection of articles bearing 
the title Estudios sobre Husserl (Studies on Husserl, 
1975) in which he expounds the main themes along 
with the relationship between phenomenology and AN-
ALYTIC PHILOSOPHY, i.e., a position to which he as well 
as Salmer6n were !ater drawn. Other philosophers in-
terested in phenomenology have been EDUARDO NICOL, 
who discusses the Heideggerian notion of concealment 
and advocates a metaphysics based upon the evidence 
that Being is in sight, and MANUEL CABRERA, who has 
elaborated a criticism of Husserl from the standpoint 
of the sociology of knowledge with considerable debt 
to Scheler. Relevant work today includes a project that 
will lead to a guide for translating Husserl under the 
direction of ANTONIO ZIRION, with the participation of 
other Spanish and Latin American translators, and an 
examination of problems in the field of phenomen-
ological hermeneutics by MAURICIO BEAUCHOT. 
In Venezuela two prominent phenomenologists 
have to be mentioned. ERNESTO MAYZ VALLENILLA first 
surveyed the development of phenomenology from 
Husserl to Heidegger in two books dealing with the 
phenomenology and ontology ofknowledge. Ata !ater 
stage he developed personal insights on reason and 
technology inspired in phenomenology. Important is 

678 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the examination ofthe instruments that technology af-
fords in order to extend our power beyond the frontiers 
imposed by bodily and psychologicallimitations. In his 
Fundamentos de la meta-tecnica ( 1990), he unfolds the 
implications of the replacement of an anthropological 
or geocentric conception oftechnology by a new tech-
nological project that brings forth a nonhuman logos. 
The other leading figure is ALBERTO ROSALES, author 
of Transzendenz und Differenz ( 1970). Attempting to 
stimulate a critica! discussion of Heidegger 's philoso-
phy, he argues that the endeavor to lay bare the foun-
dations of consciousness fails because expressions like 
"Dasein" or "transcendence" are subject first to a pro-
cess offormalization in order to deprive them oftheir 
primary spatial connotations, and then to a process 
of deformalization in order that they may attain an 
adequate significant content. It is because the second 
operation must evoke the phenomenon of conscious-
ness that such expressions do not outline what human 
beings are but rather how they are. 
In Colombia, DANILO CRUZ VELEZ has dealt with the 
ideal of a lack of presuppositions in philosophy by 
linking the antagonism between objectivism and sub-
jectivism in Husserl with the overcoming ofthe meta-
physics of subjectivity in Heidegger. This leads him to 
an analysis ofthe nature ofphilosophy and its relation-
ship with science and theology. He also contends that 
the basic problems ofPHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY are 
to be illuminated in the process of disclosing the ori-
gin offreedom. GUILLERMO HOYOS VASQUEZ undertakes 
a study ofthe teleology pertaining to intentionality and 
HISTORY in his Intentionalitiit als Verantwortung (ln-
tentionality as responsibility, 1976) and recently em-
phasizes that the contributions of a theory of action and 
of the social conditions of scientific production must 
be combined with Husserl 's criticism of the positivist 
idea of science. 
Phenomenology gained a foothold in Peru through 
the contributions ofthree influential thinkers. ALBERTO 
WAGNER DE REYNA had a phenomenological training 
under Heidegger and was one of the first to make 
him known through a monograph on fundamental on-
tology in 1939. FRANCISCO MI RO QUESADA has writ-
ten on a wide variety of topics, and an early inter-
est in phenomenology is reflected in his Sentido de! 
movimiento fenomenol6gico (Meaning of the pheno-
menological movement, 1940). Inspired by Hartmann, 
AUGUSTO SALAZAR BONDI offers an investigation of ideal 
being in Irrealidad e idealidad (Irreality and ideality, 
1958). When these thinkers shifted their concern to 
other trends of thought, phenomenology tended to be 
neglected. Important today is the ro le of the Catholic 
University of Lima, where a German-Peruvian Collo-
quium on Phenomenological Philosophy with the par-
ticipation of leading German phenomenologists was 
organized in 1993 by ROSEMARY RIZO-PATRON, who has 
written on the development of intentionality in early 
Husserlian texts. 
The outstanding representative of phenomenology 
in Chile has been FELIX SCHWARTZMANN, who contends 
that the phenomenon of expression goes beyond what 
is externalized by sensuous signs. When we express 
ourselves and communicate with others, we not only 
bring forth meaning, but also let the peculiarity of our 
existential condition be seen. Both EMOTION in its sin-
gularity and an undefinable expressive infinitude are 
disclosed. This amounts to a symbolization ofthe mys-
tery of existence. Also tobe mentioned is RAUL VELOZO 
FARiAs, who has examined the meaning of the pheno-
menological EPOCHE AND REDUCTION with an empha-
sis on its motives. Uruguay is represented by JUAN 
LLAMBJAS DE AZEVEDO, who, in his Max Sche/er ( 1966), 
has offered a full-scale analytic treatment ofthis pheno-
menologist. 
In Brazii, phenomenology can be found in the phi-
losophy of law advanced by MIGUEL REALE, who has 
studied how legal models as normative structures are 
involved in social praxis, emphasizing that they must 
be differentiated from hermeneutica! models that either 
contribute to clarifying their significance or demand 
their abrogation when they do not meet the general 
interests dominant in the lifeworld. In addition, GUIDO 
ANTONIO DE ALMEIDA, author of Sinn und fnhaft in der 
genetichen Phiinomenologie E. Husserls (Sense and 
content in Husserl's genetic phenomenology, 1972), 
shows that Husserl 's GENETIC PIIENOMENOLOGY does not 
allow for the unbuilding of complexes of sense or a 
given content into ultimate entities. Rather they must 
be traced back to the world as an allembracing horizon 
of understanding or to a totality of time structures in 
the temporal process of sens ing. 
We have sketched above the main lines of devel-
opment country by country because although interna-
tional collaboration is improving today, work in the 

EDITH STEJN 
679 
region has been done more separately than in coor-
dination. In conclusion, it should be emphasized that 
phenomenology in the Latin American world can be 
characterized by the variations and refinements at-
tempted on the theses advanced by leading European 
phenomenologists. Despite the widespread acceptance 
commanded by Ortega, there has been a profusion of 
trends rather than a recognizable developing unity. 
Whatever the shortcomings in other respects, schol-
arly research on Husserl and Heidegger has been pub-
lished in Phaenomenologica (two titles ha ve been men-
tioned). Deserving of mention in the first period is the 
strong interest aroused by Scheler and Hartmann and 
the attempts to develop a philosophy of law with a 
phenomenological outlook. Even if the promotion of 
Thomism in Spain (particularly in the 1940s), and of 
analytic philosophy after the 1960s, have caused set-
backs, phenomenology has shown deep roots which 
must be measured by the success with which it has 
been able to meet these challenges. Over the past 
decade, along with the in crease in Husserlian research, 
recent developments such as the analysis oftechnology 
and PAUL RICCEUR'S HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY are 
gaining a hearing, and perhaps the most important fu-
ture contributions will be made in these areas.

EDITH STEIN 
EDMUND HUSSERL 's first assistant, 
Edith Stein, was born into an Orthodox Jewish family 
in Breslau on October 12, 1891. She was a member 
of the Carmelite order when she was put to death at 
Auschwitz in 1942. Unique among phenomenologists, 
she was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1987 at a 
ceremony in Koln attended by 70,000 people. On this 
occasion he referred to her as "Jew, philosopher, nun, 
martyr." Like Edith Stein a student of ROMAN INGARDEN 
and MAX SCHELER, the pope, KAROL WOJTYLA, wrote his 
first work on St. John of the Cross; Stein left her final 
work, also on St. John of the Cross, unfinished at her 
martyrdom. This pope commends her for her practice 
ofthe phenomenological virtues: "In keeping with her 
intellectual abilities, she did not want to accept any-
thing without careful examination, not even the faith 
ofher fathers. She wanted to get to the bottom ofthings 
herself. As such, she was engaged in a constant search 
for the truth." 
Stein began her studies in literature and German 
at the University of Breslau where she became inter-
ested in empirica! psychology, but soon became dis-
satisfied with this science stil! in its "infancy." An 
early encounter with Husserl 's Logische Untersuchun-
gen ( 1900-1901) led her to study with the master at 
Gottingen ( 1913-16). Stein then worked as Husserl 's 
assistant at Freiburg ( 1917-18), teaching his new stu-
dents and editing his manuscripts. She was initially 
attracted to Husserl's phenomenology because it took 
up the task of conceptual clarification so Jacking in the 
psychology ofher day. In addition, along with the other 
REALISTIC PIIENOMENOLOGISTS at Gi:ittingen, she saw in 
Husserl possibilities of moving beyond the dominant 
psychologism ofthe day into essential analyses condi-
tioned by the "intuitive self-givenness" ofthe "matters 
themselves." 
The golden age of Gottingen was over when 
Stein arrived in 1913, although figures such as ADOLF 
REINACH, FRITZ KAUFMANN, and HANS LIPPS exerted strong 
inftuences on her. MAX SCHELER 's lectures caused her to 
entertain the philosophical possibility of Christianity. 
Adolf Reinach 's character and conversion touched her 
deeply, as did his widow's courage and acceptance of 
his death in World War I. Phenomenology, for Stein, 
as well as for many others, provided an access to reli-
gion. Her actual conversion to Christianity took place 
in 1921 while she was staying with her friend HEDWIG 
CONRAD-MARTIUS. After a night spent reading St. Teresa 
of Avila's autobiography, Stein was convinced that the 
saint's life of experiential faith was "the truth." 
It was, however, patriotism and solidarity with the 
war effort and her fellow students rather than religios-
ity that induced Stein to serve as a nurse to Austrian 
soldiers for six months in 1914-15. She returned to her 
studies to complete her dissertation, Zum Problem der 
Einfuhlung, at Freîburg in 1916. After completing her 
studies, she worked for Husserl on Ideen zu ei ner reinen 
Phănomenologie und phănomenologishen Philosophie 
II [1912-15] and on his manuscripts on tîme. ROMAN 
INGARDEN reports that Husserl, with hîs typîcallack of 
concern for publishîng hîs manuscripts, failed to keep 
his end ofthe bargain by neglecting to review her tran-
scriptions and editorial changes. Recent scholarship

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
may suggest that her revisions were significant. Her 
frustration ultimately caused her to seek other work. 
Stein 's strictly phenomenological work from 
this period includes Beitriige zur philosophis-
chen Begrundung der Psychologie und der Geis-
teswissenschaften (Contributions to the philosophi-
cal groundng of psychology and the human sciences, 
1922) and Eine Untersuchung uber den Staat (An in-
vestigation conceming the state, 1925). Yet her best 
recognized legacy to phenomenology must be the work 
with Husserl on empathy, which determined the course 
of her lifelong preoccupation with the human as psy-
chophysical being. Although the topic of empathy was 
given to her by Husserl, her early interest in the na-
ture of the human person was already observable in 
her initial interest in psychology as a course of study in 
Breslau. While Husserl 's major emphasis was the epis-
temological and systematic functions of empathy and 
INTERSUBJECTIVITY, Stein 's analysis features empathy as 
a lived experience, an existential phenomenon. 
Husserl referred to Stein as his "best pupi!." De-
spite HERBERT SPIEGELBERG's verdict that Stein aban-
dons phenomenology for Thomism, many contempo-
rary scholars find her entire corpus tobe shaped by her 
phenomenological training. She explicitly practices the 
EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION in her 1916 dissertation with a 
suspension of the ordinary opinions about empathy, 
criticizing Lipps's view among others. She argues that 
empathic imitation of the other is not a confusion of 
self and other. Lived experiences of separate primor-
dialities ensure that the two members of an empathic 
pair are still separate selves. 
Stein distinguishes between primordial and non-
primordial experience within a single unitary con-
sciousness in order to make an analogy between the 
EGO or self and the other. Ali experience takes place in 
the present moment; even acts ofremembering are pri-
mordial. Nevertheless, the 1 can ha ve MEMORY or IMAGI-
NATION about that which is non-primordial. That which 
is no longer immediately present can be made present 
memorially (RE-PRESENTATION). The unity ofthe person 
constitutes itself in acts that link "the present 1 and the 
past 1." "As my own person is constituted in primor-
dial mental acts, so the foreign person is constituted in 
empathically experienced acts." The other can be in-
tentionally present to the empathizing consciousness, 
but, like memories, in principle never primordially. 
In empathic intuition, the I can experience the 
other's every action as proceeding from a will mo-
tivated by feelings. Simultaneously, 1 am given the 
range of VALUES that the other can experience, which 
leads to expectations about the other's future volitions 
and actions. A single unitary consciousness can intend 
another ego stream that it constitutes as other than it-
self although never possibly present in the fullness of 
givenness. 
Another point to bear in mind concerning Stein 's 
work on empathy is that for her, as for Husserl and 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, recognition of the other is 
founded on perceptual, i.e., bodily experience. One 
lives one's own soov from the "inside" and sees one-
selfimaginatively from the "outside" as an object-other 
in a world of others. It is possible to see the other from 
the "outside" as well. My sensuous intuitions of the 
other's body and bodily incarnations in words and ges-
tures allow a kind of sui generis empathic cognition, 
based on perception, but not reducible to perceptual 
intuitions alone. My experience of the other's joy is 
non-primordial, albeit triggered by his or her primor-
dial experience. 1 may experience primordial j oy at my 
friend's success, i.e., 1 may rejoice with my friend, but 
according to the intentions evoked by my own motiva-
tions. 
Although Stein endorsed Scheler's criticism of 
THEODOR UPPS's theory of empathy, she was more crit-
ica! of Zur Phiinomenologie und Theorie der Sym-
pathiege.fuhle (On the phenomenology and theory of 
the feeling of sympathy, 1913) than she had been of 
Scheler's religious views. Her critique of this work 
caused Scheler, in his preface to the fourth edition, to 
credit Stein's criticism with leading him to distinguish 
between feelingin-common and fellow-feeling. This 
distinction establishes limits to shared experience so 
that the ethical principle ofthe inviolability ofpersons 
can be justified. Scheler spoke highly of Stein many 
times in his finallectures at Koln on empathy. 
As already mentioned, Stein worked on the 
manuscript to Ideen II and she and Husserl understood 
the constitutive function of empathy as demanding, in 
its basic structure, an incipient other whose otherness 
may be overtaken by empathy. Yet empathic connec-
tion must never be mistaken for identification with the 
other so that two ego streams fuse into an ontologically 
higher unity. Empathy can take the other's conscious-

EDITH STEIN 
681 
ness into its own only as a separate ego stream. After 
After her initial inability to habilitate at the univer-
ali, ifthe other is but an extension ofmyself, neither is 
empathy required nor can a coherent account be made 
of its everyday experience. 
Constitutively, empathy functions to reveal not only 
the in ner life of the other, but also the self as other to 
its others. Thus empathy provides a means to self-
knowledge vis-a-vis real differences between the self 
and the other, and such real differences circumscribe 
the arena of human freedom. The basic structure of 
empathic intentionality is such that the correlate ofany 
act may be strictly objective, focusing on an "exter-
na!" constitution, such as when I perceive the room 
as warm. On the other hand, when I take myself, the 
subject, as an object, I constitute myself as, e.g., un-
comfortable. Likewise, for a subject who empathizes 
with another, this other may become an individual with 
a character and a personality: one who feels injustices, 
enjoys children and riddles, loves truth, and so forth; 
the other can be constituted as a substrate of his or 
her acts through a focus of regard in which I intend to 
constitute the other as, like myself, a self constituted in 
its own motivations, habitualities, and sedimentations. 
My self-experience is a prerequisite for empathetically 
knowing the other; the degree to which I ha ve engaged 
in self-constitution determines the refinement of my 
potential understanding of the other. In her autobiog-
raphy Aus dem Leben einer jiidischen Familie (Life in 
a jewish family, 1965) Stein reftects on her early work 
on empathy, which led her "to something which was 
personally el o se to my heart and which continually oc-
cupied me anew in ali !ater work: the constitution of 
the human person." 
Although she was one of the earliest women stu-
dents in German universities, she was denied a uni-
versity post because of her gender despite her summa 
cum laude dissertation directed by Husserl. She sub-
sequently campaigned for and won a landmark ruling 
that women could not be denied habilitation on the ba-
sis of gender. She was given an opportunity to work 
as Dozent at the German Institute for Scientific Ped-
agogy in Mi.inster in 1932, but her appointment was 
not renewed the following year because of the rise 
of National Socialism. Her lifelong insistence on the 
equality of ali people and her refusal to acknowledge 
distinctions of caste or class stand in sharp contrast to 
her own experiences. 
sity level, she worked as a secondary school teacher at 
a convent school for girls in Speyer from 1922 to 1932. 
Although she felt a religious calling at the time ofher 
baptism, her spiritual advisor believed that she had 
work to do in the world. Her teaching situation caused 
her to think about women 's education as well as larger 
feminist concerns. Her strong sense of social responsi-
bility led her to an active participation in the struggle 
for women's suffrage as well as feminist theorizing in 
lectures and writings. She became the most important 
feminist in Germany, speaking to the Catholic intelli-
gentsia in German-speaking Europe between the wars. 
By 1932 Edith Stein was recognized as the intellectual 
leader of Catholic FEMINISM in Europe. 
Stein 's tripartite analysis ofwoman follows the gen-
eral structure she employs in her theory ofthe constitu-
tion ofthe person. The person is an individual essence. 
Persons may be grouped according to types, but each 
human being embodies the human essence in her own 
particular being. Also, the individual human essence is 
developed in freely chosen acts. No vocations can be 
closed to women since women and men may share the 
same talents. 
Her conviction that woman 's vocation included citi-
zenship inspired her to some guarded but unmistakable 
criticism for the condition of her country and Europe. 
In her semipopular speeches and writings for women 
educators and women students, collected as Die Frau 
(Woman, 1959), she encouraged ali women to follow 
their feminine nature and reject the depreciation ofthe 
value ofthe person. 
Edith Stein became a Carmelite only when it was 
no longer possible for her to publish or to work af-
ter Adolf Hilter became Reichskanzler on January 30, 
1933. After Erich Przwara, S.J. suggested that she write 
her autobiography, her early work on empathy began 
to suggest to her that writing about ordinary Jewish 
life might motivate fellow-feeling for the Jews among 
the Germans. It was this project that spawned Aus dem 
Leben einer jiidischen Familie, which she left unfin-
ished in favor of her philosophical study, Endliches 
und ewiges Sein (Finite and eterna! being, 1950), as 
well as her work on St. John ofthe Cross. 
Edith Stein was forty-two years old when she be-
came Sister Teresa Benedicta a Cruce, O.C.D. in 1934. 
Despite the widely held view that Stein's !ater theolog-

682 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ical work repudiates her earlier studies with Husserl, 
themes pertaining to REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY and 
even to EXISTENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGY strongly influ-
ence her version ofSt. Thomas Aquinas's philosophy. 
Her early translation of Aquinas's Disputed Questions 
on Truth into German proved to be quite controver-
sial. Her contribution to the Festschrift in honor of 
Husserl's seventieth birthday attempted a reconcili-
ation of Thomism and realistic phenomenology. In 
Endliches und ewiges Sein, completed in 1937, she 
defines finite being as "that which does not possess 
its being, but needs time in which to reach being," 
whereas infinite being "cannot end, because it is not 
given its being, but is in possession ofbeing, the mas-
ter ofbeing, even being itself." Thomistic teaching on 
act and potency may provide the starting point for this 
work, but its main concern is the search for the mean-
ing of being in a synthesis of medieval thought and 
phenomenology. 
The experience ofbeing supported by the supernat-
uralleads Stein to take issue with MARTIN HEIDEGGER 's 
emphasis on Angst (she refers to his work as the philos-
ophy of a bad conscience). Examining her own lived 
experience, she finds that anxiety is not the typical 
human experience; the normally dominant feeling is 
security, "as if our being was a certain possession." 
This sense of feeling oneself supported by being can-
not be accounted for by the uncertainties of life or the 
indubitability of death, but rather suggests a Being be-
yond beings that grounds beings: "in my being I meet 
another, which is not mine, but is support and ground 
ofmy unsupported and groundless being." 
In the same work, her analysis ofthe authentic life 
of the soul relies on phenomenological description of 
its "layers." This interest in the human person and its 
proper fulfillment which had initially shown itself in 
her earliest studies ofliterature and psychology, moved 
her to seek in Husserl 's phenomenology a science capa-
ble of grounding its system in conceptual clarity. Nev-
ertheless, her attraction to phenomenology began with 
and continued tobe her appreciation ofthe objectivity 
latent in it, which was for her- as for other Gottingen 
phenomenologists- their escape from Kantian sub-
jectivism and the German idealistic tradition. Despite 
their real and/or perceived philosophical differences, 
Husserl and Stein remained in contact over the years. 
He telegraphed his best wishes to her on the day of 
her investiture at the Koln Carmel. On hearing an ac-
count of her clothing ceremony (the Carmelite novice 
takes the habit of the order and can no Ion ger be seen 
except behind a grille), Husserl said, "Ido not believe 
that the Church has any neo-Scholastic ofEdith Stein 's 
quality." He regretted not having travelled to KOln and 
remarked to Sister Adelgunis, O.S.B., also one of his 
pupils, "I should have been the bride's father." "Every-
thing in her is utterly genuine, otherwise I should say 
that this step was romanticism. But -
down in Jews 
there is radicalism and love faithful unto martyrdom." 
Her superiors determined that she should continue 
her writing and assigned her various projects, includ-
ing her last major work, the Kreuzeswissenschaft (The 
science ofthe cross, 1960), which shows how her think-
ing was molded by her training in phenomenology. One 
learns the "science" ofthe Cross through personal ex-
perience of "the Cross," i.e., by accepting human suf-
fering and baptizing it with divine meaning. In some 
of her instructive works from the final period of her 
life, she describes the aim ofthe religious life as self-
forgetfulness in favor ofwhat might be seen as a kind 
of empathy with God Himself, taking on the "love of 
the divine heart" that "mourns with those who mourn, 
rejoices with the joyful, and puts itself at the service of 
every creature so that each creature becomes what the 
Father wishes it to be ... " Here also is an expression 
ofwomanly fulfillment in materna! nurturing. 
The experience ofGod's presence in the innermost 
being of the soul is the essence of the mystical expe-
rience of"meeting God as one person meets another." 
Stein could not complete the third part of the work 
commissioned to honorthe four hundredth anniversary 
of St. John of the Cross. She had fled the Carmelite 
convent in Koln-Lindenthal in 1938 into exile in a 
Carmelite community in Echt, The Nethcrlands. Her 
sanctuary in the Carmel at Echt was violated as part of 
a reprisal for the Catholic bishops' pastoralletter con-
demning the Nazi deportation ofthe Jews. Ali Catholic 
Jews were rounded up and sent east to Poland. On Au-
gust 9, 1942, one week about being removed from the 
Carmel, she died in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. 
Eye witness reports te li of Sister Benedicta 's own tran-
quility at this time and her concern for the bereaved 
women and their children. John Nota, S.J., who at-
tempted to get her manuscript Endliches und ewiges 
Sein published in The Netherlands after a typeset ver-

sion could not be printed in Germany in 1936 due 
to an anti-Semitic publishing ban, reported that "the 
fascinating thing about Edith Stein was that truth did 
not exist as an abstraction for her, but as something 
incamated in persons ... "For Edith Stein, philosophy 
and life were one. Like the earlier Carmelite mystic, St. 
John ofthe Cross, Edith Stein exemplifies herwritings.

STRUCTURALISM 
Like phenomenology, 
structuralism is more a method of analysis than a 
subject matter. Because of its origins in the HUMAN 
scJENCES, structuralism is usually considered a sci-
entific method that studies systems, relations, and 
forms, i.e., structures, or, in the more current des-
ignation, cades. Systems are phenomena that inter-
relate with one another according to a discover-
able logic usually expressed as a key relation and 
its transformations through deduction, induction, ab-
duction, adduction, etc. As a "here and now" phe-
nomenon, a system is usually contrasted with HIS-
TORY as "there and then." Familiar systemic re-
lations are similarity/difference (metaphor), oppo-
sition/apposition (simile; irony), part/whole (synec-
doche), substance/attribute (metonymy), self/other/-
world, cause/effect, space/time, quatitative/quantita-
tive, and form/content. Note that most relations are 
binary or trinary as a result of the system logic be-
ing used. In this structural context, eidetic phenomena 
are referred to as mentifacts or contents, while empiri-
ca! phenomena are specified as artifacts or forms. The 
structural method is closely associated with coMMUNI-
COLOGY, LANGUAGE, and sign systems, alt of which are 
viewed as systemcodes and are grouped together under 
the general name of semiotics ( or semiology) in current 
usage. 
While semiotics now has an international scope, 
structuralism as a doctrine is popularly known because 
its French origins in the 1960s. As Vincent Descombes 
suggested in 1980, there are basically three histori-
cal and philosophical progressions of "structuralism": 
structural analysis, structuralism per se, and semiotics.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
Given current developments, two more categories need 
to be added: poststructuralism and phenomenological 
structuralism. These types of "structuralism" are dis-
tinguished by their ontologica! (systemic) and episte-
mological (relational) orientations toward cultural phe-
nomena in consciousness (contents or mentifacts) and 
in experience (forms or artifacts). 
( 1) Structural analysis refers to the various schools 
of anthropology and especially linguistics that rejected 
a diachronic (historical) approach to analyzing speech 
(parole) as a series of events, in fa vor of a synchronic 
approach to language (langue) as a present moment in 
a system. The diachronic relation is temporal and sig-
nifies a linear progression of change over time that is 
historical, whereas the synchronic relation is an atem-
poral relation that signifies a reflexive moment existing 
at the present time. In short, the diachronic expresses 
a "then" relation, while the synchronic expresses a 
"now" relation. The parallel spatial system expresses 
a syntagmatic relation of "there," whereas a paradig-
matic relation expresses a position of"here." 
Having made these distinctions, we must take ac-
count of a disciplinary anomaly in linguistics, i.e., 
the diachronic approach is called American structural-
ism (the Bloomfieldian school) and the synchronic 
approach is known as European structuralism (the 
Moscow, Prague, and Copenhagen Cireles). The Amer-
ican tradition is grounded in the work of Franz Boas 
( 1858-1942), especially as discussed in his major work 
Race, Language, and Cu/ture (1940). In addition, it 
was Boas who founded The International Journal of 
American Linguistics, which brought together the par-
allel work of Edward Sapir ( 1884--1939) and Leonard 
Bloomfield ( 1887-1939). Contemporary work in this 
context is best illustrated by Noam Chomsky's many 
publications on the place of syntax in language-use. 
The European tradition follows the work of Fer-
dinand de Saussure (1857-1913), who is commonly 
held to be the undisputed founder of modern linguis-
tics. The principal formulation in Cours de linguistique 
generale ( 1916), for which Saussure is most famous, 
is his system definition ofthe sign (S) as a synchronic 
relation composed of two elements: (a) the signifier 
(Sr) or signţfYing eidetic element that we understand 
as the linguistic concept ( content ), and (b) the signi-
fied (Sd) or empirica! element that we comprehend as 
the linguistic sound-image (form). Saussure offered the 
following formula: 
Sr 
S = Sd. 
Further, he argued that the systemic operation of signs 
was both (a) arbitrary and (b) conventional in the so-
cial use oflanguage (langue). Thus the study ofspeak-
ing (parole) was condemned as diachronic and of sec-
ondary importance. 
Among the important contributors to the Saussurian 
model are the members of the Moscow linguistic cir-
ele (1915-21), ineluding ROMAN JAKOBSON, WhO wrote 
no major book, but left an extensive research corpus. 
The cirele also ineluded Husserl 's student, GUSTA V SPET. 
This Moscow group set the interdisciplinary tone for 
the birth of structuralism by combining the study of 
linguistics with that of poetics, metrics, and folklore, 
along with logic and philosophy. 
Also important to the Saussurian tradition was 
the Prague Linguistic Circle founded in 1926 by Jan 
Mukarosky (1891-1975) and others, ineluding the no-
table French members Emile Benveniste (1902-1976) 
and Andre Martinet, and again Roman Jakobson, a 
Russian emigre. Finally, the Copenhagen Linguistic 
Cirele marked its beginning with the publication of 
the first issue of Acta Linguistica in 1939. It contained 
a manifesta by Viggo Brondal (1887-1942) entitled 
"Structural Linguistics." It is important to note that 
Brondal's artiele advocated a phenomenological cor-
rection to the dominant formalist theory of the cir-
ele !ater articulated in Omkring sprogteoriens grund-
loeggelse (Prolegomena to a theory oflanguage, 1943) 
by Louis Hjelmslev (1899-1965) as glossematics, i.e., 
a formal homology between expression and content in 
Ianguage. Hjelmslev's theory may be formalized as an 
extension ofthe Saussure model: 
S = Sr/Sd/ /Sr/Sd 
with these definitions: 
Sign = 
Expression-Substance 
Expression-Form 
Content-Form

sion and divides itself semiotically into an eidetic Sr 
form and Sd substance. The signified is now called 
the content and semiotically divides into an empirica! 
Sr .form and Sd substance. Hjelmslev's key relation 
is the notion of dependence/independence that occurs 
between phenomena. It is in this context that Brondal 
suggested, against Hjelmslev's deductive formalism, 
that "Husserl's penetrating meditations on phenomen-
ology will in this case be a source of inspiration for 
every logician of language." 
It must be noted that as Brondal suspected, Hjelm-
slev's Prolegomena was a failure as a deductive sys-
tem for language, but viewed as an abduction, it has 
provided the standard vocabulary and model used in 
communicology to describe the operation of animal, 
human, and machine communication systems. In this 
respect, Hjelmslev's greatest inftuence has been on the 
semiotic theories of Algirdas J. Greimas ( 1917-1991) 
and the Paris school of semiotics and, in part, on the 
theory of Umberto Eco; both theorists ha ve had an es-
pecially notable international impact on the study of 
aesthetic texts in the mass media. 
(2) Structuralism per se refers to the theory of signs 
as a specification of structural analysis in the human 
sciences where there is an emphasis on the description 
ofwhole systems. The goal is a new theory ofmeaning 
based on significations generated by various system-
codes including language and discourse, kinship, and 
economic exchange. A major intellectual confrontation 
developed inasmuch as structuralism in the tradition of 
Saussure opposed the tradition of Husserl as it was 
taken up and transformed in French phenomenology. 
In particular, structuralism offered itself as a major al-
ternative on the French scene to the post-World War 
II popularity ofEXISTENTIALISM, especially that of JEAN-
PAUL SARTRE. The failure of existentialism as social and 
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY encouraged the scientific expli-
cations of structural analysis. The ensuing intellectual 
debate was a straightforward opposition between the 
"new" structuralist concept of difference embodied in 
language as a system defining society -
a text-code 
(i.e., grammatology) perspective-and the "old" EXIS-
TENTIAL PHENOMENOLOGICAL concept of identity embod-
ied in speaking as a system defining the person -
an 
embodied discourse perspective. The period of struc-
turalism 's popularity roughly began with the publica-
tion of Andre Martinet's La linguistique synchronique 
in 1949 and climaxed with the appearance of Claude 
Levi-Strauss's Anthropologie structurale (1958) and 
La pensee sauvage (The savage mind, 1962), the 1at-
ter dedicated to MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY. Rather than 
a mere gesture, the dedication and the preface to La 
pensee sauvage remind us ofthe influential phenomen-
ological critique and revision ofSaussure that Merleau-
Ponty offers in his essays of this period, published as 
Signes ( 1960). 
(3) Semiotics or semiology refers to the theory of 
signs as a linguistic specification of structural analysis 
in philosophy and the human sciences where there is 
an emphasis on relations. In this modified version of 
structuralism, the revised goal is a theory of meaning 
based on signification generated in the first instance by 
discourse. While Saussure had argued that semiotics 
was the whole and linguistics o ne of the parts, semi-
oticians contended that linguistics was the origin and 
semiotics was the derived science. French semiotics 
carne into focus with the publication of Elements de 
semiologie in 1964 by Roland Barthes (1915-1980) 
and &mantique structurale: Recherche de methode 
in 1966 by Greimas. Barthes essentially adapted the 
Hjelmslevian model of structural analysis to literary 
and cultural criticism by discounting problems ofform 
in fa vor of relations and systems. He at once moved 
away from the inftuence of empirica! science and to-
ward philosophical issues of concern by making semi-
ology a "creative activity" in literary science. His stud-
ies of mythology, rhetoric, and ideology ha ve been a 
major force in the popularity of structuralism both in-
side and outside the academic world. The toute Paris 
popularity of structuralism thus carne to displace that 
of existentialism in public discourse. 
As a counterbalance to the Barthes model, Grei mas 
constructed a model that he called the semiotic square. 
The model articulated in his book Semiotique ( 1979) 
uses relations of contradiction, contrariety, and com-
plementarity to specify a generational category of 
meaning at one ofthree levels of semantic signification. 
In more familiar usage, Barthes names these levels con-
notation, denotation, and the real, while Jacques Lacan 
in the psychoanalytical context refers to them as the 
symbolic, the imaginary, and the real. Greimas argues 
that at a third (reality) level of semantic generation, 
a combinatory "both/and" relation between contrary 
terms creates MEANING, and, coincidentally, confirms 

686 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
the work of Brăndal in bridging the logic of pheno-
menology with that of structuralism. 
The most extensive expression of the connection 
between phenomenology and structuralism is Roman 
Jakobson 's theory of communication and his model 
of the human sciences, which incorporates much of 
Husserl 's phenomenology in the explication of lin-
guistics as a complex eidetic and empirica! science. 
For the moment, suffice it to say that Jakobson also 
advocates a hierarchical model of the human sciences 
grounded in 1 inguistics-remembering that for Jakob-
son, spoken language is an inherently existential and 
embodied human capacity. The graphic model begins 
with linguistics as the study of verbal messages at the 
center with a second circle containing semiotics as a 
contextual extension for the study of any messages. 
A third circle contains the anthropological science of 
communication, which is the domain of implied mes-
sages in social anthropology and economics. A fourth 
circle specifying the message systems of living or-
ganisms as the biologica! science of communication 
completes the model. Jakobson's model became quite 
popular in France, then in the United Kingdom and 
the United States, with the explication of his theory 
in the "Que sais-je?" book series publication of La 
semiologie ( 1971) by Pierre Guiraud. This book cov-
ers the full range of semiotic concems from language 
and sign systems to logica! and aesthetic codes as well 
as the mass media and social practices. 
There is also an American school of semiotics based 
on the work ofthe philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce 
(1839-1914), but Peirce's work is neither related to 
American structural linguistics nor to the European 
tradition of structuralism. Nonetheless, Peirce has had 
a major impact on contemporary semiotics, especially 
the work ofUmberto Eco. A major connection between 
semiotics and phenomenology exists in Peirce's work 
and has been studied in recent years by Karl-Otto Apel. 
(4) Poststructuralism also refers to the theory of 
signs as a discursive specification of structural analy-
sis in philosophy and the human sciences where there 
is an emphasis on contents andforms. As such, post-
structuralism is largely a critique of classical pheno-
menology and semiology. A fundamental distinction is 
made between discourse (parole; langue), which is the 
verbal utterance or stating (MI CHEL FOUCAULT's enonce) 
of a message-as-code, and language (langage), which 
is the empirica! manifestation of a code-as-message 
or enonciation. In both cases, note that the simplis-
tic hypostatization of a message or code gives way to 
the realistic notion that both messages and codes are 
interconnected (Jakobson 's poetic function) and mutu-
ally motivated (Martinet's double articulation) as one 
phenomenon. In short, the phenomena of discourse are 
simultaneously eidetic in content (i.e., codes), while 
those of language are empirica!, hen ce a form of mes-
sage. While this distinction may at first seem illogical, 
recall the Hjelmselvian model where we can view dis-
course as an Sr relation of expression containing its 
own substance and form. In turn, language is an Sd 
relation of content available to perception as another 
substance and form. Thus the combination of discourse 
and language is the actual phenomenon (a) ofwhich we 
are noetically conscious and (b) that we noematically 
experience in the "here and now" moment of human 
communication. 
In the medieval sense of the trivium, we might il-
lustrate the distinction by saying that for discourse, ex-
pression (message-code) is a combination of rhetoric 
or stating as the substance and the statement or speak-
ing as the actual form, just as grammar is expressed in 
the text or writing, and logic is expressed in the propo-
sition or thinking. While rhetoric, grammar, and logic 
have basically the same eidetic substance (persuasion, 
information, reflection, etc., as expression), they are 
different empirica! forms of expression. 
In turn, for perception in language ( code-message ), 
content is a combination of listening as the form and 
rhetoric as the substance, i.e., narratology. In parallel 
fashion, READING offers a sense of grammar as gram-
matology, while judging constructs a logic or semiotic. 
The method of structural analysis for this poststruc-
turalist approach to research is called deconstruction. 
While largely an applied method in literary criticism, 
especially in the United States, deconstruction as a 
theory in the human sciences oras a philosophical po-
sition is usually associated with the French theorists 
in a number of CULTURAL DISCIPLINES. Among others, 
these include Louis Althusser (Marxism), Michel Fou-
cault (systems ofthought; history), Gilles Deleuze and 
Jacques Lacan (psychoanalysis), and JACQUES DERRIDA 
(philosophy). Recalling the Saussurian definition of 
the sign as the combination ofboth a signifier (expres-
sion) and a signified (perception), deconstructionists 

STRUCTURALISM 
687 
focus their analysis exclusively on the signifier as a 
content or form, while dismissing the relevance ofthe 
signified as a socially determined referent in a sign 
system. Hence the emphasis is upon discourse to the 
exclusion of language. The synchronic ("now") and 
paradigmatic ("here") interplay of contents and forms 
as a vehicle of expression is pushed to its outer limits 
so that the politically and socially dominant language 
(langage) is critiqued and ruptured by the discourse in 
the emergent text or practice. Simply put, the opposi-
tion between a message-as-code (parole) and a code-
as-message (langue) is transformed into an apposition. 
That is to say, an opposition counterpoises one thing 
against another as different ( e.g., a binary relation of 
expression versus perception), which is the diacritical 
function of language as information, i.e., an either/or 
choice in a pregiven context. But an apposition coun-
terpoises two parallel, but similar, phenomena ( e.g., 
both expression and perception) to a third referent 
phenomenon ( e.g., a triadic relation of embodiment 
as perception and expression), which is the combina-
tory function of discourse as communication, i.e., a 
both/and choice of a new context. 
Unlike other approaches to discourse analysis, de-
construction aims to articulate a space for this apposi-
tion in such a way that any existential or social refer-
ence point is lost to the auditor ofthe text or practice. In 
this sense, deconstruction utilizes the rhetorical, gram-
matological, or tropic logic of relations to confront 
systems with their own constituent contents and forms. 
However, the poststructuralist dislocation and decen-
tering of the speaking subject, the writing author, and 
the thinking philosopher as a result ofthe deconstruc-
tionist method has in itself provoked a structuralist 
response by phenomenologists. 
(5) Phenomenological structuralism refers in the 
first instance to Roman Jakobson 's phenomenological 
revisions of structuralist linguistics and semiotics in 
the European tradition. The same theoretical point has 
been made by the linguist-psychoanalystJulia Kristeva 
and the semiotician Umberto Eco. Jakobson's theory 
of discourse and language is based upon two basic 
concepts about the eidetic and empirica! features of 
human communication as a semiotic practice. 
First, the concept of distinctive features is a phono-
logical description of how sounds combine paradig-
matically (vertical substitution) with one another tobe 
recognizable in communication. There are the inher-
ent sound features of sonority, protensity, and tonality, 
together with the prosodic features of force, quantity, 
and tone. Distinctive features in a generalized sense 
function to manifest certain paradigmatic relations of 
conjunction such that when we compare or contrast two 
phenomena, we do so with a both/and analogue logic of 
inclusi an. As Jakobson suggests, a metaphoric relation 
is created in which selection, substitution, and simi-
larity determine a meaningful unit that is synchronic 
(existential). Simply put, distinctive features combine 
two phenomena so as to display the positive opposition 
(distinction) that each phenomenon possesses when 
placed in conjunction. Similarity (both/and relation) 
in expression causes a difference (either/or relation) 
in perception. Our ability to change any noun for any 
other noun in a sentence and understand the difference 
between the two forms of the sentences based on the 
similarity of their content illustrates this relationship. 
The process also occurs when a speaker's meaning 
and a listener's understanding are linked by the same 
cognitive proposition. 
Second, the concept of redundancy features is a 
phonological description of how sounds join syntag-
matically (horizontal combination) with one another 
to become recognizable in communication. In this 
case, an either/or digital logic of exclusion creates a 
metonymic relation of combination, contexture, and 
contiguity that is diachronic (historical). In short, re-
dundancy features combine two phenomena so as to 
display the apposition (redundancy) that each phe-
nomenon possesses with reference to a third phe-
nomenon. Difference (either/or relation) in expression 
causes similarity (both/and relation) in perception. For 
example, our ability to change any statement into a 
question and understand the difference between the 
two forms of the sentences based on the similarity of 
their content illustrates this relationship. The process 
also occurs when a speaker's meaning and a listener's 
understanding are linked by the difference between the 
utterance as spoken and as heard, or as intended versus 
spoken (e.g., Freud's "slip ofthe tongue"). 
Last, it is important to note the poeticfunction built 
into ali messages, namely that the paradigmatic and 
syntagmatic features are reversible. That is to say, 
a cade or metalinguistic function operates such that 
distinctive and redundancy features are the context 

688 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
of choice for each other. In this sense, system-codes 
are always motivated and constitutive. Or put another 
way that is important both to a poststructuralist and 
phenomenological structuralist perspective, a choice-
of-context apposition as a transformation always mo-
tivates ( occurs first) a context-of-choice opposition as 
a constitution or formation ( occurs second). One of 
the best examples of this type of analysis that applies 
and extends Jakobson 's phenomenological structural-
ism in a contemporary context is the theory of auto-
communication suggested by Yuri M. Lotman. This 
theory 1 inks the existential perception of the person to 
the universal expression of cultural values in the prac-
tice ofhuman communication. Chaim Perelman and L. 
Olbechts-Tyteca offer a parallel model of rhetoric as 
the universal practice of discourse. 
Phenomenological structuralism in a more general 
sense refers to various modifications of Husserlian 
phenomenology, most notably by MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY and MI CHEL FOUCAULT, as existential and semiotic 
phenomenology. The theory suggested by Merleau-
Ponty in his essays on speech and language paral-
lels that of Roman Jakobson, namely that signs are 
(a) motivated rather than arbitrary and (b) constitu-
tive rather than conventional or regulati ve. These signs 
in their multiplicity are the embodiment of human 
expression and perception that Merleau-Ponty des-
ignates and illustrates with the conscious experience 
of human speaking and gesture in his major work, 
Phenomenologie de la perception (1945). A similar 
approach is the focused study of communication in 
GEORGES GUSDORF's La parole (Speaking, 1953) and 
more recently in FRANCIS JACQUEs' Difference et sub-
jectivite: Anthropologie d 'un point de vue relationnel 
(1982). 
Following his teacher Merleau-Ponty, the theme of 
semiotic phenomenology also emerges in Michel Fou-
cault's famous quadrilateral model of le meme et l 'autre 
that translates as both self/other and same/different. 
Foucault's corpus should be viewed as (a) a pheno-
menological examination of subject matter contextual-
ized by (b) a structural view of that subject matter that 
progresses from (i) contents and forms to (ii) relations 
and on to (c) system-codes. Foucault views discourse 
as a contest (agon) between subject and abject, and 
between power and desire in language and other so-
cial practices. The conscious experience of stating or 
speaking ( enonce) discourse is the contest between 
the subject/object phenomenon and yet the practice of 
articulating or uttering (enonciation) language is the 
contest between the power/desire phenomenon. Such 
discourse/language is the problematic that is studied by 
the method of archaeology, a concept borrowed from 
Merleau-Ponty. As a first level of analysis (i.e., con-
tents and forms in a system-code ), archaeology com-
pares and contrasts the subject/object expression over 
against the power/desire perception. The method is 
discussed most notably in Foucault's Les mots et les 
choses (Words and things, 1966 [translated as The Or-
der of Things]) and his L 'archeologie du savior (The 
archaeology ofknowledge, 1969). 
Foucault further developed his method of analysis 
by suggesting a second level of investigation (i.e., re-
lations in a system-code) that he called the method 
of genealogy, a concept taken from Nietzsche. In this 
context, the subject/power relation is explored as the 
concept ofunderstanding or "know-how" (savoir), and 
then the objectldesire relation is examined as the no-
tion ofknowledge or "knowing about" ( connaissance ). 
While this genealogical method is most apparent in 
Foucault's many studies of institutional practice in such 
areas as medical diagnosis, the penal system, and so-
cial deviance, the theoretical discussion ofthe method 
is best articulated in his three volume L 'historie de la 
sexualite (1976--84). 
As a third methodological level of analysis (i.e., 
the system in the system-code), Foucault suggests in 
L 'ordre du discourse ( 1971) that the methods of ar-
chaeology (diachronic and syntagmatic) and geneal-
ogy (synchronic and paradigmatic) are reversible as a 
context for one another, thus establishing a method of 
criticism. Hence Foucault adopts the poetic function 
principle suggested by Roman Jakobson. 
As a clarification ofthe many crossovers and coun-
terinfluences that characterize structuralism, semiotics, 
and phenomenology, the following summary may be 
helpful. In the discussion, keep in mind that a com-
munication medium is discourse or practice, while a 
communication channel is a language or performance 
in the conscious experience ofpeople. 
First, structuralism is the general view that the pro-
cess of communication is a practice (system) in which 
a human group (society) is the medium of communica-
tion for any given channel, such as language, kinship, 

STRUCTURALISM 
689 
commerce, etc. Individual performance is a represen-
tation of practice (relation), while group performance 
is a relationship that is signification per se ( contents 
and forms). 
Second, semiotics maintains the view that the pro-
cess of communication is a performance in which 
an individual person is the medium of communica-
tion (system), e.g., speaker/listener, writer/reader, sub-
ject/object, etc., for culture as the channel of commu-
nication (relation), as suggested by Kristeva. Here the 
group practice is a representation of individual per-
formance (content) and practice is a relationship that 
signifies (form). 
Third, phenomenology is the perspective that the 
process of communication, as meaning, is a presen-
tation of performance in which the person (system) 
is the embodied channel of communication (relation) 
for given practices (content) ofrepresentation such as 
speaking, interacting, sharing, etc., that are the media 
of communication (forms). For the phenomenologist, 
performance is the practice of human being, i.e., the 
performance comprises the embodied practice of ex-
istential meaning, e.g., Merleau-Ponty's explication of 
gesture.

TECHNOLOGY 
Philosophy of technology, 
as distinct from philosophy of NATURAL SCIENCE, is a 
relatively new arrival within contemporary philosoph-
ical subspecializations. Its historical roots, also distinct 
from those in the philosophy of science, are largely de-
rived from severa! European traditions including neo-
HEGELIANISM, MARXISM, CRITICAL THEORY, and EXISTEN-
TIAL PHENOMENOLOGY, as well as HERMENEUTIC AL PHENO-
MENOLOGY and American pragmatism. Philosophy of 
science, in contrast, became dominated early by LOGI-
CAL EMPIRICIST and ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHICAL traditions, 
particularly in English-speaking countries. 
CARL MITCHAM, the most thorough historian and bib-
Iiographer of the philosophy of technology, contends 
in Thinking Through Technology (1994) that there are 
two dominant directions in the philosophy oftechnol-
ogy: the engineering and the humanities directions. 
The oldest work actually bearing the title Grundlinien 
einer Philosophie der Technik was authored by a neo-
Hegelian, Emst Kapp, in 1877. But it was not un tii the 
interstice between the world wars that philosophy of 
technology in its contemporary sense could be said to 
ha ve begun, and then the two most prominent ancestors 
were MARTIN HEIDEGGER in Europe and John Dewey in 
the United States. It was primarily through Heidegger 
that philosophy oftechnology received its phenomen-
ological rootage. 
Although it was clearly Heidegger who brought 
technology to the forefront as a philosophical theme, 
some intimations are also traceable to the founder 
of phenomenology in its technical sense, EDMUND 
HUSSERL. But intimations are ali that can be claimed. 
Husserl's own concems map much more closely upon 
traditions that are consonant with the theory prefer-
ences of classical philosophy of science. And although 
CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY can aJso be termed "ex-
istential" with its emphasis upon PERCEPTION and even 
more thoroughly upon BODY with respect to the consti-
tution ofknowledge, Husserl himselfpays little direct 
attention to the incorporation oftechnologies into per-
ceptual and bodily schemata. The most notable excep-
tion, and certainly a pregnant one, is the recognition of 
the ro le of writing in the constitution of a progressively 
layered LIFEWORLD. Yet for the most part, and even in 
the Die Krisis der europăischen Wissenscha.ften und 
die transzendentale Phănomenologie ( 1936), Husserl 's 
major focus remains fixed upon the movement from 
very simple practices toward increasing idealizations 
in the construction of natural science. His treatment of 
Galileo, for example, focuses almost exclusively upon 
the way Galileo mathematizes science and hen ce drives 
early modern science in an abstractive and idealizing 
trajectory away from embodied perception. He thus 
misses the equally important ro le that instrumentation 
(technology) plays in the Galilean praxis. The use of 
equipment is seldom mentioned in ARON GURWITSCH's 
work and that there are some thoughts about technol-
ogy in ALFRED SCHUTz's work has only recently been 
noticed. 
Even earlier than the Krisis, there had been severa! 
simultaneous movements in German philosophy that 
foreshadowed the !ater philosophy of technology. In 
1927, for example, the neo-Kantian Friedrich Dessauer 
(1881-1963) published Philosophie der Technik, an 
early work in the engineering tradition, which nev-
ertheless still maintained the primacy of theory over 
practice. It was in marked contrast to both Dessauer 
and Husserl that Martin Heidegger's early Sein und 
Zeit ( 1927) could be noted as paradigmatically revolu-
tionary in initiating contemporary philosophy oftech-
nology in its phenomenological sense. 
The model for what was !ater to develop into a more 
full-blown philosophy of technology was the analy-
sis of tool use in his discussion of entities encoun-
tered in the environment. First, Heidegger argued that 
readiness-to-hand experientially precedes the kind Of 
objectification that becomes presence-at-hand, which 
is equivalent to placing praxis as prior to theory. This 
pre-theoretical experience is precisely what occurs in 
tool use, and under this mode of experience the tool is 
not experienced as an object, but as a means by which 
some praxical ACTION within the environment is under-
taken. Then, in a model ofphenomenological analysis, 
Heidegger shows not only how the tool "withdraws" in 
experience, but also how it belongs to a context of in-
volvements. The praxical experience of tools, then, is

TECHNOLOGY 
691 
a kind of tacit knowledge, not necessarily conceptual, 
but bodily engaged with an environment. 
The !ater Heidegger subsequently went on to make 
technology a central theme ofhis philosophy. Modem 
scientific technology, indeed, was the outcome of the 
Westem metaphysical tradition. The !ater interpreta-
tiau of technology- for example, in "Die Frage nach 
dem Technik" (The question concerning technology, 
1954) -
was one that argued ( 1) for the ontologica! 
priority oftechno1ogy over science; (2) for technology 
tobe seen as a way of revealing rather than some mere 
collection of artifacts used by subjects; and (3) for the 
totality oftechnology tobe seen as a way of enframing 
Nature itself as a type of"standing reserve" (Bestand). 
Ali of these themes had already occurred in the tool 
analysis insofar as praxis precedes theory, tools relate 
Dasein to a world, and in the process the tool "with-
draws" or ceases to be an abject- and, one can say, 
the engagement is one that presupposes what is acted 
upon as a kind of use-reserve for Dasein. But only in 
the !ater Heidegger is modern technology totalized as 
a metaphysical view. 
In another context, MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY cou]d 
be said to have followed a similar trajectory with 
respect to human embodiment and tool use. In his 
Phimomenologie de la perception ( 1945), Merleau-
Ponty argued that tools such as the blind man's cane 
are experienced as the extensions of the sooY. The 
embodied subject's experience of embodiment is ex-
tended through the cane and engages the environment 
through the artifact, a position held by MAX SCHELER 
in Uber Ressentiment (On ressentiment, 1912), the 
French translation ofwhich was reviewed by the young 
Merleau-Ponty. Again the artifact becomes partially 
transparent and taken into the "body-subject." But un-
like Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty did not go on to make 
such incorporated artifactual experiences into an appli-
cation to technologies as such. JEAN-PAUL SARTRE's con-
tributions to the philosophy oftechnology are marginal 
but not uninteresting. 
Technology was of serious philosophical interest 
to many philosophers in the years before and after 
World War Il, and virtually every major Continen-
tal thinker had something to say about it. Nicolas 
Berdyaev (1874-1948), ORTEGA Y GASSET, Ernst Junger 
( 1895-1984 ), KARL JASPERS, and Jacques Ellul ali wrote 
about the technologization of contemporary life, but 
Heidegger remained the primary phenomenologically 
oriented and most systematic ofthese thinkers. 
By the late 1960s and early 1970s, a number of 
North American philosophers began to adapt pheno-
menological themes in the analysis oftechnology. Us-
ing published books as a benchmark, o ne ofthe earliest 
thematic and serious attempts to apply phenomenology 
to techno]ogy was HUBERT DREYFUS's What Comput-
ers Can 't Do: A Critique of Artţficial Reason ( 1972). 
He applied insights of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, and 
Heidegger to the then burgeoning "ARTIFICIAL INTEL-
LIGENCE" programs that began with radical extrapola-
tions ofwhat such programs could do. Dreyfus showed 
that the weaknesses of such programs revolved around 
(!) the computer program's failure to recognize pat-
terns and gestalts, common perceptual achievements 
in humans and animals; (2) the failure to deal with 
open contexts, again a characteristic of any LIFEWORLD 
in contrast to any closed system; and (3) the failure 
tobe motile. In short, he argued, in Merleau-Pontyan 
style, that computers cannot "think" because they do 
not have (Jived) bodies. Here was a direct application 
of the phenomenological primacy of PERCEPTION, em-
bodiment, and motile action as the hasis ofknowledge 
to an important aspect of contemporary technology. 
Dreyfus bas continued this work into the present with 
a series of publications and has spawned, indirectly, 
a whole generation of computer designers who have 
taken his critiques seriously. 
The first book that explicitly identified itself as a 
philosophy oftechnology and appeared in a major phi-
Josophy of science series was DON IHDE 's Technics and 
Praxis: A Philosophy ofTechnology ( 1979). That work 
opens with a four-chapter sequence in a "phenomen-
ology of instrumentation." Here a phenomenological 
analysis, based upon both a Husserlian and a Heideg-
gerian version of INTENTIONALITY, undertakes to differ-
entiate different structural modes ofhuman-technology 
relations. lhde shows that embodiment relations -
a 
term that he uses to capture the previous analyses of 
Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty for tool uses as noted 
above- are relations in which embodied human per-
ception symbiotically takes into itselfthe artifact used. 
But in addition to such relations, Ihde describes 
other types of human-technology relations, includ-
ing hermeneutica! relations that are more LANGUAGE-
oriented or quantitatively designed and less perceptu-

692 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
ally direct (such as those found in the use of instru-
ment panels or other types of display instrumentation) 
and background relations that are environmental and 
taken-for-granted technological contexts not explictly 
brought to the foreground in experience (such as living 
in the presence of automatic heating or lighting ma-
chinery). Ihde has continued this development through 
a series of subsequent books, the most systematic of 
which is Technology and the Lifeworld (1990). 
PATRICK HEELAN's Space Perception and the Philos-
ophy of Science (1983) comes more directly from the 
philosophy of science. But although this work is more 
focused upon the construction ofscientific knowledge, 
it incorporates significant phenomenological analysis 
of instrument uses as well. His variant upon the bod-
ily, perceptual, and praxis emphasis therein consists 
in hermeneuticizing the process more fully. He argues 
that instruments are "readable technologies" that in-
corporate and become equivalent to the perceivable, 
thus yielding a horizonal and hermeneutica! realism to 
scientific knowledge. 
From the 1980s into the present, there has begun 
to appear a rather wide range of studies of tech-
nology drawing upon phenomenological resources. 
These studies are notably Heideggerian for the most 
part. For example, the work most directly descended 
from this tradition is Technology and the Character 
of Contemporary Life ( 1984 ), by ALBERT BORGMANN. 
This analysis of contemporary life is one in which 
Borgmann draws a strong distinction between a "de-
vice paradigm" and "foca! activities." Technological 
devices, Borgmann argues, may often disrupt previ-
ous human engagements with an environment and thus 
disengage humans. Automatic heating machinery dis-
places the hearth, while the latter technology engages 
a whole series ofactivities that caii upon direct human 
engagement. Borgmann argues for a reform of tech-
nologies that would introduce more foca! activities to 
reengage basic human actions. 
MICHAEL HEIM analyzes word processing in his Elec-
tric Language: A Philosophical Study ofWord Process-
ing (1987). Again, often Heideggerian in tone, Heim 
takes account of the way word processing has altered 
the process ofwriting. And while he cites Heidegger's 
distinct dislike for even typewriters (which degrade 
the "hand") and argues in part for word processing po-
tentially being destructive of "books," it is apparent 
that Heim 's own stance is more one of a love/hate re-
Jationship with computers. He subsequently takes his 
technological inquiry into virtual reality as well with 
The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality ( 1993 ). 
ROBERT CREASE, again related to philosophy of sci-
ence concerns, nevertheless takes a phenomenologi-
cally oriented inquiry into the ro le of experiment. His 
The Play of Nature (1993) examines the primacy of 
praxis in large-scale experiments in the recent history 
ofscience. 
At present, the philosophy oftechnology is rapidly 
becoming recognized as a serious subspecialization 
within philosophy. It is pluralist in approach, but 
within its pluralism the strands of phenomenological 
approaches are more obvious and dominant than in 
cognate areas, such as the philosophy of science.

THEATER 
In order for any extremely com-
plex, multilayered, and multifaceted higherorder ex-
perience, such as AESTHETIC experience, experience of 
RELIGION, or experience of POLITICS, to be examined 
phenomenologically, the more basic phenomenologies 
of PERCEPTION, the IMAGINATION, MEMORY, and EMOTION 
will already have to have been accomplished. This is 
because higher-order experiences bring into play ali of 
the powers, ali ofthe expectancies and resources ofthe 
individual at once, ali together, in very complex ways. 
Just as the power of speech uses bodily organs, each 
with its own specific function distinct from LANGUAGE, 
for the purposes of linguistic expression, so also re-
ligious experience, for instance, brings into play not 
just one or two emotions, one or two human needs 
and powers, but ali of them at once. This is certainly 
nowhere more complicated than in what goes under 
the name of aesthetic experience. So it comes as no 
surprise that extensive phenomenologies of aesthetic 
experience in general, of literary experience, or ofthe-
atrical experience are hard to achieve and few have 
been undertaken. 
A great playwright, like a great novelist, creates 
different imaginary worlds, situated in different frame-
works oftime and space, ali with their own consistency 
and coherence as possible worlds, which we can enter 
and leave at will, to which we can retum, from which 
we can leam more and more, which we can reenact 
again and again in real time and space without ever be-
ing able to exhaust them. These worlds of experience 
fumish us with endless possibilities for the phenomen-
ological examination of experience. 
But the phenomenological literature on these sub-
jects is up to now very restricted. As regards the pheno-
menology of the theater even ROMAN INGARDEN, in his 
two magisterial tomes on Das literarische Kuntswerk 
( 1931) and Vom Erkennen des literarischen Kunstwerk 
(Cognition of the literary work of art, 1968), mentions 
the theater only incidentally, as being "a borderline 
case of the literary work of art'' precisely because it 
involves, over and above the language of the text of 
the theatrical play itself, the actual peiformance ofthe 
text, a matter he does not address. 
Only JEAN-PAUL SARTRE among the major phenome-
nologists has written systematically on the theater. This 
is in a series of scattered and occasional articles that 
provide us with the outline of his theory. He was an 
authentic disciple of EDMUND HUSSERL in his extremely 
nuanced understanding ofthe phenomenologies of per-
ception and imagination that he took from Husserl's 
chef-d' oeuvre, Ideen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie 
und phănomenologische Philosophie I (1913 ), and 
these play a central role in ali his major philosoph-
ical and theatrical writings. Sartre is one of the few 
major philosophers in history to write short stories, 
novels, and plays as well as technical works of philo-
sophical argument. Moreover, like only a handful of 
playwrights, including Pirandello and Brecht, Sartre 
held a theory of acting, which he exemplifies in his 
own plays. He focuses on the phenomenological prob-
lem ofthe enactment of a text. 
Sartre bases his theory of the theater on a theory of 
acting, of role-playing in everyday life and in the the-
ater. To begin on the commonsense level, any specifi-
cally human act has moral and even legal implications; 
it is an act for which a person is responsible, for which 
he or she is held accountable, for praise or for blame. It 
is an act deliberately and freely done with some knowl-
edge ofthe consequences. In everyday life we have no 
script according which to act; each choice is irrevoca-
ble; each action sets our course for the future without 
any fixed or fated plan, without any guarantee as to 
the outcome. We are subject to the laws of irreversible 
time, contingency, uncertainty. There can be no science

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
of a particular, individual life. It is precisely because 
there can be no science of particulars, no science of 
contingent facts, no science of HISTORY, that Aristotle 
held dramatic poetry tobe higher than, ofmuch graver 
import than, and much closer to philosophy than his-
tory. Dramatic poetry gives us the typical, not the story 
of what actually happened but of what could happen, 
what ought ta happen, of what is instructive, of what 
repeats through time; even ifwe were to put Herodotus 
into verse, he says, we would not get poetry. 
Here we enter the literary text as opposed to history 
or biography: unlike history, a text can be repeated; it 
is not for one time only; it is allographic. While the 
text of a play depends for its existence on the imagi-
nation and on the work of a really existing, historical 
playwright, it is itself an ideal entity capable of be-
ing repeated in its ideal meaning again and again. The 
"idea" of a play, its philosophical and "typical" im-
port, is an eidetic and nota real object; it always eludes 
our present grasp; it is a Polidee, Husserl would say, 
a limit-concept that teleologically transcends and rules 
ali its possible versions and interpretations. True, it can 
only be enacted by these actors, under this director, in 
this theater, for this audience, here and now, but a given 
performance never exhausts the meaning of the play. 
As HERMENEUTICS and STRUCTURALISM have taught US, 
the meaning of the text of a play always exceeds the 
real psychological intentions ofthe author, and authors 
are in no privileged position to interpret the meaning of 
their own work. Writers as diverse as Dostoyevsky and 
Pirandello ha ve testified that an author leams the story 
from the characters in the novel or play, who emerge 
with their own independent lives and motivations in 
the author's own imaginary and literary creation as he 
or she writes. They, as much as anyone, teach the au-
thor what to write. Once one has conceived them in 
imagination, one no longer writes as one wills but as 
one can; there is an inner logic to each literary text that 
requires that the characters, once given life in imag-
ination, teach the author and the audience their own 
story. 
Sartre first focused on the phenomenological impor-
tance of role-playing, or "acting," in his "phenomen-
ological ontology," L 'etre et le neant ( 1943 ). There, in 
isolating the "existential-ontologica!" structure of"bad 
faith" he uncovered a necessary, eidetic structure ofhu-
man existence. On the behaviorallevel, "bad faith" is 
not opposed to "good faith." One can never escape bad 
faith; everyone is always in bad faith; the opposite of 
bad faith is not "good faith" but authenticity, namely, 
the recognition that everyone is always in "bad faith," 
that every consciousness is forever "not what it is but 
is what it is not." 
At first sight, the distinction between acting in ev-
eryday life and play-acting seems unbreachable. No 
matter who plays the role of Hamlet, the character in 
its ideal independence is not affected. The character of 
Hamlet is as fixed as a Platonic idea; his acts, thoughts, 
destiny are fixed by the idea ofthe play. But the actor, 
as actor, has other purposes and more knowledge than 
the character in the play (because he has already read 
the script and is living in the real, nonimaginary world 
of human freedom and responsibility). No one- not 
even the actor- can enter the time and place of the 
play from the outside without disrupting it as play. 
But what about role-playing from a moral point of 
view in everyday life? What Sartre calls "bad faith" 
holds an essential place both in his metaphysics and in 
his theory ofhuman reaJity, his PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHRO-
POLOGY. In L 'etre et le neant he gives usa plethora of 
examples: the grocer, the student, the soldier, the gam-
bler, the flirt, the waiter, and others who show that no 
performance of any ro le in everyday life is ever wholly 
what it seems, that in numerous instances we have to 
pretend to "be ourselves," that there is only a difference 
of degree between the real, "sincere," unselfconscious 
performances in which we act ourselves, and the "dis-
honest," calculating, fully conscious staging of a scene 
for a given public, in short, that it is impossible ever 
fully tobe oneself. And this playing of ro les is essential 
to society: "A grocer who dreams is offensive to the 
buyer, because such a grocer is not wholly a grocer. 
There are indeed many precautions to imprison a man 
in what he is, as if we lived in perpetua! fear that he 
might escape from it, that he might break away and 
suddenly elude his condition." In his radical theory of 
a transcendental, non-ego logica!, operating conscious-
ness that experiences both the world and itselfprior to 
reftection, Sartre ejects ali "objects" from conscious-
ness. Not only does consciousness objectify and give 
MEANING and VALUE to things, but it is also capable of 
objectifying itself, its own acts, states, emotions, and 
dispositions. Even these are "essences" or "objects" of 
consciousness and I am myself cut off from my own 

THEATER 
essence "by the nothingness that I am." 
The noetic attitudes of interrogation such as ab-
stracting, isolating, imagining, doubting, and denying 
ground the possibility of experiencing the WORLD oth-
erwise than as it is, as composed not only of positive 
bits of being but also of absences and otherness, of 
possibilities and potentialities, of the unreal and the 
imaginary, of the "ideal" reality of the objects of in-
ference and demonstration, even of moral and physical 
evi!, of psychophysical limitations and contingency. 
The experience of an absence is not the absence of an 
experience; on the contrary, it is a very intense experi-
ence. When Pierre does not arrive for a rendezvous at 
the Cafe Bonaparte as he promised, I experience his ab-
sence, not from some particular spot but from the whole 
cafe. I do not conjure up some image or "species" of 
Pierre distinct from Pierre himself; rather, I "perceive" 
his absence as a possible presence by "nihilating" the 
actual cafe as the ground upon which he appears as 
not-being-there. Consciousness adds nothing to being 
except the "unreal." 
It is of the essence of consciousness to be able to 
reftect on its own acts, to objectify itself, to be able 
to take itself as an object. "Phenomenology," writes 
Sartre, "has taught us that states are objects, that an 
emotion as such (a love ora hatred) is a transcendent 
object and cannot shrink into the interior unity of a 
'consciousness.' Consequently if Paul and Peter both 
speak of Peter 's !o ve, for example, it is no longer true 
that the one speaks blindly and by analogy ofwhat the 
other apprehends in fui!. They speak ofthe same thing. 
Doubtless they apprehend it by different procedures, 
but these procedures are equally intuitional. And Pe-
ter's emotion is no more certain for Peter than for Paul 
... Doubt, remorse, the so-called 'mental crises of con-
sciousness,' etc.- in short ali the content of intimate 
diaries- becomes sheer performance." 
It is impossible to discuss Sartre 's theory of acting, 
and therefore his theory of the theater, except on the 
basis ofhis ethical philosophy ofthe "free act." There 
are two existential facts about human reality-namely, 
( 1) that it is situated, determined, in a place, contingent, 
not necessary, factical, limited, and particular, and (2) 
that it is, in this situation, absolutely free, its own basis, 
its own source. 
Since it is always easier to discuss Sartre's theories 
on the basis of his examples, let us take the exam-
695 
ple of the story of Abraham, on the basis of which 
Kierkegaard established his notion of religious faith 
as "the teleological suspension of the ethical." We ali 
know the story: God appears to Abraham in his sleep 
and orders him to take his only son up Mount Moriah 
and offer him up as a human holocaust to the divinity. 
Abraham, being a "man of faith," does not hesitate to 
obey this command. This can be called the "Abraham 
complex." But Sartre asks: how did Abraham know 
the vision he had was from God and not that of a ly-
ing demon from Egypt? Only Abraham, alone, could 
decide this for himself. Even if there are signs, di-
vine commands, even if there are moral laws written 
on tablets of stone, only humans can interpret them. 
Sartre is Kantian without being Lutheran. Like KANT, 
he holds that even in accepting the divinely sanctioned 
morallaw, it is the individual human being who must 
recognize it as the voice of God, alone, and on their 
own authority. That is not an act that God can do for 
them. Humankind is isolated in its own subjectivity 
and must choose and invent, find a path for itself. 
A given person's subjective aloneness in recogniz-
ing the voi ce of God is even more accentuated by an-
other Kantian moral principle: each moral choice has 
a legislative dimension. By performing a moral act we 
are, in effect, saying "go thou and do likewise." This 
legislative burden is the source of our "ethical anx-
iety." We cannot not choose; we are condemned to 
be free. Not to choose is itself a choice. At each in-
stance we are capable of being forced to make moral 
decisions, choices, and we always have to make these 
choices without full knowledge ofthe consequences of 
our actions, assuming a responsibility for choices that 
may turn out to have been wrong. There is an even 
more fundamental sense of freedom in Sartre than the 
freedom and the necessity to choose: it is the "noetic 
freedom" to become "unstuck" from the things that 
make up our world and to which consciousness alone 
gives structure, meaning, and value; it is our permanent 
possibility "of dissociating ourselves from the causal 
series which constitutes being and which can produce 
only being." 
Thus there can be no ETHICS built up of self-evident 
or universal laws. There can be no generalized exis-
tential ethics at ali; there are only right choices. The 
Biblica! injunction to "do unto others as thou wouldst 
be done by," or the Kantian moral imperative never to 

696 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
treat another human freedom as a means to an end but 
only as an end in itself, are true but empty. Whenever 
we are faced with applying these laws in any concrete, 
actual case of moral choice they are of no help at ali. 
Every ethical choice is situational, always a "particular 
nihilation." 
In order to develop his ethics Sartre wrote both his 
existential PSYCHOANALYSIS and his philosophy of the 
theater. It is precisely because of the imperatives of 
individual freedom and the impossibility of an ethics 
based on universal principles that Sartre gives us his 
most important ethical insights in his existential psy-
choanalyses of individual cases and in the "myths" he 
forged in his plays, elevating examples of individual 
choices to the level of "the typical," "the mythical," 
just as the ancient tragedians did. 
Sartre's existential psychoanalysis was not meant 
to be a therapeutic method, but rather an exercise in 
philosophical anthropology, a series of studies that ap-
proaches a theory of humankind through the investi-
galion ofinstructive individual cases: Baudelaire, Tin-
toretto, Flaubert, Jean Genet. Most of his case studies 
deal with historical personages; only Genet was a "li ve 
subject," and even there, much ofthe evidence exam-
ined was taken from Genet's published short stories 
and plays. 
His theory begins with a negative criticism ofFreud. 
He rejects the "materialistic mythology" of Freud both 
because of its mechanistic conception of human be-
ings and because it makes the ego into a weak play-
thing of subliminal "causal" forces, ali the while sur-
reptitiously reintroducing into the "unconscious" the 
structures of consciousness as such. The "censor" or 
"superego" knows, for instance, which libidinal desires 
to suppress. Stated positively, his method replaces the 
search into the causal origins of present behavior with 
an examination of the meaning of present behavior 
in terms of its future-oriented intent and implications. 
Sartre approaches the life of a given, mature adult-
who lives this life (sometimes barely) within the limits 
of normality- as a unified whole, not as a "bundle 
of drives" haphazardly juxtaposed. Person and world 
comprise a unified, structured whole. He writes: "The 
principle ofthis psychoanalysis is that man is a totality 
and not a collection. Consequently he expresses him-
self as a whole in even his most insignificant and his 
most superficial behavior." 
But Sartre's rejection of Freud's conception of the 
unconscious does not rule out unconscious or precon-
scious intentionalities, because the meaning of surface 
behavior is not immediately intelligible; it must be 
interpreted. There is a large realm of pre-reflcctive. 
pre-logical, pre-predicative behavior that primarily de-
fines our individual choices of lifestyles, our ways of 
being-in-the-world. One ofthe reasons Genet (the sub-
ject of Sartre's most successful "existential psycho-
analysis") is so interesting is that he does not write 
"about" thieves, homosexuals, and deserters, but as a 
thief, as a homosexual, as a traitor who deserts in the 
face of the enemy. The behaviors examined arc just 
those that would be examined in any theory of indi-
vidual psychotherapy: sexuality, eating, interpersonal 
relationships, ways ofpossessing and using things and 
persons. Sartre's aim is to discover those free (but fre-
quently pre-reflective) individual choices ofbeing that 
are unique in each life, that pattern of action that will 
reveal the meaning of an individual life in its total, 
complex, existential density. This is the "fundamental 
project" or primary choice of a way of being-in-the-
world. And ali a person 's individual choices reveal his 
or her "fundamental choice," if only we know how to 
"decipher" them. 
Sartre believes in going down to the most minute 
details, usque ad minima. If a given man "is what he 
prefers," ifhis way ofbeing-in-the-world is revealed in 
the way he possesses "the world through any particular 
object," ali his behaviors of "having" or of possession 
reveal the particular concretization of his "fundamen-
tal choice." "To eat," he writes, "is to appropriate by 
destruction: it is at the same time to be filled up with 
a certain being ... It is not a matter of indifference 
whether we like oysters or clams, snails or shrimp, 
if only we know how to unravel the existential sig-
nificance of these foods." Moreover, to appropriate, 
in whatever fashion, is never "innocent." If I climb a 
mountain, I affix my flag to it; if I seduce this woman 
she becomes mine. In appropriating 1 necessarily al-
ter and transform ("digest") what I possess, and at the 
same time there is always the "surreptitious appropri-
ation ofthe possessor by the possessed." Knowledge, 
like exploration, is a "rape ofthe world." 
To summarize, the "three big categories of con-
crete human existence," writes Sartre, are ta be, to 
have, ta do. And since we "are what we do," since we 

THEATER

secrete our essence by our actions while our actions 
are revealed in our ways of "having" (i.e., possessing, 
appropriating, absorbing, digesting, assimilating, de-
stroying) the objects that make up our world, we will 
find that each person 's fundamental choice of a way of 
being-in-the-world is revealed by the categories of pos-
session and these are, in turn, revealed by the categories 
of acting. And action brings us to moral categories: to 
freedom and responsibility. 
The importance of an existential analysis is to hold 
up to us, on the basis of an individuallife, a mirror in 
which we can see ourselves more clearly. As there is the 
"reversibility ofmerits" in which we ali take the credit 
for the work of the great heroes, inventors, prophets 
among us, so there is a "reversibility of crime" accord-
ing to which even the analysis of Genet's misdeeds 
reveals not just another case history, but the descrip-
tion of our own "human possibility." The story of the 
martyrdom of "Saint Genet" is as edifying as that of 
Saint Sebastian. 
Sartre's essays in existential psychoanalysis lead 
necessarily to his theory ofthe theater as the final cul-
mination of an ethics ofthe free act. Sartre calls himself 
a "forger of myths." His theater is a theater of situa-
tions opposed to the psychological theater that has held 
sway in Europe sin ce the great tragedians of the 16th 
and 17th centuries and is typical of Anglo-American 
theater at the present time. 
Sartre does not believe in a ready-made "human na-
ture." Existence precedes essence: as individuals, we 
create our own essence as we go along, by our acts. 
A theater of situations will present a free human being 
in a particular social environment in which he or she 
makes an irrevocable choice. Sartre's theater presents 
us with " ... a free being, entirely indeterminate, who 
must choose his own being when confronted with cer-
tain necessities, such as being already committed in 
a world fu li of both threatening and favorable factors 
among other men who have made their choices be-
fore him, who ha ve decided in advance the meaning of 
those factors. He is faced with the necessity ofhaving 
to work and die, of being hurled into a life already 
complete which is sti li his own enterprise and in which 
he can never ha ve a second chance; where he must play 
his cards and take risks no matter what the cost. ... We 
put on stage certain situations which throw light on 
the main aspects ofthe condition ofman ... and have 
the spectator participate in the free choice which man 
makes in these situations." 
We are living in the second half ofthe 20th century; 
God is dead, or absent; the human race is certainly not 
at the center ofthe uni verse; human nature is no longer 
fixed and stable, and the situation of the individual is 
uncertain and difficult to think through. In this con-
dition people need "myths" of freedom in their effort 
to understand the nature of the human situation in the 
present. Each of Sartre's plays, including his rewriting 
ofthe Greek myths, presents an individual in a partic-
ular situation in which one must make an ethical com-
mitment without full knowledge of the consequences 
of one's actions, but which is nevertheless an authentic 
free choice, o ne way of understanding, and "dominat-
ing," making sense of, giving a specific meaning and 
value to that situation by this decision to act. 
His plays are often written for the sake of a single 
scene. As in classic tragedy, we enter upon the ACTION, 
the agon, at the very moment it is headed for catas-
trophe. "Our plays are violent and brief," he writes, 
"centered around one single event; there are few play-
ers and the story is compressed within a short space 
of time, sometimes only a few hours. As a result they 
obey a kind of'rule ofthe three unities,' which has been 
only a little bit rejuvenated and modified. A single set, 
a few entrances, a few exits, intense arguments among 
the characters who defend their individual rights with 
passion ... " 
There is, therefore, passion; however, it is not 
merely or even primarily induced by psychological 
conflicts and opposition, but by moral dilemmas, con-
flicts ofrights. The three unities oftime, place, and plot 
are observed; Huis el os and Les sequestres d 'A/tona, 
plays of final judgment, human not divine, take place in 
very confined spaces. Le diable et le bon dieu, Sartre's 
only "epic," while stretched out in time and location, 
still takes place within the Faustian time of "one year 
and a day" and is actually focused on just two juxta-
posed scenes, the wager and the final accounting. 
Sartre's theater is "austere, moral, mythic, and cere-
monia! in aspect," focused on great social and religious 
questions. It deals with the great themes of death, exile, 
and !o ve. It is nota theater of symbols or ofthe natural-
istic presentation of psychological rivalries and exag-
gerated emotions. It is rather a matter of "the rights of 
citizenship, the rights of the family, individual ethics, 

698 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
collective ethics, the right to kill, the right to reveal 
to human beings their pitiable condition .... We do 
not reject psychology," he says, "but integrate it into 
a struggle over opposing moral claims." In Les mains 
sales the drama is not exhausted by the question of 
whether or not Hoerderer has seduced Jessica, though 
the psychological duel between Hugo and Hoerderer 
over Jessica and Hoerderer's love is central to the play; 
the chief source of drama !ies in answering the question 
of who, Hugo or Hoerderer, is ultimately in the right, 
the Stalinist or the Trotskyite. 
The theater must will tobe moral (which does not 
at ali mean "didactic" in the Brechtian sense). "It was 
not," he wrote, "a question of the opposition of char-
acter between a Stalinist and a Trotskyite; it was not in 
their characters that an anti-Nazi of 1933 clashed with 
an S.S. guard; the difficulties in international politics 
do not derive from the characters of the men leading 
us; the strikes in the United States do not reveal con-
flicts of character between industrialists and workers. 
In each case it is, in the final analysis and in spite of 
divergent interests, the system ofvalues, of ethics and 
of concepts of man which are lined up against each 
other." 
What is essentiaJ in Sartre's EXISTENTIAL PHENOMEN-
OLOGY ofthe theater is the meaning of a free, individual 
human act in a situation that gives it a dramatic, instruc-
tive, "mythical" import. He distinguishes the three lev-
els ofpsychological, social, and philosophical meaning 
in each individual choice not to write a general ethics 
of principles, but to give insight into the true human 
situation in the 20th century in ali its precarious ethical 
contingency.

TIME 
Time and the consciousness of time 
are central themes in Husserlian phenomenology. They 
also figure prominently in the thought of MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, and MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY, who were familiar with Husserl's writings on 
time and whose own reflections often show Husserl 's 
influence, even when they take a different course. 
Husserl understands the consciousness of time to 
be a uniquely important form of INTENTIONALITY, that 
defining feature of conscious life according to which it 
is always the consciousness of something. Time enters 
into everything ofwhich we are aware, and every inten-
tiona! experience presupposes time-consciousness as a 
necessary condition of its constitution. Husserl reflects 
on temporality within the boundaries ofthe phenomen-
ological EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION, which means that he 
is interested in time and temporal objects just as they

TIME 
appear in the experiences that intend them, and in the 
essential structures of those experiences precisely in-
sofar as they are instances of time-consciousness. He 
does not investigate time as a matter of psychologi-
cal or empirica! fact subject to scientific calculation 
and measurement, but rather directs a refiective EIDETIC 
METHOD toward it. Because he does not view temporal-
ity as a simple phenomenon, Husserl offers no single 
definition of time. In their complexity, his refiections 
mirror the mosaic of problems, issues, and levels that 
make up temporality as we experience it. 
Temporal objects form the most obvious of these 
levels. What concerns Husserl is not the specific con-
tent of the object- the fact that it is a train rushing 
into a station, for example -
but what characterizes 
it as a temporal object. Temporal objects endure, and 
some of them, such as melodies, display an interna! 
succession of phases. They are concrete, individual, 
unitary, changing or unchanging, and appear as simul-
taneous or in succession. They may be transcendent to 
consciousness, as the train is, or immanent to it, as is 
the act ofperceiving the train. Although not all objects 
are temporal objects, even those that are not, such as 
theorems in mathematics, presume time as the back-
ground against which their timeless character stands 
out. 
Temporal objects are experienced with these fea-
tures because o ne is aware of them as now, past, and 
future. Now, past, and future are the specifically tem-
poral modes of appearance. They are not things, con-
tainers for things, or parts of the objects presented in 
them. Nor are they points making up objective time. 
They are rather the ways in which temporal objects 
appear, analogous to the spatial perspectives in which 
objects appear in SPACE. The past, for example, is no 
more part of the temporal object than an aerial view 
of a town is part of the town; both are simply ways in 
which something appears. 
Among the temporal modes, the now enjoys a priv-
ileged sta tus. It is the absolute point of orientation for 
the life of consciousness: past and future are always 
oriented toward it and constantly change in relation to 
it. It is also the living source-point of new temporal 
objects and new temporal positions. As the source of 
temporal positions, it is a continuous moment of in-
dividuation. Something can become individuated only 
by appearing ata particular point oftime, which it first 
699 
does in the mode of the now. Of course, what appears 
as now will immediately sink into the past, but it will 
remain identified with the temporal location at which 
it first appeared. The now is also characterized by its 
hospitality. Because it is not itself a thing or part of a 
thing, it can play host to many temporal objects at once. 
Indeed, simultaneity, understood as many objects ex-
isting at the same time, is originally "same nowness." 
Despite its privileged status, the now does not exist 
independently ofthe other temporal modes. It is never 
without its horizon of past and fu ture, the larger whole 
of temporal appearance formed by the modes in their 
continuous mediation with one another. Now, past, and 
future maintain their identities within this whole, how-
ever, neither dissolving into one another nor appearing 
apart from one another. Husserl therefore avoids the 
prejudice ofthe now, according to which one is imme-
diately aware only ofwhat is now. He also rejects the 
opposing view that what is now escapes before one can 
experience it as now. He insists that the now is indeed 
experienced, but always with its horizon of past and 
future, and always as fieeting. 
That the temporal object is the object-in-its-
temporal-position appearing in ever-changing tempo-
ral modes explains Husserl 's observati an that time is 
both fixed and fiowing. Time is fixed in the sense that 
the object's temporal position remains the same as it 
recedes into the past; the object, glued to its place, pre-
serves a rigid relationship to what carne before it and 
what followed after it. Objective time is precisely this 
sequence of temporal positions in which experienced 
temporal objects find their fixed locations. Time fiows 
in the sense that the object-in-position, as it runs offfor 
consciousness, appears in continually different tempo-
ral modes in relation to the living now. Time as fixed is 
measured by the objective relationships of before and 
after; time as fiowing appears in the always shifting 
modes ofnow, past, future. The fixed relationships are 
experienced only in the changing modes. 
Experienced time and temporal objects form one 
of the dimensions of temporality that Husserl in-
vestigates. He also asks what the structure of time-
consciousness must be if it is to intend time. Husserl 
first addressed this question primarily through the ex-
ample of perception. An act of PERCEPT!ON has phases, 
only one of which will be actual at a given moment. 
Ifthe perception is tobe aware of an object as tempo-

700 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
rai, the actual phase of the perception must intend the 
object as now. But since the object is extended intime 
and not simply now, the actual phase ofthe perception 
must also "reach out beyond" the now, that is, intend 
elapsed phases of the object and phases yet to come. 
Each actual phase of a perception, therefore, refers in-
tentionally to an extended section of a temporal object 
and not merely to its now-point. 
But reaching out beyond the now, while necessary, is 
not sufficient to account for time consciousness. If, for 
example, one remained conscious of the just elapsed 
notes of a melody in precisely the way in which one 
is conscious of the present note -
as now -
one 
would hear a crash of simultaneous sounds, not the 
melody. The actual phase of consciousness must there-
fore intend elapsed phases ofthe object and phases yet 
to come in a modified way, specifically, in appropri-
ate modes of past and future. Only then can one be 
aware of the phases as elapsed or yet to come, and of 
the object as extended in time. Ali of this is possible, 
Husserl claims, because each phase of consciousness 
possesses a triple intentionality: "prima! impression" 
intends what is actually present as now; "retention" 
or "primary memory" intends what has just elapsed as 
past in varying degrees; and "protention" intends what 
is yet to come as future. Prima! impression, retention, 
and protention, although distinguishable, are not self-
sufficient acts. They are dependent moments of a phase 
oftime-constituting consciousness, no more capable of 
independent existence than now, past, and future, the 
temporal modes of appearance correlated with them. 
Husserl characterizes prima! impression as the ab-
solutely original consciousness, the prima! source for 
ali consciousness and being. It is the wellspring ofthe 
new on the side of intending consciousness, just as 
its correlate, the now, is the mode of appearance of 
the new on the si de of intended objects. Retention and 
protention are also forms of original consciousness, for 
it is in them that the senses ofpast and future first be-
come constituted. Retention is the original conscious-
ness of the past in severa! senses. It is the moment 
of consciousness in which we initially become aware 
of something as past. It is also original in the way in 
which it gives the past. Retention or primary memory 
"sees" the past, "presents" it, as opposed to ordinary 
recollection or secondary memory, which gives the past 
again, "re-presenting" rather than presenting it. More 
precisely, retention is the direct and immediate con-
sciousness of what is just past as it slips away from 
the now. It occurs "automatically" in the sense that it 
is neither freely undertaken nor free to change what it 
is aware of. Ordinary MEMORY, on the other hand, is a 
self-sufficient act of consciousness that one can begin 
or end at will. Rather than simply presenting the con-
tinuai flowing away of what is past, it re-presents the 
whole experience again, as if it were running off for 
consciousness anew. Furthermore, as RE-PRESENTATION 
rather than original presentation, ordinary memory is 
free to speed up the remembered event, lea ve out parts, 
perhaps even tinkerwith their order-possibilities not 
open to retention as the original consciousness of the 
past. 
Protention, the original consciousness ofwhat is to 
come, presents its correlate in the mode of the fu ture, 
but without the fulfillment that characterizes prima! 
impression and retention. What is future is precisely 
what has not yet made its appearance "in person" by 
presenting itself in the mode of the now. Protention 
is therefore the perpetua! and immediate openness to 
more experience that marks conscious life. Whatever 
content it has will conform to what one is presently 
experiencing. If one is in the midst of listening to a 
symphony by Mozart, the content of one's protentions 
will be the continued hearing of just this symphony. 
Thanks to protention, one would be surprised if the 
music suddenly died or were interrupted by a scream. 
Protention 's possession of some content or other does 
not mean that it is equivalent to expectation. EXPECTA-
TION, in which one anticipates the fu ture as if one were 
perceiving it, is a full and independent act, just like 
secondary memory. 
Around 191 O, Husserl carried his investigation to a 
deeper level by introducing a final dimension of tempo-
ral awareness, "the absolute time-constituting flow of 
consciousness." Husserl's earlier analyses had focused 
on the way in which temporal objects, particularly per-
ceived objects, appear, and on the structure ofthe acts 
that intend them. The latter are themselves temporal 
objects- immanent rather than transcendent- and 
one is aware of them as temporal. The absolute flow 
accounts for the consciousness of such immanent uni-
ties as they run off in interna! time. This awareness, in 
contrast to the thematizing consciousness one has of 
a perceived or remembered object, is implicit or non-

TIME 
thetic. In Husserl 's technical language, o ne perceives 
an event unfolding in the world, while one experiences 
( erlebt) the temporally extended act that intends it. The 
absolute flow is precisely the experiencing or consti-
tuting of such immanent temporal unities. 
The metaphor of "flow" conveys the dynamic and 
continuous character of this ultimate level of con-
sciousness. Phases ofthe flow ceaselessly well up and 
pass away, dovetailing with one another without gaps 
or breaks. One phase of this flux will be actual at any 
moment, while others will ha ve elapsed or not yet oc-
curred. According to Husserl, the flow possesses a dou-
ble intentionality: it is conscious of itself in its flow-
ing and, through its self-awareness, also conscious of 
immanent temporal objects. One may plausibly inter-
pret this dual intentionality as follows. The three inten-
tiona! moments of impression, retention, and proten-
tion, which Husserl originally introduced in connection 
with perception, he now takes tobe the essential struc-
ture of each phase of the absolute flow. The moment 
of prima! impression belonging to the actual phase of 
the flow is the consciousness of the now-phase of the 
immanent object. The retentional moment ofthe actual 
phase directly intends, not the just elapsed phase ofthe 
object, but the just elapsed phase of the jlow. Since 
the latter originally intended a phase of the immanent 
object as now through its prima! impression, by re-
taining the elapsed phase of the flow o ne also retains 
the just elapsed phase of the object correlated with it. 
This pattern of retention retaining elapsed phases of 
the flow and thereby elapsed phases of the immanent 
object repeats itself as far as retention extends. 
In the other direction, protention is open to phases 
of the flow yet to come and to immanent objects cor-
related with them. If the immanent object constituted 
by the flow is an act directed toward a transcendent 
temporal abject, then the awareness of the transcen-
dent abject becomes constituted as well. The flow's 
two intentionalities are therefore inseparable aspects 
of a single consciousness. They require one another 
like two si des of one and the same thing, for the flow 
intends immanent objects only by bringing itself to 
appearance. 
Husserl says that we lack appropriate names for the 
absolute flow. Ordinary temporal predicates -
now, 
past, future- ha ve already been bestowed on the tem-
poral objects that the flow intends. To apply them to the 
701 
flow itself would risk con fus ing the flow with what it 
constitutes. Husserl does say that the flow possesses a 
"quasi-temporal" character insofar as it flows and has 
an actual phase and post-actual and pre-actual phases. 
As the universal and necessary condition of our tempo-
ral awareness, however, its temporality remains unique 
and irreducible to that of its objects. It is important to 
note that Husserl ca lis the flow "absolute" because it is 
the founding level oftime-consciousness, not because 
it is any kind of mystical or metaphysical absolute. 
Furthermore, while it may be distinct from the imma-
nent objects it founds or constitutes, the flow is neither 
separate nor separable from them in its existence and 
self-appearance. It simply is the experiencing of tem-
poral unities in immanent time. 
The conception of the absolute flow opens up in-
teresting possibilities for phenomenological reflection. 
The flow's double intentionality, for example, enables 
Husserl to account for the sense in which the succession 
of consciousness is the consciousness of succession. It 
is precisely because the succeeding phases of the ab-
solute flow are intentionally related to one another that 
the flow itself can be experienced in its succession 
of phases and temporal objects can be experienced in 
their successive moments. The flow of consciousness, 
far from rendering problematic the awareness oftem-
porally extended objects, makes it possible. 
The absolute flow illuminates the hospitality of con-
sciousness as well. As sheer experiential conscious-
ness, the flow is not any particular act or content and 
is therefore open to the myriad conscious experiences 
that one lives through in the course of one's life. The 
flow makes possible, for example, one's experiencing 
of memory and perception and joy simultaneously as 
well as in succession. But if the flow opens one up 
to the multiplicity of experience, it also provides the 
ground for the abiding unity and identity of one's con-
scious life in the face of that multiplicity. Particular 
experiences come and go; the flow abides, supporting 
the interplay of unity and multiplicity, of identity and 
difference that marks the life of consciousness intime. 
Finally, if the absolute flow is seen as the first stage 
in the constitution of the transcendental EGO, then the 
ego, at least in Husserl's conception of it, can hardly 
be seen as a nontemporal monad sealed up in eterna! 
self-presence: it is openness and transcendence at the 
very point of its genesis, and its being is inseparable

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
from temporality. This is a theme Husserl develops in 
his !ater reflections, in the unpublished C manuscripts, 
on what he calls the "living present." 
Later figures in the phenomenological movement, 
such as Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty, share 
certain fundamental positions with Husserl, even if 
they are sometimes blind to the fact. They agree, for 
example, that temporal awareness depends on the ca-
pacity to reach out beyond the now, that consciousness 
or the human being gathers itself together into a total-
ity out of its temporal diaspora, and that the time one 
experiences is not a sequence of isolated now-points, 
but an ever-changing synthetic structure of now, past, 
and future. These shared positions are developed in 
different settings. 
Husserl investigates temporality as a complex in-
stance of intentiona! consciousness. MARTIN HEIDEGGER 
approaches it from the radically different perspective 
of the meaning of Being. Specifically, he addresses 
the question ofbeing by interpreting DASEIN, the being 
whose Being is an issue for it, in terms of its tempo-
rality. Since Dasein is practica! human being-in-the-
world rather than the Husserlian transcendental con-
sciousness, Heidegger analyzes, not the consciousness 
of temporal objectivity, but the everyday temporality 
ofDasein as it pursues its projects in the world. 
Heidegger distinguishes authentic or primordial 
temporality from inauthentic temporality. Inauthentic 
temporality -
time as it is ordinarily understood -
-is conceived as an infinite sequence ofnow-points ar-
ranged in relations of before and after. "Past" refers 
to points that are no longer actual, "future" to points 
that are not yet actual. Inauthentic time presents it-
self as an autonomous system involving human reality 
only as occurring in it factually or as something that 
occasionally takes its measure through acts of mem-
ory, expectation, and perception. Authentic temporal-
ity, on the other hand, is identica! with the structure 
of Dasein itself. Heidegger describes this temporality 
as "ee-static," in the original etymological sense of 
the term -
that is, Dasein, in the process of "tem-
poralization," always "stands outside" or transcends 
itself. Dasein is outside itself in its past as what it 
has been; it is outside itself in the present by making-
present entities in the world; and it is outside itself 
in the future that "comes toward" it. Past, present, and 
fu ture, as "ec-stases" oftemporality, are neither succes-
si ve time-points nor temporal modes of appearance nor 
the intentiona! correlates of memory, perception, and 
expectation. They are Dasein's ways of being-in-the-
world. Among the ecstasies, the future enjoys priority. 
The activities in which Dasein engages are not oriented 
around the now, but around the ends toward which they 
project. Dasein is always ahead ofitself; it is "futural." 
Dasein's projecting into the future grounds authentic 
past and present by making them the past and present 
of the project in which Dasein is engaged. The tem-
poral ecstases therefore form a unity in Dasein, which 
exists as futural being that makes things present in the 
very process ofhaving been. 
JEAN-PAUL SARTRE's investigation of temporality 
owes much to Heidegger, from whom he borrows the 
notions of ee-static temporality and authentic and in-
authentic time, and to Husserl. He commends Husserl 
for not resorting, in his published writings on time 
consciousness, to the transcendental ego in order to ac-
count for the unity of consciousness. Husserl 's absolute 
flow, by intending itself in its flowing, hand les the task. 
Sartre nonetheless thinks that Husserl 's mature position 
is thoroughly ego logica! and that consciousness-as-ego 
precludes the reaching out beyond the now that is es-
sential to the awareness of time. Imprisoned by the 
ego in the now, retention and protention- in Sartre 's 
vi vid image- batter in vain against the windowpanes 
ofthe present. That the absolute flow may be the orig-
inal moment of the Husserlian ego 's self-constitution 
and that its windows are wide open to past and future 
does not seem to have occurred to Sartre. His under-
standing of the temporal ec-stases is determined by 
the division in his ontology between being-for-itself 
and being-in-itself. The for-itself or consciousness is 
defined as not being what it is conscious of, that is, 
being-in-itself. Past, present, and future, as modes of 
being ofthe for-itself, are therefore ways in which the 
for-itself surpasses itself toward what it is not. The 
past is the for-itselfbehind itself as what it was but no 
Ion ger is; the future is the for-itselfbefore itself as what 
it will be but is not; the present is the presence of the 
for-itselfto what it is not. Sartre describes the for-itself 
in its temporal structure as a flight- specifically, "a 
flight outside of co-present being and from the being 
that it was towards the being that it will be."

time-consciousness. He focuses on the conscious sub-
ject rather than Dasein, but this is an embodied sub-
ject engaged in the world. Time is a dimension of the 
subject's being and not an object ofknowledge consti-
tuted by an ego standing outside time. The subject is 
time. To elucidate this claim, Merleau-Ponty draws on 
Husserl's conception ofthe absolute fiow. The subject 
is a network of intentionalities, at once manifesting 
itself and the world in its temporality. Presence en-
joys a privilege in this process because it is there that 
our ee-static temporalization is centered. In !ater texts 
Merleau-Ponty expresses reservations about whether 
Husserl adequately recognized the transcendence that 
exists at the heart of presence. JACQUES DERRIDA, more 
recently, would agree with these reservations, seeing 
in Husserl a late representative of the "metaphysics of 
presence." One might argue, however, that Husserl 's 
phenomenology oftemporality is, in fact, a careful ex-
amination of absence, offering grounds for a defense 
ofthe view that absence can finally be understood only 
in terms of its intimate intentiona! relationship with 
presence.

TRAN DUC THAO 
Thao was bom September 
16, 1917, in Thai Binh, in what would !ater become 
North Vietnam. He left for FRANCE in 1936 where he 
pursued his philosophical studies. It was then and there 
that he met JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, MAUR! CE MERLEAU-PONTY, 
and JEAN CAVAILLES, who introduced him to the phi-
losophy of EDMUND HUSSERL. In 1941-42, under the 
direction of Cavailles, Thao wrote his doctoral disser-
tation on the Husserlian method, and under the strong 
infiuence of Merleau-Ponty, tumed from common in-
terpretations that made of Husserlian phenomenology 
a doctrine of eterna! essences to a philosophy ofTIME, 
ofhistorical subjectivity, and of universal HISTORY. For 
as Husserl used to say, "atemporality is an omnitem-
porality, which is itselfbut a mode oftemporality." 
It was then that lengthy dialogues took place be-
tween Sartre and Thao. These conversations were taken 
down in shorthand with the aim of publishing them. 
Thao gave his own version ofthem when he stated that 
Sartre's invitation was for the purpose of proving that 
EXISTENTIALISM couJd peacefully coexist with MARXISM 
on the doctrina! plane. Sartre minimized the role of 
Marxism insofar as he recognized its value solely in

terms ofpolitics and social history. The sphereofinfiu-
ence would be shared by both Marxism and existential-
ism, the former being competent with respect to social 
problems. Thao tried to point out to Sartre that quite to 
the contrary, Marxist philosophy was tobe taken seri-
ously since it grappled with the fundamental problem 
of the relation of consciousness to matter. These dia-
logues with Sartre, along with the destruction of Ger-
man Fascism, necessitated a radical choice between 
either existentialism or Marxism, Sartre and Merleau-
Ponty having already opted for the former. Owing to 
his phenomenological orientation, Thao broke with ex-
istentialism, first with the publication ofhis article "La 
phenomenologie de 1 'esprit et son contenu reel" ( 1948) 
and !ater with Phenomenologie et materialisme dialec-
tique ( 1951 ). Owing to this same orientation, the choice 
of Marxism created for Tran Duc Thao a need to rid 
the dual Hegelian and Husserlian phenomenologies of 
their idealistic form and metaphysical elements in or-
der to salvage whatever else was left valid and place it 
at the service of dialectica! materialism for a scientific 
solution of the problem of subjectivity. 
Tran Duc Thao's analysis of Husserlian phenomen-
ology -
especially the !ater writings, Die Krisis der 
europăischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale 
Phănomenologie (1936) and "Die Frage nach dem 
Ursprung der Geometrie als intentional-historisches 
Problem" ( 1939) -
led him to a complete rejection 
ofphenomenology altogether. The practica/ results of 
Husserl 's analyses are incompatible with the theoreti-
cal framework in which they originated. MEANING that 
originates at the pre-predicative level cannot be the 
work of a transcendental ego who constitutes the mean-
ing ofthe world outside of space and time, but is, rather, 
the work of a consciousness immersed in a histori-
cal becoming. Husserl's transcendental EGO turns out 
to be the actual consciousness of each human being, 
within their own actual experience. At this juncture, 
Thao points out, Husserl falls into a total relativism: 
"the merchant at the market has his own market truth." 
Husserl 's theory of the constitution of the world with 
the contemplation of eterna! essences turns out to be 
a nihilism; therein consists the crisis of Western hu-
manity, which in turn gave birth to irrational humanity, 
the existential human being whose claim is that the 
only sense of life is the lack of any sense, or MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER 's "being-toward-death." 
The solution to the crisis of Western humanity and 
others !ies for Thao in dialectica! materialism, thus the 
second part of the book: "The dialectic of real move-
ment." What Thao stresses here is Husserl 's investi-
galion turned right side up, by ridding it of idealistic 
formalism and thereby constructing a new rationality, 
a stress on the concrete contents of experience. The 
relationship between consciousness and its intentiona! 
object is explicated by reference to the pre-predicative 
level of conscious experience mediated by human la-
hor. "The notion of production takes into full account 
the enigma of consciousness inasmuch as the object 
that is worked on takes its meaning for man as a hu-
man product." The realizing of meaning is precisely 
nothing but the symbolic transposition of the material 
operations of production into a system of intentiona! 
operations in which the subject appropriates the object 
ideally, in reproducing it in his or her own conscious-
ness. "This is true reason for man, who, as being in 
the world, constitutes the world in the intensity of his 
lived experience." And the truth of any constitution 
such as this is measured only by the actual power ofthe 
mode ofproduction from which it takes its model. The 
humanization of nature through labor is how Thao ac-
counts for how matters become life and, consequently, 
assumes human value. 
Tran Duc Thao !ater frankly admits that an interpre-
tation ofMarxism subject to the conditions of a person-
ality cult engulfed Phenomenologie et materialisme di-
alectique in a hopeless metaphysical juxtaposition of 
phenomenological content to material content which 
paved the way for the return of an idealistic dualism. 
In his studies between 1960 and 1970, Thao found 
that in order to avoid this danger, he had to minimize 
phenomenology, without thereby overcoming the jux-
taposition. These essays form his second major work: 
Recherches sur l 'origine du langage et de la conscience 
(Investigations into the origin of language and con-
sciousness, 1973). His analyses are divided into three 
parts: ( 1) the origin of consciousness by means of the 
indicative gesture, (2) the birth of LANGUAGE and the 
making of tools, and (3) Marxism and PSYCHOANALY-
srs. We will briefiy outline the first two investigations, 
for they truly present Thao's original contribution to 
the fields of anthropology, linguistics, and, of course, 
philosophy. 
Thao's investigation into the genesis of conscious-

TRAN DUC THAO 
705 
ness finds it tobe due to the development oflanguage, 
which, in turn, is generated by human activity in the 
development of material conditions that precisely com-
prises human labor as social labor. The transition from 
animal psychism to human consciousness is effected 
by the prehominid. What distinguishes the prehominid 
from the animal is the indicative sign, which consti-
tutes the original form of consciousness. The indica-
tive sign consists in pointing to a "relatively" distant 
object and thus establishing a relationship between the 
subject (prehominid) and an object that is externa! and 
independent. The reader will recognize here Thao's 
vers ion ofphenomenology's thesis ofthe INTENTIONAL-
ITY of consciousness, which states that consciousness 
is always consciousness of an object. Animals are in-
capable of pointing or indicating anything whatsoever 
as a distant or externa! object. At the prehominid stage, 
however, indicative gestures -
pointing to the game 
to be chased -
serve to coordinate group movement 
in hunting expeditions. As yet the indicative gesture 
remains a natural and unconscious gesture as it occurs 
only in an immediate biologica! situation. This uncon-
scious gesture will become conscious when the mem-
bers of the hunting expedition will not only indicate 
game to other members, but to themselves individu-
ally, which means that the material gesture advances 
from a linear form (indicating the object to others) to 
a circular one (signifying back to oneselfas a member 
of the group ). The reciprocity of the indicati ve ges-
ture is thus essential not only for consciousness, but 
more importantly, for self-consciousness. Humanity's 
objective material relationship with the environment 
entails a meaning experienced immediately, before it 
emerges on the conscious level as language. Thus there 
is a language ofreallife that develops for the material 
conditions of sociallife. Language is not arbitrary; it is 
a foundational moment of consciousness. Conscious-
ness is language, pre-thematic or subconscious at first 
insofar as it is immersed in action, and thematic or fully 
conscious when the lived experience of material con-
ditions is interrupted, providing thereby a pause- the 
pause that is precisely what occasions consciousness 
to take a look at or reftect upon that experience. 
For Tran Duc Thao the origin of humanity, i.e., 
the moment when prehominid became hominid, co-
incides with the elaboration of the instrument into a 
tool. The most intelligent of the higher apes, such as 
chimpanzees, can only use their hands, and when they 
manipulate objects they do so only to satisfy their iru-
mediate biologica! needs. Here Thao makes an enor-
mously vital distinction between the instrument and 
the tool. The instrument as a separate or externa! ob-
ject tobe manipulated by the organism is never viewed 
as separate or externa!. The animal works only under 
the compulsion of a situation of biologica! need, and 
thus can never abstract the moment of labor for the 
satisfaction of a need to introduce a mediating element 
between itself and the object of need. The object of 
biologica! need always occupies a central position to 
the animal's perceptual field. Hence it cannot go be-
yond the stage of immediate and direct manipulation, 
since the total dynamic field does not allow for the 
introduction of a second object, in other words, does 
not allow for mediation, which is precisely what com-
prises thinking. With humans, however, the needed 
object is transformed through the mediation ofthe tool 
into an object of labor. Thus productive labor, which 
marks the beginning of human activity, and the tran-
sition from nature to culture, becomes possible only 
when prehominids have gone beyond simple pointing. 
At this stage they are already capable of an idealizing 
representation of the absent object to themselves, but 
they can also create the ideal and typical form to be 
actualized in the tool. 
Hence the transition from the presentative indica-
tive sign of the absent this is the first form of reftec-
tion and the manifestation of that "liberation of the 
brain" whereby humans transcend the limitations of 
the present situation, which always imprisons the ani-
mal. After a certain dialectica! development, however, 
it also permits them to escape reality and confine them-
selves to symbolic construction by denying the reality 
of human life. Idealism is born from the transforma-
tion ofthese symbolic constructions into principles and 
therefore the negation of objective reality. Thus ideal-
ism, according to Thao, must once aga in be turned right 
side up. 
When years !ater Tran Duc Thao carne to reftect 
upon this investigation, he confessed to having become 
stagnated on the pure formalism ofthe threefold com-
bination ofthe (here or absent) "this" (T) in the motion 
(M) ofthe form (F). At the same time, the development 
ofthese figures should have been able to account forthe 
development of the various semiotic structures of lan-

706 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
guages as they originate in both humanity and the child. 
But a purely mechanistic combination done almost en-
tirely within the horizon of dialectica! materialism was 
expected to bridge the gap between the animal and the 
human. Thus Thao concluded that he had confused two 
entirely different semiotic formations -
the gestures 
of the prehominid and language properly so-called, or 
verbal language which is specific to humans -
in a 
single confused representation of language. In short, 
from the years 1960-70 to the early 1980s, Thao was 
confusing the gestures ofthe prehominid with the lan-
guage of early humans so that, on the semiotic plane, 
he was suppressing the essential difference between 
the most evolved animal and the most primitive hu-
man by reducing the specificity ofhuman language to 
the development of a simple combination of emotions 
and gestural signs. This reduction, Thao admits, was 
due to the mechanistic metaphysics, a metaphysics that 
denies the dialectica! unity of human history, thereby 
depriving humanity of its real meaning. 
Thao confesses that the third investigation, "Marx-
ism and Psychoanalysis," was written primarily as 
a concession to the times. The events of 1968 had 
profoundly influenced inteliectual Communists who 
naively thought that PSYCHOANALYSIS was promising 
the world by shedding light upon the mystery of lan-
guage. It did not take long for Thao to realize that 
psychoanalysis would be ofno help with regard to the 
problem of sentence formation. 
Mention has already been made that in his 
Recherches sur l 'origine du langage et de la conscience 
Tran Duc Thao had tried to correct Phimomenologie 
et materialisme dialectique by minimizing or even 
neglecting phenomenology in order to undertake an 
entirely materialistic approach to the genesis of con-
sciousness, one rid ofphenomenological subjectivism. 
This neglect, confesses Thao, was not so much a matter 
of choice as a response to the dictates of the politica! 
dogmatic deformation of Marxism engendered by the 
"proletarian cultural revolution." Today, Thao could 
rid himself of ali philosophical taboos by developing 
a knowledge of humanity thereby restoring the dialec-
tica! unity of both theory and practice in a globalistic 
comprehension of world history. 
Tran Duc Thao retumed to France in September 
1991, taking up residence in Paris in order to renew 
his, by now, enthusiastic research with the aim of elab-
orating the project of the unification of science and 
philosophy starting with the origins of consciousness 
and its development with the historicity of the world. 
Enriched now by the contributions of Husserlian stud-
ies ofhis third period, Thao began to write feverishly, 
intuiting correctly that he had little time left in which 
to author what would be his last book. It was not to 
be completed, for Thao died tragicaliy as a result of an 
accidental fali on April24, 1993. He was seventy six. 
Tran Duc Thao and DANIEL HERMAN, his major En-
glish translator, became very active correspondents for 
about a year before his sudden death. Herman was 
translating his unpublished French manuscripts as soon 
as he would receive them from Thao, who hoped that 
his forthcoming book would somehow alieviate his 
dire financial situation as weli as leave to posterity his 
final philosophical testament. This testament now con-
sists ofthree essays with two appendices. One ofthese 
essays with the appendices was published by Analecta 
Husserliana in 1995. 
The first essay "Pour une logique formelie et dialec-
tique," sets up dialectica! logic in stark opposition to 
formal LOGIC that, at first impression, would lead one 
to think that the former logic is very much in opposi-
tion to the customary way of thinking. Formal logic, 
with the "three laws of thought" comprising its back-
bone, considers the present instant to be immobile, so 
that movement would constitute a passage from one 
immobile instant to the next, with the net result that 
formal logic could not possibly be faithful to reality, 
as movement would turn out tobe a succession ofjux-
taposed instants. Such a metaphysical conception of 
things that thinks in terms of strong disjunctions -
eitherlor, yeslno- is a thought that thinks outside of 
time, outside of the temporal flow. Against this false 
metaphysics according to which something either ex-
ists or not, Heraclitus a vers to the contrary, "everything 
is and at the same time is not, for it flows." · 
This formal logic with its successive instants was 
also refuted by HEGEL when he rejected the excluded 
middle term. Formal logic says that something is ei-
ther A or "'A; there is no middle term, to which Hegel 
replies that there is a third term in that very same the-
sis. A is itself that third term, for A can either A+ or 
"'A. Thus A is itself the third term that o ne wants to ex-
el ude. The formula ofHeraclitus, taken up by Hegel-
"everything is and equally is not'' -
was abbreviated

707 
in such a way as to give rise to regrettable confusions, 
for one was led to think that for dialectica! logic being 
itself is not, which is contrary to common sense. Thus 
both logics, opposed to each other as they were, had 
to be synthesized, sin ce both did justice to reality and 
common sense. 
According to Thao, in "La dialectique comme dy-
namique de la temporalization," this task was left to 
Husserl, and was accomplished by means of the tem-
poralization in the living present. Real time, according 
to Husserl, is not clock time as Aristotle conceived 
of it in his famous definition, "time is the measure of 
motion, according to a before and an after," a defini-
tion that until Husserl had never been challenged. Thao 
seems to forget Bergson here, since his famous distinc-
tion between clock time and real duration undoubtedly 
influenced Husserl. Be that as it may, Aristotle's con-
ception of time makes the instant an immobile instant, 
and motion is once again made incomprehensible, for 
how can it be reconstructed given its immobility? For 
Husserl, on the other hand, "the present that flows (i.e., 
the living present) is the present of the movement of 
flowing, of having flowed, and of having yet to flow. 
The now, the continuity of the past, and the living 
horizon ofthe future outlined in protention occur con-
sciously 'at the same time' in an 'at the same time' 
that flows." With phenomenological time, time is no 
longer considered as a fourth dimension of space, says 
Thao, and we are now able effectively to reconstruct 
history as the measuring ofhumanity with its wealth of 
real relations instead of as the abstraction of recipro-
ca! relations. Thus Thao applies the theory ofthe living 
present in "La theorie du present vivant comme theorie 
de l'individualite" as a theory that alone can account 
for individuality in the sciences, especially biology. 
Thao once again finds fault with Aristotle when he 
maintained that "science concerns only the general, 
existence concerns only the singular." For over two 
thousand years this Aristotelian motto went unchal-
lenged, or a science of singular existence was never 
fully considered, even though in its practica! applica-
tion science had to deal with that existence. Those very 
dealings, however, only amounted to meeting points. 
Science would never grasp existence in itself or the 
singular individual as such with the individuality of 
the existence being reduced as it was to an abstract 
point. The living present, continues Thao, is first of ali 
and essentially the concrete individuality of singular 
existence constituting itself at each instant in the tem-
poralization or intrinsic movement ofthat very instant, 
in its interval ofbecoming- the completion of which 
is accomplished by itself in its passage to the following 
instant. 
The evidence of the interna! dialectic of the !iv-
ing present can be found in the analysis of biologica! 
temporalization. Suffice it to say, in Thao's own words, 
that "at each instant biologica! individuality surges as a 
system offunctions inherited from the past, that which 
has been sedimented in its past and yet remains actu-
ally present in retention which blends with the actual 
now, which provoked tension in the metabolism ofthe 
functioning ofthese functions, or inprotention into the 
imminent future." 
It is sincerely hoped that Tran Duc Thao, emi-
nent Marxist and phenomenologist, will finally tind 
his rightful place in the global history of meaning.

TRUTH 
In the Logische Untersuchungen 
( 1900-1901) EDMUND HUSSERL gives an account oftruth 
that in ali its variants is based on EVIDENCE. He does 
not share the traditional view thatjudgment is the only 
place of truth. Even simple objects -
e.g., sensuous 
objects- can be intuitively (evidently) given and in 
this sense be "true." Nor can Husserl 's concept oftruth 
be reduced to the traditional idea of a correspondence 
or adequatio between thought and object, despite his 
use on severa! occasions ofthe term "correspondence." 
Transcendental philosophy inquires after the mode 
and the conditions of possibility in which an object 
and beliefs are constituted in consciousness. We be-
lieve that objects exist and that they ha ve certain qual-
ities. But in the transcendental perspective we cannot 
presuppose the existence of real objects that are pre-
given independently of our consciousness ofthem and 
to which our consciousness has only to adjust. (We 
tind this notion objected to already in KANT's Kritik 
der reinen Vernunft.) In the Logische Untersuchun-
gen Husserl avoids the model of a correspondence of 
thought and object. Rather, he searches for the condi-
tions of possibility of the correspondence among dif-
ferent subjective acts that refer to the same object. 
He recognizes the correspondence ofmy judging with 
the judging of others as weli as the coherence of my 
own intendings in their referring to the same object 
as conditions of objectivity and objective truth. Both 
are founded on the possibility of having intuitions of 
objects and state of affairs. The idea of objectivity 
implies that the intended object is valid at ali times 
and for everyone, and is thus communicable. We ha ve 
to make clear how it is possible to express states of 
affairs in an appropriate form of communication and 
conversely, how by understanding this expression, we 
can relate it back to an act, possibly even an intuitive 
one. This means that everyone (including myself) can 
actualize the very same meaning, whether emptily in-
tended or intuitively given. Objectivity and objective 
truth are founded on the possibility ofhaving identica! 
MEANING. 
Truth for Husserl is connected with evidence, i.e., 
where objects and states ofaffairs are given intuitively 
as they themselves are oras given in person. Evidence 
always has degrees and levels. The levels of evidence 
are connected to the modes of apprehension. The low-
est degree of evidence is formed by signitive ( or sym-
bolic) acts. Signitive acts intend their object by asso-
ciation, i.e., by using a sign. Pictorial acts represent 
their objects by means of an image, i.e., analogically. 
Among pictorial acts there are differences of intuitive-
ness, depending on the number of details represented 
and the degree of similarity. The maximum intuitive-
ness in pictorial acts is achieved by the representa-
tion of ali individual elements in the greatest possible 
similarity to what is intended. Intuitive acts, however, 
present the object itself, even if only by perspectiva! 
adumbrations, e.g., in the intuition of real things. The 
ideal aim ofthis gradualiy increasing fulfillment of an 
intuitive intention is termed adequate evidence. In ad-
equate evidence every perspective of an object would 
be presented at once in the most intuitive way. 
Evidence is not a feeling that guarantees beyond 
doubt the truth of a judgment. Evidence is not a cri-
terion of an absolute and unchangeable truth. Husserl 
characterizes evidence as the experience of truth, i.e., 
as an intentiona! act in which the intended object is 
presented intuitively, though in different degrees of 
fulfiliment. Evidence always has degrees. The possi-
bility of increasing the degree of evidence sometimes 
(though not in every case) leads to the ideal aim ofad-

TRUTH 
equate evidence in which the object is given just as it 
is intended. In adequate evidence each partial intention 
is perfectly fulfilled. 
Husserl 's first concept of truth (T 1) is grounded in 
the concept of adequate evidence. In §39 of the sixth 
ofthe Logische Untersuchungen, Husserl characterizes 
subjective (noetic) truth as an act in which there is a 
perfect coincidence ofthe intended and the intuitively 
given. TI can be described objectively (noematicalty) 
as the objective correlate of this act of adequate evi-
dence. Truth is the objective correlate o fan act that both 
identifies the object and at the same time intuitively and 
completely fulfills its intention. Thus Husserl can speak 
oftruth as an identity. In adequate evidence we experi-
ence the complete coincidence ofthe emptily intended 
and the intuitively given. 
Sensuous perception of real objects is never com-
pletely adequate. Objects in time and space always 
have a non-visible side and change through time. 
Propositions conceming the real world can only be 
valid presumptively. They are valid only until they 
are "invatidated" by new experience. In contrast, the 
achievement in adequation of an unchangeable "truth 
in itself' (established once and for alt) is an ideal that 
can only be realized in LOGIC and MATHEMATICS. Husserl 
uses the concept of a "truth in itself," derived from 
Bolzano, in his search in the Logische Untersuchungen 
for a foundation of pure logic. Later on he recognized 
that his concept was to close to Leibniz's verites de 
raison. 
But every truth, even that which presents itself as 
valid "in itself," has to legitimate itself in acts of our 
consciousness and, from a transcendental perspective, 
it thus contains an unavoidable relation to its consti-
tution in subjective acts. In the use of adequate evi-
dence as the foundation of his concept of truth there 
!ies hidden (at least in the Logische Untersuchun-
gen) another presupposition: I cannot doubt adequate 
evidence. Adequacy impties apodicticity. In the first 
book of his Ideen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie 
und phănomenologischen Philosophie ( 1913) Husserl 
loosens this connection by pointing out that evidence 
is bound up with a concordant and continuous synthe-
sis. Thus even evidence presumed to be adequate can 
be disappointed in further experience. Adequate evi-
dence is no longer presupposed as an achievable aim. 
Now adequation is characterized as a regulative idea 
709 
in Kant's sense. In his !ater work Husserl recognizes 
that even apodictic evidence can be disappointed, but 
only by means of another apodictic evidence. Truth re-
mains the correlate of originary evidence, which is the 
"source of alt justification." In Cartesianische Med-
itationen [ 1931] Husserl points out that there can be 
apodictic evidences of objects, e.g., the ego cogito, that 
are not adequately given. 
In §39 of the Sixth Investigation, Husserl presents 
three supplementary concepts oftruth. They appear to 
point back to the first concept oftruth (TI) and expli-
cate individual aspects of the coincidence of intention 
and intuition by reformulating them in the form of sep-
arate concepts oftruth. 
While TI is directed to the provisional empirica! 
experience of evidence, the fult concept of truth goes 
beyond the experience of an individual act. The objec-
tivity of truth implies validity for everyone and at alt 
times. The second concept of truth (T2) is character-
ized as the relation of complete fulfiltment on the level 
of eidetic laws, i.e., as an idea. The ideal relationship 
of total coincidence of an intending act with a fulfilt-
ing act is taken as the idea of absolute adequacy. Its 
correlate is the idea of truth. 
The third concept of truth (T3) is oriented to the ful-
filting, intuitive act and is characterized as the evidence 
ofthe intuitively given object. The given object is ex-
perienced as the fulfilting or "truth-making" object of 
an intention. Even in the Logische Untersuchungen this 
concept (T3) maintains priority in regard to the other 
concepts oftruth. As a designation ofthe truth-making 
intuition it sustains TI and thus also its ideatized ver-
sion T2. Hen ce as the truth-making evidence, T3 has to 
be the foundation of every traditional concept of truth 
as "coincidence." In Ideen !Husserl mentions only T3, 
although with the qualification that adequate evidence 
is only a regulati ve idea. In Formale und transzenden-
tale Logik ( 1929) he mentions that T3 is "in itself' the 
first concept of truth. 
Thefourth concept oftruth (T4) is characterized as 
correctness of judging. The judgment (and its expres-
sion in language) has to adjust itself with re gard to 
the intuitively given object. The proposition "corrects" 
itself with respect to the intuitive state of affairs. In 
Formale und transzendentale Logik Husserl points out 
that T4 is the concept of critically justified truth which 
is the aim of science. 

710 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
In the Logische Untersuchungen, the contrary con-
cept of falsehood is presented (analogously with the 
concept of truth) as a negative ideal of ultimate dis-
appointment. In the case of falsehood, disappointment 
and conflict do not simply indicate the mere lack of ev-
idence, but rather rest on the intuition of a conflicting 
intention. Thus falsehood is dependent on the intuition 
of an opposed state ofaffairs. The first conviction is an-
nulled by the intuition ofthe opposite case. The priority 
of T3 manifests itself in the fact that truth and false-
hood can only be grounded in evidence. Thus truth in 
the sense of T3 can ha ve no counterconcept of false-
hood. The mere lack of evidence is not an evidence for 
the opposite fact. T3 is the foundation ofpropositional 
truth because it allows a correspondence (in the sense 
of T4) of the proposition with the intuitively given 
state of affairs (in the sense of T3). Thus the compli-
cated problem of propositional truth can only become 
intelligible when the process of categoria! intuition is 
elucidated. 
Each of the concepts T2-T4 thematizes a certain 
aspect of T 1 : T2 characterizes the idea of truth, while 
T3 refers to the basic concept of fulfilling evidence. 
And in T4 we see that T3 is the primary starting point 
ofHusserl's theory of evidence and truth. The concept 
T4 stresses that the intention has to adjust itselfto the 
intuitively given object. As the proposition "corrects" 
itself it "moves" el o ser to the intuitive state of affairs. 
When we tie truth and especially propositional truth 
to evidence, we need to extend the concept ofintuition. 
Not only can there be intuition of real concrete sensu-
ous objects, there can also be intuition of states of af-
fairs. Husserl ca lis the latter categoria! intuition. Propo-
sitional truth is grounded in the intuition of a state of 
affairs. But we should not forget that intuitively given 
sensuous objects can be "true" in the sense offulfilling 
evidence. 
In his !ater work Husserl examines the foundation 
and the sense ofthe modern sciences. They understand 
the concept of truth as correctness (T4) as a critica! 
approximation to "the" truth. Formal logic (with the 
logica! principle ofthe excluded middle) and the exact 
sciences understand truth and falsehood as a quality 
that belongs to the ideal judgment once and for ali. 
In this idealized view every proposition is "in itself' 
true or false. Husserl inquires after the justification 
ofthese idealized principles in his genetic phenomen-
ology by tracing their evidence back to the originary 
evidence of individual objects. In this respect logic 
needs a theory of experience. Husserl carries out this 
recourse to the experience of individual objects as the 
substrate of the most basic type of evidence in Er-
fahrung und Urteil (1939). In this work his interest is 
the realm of pre-predicative experience and its trans-
formation in predicative judgment. He is searching in 
the realm of pre-predicative experience for the origin 
ofthe basic logica! categories that are given in nucleo 
in pre-predicative experience and that are transformed 
into their complete form in predicative activity. Thus 
we find a renewed interest in the problem of the ful-
fillment of categoria! intuition from the perspective of 
GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY. 
From the point of view of a sense-critique of sci-
ence, the problem of the justification of idealizations 
leads to an extension of the phenomenology to the 
realm ofuFEWORLD. The idealizations (the principle of 
the excluded middle, the idea of an unextended center 
ofgravity) in the context oflogic and the exact sciences 
are self-evident presuppositions. If we are aiming at a 
critique of idealizations we must lea ve the judgments 
of experience in full concreteness, and therefore we 
ha ve to investigate them outside of the scientific con-
text in the prescientific lifeworld. Methodologically, it 
is reasonable that an idealization can only be justified in 
a realm in which it is not valid in a self-evident way. In 
the lifeworld there are only truths that are subjectively 
and historically relative to the situation. How is it pos-
sible against this background to show the justification 
ofthe idealized exact scientific truth? We cannot claim 
that the lifeworld in which we live every day is presci-
entific. The insights of the idealizing modern sciences 
are constantly "flowing into" our concrete Iifeworld. 
In Die Krisis der europăischen Wissenschaften und die 
transzendentale Phănomenologie ( 1936) Husserl uses 
the EIDETIC METHOD to find the nonrelative structures 
that remain the same in every concrete surrounding 
world. These nonrelative structures he will call "the" 
lifeworld and he believes them to be an appropriate 
justification for scientific idealities. 
In his existential ontology, MARTIN HEIDEGGER 
searches in a completely different way for an origi-
nary dimension of truth that can be the basis for an 
understanding of propositional truth and the traditional 
concept of truth as correspondence. He criticizes the 

TRUTH 
traditional concept of adaequatio intellectus et rei. He 
asks for the sense ofthe correspondence, which seems 
to him to be very general and empty. In which sense 
do thought and abject correspond (Sein und Zei!, §44 
[ 1927])? Intellectus cannot refer to the judgment as 
a real event but only to the ideal contents of judg-
ment. Yet how can we conceive of truth as a relation 
between the ideal contents of a proposition and the 
real abject ontologically? For Heidegger the attempt 
to clarify truth as correspondence is misleading. The 
positing of the members of the relation of correspon-
dence in two different regions of being does not suit 
the problem. 
Heidegger's way of understanding the originary 
phenomenon oftruth is to "make clear the mode ofbe-
ing ofthe cognition itself." His starting point is apropo-
sition that is not based on intuition. Someone says with 
his or her back to the wall: this picture hangs askew. 
The proposition embodies the claim to ha ve discovered 
the picture (as a being) in the "how" (the mode) ofits 
being. The proposition displays this "how" of being 
in LANGUAGE. In the attempt to verify the proposition 
by sensuous experience, the recognition, according to 
Heidegger, is directed only to the intended being (the 
picture) and not to the proposition. It is directed to the 
being itself (which is to be verified by perception) in 
its mode of uncoveredness (Entdeckt-heit), i.e., in its 
showing-itself. Confirmation (Bewahrung) means this 
showing-itself of the being in the same way in which 
it is intended in the proposition. 
A true proposition shows the being in its mode of 
uncoveredness. The phenomenon of "originary truth" 
does not have the character of correspondence. It is 
the ground of the concept of truth in the sense of cor-
respondence and propositional truth. By unfolding the 
meaning of aletheia Heidegger shows us a more orig-
inary sense of truth as unconcealment ( Unverborgen-
heit). He wants to show that this concept coincides 
with the first and originary concept of truth in Greek 
thinking. In this primary sense only the discovering hu-
man DASEIN can be "true" while it is Being-discovering 
(Entdeckend-Sein). On the other hand, beings (Seien-
des) that we can find in the world can only "be" in a 
secondary mode, i.e., as being-discovered (Entdeckt-
sein). They can only make a claim to uncoveredness. 
Their fundament is the Being-discovering of the hu-
man Dasein. The being-true of a discovered being is 
711 
only possible as being discovered by human Dasein as 
being-in-the-world. 
The authentic Being of Dasein, the being-in-the-
truth, presupposes disclosedness (Erschlossenheit) of 
the world in states-of-mind (Befindlichkeiten), under-
standing, and discourse, i.e., the constitution ofthe be-
ing (Seinsverfassung) of human Dasein as thrownness 
( Geworfenheit) and project (Entwurf). The mode ofbe-
ing ofDasein is characterized equiprimordially (gleich-
urspriinglich) by the possibility of both authenticity 
(being-in-the-truth) and the deficient mode (Verfalls-
form) ofinauthenticity. In the mode ofthe "they" (das 
Man ), of obstruction ( Verstelltheit), of gossip ( Gerede ), 
Dasein is in untruth. Thus the being-in-the-world of 
human Dasein is determined at the same time by truth 
and untruth. We must always fight anew for the truth 
of Dasein (Being-discovering). Following Heidegger, 
the negative expression "a-letheia" expresses the fact 
that hiding itself is a main characteristic of Being. In 
the hiding-itself of Being, human Dasein is hidden for 
itself in the mode ofuntruth. 
Heidegger wants to make evident how the transi-
tion from the originary concept of truth as aletheia to 
"correspondence" came about. He wants to make clear 
that correspondence is only a derived form oftruth: in 
a proposition Being should be displayed in the mode 
of its uncoveredness. In the inauthentic forms of mere 
reproducing and hearsay, the proposition becomes it-
self something ready-to-hand (Zuhandenes). Thus we 
have to engage in the demonstration of the uncov-
eredness that is preserved in the proposition. In this 
way the relation between proposition and discovered 
being then itself becomes something present-at-hand 
(Vorhandenes) and can be understood as a correspon-
dence of proposition and being (intellectus and res). 
The fact that we are used to disregarding the originary 
dimension of truth is an aspect of our forgetfulness of 
Being (Seinsvergessenheit). 
The originary dimension of truth in human Dasein 
"is given" (gibt es) only as long as there is Dasein. Ali 
truth is relative to the being of Dasein. Thus the claim 
that there could be "eterna! truth" seems to Heidegger 
to be "fantastic." Against the background of this rela-
tivity of truth to the being of Dasein, Heidegger asks 
anew: why must we presuppose that truth "is given"? 
His answer is that the possibility oftruth (authenticity) 
and untruth (inauthenticity) belongs to the facticity of 

712 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
human Dasein. From the point of view of existential 
ontology, the being of human Dasein (its disclosed-
ness) and truth are synonyms. 
Heidegger's "Kehre" in his !ater philosophy- e.g., 
in "Vom Wesen des Grundes" ( 1929) and "Vom Wesen 
der Wahrheit" ( 1930)- includes a modified approach 
to the problem oftruth. In the Kehre Heidegger defini-
tively lays asi de the idea of a final foundation ( oftruth) 
in subjectivity. He determines the essence of truth as 
"freedom," i.e., as "Freisein zum Offenbaren eines Of-
fenen" or, otherwise put, as "Seinlassen des Seienden." 
In opposition to Sein und Zeit, where he understands 
freedom as a project from out of the situation into 
which Dasein is thrown, freedom is now characterized 
as the revealing (Entbergung) of Being. This event 
(Geschehen) occurs (ereignet sich) in human Dasein, 
but it is hubris (Vermessenheit) if humans take them-
selves as the measure of ali beings. Ek-sistent, reveal-
ing Dasein owns humankind, so that the appropriate 
attitude towards the originary truth of Being (as such 
in totality) is no longer a decisive project, but rather 
releasement ( Gelassenheit).

UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS 
Interest in phenomenology existed in RUSSIA as far 
back as the beginning of the 20th century, yet direct 
inheritance and continuation was precluded. The of-
ficial ruling ideology in the USSR (1922-1991) was 
MARXISM and developments independent of Marxism 
were impossible. However, with the weakening of the 
totalitarian system, the 1960s witnessed the beginning 
ofthe study ofphenomenology. The studies ofpheno-
menology in the USSR will be shown by naming the 
authors and works discussing phenomenology under 
the rubric ofthe critique of modern bourgeois philoso-
phy and by naming the outstanding phi1osophers who 
have thought in the phenomenological way. 
The Georgian phi1osopher KOTE BAKRADZE was the 
first to bring up phenomenology in the 1960s. He had 
heard EDMUND HUSSERL 's lectures at Gi:ittingen during 
1922-25 and had written books about HEGEL 's method 
and system, existentialism, pragmatism, and logic. He 
published Psichologizm i chistaya logika (Gusserl) 
(Psychologism and pure logic [Husserl]) in Ocherki po 
istorii noveischei i sovremennoi Burzhuaznoi Filosofii 
( Outlines of the new history of contemporary bourgeois 
phi1osophy, 1960, republished in Izbranniefilosofskie 
trudi. Tom. 3 [Selected philosophical works, Voi. 3, 
1973]). 
Bakradze analysed Husserl 's Logische Unter-
suchungen ( 1900--1901) and fully agreed with the ar-
guments against psychologism, but claimed that while 
fighting against psychologizing TRUTH, Husserl goes 
to the other extreme and ontologizes truth and sepa-
rates it from the process of cognition. He criticized 
Husserl from the materialist standpoint at the end of 
the 1920s when he, like the other outstanding Geor-
gian philosophers SHALBA NUTSUBIDZE, SERGI DANELIA, 
and DMITREY UZNADZE, accepted Marxism. Truth can 
be an adequate reflection of the objective state of af-
fairs (Sachverhalt) in consciousness and does not de-
pend on the structures of consciousness. That is why 
Bakradze discarded Husserl 's theory of intuition and 
replaced the relation of epistemological evidence with 
the Marxian concept of practice. The principles of tran-
scendental phenomenology and egological solipsism, 
according to Bakradze, are inherent in the standpoint of 
the Untersuchungen. It is also not explained there what 
phenomenology as descriptive psychology is, what the 
relations among meaning and the object, truth, and ev-
idence are, and how intention is realized. Thus pheno-
menology cannot be developed as a unitary trend. 
Bakradze's disciple ZURAB KAKABADZE, continued 
the study of phenomenology in Georgia with Prob-
lema ekzistentsialnovo krizitsa i transtsendentalnaya 
fenomenologiya Edmunda Gusserla (The problem 
of existential crises and the transcendental pheno-
menology of Edmund Husserl, 1966). The influence 
of phenomenologica1 thinking is manifested also in 
his Chelovek kak filosofskaiya problema (The Hu-
man as philosopohical problem, 1970), Khelovneba, 
pilosopia da sitzotzkhle (Art, philosophy, and life, 
1979), Fenomen iskusstva (Art phenomenon, 1980), 
and Problema chelovecheskovo bytiya (The problem 
ofthe human being, 1985). Husserl 's maxim: "Back to 
the matters themselves" was concretized in the Kak-
abadzean maxim "back to man himself." He criticized 
Husserl for his underestimation of genuine subjectiv-
ity and wrote that transcendental subjectivity turned 
out to be "ideal" a la objective idealism. The subject 
is thus "objectified," and loses its "self," individual-
ity, and freedom. The superior mode of being is for 
Kakabadze the being ofthe subject, a personality. The 
human being experiences his or her ethical duty in a 
universally valid tendency of being and in a deep de-
sire for the subject 's inner cal! ing. Human freedom and 
creativity can be regarded as the highest stage of the 
general tendencies ofbeing. 
Kakabadze 's thesis of the free and creative person-
ality corresponded to the spiritual demands ofthe post-
Stalinist time. Nevertheless, he was strongly criticized 
for abstract humanism and for negating the Marxist 
view of social and class values. His humanistic philos-
ophy had a great influence on the younger generation 
ofphilosophers in Georgia, Latvia, Ukraine, Moscow, 
and Leningrad. His last works were devoted to harmo-
nious relationships between human beings and nature. 
The defence of human being means "going back to 
nature itself." The roots ofthe ECOLOGICAL crisis lie in

taking nature for an inert object that serves human will. 
Humankind and nature must be understood as perme-
ated by the common universal tendencies ofbeing. 
The Georgian phiJosopher A.T. BOCORISHVILI aJso 
turned to phenomenology. In Problema nachala poz-
naniya v B. Rassela i E. Gusserlya (The problem 
of the origins of knowledge in B. Russell and E. 
Husserl, 1969), V. ARCHIL BEGIASHVILI compared posi-
tions on the process of cognition. GIVI MARGVELASHVILI 
reflected on the relationships of phenomenology with 
EXISTENTIALISM and LITERATURE in Syuhetnoe vremya 
i vremya exzistentsii (Time of the plot and the time 
of existence, 1976). His Aksiologicheskoe znachenie 
razlichiya mezhdu ekzistentsialnim i kategorialnim v 
Haidegerovskom ontologicheskom uchenii (The axio-
logica! meaning of the difference between the exis-
tential and the categorica! in Heidegger's ontology, 
1979) shows axiologica! aspects in Heidegger's phi-
losophy. GEORGI TSINTSADZE contrasted existentialism 
(MARTIN HEIDEGGER and KARL JASPERS) with the concep-
tion of personality as existing only within the dialogue 
of I and Thou. These views are summarized in his 
Metod ponimaniya v filosofii i problema lichnosti (The 
method of understanding in philosophy and the prob-
lem ofthe person, 1975) andPirovneba, dro, gantzkoba 
(Human being, personality, and time, 1982). In Geor-
gia GEORGI SHUSHANASHVILI a1so worked in phenomen-
oJogicaJ ethics. 
In the mid-J960s in Moscow, NELU MOTROSHILOVA 
became the leading specialist in phenomenology. In 
Printsipi i protivorechiya fenomenologicheskoi filosofii 
(Principles and contradictions in phenomenological 
philosophy, 1968) she described the principal concepts 
ofHusserl's phenomenology and paved the way for an 
officially acknow1edged interest in phenomenology in 
the USSR. Motroshilova had many disciples, both in 
Moscow and in the republics of the union, who stud-
ied phenomenology under the rubric of the critique of 
bourgeois philosophy. She has published articles on the 
way ofphenomenology from an idea to a strict science, 
Husserl and ROMAN INGARDEN, the understanding ofthe 
history of philosophy in Husserl, phenomenological 
method, the Logische Untersuchungen, and other top-
ics. She also specialized in the Western philosophy of 
17th and 18th centuries and Hegel. 
Articles on phenomenology in Soviet enyclopedias 
and dictionaries in the 1970s and 1980s were written 
by ALEXANDR OGURTSOV. His articJe on phenomenoJogy 
in the Bolshaya Sovetskaya entsiklopediya (Great So-
viet encyclopedia, Voi. 27, 1972) mentions not only 
the shortcomings of phenomenology from the Marx-
ist point of view -
i.e., subjectivism, disconnected-
ness from the methodology of the natural sciences, 
and scholasticism- but also the positive features: the 
critique of scientism, positivism, and NATURALISM; the 
understanding of the crisis of Western cu! ture; and a 
thorough analysis of consciousness. In the entry on 
"Phenomeno1ogy" in the five-volume Filosofoskaya 
entsiklopediya (Philosophical encyclopedia, 1960--70), 
he emphasized the evolution of Husserl 's idea of a 
descriptive, transcendental, and absolute phenomen-
ology, meaning the !ater Husserl 's turning toward abso-
lute experience as a universal field for a different kind 
of practice, and offered not a single critica! remark 
about phenomenology, which proves that the official 
attitude in late 1960s was rather liberal. Nevertheless, 
nota single monograph devoted specifically to pheno-
menology was published in the 1970s, although dis-
sertations were written on the subject and articles were 
pub1ished injournals and collective works. Phenomen-
ology was also described in textbooks, which showed 
again that the official ideology had acknowledged the 
necessity of assessing phenomenology from the Marx-
ist point ofview. 
The collection by Moscow professors called 
Sovremennaya burzhuaznaya filoso_fiya (Contempo-
rary bourgeois philosophy, 1972) was the first serious 
textbook for students of contemporary Western philos-
ophy in the USSR. The author ofthe article on pheno-
menology was Nelli Motroshilova. PIAMA GAIDENKO 
and ALEXI BOGOMOLOV acquainted the readers with ex-
istentialism and regarded phenomenology as a forerun-
ner of existentia1ism. The relationship of phenomen-
ology with existentialism and the problem ofthe sub-
ject was a1so pointed out by TAMARA KUZMINA. Husserl 's 
teaching is shown as superrationalism ( Uberrationa-
lismus) by MIHAIL KISSEL in Sudba staroi dilemmi (The 
Fate of old dilemmas, 1974). Kissel studied the influ-
ence of phenomenoJogy on FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY, 
and investigated the relationship between Husserl 's and 
HEGEL's philosophies. LEONID IONIN focused on pheno-
menological SOCIOLOGY in his Ponimayuschchaya sot-
siologiya (Sociology of understanding, 1979). This 
work gives an account of understanding in the social

sciences of WILHELM DILTHEY, Husserl, ALFRED SCHUTZ, 
Harold Garfinkel, Karl Popper, Kari-Otto Apel, Jurgen 
Habermas, and Peter Winch. 
The Riga Group ofPhenomenologists was founded 
in the early 1980s. Nelli Motroshilova was its initiator 
and unremitting supporter. In Celsh saprashanas labir-
intos (The path in the haze of understanding, 1989), 
MAIJA KOLE wrote about understanding and cognition, 
LANGUAGE, HISTORY, and COMMUNICATION in HERMENEU-
TICS. Furthermore, she clarified the differences and 
similarities between phenomenology and hermeneu-
tics, and the problem of the genesis of sense. MARA 
RUBENE has published articles on time in phenomen-
ology; ELLA BUCENIECE investigates teleology and the 
problem ofthe LIFEWORLD; RICHARD KULIS is developing 
a cultural phenomenology; ANDRIS RUBENIS busies him-
self with phenomenological axiology and ETHICS and 
has published Fenomenologija (1983); JURIS ROZEN-
VALDS works on the Munchen-Gottingen school and 
the Latvian philosopher Theodor Celms (1893-1988), 
who is a critic of Husserl's philosophy; and LAR-
ISA CHUHINA has written articles about MAX SCHELER's 
phenomenology, axiology, and PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHRO-
POLOGY and published Chelovek i ievo tsennostni mir v 
religioznoifilosofii (The human and the world ofvalue 
in religious philosophy, 1980). The Group has clase 
ties with Lithuanian philosophers: THOMAS SODEIKA has 
published works about Ingarden's philosophy; ARUNAS 
SVERDIOLAS has discussed PAUL RIC<EUR's views; and 
ARVIDAS SCHLIOGERIS has investigated existentialism 
and Kierkegaard 's philosophy. He also recognizes that 
the immanent and transcendent have a special unity 
that is characteristic for existentialism and phenomen-
ology. In Estonia ULO MATYusshas analyzed lngarden's, 
Husserl 's, and Heidegger's philosophies. 
The first collective work ofLatvian, Lithuanian, and 
Russian philosophers, Kritika fenomenologicheskovo 
napravleniya v sovremennoi burzhuaznoifilosofii (Cri-
tique of the phenomenological trend in contemporary 
bourgeois philosophy, 1981 ), deals with the specificity 
of the phenomenological method, Husserl's teaching 
about TIME, and the relationships of phenomenology 
with the thought of Heidegger, NICOLAI HARTMANN, and 
lngarden. 
The second book put out by the Riga Group of 
phenomenologists, Problemi ontologii v sovremennoi 
burzhuaznoifilosofii (Problems of ontology in con tem-
porary bourgeois philosophy, 1988), shows the con-
temporary understanding of ontology in phenomen-
ology, existentialism, and philosophy oflanguage. The 
book provides translations of extracts from the second 
volume of Husserl's Logische Untersuchungen, MAX 
SCHELER's Vom Umsturz der Werte, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE's 
Situations, and HEDWIG CONRAD-MARTIUS's "Die trans-
zendentale und die ontologische Phănomenologie" 
(1959). Previously, only SEMION FRANK's 1909 trans-
lation ofthe first volume ofHusserl's Logische Unter-
suchungen was available in Russian. 
The third most significant book from the Riga Group 
is Fenomenologiya v sovremennom mire (Phenomen-
ology in the contemporary world, 1991 ), which de-
scribes the significance of Husserl 's Logische Unter-
suchungen for our time, the methodological aspects of 
phenomenology, phenomenological ETHICS, and the un-
derstanding ofthe human being, history, and creativity 
in phenomenology. Since 1990 Riga has been the seat 
of faur international phenomenological conferences in 
collaboration with the World Institute for Advanced 
Phenomenological Research and Learning. The Baltic 
Society for Phenomenology was founded in 1990, with 
Maija Kiile as head ofthe society. 
Studies of phenomenology in the USSR were re-
tarded by the fact that Husserl 's works and foreign 
literature were not available. That is why the Insti-
tute ofScientific Information of Social Sciences ofthe 
USSR Academy of Sciences published A filosofiya E. 
Gusserlya i ee kritika (The philosophy of Husserl and 
its critique, 1983 ), in which all of Husserl 's princi-
pal works were summarized, but this selection could 
not have great inftuence because it was classified for 
"special use" (every exemplar was registered) and its 
distribution was restricted. 
A number of monographs on phenomenology were 
published in the USSR during the 1980s. VLADIMIR 
BABUSHKIN wrote Fenomenologicheskoye poznanie 
nauki: Kriticheskii ana/iz (Phenomenological philoso-
phy ofscience: critica! analysis, 1985), in which he ex-
amined the theory of consciousness, phenomenological 
methods, and the possibility of the use of phenomen-
ology in the NATURAL and HUMAN SCIENCES. 
In Fenomenologicheskoe poznanie: Propedevtika 
i kritika (Phenomenological epistemology: Propedeu-
tic and critique, 1987), KAREN SVASYAN dealt with the 
problem of the unity of discursive and intuitive cog-

716 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
nition. He presented the main concepts of phenomen-
ology: horizon, UFEWORLD, EIDETIC METHOD, immanent 
time, INTENTIONAUTY, INTERSUBJECTIVITY, constitution, 
NOEMA, EVIDENCE, regional ontologies, EPOCHE AND RE-
DUCTION, reflection, transcendentality, phenomena, ei-
dos, etc. He also wrote books about Goethe, HENRI 
BERGSON, and ERNST CASSIRER. Ana!yzing Cassirer's 
philosophy, he drew attention to the phenomenology 
of symbolic forms in the shape of speculations about 
language, mythic thinking, and phenomenology of cog-
nition. The first public de bate about phenomenology in 
the USSR was organized in 1988 by Motroshilova, and 
the leading philosophical journal, A Voprosi Filosofii 
(Questions of philosophy), published the roundtable 
discussion about the importance ofphenomenology in 
contemporary life. 
VIKTOR MOLCHANOV has long been engaged in pheno-
menology. In Vremya i soznanie: Kritika fenomeno-
logicheskoifilosofii (Time and consciousness: critique 
ofphenomenological philosophy, 1988) he showed the 
similarity of KANT's and Husserl's philosophical ap-
proaches in dealing with the relationships of time, 
consciousness, and reflection, and he criticized Hei-
degger's interpretation of Kant's Kritik der reinen 
Vernunfl, which forces the problems of fundamen-
tal ontology on Kant's philosophy. He also published 
works about the transcendental subject, the a priori, the 
similarities and differences of Husserl 's and Hegel's 
philosophies, and other problems. He authored the en-
try on phenomenology for Sovremennaya zapadnaya 
filoso,fiya si ovar (Dictionary of contemporary Western 
philosophy, 1991 ), in which he affirmed the ideas of in-
tentionality and time tobe the core ofphenomenology. 
In further working out the phenomenological theory 
of consciousness, he defined consciousness as the ex-
perience of distinction, ascribing a priori distinctions 
to the initial experience of consciousness. Molchanov 
has played a major role in the translation ofHusserl's 
works into Russian and has collaborated with the Riga 
Group since the 1980s. 
The unfinished task of making "philosophy con-
crete," which was initiated by The International Mag-
azine of the Philosophy of Cu/ture, is being resumed 
by the revival of the journal Logos, edited by Valeri 
Anashvili. Logos was first published in Russia in 1910-
14 and 1925, and its resumption in Moscow in 1991 
aims at the restoration ofthe lost traditions ofRussian 
academic philosophy. The first step in this endeavor is 
to clarify, through creative study, the principles ofthe 
phenomenological tradition. Logos combines the trans-
lation of extracts from the classics of phenomenology 
(Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, and others) with the 
early 20th century Russian phenomenological studies 
and original articles about contemporary philosophy. 
The publication of Husserl 's collected works in Rus-
si an began in the early 1990s. 
Interest in Western philosophy increased after the 
collapse of the USSR. There are hundreds of pub-
lications mainly pertaining to phenomenology. Work 
is done in Georgia, Armenia, Moldavia, Ukraine, Be-
lorussia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Rus-
sia (in St. Petersburg, Vladimir, Saratov, Rostov-on-
the-Don, Kaliningrad, etc., besides Moscow). The in-
terest is in Western thinking that would help understand 
the new cultural-historical realities and replace Marx-
ism. 
Despite the strict control of philosophy while the 
USSR lasted, there were outstanding personalities who 
developed their own variants ofphilosophy in relation 
to phenomenology. A most significant underground fig-
ure in the Soviet philosophy of the 1970s and 1980s 
was the Georgian MERAB MAMARDASHVILI. He was def-
initeiy a thinker of the Socratic type who could make 
one see how an idea was born in an oral discourse. He 
considered philosophy to be consciousness aloud. His 
lectures on ancient philosophy, Descartes, Kant, etc., 
were unofficially circulated on audio tapes throughout 
the USSR. In Formi i soderzhanie mischlenie: K kritike 
Gegelevskovo ucheniya o formach poznaniya (Forms 
and limits ofthinking: Hegelian theory ofthe forms of 
knowledge, 1969), he analyzed Hegel 's teaching about 
the forms of cognition. He also developed a theory of 
"converted forms," based on the works of Marx. Ac-
cording to Mamardashvili, converted forms could be 
applied beyond the sphere of politica! economy to so-
cial life, the subconscious, culture and ideology, etc. 
Appearances of quasi-objects exist objectively, dis-
cretely, and independently. The converted form not 
only separates itself from the content of those rela-
tionships the form itself represents, but also becomes 
a prerequisite for the above-mentioned relationships. 
Appearance itself dictates certain rules. According to 
Mamardashvili, the process ofphenomenological sub-
stitution takes place. He considered phenomenological 

UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS 
717 
problems in his philosophy independently ofHusserl's 
phenomenology. It was Marx who led him to turn to the 
theme of"soov" in a broad sense. After studying Marx, 
Mamardashvili carne to a philosophical intuition about 
the body, by which he means objectively-operating 
structures or objectivities ofthought as the outer men-
tal reality of soul. In the 1970s he delivered an original 
course of lectures on social philosophy entitled "Opit 
fizicheskoi metafiziki" (Experience of physical meta-
physics) describing the way ideology functions. Con-
sciousness is not transparent; it cannot be described 
by means of simple reflection, because there are ob-
scure dependencies within consciousness. Conscious-
ness cannot exert direct control over them. To have 
access to the above mentioned dependencies pheno-
menological purification ( or reduction) is required. 
The problem discussed by Mamardashvili was sim-
ilar to the way the representatives of hermeneutics 
reproached classical phenomenology for the idea of 
pure consciousness and called for considering his-
tory and situationally conditioned consciousness. Ma-
mardashvili 's philosophy, which advanced the idea of 
phenomenological purification of consciousness, had 
a wider reception in the USSR than Western philoso-
phy. In a mediated form it stressed the possibility of 
spiritual opposition. That was one ofthe reasons for its 
popularity. 
Mamardashvili understood phenomenology as a 
method and technique for investigating consciousness. 
In Klassicheskii i neklassicheskii ideali ratsialnosti 
( Classical and nonclassical ideals of rationality, 1984 ), 
he used the difference between phenomenon and ap-
pearance to describe the difference between classical 
and nonclassical theories of REASON. Classical ratio-
nality cannot conceptualize the subjective adequately; 
the latter must be examined anew. The basis for com-
prehending the subjective is determining its founding 
possibilities. Founding results from the fact that the 
subjective can be discerned through aktivnost pred-
metnoi deyatelnosti (activity as objective); senses are 
formed from operating with things and not just oper-
ating with words that symbolize things. To understand 
the subjective it is necessary to determine the practi-
cally operating parameters of its existence. 
Mamardashvili dealt with consciousness, symbols, 
and understanding in Simbol i Soznanie (Symbol and 
consciousness, coauthored with ALEXANDR PYATIGORSKI, 
1982). He worked on the ontology of cui ture and wrote 
about the "anthropological catastrophe." He paid great 
attention to freedom. He focused on individuality and 
the inimitability of the occurrence of being, situation, 
and the uniqueness ofthe experience of consciousness. 
This made him turn to literature as a special manifes-
tation of the spirit. Mamardashvili analyzed works by 
Proust, Kafka, and other authors. 
In the Soviet era, ALEXEI LOSEV was a patriarch of 
Russian philosophy. He published about four hundred 
works, including thirty-five monographs dealing with 
the ancient cosmos and contemporary science, MUSIC 
as an object of logic, philosophy of the name, the 
dialectics of myth, the symbol, the structure of lan-
guage, and Hellenic, Roman, and Renaissance aesthet-
ics. The inftuence of phenomenology is most appar-
ent in Filosofiya imeni (Philosophy of names, 1927), 
where he developed the "dialectica! phenomenology 
of thought." This original understanding of pheno-
menology has no counterpart in Western philosophy. 
It combines phenomenology and dialectics, lays the 
foundation for the ontology of language, and devel-
ops the theory of eidos and observation. Keeping up 
the tradition ofRussian philosophy, Losev spoke about 
the sophistic (Sofiinoe) construing of eide achieved by 
art on the basis of the purely eidetic and essentially 
expressive energetic construction of ei de. 
Losev accepted phenomenology and especially the 
teaching about ei dos and pure description as a success-
ful opposition to metaphysics and naturalism. How-
ever, he considered the view that explanation is natu-
ralistic unacceptable. That is why he chooses dialec-
tics, which he called "explanation of senses (mean-
ings)." According to him, phenomenology remains in 
the sphere ofthe description ofseparately given senses, 
while dialectics can uncover the relationships and 
geneses of senses. Dialectics not only grasps things, it 
is within the evolution ofthe things and their meanings. 
Analyzing the word in its pre-objective and objective 
structure, Losev carne to the conclusion that pheno-
menology is the pre-theoretical description of ali kinds 
and levels of senses, a description that is based on ad-
equate perception, i.e., on the perception of eide. This 
is why phenomenology is not science, for science re-
quires explanation. Phenomenology, according to Lo-
sev, is a picture of the sense of the object; it refuses 
to place this object in a system on the basis of prin-

718 
ENCYCLOPED!A OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
cip1es outside the object. Therefore phenomenology is 
also of no value as a method. Mythology, dialectics, 
arithmology (about an eidetic scheme or an ideal num-
ber), and topology (about ideal space) are the main 
sciences that are necessary for the general phenomen-
ology of thought and word and are based on the logos 
of eidetic being. Losev's "dialectica! phenomenology 
ofthought" has unfortunately not found further devel-
opment. 
A specialist in literature, MIKHAIL BAHKTIN has 
worked out a broad conception ofhumanitarian think-
ing. The search includes culturology, philology, PHILO-
SOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY, ]iterary criticism, texto]ogy, 
and philosophy. He strove to work out the "poetics of 
eul ture" and could be called a philosopher of eul ture de-
veloping his own dialogical phenomenologyofperson-
ality. He was the first to begin working out HERMENEU-
ncs in the 1920s and 1930s, yet it remained unnoticed 
in Europe because totalitarian rule precluded exchang-
ing information with Western phi1osophers. Originally 
he was inftuenced by neo-Kantianism, Herman Cohen 
( 1842-1918) in particular. In the early 1920s, Bahktin 
and MOISE! KAGAN organised a Kant seminar in which, 
among other things, Husserl 's phenomenology and Bu-
ber's dialogical theory ofl and Thou were discussed. 
In Problemi tvorchestva Dostoyevskovo (Problems of 
creativity in Dostoyevsky, 1929, reprinted in 1963 as 
Problemi poetiki Dostoyevskovo [Problems of poet-
ies in Dostoievski]) and in Voprosi literaturi i estetiki 
(Questions of literature and aesthetics, 1975), he de-
velops the idea of dialogue, showing it within the 
microcosm of the text or work of art. Bahktin also 
viewed phenomenology of personality as the meet-
ing and dialogue of two consciousnesses. In Estetika 
slovesnovo tvorchestva (Aesthetics of verbal creativ-
ity, 1979), Bahktin writes that no human occurrence 
ever takes place or is settled within one consciousness 
alone. One consciousness is a contradictia in adjecto. 
Consciousness is in its essence pluralia tantum. Thus 
neither the subconscious nor the superconscious, nei-
ther mystery nor the mysticism of the fusion of con-
sciousnesses, but consciousnesses reduced, driven to 
the very utmost (like the idea of dialogue) in their 
coexistence in the human being, is the true phenomen-
ology of personality. Similarly, Bahktin speaks about 
the dialogue of different cultures, in which historical 
ages come together. Sense is never completely gone; 
it can always be reawakened when cultures meet. He 
regards cultures as phenomena that are open and ex-
ist only on the frontier line, i.e., in the context of an 
intercultural dialogue. In this encounter Bahktin advo-
cates a phenomenology of humanitarian thinking that 
manifests itself as dialectica! reason. Sin ce the time his 
earlier works were reprinted in the 1970s, he has had 
a great inftuence on the thinking intelligentsia of the 
USSR. 
Ali things considered, phenomenology in what was 
the USSR is well begun in a wide, deep, and rich resur-
gence.

American 
phenomenology was anticipated by the early WILLIAM 
JAMES, but began when William Ernest Hocking ( 1873-
1966) became friends with EDMUND HUSSERL in 1902 
and !ater sent the Harvard students DORION CAIRNS and 
MARVIN FARBER to freiburg during the J920s. The expe-
rience ofstudying with Husserl is indicated in Cairns's 
Conversations with Husserl and Fink [ 1926--1931]. 
Husserl's student WINTHROP BELL taught phenomen-
ological VALUE THEORY at Harvard early in the 1920s, 
but went on to a career in CANADA. MORITZ GEIGER spent 
1907 chiefty at Harvard and was a visiting professor 
at Stanford University in 1926 and 1935. The attempt 
to publish a translation of the Logische Untersuchun-
gen (1900-1901) before World War I was frustrated 
by James. Albert R. Chandler's "Professor Husserl's 
Program of Philosophical Reform" (1917) is the first 
publication, but seems to have had no inftuence. Thus 
Farber's published dissertation, Phenomenology as a 
Method and a Philosophical Discipline (1928) is the 
first effective work. Husserl was offered a position at 
the University of Southern California when he was 
seventy-four years old, but declined when he could not 
have Cairns and EUGEN FINK as his assistants. 
There were some articles pertaining to phenomen-
ology during the 1930s, including a set of 1939 in 
The Journal of Philosophy in Husserl 's memory. Then

and also MORITZ GEIGER and KURT GOLDSTEIN,joined with 
the Americans HARMON CHAPMAN, and JOHN WILD, under 
Caims and Farber's dynamic leadership to found the In-
ternational Phenomenological Society, which counted 
23 1 members in 1942, and its journal, Philosophy and 
Phenomenological Research, which hoped to continue 
Husserl 's Jahrbuch and included ANTONIO BAFI, GASTON 
BERGER, EUGEN FINK, JEAN HERING, GERHART HUSSERL, and 
LUDWIG LANDGREBE on its original board. Farber edited 
the best manifestation ofthis first cohort, Philosophical 
Essays in Memory of Edmund Husserl ( 1940) and also 
authored The Foundation of Phenomenology (1943), 
an analysis chiefly ofHusserl 's Logische Untersuchun-
gen. In addition, Farber held a copy ofHusserl's Nach-
lass at Buffalo for some years during and after the war. 
In the first postwar decades, Philosophy and Pheno-
menological Research flourished, but the international 
society ceased meeting. Other pre- and postwar Aus-
trian and English imports, i.e., LOGICAL POSITIVISM 
and ORDINARY LANGUAGE PHILOSOPHY, and then Anglo-
American ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY carne to replace the 
earlier pragmatism in dominating American philos-
ophy. Caims !ater said that the phenomenologists in 
the United States around 1950 could be seated in his 
parlor. But then, with the postwar prosperity and a 
new flowering of phenomenology on the Continent, a 
new cohort, including EDWARD G. BALLARD, JOHN COMP-
TON, HUBERT DREYFUS, JAMES M. EDIE, DON IHDE, EUGENE 
KAELIN, WILLIAM RICHARDSON, CALVIN O. SCHRAG, and 
ROBERT SOKOLOWSKI became committed to it. 
By the 1970s there would be many Ph.D. pro-
grams in which phenomenology cou1d be studied in 
the United States, but at first there was only one. Do-
rion Caims joined Schutz at the New School for So-
cial Research in 19 54 and Gurwitsch succeeded Schutz 
there in 1959. During the 1950s THOMAS LUCKMANN 
and HELMUT WAGNER received doctorates in SOCIOLOGY 
and WERNER MARX and MAUR! CE NATANSON received sec-
ond doctorates in philosophy there. A Husserl archive 
in memory of Schutz was established at the New 
School in 1969. After Caims and Gurwitsch died, HAN-
NAH ARENDT and then J.N. MOHANTY, OSBORNE WIGGINS, 
and REINER scHORMANN continued the tradition into the 
1980s. 
The first ofthe four successively emerging tenden-
cies now discemible in the worldwide phenomenologi-
cal movement is REALISTIC PHENOMENOLOGY, which 
was long represented in America solely by Herbert 
Spiegelberg, whose The Phenomenological Movement 
(1960) was dedicated to Schutz's memory. The sec-
ond tendency- which initially found broader support 
-
is CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY. Stemming from 
Husserl 's 1deen zu ei ner reinen Phiinomenologie und 
phiinomenologischen Philosophie 1 (1 91 3), it re !ies on 
reflective observation and analysis, EIDETIC METHOD, 
and transcendental EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION in the at-
tempt to ground ETHICS, HUMAN SCIENCE and NATURAL 
SCIENCE, LOGIC, MATHEMATICS, and VALUE THEORY. Gur-
witsch's The Field of Consciousness (1964), which 
integrated results of GEST ALT PSYCHOLOGY into pheno-
meno1ogy, is especially original, as is the coNSTITUTIVE 
PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE NATURAL ATTITUDE emphasized 
by Schutz in his Collected Papers ( 1962, 1964, 1966, 
and 1996) for the philosophy of the social or, more 
broadly, cultural sciences. 
The teaching of Husserl in America suffered long 
from the difficulties of the 1931 Boyce Gibson trans-
1ation of 1deen 1 (Logische Untersuchungen was fi-
nally trans1ated in 1970) and, in addition to that, the 
weakness of American foreign language instruction. 
Husserl then tended to be understood through the crit-
ica! remarks in Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, and 
their postwar European followers. Cairns's translations 
of Husserl 's Cartesianische Meditationen [ 1931] and 
Formale und transzendentale Logik (1929) in 1960 
and 1969 were then significant, as was FRED KERSTEN's 
of 1deen 1 in 1983. Furthermore, reliable interpre-
tive works, those of JOSEPH J. KOCKELMANS in particu-
lar, he1ped enormously. Northwestern University Press 
pub1ished a veritable library oftranslated sources, and 
facility in German and/or French became increasingly 
de rigeur. 
Constitutive phenomenology has continued, much 
stimulated by Americans who have studied at various 
European Husserl Archives and by the steady flow of 
Husserliana volumes; ANTHONY J. STEINBOCK's Home 
and Beyond: Generative Phenomenologyafter Husserl 
(1995) is a fine recent manifestation, but there have 
been contributions since the 1960s, especially by J. N. 
MOHANTY and ROBERT SOKOLOWSKI. Besides the Husserl 
Circle, founded in 1968, the Society for the Study of 
Husserl 's Phenomenology was established in 1990. 
But a different European tendency, EXISTENTIAL 
PHENOMENOLOGY, began being imported in the 1950s, 

720 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
and carne to dominate during the great expansion of 
American phenomenology during the 1960s. In the 
background, govemmental support for higher educa-
tion increased after the 1957 Soviet launch ofthe Sput-
nik satellite and the postwar demographic surge be-
gan to reach college age. Students were studying EXIS-
TENTIALISM in THEATER and LITERATURE using JEAN-PAUL 
SARTRE's Huis clos (English trans. 1948) and ALBERT 
CAMus's Le mythe de Sisyphe (English trans. 1955) and 
learning ofMARTIN HEIDEGGER as well as Husserl as their 
sources. The young professors versed in the philoso-
phy ofpostwar FRANCE, GERMANY, and THE NETHERLANOS 
ANO FLANDERS found positions. 
Existential phenomenology tends to view Husserl 
as a subjective idealist to be transcended and its claim 
that Husserl took an existential turn in late works 
such as Die Krisis der europtiischen Wissenschaften 
und die transzendentale Phănomenologie (1936) has 
had an extensive influence. The positive inspiration 
for existential phenomenology in America carne im-
mediately from MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY as we!l as 
Sartre and also GABRIEL MARCEL and, much !ater, SI-
MONE DE BEAUVOIR, but more deepJy from the FUNDA-
MENTAL ONTOLOGY as we!l as the anaJytics ofOASEIN in 
Heidegger's Sein und Zeit ( 1927). KARL JASPERS, Soren 
Kierkegaard, and Friedrich Nietzsche were in the back-
ground. Sartre's L'etre et le neant (1943) was trans-
lated in 1956 and Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenologie 
de la perception (1945) was translated in 1962. HAN-
NAH ARENDT was widely read but was not yet generally 
recognized to be an existential phenomenologist. 
This third phenomenological tendency emphasizes 
such previously at best peripheral issues on the pheno-
menological agenda as embodiment, freedom, and so-
cial conflict in such areas as AESTHETICS, HISTORY, and 
rouncs. The meaning of human existence became the 
central philosophical problem, while Husserl was un-
derstood to have bracketed existence by the transcen-
dental epoche. The emphasis also shifted from an intel-
lectualist preoccupation to a focus on concrete, embod-
ied, and situated ACTION. The ambiguity, contingency, 
and facticity of historical consciousness replaced the 
preoccupation with universal essences. 
Where Ph.D. programs are concemed, existential 
phenomenology was brought first to the departments of 
philosophy and also psychology at Duquesne Univer-
sity by HENRY KOREN in the 1950s. WILLIAM A. LUIJPEN's 
Existential Phenomenology ( 1960) seems the charac-
teristic expression for that. Constitutive as well as ex-
istential phenomenology were taught in the 1960s by 
MANFREO FRINGS and ALPHONSO LINGIS and in the 1970s 
and 80s by LESTER EMBREE, JOHN SALLIS, JOHN SCAN-
LON, and ANDRE SCHUWER in philosophy and AMEDEO 
GIORGI, WILLIAM FISHER, and PAUL RICHER in psychoJogy. 
Moreover, book series in philosophy and psycho1ogy 
and The Journal of Phenomenological Psychology and 
Research in Phenomenology were begun at Duquesne 
University Press. The Simon Silverman Phenomen-
ology Center was founded in 1980; it holds the pa-
pers ofGurwitsch and ERWIN STRAUS, a third American 
Husserl Archive, and a splendid collection of pheno-
menologicalliterature. 
The existential phenomenology predominating in 
the 1960s was furthermore fostered by John Wild, a 
member ofthe first American group who, after postwar 
visits to France, published The Challenge of Existen-
tialism (1955). The theologian PAUL TILLICH, Wild's col-
league at Harvard, did much to set the existentialist tone 
of this time. Wild left Harvard for Northwestern Uni-
versity in 1961 and then went on to Yale in 1963. Some 
spoke in this era of a "Northwestern-Yale axis." CAL VIN 
O. SCHRAG, GEORGE SCHRADER, and Wild helped JAMES 
M. EDIE to found the Society for Phenomenology and 
Existential Philosophy in 1962, which has always been 
the largest organization for phenomenology, and then 
to found the Studies in Phenomenology and Existen-
tial Philosophy, also long lead by Edie, at Northwestem 
University Press. These and other institutions were al-
ternatives to those ofthe Anglo-American mainstream, 
which were rather unreceptive. 
Besides the book series at Northwestern, the two 
Duquesne series, and also the venerable Phaenomen-
ologica series sponsored since 1958 by the Louvain 
Husserl Archives at Martinus Nijhoff and more re-
cently at Kluwer Academic Publishers, which has al-
ways been open to work in English, further series were 
established in the 1970s and 1980s at Ohio University 
Press, the State University ofNew York Press, Indiana 
University Press, and Humanities Press. A second se-
ries, entitled "Contributions to Phenomenology," was 
established at Kluwer in 1989 and is now led by JOHN 
DRUMMOND. "Perspectives in Continental Philosophy" 
was begun by JOHN CAPUTO at Fordham University Press 
in 1996.

As for joumals, besides the two founded at 
Duquesne, there are The Review of Existential Psy-
chiatry, Philosophy Today, Man and World, Husserl 
Studies, Heidegger Studies, andPhenomenology lnfor-
mation Bulletin cum Phenomenologicallnquiry. Then 
aga in, beyond philosophy, there are Human Studies, the 
Phenomenology and Social Science Newsletter, and 
Phenomenological Psychology as well as increasing 
acceptance in traditionaljournals. The quantity of new 
publishing outlets is indicative of mainstream resis-
tance to as well as the expanding energy of American 
phenomenology. 
During the 1960s, further doctoral programs 
emerged at Northwestern, where phenomenology 
COU]d be studied with WILLIAM EARLE and SAMUEL TODES 
as well as Edie after Wild left, and at Yale Uni-
versity with DAVID CARR, EDWARD S. CASEY, WILLIAM 
MCBRIDE, GEORGE SCHRADER, and ]ater MAURICE NATAN-
SON; then Kockelmans and ALPHONSO LINGIS were joined 
by TIIOMAS M. SEEBOHM at The Pennsylvania State Uni-
versity and DePaul University had MANFRED FRINGS and 
]ater MARY JEANNE LARRABEE. McBride joined Schrag at 
Purdue University in 1973 and DOROTHY LELAND, MAR-
TIN MATUSTIK, and LEWIS GORDON carne ]ater; Vanderbi]t 
University has had JOHN COMPTON, JOHN SALLIS, CHARLES 
SCOTT, DAVID WOOD, and RICHARD M. ZANER, Boston Col-
lege has had RICHARD COBB-STEVENS and JOHN MURPHY 
and also, as regular visitors, HANS-GEORG GADAMER and 
JACQUES TAMINIAUX, and Boston University has had ER-
AZIM KOHĂK and VICTOR KESTENBAUM. In the 1970s DON 
IHDE led the formation ofthe exceptionally strong and 
enduring programat the State University of New York 
at Stony Brook that carne to include EDWARD s. CASEY, 
ROBERT CREASE, PATRICK HEELAN, MARY RAWLINSON, HUGH 
J. SILVERMAN, and DONN WELTON. Then again there has 
been Tulane University with EDWARD G. BALLARD and 
now MICHAEL ZIMMERMAN; Catho]ic University with 
ROBERT SOKOLOWSKI and THOMAS PRUFER; Georgetown 
University with JOHN BROUGH; the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley with HUBERT DREYFUS; and the Uni-
versity of Southern California with DALLAS WILLARD. 
More recently there are Emory University with DAVID 
CARR, THOMAS FLYNN, and RUDOLF MAKKREEL, Bingham-
ton University with JEFFNER ALLEN, MARTIN DILLON, and 
STEPHEN DAVID ROSS; The University of Memphis with 
ROBERT BERNASCONI, TINA CHANTER, LEONARD LAWLOR, 
and THOMAS NENON; and Vil!anova University with JOHN 
CAPUTO, THOMAS BUSCH, and DENNIS SCHMIDT. 
American phenomenology has spread beyond phi-
1osophy into the HUMAN SCIENCEs. Phenomenological 
PSYCHOLOGY could be studied at Duquesne and also 
at the University of Chicago with EUGENE T. GENDLIN, 
at the University of Dallas with ROBERT ROMANYSHYN 
and SCOTT CHURCHILL, and at Seattle University with 
KEITH HOELLER and STEEN HOLLING; COMMUNICOLOGY 
could be studied at Southern Illinois University with 
RICHARD LANIGAN and LENORE LANGSDORF; and, recentJy, 
a hermeneutica! phenomenological ECONOMICS could 
be studied at George Mason University with DON 
LAVOIE. Phenomenological PSYCHIATRY was introduced 
with the volume Existence edited by Rollo May et al. 
in 1958 and a Society for Phenomenology and Psychi-
atry was founded in 1978. The Society for Phenomen-
ology and Existential Philosophy originally included 
phenomenologists in psychiatry, psychology, sociol-
ogy, etc., but eventually an independent sister society, 
the "Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sci-
ences," was established and meets concurrently with it. 
The constitutive and existential tendencies have 
continued within the ever larger and better established 
American movement. Examples include work in the 
phenomenoJogy of the BODY by DREW LEDER and IRIS 
MARION YOUNG, whiJe ELIZABETH A. BEHNKE pursuses 
phenomenology ofthe body within the frameworks of 
constitutive, genetic, and generative phenomenology. 
Neverthe]ess, HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY is the 
third phenomenological tendency to predominate in 
the United States. It curiously objected to constitutive 
phenomenology for a doctrine of bare sensations that 
than required recognition of much that was due to in-
terpretation. Despite its greater emphasis on language 
and with the possible exception of gender, heremeneu-
tical phenomenology explores al! ofthe issues already 
placed on the agenda by constitutive, realistic, and ex-
istential phenomenology. 
Hermenutical phenomenology began its ascent late 
in the 1960s. Heidegger was again the chief source, 
but more for his methodology than for his analytics 
of Dasein. The emphasis on language within this ten-
dency responded to the concerns also indicated by ORDI-
NARY LANGUAGE ANALYSIS in the American mainstream. 
The contributions OfHANS-GEORG GADAMER and the ]ater 
thought of PAUL RICCEUR were added to the newer ap-
preciation of Heidegger. 

722 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
There were early artieles and WERNER BROCK's Ex-
istence and Being ( 1949), but the founding events for 
American Heidegger studies were the translation of 
Sein und Zeit in 1962 and WILLIAM RICHARDSON's Hei-
degger: Through Phenomenology to Thought (1963). 
J. GLENN GRAY led the translating of a series of works 
of Heidegger at Harper & Row publishers in the 1970s 
and new translations began appearing from State Uni-
versity of New York Press by JOAN STAMBAUGH in the 
1 990s. Kockelmans again helped with volumes of in-
terpretation. The high quality ofthis scholarship is per-
haps epitomized by THEODORE KISIEL's The Genesis of 
Martin Heidegger 's "Being and Time" (1993). Hei-
degger's thought carne to dominate scholarship within 
American phenomenology by 1980, with ambivalent 
relations with POSTMODERNISM developing more re-
cently. 
After Heidegger, the second leading European 
source for hermeneutica! phenomenology in the United 
States is HANS-GEORG GADAMER, whose Wahrheit und 
Methode (Truth and method, 1960) was translated in 
1975 and who was repeatedly visiting professor in the 
United States beginning in the late 1960s, where a half 
dozen more of his books ha ve also been subsequently 
translated. Gadamer scholarship begins with RICHARD 
PALMER's Hermeneutics (1969). DAVID HOY'S The Criti-
ca! Circle (1978) is one ofthe more outstanding recent 
contributions. 
The third European source for this tendency is PAUL 
RICCEUR, whose late emerging interest in hermeneu-
tics can be discemed in De l 'interpretation: Essai sur 
Freud ( 1968; English trans. 1970) and Le conflit des in-
terpretations: Essais d 'hermeneutique ( 1969; English 
trans. 1974). Severa! other works have been translated. 
Ricreur visited various North American universities 
and then became the John Nuveen Professor of the 
History of Philosophy at the University of Chicago in 
1970. DON IHDE's Hermeneutic Phenomenology: The 
Philosophy of Paul RicG!ur ( 1971) is the first study. 
Ricreur's impact has been especially multidisciplinary, 
his work being taken quite seriously by historians, lit-
erary theorists, politica! scientists, psychiatrists, psy-
chologists, and theologians. 
Hermeneutica! phenomenology is focused on 
HERMENEUTICS or the theory of interpretation, which it 
extends beyond texts to include Being as well as other 
matters, as one ofRicreur's subtitles, "Meaningful Ac-
tion Considered as a Text" ( 1971 ), indicates. Heideg-
ger is appreciated for his work in the phenomenology 
of LANGUAGE AFTER HUSSERL. Exemp]ary hermeneuti-
ca! phenomenology has been pursued by ALBERT HOFS-
TADTER in aesthetics; BERNARD BOELEN and JOHN CAPUTO 
in ethics; by CAL VIN O. SCHRAG and JOHN O'NEILL in phi-
Josophy ofthe human sciences; JOSEPH J. KOCKELMANS, 
PATRICK HEELAN, THEODORE J. KISIEL, and HANS SEIGFRIED 
in philosophy of natural science; by BERNARD DAUEN-
HAUER, FRED DALLMAYR, and REINER SCHURMANN in po-
litica] phi]osophy; by ALBERT BORGMANN and DON IHDE 
in philosophy oftechnology; and by JOHN MACQUARRIE 
in the phiJosophy ofRELIGION. 
By the 1990s, most American publishing houses, 
joumals, and main-stream professional organizations 
had become somewhat receptive to phenomenology, 
yet the small societies that began being established 
during the 1960s continued to meet annually and apart 
from, but complementary to, the Society for Pheno-
menology and Existential Philosophy: the Husserl Cir-
ele, the Heidegger Conference, the Merleau-Ponty Cir-
ele, the Sartre Cirele, the Simone de Beauvoir Cirele, 
and The Society for the Study of Husserl 's Philoso-
phy. Most recently a multidisciplinary "Back-to-the-
Things-Themselves" annual conference has even been 
founded. 
Two independent institutions ha ve been active: The 
Center for Advanced Research in Phenomenology, 
Inc., was begun in 1971 and established an archival 
repository; the Collegium Phaenomenologicum (now 
an independent entity); book series at Ohio University 
Press, University Press of America, and Kluwer Aca-
demic Publishers; a lecture tour; a summer program, 
the Aron Gurwitsch and Alfred Schutz memorial lec-
tureships; and the Edwin Goodwin Ballard book prize. 
The center has held at least one conference a year in the 
United States, plus international meetings in India and 
Japan. Its headquarters is at Florida Atlantic Univer-
sity and its directors are also the editors of the present 
encyclopedia. 
Beginning in 1976 The World Institute for Ad-
vanced Phenomenological Research and Leaming un-
der the vigorous leadership of ANNA-TERESA TYMIE-
NIECKA began organizing symposia and lecture series in 
the Boston area, sponsoring programs in conjunction 
with the American Philosophical Association, and also 
many phenomenology conferences abroad that have 

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
723 
been published as volumes in Analecta Husserliana at 
Reidel, and !ater Kluwer Academic Publishers, in the 
Netherlands. Especially relevant for the present entry 
is the volume American Phenomenology: Origins and 
Developments ( 1989). 
The Society for Phenomenology and Existential 
Philosophy has always also been a venue for various 
non-phenomenological postwar European tendencies, 
SUCh as CRITICAL THEORY, STRUCTURALISM, and POSTMOD-
ERNISM. The resultant diversity became so great that 
the title "Phenomenology and Existentialism" became 
inadequate, and Embree and Ihde independently be-
gan, late in the 1970s, to apply the more encompass-
ing qualifier "Continental." With its four interacting 
tendencies, phenomenology is plainly the oldest and 
centermost movement within Continental thought in 
the United States. And Continental thought is now the 
main challenger to the Anglo-American mainstream. 
The rise of what is sometimes called "California 
phenomenology" or "Analytical phenomenology" also 
needs to be mentioned. This comes from the Anglo-
American rather than the Continental tradition. It ini-
tially focused on Husserl 's work in philosophy oflogic 
and epistemology, but then began considering more 
and more of the phenomenological tradition. DAVID 
SMITH, RONALD MCINTYRE, and DAGFINN F0LLESDAL have 
been the leading contributors, but HUBERT DREYFUS and 
also John Searle at Berkeley and, more recently, BARRY 
SMITH at the University ofBuffalo, are also supportive. 
American phenomenology has sometimes been 
challenged in the early 1990s from the standpoint of 
POSTMODERNISM. Devotees of deconstruction in partic-
ular often deny or at least ignore the connection with 
the phenomenological tradition, which is not unlike 
the way some existentialists and hermeneuticists, also 
under the influence ofliterary theory, ignored their ori-
gins. However, JACQUES DERRIDA has recently claimed 
that he is part ofthe phenomenological movement, ali 
ofhis work being under the sign ofthe phenomenologi-
cal reduction. 
It is not characteristic of American cu !ture to el eva te 
one or a few figures over ali others. At the time of 
writing, however, there are dozens of accomplished 
phenomenologists in a senior generation born around 
World War II and many score more quite active in 
two younger generations. Indeed, given the hundreds 
ofpeople in myriad disciplines, the many institutions, 
and the numerous publications, it appears appropriate 
to speak of an American period succeeding the German 
and then French periods in the history of the century-
old international movement called phenomenology. 
Editing, translating, and other scholarship reiat-
ing to European phenomenology is continuing in the 
United States and comparison with non-European 
traditions, especially BUDDHISM, is being advanced 
through contact with phenomenologists in CHINA, IN-
DIA, JAPAN, and KOREA, but research basically continues 
in traditional philosophical areas, such as aesthetics, 
ethics, the philosophies of mathematics, human and 
natural science, literature, theater, logic, value theory, 
etc., and also in relation to new issues, such as ECOLOGY, 
ETHNICITY, FILM, FEMINISM, MEDICINE, and TECHNOLOGY. 
Much new insight into the matters themselves can be 
expected from American phenomenology.

VALUE THEORY 
Phenomenological theories 
of value ha ve been based very largely on the work of 
EDMUND HUSSERL and, through him, FRANZ BRENTANO, 
despite the fact that Husserl did not publish in these 
fields during his lifetime and despite very important 
divergences between his work and that of subsequent 
phenomenologists. The path they have tended toward, 
differentiating the subject matter of ethics from that of 
value theory, was predelineated by Husserl's departure 
from Brentano 's classification of mental phenomena. 
Brentano had conceived volition as a form ofEMOTION 
and subsumed both under a genus he called "feelings." 
Instead, Husserl orders mental phenomena under three 
mutually exclusive basic classes: the doxic (cognitive), 
the affective (emotional), and the conative (volitional). 
In the Prolegomena zur reinen Logik (1900)-the first 
volume ofhis Logische Untersuchungen (1900--1901) 
-
Husserl proposed a corresponding classification of 
theoretical, normative, and practica! disciplines. 
The general theory ofvolition would include a sub-
discipline establishing norms for correct and for veridi-
cal (evidently correct) volitions, and a practica! one 
establishing procedures for promoting correct striv-
ing (volition). The general theory of affects would 
include subdisciplines establishing norms for correct 
and veridical emotions and establishing procedures for 
promoting correct emotions. Since Husserl's consid-
ered opinion was that ali emotional mental processes 
are valuings at Jeast implicitly, the general theory of 
affects would coincide with the general theory of val-
uations and would include the theory of what can be 
correctly valued, disvalued, preferred, etc. (axiology). 
Subdisciplines ofthe general theory of cognition would 
differentiate correct or veridical cognitions from their 
opposites and establish norms for cognitions and pro-
cedures for promoting correct cognitions. What might 
be called ETHrcs would unite the severa! practica! sub-
disciplines. 
Although Husserl published no works on value the-
ory or ethics, he lectured repeatedly on these topics. 
Very extensive notes on the earlier lecture courses -
Vorlesungen iiber Ethik und Wertlehre (1908-1914) 
-
ha ve been published ( 1988) and another volume 
of lectures from the Nachlass has been announced for 
the near future. The earlier Jectures present a view 
of axiology and ethics that remains remarkably close 
to Brentano's strict ideal consequentialism. The vol-
ume's editor reports that the !ater lectures (1915-23) 
present a quite different approach largely under the in-
fluence ofJOHANN GOTTLIEB FICHTE, perhaps the most ex-
treme of deontological theorists. Subsequently, pheno-
menological axiologies (such as those of DIETRICH voN 
HILDEBRAND, MAX SCHELER, NlCOLAl HARTMANN, and HANS 
REINER) have tended to acknowledge that strivings do 
indeed have distinctively moral value characteristics 
that are independent oftheir factual consequences, but 
few would go so far as Fichte to declare it morally 
wrong, sinful, and blasphemous to weigh the utility of 
morally good strivings. 
Ways of using the crucial word value vary widely 
even within the phenomenological literature. Husserl 
used "value" for the goodness belonging solely to some 
particular bearer ofvalue, and in his use, what the word 
denotes could only be an individual object (never an 
eidetic object) when the bearer is itself an individual 
object. Although Max Scheler uses it with the same 
denotation, he conceives what it denotes to be both 
a quality and a specific material axiologica] universal 
(hen ce an ei dos accessible through EIDETIC METHOD ). 
Although Hartmann, on the other hand, agrees with 
Husserl about what the word connotes when it denotes 
a property, he often applies it to the axiologica] laws 
that objects must satisfy in order to have a given kind 
of axiologica! property. Thus it sometimes does and 
sometimes does not denote, in his use, something uni-
versal and eidetic. When such ambiguities threaten, 
the more awkward terms value-characteristic, axiotic 
trait, axiologica! predicate, or value-predicate can be 
employed. Phenomenological literature on value and 
valuing tends, following Husserl, to insist that original 
acquaintance with values and disvalues is acquired. 
Axiologica! predicates of objects -
their goodness, 
their badness, or their lack of either- can be given, 
but can only be given through affective, that is, emo-
tional mental processes. The severa! figures mentioned 
could agree with most ofwhat follows.

VALUE THEORY 
725 
Phenomenological value theories are both antina-
tivist and intuitionist. Affective consciousness as such 
is receptive to axiologica! predicates so that "impres-
sions" of valuecharacteristics such as goodness, bad-
ness, indifference, etc., are strictly affective. This is 
a major deviation from Brentano 's position that only 
experiences that are perceptual- and so cognitive or, 
in Husserl 's terms, doxic -
and not affective could 
be receptive and that only the interna! perception of 
itse(( that is implicit in every veridical emotion can 
give rise to the concept that the object of the emo-
tion is good or bad and so is worthy of love or of 
hate, respectively. Thus Brentano's view had held that 
the impressional consciousness of value is necessar-
ily a direct consciousness of something mental and 
only indirectly a consciousness of something about the 
emotion's object. 
Instead, Husserl maintains that an evidently correct 
positive emotion, for example, is implicitly an intuition 
that what it approves of ought tobe, much as an evident 
belief is evidence for the being of what is believed in 
(since perceiving is an intuition that the object is actual 
and clearly imagined perceiving is an intuition that its 
object is possible). The ontic states of affairs toward 
which affects or feelings are directed are always coin-
tended in some cognitive ( doxic) manner-perceived, 
remembered, imagined, anticipated,judged, etc. How-
ever, an approving of something can be EVIDENCE that 
what is approved ought tobe regardless ofwhether the 
founding doxic consciousness is evident with regard 
to the existence or possibility of the object as doxi-
cally intended. This suggests strongly that valuings as 
such are infallible and that disagreements injudgments 
about values and axiotic traits are reducible to disagree-
ments regarding the founding ontic characeristics for 
which the relevant objects are valued -
a thesis in 
which phenomenological axiology would concur with 
noncognitivist theories. Even if valuing as such is in-
fallible, incorrect valuings would still occur when the 
beliefs through which the valuing is founded are them-
selves incorrect. That their founding doxa be correct is 
a necessary condition for fully correct valuing, whether 
simple or preferential. 
As a valuing, an atTective process may be intentive 
to its object either positively (loving, approving, liking, 
etc.) as something that ought tobe, negatively (hating, 
disapproving, disliking, etc.) as something that ought 
not to be, or in an affectively neutra! way (indiffer-
ence, which is a feeling) as something that is neither 
good nor bad. Thus affects or feelings and their noe-
matic correlates have "qualities" analogous to those of 
judging and other doxic phenomena. 
Besides simple affects such as loving, hating, ap-
proving, disapproving, liking, and disliking there are 
comparative affects that are intentive to something not 
just as being of value, disvalue, or indifferent but also 
as better than, worse than, or neither better than nor 
worse than something else. Preferential affects are ba-
sic to the conative phenomena that are a principle theme 
of ethics as the theory of correct striving, sin ce striving-
for or, in any event, any veridical striving-for would 
be founded on a preferring of the existence of what 
is striven for to its nonexistence, as striving-against 
would be founded on preferring the nonexistence of 
what is striven against to its existence. 
There is a foundedness of the intentiona! object of 
valuing as such that parallels -
in many respects, 
though not in all -
the foundedness of valuing on 
doxic or cognitive consciousness. Feelings, as intu-
itions of value-predicates, cannot occur except insofar 
as they entail doxa intentive to non-axiotic, ontic pred-
icates, and these are there for consciousness through 
non-affective, doxic mental processes intentive to the 
valued entity as having characteristics whose manner 
of original givenness is not affective and whose be-
ing or nonbeing might be truly affirmed or denied or 
might be questioned, doubted, etc. As it is emotionally 
intuited, any axiologica! characteristic of an object-
that this particular object ought to be, for example 
-
is founded upon and conditioned by certain ontic 
properties intended by doxa implicit in the emotional 
intuition. The utility and perhaps the aesthetic value of 
a certain stuff as a food might, for example, be founded 
on properties involving its chemical composition and 
involving in turn some organism's digestive organs, 
metabolic processes, and sensory organs. 
However, the distinction between axiotic and ontic 
characteristics is a distinction among the constituents 
of the bearer's objective meaning. Thus an object as 
valued is a synthetic unity intended to in at least two 
ways: doxically and affectively. Mental processes of 
both sorts are here intentive to the selfsame noematic 
object, but to entirely distinct features of the object. 
What each discloses about the object is different from 

726 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
what the other discloses, yet the object is synthetically 
identified, is a single polar unity to which both sets 
of features are intended as belonging. That what pos-
sesses the doxically intended characteristics possesses 
the affectively intended characteristics is not formally 
or analytically true. 
Each valuing is founded on a definite set of doxic 
mental processes, and each member of that set be-
longs to one or more particular doxic species. Other 
mental processes of the selfsame doxic species could 
occur without founding any mental process ofthe same 
affective species as the one that this set of doxic men-
tal processes has made possible. The occurrence of a 
doxic mental process of the relevant species is only a 
necessary, not a sufficient condition for the occurrence 
of feelings of the relevant type. The thesis of noetic-
noematic foundedness seems quite defensible so long 
as it is not misunderstood as if the logica! priority 
of the founding ( conditioning) doxic-ontic predicates 
entailed temporal priority as well. Husserl does not al-
ways pronounce the separati an emphatically and seems 
at least once to have proclaimed the mesalliance. 
Properly understood, however, the thesis does not 
in the least imply that any objects could occur that 
would ha ve doxically intuitable features of the same 
species as those that found the goodness of a correctly 
valued abject X and yet Iack a value-predicate of the 
type correlative to correct valuing of X. Having ontic 
properties of the kind that found the relevant value-
predicate is a sufficient condition for having the same 
type of value predicate even though doxic conscious-
ness of the object's having the relevant kind of ontic 
predicate is only a necessary condition for feelings of 
the appropriate kind. The theory of noetic-noematic 
foundedness is entirely compatible with that ofthe ob-
jectivity of value. 
The foundedness of valuing on doxic phenomena 
and the corresponding grounding of correctly valued 
axiologica! characters in the ontic characteristics in-
tended by the founding doxa entails an implicit abstrac-
tion. If an object X is correctly approved simply on the 
basis of a set of ontic predicates that X is correctly 
believed to have and through which X exemplifies a 
certain set of antic universals, then ali examples ofthe 
same set of ontic universals must have the selfsame 
type of goodness for which this particular thing is ap-
proved. If, nevertheless, anything be correctly loved 
simply for having a doxically intuitable trait of a cer-
tain sort, then everything having a trait ofthe same sort 
can be correctly loved and is good. 
The distinction between antic and axiologica! pred-
icates is misconceived ifthe antic properties are repre-
sented as objective while the axiologica! ones are repre-
sented as being in some sense subjective. It would be no 
less a misrepresentation if axiologica! characteristics 
were represented noncognitivistically as if they could 
not be truly predicated of the abject. The distinction 
may be the genuine one that is misrepresented in tra-
ditional fact-value distinctions, but it has otherwise no 
clear relation to them. Nevertheless, it is far from obvi-
ous to what category value-predicates such as good. il!, 
better, and worse belong. Metaethical issues ofthis sort 
are important themes for further thinking, and thinking 
about them seems most likely to occur among phe-
nomenologically oriented thinkers, if at ali. The very 
great dangers involved in misinterpreting them seem 
to have been involved in MARTJN HEIDEGGER's effort to 
discuss them without using the traditional vocabulary 
of ethics and value theory. 
Even Scheler's conception of material values may 
carry, as Heidegger points out, very questionable ele-
ments of the fact-value differentiation. Scheler argues 
against the dependence of value-characteristics upon 
ontic properties. As eidetic objects, values would be 
qualities that are entirely independent of and indif-
ferent to the antic characteristics of what is valued; 
its antic traits would be valueless, absolutely without 
value. His conception thus completely separates the 
antic properties ofx from what, in Heidegger's terms, 
would make x worthy of care, concern, etc. In "Brief 
iiber den Humanismus" ( 194 7), Heidegger condemns 
this way of thinking in terms of values as the grea test 
conceivable blasphemy against Being. In the same pas-
sage, he repeatedly asserts that to think against "val-
ues" in Scheler's sense is not to champion nihilism 
regarding values. Scheler's thesis was based on the 
fact that something may be pleasant or agreeable to us 
without our being able to say what makes it so. Hei-
degger would surely counter that failure successfully 
to explicate what makes X agreeable has no relevance 
to the question whether what makes X agreeable has 
or has not been understood. According to Hartmann's 
Ethik ( 1926), explicating which things are indeed val-
ued and for which antic traits they are correctly val-

VALUE THEORY 
727 
ued is a complex hermeneutica! undertaking. There 
seems little doubt that Heidegger considered affective 
being-in-the-world (Befindlichkeit) to be grounded in 
the being of what is understood through affects. If his 
position on this point is indeed closer to that of Husserl 
and Hartmann, then what he calls dread (Angst) shows 
that the potentialities that are threatened by death are 
worth caring about, since that whose nonbeing is tobe 
dreaded ought to be: the appropriate affective attitude 
toward the nonbeing ofwhat ought tobe is necessarily 
negative. 
As belief-phenomena underlie and are implicit in 
ali valuings, so valuings underlie and are implicit in ali 
strivings. And as there are norms for correct believing, 
so there are norms for correct feeling and for correct 
volition. As correctness of its implicit beliefs would be 
a necessary condition for correctness of a valuation, so 
correctness ofits implicit valuations would bea neces-
sary condition for correctness of a volition. Norms for 
correct volition are a theme for ethics. The position of 
JEAN-PAUL SARTRE regarding the relation between val-
ues and ethics illustrates quite well the differentiation 
between axiology and ethics. 
In L 'etre et le neant (1943) Sartre holds that actions 
ha ve meaning only by reference to a hierarchy of ideal 
values. Such a hierarchy entails laws regarding kinds of 
entities that are related as better and worse. Thus there 
would be eidetic laws to the effect that entities of one 
kind are better than entities of some other particular 
kind(s) so that entities ofthe one kind are, other things 
being equal, to be preferred to entities of those other 
specific kind(s). Yet Sartre insists in L'existentialisme 
est un humanisme ( 1946) that an aprioristic ethics is 
out ofthe question. The two theses are altogether com-
patible if axiology and ethics are entirely distinct dis-
ciplines, especially so ifthe theory of correct volitions 
must take into account necessarily a posteriori beliefs 
concern ing the likely results of actions. 
Not until Scheler's Der Formalismus in der Ethik 
und die materiale Wertethik (Formalism in ethics and 
nonformal ethics of value, 1913/1916) were strivings 
and the personal and character traits that condition 
strivings acknowledged in phenomenological writings 
to have primary or intrinsic moral value that is -
as KANT insisted -
altogether independent of their 
real utitility (real instrumental value). The utility of 
a striving is a function of the axiologica! characteris-
tics of whatever factual outcomes are conditioned by 
that striving. Every volition necessarily is intentive, 
however vaguely, to itself, through its founding affects 
and doxa, as having utility. Following Kant, Scheler 
calls the occurrences that the agent anticipates may be 
affected by the action its material or content. Whatever 
axiologica! characteristics the agent intends this con-
tent as bearing are the action's material value. Kant's 
formalistic ethics asserts that the moral value of any 
striving must be entirely independent of its material 
value. Against this formalism, Scheler insists that a 
striving's moral value cannot be entirely independent 
ofits material value, although the latter is certainly not 
a sufficient condition for the former. The end of every 
correct action must be some anticipated utility or ben-
efit that is the material value ofthe striving. Moreover, 
Scheler adds, no correct striving could have its own 
moral goodness (its own conformity to the morallaw) 
as its intended end (subjective end in Kant's sense). 
Thus Scheler rejects the most basic thesis ofKant's 
formalism. But the same thesis about value-predicates 
leads him to reject as well Kant's cosmopolitan concep-
tion ofmorality and ofthe teleology ofhuman history, 
the very conception that was assimilated -much more 
than any thesis from HEGEL 's conception ofmorality-
into the anthropology of Feuerbach and MARX. Since 
no morally right action can have its own moral good-
ness as an end, and since Scheler is convinced that the 
moral value-predicate of an action is the eidos moral 
goodness, he concludes that moral goodness cannot be 
the end of any correct striving at ali, that moral good-
ness can never bea material value. Striving to promote 
moral goodness in the world could in that case never be 
morally correct. The alternative conception of value-
predicates that is shared by Husserl and Hartmann (and 
seemingly Heidegger) allows for the preservation of 
Kant's view ofteleology and ofthe highest good. 
Moreover, Hartmann also rejects Scheler's inter-
pretation of the hierarchy of values and its relation to 
moral goodness. Scheler proposed to determine moral 
rightness just by the rightness of the action's under-
lying preference, which must give priority, if it is to 
be correct, to the highest of the values accessible to 
the agent that can be realized in the given situation. 
Hartmann maintains that values in the hierarchy have 
what he calls "strength" as well as "height," and their 
strength is inversely related to their height. There is 

728 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
indeed higher moral goodness in striving to.fu!fill the 
requirements of superior material values. To violate 
lower order values is, however, a more grievous of 
fense than to violate the higher ones. Right preference 
must involve the greater weight ofthe lower values. It is 
not enough to consider only that the fine arts are much 
greater in height when deciding how to allocate public 
resources between them and public health if choices 
must be made that will promote one at the expense of 
the other. Such issues are topics in the theory of correct 
preference and conation, even ifthey also differentiate 
a Husserlian "left" from a Husserlian "right."

MAX WEBER 
Born on April 12, 1864, in 
Erfurt, Germany, Weber was raised in Berlin and stud-
ied 1aw and economics at Heide1berg and Berlin. He 
became professor at Freiburg in 1894 and professor of 
HUMAN SCIENCES ( Geisteswissenschaften) at Heidelberg 
in 1896. After 1897, recurrent and serious problems 
with his physica1 and psycho1ogica1 health prevented 
him from teaching regularly. He resumed teaching at 
Berlin in 1919 and died on June 14, 1920, in Berlin. 
The re1ationship between Max Weber and the first 
generation of phenomenologists was for the most part 
indirect. Weber's basic methodological tenets were 
formed independently ofhis acquaintance with EDMUND 
HUSSERL, and, though in contact with GEORG SIMMEL, 
Husserl seems to have taken practically no notice of 
Weber. Other prominent figures from the first genera-
tion ofphenomenologists, such as MAX SCHELER, ADOLF 
REINACH, and ALEXANDER PFĂNDER, are not mentioned 
in Weber's methodological writings. It is nonetheless 
important to note that both Husserl and Weber can be 
seen as responses to and in many cases extensions ofthe 
work of common sources that include FRANZ BRENTANO, 
WILHELM DILTHEY, Wilhelm WindeJband (1848-1915), 
and most especially Heinrich Rickert ( 1863-1936). 
Moreover, for at least two of the second generation of 
phenomenologists in the broadest sense, Weber's work 
was a crucial source of inspiration, namely ALFRED 
SCHUTZ and KARL JASPERS. ln the former case, the influ-
ence concerns questions ofmethodology, since Schutz 
sees the methodological tenets advanced by Weber and 
CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY not onJy as compatibJe, 
but even as complementing one another and as provid-
ing in their combination the proper foundation for a 
phenomenological human science. For Jaspers, on the 
other hand, it was primarily the personal example of 
his close friend and mentor Weber that, according to 
Jaspers' own account, provided inspiration for his own 
work concerning the proper kind of Existenz in today's 
world. 
Weber's reflections on the methodology of the hu-
man and expecially the social sciences appeared for the 
most part in essays during the first decade ofthe 20th 
century, i.e., in the period following the publication 
of Husserl 's Logische Untersuchungen (1900-190 1 ), 
but preceding Husserl 's move to transcendental pheno-
menology in the Ideen zu ei ner reinen Phănomenologie 
und phănomenologischen Philosophie I (1913 ). The 
exceptions are two essays written for the journal Lo-
gos, on whose advisory board Husserl was a mem-
ber, and the first few paragraphs of the posthumously 
published Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft (Economics and 
society, 1922), which are entitled "Basic Categories in 
Social Science." These were published !ater, but do not 
seem tobe affected by any developments in Husserl's 
thinking. 
There are important parallels between Husserl's 
work and the methodological reflections in Weber's 
essays. Both were seeking a new model for their re-
spective sciences, in Husserl's case for a pure LOGIC 
that could hold for ali sciences, and in Weber's case, 
for the HUMAN SCIENCES. Neither was satisfied with the 
predominant and overwhelming influence ofthe model 
of NATURAL SCIENCE, i.e., NATURALISM, nor- for very 
different reasons -
was either of them satisfied with 
the model of HISTORY as the alternative that had been 
proposed by Dilthey, Winde1band, and Rickert. Both 
objected to the idea of science as a strictly nomoth-
etic discipline, restricted to discovering the unchanging 
patterns, the universal 1aws, of externally observable 
phenenoma. Husserl's rejection of PSYCHOLOGISM and 
an epistemology oriented only toward the empirica! 
classification and explanation of natural events is cited 
by Weber with approval. 
For Weber, the social sciences have as their subject 
matter not merely externally observable patterns ofbe-
havior, but rather social "ACTION," human behavior that 
involves a subjective "MEANING" that is inaccessible to 
the methods of the natural sciences. Social science has 
"understanding" ( Verstehen) as its aim, for it is directed 
at what is "meaningful," at that which is given only in 
interna! experience, e.g., human motivations, beliefs, 
and EMOTIONS. The attempt to uncover the "meaning-
ful" component in human behavior, Weber terms, in 
"Soziologische Grundbegriffe," "interpretation" (Deu-
tung); "understanding" is the result of successful inter-
pretation. A point often overlooked in the literature is

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
that Weber, following Rickert, does not limit the non-
physical objects ofunderstanding to the psychological, 
but also includes, in accord with Husserl, ideal objects 
such as VALUEs and mathematical or logica! relation-
ships that are not themselves interna! states, but are 
nonetheless given only in what Weber calls "interna! 
experience." 
Thus, for example, intellectual understanding at-
tributes a person 's correct answer to a mathematical 
problem to an insight into the mathematical relation-
ship that provides the answer. This is a species of un-
derstanding something "meaningful" since the person 
who is seeking the meaning must ha ve insight into this 
relationship him- or herself in order truly to "under-
stand" the behavior, yet this insight is not primarily 
an insight into a psychological state, but rather into an 
ideal, mathematical state of affairs that we assume the 
other understands as well. Weber himself, however, 
does not make the distinction between the meaning-
ful qua psychological states such as emotions and the 
meaningful qua ideal states of affairs (including the va-
lidity ofvalues) as clearly as does Rickert ( or Husserl), 
and this failure has led to a grea! deal of controversy 
and misunderstanding in subsequent literature on We-
ber. 
Husserl rejects the historical method as a basis for 
philosophy because it too is oriented upon "facts" that 
can never provide the kind of necessity Husserl seeks 
for philosophical knowledge by means of his EIDETIC 
METHOD. By contrast, Weber's repudiation of histori-
cal method amounts to a rejection of the nea-Kantian 
view of history as a model for ali the HUMAN SCIENCES. 
The latter distinguish themselves from the natural sci-
ences because, like history, they are "idiographic," i.e., 
they seek to understand the individual case instead of 
searching for universallaws. But Weber does not wish 
to restrict the domain of social scientific knowledge 
to understanding individual instances. He wants rather 
to leave the possibility open that the social sciences 
could come to discern general regularities and patterns 
in human actions, and he believes that a recognition of 
such patterns and regularities will be an essential com-
ponent ofunderstanding even the concrete and individ-
ual social institution or event. Nor does he think that 
the interes! in the individual is necessarily restricted 
to the historical or cultural disciplines. For example, 
the astronomer might want to understand the causes 
of the specific solar system in which we live, or a 
geologist might want to understand how a specific ge-
ological formation such as the Alps arose. Thus the 
difference between the natural and the social sciences 
cannot be made simply along the lines of the nomo-
thetic/idiographic distinction. What distinguishes the 
two kinds of science is that the natural sciences do 
not consider their phenomena in terms of categories of 
"meaning," and the social sciences, along with other 
disciplines in the human sciences, such as certain kinds 
ofpsychology, do. 
Two other features of Weber's methodology of the 
social sciences parallel aspects of phenomenology. 
First of ali, Weber sharply distinguishes empirica! re-
search from, on the one hand, the conscious method 
of constructing meaningful concepts and types and 
from a priori foundations of values and other ideal 
entitities on the other. This is quite consistent with 
the phenomenological distinction between facts and 
essences and with phenomenology's insistence that 
questions ofvalidity cannot be solved through empiri-
ca! research or through any science that has empirica! 
foundations. But different consequences of these dis-
tinctions are stressed in Husserl and Weber. In the first 
place, Husserl's concern with philosophy as an abso-
lute science of ref!ection excludes questions of em-
pirica! fact, which contrasts with Weber's interes! in 
founding social science as an empirica! science of con-
crete actuality. Thus Weber will insist upon empirically 
verifying the actuality of any conceptual possibility by 
empirica! means, since his interes! is not in a priori 
possibilities, but in actual social realities. 
Furthermore, since the social sciences are tobe em-
pirica!, no decision about the validity of ideal enti-
ties, including values, can be grounded through the so-
cial sciences as such. The distinctions between facts 
and essences and between the constitution of con-
cepts and empirica! research leads Husserl as an ei-
detic phenomenologist to suspend judgment on mat-
ters of fact, while it leads Weber as a social scientist 
to suspend judgment on matters of ideal validity. For 
Weber, one's values may, and indeed necessarily do, 
determine which phenomena one finds interesting and 
which questions one will consider worth pursuing, but 
the answers have tobe obtained "objectively," and it is 
impossible for the social scientist to provide a sufficient 
empirica! justification as a social scientist for the val-

MAX WEBER 
731 
ues that influence his or her work. Neither Husserl nor 
Weber rules out the possibility of the kind of science 
envisaged by the other, but each is careful to distin-
guish what he is doing from that which is the primary 
interest of the other o ne. 
Second, although consciously constructed concepts 
cannot substitute for empirica! research in Weber's 
eyes, empirica! research cannot do without certain 
guiding concepts that govern the interpretati an of the 
data and in terms of which any kind of actual social 
institutions, relationships, or actions are understood. 
Thus the notion of "ideal types" as guiding notions 
for empirica! social research plays an important role 
for him. The primary difference here is that Weber em-
phasizes the practica! ends for which such concepts are 
constructed, and thus stresses the fact that they can be 
revised in light of the findings of historical and other 
empirica! research. Phenomenology, by contrast, is in-
terested in the identification of essential relationships 
that can be ascertained through eidetic variati an in pure 
reflection. Hence one important point of difference be-
tween phenomenology and Weber's treatment of ideal 
types turns on the question of the mutability of the 
concepts that guide the scientist in his or her work. 
Alfred Schutz explicitly borrows from both We-
ber and phenomenology in his methodological reflec-
tions. With direct reference to the opening passages of 
Wirtschafi und Gesellschafi, he follows Weber in de-
scribing his own project as "verstehende Soziologie" 
(a sociology directed at understanding) and declares 
in the foreword to Der sinnhafie Aujbau der sozialen 
Welt (The meaning-structure ofthe social world, 1932) 
that "in the course of these studies the conviction was 
strengthened in me that Max Weber's basic question is 
indeed the point of departure for any genuine theory of 
the social sciences, but that his analyses were not traced 
back to that deeper level from which one can master the 
tasks that ari se out of the procedure of the human sci-
ences themselves." From Schutz's perspective, Weber 
has provided the proper goal for a social science, ECO-
NOMICS as well as sociOLOGY, but failed to trace human 
motivation back to the foundations of consciousness 
that are revea\ed by a CONSTITUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY 
OF THE NATURAL ATTITUDE. Weber fai\ed to achicve this 
goal as thoroughly as he might ha ve done. Thus pheno-
menology provides the underpinnings for the genuine 
understanding of those phenomena that Weber secs as 
thc proper object for social sciences, namely human 
actions. For Schutz, then, phenomenology and We-
ber's methodology are by no means mutually exclu-
sive. Rather, phenomenology provides the foundation 
for the work that Weber had correctly identified as that 
of the social scientist. 
For Karl Jaspers also, the identification of mean-
ing is the goal of the non-natural scicnces, including 
a PSYCHOLOGY oriented toward understanding human 
beings. However, this general view had already been 
articulated by Dilthey and others in addition to Weber. 
It is also truc that especially in his earlier work, Jaspers' 
studies are oricnted toward psychological phenomena 
and consist to a great extent in the description of ideal 
types in terms of which the actual practices of those 
treating the mcntally i1l can bc organized. However, 
what most captivated Jaspers about Wcber was thc !iv-
ing model of an individual facing his own torments, 
ideals, shortcomings, and strengths honestly and reso-
lutely. Thus for him, any theoretical contributions that 
Weber made are much less significant than the exam-
ple that Weber provided in his life. In Jaspers' eyes 
this life was devoted to the ideals of unfliching dcvo-
tion to truth in the face of unjustified dogmas and thc 
willingess always to begin in this search, idcals that for 
Husserl were also associated with the original project 
of phenomenology.

LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN 
Born in Vienna in 
1889, Wittgenstein was the son of a wealthy steel mag-
nate. He had four brothers and three sisters, and ali the 
children were gifted with intellectual and artistic tal-
ent. After studying mechanical engineering in Berlin, 
he went to England, where he studied engineering at 
the University of Manchester. His interest gradually 
shifted toward pure mathematics and the philosophical 
foundations of mathematics, in part due to his read-
ing of Bertrand Russell 's Principles of Mathematics 
(1903). In 1912 he moved to Cambridge to study with 
Russell at Trinity College. Under Russell's supervi-
sion, Wittgenstein made great progress, beginning the 
research that would !ater be published as the Tractatus 
Logico-Philosophicus ( 1921 ). Wittgenstein 's nervous 
and depressed temperament led him to go to Norway 
in 1913, to li ve in seclusion in order to do his logica! 
researches free from distractions. (In fact, his personal-
ity was so striking that many memoirs and biographies 
have been written about him, and there is even a film 
about his life.) 
When World War I broke out, he entered the Aus-
trian army as a volunteer. He continued to work on 
the Tractatus while in the army, carrying notebooks 
along with him and writing when he had the chance. 
He was taken prisoner ofwar in November 1918, ha v-
ing finished the book in August of that year. From the 
prison camp Wittgenstein corresponded with Russell, 
and managed to have the completed Tractatus trans-
ported to him. It was published in 1921. After the war 
Wittgenstein taught at an elementary school in Austria 
for severa! years, then returned to Cambridge, where 
he submitted the Tractatus as a dissertation and re-
ceived his doctorate. He began lecturing in philosophy 
at Cambridge, and succeeded G. E. Moore to the Chair 
of Philosophy in 1939. The only works he published 
during his lifetime were the Tractatus and a paper enti-
tled "Some Remarks on Logica! Form" (1929). During 
World War II he served as a volunteer in hospitals, 
working in the laboratory and making some significant 
contributions to the treatment ofwounded soldiers. He 
returned to his lectures at Cambridge in 1944. Aca-
demic life did not suit Wittgenstein, and he retired 
from Cambridge in 1947 to seek an isolated life and 
work on another book, the Philosophical Investiga-
tions, which was published posthumously in 1953. He 
died of cancer in 1951. 
Wittgenstein's philosophy is generally considered 
to be divided into two ( or three) different phases, 
the "early" Wittgenstein represented by the Tractatus 
and the Notebooks: 1914-1916, the "middle" Wittgen-
stein ( 1929-33) represented primarily by the Blue 
and Brown Books, and the "late" Wittgenstein rep-
resented by the Philosophical1nvestigations, Remarks 
on the Foundations ofMathematics, On Certainty, and 
Zettel. Two other works, the Philosophical Remarks 
and Philosophical Grammar, are placed by some in 
the middle period and by others in the !ater period. 
(It should be noted that there are many unpublished 
manuscripts in the process of being edited and pub-
lished. As these works appear it is inevitable that di-
visions of Wittgenstein 's thought into "periods" will 
need tobe re-evaluated.) 
In his middle and late periods Wittgenstein claims 
that the job of philosophy is to describe and not to 
explain; thus at one level there is obvious reason to 
compare his philosophy with phenomenology. Many 
ha ve compared Wittgenstein 's thought with pheno-
menology, and these comparisons ha ve reached a rather

bewildering range of conclusions. Hence anything that 
is tobe said about "Wittgenstein and phenomenology" 
is likely to be both debatable and debated. 
Wittgenstein 's philosophy has been compared to 
those of EDMUND HUSSERL, ALFRED SCHUTZ, MARTIN 
HEIDEGGER, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, and MAURICE MERLEAU-
PONTY. There are many interesting parallels between 
the philosophies ofWittgenstein and Husserl. Both dis-
cussed important foundational issues in the philosophy 
of mathematics, as well as broader philosophical ques-
tions. Both claimed to be describing, in some way, 
features ofhuman living. Both gave rise to a large and 
variegated following, with many philosophers build-
ing upon their work and many arguing for changes and 
developing in different directions from the "masters." 
Before comparing the philosophy of Wittgenstein 
with phenomenology, one must distinguish between 
two separate claims: (a) that Wittgenstein was, at some 
time or other, actually do ing phenomenology; and (b) 
that Wittgenstein 's thought, while not actually pheno-
menology, can be fruitfully compared with, or used in 
philosophical dialogue with, phenomenology. By now, 
a number of philosophers from both the Continental 
and analytic traditions have argued that thesis (b) is 
true, and some suggestions concern ing the significance 
ofthis claim will be offered below. Whether thesis (a) 
is true or not is an issue about which there is very much 
disagreement. The published arguments for thesis (a) 
exhibit a number of seemingly incompatible claims, 
e.g.: ( 1) the views ofthe early, but not the late, Wittgen-
stein are akin to phenomenology, and Wittgenstein has 
no "middle period" (Merrill and Jaakko Hintikka); (2) 
the middle-period Wittgenstein is "phenomenological" 
in the wider sense of the term (HERBERT SPIEGELBERG); 
(3) the middle and late Wittgenstein are thoroughly 
phenomenological (Nicholas Gier); and (4) Wittgen-
stein 's entire philosophical career is phenomenological 
( GERD BRAND ). 
On the other hand, it has been argued that Husserl's 
method amounts to entering into just the sort of "pri-
vate language" the possibility of which Wittgenstein 
denied (SUZANNE CUNNINGHAM), and that for method-
o[ogica) reasons, thesis (a) is not supported by Wittgen-
stein 's writings (HARRY RE EDER). The arguments for and 
against thesis (a) stern from differing interpretations of 
both Wittgenstein 's philosophical method and the na-
ture ofphenomenological reduction and description. 
How can one compare Wittgenstein's thought to 
phenomenology in the face of such diverse interpreta-
tion? One way is to "accentuate the positive," that is, to 
outline some interesting parallels between the pheno-
menological movement and Wittgenstein 's thought. At 
least in Wittgenstein 's middle and late periods, he says 
that the job of philosophy is to describe and not to 
explain. His descriptions of language-use are often 
couched in terms of"language-games," either invented 
by Wittgenstein to compare and contrast with ordi-
nary language (and, as such, are at best very indirect 
"descriptions"), or descriptions ofvarious parts ofthe 
actual use of ordinary language. Some have likened 
Wittgenstein 's use of imaginary language-games to 
Husserl 's use offree variation in phantasy in the EIDETIC 
METHOD, although Wittgenstein's rejection ofphenom-
ena universal to ali language-games makes this claim 
somewhat problematic. Wittgenstein views LANGUAGE 
as made up of a "family" of language-games; the re-
lations between the various language-games are left 
rather vague in Wittgenstein, except for the overarch-
ing fact that each language-game is part of the overall 
natural language, which is too rich to be "reduced" 
or "explained" by any sort of formal logica! represen-
tation. Although his early Tractatus seems to many to 
suggest just such a formal representation, his !ater work 
-
avowedly written to overturn his earlier thought-
rejects such a project. 
The middle and late Wittgenstein goes to great 
lengths to avoid theorizing, and yet there are some quite 
general points that characterize his thought. Through-
out ali the stages ofhis philosophical thought Wittgen-
stein is preoccupied by the ro le and limits of language 
in human life. The early Wittgenstein develops an elab-
orate logica! model to explain the fit between Ianguage 
and reality. His Tractatus was thought by Russell, by 
members of the Vienna Circle, and by many others, to 
be closely related to logica! positivism and Russell's 
logica! atomism. However, there is evidence, published 
in the form ofsome ofWittgenstein's correspondence, 
that Wittgenstein regarded this to be a grave misinter-
pretation of the Tractatus. One important part of that 
work is the view that some things cannot be said in lan-
guage (philosophical or otherwise), although they can 
be "shown." This aspect of his early thought seems 
to have remained a part of his view throughout his 
philosophicallife. 

734 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
According to the Tractatus, language "pictures" the 
world by dividing it into logically distinct simple parts. 
This is one part ofhis early philosophical thought that 
he !ater rejects, suggesting instead that the link be-
tween language and the world is much more com-
plex and intertwined. One may insightfully compare 
the Tractatus with Husserl 's Logische Untersuchun-
gen ( 1900--190 1 ), sin ce both deal with the nature of 
language and the founding of true propositions about 
language and the world. However, one must be care-
fully mindful of the methodological contexts of these 
discussions and to distinguish between claims (a) and 
(b) above. For example, whereas Wittgenstein claims 
that " ... every sentence 'is in order as it is,'" Husserl 
notes that proper phenomenological descriptions must 
begin with meanings taken from ordinary language 
(and from the philosophical tradition), but then modifY 
them to reflect new insights resulting from phenomen-
ological descriptions. 
Wittgenstein 's thought -
in ali periods -
can be 
said to reject many traditional elements ofphilosophy. 
He thinks that the purpose of philosophy is to settle 
theoretical disputes not by solving problems, but by 
"dissolving" them -
usually by suggesting ways in 
which wrong-headed views about language and how it 
functions sow the seeds for a misunderstanding, or as 
he says, "philosophical problems arise when language 
goes on holiday." (Compare with this his statement 
in the preface to the Tractatus that this book, which 
attempts "to set a limit to thought, or rather -
not 
to thought, but to the expression of thoughts," and 
which achieves "the final solution of the problems," 
nonetheless "shows how little is achieved when these 
problems are solved.") Attempts at philosophical ex-
planation arise because philosophers are bewitched by 
language. This contrasts widely with Husserl's more 
traditional interpretation of the ro le and scope of phi-
losophy and its problems. Above ali, Wittgenstein's 
rejection of philosophical explanation seems at odds 
with Husserl 's declared interest in the Logische Unter-
suchungen to establish- in a methodologically defen-
sible manner- LOGIC as a theory ofscience, as well as 
with the usual interpretations ofthe "phenomenologi-
cal movement" as a coherent and ongoing, concrete 
body of philosophical knowledge and practice. (Thus 
it would seem that those that wish to argue for thesis 
(a), above, are interpreting the results ofWittgenstein 's 
investigations in a way quite different from Wittgen-
stein 's own self-interpretation.) 
Connected to Wittgenstein 's rejection ofphilosoph-
ical explanation is his rejection of the concept of 
"essence." Traditional accounts ofthe "essential" fea-
tures oflanguage are rejected, tobe replaced by care fu! 
attention to how language is used, and to the ubiqui-
tous but self-concealing nature of"grammar" -a term 
that acquired a unique sense in Wittgenstein 's work, 
again one that has been widely interpreted. In fact, 
Wittgenstein claims that it is grammar that provides 
the closest thing to essential or universal elements of 
language-games. He claims that there are no essential 
features of language-games, features that are present 
in ali instances of language-use; rather, the features 
oflanguage blend together in interlocking strands that 
he compares to fibers in a rope and to "family resem-
blances." This view would appear to rule out elements 
central to the methods employed in Husserl 's, Hei-
degger's, and many other phenomenologists' work, in-
cluding such universal features of human experience 
as protention and retention, historicity, horizonality, the 
lived BODY, the gaze ofthe alter ego, and other central 
elements ofthe LIFEWORLD, although here too, some in-
terpreters find more similarities between Wittgenstein 
and phenomenology than this would seem to suggest, in 
part due to Wittgenstein 's insistence that explanations 
must come to an end, leaving us not with full explana-
tions, but with careful attention to actual praxis. 
Wittgenstein 's descriptions oflanguage-use contain 
much that should be of interest to phenomenologists, 
regardless of whether or not they think that Wittgen-
stein is actually do ing phenomenology. How much use 
phenomenologists can make ofWittgenstein's descrip-
tions depends both upon how they view his philosoph-
ical method and upon how they see this method in 
relation with phenomenological method (and there is 
a wide span of opinions as to just what the phenomen-
ological method is and entails). Some, like Reeder and 
the Hintikkas, argue that Wittgenstein 's methodology 
is not one of full description, but one of reduction-
istic description, reducing philosophical problems to 
purely linguistic issues in a way foreign to phenomen-
ology. Others, like Gier and Brand, find in Wittgen-
stein's works brilliant phenomenological descriptions 
of the LIFEWORLD. This difference of opinion tends to 
divide over the question of whether or not there is 

LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN 
735 
in Wittgenstein something like EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION. 
Gier, PAUL RICCEUR, and to some extent Brand find some 
analogue of the epoche in Wittgenstein, while others, 
like Spiegelberg and Reeder, are much more conser-
vative in their assessment ofthis issue, finding no true 
epoche in Wittgenstein 's works. In large part, these 
disagreements stern from differing judgments about 
key concepts of Wittgenstein 's philosophy, especially 
those of"grammar," "forms oflife," and the nature and 
method of his descriptions. After all, not all descrip-
tions are phenomenological, and the key methodolog-
ical difference between phenomenological and non-
phenomenological descriptions stems from the status 
ofthose descriptions as determined by a methodolog-
ical framework that is based in some form of epoche, 
whether in Husserl 's sense or in the various other forms 
it takes in other phenomenologists. To be sure, the 
epoche has been revised and reinterpreted by both phe-
nomenologists of the "narrow" sort and phenomenol-
ogists in the "wider sense" established by Spiegelberg 
in his important and thorough The Phenomenological 
Movement (3rd ed., 1982). 
Phenomenologists can use Wittgenstein's descrip-
tions of language-games and their interrelations as 
guides in sorting out the complex intersubjective hori-
zons of that form of life called language. His subtle 
descriptions of following rules, of how we learn lan-
guage games, of the complexities of ostensive defini-
tions, and ofthe ever flexible relations ofthe meanings 
ofwords in their diverse uses provide a wealth of detail 
that can be clarified phenomenologically, if one notes 
the methodological differences between Wittgenstein 's 
descriptions and those ofthe unqualifiedly recognized 
phenomenologists. For instance, Wittgenstein's holis-
tic account of the interrelated yet distinct language-
games in some ways parallels Husserl's and Heideg-
ger's view of the primacy of the lived phenomen-
ological unity of many-horizoned experience, prior to 
any analysis, description, or explanation. Certainly his 
stress upon the public and social elements oflanguage-
games can help phenomenologists to identify and ex-
plore various significant features ofthe intersubjective 
constitution of discourse. In this respect, such contem-
porary continental thinkers as Karl-Otto Apel, Jtirgen 
Habermas, and Paul Ricceur ha ve carried out just such 
researches, and have explored the common ground 
between Wittgenstein and HERMENEUTICAL PHENOMEN-
OLOGY, in ways beneficia! to the further development 
of phenomenology and to the ongoing influence of 
Wittgenstein 's thought. 
All in all, despite the differing interpretations ofthe 
relationship between Wittgenstein 's philosophy and 
phenomenology, there is room for much more to be 
said on the issue. Certainly one can find rich and accu-
rate descriptions of many linguistic "phenomena" (in 
the wide sense of the term) in Wittgenstein 's works. 
Scholars have already developed fruitful comparisons 
between Wittgenstein's thought and that of various 
phenomenologists, and there is good reason to believe 
that a great deal of further such work will be enlight-
ening. The focus upon public criteria of MEANING and 
the intersubjective nature of Wittgenstein 's language-
games offers a counterbalance to Husserl 's so-called 
idealistic tendencies, stemming from his focus upon 
the constituting transcendental EGO. The participants 
in Wittgenstein's language-games are indeed dwellers 
in the lifeworld, in ways that will continue tobe worked 
out at greater depth.

WORLD 
Of ali the basic ideas that pheno-
menology developed, perhaps none is better known or 
more widely appropriated across a number of disci-
plines than the concept of the lifeworld (Lebenswelt). 
What is not generally recognized, however, is that the 
notion ofthe lifeworld is itself derived from the prob-
lematics of a prior notion, that of the world. In fact, 
EDMUND HUSSERL had developed the notion ofworld in 
a transcendental register before he enriched it with his 
notion of the lifeworld. And MARTIN IIEIDEGGER's Sein 
und Zeit (1927) as well as his other writings contain 
extensive analyses ofthe concept ofthe world but resist 
introducing the term "lifeworld," lest it be construed 
as a regional rather than a transcendental concept. One 
could even go on to argue that for ali the variations 
in the approach to the question of subjectivity among 
phenomenological thinkers as diverse as Husserl, Hei-
degger, GABRIEL MARCEL, MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY, and 
JEAN-PAUL SARTRE (and also Jilrgen Habermas) there is a 
surprising consistency in their characterizations of the 
notion ofthe world. The differences we do find, which 
we will look atin the analysis that follows, are possible 
because so much is shared. Perhaps it is this concept 
that provides them with their deepest connection to 
each other. 
Any philosophical analysis ofthe world is intemally 
connected to the position from which one approaches 
it. Phenomenology takes its starting point in our ev-
eryday experience of things. An object of experience 
is always present through multiple modes of givenness, 
each of which forms a profite of the object. The inter-
play of object and profile transpires according to the 
sense (Sinn) of the whole both determin ing and deter-
mined by the sense of the profiles. Without senses the 
object would lack its experiential qualities. But senses 
exist not in the object or its profiles but in the relation-
ship between them and the one to whom they appear. 
Profiles are also perspectives, which means that an ob-
ject is always present as situated in space and time. 
Initially we can say that the spatial place of the object 
and its temporal presence do not exist in the object or 
its profiles but in the relationship between them and 
the one to whom they appear. 
The interna! connection between profiles and ob-
jects is a clue to the conscious events in or through 
which they are experienced. Since these are events that 
are always directed to the object through its modes of 
givenness, they are acts that ha ve an ee-static structure; 
since sense is constitutive of that transcendence, they 
have INTENTIONALITY. And this means that they are not 
directed to themselves as events or achievements, but 
to the objects with which they are concemed. 
The experience of profiles (Abschattungen, some-
times also called adumbrations) and objects in a given 
situation transpires in such a way that the coming pro-
file is already anticipated and prefigured by the profile 
in focus. Profiles, by virtue of their sense, point to or 
indicate yet other profiles in such a way that we find 
things situated in a field of possible appearances, i.e., 
in a determinate horizon. The horizon is not itself an 
appearance but is always "pregiven," i.e., it mediates 
the relationship between what is given and the anticipa-
tions that it solicits. The horizon is a complex of senses, 
themselves connected by what we can caii differential 
implications, that structure the indications in play with 
any given profile. Jndication is the horizon at play in the 
relationship between profiles and then between profile 
and object. Dif.ferential implication is the horizon at 
play within itself. Bringing these two strands together, 
we can describe the horizon as a nexus of indications 
( Verweisungszusammenhang ). 
Horizons are tied to yet other horizons also by differ-
ential implication. The nexus of these interconnected 
horizons is what constitutes the world. In Husserl 's 
terminology, it is the horizon of ali horizons. 
Perhaps the best way to understand Husserl's de-
veloped notion of the lifeworld is to isolate his char-
acterization of it as horizon and then examine how it 
figures in his assessment of modern NATURAL SCIENCE, 
i.e., the science ofmedium-sized objects begun in the 
17th century and extending up to recent developments 
in quantum and astrophysical theory. (Others of his

WORLD 
studies relate the HUMAN SCIENCES and also LOGIC and 
MATHEMATICS to the lifeworld.) He undertakes both a 
critica! account, in which science precipitates a crisis 
for Western thought by valorizing the "objectivistic" 
image ofthe world, setting it in opposition to the life-
world and then devaluing the latter as world of mere 
belief, and a genetic account, in which science regains 
its moorings as we come to understand the scope of its 
legitimacy by seeing how it does arise from the life-
world and how it can be connected to essential, human 
interests. 
In his effort to overthrow the positivistic, objec-
tivistic or NATURALISTIC self-understanding of modern 
science, in the hope of then repositioning it on its 
proper philosophical ground and bringing it under the 
direction of rationally justifiable human ends, Husserl 
directly challenges the identification of the world it 
projects- roughly, the mathematized world of New-
tonian physics consisting only of quantitative determi-
nations- with the only true world-in-itself. The world 
in which we li ve and with which we are most familiar, 
day in and day out, is not the one projected by scien-
tific thought. Rather the things we "first" see belong to 
the world ofwhat Husserl calls Anschauung, intuition, 
a term he uses to describe our direct perceptual and 
experiential acquaintance with the everyday things of 
our environment "before" they, wrapped in interpreta-
tion, stand forth as data. Here we tind the lush green of 
a field in an early morning haze, not light waves 512 
nanometers in length, refracted by vaporized H20 as 
the axis ofthe earth turns. 
The intuitive world should be defined not as a core 
ofpre-cultural, primitive perceptions, but as the world 
in which things appear in terms of their experiential 
qualities, values, and uses, and are integrated into our 
larger concerns on the basis of their integrity. This is 
the world that stands over against the quantified world 
of modem science. But Husserl, in addition, argues that 
the lifeworld is also the world from which the world 
projected in the natural sciences arises. He does this 
by showing that the world under a scientific descrip-
tion is a construction that takes its starting point from 
and arises through methodologically guided transfor-
mations of the lifeworld. As he first put it in lectures 
in 1919 (Manuscript signature F I 35), the objects of 
the immediately intuited world already have a sense-
content that functions as a substrate for scientific work. 
737 
The intuition of an object or event involves the in-
terlocking of PERCEPTION and apperception, of presen-
tation and appresentation. As an intentiona! experience 
ofthe whole object, it is drawn beyond what analysis 
would describe as the directly given, for each profile 
is situated in a series of anticipated, possible profiles, 
predelineated by the horizon in play, and each intuition 
transcends the profile in its apprehension ofthe whole. 
The interplay between actual profile and anticipated 
profiles is not a random but a structured series, as they 
tend to converge on an optimum that ongoing experi-
ence exhibits as it approaches. Through the "and so on" 
of profiles and an attending subordination ofprofiles to 
the wholes they indicate, senses become stable types 
and objects take up their familiar presence for us. The 
natural attitude relies on this constitution of a familiar 
world, yet without being able to thematize it as such. 
Born of wonder, philosophy and science, not yet 
distinguished in ancient Greece, were efforts at dis-
covering and articulating the logos of this unthema-
tized world. They broke with, but not through, the nat-
ural attitude in the sense that they transcend the endless 
iteration produced by the horizon in order to grasp seg-
ments of it as wholes. This required a reflection that 
temporarily suspends the interests that sustain the func-
tioning of differential implications, deliberately varies 
the appearances of a gi ven field in such a way that their 
optima are allowed to exhibit a limiting ideal or point 
of unity; and finally, articulates the rules that govern 
the series ofphenomena that now show themselves as 
instances of or approximations to the eidos. The value 
ofthis method is that it produces a theoretical or crit-
ica! mastery of the objectifiable features or properties 
of a given region, which yields a practica! or technical 
mastery allowing us to build and rebuild our environ-
ments. 
Various disciplines arose as they concentrated on 
different regions ofthe world and submitted them to a 
process of classification and explanation. While break-
ing with it, they were originally rooted in the lifeworld, 
in the sense that they depended upon a wider, pre-
given yet unthematized horizon distributing the differ-
ent regions; in the sense that the processes of ideation 
and idealization were continuous with the project of 
rendering the type-bound perceptual optima we ex-
perience exact; in the sense that the "sciences" were 
largely practica! arts whose explanatory schemes were 

738 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
designed to produce changes in the world; and in the 
sense that their theoretical component, at Ieast up to 
Aristotle, belonged to the same uni verse of discourse 
as ordinary Ianguage. 
The introduction of modem natural science brought 
about a fundamental paradigm shift. By transforming 
idealization into mathematization, by identifying the 
world as a totality covering aii that exists and then 
characterizing it in terms of a mathematized notion of 
infinity, the world and the things in it become inter-
preted as mathematizable manifolds, i.e., reduced to 
the intersection of sets of features that can be mea-
sured, plotted, and submitted to statistica! description 
and verification. The method is designed to eliminate 
the perceptual background and establish the theoreti-
cal field of quantifiable predicates and causally Iinked 
relations as the sole context in which things, facts, or 
events can show themselves. While this yields even 
greater theoretical understanding and technical mas-
tery over the things ofnature, it results in science !os ing 
any recognizable bond to the Iifeworld. 
Building on the double forgetting constitutive of 
the natural attitude, modern science is twice free yet 
twice blind: free from the relativity of subjectivity and 
free from the relativity ofthe Iifeworld; blind to those 
epistemic practices by means of which it is produced 
and blind to the transformations of background that 
allows phenomena to stand forth as data. 
But the deperspectivization ofthe world by modem 
science is never complete, because its content comes 
forth from a field that, while universal, is constituted 
by theoretically sustained practices it must acknowl-
edge as such when there is a breakdown or paradox 
generated in a given field of study (e.g., particle vs. 
wave theory), and because its method relies on activ-
ities that involve ordinary intuitions and experimental 
operations that require nonformalizable acts of inter-
pretation (e.g., reading marks on instruments). Since 
even the science that has rid the world of subjectivity 
can only be understood as the "correlate" of subjectiv-
ity, the phenomenological critique of science already 
points the way to an understanding of how its legit-
imacy can be established: the project of developing 
the theoretical and practica! knowledge that allows for 
a mastery of nature must be blended into a broader 
range of human interests and the Iarger project of hu-
man emancipation. 
Husserl undertook studies ofthe relationship ofthe 
Iifeworld not only to the natural sciences, but also to 
logic and cultural formations. These studies carne in 
the early 1 920s, just as he was developing his notion 
of GENETIC PHENOMENOLOGY. The treatment of logic, in 
both his Formale und transzendentale Logik (1929) 
and Eifahrung und Urteil ( 1939), attempts to trace its 
semantics back to a pregiven perceptual world and an 
interest in TRUTH that transforms ordinary into propo-
sitional discourse. Logica! REASON, he was convinced, 
never Ioses its roots in practica! reason. The treatment 
of cultural formations as constructions that both pre-
suppose and yet arise out of the Iifeworld reflects his 
debt to WILHELM DILTHEY. While there are studies in 
this area that go back as far as 19 1 O, the first indica-
tion of this in his published writings are three articles 
that appeared in 1923 and 1924 in the Japariese peri-
odica!, Kaizo, reprinted in in 1989 in his Aufsătze und 
Vortrăge [ 1922-193 7] along with two other essays that 
never appeared. His basic approach is to see the devel-
opment of humanity toward its rationally defined true 
end as a progressive historcal transformation ofvarious 
cultural forms within the Iifeworld. 
There are clear tensions in Husserl 's characteri-
zation of the Iifeworld, which Die Krisis der eu-
ropăischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale 
Phănomenologie (1936) struggles to resolve. They 
arise because while he was the first to characterize 
the world as horizon, he tends to superimpose upon it 
features that arise ifwe think of it as totality. The wor1d 
is treated both as the experiential world of intuition that 
underlies and grounds the world of practica! and the-
oretical goals, and as a concrete whole that- due to 
the "flowing in" and "sedimentation" of practica! and 
cultural achievements-encompasses the multiplicity 
of particular worlds. 
The two notions of Iifeworld, world as experien-
tial whole and world as concrete universal, are easier 
to place together if we think of the world as horizon, 
break with Husserl's tendency to reduce LANGUAGE to 
its expressive function, and require him to supplement 
the notion of background with that of context. Par-
ticular worlds are forged through intersubjective, so-
cial achievements and thus necessarily rely on differ-
ent types of discursive interaction for the construction 
of their domains, for the dynamics of communication 
within them, and for the regulation of their activities. 

WORLD 
Language comes into play and, along with it, concep-
tual networks without which we would not ha ve partic-
ular spheres. These networks are contexts. In contrast 
to backgrounds, which are complexes of senses de-
ployed across the relationship of our BODY to things, 
contexts can be described as socially constructed and 
inscribed matrices of meaning (Bedeutung). The rela-
tionship between elements in a matrix is o ne of differ-
ential entailment. The relationship between facts and 
affair-complexes constituted in contexts can be char-
acterized as referential entailment. 
We gain purchase on the notion of the lifeworld 
only if we characterize the horizon in terms of the 
interplay of context and background. In that ali re-
gions are situated within differential blends of context 
and background, which they also (re )structure through 
sedimentation, the horizon is a concrete universal. 
In that ali contexts presuppose and thus rest upon a 
(back)ground of embodied perceptual experience (in-
tuition) and practica! involvements (know-how), the 
description of the horizon as experiential matrix can 
be turned into a point about the interna! organization 
ofthe horizon itself. 
In Sein und Zeit (1927) MARTIN HEIDEGGER observes 
that our basic sense ofthings comes from our practica! 
involvement with them as implements or equipment 
(Zeug), not as items of detached perceptual cognition. 
In his terms, the objects that we are related to "proxi-
mally and for the most part" should not be character-
ized as present-at-hand (vorhanden), not as the sheer 
things we look at and cognitively register (Sicht), but 
as ready-to-hand (zuhanden), as objects that, in our 
looking around, we view as appropriate for certain 
practica! tasks ( Umsicht). This means that equipment, 
as what we use to reach a certain end, is defined by its 
functional involvement (Bewandtnis) in a task or situ-
ation in which we are also caught up. And this entails 
that the basic sense that we have of ourselves is not 
as a cognizing subject who is related to things, but as 
an engaged agent who is involved with them and who 
finds what he or she is in what he or she does. Because 
the dyads of inner and outer, passive and active, and 
subject and object are inadequate to cover the recip-
roca! determination and circulation we find between 
actions, systems of involvement, and objects, Heideg-
ger replaced Husserl 's notion of subjectivity with the 
concept ofDASEIN (human existence). 
739 
When something is an object in use, its being as 
equipment is not thematic. It is lost in the goal or the 
task at hand, i.e., it indicates or points not to itself but 
the nail to be struck, the board to be sawed, the shed to 
be built. But if the hammer or saw breaks, if it is not 
sui table for the task at hand, or if it is just plain miss-
ing, we are immediately redirected back upon the item 
in terms of its instrumentality and its relation to yet 
other equipment. When indication is disturbed, indica-
tion becomes explicit. What the object is is understood 
in terms of just its differential relationship to yet other 
items in the shop. Thereby, the workshop with its total-
ity of equipment comes into view. And with this whole, 
the world announces itself. 
This preliminary "ontic" presencing of the world 
as environing world ( Umwelt) becomes the guiding 
thread to Heidegger's FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGICAL char-
acterization of the worldliness ( Weltlichkeit) of the 
world, i.e., the world as it belongs to the transcen-
dental structure ofDasein. Each tool points to a whole 
of equipment in which what is ready-tohand shows 
itself as such. That whole, however, is a system of in-
volvements that can exist only by virtue of an interna! 
relation to what allows for such involvement. Involve-
ments are established for the sake of Dasein and its 
projects. But this happens in such a way that Dasein 
is necessarily referred to the nexus of involvements as 
that in which it comes to realize and understand itself. 
Heidegger's study of instrumental objects allows him 
to uncover a structure that applies to ali regions and 
thus belongs to Dasein itself: the world, to which ali 
human action is referred and in which it is situated. 
He characterized it ontologically as the nexus of indi-
cations that is constitutive of the involvement of self, 
objects, and others in various situations. 
Husserl had clearly developed basic elements of 
his theory of the lifeworld in course lectures and 
manuscripts before the publication of Sein und Zeit, 
and there are indications that Heidegger was famil-
iar with some of them. Still, Heidegger's approach 
through a study of instrumental backgrounds is orig-
inal and sparkles with a precision missing even from 
Husserl 's )ater accounts in the Krisis. We might set his 
account of the world over against Husserl 's in roughly 
three ways. 
(1) Though Husserl carne to broaden his notion of 
intuition, that mode in which the world is disclosed, 

740 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
it still yields only a derivative notion of objects and, 
as a consequence, of world, not the one that is in fact 
operative in the originally practica! natural attitude. 
Because looking-at or looking-onto (An-schauen) al-
ready effects a separation between the look and the 
use of things, Husserl gives at best a phenomenologi-
cal account of the background constitutive of what is 
present-at-hand. At worst, he makes the mistake of 
attempting to derive the ready-to-hand (the world of 
practica! objects) from the present-athand (the world 
of intuited objects ). 
(2) The tension that we find in Husserl's charac-
terization of the world as uni verse of intuition and as 
concrete universal is clearly resolved by Heidegger's 
rejection ofthe first and his modification ofthe second. 
While he does think of world as covering all regions 
of existence in the sense that as concrete, it is "modifi-
able" into the structural wholes ofwhatever particular 
worlds we ha ve at the time and in the sense that its a pri-
ori structure is operative in each ofthem, he institutes a 
mode of analysis that does not require tuming the world 
into an object, and thus preserves its integrity as a struc-
ture of meaning. Husserl argued against KANT that the 
world is an object. Heidegger sides with Kant. The 
problem is that in his effort to articulate the "subjec-
tive achievements" in and through which the world as 
world is constituted, Husserl 's first Cartesian program 
necessarily construes it as a world "for" consciousness 
and thus as "outside" its being. Because Heidegger 
understands achievements as based in our practica! in-
teraction with things, which is itself caught up in a 
nexus of involvement, he develops a HERMENEUTICS of 
world that moves to it as a whole from within. As a re-
suit, he can do justice to Dasein's facticity (Faktizităt), 
the sense in which Dasein is in the world and not just 
related to the world. Perhaps this is the reason why Part 
One of Sein und Zeit does not directly employ Husserl 's 
notion of horizon in its characterization of the world. 
Heidegger worries that even with the broader notion of 
lifeworld that covers ali regions of existence, not just 
the intuitive, Husserl 's account is sti li mixed and still 
bound to a "pre-ontological existentiell meaning." 
(3) While both Husserl and Heidegger use the notion 
of indication as the key to the notion of world, there 
are important and subtle differences. For Husserl, indi-
cation (Anzeige) operates by a movement of one item 
pointing (hinweisen) to yet another in such a way that 
an item that is lifted out or prominent establishes an-
ticipations of what is similar. Identity is primary; dif-
ference is derived. The unlike, as he says, comes to 
prominence on the hasis of the common. As a result, 
horizons are build up by unifying syntheses and should 
be described as webs with nodes having a sense-content 
that establishes relations of opposition and difference 
to yet other nodes, i.e., as nexuses of identificational 
schemata. For Heidegger, indication (Verweisung) is 
a constant movement of deferring such that the sim-
ilarity between objects and then their identity results 
from their place in a web of functional oppositions 
and contrasts. Accordingly, the horizons are nexuses 
of differential schemata. 
But Heidegger also struggled with the limits of his 
own analysis. From the perspective of his !ater work 
the developed ontologica! notion ofworld (and Dasein 
itself) in Sein und Zeit was but a preliminary study 
that opens the way to the question ofBeing. In "Bauen 
Wohnen Denken" (1951) it seems that the in-structure 
ofDasein, which was first understood in terms (Befind-
lichkeit and Verstehen) that paralleled the traditional 
concepts of sensibility and understanding, is reinter-
preted in terms of the notion of dwelling (Wohnen). 
Dwelling allows objects and others the type of involve-
ment they have as it serves as the hasis for building 
(Bauen), that primary activity ofthose who dwell and, 
we can add, the activity that framed the whole account 
of the ready-to-hand in Sein und Zeit. However, in-
volvement is defined here not by the notion of world, 
but by that ofthe "fourfold" (das Geviert): by dwelling 
being on the earth, under the heavens, called forth by 
the divinity, in relation to mortals. If dwelling is the 
hasis of building, that project of founding and joining 
lived spaces, and building is essential to the worldli-
ness ofthe world in which we dwell, as Sein und Zeit 
might lead us to believe, then we can see the late Hei-
degger reaching for a notion, the fourfold, on which 
the world is based and from which it is derived. 
MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY had access to the Husserl 
manuscripts of Ideen zu einer reinen Phănomenologie 
und phănomenologischen Philosophie II [ 1912-15] 
and much of the Krisis as he was writing his ground-
breaking Phimomenologie de la perception ( 1945). He 
realized that over against the published account in 
Ideen I ( 1913) of intentionality as a mental structure 
belonging to "absolute" consciousness, there was a sec-

WORLD 
ond account in play that re! ied on the notion of lived 
BODY (Leib) to explain the dependence of perceptual 
acts on ACTION, the spatiality of perceptual fields, and 
those "passive syntheses" that accord things their per-
ceptual senses. At the same time, the categoria! account 
of the notion of Dasein in Heidegger seemed to Iose 
the particular concreteness that is true of our existence 
and that was required by his own notion of facticity. 
Merleau-Ponty's solution was not only to character-
ize the subject in terms being-in/to-the world (etre-
aumonde), but also to introduce the lived body and 
corporeal existence -
an idea Heidegger would ha ve 
considered pre-ontological- as the primary mode of 
that being. Giving prominence to the lived body al-
lowed Merleau-Ponty to root perceptual experience in 
something deeper than mental acts (Ideen /) or struc-
tural features of conscious fields (Sein und Zeit); to sta-
bilize the difference between non-epistemic and cultur-
ally and linguistically mediated epistemic perception; 
and finally, to develop a notion of perceptual horizon 
in which senses are located in the interna! connection 
between perception and the actions ofthe body. 
Husserl 's strong notion of EVIDENCE required re-
course to presentations and intuitions as means through 
which the structure of different fields of phenomena 
could be established. His Cartesianische Meditationen 
[ 1931] drew out the consequence of this approach for 
an understanding of our relations with others and left 
US with a theory of INTERSUBJECTIVITY that required a 
starting point in the intuitive experience ofthe isolated 
subject and a notion of empathy to explain how we 
cross the abyss between my consciousness and that of 
the other. While clearly there are other approaches to 
the question of intersubjectivity and the social world 
at play from 191 O through the Krisis- and while one 
could argue that the Meditationen text was not intended 
as an account ofthe constitution of our primary cohab-
itation with others, but a transcendental reconstruction 
designed to secure in evidence the presence of others-
it was and stil! is taken as Husserl's definitive account 
of social existence. The inadequacies of this account 
were made ali the more evident by the ease with which 
Sein und Zeit moved from Dasein to Mitsein and, in 
fact, accounted for its priority: our involvement with 
equipment is such that it is ready-to-hand for others 
also, not as others who stand over against me, but as 
others from whom 1 do not distinguish myself. The 
741 
world ofDasein is essentially the world in which 1 am 
with others (Mitwelt). 
Husserl's and Heidegger's phenomenological ap-
proaches to the question of the world opened the way 
for the work of ALFRED scHUTZ and many others who 
attempted to connect a phenomenology of the social 
world with the notion of the world as used in so-
CIOLOGY and the cultura] or HUMAN SCIENCES. While 
Der sinnhafle Aujbau der sozialen Welt (The meaning-
structure of the social world, 1932) stil! moves out 
from the experiential world of the solitary ego to an 
account ofmy understanding of others, Schutz quickly 
distinguishes between taking the other as an object and 
taking the other as a "Thou." When the I-Thou re-
lation becomes reciproca! we have a we-relationship. 
The face-to-face situation, he argues, is basic to ali 
other types of other-orientation, but is in itself empty. 
Ali it does is secure the (recognition of) the presence 
of the other as Thou. In order for the we-relationship 
to acquire specificity and content, the social world in 
which the we-relationship is grounded and from which 
it unfolds must become part of the analysis. The so-
cial world, spatially and temporally extended from the 
world of direct social experience to the distant worlds 
of our predecessors and successors, he characterizes 
as a nexus of significance (Sinnzusammenhang). In 
Strukturen der Lebenswelt (Structures ofthe lifeworld, 
1973, 1983), his work in progress when he died in 
1959, Schutz continues to argue for the thoroughly so-
cial character of the everyday lifeworld but expands 
his initial notion of nexus of significance through a 
stronger theory of action. 
Drawing upon hints in Husserl, Heidegger, and 
Merleau-Ponty and yet responding to the surprising 
lack of any developed theory of technology in the 
thinkers considered thus far, DON IHDE's major work, 
Technology and the Lifeworld ( 1990), looks to pheno-
menological and hermeneutica! dimensions oftechno-
logically mediated experience as the key to what we 
mean by lifeworld. The excessively "cognitive" ap-
proach to the transformation ofthe lifeworld, stressing 
the impact of scientific theory or cultural interpreta-
tions on how we see things, is replaced with a rich 
account of the way the instruments we build and the 
devices we use concretely transform not just the things 
in our environment, but the style of our embodied rela-
tionship to them. Because technologies "enframe," the 

742 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
lifeworld assumes a variety of "shapes" that can best 
be studied through an account of the transformative 
effects of the devices and systems of instruments that 
we develop. 
Ifwe can situate Ihde's account in terms ofSchutz's 
neglect ofthe material transformations ofthe lifeworld 
produced by technology, we can find Jtirgen Haber-
mas's theory of the lifeworld attempting simultane-
ously to expand upon the culturally abridged concept of 
the world in Schutz by distinguishing cultural, social, 
and personality structures and mechanisms of repro-
duction, and to dislodge the primacy ofthe sociologica! 
notion of system in Talcott Parsons ( 1902-1979) and 
Niklas Luhmann by seeing it as a theoretical concept 
whose application depends upon an account of forms 
of action and integration as viewed from the perspec-
tive of participants in a lifeworld. Habermas expands 
and corrects Husserl 's "correlational a priori": one way 
to view his monumental Theorie des kommunikativen 
Handelns (Theory of communicative action, 1981) is 
to see the notion of intersubjective communicative dis-
course (Voi. 1) as a noetics of communicative action 
(his corrected and developed vers ion of Husserl 's un-
derlying structure of intentionality), and to view his 
multifaceted notion of lifeworld (Voi. 2) as its NOEMAT-
tcs. 
Because he relies even more heavily than in ear-
lier theory upon relations across structural components 
of the lifeworld, and because he stresses the histor-
ical transformation of the lifeworld from earlier to 
modem societies, Habermas takes horizon as a notion 
that allows coordination between the different types 
of communication and action. Concretely this requires 
a shared situation, which is itself a "cut" out of the 
lifeworld. Actiona! situations rely upon the world as a 
stock ofwhat is pre-understood and taken for granted. 
In characterizing this horizon Habermas reaches for 
the now familiar notion of Verweisungszusammenhang 
(nexus of indications). But since he understands this 
stock as a linguistically organized reserve of knowl-
edge, as it must be for concrete social interaction, we 
should characterize his notion ofhorizon as a nexus of 
referential entailments. Habermas 's gloss on the dif-
ference between Husserl and Heidegger is to view the 
lifeworld as it functions in human action as a nexus of 
interpretative schemata, linguistically structured and 
culturally mediated, but one that develops through the 
consolidation of difference into settled background be-
liefs, and thus consists primarily of identţficational 
schemata that shape the qualities of social complexes 
and situations.

YUGOSLAVIA 
A glance at the "Bibliogra-
phy of Phenomenology in Yugoslavia" in Analecta 
Husserliana 27 (1988) shows that there is hardly a 
philosophical author in the country who has not writ-
ten one or more articles on phenomenology and that 
there ha ve been a large number of books and articles 
on phenomenology in the last six decades. It is also not 
by chance that severa! world conferences on pheno-
menology have been held in Belgrade, Sarajevo, and 
Dubrovnik and that the most important representatives 
ofthis philosophy have attended. 
The influence ofphenomenological philosophy be-
gan to be felt in Yugoslavia during the mid-1930s. 
EDMUND HUSSERL 's Die Krisis der europiiischen Wis-
senschaften und die transzendentale Phiinomenologie 
( 1936) appeared in the Bel grade joumal Philosophia, 
which was founded and edited by Arthur Lieberth, 
the former editor of Kant-Studien. This followed the 
first extensive review of phenomenological philoso-
phy, Fenomenologija u savremeno nemackoj jilosofiji 
(Phenomenology in contemporary German philosophy, 
1933), by ZAGORKA MICIC who was a student at Freiburg 
under Husserl. 
This work is based on Husserl's Ideen zu einer 
reinen Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen 
Philosophie 1 (1913) and Formale und transzenden-
tale Logik ( 1929), and begins from the premise that as 
the most influential orientation in philosophy, pheno-
menology is, above ali, a method that by delving 
deep into the immediately given, reaches transcen-
dental consciousness as the field of phenomenologi-
cal investigation. Ali phenomenologies, she claims, 
are connected by the application of the method and 
a common ethos, i.e., a strict objectivity that is incon-
ceivable without absolutely scientific consciousness. 
The results of Husserl 's phenomenology are reftected 
in (a) the restoration of the notion of strictly scien-
tific knowledge, (b) the criticism of anthropological 
relativism (skepticism), (c) the focus on the matters 
themselves, and ( d) the discovery of the field of tran-
scendental consciousness as a correlate in which the 
matters themselves can be observed. 
Four years !ater, Micic published Fenomenologija 
Edmunda Husserla (The phenomenology of Ed-
mund Husserl, 1934), her doctoral dissertation writ-
ten at Freiburg under Husserl. This study motivated 
the philosopher and German scholar Momcilo Se-
leskovic ( 1890--1950) to publish his own evaluation of 
phenomenological philosophy, Husserlove tri zablude: 
Povodom jednog prikaza njegove fenomenologije 
(Three errors ofHusserl: On the occasion of a review of 
his phenomenology, 1938), and to conci ude that "what 
Husserl presents as his philosophy are perhaps only a 
collection of purely verbal constructions conditioned, 
for the most part, by the structure of the German lan-
guage." The three errors he finds in Husserl originate 
in a misreading ofthe philosophies of KANT, Descartes, 
and the philosophical foundations ofmathematics. 
Starting from Kant's error that knowledge can be 
explained psychologically, Husserl (a) identifies psy-
chology with the psychology of feeling and draws the 
erroneous conclusion that knowledge cannot be ex-
amined psychologically. (b) Regarding Descartes, Se-
leskovic holds that Husserl erroneously believed that 
there is no epistemologically certain way that leads 
from consciousness to the world, and thus deprived 
human knowledge of ali real content. And (c) due to 
a misunderstanding of mathematics and an incomplete 
criticism of mathematical facts, Husserl deduced cer-
tain logicisms and confused them with the immediate 
givens of consciousness. Seleskovic considers these 
errors to be the result of Husserl's struggle against 
psychologism, and concludes that the philosopher, al-
though he has not revealed new truths, is among those 
who try to think honestly and that his ethos and honesty 
have drawn ali the best philosophical minds to him. 
Although Seleskovic's criticism is mostly a polemic 
with the founder of phenomenology and not with the 
study ofMicic, she felt called upon to reply withKritika 
i saznanje (Criticism and knowledge, 1938), pointing 
to the undeniable positive results of phenomenology. 
(a) Husserl did not claim that psychology cannot ex-
amine and explain knowledge, but that psychological 
explanation and examination of knowledge does not 
solve the question of logic and theory of knowledge. 
(b) Descartes's fundamental position does not mean 
being enclosed in consciousness, and it cannot be said

that phenomenology closes itself up in consciousness 
or that it loses the content of consciousness: conscious-
ness is not a res cogito, but an immediately given fiow 
of awareness of the world. In other words, phenomen-
ology does not remove the content of consciousness 
but takes it as immediately given in experience. (c) 
Seleskovic's third objection, which concems the ex-
istence of numbers, is the consequence of the out-
dated literature he uses ( or a misunderstanding which 
is cleared up when one bears in mind the indefinite-
ness ofthe term "concept" [Begrif/1 in Husserl, whose 
primary intention was to show that the ideal objectiv-
ity of numbers is independent both of counting as a 
psychological function and of our real subjectivity). 
If one had to point out the authors most noted for 
the infiuence of phenomenology in Yugoslavia and the 
forming of an indigenous philosophy in its wake, one 
would have to mention, above ali, the names of ANTE 
PAZANIN and MILAN DAMNYANOVIC. fol!owing his stud-
ies of philosophy at Zagreb, Pazanin went on to study 
at Munster with Joachim Ritter and received his doc-
torate at Ko!n under LUDWIG LANDGREBE with a dis-
sertation entitled Wissenschaft und Geschichte in der 
Phănomenologie Edmund Husserls (Science and his-
tory in the phenomenology ofEdmund Husserl, 1972). 
As a professor for many years and the dean of the 
Faculty of Politica! Sciences at Zagreb for severa! 
terms, Pazanin is largely responsible for phenomen-
ological philosophy becoming deeply rooted there. His 
above-mentioned study ofphenomenology emphasizes 
the transcendentalphenomenological idea of science as 
Husserl established it in "Philosophie als strenge Wis-
senschaft" ( 1911 ). In order to show the possibility of a 
historical foundation of philosophy, Pazanin followed 
this with a presentation of the ways philosophy re-
alizes itself as a science in the form of transcenden-
tal phenomenology. Starting out from severa! already 
charted roads into phenomenology (the Cartesian way, 
the way that leads from ontology, the way from pheno-
menological psychology), he focuses on the notion of 
HISTORY that he finds in Husserl's Krisis. He considers 
this work the high point ofphenomenology, because it 
opens up new fields for philosophy. Pazanin addresses 
the problems ofhistorical totality and how philosophy 
belongs to the world. In this way, he opens the question 
of the "third dimension," i.e., the matter of dialectics, 
which remained alien to Husserl, but emerged despite 
his intention. If, in keeping with EUGEN FINK, Husserl's 
interpretation ofhistory does not differ from that which 
we find in the great "idealist" philosophers of classical 
German philosophy, then it is possible to establish a 
dialogue between HEGEL and Husserl, which led him 
to focus his attention on Husserl 's Vorlesungen zur 
Phănomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins [ 1905). 
At the IVth Colloquium on Phenomenology held 
in Schwăbish-Hall in 1969, Pazanin spoke on "Istina i 
svet zivota kod poznog Husserla" (Truth and the life-
world in the late Husserl), contending that ali the prob-
lems of phenomenology continue tobe current and that 
this either points to solutions or to a level below which 
philosophical thought should not descend. He agrees 
with MARTIN HEIDEGGER that phenomenology should be 
understood not in its actuality, but in its possibility. Our 
task is the historical understanding ofthe being (Sein) 
of TRUTH in the late Husserl, and the realization that 
the Lebenswelt is constantly founded as the basis and 
being of ali truths. It is necessary, he thinks, to answer 
the question of how theoretical truths are founded in 
various forms of human practice. Pazanin furthermore 
insists on a new conception of science. He is conscious 
that phenomenology is a universal science of being; 
that before Husserl there is no such thematization; and 
that it is therefore necessary that each being should be 
encompassed in its truth. 
In this way phenomenology has to pose the question 
on its own about the being ofthe Lebenswelt. The LIFE-
WORLD is understood as an assumption and sphere of its 
own truth. In search of objective knowledge, modern 
science exceeds its mark by following the mathemat-
ical method. It is important to point out that Pazanin 
finds a link between Husserl's criticism of modern ob-
jectivism and Vico's criticism of the Cartesian postu-
lates ofthe world. Husserl's criticism of"physicalistic 
reality" corresponds to Vico's criticism of the one-
sidedness of the modern method that mathematizes 
everything. Both cal! for a study of humanity's histor-
ical world. Thus Pazanin sees Husserl as a thinker of 
human ACTION and finds him as radical as he is revolu-
tionary. Theory assumes a "practice ofhuman survival" 
and Husserl advises human beings to find a way out 
of the crisis in which they finds themselves. It is in 
this re gard that one can understand Pazanin 's growing 
interest in the problems of practica! philosophy and his 
subsequent retum to Aristotle.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
As the translator of severa! of Husserl 's studies and 
editor of a collection of essays -
Fenomenologija 
( 1975), which presents the writings ofthe most impor-
tant representatives of the phenomenological move-
ment -
as well as the author of a number of intro-
ductions, Mi lan Damnjanovic is certainly among those 
who have done the most to make phenomenological 
philosophy one of the strongest orientations in Yu-
goslavia. 
At first, in his introduction to Husserl's "Philoso-
phie als strenge Wissenschaft," which, inspired by 
Landgrebe, he translated into Serbian with his wife, 
Damnjanouvic contends that Husserl abandoned the 
idea of scientificity and departed from Cartesianism. 
Severa! years later, in a 1970 review article on pheno-
menology that is under the direct influence of a new 
reading ofthe Logische Untersuchungen ( 1900-1901 ), 
he places an emphasis on EIDETIC METHOD and so he in-
terprets Husserl's phenomenology as a philosophy of 
essence. It is only in 1975, in his introduction to a col-
lection of essays by the most prominent representatives 
of phenomenology ever published in Yugoslavia, that 
Damnjanouvic stresses the transcendental dimension 
of phenomenology. He points out that although there 
is a great interest and a large number of studies, the 
situation is still an open one, and that after HERBERT 
SPIEGELBERG, it is impossib1e to make a new historical 
survey of phenomenology because Husserl 's students 
and followers are so divergent in their thinking, and 
also because many of Husserl's writings have still to 
be published. According to Damnjanouvic, phenomen-
ology is not only a method, but also a transcenden-
tal phi1osophy. Damnjanouvic's position is influenced 
by Husserl 's Die Idee der Phiinomenologie (1907) in 
which, he holds, one can perceive certain elements that 
then become evident in Husserl's subsequent work. 
Following this, Damnjanovic emphasizes examining 
the question of the unity of philosophy and specific 
sciences in our time. In this way, the question of the 
origin of the sciences and their foundation in the life-
world and the entire problematics of the late Husserl 
are brought to the fore. On the basis of what Husserl 
developed in the Krisis, the basic task of the future 
interpretation of phenomenology would be to establish 
the true meaning of his return to subjectivity and the 
pre-categorial experience ofthe Lebenswelt. 
Along the lines of Husserl and also of Heidegger, 
with the intention of rethinking a philosophy for their 
own time, are DAVOR RODIN and MILADIN ZIVOTIC. Di-
jafektika ifenomenologija (Dialectics and phenomen-
ology, 1979) by Rodin, a professor on the Faculty of 
Politica! Sciences at Zagreb, relates to studies that the-
matize the questions of things and the world in or-
der to arrive, under the influence of Husserl as well 
as Heidegger and through the concept of alienation, 
at the question of the foundation of modern NATURAL 
SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY. Rodin asks if it is possibJe 
to establish a dialogue between speculative dialectics 
and phenomenology, i.e., on the one hand, HEGEL and 
MARX and, on the other hand, Husserl. Rodin considers 
this dialogue to be made possible by the very course 
of historical events but hampered by different kinds 
of philosophical speech, and he concludes that such 
a dialogue requires a "new world." Husserl's CONSTI-
TUTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY and Heidegger's anaJytics of 
DASEIN find themselves in the same position when they 
attempt "to understand and shed light on the human 
situation in the process of the disintegration of tradi-
tional bourgeois subjectivity,"while Marx and Husserl 
ha ve a common point in determin ing the crisis of tradi-
tional bourgeois society. Phenomenology poses some 
very specific questions and gives some quite different 
answers to some traditional philosophical ones. This 
is reflected in the fact that phenomenology now ques-
tions in a new way the MEANING of things, the ori-
gin ofthe world, and the criticism ofpositive science. 
Rodin holds that phenomenology is essentia1 to think-
ing about modernism. To establish a dialogue, a practi-
ca! and a poetica! aspect (and these, accordingto Rodin, 
are lacking in Husserl) are necessary in addition to a 
theoretica! aspect. In this context one should consider 
Miladin Zivotic 's Hajdegerovo shvatanje bica i bitno 
misljenje (Heidegger's conception ofBeing and essen-
tial thinking, 1970), where the criticism ofmetaphysics 
is demonstrated by presenting the complexity of Hei-
degger 's thought before and after the 1949lecture "Die 
Kehre." The results ofthese analyses are tobe found in 
his Egzistencija, realnost i sloboda (Existence, reality, 
and freedom, 1973 ). 
During the 1960s and in the early 1970s, the phi-
losophy of Martin Heidegger had a dominant influ-
ence in Yugoslavia and phenomenological philosophy 
continued to have its effect through his work. One 
of the most important and influential philosophers in 

YUGOSLAVIA 
747 
Yugoslavia in the post-World War II period was GAJO 
PETROVIC, whose series of writings, especially on Hei-
degger, were !ater included in the fourth volume of 
his collected papers, Prolegomena za kritiku Heideg-
gera (Prolegomena to a criticism of Heidegger, 1986). 
These have had a crucial effect on the reception of 
Heidegger's philosophy in Yugoslavia, and on the pro-
ductive encounter between Marx and Heidegger. The 
same direction is taken by DANILO BASTA, who, in the 
early 1980s, points to examples of Heidegger's inter-
pretations of Marx and to the criticism of Heidegger 
by Gyorgy Lukacs (1885-1971 ). Meanwhile, as early 
as the late 1950s, a philosopher from Zagreb, DANILO 
PEJOVIC published a translation ofHeidegger's Der Ur-
sprung des Kunstwerkes (1937), along with severa! 
articles on his philosophy, focusing on the problems 
existential ontology in Realni svet: Temelji ontologije 
Nikolaja Hartmana (The real world: The foundations 
of Nicolai Hartmann 's ontology, 1960). These contri-
butions were especially important for the philosophical 
clima te in Yugoslavia over the last severa! decades. He 
is interested in the who\e fieJd of MODERN PHILOSOPHY 
and seeks support in philosophers with a phenomen-
ological and existential orientation. Gajo Pejovic of-
fers critica! remarks on the philosophy of Heidegger, 
on which he is a world authority. With respect to the 
late Heidegger, he points out that there is a distrust 
in the real forces of historical reversals and that the 
search for Being (Sein) cannot succeed if the search 
for measure and the limit ofhumanity's survival in the 
world are disregarded. Heidegger sees no way out of 
the alienation of our time and in this !ies his lack of 
success in thinking ofBeing. In regard to Heidegger's 
attitude toward National Socialism, a subject on which 
discussions flared up again in the late 1980s, Pejovic 
writes as early as 1957 that one cannot deduce ontic 
prescriptions from ontologica! premises and thereby 
points out that the misunderstandings derive from the 
wrong use ofthe terrn "FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY" on the 
level of the natural attitude. In the case of Heidegger 
himself, problems arise when he attempts to consider 
art through poetry. Pejovic then contends that other 
roads must be taken away from Heidegger, since our 
age already holds the possibility of its own transcen-
dence. 
In his !ater work Pejovic opens the way to ideas 
from phenomenology in FRANCE, especially MAU-
RICE MERLEAU-PONTY, whose work, though unfinished, 
stands before us in its entirety and is therefore unavoid-
ably on the way toward new thinking. MIRKO ZUROVAC 
is also close to Merleau-Ponty in this respect. Heideg-
ger's philosophical work has perhaps had its greatest 
resonance through his radically new relation toward the 
history ofphilosophy. The most critica! attitude toward 
him is manifested by MIHAJLO DJURIC in his analysis of 
Heidegger's interpretations of Nietzsche. Not under 
Djuric 's direct influence, but close to him in his ideas, 
is SLOBODAN ZUNJIC, who is essentially inspired by Hei-
degger to continue a critica! reading ofthe pre-Socratic 
thinkers and Plato. 
It should not be concluded that in this way the in-
fluence of Husserl has been completely eclipsed in 
Yugoslavia. The effect of his thought is particularly 
evident in the fieJds of AESTHETICS and LITERATURE, 
where the phenomenological approach has long led 
other approaches. Hence after the studies of Damn-
janouvic, already mentioned, one should point out the 
German scholar and literary critic ZORAN KONSTANTI-
NOVIC and his important study, Fenomenoloski pristup 
knjiievnom delu (The phenomenological approach to 
the literary work of art, 1969), which has had great in-
fluence. After a consideration ofthe phenomenological 
orientation on the subject and language, and after an 
analysis ofthe idea ofiNTENTIONALITY, this study makes 
a thorough analysis of the beginnings of phenomen-
ology in the Study of art in WALDEMAR CONRAD and 
in the phenomenological contribution to the theory 
of literature in ROMAN INGARDEN. This latter has in-
fluenced DRAGAN STOJANOVIC, who, in Fenomenologija 
i viseznacnost knjiievnog dela: Ingardenova teorija 
opalizacija (Phenomenology and the many-sidedness 
of the literary work: Ingarden's theory of concretiza-
tion, 1976), presents Ingarden's position in order to 
demonstrate the way aesthetic works are concretized 
by analyzing poetic works of Serbian and German lit-
erature. One of the most important Serbian aestheti-
cians, Mirko Zurovac, was under the influence ofboth 
French philosophy (JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, Merleau-Ponty) 
and German (Heidegger, KARL JASPERS). His first two 
books need tobe mentioned: Umjetnost i egzistencija: 
Vrednost i granice Sartrove estetike (Art and exis-
tence: The value and limitations of Sartre's aesthet-
ics, 1978) and Umjetnost kao istina i lai bica (Art as 
the truth and falsehood of being, 1986). In the for-

748 
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
mer, Zurovac sets out from the problem of the begin-
ning of thought and finds a starting point in Husserl 's 
teaching on EVIDENCE. This explains why Husserl sees 
philosophy as an "archaeology ofhuman experience." 
Zurovac sees the road that phenomenology opens up 
and that leads toward the philosophy of existence in 
the fact that phenomenology bears the motives for 
humans to rely on themselves through the transcen-
dental and to make them responsible for their own 
destiny. Taking over from Husserl the notion of the 
intentionality of consciousness and ridding it of sub-
stantialization, Sartre made this notion the basis ofhis 
philosophy. In this way, according to Zurovac, Sartre 
continues Husserl by opposing him. He points out that 
Husserl 's !deen zu einer reinen Phiinomenologie und 
phiinomenologischen Philosophie 1 (1913) in particu-
lar shaped Sartre's position and tends, along the li nes of 
Husserl, to dissolve the real substance ofthe world into 
ontology. In his !ater works, Zurovac emphasizes the 
aesthetic problems in the work of Heidegger, Jaspers, 
and Merleau-Ponty, which he follows by a study ofthe 
relation between art and psychoanalysis in Djetinjstvo 
i zrelost umjetnosti (The childhood and maturity of art, 
1994). 
A return to Husserl's original writings began in the 
mid-1980s. The recently deceased Belgrade philoso-
pher MI O DRAG CEKIC published severa! studies ofpheno-
menology. In Husserlova fenomenoloska methoda 
(Husserl 's phenomenological method, 1985), he ex-
amines the limits ofphenomenologyby thematizing its 
method and points out the importance ofits cognitive-
theoretical dimension. Placing Husserl in the context 
of the European philosophical tradition (Plato, Kant, 
Nietzsche, the neo-Kantians), Cekic emphasizes the 
re]ation between EPOCHE ANO REDUCTION and constitu-
tion and focuses on !deen !. By emphasizing Land-
grebe 's and MAX SCHELER 's reception of Husserl, Cekic 
furthermore reveals the difficulties encountered by an 
immanent critique of the theory of INTERSUBJECTIVITY 
( KLAUS HELD) and concludes that the phenomenological 
way ofreduction and constitution is the road ofhuman 
creation and interpretation ofthe WORLD. The 1ifeworld 
seen from the perspective ofthe development ofmath-
ematical natural science from Galileo to our times is the 
subject of Cekic 's Kriza nauka i svet ii vota (The crisis 
of science and the lifeworld, 1985). The crisis of phi-
losophy as an expression of the crisis of metaphysics 
and modern science, and, thereby, the crisis ofthe idea 
of European humanism, reveals itself as a reftection of 
the division between the worlds of science and of life. 
Philosophy sets out from the age-old subjectivity ofthe 
world of life and is thus made capable of preserving 
its truth; the lifeworld is in this respect the jumping-off 
point for radical self-awareness. Cekic sees transcen-
dental phenomenology as a circular motion from the 
world of life to the world of science and cu! ture and 
back. He concludes that the world oflife and the world 
of science should be considered as one world in which 
these two alternatives oppose and complement each 
other. In Kriticki osvrt na Husserlovufenomenologiju 
(A critica! review of Husserl 's phenomenology, 1986), 
Cekic defines Husserl 's phenomenology as a demon-
stration of the part the subject of knowledge has in 
experiencing and knowing the world. Ifwe find an os-
cillation between ontology and transcendental idealism 
in Husserl, we can see it as a weakness, because the au-
thor does not opt either for the subject or the object, but 
also as a virtue because he does not fali into the trap of 
one-sidedness. The vision of essences (Wesensschau) 
is perhaps the weak point ofphenomenology since it is 
unprovable, but every philosophy has one such point: 
Cekic does not accept Husserl 's ideas about the speci-
ficity of philosophy, which are linked to the fate of 
NATURALISM. In the case of the crisis of cui ture, Cekic 
correctly observes that it is a matter of a crisis of the 
very social foundations of culture, and that the crisis is, 
in fact, an expression of phenomenological thinking. 
He concludes his analysis of Husserl by contending 
that phenomenology is a way ofthinking that appears 
at a time of crisis of culture, science, and humanity, 
and that it should therefore be understood as a return 
to a real, pre-crisis time; in this sense, phenomenology 
is a philosophy oriented toward the past. 
Advocating a return to Husserl in order to find a 
way into new areas ofthought, MILAN UZELAC holds the 
opposite opinion and sees phenomenology as a philos-
ophy oriented toward the future. Starting from Eugen 
Fink's demand that a transition is necessary from on-
tology to cosmology -
and after ali the experience 
contributed by both Heidegger's philosophy and ali 
the thinking that terms itself POSTMODERNISM, as well 
as what comes after the postmodern -
Uzelac is of 
the opinion that a new reading ofHusserl's phenomen-
ology is required. He holds that in Husserl 's writings 

YUGOSLAVIA 
749 
there are many places that unambiguously point to the 
possibility of restructuring a new phenomenological 
aesthetics. 
Therefore, following a fundamental examination 
of Husserl 's philosophical work and its reception by 
modern philosophers, Uzelac attempts, along Husserl 's 
lines, to make explicit the basics of a transcendental 
cosmology that !ies immanently in the foundations of 
phenomenology.
