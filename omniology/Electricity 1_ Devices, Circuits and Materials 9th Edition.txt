PREFACE
The ninth edition of ELECTRICITY 1 has been updated to reflect current materials and tech-
niques in electrical applications, while maintaining the features that have made the text so popular
through previous editions. Summary statements may be found at the end of each unit, and several new
problems have been included in the Achievement Review sections.
ELECTRICITY 1 helps the student achieve a basic understanding of electrical theory and its
application to devices, circuits, and materials. The knowledge obtained by a study of this text permits
the student to progress to further study. The development and the study of the subject of electricity
are continuing processes. The electrical industry constantly introduces new and improved devices and
materials, which in turn often lead to changes in installation techniques. Electrical codes undergo
periodic revisions to upgrade safety and quality in electrical installations.
The text is easy to read and the topics are presented in a logical sequence. The problems pro-
vided in the text require the use of simple algebra for their solutions. The student is advised that elec-
tron movement (from negative to positive) is used in this text to define current direction.
Each unit begins with objectives to alert students to the learning that is expected as a result of
studying the unit. An Achievement Review at the end of each unit tests student understanding to
determine if the objectives have been met. Following selected groups of units (Units 1–9, Units 11–14,
and Units 16–19), a summary review unit contains additional questions and problems to test student
comprehension of a block of information. This combination of reviews is essential to the learning
process required by this text.
All students of electricity will find this text useful, especially those in electrical apprenticeship
programs, trade and technical schools, and various occupational programs.
It is recommended that the most recent edition of the National Electrical Code® (published by the
National Fire Protection Association) be available for reference as the student uses ELECTRICITY 1.
Applicable state and local regulations should also be consulted when making actual installations.
Features of the ninth edition include
•
Sample solutions in several units
•
Challenging problems in the achievement reviews
•
Numerous new problems for student practice
•
Currency with the most recent edition of the National Electrical Code®
•
Up-to-date content based upon suggestions from teachers
•

INTRODUCTION
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• list the areas of work in which the student electrician becomes involved.
• discuss the ethics of and necessary qualifications for the electrical trade.
• describe the educational program, and discuss its values.
When beginning a new program of study, an individual should be thoroughly famil-
iar with the nature of the program and its values and requirements. This is especially
important when the program involves training for a lifelong occupation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE TRADE
The electrical trade is one of the basic trades in the construction industry. It is a trade
in which individual ability and skill are recognized and rewarded. The trade involves the
following areas: electrical installation in new buildings, rewiring old buildings, electri-
cal maintenance and repair, and troubleshooting electrical equipment and installations.
Many of these areas are also basic to the power and electronics fields.
The work involved in all fields often is so closely related to the technical and theo-
retical concepts of electricity that only a trained person can do the job. This is especially
true in the field of electronics. Because more and more electronic equipment is being used,
the electrician is expected to be able to install and maintain this equipment. Therefore, the
electrical apprentice needs to acquire the related technical information.
WORKING CONDITIONS IN THE TRADE
The surroundings and working conditions of the electrical trade are favorable to the
worker. The trade offers opportunities for indoor and outdoor work. Working hours and
conditions of the trade permit the electrical worker to find pleasure in doing a first-class job.
Journeymen on many jobs have the opportunity to deal with customers; therefore, personal
conduct of the experienced worker affects future advancement of the trade and industry.
The electrical trade requires a high degree of responsibility on the part of the trained tech-
nician because this person is responsible for interconnecting and constructing complex
electrical systems. These systems are controlled by state and local building codes and the
National Electrical Code®. As a result, the work requires skilled technicians.

Unit 1 Introduction
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE TRADE
The general public’s interest in building construction at the present time demands a
greater number of highly trained electricians.The modern home, office, and factory require
a higher degree of proficiency in electrical work.The constant increase in new types of con-
struction, new electrical equipment, and new uses for electrical equipment offers increas-
ing employment opportunities for qualified electricians. The ever-increasing use of elec-
tronic equipment in the power field has shown the need for advanced training of electricians.
Technological advances have created new improvements, ideas, and processes. The
apprentice must be familiar with these developments to advance in the electrical profes-
sion. The increased use of this information by the electrician makes the electrical trade
more interesting and desirable. The apprentice can become a first-class journeyman by
understanding new phases of the electrical field. A first-class journeyman can advance
to the position of foreman or contractor. The electrical trade needs individuals with a
complete knowledge of the practical and technical phases of the trade, including those
who can supervise workers on the job.
Some of the fields that offer opportunities are electrical construction, line con-
struction, cable installation, signaling systems, light and power systems, electrical motor
maintenance and repair, equipment and appliance servicing, and industrial electronics.
Due to the increased needs of our society, new opportunities are developing rapidly.
ETHICS OF THE TRADE
Electricians are judged by the quality of their work and by their attitude toward
fellow workers, employers, and the public. A good electrician takes pride in doing high-
quality work and gives an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay. An accurate and
complete job is expected in every activity, including the safe handling of materials
(Figure 1-1). Much work is done alone and unsupervised.
QUALIFICATIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT
Educational
The student should be a high school graduate or equivalent, and should be eager to
learn the skills and technical information necessary for success in the electrical trade.
The student is expected to have a working knowledge of mathematics as this aids in the
understanding of important and necessary electrical formulas.
Physical
A person must be strong enough to perform certain duties because the trade
requires a considerable amount of moving around, climbing, and working under condi-
tions that require muscular action. The student’s general health should be good.

General
The student must like to work with electrical equipment and should be interested in
the general theory of electricity. The student must like to work with others in a cooper-
ative manner. Electricians often work in pairs and also with individuals in other trades.
The trade requires a liking for indoor as well as outdoor work, and a willingness to do a
fair share of manual labor.
VALUE OF APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS
• An apprenticeship is an educational experience.
• An apprentice program provides organized training.
• A controlled apprenticeship brings together the fundamental factors that are
necessary to produce a skilled technician.
• An apprenticeship is a practical and efficient means of training a skilled
technician.
• An apprenticeship program is beneficial for the trainee, employer, union, and
society because all gain from better workmanship.
• Successful electricians profit according to their knowledge and skill. 
Having the highest qualifications possible is an advantage.

Unit 1 Introduction
RESPONSIBILITIES
Educational programs coupled with work experiences provide the student with the
opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skill necessary to become a skilled technician.
It is the trainee’s responsibility to make the most of these opportunities.
Students are expected to take an interest in their work, to have a desire to learn, to
fit into the employer’s organization, to plan and organize their work efficiently, to be
resourceful, and to know how to conserve materials.
The student is further expected to be punctual, to maintain good health, to develop
initiative and leadership, to cooperate in every way, to be neat in personal appearance, and
to practice safe working procedures at all times with appropriate equipment (Figure 1-2).
The student is expected to keep informed regarding new facts, ideas, and proce-
dures of the trade. Because the student is also expected to continue learning while earn-
ing, the trainee must be prepared to attend school to obtain the necessary technical and
related instruction.
THE PROGRAM OF RELATED INSTRUCTION
Generally, an apprenticeship program requires the student to attend classes in related
subjects for a minimum number of hours. The length of the apprenticeship period in the
electrical trade is normally five years. In certain localities, time spent in related instruc-
tion is not classified as work time and is not paid for, whereas in other localities, school
attendance is considered work time so that the student receives pay at the prevailing
wage rate.

safety goggles.

The program of instruction consists of courses based on divisions of work within the
trade, such as residential wiring, commercial wiring, industrial plant wiring, maintenance,
and repair. Each course includes information, such as trade science, trade mathematics,
and trade theory and practice.
If students enter a related instruction program at the time the course is being taught,
they will obtain instruction in the normal manner by attending classes. If the related
instruction course is not being given at the time students enter the program, this infor-
mation must be acquired through self-study, under the supervision of and with the assis-
tance of the instructor. Students are expected to provide their own materials, such as
textbooks, notebooks, and workbooks, as advised by the instructor.
SUMMARY
Electricians and electrical workers of all types are in great demand today. The pay
is directly related to the knowledge and skill of the workers, and their ability to keep
up with the changes in the industry. A solid understanding of electrical concepts is
essential. Apprenticeship programs are found in most communities across the country,
along with opportunities for related instruction at local schools and community tech-
nical colleges.

ELECTRON THEORY AND
OHM’S LAW
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• list the fundamental properties of matter.
• describe the structure of an atom. 
• explain the basic electrical concepts of current, voltage, resistance, and electrical
polarity.
• define Ohm’s law.
MATTER
Anything that occupies space and has weight is called matter. All liquids, gases,
and solids are examples of matter in different forms. Matter is made up of smaller units
called atoms.
ATOMS
An atom resembles the solar system with the sun as the center around which a series
of planets revolve, as shown in Figure 2-1. In the atom, there is a relatively large mass at
the center called the nucleus. Electrons revolve in orbital patterns around the nucleus.

Unit 2 Electron Theory and Ohm’s Law
ELECTRICAL CHARGE
A material is said to have an electrical charge when it attracts or repels another
charged material. A material may have either a positive or a negative electrical charge.
Two objects with positive charges repel each other. Two objects with negative charges
also repel each other. Two objects with unlike charges attract each other.
PROTONS AND NEUTRONS
Part of the nucleus of an atom is made up of protons. Each proton has a positive elec-
trical charge and attracts electrons; neutrons form the remainder of the nucleus. Neutrons
are electrically neutral. They can neither attract nor repel other electrical charges.
ELECTRONS
One or more electrons revolve continuously around the nucleus of an atom (just as
the planets revolve about the sun). Electrons possess a negative electrical charge and are
very much lighter in weight than protons. All electrons are alike regardless of the atoms
of which they are a part. An atom contains the same number of electrons as protons. For
example, the aluminum atom has thirteen electrons and thirteen protons.
CURRENT
Electrons in motion result in an electrical current. Copper wire is often used
to carry electrical current (moving electrons). For each atom of copper in the wire, elec-
trons are revolving around the nucleus. When electrical pressure (voltage) from a battery
or generator is applied, it is possible to force these electrons out of their circular paths
and cause them to pass from atom to atom along the length of the wire (conductor).
The greater the number of electrons passing a given point in a circuit, the greater the
intensity of the current. The intensity of an electrical current is measured in amperes (A).
The instrument used to measure current is called an ammeter as shown in Figure 2-2. An
ammeter must be connected in series with other devices in a circuit. The letter “I” is used
to represent the amount of current in a circuit.
Current Types
The following three types of current are shown in Figure 2-3:
• Direct current (DC) is the movement of electrons in one direction in a conductor.
• Pulsating direct current is a current in one direction that varies in intensity at a
regular interval of time.
• Alternating current (AC) is a current that changes in direction and intensity at a
regular interval of time.

Unit 2 Electron Theory and Ohm’s Law
VOLTAGE
A closed circuit and a source of electrical pressure are necessary to produce an elec-
trical current. Electrical pressure, known as voltage, or potential difference, is obtained
from many sources. Generators are widely used for high-powered AC and DC installa-
tions. Storage batteries are used extensively for DC power in automobiles and aircraft.
Photoelectric cells convert light energy into electrical energy. These cells are used as
voltage sources in light-operated devices. A thermocouple, which consists of a junction
of two unlike metals, generates a low voltage when heated. Of all the voltage sources
mentioned, the generator is most commonly used because of its suitability for commer-
cial and residential applications.
The letter “E” is used to represent a voltage. The volt (V) is the unit used to express
the quantity of electrical pressure. The instrument used to measure voltage is the
voltmeter. The voltmeter must be connected in parallel with the load to be measured.

ELECTRICAL POLARITY
All DC sources of electrical pressure have two terminals to which electrical devices
are connected. These terminals have electrical polarity. One terminal is the positive ter-
minal, whereas the other is the negative terminal. Electrons flow through the device from
the negative terminal of the source to the positive terminal of the source. The source
maintains a supply of electrons on its negative terminal.
RESISTANCE
The property of a material that causes it to oppose the movement of electrons is
called resistance. All materials have some resistance. Materials that offer little resistance
to electron movement are called conductors. Those that offer high resistance are called
nonconductors or insulators.
Resistance is measured in ohms. The symbol for ohms is the Greek letter omega,
Ω. This symbol, representing ohms, and the letter “R,” representing resistance, are used
in formulas. The instrument used to measure resistance is called an ohmmeter. Electrical
power must be disconnected in a circuit when using an ohmmeter. The meter shown in
Figure 2-4 is commonly used to measure resistance, voltage, and current.

OHM’S LAW
It is extremely important to understand the methods used to control the amount of
current in a circuit. A simple formula, Ohm’s law, is used to show the relationship of cur-
rent, voltage, and resistance. Ohm’s law states that in any electrical circuit, the current is
directly proportional to the voltage applied to the circuit and is inversely proportional to
the resistance in the circuit. Note that both resistance and voltage affect the current.
According to Ohm’s law, when the resistance of a circuit is constant, the current can
be changed by changing the voltage: current will increase when the voltage is increased,
and current will decrease when the voltage is decreased. Similarly, when the voltage is
constant, current will increase when the resistance is decreased, and current will decrease
when resistance is increased.
The exact relationship of voltage, current, and resistance is expressed by the equa-
tion for Ohm’s law:
Where
I
= intensity of current in amperes
E
= quantity of electrical pressure in volts
R
= amount of resistance in ohms
Two other forms of Ohm’s law follow:
Example: If a voltage of 24 volts appears across a resistance of 4 ohms, find the
current through the resistance.
Example: Find the voltage that appears across an 8-ohm resistance if the current
through it is 10 amperes.
E = IR = (10 amperes) (8 Ω) = 80 volts
SUMMARY
Ohm’s law is the basic formula for understanding electrical fundamentals. The rela-
tionships among current, voltage, and resistance provide a foundation for understanding
various types of electrical circuits and systems. Current is the movement of electrons.

SERIES CIRCUITS
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• describe the basic relationships of voltage, current, and resistance in a series circuit.
• apply Ohm’s law to determine unknown quantities.
Knowing certain basic rules in the operation of series, parallel, and series-parallel
circuits is important in developing a facility for locating faults in electrical equipment.
Understanding electrical problems is, in
fact, impossible without this knowledge.
A series circuit is one in which
devices are connected so that there is only
one path for current. The direction of the
current in the wire is the same as the direc-
tion of electron movement. Figure 3-1 illus-
trates three lamps connected in a series with
a voltage source.
VOLTAGE
The total voltage applied to a series
circuit is distributed across the various
components of the circuit in a series of volt-
age drops.
The three equal resistors shown in
Figure 3-2 are connected in series. The volt-
age across each component is equal to one-
third of the total voltage. In Figure 3-3, the
voltage across each resistor is proportional
to the resistance. The higher the resistance,
the greater the voltage drop in a series
circuit.

Unit 3 Series Circuits
As shown in the previous figures, the sum of the voltages across the individual
devices is equal to the total applied voltage. This leads to the following important rule
for a series circuit:
The sum of the voltage drops across individual resistors
in a series circuit is equal to the total applied voltage. In
other words,
ET = El + E2 + E3 + . . . + En
CURRENT
Because only one path for current exists, the current through all components in the
circuit is the same. This statement can be expressed as
IT = Il = I2 = I3 = In
Where
IT
= total current
Il
= current through component 1
I2
= current through component 2
I3
= current through component 3
In
= current through nth component
Therefore,

RESISTANCE
The total resistance of a series circuit is equal to the sum of resistances of all resis-
tors in the circuit. The total resistance in Figure 3-1 is the resistance from terminal A to

Example: The total resistance for Figure 3-3 is RT = R1 + R2.
RT = 4 Ω+ 12 Ω= 16 Ω
An alternate path of very low resistance in a circuit is called a short circuit
(Figure 3-6). For example, if the two wires leading to a lamp come in contact with each
other, a path of practically zero
resistance is formed. When
this happens, there is a very
large current in the wires lead-
ing to the place of contact, and
the wires will overheat.
An open circuit occurs
when some part of a circuit is
either open, such as a switch,
or malfunctioning, such as a
burned-out fuse or a broken

accounted for. If a voltmeter is used at an open point in a circuit, it will indicate the
source voltage.

El = ITR1 = (20)(2) = 40 volts
E2 = ITR2 = (20)(3) = 60 volts
E3 = ITR3 = (20)(7) = 140 volts
Note that the sum of the voltage drops is equal to the total voltage.
El + E2 + E3 = ET
40 + 60 + 140 = 240 volts
Example: Find the total current for the circuit shown in Figure 3-8.
RT = R1 + R2 + R3

SUMMARY
A series circuit means that the resistive loads are connected one after another. In
this type of circuit, the current is the same in all parts of the circuit. To determine the cur-
rent, the total resistance must first be calculated. The total resistance is the sum of all the
resistances in the circuit. The current is then the supplied voltage divided by the total
resistance.

PARALLEL CIRCUITS
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• describe the characteristics of parallel circuits.
• demonstrate a procedure for solving parallel circuit problems.
Because of their unique characteristics, parallel circuits are more widely used than
any other type of circuit. The distribution of power in a large city is accomplished by a
maze of feeder lines all connected in parallel. A parallel circuit has more than one path
for current.
VOLTAGE
The circuit shown in Figure 4-1 is an
example of a simple parallel circuit. Note that
each resistor is placed directly across the main
source of voltage. This causes each resistor to
operate at the same voltage as the source. An
electrical component should never be placed in
a parallel circuit if it has a voltage rating less
than the source voltage.
The fact that all components in a parallel circuit operate at the same voltage is
expressed by the following equation:
ET = E1 = E2 = E3 = En
Where
ET
= total voltage
E1
= voltage across component 1
E2
= voltage across component 2
E3
= voltage across component 3
En
= voltage across nth component

Unit 4 Parallel Circuits
CURRENT
The components in a parallel circuit operate independently of one another. Each
component takes current in accordance with its resistance. The number of separate paths
for current is equal to the number of components in parallel. The total current in a par-
allel circuit is equal to the sum of the currents in the separate components. The equation
that expresses this statement follows:
IT = I1 + I2 + I3 . . . + In
Where
IT
= total current
I1
= current through component 1
I2
= current through component 2
I3
= current through component 3
In
= current through nth component
RESISTANCE
It is apparent from studying the previous equation
that adding more parallel branches to the circuit will
increase the total current. Ohm’s law (RT = ET/IT) shows
that the total circuit resistance decreases as current
increases in parallel circuits. Therefore, adding parallel
branches results in a decrease in total resistance.
RT will always be less than the smallest R in the
circuit when two or more resistors are present.
Equal Resistors
As seen in Figure 4-3, in a parallel circuit that con-
sists of devices with equal resistance, the total circuit
resistance is numerically equal to the resistance value of
Figure 4-2 DC-AC clamp-on
ammeter. (Courtesy of Advanced
Test Products)

one device divided by the number of devices connected in parallel. Expressed as an
equation, this statement becomes
Where
RT
= total resistance in ohms
R
= resistance of one of the equal valued resistors in ohms
N
= number of parallel resistors
Unequal Resistance
In practice, parallel circuits with resistors that have unequal values are more fre-
quently used than parallel circuits with resistors that have equal values. No simple rule
applies in this case because each resistor takes a different value of current for the same
applied voltage.
To find the total resistance of a parallel circuit, apply a known source voltage to the
circuit and determine the total current. Ohm’s law is then used to find the total resistance.
Where
RT
= total circuit resistance in ohms
ET
= total voltage in volts
IT
= total current in amperes
The total circuit resistance also can be found by using the following formula. This
formula may be applied to any parallel circuit with any number of parallel branches.
Known as the “reciprocal” formula, it is expressed as
Where
RT
= total resistance

= resistance of resistor 2

Solving for RT

An alternate solution to this problem is as follows:

A simple method of solving circuits consisting of only two resistors in parallel
(with either equal or unequal values) is called the “product over the sum” method.
Example: A 3-ohm resistor and a 6-ohm resistor are connected in parallel.
Determine their combined resistance.

branch, but the current may not be the same in each branch. The current is determined
by the amount of resistance in the branch. If the branch currents are added together, the
sum is the total current.

SERIES-PARALLEL CIRCUITS
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• explain the characteristics of series-parallel circuits.
• demonstrate a procedure for solving problems involving series-parallel circuits.
Combining series and parallel circuits is often necessary to meet electrical require-
ments and to group devices in a load circuit to obtain a particular value of resistance.
Grouping devices in series-parallel
circuits is also necessary in control
circuits for auditorium and stage light-
ing as well as for motor control. In
many instances, it is desirable to group
voltage sources, particularly batteries,
to obtain the correct voltage and current
capacity.
The circuit shown in Figure 5-1 is
an example of a series-parallel circuit.
In this circuit, lamps L1 and L2 consti-
tute a parallel circuit. The rheostat R,
used to control the current in this
circuit, is in series with L1 and L2 as a
group.
Figure 5-2 illustrates another
series-parallel circuit. Resistors R1 and
R2 are in parallel with respect to each
other. Resistors R3 and R4 constitute
another parallel combination. The par-
allel combination of R1 and R2 is in
series with the parallel combination of
R3 and R4.
In Figure 5-3, the resistors are
grouped in another type of series-parallel

CIRCUIT SOLUTION
After the total resistance of a circuit is found, the total current, as well as the
current in other parts of the circuit, can be determined according to Ohm’s law. In
Figure 5-6, the equivalent resistance of the parallel resistors R2 and R3 is 12 ohms.
Therefore, Figure 5-7 is the series circuit equivalent of Figure 5-6, and the total

circuit. In this circuit, R1 and R3 are in series, and R2 and R4 are in series. The two series
branches are then in parallel.
EQUIVALENT CIRCUITS
The methods used to determine current, voltage, and resistance for series and par-
allel circuits apply to combination circuits as well. Solving problems in series-parallel
circuits is made easier by resolving these circuits into equivalent circuits.
Figure 5-4 is equivalent to Figure 5-3. In this case, R1 and R3 are combined as a
single resistance RA, equal in value to the sum of R1 and R3. Similarly, RB replaces
R2 and R4. RA and RB then may be combined into one resistor, RC, to result in the
final equivalent circuit of Figure 5-5. The total current in the original series parallel
circuit, Figure 5-3, is equal to the current in the simple series circuit of Figure 5-5.

SUMMARY
In a simple series-parallel circuit, the total currrent is equal to the sum of the branch
currents. This current passes through the resistances that are in series with the voltage
source. The total current may also be computed by changing the series-parallel circuit into
a series circuit. The resistances of the branches may be converted into a single resistance.
This resistance is then in series with the other resistances in the circuit, and the total resist-
ance is the sum. By using Ohm’s law, the total current can be calculated.

ELECTRICAL ENERGY
AND POWER
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• discuss the relationship of work to power.
• apply the power and energy concepts to practical problems.
To ensure proper operation, all electrical equipment is rated by the manufacturer.
That is, the voltage and kind of current required are usually specified on the nameplate
of the component. This information allows the consumer to compute the cost of opera-
tion before a purchase is made. A generator, for example, is rated for electrical power
output. Damage to the generator results from operation at outputs in excess of this rat-
ing. An electrician cannot install an electric motor and expect it to operate properly and
safely, unless the horsepower requirements of the load are known. It is necessary to
understand the exact meaning of all types of electrical ratings.
WORK
For an object to move, some force must make it move. When electrons flow in a
circuit, a force must make them flow. A force produces or tends to produce motion or
change in motion. Energy is the ability to do work. Therefore, when work is accom-
plished, energy is used or consumed.
If a weight is to be lifted, work is required. The unit of work is the foot-pound
(ft.lb), which is the amount of work accomplished when a weight of 1 pound is lifted
vertically 1 foot, or when a force of 1 pound acts through a distance of 1 foot. The
amount of work done, measured in foot-pounds, is equal to the force in pounds multi-
plied by the distance in feet, or
Work = Force × Distance
If a 2-pound weight is lifted a distance of 3 feet, the work done is equal to 2 × 3, or
6 foot-pounds.
Work is not a function of time. An elevator motor does essentially the same amount
of work in speeding a car to the top of a building as it does in having it rise slowly.
41

42
Unit 6 Electrical Energy and Power
Although the work is nearly the same, the motor must be much more powerful in the first
instance than in the second. 
POWER
Power is the rate of doing work. The faster a given amount of work is accom-
plished, the greater the power required. If a 2-pound weight is raised 3 feet in 1 minute,
more power is required than if the same weight were raised 3 feet in 5 minutes.
Mechanical power is often expressed in foot-pounds per minute            :
A commonly used unit of power is horsepower (hp):
The watt (W) is used as the unit of electrical power. The instrument used to meas-
ure power is the wattmeter (Figure 6-1). When 1 ampere exists in a circuit due to a
1 horsepower (hp) = 33,000 foot-pounds

source of 1 volt, 1 watt of power is used in that circuit. In DC circuits, the electrical
power in watts can always be found by any of the following formulas in which I repre-
sents the number of amperes, R is the number of ohms, and E is the number of volts:
The kilowatt (kW) is a commonly used unit of electrical power. 1 kilowatt is equal to
1,000 watts.
The energy consumed in electrical circuits is measured in watt-hours (Wh).
When 1 watt is used for 1 hour, the amount of energy consumed is 1 watt-hour. The
kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1,000 watt-hours. In other words, a kilowatt-hour is the
energy consumed when 1 kilowatt is used for 1 hour. When you pay an electric bill for
your home, you are paying for the energy used, not power. The consumed energy is
measured with an instrument called a watt-hour meter.
A simple formula can be used to determine the cost of the energy consumed:
or  
Cost of Energy Used = Kilowatt-Hours Used × Dollars/kWh
That is,  
Cost = kWh × Dollars/kWh
Determine the cost of operating a television set for 6 hours. The set is rated at
150 watts, and the cost of energy is at the rate of 5 cents per kWh.
Electrical power can be changed to mechanical power by an electric motor. If
exactly as much power could be delivered by the motor as is supplied to it, then for each
746 watts of electrical power supplied to the motor, 1 horsepower of mechanical power
would be delivered.
746 watts = 1 horsepower
Actually, a motor is not 100 percent efficient. The power delivered is never equal
to the power supplied. Some losses always occur due to internal motor resistance, bear-
ing friction, and air friction. The power supplied to the motor must be greater than the
power delivered to provide for these losses.

SUMMARY
Energy is the ability to do work. When work is accomplished during a period of time,
power is created. Electrical power is similar to mechanical power. When a lightbulb indi-
cates 60 watts, it means that it takes 60 watts of power to make it light up. One horsepower
of mechanical power is equal to 746 watts of electrical power.
When we buy energy from a power company, the unit of energy we pay for is in
watt-hours. That is, we pay for the power for a period of time (watts times hours). The
power company sells energy in kilowatt-hours.

BATTERIES
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• describe the electrical characteristics of lead-acid storage cells.
• demonstrate how to test and charge storage batteries.
• list the most important aspects of storage battery maintenance.
Millions of batteries are used in America for automobiles, aircraft, portable lights,
and emergency power installations. The ability to install, test, charge, and maintain stor-
age batteries is an important asset to any well-qualified apprentice electrician.
CELLS
The basic unit of the battery is the cell (Figure 7-1). A battery is usually a group of
separate cells connected in series. The number of cells used depends on the total volt-
age required.

50
Unit 7 Batteries
Primary cells and secondary cells are types of cells widely used in the electrical field.
Primary cells are commonly known as dry cells. This type can be used only once. When
discharged, they are commonly discarded. The secondary or storage-type cell, when dis-
charged, can be recharged by passing direct current through it in the proper direction.
Two common types of storage cells are the nickel-cadmium cell and the lead-acid
cell. The lead-acid cell is used extensively.
TRADITIONAL BATTERIES
The internal features of the traditional lead-acid battery are shown in Figure 7-2.
Two groups of coated lead plates, known as electrodes, are immersed in a dilute solution
of sulfuric acid known as the electrolyte. One group of plates forms the positive elec-
trode, whereas the other forms the negative electrode. Glass, rubber, or other insulating
materials are used as separators to keep these electrodes from making contact. Each cell
container is provided with a vent and vent cap. These devices permit gases to leave the
cell while charging and the addition of distilled water that is lost by evaporation and dur-
ing charging.

MAINTENANCE-FREE BATTERIES
Figure 7-3 illustrates a modern maintenance-free battery. This type of battery does
not require the periodic addition of water to the electrolyte solution because of its design.
An electrolyte reservoir eliminates the need for additional water, which is a feature
not found in the traditional battery. The maintenance-free battery may be purchased with
terminals located on the top or side to satisfy a variety of installation requirements.

BATTERY RATINGS
Storage batteries are rated for voltage and ampere-hour capacity. When each cell of
a lead-acid storage battery is rated at 2.0 volts, with three cells connected in series (pos-
itive to negative), the total voltage of the battery is 6.0 volts. Higher voltage batteries
contain more cells.
The current supplied by a storage battery depends on its voltage, physical condi-
tion, and the resistance of the load circuit.
The maximum current output is limited by the internal resistance of the cell. This
resistance is determined by the condition of the electrolyte, the size of the plates, and the
number of plates. Generally speaking, a larger cell is capable of supplying a higher cur-
rent than a smaller cell. The voltage of a cell, however, is not dependent on the size or
number of plates.
AMPERE-HOUR RATING
The time required to discharge a storage battery at a given load current is deter-
mined by its ampere-hour capacity. The ampere-hour rating is a measure of the total
electrical energy the battery can deliver. The ampere-hour rating is a function of the size
and number of plates in a battery. In general, a large battery has a high ampere-hour
rating.
A battery rated at 100 ampere-hours will completely discharge in 100 hours at a
rate of 1 ampere per hour, or in 50 hours at a rate of 2 amperes per hour. The number of

Unit 7 Batteries
hours a battery will last at a given load current can be determined from the following
formula for ampere-hour capacity:
For example, how long will a fully charged battery deliver 10 amperes if it is rated
at 60 ampere-hours?
STATE OF CHARGE
Discharging a lead-acid battery completely before recharging it is poor practice. A
battery should be charged whenever its condition drops below the normal value. The
condition of a battery, referred to as its state of charge, is measured by taking a reading
of its specific gravity with a battery hydrometer. The student should have at least a
general knowledge of the meaning of specific gravity to test a storage battery.
Specific Gravity
Specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a volume of substance to the weight of
an equal volume of fresh water. The equation that expresses this statement follows:
For example, a pint of concentrated sulfuric acid weighs approximately 1.84 pounds.
A pint of fresh water weighs approximately 1 pound. The specific gravity is determined
as follows:
The important part of a hydrometer, the instrument used to measure specific gravity,
is the float on which a scale of specific gravities is marked. The float sinks in a liquid to
a certain level, depending on the specific gravity. The lower the float sinks, the smaller
the value of specific gravity. Therefore, in sulfuric acid, the float will sink until the sur-
face of the liquid is at the 1.84 value.
Specific Gravity = 1.84

LEAD-CELL ACTION
The liquid electrolyte in a fully charged storage cell is made up of sulfuric acid and
water. When a cell discharges, acid leaves the electrolyte and combines with lead on the
plates. As a result, the electrolyte becomes less dense and lower in specific gravity.
The specific gravity of a fully charged cell is approximately 1.28. A normally dis-
charged cell has a specific gravity of 1.15. The decimal point is commonly omitted for
convenience. Therefore, the numbers in this paragraph are usually referred to as 1,280
and 1,150.
BATTERY TESTING
The state of charge for a traditional battery is usually measured by opening a vent
plug of the cell and drawing electrolyte into the barrel of the hydrometer (Figure 7-4).
For maintenance-free batteries, the manifold cap is removed for hydrometer testing. The
scale reading on the float at the level of the liquid is the specific gravity reading.
53
Unit 7 Batteries
Figure 7-4  Hydrometer.
A battery can also be tested with a high-current discharge tester. This is simply an
ammeter combined with a load circuit. A high reading indicates a fully charged battery,
and a low reading indicates a need for charging. The ammeter in this instrument is usu-
ally calibrated in terms of the state of charge.
BATTERY CHARGING
A battery used for emergency power should be charged once a month or whenever
its specific gravity falls to 1,150. Low specific gravity readings result from normal dis-
charge or because the battery has been allowed to remain inactive. Completely discharged

54
Unit 7 Batteries
batteries must be recharged immediately. A permanent reduction of the ampere-hour
capacity, due to hardening of chemicals on both electrodes, results from letting the bat-
tery stand discharged.
Charging Rate
The normal charging rate, in general, is the current specified on the nameplate or
in the manufacturer’s literature. For a quick charge, a current value a few times higher
than the normal value can be used if the temperature of the electrolyte is kept below
110°F.
Charging Current
Either DC or pulsating DC may be used to charge batteries. In either case, the direc-
tion of the charging current (electron movement) must be opposite to the current during
discharge as shown in Figure 7-5(A). A charging current is produced by connecting the
battery to a charger with electrical polarities as marked in Figure 7-5(B).

_
The charging rate depends on the voltage difference between the battery voltage
and the voltage of the charging source. In all instances, the voltage of the charger must
be greater than the total battery voltage. If the charger voltage were lower than the bat-
tery voltage, the battery would discharge by driving electrons through the charger.
In engine-driven vehicles, batteries are charged by an alternator that is mounted in
the vehicle. When a high-voltage DC supply is available, batteries may be charged
directly from the source by using suitable current-limiting circuitry. When an AC supply
is used, the voltage must be rectified, that is, changed to DC before being applied to the
battery.

Charging Systems
Battery chargers operate on the constant-current or constant-potential system. In
the constant-current system, the charging rate remains the same regardless of battery
condition.
In a constant-potential system, the voltage of the charger is held constant at a value
slightly above the battery voltage. As the battery charges, its voltage increases slightly,
thus reducing the voltage differential between the battery and charger. The result is a
high charging rate in the beginning and a low charging rate near the finish, in other
words, a tapering charge. This is very desirable because the charging rate is dependent
on battery condition.
BATTERY MAINTENANCE
The life of a lead-acid storage battery depends on the use to which it is put and on
the care it receives. With good care, it will last several years; with little or no care, it may
be ruined in a month. The important rules for battery care are as follows:
1.
Test storage batteries periodically. Always wear eye and clothing protection to
shield yourself from battery acid.
2.
If a battery is completely discharged, recharge it immediately.
3.
When charging a battery, select a charging rate consistent with the time available
for charging. When time is available, use the normal rate indicated in the product
manufacturer’s literature.
4.
If it is necessary to charge a battery at a very high rate, keep a careful check on the
temperature of the electrolyte and never let it exceed 110°F. If cells release gas
freely, reduce the charging rate to the normal rate.
5.
Never try to charge batteries to a definite specific gravity. Maintain the charge
until the same specific gravity reading is indicated at three successive half-hour
intervals.
6.
By the regular addition of distilled water only, maintain the level of the electrolyte
above the top of the separators according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
Rapid deterioration of a battery will result if the electrolyte level is allowed to
remain below the top of the separators. Usually, maintenance-free batteries do not
require the addition of water.
7.
Add distilled water immediately before recharging a lead-acid battery. In the pro-
cess of charging a traditional battery, the water in the electrolyte is changed into
hydrogen gas and oxygen gas that escape through the vent holes. This water must
be restored so that the level of the electrolyte is maintained. Maintenance-free bat-
teries do not experience this electrolyte loss.
55
Unit 7 Batteries

8.
Never use a match to provide light when checking the electrolyte level. Hydrogen
and oxygen mixed together are highly volatile. The area used for recharging
must be well ventilated.
9.
Never disconnect the leads to a battery while it is on charge. The spark that
occurs at the terminals may ignite the gas and cause an explosion. Many times,
a battery is to be charged while permanently mounted in position, such as in an
automobile, where the negative terminal may be connected to a frame or an engine.
To reduce the chance of an explosion, the negative lead of the charger should
be connected to the frame instead of to the terminal.
10. Never take a specific gravity reading just after adding distilled water to a battery.
Addition of distilled water dilutes the electrolyte and lowers the specific gravity.
A reading then would indicate a state of charge below the actual condition of the
battery.
11.
Avoid spilling electrolyte when testing a battery with a hydrometer.
12. Never add acid or electrolyte to a battery unless it has been definitely determined
that some electrolyte has been lost. If it is ever necessary to prepare electrolyte,
remember that acid must be added to water, and must be added slowly.
13. When placing a battery on charge, do not remove the vent plugs. The plugs prevent
acid spray from reaching the top surface of the battery and allow the gases to escape
as noted in number 7 previously.
14. Remove deposits that may form on the terminals of a storage battery so that the
metal will not be eaten away. The presence of a greenish-white deposit on battery
terminals indicates corrosion. Remove this material by thoroughly cleaning the
affected parts with a wire brush. Apply a strong solution of baking soda and water
to all corroded parts to neutralize any acid that remains. Wash the battery with fresh
water and dry with compressed air or a cloth. Finally, coat the terminals with petro-
leum jelly or other suitable material.
15. Do not draw a heavy discharge current except for short intervals of time. If high
current is needed for a long period, use additional batteries connected in parallel.
16. Test storage batteries more frequently in very cold weather than in warm weather.
A discharged battery freezes easily.
SUMMARY
Numerous types of batteries are used today to run toys, audio equipment, lights, hear-
ing aids, and so on. This unit focuses on storage batteries, which are used to fill in for com-
mercial power systems in emergency situations in industrial settings. For this purpose, a
bank of batteries is used as shown in Figure 7-6. Storage batteries need to be checked regu-
larly and maintained properly. The key to a storage battery’s readiness is the specific grav-
ity, not the terminal voltage. Batteries must be fully charged and ready to operate at all times.

ELECTRICAL CONDUCTORS
AND WIRE SIZES
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• describe the factors that determine the resistance of a conductor.
• use the wire gauge tables.
All electrical power is distributed by a system of conductors.The selection and instal-
lation of conductors is, therefore, an important practical phase of any electrician’s work.
TOTAL CIRCUIT RESISTANCE
It is important to know the factors that contribute to the total resistance of a circuit
and the part that conductors contribute to this total.
In any circuit, five factors contribute to the total circuit resistance:
1. The number and type of components acting as the load circuit.
2. The type of circuit arrangement of these components.
3. The resistance of switching and control components.
4. The resistance of conductors carrying power to the components from the source.

Unit 8 Electrical Conductors and Wire Sizes
When the resistance of the load circuit is very low, the resistance of the conductors
may become an appreciable part of the total circuit resistance. The large conductors used
in the starter motor circuit of an automobile are necessary because of the low resistance
of the load circuit.
Part of the total voltage applied to a load exists across the conductor. It is always
desirable to keep this voltage drop as small as possible. The selection of the proper wire
size is often a compromise between the permissible voltage drop and the cost of installing
conductors that would yield a lower voltage drop.
CONDUCTOR RESISTANCE
The resistance of a conductor depends on
• the type of material used for the conductor, such as copper or aluminum.
• the length of the conductor.
• the cross-sectional area of the conductor.
• the temperature of the conductor.
Material
Silver is the best conductor of electricity, but it is seldom used because of its cost.
Copper is almost as good a conductor as silver, is relatively inexpensive, and is adequate
for most types of wiring. Aluminum is used where lightness of weight is an important
factor. Alloys of copper and various other metals are widely used in the construction of
heating elements and for other electrical devices.
Length
The resistance of any conductor is directly proportional to its length. In a particu-
lar wire, 2 feet have twice as much resistance as 1 foot; 3 feet have three times the resist-
ance of 1 foot.
Cross-Sectional Area
Cross-sectional area (CSA) is the area of a section
cut through an object. The CSA of a wire is the amount
of surface on the end of a wire cut at right angles to the
axis of the wire. In Figure 8-2, the shaded section is the
cross-sectional area.
The larger the conductor, the lower the resistance
and the easier it is to pass current. In more precise
CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA
(CSA)

terms, the resistance of a conductor is inversely propor-
tional to its CSA.
Ordinarily, the CSA is expressed in square inches.
For wires, however, the circular mil is the standard unit
of area. A circular mil is the CSA of a wire 1/1,000
(0.001) inch in diameter as shown in Figure 8-3. 
The length of a piece of wire 1 circular mil in CSA
and 1 foot long is called a mil-foot. At 68°F, the resistance of a mil-foot of copper wire
is approximately 10.4 ohms. However, at 167°F, the resistance is 12.6 ohms.
The CSA of any conductor, expressed in circular mils, can be found by deter-
mining the diameter of the wire in thousandths of an inch (mils) and squaring this
number.
Example: Find the CSA in circular mils of a wire 1/100 inch in diameter.
1/100 inch = 0.010 inch
0.010 inch = 10 mils
(10)2 = 100 circular mils
If the CSA of a wire is known in circular mils, the diameter can be determined
easily.
Example: Find the diameter in inches of a wire with a CSA of 100 circular mils.
10 mils = 0.010 inch = 1/100 inch
Conductor sizes are expressed by American Wire Gauge (AWG) numbers or kcmil
as shown in Figure 8-4. The term kcmil means “thousand circular mils.” Large conduc-
tors are sized using kcmil. For example, a 250,000 circular mil conductor is designated
250 kcmil. Observe from Figure 8-4 that 1,000 feet of No. 10 wire has a resistance of
1.21 ohms. Also note that for every third gauge (e.g., from 3 to 6), the wire halves in
CSA and doubles in resistance.
The resistance of a wire is directly proportional to its length and inversely propor-
tional to its CSA. This information can be written as a formula:

Temperature
The resistance of a circuit or conductor is usually constant and does not depend
upon either current or voltage. However, if the current is excessive, the temperature
may rise and cause an increase in resistance. When the filament of an incandescent
lamp is hot, it has a much higher resistance than when it is cold. Carbon is an excep-
tion to this statement because its resistance decreases as the temperature increases.
Certain alloys, such as manganin, maintain nearly constant resistance through wide
variations in temperature.
Current through a conductor causes the production of heat within the conductor.
The resultant rise in temperature sets a limit on the amount of current that can be passed
through a conductor. The resistance of a conductor also varies if there is a variation in
the temperature of the environment surrounding the conductor. For copper, if the tem-
perature increases, the resistance will increase.
The heat produced within a conductor radiates into space or is conducted away by
materials in contact with the wire. If heat is produced faster than it is dissipated, the con-
ductor may melt. For obvious safety reasons, the National Electrical Code®, in Article
310.15 and Tables 310.16 through 310.21, sets definite limits on the amount of current
that a conductor is permitted to carry. Because both type and thickness of insulation are
factors in retarding the dissipation of heat, they must be considered in selecting conduc-
tors. The National Electrical Code® specifies the current-carrying capacities of various
wire sizes with different types of insulation when a specific number of conductors are
installed in a raceway or cable. Therefore, the current-carrying capacity of each conduc-
tor depends on the number of wires present in a raceway or cable.
In general, all conductors must be protected in accordance with their allowable
current-carrying capacities. The Code® should be consulted for further information
regarding specific installations.

SUMMARY
The thickness and length of a wire determine its resistance. The temperature is also
a determining factor. All wire materials have resistance, and copper is a common metal
used for wires and cables. Wire resistance results in an energy cost in terms of kilowatt-
hours used. When installing wire, as per Figure 8-5, it is important to select the proper
size and length, not only to do the job properly, but to save on costs.

VOLTAGE DROP ACROSS
CONDUCTORS
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• discuss the principles of voltage drop across conductors.
• demonstrate the problem-solving techniques involved in the selection of conductors.
Voltage drop is the loss of electrical potential in a conductor due to its resistance.
The effects of voltage drop across conductors can be observed each time the lights in a
home dim as a toaster or electric iron is connected. This effect is produced when a low-
resistance device is connected directly to the line or feeder. Because of this annoying
effect, power companies limit the power ratings of electrical components that are con-
nected directly to a line, and specify current-limiting controllers for use with motors and
other high current loads. Assuming that the power supply has sufficient electrical capac-
ity, this dimming effect can be reduced by using large conductors with low resistance
and a higher current-carrying capacity. The selection of a conductor is usually a com-
promise between cost and the permissible voltage drop.
Any conductor resistance causes a voltage drop that is determined by E = IR. For
example, if a conductor has a resistance of 5 ohms and is carrying a current of 7 amperes,
the voltage drop across the conductor is 7 × 5 or 35 volts.
Resistance in a conductor is a factor of its length and area in circular mils or its
diameter. If the resistance is given per foot of length, then the total resistance can be
found by multiplying the total length by the per foot resistance.
A length of wire has a resistance of 0.308 ohms per thousand feet, or 0.308/1,000 =
0.000308 ohms per foot.
The resistance of 584 feet of wire is as follows:
If a current of 20 amperes exists in the wire, a voltage drop of 3.6 volts will occur.
E = IR = 20 × 0.18 = 3.6 volts
584 feet × 0.000308
= 0.18 ohm

circular mils. Always use a wire size equal to or larger than the answer obtained from
the formula.
For all practical purposes, voltage drop is not affected by the insulation on a con-
ductor. The higher temperature insulations will carry their rated current according to the
tables in the National Electrical Code®, but the voltage drop may not be kept to a min-
imum. When long distances are involved, conductor sizes are usually determined by first
considering the voltage drop and then selecting an insulation suitable for the tempera-
ture and location encountered.

SUMMARY
Because electrical conductors contain resistance, a voltage drop will occur across
this resistance as though it were a resistor in a circuit. In power distribution lines, the
voltage drop is a function of the wire material, the wire thickness, the current passing
through the wire, and the wire length. This voltage drop must be taken into account to
deliver the needed power to a motor or other similar device.

MAGNETS AND
MAGNETIC FIELDS
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• describe the properties of magnets.
• discuss the basic principles of magnetism.
Much of present-day electrical equipment functions because of magnetism. Motors
and generators operate on the principle of magnetism. It is essential that the student of
electricity understands this phenomenon.
MAGNETIC MATERIALS
Iron and its derivative, steel, can be given the property of attracting other pieces of
iron and steel. This property, known as magnetism, is possessed to a much lesser degree
by nickel, cobalt, and gadolinium. Iron and steel combined with these and other mag-
netic materials will yield an alloy with much greater magnetic strength.
The magnetic effects of magnets are concentrated at areas called poles. These poles
are of two types and have been designated as north and south poles because of the fact
that a magnet supported freely in air will align its axis in a north-south direction. The
end of the magnet that points geographically north is called the north (N) pole, and the
other end is called the south (S) pole. Although all materials have some degree of a mag-
netic property, most materials do not have a useful amount of this property and, for all
practical purposes, can be called nonmagnetic.
PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY MAGNETS
Hard steel is used for the construction of permanent magnets. Soft steel is easier to
magnetize, but will retain a relatively weak degree of magnetization when the magnet-
izing force is removed. This small amount of magnetism retained by soft steel is known
as residual magnetism and is both desirable and important in the operation of electrical
equipment.
87

88
Unit 11 Magnets and Magnetic Fields
ELECTROMAGNETS
A very powerful temporary magnet can be made by placing a bar of soft steel
inside a coil of wire carrying an electrical current. The intense magnetic force created
is reduced to a weak residual force as soon as the current is interrupted. An electro-
magnet also can be used to magnetize magnetic materials by placing the material across
the poles of the electromagnet as seen in Figure 11-1, or by placing the material inside
the coil itself.
MAGNETIC INDUCTION
Magnetic materials also can be magnetized by placing them near a magnet. The
magnetism produced in the material by this method is called induced magnetism. In the
case of soft steel, the effect is only temporary. The magnetism is lost as soon as the mag-
net is removed.
LAW OF MAGNETS
If two magnets are brought near each other, the following will result:
• like poles repel.
• unlike poles attract.

MAGNETIZED
Figure 11-1  Magnetic charge.

89
Unit 11 Magnets and Magnetic Fields
Figure 11-2 illustrates this law. Two N poles and two S poles repel each other. An
N pole and an S pole attract each other.
MAGNETIC FIELDS
Magnets influence one another at a distance without actually making contact. The
space around a magnet through which this invisible force acts is known as the magnetic
field. The force itself may be represented by magnetic lines of force that are assumed
to exist in the space between the poles of the magnet. These invisible lines, collectively
referred to as magnetic flux, are shown in the space around the bar magnet in Figure 11-3.
Magnetic lines of force cannot be blocked or insulated, but will pass through or within
any material.

Field Strength
The concentration of lines of force is an indication of the magnetic strength at vari-
ous points in the magnetic field. This concentration, often referred to as the flux density,
is the number of flux lines in a square inch of CSA. In other words, as the number of flux
lines per CSA increases, the magnetic field becomes stronger.

90
Unit 11 Magnets and Magnetic Fields
Properties of Magnetic Flux
The following accepted properties of magnetic flux are very useful in explaining
the operation of a wide variety of electrical equipment using magnetic circuits:
1. There is no insulator for magnetic flux; it passes through all materials.
2. Lines of force are closed loops passing through the magnet and the space
around it.
3. The loops, formed by the lines of force, tend to become larger and increase in
length as they develop away from the magnet.
4. Lines of force have direction. They emerge from the N pole and enter the S pole.
5. Lines of force never cross one another.
6. Lines of force concentrate at the poles and develop maximum field strength there.
7. Large numbers of flux lines are easily established in magnetic materials, but are
difficult to establish in nonmagnetic materials such as air.
SUMMARY
Magnets contain N and S poles, and set up magnetic fields called flux. Magnetic
flux is invisible, but its effects can be observed in many ways. Flux consists of lines of
force, which exist from the north to south sides of magnets. The stronger the magnets,
the stronger the amount of flux. The amount of flux is called flux density.

ELECTROMAGNETISM
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• discuss the basic principles of electromagnetism.
• demonstrate how to determine the direction of a magnetic field.
• explain how a magnetic field is created in a coil of wire.
Magnetic circuits are employed in generators, alternators, motors, transformers,
relays, and many other important electrical machines. In all but a few instances, the
magnetizing force is produced by the effects of an electrical current in a coil with an
iron core.
CONDUCTOR FLUX
A wire carrying an electrical current exhibits magnetic characteristics. If placed
near iron filings, it will attract them, as shown in Figure 12-1.
Figure 12-2 illustrates the effect that a current-carrying conductor produces on iron
filings placed on a surface at right angles to the conductor.
The pattern formed by the iron
filings indicates the presence of a cir-
cular magnetic field around the con-
ductor. To prove that this field has
direction, small magnetic compasses
may be placed in the vicinity of the
conductor. Figure 12-3 shows that the
magnetic compasses, which ordinarily
point north and south, will arrange
themselves in a circle. Figure 12-3 also
shows that the direction of the magnetic
flux (conductor flux) depends on the
direction of the current. Thus, a mag-
netic field can be established in either
direction by controlling the direction
of current in the conductor.

94
Unit 12 Electromagnetism
Certain symbols are used to simplify the indication of current direction in a con-
ductor. The dot-cross method is illustrated in Figure 12-4. A dot indicates current com-
ing toward the observer; a cross indicates current going away from the observer.
The two cross-sectional views in Figure 12-5 illustrate the distribution and direction
of flux around a current-carrying conductor for both directions of current. Note that the
flux density is greatest near the wire and that individual lines of flux are closed loops.
Although a current-carrying conductor has a magnetic field, it does not have poles.
A pole is defined in Unit 11 as a point where magnetism is concentrated, and as the
points where flux lines emerge from a magnet and reenter a magnet. These points do not
exist for conductors.
The direction of the flux around a current-carrying conductor can be determined
by placing a magnetic compass near the wire. The direction of the compass N pole

LEFT-HAND RULE (CONDUCTOR FLUX)
Figure 12-6 illustrates the left-hand rule as it is used to determine the direction of
conductor flux. Place the left hand around the conductor with the thumb pointing in the
direction of electron movement. You do not have to touch the conductor. The fingers will
then wrap around the conductor in the direction of the flux.

Figure 12-7 shows the direction taken by lines of force around a bar magnet. The
lines emerge at the N pole and reenter at the S pole.
A straight current-carrying conductor has no poles. As soon as the same conductor
is arranged as a loop, it takes on the polar characteristics of a magnet. By adding
additional loops, also called turns, a coil is formed. The magnetic field produced in the

96
Unit 12 Electromagnetism
vicinity of the coil is shown in Figure 12-8. Note that this field pattern is like that of a
bar magnet.
Because the flux emerges at the left side, this end has the properties of a N pole.
Flux reenters at the other end of the coil, so
this end has the properties of a S pole.
LEFT-HAND COIL RULE
Figure 12-9 illustrates the technique of
using the left-hand coil rule.
The magnetic polarity of the coil is
determined by placing the fingers of the left
hand in the direction of current (electron
movement) as it exists through the turns of
wire. The thumb will point in the direction of
the N pole.

MAGNETIC STRENGTH
The magnetic strength of a coil depends on the
• amount of current in the coil.
• number of turns in the coil.
• type of core material used.
Magnetic strength can be expressed in ampere-turns for a given core material. The
term ampere-turn means the product of current in amperes, and the number of turns in
the coil.
In many cases, materials are inserted in a coil to increase the magnetic strength
of the coil. These materials are called cores. For a given core material, the magnetic
strength will change with a variation in the current and the number of turns, that is, with
the ampere-turns.
If a coil has a constant number of turns wrapped around a core, the current is the
only factor that can affect magnetic strength. Therefore, the more current there is through
a coil, the stronger the magnetic field will be.
If a soft iron bar is inserted in a coil as the core material, a very strong magnetic
field is established, as compared to the field produced when an air core is used.
SUMMARY
When current passes through a wire, a magnetic field is established. If the wire
is made into a coil, the current can create a very strong field of flux. This is called
electromagnetism. The strength of the magnetic field is a function of the amount of
current in the wire, the number of turns of the coil, and the type of core material inserted
into the coil. Electromagnetism is the basic concept for motors, generators, relays, and
transformers.

GENERATION OF
ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• discuss the principles involved in the production of an electromotive force.
• explain how voltage is generated due to mechanical motion.
An electromotive force (EMF) is necessary to produce an electrical current. The
production of electrical energy on a large scale cannot be accomplished economically
with batteries. Most of the electricity produced today is created through the use of alter-
nators and generators. Both machines operate on the principle of induced voltage.
In Figure 13-1, a conductor, which has its ends connected to a sensitive ammeter,
is being moved rapidly downward in a magnetic field. As the conductor is moved down-
ward, it cuts lines of magnetic flux. As a result, there is a deflection of the meter needle
indicating the presence of an electrical current produced by an induced voltage. It is
evident that the motion is responsible for the
voltage produced because no current is present
if the conductor is held motionless. Further-
more, the meter needle deflects in the opposite
direction if the conductor is moved upward
through the magnetic field. The direction in
which an induced voltage is produced depends
on the direction of conductor movement.
In general, the amount of induced voltage
produced in a conductor is directly propor-
tional to the
• strength of the magnetic field.
• length of the conductor in the field.
• speed at which the conductor passes
through the field.
• angle at which the conductor passes
through the field.

Unit 13 Generation of Electromotive Force
In machines that generate voltage, the strength of the field and the conductor length
are fixed quantities. The cutting angle depends upon the rotation of the conductor.
Therefore, the only real variable is conductor speed. As the conductor speed increases,
more lines of force are cut per second, and the induced voltage increases in magnitude.
In generators and alternators, powerful electromagnets are used to establish a
strong magnetic field. Conductors are mounted on an armature and rotated at high
speeds through this field. A large number of conductors can be used so that the individ-
ual voltages of all the conductors act in series to produce a greater voltage. In summary,
a high voltage can be created by cutting a powerful magnetic field with a series of con-
ductors moving at high speed.
LEFT-HAND GENERATOR RULE
Figure 13-2 shows how to determine the direction of an induced voltage when the
direction of the magnetic field and the direction of conductor motion are known. The
induced voltage creates a current that has a direction the same as that of the induced volt-
age. This method is known as the left-hand generator rule. Position the thumb, first fin-
ger, and middle finger of the left hand at right angles to one another. If the hand is placed
with the thumb in the direction of conductor motion, and the first finger in the direction

current (electron direction).
THE AC GENERATOR
The essential parts of a generator are shown in Figure 13-3. A single conductor loop
is placed so that it can be rotated in the space between two opposite poles of an electro-
magnet. To simplify the explanation, one side of the loop is shown in black and the other
side is in white. To use the induced voltage in an external circuit, each end of the loop is
connected to a slip ring. The external circuit is connected to these rings by a brush press-
ing against each ring. In other words,
a complete electrical circuit is pro-
vided through the sliding contacts at
the slip rings.
Assume that the loop is forced to
rotate clockwise in the magnetic field.
For the position shown in Figure 13-3,
the conductors that form the sides of
the loop are moving parallel to the
lines of force.At this instant, no flux is
cut by the conductors; therefore, no
voltage is generated.
As the loop is rotated, it reaches
the position shown in Figure 13-4.
Both sides of the loop now cut flux
but in opposite directions. An appli-
cation of the left-hand generator rule
shows that voltage is induced in
opposite directions on opposite sides
of the loop.
This means, however, that in the
loop as a whole, the voltages are in
the same direction. Carefully note the
direction of the current in the external
circuit.
As the loop reaches the position
shown in Figure 13-5, one-half revo-
lution has been completed and both
sides of the loop are again moving parallel to the magnetic flux. At this instant, no volt-
age is generated and no current is in any part of the loop or external circuit.

As the loop is rotated further, it reaches the position shown in Figure 13-6. In this
position, it has completed three-quarters of one revolution. By applying the left-hand
generator rule, the current in the black and white sections of the loop can be determined.
Note carefully that the current in both the loop and the external circuit is reversed from
that indicated in position 2.
One-quarter revolution later, the loop has reached its original position and the volt-
age and current again are zero.
Three important facts about the rotating loop must be emphasized:
1. The induced voltage in the loop reverses in direction twice each revolution.
2. An alternating current that reverses itself twice each revolution is present in the
external circuit.
3. The voltage and the resulting current are pulsating.
A graph illustrating the variations of induced voltage (EMF) for one full revolution
of the loop is shown in Figure 13-7. The maximum voltage is created whenever the loop
cuts flux at the fastest rate, or when the conductor is moving perpendicular to the lines

of force. The part of the graph below the horizontal axis indicates voltage in the oppo-
site direction.
DC GENERATOR
The single loop rotating in a magnetic field can be used to supply a direct current
to an external load circuit by means of a simple device known as a commutator (a recti-
fying device).
Figure 13-8 illustrates a single loop whose conductors terminate at a commutator
consisting of a ring split lengthwise into two separate segments. Because the loop will
be rotated, a sliding contact is necessary to bring current to the load circuit. Two brushes,
connected to the load circuit leads, rest against these commutator segments.
Assume that the loop is rotated in a clockwise direction. In Figure 13-8, the loop is
in a vertical position and no voltage or current is present in any part of the circuit.

In position 2, shown in Fig-
ure 13-9, the loop sides are cutting
flux. The induced voltage in the loop
produces a current from the white
wire,tothewhitesegment,tothewhite
brush, and to the load circuit. The
black brush is the positive terminal
and the white brush is the negative ter-
minal of the generator. Note the direc-
tion of the current in the load circuit,
from left to right through the meter.
In position 3, Figure 13-10, the
loop is now in a vertical position
again and no voltage or current exists
in any part of the circuit.
In position 4, Figure 13-11, the
induced current has reversed in both
sides of the loop. Note, however, that
current from the black wire passes to
the load circuit by way of the white
brush. Observe carefully that the
white brush is still negative, and that
the current remains in the same direc-
tion in the load circuit.
Three important facts concern-
ing this circuit must be emphasized:
1. The induced voltage in the loop
reverses itself twice during
each revolution.
2. The induced voltage and the
resulting current are pulsating
in character.
3. Although the current in the
loop is AC, a DC exists in the
load circuit. A graph of the
voltage developed across the brushes of a single loop rotated in a magnetic field
for one complete revolution is shown in Figure 13-12.
The output of a single-loop generator is too small and pulsating for any practical use.
Commercial generators use many loops mounted on the rotating member. An armature

is shown in Figure 13-13, with a cutaway view of that armature in Figure 13-14. This has
the effect of increasing the voltage and reducing the fluctuations in voltage output.
Many factors determine the voltage output of a generator. The factors are (1) num-
ber of poles, (2) flux per pole, (3) number of conductors on the armature, and (4) speed
of the armature. An in-depth study of each of these factors is required for a complete
understanding of generator operation.

SUMMARY
When a wire is moved through a magnetic field, a current is established in the
wire. This is the result of the electromotive force (EMF) produced. Electrical genera-
tors operate on this principle. In an AC generator, the EMF produced alternates in the
wire loop as it passes through the magnetic field. To convert this alternating EMF and
resulting current into a DC generator, a device called a commutator (rectifier) must be
used. A practical application of a DC generator is a portable welding system as shown
in Figure 13-15.

MOTOR PRINCIPLES
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• determine the direction of movement of a current-carrying conductor in a
magnetic field.
• discuss the basic principles of DC motors.
A large part of the energy used worldwide is created through hydroelectric installa-
tions and the burning of coal and oil. This potential energy is in mechanical form and can-
not be distributed as such at distances far from its source. If this energy is converted to elec-
trical energy, the problem of distribution is solved. It is necessary, however, to use electric
motors to change the energy back to a mechanical form at the point of application.
A simple conversion of electrical energy to mechanical energy is shown in Fig-
ure 14-1. Figure 14-1(A) shows a uniform magnetic field in which a conductor, carrying
no current, is placed. In Figure 14-1(B), the field is removed and a current is created in the
conductor due to an external voltage source. Notice the field about the conductor that is
created by the current (electrons) passing beyond the page.
Figure 14-1(C) illustrates the resultant magnetic field that exists when the magnetic
field is added. Above the conductor, the field produced by the current acts in an additive
manner with the field created by the poles. Below the conductor, the conductor field acts
in opposition to the pole field. The addition of the fields above the conductor, with the
reduction of the field below the conductor, causes the conductor to move in a downward

Unit 14 Direct-Current Motor Principles
direction. In Figure 14-1(D), the current (electron) direction in the conductor is reversed,
going into the page, so that the lines are additive below the conductor and in opposition
above the conductor. In this case, the conductor direction is upward. The conductor
movement shown in Figure 14-1 is the basic principle that governs the action of a motor.
Before this principle can be applied to an actual motor, a rule must be formulated so that
the direction of conductor motion can be determined when the direction of the current
(electron movement) is known.
RIGHT-HAND MOTOR RULE
The right-hand motor rule is explained by placing the thumb, first finger, and middle
finger of the right hand at angles to one another. As shown in Figure 14-2, if the first finger
is pointed in the direction of field flux, and the middle finger is in the direction of conduc-
tor current (electron direction),
then the thumb points in the
direction of conductor motion.
Figure 14-3 shows a single-
loop armature placed in the
magnetic field between two per-
manent magnets. The flux estab-
lished by the permanent magnet
is called the field flux. A current
introduced into the loop through
the brushes and commutator pro-
duces flux around all parts of this
loop. This flux is called conduc-
tor flux (described in Unit 12).
On the right side of the loop, an
application of the right-hand
motor rule shows that this loop is
forced downward. On the left
side of the loop, the conditions
are reversed and the loop side is
forced upward. If this loop is
mounted on a shaft and is free to
rotate, motion in a clockwise
direction results.
In Figure 14-4, the loop has
reached a vertical position and
the brushes rest on the insulated
spacer between the commutator

segments. No current exists in the loop and no force is present to continue the rota-
tion at this neutral position. The loop, however, has momentum due to the preced-
ing one-quarter revolution and
thus passes through this neutral
position.
In Figure 14-5, the armature
continues its movement so that the
commutator segments interchange
their positions on the brushes and
current reverses in the loop. Thus,
there is a reversal of conductor flux
direction on both the black and
white sections of the loop. This
means that as each side of the loop
passes a pole, the current in the
loop is always in the same direc-
tion with respect to that pole. As a
result, the rotation of the loop is
maintained in one direction.
The amount of torque, or
turning force, developed by this
single loop is directly dependent
on the strengths of the field flux and
the conductor flux. To strengthen
the field flux, it is customary to use
electromagnets for the field poles
of a motor. To strengthen the con-
ductor flux, the current in the wire
must be increased. The maximum
turning force is developed when
the loop is in a horizontal position;
the minimum force results when it
is in a vertical position.
The graph of the torque devel-
oped by a single-loop armature
over a period of one full revolution
is shown in Figure 14-6. Note that
there are two positions of maxi-
mum torque and two positions of
minimum torque.

114
Unit 14 Direct-Current Motor Principles
A single-loop armature has little practical value for commercial motor applications.
The torque applied to the motor shaft is weak and pulsating even with an electromag-
netic field.
The undesirable pulsations in torque of a single-loop armature can be eliminated by
adding more loops and the necessary commutator segments. Figure 14-7 shows the torque
graph of a double-loop armature.Although the torque is still pulsating, there is a noticeable
reduction in the torque variation between the maximum and minimum values.
A typical armature for a com-
mercial DC starter motor is shown
in Figure 14-8. This armature has
many loops of heavy wire with
additional commutator segments to
reverse the current in individual
loops at the proper time. The
improvement in smoothing the
torque, due to the additional loops,
can be compared to the addition of
cylinders in an automobile engine.
SUMMARY
In a generator, a wire loop must be moved through a magnetic field to produce a
current in that loop. In a motor, however, a current must be passed through a wire loop
to produce movement of that loop. This movement is called the motor principle. When
the wire loop turns, it produces torque, or a turning force. Torque is a function of the
amount of current in the wire, the number of wire loops, and the strength of the magnetic
field between the poles.

on how various types of signaling devices operate, as well as information on push-
buttons, bell transformers, and wire used in low-voltage signaling circuits.
RULES FOR BELL CIRCUITS
Wiring simple low-voltage bell circuits is easy if three rules are followed:
1. Connect a conductor from one side of the voltage source to the bell.
2. Connect a conductor from the other side of the voltage source to the control point
or pushbutton.
3. Connect a conductor from the pushbutton to the bell that is to be controlled.
Figure 16-1 shows a bell controlled from one push-
button using a bell-ringing transformer as a source of
power. Note that one connection is made directly from
one terminal of the transformer output to the bell. A sec-
ond conductor connects the other terminal of the trans-
former output to the switch or pushbutton. The result is
a simple series circuit.
BELL AND BUZZER CIRCUITS
A bell may be controlled from several different
pushbuttons in different locations. In this case, the same
three wiring rules apply as shown in Figure 16-2. Notice
that the pushbuttons are in parallel, and the pushbutton
combination is in series with the bell.

Unit 16 Typical Bell Circuits
Several signaling devices, each controlled from a separate pushbutton, may be used
on the same bell transformer. However, to distinguish among the signaling devices oper-
ated from different pushbuttons, each device must have a different tone.
Many homes have pushbuttons at both the
front and rear doors. In general, the bell or chime
is controlled from the pushbutton located at the
front door. The buzzer, or a bell with a different
tone, is controlled from the pushbutton located at
the rear door. Note that the circuit in Figure 16-3
is a series-parallel circuit.
As shown in Figure 16-4, combination units
containing a bell and buzzer encased as one are
commonly used. This type of signaling device
has three terminals. The terminals are connected
as follows: the center terminal to the transformer,
the right-hand terminal to the pushbutton at the
front door, and the left-side terminal to the push-
button at the rear door.
PUSHBUTTONS
The device used to open and close a bell circuit is the pushbutton. It consists of a
metal cover that holds a small insulated button in place on top of a spring contact. When
the button is depressed, the circuit is closed; when the button is released, the circuit is

open. In effect, this is a small, single-pole, normally open switch. Pushbuttons are usu-
ally mounted on a wooden doorframe at front and rear door entrances. Although there
are many types of surface and flush-mounted pushbuttons for different applications, they
are all basically the same in operation.
THE DOORBELL
The interior connections of a typical doorbell
are shown in Figure 16-5. Two small coils of insu-
lated wire mounted on iron cores form an electro-
magnet. Current passes from terminal A to termi-
nal E by way of the electromagnets, the contact
points B and C, and the armature labeled D. The
electromagnets and contact points are ungrounded,
while the armature and terminal E are grounded to
the case.
When this circuit path is energized, the two
coils become electromagnets and attract the arma-
ture toward the iron cores. This, in turn, causes the
hammer to strike the gong and, at the same instant,
causes contacts B and C to separate by the action
of the moving armature.
The circuit is now open and the coils no
longer attract the armature. The spring now returns
the armature to its original position and the circuit is again closed. This process is repeated
each time the hammer strikes the gong and continues as long as the bell circuit is ener-
gized. Because this cycle of operation occurs rapidly, the armature, contact spring, and
hammer vibrate rapidly.
THE BUZZER
To distinguish between the tone of two sig-
naling devices controlled from different pushbut-
tons, one bell and one buzzer can be used. As
shown in Figure 16-6, the buzzer does not have a
gong and hammer, but is otherwise identical to the
bell in connections and operation.

upper coil is the electromagnet for the bell,
and the lower coil is the electromagnet for

DOOR CHIMES
Many residential installations use
chimes rather than bells and buzzers. Instead
of a harsh ringing or buzzing sound, a musi-
cal chime or tone is produced. Chimes are
available in single-note, two-note, repeater-
tone (where both notes continue to sound as
long as the pushbutton is depressed) ver-
sions, and the more elaborate eight-note
(four-tube) styles. For the eight-note chime,
contacts on a motor-driven cam are arranged
to sound the notes of a simple melody in a
predetermined sequence.
The latter two styles are particularly
useful in homes with three entrances. For example, the chime can be connected so that
the eight-note melody (or repeater tone) indicates the front door, the two notes indicate
the side door, and the single note indicates the rear door.
BELL TRANSFORMER
The transformers required to operate door chimes are usually of larger capacity
than the transformers used with bells and buzzers. The voltage output of a chime trans-
former is usually 10 to 24 volts with a rating of 5 to 20 volt-amperes. A bell transformer
usually has a voltage output of 6 to 10 volts with a rating of 5 to 20 volt-amperes.
Chime transformers for homes are available with a 16-volt rating. Transformers
that provide a combination of voltages such as 4, 8, 12, and 24 volts also can be obtained.
The usual requirement is that the secondary current of this type of transformer must not
exceed 8 amperes under short-circuit conditions. A further requirement is that the
secondary voltage must not exceed 30 volts under open-circuit conditions.
BELL WIRE
The wire used for low-voltage bell and chime circuits is commonly called bell wire,
annunciator wire, or thermostat wire. One type of wire consists of a copper conductor
covered with two layers of cotton wrapped in opposite directions. These layers can be
tied off to prevent unraveling of the insulation at terminals or splices. Both layers of this
Figure 16-7  Combination bell and buzzer.

cotton wrapping are impregnated with paraffin. Another type of wire is insulated with a
thermoplastic compound. Because of the low voltages involved, paraffin and thermo-
plastic insulations are satisfactory. Because the current required for bell circuits is small,
No. 18 AWG conductors are typically used.
Multiconductor cables of two, three, or more single wires contained within a single
protective overall covering are available. This type of cable is commonly used in elec-
trical installations because it gives a neat appearance to the wiring and there is less dan-
ger of damage to individual wires. Color coding of conductors within cables makes cir-
cuit identification easy.
Bell wire and cable may be fastened directly to surfaces with insulated staples, or
may be installed in raceways. The particular requirements of the installation determine
how the conductors are to be attached.
NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE® RULES
In general, bell wires with low-voltage insulation must not be installed in the
same enclosure or raceway with lighting or power conductors. The outer jacket on
nonmetallic-sheathed cable, UF cable, and armored cable meets this requirement. Bell
wires must not come closer than 2 inches to open lighting or power conductors unless
the bell wires are permanently separated from the lighting or power conductors by some
approved type of insulation in addition to the insulation on the wire. Furthermore, bell
wire with low-voltage insulation may not enter an outlet box or switch box containing
lighting or power conductors unless a barrier is used to separate the two types of wiring.
Consult Article 720 of the National Electrical Code® for further information on spe-
cific installations.
SUMMARY
A wide range of bell chimes and buzzers is used in residential settings. All
involve the use of transformers, bell wire, and pushbutton switches. Transformers con-
vert regular house voltages to lower, safer voltages that bells require. The wire is
sometimes referred to as annunciator or thermostat wire, and is normally small (about
No. 18 AWG).

SWITCH CONTROL OF
LIGHTING CIRCUITS
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• describe the various types of switches used to control lighting circuits.
• list the ratings and categories of switches.
• discuss switch circuits and describe the use of various types of switches.
The electrician installs and connects various types of lighting switches. Therefore,
it is necessary to know how each type of switch operates and the standard connections
for each type of switch. The electrician must understand the meaning of the current and
voltage ratings marked on lighting switches and be familiar with the National Electrical
Code® requirements for the installation of these switches.
TOGGLE SWITCH
The most frequently used
switch in lighting circuits is the
toggle switch or snap switch,
shown in Figure 17-1. When
mounted in a switch box, the
switch is concealed in the wall
with only the insulated handle or
toggle protruding.
Four 
types 
of 
toggle
switches are available: single-
pole, three-way, four-way, and
double-pole. A three-way, toggle
switch is shown in Figure 17-2.

Unit 17 Switch Control of Lighting Circuits
used for lighting circuits as general-use snap switches and divides these switches into
two categories.
• Category 1. AC/DC general-use snap switches may control resistive loads, and are
not to exceed the ampere rating of the switch at rated voltage; may control inductive
loads not to exceed one-half the ampere rating of the switch at rated voltage; and
may control tungsten filament lamp loads not to exceed the ampere rating of the
switch at 125 volts when marked with the letter T. (This latter condition is imposed
because a tungsten filament lamp takes a very high current the instant the circuit is
closed and, thus, subjects the switch to a severe current surge.) The AC/DC general-
use snap switch is usually not marked AC/DC. However, it is always marked with
the current and voltage rating, such as 10A-125V or 5A-250V-T.
• Category 2. AC general-use snap switches are to be used on alternating-current cir-
cuits only. They may control resistive, inductive, and tungsten filament lamp loads
not to exceed the ampere rating of the switch at 120 volts; and may control motor
loads not to exceed 80 percent of the ampere rating of the switch at rated voltage,
but not exceeding 2 horsepower. Category 2 switches are marked AC in addition to
current and voltage ratings, such as 15A, 120-277V AC. These switches also can
be marked AC only. The 277-volt rating is required on 277/480 volt systems.
Refer to Article 404 of the National Electrical Code® for requirements on the
installation of switches.
Single-Pole Switch
A single-pole switch is used
when a light or group of lights, or
other load, must be controlled
from one switching point. This
type of switch is connected in
series with the ungrounded or hot
wire feeding the load. Figure 17-3
shows a typical application of a
single-pole switch controlling a
light from one switching point.
Note that the 120-volt source
feeds current directly through the
switch.
In Figure 17-4, the 120-volt
source feeds current directly to
the light outlet. This results in a

two-wire cable with black and white wires being used as a switch loop between the light
outlet and the single-pole switch. The National Electrical Code® permits the use of a
white wire in a single-pole switch loop and it must be re-identified. However, the black
conductor must connect between the switch and the load. Note that this requirement is
satisfied in Figure 17-4. See Article 200-7(c)(2) in the National Electrical Code®.
Figure 17-5 shows another application of a single-pole switch control. The feed
is at the switch that controls the light outlet. The convenience outlet is independent of
the switch.
Double-Pole Switch
A double-pole switch is used when it is necessary to break (open) both conductors
of a circuit. This circuit for a lamp on a gasoline-dispensing island is illustrated in
Figure 17-6.
Three-Way Switches
A three-way switch has one terminal, called the common terminal, to which the
switch blade is always connected. In addition, there are two other terminals called the
traveler wire terminals. In one position, the switch blade is connected between the com-
mon terminal and one of the traveler terminals. In the alternate position, the switch
blade is connected between the common terminal and the other traveler terminal.

Figure 17-7 shows the two positions of the three-way switch. Note that the three-way
switch is actually a single-pole, double-throw switch.
The three-way switch
has no ON or OFF posi-
tion. As a result, there are
no ON or OFF markings
on the switch handle. The
three-way switch can be
identified further by its
three terminals. The com-
mon terminal is darker in
color than the two traveler
wire terminals, which are
natural brass in color.
The three-way switch
is used when a light or
group of lights, or other
load, must be connected
from two different switch-
ing points. To accomplish
this, two three-way switch-
es are used, as shown in
Figure 17-8.

trolled from either of two

from either an upstairs or downstairs location, or a garage light from either the house
or the garage.
Figure 17-9 shows a different circuit arrangement using a three-way switch control
with the feed at the light. It is necessary to use the white wire in the cable as part of the
three-way switch loop in this circuit. The black wire is used as the return wire to the light
outlet.
Figure 17-10 represents another arrangement for a three-way switch control. The
feed is at the light with cable runs from the ceiling outlet to each of the three-way switch
control points, which are located on each side of the light outlet.

The Code® requires that three-way and
four-way switches be wired so that all switch-
ing is done only in the ungrounded circuit
conductor (Article 404).
Four-Way Switch Control
A four-way switch can be compared
with a double-pole, double-throw switch. It is
similar to a three-way switch in that it has two
positions and neither of these positions is ON
or OFF. As a result, the four-way switch has
no ON or OFF markings on the switch handle.
Two positions of a four-way switch are shown
in Figure 17-11.
The four-way switch is used when a
light or group of lights, or other load, must be
controlled from more than two switching
points. The switch connected to the source
and the switch connected to the load must be
three-way switches. At all other control
points, four-way switches are used.

three switching points. Care must be used in connecting the traveler wires to the proper

three-way switch are connected to the two terminals on one side of the four-way switch
while the two traveler wires from the other three-way switch connect to the two termi-
nals on the other side of the four-way switch.
SUMMARY
Electrical switches come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors. There are single-
pole, double-pole, three-way switches, and four-way switches. The requirements of the
electrical job dictate the types of switches to be used. Consult the National Electrical
Code® for current methods of installation.

WIRING MATERIALS
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• list the various types of wiring materials available.
• explain the advantages and limitations of each wiring material.
The following types of materials are used in wiring:
• nonmetallic-sheathed cable
• armored cable
• flexible metal conduit
• electrical nonmetallic tubing
• rigid metal conduit
• thinwall conduit or electrical metallic tubing
• rigid nonmetallic conduit
• surface metal raceway
• flat conductor cable
These wiring materials are discussed in this unit, including their advantages, limi-
tations, and applications. Refer to National Electrical Code® when studying this unit.
The articles of the Code® related to the sections of this unit must be thoroughly under-
stood so that the electrician has a complete understanding of why these wiring materials
may or may not be used in various applications and locations.
NONMETALLIC-SHEATHED CABLE
Nonmetallic-sheathed cable is available with two or three current-carrying
conductors in sizes ranging from No. 14 through No. 2 with copper conductors, and in
sizes No. 12 through No. 2 with aluminum conductors. Color coding of these conductors
is black and white for two-wire cable, and black, white, and red for three-wire cable.
This cable is also available with a ground wire, which is usually an uninsulated copper
conductor. This conductor is used for grounding only. Insulation on the current-carrying
conductors is rated at 90°C (194°F), and typically is a heat-resistant thermoplastic,
THNN.
139

140
Unit 18 Wiring Materials
Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. lists nonmetallic-sheathed cable in three
classifications:
• Type NM cable may be used for both exposed and concealed work in normally
dry locations. It has an overall flame-retardant and moisture-resistant covering. It
may be fished (drawn through) in the hollow spaces of masonry block or tile
walls where such walls are not exposed to excessive dampness. Masonry that is
in direct contact with the earth is considered a wet location.
Type NM cable shall not be installed where exposed to corrosive fumes or
vapors and shall not be embedded in masonry, concrete, fill, or plaster.
• Type NMC cable may be used for both exposed and concealed work in dry, moist,
damp, or corrosive locations. It has an overall flame-retardant, moisture-resistant,
fungus-resistant, and corrosion-resistant covering. It may be run in hollow spaces
of masonry walls. Type NMC cable is commonly installed in buildings where a
highly corrosive atmosphere is present.
• Type NMS cable contains insulated power conductors as well as signal conduc-
tors all in the same cable. This cable is intended to be used with “smart house”
circuits. Type NMS cable has a moisture-resistant, flame-retardant, nonmetallic
outer jacket.
The National Electrical Code® lists various locations where Types NM, NMC,
and NMS cable shall not be used. These locations include, for example, service
entrance cable, places of public assembly, and hazardous areas, among others. Article
334 of the Code® should be consulted for the complete list and/or exceptions.
Both types of nonmetallic-sheathed cable shall be strapped or stapled not more
than 12 inches (300 mm) from a box or fitting and at intervals not exceeding 4-1/2 feet
(1.4 meters); shall be protected against physical damage where necessary; shall not be
bent to a radius less than five times the diameter of the cable; and are for use on circuits
of 600 volts or less.
Nonmetallic cable has various trade names, such as Braidx, Cresflex, Loomwire,
and Romex. Figure 18-1 shows the two-wire cable with ground wire.
Special connectors, such as the one shown in Figure 18-2, are used to secure non-
metallic cable to outlets such as fuse boxes and device boxes, as shown in Figure 18-3.

Some types of connectors are first securely fas-
tened to the cable. The threaded section of the con-
nector is then slipped through the knockout hole in
the outlet box. Finally, the locknut is securely fas-
tened to the connector on the inside of the outlet box.
When nonmetallic cable is used, it is necessary
to remove the outer covering to make necessary con-
nections in outlet boxes and switch boxes. This is
done by slitting the braid with a knife as far back as
necessary. The braid and paper removed from the
wires are then cut off. In removing this outer braided
covering, extreme care must be used so that the wire
and its insulation are not damaged.
Nonmetallic-sheathed cable is
an inexpensive wiring method to use.
This cable is relatively light in weight
and is easy to install. For these rea-
sons, it is widely used for residential
installations.
ARMORED CABLE
Armored cable, shown in Fig-
ure 18-4, is available with two, three,
or four conductors that come in sizes
from No. 14 AWG to No. 1 AWG,
inclusive. Color coding is as follows:
for two-wire cable, black-white; for
three-wire cable, black-white-red; for
four-wire cable, black-white-red-blue.

Type AC cable is armored cable with insulated conductors covered with a flame-
retardant and moisture-resistant finish. Since the development of thermoplastic insu-
lations, armored cable is usually manufactured with Type THH or Type TM insulation.
This is called Type ACT cable. Additional information can be found in Article 320 of
the Code®.
Armored cable is required to have an internal bonding strip of either copper or alu-
minum in close contact with the armor for its entire length. This metal strip, plus the
flexible steel armor, makes this cable desirable when a grounded system is required. The
armor also adds mechanical protection to the conductors.
Whenever a connection is made in an outlet box or a switch box, it is necessary to
cut the metal armor back 6 to 8 inches from the end of the cable. To prevent any damage
to the conductors, a fiber bushing must be inserted between the steel armor and the
wires at the point where the armor is cut. Figure 18-5 shows the steps required to
remove the armor and insert the fiber bushing (called an antishort bushing) between the
conductors and the armor. Connectors for armored cable are shown in Figure 18-6. A
device box used for both armored cable and nonmetallic-sheathed cable is shown in
Figure 18-7.

Unit 18 Wiring Materials
In general, TypeAC and TypeACT cable may
be used on circuits up to 600 volts; may be used for
open and concealed work in dry locations; may be
fished through walls and partitions; and may be
embedded in the plaster finish on masonry walls or
run through the hollow spaces of such walls if these
locations are not considered damp or wet. This
cable shall be secured within 12 inches from every
outlet box or fitting and at intervals not exceeding
4-1/2 feet, and shall not be bent to a radius of less
than five times the diameter of the cable.
Armored cable is not approved for use under-
ground, and cannot be embedded in masonry, con-
crete, or the fill of buildings during construction.
This cable cannot be installed in any location
exposed to weather, oil, gasoline, or other materials
that have a deteriorating effect on rubber insulation.
Metal-clad (MC) cable is similar to armored
cable, but the installation must comply with Article 330 of the Code®. The metallic cov-
ering must be continuous and close fitting. The covering may be a smooth metallic
sheath, a corrugated metallic sheath, or interlocking metal tape armor.
FLEXIBLE METAL CONDUIT
Flexible metal conduit, shown in Figure 18-8, is sometimes called Greenfield tub-
ing. This conduit is similar to armored cable. It is formed with a single strip of galva-
nized metal, wound in a spiral on itself, and interlocked so as to provide maximum
strength with greatest flexibility. The electrician must pull wires through this conduit.
This flexible conduit is measured by its inside diameter and is listed in sizes from 3/8
inch to 4 inches, inclusive. Refer to Article 348 of the National Electrical Code® for the
rules covering the use of flexible metal conduit.
Whenever a rigid raceway system requires a flexible section to meet difficult instal-
lation conditions, flexible metal conduit may be used. This conduit is used to provide a
flexible raceway to adjustable equipment such as a motor mounted on an adjustable base
Figure 18-7  Box for armored cable
and nonmetallic-sheathed cable.

for a belt drive. It is recommended for temporary wiring installations where local codes
specify that wiring must be in metallic conduit. It is approved for many locations except
wet locations, hoistways, storage battery rooms, hazardous locations, or where condi-
tions may have a deteriorating effect on the conductor insulation.
A wiring material very similar to flexible metal conduit is liquidtight flexible metal
conduit. This conduit has an outer liquidtight jacket over the armor. This jacket makes
the conduit suitable for locations subject to oil, water, certain chemicals, and corrosive
atmospheres. The conduit is available in sizes from 3/8 inch to 4 inches. Another simi-
lar material is liquidtight nonmetallic conduit. It is lightweight, strong, and corrosion
resistant. It is easy to work with, leaves no jagged edges when cut, and remains round in
tight radius bends. Figure 18-9 shows a typical installation.

Electrical Sciences, Inc.)
ELECTRICAL NONMETALLIC TUBING (ENT)
Electrical nonmetallic tubing (ENT) may be used in a wide variety of applications.
It may be used in place of flexible metal conduit and electrical metallic tubing. It is
corrugated, lightweight, and strong. It is also very easy to work with because it can be
bent by hand. It is made of the same material used to fabricate rigid nonmetallic conduit.
ENT comes in diameters ranging from 1/2 inch to 2 inches with weight ranges of 12 lb
to 20 lb per 100 feet.

Figure 18-10 shows a quick connect coupling joining two pieces of ENT together.
Figures 18-11 and 18-12 illustrate the use of a quick connect terminator for fastening to
an outlet box. ENT may be cut very easily with a conduit cutter as shown in Figure 18-13.
According to Article 362 of the National Electrical Code®, ENT may be used in
any building of three floors or less, and it may be installed in ceilings, walls, and floors.
It may not be used in hazardous locations or to support fixtures or equipment. Other
restrictions may be found in the Code®.

Unit 18 Wiring Materials
RIGID METAL CONDUIT
Rigid metal conduit is an extremely durable type of material, and the wires must
be pulled through as with flexible metal conduit. This conduit pipe is annealed and heat
treated to permit easy bending. Conduit comes in 10-foot lengths and is obtained with a
galvanized finish. Galvanized conduit has a heavy, but smooth and uniform, coating of
zinc applied to both the exterior and interior surfaces. After the zinc is applied, a coating
of insulating lacquer is baked on all interior and exterior surfaces to produce a smooth
raceway through which wires may be pulled with a minimum of effort. The combination
of the heavy zinc coating and the lacquer coating protects the conduit from moisture and
corrosive fumes. Galvanized conduit is also available without the lacquer coating.
Each 10-foot length of conduit is threaded on both ends. One coupling is furnished
with each 10-foot length of conduit. Figure 18-14 shows galvanized conduit.
Factory-bent elbows are available for all sizes of rigid conduit from 1/2 inch to
6 inches, as shown in Figure 18-15. However, electricians generally do their own bend-
ing at the job site. Most of the small conduit sizes are bent with hand benders and hick-
eys (bending devices), whereas the larger sizes are bent with the aid of hydraulic benders.
Plastic-coated conduit is available. It is resistant to the severe corrosive atmo-
spheres found in certain areas of sewage treatment plants, metal refineries, tanneries, and
similar locations.
Figure 18-14
Galvanized rigid
conduit and coupling.
Figure 18-15
Elbows for rigid
conduit.

Aluminum conduit is available and
has several advantages over other types of
conduit. For example, it is
• only about one-third the weight of
galvanized conduit.
• corrosion resistant.
• nonmagnetic, resulting in less voltage
drop per given length as compared to
metal conduit. Therefore, the power
loss is reduced.
A complete line of aluminum elbows,
straps, locknuts, bushings, conduits, and
other fittings is available from various man-
ufacturers. These fittings are manufactured
to conform to the requirements of the
National Electrical Code®.
More detailed information on partic-
ular fittings can be obtained from manufacturers’ catalogs and specifications.
Conduit is manufactured in sizes ranging from 1/2 inch to 6 inches. The rigid con-
duit size is always determined by the internal diameter and even this value is slightly
larger than the rated size. The preceding table provides the internal and external diame-
ters in inches for each trade size of rigid conduit.
Conduit Fittings
Rigid conduit is secured to junction boxes, outlet boxes, and fuse boxes by locknuts
and end bushings. Figure 18-16 illustrates two types of boxes for conduit. Figure 18-17
illustrates a locknut used with rigid conduit. This locknut is turned on the threaded end of
the conduit pipe with the teeth formed by the notches facing toward the box. The conduit
is then slipped through the knockout hole and a metal end bushing, shown in Figure 18-18,
is screwed to the end of the conduit as tightly as possible. The locknut is then tightened
solidly against the outside wall of the outlet box. The teeth of the locknut must bite into the
metal of the outlet box to ensure that the conduit pipe is securely bonded to ground.
The bushing on the end of the conduit thread secures the conduit to the inner wall
of the outlet box and protects the wires from possible damage from the edge of the con-
duit. When using end bushings made entirely of insulating material (such as plastic), a
locknut shall be installed both inside and outside the enclosure.
A complete line of fittings is available for any installation problem involving
rigid conduit. Conduit fittings, shown in Figure 18-19, are threaded and can be tight-
ened securely to the threaded end of the conduit. Conduit fittings are available in the

same sizes given for conduit pipe. For example, 1/2-inch pipe requires 1/2-inch con-
duit fittings.
Conduit fittings have wiring chambers large enough to permit splicing and taping.
Fittings with wire-hole covers may be used as outlets for motors and control equipment.
Certain types of fittings permit the mounting of flush wiring devices, whereas other
types are used for light outlets.
Rigid conduit provides maximum protection to conductors. This type of raceway
also acts as an effective ground for equipment. Rigid conduit is a standard wiring method

and may be used in nearly all situations. It is used for concealed wiring in buildings
where the wiring is buried in concrete or masonry. When wiring is to be exposed and
subject to mechanical damage, rigid conduit is a satisfactory wiring method.
Rigid metallic conduit is one of the few raceways permitted by the National
Electrical Code® for use on systems operating at more than 600 volts. With the proper
fittings, rigid conduit may be installed in hazardous locations. It may not be installed in
or under cinder fill unless it is protected by corrosion-resistant material suitable for the
purpose. (Certain types of cinders form sulfuric acid in the presence of moisture. This
acid is very corrosive to steel conduit.)

Bends in conduits containing conductors without lead sheathing shall have a radius
not less than six times the diameter of the conduit. Bends in conduits containing con-
ductors with lead sheathing shall have a radius not less than ten times the trade diame-
ter of the conduit.
Article 344 of the National Electrical Code® covers all types of rigid conduit and
installations involving rigid conduit. Annex C of the Code® refers to conduit and tubing
fill tables for conductors and fixture wires of the same size.
ELECTRICAL METALLIC TUBING (EMT)
Electrical metallic tubing (EMT) is a nonthreaded thinwall, rigid metallic conduit.
The walls of this conduit are substantially lighter in weight than the walls of rigid con-
duit pipe. Metallic tubing, therefore, does not offer the same protection against mechan-
ical damage or the corrosive action of water or chemicals as does rigid metal conduit.
Thinwall metallic tubing is not threaded, as shown in Figure 18-20. Compression
couplings are used for joining lengths of metallic tubing, and compression connectors
are used to secure metallic tubing to outlet and junction boxes.
Figure 18-20  Electrical metallic tubing.
EMT comes in 10-foot lengths and is made in sizes ranging from 1/2 inch to 4 inches.
The inside diameter is slightly larger than the stated size. The table lists a few of the
available sizes in inches of electrical metallic tubing and the inside and outside diame-
ters for each size.
Metallic tubing is light and easy to handle. Furthermore, with the use of compres-
sion couplings and connectors, shown in
Figure 18-21 and 18-22, this type of race-
way can be assembled quickly. For most
wiring jobs, time is important and minutes
saved mean dollars earned.
Fittings used with this type of race-
way are called EMT fittings. Figure 18-21
shows a threadless coupling used to join
lengths of electrical metallic tubing.
Figure 18-22 shows the EMT fitting used
as a connector to secure metallic tubing to
outlet and junction boxes.

Metallic tubing may be used for open or concealed work where it will not be sub-
ject to severe mechanical damage or to corrosive vapors. This tubing may not be used in
cinder concrete or fill unless protected on all sides by a layer of noncinder concrete at
least 2 inches thick, or unless the conduit is at least 18 inches under the fill.
Tubing smaller than the 1/2-inch size may not be used except under special condi-
tions specified in the National Electrical Code®. The maximum tubing size which may
be used with any number or combination of conductors is the 4-inch size. EMT cannot
be used in interior wiring systems if the voltage is greater than 600 volts. For additional
information, refer to Article 358 of the Code®.
RIGID NONMETALLIC
CONDUIT
Rigid nonmetallic con-
duit is easy to install, light in
weight, corrosion resistant,
resistant to distortion from
heat, flame retardant, resist-
ant to the effects of low tem-

ant. It weighs about 25 per-
cent of the weight of similar
sizes of metallic tubing and
typically can be installed in
less time. Rigid nonmetallic
conduit may be used above
ground, buried, or encased in
concrete.

Rigid nonmetallic conduit comes in nominal sizes ranging from 1/2 inch to
6 inches. Heavy wall and extra-heavy wall conduit are available for use depending on
installation requirements. A few available sizes are shown in the table. Notice the dif-
ference in the wall thickness for the extra-heavy wall conduit as compared to the heavy
wall. Thinwall nonmetallic conduit is also available primarily for underground instal-
lations encased in concrete.
Figure 18-23 shows an installation in which several different size conduits are used.
Couplings are employed to join the conduits together. A solvent cement is applied to the
pieces and the joint is allowed to set for approximately 10 minutes.
Rigid nonmetallic conduit may be purchased in standard 10-foot lengths that
include one coupling, which is attached. It may also be produced in lengths shorter or
longer than 10 feet, with or without couplings.
Three basic steps are involved in bending nonmetallic conduit: heating the conduit,
forming the bend, and cooling the conduit. Care must be taken that damage does not
occur to the conduit and that the inside diameter is not reduced. Figure 18-24 shows an
installation in which several bends were required.

According to Article 352 of the National Electrical Code®, nonmetallic conduit
may not be used to support fixtures, and may not be installed in certain hazardous
locations. Care must be taken to observe the temperature limitations associated with
the conduit being used.
A variety of nonmetallic fittings and boxes are available for nonmetallic conduit. A
few are shown in Figure 18-25.

SURFACE METAL RACEWAYS
The surface metal raceway is a two-piece, flat, metal raceway that can be mounted
on ceilings and walls. The base or channel is securely fastened to the ceiling or wall
surface by screws, toggle bolts, or rawl drives. The cover or capping is secured directly
to the channel or base.
This type of raceway generally is used in office buildings, public buildings, and
some industrial plants for making additions to existing installations or where future
changes are probable. The surface metal raceway is neat in appearance and does not
detract from the appearance of a room. The raceways are relatively small and can be
used with special fittings to go around beams and corners.
The National Electrical Code®
permits surface metal raceways in dry
locations for exposed or surface work.
The raceway can be extended through
dry walls, dry partitions, and dry
floors if one continuous length of
raceway is used throughout the con-
cealed section.
The raceway cannot be used for
concealed work in locations subject to
severe mechanical damage, or where it
may be subjected to corrosive vapors,
or in hoistways and hazardous loca-
tions.
Two types of surface metal race-
ways are known as National Metal
Molding, shown in Figure 18-26 and
Figure 18-27, and Wiremold, shown in
Figure 18-28 and Figure 18-29. A com-
plete line of fittings is available for

each of these makes of raceway. Wiremold is available in standard lengths of 10 feet.
(See Article 386 of the Code®.)
FLAT CONDUCTOR CABLE
Flat conductor cable is a wiring system that may be used under carpet squares on
solid, smooth, and continuous floor surfaces. According to the National Electrical
Code®, Article 324, the carpet squares may not be larger than 36 inches by 36 inches.
This type of wiring system is primarily used for renovation projects in offices and busi-
ness establishments. It may not be used in residential, school, or hospital buildings. In
addition, it cannot be used outdoors, in wet locations, in hazardous locations, or in loca-
tions where corrosive vapors are present.
The Code® specifies that the cable must be installed with a metal shield on top to
cover all cable runs, corners, connectors, and ends. In addition, a bottom shield must be
installed beneath the cable.
Figure 18-30 shows the various parts of a flat conductor-cable power system with
metal shields, receptacles, transition boxes, and an installation tool. The cable is avail-
able with three, four, or five wires in wire size equivalents of No. 10 and No. 12 AWG

to handle up to 30-ampere circuits. The cable is color coded as shown in Figure 18-31
and comes in rolls of 50 feet, 100 feet, and 250 feet.
Flat cable taps, splices, and transitions are connected with an installation tool as
shown in Figure 18-32. With this tool, consistently reliable connections are easily made.

tional information.
SUMMARY
Wiring materials exist for any type of electrical installation. The key is to select the
proper cable for the job, depending on the physical environment, weather conditions,
and opportunities for damage. It is important to know the capabilities of each type of
cable, as well as the conduits and moldings that are available.

REMOTE CONTROL SYSTEMS
FOR LIGHTING CIRCUITS
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• explain the principles of basic remote control systems.
• list and describe the devices used in remote control systems.
A remote control wiring system uses controlling devices such as relays. A dial tele-
phone system is probably one of the best known remote control wiring systems. In the
telephone system, relays at a distant point are operated by turning the dial or pushing the
buttons on the telephone.
Remote control systems have been developed to control lighting circuits, appli-
ances, and other equipment in various situations. These remote control systems consist
of low-voltage relays (24 volts) that operate 120-volt contacts from low-voltage con-
trolling switches.
The low-voltage remote control system makes it possible to have multiswitch control
with only a small increase in cost. Switches are easily installed and the installation of one
switch or several usually does not present problems. The same type of low-voltage switch
is used whether light outlets are controlled from one, two, or more locations.
Special cables are not required as in three-way and four-way switch connections.
Low-voltage remote control circuits may be installed in two- or three-wire cable using
No. 18 AWG wire, which is low in cost and easy to install.

The switch used in the low-voltage remote control
system is a single-pole, double-throw momentary con-
tact switch that is normally open. This type of control
switch is approximately one-third the size of a standard
single-pole switch. It may have three terminals, four
terminals, or three color-coded lead wires. Regardless
of the type of switch used, all will function as a single-
pole, double-throw momentary contact switch. Fig-
ure 19-1 illustrates one type of low-voltage switch.

Unit 19 Remote Control Systems for Lighting Circuits
Connections are made to this low-voltage switch as follows: terminal No. 4
is connected to the 24-volt transformer source; terminal No. 1 is not connected to
the switch contacts, but is used only for connection purposes so that splices are unnec-
essary; and the two other terminals connect to the relay or to other low-voltage
switches.
LOW-VOLTAGE RELAY
A split-coil relay is used in low-
voltage remote control systems to oper-
ate contacts in the 120-volt lighting
circuit, shown in Figure 19-2. One coil
closes the 120-volt circuit and the other
coil opens the contactors in the 120-
volt circuit. This relay is a mechanical
latching-type unit that requires a 24-
volt rectified alternating current pulse
to operate. The relay, shown in Fig-
ure 19-3, is small enough to be mounted from the inside of a
standard outlet box through any 1/2-inch knockout hole open-
ing. This leaves the two high-voltage leads inside the outlet
box while the low-voltage end is outside the box. The wall of
the outlet box serves as a partition between the high and low
voltages. The two high-voltage leads inside the outlet box are
connected like a single-pole switch.
CONDUCTORS
Stranded copper conductors are used for remote control
systems and the wire gauge depends on the number of relays
and the length of run of the installation. The sizes range from
No. 12 AWG to No. 20 AWG. Multiconductor cables may be
purchased in addition to two-wire, and shielded wire is also
available.
RECTIFIER
The relay operates with a rectified alternating current, which is actually a direct
current. The sinewave is rectified into a pulsating direct current waveform due to
the rectifier. Figure 19-4 shows the rectifier, the rectifier symbol, and the rectified
waveform.

Another common application is shown in the wiring diagram in Figure 19-7, in
which each light has individual switch control. In other words, switch 1 controls light 1,
and switch 2 controls light 2.
Figure 19-8 illustrates a wiring diagram for two lights, both of which are to be con-
trolled from any one of three switch points.
For specific remote control wiring requirements, the National Electrical Code®
should be consulted for rules and regulations that govern the installation. The low-voltage
remote control system Code® requirement is different from the 120-volt requirements.
SUMMARY
Numerous remote control systems are found in homes and in industry, not just
lighting systems. However, the principles of low-voltage lighting circuits apply to other
types of remote operations. The electrical devices required are basic to almost any type
of remote system. Low-voltage circuits are generally safer, have lower operating costs,
and require minimal maintenance.
