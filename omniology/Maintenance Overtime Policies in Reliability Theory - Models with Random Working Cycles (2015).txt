Preface
Maintenance theory is basically how to make appropriate maintenances at suitable
times to prevent failures for an objective system. Classic maintenance theory was
mathematically established by Barlow and Proschan [1] 50 years ago. After that, a
great part of maintenance models and a variety of maintenance policies, such as
preventive replacement, preventive maintenance, inspection, etc., were summarized
systematically in [2, 3]. To understand maintenance theory and master reliability
engineering, we have to learn probability, statistics, and stochastic processes because
reliability phenomena occurs randomly. The elementary textbook for graduate stu-
dents, researchers, and engineers to learn readily reliability theory was published [4],
which was written in an easy style on stochastic processes, and all examples are
quoted ﬁttingly from reliability and maintenance models.
It is well known generally in maintenance theory that an optimum replacement
policy should be non-random [1], i.e., preventive replacement is always done at a
deterministic time T which is taken to be a constant. However, most production and
computer systems have variable working cycles and processing times. For such
systems, it would be impossible or impractical in a strict periodic fashion to interrupt
their running work for scheduled maintenances [1]. From this viewpoint, random
maintenances of age replacement, periodic replacement, and inspection have been
proposed, and their optimum policies were discussed and compared with each other
theoretically and numerically [5]. As practical examples, random maintenance was
applied to parallel systems, scheduling problems, damage models, and so on.
The concepts of maintenance ﬁrst, maintenance last, and maintenance overtime
were newly introduced in [5]. Especially, combining maintenances with time and
cycles, maintenance overtime is proposed. For example, age replacement overtime is
to replace a unit at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles over time T. In this case, a
unit continues to work without interruption by maintenance, and its maintenance
considering working cycles is made simply without counting the number of cycles.
The main object of this Lecture Note is to investigate the relations of mainte-
nance overtime with other maintenance policies and to add some new interesting
results: Chap. 1 summarizes age replacement in which the unit is replaced before
failure at a planned time T and at a working cycle N. We take up age and random
v

replacements as the basic policies in Sect. 1.1. The expected cost rates are obtained,
optimum policies which minimize them are derived analytically, and two policies
are compared. Replacement overtime is proposed in Sect. 1.2, in which the unit is
replaced at time T or at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles. Replacement
overtime with age and random replacements are compared analytically and
numerically in Sect. 1.3. When three replacement costs are the same, replacement
overtime is better than random replacement, however, it is not rather than age
replacement. Replacement overtime last is proposed in Sect. 1.4, in which the unit
is replaced at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles over time T or at cycle N,
whichever occurs last. Replacement overtime last is better than random replace-
ment, however, it is not rather than replacement overtime. Compared to replace-
ment overtime ﬁrst, if replacement time T is given and is small, overtime last is
better than overtime ﬁrst, and conversely, if T is large, it is not rather than
replacement ﬁrst. We consider age replacement for a ﬁnite interval S in Sect. 1.5
and for a job with a speciﬁed number N in Sect. 1.6. All results in the previous
sections are rewritten effectively when a ﬁnite interval and a speciﬁed number are
constant and random variables. Finally, we apply replacement overtime to a parallel
system with constant and random number of units in Sect. 1.7.
Chapter 2 summarizes periodic replacement in which the unit undergoes mini-
mal repair at each failure, and is replaced at a planned time T, at a working cycle N
or at a failure number K. First, we take up periodic and random replacements in
which the unit is replaced at time T or at cycle N, whichever occurs ﬁrst, and two
policies are compared in Sect. 2.1. Replacement overtime is proposed in Sect. 2.2,
in which the unit is replaced at time T or at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles,
and is compared with periodic and random replacements in Sect. 2.3. When three
replacement costs are the same, replacement overtime is better than random
replacement, however, it is not rather than periodic replacement. Replacement
overtime last is proposed in Sect. 2.4, in which the unit is replaced at the ﬁrst
completion of working cycles over time T or at cycle N, whichever occurs last.
Replacement overtime last is better than random replacement, however, it is not
rather than replacement overtime. Furthermore, replacing cycle N with failure K,
we consider replacement overtime ﬁrst and last in Sect. 2.5. Two overtime policies
are proposed in Sect. 2.6, in which the unit is replaced at the ﬁrst failure over cycle
N and at the ﬁrst working cycle over failure K. Finally, we take up two imperfect
preventive maintenance overtime policies in which the preventive maintenance is
done at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles over time T in Sect. 2.7.
Chapter 3 investigates inspection ﬁrst, inspection last, and inspection overtime
when the failure time is exponentially distributed. We take up periodic and random
inspections in which the unit is checked at periodic times kT and successive
working cycles Yj, and two polices are compared in Sect. 3.1. Inspection ﬁrst,
inspection last, and inspection overtime are proposed, and are compared to other
policies in Sects. 3.2 and 3.3. When the failure time is not exponential, we show
how to obtain expected costs of inspection ﬁrst, last and overtime in Sect. 3.4.

Preface

Finally, we consider the backup policies and make similar arguments to inspection
policies in Sects. 3.5 and 3.6.
Chapter 4 proposes generalized replacement policies with three variables in
which the unit is replaced at time T, at cycle N or at failure K. We take up
replacement ﬁrst, replacement last, and replacement middle in Sect. 4.1, where
replacement middle is an entirely new model. Age replacement is the best one
among three policies when all of replacement costs are the same. Two kinds of
replacement overtime with working cycle and failure number are considered in
Sects. 4.2–4.4, and their expected costs are obtained. Finally, replacement ﬁrst and
last with n variables are proposed in Sect. 4.5, in which the unit is replaced at time
T or at random times Y1; Y2;    ; Yn.
New policies such as maintenance ﬁrst, last, middle, and overtime are formally
proposed in this Lecture Note, some of which have been analytically optimized,
however, some of them have not been done yet. For example, it is difﬁcult to derive
theoretically optimum T, N and K of replacement policies with three variables
when replacement costs are different, even if to compute simply them numerically.
Such problems would offer new theoretically topics in maintenance theory as fur-
ther studies.
Most systems fail due to many kinds of causes and factors such as calendar or
operating times, running or ﬂight distance, amount of damage or crack, number of
uses, works, shocks or faults, and so on. Based on these, we have to form a ﬁtting
schedule with several kinds of maintenance measures to avoid the above failures.
Furthermore, it should be an important problem to make suitable maintenances for
systems due to several kinds of failures, i.e., systems fail according to several failure
distributions. By modifying and extending the proposed maintenance policies to ﬁt
existing conditions, their applications could be found in actual systems. Finally,
extended failure rates appearing in this Lecture Note are summarized in Appendix
[5, p. 227].

Chapter 1
Age Replacement Overtime
We consider a unit operating for a job with random working cycles, in which case,
it would be impossible or impractical to replace the unit in a strict or deterministic
fashion [1, p. 72], [2, p. 245]. From such a viewpoint, we have already proposed
replacement overtime in which the unit is replaced at the ﬁrst completion of working
cycles over a planned time T [3, p. 34, 8] .
This chapter summarizes optimum policies for age replacement overtime based
on our research works and adds some new results: In Sect.1.1, combining age
and random replacements, we introduce age replacement ﬁrst in which the unit is
replaced before failure at time T or at working cycle N, whichever occurs ﬁrst
[3, p. 28, 4–7]. We obtain the expected cost rate and derive optimum policy to min-
imize it. Using this result, we compare age replacement with time T and random
replacement with cycle N. It is theoretically shown that when both replacement
costs are the same, age replacement is better than random replacement, as previously
expected. The derived results and analytical methods in this section are fundamental
to all of those in this Lecture Note.
In Sect.1.2, we take up replacement overtime in which the unit is replaced before
failure at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles over a planned time T [3, p. 34, 8] .
The expected cost rate is obtained and an optimum time T ∗
O to minimize it is derived.
In Sect.1.3, we propose replacement overtime ﬁrst and compare replacement over-
time with age and random replacements discussed in Sect.1.1. It is shown that when
three replacement costs are the same, replacement overtime is better than random
replacement, however, age replacement is still best among these three policies. The
fact that replacement overtime is superior to random replacement would be interest-
ing theoretically and practically, because both preventive replacements are done at
random times.
In Sect.1.4, as one of extended models of replacement overtime, we propose
replacement overtime last in which the unit is replaced before failure at the ﬁrst
completion of working cycles over time T or at cycle N, whichever occurs last [3,
p. 46, 9] . The expected cost rate is obtained and an optimum policy to minimize it
is discussed. Furthermore, we compare replacement overtime last with replacement
overtime ﬁrst studied in Sect.1.3. It is of great interest that if a replacement time T is

less than an optimum T ∗
O then replacement overtime last is better than replacement
overtime ﬁrst, and conversely, if T is greater than T ∗
O then replacement overtime ﬁrst
is better than replacement overtime last. This means that if a speciﬁed replacement
time T is large, we should adopt replacement ﬁrst, and if it is small, we should adopt
replacement last.
Next, we consider replacement overtime for a ﬁnite interval S in Sect.1.5 [10]:
The expected cost rate is obtained, and the optimum policy to minimize it is derived.
It is shown that if a ﬁnite interval S is greater than an optimum time T ∗
A of age
replacement then there exists a ﬁnite replacement time which is less than S. When
S is not constant but a random variable, we make similar discussions. Furthermore,
optimum replacement policies for constant and random working cycle N are dis-
cussed in Sect.1.6. Finally, replacement overtime for a parallel system with n units
is considered and an optimum policy is derived analytically when the failure time is
exponential in Sect.1.7 [3, p. 141, 11] .
Throughout this Chapter, it is assumed that the unit has a failure distribution F(t)
with ﬁnite mean μ ≡
 ∞
0
F(t)dt < ∞, where Φ(t) ≡1 −Φ(t) for any distribution
Φ(t). When F(t) has a density function f (t) ≡dF(t)/dt, i.e., F(t) =
 t
0 f (u)du,
the failure rate h(t) ≡f (t)/F(t) for F(t) < 1 is supposed to increase strictly from
h(0) = 0 to h(∞) ≡limt→∞h(t), except that F(t) is exponential.
1.1 Age and Random Replacements
Suppose that a unit has to operate for a job with random working cycles Y j ( j =
1, 2, . . .) in Fig.1.1, where Y0 ≡0, Sj ≡Y1 + Y2 + · · · + Y j ( j = 1, 2, . . .) and
S0 ≡0. It is assumed that Y j are independent and have an identical distribution
G(t) ≡Pr{Y j ≤t} with ﬁnite mean 1/θ (0 < θ < ∞), where G( j)(t) ≡Pr{Y1 +
Y2 + · · · + Y j ≤t} ( j = 1, 2, . . .) is the j−fold Stieltjes convolution of G(t)
with itself and G(0)(t) ≡1 for t ≥0, and g( j)(t) ≡dG( j)(t)/dt ( j = 1, 2, . . .),
g(t) ≡dG(t)/dt and g(0)(t) ≡0.
As preventive replacement, the unit is planned to be replaced at time T (0 <
T ≤∞), at cycle N (N = 1, 2, . . .), or at failure, whichever occurs ﬁrst. This is
called age replacement ﬁrst [3, p. 42]. Then, the probability that the unit is replaced
at time T is
[1 −G(N)(T )]F(T ),

(1.5)
where cF = replacement cost at failure, cT = replacement cost at time T , and cN =
replacement cost at cycle N for any N ≥1 with cF > cT and cF > cN.

An optimum policy which minimizes CA(T ) is [1, p. 87], [2, p. 74]:

(i) If Q1(N) increases strictly to Q1(∞) and Q1(∞) > cF/[(cF −cN)μ], then
there exists a ﬁnite and unique minimum N ∗

.
(ii) If Q1(∞) ≤cF/[(cF −cN)μ], then N ∗
R = ∞, and the expected cost rate is
given in (1.9).
In particular, when G(t) = 1 −e−θt, i.e., G(N)(t) ≡∞
j=N[(θt) j/j!]e−θt (N =
0, 1, 2, . . .), from Appendix 2.1,
Q1(T, N) =

 T
0 (θt)Ne−θt F(t)dt
(1.12)
increases strictly with N to h(T ), and Q1(N) increases strictly to h(∞). Therefore,
if h(∞) > cF/[(cF −cN)μ], then a ﬁnite N ∗
R (1 ≤N ∗
R < ∞) satisfying (1.11)
exists.

Next, we discuss theoretically which policy is better to replace the unit at time T
or at cycle N. For this purpose, we ﬁnd both optimum T ∗
F and N ∗
F which minimize
the expected cost rate CF(T, N) in (1.5). Differentiating CF(T, N) with respect to
T and setting it equal to zero,

Thus, when cT ≤cN, there does not exist any ﬁnite N ∗

N−1
j=0 [(θt) j/j!]
(N = 1, 2, . . .),
which decreases with N to 0 from Appendix 1.1. Because Q1(T, N) increases with
N to h(T ), there exits a ﬁnite N ∗
F (1 ≤N ∗
F < ∞) which satisﬁes (1.16) for T > 0.
Furthermore, the left-hand side of (1.13) goes to
 ∞
0
[1 −G(N)(t)]F(t) {(cF −cT )[h(∞) −h(t)] + (cT −cN)[rN(t) −θ]} dt
(1.17)
as T →∞, because rN(T ) increases with T to θ. Therefore, if (1.17) is greater
than cT , then there exists a ﬁnite T ∗
F (0 < T ∗
F < ∞) which satisﬁes (1.13). It can be
clearly seen that if h(∞) = ∞, both ﬁnite T ∗
F and N ∗
F exist in case of cT > cN.
1.2 Replacement Overtime
It might be wise to replace an operating unit at the completion of some working
cycle even if T comes because it continues to operate for some job without stopping.
Suppose that the unit is replaced before failure at the ﬁrst completion of working
cycles Y j ( j = 1, 2, . . .) over a planned time T (0 ≤T < ∞). This is called age
replacement overtime.
The probability that the unit is replaced at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles
over time T is

From Appendix 1.4, when the failure rate h(t) increases strictly to h(∞), 
Q1(T ) also
increases strictly with T to h(∞), and decreases with θ to h(T ) for 0 ≤T < ∞.
An optimum policy which minimizes CO(T ) is [3, p. 36]
(i) If h(∞) > cF/[(cF −cO)μ], then there exists a ﬁnite and unique T ∗
O (0 < T ∗
O <

It is of great interest that when G(t) = 1 −e−θt, if h(∞) > cF/[(cF −ci)μ]
(i = T, N, O), the ﬁnite replacement times T ∗
A, N ∗
R and T ∗
O exist. Comparing (1.24)
with (1.7) when cO = cT , we obtain T ∗

O increases with θ to T ∗
A given
in (1.7).
1.3 Comparisons of Age and Random Replacements
Wecomparetheoreticallyreplacementovertimetoagereplacementpolicieswithtime
T (0 < T < ∞) and cycle N (N = 1, 2, . . .), respectively, when cT = cN = cO
and h(∞) = ∞. In this case, all of ﬁnite T ∗
A, N ∗
R and T ∗
O always exist. Furthermore,
because T ∗
A is an optimum solution of minimizing CA(T ) in (1.6), CO(T ∗
O) is greater
than CA(T ∗
A) in (1.8), i.e., age replacement is better than replacement overtime. If
cO < cT , then replacement overtime might be better rather than age replacement,
and we would compute numerically CA(T ∗
A) in (1.8) and CO(T ∗
O) in (1.25), and
compare them for different costs cF, cT and cO.
Next, we compare replacement overtime with random replacement. Generally, it
would be much difﬁcult to compare directly continuous replacement and discrete
replacement. For the above purpose, we propose the following extended model with
time T and cycle N to combine random replacement and overtime replacement,
which is called replacement overtime ﬁrst: The unit is replaced before failure at
cycle N (N = 1, 2, . . .) before time T (0 < T ≤∞) or at the ﬁrst completion of
working cycles over time T , whichever occurs ﬁrst. Then, the probability that the
unit is replaced at cycle N is

Therefore, if L1(N) > cO/(cF −cO), then there exists a ﬁnite and unique T ∗

OF < ∞) which satisﬁes (1.33), and the resulting cost rate is
COF(T ∗

Q1(T ∗

(1.34)
In addition, because the left-hand side of (1.33) increases with N to that of (1.24),
T ∗
OF decreases with N to T ∗
O given in (1.24). So that, from (1.34), optimum T ∗
OF and
N ∗
OF which minimize COF(T, N) is T ∗
OF = T ∗
O and N ∗
OF = ∞, i.e., replacement
overtime is better than random replacement.
We can show by another method that replacement overtime is better than ran-
dom replacement when both replacement costs are the same. From the inequality
COF(T, N + 1) −COF(T, N) ≥0,

OF = ∞.
From the above discussions, if cN ≥cO, then replacement overtime is better
than random replacement. However, if cN < cO, then random replacement might be
better rather than replacement overtime. In this case, we would compute numerically
CR(N ∗
R) in (1.10) and CO(T ∗
O) in (1.25), and compare them for different costs cN
and cO.
When F(t) = 1 −e−(t/10)2 and G(t) = 1 −e−t, Table1.1 presents optimum T ∗
A,
T ∗
O, N ∗
R and their expected cost rates. This indicates that when three replacement
costs are the same, CR(N ∗
R) > CO(T ∗
O) > CA(T ∗
A) and T ∗
O < T ∗
A, as shown in the
above results. This shows that T ∗
O and CO(T ∗
O) approach to T ∗
A and CA(T ∗
A) as ci/cF
is larger, N ∗
R/θ is roughly the same as T ∗
A, and also, T ∗
O < T ∗
A < T ∗
O +1/θ. So that, if
1/θ becomes smaller, both T ∗
O and N ∗
R/θ approach exactly to T ∗
A. On the other hand,
when replacement costs are not the same, for example, when cT /cF = 0.02 and
cO/cF = 0.01, CO(T ∗
O) < CA(T ∗
A), and when cO/cF = 0.02 and cN/cF = 0.01,
CR(N ∗
R) < CO(T ∗
O). However, even when replacement costs are different, if they
are large, the three policies are not so different.

From the above discussions, we get the following conclusions: When T is con-

conversely, if T < T ∗
O then we should adopt replacement overtime last.
In general, it would be much difﬁcult to compare theoretically replacement over-

then T ∗
S = S and the expected cost rate is given in (1.54). In other words, if a ﬁnite
interval S is less than optimum T ∗

replacement for a ﬁnite interval.
Next, suppose that S is a random variable with a general distribution L(t) ≡

1.6 Working Number
Suppose the the unit operates for a job with a speciﬁed number N (1 ≤N < ∞) of
working cycles. As preventive replacement, the unit is replaced before failure at the
ﬁrst completion of working cycles over time T before the Nth cycle [10].

1.7 Parallel System
We have considered until now only a one-unit system with a failure distribution F(t).
We could extend a one-unit system to redundant systems if their failure distributions
could be estimated statistically. For example, we consider a parallel system with n
units (n = 2, 3, . . .), whose failure distribution is F(t)n [3, p. 141, 11] . Then, by
replacing F(t) with F(t)n formally, the expected cost rates are rewritten as follows:

Chapter 2
Periodic Replacement Overtime
In this chapter, we suppose that the system is large and complex which consists of
many kinds of units, and it operates for a job with random working cycles introduced
in Chap.1. The system undergoes minimal repairs at failures [1, p.96], [2, p.95],
[3] and can be quickly resumed after minimal repairs. As preventive replacement
policies, the system is planned to be replaced at time T , at working cycle N or at
number K of failures.
In Sect.2.1, we suppose that the unit is replaced at time T or at working cycle N,
whichever occurs ﬁrst. Respective policies are called periodic replacement and ran-
dom replacement [4, p.53, 6–8] . The expected cost rates are obtained and optimum
T ∗
P and N ∗
R which minimize them are derived analytically. Furthermore, we compare
theoretically periodic replacement with time T and random replacement with cycle
N [9, 10]. It is shown that when both replacement costs for time T and cycle N are
the same, periodic replacement is better than random replacement.
In Sect.2.2, we propose periodic replacement overtime [4, p.66, 11] in which
the unit is replaced at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles over time T discussed in
Sect.1.2. Optimum replacement time T ∗
O which minimizes the expected cost rate is
derived analytically. In Sect.2.3, to compare random replacement with replacement
overtime, we take up replacement overtime ﬁrst in which the unit is replaced at cycle
N or over time T , whichever occurs ﬁrst. When both replacement costs for cycle N
and overtime T are the same, it is also shown that replacement overtime is better
than random replacement.
In Sect.2.4, we propose replacement overtime last in which the unit is replaced at
cycle N or over time T , whichever occurs last, and compare replacement overtime
ﬁrst and last. It is of interest that if replacement number N is less than some number
NO, then overtime last is better than overtime ﬁrst, and vice versa.
As one of modiﬁed replacement policies in Sect.2.5, we consider another overtime
replacement in which the unit is replaced at failure K or at the ﬁrst failure over time
T in order to operate continuously. Two overtime replacement ﬁrst and last policies
are considered, and optimum policies which minimize the expected cost rates are
discussed [8]. Finally, we take up preventive maintenance overtime in which the unit
undergoes imperfect preventive maintenance [4, p.171, 6] when it ﬁnishes each

work and is replaced at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles over time T . The
expected cost rates for two kinds of imperfect preventive maintenances are obtained.
Throughout this chapter, it is assumed that working cycles Y j are independent
and have an identical distribution G(t) ≡Pr{Y j ≤t} with ﬁnite mean 1/θ ≡

G(t)dt, G( j)(t) ( j = 1, 2, . . .) denotes the j−fold convolution of G(t) with
itself, G(0)(t) ≡1 for t ≥0, and M(t) ≡∞
j=1 G( j)(t). In addition, the unit has a
failure distribution F(t) with ﬁnite mean μ, a density function f (t) ≡dF(t)/dt, the
failure rate h(t) ≡f (t)/F(t), and the cumulative hazard rate H(t) ≡
 t
0 h(u)du,
which represents the expected number of failures in [0, t]. It is assumed that the
failure rate h(t) increases from h(0) = 0 to h(∞) ≡limt→∞h(t).
2.1 Periodic and Random Replacements
A new unit begins to operate at time 0 and undergoes minimal repairs at failures,
where the time for minimal repair is negligible. Suppose that the unit has to operate
for a job with random working cycles Y j ( j = 1, 2, . . .) deﬁned in Sect.1.1. As
preventive replacement, the unit is planned to be replaced at time T (0 < T ≤∞)
or at working cycle N (N = 1, 2, . . .), whichever occurs ﬁrst. This is called periodic
replacement ﬁrst. Then, the probability that the unit is replaced at cycle N is G(N)(T ),
and the probability that it is replaced at time T is 1 −G(N)(T ). Thus, the mean time
to replacement is

An optimum policy which minimizes CP(T ) is [1, p.102], [2, p.101]:

(2.3)
and the resulting cost rate is

(2.4)
(ii) If
 ∞

tdh(t) ≤cT /cM, then T ∗
P = ∞, i.e., the unit always undergoes minimal
repair at each failure, and the expected cost rate is
CP(∞) ≡lim
T →∞CP(T ) = cMh(∞).
(2.5)
When the unit is replaced only at cycle N, which is called periodic random

Thus, if H1(N) increases strictly to H1(∞), then the left-hand side of (2.7) increases
strictly with N. Therefore, an optimum policy which minimizes CR(N) is:

Periodic Replacement Overtime
(i) If H1(N) increases strictly to H1(∞) and

(2.8)
(ii) If

is given in (2.5).
When G(t) = 1 −e−θt, i.e., G(N)(t) = ∞

When F(t) = 1 −e−(t/10)2 and G(t) = 1 −e−t, Table2.1 presents optimum
T ∗

R, and their expected cost rates for ci/cM (i = T, N). This indicates that
optimum T ∗
P and N ∗
R increase with ci/cM (i = T, N), and T ∗
P ≥N ∗
R/θ, however,
they are almost the same, and when cT = cN, their cost rates are CP(T ∗

R).
When cN < cT , e.g., when cT = 0.2 and cN = 0.1, CP(T ∗

It was shown numerically that when both replacement costs are the same, periodic
replacement is better than random replacement. Next, we discuss theoretically which
policy is better to replace the unit at time T or at cycle N. For this purpose, we ﬁnd
optimum T ∗

Thus, when cT ≤cN, there does not exist any ﬁnite optimum N ∗
F for T > 0 because
H1(T, N) ≤h(T ), i.e., N ∗
F = ∞. In this case, the unit should be replaced only at
time T .
In particular, when G(t) = 1 −e−θt and cT > cN,
rN(T ) = θ(θT )N−1/(N −1)!
N−1
j=0 [(θT ) j/j!]
decreases strictly with N from θ to 0 and increases strictly with T from 0 to θ for

Appendix 1.1. Thus, because limN→∞H1(T, N) = h(T ), there exists a ﬁnite
N ∗
F (1 ≤N ∗
F < ∞) which satisﬁes (2.11) for T > 0. Furthermore, the left-hand

as T →∞.Therefore,if

then there exists a ﬁnite T ∗
F (0 < T ∗
F < ∞) which satisﬁes (2.9). It can be clearly
seen that if h(∞) = ∞, both ﬁnite T ∗
F and N ∗
F exist in case of cT > cN.
On the other hand, suppose that the unit is replaced at time T or at cycle N,
whichever occurs last. This is called periodic replacement last. Because the proba-
bility that the unit is replaced at cycle N is 1 −G(N)(T ), and the probability that it
is replaced at time T is G(N)(T ), the mean time to replacement is

in (2.6), and
CL(T, 0) ≡lim
N→0 CL(T, N) = CF(T, ∞) = CP(T )
in (2.2). We could make similar discussions of deriving optimum policies to minimize
the expected cost rate CL(T, N) in (2.14).
2.2 Replacement Overtime
Suppose that the unit is replaced at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles Y j ( j =
1, 2, . . .) over time T (0 ≤T ≤∞), which has been introduced in Sect.1.2. Then,
the mean time to replacement is

might be better than replacement overtime, and replacement overtime might be better

2.3 Comparisons of Periodic and Random Replacements
Compare theoretically replacement overtime to periodic and random replacements
with time T (0 < T ≤∞) and cycle N (N = 1, 2, . . .) when cT = cN = cR = cO
and h(∞) = ∞. In this case, ﬁnite T ∗
P, N ∗
R and T ∗
O always exist. In addition, because
T ∗
P is an optimum solution of minimizing CP(T ) in (2.2), CO(T ∗
O) is greater than
CP(T ∗
P) from (2.22), i.e., periodic replacement is better than replacement overtime.
If cO < cT then replacement overtime might be rather than periodic replacement.
In this case, we could compute numerically CP(T ∗
P) in (2.4) and CO(T ∗
O) in (2.22),
and compare them.
We have already compared numerically random replacement and replacement
overtime in Tables2.1 and 2.2. Next, we compare theoretically random replacement
and replacement overtime. For this purpose, we propose the following extended
replacement with time T and cycle N, which is called replacement overtime ﬁrst:
The unit is replaced at cycle N (N = 1, 2, . . .) or over time T , whichever occurs
ﬁrst. Then, the probability that the unit is replaced at cycle N is G(N)(T ), and the
probability that it is replaced over time T is 1 −G(N)(T ), where it is counted as
replacement done over time T when the Nth working cycle occurs over time T .
Then, the mean time to replacement is

It can be clearly seen that COF(∞, N) = CR(N) in (2.6) and COF(T, ∞) = CO(T )
in (2.17).
When G(t) = 1 −e−θt (0 < θ < ∞), i.e., G(N)(t) = ∞
j=N[(θt) j/j!]e−θt, and
cO = cN, (2.25) is rewritten as

(2.26)
We discuss optimum T ∗
OF and N ∗
OF which minimize COF(T, N). In particular, when
N = 1, COF(T, 1) = CR(1), and hence, T ∗
OF = ∞. For N ≥2, differentiating

then there exists a ﬁnite and unique T ∗

(2.28)
In addition, because the left-hand side of (2.27) increases with N, T ∗

OF and N ∗

which the unit is replaced at cycle N before time T in Sect.2.3. Next, we propose
replacement overtime last in which the unit is replaced at cycle N or over time
T , whichever occurs last. The probability that the unit is replaced at cycle N is

2.5 Replacement Overtime with Number of Failures
The unit is replaced at periodic times in standard periodic replacement as shown
in Sect.2.1. However, some units should be replaced when they have failed rather
than a planned time [2, p.104] in order to operate continuously without stopping.
This section proposes two policies with the number of failures in which the unit is
replaced at a planned number K of failures or over time T , whichever occurs ﬁrst or
last.
It is assumed that the unit undergoes minimal repair between replacements. Then,
failures occur at a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with mean value function H(t),
i.e., the probability that j failures occur exactly in [0, t] is p j(t) ≡[H(t) j/j!]e−H(t)
( j = 0, 1, 2, . . .) [5, p.27], and the probability that more than j failures occur in
[0, t] is ∞
i= j pi(t) = Pj(t) and P j(t) ≡1 −Pj(t) =  j−1
i=0 pi(t). Note that
p0(t) = e−H(t) = F(t) = P1(t), Pj(0) = 0, P j(0) = 1, P0(t) = 1, and P0(t) = 0.
2.5.1 Replacement Overtime First with Number of Failures
Suppose that the unit is replaced at failure K (K = 1, 2, . . .) or at the ﬁrst failure
over time T (0 ≤T ≤∞), whichever occurs ﬁrst, i.e., it is replaced either at failure
K before time T or over time T before failure K.
The probability that the unit is replaced at failure K is ∞
j=K p j(T ) = PK (T ),
and the probability that it is replaced over time T is K−1
j=0 p j(T ) = P K (T ). Thus,
the expected number of failure until replacement is
K PK (T ) +

(2.38)

2.5 Replacement Overtime with Number of Failures
47
where note that any failure at replacement is always counted. Because the probability
that some failure occurs in (u, u + du] for u > t, given that a failure have occurred
at time t is f (u)du/F(t) [2, p.96], the mean time to replacement is

(2.39)
which agrees with (2.38) when H(t) = t, i.e., h(t) = 1.
Therefore, the expected cost rate is

(2.40)
where cO = replacement cost over time T , cK = replacement cost at failure K, and
cM = minimal repair cost at each failure. In particular, when T = ∞, i.e., the unit
is replaced only at failure K, the expected cost rate is, from [2, p.106],
C(K) ≡lim

(2.43)

whose left-hand side increases strictly with T from 0 to

Therefore, we have the following optimum policy:
(i) If

tdh(t) > cO/cM, then there exists a ﬁnite and unique T ∗
O (0 < T ∗
O < ∞)
which satisﬁes (2.47), and the resulting cost rate is

O) = cM Q(T ∗
O).
(2.48)
(ii) If
 ∞
0
tdh(t) ≤cO/cM, then T ∗
O = ∞, and the expected cost rate is given in
(2.46).
It can be easily seen that when h(∞) = ∞, a ﬁnite T ∗
O (0 < T ∗
O < ∞) always exits.
When F(t) = 1−e−(t/10)2, Table2.3 presents optimum K ∗, T ∗
O and their expected
cost rates. This indicates that optimum K ∗and T ∗
O increase with ci/cM (i = K, O)
and COF(T ∗
O) < C(K ∗). In this case, the mean time to replacement to the K ∗th
failure is μK ∗= 1/

Next, we derive optimum T ∗

F, K) = cM Q(T ∗

(2.50)
Furthermore, noting that T ∗

Therefore, if T > T ∗

Next, the unit is replaced at failure K (K = 1, 2, . . .) or at the ﬁrst failure over

2.7 Preventive Maintenance Overtime
When the unit ﬁnishes each work of a job, we do some preventive maintenance (PM)
which is imperfect [2, p.171], [6]. It is assumed that the PM is done at the completion
of successive working cycles Y j and let b j denotes the imperfect PM factor after the

2.7 Preventive Maintenance Overtime
57
jth PM. The failure rate after the ﬁrst PM becomes b1h(t) when it was h(t) before
PM, i.e., the unit has the failure rate B jh(t) during ( j + 1)th working cycle, where
1 ≡b0 < b1 ≤b2 ≤· · · , B j =  j
i=0 bi ( j = 0, 1, . . .) and 1 = B0 < B1 < B2 · · ·
[2, p.194].
Suppose that the unit is replaced at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles Y j ( j =
1, 2, . . .) over time T (0 ≤T < ∞) introduced in Sect.2.2. The mean time to
replacement and the expected number of failures before replacement for perfect PM
have been derived in (2.15) and (2.16), respectively. Because the unit has the failure
rate B jh(t) during the ( j + 1)th working cycle, the expected number of failures
before replacement in (2.16) is rewritten as

where M(T ) ≡∞
j=1 G( j)(T ), cP = PM cost for the completion of each cycle with
cP ≤cO, and cM and cO are given in (2.17).
In particular, when G(t) = 1 −e−θt,

(2.80)
which agrees with (2.20) when B j ≡1 and cP ≡0.
We ﬁnd optimum T ∗
B which minimizes COM(T ). Differentiating COM(T ) with
respect to T and setting it equal to zero,

Next, it is assumed that when the PM is done at the jth working cycle, the age

(1 −a j)t units younger after each PM, where A j ≡ j
i=0 ai ( j = 0, 1, 2, . . .) and
1 = A0 > A1 > · · · . Then, replacing B j H(t) in (2.79) with H(A jt), the expected

Chapter 3
Inspection Overtime
Most systems such as standby electric generators and defense systems, and some
units in complex and large-scale systems such as aircrafts and industry plants, have
to be checked at suitable times to search their faults and to detect their failures. This is
called inspection policy, which plays an important role in reliability theory. Optimum
policies which minimize the total expected cost until failure detection were derived
[1, p. 107] and were summarized [2, p. 201]. Some industry and computer systems
execute successive jobs and process. For such systems, it would be impossible or
impractical to make maintenances in a strict periodic fashion. From such a viewpoint,
random inspection policies in which a unit is checked at some completion of working
times were introduced and their optimum policies were discussed analytically and
numerically [3, p. 87, 6–9] .
Referring to the above reliability models, we ﬁrst consider the standard periodic
and random inspection policies in Sect.3.1. Next, when the failure time is exponen-
tial, we take up inspection ﬁrst and inspection last [3, p. 101, 10] , and derive their
optimum policies in Sect.3.2. Furthermore, combining periodic and random policies,
we propose inspection overtime in which a unit is checked at the ﬁrst completion
of working times over time T in Sect.3.3, and compare it with the other inspection
policies [3, p. 108, 10] . Finally, applying such inspection policies to a backup policy
in which failures are detected immediately and the backup recovery is executed until
the latest checking time, all results of inspection policies are rewritten for periodic
and random backup in Sect.3.5 and for backup overtime in Sect.3.6 [3, p. 115, 11,
12] . Furthermore, we try to form general inspection ﬁrst and last with n variables,
obtain their expected costs, and derive optimum polices which minimize them when
the failure time is exponential in Sect.3.5.
Throughout this chapter, we suppose that a unit has a failure distribution F(t)
with ﬁnite μ ≡
 ∞
0
F(t)dt < ∞, where Φ(t) ≡1−Φ(t) for any distribution. After
Sect.2.2, the unit is assumed to have an exponential distribution F(t) = 1 −e−λt
(0 < λ < ∞).

(3.13)
This indicates that optimum T ∗satisﬁes (3.13) at ﬁrst and increases with 1/λ from 0,
becomes equal to a solution of (3.12) when 1/λ = 1/θ, and after that, satisﬁes (3.7)

3.2 Inspection First and Last
As modiﬁed inspection policies, we propose the following two policies of inspec-
tion ﬁrst and inspection last, and derive optimum policies which minimize the total
expected costs and compare them [3, p. 101, 10] .
3.2.1 Inspection First
Suppose that the unit is checked at time T (0 < T ≤∞) or at a random working
time Y j ( j = 1, 2, . . .), whichever occurs ﬁrst, where Y j has an identical distribution
G(t) ≡Pr{Y j ≤t}. In this case, Z j ≡min{T, Y j} forms a renewal process with an
interarrival distribution Pr{Z j ≤t} = G(t) for t < T , 1 for t ≥T .
It is assumed that the failure time has an exponential distribution F(t) = 1−e−λt.
Then, the probability that the unit does not fail and is checked at time T is
G(T )F(T ),
(3.20)
the probability that it does not fail and is checked at time Y j is
 T
0
F(t)dG(t),
(3.21)
the probability that it fails and its failure is detected at time T is
G(T )F(T ),
(3.22)
and the probability that it fails and its failure is detected at time Y j is
 T
0
F(t)dG(t),
(3.23)
where note that (3.20)+(3.21)+(3.22)+(3.23)=1.

3.2 Inspection First and Last

From (3.20)–(3.23), the mean downtime lD from failure to its detection is given
by a renewal equation

By solving the above renewal equation and arranging it,

(3.24)
In a similar way, the expected number MT of checks at time T until failure detection
is given by a renewal equation
MT = (1 + MT )G(T )F(T ) + MT
 T

F(t)dG(t) + G(T )F(T ),
i.e.,

(3.30)
which agrees with C(∞) in (3.6). This policy includes periodic and random inspec-
tions discussed in Sect.3.1.
We ﬁnd optimum T ∗

Differentiating CF(T ) with respect to T and setting it equal to zero,

λ
θ(θ + λ)(1 −e−θT ) = cT

(3.33)

3.2.2 Inspection Last
Suppose that the unit is checked at time T (0 ≤T < ∞) or at random working

a renewal process with an interarrival distribution Pr{Z j ≤t} = 0 for t < T , and
G(t) for t ≥T .
It is assumed that the failure time has an exponential distribution F(t) = 1−e−λt.

optimum T ∗

L ≥TL for cR ≥cT and T ∗
L < TL for
cR < cT . Comparing (3.44) and (3.9), we have T > T ∗

the left-hand side of (3.44) decreases with 1/θ from that of (3.9), TL increases with
1/θ from T ∗

3.2.3 Comparison of Inspection First and Last
We compare optimum policies for inspection ﬁrst and last when F(t) = 1 −e−λt,
G(t) = 1 −e−θt and cT = cR. In this case, the expected cost of inspection ﬁrst is,
from (3.28),
CF(T ) =
cT + (cD/θ)(1 −e−θT )
[λ/(θ + λ)][1 −e−(θ+λ)T ] −cD
λ ,
(3.45)
optimum T ∗
F satisﬁes (3.33), and the resulting cost is, from (3.32),
CF(T ∗
F) = cD
λ (eλT ∗
F −1).
(3.46)
The expected cost of inspection last is, from (3.42)
CL(T ) =
cT + (cD/θ)(θT + e−θT )
1 −e−λT + [λ/(θ + λ)]e−(θ+λ)T −cD
λ ,
(3.47)
optimum T ∗
L which minimizes it is given in (3.44), and the resulting cost is
CL(T ∗
L ) = cD
λ (eλT ∗
L −1).
(3.48)
Noting that CF(T ∗
F) = CL(T ∗
L ) = CS(T ∗
S ) when T ∗
F = T ∗
L = T ∗
S , which means
that the sizes of optimum checking times determine whether the inspection policies
could save cost or not. By comparing (3.9) and (3.33),
1
λ[eλT −(1 + λT )] >
1
θ + λ(eλT −1) −
λ
θ(θ + λ)(1 −e−θT ),

70
3
Inspection Overtime
which follows that T ∗
F > T ∗
S and T ∗
F decreases with 1/θ to T ∗
S . Similarly, by com-
paring (3.9) and (3.44), T ∗
L > T ∗
S and T ∗
L increases with 1/θ from T ∗
S . Therefore,
periodic inspection is better than both inspection ﬁrst and last when cT = cR.
Next, we compare inspection ﬁrst and last. Let
Q(T ) ≡θ
λ[eλT −(1 + λT )] −
λ
θ + λe−θT
−
θ
θ + λ(eλT −1) +
λ
θ + λ(1 −e−θT )
= θ
λ[eλT −(1 + λT )] +
λ
θ + λ(1 −2e−θT ) −
θ
θ + λ(eλT −1), (3.49)
which increases strictly with T from −λ/(θ + λ) to ∞. Thus, there exists a ﬁnite
and unique TI (0 < TI < ∞) which satisﬁes Q(T ) = 0. Therefore, from (3.44) and
(3.33), if
L(TI) ≡
θ
θ + λ(eλTI −1) −
λ
θ + λ(1 −e−θTI ) <
cT
cD/θ,
then T ∗
F < T ∗
L , and hence, inspection ﬁrst is better than inspection last, and con-
versely, if L(TI) > cT /(cD/θ), then T ∗
L < T ∗
F, and hence, inspection last is better
than inspection ﬁrst. Because Q(T ) increases with θ, TI decreases with θ to 0, i.e.,
TI increases with 1/θ from 0.
In addition, because T ∗
F decreases to T ∗
S and T ∗
L increases from T ∗
S with 1/θ, T ∗
F
becomes equal to T ∗
L at some 1/θI (0 < θI < ∞). This 1/θI is computed by solving
two simultaneous equations of T and 1/θ for given cT /cD: From (3.33) and (3.44),
1
θ + λ(eλT −1) −
λ
θ(θ + λ)(1 −e−θT ) = cT
cD
,
1
λ[eλT −(1 + λT )] −
λ
θ(θ + λ)e−θT = cT
cD
.
When 1/θI is obtained, it can be shown that if 1/θ > 1/θI, then replacement ﬁrst is
better than replacement last, and vice versa.
Table3.1 presents optimum T ∗
F, T ∗
L and TI, 1/θI, L(TI)/θ for cT /cD and 1/θ
when 1/λ = 1. This indicates that T ∗
F decreases with 1/θ to T ∗
S and T ∗
L increases
with 1/θ from T ∗
S and both T ∗
F and T ∗
L increase with cT /cD. When cT /cD is small,
i.e., L(TI)/θ < cT /cD, T ∗
F < T ∗
L and inspection ﬁrst is better than inspection last.
Conversely, when cT /cD is large, i.e., L(TI)/θ > cT /cD, T ∗
L < T ∗
F and inspection
last is better than inspection ﬁrst. Furthermore, 1/θI increases with cT /cD, and
inspection ﬁrst is better than inspection last if 1/θ > 1/θI. For example, when
cT /cD = 0.050, 1/θI = 0.298. So that, if 1/θ > 0.298 then inspection ﬁrst is better
than inspection last, and conversely, if 1/θ < 0.298 then inspection last is better than
inspection ﬁrst. In particular, when 1/θ = 1/θI, T ∗
F = T ∗
L and two policies are the
same. Because 1/θI increases with cT /cD, when cT /cD is large, inspection last is

3.3 Inspection Overtime
Suppose that the unit is checked at the ﬁrst completion of working times over time
T (0 ≤T < ∞) when F(t) = 1 −e−λt and G(t) = 1 −e−θt. Such inspection
procedures continue to be done until failure detection, which is called inspection

Table3.2 presents optimum T ∗
O and cO/cD for 1/θ, cT /cD and cO/cD when
F(t) = 1 −e−t. Optimum T ∗
O and cO/cD increase with cT /cD and decrease with
1/θ. Compared to Table3.1, T ∗
O < T ∗
S < T ∗
O + 1/θ. This indicates that cO/cD
approaches to cT /cD as cT /cD becomes larger. In other words, if cT (= cO) becomes
higher, then T ∗
O and T ∗
S become larger, and both inspection overtime and periodic
inspection are almost the same. That is, the checking cost for inspection overtime
approaches to that for periodic inspection because two inspections are coincident
with each other. If T ∗
O + 1/θ ≥T ∗
S + cT /cD, then there does not exist any positive
cO, i.e., inspection overtime cannot be better than periodic inspection.
3.4 General Failure Times
In general, we cannot use the same technique to analyze inspection ﬁrst, inspection
last and inspection overtime, when the failure time is not exponential, because only
an exponential distribution has a memoryless property [4, p. 13]. For a general failure
time, we consider a random inspection in which the unit is checked at random times
Y j ( j = 1, 2, . . .) with G(t) ≡Pr{Y j ≤t} and mean 1/θ ≡
 ∞
0
G(t)dt. Then, the
expected cost has been already given in (3.4).
First, consider inspection ﬁrst in which the unit is checked at times T or Y j,
whichever occurs ﬁrst. Then, by setting Z j ≡min{T, Y j}, it has a distribution
G F(t) ≡Pr{Z j ≤t} =

which agrees with (3.27) when cR = cT and F(t) = 1 −e−λt.
Next, consider inspection last in which the unit is checked at times T or Y j,
whichever occurs last. Then, setting Z j ≡max{T, Y j}, it has a distribution

costs and to discuss optimum policies.
3.5 Periodic and Random Backup
Suppose that the unit is checked at successive random times Sj ( j = 1, 2, . . .), and
also at periodic times kT (k = 1, 2, . . .) for a speciﬁed T > 0 in Fig.3.1. Any
failure can be detected immediately, and then the backup recovery is executed until
the latest checking time to restore the system consistency. The process ends at the
backup recovery and starts newly from this checking point [5, p. 123].
We introduce the following costs for the above process: When a failure occurs
at time t between kT and (k + 1)T or Sj+1, the backup recovery is executed from
the failure time t to the latest checking time kT . This incurs a loss cost cD(t −kT )
which includes all costs resulting from the working time from kT to t and the backup
recovery from t to kT . On the other hand, when a failure occurs at time t between
Sj and (k + 1)T or Sj+1, this incurs a loss cost cD(t −Sj). Costs cT and cR are
the same, and also, the other assumptions are the same in inspection policy of the
previous sections.

some failure is

In particular, when Y j ≡∞, i.e., G(t) ≡0 for any t ≥0, the unit is checked only

Suppose that the unit is checked at the ﬁrst completion of working times over time

continues until the unit fails and its recovery completion is done at the latest checking

Therefore, from (3.76) and (3.77), the total expected cost until backup recovery
is

Chapter 4
Replacement Overtime with Three Variables
In Chaps.1 and 2, we have considered several replacement policies in which the unit
is replaced at time T or at cycle N, and at time T or at failure K. In this chapter,
we propose modiﬁed replacement policies with three variables in which the unit is
replaced at time T , and at cycle N, or at failure K: In Sect.4.1, the classical approach
of whichever occurs ﬁrst and the newly proposed approach of whichever occurs last
[1] are employed into modeling. Furthermore, we propose a new replacement policy
in which the unit is replaced at time T , at cycle N, or at failure K, whichever occurs
middle [2]. For example, the unit is replaced at time T in case of {tN < T < tK } or
{tK < T < tN}, there tN and tK are denoted by the respective occurrence times of
cycle N and failure K.
In Sect.4.2, the unit is supposed to be replaced at the ﬁrst completion of working
cycle over time T , at cycle N, or at failure K, whichever occurs ﬁrst and last.
Furthermore, in Sect.4.3, when the unit is replaced at the ﬁrst failure over time
T , the same replacement policies are considered. For the above four replacement
policies, the expected cost rates are obtained.
In Sect.4.4, as modiﬁed replacement policies, we propose three policies in which
the unit is replaced at times of max{tN, tK } before time T or at times of min{tN, tK }
after time T . For such replacement policy, we consider two overtime policies in which
the unit is replaced at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles and at the ﬁrst failure
over time T . Finally, in Sect.4.5, we propose general replacement ﬁrst and last in
which the unit is replaced before failure at time T or at n random times, whichever
occurs ﬁrst and last. We obtain the expected cost rates and derive optimum times to
minimize them. By combining variously and giving concretely them, we could make
a variety of multi-replacement polices.
Unfortunately, we cannot analyze theoretically optimum policies which minimize
the expected cost rates for different replacement costs. However, it would be possible
to compute numerically optimum policies by estimating statistically replacement
costs and ﬁtting distributions. In addition, the proposed replacement models with
three variables would show new theoretical research subjects to students, researchers

and engineers. Furthermore, the proposed replacement policies could be applied into
more complex systems by suitable modiﬁcations and extensions. Throughout this
chapter, we use the same notations as those in Chaps.1 and 2.
4.1 Replacement with Three Variables
Suppose that a unit is replaced at a planned time T , at a number N of working
cycles, and at a number K of failures, and we count the number of failures when the
unit is replaced at failure K for the simplicity of discussions. Then, we consider the
following replacement policies which combine three replacements with T , N and
K, and discuss optimum policies with the same replacement costs.
(1) Replacement First
A unit is replaced at time T (0 < T ≤∞), at cycle N (N = 1, 2, . . .), or at failure
K (K = 1, 2, . . .), whichever occurs ﬁrst, where tN and tK are denoted by the
respective occurrence times at a number of N cycles and at a number of K failures
introduced in Chap.2, i.e., it is replaced at min{T, tN, tK }. Then, the probability that
the unit is replaced at time T is
[1 −G(N)(T )]P K (T ),
(4.1)
the probability that it is replaced at cycle N is
 T
0
P K (t)dG(N)(t),
(4.2)
the probability that it is replaced at failure K is
 T
0
[1 −G(N)(t)]dPK (t),
(4.3)
where (4.1)+(4.2)+(4.3)=1. The mean time to replacement is

where agrees with (4.4) when H(t) = t, i.e., h(t) = 1.
Therefore, the expected cost rate is

(4.6)
where cT = replacement cost for time T , cN = replacement cost for cycle N,
cK = replacement cost for failure K, and cM = minimal repair cost for each failure.
Clearly, CF(T, N, ∞) = CF(T, N) in (2.1).
(2) Replacement Last
A unit is replaced at time T (0 ≤T < ∞), at cycle N (N = 0, 1, 2, . . .), or at failure
K (K = 0, 1, 2, . . .), whichever occurs last, i.e., it is replaced at max{T, tN, tK }.
Then, the probability that the unit is replaced at time T is
G(N)(T )PK (T ),
(4.7)
the probability that it is replaced at cycle N is

CL(0, N, 0) = CF(∞, N, ∞) = CR(N) in (2.6),
CL(0, 0, K) = CF(∞, ∞, K) = C(K) in (2.41).
(3) Replacement Middle
A unit is replaced at time T (0 ≤T ≤∞), at cycle N (N = 0, 1, 2, . . .), or at
failure K (K = 0, 1, 2, . . .), whichever occurs middle, i.e., it is replaced at time T
in case of {tN < T < tK } or {tK < T < tN}, at cycle N in case of {T < tN < tK }
or {tK < tN < T }, and at failure K in case of {T < tK < tN} or {tN < tK < T }.
Then, the probability that the unit is replaced at time T is: In case of tN < T < tK ,
G(N)(T )P K (T ),
(4.13)

Clearly,
CM(0, N, K) = CF(∞, N, K),
CM(T, 0, K) = CF(T, ∞, K),
CM(T, N, 0) = CF(T, N, ∞),
CM(∞, N, K) = CL(0, N, K),
CM(T, ∞, K) = CL(T, 0, K),
CM(T, N, ∞) = CL(T, N, 0).
(4) Optimum Policies
We discuss optimum policies which minimize the expected cost rates when cT =
cN = cK andh(t)increasesstrictlywitht fromh(0) = 0toh(∞) = ∞.First,weﬁnd
optimum T ∗
F which minimizes CF(T, N, K) in (4.6). Differentiating CF(T, N, K)
with respect to T and setting it equal to zero,
 T
0
[1 −G(N)(t)]P K (t)[h(T ) −h(t)]dt = cT
cM
,
(4.22)
whose left-hand side increases strictly with T from 0 to ∞. Thus, there exists a ﬁnite
and unique T ∗
F (0 < T ∗
F < ∞) which satisﬁes (4.22), and the resulting cost rate is
CF(T ∗
F, N, K) = cMh(T ∗
F).
(4.23)
Furthermore, note that T ∗
F decreases with N and K, because the left-hand side
of (4.22) increases with N and K. Therefore, from (4.23), optimum policy which
minimizes CF(T, N, K) is T ∗
F = T ∗given in (2.3) and N = K = ∞, i.e., the unit
should be replaced only at time T ∗.
Next, we ﬁnd optimum T ∗
L which minimizes CL(T, N, K) in (4.12). Differenti-
ating CL(T, N, K) with respect to T and setting it equal to zero,
 T

(4.24)
whose left-hand side increases strictly with T from −

to ∞. Thus, there exists a ﬁnite and unique T ∗
L (0 < T ∗
L < ∞) which satisﬁes (4.24),
and the resulting cost rate is
CL(T ∗
L , N, K) = cMh(T ∗
L ).
(4.25)

4.1 Replacement with Three Variables
91
Furthermore, note that T ∗
L increases with N and K, because the left-hand side of
(4.24) decreases with N and K. Therefore, from (4.25), optimum policy which
minimizes CL(T, N, K) is T ∗
L = T ∗given in (2.3) and N = K = 0, i.e., the
unit should be replaced only at T ∗.
Finally, we ﬁnd optimum T ∗
M which minimizes CM(T, N, K) in (4.21). Differ-
entiating CM(T, N, K) with respect to T and setting it equal to zero,
 T

whose left-hand side increases strictly with T from −

to ∞. Thus, there exists a ﬁnite and unique T ∗
M (0 < T ∗
M < ∞) which satisﬁes (4.26),
and the resulting cost rate is
CM(T ∗
M, N, K) = cMh(T ∗
M).
(4.27)
Furthermore, noting that from (2.3) and (4.26),
 T

[h(T ) −h(t)]dt −
 T

[1 −G(N)(t)PK (t)][h(T −h(t))]dt

 ∞
T
[1 −G(N)(t)]P K (t)[h(t) −h(T )]dt ≥0,
whose inequality becomes equal to 0 as {N = 0, K = ∞} or {N=∞, K=0}.
Therefore, optimum T ∗
M takes a small value T ∗when {N = 0, K = ∞} or
{N = ∞, K = 0}, i.e., the unit should be replaced only at T ∗given in (2.3).
The above results show that when all replacement costs are the same, standard
periodic replacement is better than replacement ﬁrst, last and middle. However, if
replacement costs for cycle N and failure K would be lower than that for time T ,
replacement ﬁrst, last and middle might be better than the standard replacement.
4.2 Replacement Overtime with Working Cycle
Suppose that a unit is replaced at the ﬁrst completion of working cycles over time
T to be denoted as tO (tO > T ), at a number N of working cycles, and at a number
K of failures, and the unit is replaced over time T when the Nth working cycle has

policies which minimize them when all replacement costs are the same.

Clearly, COL(T, N, 0) = COL(T, N) in (2.31).
(3) Optimum Policies
We derive optimum policies which minimize the expected cost rates of replace-
ment overtime when cO = cN = cK , G(t) = 1 −e−θt (0 < θ < ∞) and h(t)
increases strictly with t from h(0) = 0 to h(∞) = ∞. Then, the expected cost rate
COF(T, N, K) in (4.30) is rewritten as
COF(T, N, K) =
cO + cM{
 T
0 [1 −G(N)(t)]P K (t)h(t)dt
+ [1 −G(N)(T )]P K (T )
 ∞

e−θth(t + T )dt}
 T
0 [1 −G(N)(t)]P K (t)dt + [1 −G(N)(T )](1/θ)P K (T )
,
(4.34)
where G(N)(t) = ∞
j=N[(θt) j/j!]e−θt (N = 0, 1, 2, . . .). Differentiating COF
(T, N, K) with respect to T and setting it equal to zero,

(4.35)
whose left-hand side increases strictly with T from 0 to ∞. Thus, there exits a ﬁnite
and unique T ∗
OF (0 < T ∗
OF < ∞) which satisﬁes (4.35), and the resulting cost rate is
COF(T ∗
OF, N, K) = cM
 ∞

θe−θth(t + T ∗
OF)dt.
(4.36)
Furthermore, note that T ∗
OF decreases with N and K, because the left-hand side
of (4.35) increases with N and K. Therefore, from (4.36), optimum policy which
minimizes COF(T, N, K) is T ∗
OF = T ∗
O given in (2.21) and N = K = ∞, i.e., the
unit should be replaced only over time T ∗
O.

OL < ∞) which satisﬁes
(4.38), and the resulting cost rate is
COL(T ∗
OL, N, K) = cM
 ∞
0
θe−θth(t + T ∗
OL)dt.
(4.39)
Furthermore, note that T ∗
OL increases with N and K, because the left-hand side
of (4.38) decreases with N and K. Therefore, from (4.39), optimum policy which
minimizes COL(T, N, K) is T ∗
OL = T ∗
O given in (2.21) and N = K = 0, i.e., the unit
should be replaced only over time T ∗
O.
The above results show that when all replacement costs are the same, replacement
overtime in Sect.2.2 is better than replacement overtime ﬁrst and last.
4.3 Replacement Overtime with Failure Number
Suppose that a unit is replaced at the ﬁrst failure over time T , at a number N of
working cycles and at a number K of failures, and the unit is replaced at failure K
when the Kth failure has just occurred over time T .
(1) Replacement Overtime First
A unit is replaced over time T (0 ≤T < ∞), at cycle N (N = 1, 2, . . .) or at failure
K (K = 1, 2, . . .), whichever occurs ﬁrst. The probabilities that the unit is replaced
over time T , at cycle N and at failure K are given in (4.1)–(4.3). The mean time to
replacement is

A unit is replaced over time T (0 ≤T < ∞), at cycle N (N = 0, 1, 2, . . .) or at
failure K (K = 0, 1, 2, . . .), whichever occurs last. The probabilities that the unit is

4.4 Modiﬁed Replacement with Three Variables
As modiﬁed replacement policies with three variables, we propose the following two
policies in which the unit is replaced at max{tN, tK } before time T or at min{tN, tK }
after time T .
(1) Replacement with Time T
The unit is replaced at max{tN, tK } before time T (0 ≤T ≤∞) or is replaced at
min{tN, tK } after time T . Furthermore, if either the Nth working cycle is completed
or the Kth failure occurs before time T , the unit is replaced at time T . This policy
corresponds to replacement middle in (3) of Sect.4.1.
(2) Replacement Over Time T
In the previous modiﬁed (1), if either the Nth working cycle is completed or the Kth
failure occurs before time T , the unit is replaced at the ﬁrst completion of working
cycles over time T . The probabilities that the unit is replaced at time T , at cycle N,
and at failure K are given in (4.13)–(4.18). The mean time to replacement is

4.5 General Replacement Policies
We extend replacement policies with three variables to n (n = 1, 2, . . .) variables:
The unit is replaced before failure at time T (0 < T ≤∞) or at random times
Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn, each of which has a general distribution Gi(t) ≡Pr{Yi < t} with
ﬁnite mean 1/θi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n). Let ci (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be the replacement cost
at random times Yi with ci < cF.
(1) Replacement First
Suppose that the unit is replaced at time T or at Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn, whichever occurs
ﬁrst. Then, the probability that the unit is replaced at time T is
