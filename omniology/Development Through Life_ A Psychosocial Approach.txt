Preface
T
he first edition of Development Through Life was 
published in 1975. Since that time, the science of 
human development and changes in longevity have 
converged to create a remarkable revision of our understand-
ing of the life course including new insights about the pre-
natal period and infancy, new ideas about the transition from 
adolescence to adulthood, and new views about aging.
Today, the years of infancy and childhood comprise a 
smaller percentage of the life span than was the case in 1975. 
At the same time, researchers have looked in much greater 
detail at the prenatal stage as a dynamic period when learn-
ing begins, the environment impacts the developmental tra-
jectory, and conditions of pregnancy infl uence fetal growth. 
Research on infant development, particularly development 
in the fi rst days and weeks of life, has fl ourished and resulted 
in a greater appreciation for the cognitive and sensory ca-
pacities of the newborn. The expanding fi eld of evolutionary 
psychology has shed new light on the adaptive capacities of 
infants and the features of the parent-infant relationship that 
contribute to survival and long-term growth.
The application of developmental systems theory has pro-
vided many new insights into the way change occurs. We 
view development as a product of the interaction of many lev-
els at once, each potentially altering the other. For example, 
at the macro level, the resources of parents, their workplace, 
and their extended family relationships may all contribute 
to prenatal health, and infant well-being. At the micro level, 
changes in muscle strength, coordination, and balance con-
tribute to new motor capacities that result in crawling or 
walking. Many behaviors that were once viewed as a product 
of genetically guided maturation are now understood as re-
quiring a component of self-directed problem solving.
In 1975, we offered a revision of Erikson’s theory by in-
troducing two stages of adolescence, early adolescence with 
the psychosocial crisis of group identity versus alienation, 
and later adolescence, with the psychosocial crisis of per-
sonal identity versus role confusion. Today, scholars are de-
scribing an ever more gradual transition out of adolescence 
into adulthood, such that the period we call later adoles-
cence is lasting well into the decade of the twenties. Research 
on brain development, educational and occupational attain-
ment, and relationships with family all point to the idea that 
the life commitments that used to be formed in the decade 
of the twenties are being forestalled for many young people 
into their late twenties and thirties.
The slowed emergence into adulthood is due in part to 
the expanding life expectancy. If people can expect to live 
to 85 or 90, what is the urgency of settling down in fam-
ily, work, or community commitments? Other explanations 
include the lengthening period of education and training 
necessary to take one’s place in a postindustrial labor mar-
ket, and the invention of effective birth control, resulting in 
changing patterns of marriage and childbearing.
Life expectancy in the United States has changed over the 
past 35 years, so that today those who are already age 65 can 
expect to live another 19 years. Those in the period of later 
life, which we call elderhood, are the fastest-growing seg-
ment of the U.S. population. As the baby boomers age, they 
will contribute to an even greater proportion of the popula-
tion in elderhood. And these elders are enjoying a period of 
life that is more active, less constrained by fi nancial limita-
tions, and more continuously informed about healthy life-
style practices than ever before.
In the current edition of Development Through Life, we 
have included reference to the conditions of life in other in-
dustrialized countries. In that regard, we have been troubled 
to note many ways in which life in the United States, as excit-
ing and promising as it is, does not compare favorably. As you 
read, you will note that infant mortality, student performance 
in math and science, teen pregnancies, school dropouts, chil-
dren and adolescents who are victims of violent crime, chil-
dren in poverty, children who experience multiple parental 
transitions, adults who are homeless, and longevity are all less 
favorable in the United States than in many other countries. 
These comparisons lead us to urge students and scholars in 
human development to address the challenges of how to con-
tinue to promote optimal development through the life span.
The Stage Approach
The text provides a thorough chronological introduction to 
the study of human development from conception through 
elderhood. We examine physical, intellectual, social, and 
emotional growth in each of the 11 stages, emphasizing that 
development results from the interdependence of these areas 
at every stage. This strategy gives full attention to important 
developmental themes that recur in different stages of life. 
For each life stage, the process of development is linked to 
internal confl icts, changing self-awareness, and a dynamic 
social environment. As a result, students gain a sense of a 
xvi

multidimensional person, striving toward new levels of com-
petence and mastery, embedded in multiple contexts.
Advantages of the Psychosocial 
Framework
Psychosocial theory provides an organizing conceptual 
framework that highlights the continuous interaction and in-
tegration of individual competencies with the demands and 
resources of culture. Development is viewed as a product of 
genetic, maturational, societal, and self-directed factors. The 
psychosocial framework helps students think about how 
people make meaning of their experiences, and how efforts 
at meaning making change over the life span. Applying this 
integrated perspective to an analysis of human development 
has several advantages:
• Although the subject matter is potentially overwhelm-
ing, the psychosocial framework helps to identify and 
emphasize themes and directions of growth across the 
life span.
• The psychosocial framework helps readers assess the 
infl uence of experiences during earlier life stages on 
later development.
• The psychosocial framework clarifi es how one’s past, 
present, and expectations of the future are syste-
matically connected to the lives of people who are 
older and younger. This perspective highlights issues 
of intergenerational transmission and the reciprocal 
infl uences of the generations.
• The psychosocial framework offers a hopeful outlook 
on the total life course. Positive psychological capacities, 
such as hope, purpose, love, and caring, promote 
growth and help to clarify how a personal worldview 
develops. The promise of continuous growth in later 
adulthood and elderhood validates the struggles of 
childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.
• The psychosocial perspective locates development 
within a framework of signifi cant relationships. This 
helps students appreciate the idea that a sense of self 
and a sense of others emerge and mature together, 
fostering the simultaneous and complementary 
processes of autonomy and connection.
The Life-Span Perspective
When we wrote the first edition of Development Through 
Life, we had just completed graduate study, had two young 
children, and were in the midst of early adulthood. Now, at 
the publication of the 11th edition, we are looking forward 
to the birth of our third grandchild; our three adult children 
are living in cities across the country and are thriving in their 
careers, and we are experiencing the new challenges of later 
adulthood.
The psychosocial life-span perspective has been a valu-
able orienting framework for our scholarly work as well as 
our personal lives. It has provided insights into the birth and 
parenting of our three children; the deaths of our parents; the 
successes, disappointments, and transitions of our work lives; 
and the confl icts and delights of our relationship as husband 
and wife. The themes of this book have allowed us to antici-
pate and cope with the challenges of adult life, and to remain 
hopeful in the face of crises. We hope that the ideas presented 
in this text will provide these same benefi ts to you.
In addition to enhancing self-understanding, the life-
span perspective is a means of comprehending the confl icts, 
opportunities, and achievements of central importance to 
people living through different stages than one’s own. In this 
respect, it challenges our egocentrism. The life-span per-
spective assumes an interconnection among people at every 
period of life. This knowledge helps guide interactions with 
others so that they are optimally sensitive, supportive, and 
facilitative for growth at each life stage.
Effects of Cultural and Historical 
Contexts
Studying development over the course of life requires sensi-
tivity to the ways societies change over time. The developing 
person exists in a changing cultural and historical context. 
Events since the 10th edition of Development Through Life was 
published include the election of our fi rst African American 
president; continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the 
large number of injuries and deaths associated with these 
wars; the devastation and relocation of thousands associated 
with the earthquake in Haiti and fl oods in Pakistan; the mort-
gage crisis in the United States and the associated worldwide 
fi nancial recession; a massive oil drilling catastrophe in the 
Gulf of Mexico with related economic, cultural, and envi-
ronmental impacts; the loss of millions of jobs in the United 
States and the highest unemployment rate in 20 years; the for-
mation of new political parties clamoring for less government; 
and the continued spread of the AIDS epidemic in Africa and 
China. There is growing international awareness of global 
warming, which is associated with renewed efforts to make 
lifestyle changes at the personal, community, and corporate 
levels. These are just a few examples of the contexts in which 
development takes place that may dramatically alter people’s 
lived experiences. Nothing could be more fascinating than 
trying to understand patterns of continuity and change over 
the life course within the context of a changing environment.
Effects of Poverty, Discrimination, and 
Other Forms of Societal Oppression
The number of children in the United States who lived in 
families with incomes below the poverty level in 2009 was 
15.5 million, or 20.7% of all children. Numerous examples

Preface
of the ways that poverty, discrimination, and various forms 
of societal oppression affect individual development are in-
terwoven throughout the text. The expanding literature aids 
the further analysis of poverty by pointing out how its im-
pact cascades from increased risks during the prenatal period 
through disruptions in physical, cognitive, and emotional 
development in childhood, in adolescence, and into adult 
life. At the same time, increased research on resilience illus-
trates the remarkable capacities for growth and adaptation at 
every period of life.
Organization
The following summarizes the basic organization of the text.
Introducing the Field: Chapters 1 to 3
Chapter 1 describes the orientation and assumptions of the 
text and introduces the life-span perspective. Chapter 2 intro-
duces the role of theory in human development and outlines 
signifi cant ideas about change and growth from seven theo-
retical perspectives. The presentation of each theory empha-
sizes its basic features, its implications for the study of human 
development, and its links to the psychosocial framework. 
Chapter 3 introduces basic concepts of psychosocial theory, 
including an analysis of its strengths and weaknesses. As in the 
10th edition, the chapter on the research process was short-
ened and moved to the appendix, based on user feedback.
The Latest on Fetal Development 
and Genetics: Chapter 4
In Chapter 4, fetal development is presented, highlighting 
the bidirectional influences of the fetus and the pregnant 
woman within her social and cultural environments. Con-
tinuing discoveries in the fi eld of behavioral genetics have 
been included in this revision. The chapter traces changes 
in physical and sensory development across three trimesters. 
We have emphasized research on the risks to fetal develop-
ment associated with a pregnant woman’s exposure to a wide 
range of substances, especially nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, 
other drugs, and environmental toxins. Poverty is discussed 
as a context that increases risks for suboptimal development. 
This chapter includes a detailed description of cultural dif-
ferences in the way pregnancy and childbirth are conceptual-
ized, providing a fi rst model for considering the psychosocial 
process as it will unfold in subsequent chapters.
Growth and Development from Infancy 
to Elderhood: Chapters 5 to 14
Chapters 5 through 14 trace basic patterns of normal growth 
and development in infancy, toddlerhood, early school age, 
middle childhood, early adolescence, later adolescence, 
early adulthood, middle adulthood, later adulthood, and 
elderhood. In these chapters we consider how individuals 
organize and interpret their experience, noting changes in 
their behavior, attitudes, worldview, and the coping strat-
egies that they use in the face of changing environmental 
demands.
Each chapter begins with an examination of four or 
five of the critical developmental tasks of the stage. These 
tasks reflect global aspects of development, including 
physical maturation, sensory and motor competence, 
cognitive maturation, emotional development, social re-
lationships, and self-understanding. We consider the psy-
chosocial crisis of each stage in some detail. We also show 
how successfully resolving a crisis helps individuals de-
velop a prime adaptive ego quality and how unsuccessful 
resolution leads to core pathology. Although most people 
grow developmentally—albeit with pain and struggle—
others do not. People who acquire prime adaptive ego 
qualities are more likely to lead active, flexible, agentic 
lives, and be resilient in the face of stressors. People who 
acquire core pathologies are more likely to lead with-
drawn, guarded lives; they are more vulnerable to stress-
ors resulting in greater risk of mental and physical health 
problems.
Applied Topics at the End of Each 
Chapter
We conclude each chapter by applying research and theory 
to a topic of societal importance. These applied topics pro-
vide an opportunity for students to link the research and the-
ory about normative developmental processes to the analysis 
of pressing social concerns. The fl yleaf on the front cover of 
the book contains an overview of the basic tasks, crises, and 
applied topics for each stage of life.
Understanding Death, Dying, and 
Bereavement: Chapter 15
The book closes with a chapter that addresses end-of-life 
issues within a psychosocial framework. As with the devel-
opmental stage chapters, the topic illustrates the interaction 
of the biological, psychological, and societal systems as they 
contribute to the experiences of dying, grieving, and bereave-
ment. The chapter includes defi nitions of death, the process 
of dying, death-related rituals, grief, and bereavement, in-
cluding a focus on the role of culture in shaping ideas about 
death and expressions of grief. We conclude the chapter with 
a discussion of the opportunities for psychosocial growth 
that are a result of bereavement and the considerations of 
one’s own mortality.

New to This Edition
The 11th edition has retained the basic structure and posi-
tive developmental emphasis of previous editions. We con-
tinue to strive to make the text clear, readable, and thought 
provoking, while still capturing the complexities and novel

cinating. Many new sections bring greater clarity, elaboration,

Preface
Basic Chapter Pedagogy
Each chapter begins with an outline and a list of objectives. 
These can be used to guide the reader to the main topics 
and help summarize basic ideas of the chapter. The chap-
ter objectives are repeated at the point in the text where the 
material addressing each objective is presented, and again 
in the chapter summary to help students connect the mate-
rial in the chapter to the major themes. Glossary terms are 
presented in boldface to help introduce new concepts. Each 
chapter ends with a chapter summary, which highlights main 
ideas in an integrative fashion, and a set of questions. With 
these questions, we hope to encourage students to synthe-
size information across chapters, to link topics in the text to 
their own experiences, and to think about how they might 
relate ideas from the chapters to applied settings. A list of 
key terms and page numbers is included to draw attention to 
important ideas presented in the chapter.
Boxed Features
Two types of boxed features are included to extend discus-
sion on topics of special interest:
 
Applying Theory and Research to Life illustrates how new 
research and theory can be applied to concerns of daily 
social life.
 
Human Development and Diversity presents a wide range 
of human differences that shape the nature of develop-
ment at various stages of life.
Each box concludes with a group of critical thinking ques-
tions to encourage students to make connections with the 
topics in the text.
Case Studies
• Case Studies and accompanying questions encourage stu-
dents to apply concepts from the chapter to real-life expe-
riences. The cases can be a focus for self-study or used in 
groups to foster discussion regarding the application of the 
main ideas in the chapter.
Acknowledgments
The works of Erik Erikson and Robert Havighurst have 
guided and inspired our own intellectual development. The 
combined contributions of these scholars have shaped the 
basic direction of psychosocial theory and have guided an 
enormous amount of research in human development. They 
directed us to look at the process of growth and change 
across the life span. They recognized the intimate interweav-
ing of the individual’s life story with a sociohistorical con-
text, emphasizing societal pressures that call for new levels 
of functioning at each life stage. In their writing, they com-
municated an underlying optimism about each person’s re-
silience, adaptability, and immense capacity for growth that 
fi nds new expression in the work of positive psychology. At 
the same time, they wrote with a moral passion about our 
responsibility as teachers, therapists, parents, scholars, and 
citizens to create a caring society. We celebrate these ideas 
and continue their expression in the 11th edition of Develop-
ment Through Life.
We want to express our thanks to our many students, 
colleagues, and friends who shared their experiences and 
expertise. Through the years, our mentors, Bill McKeachie 
and Jim Kelly, have been unfailing sources of support and 
fresh ideas. Theirs are the voices of wisdom we count on, 
reminding us of the values of good scholarship and a gener-
ous heart. Our former students, Brenda Lohman and Laura 
Landry Meyer, were excellent collaborators on our life-span 
development case book. For this edition, we want to thank 
Clarissa Uttley who revised the Student Study Guide and 
prepared the Instructor’s resource materials. Phil was Clar-
issa’s academic advisor when she was an undergraduate stu-
dent. He encouraged her to go on for her master’s degree 
in human development, and then her Ph.D. in psychology. 
She is now a faculty member at Plymouth State University 
in Plymouth, New Hampshire. It has been a delight to work 
with her and watch her fl ourish. With each new edition, we 
turn to our children and their families to offer new obser-
vations, try out ideas, and talk over controversies. At each 
stage, they bring new talents and perspectives that enrich 
our efforts.
The 11th edition was produced under the guidance of 
our editor, Jaime Perkins, the managing development editor, 
Jeremy Judson, and a team of developmental editors includ-
ing Dan Moneypenny, Kirk Bomont, Shannon LeMay Finn, 
and Rebecca Dashiell. Their advice, encouragement, sup-
port, and vision have been instrumental in bringing this edi-
tion to fruition. We are very lucky to have had the benefi t of 
their creative energy. In addition, we would like to express 
our appreciation to the other professionals at Wadsworth 
who have helped make this book possible: Charlene Car-
pentier, Content Project Manager; Vernon Boes, Art Direc-
tor; Kelly Miller, Assistant Editor; Mary Noel, Media Editor; 
Jessica Egbert, Marketing Manager; Laura Localio, Market-
ing Communications Manager; and Janay Pryor, Marketing 
Coordinator.
Finally, we acknowledge the thoughtful, constructive 
comments and suggestions of the following reviewers: Diane 
D. Ashe, Valencia Community College; Verneda P. Hamm 
Baugh, Kean University; Shannon Bert, University of Okla-
homa; Bridget Danielle Byrd, University of North Carolina–
Wilmington; Kay Fernandes, Trident Technical College; Jerry 
Green, Tarrant County College; Pamela B. Hill, San Antonio 
College; Leslee K. Pollina, Southeast Missouri State Uni-
versity; Marylou Robins, San Jacinto College; Jaylene Krieg

Philip R. Newman (Ph.D., University of Michigan) is in-
volved in research on the transition to high school and on 
group identity and alienation. His current projects include 
a book about how high schools can meet the psychosocial 
needs of adolescents, and the development of a protocol for 
counselors to assess psychosocial maturity and problems in 
living based on the framework presented in Development 
Through Life. He has taught courses in introductory psychol-
ogy, adolescence, social psychology, developmental psychol-
ogy, counseling, and family, school, and community contexts 
for development. He served as the director for research and 
evaluation of the Young Scholars Program at the Ohio State 
University and as the director of the Human Behavior Curric-
ulum Project for the American Psychological Association. He 
is a fellow of the American Psychological Association, the So-
ciety for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI), and 
the American Orthopsychiatric Association. For fun, Phil en-
joys photography, reading mysteries, attending concerts and 
Broadway plays, and watching baseball. He homeschooled 
his three children through elementary and middle school.
Barbara M. Newman (Ph.D., University of Michigan) 
is a professor in the department of Human Development 
and Family Studies at the University of Rhode Island. She 
has also been on the faculty at Russell Sage College and the 
Ohio State University, where she served as department chair 
in Human Development and Family Science and as associ-
ate provost for faculty recruitment and development. She 
teaches courses in life-span development, adolescence, hu-
man development and family theories, and the research pro-
cess. Also an active researcher, Dr. Newman’s interests focus 
on social and emotional development in adolescence, par-
ent-child relationships in early adolescence, and factors that 
promote success in the transition to high school and college. 
Her current research is an analysis of the sense of belonging

This edition of Development Through Life
 is dedicated to our grandchildren. 

Through play, children extend their ideas about what is possible in the 
present and in the future. A child with a hobbyhorse can be a cowhand, 
a police offi cer, a palace guard, or a wizard riding a dragon. In the study 
of human development, we strive to understand how individuals make 
meaning of their experiences and shape the direction of their lives from 
the playful inventions of childhood to the creative and inspiring wisdoms 
of elderhood.

CHAPTER 1 The Development Through Life Perspective
PATRICK JONATHAN CARMICHAEL was born the son 
of a free man who had earned his way out of slavery in 
North Carolina before moving to Alabama and the Rump 
plantation. Carmichael attended Snowhill Institute, which 
was modeled after Booker T. Washington’s Tuskegee In-
stitute. It was here that the dream for his own school be-
gan. After graduating from  high school, he taught for fi ve 
years, then founded Purdue Hill Industrial High. 
“The state put up just seventy-fi ve dollars a year for 
expenses,” Carmichael says. “Students paid tuition of 
twenty-fi ve cents a year and paid in chickens or cans of 
syrup if they didn’t have the money. You couldn’t get a 
dime out of a state to build a Negro school back then. 
I’d write letters to people all over the country who 
I thought had a little charity about them to help us. 
I’d be the last man to put his light out because I’d be 
writing letters.” 
“He got twenty-fi ve dollars a month,” Carmichael’s 
son adds. “He fed us kids by farming, getting up 
before dawn to work the fi elds, raise chickens and 
cattle and pigs. He had a big garden. All his earnings 
went back into the school. At night he’d write those 
letters to wealthy people in Boston or New York, 
trying to get a little money for the school. He was 
persistent. A little at a time. People in the area built 
the school. It started out as a one-room school 
with one teacher and eleven students and grew to 
a twelve-room school with two hundred and fi fty 
students and ten teachers.”
When this interview was conducted, Patrick Jonathan 
Carmichael was living with his son and daughter-in-law. 
T
he study of human development is puzzling. Our 
goal is to gain a more accurate understanding of how 
individuals make sense of their experiences, adapt 
to their environments, cope with challenges, and continue 
to develop from one period of life to the next. This process 
is as individual as each person’s life story and is infl uenced 
by such factors as gender, ethnicity, cultural identity, health, 
socioeconomic status, education, sexual orientation, physical 
He was 101 years old but had been with them for only 
the past few years. After retiring from his career in edu-
cation in 1958, he lived alone on his farm until he broke 
his hip after going out to feed his cattle; he was 97 at the 
time. 
“I didn’t get along with my father when I was 
younger,” says his son. “He was such a hard-working, 
disciplined man. Now it’s different. It’s like we’re get-
ting another chance. I have to take care of him, do 
things for him like shave him. He needs me and we’re 
developing more of a buddy relationship.” (Heynen, 
1990, p. 9. Patrick Jonathan Carmichael, born 1886, 
interviewed in 1987.)
Think for a moment about Patrick Jonathan Carmichael: 
his hopes, determination, sacrifi ces, family, accomplish-
ments, and disappointments; the new challenges he 
must have faced as he retired from education, lived 
alone, and formed new, interdependent relationships 
with his son and daughter-in-law. Think of living 100 
years—so many changes and so much to learn; so many 
losses and so many victories. What do we know of de-
velopment through life? How can we conceptualize the 
dynamic development of individuals within the contexts 
of their societies, the period of history in which they 
grew up and entered adulthood, their families, their val-
ues and goals, and the obstacles they faced? How can 
we study patterns of change and growth in populations 
and still preserve an understanding of the intriguing 
uniqueness of individual lives? These are some of the 
challenging questions facing the discipline of human 
development. ■

systems.

examine the implications of these changes for the

abilities and disabilities, and historical and social contexts. 
Even though each person’s life is unique, common patterns 
of experience and meaning allow us to know and care for 
one another and contribute to one another’s well-being. The 
life-span approach to human development strives to iden-
tify and account for patterns of transition and transforma-
tion from one period of life to another while recognizing 
both intergroup differences and individual variations within 
groups (Smith & Baltes, 1999). 
This chapter provides a brief introduction to three topics 
that are central to the study of the life span. First, we outline 
fi ve assumptions about human development that guide the 
orientation of the text. Second, we introduce the concept of 
a psychosocial approach to development. Third, we review 
data about life expectancy to start you thinking in a con-
crete way about the course of your life and the decisions you 
make that may directly infl uence your life story. 
Assumptions of the Text
Objective 1. To introduce the basic assumptions that 
guide the orientation of the text. 
Our perspective on development through life makes the fol-
lowing fi ve assumptions that are critical to the orientation of 
this book: 
 1. Growth occurs at every period of life, from conception through 
very old age. At each period, new capacities emerge, new 
roles are undertaken, new challenges must be faced, and, 
as a result, a new orientation toward self and society 
unfolds. The concept of life-span development implies 
plasticity, a capacity for adaptive reorganization at the 
neurological, psychological, and behavioral levels.  
 2. Individual lives show both continuity and developmental 
change over time. An awareness of the processes that con-
tribute to both continuity and change is central to an 
understanding of human development. Continuity refers 
to stability in characteristics from one period of life to 
another. It also refers to a sense of sameness over time 
built on a history of memories, identity, and refl ected 
self. Developmental change refers to patterns of growth 
and reorganization. Change may be attributed to bio-
logical maturation, systematic socialization, self-directed 
striving, and to the interaction of these forces. 
 3. We need to understand the whole person, because we function 
in an integrated manner. To achieve such an understand-
ing, we need to study the major developments in physi-
cal, social, emotional, and cognitive capacities and their 
interrelationships. We also need to study actions, the 
many forms of observable behavior. Each system serves 
as a stimulus for the others, with the overall purpose of 
enhancing the person’s adaptive capacities. 
 4. Behavior must be interpreted in the context of relevant set-
tings and personal relationships. Human beings are highly 
skilled in adapting to their environments. The meaning 
of a given behavior pattern or behavior change must be 
interpreted in light of the signifi cant physical and social 
environments in which it occurs. 
 5. People contribute actively to their development. These con-
tributions take many forms, including the expression 
of tastes and preferences, choices and goals, and one’s 
willingness to embrace or resist cultural and societal 
Growth occurs at every stage of 
life. Within a large family, we have 
opportunities to observe family 
resemblances and individual differ-
ences; patterns of continuity from 
year to year as well as evidence of 
maturation and change.

CHAPTER 1 The Development Through Life Perspective
expectations. One of the most critical ways in which a 
person contributes to his or her development is through 
the creation of signifi cant social relationships, which 
then form a context for social support and socialization. 
Some societies offer more opportunities for choice and 
promote a person’s ability to mold the direction of devel-
opment, whereas others have fewer resources, are more 
restrictive, or place less value on individuality (Veen-
hoven, 2000).
A Psychosocial Approach: 
The Interaction of the 
Biological, Psychological, and 
Societal Systems
Objective 2. To introduce the psychosocial approach 
to the study of development, including the inter-
relationship among the biological, psychological, and 
societal systems.
Erik Erikson (1963, p. 37) wrote that human life as the indi-
vidual experiences it is produced by the interaction and mod-
ifi cation of three major systems: the biological system, the 
psychological system, and the societal system. Each system 
can be examined for patterns of continuity and change over 
the life course. Each system can be modifi ed by self-guided 
choices. The integration of the biological, psychological, 
and societal systems leads to a complex, biopsychosocial 
dynamic portrait of human thought and behavior. 
In many developmental analyses of behavior, you may 
come across the terms “nature” and “nurture.” These terms 
are often used as shorthand for thinking about the roles of 
genetics and environments in guiding development. Typi-
cally, nature refers to genetic predispositions or potentials 
and inborn or innate qualities that guide the unfolding of 
capacities and traits. Nurture refers to the patterns of social-
ization and care that the person receives. The science of 
development is often been presented as the study of the ways 
nature and nurture interact to produce a certain outcome, 
for example intelligence, assertiveness, or hopefulness. 
In Development Through Life we take a somewhat differ-
ent approach by expanding the analysis to three interrelated 
systems: the biological, the societal, and the psychological 
systems. Rather than thinking of the developing person as 
passively shaped by forces of nature and nurture, we think 
of the person as actively engaged in the developmental pro-
cess through the application of the psychological system. 
The psychological system is the meaning-making system 
that seeks out information, integrates information from 
many sources, and evaluates experiences as positive or nega-
tive, encouraging or threatening. Over time, and drawing 
upon genetically based resources as well as environmental 
facilitation, the person becomes increasingly able to make 
plans, set goals, make choices and decisions, and interpret 
inner feelings and thoughts (Ryan & Deci, 2000). The stories 
of individual lives are a product of this interpretive capacity 
of the psychological system as much as they are a result of 
the unfolding of genetically guided capacities and environ-
mental or societal resources and constraints. Depending on 
their experiences and predispositions, some people are more 
proactive in shaping the course of their development while 
others are more passive. The psychosocial approach is an 
attempt to sketch out the ways that a person’s worldview and 
sense of self in society change as a product of the interaction 
of these three dynamic systems over the course of life.
The Biological System
The biological system includes all those processes necessary 
for the physical functioning of the organism and for mental 
activity (see Figure 1.1). The brain and spinal cord (the cen-
tral nervous system) and the peripheral nervous system are 
components of the biological system through which all sen-
sory information is received, processed, and transmitted to 
guide behavior. Biological processes develop and change as a 
consequence of genetically guided maturation; environmen-
tal stimulation and resources, including social interactions,

of experiences and from encounters with various educational 
settings which impact brain development and result in new 
cognitive structures and new approaches to problem solv-
ing. Psychological processes can be enhanced by numer-
ous life experiences including the quality of parenting one 
receives, interactions with friends, opportunities for play of 
all types, travel, reading, exposure to music, art, poetry, and 
the dramatic arts, and schooling. Finally, change can be self-
directed. A person can decide to pursue a new interest, learn 
another language, or adopt a new set of ideas. People can 
strive to achieve new levels of self-insight, to be more aware 
of their thoughts and feelings, and less defensive. There is 
evidence to suggest that self-insight is a vital component of 
positive mental health (Wilson, 2009). 
The Societal System
The societal system includes social roles; social support; 
culture, including rituals, myths, and social expectations; 
media; leadership styles; communication patterns; family 
organization; ethnic and subcultural infl uences; political ide-
ologies and forms of government; religions; patterns of eco-
nomic prosperity or poverty; conditions of war or peace; and 
exposure to racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimina-
tion, intolerance, or intergroup hostility. The societal system 
encompasses those processes that foster or disrupt a person’s 
sense of social integration and social identity (see Figure 1.3). 
Through laws and public policies, political and economic 
structures, and educational opportunities, societies infl uence 
the psychosocial development of individuals and alter the life 
course for future generations (de St. Aubin, McAdams, 
cognitive challenges, and nutrition; exposure to environ-
mental toxins; encounters with accidents and diseases; and 
lifestyle patterns of behavior. 
Cultures differ in their support of physical growth and 
health, depending on the availability of adequate nutritional 
resources, approaches to the treatment of illness, exposure 
to environmental toxins and hazardous conditions, and the 
availability of information about healthy lifestyle choices. 
Some components of the biological system infl uence the 
maturation of other components of the biological system. 
For example, when the infant’s limbs achieve a certain length 
and muscle strength, the baby is able to reach out from a 
sitting position to begin crawling—a new form of locomo-
tion. This results in new opportunities for exploration of the 
environment which in turn results in new neural networks 
and changes in the organization of the brain. The biological 
system is itself a multilevel, dynamic system in which matu-
ration at one level can have profound, and sometimes unex-
pected, consequences for maturation at another level. 
In the case of Patrick Jonathan Carmichael, two examples 
of the infl uences of the biological system on his life experi-
ences are his longevity and his physical strength. He lived a 
long time in good health. His uncommon hardiness, brought 
about by a combination of genes, a life of rigorous exercise, 
and a healthy lifestyle, contributed to his ability to endure 
the physical demands of his life and to achieve many of his 
career goals, while still supporting his family. The experi-
ence of breaking his hip at an advanced age is an example of 
how changes in the biological system can modify the social 
and psychological systems. Looking at Figure 1.1, can you 
think of other aspects of the biological system that may have 
been important in shaping Patrick Jonathan Carmichael’s life 
story? 
The Psychological System
The psychological system includes those mental processes 
central to a person’s ability to make meaning of experiences 
and take action (see Figure 1.2). Emotion, memory, percep-
tion, motivation, thinking and reasoning, language, symbolic 
abilities, and one’s orientation to the future are examples 
of psychological processes. When these processes are inte-
grated, they provide the resources for processing informa-
tion, solving problems, and navigating reality. In the case 
of Patrick Jonathan Carmichael, the influence of the psy-
chological system can be appreciated when one consid-
ers his motivation, his persistence, his academic abilities, 
his independence, his ingenuity, his goals, and his sense of 
self-discipline. 
Like the biological processes, psychological processes 
develop and change over one’s life span. Change is guided 
in part by genetic information. The capacity for intellectual 
functioning and the direction of cognitive maturation are 
genetically guided. A number of genetically transmitted dis-
eases result in intellectual impairment and a reduced capac-
ity for learning. Change also results from the accumulation

and children, loved ones, friends, and colleagues. Cell phones 
make it possible to communicate in a variety of modes 
including text messages, voice mail, shared images, and email 
as well as traditional telephone talk. We can hypothesize that 
cell phones may contribute to sustaining intimate relation-
ships and preserving bonds of closeness in a time when peo-
ple are extremely busy trying to manage multiple roles. 
Historical events can also infl uence the societal system, 
altering social roles, access to resources, economic condi-
tions, and one’s sense of personal safety or security. For 
example, although we do not yet have a systematic analysis 
of the societal impacts of the events of September 11, 2001, 
or the sudden economic collapse of 2008, we can hypoth-
esize that these events will have an enduring infl uence on 
people’s sense of safety, economic security, and confi dence 
in key social institutions. In response to these crises, the 
government has instituted new levels of surveillance, new 
restrictions, and new laws which become integrated into the 
“way of life.” Some researchers speculate that recent experi-
ences of economic instability may result in revised aspira-
tions about accumulating material wealth, leading to the 
adoption of a more modest standard of living, and a greater 
desire to be part of a meaningful and caring social commu-
nity (Novotney, 2009). 
In this text, the role of culture is emphasized as it con-
tributes to the pattern, pace, and direction of development. 
Societies differ in their worldviews, including the empha-
sis placed on collectivism or individualism, ideas about 
the major sources of stress and ways to alleviate stress, and 
beliefs about which groups are viewed as more powerful or 
more important than others. Societies differ in their empha-
sis on and belief in science, spirituality, and fatalism. They 
differ in their age-graded expectations, such as when a per-
son is considered to be a child, an adult, or an elder, and 
how people in these age roles should be treated. They differ 
in their defi nitions of morality, beauty, bravery, wealth, and 
other ideals that may define individual and group aspira-
tions. As you read the text, you will encounter boxes entitled 
Human Development and Diversity. These boxes provide 
examples of how norms of development might be viewed 
differently in different cultures or ethnic groups. We hope 
these examples will help sensitize you to the role of culture 
in defi ning what may be viewed as appropriate, optimal, or 
normal behavior. 
The societal system is illustrated in the case of Patrick Jon-
athan Carmichael by the importance of Carmichael’s educa-
tional experiences at the Snowhill Institute, the discriminatory 
practices that resulted in no state funding for Negro educa-
tion, the involvement of other families in the community in 
encouraging education for their children, the philanthropic 
donations from benefactors outside the community, and the 
changing nature of Carmichael’s relationship with his son. 
The Psychosocial Impact of Poverty
In thinking about the impact of societal factors on devel-
opment, we want to highlight the context of poverty as a 
& Kim, 2004). Societal processes may change over one’s life 
span. The process of modernization may bring exposure to 
new levels of education, new technologies, encounters with 
more diverse groups of people, and new forms of work. 
These changes are likely to result in more individualistic val-
ues, new priorities about which skills are valued, and chang-
ing patterns of family life (Greenfi eld, 2009). 
Technological innovations can modify the societal system. 
For example, television, cell phones, personal computers, 
and the Internet have modified a person’s access to infor-
mation, patterns of informal interaction, and the ease with 
which individuals and groups can collaborate. Websites such 
as Facebook, MySpace, or LinkedIn create virtual social net-
works where people can establish and preserve connections, 
even when they are physically far apart, recreating the sense 
of neighborhood and facilitating interactions among people 
with common interests. These technologies have altered chil-
dren’s roles, providing them with resources that can allow 
them to function at new levels of autonomy and competence. 
In many families, children teach their parents and grand-
parents how to make use of the new technologies, elevating 
their role within the family. The widespread distribution of 
cell phones reduces barriers to communication, a change that 
has an impact on patterns of communication among parents

psychological, and societal processes. Changes in one of 
the three systems (biological, psychological, or societal) 
generally bring about changes in the others. As an exam-
ple, consider the emerging fi eld of social cognitive neuro-
science. This field explores the neurological processes 
associated with the ways we perceive social information 
and reason about others. The fi eld draws on an evolution-
ary perspective that suggests that human beings are social 
animals whose survival depended on being able to com-
municate with others and to establish and preserve social 
bonds. As a result, neural mechanisms have developed that 
are uniquely organized to detect social messages of exclu-
sion and trustworthiness. In the ancient past, those humans 
who were able to make accurate, rapid judgments about 
whether someone or some situation was safe or dangerous, 
trustworthy or threatening, had a survival advantage (Chen, 
2009). This social cognitive advantage, fi rmly embedded in 
the brain’s neural networks, has been passed along from 
one generation to the next, contributing to the way modern 
humans detect and assess their social environment. 
The capacities for representing self and others, for perspective 
taking and empathy, and for engaging in effective social commu-
nication develop over time as the social information-processing 
areas of the brain are stimulated in diverse and culturally guided 
forms of social interaction (Wood, 2003). The biological system 
recognizes and processes social stimulation. The societal system 
creates the contexts for social interactions and introduces com-
plex patterns of values and priorities for social behavior. Further, 
the psychological system internalizes these values and assigns 
unique meaning to social events. So, for example, researchers 
fi nd that in a task that requires recognition of one’s own face and 
the face of a familiar other, Westerners who tend to emphasize 
self-related events recognize their own face more quickly, and 
East Asians, who tend to emphasize social connections among 
people, recognize the familiar other more quickly (Sui, Liu, & 
Han, 2009). 
Throughout life, personal relationships occupy our atten-
tion. Some of these relationships are more important than 
others, but their quality and diversity provide a basis for the 
study of one’s psychosocial development. As we progress 
through the stages of life, most of us develop an increasing 
capacity to initiate new relationships and to innovate in our 
thoughts and actions so as to direct the course of our lives. 
At each period of life, people spend much of their time mas-
tering a unique group of psychological tasks that provide essen-
tial learning for social adaptation within their society. Each life 
stage brings a normative crisis, which is viewed as a tension 
between one’s competencies and the new demands of society. 
People strive to reduce this tension by using a variety of familiar 
coping strategies and by learning new ones. A positive resolu-
tion of each crisis provides new social abilities and a new under-
standing of the self and others that enhance a person’s capacity 
to adapt successfully in succeeding stages. A negative resolution 
of each crisis typically results in defensiveness, rigidity, or with-
drawal, which decreases a person’s ability for successful social 
adaptation in succeeding stages. 
major obstacle to optimal development. (See the Applying 
Theory and Research to Life box.) Racism, sexism, ageism, 
homophobia, and discrimination against individuals with 
physical, intellectual, and emotional disabilities are other 
examples. However, under conditions of poverty, individuals 
have fewer options and less opportunity to escape or avoid 
these other societal deterrents. Poverty has powerful and 
potentially pervasive effects on the biological and psycho-
logical systems across the life span. 
In 2008, an estimated 14 million U.S. children lived in fam-
ilies with incomes at or below the poverty level, and another 
16 million lived in families at up to twice the poverty level. 
More than half of these children lived in families where a par-
ent worked full time (National Center for Children in Poverty, 
2009). These fi gures do not take into account the full impact of 
the recent recession, because many families that were margin-
ally above the poverty level are now unemployed or underem-
ployed, and still others have lost their homes to foreclosures. 
African-American, Hispanic, and Native-American families 
are overrepresented among those living in poverty, and their 
experiences of poverty are likely to be long lasting. For indi-
viduals in these ethnic groups, the stresses associated with the 
chronic conditions of poverty are linked with earlier exposure 
to health risks and higher exposure to environmental hazards. 
In and of itself, poverty does not place inevitable limits on 
development. There are many instances, both famous and less 
well known, of children who grew up in poverty and achieved 
eminence (Harrington & Boardman, 2000). We need only 
think of the case of Patrick Jonathan Carmichael to recognize 
that many children fl ourish under conditions of meager family 
resources. In fact, some people choose to live very modest mate-
rial lives in order to achieve other important goals. However, it is 
well documented that poverty increases the risks that individu-
als face, including risks associated with malnutrition, poor qual-
ity health care, living in poor quality and overcrowded housing, 
living in a hazardous or dangerous neighborhood, and attending 
ineffective schools. Poverty is linked with reduced access to the 
basic resources associated with health and survival (Yoo, Slack, 
& Holl, 2009; Crosnoe & Huston, 2007). Exposure to these risk 
factors early and continuously throughout childhood is associ-
ated with higher incidences of health problems, greater chal-
lenges in achieving the developmental tasks of each life stage, 
disruptions in family and work trajectories, and reduced life 
expectancy (Hayward, Crimmins, Miles, & Yang, 2000; Knitzer, 
2007). 
Because of the complex and pervasive impact of poverty 
on development, we introduce it as a fundamental societal 
theme. Issues related to the impact of poverty on patterns of 
development and family life will be addressed in more detail 
in subsequent chapters.

CHAPTER 1 The Development Through Life Perspective
Poverty 
Conditions Leading to Poverty 
Since the 1960s, fi ve factors have 
contributed to an increase in the 
number of families living in poverty: 
(1) the decline in well-paying, blue-
collar jobs; (2) large increases in 
single-mother households due to 
births to unmarried women and 
to divorce; (3) the erosion of the 
economic safety net for poor families, 
including the decline in cash transfers 
and benefi ts to families in the welfare 
program, Transitional Assistance 
to Needy Families; (4) the decline 
in the purchasing power of the 
minimum wage; and (5) the economic 
recession of 2008 which resulted in 
dramatic increases in unemployment, 
homelessness, and loss of retirement 
savings (Hernandez, 1993; Pavetti, 
2000). Adjusted for infl ation, the 
purchasing power of the minimum 
wage in 2009 ($7.25 per hour) was 
17% less than it was in 1968 (Economic 
Policy Institute, 2009). 
The way the current poverty level 
is estimated has been criticized as 
fl awed for two major reasons: First, 
the poverty level was established in 
the 1960s based on an estimate of 
how much an average family spends 
on food. At that time, families spent 
about 1/3 of their income on food, 
so the poverty level was set at three 
times the cost of a typical “shopping 
basket” of consumables. Today, 
food is only 1/7th of an average 
family’s expenses. Costs for rent, 
transportation, child care, and health/
medical expenses have increased 
much faster than the costs of food. 
Second, the poverty level is a national 
standard that does not take into 
account regional variations in the cost 
of living. For example, one estimate 
of basic needs found that the average 
cost of basic housing and utilities for a 
family of four would cost $15,816 per 
year in New York City, and $10,224 
in Houston, TX (National Center for 
Children in Poverty, 2009). Neither the 
federal guidelines about the poverty 
level nor a Basic Budget approach to 
estimating the poverty level includes 
any category for savings or emergency 
funds. 
Poverty is transitory for some 
families—such as when a wage earner 
becomes unemployed and then fi nds 
new work—but persistent over the 
life course for others. For unmarried 
women who become mothers in 
adolescence, poverty is often a result 
of interrupted education, the inability 
to work full time (usually because 
of time needed to care for their 
children), and the low-paying jobs 
that are available to those with limited 
educational attainment. Furthermore, 
many of these young mothers are 
growing up in families that are already 
living in poverty. Eighty-fi ve percent of 
children whose parents do not have a 
high-school diploma live in low-income 
families (National Center for Children 
in Poverty, 2009). 
Divorce places many women and 
their children into poverty. In many 
instances, the family was already 
encountering fi nancial strain, which is 
known to be one of the primary factors 
associated with divorce. However, 
following divorce, an estimated 
27% of divorced women and their 
children fall below the poverty line 
(Chase-Lansdale, 1993). The level 
of poverty experienced by newly 
divorced women is aggravated by 
the failure of many fathers to pay 
child support (Smock & Manning, 
1997). Poverty for these families is 
sometimes transitory, because many 
divorced women remarry or are able 
to fi nd adequate employment after a 
year or two. However, in one study, 
48% of respondents reported lower 
income even fi ve years after the 
divorce (Thabes, 1997). With increases 
in women’s education and career 
prospects, opportunities for women to 
emerge from poverty after divorce are 
likely to improve. 
Poverty is a powerful characteristic of the societal system. Children growing up in pov-
erty are exposed to stressors and hazards that can severely restrict development.

Negative Consequences 
of Poverty
Persistent poverty and exposure 
to poverty during infancy and early 
childhood are associated with greater 
vulnerability and more negative 
consequences to health, cognitive 
development and school achievement, 
and mental health. 
Health. Exposure to poverty during 
the prenatal period is associated with 
increased risks for having premature 
babies and babies that are small for 
gestational age (Nepomnyaschy, 
2009). According to the National 
Center for Children in Poverty (2009), 
two consequences of poverty have 
a signifi cant impact on health. First, 
children in low-income families are 
likely to experience food insecurity; 
second, they are likely to lack health 
insurance. Children in low-income 
families are more likely to be in fair 
or poor health and lack access to 
quality health care. Children in low-
income families often lack treatment 
for existing physical health problems, 
such as asthma, or go untreated for 
infections that then become more 
serious and can result in long-term 
chronic conditions. For a family in 
poverty, a visit to a doctor that costs 
$75 is a signifi cant and possibly 
prohibitive expense. 
Education. Higher family income 
is consistently associated with higher 
academic achievement (Gershoff, 2003; 
Lee & Burkham, 2002). Children in low-
income families begin kindergarten 
with a substantial disadvantage with 
regard to specifi c academic skills such 
as counting, recognizing letters of the 
alphabet, and reading. By the time 
they are in the third grade, children in 
low-income families have an average 
vocabulary of 4,000 words compared 
to a vocabulary of 12,000 words for 
children from middle income families 
(Klein & Knitzer, 2007). Research 
on seasonal fl uctuations in learning 
shows that children from low-income 
families and low-resource communities 
have substantially fewer learning 
opportunities over the summer. 
Each fall they begin school behind 
their middle-income peers year 
after year. In addition, the inequity 
in school resources and educational 
opportunities across communities 
is well documented. As a result, by 
the time children from low-income 
families reach the ninth grade, they 
have signifi cantly lower test scores, 
are less likely to be placed in college-
preparatory tracks, and are more 
likely to drop out of high school than 
their higher socioeconomic (SES) 
peers (Alexander, Entwisle, & Olson, 
2007). When children from poor 
families attend schools where there 
are students from a greater diversity 
of economic backgrounds, the poor 
students tend to be viewed as less 
competent by the teachers and the 
wealthier students. This may create an 
added burden on their academic self-
concept and result in lower academic 
performance (Crosnoe, 2009). 
Mental Health. Recent neuroscience 
research has clarifi ed the signifi cance 
of the quality of early life experiences. 
Earliest experiences shape the 
establishment of neural networks, 
including the way the brain processes 
information and manages emotions. 
A key ingredient of early brain 
development is the quality of caregiving 
relationships, especially the ability of 
caregivers to be appropriately nurturing, 
responsive, and stimulating. 
Children from low-income families 
are more likely to be exposed pre-
natally to factors such as maternal 
malnutrition, cigarette smoke, alcohol, 
and environmental toxins that disrupt 
neural development. Infants and young 
children are more likely to be exposed 
to parental depression, other diagnos-
able mental disorders, and parental 
adversities including domestic violence 
and substance abuse that disrupt or 
destabilize caregiving. In addition, 
threats to safety are of special concern to 
children living in low-income neighbor-
hoods where exposure to uncontrol-
lable violence on the streets and near 
the school is associated with symptoms 
of post-traumatic stress (Caughy, Net-
tles, O’Campo, & Lohrfi nk, 2006). 
These risk factors have been associ-
ated with a number of short- and 
long-term consequences for children 
including depression, acting-out 
 behaviors, diffi culty concentrating, and 
school problems. Living in poverty is 
associated with higher rates of learning 
problems and diagnosable disorders 
in older children (Knitzer & Cooper, 
2006). These often lead to juvenile 
justice involvement and higher school 
drop-out rates. Two-thirds of youth 
with mental health problems have 
been found to drop out of high school 
(Wagner, 2005). 
Critical Thinking Questions 
 1. What are some examples of ways 
that social and economic policies can 
increase or decrease the number of 
families in poverty? 
 2. What is meant by the phrase “the 
cycle of poverty”? How might the 
experiences of growing up in poverty 
infl uence one’s adjustment as an 
adolescent? as an adult? 
 3. What do you think would be the 
most important, immediate steps 
that a society could take to reduce 
the negative consequences of 
poverty? 
 4. If you had to choose between giving 
money directly to families in poverty 
by increasing the minimum wage or 
investing in higher quality schools, 
health care insurance, and housing, 
which would you do? Why?

CHAPTER 1 The Development Through Life Perspective
ANALYSIS 
How are the biological, psychological, and societal systems 
involved in Rose’s situation? We might hypothesize that her 
physical symptoms, dizziness and shortness of breath, are 
due to an inability to resolve a diffi cult family confl ict. Psy-
chological and societal demands may elicit responses from 
the biological system, as they commonly do in people under 
stress. The biological system often alerts a person to the se-
verity of a threat or crisis through the development of physi-
cal symptoms. Rose might visit her family doctor in order to 
evaluate whether her symptoms are a result of high blood 
pressure or early signs of heart disease. There may be medi-
cation that can help reduce these symptoms, allowing Rose 
to feel less anxious and more confi dent about her role in the 
family.
Rose’s psychological system is involved in interpreting 
her son’s behavior, which she views as forcing her to choose 
between him and her daughter-in-law and granddaughter. 
She might also use psychological processes to try to arrive 
at a solution to the confl ict. So far, Rose has not identifi ed 
any satisfactory solution. Although she can avoid the con-
fl ict most of the time, the impending Thanksgiving dinner is 
forcing her to confront it directly. 
CASE STUDY
ROSE
The interaction of the biological, the psychological, and the 
societal systems. 
Rose is a 60-year-old woman who has been having serious at-
tacks of dizziness and shortness of breath as Thanksgiving ap-
proaches. Rose is usually active and energetic. In the past, she 
looked forward to entertaining her family, which used to include 
three married daughters, one married son, their spouses, and 
their children. However, her son has recently been divorced. 
Feelings between him and his ex-wife are  bitter. Any attempts 
on Rose’s part to communicate with her former daughter-in-
law or granddaughter are met with outbursts of hostility from 
her son. Although Rose is very fond of her daughter-in-law 
and granddaughter, she knows that she cannot invite them to 
the family gathering without stirring up intense confl ict with 
her son. Rose’s daughters suggest having the dinner at one 
of their homes in order to prevent further confl ict. They hope 
this solution will take some of the pressure off their mother 
and ease the attacks. Rose agrees, but her attacks continue.

The desire to experience a loving relationship remains strong throughout life. However, the self one brings to a loving relationship 
changes at each stage. How might experiences of love change from adolescence to early adulthood to later adulthood?

 
The Life Span | 13
communication. The need to be loved and to give love 
remains important throughout life, but the self we bring 
to a loving relationship, the context within which the rela-
tionship is established, and the signs we look for as evi-
dence of love change with age. 
Meaning is created out of efforts to interpret and inte-
grate the experiences of the biological, psychological, and 
societal systems. A primary focus of this meaning making 
is the search for identity. Humans struggle to defi ne them-
selves—to achieve a sense of identity—through a sense of 
connectedness with certain other people and groups and 
through feelings of distinctiveness from others. We estab-
lish categories that defi ne to whom we are connected, about 
whom we care, and which of our own qualities we admire. 
We also establish categories that defi ne those to whom we 
are not connected, those about whom we do not care, and 
those qualities of our own that we reject or deny. These cat-
egories provide us with an orientation toward certain kinds 
of people and away from others, toward certain life choices 
and away from others. The psychosocial perspective brings 
to light the dynamic interplay of the roles of the self and the 
others, the I and the We, as they contribute to the emergence 
of identity over the life course. 
The Life Span
Objective 3. To note historical changes in life 
expectancy and examine the implications of these 
changes for the study of development over the life 
span. 
The study of human development requires an analysis of the 
life span and a view of the periods of life that are embed-
ded within it. Unlike other primates, humans have a rela-
tively long period of childhood during which we depend on 
adults to feed and protect us. Without some form of adult 
care, infants and young children younger than age six or 
seven cannot survive. Human evolution has resulted in a life 
span characterized by a prolonged period of dependency, a 
gradual transition to reproductive maturity, and signifi cant 
length (Gibbons, 2008). In modern times, with expanded 
longevity, childhood takes up a relatively smaller percent-
age of one’s life; the period of active, productive adulthood 
expands; and the period when people are considered very 
old or elderly is pushed ahead to increasingly advanced ages. 
Over the past 100 years, adolescence has changed from a 
relatively brief period of fi ve or six years from puberty until 
a young person was ready to engage in the work and fam-
ily roles of adulthood, to a period of ten to fi fteen years, as 
puberty begins earlier and entry into adult roles is increas-
ingly delayed. Thus, the lifespan itself is a fl uid concept that 
is infl uenced by the biological, psychological, and societal 
systems.
The psychological system includes Rose’s self-concept as 
well as her emotional state. Through memory, Rose retains 
a sense of her family at earlier periods, when they enjoyed 
greater closeness. Having to face a Thanksgiving dinner at 
which she will feel angry at her son or guilty about exclud-
ing her daughter-in-law and granddaughter places her in a 
fundamental confl ict. The Thanksgiving meal is also a sym-
bolic event, representing Rose’s idea of family unity, which 
she cannot achieve. 
The societal system infl uences the situation at several lev-
els. First, there are the societal expectations regarding the 
mother role: Mother is nurturing, loving, and protecting. But 
Rose cannot be nurturing without sending messages of rejec-
tion either to her son or to her daughter-in-law and grand-
daughter. Second, social norms for relating to various family 
members after a divorce are unclear. How should Rose be-
have toward her son’s former spouse? How should she relate 
to her grandchild if her son is no longer the child’s custo-
dial parent? Rose is confused about what to do. Third, the 
Thanksgiving celebration has social, religious, and cultural 
signifi cance. This family ritual was performed in Rose’s home 
when she was a child, and she has carried it through in her 
own home as an adult. Now, however, she is being forced 
to pass the responsibility for this gathering to her daughter 
before she is ready to do so and, as a result, Rose is likely 
to feel a special sense of loss. She will also lose the sense of 
family unity that she has tried to preserve. 
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS 
 1. How does this case illustrate the interconnections among 
the biological, psychological, and societal systems? 
 2. Given what you know about the assumptions of psychoso-
cial theory, how might Rose’s stage of development infl u-
ence her perceptions of this situation and her approach to 
coping with this confl ict? 
 3. How might you pose a research question based on the 
information raised in this case study? (For example, how 
likely is it that parents experience health problems follow-
ing their child’s divorce?) 
 4. How might Rose’s social support system, especially her 
daughters, be involved in helping her cope with this con-
fl ict?
 5. How might the current confl ict impact future psychosocial 
development for Rose? Consider the assumptions of the 
text as you try to answer this question.
Meaning Making
The meaning we make of our experiences changes over 
the course of life. Think about the concept of love as an 
example. In infancy, love is almost entirely physical. It is 
the pervasive sense of comfort and security that we feel 
in the presence of our caregivers. By adolescence, the 
idea of love includes loyalty, emotional closeness, and 
sexuality. In adulthood, the concept of love may expand 
to include a new emphasis on companionship and open

The next few lines in Table 1.1 show that people who 
reach an advanced age (65, 75, or 80 years) in each of the 
time periods have a longer life expectancy than the people 
who were born in those time periods. For example, a person 
born in 1900 could expect to live until age 49; but a person 
who was already 65 in 1900 could expect to live an addi-
tional 12 years to age 77. These data suggest that hazards 
during the early and middle years of life shorten the average 
life expectancy at birth. Infant mortality was a major factor 
in limiting life expectancy at the turn of the 20th century. 
Furthermore, many women died in childbirth, and respira-
tory diseases and heart disease were serious threats to life 
during the middle adult years. If one survived these common 
killers, one’s chance for a long later life increased. 
Today, more and more adults are anticipating an extended 
period of what we refer to as “elderhood”—age 75 and 
beyond. Over the past 100 years, the U.S. population has 
changed from one shaped like a pyramid with a large num-
ber of children and adolescents, and relatively fewer adults 
at each advanced age, to a population that looks more like 
a rectangle, with a relatively smaller percentage of children 
and adolescents, and a relatively larger percentage of adults 
including a growing percentage of those in advanced old age. 
These changes have major implications for a wide range of 
social policies regarding education, employment, retirement, 
health care, and social security benefi ts.
Figure 1.4 provides a visual comparison of life expec-
tancy at birth for four race–sex groups from 1970 to 2004. 
Over time, life expectancy has increased for all four groups. 
However, the fi gure illustrates a consistent gap in life expec-
tancy for males and females as well as for African Americans 
and Anglos. Since 1979, the gap in life expectancy between 
males and females has decreased from 7.8 years to 5.2 years; 
the gap between African Americans and Anglos has also 
decreased to 5.2 years. At birth, Anglo females have the 
longest life expectancy (80.8 years), and African-American 
males have the shortest (69.5 years) (Arias, 2007). 
Men die at younger ages than women in countries around 
the world. There are biological, societal, and behavioral 
explanations for women’s longevity advantage, but this dis-
crepancy is not fully understood and is still being investi-
gated. Although more male than female infants are born, 
more males die at each age than females. Some researchers 
Life Expectancy
How long does one expect to live? At what age is one consid-
ered to be adult? old? ancient? If the life expectancy at birth 
is 50, then a person who is 65 might be considered quite 
elderly. However, if the life expectancy at birth is 77, then 
a person who is 65 might be considered to be in the prime 
of life. 
Life expectancy is a projection of the number of years
one can expect to live. Think back to the case of Patrick 
Jonathan Carmichael, who was living alone and working on 
his farm until the age of 97. According to population statis-
tics, the life expectancy for someone born in 1900 was 49.2. 
Among Carmichael’s cohort of African-American men, the 
life expectancy was 32.5. If you consider African-American 
men who reached the age of 65 in the 1950s, the additional 
life expectancy was 13.5 years. Patrick Jonathan Carmichael 
lived to be much older than the norm for his group. The task 
of mapping one’s future depends on how long one expects 
to live. Naturally, for specifi c individuals, we can make only 
rough predictions. We know that some lives may be cut 
short by a disaster, an accident, or an illness. On the other 
hand, some people are exceptionally long lived. 
Table 1.1 presents data on the average life expectancy of 
people in the United States during eight time periods. Look 
at the top row of the table, labeled “at birth.” The average life 
expectancy of people born at the beginning of the 20th cen-
tury was about 49 years. Over the course of the 20th century, 
we observed increasingly longer life expectancies. In the year 
2005, people had a life expectancy at birth 28.6 years longer 
than they had in 1900; a 58% increase in average life expec-
tancy in one century! 
You may be wondering how we can know about the life 
expectancy of people who were born in the year 2005. Not 
many years have passed to record deaths and life expectancy 
estimates for this group. The National Center for Health Sta-
tistics calculates life expectancy tables based on the num-
ber of deaths at each age for a particular year, information 
from the U.S. Census Bureau about the number of people 
who are alive at each age, and information from the Medicare 
program about the likelihood of dying among those aged 
85 years and older (Arias, 2007). So whereas the life expec-
tancy information about people born in 1900 is based on the 
actual rates of death experienced by that group over time, 
the life expectancy projections for people born in 2005 are

is associated with prenatal and infant malnutrition. African-
American men are more likely to work in hazardous condi-
tions where they may be exposed to toxins, injury, and, at 
the same time, where employers do not provide health insur-
ance benefi ts. 
One factor that has been found to be associated with 
improved health is marriage. Healthy adults are more likely 
to fi nd partners and marry. At the same time, married cou-
ples are more likely to be embedded in an effective social 
network, to engage in healthy behaviors, and to live longer. 
Whereas 91% of Anglo women born in 1950 have mar-
ried, only 75% of African-American women of this cohort 
have married (Bramlett & Mosher, 2002). Projections sug-
gest that this percentage could decline further in the years 
ahead as a result of the disproportionate number of African-
American men who die in early and middle adulthood, are 
incarcerated, or are unemployed (Winkelby & Cubbin, 
2004). Across all economic groups, exposure to racial dis-
crimination is itself a lifelong source of stress which can have 
deleterious psychological and physiological consequences 
(Shrestha, 2006; Arias, 2007). 
Projections of Life Expectancy
Table 1.2 shows projections of life expectancy for the years 
2015 and 2020 for men and women separately by race. The life 
expectancy of both men and women is projected to increase. 
One question that has been raised is whether the increase 
in life expectancy can continue in the years ahead. Some 
researchers have suggested that the primary diseases that 
resulted in mortality of infants and adults have already been 
brought under control. They project that increases in life 
expectancy will be more modest over the coming 50 years, 
leading to an estimated life expectancy at birth of around 80 
to 83 years in the United States. 
The reasoning behind this view is that as the life expec-
tancy increases, it takes greater declines in the death rate at 
every age to increase the life expectancy further. From this 
perspective, researchers argue that it is unlikely that there 
will be major improvements in the death rate of those under 
age 50 that would signifi cantly add to their life expectancy. 
The conditions associated with death among older age 
groups are intimately linked to basic biological conditions of 
aging that, at present, are poorly understood. Many experts 
suggest that estrogen has a protective effect that helps reduce 
women’s risk of heart disease during the childbearing years. 
Others suggest that because men are physically larger on 
average than women, their cells must reproduce more often 
and are at greater risk of exhausting their regenerative poten-
tial. Although women suffered higher mortality rates dur-
ing childbirth at the beginning of the 20th century, the risks 
associated with childbirth have been substantially reduced. 
In contrast, men continue to be exposed to more risks asso-
ciated with physical labor, military service, accidents, and 
injuries than women. One of the most commonly cited 
explanations for men’s greater risk of heart disease and lung 
cancer is their more widespread exposure to cigarette smok-
ing. Some researchers suggest that the change in cigarette 
smoking, both the increase in the number of women who 
smoke and the reduction in the number of men who smoke, 
contributes to the narrowing of the longevity advantage of 
women (Shrestha, 2006). 
The discrepancy in longevity between the African-American 
and Anglo populations in the United States can be seen in 
higher rates of death among the African-American popula-
tion from a wide range of causes including cardiovascular 
diseases, infections, lung disease, diabetes, and traumatic 
injuries associated with motor vehicle accidents, homicide, 
and other accidents. These health disparities can be attrib-
uted to the confounding of factors, many of which are asso-
ciated with lifelong exposure to poverty and inadequate 
access to health care resources. Starting in infancy, more 
African-American babies are born with low birth weight, 
making them more vulnerable to infant mortality. Poverty

CHAPTER 1 The Development Through Life Perspective
At present, we are the only developed country in the 
world that does not have national health coverage, resulting 
in a signifi cant proportion of the population that does not 
have health insurance. Presumably, longevity in the United 
States would improve once a universal health insurance pro-
gram is established (Cohen, 2004).
When you try to estimate your own life expectancy, 
you must consider projections for people in your country, 
region, and state, and in your age, educational, racial, and 
sex groups. Furthermore, research with identical twins fi nds 
that some components of longevity are genetically guided. 
People with long-lived ancestors are likely to be long lived 
themselves. Moreover, individual lifestyle factors have a great 
impact on longevity. 
Of the many factors that have been studied, educa-
tion has been consistently linked to health and longevity. 
Across many societies with many different models of edu-
cational opportunity, increases in years of schooling predict 
added years of life. The benefi t of more years of education 
for longevity has been observed among African Americans 
and Anglos, men and women. These benefi ts are explained 
in part by the relationship of education and wealth. People 
with more schooling have higher paying jobs. In addition, 
people with better paying jobs may have greater control over 
their time and less exposure to dangerous work conditions. 
Finally, more schooling is associated with better decision-
making skills that may infl uence health care, risk taking, and 
better self-monitoring of one’s health status (Cutler & Lieras-
Muney, 2006; Lieras-Muney, 2005). 
In addition to education, a variety of demographic, health, 
and lifestyle factors are associated with longevity and a high 
level of functioning in later life. These factors include the fol-
lowing: family income; being married; the absence of hyper-
tension, arthritis, or back pain; being a nonsmoker; having 
normal weight; and consuming a moderate amount of alco-
hol. A growing body of research emphasizes the potential 
benefi ts of a well-balanced diet combined with the strategic 
suggest that the best we can hope for is a healthier rather 
than a longer period of later life (Hayfl ick, 2000; Olshansky, 
Carnes, & Desesquelles, 2001). 
On the other hand, a recent government report fi nds that 
the United States is 48th among 227 countries and territories 
in life expectancy at birth. The life expectancy in developed 
countries including Canada, Greece, Australia, Switzerland, 
Japan, and Singapore is already greater than the life expec-
tancy projected for people in the United States in the year 
2015. It is diffi cult to imagine that over the next 25 years the 
United States would not be able to make progress in advanc-
ing average longevity to at least catch up with the life expec-
tancy that is already being experienced in other countries 
around the world (Shrestha, 2006). 
A second question is whether there is an absolute limit 
to the human life span. Currently, the oldest woman whose 
date of birth could be authenticated was Jeanne Calment of 
France, who died at age 122 years, 164 days, and, for a man, 
Christian Mortensen (a Danish immigrant to the United 
States), who died at age 115 years, 252 days. Some scientists, 
many of whom are investigating the genetic bases of aging 
and longevity, are optimistic about substantial increases in 
longevity. Experiments with genetic engineering in flies, 
worms, and mice have been able to increase longevity in 
these species by 50%. Other research has found that impos-
ing near-starvation dietary restrictions results in signifi cant 
increases in longevity in mice. These studies may not have 
immediate relevance for humans, but they suggest paths for 
further investigation (Couzin, 2003; Kirkwood, 2001). Some 
futurists argue that there is no necessary limit to human lon-
gevity. They suggest that with each generation comes the 
possibility of new discoveries and new adaptations that will 
extend longevity (De Magalhaes, 2003). 
Factors That Contribute 
to Longevity 
Looking back over the past 50 years, improvements in longev-
ity have been attributed to major reductions in the death rates 
from diseases of the heart and cerebrovascular diseases (com-
monly referred to as stroke). These improvements have been 
brought about by medical advances in diagnosis, emergency 
treatment, new medicines, and new patterns of care; changes 
in individual behavior patterns, especially smoking cessa-
tion and management of high blood pressure; and changes in 
social policies that provide greater access to medical resources, 
especially the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid. 
As we look to the future, there may be continued improve-
ment in the death rates from these diseases, but we also 
expect new medical advances in the prevention and treat-
ment of diseases such as cancer and diabetes, which have not 
shown much change in the death rate since the 1950s. Given 
the extent of investment in medical research and the height-
ened awareness of the health risks associated with obesity, 
we may expect important gains in prevention and treatment 
in the next 50 years (Shrestha, 2006). 
Age is relative, as is time. As the life span increases, the way we 
calculate our sense of maturity and aging changes. How old do 
you feel you are? In what way does your sense of being old 
depend on the situation?

getting married because, even if she waits until she is 40, she 
will still have 40 years of married life, and that is a long time 
to get along with one partner. In contrast, Tyler expects to 
live to be about 25. Several of his older brothers’ friends died 
of gunshot wounds, others died from drug overdoses, and 
some died in prison. He believes that he may as well take all 
the risks and have all the fun he can in life, because his time 
is short. He hopes to have lots of babies by many women 
so that some part of him will live on. Marie is celebrating 
her 90th birthday. She had expected to live to about age 75. 
Most of her friends and all her older siblings are dead. She 
is puzzled by the idea of having lived so long and sometimes 
wonders about the purpose of her long life. 
As we look to the future, advances in medical technology 
and treatment coupled with improved support services for 
older adults can lead to higher standards of living and new 
levels of functioning in later life. On the other hand, inequi-
ties in the distribution of health care services and other soci-
etal supports may result in a growing disparity in the quality 
of later life for various segments of the population. 
use of vitamin and mineral supplements to slow the cellular 
damage associated with aging (Carper, 1995; Harman, Holli-
day, & Meydani, 1998; Rusting, 1992). Other research high-
lights the value of daily activity—even 20 to 30 minutes of 
exercise and movement—for promoting health and longevity 
(Brown et al., 2003). Social integration has been identifi ed 
as a factor that influences health and longevity across the 
lifespan, from childhood through very old age (Uchino, Cac-
ciopo, & Kiekolt-Glaser, 1996; Berkman, Glass, Brissette, & 
Seeman, 2000; Kolata, 2007). 
Personal Assumptions about One’s 
Life Expectancy
Many of our most important life decisions are made with 
either an implicit or explicit assumption about how long we 
expect to live. Our perception of our life expectancy has an 
impact on our behavior, self-concept, attitudes, and outlook 
on the future. For example, Colleen expects to live to be 
about 80 years old. She reasons that there is no rush about 
Chapter Summary
Objective 1. To introduce the basic assumptions that 
guide the orientation of the text. 
This book presents the story of human development across 
the life span. The analysis is based on five assumptions: 
(1) Growth occurs at every period of life, from conception 
through very old age. (2) Individual lives show continuity 
and change as they progress through time. (3) We need to 
understand the whole person, because we function in an 
integrated manner. (4) Every person’s behavior must be ana-
lyzed in the context of relevant settings and personal relation-
ships. (5) People contribute actively to their development.
Objective 2. To introduce the psychosocial approach to 
the study of development, including the inter-relationship 
among the biological, psychological, and societal systems. 
Psychosocial theory, which provides the organizing frame-
work for the book, emphasizes interaction among the 
biological, psychological, and societal systems. As a result of 
maturation and change in each of these systems, individuals’ 
beliefs about themselves and their relationships are modifi ed. 
Although each life story is unique, we can identify important 
common patterns, allowing us to anticipate the future and to 
understand one another.
Objective 3. To note historical changes in life 
expectancy and examine the implications of these 
changes for the study of development over the life span.
Demographic information about the life span stimulates 
thought about one’s own life expectancy. In the United States, 
the average life expectancy increased by more than 50% dur-
ing the 20th century. This dramatic change affects how each 
of us views our own future. We need to study human devel-
opment in a constantly changing context. We can never be 
satisfi ed that the information from earlier periods will hold 
true for future generations.

CHAPTER 1 The Development Through Life Perspective
Further Reflection 
 1. How might people’s own decisions and goals infl uence 
the course of their development? 
 2. What are some examples in your own experience of 
how the biological, psychological, and societal systems 
interact? 
 3. What are your own direct experiences with poverty? 
How might poverty infl uence the biological, psycho-
lo gical, and societal systems and, thereby, infl uence the 
direction of development? 
 4. What are the critical settings in which development takes 
place? How do these settings change with age? 
 5. How does your culture infl uence your view of the life 
span? For example, what messages from your family, 
community, or ethnic group infl uence your sense of the 
distinctions between childhood, adolescence, adulthood, 
and elderhood? 
 6. What are your current thoughts about your life expec-
tancy? What are you doing now to increase your chances 
of living a long, healthy life? 
 7. How would you account for the fact that more education 
is associated with greater longevity in many countries 
around the world? 
 8. What are some implications for social policy of the in-
creased size of the adult and aging populations in com-
parison to the size of the population of young children 
and adolescents? 
aging provides an opportunity to examine the interac-
tion of the biological, psychological, and societal systems 
as they influence development in later life. It also intro-
duces some of the challenges of coping successfully with 
extreme longevity.

CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
IMAGINE THAT YOU are taking a road trip across the 
country. To plan your route and fi nd your way, you will 
need a map of the United States that indicates the major 
highways and the location of urban centers and scenic 
areas. However, you will probably want to get more 
detailed maps of the states you will visit. Once you arrive at 
a city, or a state or national park, you will need tourist maps 
showing the historic sites, shopping areas, hotels, and 
walking trails so that you can enjoy each spot to its fullest.
With respect to this book, psychosocial theory is like 
the map of the United States: It provides a broad, con-
ceptual umbrella for the study of human development. 
We provided an overview of the psychosocial approach 
in Chapter 1. More detail about that theory will be pre-
sented in Chapter 3. However, we need other theories to 
explain behavior at different levels of analysis. The theo-
ries presented in this chapter are like the maps of states, 
cities, and special scenic areas. They guide research and 
thinking in specifi c areas of human development. This 
chapter does not provide comprehensive coverage of all 
theories of human development, but a group of theories 
selected for their signifi cant impact in guiding research 
and intervention. Many theories presented here continue 
to be evaluated and challenged as new and competing 
ideas about human behavior emerge.
What Is a Theory?
Objective 1. To defi ne the concept of theory and 
explain how theories contribute to the study of 
development.
A theory is a logical system of concepts that helps explain 
observations and contributes to the development of a body 
of knowledge. We all have our informal, intuitive theories 
about social life. For example, the adage “The acorn doesn’t 
fall far from the tree” is an informal theory, which predicts 
that children are going to grow up to behave a lot like their 
parents. However, the idea of a scientifi c theory is quite dif-
ferent from an informal set of beliefs. In order for a set of 
ideas to reach the level of a formal scientifi c theory, it has 
to be supported by extensive evidence, including system-
atic experimentation and observation (Zimmerman, 2009). 
First, we consider the role of theory in the study of hu-
man development, including a defi nition of theory and 
an analysis of what a theory of development is likely to 
explain. Then we present basic concepts of seven major 
theories of human development. The theory of evolution 
provides a broad picture of species change over long time 
periods. Evolutionary theory places the study of individual 
development in the context of the history of the species. 
It links humans with other animal species and suggests 
ways of thinking about key periods of the life span that 
are critical for species survival. A forerunner of psychoso-
cial theory, psychosexual theory explains the relationship 
of mental activity to changing needs, wishes, and drives, 
with a particular focus on the role of sexual and aggres-
sive needs. Cognitive theory describes the maturation of 
capacities for logical thought. Learning theories, cultural 
theory, social role theory, and developmental systems 
theory each introduce mechanisms that explain how envi-
ronments guide the content and direction of growth.
In each section, a brief explanation of the theory and a 
few major constructs are presented, along with an analysis 
of the theory’s contributions to the study of development 
and links to the psychosocial approach. In subsequent 
chapters, additional ideas from many of the theories will 
be presented as they relate to specifi c topics. ■

you must fi rst understand what its assumptions are. 
Charles Darwin assumed that lower life forms “prog-
ress” to higher forms in the process of evolution. 
Freud assumed that all behavior is motivated and 
that the unconscious is a “storehouse” of motives and 
wishes. The assumptions of any theory may or may 
not be correct. Assumptions may be infl uenced by the 
following:
• The cultural context that dominates the theorist’s 
period of history
• The sample of observations from which the theorist 
has drawn inferences
• The current knowledge base of the fi eld
• The intellectual capacities of the theorist
 3. What does the theory predict?
Theories add new levels of understanding by suggest-
ing causal relationships, unifying diverse observations, 
and identifying the importance of events that may have 
gone unnoticed. Theories of human development offer 
explanations regarding the origins and functions of 
human behavior, predictions about changes that can be 
expected in behavior from one period of life to the next, 
and hypotheses about the mechanisms or processes that 
account for change.
There are many different types of theories, each with 
its own range of applicability. For example, there are 
personality theories, theories of learning, theories of 
decision making, theories of confl ict resolution, theories 
of group dynamics, theories of leadership, theories of 
counseling, theories of social work practice, and theo-
ries of family formation. Just within the fi eld of human 
development, there are many theories including those 
that account for language development, theories that 
focus on emotional bonds between parents and their 
children, and theories that address processes of change 
from one generation to the next.
A theory of development usually helps to explain how 
people change and grow over time, as well as how to 
account for continuity (Thomas, 1999). We expect a theory 
of human development to provide explanations about six 
questions:
 1. What is the direction of change over the life span?
We assume that there is a direction to development, 
that it is not random. Development is not the same as 
changing one’s hairstyle or deciding one day to play ten-
nis and the next to play soccer. Theories of development 
offer some big ideas about maturity and shed light on 
important ways in which thought, self-understanding, 
the capacity for social relationships, and the capacity 
for adaptation become increasingly complex and inte-
grated through the course of life. Some theories suggest 
that change takes place in a sequence of stages or quali-
tatively distinct periods of life. Other theories suggest 
processes that account for gradual change or highlight 
A formal scientific theory is a set of interconnected state-
ments, including assumptions, defi nitions, and hypotheses, 
which explain and interpret observations. The function of 
this set of interconnected statements is to describe unobserv-
able structures, mechanisms, or processes and to relate them 
to one another and to observable events.
Major theories reorganize the way we think about and 
understand the world. Einstein’s theory of relativity showed 
us that matter and energy are two forms of the same thing 
rather than totally distinct. Freud’s theory of psychosexual 
development showed us that emotional conflicts can be 
expressed unconsciously through physical symptoms. Once 
a scientifi c theory is introduced, it leads the way for testing 
and elaboration through additional research.
A formal theory should meet certain requirements. It 
should be logical and internally consistent, with no contra-
dictory statements. The hypothetical constructs should be 
translatable into testable hypotheses that can be explored 
through systematic research. The theory should be parsimo-
nious, which means that the theory should be simple, relying 
on as few assumptions, constructs, and propositions as pos-
sible while still accurately accounting for the observations. 
Parsimony is relative. For example, Freud hypothesized that 
there were fi ve stages of development; Erikson hypothesized 
that there were eight stages of development. Using the prin-
ciple of parsimony, one might conclude that Freud’s theory is 
a better one. However, Erikson’s theory provides a more dif-
ferentiated view of adulthood and aging, and, as a result, his 
theory offers more insight into the process of development 
over the life span. On the other hand, a theory that suggests 
30 or 40 stages of life might be viewed as overly complex 
and less parsimonious than one that provides a smaller num-
ber of integrated periods. Finally, a theory should integrate 
previous research, and it should deal with a relatively large 
area of science (Miller, 2009). Most current developmental 
theories do not meet all of these requirements of formal, sci-
entifi c theories. However, they offer a language of constructs 
and hypotheses that guides systematic inquiry and can com-
pare observations in order to build a body of knowledge.
In order to understand a theory, we must answer three 
questions:
 1. Which phenomena is the theory trying to explain?
A theory of intellectual development may include 
hypotheses about the evolution of the brain, the 
growth of logical thinking, or the capacity to use sym-
bolism. Such a theory is less likely to explain fears, 
motives, or friendship. Understanding the focus of 
the theory helps to identify its range of applicability. 
Although principles from one theory may have rel-
evance to another area of knowledge, a theory is evalu-
ated in terms of the behavior it was originally intended 
to explain.
 2. What assumptions does the theory make? 
Assumptions are the guiding premises underlying 
the logic of a theory. In order to evaluate a theory,

influence a person’s confidence about whether a new 
skill can be mastered. According to cognitive theory, 
emotions can contribute to the person’s attention 
and motivation to persist in seeking the solution to a 
problem.
 5. How do the environmental and social contexts affect 
individual development?
Individuals develop in context. Theories of human 
development provide ways of conceptualizing context 
and of highlighting which aspects of context are espe-
cially important in shaping the directions of growth. 
Should we focus on mother as context? Father? Both 
parents? Siblings? Friends? Spouse? School? Work? 
The physical environment of home or neighborhood? 
How do social constructions, including social class, 
race, ethnicity, and religion, become integrated into 
a person’s life story? How and in what ways do they 
matter?
Research on the interaction of environment and 
genetic predisposition has illustrated the complexity of 
these questions. For example, some genes are highly 
responsive to environmental influences. A serotonin 
transporter gene, 5-HTTLPR, has a short and long 
allele. Earlier studies had linked the gene to vulner-
ability to depression. Recent studies have shown that 
individuals who have two short alleles are more vul-
nerable to depression as young adults if they grew up 
in a cold, emotionally distant, or harsh family environ-
ment. Individuals with this same genetic makeup are 
less likely than others to experience depression if they 
grew up in a warm, nurturing, and supportive environ-
ment (Taylor et al., 2006). This kind of research illus-
trates the need for theories of development to consider 
the interactions of biological factors and environmental 
conditions that may be relevant at particular periods 
of life.
 6. What factors are likely to place the person at risk at 
specifi c periods of the life span?
Although humans have an enormous capacity for adap-
tation, some combination of conditions is likely to 
impede optimal growth. Each theory of human develop-
ment provides constructs that help us understand the 
nature of risks as well as predictions about conditions 
that increase risks. Some theories also offer differen-
tiated views of risk across the life span or at different 
critical life transitions. We look to theories of human 
development to help us understand how development 
might be disrupted.
In the field of human development, theory is dif-
ferentiated from research and from facts. The research 
process, which is described in some detail in the appen-
dix, may be guided by theory. However, the research 
process is a separate approach to building a knowledge 
base. For example, Piaget’s cognitive developmental 
theory introduced the idea that through direct interac-
tion with the physical world, infants gradually construct 
significant events that result in transitions at various 
points in life.
 2. What are the mechanisms that account for growth 
from conception through old age? Do these mecha-
nisms vary across the life span?
Theories of development identify the processes or 
experiences that bring about systematic change. In 
this chapter and throughout the text, we will present 
and explain a variety of mechanisms theorists offer 
for how growth and development occur. Some theo-
ries emphasize a biologically based, genetically guided 
plan for development. Others emphasize the role of 
the environment in shaping behavior and provid-
ing roles or settings that support new levels of func-
tioning. Still other theories emphasize the ongoing 
interaction of biological and environmental factors, 
characterizing development as a process of adaptive 
self-organization.
 3. How relevant are early experiences for later 
development?
Theories of development offer different ideas about 
the significance of early experiences for the psycho-
logical and behavioral organization of later periods of 
life. Some theories suggest that incidents from infancy 
and childhood play a powerful role in guiding the 
direction of development well into adulthood. Other 
theories emphasize the influence of contemporary 
events in guiding development by viewing the person 
as continuously adapting to new demands and new 
opportunities.
One important question that emerges in the study 
of development is the degree to which individuals can 
be characterized as resilient in the face of early stresses 
or deprivation. Current work in cognitive neuroscience 
suggests that there is a high degree of plasticity in the 
human brain. In cases of injury, one area of the brain 
can reorganize to take over functions of another area. 
Plasticity is observed across the life span, well into later 
life. The human brain has evolved to have a great degree 
of fl exibility, being able to adapt to a wide range of fam-
ily, cultural, language, and environmental conditions. At 
the same time, there is a growing literature about the 
risks of early exposure to harsh parenting and the long-
term consequences of these early negative experiences. 
This research suggests that events that unfold early in 
life may set a person on a trajectory that intensifies 
certain ways of thinking and feeling and narrows the 
options for recovery.
 4. How do physical, cognitive, emotional, and social 
functions interact?
Most theories of human development focus on a specifi c 
domain such as cognition, learning, social relationships, 
or the expression and management of emotions. How-
ever, they also consider the interplay of other domains. 
For example, according to social learning theory, feel-
ings of tension or anxiety in the learning situation can

thus passing their genetic characteristics on to future gen-
erations. This process is called adaptation. If the environ-
ment changed (e.g., in climate), only certain variations of 
organisms would survive, and again some species would 
evolve. Failure to adapt would lead to species extinction. 
Thus, in the context of changing environmental condi-
tions, the variability within a species ensures the species’ 
continuation or its development into new forms. Dar-
win viewed evolutionary change as taking place slowly 
and incrementally as individual organisms adapt and 
populations with similar adaptive characteristics come to 
dominate an environment or ecological niche.
Darwin described two aspects of evolution (Mayr, 1991). 
One is the gradual change within a species over time from 
earlier to later forms. For example, even though they are 
the same species, chimpanzees alive today are not identi-
cal to the chimpanzees that lived thousands of years ago. 
They have had to adapt to changing environmental condi-
tions, including alterations in food sources, landscapes, and 
threats. The second form of evolution is the breaking away 
from an earlier evolutionary lineage and the establishment 
of a new branch in the phylogenetic tree. This is the pro-
cess of speciation that contributes to biological diversity. 
For example, some combination of events led to the sepa-
ration of the hominids from homo erectus to homo sapiens 
about 250,000 years ago (Enard et al., 2002). For an exciting 
presentation on human evolution, go to the website of the 
American Museum of Natural History in New York City and 
go to the section on the Hall of Human Origins. Click on the 
History of Human Evolution.
The concept of inclusive fi tness was later added to the 
theory of natural selection (Hamilton, 1964). This idea 
suggests that fi tness is not only determined by an individ-
ual’s success in passing genes along to the next generation 
through reproduction. A characteristic can be selected if the 
genes are passed along to the next generation by promoting 
the survival and reproductive success of others who carry 
those genes. In human groups, behaviors that support one’s 
family members or that make it possible for one’s kin to be 
more attractive in the mating process would be considered 
examples of inclusive fitness. This concept highlights the 
adaptive advantage of supportive kin networks that selec-
tively direct their resources toward members of their family, 
kinship network, tribe, or ethnic group.
Advances in the fi eld of genetics coupled with advances in 
neuroscience have begun to shed new light on the evolution-
ary process (Begley, 2007). By analyzing the human genome, 
one can better compare humans to primates and other mam-
mals, leading to a clearer understanding of the likely points 
at which the brains of various species diverged. For example, 
in an analysis of the Y chromosome in a variety of popula-
tions, Peter Underhill and colleagues (Underhill et al., 2000) 
have estimated that all humans alive today are descendants 
of a small group of about 4,000 men and women who left 
Africa less than 100,000 years ago and settled throughout 
the rest of the world. These humans carried the FOXP2 gene 
a scheme for the permanent object. Piaget believed 
that infants gradually, through the first 18 months of 
life, gain an understanding that objects do not cease 
to exist even when they are out of sight. A growing 
body of research was stimulated by this theory, which 
addresses questions of what infants appear to know or 
expect about objects, and at what point in development 
this knowledge can be observed. The research relies on 
direct observations and experimental manipulations in 
order to describe what infants understand about objects. 
The results of this research have led to a more differenti-
ated view of what infants know about objects depending 
on the nature of the task, the kind of response the baby 
is required to make, and the setting where the baby is 
being studied. Thus, research often uncovers a more 
detailed analysis than is presented in the original theo-
retical formulation.
Facts are distinct from the theories that might try to 
explain or account for them. For example, in Chapter 
1, we pointed out that life expectancy at birth in the 
United States has increased over 50% from 1900 to the 
present. This fact is indisputable. There may be several 
theories about the factors that account for changes in 
longevity, each of which might infl uence the direction of 
research about longevity. However, these theories do not 
change the facts.
The Theory of Evolution
Objective 2a. To review the basic concepts of the 
theory of evolution and its implications for the study of 
human development.
The theory of evolution explains how diverse and increasingly 
more complex life forms come to exist. Evolutionary theory 
assumes that the natural laws that apply to plant and animal life 
also apply to humans. The law of natural selection explains 
how, over generations, species gradually change to respond 
to changing environmental conditions (Darwin, 1859/1979). 
Natural selection operates at the level of genes that are passed, 
via an organism’s reproductive process, from one generation to 
the next. Reproductive success, sometimes called fi tness, var-
ies among members of a species (Archer, 1991).
Every species produces more offspring than can sur-
vive to reproduce, because of limitations of the food sup-
ply and natural dangers. Darwin observed that there was 
quite a bit of variability among members of the same spe-
cies in any given location. Some individuals were bet-
ter suited than others to their immediate environment 
and, thus, were more likely to survive, mate, and pro-
duce offspring. These offspring were also more likely to 
have characteristics appropriate for that location. Over 
time, those members of the species that had the selective 
advantage would be more likely to survive and reproduce,

CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
on analyzing adaptive behavior patterns across species, evo-
lutionary psychology draws on principles of evolution to 
understand the human mind. “The mind is a set of infor-
mation processing machines that were designed by natural 
selection to solve adaptive problems faced by our hunter-
gatherer ancestors” (Cosmides & Tooby, 1997). This focus 
takes us to a time when humans lived in small, nomadic 
groups, traveling from place to place to fi nd sources of food 
and trying to protect themselves from the dangers of preda-
tory animals, weather, illness, and other humans. This way 
of life existed for more than 2 million years, during which 
time various human species (along with their human minds) 
emerged. From this perspective, the mind is highly adapted 
to solve the problems faced by these human ancestors, but 
it may not be well adapted to solve the new problems that 
have emerged in our recent industrial and postindustrial way 
of life.
From an evolutionary perspective, any behavior can be 
assessed by asking a few basic questions: What behavior is 
necessary to achieve a goal? How much energy is needed to 
achieve the goal? When should the organism stop the activ-
ity? What should the organism do next? These questions 
suggest that the organism has to recognize the nature of a 
problem and bring to bear the best “tool” needed to solve 
the problem (Neese, 2001). There are start-up costs to begin-
ning any new behavior, so the most adaptive responses will 
contribute to long-term fi tness. Once a behavior has been 
started, the organism has to assess how hard and how long to 
persist at the task. There is risk in putting too much energy 
into one problem and ignoring other important tasks.
The work of David Buss on mating strategies provides an 
example of the approach that evolutionary psychology takes 
to understanding human behavior. According to evolution-
ary theory, one of the key components of fi tness is the mat-
ing process.
Successful mating requires solutions of a number of diffi cult 
adaptive problems. These include selecting a fertile mate, 
out-competing same-sex rivals in attracting a mate, fending 
off mate poachers (those who try to lure one’s mate away), 
preventing the mate from leaving, and engaging in all of the 
necessarily sexual and social behaviors required for success-
ful conception to take place. (Buss, 2006, p. 239)
Based on this analysis, Buss argued that the mate prefer-
ences of one sex will infl uence the basis upon which mem-
bers of the opposite sex will compete to attract a mate. These 
two factors co-evolve. In other words, the qualities that are 
viewed as desirable by one sex infl uence the ways that the 
opposite sex competes. As a result, in subsequent genera-
tions the qualities that are most highly desired by one sex 
will be more likely to be present in the opposite sex. In 
cross-national research, Buss found that women in many dif-
ferent cultures valued men who were likely to be successful 
breadwinners and who exhibited such qualities as ambition, 
industriousness, and high social status. These qualities are 
that supports advanced language capacity and other sym-
bolic and representational arts.
Ethology. Two subspecialties that have emerged from 
evolutionary theory are ethology and evolutionary psychol-
ogy. Ethology is the study of the functional signifi cance of 
expressive behavior in its social context from an evolutionary 
perspective (LaFreniere, 2000). This means that ethologists 
focus on describing the unique adaptive behaviors of specifi c 
species, such as mating, caregiving, play, or strategies for 
obtaining resources. They are especially interested in behav-
iors that appear to be spontaneous and that provide some 
type of adaptive advantage. An example is the infant’s smile. 
Smiles occur early in the postnatal period. They function as a 
powerful signal that evokes a caregiving response. Over time, 
the infant’s smile takes on a more complex meaning within 
the social context. Yet it begins as an unlearned behavior that 
has important survival value. Through comparisons among 
species, the study of the conditions that evoke and maintain 
adaptive behaviors helps to clarify the role of behavior in the 
long-term survival of the species (Charlesworth, 1992).
Evolutionary Psychology. Evolutionary psychology is 
the study of the evolutionary origins of mental structures, 
emotions, and social behavior. Whereas ethology focuses 
From an evolutionary perspective, the attachment behavioral 
system is central to the offspring’s survival. Adults have strate-
gies for monitoring and protecting their young, and infants have 
capacities for alerting their caregivers when they are frightened 
or upset. What behaviors in human infant-mother pairs help 
them stay connected in times of distress?

certain genetic predispositions and not others. Infants must 
adapt to a variety of environmental conditions including dif-
ferences in the quality of parenting, adequacy of resources, 
and competition for resources with other siblings. Child-
hood experiences shape the future of the human species by 
providing the context for the establishment of attachments, 
meaningful social competence, and problem-solving capaci-
ties. These in turn have a bearing on an individual’s behavior 
in adulthood—particularly the ability to form intimate rela-
tionships and to parent one’s offspring. In adolescence and 
adulthood, the evolutionary focus shifts to emerging repro-
ductive capacities—the ability to fi nd a mate, to reproduce, 
and to rear one’s young so that they can reach their own 
reproductive age. With advanced age, the forces of selection 
weaken. Because early humans died at a relatively young age 
due to predators, diseases, and environmental hazards, the 
selective advantage of characteristics that might be noticeable 
in later life was not preserved. As a result, the genome does 
not guide the direction of development to preserve high lev-
els of functioning in later life as it so clearly does in infancy, 
childhood, and the transition through puberty to reproduc-
tive adulthood (Baltes, 1997). More rests on culture, lifestyle, 
and social resources to support successful aging.
The evolutionary perspective draws attention to the inter-
connection between an individual’s life history and the long-
range history of the species. Principles of natural selection 
operate slowly over generations. However, the reproduc-
tive success of individuals over the course of their own life 
span determines whether their genetic material continues 
to be represented in the larger population. The evolutionary 
perspective directs attention to the importance of variabil-
ity for a species’ survival. Although theories of develop-
ment typically focus on general patterns of continuity and 
change across individuals, evolutionary theory prompts one 
to attend to the importance of individual differences in the 
study of development. These differences help explain how 
the human species adapts successfully across a wide variety 
of environmental conditions.
Links to the Psychosocial Approach
The psychosocial approach translates the idea of species 
adaptation to the individual level. Individuals encounter a 
necessary developmental struggle between their own traits 
and capacities and the requirements and demands of the 
environment. Each generation within a society faces similar 
challenges to cycle critical resources to the young, to form 
enduring social bonds that will result in a reproductive envi-
ronment, to nurture competence and a capacity for caring 
in the new generation of adults, and to inspire younger gen-
erations with hope and anticipation about the prospects of 
growing old. Within cultural groups, rites and rituals serve to 
protect and preserve resources, direct the rearing of children, 
and assist individuals through key transitions. Groups that 
adapt successfully are those that effectively cycle resources, 
hypothesized to support the woman’s concern that her long-
term partner will invest in her and her offspring. In contrast, 
men consistently valued physical appearance more than 
women did, especially physical features that convey health 
and a likelihood of reproductive success. Thus men view 
women as desirable partners who are youthful, have clear 
smooth skin, shiny hair, full lips, and a nicely rounded sym-
metrical body—features that convey the promise of fertility 
(Buss, 2006). Thus, according to the theory, in an effort to 
compete for the affections of women men would emphasize 
their high status, industriousness, and fi nancial success. In 
order to compete for men, women would emphasize their 
physical attractiveness.
Implications for Human Development
Darwin’s theory of evolution by means of natural selection 
provided the foundational theoretical framework for much 
of American psychology through its infl uences on William 
James, G. Stanley Hall, John Dewey, and their students. An 
underlying premise of natural selection is that new or emerg-
ing capacities are retained as a result of their adaptive value. 
This perspective was elaborated by William James in defense 
of consciousness itself. James argued that consciousness 
evolved and has been preserved among humans because it 
contributes positively to the chances of survival. By being 
able to set a goal, plan a course of action, assess progress 
toward that goal, and modify actions as needed, conscious-
ness and its corollary, free will, increase the ability of human 
beings to adapt effectively to whatever environments or envi-
ronmental changes they encounter (James, 1890; Dewey, 
1896; Green, 2009).
With its focus on reproductive success, evolutionary 
theory highlights three phases of the life span: (1) healthy 
growth and development leading up to the reproductive 
period; (2) success in mating and the conception of off-
spring; and (3) the ability to parent offspring so they can sur-
vive, reach reproductive age, and bear offspring of their own 
(Charlesworth, 1992).
Humans are most vulnerable during infancy and child-
hood. Children require nurture and care in order to survive 
to reproductive age. Biological capacities and the environ-
ments in which they can be expressed operate together to 
produce behavior. A genetic plan, shaped through hundreds 
of generations, guides infants’ predispositions, capacities, 
and sensitivities. Evolutionary theory points out that infants 
come into the world with a range of innate capacities and 
potentials. They are able to establish social contact, organize 
information, and recognize and communicate their needs.
The genetic potential of human infants is much greater 
than the behaviors actually exhibited in any particular cul-
tural context. Infants have to be able to respond to the spe-
cifi c language environment, diet, parenting behaviors, and 
other physical and social contexts in which they are born. 
Particular environments are likely to take advantage of

CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
relations theory, and (7) ego psychology. All are contemporary 
elaborations of psychosexual theory.
Motivation and Behavior
Freud assumed that all behavior (except that resulting from 
fatigue) is motivated. He thought that all behavior has meaning; 
it does not occur randomly or without purpose. Many of the 
concepts of psychosexual theory attempt to describe the pro-
cesses by which sexual and aggressive drives motivate behavior. 
A related assumption of psychosexual theory is that there is an 
area of the mind called the unconscious that is a storehouse of 
powerful, primitive motives of which the person is unaware. 
Unconscious as well as conscious motives may motivate behav-
ior simultaneously. Thus, behaviors that may appear to be 
somewhat unusual or extremely intense are described as mul-
tiply determined—that is, a single behavior expresses many 
motives, some of which the person can recognize and control 
and others that are guided by unconscious thought.
Freud’s analysis of normal development as well as his expla-
nations for specifi c forms of mental illness are derived from his 
understanding of the ways that sexual and aggressive drives 
press for expression and are inhibited or given various outlets 
in thoughts, dreams, behaviors, and symptoms. The term drive 
is sometimes referred to as psychic energy, tension, instincts, 
or libido. Drives can be thought of as sexual and aggressive 
forces that have a biological or somatic origin—they are a 
result of some metabolic function, but are also intimately 
linked to psychological processes. Freud envisioned a model 
in which the energy behind the drives builds up as it seeks sat-
isfaction. The psychic energy that is embodied in these drives 
can be expressed in a variety of ways, but the energy itself will 
not be destroyed. Drives have a power or force. A person can 
experience a drive along a continuum from mild to strong. 
Drives have an aim—a desire to be satisfi ed that may be han-
dled immediately, delayed, or possibly redirected so that it is 
only partly satisfi ed. When possible, drives are satisfi ed imme-
diately to reduce tension and achieve a state of equilibrium. 
Drives have an object—a person or thing that allows the drive 
to achieve its aim. The object of the drive is closely linked to 
the specifi c environment in which the child functions. Thus, 
in order to understand how drives are satisfi ed one must have 
a concrete understanding of the social and physical resources 
that are available to a child at a specifi c developmental period 
(Ritvo & Solnit, 1995). Over time, a person becomes able to 
delay the satisfaction of the drives and fi nds increasingly fl ex-
ible and socially appropriate ways to achieve satisfaction.
Domains of Consciousness
One of the most enduring contributions of psychosexual 
theory is the analysis of the topography of mental activity 
(see Figure 2.1). Freud thought the human mind was like 
an iceberg. Conscious processes are the tip that protrudes 
out of the water; they make up only a small part of the mind. 
Our conscious thoughts are fl eeting. We can have only a few 
of them at any one time. As soon as energy is diverted from a 
thought or image, it disappears from consciousness.
help new members, and pass along information that will 
help individuals cope with future challenges. For a list of the 
key concepts of evolutionary theory, see Table 2.1.
Psychosexual Theory
Objective 2b. To review the basic concepts of psycho-
sexual theory and their implications for the study of 
human development.
Evolutionary theory calls attention to the importance of the 
reproductive functions as they contribute to fi tness and long-
term species adaptation. In contrast, psychosexual theory 
focuses on the impact of sexual and aggressive drives on 
the individual’s psychological functioning. It distinguishes 
between the impact of drives on mental activity and their 
effect on reproductive functions. The theory assumes that 
very young children have strong sexual and aggressive drives 
that find unique modes of expression through successive 
developmental stages. Throughout childhood, adolescence, 
and adult life, sexual and aggressive drives operate to direct 
aspects of one’s fantasies, self-concept, problem-solving strat-
egies, and social interactions.
A unique feature of psychosexual theory is the impor-
tance placed on childhood experiences for shaping adult 
thoughts and behavior. The theory focuses on both normative 
and pathological patterns of growth and development that 
result from the socialization pressures that act on biologically 
based drives. The theory highlights the relevance of certain 
primary social relationships, especially the mother-child 
and father-child dyads, for their role in determining the 
expression and gratification of needs and the internaliza-
tion of moral standards. Many contributions of psychosexual 
theory continue to infl uence the study of development and 
approaches to therapeutic interventions.
Seven ideas from psychosexual theory are reviewed in 
the chapter: (1) motivation and behavior, (2) domains of 
consciousness, (3) the structure of personality, (4) stages 
of development, (5) defense mechanisms, (6) object

is unaware (Bargh & Morsella, 2008). Behaviors that are 
unusual or extremely intense may not make sense if they 
are explained only in terms of conscious motives. However, 
through certain techniques used in psychotherapy, the link 
between unconscious wishes and fears and overt behaviors 
often can be established.
Here is an example of the complexity of the process. A 
patient of Freud’s who had recently been married sometimes 
forgot his wife’s name. Freud hypothesized that consciously 
the man felt he loved his wife and thought they were happy 
together. Freud thought that forgetting the wife’s name pro-
vided a clue to the content of the man’s unconscious. In his 
unconscious, the man had strong, negative feelings about his 
wife, feelings that were so unacceptable that they could not 
be allowed expression. By forgetting his wife’s name, Freud 
reasoned that the young man could express some level of 
hostility toward her and, at the same time, punish himself 
for his unconscious anger toward her.
Three Structures of Personality
Freud (1933/1964) described three components of personal-
ity: the id, the ego, and the superego. In his writings about 
these structures, Freud suggested a developmental progres-
sion in which id exists alone at birth, ego emerges during 
infancy, and the superego takes shape in early childhood. In 
adulthood, the three structures must fi nd an effective pattern 
of interaction in order to support adaptation.
Id. The id is the source of instincts and impulses. It is the 
primary source of psychic energy, and it exists from birth. 
Freud believed that newborn infants’ mental processes were 
comprised completely of id impulses, and that the ego and 
superego emerged later, drawing their energy from the id.
The preconscious is analogous to the part of the iceberg 
near the waterline. Material in the preconscious can be made 
conscious if attention is directed to it. Preconscious thoughts 
are readily accessible to consciousness through focused atten-
tion. You may not be thinking about your hometown or favor-
ite desserts right now, but if someone were to ask you about 
either of them you could readily recall and discuss them.
The unconscious, like the rest of the iceberg, is hidden 
from view. It is a vast network of content and processes that 
are actively barred from consciousness. Freud hypothesized 
that the content of the unconscious, including wishes, fears, 
impulses, and repressed memories, plays a major role in 
guiding behavior even though we cannot explain the con-
nections consciously. Freud included in his use of the term 
unconscious unintentional behaviors, such as slips of the 
tongue or mistakes, the source or cause of which the person 
Freud’s patients visited him 
in his offi ce in Vienna, sur-
rounded by cultural artifacts 
that were sources of stimu-
lation to his own thinking. 
Central to the offi ce was the 
famous couch. Freud invented 
the technique of free associa-
tion as a way to gain insight 
into the unconscious.

do with the person’s relation to the environment. It includes 
a multitude of cognitive processes such as perception, learn-
ing, memory, judgment, self-awareness, and language skills 
that allow a person to take in information, process it, assess 
its implications, and select a course of action. Freud thought 
the ego begins to develop in the fi rst six or eight months of 
life and is well established by the age of 2 or 3. Other scholars 
view the ego processes as present from birth (Moore, 1995). 
Of course, much change and growth occur over time as the 
ego responds to demands from the environment and finds 
strategies that support effective functioning. The ego also 
responds to the demands of the id and the superego and helps 
the person satisfy needs, live up to ideals and standards, and 
establish a healthy emotional balance.
The ego operates according to the reality principle. 
Under this principle, the ego protects the person by wait-
ing to gratify id impulses until a socially acceptable form of 
expression or gratifi cation can be found. In the ego, primary 
process thought becomes subordinated to a more reality-
oriented process, called secondary process thought. This 
process begins to dominate as the ego matures.
Secondary process thought is the kind of logical, sequen-
tial thinking that we usually mean when we discuss think-
ing. It allows people to plan and act in order to engage the 
world and to achieve gratifi cation in personally and socially 
acceptable ways. It enables people to delay gratifi cation. It 
helps people assess plans by examining whether they will 
really work. This last process is called reality testing.
Superego. The superego includes both a punishing and 
a rewarding function. The conscience, which includes ideas 
about which behaviors and thoughts are improper, unac-
ceptable, and wrong, carries out the punishing function. The 
ego ideal, which includes ideas about what behaviors and 
thoughts are admirable, acceptable, and worthy of praise, 
carries out the rewarding function. Freud’s work led him to 
conclude that the superego does not begin to develop until 
the age of 5 or 6 and probably is not fi rmly established until 
several years later. Other theorists have suggested that the 
roots of the superego emerge in infancy as the child becomes 
differentiated from the caregiver and aware of the possibility 
of disrupting the close bond with this loving object (Klein, 
1948). Because it is formed during early childhood, the 
superego tends to be harsh and unrealistic in its demands. 
It is often just as illogical and unrelenting in its search for 
proper behavior as the id is in its search for pleasure. When 
a child thinks about behaving in a morally unacceptable way, 
the superego sends a warning by producing feelings of anxi-
ety and guilt.
The superego is developed through a process called 
identification. Motivated by love, fear, and admiration, 
children actively imitate their parents’ characteristics and 
internalize their values. Through identification, parents’ 
values become the ideals and aspirations of their children. 
In this way, the moral standards of a society are transmitted 
from one generation to the next.
The id expresses its demands according to the pleasure 
principle: People are motivated to seek pleasure and avoid 
pain. The pleasure principle does not take into account the 
feelings of others, society’s norms, or agreements between 
people. Its rule is to achieve the immediate satisfaction of 
impulses and discharge of energy. When you lie to a friend to 
protect your image, or when you cut ahead of people in line 
so you won’t have to wait, you are operating according to the 
pleasure principle.
The logic of the id is also the logic of dreams. This kind 
of thinking is called primary process thought. It is charac-
terized by a lack of concern for the constraints of reality. In 
primary process thought, there are no negatives. Everything 
is yes. There is no time. Nothing happens in the past or in the 
future. Everything is now. Symbolism becomes fl exible. One 
object may symbolize many things, and many different objects 
may mean the same thing. Many male faces can all represent 
the father. The image of a house may be a symbol for one’s 
mother, a lover, or the female genitalia as well as for a house.
Ego. Ego is a term that has two related meanings. One is the 
idea of ego as a person’s self, including one’s physical self, self-
concept, self-esteem, and mental representations of the self in 
relation to others. This sense of ego emerges as psychic energy 
is directed toward the self—a process that is sometimes called 
primary narcissism. The idea is that the sense of self is born 
out of self-love, an enthusiasm and excitement for one’s body, 
one’s experiences, and one’s emerging sense of agency. The 
second idea of ego refers to all mental functions that have to 
In each of us, the id is the source of instincts and impulses.

Psychosexual Theory | 31
subordination of the child’s will to the demands of the cul-
ture (via parents) for appropriate toilet habits.
The phallic stage begins during the third year of life and 
may last until the child is 6. It is a period of heightened gen-
ital sensitivity in the absence of the hormonal changes that 
accompany puberty. Freud described the behavior of children 
at this stage as bisexual. They direct sexualized activity toward 
both sexes and engage in self-stimulation. This is the stage 
during which the Oedipal or Electra complex is observed.
The Oedipal complex in boys and the Electra complex 
in girls result from ambivalence surrounding heightened 
sexuality. According to psychosexual theory, the child has 
a strong, sexualized attraction to the parent of the opposite 
sex, and the same-sex parent becomes a fantasized rival. The 
child may desire to have the exclusive attention of one parent 
and may fantasize that the other parent will leave, or perhaps 
die. At the same time, the child fears that amorous overtures 
toward the desired parent may result in hostility or retribu-
tion from the parent of the same sex. The child also worries 
that this beloved, same-sex parent will withdraw love. Paren-
tal threats intended to prevent the child from masturbating, 
and fantasies of the possibility of castration or bodily mutila-
tion, may add to the child’s fears that sexualized fantasies are 
going to result in punishment or withdrawal of love.
An important component of the Oedipal or Electra com-
plex dynamic is the view of the young child as engaged in 
complex, conflicting wishes that involve the mother-father-
child triad. Many competing impulses come into play: 
the conflict between wanting to satisfy sexual drives and 
the awareness that self-stimulation is not socially acceptable; 
the confl ict between wanting to remain a child who is loved 
and cared for by both parents and the desire to assume a more 
mature role in the eyes of the opposite-sex parent; the anger 
and rivalry experienced toward the same-sex parent and the 
desire to preserve that parent’s love and admiration; and the 
pressures to embrace one’s own gender identity and the envy 
one feels toward the opposite sex. In a successful resolution 
of the Oedipal or Electra confl ict, the superego emerges as a 
strong structure that aids the ego in controlling unacceptable 
impulses. Through a process of identifi cation with one’s par-
ents’ moral and ethical values, the child achieves a new level 
of autonomy, and at the same time receives the admiration 
and approval of both parents who see the child as moving in 
the direction of maturity and self-control. Most of the intense 
and painful confl icts of this period are repressed, and the ego 
emerges with a new degree of self-esteem and confi dence about 
the child’s place in the family structure (Tyson & Tyson, 1995).
Once the Oedipal or Electra confl ict is resolved, the child 
enters a period of latency. During this stage, which lasts 
from about 7 years until puberty, no new signifi cant confl icts 
or impulses arise. The primary personality development dur-
ing this period is the maturation of the ego.
A final stage of development begins with the onset of 
puberty: the genital stage. During this period, the person 
fi nds ways of satisfying sexual impulses in mature, dyadic rela-
tionships. Adolescence brings about a reawakening of Oedipal 
The Relationship of Id, Ego, and Superego. Ego pro-
cesses work toward satisfying id impulses through thoughts 
and actions without generating strong feelings of guilt in the 
superego. In one sense, the ego processes serve both the id 
and the superego, striving to provide gratifi cation, but in mor-
ally and socially acceptable ways. In another sense, ego is the 
executive of personality. The strength of the ego determines the 
person’s effectiveness in meeting needs, handling the demands 
of the superego, and dealing with the demands of reality. If 
the ego is strong and can establish a good balance among id, 
superego, and environmental demands, the person is satisfi ed 
and free from immobilizing guilt and feelings of worthlessness.
When id and superego are stronger than ego, the person 
may be tossed and turned psychologically by strong desires 
for pleasure and strong constraints against attaining those 
desires. When environmental demands are strong and the 
ego is weak, for example when an adolescent is confronted 
by strong pressures for peer conformity and the threat of 
peer rejection, a person may also be overwhelmed. Accord-
ing to psychosexual theory, it is the breakdown of the ego 
that leads to mental disorder.
Stages of Development
Freud assumed that the most signifi cant developments in per-
sonality take place during fi ve life stages from infancy through 
adolescence with the primary emphasis given to the fi rst fi ve 
or six years of life. After that time, according to Freud, the 
essential pattern for expressing and controlling impulses has 
been established. Later life serves only to uncover new modes 
of gratifi cation and new sources of frustration.
The stages Freud described refl ect his emphasis on sex-
uality as a driving force. Freud used the term sexuality 
quite broadly, referring to the full range of physical plea-
sure, from sucking to sexual intercourse. He also attached 
a positive, life-force symbolism to the concept of sexuality, 
suggesting that sexual impulses provide a thrust toward 
growth and renewal. At each stage, a particular body zone 
is of heightened sexual importance. The shift in focus from 
one body zone to the next is due largely to the biologically 
based unfolding of physical maturation. The five stages 
Freud identifi ed are the oral, anal, phallic, latent, and geni-
tal stages.
During the oral stage, in the fi rst year of life, the mouth 
is the site of sexual and aggressive gratifi cation. Babies use 
their mouths to explore the environment, to express tension, 
and to experience pleasure. Freud characterized infants as 
passive and dependent. They take things in, absorbing expe-
rience just as they swallow milk. As infants learn to delay 
gratifi cation, the ego becomes more clearly differentiated and 
they become aware of the distinction between the self and 
others. With this awareness comes the realization that all 
wishes cannot be satisfi ed.
In the anal stage, during the second year of life, the anus 
is the most sexualized body part. With the development 
of the sphincter muscles, a child learns to expel or with-
hold feces at will. The confl ict at this stage focuses on the

thoughts from awareness). A more diverse set of defenses, 
requiring greater cognitive complexity, becomes available in 
the course of development. In situations of greatest threat, 
denial is often the initial defense used, regardless of age.
According to Freud, the basic defense mechanism is 
repression, a process whereby unacceptable impulses are 
pushed into the unconscious. It is as if a wall were con-
structed between the unconscious and the conscious mind 
so that anxiety-provoking thoughts and feelings cannot enter 
consciousness. With unacceptable thoughts and impulses far 
from awareness, the person is protected from uncomfortable 
feelings of anxiety and may devote the remaining psychic 
energy to interchange with the interpersonal and physical 
environments. This defensive strategy has two major costs. 
First, it takes energy to continue to protect the conscious 
mind from these thoughts, thereby reducing the amount of 
mental energy available to cope with other daily demands. 
Second, if too many thoughts and feelings are relegated to 
repression, the person loses the use of the emotional system 
as a means of monitoring and evaluating reality.
The following are defense mechanisms:
Repression: Unacceptable wishes are barred from conscious 
thought.
Projection: Unacceptable wishes are attributed to someone 
else.
Reaction formation: Unacceptable feelings are expressed by 
the opposite feelings.
Regression: One avoids confronting confl icts and stresses 
by reverting to behaviors that were effective and comfort-
ing at an earlier life stage.
Displacement: Unacceptable impulses are expressed toward 
a substitute target.
Rationalization: Unacceptable feelings and actions are 
justifi ed by logical or pseudo-logical explanations.
Isolation: Feelings are separated from thoughts.
Denial: Parts of external reality are denied.
Sublimation: Unacceptable wishes are channeled to socially 
acceptable behaviors.
All people resort to defense mechanisms at various times 
in their lives. These mechanisms not only reduce anxiety but 
may lead to positive social outcomes. Physicians who use 
isolation may be able to function effectively because they are 
able to apply their knowledge without being hindered by 
their feelings. Children who rationalize defeat may be able 
to protect their self-esteem by viewing themselves favorably. 
The child who projects angry feelings onto someone else 
may fi nd that this technique stimulates a competitive orien-
tation that enhances performance.
Regression is an especially important defense when con-
sidered from a developmental perspective. Many theorists 
suggest that development is a “spiraling” process in which 
forward movement and increased integration of complex 
functions may alternate with temporary backsliding or 
return to a more comfortable, less demanding position. In 
or Electra confl icts and a reworking of earlier childhood iden-
tifi cations. Freud explained the tension of adolescence as the 
result of the sexual threat that the mature adolescent poses to 
the family unit. In an effort to avoid this threat, adolescents 
may withdraw from their families or temporarily devalue their 
parents. With the selection of a permanent sex partner, the 
threat of intimacy between young people and their parents 
diminishes. At the end of adolescence, a more autonomous 
relationship with one’s parents becomes possible.
Freud believed that the psychological conflicts that 
arise during adolescence and adulthood result from a fail-
ure to satisfy or express specifi c childhood wishes. At any 
of the childhood stages, sexualized impulses may have been 
so frustrated or overindulged that the person continues to 
seek their gratifi cation at later stages of life. Freud used the 
term fi xation to refer to continued use of pleasure-seeking 
or anxiety-reducing behaviors appropriate to an earlier stage 
of development. Because no person can possibly satisfy all 
wishes at every life stage, normal development depends on 
the ability to channel the energy from those impulses into 
activities that either symbolize the impulses or express 
them in a socially acceptable form. This process is called 
 sublimation. During adolescence and early adulthood, pat-
terns of impulse expression, fi xation, and sublimation crys-
tallize into a life orientation. From this point on, the content 
of the id, the regulating functions of the superego, and the 
executive functions of the ego rework the struggles of child-
hood through repeated episodes of engagement, conflict, 
and impulse gratifi cation or frustration.
Defense Mechanisms
Much of the ego’s work involves mediating the conflicts 
between the id’s demands for gratifi cation and the superego’s 
demands for good behavior. This work is conducted outside 
the person’s awareness. When unconscious confl icts threaten 
to break through into consciousness, the person experi-
ences anxiety. If the ego functions effectively, it pushes these 
confl icts into the unconscious, thereby protecting the per-
son from unpleasant emotions. The ego satisfi es desires in 
acceptable ways by directing behavior and social interaction.
Strong, unresolvable conflicts may leave a person in a 
state of constant anxiety and symptoms may emerge. A per-
son who feels a desire that is thought to be very “bad,” such 
as an unconscious wish to harm a parent or to be sexually 
intimate with a sibling, may experience anxiety without rec-
ognizing its source. The unexpressed drive continues to seek 
gratification. The unpleasant emotional state may preoc-
cupy the person and make it diffi cult to handle the normal 
demands of day-to-day life. Defense mechanisms protect 
the person from anxiety so that effective functioning can 
be preserved. They distort, substitute, or completely block 
out the source of the conflict. They are usually initiated 
unconsciously. Often the defense mechanism used depends 
on a person’s age and the intensity of the perceived threat. 
Younger children tend to use denial and repression (pushing 

 
Psychosexual Theory | 33
In this phase, a tension arises between wanting to explore the 
environment beyond the mother, and wanting to be reassured 
of the mother’s continuous presence. During this time, there 
is an assumption that infants have a hard time integrating the 
positive and negative interactions they have with their mother, 
leading to splitting between the good and the bad mother.
By about 24 months, the child is able to integrate the 
frustrating, angry, and loving memories of interactions with 
mother into a stable representation of self and other. The 
child achieves a greater tolerance for strains in the relation-
ship with the mother, knowing that the basic bond is plea-
surable and positive. Over time, the representation of the 
integrated, loving, caring mother is internalized through 
identifi cation, so that the child can use this representation 
for self-comfort. At the same time, the internalization of the 
loving mother contributes positively to the child’s sense of 
self-esteem. “I am someone who is safe, loved, and valued.” 
The child experiences the stability of not only giving and 
receiving love in the interpersonal domain, but integrates 
a sense of being loveable into a component of the constant 
self. The process is viewed as ongoing because this represen-
tation may be altered through subsequent life events, and the 
internalized representation of the mother is never a complete 
substitute for the real mother’s love (Tyson & Tyson, 1995).
The path toward maturity requires that the person achieve 
a sense of vitality, stability, and inner cohesiveness that is for-
mulated through interpersonal transactions. In the relational 
perspective, psychopathology or dysfunction arises when a 
person internalizes rigid, rejecting, or neglectful relational 
experiences and then uses these internalizations to anticipate 
or respond to real-life social encounters. Because the inter-
nalized relational pattern is familiar and well learned, the 
person is reluctant to give it up even if it leads to feelings of 
isolation, anxiety, or self-loathing (Messer & Warren, 1995).
Ego Psychology
In his structural theory, Freud introduced the concept of ego 
and its executive functions in managing the expression of 
impulses, negotiating between the id and the superego, striv-
ing to attain goals embedded in the ego ideal, and assessing 
reality.  Anna Freud took these ideas further in The Ego and 
the Mechanisms of Defense  (1936/1946), outlining new ego 
capacities that emerge from infancy through adolescence. 
She highlighted the various threats that the id poses to the 
ego at each stage of development, and provided a classifi ca-
tion of the defense mechanisms the ego uses to protect itself 
from unruly and unacceptable impulses.
Anna Freud gave special attention to the period of adoles-
cence as a time of increased sexual and aggressive energy that 
is linked to the biological changes of puberty. At this time, 
children are likely to be overwhelmed by libidinal energy 
and the ego is more or less fi ghting for its life. Anger and 
aggression become more intense, sometimes to the point of 
getting out of hand. Appetites become enormous. Oral and 
anal interests come to the surface again expressed as pleasure 
psychosexual theory, regression may occur when a person 
(child or adult) reverts to an earlier form of drive satisfaction, 
immature forms of relationships with others, lower moral 
standards, or more simplistic ways of thinking and solving 
problems. Anna Freud (1965) and Peter Blos (1967) both 
wrote about the idea that regression can serve ego develop-
ment if it is not met with extreme disapproval. Sometimes 
it is necessary to return to an earlier mode of functioning in 
order to resolve confl icts that were inadequately resolved at 
that time, or to engage in a kind of playful childishness in 
order to achieve a new level of mastery. Most obviously, in 
the creative process, a certain amount of regressive fantasy 
can unlock possible associations that make sense according 
to primary process thinking but are censored in secondary 
process thinking (Tyson & Tyson, 1995).
Object Relations Theory
Object relations theory is a modern adaptation of psy-
choanalytic theory that places less emphasis on the drives 
of aggression and sexuality as motivational forces and more 
emphasis on human relationships as the primary motiva-
tional force in life (Kernberg, 2005). Freud originally used 
the term object to mean a person or thing that allows the 
drive to achieve its aim. Drives are of two types: libidinal and 
aggressive. Accordingly, objects became a key component of 
Freud’s drive/structural model of the human psyche. In con-
trast to Freud’s views, however, many theorists have moved 
toward a relational/structural model of the psyche in which 
an object is the target of relational needs in human develop-
ment. Although there are many different object relations the-
orists, most agree that humans have an innate drive to form 
and maintain relationships, and that this is the fundamental 
human need that forms a context against which other drives, 
such as libidinal and aggressive, gain meaning.
The object relations paradigm emerged and has been 
consolidated within psychoanalytic thought over the past 
70 years (Borden, 2000). Theorists such as W. R. D. Fair-
bairn, Melanie Klein, Harry Stack Sullivan, Donald Win-
nicut, and Heinz Kohut are forerunners in this perspective. 
They stress that humans have basic needs for connec-
tion, contact, and meaningful interpersonal relationships 
throughout life. According to this view, infants have a very 
limited sense of self. The self is formed in relationship with 
the primary objects, especially the mother. Margaret Mahler 
(Mahler & Furer, 1968; Mahler, Pine, & Bergman, 1975) 
described the self as taking shape in three stages over the 
first two years of life. At first, the infant simply enjoys the 
isolated events of the caregiving relationship. In this context, 
drives are satisfi ed and a sense of frustration is followed by 
a sense of satisfaction when needs are met. In the second 
phase, infants enjoy engaging in more rhythmic interactions 
with the mother, initiating interactions that are not necessar-
ily focused around meeting basic needs. In the fi nal stage, a 
process of separation and individuation occurs that contin-
ues throughout infancy and into adolescence and adult life.

CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
functions to a more executive, integrated analysis of ego. 
Ego psychology has become a study of the development and 
differentiation of the ego as integrative, adaptive, and goal 
directed. Jane Loevinger (1976) offered a nine-stage theory 
of ego development, with adolescence characterized as a 
time of conformity to the group, and self-conscious aware-
ness of the reactions of others. In her theory the ego is at 
once an intricate composite of multiple capacities, including 
planning, assessing, defending, coping, and mediating, and 
the integration of these with other aspects of self-concept, 
self-esteem, moral judgment, and personal identity, which 
gives the person substance, individuality, and location in the 
social world.
Implications for Human Development
Psychosexual theory emphasizes the importance of the 
tension between interpersonal demands and intrapsychic 
demands in shaping personality. The ego develops skills for 
dealing with the realities of the interpersonal world. It also 
develops skills for satisfying personal needs and for impos-
ing personal standards and aspirations about the way these 
needs are satisfi ed. The expectations of others—particularly 
parents—are internalized and given personal meaning in the 
formation of the superego. By developing this idea, Freud 
was able to show how a child translates the demands of the 
interpersonal world into a personal way of functioning. At 
the same time, new demands and experiences continue to 
play a role in the development of personality. Freud focused 
on the effects of sexual impulses on personal and interper-
sonal life throughout adulthood.
One of the major early contributions of psychosexual 
theory was the identifi cation of the infl uence of childhood 
experiences on adult behavior. Freud argued that the basic 
dynamics of personality are established by the age of 6 or 
7. Psychosexual theory was unique in its focus on stages 
of development, family interactions, and unresolved fam-
ily conflicts as explanations for ongoing adult behavior. 
The emphasis Freud gave to the importance of parenting 
practices and their implications for psychosexual develop-
ment has provided one of the few theoretical frameworks 
for examining parent-child relationships. Many of the early 
empirical studies in developmental psychology focused on 
issues that derived from Freud’s theory, such as childrearing 
and discipline practices, moral development, and childhood 
aggression.
The psychosexual approach recognizes the importance of 
motives, emotions, and fantasies that guide behavior. Within 
this framework, human behavior springs at least as much 
from emotional needs as from reason. The psychosexual 
theory suggests that unconscious motives and wishes explain 
behaviors that otherwise might not make sense. Many 
domains of mental activity—including fantasies, dreams, 
primary process thoughts and symbols, and defense mecha-
nisms—infl uence how individuals make meaning from their 
in dirt and disorder, exhibitionistic tendencies, brutality, cru-
elty to animals, and enjoyment of various forms of vulgarity. 
In her clinical cases, Anna Freud observed that previously 
successful defense mechanisms threatened to fall to pieces as 
intense sexual impulses emerged. During this period, the ego 
may employ very rigid defenses in order to deny the instinc-
tual drives.  Adolescents may vacillate in their behavior from 
loving to mean, compliant to rebellious, or self-centered to 
altruistic, as the ego tries to assert itself in the midst of con-
fl icting and newly energized libidinal forces.
Peter Blos expanded the concept of ego and the mecha-
nisms of defense by identifying the coping mechanisms that 
emerge in adolescence as young people fi nd ways of adapt-
ing psychologically to the physical transitions of puberty. 
By the end of adolescence, those ego confl icts present at the 
beginning of puberty are transformed into more manageable 
aspects of identity construction and expression. Blos noted 
fi ve major accomplishments of ego development for young 
people who navigate adolescence successfully:
 1. Judgment, interests, intellect, and other ego functions 
emerge that are specifi c to the individual and very stable.
 2. The confl ict-free area of the ego expands, allowing ado-
lescents to fi nd satisfaction in new relationships and 
experiences.
 3. An irreversible sexual identity is formed.
 4. The egocentrism of the child is replaced by a balance be-
tween thoughts about oneself and thoughts about others.
 5. A wall separating one’s public and private selves is 
established.
In Ego Psychology and the Problem of Adaptation (1939), 
Heinz Hartmann suggested that not all aspects of the ego’s 
functioning arise out of confl ict between id and superego. 
He introduced the concept of the confl ict-free sphere of the 
ego, including basic adaptive functions such as perception, 
recognition of objects, problem solving, motor development, 
and language. Hartmann thought that the concepts of ego, 
id, and superego were more accurately viewed as three inter-
related components of mental functioning that could expand 
or contract under the infl uence of one another. He offered a 
developmental picture of the ego beginning with early dif-
ferentiation and distinction between id and ego, a process of 
growing clarity between self and the external reality, a shift 
from early self-love to investment in others, and to the even-
tual achievement of adaptive, reality-based thinking.
Building on Hartmann’s work, Edith Jacobson (1964) 
described how the self is shaped through identifi cation with 
others and achieves new levels of autonomy in adolescence 
through the incorporation of moral codes and ethical values. 
According to Jacobson, the superego is not always a threat 
to the ego. It can become a stimulus for new levels of ego 
development when anxiety or guilt signals a need for a new 
standard of moral behavior.
In their extension of the concept of ego, Rubin and 
Gertrude Blanck (1986) moved from a view of many ego 

 
Cognitive Developmental Theories | 35
Psychosexual theory suggests that basic issues of per-
sonal development are in place by adolescence. The results 
of this development are then played out for the remainder 
of adult life in a person’s defensive style, fi xations, typical 
sexual behavior and sexual fantasies, and the strategies for 
sublimating sexual and aggressive impulses. In contrast, the 
psychosocial approach assumes that development goes on 
throughout life. The skills resulting from accomplishing new 
developmental tasks are learned, and new social abilities are 
achieved. The radius of significant relationships expands, 
bringing new expectations and new sources of social sup-
port. As new confl icts arise, they stimulate new growth, and 
new ego qualities emerge as a result of successfully coping 
with each new challenge. For a list of the key concepts of 
psychosexual theory, see Table 2.2.

Objective 2c. To review the basic concepts of cognitive 
developmental theories and their implications for the 
study of human development.
Cognition is the process of organizing and making mean-
ing of experience. In psychosexual theory, this function 
was assigned to the ego. Interpreting a statement, solving 
a problem, synthesizing information, critically analyzing a 
complex task—all of these are cognitive activities. Cognitive 
developmental theory focuses specifi cally on how knowing 
emerges and is transformed into logical, systematic capacities 
for reasoning and problem solving. Perhaps the most widely 
experiences. Through the construct of the unconscious, 
Freud provided a means for explaining thoughts and behav-
iors that appear irrational, self-destructive, or contradictory. 
The idea that development involves efforts to fi nd acceptable 
outlets for strong, often socially unacceptable impulses still 
guides therapeutic interventions with children, adolescents, 
and adults.
Another critical contribution is Freud’s recognition of the 
role of sexual impulses during childhood. Freud believed 
that a sexual relationship with a loving partner is impor-
tant for healthy adult functioning. Sexual impulses have a 
direct outlet in behavior during adult life. However, Freud 
argued that children also have needs for sexual stimulation 
and satisfaction, but have no acceptable means to satisfy 
those needs. Today, we are more aware of a child’s need for 
hugging, snuggling, and physical warmth with loving care-
givers, but most adults still fi nd it diffi cult to acknowledge 
that young children have sexual impulses. Childhood wishes 
and needs, bottled up in the unconscious, guide behavior 
indirectly through symbolic expression, dreams, or, in some 
cases, the symptoms of mental disorders. We need only look 
at a daily newspaper to recognize that the acceptance and 
expression of sexual impulses continue to be points of con-
fl ict in modern society. Controversies over sexual dysfunc-
tion, sexual abuse, rape by strangers and acquaintances, 
sexual harassment in the workplace, sexually transmitted 
diseases, contraception, abortion, infi delity, and homopho-
bia reveal the diffi culties that Americans have in dealing with 
the expression of sexual impulses.
Links to the Psychosocial Approach
Both psychosexual theory and psychosocial theory are 
stage theories that address basic, qualitative changes in self-
understanding and social orientation. Erikson, having been 
trained in psychoanalysis under Anna Freud and mentored 
by Sigmund Freud and other members of the Analytic Insti-
tute, readily acknowledged his intellectual ties to Freud’s 
psychosexual theory. Psychosexual theory deals with con-
fl icts that the child experiences in satisfying basic needs and 
impulses, especially sexual and aggressive impulses, within 
socially acceptable boundaries. The psychosocial approach 
expands this view by considering the broad range of social 
demands and social expectations that confront children at 
each point in development as well as the wide variety of 
competencies and social resources that children have for 
meeting those demands.
Both the psychosocial approach and psychosexual theory 
describe characteristics and functions of the ego system. How-
ever, the psychosocial approach goes beyond childhood and 
adolescence, suggesting the direction for ego development in 
early, middle, and later adulthood. The psychosocial approach 
gives a greater role to the individual in guiding and shaping the 
direction of development through the use of coping strategies 
that redefi ne confl icts and identify new resources.

interact. One part of adaptation is assimilation—the ten-
dency to interpret new experiences in terms of an existing 
scheme. Assimilation contributes to the continuity of know-
ing. The second part of adaptation is accommodation—the 
tendency to modify familiar schemes in order to account 
for new dimensions of the object or event that are revealed 
through experience. Assimilation is a conservative process 
that operates to preserve existing structures by incorporating 
new information and confi rming that what is already known 
is useful in making sense of new experiences. Accommoda-
tion is a progressive process that operates to alter existing 
structures in light of new information, thereby creating the 
basis for future assimilation (van Geert, 1998).
Piaget hypothesized that cognitive development occurs 
in four stages, each of which is characterized by a unique 
capacity for organizing and interpreting information. At each 
new stage, competencies of the earlier stages are not lost but 
are integrated into a qualitatively new approach to think-
ing and knowing. The essential features of these stages are 
introduced here. They will be discussed in greater detail in 
subsequent chapters. In general, Piaget’s theory describes 
the path in the development of cognition from direct action 
on objects in infancy to mental actions (operations) and the 
relationships among mental operations in adolescence.
The fi rst stage, sensorimotor intelligence, begins at birth 
and lasts until approximately 18 months of age. This stage is 
characterized by the formation of increasingly complex sen-
sory and motor schemes that allow infants to organize and 
exercise some control over their environment.
The second stage, preoperational thought, begins when 
the child learns a language and ends at about age 5 or 6. 
known and infl uential of the modern cognitive theorists is 
Jean Piaget. His concepts provide the initial focus of this sec-
tion. Recent interest in the social framework within which 
cognition develops has been stimulated by the work of L. S. 
Vygotsky. Several of his important contributions, introduced 
toward the end of this section, complement and expand the 
developmental perspective on how cognition emerges and 
changes over the life course.
Basic Concepts in Piaget’s Theory
According to Piaget, every organism strives to achieve equi-
librium. Equilibrium is a balance of organized structures, 
whether motor, sensory, or cognitive. When structures are in 
equilibrium, they provide effective ways of interacting with 
the environment. Whenever changes in the organism or in 
the environment require a revision of the basic structures, 
they are thrown into disequilibrium (Piaget, 1978/1985). 
Piaget focused on how equilibrium is achieved with the envi-
ronment through the formation of schemes (the structure or 
organization of action in thought) and operations (the men-
tal manipulation of schemes and concepts) that form sys-
tematic, logical structures for comprehending and analyzing 
experience, and on how equilibrium is achieved within the 
schemes and operations themselves.
Equilibrium is achieved through adaptation—a process 
of gradually modifying existing schemes and operations in 
order to take into account changes or discrepancies between 
what is known and what is being experienced (see Figure 2.2). 
Adaptation is a two-part process in which the continuity 
of existing schemes and the possibility of altering schemes

and are able to step back from the situation and see it more 
fl exibly.
Implications for Human Development
Piaget’s theory has had an enormous influence on our 
understanding of cognition and the way we think about 
the reasoning capacities of infants and young children. Six 
implications of the theory for the study of child develop-
ment are discussed here. First, the theory suggests that cog-
nition has its base in the biological capacities of the human 
infant—that knowledge is derived from action. For example, 
infants learn about the features of objects by grasping and 
sucking on them. Knowledge is constructed rather than pas-
sively absorbed. Children as well as adults select, explore, 
and experiment with objects and later with ideas. They cre-
ate their knowledge through this active engagement.
As the knower changes, so does what is known. For 
example, an infant may know a ball through its touch, how 
it feels in the hand or mouth, through its appearance, and 
through its response to the infant’s actions. A toddler may 
become aware of the functions of a ball by kicking, throwing, 
rolling, and bouncing it. At later ages, children understand 
more about the physical properties of a ball and can link it 
to other shapes and categories of objects. With each more 
advanced level of motor, symbolic, and interpersonal capac-
ity, the knower creates a new meaning of objects, people, and 
the interactions among them. Because of natural interest and 
through exposure to a wide range of materials, stimuli, and 
experiences, infants and young children “teach themselves” 
a great deal of what they know. This perspective has been 
integrated into instructional strategies in which children 
are encouraged to construct meaning through direct experi-
ence. Through free exploration, which typically requires the 
coordination of perspectives and the manipulation of inter-
connected elements, an understanding of the integration of 
coordinated factors is naturally acquired (Kamii et al., 2001; 
Kamii, Rummelsburg, & Kari, 2005).
Second, discrepancies between existing schemes and 
contemporary experiences promote cognitive development. 
Encounters with all types of novelty—especially experiences 
that are moderately distinct rather than widely different 
from what is already known—are important for advancing 
new ideas and new ways of organizing thought. Extending 
this idea, encounters with differences in opinion through 
discussion and reading are just as important in adolescence 
and adulthood as encounters with different types of sensory 
materials in infancy and toddlerhood.
Third, infants have the capacity for thinking and problem 
solving. Although infants do not make use of symbolic strat-
egies, they are able to establish certain logical connections 
between means and ends that guide their problem-solving 
efforts.
Fourth, infants, toddlers, and school-age children think in 
different ways, and the ways they think are different from the 
ways adults think. This does not mean that their thinking is 
During this stage, children develop the tools for representing 
schemes symbolically through language, imitation, imagery, 
symbolic play, and symbolic drawing. Their knowledge is 
still very much tied to their own perceptions.
The third stage, concrete operational thought, begins 
about age 6 or 7 and ends in early adolescence, around age 
11 or 12. During this stage, children begin to appreciate the 
logical necessity of certain causal relationships. They can 
manipulate categories, classifi cation systems, and hierarchies 
in groups. They are more successful at solving problems that 
are clearly tied to physical reality than at generating hypoth-
eses about purely philosophical or abstract concepts.
The fi nal stage of cognitive development, formal opera-
tional thought, begins in adolescence and persists through 
adulthood. This level of thinking permits a person to con-
ceptualize about many simultaneously interacting variables. 
It allows for the creation of a system of laws or rules that 
can be used for problem solving. Formal operational thought 
refl ects the quality of intelligence on which science and phi-
losophy are built.
At the start of each new stage, the child experiences a type 
of egocentrism or limitation in point of view. With experi-
ence, children gain new objectivity about their perspective

exploration. This infant is discovering the properties of the string

CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
cultural symbol systems to which they are exposed, and how 
those systems shape thinking and behavior.
Higher mental processes, particularly language and mean-
ing, emerge from the child’s ongoing interactions within 
social, historical, and cultural contexts, as well as from the 
child’s biological maturation. The child and the culture are 
intricately interwoven through the process of social interac-
tion. New levels of understanding begin at an interpersonal 
level as two individuals, initially an infant and an adult, 
coordinate their interactions. Eventually interpersonal col-
laboration becomes internalized to make up the child’s inter-
nal mental framework. Through continuous interaction with 
others, especially adults and older children, a child revises 
and advances levels of understanding. Over time, it is the 
mastery of these cultural tools or symbol systems that per-
mits individuals to alter their environments and guide, regu-
late, and redefi ne themselves.
Four key concepts in Vygotsky’s theory are introduced 
here: (1) culture as a mediator of cognitive structuring, 
(2) movement from the intermental to the intramental, (3) inner 
speech, and (4) the zone of proximal development.
Culture as a Mediator of Cognitive 
Structuring
Vygotsky argued that cognitive development can be under-
stood only in the context of culture. Of the many elements 
of culture that shape cognition, one that was of special inter-
est to Vygotsky was the idea of tools and signs as human 
inventions that shape thought. Technical tools such as 
plows, cars, weapons, and signs—sometimes referred to 
as psychological tools—like symbolic systems, counting sys-
tems, and strategies for remembering, modify the person’s 
relationship to the environment. Through the use of tools, 
humans change the way they organize and think about the 
world. Vygotsky viewed tools as a means through which 
the human mind is shaped and modifi ed over the course of 
history.
Movement from Intermental to Intramental
Perhaps contrary to common sense, Vygotsky argued that 
high-level mental functions begin in external activity that 
is gradually reconstructed and internalized. He gave the 
example of pointing. Vygotsky claimed that initially, an infant 
will reach toward an object that is out of reach, stretching 
the hand in the direction of the object and making grasp-
ing motions with the fi ngers. This is a movement directed to 
the object. As soon as the caregiver recognizes that the child 
wants the object and is able to satisfy the child’s request, the 
child begins to modify the reaching and grasping motion 
into a socially meaningful gesture—pointing. The caregiver’s 
understanding of the gesture and the intermental coordina-
tion between caregiver and infant result in an intramental 
process for the infant—an understanding of the special rela-
tionship between the desired goal, the caregiver as mediator, 
and pointing as a meaningful sign.
unorganized or illogical, but the same principles of logic that 
typically govern adult thought do not govern the thinking of 
young children.
Fifth, beginning with the period of concrete operations, 
children can approach problems using many of the princi-
ples that are fundamental to scientifi c reasoning. They can 
also begin to reason about their reasoning—introducing the 
importance of metacognition, or the many strategies used 
to guide the way we organize and prepare ourselves to think 
more clearly and effectively.
Sixth, thinking about the social world is regulated by 
many of the same principles as thinking about objects in the 
physical world. As we learn about the principles that govern 
objects and physical relationships, we are also learning about 
ourselves and others.
Vygotsky’s Concepts of Cognitive 
Development
Piaget’s focus on cognitive development emphasized a pro-
cess in which children investigate, explore, discover, and 
rediscover meaning in their world. Although Piaget acknowl-
edged the significance of social factors, especially parents 
and peers, in the cognitive process, his theory focused on 
what he believed to be universal processes and stages in the 
maturation of cognition from infancy through adolescence. 
In contrast, Vygotsky, often referred to as an interactionist, 
argued that development can be understood only within 
a social-historical framework. At the heart of his work is a 
focus on thinking, especially in childhood, which he links to 
the development of language and speech.
The development of the child’s thinking depends on his 
mastery of the social means of thinking, that is, on mastery 
of speech…. This thesis stems from our comparison of the 
development of inner speech and verbal thinking in man 
with the development of speech and intellect as it occurs 
in the animal world and the earliest stages of childhood. 
This comparison demonstrates that the former does not 
represent a simple continuation of the latter. The very type 
of development changes. It changes from a biological form 
of development to a socio-historical form of development. 
(Vygotsky, 1987, p. 120)
Vygotsky, like many other theorists and philosophers of 
his time, was trying to account for the development of higher 
mental processes from their simpler forms. He saw develop-
ment as following a continuous path from other animals to 
humans, and also a discontinuous path. This was captured in 
his view of natural or lower mental processes, which could 
be observed in animal behavior and in the problem-solving 
behaviors of infants and very young children, and higher 
mental processes, which arise as children encounter and 
master the cultural tools of their society. He viewed human 
beings across cultures as both similar to the extent that they 
shared basic physical characteristics and natural psychologi-
cal processes, and substantially different depending upon the

The Zone of Proximal Development
Taking the idea of internalization further, Vygotsky offered 
the concept of the zone of proximal development to explain 
how learning and development converge. The zone of proxi-
mal development is “the distance between the actual devel-
opmental level as determined by independent problem 
solving and the level of potential development as determined 
through problem solving under adult guidance or in collabo-
ration with more capable peers” (Vygotsky, 1978b, p. 86).
We have all experienced situations in which we were able 
to solve a task only with the assistance and advice of some-
one else. The typical efforts of parents to help a child put 
together a jigsaw puzzle by suggesting strategies, like select-
ing all the straight-edged pieces first to make the border, 
or sorting the many pieces into those with a similar color, 
are examples of how learning takes place within the zone. 
Vygotsky suggested that the level of competence a person 
can reach when taking advantage of the guidance of others 
refl ects the functions that are in the process of maturation, 
as contrasted to those that have already matured. Learning 
within the zone of proximal development sets into motion 
the reorganization and internalization of existing develop-
mental competencies, which then become synthesized at a 
new, higher intramental level.
Implications for Human Development
Vygotsky’s theory suggests that the boundaries between the 
individual and the environment are much less clear than 
one might infer from most other theories of human develop-
ment. In fact, Vygotsky directs attention to the guiding role 
of social interaction and culture in shaping and orienting 
cognition, thus bringing the study of cognitive development 
Inner Speech
Vygotsky (1978) argued that speech plays a central role in 
self-regulation, self-directed goal attainment, and practical 
problem solving. He described the problem-solving behav-
iors of toddlers as involving both speech and action. Tod-
dlers use what was described by Piaget (1952) as egocentric 
speech to accompany their behavior. They talk out loud, 
but do not seem to be concerned about whether anyone can 
hear them or understand them. He described the talk as ego-
centric because it did not seem to have any social intention. 
Piaget suggested that the development of communication 
began with inner thinking of a very private, nonsocialized 
nature. In toddlerhood, he viewed egocentric speech as evi-
dence of the relative absence of social life and the great extent 
of nonsocialized thoughts that the child is unable to express.
Vygotsky (1987) proposed a completely different devel-
opmental pathway to account for egocentric speech and its 
function. He represented the scheme as: social speech—ego-
centric speech—inner speech. Vygotsky viewed speech as 
beginning in the social interactions between children and 
adults or other children. The fi rst and foremost function of 
speech is social. Egocentric speech is a transformation of this 
social speech inward. The child uses speech that was initially 
acquired through interactions with others to guide personal 
behaviors. It does not have a social intention; rather, it is a 
tool that helps to guide problem solving. Vygotsky viewed 
egocentric speech and actions as part of the same problem-
solving function. The more diffi cult the problem, the more 
speech is necessary for the child to fi nd a solution. “Children 
solve practical tasks with the help of their speech, as well 
as their eyes and hands” (Vygotsky, 1978a, p. 26). Eventu-
ally, the egocentric speech of an audible nature dwindles (but 
does not disappear entirely) and becomes inner speech.
Vygotsky’s theory emphasizes the 
social context of cognitive devel-
opment. Children often learn by 
interacting with older siblings 
who can answer their questions 
and show them how to solve 
problems.

CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
schemes that are constructed with the same logic that the 
person applies to the understanding of objects. In the psy-
chosocial approach, cognitive development is referred to as 
ego development—an understanding of how the self emerges 
and shapes a personal identity with goals, values, beliefs, and 
strategies for achieving goals within the constraints of the 
society. Ego development involves planning, making deci-
sions, coping with challenges, and facing the future with a 
sense of purpose.
Vygotsky’s theory provides an important link from Pia-
get’s emphasis on the maturation of logical reasoning to the 
emphasis of the psychosocial approach on the maturation 
of self in society by emphasizing the interpersonal nature 
of cognition. The idea of a zone of proximal development 
relates closely to the idea of an expanding network of social 
relationships, capturing the unique interpersonal and cul-
tural context of all aspects of knowing, whether it is knowing 
about the logic of the physical world or about the logic of 
relationships. Vygotsky’s theory shares with the psychosocial 
approach a strong emphasis on the role of culture in guid-
ing social and cognitive development. The two theories view 
development as an ongoing interaction of the person and the 
cultural context. One might think of Vygotsky’s notion of 
movement from the intermental to the intramental as a fore-
runner of the psychosocial concept of identity—a gradual 
internalization and integration of the roles and social expec-
tations of others into a meaningful sense of one’s role in soci-
ety. For a list of the key concepts of cognitive developmental 
theory, see Table 2.3.
into much greater harmony with the concepts of psychoso-
cial theory than are seen in Piaget’s theory.
Several specifi c implications of Vygotsky’s work can be 
inferred (Davydov, 1995). First, the mental structures and 
functioning of people raised in a specific culture will be 
different from those of people raised in other cultures. In 
comparison to Piaget, who viewed the emergence of logical 
thought as largely a universal process, Vygotsky considered 
the nature of reasoning and problem solving as culturally 
created. Because of the way in which intermental experiences 
and networks structure intramental events, one’s family and 
others who infl uence and control the child’s early learning 
and problem-solving experiences will have a strong infl uence 
on the structure of one’s thinking.
Second, Vygotsky highlighted the role of language as a 
cultural tool that links each new generation of children with 
the history and cultural meaning of their ancestors. Lan-
guage, especially the spoken word, is a bridge between the 
interpersonal environment and the child’s private thoughts.
Third, the concept of a zone of proximal development 
links development and learning. It assumes a critical role 
for adults in the child’s environment who can identify where 
a child is with regard to any particular skill area and can 
then introduce questions, suggestions, tasks, and strategies 
to help move them to a new level of competence. Vygotsky 
believed in the interconnection of the learning and teaching 
processes, arguing that children could never discover all that 
is known in a culture’s knowledge base just through explora-
tion and experimentation. They need the guidance of more 
skillful peers and adults.
Finally, an implication of Vygotsky’s work is that indi-
viduals can promote their own cognitive development by 
seeking interactions with others who can help draw them 
to higher levels of functioning within their zone of proximal 
development.
Links to the Psychosocial Approach
Piaget’s cognitive developmental theory and the psychosocial 
approach focus on development as a product of discrepan-
cies, referred to as disequilibrium in cognitive developmen-
tal theory and as psychosocial crises in psychosocial theory. 
Piaget’s theory, like the psychosocial approach, proposes a set 
of stages of development, with each stage growing from and 
integrating the achievements of earlier stages. Piaget’s theory 
did not offer any hypotheses about the qualitative changes 
that might follow the period of formal operational reasoning, 
whereas the psychosocial approach makes clear predictions 
about the direction of ego development in early, middle, and 
later adulthood.
Piaget focused on the cognitive domain—especially on 
the process of knowledge acquisition and logical reasoning. 
The meaning a person makes of a situation depends largely 
on the stage of mental development attained. Feelings, social 
relationships, and self-understanding are viewed as cognitive

Theories of Learning | 41
Bandura (1977) pointed out the distinction between 
learning and performance. A learner might understand fea-
tures of a task or demands in a situation that are not evident 
in the learner’s behavior. Social learning theory assumes that 
a great deal of learning goes on through observation, but that 
much of it is not observed in behavior unless the reinforce-
ment conditions are conducive.
Recent directions in social learning theory have taken 
an increasingly cognitive orientation, sometimes referred 
to as social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1989, 1991, 
2001). Through observational learning, the child becomes 
acquainted with the general concepts of the situation as well 
as with the specifi c behaviors. Direct reinforcement or non-
reinforcement provides one type of information about how 
to behave in a certain situation. Moreover, people watch 
others, learn about the consequences of their actions, and 
remember what others have told or shown them and what 
they have read or learned about the situation. Over time, 
one forms a symbolic representation for the situation, the 
required behaviors, and the expected outcomes. A worker 
may learn that with one type of supervisor, it is appropriate 
Theories of Learning
Objective 2d. To review the basic concepts of learning 
theories and their implications for the study of human 
development.
Human abilities are diverse, fl exible, and can be coordinated or 
integrated to achieve many different goals. An understanding of 
the processes of learning and teaching requires concepts that are 
not linked to specifi c goals, but can be applied broadly across 
many problem areas (Premack, 2010). For example, observa-
tional learning is a common mode through which humans can 
learn a vast array of behaviors, such as eating with a fork, swing-
ing a bat, speaking in a polite tone of voice, or sharing toys 
with friends. Learning theorists have proposed mechanisms 
to account for the relatively permanent changes in behavior 
that occur as a result of experience. Underlying human beings’ 
extensive capacity to adapt to changes in their environments is 
their fl exible ability to learn. Two theories of learning that have 
made signifi cant contributions to the study of human develop-
ment are social learning, and cognitive behaviorism.
Social Learning Theory
The concept of social learning evolved from the awareness 
that much learning takes place as a result of observation and 
imitation of other people’s behavior (Bandura & Walters, 
1963). Changes in behavior can occur without being linked to 
a specifi c pattern of positive or negative reinforcement. They 
can also occur without numerous opportunities for trial-and-
error practice. A person can watch someone perform a task or 
say a new expression and imitate that behavior accurately on 
the fi rst try. The person being observed is called the model; 
the process of imitating a model is called modeling.
Early research in social learning theory was devoted to iden-
tifying conditions that determine whether a child will imitate a 
model (Bandura, 1971, 1977, 1986). Children have been found 
to imitate aggressive, altruistic, helping, and stingy models. They 
are most likely to imitate models who appear to be powerful and 
prestigious, in other words, models who control resources or 
who are themselves rewarded. Bandura and Walters (1963) sug-
gested that children not only observe the behaviors carried out by 
a model, but they also watch what happens to the model. When 
the model’s behavior is rewarded, the behavior is more likely to 
be imitated; when the model’s behavior is punished, the behav-
ior is more likely to be avoided. This process is called vicarious 
reinforcement. When naughty behaviors go unpunished, they 
too are likely to be imitated. Through observational learning, 
a child can learn a behavior and also acquire the motivation to 
perform that behavior or to resist performing that behavior 
depending on what is learned about the consequences linked to 
that behavior. Thus, observational learning can hold the key to 
self-regulation and to the internalization of standards for resist-
ing certain behaviors as well as for enacting behaviors (Grusec, 
1992).
Social learning theory emphasizes the role of observation and 
imitation as means of learning new behaviors. Can you think of a 
new response that you recently learned through imitation?

CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
expectancies and beliefs; affects (feelings and emotional 
responses); goals and values; competencies; and self-regu-
latory plans (see Figure 2.3). Encodings refer to constructs 
the person has about the self, the situation, and others in the 
situation. Expectancies refer to cognitive assessments about 
one’s ability to perform, ideas about the consequences of one’s 
behavior, and the meaning of events in one’s environment.
Affects are the feelings and emotional reactions or physi-
ological responses that are associated with a situation. Feel-
ings of anger, fear, arousal, excitement, or jealousy might 
interact with expectancies and encodings to guide behavior. 
Goals and values are related to the relative importance one 
places on the outcomes of situations. One person may value 
high levels of task performance, whereas another may value 
success in social situations. One’s behavior in a situation is 
infl uenced by how one values its possible outcomes. Cognitive 
competencies consist of knowledge, skills, and abilities.
Self-regulatory plans are strategies for achieving one’s 
goals, including techniques for managing internal emotional 
states, creating a plan, and putting the plan into action. In 
comparison to the notion of classical or operant condition-
ing, self-regulation focuses on how one leaves the realm of 
stimulus control in order to gain control over behavior. Self-
regulation is especially important in situations where temp-
tations, frustrations, or self-doubt threaten to pull one away 
from important goals (Mischel & Ayduk, 2002). As people 
become increasingly aware of the effects of stimuli on their 
behavior, they can learn to overcome, channel, or eliminate 
those influences that tempt them to abandon their goals. 
The box on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy illustrates how the 
principles of cognitive behaviorism have been incorporated 
to ask lots of questions and offer suggestions for ways of 
solving problems, whereas with another supervisor, it is bet-
ter to remain quiet and try not to be noticed. The rules for 
behavior in each setting are abstracted from what has been 
observed in watching others, what happened following one’s 
own behavior in the past, and what one understands about 
the demands in the immediate situation. Through social 
learning, individuals develop an understanding of the social 
consequences of behavior, leading to new patterns of behav-
ioral expression and self-regulation. The culmination of this 
learning process is what Bandura (2001) referred to as effi -
cacy, including planning intentional actions, guiding and 
directing one’s own behaviors toward a goal, and refl ecting 
on one’s actions to assess their quality, impact, and purpose.
Implications for Human Development
The principles of social learning theory are assumed to operate 
in the same way throughout life. The concept of social learn-
ing highlights the relevance of models’ behavior in guiding 
the behavior of others. These models may be parents, older 
siblings, peers, entertainment stars, or sports heroes. Because 
new models may be encountered at any life stage, new learning 
through the process of observational learning is always possi-
ble. Exposure to a certain array of models and a certain pat-
tern of rewards or punishments results in the encouragement to 
imitate some behaviors and to inhibit the performance of oth-
ers. The similarity in behavior among people of the same age 
refl ects their exposure to a common history of models, rewards, 
and punishments. Recognition of the potential impact one has 
as a model for others—especially in the role of parent, teacher, 
clinician, counselor, or supervisor—ought to impart a certain 
level of self-conscious monitoring about the behaviors one 
exhibits and the strategies one employs in the presence of those 
who are likely to perceive one as a model for new learning.
Cognitive Behaviorism
Cognitive behaviorists study the many internal mental activi-
ties that influence behavior. Edward Tolman (1932/1967, 
1948) introduced the notion of a cognitive map—an inter-
nal mental representation of the learning environment. 
According to Tolman, individuals who perform a specific 
task in a certain environment attend primarily to that task, 
but they also form a representation of the rest of the setting. 
The cognitive map includes expectations about the reward 
system in operation, the existing spatial relationships, and 
the behaviors accorded the highest priority. An individu-
al’s performance in a situation represents only part of the 
learning that has occurred. The fact that people respond to 
changes in the environment indicates that a complex mental 
map actually develops in this situation.
According to Walter Mischel (1973, 1979; Mischel & 
Shoda, 1995), six types of cognitive and affective factors medi-
ate a person’s behavior in a situation and account for conti-
nuity in how people respond across situations: encodings;

brings to the task. Differences in expectancies, self-
control strategies, values, emotional reactions, and goals all 
infl uence the way individuals approach a learning situation 
and the behaviors they are likely to exhibit in the situation.
Cognitive behaviorism suggests that in order to under-
stand why people behave as they do in a specifi c situation, 
one needs to understand the meaning that is constructed 
of the situation, including the integration of expectations, 
goals, and values and their links to cognitive and behavioral 
competences and self-regulatory plans. Although informa-
tion or skills can be learned, they will not be expressed in 
behavior unless expectations about the self and the environ-
ment justify their enactment.
into a therapeutic approach to help clients alter unwanted or 
distressing thoughts, affect, and behavior.
Implications for Human Development
Cognitive behaviorism suggests that the learner acquires 
an outlook on the learning situation that infl uences subse-
quent learning and performance. This outlook infl uences 
the learner’s feeling of familiarity with the task, motiva-
tion to undertake the task, optimism about performing 
the task successfully, and strategies for approaching the 
task. In addition to everything a parent, teacher, or super-
visor might do to structure a learning environment, one 
must always take into account the outlook that the learner 
Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy
BUILDING ON THE TRADITIONS 
of cognitive developmental theory, 
cognitive behaviorism, and attribution 
theory, cognitive behavioral therapy is a 
general term that applies to a variety of 
therapies that share certain similarities. 
The central idea is that stimuli or 
situations produce thoughts that create 
certain affects (emotions). The affects 
are produced by the thoughts we have 
about the stimulus, not by the stimulus 
itself (Leahy, 2006). Since people differ 
in the way they categorize and evaluate 
a stimulus, the same situation might 
create feelings of discouragement and 
depression in some people, and feelings 
of determination in others. For example, 
one person might react to a bad grade 
on a test as evidence that she is not 
smart enough to do well; another 
person might react to the same grade 
as evidence that he needs to study 
harder.
Aaron Beck (1976/1979), the founder 
of cognitive therapy, began his work in 
the treatment of depression. He found 
that patients suffering from depression 
spoke consistently of themes of loss, 
incompetence, and failure. They viewed 
themselves as failures; they perceived 
their efforts to alter their situation as 
useless, and their expectancies of the 
future as bleak. Beck began to focus his 
therapeutic effort on guiding patients to 
examine their emotional reactions and 
automatic assumptions.
The goal of cognitive behavioral 
therapy is to teach clients ways 
of unlearning unwanted, negative 
encodings by examining their thoughts 
in light of new information or alternative 
interpretations, and then replacing 
those thoughts with new, more adaptive 
encodings (NACBT.org, 2007). The 
therapy takes an inductive approach, 
encouraging clients to consider their 
thoughts as hypotheses that can be 
questioned or tested and then changed 
in order to be more appropriately 
adapted to reality. The therapist focuses 
on teaching the client rational, self-
counseling skills that can be practiced 
through weekly homework, and applied 
to daily situations outside of the therapy 
session. The therapy also teaches clients 
to examine their problems with a degree 
of calm detachment. If a person is upset 
about a problem, then the person 
actually has two problems, the troubling 
situation and the distress associated 
with their reaction to it. Finding ways to 
reduce the distress allows the person to 
examine the problem using higher-order 
cognitive skills rather than affect-driven 
stress reduction responses.
Cognitive behavioral therapy has 
been shown to be effective in the 
treatment of depression, panic disorder, 
bulimia (an eating disorder), and post-
traumatic stress disorder (Baker, McFall, 
& Shoham, 2009). A number of clinical 
studies have shown that cognitive 
behavioral therapy is more long-lasting 
as a treatment for these disorders 
than treatment using medication. In 
other words, once the treatment has 
ended, patients who have had cognitive 
behavioral therapy are substantially 
less likely to relapse than those who 
were treated with medication. The 
implication is that for these conditions, 
a therapeutic process can result in a 
relatively permanent change in thought, 
affect, and specifi c behaviors designed 
to help the client achieve goals.

APPLYING THEORY AND RESEARCH TO LIFE

44 | 
CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
Culture has been described as a worldview—a way of 
making meaning of the relationships, situations, and objects 
encountered in daily life. Basic ideas, such as whether people 
are considered to be in control of nature or a part of nature, 
who is included in the defi nition of family, what characteristics 
are considered signs of mental health or mental illness, which 
acts are construed as hostile or nurturing, which aspects of 
the environment are considered dangerous or safe—all these 
and many other mental constructions are shaped by culture 
(Kagitcibasi, 1990). Culture guides development, not only 
through encounters with certain objects, roles, and settings, 
but also through the meanings linked to actions.
Weisner and Lowe (2004) clarify this process using the 
term cultural pathways. According to this view, adults in 
each culture have values and goals for themselves and for 
their children that shape and organize the socialization pro-
cess and activities of daily life. “Activities are made up of 
values and goals; resources needed to make the activity hap-
pen; people in relationships; the tasks the activity is there to 
accomplish; emotions and feelings of those engaged in the 
activity; and a script defi ning the appropriate, normative way 
we expect to do that activity” (Weisner & Lowe, 2004, p. 6).
The idea that engaging in the specifi c routines and activi-
ties of daily life shaped developmental pathways was cap-
tured early in the fi eld of cultural anthropology through the 
work of Ruth Benedict. She introduced the principle of cul-
tural determinism (Benedict, 1934/1950), which suggests 
that the individual’s psychological experiences are shaped 
by the expectations, resources, and challenges posed by 
one’s specifi c cultural group. Similar to the learning theories, 
cultural determinism suggests that individuals’ behaviors 
are shaped through enculturation, in which culture carri-
ers such as parents, teachers, religious leaders, and elders, 
teach, model, reward, punish, and use other symbolic strate-
gies to transmit critical practices and values. Two theoretical 
constructs that allow one to compare cultures are presented 
here: continuity and discontinuity, and individualism and 
collectivism.
Continuity and Discontinuity
The extent to which development is viewed as distinct stages 
of life depends on the degree to which socialization within 
a culture is characterized by continuity or discontinuity. 
Continuity is found when a child is given information and 
responsibilities that apply directly to that child’s future adult 
behavior. For example, Margaret Mead (1928/1950) observed 
that in Samoan society, girls of 6 or 7 years of age commonly 
took care of their younger siblings. As they grew older, their 
involvement in the caregiving role increased; however, the 
behaviors that were expected of them were not substantially 
changed. When there is continuity, development is a grad-
ual, fl uid transformation, in which adult competencies are 
built directly on childhood accomplishments. Discontinuity 
is found when a child is either barred from activities that are 
open only to adults or is forced to “unlearn” information or 
Links to the Psychosocial Approach
The learning theories and the psychosocial approach operate 
at different levels of abstraction. The psychosocial approach 
assumes that growth and change continue throughout the 
life span; however, it does not account for the exact pro-
cesses by which new behaviors, new coping strategies, or 
new ego strengths are acquired. The learning theories pro-
vide explanations for the ways in which the patterns of daily 
events shape the direction of adaptation and growth. They 
offer insight into the processes through which society’s rules, 
norms, and customs become internalized and translated into 
habits, preferences, and expectations, which become gen-
eralized across common situations. The learning theories 
emphasize the signifi cance of the immediate environment in 
directing the course of growth and also help to explain why 
habits or patterns of behavior may be difficult to change, 
even when they appear to be dysfunctional. The key terms 
introduced by social learning theory and cognitive behavior-
ism are listed in Table 2.4.
Cultural Theory
Objective 2e. To review the basic concepts of cultural 
theory and its implications for the study of human 
development.
The concept of culture, although defined in a variety of 
ways by anthropologists, political scientists, sociologists, and 
psychologists, refers here to the learned systems of mean-
ings and patterns of behaviors that are shared by a group 
of people and transmitted from one generation to the next. 
Physical culture encompasses the objects, technologies, 
structures, tools, and other artifacts of a culture. Social 
culture consists of norms, roles, beliefs, values, rites, and 
customs (Herkovits, 1948; Triandis et al., 1980; Rohner, 
1984; Betancourt & Lopez, 1993; Triandis, 1994).

differently, infl uenced in part by the collectivist or individu-
alistic orientation of the culture. For example, both native 
Chinese and Western adults process information about char-
acteristics of the self in the same area of the prefrontal cor-
tex. However, Chinese adults also process information about 
characteristics of their mothers in this same area of the brain, 
an area that in Western adults is involved only in thinking 
about the self. The implication is that for Chinese adults, a 
strong cultural tie between self and others is supported by a 
neural pathway for thinking about self and signifi cant oth-
ers (Ambady & Bharucha, 2009; Zhu, Zhang, Fan, & Han, 
2007).
Cultures have been differentiated as relatively more col-
lectivist or individualist. Across cultures, people have to 
achieve some of the same basic developmental tasks. But the 
degree to which the culture is collectivistic or individualistic 
will infl uence what the people in a culture think is the ideal 
state and what is necessary to achieve that state. All cultures 
have some expectations for the formation of social relation-
ships and social bonds, but the pathways that are empha-
sized as high quality or most desirable are different. In an 
individualistic developmental pathway, social obligations are 
constructed through agreements among the individual par-
ticipants in the relationship. Opportunities to decide whom 
you want to have relationships with and how to behave 
within those relationships are maximized. As a result, there 
is considerable variability in the nature and quality of inter-
personal relationships. In the collectivistic or interdependent 
developmental pathway, social obligations and responsibili-
ties are more important, and more clearly defi ned. There is 
greater consistency in the scripts for specifi c relationships, 
behaviors that are accepted in children but considered inap-
propriate for adults. The change from expectations of virgin-
ity before marriage to expectations of sexual responsiveness 
after marriage is an example of discontinuity. Cultures that 
have discrete, age-graded expectations for people at different 
periods of life produce a pattern of development in which 
age groups have distinct characteristics and appear to func-
tion at different skill levels. These societies are likely to be 
marked by public ceremonies, graduations, and other rites 
of passage from one stage to the next.
Individualism and Collectivism
The dimensions of individualism and collectivism provide 
another lens for comparing cultures (Triandis, 1990, 1995, 
1998). Individualism refers to a worldview in which social 
behavior is guided largely by personal goals, ambitions, and 
pleasures, which may or may not coincide with the inter-
ests of the group. Independence and personal achievement 
are valued. When conflicts arise between group and per-
sonal goals, it is considered acceptable and perhaps expected 
that personal goals will come fi rst. Collectivism refers to a 
worldview in which social behavior is guided largely by goals 
that are shared by a collective, such as a family, tribe, work 
group, or political or religious association. Interdependence 
and group solidarity are valued. The in-group creates norms, 
goals, and beliefs that are enculturated and endorsed by its 
members. When conflicts arise between group goals and 
personal goals, a person is expected to act in the best interest 
of the group.
There is growing evidence to suggest that people from 
different cultures process social information somewhat

CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
adulthood, adolescence may be brief and relatively free of 
psychological stress.
The study of development must be approached with an 
appreciation for the cultural context. Cultural expectations 
about the timing for entry into and completion of certain life 
tasks, such as schooling, work, marriage, childbearing, and 
political and religious leadership, infl uence the tempo and 
tone of one’s life history. Cultures also vary in the personal 
qualities they admire and those they consider inappropriate 
or shameful. A society’s standards of beauty, leadership, and 
talent determine how easily an individual can achieve status 
within it.
Cultures not only differ from one another, but some soci-
eties are more culturally diverse than others. The process of 
globalization includes “the rapid spread of materials and 
products, ideas, images, capital flows, and people across 
spaces and borders (national or otherwise) that formerly 
were far more diffi cult if not impossible to connect” (Weisner 
& Lowe, 2004, p. 6). With increased global travel, migra-
tion, global communication systems, and opportunities to 
study or work in other cultures, most contemporary societies 
are becoming more culturally diverse than in the past. This 
means that there may be tensions between dominant and 
minority cultures as well as confl icts among ethnic groups. 
Some of the benefi ts of increased access to goods and tech-
nologies that are a by-product of globalization may be coun-
terbalanced by the disintegration of social ties and the loss of 
meaningful group identity.
Links to the Psychosocial Approach
The psychosocial approach is based on the assumption 
that culture contributes fundamentally to individual devel-
opment. Basic cultural values regarding generosity, self-
control, independence, or cooperation can be interpreted 
from infant caregiving practices. Just as evolutionary the-
ory asserts that adaptation is a product of the interaction 
between the organism and the physical environment, psy-
chosocial theory assumes that individual development is 
a product of continuous interaction between the develop-
ing person and the demands and resources of the cultural 
environment.
The concept of developmental pathways suggests that all 
cultures have to address certain developmental tasks, such 
as the establishment of interpersonal relationships, but the 
way these pathways are structured, the activities that are 
included along the path, and the ideals or goals that adults 
strive to achieve differ across cultures. According to the 
psychosocial approach, all cultures must be able to adapt 
to changes in economic, environmental, and intercultural 
conditions in order to survive. Individual development is 
interwoven with the ability of the society to adapt and con-
tinue. For a list of the key concepts of cultural theory, see 
Table 2.6.
and greater agreement about the importance of preserving 
those relationships, even when those obligations require 
personal sacrifi ce (Greenfi eld, Keller, Fuligni, & Maynard, 
2003). For example, arranged marriages are more common 
in collectivistic cultures, whereas marriages based on roman-
tic love and personal choice are more common in individu-
alistic cultures.
Typically, societies marked by greater complexity, affl u-
ence, social mobility, and cultural diversity tend to be more 
individualistic in their worldview (Greenfi eld, 2009). Fac-
tors including greater exposure to education, increased 
access to technology, and increased globalization tend to 
move cultures away from the collectivistic and toward the 
individualistic pathways. People within cultures can also be 
described as adhering to more individualist or collectivist 
values. Thus, not everyone in a collectivist culture equally 
endorses the collectivist worldview. Subgroups within a soci-
ety may differ in how much their values refl ect the dominant 
individualist or collectivist orientation of the larger society. 
The Human Development and Diversity box provides a dis-
cussion of the implications of individualism and collectivism 
for parenting.
Implications for Human Development
Culture interacts with biological development in determin-
ing whether development is perceived as stage-like and how 
each period of life is experienced. This concept is illustrated 
by the ways in which different cultures mark an adolescent 
girl’s fi rst menstruation (Mead, 1949/1955). In some socie-
ties, people fear menstruation and treat the girl as if she 
were dangerous to others. In other societies, she is viewed 
as having powerful magic that will affect her own future and 
that of the tribe so she is treated with new reverence. In still 
others, the perceived shamefulness of sex requires that the 
menstruation be kept as secret as possible. The culture thus 
determines how a biological change is marked by others and 
how it is experienced by the person.
Societies vary in the extent to which they expect people to 
make signifi cant life decisions during each life period and in 
the range of choices they make available. The United States 
is a highly individualistic culture. American adolescents are 
expected to make decisions regarding sex, work, politics, 
religion, marriage, and education. In each of these areas, the 
alternatives are complex and varied. As a result, adolescence 
is prolonged, and the risk of leaving this period without hav-
ing found a solution to these problems is great. People who 
emigrate to the United States from more collectivistic cul-
tures or who are members of more collectivistic subcultures 
may experience even more stress during this period as their 
values for family and group allegiances and their scripts for 
behavior come into confl ict with the individualistic orien-
tation of the larger cultural context. In cultures that offer 
fewer choices and provide a clearer path from childhood to 

 
Cultural Theory | 47
THE CONSTRUCTS OF individualism 
and collectivism refer to two differ-
ent value systems that characterize 
a culture. Individualism encourages 
and celebrates individual accom-
plishments and self-expression; col-
lectivism encourages and celebrates 
interdependence and the strength of 
the community. Every society requires 
some blend or balance between these 
two perspectives. In order to survive, 
a group must be able to support both 
the I and the We, the individual per-
son and the group. However, as one 
interacts with people from different 
cultural backgrounds, it is helpful to 
be aware of the dominant orientation 
toward either individualism or col-
lectivism in order to achieve greater 
insight into the person’s likely mo-
tivations, goals, and sense of moral 
obligation. Table 2.5 summarizes the 
features of these two orientations 
(Trumbull, Rothstein-Fisch, & Green-
fi eld, 2000).
These contrasting values have 
implications for the behaviors that 
parents value and the way they inter-
act with their children. Individualist 
cultures encourage more independent 
play. They foster a child’s autonomy 
and self-expression by allowing 
greater physical distance between the 
child and the caregiver, asking for the 
child’s opinions, and allowing children 
to have a voice in decision making. 
Children are praised for doing things 
on their own and moving toward self-
reliance. In both subtle and specifi c 
ways, children in individualist cultures 
are encouraged to compete with each 
other and to feel pride in their indi-
vidual achievements.
Children in collectivist cultures 
are kept closer to their parents or 
caregivers during infancy. They are 
more likely to be nurtured through 
longer periods of breastfeeding, 
to be carried or held closely during 
infancy, and to be socialized through 
gentle encouragement and indul-
gences well into childhood. Families 
in collectivist cultures usually include 
extended kinship groups that all play 
an active role in a child’s comfort, 
socialization, and care. Children are 
taught to be respectful of their elders 
and to show deference for adults’ 
opinions and decisions. A strong value 
for sharing and cooperation leads to 
encouragement for children to share 
their belongings and to learn from 
one another. Children are praised for 
behaviors that evidence responsibility 
for others, a sense of duty, and com-
mitment to the family (Greenfi eld & 
Suzuki, 1998).

CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
the intensity of role involvement, or how deeply the person 
identifi es with the role; the amount of time the role demands; 
and the extent to which the expectations associated with 
each role are either highly structured or fl exible and open to 
improvisation. These features help account for experiences 
of role strain and role overload as various periods of life 
when the demands and intensity of multiple roles converge 
(see the box on Role Strain and Parenthood).
Implications for Human Development
All cultures offer new roles that await individuals as they 
move from one stage of life to another. Some of these roles 
may be directly associated with age, such as the role of a 
high school student. Other roles may be accessible only to 
those of a certain age who demonstrate other relevant skills, 
traits, or personal preferences. In many elementary schools, 
for example, the fi fth-grade students become eligible to serve 
in the role of crossing guard to help the younger children 
get across the streets near the school. Families, organizations, 
and the larger community have implicit theories of develop-
ment that determine what role positions open up for individ-
uals in each age group. Some of the most important life roles 
persist across several stages, including child, parent, and sib-
ling. The expectations for role performance remain the same 
in some respects, but change in others. We can begin to see 
how social roles provide consistency to life experiences and 
how they prompt new learning.
Involvement in personal relationships and social groups 
contributes to the formation of one’s social identity—that 
aspect of the self-concept that is based on membership in 
a group or groups and on the importance and emotional 
salience of that membership (Tajfel, 1981). Some of these 
role relationships are personal—based on family, friend-
ship, or intimate relationships. Others are political, reli-
gious, or ethnic. Some aspects of one’s social identity may 
be associated with a stigmatized group, such as being home-
less, unemployed, or on welfare (Deaux, Reid, Mizrahi, & 
Ethier, 1995). In modern societies, people are members of 
many groups and form complex social identities, in which 
many roles and their varying meanings and values are bal-
anced and synthesized. Understanding a person’s social iden-
tity helps account for which groups a person may view as 
ingroups and outgroups, why a person might discriminate 
against certain outgroups, or how a person’s views of fairness 
and justice may be shaped (Simon & Klandermans, 2001).
The idea that one’s social identity is crafted from experi-
ences in a variety of roles is illustrated in the following narra-
tive of Azhar, an 18-year-old male.
Basically I feel that there are three main facets of what I feel 
are priorities in my life. What shape my decisions. One be-

Social Role Theory
Objective 2f. To review the basic concepts of social 
role theory and its implications for the study of human 
development.
Another approach to thinking about the effect of the envi-
ronment on development has been suggested by social psy-
chologists such as Orville Brim (1966) and sociologists such 
as Talcott Parsons (Parsons & Bales, 1955). They traced 
the process of socialization and personality development 
through the person’s participation in increasingly diverse and 
complex social roles. A social role is any set of behaviors 
that has a socially agreed-upon function and an accepted 
code of norms (Brown, 1965; Biddle & Thomas, 1966; 
Biddle, 1979). The term role was taken from the context of 
the theater. In a play, actors’ behaviors are distinct and pre-
dictable because each actor has a part to play and follows 
a script. You will recall this metaphor from Shakespeare’s 
analysis in As You Like It, “All the world’s a stage, / and all the 
men and women merely players. / They have their exits and 
their entrances, / and one man in his time plays many parts” 
(Act 2, scene 7).
Role theory applies this same framework to social life 
(Biddle, 1986). The three elements of concern to role the-
ory are the patterned characteristics of social behavior (role 
enactment), the parts or identities a person assumes (social 
roles), and the scripts or shared expectations for behav-
ior that are linked to each part (role expectations). Social 
roles serve as a bridge between the individual and the soci-
ety. Every society has a range of roles, and individuals learn 
about the expectations associated with them. As people enter 
new roles, they modify their behavior to conform to these 
role expectations. Each role is usually linked to one or more 
related or reciprocal roles. The student and the teacher, the 
parent and the child, and the salesperson and the customer 
are reciprocal roles. Each role is partly defi ned by the other 
roles that support it. The function of the role is determined 
by its relation to the surrounding role groups to which it is 
allied.
Four dimensions are used to analyze the impact of social 
roles on development: the number of roles a person occupies;

Role Strain and 
Parenthood
A RECURRING THEME in the literature 
on parenthood is the experience of role 
strain. Role strain is defi ned as a sense 
of diffi culty in meeting perceived role 
expectations or balancing competing 
role demands (Biddle, 1986). Each 
of the following dimensions of social 
roles may contribute to parental role 
strain: role intensity, time required, the 
structure or fl exibility of the role, and 
the number and characteristics of other 
roles. Because the parent role has great 
intensity, the sense of involvement in all 
the behaviors associated with the role 
intensifi es, and so does anxiety about 
failure to meet the expectations of the 
role. First-time parents especially may 
have little confi dence in their ability to 
fulfi ll their roles, and the level of worry 
associated with the role rises accordingly.
The parent role takes a lot of time. 
Most fi rst-time parents underestimate 
how much time infants and toddlers 
require. When new parents, especially 
mothers, refl ect on the time they spend in 
a variety of social roles, they point to the 
parent role as more time consuming than 
any other role, now or in the past.
Role strain linked with parenting is 
related to the structure of the role. Some 
adults have very clear ideas about how 
they should enact their parent role, but 
many are unsure. Partners are likely to 
differ in their views on childrearing tech-
niques. These differences require time 
to resolve. Because of the hardships or 
distress they recall from their own child-
hoods, many adults do not want to raise 
their children the way they were raised 
themselves. They have to learn a new 
script for this role.
When parenting is added to other 
adult roles, especially those of worker and 
spouse, the demands of the new paren-
tal role may seem overwhelming. Most 
parents are also enacting a worker role. 
Workplace conditions that allow demands 
of the work role to spill over into family 
life can be a cause of work-family confl ict 
and role strain. With corporate downsiz-
ing, many workers fi nd that they have 
much more to do, more functions to fi ll, 
and increased pressure to do work after 
hours or at home. The need to make a 
long commute to work, expectations to 
bring work home, and expectations to be 
available for telephone or online interac-
tions from home are all examples of work 
demands that can increase parental role 
strain (Voydanoff, 2005).
There are at least fi ve ways to mini-
mize role strain associated with the parent 
role (Cowan & Cowan, 1988; Newman, 
2000; Allen, 2001; Bornstein, 2002):
 1. Parents need to focus on a small 
number of expectations for their 
parenting role and focus on fi nding 
pleasure in meeting those expectations 
rather than worrying about the many 
expectations that are not being met.
 2. The ability to delegate role 
responsibilities can reduce role 
strain. Parents who can hire others 
to help with some of the parenting 
responsibilities or who can turn to 
family members or friends for help 
will experience less role strain than 
those who are solely responsible for 
the parenting role. Couples who can 
fl exibly alter and share household 
responsibilities in response to the 
demands of parenting will experience 
more satisfaction and less strain.
 3. The ability to integrate several 
aspects of the role in one activity 
can reduce role strain. Some parents 
become quite inventive about ways 
to maintain contact with their infant 
while carrying out household chores 
and other work and also preserving 
time with each other.
 4. Role strain is reduced when partners 
reach consensus about their parent 
roles. New parents who have re-
solved their differences regarding 
childrearing philosophy, child care 
activities, and the division of house-
hold responsibilities experience less
role strain and a higher level of marital 
satisfaction than those who continue 
to have opposing views on these 
issues.
 5. Either fi nd a work environment that 
has supportive attitudes and policies 
regarding work-family coordination, 
or take steps to change the existing 
work culture to be more fl exible and 
positive toward workers who must 
meet concurrent family roles and 
responsibilities (Allen, 2001).
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. How could you tell if parents are 
experiencing role strain? What kinds 
of behaviors would you be likely to 
observe? What types of emotional 
states might you observe?
 2. How might parental role strain 
infl uence one’s relationships with 
other family members? How might 
it infl uence one’s performance as a 
worker?
 3. What factors might make it diffi cult 
for partners to reach consensus 
about childrearing in order to reduce 
role strain?
 4. How might characteristics of the child 
or children in the family contribute to 
parental role strain? What are some 
of these characteristics?
 5. What are some demands of the work 
role that might produce work-family 
confl ict and parental role strain? 
What are some characteristics of 
the workplace that might reduce 
parental role strain?

CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
Social role theory helps clarify why this is so important, 
because children and adults occupy many reciprocal roles.
In the following chapters, we describe a number of life 
roles especially related to family, school, and work. As the 
number of roles increases, individuals must learn some of 
the skills of role playing, role differentiation, and role inte-
gration. The developmental crisis of individual identity ver-
sus identity confusion emphasizes the challenge of being 
able to integrate several diverse roles in order to preserve a 
sense of personal continuity. With each new role, one’s self-
definition changes and one’s potential for influencing the 
world increases. For a list of the key concepts of social role 
theory, see Table 2.7.
Systems Theory
Objective 2g. To review the basic concepts of systems 
theory and its implications for the study of human 
development.
Systems theories attempt to describe and account for the 
characteristics of systems and the relationships among the 
component parts found within the system (Sameroff, 1982). 
Systems theories take the position that the whole is more 
than the sum of its parts. Any system—whether it is a cell, 
an organ, an individual, a family, or a corporation—is com-
posed of interdependent elements that share some common 
goals, interrelated functions, boundaries, and an identity. 
The system cannot be wholly understood by identifying each 
of its component parts. The processes and relationships of 
those parts make for a larger, coherent entity. The language 
system, for example, is more than the capacity to make vocal 
utterances, use grammar, and acquire vocabulary. It is the 
coordination of these elements in a useful way in a context of 
shared meaning. Similarly, a family system is more than the 
sum of the characteristics and competencies of the individual 
family members.
A system cannot violate the laws that govern the function-
ing of its parts, but at the same time it cannot be explained 
solely by those laws. Biological functioning cannot violate 
the laws of physics and chemistry, but the laws of physics 
This narrative illustrates how youth forge a social identity 
from their early and ongoing family socialization, contempo-
rary interests and preferences, and community expectations 
and resources.
Links to the Psychosocial Approach
Role relationships provide a central mechanism through 
which the socialization process takes place. In the psycho-
social approach, one might think of the radius of signifi cant 
relationships as an interconnected web of reciprocal roles 
and role relationships through which the expectations and 
demands of society make themselves known. The idea of 
reciprocity in roles is closely linked to the concept of inter-
dependence of people at different psychosocial stages. The 
capacity of adults to cope with the challenges of their life 
stages and to achieve new ego strengths is intricately linked 
to the ability of children and youth to flourish and grow. 
The social role of healer can be found in most cultures. Although 
the costumes and techniques may differ, healers typically have 
access to knowledge not shared by most of the people in the 
society. What are some of the role expectations associated with 
healers in our society?

Systems Theory | 51
From the systems perspective, the components and the 
whole are always in tension. What one understands and 
observes depends on where one stands in this complex set 
of interrelationships. All living entities are both parts and 
wholes. A person is a part of a family, a classroom or work 
group, a friendship group, and a society. A person is also a 
whole—a coordinated, complex system composed of physi-
cal, cognitive, emotional, social, and self subsystems. Part of 
the story of human development is told in an analysis of the 
adaptive regulation and organization of those subsystems. 
Simultaneously, the story is told in the way larger systems 
fl uctuate and impinge on individuals, forcing adaptive regu-
lation and reorganization as a means of achieving stability at 
higher levels of system organization.
In an effort to elaborate and clarify the interlocking sys-
tem of systems in which human behavior takes place, Urie 
Bronfenbrenner (1979, 1995, 1999) offered the following 
topography of the environmental structure (see Figure 2.4).
A microsystem is a pattern of activities, roles, and 
interpersonal relations experienced by the developing per-
son in a given setting with particular physical and material 
characteristics.
A mesosystem comprises the interrelations among two or 
more settings in which the developing person actively par-
ticipates (e.g., for a child, the relations among home, school, 
and neighborhood peer group; for an adult, among family, 
work, and social life).
An exosystem refers to one or more settings that do not 
involve the developing person as an active participant, but 
in which events occur that affect—or are affected by—what 
happens in the setting containing the developing person.
The macrosystem refers to consistencies in the form and 
content of lower-order systems (micro-, meso-, and exo-) 
that exist, or could exist, at the level of the subculture or the 
culture as a whole, along with any belief systems or ideolo-
gies underlying such consistencies (Bronfenbrenner, 1979, 
pp. 22, 25, 26).
and chemistry cannot fully explain biological functioning. 
Similarly, children’s capacities for cognitive growth can-
not violate the laws of biological functioning, but biological 
growth does not fully explain the quality of thought.
Individuals, families, communities, schools, and socie-
ties are all examples of open systems. Ludwig von Bertalanffy 
(1950, 1968) defi ned open systems as structures that main-
tain their organization even though their parts constantly 
change. Just as the water in a river is constantly changing 
but the river itself retains its boundaries and course, so the 
molecules of human cells are constantly changing while the 
various biological systems retain their coordinated functions.
Systems change in the direction of adjusting to or incor-
porating more and more of the environment into themselves, 
in order to prevent disorganization as a result of environmen-
tal fl uctuations (Sameroff, 1982). Adaptation—whether the 
concept is articulated by Darwin, Piaget, or Bandura—seems 
to be a fundamental process. Ervin Laszlo (1972) described 
this property of an open system as adaptive self-regulation. 
A system uses feedback mechanisms to identify and respond 
to environmental changes. The more information about the 
environment the system is capable of detecting, the more 
complex these feedback mechanisms must be. When the 
oxygen level of the environment is reduced, for example, 
you tend to grow sleepy. While you sleep, your breathing 
slows, and you use less oxygen. Some of these adjustments 
are managed unconsciously by the organization of biological 
systems. Others are managed more deliberately by efforts to 
minimize the effects of environmental changes. Most systems 
have a capacity for storing or saving resources so that tempo-
rary shortages do not disrupt their operations.
When open systems are confronted by new or chang-
ing environmental conditions, they have the capacity for 
adaptive self-organization. The system retains its essential 
identity by creating new substructures, revising the relation-
ships among components, or creating new, higher levels of 
organization that coordinate existing substructures.
The neighborhood is a microsystem. Children adapt their play to the physical characteristics of their neighborhoods. How might 
adaptive regulation differ for children who grow up in these two communities?

CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
settings as well as the interrelationships among systems 
have a unique pattern of organization and refl ect an under-
lying set of beliefs and values that differ from one culture or 
ethnic group to the next. These cultural characteristics are 
transmitted to the developing person.
Implications for Human Development
Systems theory has been applied to the study of the life span 
through developmental systems theory (Lerner, Dowling, 
& Roth, 2003). This perspective emphasizes the ongoing 
interaction and integration across many levels of the human 
organism from the genetic to the behavioral level, within the 
nested contexts of the person, family, community, and culture, 
to consider both continuity and change over individual and 
historical time. Plasticity, the capacity for change, is at the 
heart of this approach. The person in the setting is the focus 
of analysis. The challenge to developmental systems theory 
is to understand the reciprocal regulation of the person and 
the environment over time. How is the person shaped and 
defi ned by the contexts in which the person functions? How 
does the person infl uence these contexts to foster more opti-
mal environments for growth (Bronfenbrenner, 2004)? In the 
framework of systems theory, the boundary between the per-
son and the environment is fuzzy; as an open system, a per-
son is continuously infl uenced by information and resources 
The chronosystem refers to time (Bronfenbrenner, 1995). 
Both the individual and the systems in which that person is 
embedded change over time. What is more, the relationships 
among the systems change over time. Some of these changes 
are patterned, developmental transformations, such as the 
change in a child’s capacity for coordinated movement and 
voluntary, goal-directed action. Other changes are societal, 
such as a community decision to restructure a school sys-
tem from an elementary (Grades K–6), junior high (Grades 
7–9), and high school (Grades 10–12) system to an elemen-
tary (Grades K–5), middle school (Grades 6–8), and high 
school (Grades 9–12) system. Finally, some changes refl ect 
the decline or improvement of resources in a setting, as 
when a neighborhood becomes transformed through urban 
development.
Bronfenbrenner argued that development is infl uenced 
directly by the interactions that take place within a single 
microsystem, such as the family, and by the similarities and 
differences in patterns of interaction that occur across the 
various systems in which the person functions (the meso-
system). Events in adjoining systems, such as decisions 
in the workplace that affect the parents’ work schedule or 
decisions in city government that affect resources for the 
local schools, also have an impact on development even 
though the child does not participate directly in these set-
tings. Furthermore, the roles, norms, and resources within

of a family system. From a systems theory perspective, the 
assumption is that the person’s problems are a product of the 
interactions among family members. The only way to bring 
about changes in that person’s functioning is to alter the 
functioning of the other members of the system as well. If the 
person is underfunctioning—that is, acting irresponsibly, not 
communicating, not performing at a level of capability, with-
drawing, or acting impulsively—one assumes that others in 
the family are overfunctioning—that is, assuming many of 
the person’s roles and responsibilities in order to take up the 
slack. The dysfunctional behavior is maintained because it is 
a component of an emotional unit. In other words, the dys-
function belongs neither to the person nor to the other fam-
ily members but to the particular interdependence among 
the family members that operates to preserve the viability of 
the family system as a whole (Bowen, 1978).
Family systems are also interdependent with adjacent sys-
tems. Thus, the understanding of families requires an anal-
ysis of the resources and demands of other social systems 
that impinge on families and of the opportunities that fami-
lies have for infl uencing adjoining systems. A woman who 
is experiencing an extremely demanding, stressful, and sex-
ist work environment, for example, may be constantly tired, 
tense, and irritable in her behavior toward her family mem-
bers. She may bring home the resentments from work in 
the way she treats and expects to be treated by the men and 
women in her family. If the job is important to her and her 
family, no one may be willing to acknowledge the disruptive 
impact that the work setting is having on family life. Family 
violence, the effects of unemployment on families, participa-
tion of mothers in the labor force, child care, and the role of 
parents in their children’s schooling are all being examined 
from a systems perspective.
Links to the Psychosocial Approach
The psychosocial approach is quite compatible with the 
basic assumption of systems theory—that an understanding 
of development requires an analysis of the person embedded 
in a number of interrelated systems. Systems theory predicts 
that systems change through adaptive self-regulation and 
adaptive self-organization. The direction of this change is not 
necessarily patterned, except that it is expected to move in 
the direction of creating new, higher levels of organization 
to coordinate newly developed substructures. The nature 
of change is a product of efforts to retain a sense of system 
identity and boundaries in the face of multiple demands and 
shifts in environments. According to psychosocial theory, 
however, change is patterned. At each new stage of life, a 
person is propelled into increasingly complex social systems 
and encounters new stimulation for growth through par-
ticipation in a greater variety of social relationships. As they 
mature, individuals develop new coping skills and devise 
strategies for new levels of participation in the social system. 
Eventually, they create innovative approaches for modifying 
the social system itself.
from the environment and, at the same time, creates or modi-
fi es the environment to preserve system functioning.
Systems theory has also been applied to the analysis of 
family functioning. Family systems theories focus on how 
families establish and maintain stable patterns of function-
ing. Families are viewed as emotional units identifiable 
by certain boundaries and rules (Broderick, 1993). The 
boundaries of the family determine who is considered to 
be a family member and who is an outsider. They infl uence 
the way information, support, and validation of the family 
unit are sought and the way new members are admitted into 
the family. Some families have very strict rules that main-
tain a narrow boundary around the family. Few sources of 
information or contact are admitted. Other families extend 
the sense of belonging to a wide range of people who bring 
ideas and resources to the family system.
Family systems are maintained by patterns of communi-
cation (Vogl-Bauer, 2003). Positive and negative feedback 
loops operate to stabilize, diminish, or increase certain types 
of interactions. For example, a feedback loop is positive 
when a child offers a suggestion and a parent recognizes and 
compliments the child on that suggestion. As a result, the 
child is encouraged to continue to offer suggestions, and the 
parent comes to view the child as someone who has valuable 
suggestions to offer. A feedback loop is negative if a parent 
ignores the child’s suggestions or scolds the child for making 
them. The child is less likely to make further suggestions, 
and the parents’ view of the child as someone who has no 
valuable ideas to offer is confi rmed. Many positive and nega-
tive feedback loops operate in families to sustain the qualities 
of the system, such as the power hierarchy, level of confl ict, 
and balance between autonomy and dependence among the 
members.
One of the most commonly noted characteristics of fam-
ily systems is the interdependence of the family members. 
Changes in one family member are accompanied by changes 
in the others. Imagine for a moment that family members 
are standing in a circle and holding a rope. Each person is 
trying to exert enough tension on the rope to keep it tight 
and preserve the circular shape. The amount of tension each 
person must exert depends on what every other person is 
doing. Now imagine that one member of the family lets go 
of the rope and steps away. In order to retain the shape and 
tension of the rope, everyone else has to adjust his or her 
grip. Letting go of the rope is an analogy for many kinds of 
changes that can occur in a family—a parent becomes ill, a 
child goes off to college, or a parent takes on a demanding 
job outside of the home. The system adjusts by redefi ning 
relationships, modifying patterns of communication, and 
adjusting its boundaries. The members and their interde-
pendencies change. Similar adjustments must be made if a 
member is added to the family system or when the system 
undergoes some other major transition.
The family systems perspective offers a distinct approach 
to clinical problems. A person who has been identifi ed as 
dysfunctional is treated not as a lone individual but as part

CHAPTER 2 Major Theories for Understanding Human Development
Marilyn, our dear daughter, may she have a long and won-
derful life, this dear child of ours who is no longer a child, de-
cided last month to cure me. Cure me of what, I do not know. I 
did not ask. One day she came in. A day no different from any 
other. I was sitting in the living room watching the television 
news.
Marilyn went into the kitchen to empty her grocery bags. 
“Dad,” she said. “I bought you new coffee. It’s decaffeinated.” 
“What does this mean, decaffeinated?” I asked. This I said from 
my chair, why should I walk into the kitchen? “Unleaded, Dad. 
You shouldn’t be drinking regular coffee. It’s a diuretic.”
By this time she was standing in the doorway of the 
kitchen, folding her paper bag. “It means it takes too much 
water out of you. You’re too old for that.”
New? Decaffeinated. Diuretic. Too much water. Let her do 
what she wants. What did I care?
I forgot about it. The next day, I got up, I fed the birds, read 
the newspaper, and drank my coffee. No big deal. But that 
afternoon, a headache. And what a headache, loud, pound-
ing, I could not think. This was not so new to me. Headaches. 
They come, they go. But this one, it was different. The next 
day, it was still with me. And the next day also. Like a black 
cloud, it fi lled my head with thunder, everywhere I went.
When Marilyn came on the third day, I remembered. 
“Marilyn,” I said, “this decaffeinated coffee, however you 
call it, it is killing me.”
“Ha, ha,” she laughed. “It’s not killing you, Dad. It’s good 
for you.”
“It’s murdering me. Go, buy me some coffee. Or tomorrow 
you will be pouring this decaffeinated coffee on my grave.”
“Dad,” she said. “You have a headache? You’ll get over it. 
It’s not the decaf that’s giving it to you. It’s from no caffeine. 
It’ll stop soon.” She laughed again, and then she was gone. 
This is what she does. Comes into my house, checks things 
off her list, and then disappears.
I sat down. “Okay.” I said to the fl oor. “I will buy my own 
coffee.”

CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
Consider what each of the theories discussed in this chapter 
might have to offer in helping to understand this interaction 
between an aging, widowed father and his adult daughter.
EVOLUTIONARY THEORY
 1. How can evolutionary theory account for Marilyn’s motiva-
tion to care for her aging father? What aspect of fi tness 
is enhanced when children use their resources to support 
their parents’ longevity and well-being?
 2. How would you describe the interactions among the bio-
logical, psychological, and societal systems in this case?
PSYCHOSEXUAL THEORY
 3. How can psychosexual theory account for Marilyn’s moti-
vation to care for her aging father?
Building on the assumption that development is a prod-
uct of ongoing interactions between the person and society, 
the psychosocial approach suggests that both the diversity 
of microsystems in which one is embedded and the quality 
of one’s connections to those microsystems will influence 
the direction of development. Feelings of belonging, attach-
ment and connection to particular microsystems are associ-
ated with lower levels of anxiety, depression, and antisocial 
behavior. For example, in a study of middle-school-age 
adolescents, those who had a positive connection to home, 
school, and neighborhood had better grades in school than 
those who had low connection to these contexts. Having a 
positive connection to at least one of these microsystems 
served as a protective factor, providing a basis for self-esteem 
and a buffer against depression (Witherspoon, Schotland, 
Way, & Hughes, 2009). The specifi c confi guration of micro-
systems and one’s role or place in those systems contribute 
to the positive or negative direction of development over the 
life span.

JACK MANASKY AND HIS DAUGHTER 
MARILYN
Jack Manasky has been widowed for six years. He still writes 
letters to his beloved wife Anna, keeping her up to date on 
the events of his life. In the following letter, Jack writes of a 
small episode, but a lot is revealed about Jack’s life, his sense 
of self, and his relationship with his adult daughter.
Dear Anna,
I am writing this from a coffee shop. My seat is by the 
window. Why, you are thinking, am I sitting in a coffee shop 
when I have a perfectly good house to sit in? Okay, I will tell 
you.

CULTURAL THEORY
 11. What can you detect from this case about the cultural norms 
for the relationship of an adult daughter and an aging father?
 12. Can you describe a cultural context in which Jack and Mar-
ilyn might have a very different type of relationship and a 
different style of interaction?
 13. How is the U.S. cultural value of independence and indi-
vidualism expressed in the case?
SOCIAL ROLE THEORY
 14. How is Marilyn defi ning her role as an adult child of a wid-
owed father?
 15. How is Jack defi ning his role as Marilyn’s father?
 16. What role does Anna, Jack’s deceased wife, play in Jack’s life?
SYSTEMS THEORY
 17. How would you evaluate the feedback mechanisms between 
Jack and Marilyn and their impact on each other’s behavior?
 18. How might macrosystem values and resources regarding 
health and nutrition be infl uencing Marilyn’s behavior to-
ward her father?
 19. At the end of the case, Jack says, “Okay, I will buy my own 
coffee.” Which concepts presented in this chapter best 
explain a person’s decision to change his behavior in order 
to achieve a new goal?
 4. How can psychosexual theory account for Jack’s coping 
strategy of writing letters to his deceased wife?
 5. If Jack watches television news as part of his daily rou-

 10. What principles of learning theory could help Marilyn be

Objective 1. To defi ne the concept of theory and 
explain how theories contribute to the study of human 
development.
A theory is a logical system of concepts that helps explain obser-
vations and points to underlying processes or relationships that 
are not readily observable. In order to understand a theory, one 
must consider which phenomena the theory is trying to explain, 
the assumptions that underlie the theory, and the theory’s pre-
dictions about causal relationships or systematic associations. A 
theory of human development typically addresses several of the 
following questions: What is the direction of change over the 
life span? What are the mechanisms that account for continuity 
and change? What is the relevance of early experiences for later 
development? How do physical, cognitive, emotional, and social 
functions interact? How do the physical and social environments 
impact development? What factors typically place the person at 
risk for problems in development at various periods of life?
The seven theoretical perspectives reviewed in this chap-
ter each take a distinct approach to explaining continuity 
and change across the life span. Table 2.9 provides an over-
view of the primary emphasis and aspects of development 
highlighted in each of the theories.
Objective 2a. To review the basic concepts of the 
theory of evolution and its implications for the study of 
human development.
Evolutionary theory provides a framework for understand-
ing individual development within the broad perspective of 
the biological evolution of the human species. Although a 
life span of 85 or 90 years may seem long, it is but a fl icker 
in the millions of years of biological adaptation. Evolutionary 
theory highlights the genetically governed aspects of growth 
and development. The environment provides the spe-
cifi c conditions that require adaptation. However, adaptive 
change can occur only if it is supported by the genetically 
based characteristics of the organism. The basic mechanism 
that accounts for species change over many generations is 
natural selection.
Ethology, the study of evolutionarily signifi cant behav-
iors, provides a systematic approach to analyzing reproduc-
tive practices, caregiving behaviors, strategies for obtaining 
resources, and other behaviors that contribute to individual 
and species survival. Evolutionary psychology focuses on 
understanding the human mind in terms of the problems of 
survival it has been shaped to solve.
Objective 2b. To review the basic concepts of psycho-
sexual theory and its implications for the study of human 
development.
According to psychosexual theory, development follows a 
biologically determined path in which patterns of social

between existing schemes and new experiences. Through 
the reciprocal processes of assimilation and accommodation, 
schemes are modifi ed and integrated to form the basis for 
organizing and explaining experience. The child is viewed as 
actively constructing knowledge through sensory, motor, and 
representational exploration.
Vygotsky’s contribution to cognitive theory places the 
development of higher mental processes in a dynamic social 
context. Although thinking and reasoning are dependent on 
biologically based capacities, the way in which mental activ-
ity is organized refl ects unique characteristics of the social 
context, especially as culture is transmitted through lan-
guage, tools, and social relationships.
Objective 2d. To review the basic concepts of learning 
theories and their implications for the study of human 
development.
Learning theories focus on the mechanisms that permit indi-
viduals to respond to their diverse environments and the 
changes in thought and behavior that accompany changes in 
the environment. Behavior can be shaped and modifi ed by 
systematic changes in environmental conditions. According 
to learning theorists, human beings have an especially fl exible 
behavioral system. No assumptions are made about universal 
stages of growth. As conditions in the environment change, 
response patterns also change. Similarity among individu-
als at a particular period of life is explained by the fact that 
they are exposed to similar environmental conditions, pat-
terns of reinforcement, and models. Consistent contingencies 
relationships change as a result of emerging sexual impulses 
and the sexualization of body zones. Culture plays a major 
role in establishing the taboos and acceptable patterns of sex-
ual gratifi cation that lead to confl icts, fi xations, and strategies 
for sublimation. The content of the unconscious—including 
sexual impulses, wishes, and fears—guides behavior and 
gives it meaning. Psychosexual theory emphasizes the years 
of infancy and childhood as those in which basic personal-
ity patterns are established. It also identifi es the family, espe-
cially the parent-child relationship, as the primary context 
within which confl icts related to the socialization of sexual 
impulses are resolved. In contemporary psychoanalytic the-
ory, interpersonal needs and the relational context of ego 
development are highlighted in contrast to the drive-based 
perspective of traditional psychosexual theory.
Objective 2c. To review the basic concepts of cognitive 
developmental theories and their implications for the 
study of human development.
Cognitive developmental theories focus on the etiology of 
rational thought and the capacity for scientific reasoning. 
Piaget’s cognitive theory, like psychosexual theory, views 
development as the product of a biologically guided plan 
for growth and change. The elements that make cognitive 
growth possible are all present in the genetic information 
that governs the growth of the brain and nervous system. 
However, the process of intellectual growth requires interac-
tion with a diverse and responsive environment. Cognitive 
development is fostered by the recognition of discrepancies

integrate their behavior into meaningful units. Meaning is 
provided by the defi nition of the role and by the expecta-
tions of those in reciprocal roles. Development is a product 
of entry into an increasing number of complex roles over the 
life span. As children acquire and lose roles, they change their 
self-defi nitions and their relationships with social groups. 
Most societies defi ne roles that are linked with gender, age, 
marital status, and kinship. These roles provide patterning to 
the life course. However, the patterns are understood to be 
products of the structures and functions of the society rather 
than of genetic information.
Objective 2g. To review the basic concepts of systems 
theory and its implications for the study of human 
development.
Systems theory emphasizes the multidimensional sources of 
infl uence on individuals and the simultaneous infl uence of 
individuals on the systems of which they are a part. Each 
person is at once a component of one or more larger systems, 
and a system unto the self. One must approach the study 
of development from many angles, identifying the critical 
resources, the fl ow of resources, and the transformation of 
resources that underlie an adaptive process of reorganization 
and growth. This perspective has been applied to an analysis 
of families and family change as well as to individual devel-
opment over the life span.
between behaviors and their consequences result in the for-
mation of cognitive expectations as well as behaviors.
Objective 2e. To review the basic concepts of cultural 
theory and its implications for the study of human 
development.
Cultural theory, like the learning theories, emphasizes the role 
of the environment in directing the course of development. 
However, within the cultural theory framework, the focus is 
on the patterns of meaning that are given to biological matu-
ration as well as the activities and routines that shape develop-
mental pathways. Cultural theory recognizes certain constants 
in developmental tasks, but the ideal direction and socializa-
tion processes for guiding development differ widely across 
cultural groups. What one defi nes as the normal or natural 
pattern and tempo of change in competence, roles, and sta-
tus depends largely on the way a society recognizes and treats 
individuals of different ages, sexes, and degrees of kinship.
Objective 2f. To review the basic concepts of social 
role theory and its implications for the study of human 
development.
Social role theory suggests that learning is organized around 
key social functions called roles. As people enact roles, they

Psychosocial theory focuses on the ongoing interaction of the person 
and the social environment. Development is a balancing act between 
positive forces toward growth and negative forces for self-protection 
and withdrawal. Accompanied by the right music, each life holds the 
promise for creative energy and meaningful social connection.

CHAPTER 3 Psychosocial Theory
IN THIS CHAPTER we introduce the basic concepts of 
psychosocial theory that provide the integrating frame-
work for our psychosocial approach to the study of  human 
development. Psychosocial theory presents human devel-
opment as a product of the ongoing interaction between 
The Rationale for Emphasizing 
Psychosocial Theory
Objective 1. To explain the rationale for using 
 psychosocial theory as an organizing framework for 
the study of human development.
We have selected psychosocial theory as an organizing 
framework for the text because of its range and scope. Hav-
ing read Chapter 2, you probably realize that psychosocial 
theory is not the only or most widely accepted theory for 
studying human development. However, it combines three 
features that make it especially useful as we strive to link the 
broad fi eld of human development to applications in health, 
human services, education, and social welfare (Green, 2008):
 1. Psychosocial theory addresses growth across the life 
span, identifying and differentiating central issues from 
infancy through old age. It also suggests that experiences 
of adolescence or adulthood can lead to a review and 
reinterpretation of earlier periods.
 2. Psychosocial theory assumes that individuals have the ca-
pacity to contribute to their own psychological develop-
ment at each stage of life. People have the ability to inte-
grate, organize, and conceptualize their experiences in order 
to protect themselves, cope with challenges, and direct the 
course of their lives. Therefore, the direction of development 
is shaped by self-regulation as well as by the ongoing inter-
action of biological and societal infl uences.
 3. Psychosocial theory takes into consideration the active 
contribution of culture to individual growth. At each life 
stage, cultural goals, aspirations, and social expectations 
and requirements make demands that evoke individual 
reactions. These reactions infl uence which of a person’s 
capabilities will be developed further. This vital link be-
tween the individual and the culture is a key mechanism 
of development. Each society has its own view of the 
qualities that refl ect maturity. These qualities are infused 
into the lives of individuals and help determine the direc-
tion of growth within the society.
The person who identifi ed and developed psychosocial theory 
was Erik H. Erikson. He initially was trained as a psychoanalyst. 
His theory was infl uenced by the work of many others, includ-
ing Sigmund and Anna Freud, Peter Blos, Robert White, Jean 
Piaget, and Robert Havighurst, whose ideas you will encounter 
throughout this book. His wife, Joan, was an important intel-
lectual collaborator as well. Erik and Joan worked together to 
formulate the fi rst presentation of psychosocial theory and its 
eight stages of development in 1950 (J. M. Erikson, 1988). The 
case study, which was written by Erikson, gives us a brief look 
into his early life and leads us to speculate about how his life 
experiences may have guided the direction of his theoretical 
work. Just like other great thinkers of his time, being an out-
sider seems to have had some advantages for Erikson, allow-
ing him to approach the study of human development from a 
unique and creative point of view (Dunbar, 2000).

Basic Concepts of Psychosocial Theory | 63
There is fi rst of all the question of origin, which often looms 
large in individuals who are driven to be original. I grew up in 
Karlsruhe in southern Germany as the son of a pediatrician, 
Dr. Theodor Homburger, and his wife Karla, née Abrahamsen, 
a native of Copenhagen, Denmark. All through my earlier 
childhood, they kept secret from me the fact that my mother 
had been married previously; and that I was the son of a Dane 
who had abandoned her before my birth. They apparently 
thought that such secretiveness was not only workable (be-
cause children then were not held to know what they had not 
been told) but also advisable, so that I would feel thoroughly 
at home in their home. As children will do, I played in with 
this and more or less forgot the period before the age of 
three, when mother and I had lived alone. Then her friends 
had been artists working in the folk style of Hans Thoma of 
the Black Forest. They, I believe, provided my fi rst male im-
printing before I had to come to terms with that intruder, the 
bearded doctor, with his healing love and mysterious instru-
ments. Later, I enjoyed going back and forth between the 
painters’ studios and our house, the fi rst fl oor of which, in the 
afternoons, was fi lled with tense and trusting mothers and 
children. My sense of being “different” took refuge (as it is 
apt to do even in children without such acute life problems) in 
fantasies of how I, the son of much better parents, had been 
altogether a foundling. In the meantime, however, my adop-
tive father was anything but the proverbial stepfather. He had 
given me his last name (which I have retained as a middle 
name) and expected me to become a doctor like himself. 
Identity problems sharpen with that turn in puberty when 
images of future roles become inescapable. My stepfather 
was the only professional man (and a highly respected one) 
in an intensely Jewish small bourgeois family, while I (coming 
from a racially mixed Scandinavian background) was blond 
and blue-eyed, and grew fl agrantly tall. Before long, then, I 
was referred to as “goy” in my stepfather’s temple; while to 
my schoolmates I was a “Jew.” Although during World War I, 
I tried desperately to be a good German chauvinist, I became 
a “Dane” when Denmark remained neutral.
At the time, like other youths with artistic or literary as-
pirations, I became intensely alienated from everything my 
bourgeois family stood for. At that point, I set out to be dif-
ferent. After graduation from the type of high school called 
a humanistic Gymnasium, . . . I went to art school, but al-
ways again took to wandering. . . . And in those days every 
self-respecting stranger in his own (northern) culture drifted 
sooner or later to Italy, where endless time was spent soak-
ing up the southern sun and the ubiquitous sights with their 
grand blend of artifact and nature. I was a “Bohemian” then.

CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
As you think about this autobiographical case, consider the 
following questions:
 1. Why did Erikson feel like a “stranger in his own culture”?
 2. What are the biological, psychological, and societal factors 
that contributed to Erikson’s identity crisis?
 3. What factors from childhood appear to be infl uencing his 
experiences as an adolescent?
 4. Who are the signifi cant fi gures in Erikson’s life, the radius 
of signifi cant others, who infl uenced his sense of how he 
should behave and who he should strive to become?
 5. What factors might have contributed to Erikson’s ability to 
cope with the challenges of this period of his life, eventu-
ally fi nding a direction and meaning to which he could 
commit his talent and energy?
 6. Based on Erikson’s account of his childhood and adolescence, 
how might his life experiences and cultural context have infl u-
enced the nature and focus of his psychosocial theory?
Basic Concepts of 
Psychosocial Theory
Objective 2. To defi ne the six basic concepts 
of  psychosocial theory: stages of development, 
developmental tasks, psychosocial crisis, central 
process for resolving the crisis, radius of signifi cant 
relationships, and coping.

CHAPTER 3 Psychosocial Theory
Psychosocial theory accounts for systematic change over 
the life span through six basic concepts: (1) stages of devel-
opment, (2) developmental tasks, (3) psychosocial crises, 
(4) a central process for resolving the crisis at each stage, 
(5) a radiating network of signifi cant relationships, and 
(6) coping—the new behavior people generate to meet 
new challenges. These concepts will be defi ned in the fol-
lowing sections. However, each concept includes stage-
specifi c content that will be elaborated on in subsequent 
chapters.
Stages of Development
A developmental stage is a period of life that is charac-
terized by a specific underlying organization. At every 
stage, some characteristics differentiate that stage from 
the preceding and succeeding stages. Stage theories pro-
pose a specifi c direction for development. At each stage, 
the accomplishments from the previous stages provide 
resources for mastering the new challenges. In the process 
of development, it is not uncommon to observe patterns 
of plateaus, where the level of competence remains steady 
while the person integrates new abilities, followed by a 
spurt of rapid reorganization as the person attains a new, 
more complex level of functioning (Dawson, Commons, 
Wilson, & Fischer, 2005). Each stage is unique and leads 
to the acquisition of new skills related to new capabilities 
(Davison, King, Kitchener, & Parker, 1980; Fischer & Sil-
vern, 1985; Miller, 2002).
Within the framework of psychosocial theory, the concept 
of stages of development refers to a pattern of changes in the 
self-concept based on new cognitive capacities, new learn-
ing, and the acquisition of new relationship skills. At each 
stage, the biological, psychological, and societal systems 
converge around a set of defi ning challenges that require a 
new view of the self in society, and a new way of relating 
to others (Whitbourne, Sneed, & Sayer, 2009). You can ver-
ify the stage concept through refl ection on your own past. 
You can probably recall earlier periods when you were very 
preoccupied by efforts fi rst to gain your parents’ approval, 
then to win acceptance by your peers, and later to under-
stand yourself. Each of these concerns may have appeared 
all-encompassing at the time, but eventually each gave way 
to a new preoccupation. At each stage, you were confronted 
with a unique set of problems that required the integration 
of your personal needs and skills with the social demands 
of your culture. The end product was a new way of thinking 
about the self, and a new approach for engaging in interac-
tions with others.
Erikson (1963) proposed eight stages of psychosocial 
development. His formulation of these stages can be traced 
in part to the stages of psychosexual development proposed 
by Freud and in part to Erikson’s own observations and rich 
mode of thinking. Figure 3.1 shows the chart that Erikson 
produced in Childhood and Society to describe the stages of 
psychosocial development. The shaded boxes identify the 
development within the larger perspective of psychosocial 
evolution. Psychosocial evolution, a construct proposed 
by Julian Huxley (1941, 1942), refers to the range of human 
abilities that allows us to gather knowledge from our ances-
tors and transmit it to our descendants. Childrearing prac-
tices, education, and modes of communication are examples 
of mechanisms that transmit information and ways of think-
ing from one generation to the next. At the same time, 
people devise new information, new ways of thinking, and 
new ways of teaching their discoveries to others. In this way, 
psychosocial evolution has proceeded at a rapid pace, bring-
ing with it changes in technology and ideology that have 
allowed us to create and modify our physical and social 
environments. The transmission of values and  knowledge 
across generations requires the maturation of  individuals 
who are capable of creating knowledge, symbolizing it, 
adapting it, and transferring it to others. At the same time, 
societies change, posing new challenges for adaptation. 
 People change and grow, enhancing their potential for car-
rying their own and succeeding generations forward.

Basic Concepts of Psychosocial Theory | 65
because experience makes retreat impossible. In contrast to 
other stage theories, however, Erikson suggested that one can 
review and reinterpret previous stages in the light of new insight 
or new experiences.
Furthermore, the themes of earlier stages may reemerge 
at any point. Through refl ection and insight, a person can 
fi nd new meaning or a new resolution to an earlier confl ict. 
Joan Erikson refl ects on the fl uidity and hopefulness in this 
perspective:
This sequential growth . . . is now known to be more in-
fl uenced by the social milieu than was in previous years 
considered possible. . . . Where a strength is not ad-
equately developed according to the given sequence for 
its scheduled period of critical resolution, the supports 
of the environment may bring it into appropriate balance 
at a later period. Hope remains constant throughout life 
that more sturdy resolutions of the basic confrontation 
may be realized. (J. M. Erikson, 1988, pp. 74 –75)
main psychosocial confl icts of each stage. If the confl icts of 
the stage are handled well, a new sense of mastery or compe-
tence emerges. In Erikson’s original model, you will note that 
the periods of life are given names, such as oral–sensory or 
puberty and adolescence, but no ages. This approach refl ects 
Erikson’s emphasis on an individual timetable for develop-
ment, guided by both biological maturation and cultural 
expectations, rather than a strict chronological time frame for 
development.
Erikson (1963) proposed that the stages of development 
follow the epigenetic principle—a biological plan for growth 
that allows each function to emerge systematically until the fully 
functioning organism has developed. An assumption of this and 
other stage theories is that the stages form a sequence. Although 
one can anticipate challenges that will occur at a later stage, one 
passes through the stages in an orderly pattern of growth. In 
the logic of psychosocial theory, the entire life span is required 
for all the functions of psychosocial development to appear and 
become integrated. There is no going back to an earlier stage,

in the anticipation of tensions that have yet to become 
focal and in re-experiencing those tensions that were 
inadequately integrated when they were focal; similarly 
engaged are those whose age-appropriate integration 
was then, but is no longer, adequate. (p. 39)
As one leaves a stage, the achievements of that period are nei-
ther lost nor irrelevant to later stages. Important ego strengths 
emerge from the successful resolution of conflicts at every 
stage. Some of these strengths may be challenged or reorga-
nized as events take place later in life that call into question the 
essential beliefs established in an earlier period. For example, 
the psychosocial confl ict during early school age is initiative 
versus guilt. Its positive outcome, a sense of initiative, is a joy 
in innovation and experimentation and a willingness to take 
risks in order to learn more about the world. Once achieved, 
the sense of initiative provides a positive platform for the for-
mation of social relationships and for further creative intellec-
tual inquiry and discovery. However, experiences in a highly 
authoritarian school environment or in a very judgmental, 
shaming personal relationship may cause one to inhibit this 
sense of initiative or to mask it with a facade of indifference.
The concept of the psychosocial stages of development 
is very good as far as it goes, but Erikson’s road map seems 
incomplete. Three criticisms of this layout of the life span 
have been raised. First, although the boxes in the fi gure look 
very even and comparable, each stage is actually of very dif-
ferent length. Second, the fi gure suggests discrete shifts from 
one stage to the next, when in fact the themes of these stages 
overlap (McAdams & de St. Aubin, 1992). Transitions from 
stage to stage are not instantaneous. Movement from one stage 
to the next is the result of changes in several major systems, 
which takes place gradually. Third, if the idea of psychosocial 
evolution has validity—and we believe it does—new stages 
can be expected to develop as a culture evolves.
The concept of life stages permits us to consider the vari-
ous aspects of development, such as physical growth, social 
relationships, and cognitive capacities, at a given period of 
life and to speculate about their interrelation. It also encour-
ages a focus on the experiences that are unique to each life 
period—experiences that deserve to be understood both 
in their own right and for their contribution to subsequent 
development. When programs and services are designed 
to address critical needs in such areas as education, health 
care, housing, and social welfare, the developmental stage 
approach allows the designers to focus on the needs and 
resources of the particular population to be served.
Despite the usefulness of a stage approach, one must 
avoid thinking of stages as pigeonholes. Being in a given 
stage does not mean that a person cannot function at other 
levels. It is not unusual for people to anticipate later chal-
lenges before they become dominant. Many children of tod-
dler and preschool age, for example, play house, envisioning 
having a husband or a wife and children. You might say 
that, in this play, they are anticipating the issues of intimacy 
and generativity that lie ahead. The experience of having a 
child—whether this occurs at age 18, 25, or 35—is likely 
to raise issues of generativity, even if the theory suggests 
that this theme is not in its peak ascendancy until middle 
adulthood (McAdams & de St. Aubin, 1998). Whereas some 
elements of each psychosocial theme can be observed at all 
ages, the intensity with which they are expressed at certain 
times marks their importance in the defi nition of a devel-
opmental stage. Erikson, Erikson, and Kivnick (1986) put it 
this way:
The epigenetic chart also rightly suggests that the indi-
vidual is never struggling only with the tension that is 
focal at the time. Rather, at every successive develop-
mental stage, the individual is also increasingly engaged 
The epigenetic principle assumes that 
it takes the entire life span, from the 
prenatal period through  elderhood 
for all facets of human capacity to 
emerge. In later adulthood and 
 elderhood grandparents transmit 
the wisdom of their generation to 
their grandchildren by teaching them 
 stories, songs, customs, and beliefs.

associated with poverty, health, cultural group (e.g., differing 
rates of longevity), and exposure to environmental risks also 
lead to different timetables. The lengths of the stages vary, 
from the 9 months of the prenatal period to the roughly 26 
years of middle adulthood.
Developmental Tasks
Robert J. Havighurst fi rst introduced the concept of devel-
opmental tasks. He believed that human development is a 
process in which people attempt to learn the tasks required 
of them by the society to which they are adapting. These 
tasks change with age, because each society has age-graded 
expectations for behavior. “Living in a modern society is 
a long series of tasks to learn” (Havighurst, 1972, p. 2). In 
Havighurst’s view, the person who learns well receives satis-
faction and reward; the person who does not suffers unhap-
piness and social disapproval.
Although Havighurst’s view of development emphasized 
the guiding role of society in determining which skills need 
to be acquired at a certain age, he did not totally ignore the 
role of physical maturation. Havighurst believed that there 
are sensitive periods for learning developmental tasks—
that is, times when the person is most ready to acquire a new 
ability. Havighurst called these periods teachable moments. 
Most people learn developmental tasks at the time and in 
the sequence appropriate in their society. If a particular task 
is not learned during the sensitive period, it may be much 
more diffi cult to learn later on.
In this text, we have identified 11 stages of psychoso-
cial development, each with the following approximate age 
range: (1) prenatal, from conception to birth; (2) infancy, 
from birth to 2 years; (3) toddlerhood, 2 and 3 years; (4) early 
school age, 4 to 6 years; (5) middle childhood, 6 to 12 years; (6) 
early adolescence, 12 to 18 years; (7) later adolescence, 18 to 
24 years; (8) early adulthood, 24 to 34 years; (9) middle adult-
hood, 34 to 60 years; (10) later adulthood, 60 to 75 years; and 
(11) elderhood, 75 until death.
By discussing a prenatal stage, two stages of adolescent 
development rather than one, and elderhood, we are adding 
three stages to those proposed by Erikson. This revision is 
a product of our analysis of the research literature, obser-
vations through research and practice, discussions with col-
leagues, and suggestions from other stage theorists.
The addition of these three new stages provides a good 
demonstration of the process of theory construction. Theo-
ries of human development emerge and change within a 
cultural and historical context. The differentiation of adoles-
cence into two stages, for example, is a product of changes 
in the timing of onset of puberty in modern society, the 
expanding need for education and training before entry into 
the world of work, related changes in the structure of the 
educational system, and the variety of available life choices 
in work, marriage, parenting, and ideology.

opment as presented in this textbook. The age range given

CHAPTER 3 Psychosocial Theory
The basic premise associated with the concept of devel-
opmental tasks, regardless of their specifi c content, is that 
a relatively small number of major psychosocial challenges 
dominate a person’s problem-solving efforts and learning 
during a given stage of life. As these tasks are mastered, new 
competencies enhance the person’s ability to engage in more 
complex social relationships and advanced problem solv-
ing. Effective mastery of the developmental tasks of a spe-
cifi c stage of life provides building blocks for mastery of the 
tasks of future stages (Masten, Obradovic ´, & Burt, 2006). We 
assume that successful cultures will stimulate behavior that 
helps its members learn what they need to know for both 
their own survival and that of the group.
In the case presented earlier in the chapter, Erikson pro-
vides an example of how the culture supports a person’s 
work on the developmental tasks of a particular life stage. As 
he was entering later adolescence following graduation from 
Gymnasium, Erikson took advantage of a culturally accepted 
period of exploration by traveling to Italy. During this period, 
he was able to work on several of the developmental tasks of 
later adolescence, especially gaining greater autonomy from 
his family, experimenting with possible career paths, and 
clarifying his values and beliefs by becoming a “Bohemian.”
Keep in mind that the person is maturing in a few impor-
tant domains at once during each period of life. Tasks involv-
ing physical, emotional, intellectual, and social growth, as 
well as growth in one’s self-concept, all contribute to one’s 
resources for dealing with the challenges of life. Table 3.1 
shows the developmental tasks we have identifi ed as areas 
of learning for most people in modern society and the stages 
during which each set of tasks is of primary learning value. 
There are 42 developmental tasks on the list. Whereas 
the infant is learning orientations and skills related to the 
fi rst fi ve, a person at the early adulthood stage has already 
acquired skills related to 27 tasks from the previous stages. 
New learning may continue in these areas as well as in the 
four new developmental tasks faced by the young adult. 
This helps one appreciate that by the time people reach early 
adulthood, they have a considerable repertoire of competen-
cies that can be used to cope with the challenges of life. By 
the stage of elderhood a person has all the areas of previous 
learning to draw from while working on three new tasks.
Psychosocial Crisis
A psychosocial crisis refers to a state of tension that results 
from the discrepancies between the person’s competences at 
the beginning of a stage, and the society’s expectations for 
behavior at that period of life (Erikson, 1963). For exam-
ple, in toddlerhood, the second stage of development from 
roughly ages 2 to 4, the psychosocial crisis is autonomy 
versus shame and doubt. At the beginning of this stage, the 
toddler may have established a strong, positive, and trusting 
relationship with the caregiver. Now the child is expected 
to function more independently, to take care of some basic 
needs by oneself, and to exercise new levels of self-control. 
At each stage of life, one faces new developmental tasks 
that contribute to increased mastery over one’s environment. 
These tasks refl ect areas of accomplishment in physical, cog-
nitive, social, and emotional development, as well as develop-
ment of the self-concept. The specifi c tasks we identify differ 
from those outlined in Havighurst’s writings. Our choice of 
tasks is based on broad areas of accomplishment that have 
been identifi ed by researchers as critical to psychological and 
social growth at each stage of life in a modern, technological 
culture. We recognize that the demands for growth may dif-
fer according to the orientation and complexity of a particu-
lar society. For example, in comparing gender role norms in 
Iran and the United States, Thomas (1999) pointed out that 
the legal minimum age for women to marry in Iran is 9 years 
and that at any age, Iranian women must have permission 
from their father or grandfather to marry. We have identi-
fi ed early adulthood—roughly ages 24 through 34—as the 
time when most people in the United States are focusing on 
exploring intimate relationships and making decisions about 
marriage. In the United States, women are free to marry 
without parental or family consent after age 18. Thus, the 
developmental task associated with establishing a commit-
ment to an intimate partner would be present in both cul-
tures, but the ages at which this task is usually addressed and 
the context for forming such a commitment differ from one 
society to the next.

context refers to a normal set of stresses and strains rather 
than to an extraordinary set of events.
Societal demands vary from stage to stage. People expe-
rience these demands as mild but persistent expectations 
for behavior. They may be demands for greater self-control, 
further development of skills, or a stronger commitment 
These may be experienced as new demands that the child 
may first encounter with some distress, overreaching by 
asserting too much autonomy, or being shamed for acting 
overly dependent. At each stage, the sense of crisis arises 
because one must make psychological efforts to adjust to the 
demands of the social environment. The word crisis in this

CHAPTER 3 Psychosocial Theory
The outcome of the crisis at each stage is an integration 
of the two opposing forces. For each person, the relative 
frequency and signifi cance of positive and negative experi-
ences will contribute to a resolution of the crisis. The like-
lihood of a completely positive or a completely negative 
resolution is small. Most individuals resolve the crises in a 
generally positive direction, supported by a combination of 
positive experiences and natural maturational tendencies. At 
each successive stage, however, the likelihood of a negative 
resolution mounts as the developmental tasks become more 
complex and the chances of encountering societal barriers to 
development increase.
To understand the process of growth at each life stage, we 
have to consider the negative as well as the positive pole of 
each crisis. The dynamic tension between the positive and 
negative forces refl ects the struggles a person encounters to 
restrain unbridled impulses, to overcome fears and doubts, 
and to look past one’s own needs to consider the needs of 
others. The negative poles offer insight into basic areas of 
human vulnerability. In every psychosocial crisis, experi-
ences at both the positive and negative poles contribute to 
the total range of a person’s adaptive capacities. Although 
a steady diet of mistrust is undesirable, for example, it is 
important that a trusting person be able to evaluate situa-
tions and people for their trustworthiness. This ability is 
based in part on experiences of mistrust, which help a per-
son recognize cues about safety or danger in any encounter.
Why conceptualize life in terms of crises? Does this idea 
adequately portray the experience of the individual, or does 
it overemphasize confl ict and abnormality? The term crisis 
implies that tension and confl ict are necessary to the devel-
opmental process; crisis and its resolution are viewed as nor-
mative, biologically based components of life experience at 
every stage.
The term psychosocial draws attention to the fact that the 
psychosocial crises are, in part, the result of cultural pres-
sures and expectations. Individuals will experience tension 
because of the culture’s need to socialize and integrate its 
members. The concept acknowledges the dynamic confl icts 
between individuality and group membership at each period 
of life.
In Erikson’s case, he attributes the psychosocial crisis 
around his personal identity to a convergence of biological, 
psychological, and societal factors. He is physically different 
from his Jewish family members; he is identifi ed as a reli-
gious outsider by his friends; and he is an object of tradi-
tional, middle-class family values and expectations that he 
rejects. As he emerges into later adolescence, he finds his 
transitional identity as an artist, an identity that he explores 
for several years before discovering his potential as a teacher, 
therapist, and theorist.
The exact nature of the psychosocial crisis is not the 
same at each stage. For example, few cultural limits are 
placed on infants. The outcome of the psychosocial crisis of 
infancy depends greatly on the skill of the caregiver. At early 
school age, the culture stands in fairly direct opposition to 
to goals. Before the end of each stage of development, the 
individual tries to achieve a resolution, adjust to society’s 
demands, and at the same time translate those demands into 
personal terms. This process produces a state of tension that 
the individual must reduce in order to proceed to the next 
stage.
Mastery of the developmental tasks is infl uenced by the 
resolution of the psychosocial crisis of the previous stage. 
This resolution leads to the development of new social capa-
bilities. These capabilities orient the person toward new 
experiences, a new aptitude for relationships, and new feel-
ings of personal worth as the challenges of the next stage’s 
developmental tasks begin. In turn, the skills learned during 
a particular stage as a result of work on its developmental 
tasks provide the tools for the resolution of the psychosocial 
crisis of that stage. Task accomplishment and crisis resolu-
tion interact to produce individual life stories.
Psychosocial Crises of the Life Stages
Table 3.2 lists the psychosocial crisis of each stage of devel-
opment from infancy through elderhood. This scheme, 
derived from Erikson’s model shown in Figure 3.1, depicts 
the crises as polarities—for example, trust versus mistrust, 
and autonomy versus shame and doubt. These contrasting 
conditions suggest the underlying dimensions along which 
each psychosocial crisis is resolved. According to psychoso-
cial theory, most people experience both ends of the con-
tinuum. The inevitable discrepancy between one’s level of 
development at the beginning of a stage and society’s push 
for a new level of functioning by the end of it creates at least 
a mild degree of the negative dimension. For example, even 
within a loving, caring family environment that promotes 
trust, an infant will experience some moments of frustration 
or disappointment that result in mistrust.

the child’s initiative in some matters by discouraging curios-
ity or questioning about certain topics, but offers abundant 
encouragement to initiative in others. In young adulthood, 
the dominant cultural push is toward the establishment of 
intimate relationships, yet an individual may be unable to 
attain intimacy because of the lack of time to cultivate these 
relationships, competing pressures from the workplace, 
cultural norms against certain expressions of intimacy, or 
restrictions against certain types of unions.
As refl ected in the epigenetic principle, the succession of 
crises occurs in a predictable sequence over the life course. 
Although Erikson did not specify the exact ages for each 
crisis, the theory hypothesizes an age-related progression, 
in which each crisis has its time of special ascendancy. The 
combination of biological, psychological, and societal forces 
that operate to bring about change has a degree of regularity 
within society that places each psychosocial crisis at a par-
ticular period of life. The research described in the Applying 
Theory and Research to Life box illustrates one approach for 
exploring the empirical basis of this concept.
In addition to the predictable psychosocial crises, any 
number of unforeseen stresses may arise.
Parents’ divorce, the death of a sibling, victimization by 
violence, the loss of a job, and widowhood are examples 
of unforeseen life crises. The need to cope with them may 
overwhelm a person, particularly if several crises occur at the 
same time. The picture of predictable developmental stress 
that is emphasized in psychosocial theory must be expanded 
to include the possibility of unanticipated crises. Although 
these chance events may foster growth and new competen-
cies, they may also result in defensiveness, regression, or 
dread. The impact of an unpredictable crisis will depend in 
part on whether the person is in a state of psychosocial crisis 
The attack on the World Trade 
Center on September 11, 2001, 
brought unforeseen crises to 
thousands. At different devel-
opmental stages, people adapt 
in unique ways to crisis and 
loss. The impact of this crisis on 
the subsequent psychosocial 
 development for the generations 
who experienced it is yet to be 
understood.

CHAPTER 3 Psychosocial Theory
opportunity to observe. Through persistent imitative activ-
ity, children expand their self-initiated behavior and control 
over their actions. Repetitive experiences of this kind allow 
children to believe that they can do more things on their 
own, advancing their sense of personal autonomy.
The central process for coping with the challenges of each 
life stage provides both personal and societal mechanisms for 
taking in new information and reorganizing existing infor-
mation. It also suggests the means that are most likely to lead 
to a revision of the psychological system so that the crisis of 
that particular stage may be resolved. Each central process 
results in an intensive reworking of the psychological sys-
tem, including a reorganization of boundaries, values, and 
images of oneself and others. Table 3.3 shows the central 
processes that lead to the acquisition of new skills, and the 
resolution of the psychosocial crisis at each life stage.
Radius of Signifi cant Relationships
Age-related demands on individuals are communicated 
through the radius of signifi cant relationships (Erikson, 
1982, p. 31; see Figure 3.4). Initially, a person focuses on 
a small number of relationships. During childhood, ado-
lescence, and early adulthood, the number of relationships 
expands, and the quality of these relationships takes on 
greater variety in depth and intensity. In later adulthood, the 
person often returns to a small number of extremely impor-
tant relationships that provide opportunities for great depth 
and intimacy.
In Erikson’s case study, he recalls a network of artists 
who may have influenced him at a very early age while 
he was living with his mother. Then, the radius of signifi-
cant relationships shifted to include his father, Dr. Hom-
burger, who was a trusted and respected professional. 
As he moved into later adolescence, he found a group 
of like-minded young people with artistic and literary 
at the time. For example, the unexpected death of a sibling 
might be exceptionally disruptive for someone who is also 
in a period of questioning related to personal identity, where 
matters of family loyalties and commitments to values and 
beliefs are unresolved.
The combination of predictable crises, unpredictable cri-
ses, and unique historical pressures may lead to the resurfac-
ing of prior crises that require reorganization. For example, 
during early adulthood, when issues of intimacy versus isola-
tion are salient, it is common to fi nd a reworking of industry 
versus inferiority as well (Whitbourne, Zuschlag, Elliot, & 
Waterman, 1992). Young adults encounter the very concrete 
challenges of establishing themselves in the labor market and 
achieving self-sufficiency. The outcome of this reworking 
of an earlier crisis will depend in part on historical factors, 
such as the economic and materialistic orientation of the 
society as a specifi c age group enters early adulthood. It will 
also depend on additional individual factors—especially on 
whether the adult is able to forge a meaningful occupational 
role that is consistent with personal and community values 
(Whitbourne, Sneed, & Sayer, 2009). Thus, the psychosocial 
crises are not resolved and put to rest once and for all. Each 
crisis is played and replayed both during ongoing develop-
mental changes and when life events challenge a balance that 
was achieved earlier.
The Central Process for Resolving 
the Psychosocial Crisis
Every psychosocial crisis refl ects some discrepancy between 
the person’s developmental competencies at the beginning of 
the stage and new societal pressures for more effective, inte-
grated functioning. How is the discrepancy resolved? What 
experiences or processes permit the person to interpret the 
expectations and demands of society and internalize them in 
order to support change? We have identifi ed a central pro-
cess through which each psychosocial crisis is resolved. The 
central process suggests a way that the person takes in or 
makes sense of cultural expectations and undergoes adap-
tive modifi cations of the self. The term process suggests a 
means by which the person recognizes new social pressures 
and expectations, gives these expectations personal meaning, 
and gradually changes.
The process, unfolding over time, results in a new relation-
ship between self and society. For example, in toddlerhood, 
the psychosocial crisis raises the question of how children 
increase their sense of autonomy without risking too many 
experiences that provoke a sense of shame and doubt. We 
suggest that imitation is the central process for psychosocial 
growth during toddlerhood (ages 2 and 3). Children expand 
their range of skills by imitating adults, siblings, television 
models, playmates, and even animals. Movement toward a 
sense of autonomy in toddlerhood is facilitated by the child’s 
readiness to imitate, by the variety of models available for 
observation, and by the variety of behaviors the child has the

that the self-concept and worldview 
are reorganized at each stage of life

and Alison Holmes (2004) asked adults 
between the ages of 62 and 89 to recall 
memories for each decade of their 
lives from the fi rst 10 years through the 
decade of the 60s. The participants were 
asked about the decades in a random 
order and were given 5 minutes per 
decade to write down up to 3 memories 
from that time of life. Each memory was 
dated to the nearest year and month 
within the decade. The memories were 
then coded for the degree to which 
they refl ected themes inherent in the 
psychosocial crises.
Fifty participants produced 552 
memories. Figure 3.3 shows the 
distribution of memories coded for 
each psychosocial stage by decade. 
The two decades from ages 10 to 19 
and 20 to 29 produced the largest 
number of memories. As predicted, 
memories tied to early psychosocial 
crises (wanting to be or being nurtured, 
helped, and taught; having fun and 
playing; encounters with parents, 
family members, and teachers) were 
most frequently recalled in association 
with the fi rst decade of life. Memories 
associated with identity and identity 
confusion were most frequent in the 
second decade of life. Memories related 
to intimacy were of greatest frequency 
in the third decade. In contrast to 
childhood memories that decline 
noticeably from the fi rst decade of life, 
memories associated with generativity 
increased gradually from the 20s to the 
40s and continued to be prominent in 
the decades of the 50s and the 60s. 
Relatively few memories were coded 
as refl ecting the themes of integrity 
and despair, but those memories were 
tied primarily to the decade of the 
60s. These fi ndings use biographical 
memory recall to support the view that 
the self is reorganized around different 
goals and preoccupations at various 
stages of life that refl ect the demands 
and satisfactions associated with the 
psychosocial crises of those stages.

his traditional family, and offered a milieu of acceptance

At each stage of life, the network of signifi cant relation-
ships determines the demands that will be made, how the 
person will be taken care of, and the meaning that could be 
derived from the relationships. The relationship network 
varies individually, but each person has a network of signifi -
cant relationships and an increasing readiness to enter into a 
more complex social life (Vanzetti & Duck, 1996). The qual-
ity of these relationships and the norms for interaction are 
infl uenced by the nature of the specifi c social context.

CHAPTER 3 Psychosocial Theory
separation of family members or provide exposure to other 
unpredictable stressors that may disrupt the course of devel-
opment. Family, culture, and ethnic group are three of the 
major contexts through which the radius of signifi cant rela-
tionships is organized.
Families. All over the world, children are raised by small 
groups or families. Family is the universal primary social 
context of childhood. The family continues to be a mean-
ingful context throughout life, especially as we think of the 
relationship of adults with their aging parents, the formation 
of new families in adulthood, and the lifelong connections 
among siblings. Historically, the term family has referred to 
a group of people, usually related by blood, marriage, or 
adoption. In contemporary U.S. society, however, people 
who view themselves as members of a family may have no 
legal relationship or shared ancestral bond. The psychoso-
cial meaning of family continues to be defi ned as individ-
uals who share a common destiny and who experience a 
sense of emotional intimacy. People in a family care about 
one another and take care of one another (Price, Price, & 
McKenry, 2010).
Contexts of Development
One way of thinking about the impact of the societal system 
is to consider individuals as embedded in a kaleidoscope of 
changing, interconnected systems. Children are members of 
families. Parents and other relatives are members of other 
important work and community groups that can infl uence 
families. As they get older, children may become members 
of other institutions, such as child care programs, schools, 
religious groups, community clubs, or athletic teams. Com-
munities are nested in cities, counties, states, and nations. 
An understanding of development requires insight into each 
level of social organization as well as across the culture as a 
whole. These organizations infl uence what is expected of its 
members, the roles they play, the activities they engage in, 
the resources available to meet these expectations, and the 
risks they may encounter.
The contexts of development embody social, economic, 
and historical factors. Events such as war, political revolu-
tion, famine, or economic collapse may temporarily alter the 
prevailing childrearing values, opportunities for education 
or employment, and the availability of resources. Further-
more, these events may increase exposure to violence and

the ethnic heritage of particular groups. Current research has 
focused on the development of ethnic identity, particularly 
the ways in which one’s ethnic heritage and cultural values 
are integrated into one’s personal identity. Ethnic values may 
include views about family cohesiveness, the importance of 
certain religious practices, the role and meaning of education, 
attitudes toward elders, or efforts to preserve a language and 
customs. The infl uence of one’s ethnic heritage is likely to 
change from one generation to another. Recent studies exam-
ine the role of ethnic values and beliefs for fi rst-generation 
immigrants as compared to second- and third-generation off-
spring. Increasing attention is being given to the lifestyles, 
identity development, parenting practices, and family values 
of ethnic groups, and we will give special attention to studies 
that highlight ethnic group comparisons where possible.
Coping Behavior
Coping refers to people’s conscious, adaptive efforts to 
manage stressful events or situations, and their efforts 
to manage the emotions associated with these stressors 
(Somerfield & McCrae, 2000). Coping is a process that 
begins with an appraisal of the situation. This includes 
answers to the following questions: What is the nature of 
this stressor? How much of a threat is it? How much time 
do I have to deal with this challenge? How much control 
do I have over the situation? Following the appraisal, one 
must enlist cognitive, affective, and behavioral strategies 
to manage the stress. Lazarus and Folkman (1984) distin-
guished between coping efforts that are targeted at chang-
ing something about the source of stress (problem-focused 
coping) and strategies that are targeted at managing or 
Culture. Culture refers to the socially standardized ways of 
thinking, feeling, and acting that are shared by members of 
a society. Culture includes the concepts, habits, skills, arts, 
technology, religion, and government of a people. It encom-
passes the tools and symbol systems that give structure and 
meaning to experience. In relation to human development, 
cultures have implicit theories about the stages of life, the 
expectations for behavior as one matures, and the nature of 
one’s obligations to the older and younger members of the 
cultural group. A culture exerts infl uence directly through 
families as well as through other social organizations such as 
churches and schools. As is true for other nations, the United 
States’ culture has a strong, unifying impact on its citizens. 
Within the United States, there are also noticeable regional 
cultural patterns marked by unique vocabulary and dialect, 
mannerisms, and styles of social interaction. Throughout 
this book, we will note the great differences in what life—
including family life—is like in different cultures and note 
how the integration of person and culture produces distinc-
tive personal experiences for individuals in various cultures.
Ethnic Groups. In addition to the common threads of cul-
ture that affect everyone who grows up or lives for a long 
time in the United States, there are also persistent subcul-
tural forces that shape the daily lives of children and adults. 
The United States is a complex society made up of people 
from a vast array of cultures throughout the world. We call 
these groups ethnic subcultures or ethnic groups. People 
who belong to ethnic groups share socially standardized 
ways of thinking, feeling, and acting with other members of 
their group. Holidays such as St. Patrick’s Day, Oktoberfest, 
or Kwanzaa are examples of public occasions that celebrate

CHAPTER 3 Psychosocial Theory
creating or reemphasizing the meaning, values, and opportu-
nities embedded in the stressful situation (Folkman & Mos-
kowitz, 2000). For example, as Robert cared for his partner 
who had AIDS, he took special pleasure in  routine, daily events 
like planning an enjoyable meal that they shared together. In 
the face of feelings of helplessness about the uncontrollable 
changes in his partner’s condition, Robert also took steps to set 
attainable goals, like creating a video library of favorite mov-
ies that he and his partner could enjoy together. Thus, even 
while Robert was experiencing many negative emotions, he 
also found positive experiences in the context of the stress.
Some people are better able to cope with the challenges 
that they are faced with than others. The term resilience 
is often used to characterize individuals who exhibit posi-
tive outcomes in the face of serious threats to development. 
They may have experienced prolonged, severe poverty; they 
may have a parent with a serious mental illness; or they may 
have been exposed to ongoing abuse or violence. Faced with 
these or other difficulties, resilient individuals show low 
levels of psychological symptoms, and function effectively 
in the basic developmental tasks expected for their stage of 
life (Masten, Obradovic ´, & Burt, 2006). Over time, they cre-
ate lives that integrate their own personal strengths with the 
resources and opportunities of their community, meeting the 
community’s expectations for maturity. Although the story 
of resilience is highly individual, refl ecting unique patterns 
of life challenges and coping strategies, the notion of resil-
ience underscores a widely shared capacity to recover from 
adversity. There appear to be a small number of factors that 
support resilience including: “connections to competent and 
caring adults in the family and community; cognitive and 
self-regulation skills; positive views of self; and motivation to 
be effective in the environment” (Masten, 2001, p. 13).
An individual’s characteristic style of coping is a dynamic 
set of actions that changes in response to changing conditions. 
In research about how individuals cope with chronic pain, for 
example, participants were asked to make daily entries in a 
diary and were also prompted several times a day to respond 
to a set of questions about their appraisal of the situation, their 
mood, and their behaviors (Tennen, Affl eck, Armeli, & Carney, 
2000). Participants were most likely to use problem-focused 
strategies to cope with pain, or to use problem-focused and 
emotion-focused coping at the same time. However, as time 
went on, if the pain did not subside with the use of problem-
focused strategies, they were likely to turn to emotion-focused 
solutions. In other words, the coping process was sensitive to 
the results of various strategies. If a person fi nds that active 
efforts to reduce pain are not working, then subsequent cop-
ing may shift to seeking spiritual or emotional support or try-
ing to redefi ne the situation to make it more bearable.
As a result of experiencing mastery and competence 
through coping, one builds a more positive expectation about 
being able to face new challenges. The positive consequences 
of coping help to sustain individuals during prolonged stress-
ors. One can see how, over time, effective coping contributes 
to development. In the face of threat, coping behavior may 
controlling one’s emotions in the face of the stressor 
(emotion-focused coping). Often, these strategies are used 
together. Claire, who has taken a week of vacation, has 
returned to work to find a basket full of mail, 20 voice 
messages, and 80 email messages. She still has her usual 
daily workload. She decides to take a short lunch and 
stay an hour late in order to catch up. At the same time, 
she tries to remain calm and think about the wonderfully 
relaxing time she had on her vacation so that she does 
not become depressed by this huge amount of work.
In order to understand how a person copes with a stressful 
situation, one must consider: (1) the nature of the stressor, 
(2) how it is perceived by the person, and (3) the range of 
resources that are available to address the situation (McCub-
bin & Patterson, 1982; Lazarus, 2000). The coping process 
depends on the specifi c stressful situation. One does not cope 
the same way if the house is on fi re or if the baby has a high 
fever. In the situation of bereavement, for example, there are 
no actions the grieving person can take to bring the lost loved 
one back to life. The major coping task for the survivors is 
to fi nd a way to reconcile themselves to the situation and to 
carry on with their own lives (Wortman & Boerner, 2007).
The approach to coping also depends on the values, beliefs, 
and goals of the person or family involved and on how these 
values, beliefs, and goals lead to a particular interpretation of 
the stressor event. For example, in one family, the announce-
ment that an oldest child decides to enlist in the military may 
be greeted with great joy and pride; in another family, that 
same announcement may be greeted with dismay and disap-
pointment. Both families will worry about the child’s safety and 
will experience the stress of the child’s absence. However, the 
family’s beliefs and goals will determine the meaning given to a 
child’s decision to join the military.
Finally, individuals and families differ in the resources that 
are available to cope with a diffi cult situation. Resources include 
such things as social support, information, professional advice, 
fi nancial resources, and a sense of humor. Fewer resources, or 
the lack of the appropriate resources, may impede the coping 
process. In a study exploring how people cope with fi nancial 
stress, problem-focused coping was found to be more effective 
in reducing distress than emotion-focused coping (Caplan & 
Schooler, 2007). Among those participating in this study, those 
with lower SES resources were found to use more emotion-
focused coping strategies and, as a result, had higher levels of 
psychosocial distress. Lower SES participants had lower self-
confi dence and a greater degree of fatalism, a belief that events 
in life are largely out of one’s control. These two factors, low self-
confi dence and high fatalism, were strongly related to the lim-
ited use of problem-focused coping. Thus, the study illustrated 
that the path from low SES to distress over fi nancial strain is 
brought about largely through perceived lack of control, which 
interferes with the mobilization of problem-focused coping.
Coping behavior is an important concept in psychosocial 
theory because it explains how unique and inventive behav-
iors occur. An important aspect of coping is the ability to rede-
fi ne or reappraise the situation in a positive way. This suggests

example, permits a person to feel free to exercise wit to solve 
problems without being weighed down by a sense of inferiority.
The prime adaptive ego qualities and their definitions 
are listed in Table 3.4. These ego qualities contribute to the 
person’s dominant worldview, which is continuously refor-
mulated to accommodate new ego qualities (Markstrom, 
Sabino, Turner, & Berman, 1997). The importance of many 
of the prime adaptive ego qualities, including hope, purpose, 
competence, love, and wisdom, has been verifi ed by research 
(Lopez & Snyder, 2003). For example, a new measure, The 
Psychosocial Inventory of Ego Strengths, has been developed to 
assess the relationship of the prime adaptive ego strengths 
to psychosocial well-being. As anticipated, higher scores 
on the psychosocial inventory were correlated with identity 
achievement, self-esteem, locus of control, empathic con-
cern, and perspective taking (Markstrom & Marshall, 2007).
allow an individual to act effectively, rather than merely to 
maintain equilibrium or become disorganized.
According to psychosocial theory, at each stage of life, con-
sistent efforts to face and cope with the psychosocial crisis of 
the period result in the formation of basic adaptive capaci-
ties, referred to as the prime adaptive ego qualities. When 
coping is unsuccessful and the challenges of the period are 
not adequately mastered, individuals are likely to form mal-
adaptive orientations, referred to as core pathologies.
Prime Adaptive Ego Qualities
Erikson (1978) postulated prime adaptive ego qualities that 
develop from the positive resolution of the psychosocial crisis 
of a given stage and provide resources for coping with the next. 
He described these qualities as mental states that shape the 
interpretation of life experiences. A sense of competence, for

CHAPTER 3 Psychosocial Theory
Although we believe that psychosocial theory provides a 
useful theoretical framework for organizing the vast array of 
observations in the fi eld of human development, we recog-
nize that it has weaknesses as well as strengths. As a stu-
dent of development, you must begin to form your own 
independent judgment of its usefulness and be alert to how 
the theory may infl uence your thinking. The strengths and 
weaknesses of psychosocial theory that are discussed in the 
following sections are listed in Table 3.6.
Strengths
Psychosocial theory highlights the social nature of human 
development. Human beings depend for their survival on 
their capacity to form social bonds and to recognize and 
respond to social messages. Although the fi eld of psychol-
ogy has traditionally focused on the thoughts and behaviors 
of individuals, a growing body of research emphasizes the 
social nature of mental functioning. Thus, the basic view of 
development offered by psychosocial theory as a product of 
interactions between the individual and the social environ-
ment is gaining increasing support.
Psychosocial theory provides a broad, integrative context 
within which to study life-span development (Kiston, 1994; 
Hopkins, 1995). The theory links the process of child devel-
opment to stages of adult life, individual development to the 
nature of culture and society, and the personal and histori-
cal past to the personal and societal future. Although many 
scholars agree that such a broad perspective is necessary, few 
other theories attempt to address the interplay between indi-
vidual development and society (Miller, 2002).
Psychosocial theory provides a framework for tracing the 
process through which self-concept, self-esteem, and self-
other boundaries become integrated into a positive, adap-
tive, socially engaged person (Hamachek, 1985, 1994). 
Emphasizing the normal, hopeful, and creative aspects of 
Focusing specifi cally on the ego quality of hope, Erikson and 
his colleagues found that people in later life who were hope-
ful about their own future and that of their children were more 
intellectually vigorous and psychologically resilient than those 
who were less hopeful (Erikson et al., 1986). People with a 
hopeful attitude have a better chance of maintaining their spirits 
and strength in the face of crisis than people who are pessimis-
tic. For both young and older adults, the ego strength of hope 
has been found to be a signifi cant predictor of life satisfaction 
(Isaacowitz, Vaillant, & Seligman, 2003).
Core Pathologies
Although most people develop the prime adaptive ego quali-
ties, a potential core pathology or destructive force may also 
emerge as a result of ineffective, negatively balanced crisis 
resolution at each stage (Erikson, 1982; see Table 3.5). The 
core pathologies also serve as guiding orientations for behav-
ior. These pathologies move people away from others, tend 
to prevent further exploration of interpersonal relations, and 
obstruct the resolution of subsequent psychosocial crises. 
The energy that would normally be directed toward mas-
tering the developmental tasks of a stage is directed instead 
toward resisting or avoiding change. The core pathologies 
are not simply passive limitations or barriers to growth. They 
are energized worldviews leading to strategies that protect 
people from further unwanted association with the social 
system and its persistent, tension-producing demands.

socialization and maturation throughout life. Societies, with 
their structures, laws, roles, rituals, and sanctions, are orga-
nized to guide individual growth toward a particular ideal 
of mature adulthood. However, every society faces problems 
when it attempts to balance the needs of the individual with 
the needs of the group. All individuals face some strains as 
they attempt to experience their individuality while main-
taining the support of their groups and attempting to fi t into 
their society. Psychosocial theory offers concepts for explor-
ing these natural tensions.
Longitudinal research using psychosocial theory as a 
framework for studying patterns of personality change and 
self-concept development has found support for many of its 
basic concepts. Changes in psychological outlook that refl ect 
the major themes of the theory—such as industry, identity, 
intimacy, and generativity—appear to emerge and become 
consolidated over time (Whitbourne et al., 2009). There is 
also evidence of a preview of themes prior to their period of 
maximum ascendancy (Peterson & Steward, 1993) and evi-
dence for the notion of revisitation through which adults are 
stimulated to rework and reorganize the resolutions of earlier 
issues (Shibley, 2000).
Weaknesses
One weakness of psychosocial theory is that the explanations 
of the mechanisms for resolving crises and moving from one 
stage to the next are not well developed (Miller, 2009). The 
theory does not offer a universal mechanism for crisis resolu-
tion, nor a detailed picture of the kinds of experiences that 
are necessary at each stage if one is to cope successfully with 
the crisis of that stage. We have addressed this weakness by 
including the concepts of developmental tasks and a central 
process for each stage. The developmental tasks suggest some 
of the major achievements that permit a person to meet the 
social expectations of each stage. The central process identifi es 
coping and adaptation, the theory has taken the study of 
development beyond the deterministic position of psycho-
sexual theory or the mechanistic view of behaviorism, pro-
viding an essential conceptual framework for the emergence 
of positive psychology.
At one time, some argued that a weakness of psychosocial 
theory was that its basic concepts were presented in language 
that is abstract and diffi cult to examine empirically (Crain, 
2000; Miller, 2002). However, over the past 20 years, such 
terms as hope, inhibition, autonomy, personal identity, intimacy, 
generativity, and integrity—to name a few—have been opera-
tionalized (Christiansen & Palkovitz, 1998; McAdams & de 
St. Aubin, 1998; Bohlin, Bengtsgard, & Andersson, 2000; 
Kroger, 2000; Marcia, 2002; Snyder, 2002; Lopez & Snyder, 
2003). Concepts central to the theory—such as trust, auton-
omy, identity achievement, coping, well-being, social sup-
port, and intergenerational interdependence—have become 
thoroughly integrated into contemporary human develop-
ment scholarship. Researchers have developed instruments 
to trace the emergence of psychosocial crises and their 
resolution in samples varying in age from adolescence to 
later adulthood (Constantinople, 1969; Waterman & Whit-
bourne, 1981; Darling-Fisher & Leidy, 1988; Hawley, 1988; 
Domino & Affonso, 1990; Whitbourne et al., 1992; Whit-
bourne et al., 2009).
Unlike some other theories, psychosocial theory identi-
fi es tensions that may disrupt development at each life stage, 
providing a useful framework for considering individual dif-
ferences in development. The positive and negative poles of 
each psychosocial crisis offer a way of thinking about differ-
ences in self-concept development at each stage of life as well 
as a model for considering cumulative differences across the 
life span. This matrix of crises and stages also provides a use-
ful tool for approaching psychotherapy and counseling.
The concept of normative psychosocial crises is a creative 
contribution that identifies predictable tensions between

The theory provides a broad, integrative framework within which 
to study the life span.
The theory provides insight into the directions of healthy 
 development across the life span.
Many of the basic ideas of the theory have been operationalized 
using traditional and novel approaches to assessment.
The concept of psychosocial crises, including the positive and 
negative poles of the crisis, offers a model for considering indi-
vidual differences within a framework of normal development.
The concept of the psychosocial crisis identifi es predictable 
 tensions between socialization and maturation.
Longitudinal studies support the general direction of 
 development hypothesized by the theory.
Explanations for the mechanisms of crisis resolution and 
 process of moving from one stage to the next need to be 
 developed more fully.
The idea of a specifi c number of stages of life and their link to 
a genetic plan for development is disputed.
The theory and much of its supporting research have been 
dominated by a male, Eurocentric perspective that gives too 
much emphasis to individuality and not enough attention to 
connection and social relatedness.
The specifi c ways that culture encourages or inhibits 
 development at each stage of life are not clearly elaborated.

CHAPTER 3 Psychosocial Theory
Erikson’s theory does not consider, but that clearly plays a 
central role in setting the stage for a lifetime of vulnerabilities 
and competencies. These revisions demonstrate the natu-
ral evolution of a theoretical framework as it continues to 
encounter new observations.
Finally, psychosocial theory and related research have 
been criticized as being dominated by a male, Eurocen-
tric, individualistic perspective that emphasizes the ability 
to originate plans and take action, called agency, over the 
commitment to and consideration for the well-being of oth-
ers, called communion (Abele & Wojciszke, 2007). Critics 
have argued that the themes of autonomy, initiative, industry, 
and personal identity, which refl ect individuality, have been 
equated with psychological maturity. They suggest that rela-
tively little attention has been given to the development of 
interpersonal connection and social relatedness. These latter 
themes have been identifi ed as central for an understand-
ing of the psychosocial maturity of girls and young women. 
They also emerge in the study of collectively oriented eth-
nic groups—cultures in which maturity is equated with 
one’s ability to support and sustain the success of the fam-
ily or the extended family group rather than with one’s own 
achievement of status, wealth, or recognition (Boykin, 1994; 
Josselson, 2003).
Within the framework of psychosocial theory, the theme 
of connection is addressed directly through the fi rst psycho-
social crisis of trust versus mistrust in infancy, but then the 
thread is lost until early adolescence and early and middle 
adulthood, when group identity, intimacy, and generativity 
direct the focus back to the critical links that individuals 
build with others. The concept of the radius of signifi cant 
relationships serves to maintain the perspective of the person 
interwoven in a tapestry of relationships, focusing especially 
on family and friends in childhood; the family, peer group, 
love relationships, and close friends in early and later adoles-
cence; and on intimate partners, family, friends, and cowork-
ers in adult life. A basic premise of psychosocial theory is 
that the self-concept is taking shape in constant interaction 
with the community (Schlein, 1987, 2007).
To extend the theme of connection, this book elaborates 
on developing capabilities for social interaction and differ-
ences in socialization practices and outcomes for men and 
women in our society. A variety of social abilities, including 
empathy, prosocial behavior, interaction skills, and compo-
nents of social cognition, are traced as they emerge in the 
context of family relationships, friendship, peer groups, and 
work. This book considers ethnic groups as well as broader 
social infl uences on development and the importance of a 
collective orientation toward responsibility in caring for chil-
dren and creating a sense of community.
A Recap of Psychosocial Theory
Figure 3.5 shows development as a building process that 
incorporates the six constructs of psychosocial theory. The 
structure grows larger as the radius of signifi cant relationships 
the primary mechanism through which the person encoun-
ters societal expectations and integrates them into a revised 
sense of self. Using these two constructs, one can begin to 
clarify the process of movement from one stage to the next.
The specifi c number of stages and their link to a biologi-
cally based plan for development has been criticized. The 
stages of life unfold in a cultural context. For example, in 
some societies, the transition from childhood to adulthood 
is swift, leaving little time or expectation for identity explo-
ration. In many traditional societies, parents choose one’s 
marital partner, there are few occupational choices, and one 
is guided toward one’s vocation from an early age. Thus, 
although there is always a biological period of pubescence 
that marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, 
there may be little justifi cation for two stages of adolescence 
when the identity formation process is societally constrained 
(Thomas, 1999). In contrast, in our highly technological 
society, adolescence appears to be extended for some, espe-
cially as the age at fi rst marriage is delayed and the complex-
ity of preparing for and entering the labor market increases. 
As a refl ection of this extension of modern adolescence, we 
have treated the period from puberty through about age 24 
as two stages rather than one, each with its own psychosocial 
crisis and developmental tasks.
Along this same line of criticism, some scholars have 
taken a more differentiated view of the stages of adulthood 
and later life. In later life, health status, life circumstances, 
and culture interact to produce increasing variation in life 
stories. Distinctions are made between people of the same 
chronological age who are referred to as the “young-old” and 
the “old-old” depending upon their health status and their 
capacity to manage tasks of daily life (Deeg, Kardaun, & 
Fozard, 1996; Poon & Harrington, 2006).
In other research, distinctions are made on the basis of 
chronological age. For example, Leonard Poon has written 
extensively about the differences between centenarians (peo-
ple who are 100 or more), octogenarians (people in their 80s), 
and sexagenarians (people in their 60s) (Martin, Poon, Kim, & 
Johnson, 1996). Each cohort of older adults has been exposed 
to different historical crises, educational, health, and occupa-
tional opportunities, and shifting societal values. Therefore, it 
is likely that the normative patterns used to describe develop-
ment in adulthood and later life will become dated and need 
reexamination as each younger cohort enters later adulthood 
and elderhood (Siegler, Poon, Madden, & Welsh, 1996).
We have addressed this concern in part by extending the 
traditional psychosocial stage approach to adulthood from 
three stages to four, adding a period called elderhood. In the 
chapters on adulthood, we also address differences in life-
style and life course that are attributable to historical and 
cultural trends. Nevertheless, the increasing life expectancy, 
accompanied by a longer period of healthy later life and the 
elaboration of lifestyles, makes it diffi cult to chart a norma-
tive life course from early adulthood into late life.
In this book, you will also read about the important 
developmental issues of the prenatal period—a stage that

of factors such as genetic differences in physical growth and 
sexual maturation, temperament, quality of parenting, access 
to resources, and exposure to stressors. Once a person is fully 
engaged in all the tasks of a new period of life, a new stage of 
life has begun. The person’s energy, motivation, and concerns 
about self and others are directed toward new goals, and the 
expectations others have for the person’s level of function-
ing shift. Just as we no longer applaud the 4-year-old for the 
ability to crawl, we no longer applaud the 30-year-old for

grated into the behavior of the next stage of development.
How can you tell when stage change has occurred? The 
resolution of the psychosocial crisis of a previous stage pro-
vides the ego strengths and skill acquisition needed to face 
the challenges and expectations of the next stage. The order 
in which work on each developmental task begins and the 
rate of skill development or task achievement differ from 
person to person. These differences may be due to a host

of the crisis at each stage determines one’s coping resources, 
with a positive resolution contributing to ego strengths and 
a negative resolution contributing to core pathologies.
 4. Each person is part of an expanding network of signifi -
cant relationships that convey society’s expectations and 
demands. These relationships also provide encourage-
ment in the face of challenges.
 5. Development will be optimal if a person can create new 
behaviors and relationships as a result of skill acquisi-
tion and successful crisis resolution during each stage of 
growth. Lack of development and core pathologies result 
from tendencies that restrict behavior (especially social 
behavior) in general and new behavior in particular. The 
mechanisms for positive and negative development are 
diagrammed in Figure 3.6.
the ability to hold a steady job. Evidence of a stage change 
can be marked by new preoccupations and plans, new wor-
ries, and a new approach to building and maintaining rela-
tionships. A wonderful aspect of human development is the 
continuing redirection of energy to new ambitions, building 
upon the satisfactions of prior achievements.
At the beginning of this chapter, we introduced three ques-
tions one must ask in order to understand a theory. Let us now 
answer these questions with respect to psychosocial theory:
Which phenomena is the theory trying to explain? Psycho-
social theory attempts to explain human development 
across the life span—especially patterned changes in 
self-concept development, which are refl ected in self- 
understanding, identity formation, social relationships, 
and worldview.
What assumptions does the theory make? Human develop-
ment is a product of three interacting factors: biological 
maturation, the interaction between individuals and social 
groups, and the contributions that individuals make to 
their own psychological growth. 
The theory makes the following fi ve assumptions:
 1. Growth occurs at every period of life, from conception 
through elderhood.
 2. Individual lives show continuity and change as they 
progress through time.
 3. In order to understand behavior, one must consider the 
integration of cognitive, physical, social, and emotional 
competences, since these domains infl uence one another.
 4. Every person’s behavior must be analyzed in the context 
of relevant settings and personal relationships.
 5. People contribute actively to their own development.
What does the theory predict?
 1. There are 11 stages of development, which emerge in an 
ordered sequence. Issues of later stages can be previewed 
at an earlier time, but each issue has its period of ascen-
dance. It takes the entire life span, from the prenatal 
period through elderhood, for all aspects of the person’s 
potential to be realized.
 2. Developmental tasks are dictated by the interaction of 
the biological, psychological, and societal systems during 
each stage.
 3. A normal crisis arises at each stage of development, and a 
central process operates to resolve this crisis. The resolution

Chapter Summary
Objective 1. To explain the rationale for using 
psychosocial theory as an organizing framework for 
the study of human development.
Psychosocial theory offers a life-span view in which develop-
ment is a product of the interactions between individuals and 
their social environments. The needs and goals of both the 
individual and society must be considered in conceptualizing 
human development. Predictability is found in the sequence 
of psychosocial stages, the central process involved in the res-
olution of the psychosocial crisis at each stage, and the radius 
of signifi cant relationships. Individuality is expressed in the 
achievement of the developmental tasks, the balance of the 
positive and negative poles of each psychosocial crisis and

development over the life span, highlighting human strengths 
and vulnerabilities, and predictable shifts in worldview and 
self-understanding at each stage. The theory offers a frame-
work for considering the ongoing interaction of individuals 
and their societies, pointing to the interconnections of people 
at various stages of life. The theory has been criticized for 
its lack of clarity about the mechanisms that explain change 
from one stage to the next. The psychosocial crises have been 
criticized as overemphasizing values of individuality as com-
pared to values of connection and interdependence.
As You Read on …
Each chapter of this text, from Chapter 4 through 14, is 
devoted to one life stage. Chapter 15 covers topics related to 
death and bereavement across the life span. With the excep-
tion of Chapter 4, on pregnancy and prenatal development, 
each life-stage chapter starts with a discussion of the devel-
opmental tasks of that life stage. By tracing developments in 
physical growth, emotional growth, intellectual skills, social 
relationships, and self-understanding, you can recognize the 
interrelationships among all of these dimensions during each 
period of life.
In the second section of each chapter, the psychosocial 
crisis of that life stage is described, accounting for the tension 
by examining the individual’s needs and personal resources 
in light of the dominant societal expectations. In addition to 
defi ning the crisis, we conceptualize the central process by 
which it is resolved. The resolution of the crisis at each stage 
is tied to new ego strengths and new core pathologies.
At the end of each chapter, we draw on the material we 
have discussed to analyze a topic that is of persistent concern 
to our society. These topics are controversial, and they may 
generate sentiment as they deepen understanding. We intend 
these sections to stimulate the application of developmental 
principles to real-world concerns.
Take a moment to study the table on the front leaf of the 
book. You can use this table as a guide to the major themes 
of the text. It may help you to see the connections among the 
topics in a chapter or to trace threads of continuity over several 
periods of life. You may also use this table in constructing a life 
map for yourself, which will reveal the levels of tension and the 
major psychosocial factors that are currently affecting your self-
concept and your relationships with others.
the resulting worldview, and in the style and resources for 
coping that a person brings to each new life challenge.
Connectivity is achieved in the way the person learns to 
relate in a radius of signifi cant others who make demands, 
convey social expectations, and offer social rewards. Over 
time, the person becomes engaged in increasingly complex 
social groups and institutions. A person’s worldview at a par-
ticular age is a product of past identifi cations and the resolu-
tion of previous psychosocial crises, contemporary pressures 
and opportunities, and hopes for the future. In our society, 
there is great diversity in the outcomes of this psychosocial 
process and in the transmission of social expectations from 
one generation of adults to the next generation of children.
Objective 2. To defi ne the six basic concepts of 
psychosocial theory.  
Psychosocial theory accounts for systematic change over the life 
span through six basic concepts: (1) stages of development, (2) 
developmental tasks, (3) psychosocial crises, (4) a central pro-
cess for resolving the crisis at each stage, (5) a radiating network 
of signifi cant relationships, and (6) coping—the new behavior 
people generate to meet new challenges.
The basic concepts of psychosocial theory provide the frame-
work for analyzing development across 11 life stages from the 
prenatal period through elderhood. Development is viewed as a 
building process that incorporates the six constructs of psycho-
social theory. The structure grows larger as the radius of signifi -
cant relationships expands, and coping strategies become more 
varied and complex as the developmental tasks of each stage are 
mastered and become available to face the challenges and psy-
chosocial crisis of the next stage of life.
Objective 3. To evaluate psychosocial theory, pointing 
out its strengths and weaknesses.
Psychosocial theory provides a broad, integrative con-
text within which to study life-span development. The 
strengths and weaknesses of the theory are summarized in 
Table 3.6. The theory provides insights into the direction of

CHAPTER 3 Psychosocial Theory
Based on your understanding of psychosocial theory, con-
sider the following questions:
 1. What are the essential features of a scientifi c theory? How 
well does psychosocial theory meet the criteria for a sci-
entifi c theory?
 2. What is the focus or range of applicability of psychoso-
cial theory? What is this theory about?
 3. What role does psychosocial theory give to biological 
maturation and experience in guiding development? 
How do these factors interact?
 4. How do the concepts of psychosocial theory help ex-
plain how a person moves from one stage of life to the 
next?
 5. What is coping? How does it fi t into the process of de-
velopment over the life course? Can you describe an ex-
ample of your own coping behavior as you faced a new 
or demanding situation in the past few months?
 6. How might people at different psychosocial stages differ 
in the ways they are affected by a similar stressor such as 
unemployment or death of a parent?

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
WHEN DOES AN individual’s life story begin? At birth? 
At conception? At the births of his parents? At the births 
of her grandparents? We are each linked back in time, 
through a lifeline comprising our ancestry, culture, and 
gen etic makeup. This chapter begins the story of develop-
ment at the molecular level of genes and chromosomes, 
moves to the physical maturation of the fetus during the 
prenatal period, and then expands the view of early de-
velopment by considering the psychosocial, interpersonal, 
and cultural contexts of the period of pregnancy.
Genetics and Development
Objective 1. To describe the biochemical basis 
of genetic information and the process through 
which it is transmitted from one generation to the 
next.
Variability, which is so essential for human survival, is guar-
anteed, in part, by the complexity of the human genome (all 
the genetic material in the chromosomes of a human being) 
and the mechanisms for genetic inheritance. In this section, 
we briefl y review the biology of genetics and the laws that 
govern the transmission of genetic information from one 
generation to the next. As parents, teachers, and human ser-
vice professionals, we are encouraged to value and respond 
to human diversity. The growing knowledge about human 
genetics provides a foundation for appreciating the biologi-
cal basis of this diversity. An excellent source of information 
and links about the results, ethics, and future directions of 
the human genome project can be found on the Human 
Genome Project website sponsored by the U.S. Department 
of Energy.
Genes and Chromosomes as 
Sources of Genetic Information
Genetic information links each new person to the human 
species in general and also to a specific genetic ancestry. 
When we discuss inherited characteristics, we are really 
referring to two different kinds of heredity. The fi rst includes 
all the genetic information that comes to us as members 
of the human species. Most inherited genetic information 
is shared by all human beings, such as patterns of motor 
behavior (e.g., walking upright), brain size, and body struc-
ture, including the proportional size of the head, torso, and 
limbs. Two of the most relevant of these species-related char-
acteristics are the readiness to learn and the inclination to 
participate in social interaction.
Genetic factors guide the tempo of growth and the 
emergence of individual characteristics. As the human 
fetus grows, sensory and motor competencies emerge. 
The psychosocial environment provides both resources 
for and challenges to healthy development. Cultural atti-
tudes toward pregnancy and childbirth, poverty and the 
associated stressors, support from the child’s father and 
other signifi cant family members, maternal nutrition, and 
exposure to toxins or drugs are among the factors that 
affect fetal growth.
 1. To describe the biochemical basis of genetic 
information and the process through which it is 
transmitted from one generation to the next.
 2. To identify the contributions of genetic factors to 
individuality through their role in controlling the rate 
of development, their contributions to individual 
traits, and the genetic sources of abnormalities.
 3. To trace fetal development through three trimesters of 
pregnancy, including an understanding of critical periods 
when normal fetal development can be disrupted.
 4. To describe the birth process and factors that 
contribute to infant mortality.
 5. To analyze the reciprocity between the pregnant 
woman and the developing fetus, focusing on 
ways in which pregnancy affects a childbearing 
woman and expectant father and on basic 
infl uences on fetal growth, such as maternal 
age, drug use, nutrition, and environmental 
toxins.
 6. To examine the impact of culture on pregnancy and 
childbirth.
 7. To analyze abortion from a psychosocial perspective, 
including the legal context, its social and emotional 
impact on women, and men’s views.

information are continuously interacting to influence the 
functions of the cells (U.S. Department of Energy, 2003).
In each chromosome pair, one chromosome comes from 
the father and one from the mother. The chromosome pairs 
differ in size. In 22 pairs of chromosomes, both members 
are similar in shape and size. They also contain the same 
kinds of genes. The 23rd pair of chromosomes is a different 
story: Female humans have two X chromosomes, and male 
humans have one X and one Y chromosome. The X and Y 
notation is used because these chromosomes differ in shape 
and size (the X chromosome is longer than the Y chromo-
some). There are very few similarities in the genes present on 
the X and Y chromosomes.
One common misconception is that there is one gene for 
each specifi c trait such as sociability, intelligence, or crimi-
nality. Single genes do not determine most human behav-
iors (McGuffi n, Riley, & Plomin, 2001). Only certain rare 
disorders such as Huntington’s disease have a simple mode 
of transmission in which a specific mutation confers the 
certainty of developing the disorder. Most types of behav-
ior have no such clear-cut pattern and depend on interplay 
between environmental factors and multiple genes (p. 1232).
The Laws of Heredity
The laws that govern the process by which genetic informa-
tion is transmitted from parent to offspring were discovered 
by Gregor Mendel (1866), a monk who studied the inherited 
characteristics of plants, particularly garden peas. His laws 
were formulated long before the discovery of the biochemi-
cal substances that compose genes and chromosomes.
The second kind of heredity consists of characteristics that 
have been transmitted through a specifi c ancestry. Hair color, 
skin color, blood group, and height result from the genetic 
information passed on from one generation to the next. Given 
all the shared information that is carried in the genome, these 
individual differences amount to only 0.1% of all DNA (McGuffi n, 
Riley, & Plomin, 2001). Thus, all the ways in which individu-
als differ genetically from one another is accounted for by a 
very small percentage of the information carried in the genes.
Chromosomes, the long, thin strands of genetic mate-
rial located in the cell nucleus, are formed from chains of 
DNA molecules (see Figure 4.1). Most single genes are com-
posed of a piece of DNA that codes for the production of 
one protein and occupies a specifi c place on a chromosome. 
The recent estimate based on genome mapping places the 
number of functional genes between 20,000 and 25,000, or 
about 2% of the entire genome (U.S. Department of Energy 
Offi ce of Science, 2004).
The important work of the genes is to produce proteins, 
which then guide cellular formation and functioning. Pro-
teins, which are large, complex molecules comprised of 
amino acids, perform most life functions and make up the 
majority of cellular structures. The constellation of all pro-
teins in a cell is called its proteome. Unlike the relatively 
unchanging genome, the dynamic proteome changes from 
minute to minute in response to tens of thousands of intra- 
and extracellular environmental signals. A protein’s chemis-
try and behavior are specifi ed by the gene sequence and by 
the number and identities of other proteins made in the same 
cell at the same time and with which it associates and reacts. 
Therefore, at the cellular level, genetic and environmental

The sides of this ladder comprise alternating units of sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate, and its rungs are made up of pairs 
of  nitrogen bases (so named because they contain the element nitrogen as well as hydrogen and carbon). The four nitrogen 
bases involved are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). They are often referred to by their initial letters, 
and A, G, C, and T are called the genetic alphabet.

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
dominates is called the dominant allele. The other allele that is 
present, but whose characteristic is masked by the dominant 
allele, is called the recessive allele. Eye color is the result of a 
dominance relation. The allele for brown eyes (B) is domi-
nant over the allele for blue eyes (b). The probability that the 
recessive trait of blue eyes will emerge in the offspring of two 
heterozygous parents is illustrated in Figure 4.2. The possible 
combinations of the gene related to brown or blue eye color 
are BB, Bb, bB, and bb. Only one combination, bb, which 
will occur on the average in only 25% of the offspring, results 
in a child with blue eyes. The other three genotypes result in 
one phenotype—brown eyes.
Adding to the complexity of the laws of heredity are the 
processes of epigenetics, activities at the biochemical level that 
alter gene expression but do not alter the genome itself. Two of 
these processes are imprinting and epigenetic marks. Imprint-
ing is a condition in which genes from either the mother or the 
father are silenced. At present, 156 imprinted genes have been 
identifi ed (Luedi et al., 2007). Under conditions of imprinting, 
the genes from both parents are present on the DNA strands 
and are copied by the RNA but only the genes from one parent 
Alleles
In the 22 pairs of identical chromosomes, each gene has at 
least two possible states or conditions, one on each chromo-
some in the pair. These alternative states are called alleles. 
Whatever the allelic state of the gene from one parent, the 
other parent’s allele for that gene may be either the same 
or different. If both alleles are the same, the gene is said 
to be homozygous. If the alleles are different, the gene is 
heterozygous.
Genotype and Phenotype
The genetic information about a trait is called the genotype 
(e.g., the genetic information that encodes skin color). The 
observed characteristic (e.g., one’s actual skin color) is called 
the phenotype. The expression, “There is more here than 
meets the eye,” suggests the difference between genotype and 
phenotype. Genotype can infl uence phenotype in three differ-
ent ways. First, the differences in the allelic states of several 
genes sometimes result in a cumulative relation, in which 
more than one pair of alleles infl uences the trait. An example 
of this kind of relation is the genetic contribution to height. 
A person whose alleles of different genes are mostly for tall-
ness will be tall; a person who receives many alleles of different 
genes for shortness will be short. Most people receive a mix of 
alleles for both tallness and shortness and are of average height.
Second, the differences between alleles may result in 
codominance, in which both genes are expressed in the new 
cell. An example of codominance is the AB blood type, which 
results from the joining of an A blood type allele from one 
parent and a B blood type allele from the other parent. This 
blood type is not a mixture of A and B, nor is A subordinate 
to B or B to A; instead, a distinct blood type, AB, is formed.
Third, differences in the allele states of a gene may result in 
a dominance relation. Dominance means that if one allele is 
present, its characteristic is predominantly observed whether 
the other allele of the pair is the same or not. The allele that

small, and few exclusively Y-linked traits have been identi-
fi ed. One of the few key genes that has been located on the 
Y chromosome is SRY, which is responsible for setting into 
motion the differentiation of the testes during embryonic 
development. Once the testes are formed, they begin to pro-
duce hormones that account for further differentiation of the 
male reproductive system.
Sex-linked traits that are carried on the X chromosome 
are more likely to be observed in male offspring than in 
female offspring, because male children do not have a sec-
ond X chromosome to offset the effects of an X-linked trait. 
Hemophilia A, the most common type of hemophilia, is an 
example of such a sex-linked trait. Individuals with hemo-
philia lack a specifi c blood protein that causes their blood 
to clot after receiving a wound (ADAM, 2004). The allele for 
hemophilia is a recessive trait carried on the X chromosome; 
however, it is most likely to affect men (see Figure 4.4). 
Half (50%) of the male offspring of female carriers have the 
disease, and 50% of their female offspring are carriers. All 
female children of a man with hemophilia are carriers of the 
trait. This disease affects approximately 1 in 5,000 men.
Other genes are expressed exclusively in one sex but are 
not found on the sex chromosomes per se. For example, the 
are used in making proteins. As a result, even though there 
are two different alleles in the genotype, only the mother’s or 
the father’s allele is expressed in the phenotype. There is an 
assumed adaptive advantage to having some genetic informa-
tion silenced selectively depending on its origin from the pater-
nal or maternal genetic source, but the mechanisms that might 
explain or account for this advantage are not yet clear. Many 
developmental disorders and diseases are linked to imprinted 
genes, either as a result of the expression of a mutation or reces-
sive condition that is not balanced by the silenced allele, or 
as a result of some environmental condition that removes the 
imprinting and thereby increases the impact of the gene. Future 
study of imprinted genes is expected to contribute signifi cantly 
to our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis of dis-
ease (Jirtle & Weidman, 2007).
Epigenetic marks are chemicals that sit on top of the 
genes and instruct them to switch on or off (Figure 4.3). 
These marks can be influenced by environmental factors 
such as overabundant eating, smoking cigarettes at an early 
age, or having access to particular vitamins during the pre-
natal period. When the epigenetic marks are altered, the 
impact is seen in subsequent generations. For example, 
researchers studied the long-term impact of famine and feast 
in a small Swedish community. They found that the children 
and grandchildren of those children who had experienced 
periods of near starvation followed by a year of overeating 
had substantially shorter lives than the offspring of those 
who experienced only the famine, but no overeating. In 
contrast to the slow process of genetic modifi cation through 
natural selection, epigenetic studies show how exposure to 
critical environmental factors at key periods of life can pre-
dispose one’s children and grandchildren to genetically based 
vulnerabilities. These environmental infl uences are distinct 
from the prenatal exposure of the fetus to malnutrition or 
toxins, discussed later in this chapter, which may result in 
developmental delay or disruption. Epigenetic studies link 
developmentally time-sensitive exposure to environmental 
conditions to the gene expression in one or more generations 
of offspring (Pembrey, Bygren et al., 2006; Pembrey, 2008).
Sex-Linked Characteristics
Certain genetic characteristics are said to be sex linked 
because the gene for the specifi c characteristic is found on 
the sex chromosomes (X and Y). The female ova carry only 
X chromosomes. Half of the male sperm carry Y chromo-
somes, and half carry X chromosomes. Male children can 
be produced only when a sperm carrying a Y chromosome 
fertilizes an egg, and the result is an XY combination in the 
23rd chromosome pair. All sperm carrying X chromosomes 
will produce female children.
Sex-linked traits are more likely to be observed in male 
offspring, even though they may be present in the genotype 
of female offspring. You will understand this more readily if 
you visualize the XY chromosome pair. When a trait is car-
ried on the Y chromosome, it will be inherited and transmit-
ted only by male offspring, because only male offspring have 
the Y chromosome. Interestingly, the Y chromosome is quite

conditions such as a rich diet following a period of 
starvation can alter gene expression. These changes can 
turn genes on or off and may affect what gets passed down 
to succeeding generations.

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
in which genetic determinants contribute to individual vari-
ability are rate of development, individual traits, and abnormal 
development.
Genetic Determinants of the Rate of 
Development
Genes regulate the rate and sequence of maturation. The 
concept of an epigenetic plan for growth and development 
is based on the assumption that a genetically guided system 
promotes or restricts the growth of cells over the life span. 
Genetic factors have been found to play a role in behavioral 
development, including the onset of various levels of reason-
ing, language, and social orientation.
Evidence for the role of genetics in guiding the rate and 
sequence of development has been provided by studies 
of identical twins (who have the same genotype). The rates 
at which identical twins develop are highly correlated, even 
when those twins are reared apart. A number of characteris-
tics—including the timing of the acquisition of motor skills, 
personality development, changes in intellectual capacity 
among aged twins, and the timing of physical maturation—
show a strong genetic infl uence (Bouchard & Pederson, 1999).
Genes can be viewed as internal regulators that set the 
pace for maturation. They signal the onset of significant 
developmental changes throughout life, such as growth 
spurts, the eruption of teeth, puberty, and menopause. They 
also appear to set the limits of the life span. A small num-
ber of genes infl uence how many times the cells of a spe-
cifi c organism can divide and replicate. Research on three 
different animal species—fruit fl ies, worms, and mice—has 
shown that when the most long-lived of a species are bred, 
the offspring live longer than average (Barinaga, 1991).
Differences in the rate of development contribute to our 
understanding of psychosocial growth. Differences in age at 
crawling or walking, for example, bring children into contact 
with new aspects of their environments and provide them 
with changing capacities at different chronological ages. 
Thus, the genetic processes that regulate readiness for cer-
tain kinds of growth and vulnerabilities to particular kinds 
of stress contribute to systematic differences among indi-
viduals. For example, adult expectations for the accomplish-
ment of such specifi c tasks as toilet training, getting dressed 
without help, and learning to write interact with the child’s 
developmental level. Disappointment may be conveyed to 
children who are not able to perform these tasks until later 
in the developmental spectrum, and pride and approval may 
be conveyed to developmentally accelerated children.
Genetic Determinants of Individual Traits
Genes contain specific information about a wide range of 
human characteristics, from eye color and height to the abil-
ity to taste a particular substance called phenylthiocarba-
mide (which to tasters is bitter, but to nontasters has no taste 
at all). Some characteristics are controlled by a single gene. 
However, most significant characteristics, such as height, 
genes for male beard development and female breast devel-
opment are not located on the sex chromosomes. However, 
these characteristics will emerge only in the presence of the 
appropriate hormonal environment, which is directed by the 
sex chromosomes.
Genetic Sources of Individual 
Differences
Objective 2. To identify the contributions of genetic 
factors to individuality through their role in controlling 
the rate of development, their contributions to individual 
traits, and the genetic sources of abnormalities.
The study of genetics reveals that individual variability 
is due to the combination of the many variations in envi-
ronment and experience that confront a growing person 
and the variability built into the biological mechanisms of 
heredity. Each adult couple has the potential for producing 
a great variety of genetically distinct children. Three areas

FIGURE 4.4 Sex-Linked Inheritance of Hemophilia. The allele 
for hemophilia is carried on the X chromosome. If the allele 
is either heterozygous or homozygous for the dominant 
trait (normal blood clotting), a female child will have normal 
blood-clotting capabilities. Only if she is homozygous 
for the recessive trait (a very rare occurrence) will she be 
hemophilic. A male child, on the other hand, has only 
one allele for the clotting gene, which he inherits from 
his mother. If that allele is dominant, his blood will clot 
normally, but if it is recessive, he will be hemophilic.

to chromosomal abnormalities in the fertilized zygotes (the 
developing organism formed from the father’s sperm and the 
mother’s egg).
Of those infants who survive the neonatal period, an esti-
mated 3% to 5% of newborns have one or more major recog-
nizable anomalies (Cunningham et al., 2001). The incidence 
of anomalies increases to 6% to 7% as some disorders are 
diagnosed later in childhood. Some birth defects are linked 
to a specific chromosome or to a single gene. Other birth 
defects are linked solely to environmental factors, such 
as drugs, medications, and fetal and maternal infections. 
Most malformations, however, result from the interaction of 
genetic vulnerabilities and environmental hazards, or are of 
unknown origin (Moore & Persaud, 2003).
Examples of genetic and chromosomal disorders are 
listed in Table 4.1. The disorders are presented in two broad 
categories: those associated with specific genes and those 
associated with chromosomal abnormalities. Within those 
categories, some disorders are found on 1 of the 22 pairs of 
autosomal chromosomes (chromosomes other than the sex 
chromosomes), and others are on one of the sex chromo-
somes. There are more than 1,100 genes for which at least one 
disease-related mutation or alternate allele has been identifi ed 
using the map-based approach to gene discovery. However, 
many diseases are thought to involve multiple genes in some 
form of interaction. Moreover, many diseases that have an 
identifi ed genetic basis—such as hypertension, schizophrenia, 
or coronary artery disease—are expressed in certain environ-
ments, including the prenatal environment, and not in others 
(Peltonen & McKusick, 2001; Fox, Hane, & Pine, 2007).
Certain genetic diseases are linked directly to our ances-
try; therefore, their incidence is higher in certain popula-
tions than in others (National Institutes of Health, 2007). For 
example, the incidence of Tay-Sachs disease is especially fre-
quent in Jews who settled in Eastern Europe. One in every 
27 Jews in the United States carries the gene. Thalassemia, 
a disease involving faulty production of hemoglobin (which 
carries oxygen in the blood), is found most often in people 
of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Southeast Asian ori-
gins. The variety of genetic abnormalities serves to broaden 
the range of individual variability. Many of these irregularities 
pose a challenge both to the adaptive capacities of the affected 
person and to the caregiving capacities of the adults involved.
Genetic Technology and 
Psychosocial Evolution
Psychosocial evolution has typically been differentiated 
from biological evolution in that change is accomplished by 
social mechanisms rather than incorporated in the genetic 
structure. As a result of scientific knowledge, however, 
we are entering an era when it is possible to intervene to 
infl uence the genotype. One such intervention is genetic 
 counseling. Individuals and couples with a family his-
tory of a genetic disease—or who for some other reason 
weight, blood group, skin color, and intelligence, are guided 
by the combined action of several genes. When multiple 
genes are involved in the regulation of a trait, the possibili-
ties for individual differences in that trait increase. Because 
many characteristics are regulated by multiple genes, the 
variety of human phenotypes is enormous.
Genetic factors also play a substantial role in individual 
 differences in personality (Loehlin, 1992; Plomin, 1990, 1994; 
Loehlin, 1992; Borkenau, Riemann, Angleitner, &  Spinath, 
2001). Traits such as sociability (a tendency to be  outgoing), 
inhibition (a tendency to be cautious and socially shy or 
 withdrawn), and neuroticism (a tendency to be anxious and 
emotionally sensitive) are pervasive dimensions of personality 
that appear to have strong genetic components. Research on 
the biological basis of sexual orientation suggests that genes 
may infl uence the development of the part of the brain that 
guides sexual behavior (LeVay, 1991). Identical twins are more 
likely to have the same sexual orientation than are fraternal 
twins or adoptive siblings (Bailey & Pillard, 1991, 1994). 
Even in rather specifi c areas of personality, such as political 
attitudes, aesthetic preferences, and sense of humor, identical 
twins show greater similarity than fraternal twins, even when 
the identical twins are reared apart from each other.
Extending the analysis of the impact of genetics on indi-
vidual differences, Sandra Scarr (1992) suggested at least 
three ways in which genetic factors infl uence the environ-
ment of individuals. First, most children are raised by their 
parents in environments created by their parents. Thus, chil-
dren receive both their genes and their home environment 
from a common genetic source—their parents. As an exam-
ple, a parent who is temperamentally sociable is more likely 
than a withdrawn or timid parent to have lots of people at 
the house, to enjoy the companionship of others, and there-
fore to expose the children to more companionable adults.
Second, people draw out responses from others that are 
related to their own personality characteristics. Thus, broad, 
genetically based aspects of one’s individuality will affect the 
kinds of social responses one receives from others, including 
one’s parents. 
Third, as people mature and become increasingly asser-
tive in selecting certain experiences and rejecting others, their 
own temperaments, talents, intelligence, and level of sociabil-
ity will guide the kinds of environments they select, strength-
ening certain genetic predispositions while dampening others.
Genetic Determinants of Abnormal 
Development
In addition to characteristics such as physical appearance, 
temperament, talent, and intellectual capacity, a wide vari-
ety of abnormalities, or anomalies, have a genetic cause. The 
most dramatic anomalies result in a spontaneous abortion 
of the fetus early in the pregnancy. Approximately 15% to 
20% of recognized pregnancies end in first-term sponta-
neous abortion (Geyman, Oliver, & Sullivan, 1999). The 
majority of these early-term spontaneous abortions are due

is used to help identify criminal suspects; and, most 
recently, cloning from an adult mammal are some of the 
topics that are raising new ethical concerns. There is a gen-
eral consensus that the use of gene therapy to treat serious 
diseases such as cystic fi brosis or cancer is  ethical. There 
is less agreement about the use of intervention to alter 
the genetic code at the level of the zygote or to attempt 
to  introduce genes intended to enhance aspects of normal 
development in humans. Even the advances in  identifying 
genetic markers for specific diseases can lead to ethical 
dilemmas. There are no federal laws in the United States 
relating to genetic discrimination in individual insur-
ance coverage or to genetic discrimination in the work-
place. Concerns have been raised that insurers will use 
genetic information to deny or cancel policies based on 
genetic tests or that employers could use information from 
genetic tests to screen employee applicants. Individuals 
worry about the possibility of transmitting a genetic disease 
to their  children—can have a blood test to identify genes 
that may result in the inherited disorder. The locations of 
the genes that account for such abnormalities as Tay-Sachs 
disease, sickle-cell anemia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 
and cystic fi brosis have been identifi ed. Couples who have 
reason to believe that they may carry genes for one of these 
diseases can be advised about the probability of having chil-
dren who may be affl icted (Medline Plus, 2010). If signifi -
cant numbers of the carriers of genetic diseases decided not 
to reproduce, the incidence of these diseases in the popula-
tion would decline over time. Thus, a psychosocial interven-
tion would modify the gene pool.

TABLE 4.1 Examples of Genetic and Chromosomal Disorders
GENETIC DISORDERS
Autosomal dominant gene
Huntington’s chorea: Rapid, jerky, involuntary movements; deterioration of muscle coordination and mental functioning. Symptoms 
 usually do not appear until age 35–50. Caused by genetic defect on chromosome 4.
Marfan’s syndrome: Elongated fi ngers; deformed chest and spine; abnormal heart. Tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules are weak.
Autosomal recessive gene
Albinism: Hair, skin, and eyes lack the pigment melanin. Often accompanied by visual problems and a susceptibility to skin cancer.
Cystic fi brosis: Certain glands do not function properly. The glands in the lining of the bronchial tubes produce excessive amounts of thick 
mucus, which leads to chronic lung infections. Failure of the pancreas to produce enzymes necessary for the breakdown of fats and their 
absorption from the intestines leads to malnutrition. Sweat glands are also affected. Often fatal by age 30. Caused by missing base pairs 
on chromosome 7.
Sickle-cell anemia: Malformation of red blood cells reduces the amount of oxygen they can carry. Results in fatigue, headaches, shortness 
of breath on exertion, pallor, jaundice, pain, and damage to kidneys, lungs, intestine, and brain.
Tay-Sachs disease: Absence of a certain enzyme results in the buildup of harmful chemicals in the brain. Results in death before age 3.
X-linked recessive gene
Color blindness: Defect of light-sensitive pigment in one or more classes of cone cells in the retina of the eye or an abnormality in or 
reduced number of cone cells themselves. The two common types are reduced discrimination of light wavelengths within the middle 
(green) and long (red) parts of the visible spectrum.
Hemophilia: Absence of a blood protein (factor VIII) reduces effectiveness of blood clotting. Severity of disorder varies. Bleeding 
episodes likely to begin in toddlerhood.
CHROMOSOMAL DISORDERS
Autosomal abnormality
Down syndrome: Additional 21st chromosome; also called trisomy 21. The excess chromosome results in physical and intellectual 
abnormalities, including IQ in the range of 30–80; distinctive facial features, heart defects, intestinal problems, hearing defects; susceptibility 
to repeated ear infections. Tendency to develop narrowing of the arteries in adulthood, with attendant increase in risk of heart disease.
Sex-chromosome abnormalities
Turner’s syndrome: Usually caused by a lack of one X chromosome in a girl; sometimes one of two X chromosomes is defective; 
occasionally some base pairs are missing on an X chromosome. These abnormalities result in defective sexual development and infertility, 
short stature, absence or retarded development of secondary sex characteristics, absence of menstruation, narrowing of the aorta, and a 
 degree of mental retardation.
Klinefelter’s syndrome: One or more extra X chromosomes in a boy. This abnormality results in defective sexual development, including 
enlarged breasts and small testes, infertility, and often mental retardation.

donor DNA is injected into an egg cell and the cell begins to 
divide, it can be implanted into a uterus. If the implant sur-
vives, it would develop into a fetus with the same DNA as 
the donor. Although there is strong public opposition to the 
cloning of humans, the procedure has been used to clone 
other mammals, and there is growing support for stem cell 
research.
Gene X Environment Interactions 
and Behavior
Accomplishments in mapping the human genome still 
leave us with critical questions about how genes and the 
environment interact to infl uence behavior. Genes cannot 
be expressed without an appropriate environment, includ-
ing the biological environment at the cellular level and the 
physical and social environments at the larger systems level. 
For example, a human being needs to breathe oxygen. If an 
infant is deprived of oxygen in the prenatal period or during 
the birth process, a genetic potential for intelligence will not 
be observed in behavior. What is more, as illustrated in the 
discussion of epigenetic marks, individuals and their envi-
ronments are in a state of dynamic interaction and change, 
each modifying the other.
Genetics and Intelligence
One area that has received considerable attention is the rela-
tive contributions of genetic and environmental factors to 
intelligence. To what extent is a person’s intelligence set by 
hereditary factors? To what extent is it a product of experi-
ence? Intelligent behavior requires the successful integration 
of both. It relies on the structure of the central nervous sys-
tem and the sense receptors, which are products of geneti-
cally guided information. However, the healthy functioning 
of these systems requires adequate nutrition, rest, and free-
dom from disease—conditions that vary with the environ-
ment. Intelligent behavior builds on experiences with diverse 
stimuli, social interactions, and schooling—all elements of 
the physical and social environment.
The infl uence of genetic factors on intelligence may be 
observed in two ways. First, specifi c genetic irregularities can 
cause degrees of mental retardation. Two examples are Down 
syndrome and Turner’s syndrome (see Table 4.1 for descrip-
tions). These and many other genetic diseases play an indis-
putable role in restricting intellectual potential.
A second approach to understanding the influence 
of genetics on intelligence is through the study of family 
relationships. Family members may be related closely or 
distantly. The closer the biological relationship, the more 
similar the genetic makeup. If intelligence is infl uenced by 
genetics, close relatives should be more similar in intelli-
gence than distant relatives. Figure 4.5 shows the degree of 
similarity found in more than 100 studies of intelligence in 
siblings at four different degrees of relationship. Similarity 
are turning down the opportunity to be tested for possi-
ble genetic diseases for fear that they will be denied health 
insurance, life insurance, or employment (U.S. Department 
of Energy, 2007).
The possibility of reproducing genetically identi-
cal clones from human tissue has stirred the conscience 
of the religious, political, and medical communities. Is it 
ethical to clone human genes so that great scholars, scien-
tists, and artists can walk the Earth again? Should cloning 
become an approved technology for coping with infertility? 
The debate about cloning has extended to include human 
stem cell research. Through a procedure called nuclear 
 transplantation, the nucleus of an egg cell, which contains 
its DNA, is removed and replaced with the DNA from an 
adult cell. If this egg, with its new DNA, undergoes cell divi-
sion and survives for several days, it produces embryonic 
stem cells. These cells have the potential to develop into any 
type of organ in the body. Thus, they can be injected in a 
person with a debilitating disease to replace dead or infected 
tissues. Because the DNA comes from the person’s own 
healthy cells, there is less risk that the body will reject these 
stem cells (NIH, 2009). This same procedure, nuclear trans-
plantation, can be used for reproductive cloning. Once the

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
regard to intelligence. Moreover, tested IQ is only one way 
of conceptualizing intelligence, a concept that is widely 
debated in the social sciences. The question of how to think 
about and study the relationship of genetics and intelli-
gence is moving into new and exciting areas of investiga-
tion (Plomin, 2004).
The Norm of Reaction
One way to conceptualize the influence of genetics on 
behavior is to view the phenotype or observed behav-
ior as a norm of reaction—that is, a pattern of possible 
phenotypes that are likely to be observed under different 
environmental conditions. This way of thinking about 
development highlights the importance of the concept of 
plasticity. Plasticity can be conceptualized as the degree 
of fl exibility or variation that can be expressed at the level 
of an organ, a capacity, or a broad, developmental trajec-
tory. Consider the example of handedness. If you are left 
handed, and you break your left hand, you can learn to 
feed yourself with your right hand. It’s not as smooth, but 
it’s possible. So handedness, which is genetically influ-
enced, is also plastic. And some people are more readily 
able to switch from one hand to the other than others; we 
call them ambidextrous. Some characteristics of personal-
ity, intelligence, and emotional response are more plastic 
than others; that is, they are more sensitive to environ-
mental stimulation or the conditions of childrearing than 
others. And some children are more malleable than oth-
ers. Whereas some children are very highly attuned to the 
social messages and childrearing practices of their parents, 
others are more resistant to parenting strategies and seem 
to grow up in tune with their own inner plan (Belsky & 
Pluess, 2009). Plasticity suggests that specifi c characteris-
tics can be modifi ed under various environmental condi-
tions, and that some individuals are more responsive to 
the impact of the environment (for better or worse) than 
others.
Figure 4.6 shows the hypothetical reaction ranges of 
three children with respect to intelligence. Child A has 
greater genetic potential for intelligence than Child B, who 
has greater potential than Child C. When all three children 
are in nonstimulating environments, their IQs develop at the 
lower end of their potential range and the differences among 
the three phenotypes are reduced. When all three children 
are in stimulating environments, their IQs develop toward 
the upper end of their potential range and the differences 
among the three phenotypes are accentuated. Each child’s 
intellectual ability can be expressed as a range of probable 
levels that are likely given the child’s genetic potential and 
the quality of the childrearing environment. The more plastic 
a characteristic, such as intelligence, the more the phenotype 
will reflect environmental variation. The more channeled 
or constrained the characteristic, such as the shape of one’s 
eyes or the length of one’s fi ngers, the less environmental 
factors will infl uence the expression of the genotype in the 
phenotype.
in intelligence increases with the degree of genetic relat-
edness. The correlation between pairs of monozygotic 
(identical) twins is .85, providing striking evidence of the 
contribution of genetics to intelligence. Fraternal, dizygotic 
(DZ) twins who share the same prenatal, home, and child-
rearing environments show much less similarity than do 
MZ twins and not much more than non-twin siblings. An 
overview of studies that have attempted to evaluate the con-
tribution of genetic factors to cognitive ability suggests that 
genetics accounts for 50% of the variance, shared environ-
mental factors for 33% of the variance, unshared environ-
mental factors for 17% of the variance, and measurement 
error for 10% of the variance in intelligence (Gottesman, 
1997). One might expect that genetic factors would play 
a smaller role in measured intelligence with age. How-
ever, the data suggest the opposite. Heritability of intel-
ligence increases with age (Plomin & Spinath, 2004). For 
example, in studies of adopted children, the correlation 
of IQ between  children and their adoptive parents drops 
to almost zero by the time the children are young adults 
(Bouchard & Pederson, 1999).
The fact that intelligence is strongly influenced by 
genetic factors does not imply that environments have no 
impact; nor that intelligence is fixed and unchangeable. 
We are just beginning to learn about the role of genes in 
the structure and functions of the brain and the ways that 
various genes are related to cognitive capacities. As we will 
discuss later in the chapter, both the prenatal and postna-
tal environments have potential impact on the developing 
nervous system. Access to adequate nutrition, exposure to 
toxins, and birth trauma can all alter the phenotype with

disruptive, and may experience more efforts on the part of 
caregivers to control or constrain their behavior. These chil-
dren with a genotype that predisposes them to be outgoing 
and active might experience high levels of distress and self-
doubt in this type of environment. In other cultures, where 
the norm is toward early independence, and encouragement 
for exploratory behavior, the inhibited infants will require 
especially sensitive and supportive caregiving in order to 
thrive. Some parents may add to their inhibited infant’s dis-
tress by rejecting these infants, conveying impatience with 
their infant’s sensitivity and perceived clinginess, as well as 
avoidant behavior.
The concept of the norm of reaction can be seen clearly 
in the outlook for children with Down syndrome (Cody & 
Some genotypes fl ourish under certain conditions but not 
others. For example, consider the genotype for behavioral 
inhibition (Fox, Hane, & Pine, 2007). Behaviorally inhibited 
children are likely to stop their activity and seek proximity to 
their caregiver when faced with novel stimuli. Whereas some 
children have a genotype for intense inhibition, others have 
a genotype for low levels of inhibition. They are more active, 
outgoing, and exploratory, and less disrupted or distressed 
by novelty. In cultures where children are expected to learn 
through observation and imitation, and where close physi-
cal contact between caregivers and mothers is the norm, 
one might expect the behaviorally inhibited children to be 
viewed as more normal and to thrive. The outgoing, explor-
atory, uninhibited children may be perceived as difficult, 
Even though children with Down 
syndrome have mild to moderate 
disabilities, they also have many 
talents and abilities. They benefi t 
enormously from early intervention 
services, including physical, speech, 
and developmental therapies.

and benefi t from social interactions 
with their typically developing peers.

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
Fertilization
One normal ejaculation contains several hundred million 
sperm. This large number is necessary to ensure  fertilization, 
because most sperm die on the way through the vagina and 
the uterus. Each microscopic sperm is composed of a pointed 
head and a tail. The head contains the genetic material nec-
essary for reproduction. The tail moves like a whip as the 
sperm swims through the cervix and uterus and into the fal-
lopian tubes. Swimming at the rate of 1 inch every 8 minutes, 
sperm may reach the egg in as little as 30 minutes, but the 
journey usually takes about 6 hours; sperm can stay alive in 
the uterus for up to 5 days.
In contrast to a man, who produces billions of sperm in 
a lifetime, a woman ordinarily releases just one ovum, or 
egg, each month, midway through the menstrual cycle. In a 
lifetime of approximately 40 fertile years, during which she 
can be expected to have two children, the average woman 
releases approximately 450 eggs. Each woman is born with 
her complete supply of eggs.
Like the sperm, the ovum is a single cell that contains 
genetic material. In comparison with body cells, the ovum 
is quite large (0.12 millimeters), about the size of the period 
at the end of this sentence. When the ovum is mature, it is 
encased in a sac of fl uid and fl oats to the surface of the ovary. 
The sac ruptures and releases the ovum into one of the two 
fallopian tubes. Millions of feathery, hair-like structures in 
the fallopian tube sweep around the ovum and gently move 
it toward the uterus.
Only one sperm can enter the egg. As the first sperm 
passes through the egg’s cell membrane, a rapid change in 
the membrane’s chemistry effectively locks out other sperm. 
If the ovum is not fertilized within the fi rst 24 hours of its 
maturity, it begins to disintegrate and is shed along with the 
lining of the uterus in the next menstrual period.
Once inside the egg cell, the sperm loses its tail, and the 
head becomes a normal cell nucleus. The egg cell also goes 
Kamphaus, 1999; Laws, Byrne, & Buckley, 2000). This con-
dition, which occurs in 1 of every 700 live births, is the most 
common genetic cause of mental retardation in the United 
States. In the early part of the 20th century, children born 
with Down syndrome had a life expectancy of 9 years. 
Today, the life expectancy of a child with Down syndrome 
is 30 years, and 25% of individuals with Down syndrome 
live to age 50. Medical care, early and constant educational 
intervention, physical therapy, and a nurturing home envi-
ronment have signifi cant positive results for children with 
Down syndrome. Participation in a mainstreamed classroom 
environment has been shown to have signifi cant benefi ts for 
these children’s vocabulary, grammar, and certain memory 
skills. Under optimal conditions, individuals with Down 
syndrome are able to achieve a moderate degree of indepen-
dence and to participate actively in the life of their schools, 
communities, and families. Although Down syndrome con-
strains the probable phenotype, there is a norm of reaction 
that results from a child’s exposure to various degrees of 
environmental support. Thus, the norm of reaction depends 
on the specifi c dynamic interaction of a given genotype in a 
particular environment.
Normal Fetal Development
Objective 3. To trace fetal development through three 
trimesters of pregnancy, including an understanding of 
critical periods when normal fetal development can be 
disrupted.
Genetic information guides the production of proteins, the 
formation of body structures, and their interrelated func-
tions. The following description takes us from the cellular 
level of fertilization to the elaboration of physical and sen-
sory capacities over the three trimesters of pregnancy.
When the sperm breaks through 
the lining of the egg, a biochemi-
cal reaction takes place that 
prevents other sperm from 
entering the cell.

Infertility and Alternative Means of 
Reproduction
Infertility, or the inability to conceive, can result from prob-
lems in the reproductive system of the man, the woman, or 
both. The risk of infertility increases with age and is asso-
ciated with exposure to toxins, including cigarette smoke, 
pesticides, chemical solvents, and fumes from anesthesia 
(Sinclair & Pressinger, 2001). Research on the emotional 
impact of infertility suggests that it is a major source of 
stress. The discovery of infertility may force a couple to reas-
sess the meaning and purpose of their marriage. It may raise 
doubts in the couple about their self-worth; it often disrupts 
their satisfaction with their sexual relationship; and it often 
isolates them because of the diffi culty of discussing this per-
sonal family problem with others (Haynes & Miller, 2003).
I have been trying to conceive for 2 years. Each month, at 
ovulation, I am so sure this will be “the month.” And then, 
like clockwork, my period comes and I spend at least a day 
feeling depressed. Sex has even become a chore for both me 
and my partner. This whole infertility roller coaster is defi -
nitely hurting our relationship and sex life. Well-meaning 
friends tell me it will happen when the time is right, but I 
don’t know how to help our relationship in the meantime. 
(Peterson, 2001)
When couples perceive similar levels of distress about 
their infertility and are able to communicate with each 
other about it, they report higher levels of marital satisfac-
tion (Peterson, Newton, & Rosen, 2003). However, it is not 
uncommon for husbands and wives to have different reac-
tions to infertility and different levels of distress about it, 
which results in more strained marital relationships. The 
stressors associated with infertility may go on over a long 
period. Some couples undergo fertility treatments for years 
through a final change in preparation for fertilization. The 
gametes (egg and sperm cells) contain only one of each chro-
mosome, rather than the full set of 23 pairs. When the cell 
nuclei of the sperm and the ovum meet in the egg cytoplasm, 
their separate chromosomal material is integrated into a single 
set of 23 pairs of chromosomes. At this moment, all the infor-
mation necessary to activate growth is contained in a single cell.
Twins
The cell produced when the sperm has fertilized the egg is 
referred to as a zygote. The zygote travels down the fallopian 
tube and divides as it travels toward the uterus without grow-
ing larger. After about a week, this mass of cells implants in 
the uterus. Occasionally, this growing mass of cells divides 
in two and separates, forming two individuals with the same 
chromosomal composition. These individuals are referred 
to as monozygotic (MZ) twins, because they come from a 
single zygote. They are always of the same sex, and are strik-
ingly similar in physical appearance, a characteristic leading 
to the alternative term identical twins.
Fraternal twins occur as a result of multiple ovulations 
in the same cycle. Each egg develops separately in the ovary, 
is shed and fertilized individually, and develops separately in 
the uterus. The result is dizygotic (DZ) twins—that is, two-
egg twins. Actually, these twins are littermates and may be of 
different sexes. Genetically, they bear no more resemblance 
to one another than other children of the same parents. 
However, they share the same prenatal environment and a 
more common parenting environment than do most siblings 
who are born one or more years apart. Approximately 33 in 
1,000 live births are multiple births, most of them twins. The 
ratio of multiple births is notably higher among mothers over 
age 30, possibly because older mothers are more likely to be 
using some type of fertility therapy (Martin et al., 2003).
Identical twins have the same geno-
type; fraternal twins are no more 
alike genetically than other siblings. 
However, both kinds of twins share 
the same prenatal environment.

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
Reproductive 
Technologies
MUCH OF THE DATA about 
 reproductive technology focuses on 
strategies for artificially fertilizing ova 
and transferring them to the uterus for 
the prenatal period. Many websites 
are available for advice, exchange of 
information, and encouragement to 
individuals who are using or thinking 
about using these new technologies. 
The following sections describe 
reproductive technologies in use 
today.
ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION
This is an old form of reproductive 
technology that is commonly used in 
animal husbandry and more recently 
has been applied to human fertilization. 
Sperm that have been donated and 
frozen are injected into a woman at 
the time of her ovulation. The most 
successful approach is to inject the 
sperm directly into the uterus (IUI, 
intrauterine insemination), thus 
bypassing the potentially destructive 
cervical environment. 
Typically, the male partner is the 
source of the sperm; however, this 
is not necessary. Some sperm banks 
keep the donors’ characteristics on fi le, 
which enables the woman to select the 
sperm of a donor whose features she 
desires in her offspring. Other banks 
blend sperm, so that the recipient 
cannot trace the donor’s identity. 
In one recent case, a woman froze 
her husband’s sperm and was able 
to conceive his child using artifi cial 
insemination after his death. Success 
rate: 5% to 30% per cycle using IUI 
(www.IVF-infertility.com, 2007).
FERTILITY DRUGS
Ovulation induction is the artifi cial 
stimulation of the ovaries to produce 
eggs using fertility drugs. There is 
about a 90% chance that the ovaries 
can be made to work with the right 
drug(s) so long as the woman does not 
have a raised baseline FSH level that 
may indicate ovarian failure (www.ivf-
infertility.com, 2007). The administration 
of fertility drugs usually results in the 
release of multiple eggs at a cycle, 
increasing the chances that one egg 
will be fertilized. In about 20% of 
cases, multiple births result. Most other 
assisted reproductive technologies 
begin with this step (i.e., using some 
form of medication to stimulate the 
ovaries to produce eggs). If this is 
successful, decisions must be made 
about how many eggs to fertilize and 
how many embryos to transfer to the 
uterus.
IN VITRO FERTILIZATION (FERTILIZATION 
IN AN ARTIFICIAL ENVIRONMENT)
Eggs are removed from the ovary 
and placed in a petri dish inside an 
incubator. A few drops of sperm are 
then added to the dish. If the eggs are 
fertilized and the cells begin to divide, 
they are implanted in the uterus for 
subsequent development. Typically, 
two or three embryos are transferred 
at once in hopes that at least one will 
implant and mature. Success rate: 32.9% 
(U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, 2006).
INTRACYTOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION
A modification of in vitro fertilization 
in which a sperm is injected directly 
into the egg. This procedure is used 
when there is a very low sperm 
APPLYING THEORY AND RESEARCH TO LIFE
before conceiving or giving up on their hopes for a bio-
logically related child (Savitz-Smith, 2003). Over time, the 
impact of infertility can become increasingly stressful, lead-
ing to high levels of depression as various alternatives are 
tried and fail (Domar et al., 2000).
In addition to the emotional costs of treatment, there are 
substantial fi nancial costs amounting to tens of thousands of 
dollars, most of which is not covered by insurance. Moreover, 
many procedures are unsuccessful. During 1 year of unpro-
tected sexual relations, 90% of healthy couples achieve preg-
nancy. Data from 430 U.S. clinics reporting to the National 
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promo-
tion in 2007 provide a picture of the likelihood that a repro-
ductive cycle results in a live birth. The cycle begins with 
the fertilization of one or more ova using one of the tech-
niques described in the box on reproductive technologies. 
The 142,435 ART cycles performed at these reporting clin-
ics resulted in 43,412 live births (deliveries of one or more 
living infants) and 57,565 infants. This is an overall success 
rate of 30% of live births per ART cycles (U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, 2009). For more information about infertil-
ity and reproductive technologies, you may want to visit the 
website of the International Council on Infertility Informa-
tion Dissemination at www.inciid.org
On an encouraging note, studies have reported the positive 
quality of parenting and positive developmental outcomes 
for children conceived through artificial  insemination, 
 surrogacy, and in vitro fertilization (Golombok, Cook, 
Bish, & Murray, 1995; Golombok, MacCallum, & Good-
man, 2001; Golombok, Murray, Jadva, MacCallum, & Lycett, 
2004). Families with children conceived through alternative 
reproductive technologies have been compared with families 
with naturally conceived and adopted children. In general, 
parents of children conceived through both types of assisted 
reproduction showed more warmth and involvement with 
their children, higher levels of interaction, and lower levels of 
stress than the parents of children who were conceived natu-
rally. Parents of adopted children typically scored in between 
the levels of the other two groups. In a comparison of

count or nonmotile sperm. Embryos 
produced by in vitro fertilization can 
be frozen for future use if the initial 
pregnancy does not reach full term. 
Success rate: 30.9% (U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services, 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 2006).
GAMETE INTRAFALLOPIAN TRANSFER 
(GIFT)
Eggs and sperm are transferred into a 
woman’s fallopian tubes. Fertilization 
takes place as it normally would, 
within the woman’s reproductive 
system. These eggs and sperm may 
come from the couple or from other 
donors. Thus, the fetus may be 
genetically related to the man or the 
woman in the couple or to neither. 
Success rate: 23.3% (U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services, 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 2006).
IN VIVO FERTILIZATION (FERTILIZATION 
IN A LIVING BODY)
Partners involve another woman in 
the conception. The second woman, 
who has demonstrated her fertility, is 
artifi cially inseminated with the man’s 
sperm. Once an embryo has formed, 
it is transferred to the fi rst woman’s 
uterus, which becomes the gestational 
environment. The child is therefore 
genetically related to the man but not to 
the woman.
SURROGATE MOTHER
There are two types of surrogacy, 
traditional and gestational. In the 
traditional surrogacy, sperm from an 
infertile woman’s husband are injected 
into the surrogate mother during 
the time of her monthly ovulation. 
This is repeated each month until 
the surrogate becomes pregnant. 
The surrogate mother bears the child 
and returns it to the couple at birth. 
In gestational surrogacy, the couple 
produces the embryo through IVF and 
the resulting embryo is implanted in the 
surrogate. Surrogacy is an expensive 
and legally complicated procedure. 
Not all states allow surrogacy, and each 
state has its own regulations regarding 
its execution. The Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention estimated 
that there were 550 births through 
surrogacy in 2002 (http://BabyCenter
.com, 2006).
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Of the ARTs described, which ones 
appear to have the best chance of 
resulting in a live birth?
 2. What are the costs associated with 
these various ARTs? You will have 
to go to other sources beyond this 
book to fi nd out about this.
 3. What are the risks associated with 
each method? Again, you will have 
to draw on additional resources and 
use your critical thinking skills to ad-
dress this question.
 4. What are the different reasons that 
people may have for wanting to 
explore ARTs? What medical or per-
sonal circumstances might lead to 
a preference for one method over 
another?
 5. If you were advising someone 
who was thinking about using 
ART, how would you approach the 
topic? What factors would you 
want the person to be aware of? 
What would you point out related 
to health risks, costs, and success 
rates?
 6. Why might someone prefer using 
one of these technologies over 
adopting a child?
parenting experiences for couples who conceived through a 
successful ART procedure and couples who conceived spon-
taneously, mothering experiences during the child’s fi rst year 
of life were more positive for the ART mothers. Diffi culties 
with the birth, challenges associated with low-birth-weight 
babies, and diffi culties soothing the babies were perceived as 
less stressful for the ART mothers than for mothers who con-
ceived through spontaneous fertility (Repokari et al., 2006). 
In general, the research to date suggests a positive develop-
mental trajectory for mother-infant relationships for infants 
conceived through in vitro fertilization.
Ethical Considerations. Assisted reproductive technologies 
(ARTs) have raised many legal and ethical questions. One 
of these questions focuses on equitable access to these new 
technologies (Beckman & Harvey, 2005). A variety of social, 
medical, fi nancial, and legal practices have resulted in lim-
ited access to ART for certain groups of women includ-
ing lesbians, poor women, and women whose ability to 
rear children is questioned, especially women with certain 
disabilities and older women (Peterson, 2005). As a result of 
fertility intervention, a 63-year-old postmenopausal woman 
gave birth. She was reported to be the oldest birth mother on 
record (Kalb, 1997). Ethical considerations have been raised 
about the use of medical technology to keep the birth win-
dow open at this advanced age. Concerns focus on the medi-
cal complications associated with pregnancy in older women 
and on whether older men and women can sustain effective 
parenting as their children move into adolescence while they 
enter later adulthood.
Another area of ethical concern involves what people con-
sider to be the acceptable use of reproductive technologies. 
For example, there is a debate about whether couples should 
be allowed to use reproductive technologies to select the sex 
of their child or to select for or against certain genetic condi-
tions such as deafness or Down syndrome that are not life 
threatening (Hollingsworth, 2005; Johnston, 2005). A third 
ethical concern involves the lack of information for consum-
ers in order to make a reasoned decision about whether to 
elect to use reproductive technologies. Information about

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
for infertility need to cope with the grief and disappointment 
of unsuccessful outcomes before engaging in the adoption 
process. Once the alternative of adoption is being consid-
ered, new decisions must be faced including: international 
versus domestic adoption; age of child; racial preferences; 
and adoption from a private service or a public agency. The 
adoption process typically includes a 3- to 6-month home 
study in which a social worker gathers information about 
the adoptive parents. This process allows the adoptive par-
ents to consider the decision to adopt from many angles, and 
also allows the agency to reach an informed assessment of 
whether the prospective parents will be able to provide a car-
ing, supportive family for the adoptive child (Pertman, 2000; 
Arcus & Chambers, 2008).
Development in the First Trimester
The period of pregnancy—typically 40 weeks after the last 
menstrual period, or 38 weeks from ovulation—is often 
conceptualized in three 3-month periods called trimesters. 
Perhaps because development is so rapid and dramatic dur-
ing the fi rst trimester, it is divided further into the germinal 
period, the embryonic period, and the fetal period. Each 
trimester brings changes in the status of the developing fetus 
and its supporting systems. These changes are summarized 
briefl y in Table 4.2 (Moore & Persaud, 2003). The pregnant 
woman also experiences changes during the trimesters. In 
the fi rst trimester, many women are not certain that they are 
pregnant. By the last trimester, though, the woman is usually 
certain, and so is everyone else!
The Germinal Period
After fertilization, the egg begins to divide. At this time, the 
cell material is referred to as a zygote until implantation. 
risks, costs, legal considerations, and effectiveness is often 
not available or not accurate (Wingert, Harvey, Duncan, & 
Berry, 2005).
Questions are raised about the limits that should be 
placed on the production and use of embryos in vitro. 
Should we permit scientists to produce embryos from frozen 
sperm and egg cells for purposes other than implantation? 
Thousands of frozen embryos are held in various medi-
cal and laboratory facilities in the United States. Research 
on embryos is important for further understanding of the 
expression of genetic diseases, for understanding the factors 
associated with miscarriages, and for improving reproductive 
technologies. Various countries as well as states within the 
United States differ in their laws governing the use, preserva-
tion, and ownership of embryos produced through ART. Eth-
ical and legal questions are being raised about the rights of 
parents to determine the fate of these embryos, the embryos’ 
rights to protection and inheritance, and the responsibility 
of institutes and laboratories to ensure the proper use of the 
embryos (Krones et al., 2006).
Finally, issues regarding claims to parenthood are called 
into question. The husband of a woman who is planning to 
be artificially inseminated must consent to the procedure 
and agree to assume legal guardianship of the offspring. But 
are there parental rights associated with being sperm and egg 
donors? Over the years, a range of new policies and proce-
dures have been instituted to help clarify and limit the rights 
of all those involved in ART births.
Some adults choose adoption as an alternative to child-
bearing as a way of having children. Adoption is an alter-
native to biological reproduction for those who believe that 
there are already enough children who need families, and 
for those who have tried alternative reproductive technolo-
gies to no avail. Most agencies that provide adoption ser-
vices suggest that couples who have undergone treatment

blood. Thus, the placenta is an exchange station at which 
adult material is synthesized for the embryo’s use and for-
eign materials harmful to the embryo’s development can be 
screened out. However, this screening is imperfect. Even 
though the mother’s blood and the embryo’s blood are sepa-
rated by independent systems, the placenta permits the two 
systems to come close enough that oxygen and nutrients 
from the mother’s blood can enter the fetal system and waste 
products from the fetal system can be removed. In the pro-
cess, certain substances in the mother’s system may affect 
the fetal system.
Agents that can produce malformations in the fetus 
while the tissues and organs are forming are referred to as 
teratogens. Teratogens have a wide variety of forms, such 
as viruses; medicines, alcohol, and other drugs that a preg-
nant woman takes; and environmental toxins. During the 
fi rst trimester—especially weeks 3 through 9—the embryo 
is particularly sensitive to the disruptive infl uences of terato-
gens (see Figure 4.7).
In the third and fourth weeks, the embryo’s cells dif-
ferentiate rapidly, taking on the specialized structures that 
will permit them to carry out their unique functions in the 
body. Similar cells are grouped into tissues that gradually 
emerge as body organs. The fi rst essential changes include 
the establishment of the body form as an elongated cylin-
der and the formation of the precursors of the brain and 
the heart. The neural tube, which is the structural basis of 
the central nervous system, begins to take shape at the end 
of the third week after conception. Cells in the neural tube 
are produced at the miraculous rate of 250,000 a minute 
over the fi rst 5 weeks, as the tube is differentiated into fi ve 
bulges that are the forerunners of the major subdivisions of 
the brain.
The central nervous system begins to develop early in the 
prenatal period and continues to develop throughout child-
hood and adolescence. Most of the neurons that will make 
up the cerebral cortex are produced by the end of the sec-
ond trimester. By birth, the infant’s brain contains roughly 
100 billion neurons, ready to be linked and organized into 
networks as the infant responds to environmental stimula-
tion and patterned experience (Aoki & Siekevitz, 1988; 
Nash, 1997). By the end of the fourth week, the head, the 
upper trunk, and the lower trunk are visible, as are the limb 
buds and the forerunners of the forebrain, midbrain, hind-
brain, eyes, and ears. The embryo has increased 50 times 
in length and 40,000 times in weight since the moment of 
fertilization.
By the end of the second month, the embryo looks quite 
human. It weighs about 2.25 grams and is about 28 millime-
ters (1 inch) long. Almost all the internal organs are formed, 
as are the external features of the face, limbs, fi ngers, and 
toes. At 8 weeks, the embryo will respond to mild stimula-
tion. The embryonic period ends about 10 weeks after the 
last menstrual period—most of the essential structures are 
formed by this time. The term fetus is used from this point 
until birth.
The fi rst series of cell divisions does not increase the mass 
of the cells, nor do the cells take on specialized functions; 
rather, the cell material is redistributed among several parts. 
When implantation is successful, by the sixth day after fer-
tilization, the egg makes contact with the lining of the uterus 
and begins to attach itself there. At this point, the cells are 
referred to as an embryo. Sometimes, the egg does not reach 
the uterus but attaches itself to the fallopian tube or even to 
some area of the intestine. The embryo may grow in these 
locations until the organ ruptures.
The Embryonic Period
The 3 weeks following implantation are devoted primarily 
to elaboration of the supportive elements that will house 
the embryo. An amniotic sac surrounds the embryo and 
fi lls with a clear, watery fl uid. This fl uid acts as a cushion 
that buffers the embryo and permits it to move about and 
change position. Once the embryo is firmly implanted in 
the uterus, special cells in the placenta produce a hormone 
that maintains the uterine lining. This hormone is excreted 
through the kidneys, so a urine sample can be evaluated to 
determine its presence. Home pregnancy tests are based on 
the detection of this hormone in a small drop of urine and 
are accurate 1 or 2 days after implantation. A large num-
ber of pregnancies are spontaneously aborted in these early 
weeks, usually as a result of some major abnormalities of the 
embryo (Winston & Handyside, 1993).
The placenta is an organ that is newly formed with each 
pregnancy and is expelled at birth. Nutrients necessary for 
the embryo’s growth pass through the placenta, as does 
the embryo’s waste, which then passes into the mother’s 
The fertilized egg begins to divide as it travels along the 
fallopian tube toward the uterus.

FIGURE 4.7 Critical Periods in Prenatal Development. During the ﬁrst 2 weeks of development, the embryo is usually not susceptible to teratogens. 
During these pre-differentiation stages, a substance either damages all or most of the cells of the embryo, resulting in its death, or damages only 
a few cells, allowing the embryo to recover without developing defects. Dark bars denote highly sensitive periods for particular organs or organ 
systems; light bars indicate stages that are less sensitive to teratogens. Severe mental retardation may result from the exposure of the embryo or 
fetus to teratogenic agents, such as high levels of radiation, from the 8th to the 16th week.

which no sex-linked characteristics can be discerned. Both 
female and male embryos have a surface mass that becomes 
the testes in male fetuses and eventually deteriorates in 
female fetuses, when new sex cells grow to form the ovaries. 
Both male and female embryos have two sets of sex ducts. In 
male fetuses, the sperm ducts develop and the female ducts 
dissolve. In female fetuses, the fallopian tubes, the uterus, 
and the vagina develop, and the other ducts degenerate. 
Finally, both male and female embryos have a conical area 
that is the outlet for the bladder duct. When the male tes-
tes develop, this area forms into the penis and scrotum. In 
female fetuses, it remains to form the clitoris, which is sur-
rounded by the genital swellings of the labia majora.
Differentiation of the male and female genitalia is guided 
by genetic information. In the presence of the maleness gene, 
SRY, the undifferentiated embryonic tissue is transformed 
into the testes. The testes then produce hormones that facili-
tate the further elaboration of male genitalia and internal 
reproductive structures. Genes carried on the X chromosome 
are thought to guide the formation of the ovaries (Crooks & 
Bauer, 2005).
The genetic factors that produce the differentiation of the 
fetus as male or female appear to influence more than the 
formation of the reproductive organs and the production of 
hormones. Research on the organization and structure of the 
brain suggests that during fetal and early postnatal devel-
opment, sex hormones direct male and female brains along 
slightly different paths. Three areas of the brain—the hypo-
thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus—have been studied 
as potential sites for sex differences in structure that may relate 
to some of the functional areas in which men’s and women’s 
problem-solving and cognitive skills differ (Kimura, 1992).
Although males and females are very similar in most 
psychological variables, and in particular have similar dis-
tributions in measured intelligence, studies by numerous 
researchers have shown that sex differences in hormonal 
levels infl uence differences in specifi c problem-solving areas 
and intellectual strengths. Some of the areas in which males 
and females have been shown to differ include: verbal abil-
ity, visual-spatial ability, and mathematical ability. We are 
still not sure what the route is from the developing fetal 
brain structure to cognitive functioning in childhood and 
beyond, but it is increasingly clear that anatomical variations 
in regions of the brain and their interconnections are tied to 
sex-linked variations in certain specialized problem-solving 
capacities (Kimura, 2002).
The 3-month-old fetus moves spontaneously and has 
both a grasp refl ex and a Babinski refl ex, in which the toes 
extend and fan out in response to a mild stroke on the sole of 
the foot. When an amplifi ed stethoscope, called a Doppler, 
is placed on the mother’s abdomen, the fetal heartbeat can 
be heard through the uterine wall by the expectant parents 
as well as the physician and nurse. For expectant parents, 
listening to the fetal heartbeat is one of the fi rst experiences 
that transforms the fetus from something abstract and remote 
to a concrete, vital reality.
The Fetal Period
In the third month, the fetus grows to 3 inches, and its 
weight increases to 14 grams. The head is about one third of 
the total body length. During this month, the fetus assumes 
the fetal position, arms curled up toward the face and knees 
bent in to the stomach. The eyelids are fused.
A dramatic change takes place in the sex organs during 
this period. All embryos go through a bisexual stage, during 
At 5½ weeks, cell differentiation has resulted in an embryo that 
is about 0.4 inch (1 cm) long. Emerging shapes of the head, arm, 
and fi ngers are visible. Many women are not even sure about 
their pregnancy at this point in fetal development. 
At 8 weeks, the fi ngers are clearly differentiated and the hand is 
distinct from the forearm. Refl exes sometimes guide the hand 
toward the face. The fetus is encased in the amniotic sac.

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
The external ear canal is fi lled with fl uid, and the fetus 
does not tend to respond to sound until the eighth or ninth 
month; however, the semicircular canals of the inner ear are 
sensitive to stimulation. The nerve fi bers that connect the 
retina to the brain are developed by 6 months, and infants 
born prematurely at this time respond to light.
At 25 weeks, the fetus functions well within its uterine 
environment. It swallows, digests, excretes, moves about, 
sucks its thumb, rests, and grows. However, the nervous sys-
tem, which begins to develop at 3 weeks, is still not mature 
enough to coordinate the many systems that must function 
simultaneously to ensure survival. Whereas the 22-week-old 
fetus has almost no chance to survive outside the uterus, the 
outlook for a 24-week-old fetus is anywhere from 50% to 
90%, depending on the quality of the intensive care and the 
birth conditions. By 30 weeks, survival outside the uterus is 
almost certain.
Development in the Third Trimester
In the last trimester, the average fetus grows from 10 to 
20 inches and increases in weight from 2 to 7 or 7½ pounds. 
These increases in body size and weight are paralleled by 
a maturation of the central nervous system. From 20 to 
28 weeks of gestational age, fetal heart rate declines and vari-
ability and accelerations in heart rate increase. In the third 
trimester, there are longer periods of quiet between fetal 
movements. By combining recordings from ultrasound and 
monitoring of fetal heart rate, patterns of fetal behavioral 
states have been documented. They include periods of quiet, 
similar to non-REM sleep in newborns; periods of frequent 
movement with sleep-like heartbeat, similar to REM sleep; 
periods of quiet wakefulness; and periods of active wake-
fulness (Nijhuis, 2003). Moreover, fetal heart rate and fetal 
Development in the Second Trimester
During the second trimester, the average fetus grows to 
10 inches and increases in weight to almost 2 pounds. The 
fetus continues to grow at the rate of about an inch every 10 
days from the fi fth month until the end of the pregnancy. 
During this trimester, the uterus itself begins to stretch and 
grow. It rises into the mother’s abdominal cavity and expands 
until, by the end of the ninth month, it is pushing against the 
ribs and diaphragm. The reality of a growing life becomes 
more evident to the pregnant woman during this trimester 
as she observes the changes in her body and experiences 
the early fetal movements, called quickening. These move-
ments fi rst feel like light bubbles or twitches; later, they can 
be identifi ed as the foot, elbow, or fi st of the restless resident.
During the fourth month, the fetus begins to suck and 
swallow. Whenever the fetus opens its mouth, amniotic fl uid 
enters and cycles through the system. This fluid provides 
some nutrients in addition to those absorbed through the 
placenta. The 4-month-old fetus shows some preference for 
a sweet taste: If sugar is introduced into the amniotic fl uid, it 
will swallow the fl uid at a faster rate.
In the fifth month, the skin begins to thicken, and a 
cheesy coating of dead cells and oil, the vernix caseosa, cov-
ers the skin. The individuality of the fetus is marked by the 
pattern of skin ridges on the fi ngers and toes. Hair covers the 
scalp, eyebrows, back, arms, and legs.
The sensory receptors of the fetus are well established by 
the end of the sixth month. The fetus is sensitive to touch 
and may react to it with a muscle movement. It will also 
stick out its tongue in response to a bitter taste. Throughout 
the sixth month, the nostrils are plugged by skin cells. When 
these cells dissolve, the nose fi lls with amniotic fl uid; thus, 
the sense of smell is probably not functional until birth.
At 16 weeks, the fetus is about 6.4 
inches (16 cm) long and is clearly 
recognizable as a human child. The 
fetus has assumed what is known as 
the “fetal position”—arms curled 
up near the head and legs bent in 
toward the stomach—a position that 
remains part of the human behavioral 
repertoire throughout life.

rate provided evidence that the fetuses recognized a tape 
recording of the familiar rhyme in comparison to unfamil-
iar rhymes. All this evidence supports the notion that a fetus 
experiences its mother’s speech sounds during the third tri-
mester and becomes familiar with the sound of her voice and 
the features of her spoken language (DeCasper et al., 1994).
The advantages that a full-term fetus has over a prema-
ture, 28-week-old fetus include: (1) the ability to begin and 
maintain regular breathing; (2) a stronger sucking response; 
(3) well-coordinated swallowing movements; (4) stronger 
peristalsis and, therefore, more effi cient digestion and waste 
excretion; and (5) a more fully balanced control of body 
temperature.
The full-term fetus has been able to take advantage 
of minerals in the mother’s diet for the formation of tooth 
enamel. As the placenta begins to degenerate in the last 
month of pregnancy, antibodies against various diseases that 
have been formed in the mother’s blood pass into the fetal 
bloodstream. They provide the fetus with immunity to many 
diseases during the fi rst few months of life.
The uterus cannot serve indefi nitely as the home of the 
fetus. Several factors lead to the eventual termination of the 
fetal-uterine relationship. First, as the placenta degenerates, 
antibodies that form in both the mother’s and the fetus’s 
blood would destroy the blood of the other. Second, because 
the placenta does not grow much larger than 2 pounds, the 
fetus, as it reaches its maximum size, cannot obtain enough 
nutrients to sustain life. Third, the fetal head cannot grow 
much larger than the pelvic opening without endangering 
the brain in the birth process. Even though soft connecting 
membranes permit the skull plates to overlap, head size is a 
factor that limits fetal growth.
movement become increasingly coordinated. These pat-
terns suggest a critical integration of the somatic and cardiac 
processes within the central nervous system. At some point 
between 28 and 32 weeks, these patterns of increase stop, 
and are replaced by a leveling off or slight decrease. This 
pattern is interpreted to mean that a certain critical level of 
neurological maturation is in place by 32 weeks. Evidence 
to support this idea is found in the cognitive competence of 
preterm infants who are born at about 32 weeks (DiPietro 
et al., 2004).
Additional evidence of cognitive maturation is provided 
by studies of fetal memory. By the age of 30 weeks gesta-
tional age, the fetus appears to recognize and remember 
the sensation of a vibroacoustic stimulus that is applied 
to the mother’s abdomen. Fetal movement in the second 
following the stimulus is taken as evidence of a response. 
The absence of fetal movement on four trials following 
several consecutive positive responses is taken as evidence 
of habituation or familiarity with the stimulus. By 38 weeks 
of gestational age, the fetus recognizes these vibroacoustic 
stimuli even 4 weeks after the last testing session (Dirix, 
Nijhuis, Jongsma, & Hornstra, 2009).
Studies of 36- to 39-week-old fetuses have found that 
they are sensitive to changes in low-pitched musical notes, to 
pulsing as compared to continuous sounds, and to changes 
in speech sounds (Groome et al., 2000; Lecanuet, Graniere-
Deferre, Jacquet, & DeCasper, 2000; Byers-Heinlein, Burns, 
& Werker, 2010). In one study, pregnant women recited a 
children’s rhyme aloud every day from the 33rd through the 
37th week of fetal development. Monitoring of the fetal heart 
At 23 weeks, the fetus is about 12 inches (30 cm) long, still small 
enough to have room to swim about in the expanding uterus. As 
any pregnant woman will tell you, the fetus is active at this stage, 
kicking, grasping, waving its arms, and turning over. 
These are the birth footprints of a baby born prematurely at 
23 weeks, and one born at a full 40-week gestational age.

contractions, signaling that labor has begun and generally 
accompanied by a move from the home to the hospital or 
birthing center; (3) the transition phase, during which con-
tractions are strong, rest times between contractions are 
short, and women experience the greatest diffi culty or dis-
comfort; (4) the birth process, which allows the mother’s 
active participation in the delivery and is generally accompa-
nied by a move from the labor area to the more sterile deliv-
ery room; and (5) the postpartum period, which involves the 
initial interactions with the newborn, physiological changes 
that mark a return to the prepregnant state, and the return 
home. The signifi cant events of these phases are summarized 
in Table 4.3.
Cesarean Delivery
Sometimes a normal, spontaneous vaginal delivery would 
be dangerous to the mother or the newborn (Cunningham 
et al., 2001). One alternative is to remove the baby surgi-
cally through an incision in the uterine wall. The procedure, 
called a cesarean section, may have gotten its name from an 
8th century BC Roman law, lex cesarea, which required that 
in the case of the death of a pregnant woman, a postmortem 
operative delivery would be performed, so that the mother 
and child could be buried separately (Sehdev, 2005). Until 
as late as the 17th century, infants might be saved through 
the cesarean section but the operation was usually fatal to 
mothers.
The incidence of cesarean deliveries in the United 
States increased from 5.5% of births in 1970 to 32% in 
2007 (Menacker & Hamilton, 2010). Cesarean deliver-
ies may be planned or unplanned. The procedure may be 
used if labor is severely prolonged and the fetus appears to 
be at risk due to lack of oxygen. It may also be used when 
the infant is in the breech position (feet or buttocks fi rst 
rather than head fi rst) or if the mother’s pelvis is too small 
for the infant’s head to pass through. Physicians often rec-
ommend a repeat cesarean if the woman has delivered by 
cesarean section before. The rate of cesarean deliveries 
is higher for mothers age 30 and older than for younger 
mothers.
The cesarean delivery makes childbirth a surgical pro-
cedure, requiring anesthetics, intravenous feeding of the 
mother, and a prolonged recovery period. Although the pro-
cedure undoubtedly saves many infants and mothers who 
would not survive vaginal childbirth, there is some concern 
that it is being misused for the convenience of health pro-
fessionals or busy mothers who want to be able to sched-
ule deliveries and thus avoid waiting for the unpredictable 
onset of labor. In a national goal statement, Healthy People 
2020, the U.S. Public Health Service calls for a reduction of 
the national cesarean rate for both fi rst-time deliveries and 
for births following a cesarean with an overall rate of 15% 
(National Center for Health Statistics, 2009)—a goal imply-
ing that a substantial number of the current cesarean proce-
dures are not required.
Late in pregnancy, the fetal brain begins to produce hor-
mones that increase the production of estrogen in the pla-
centa. This, in turn, leads to a shift from mild to strong 
uterine contractions, which result in dilation of the cer-
vix, rupture of the amniotic sac, and delivery (Nathanielsz, 
1996). The approximate time from conception to birth is 
38 weeks. However, there is a great deal of variability in the 
duration of pregnancies and in the size of full-term infants, 
even infants born to the same mother.
The Birth Process
Objective 4. To describe the birth process and factors 
that contribute to infant mortality.
Birth is initiated by involuntary contractions of the uterine 
muscles, commonly referred to as labor. The length of time 
from the beginning of labor to the birth of the infant is highly 
variable. The average time is 14 hours for women undergo-
ing their first labor (primiparae) and 8 hours for women 
undergoing later labors (multiparae).
The uterine contractions serve two central functions: 
effacement and dilation. Effacement, or thinning, is the short-
ening of the cervical canal. Dilation is the gradual enlarge-
ment of the cervix from an opening only millimeters wide to 
one of about 10 centimeters—large enough for the baby to 
pass through. Effacement and dilation occur without deliber-
ate effort by the mother. Once the cervix is fully enlarged, 
the mother can assist in the birth by exerting pressure on the 
abdominal walls of the uterus. The baby, too, helps in the 
birth process by squirming, turning its head, and pushing 
against the birth canal.
Stages of Labor
The medical profession describes three stages of labor. The 
fi rst stage begins with the onset of uterine contractions and 
ends with the full dilation of the cervix; this is the longest 
stage. The second stage involves the expulsion of the fetus. 
It begins at full dilation and ends with the delivery of the 
baby. The third stage begins with delivery and ends with the 
expulsion of the placenta. This stage usually lasts 5 to 10 
minutes.
These three stages of labor do not precisely parallel the 
personal experience of childbirth. For example, although 
the expulsion of the placenta is considered a unique stage of 
labor in the medical model, it is rarely mentioned in wom-
en’s accounts of their birth experiences. On the other hand, 
many of the signs of impending labor that occur in the last 
weeks of pregnancy are often included in women’s accounts 
of labor.
In terms of the psychological adaptation to the birth pro-
cess, labor can be viewed as having five phases: (1) early 
signs that labor is approaching; (2) strong, regular uterine

Infant mortality rates vary from one country and region 
of the world to another. In 2003, the infant mortality rate 
in Japan was 3.3, but in that same year, the infant mortality 
rate in nine other countries of the world was more than 90. 
The United States, with all its resources and advanced tech-
nology, ranks behind other industrialized countries, includ-
ing Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the 
Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom. 
Within the United States, regional infant mortality rates 
range from a low of 4.7 per 1000 in the state of Washington, 
to a high of 11.3 in the District of Columbia (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2010).
The density of low-income populations, availability of 
educational materials on the impact of diet and drugs on 
the developing fetus, and adequacy of medical facilities for 
high-risk newborns all contribute to the regional variations 
in infant death rates among populations of different incomes. 
Children conceived in poverty are at the greatest risk of 
infant mortality. Their mothers receive poorer quality prena-
tal care and are exposed to more dangerous environmental 
and health factors during the prenatal period than are moth-
ers of children conceived in more advantaged families. The 
chances that any one infant will survive the stresses of birth 
depend on the convergence of biological, environmental, 
cultural, and economic infl uences on the child’s intrauterine 
growth, delivery, and postnatal care (Dole et al., 2004).
Infant Mortality
The infant mortality rate is the number of infants who die 
during the fi rst year of life per 1000 live births during that 
year. In 2006, the U.S. rate was estimated at 6.7 deaths per 
1000 live births.
The rate for Black babies in the United States in 2006—
13.3 deaths per 1000 live births—was higher than the infant 
mortality rates in countries such as Chile, the Czech Repub-
lic, Cuba, and Poland, which are considered economically 
emergent nations (U.S. Census Bureau, 2009).
Roughly two thirds of infant deaths occur during the fi rst 
month after birth. Most of these deaths result from severe 
birth defects, premature birth, or sudden infant death 
 syndrome (SIDS), in which apparently healthy babies are 
put to bed and are later found dead with no clear explana-
tion, even after autopsy.
Infant mortality rates are infl uenced by many factors, includ-
ing the: (1) frequency of birth complications; (2) robustness of 
the infants who are being born, which is infl uenced by their 
prenatal nutrition and degree of exposure to viruses or bacte-
ria, damaging X rays, drugs, and other teratogens; (3) mother’s 
age; and (4) facilities that are available for prenatal and new-
born care. One fourth of infant deaths result from complica-
tions associated with low birth weight. If the conditions leading 
to prematurity could be altered, the U.S. infant mortality rate 
would be signifi cantly improved (Kocohanek & Martin, 2004).
TABLE 4.3 Significant Events of the Five Stages of Labor
PHASE 1: EARLY SIGNS THAT LABOR IS APPROACHING
1. Lightening (about 10 to 14 days before delivery). The baby’s head drops into the pelvic area.
2. Release of the plug that has kept the cervix closed.
3. Discharge of amniotic fl uid.
4. False labor: irregular uterine contractions.
PHASE 2: ONSET OF LABOR
1. Transition from home to hospital or birthing center.
2. Strong, regular contractions 3–5 minutes apart.
PHASE 3: TRANSITION
1. Accelerated labor, with contractions lasting up to 90 seconds and coming 2 or 3 minutes apart.
2. Some sense of disorientation, heightened arousal, or loss of control.
PHASE 4: BIRTH
1. The baby’s head presses down on the bottom of the birth canal.
2. The mother experiences a strong, refl exive urge to push to expel the baby.
3. The mother typically is moved from a labor area to a more sterile delivery room.
PHASE 5: POSTPARTUM PERIOD
1. Mother and infant have initial contact.
2. Placenta is expelled.
3. Rapid alteration of the hormone system to stimulate lactation and shrink the uterus.
4. Mother and infant engage in early learning behaviors; infant attempts to nurse; mother explores infant and begins to interpret his or 
her needs.
5. Return to the home and introduction of the newborn into the family setting.

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
Although changes in the hormonal environment might be 
able to account for some of these symptoms, others are prob-
ably brought about by the convergence of the physical, cogni-
tive, and emotional changes of pregnancy (Buckwalter et al., 
1999). In some cases, pregnancy is accompanied by serious 
illnesses that threaten the mother’s health.
Changes in Roles and Social Status
Women who become pregnant may be treated in new ways 
by people close to them and by the broader community. 
Usually, fathers become more concerned for and supportive 
of their pregnant partners, and pregnant women may also be 
viewed in a new light by their peers. In some communities, 
adolescent girls who become pregnant feel ashamed or guilty. 
In others, becoming pregnant during adolescence is viewed 
by the peer group as an accomplishment, a sign of matu-
rity. At work, women who become pregnant may be given 
fewer responsibilities or may be passed over for promotions. 
The Mother, the Fetus, and 
the Psychosocial Environment
Objective 5. To analyze the reciprocity between the 
pregnant woman and the developing fetus, focusing on 
ways in which pregnancy affects a childbearing woman 
and expectant father and on basic infl uences on fetal 
growth, such as maternal age, drug use, nutrition, and 
environmental toxins.
The course and pattern of prenatal development are guided 
by genetic information that unfolds in the context of the 
pregnant woman’s biopsychosocial environment. A woman’s 
health, her attitudes toward pregnancy and childbirth, her 
lifestyle, the resources available to her during her pregnancy, 
and the behavior demanded of her by her culture all infl u-
ence her sense of well-being. Many of these same factors 
may directly affect the health and growth of the fetus. In the 
next section, we discuss the impact of the fetus on the preg-
nant woman, including how the pregnancy might affect the 
infant’s father and his relationship to the mother. The subse-
quent section focuses on the impact of the pregnant woman 
on the fetus and the many factors that contribute to the qual-
ity of the intrauterine environment.
The Impact of the Fetus on the 
Pregnant Woman
Consider some of the ways in which a fetus influences a 
pregnant woman. Pregnancy initiates sweeping hormonal 
changes that prepare the uterus to host the developing fetus. 
Over the months of pregnancy, the uterus changes in size and 
shape, altering the woman’s physical appearance and plac-
ing new pressures on internal organs. Beginning in the sec-
ond trimester, women experience fetal movement. Research 
that focused on the synchrony between fetal movement and 
maternal heart rate showed that after about 20 weeks gesta-
tional age, a regular pattern could be observed in which fetal 
movement is followed after 2 or 3 seconds by an increase in 
maternal heart rate. Fetal movement occurs about once every 
minute. Even when the pregnant woman is not aware of the 
movement, changes in heart rate following movement were 
observed. One can think of the fetus as making repeated and 
continuous signals that engage the mother’s autonomic ner-
vous system, and thereby begin a process through which the 
mother’s level of arousal is linked to the infant’s state (DiPi-
etro et al., 2006).
Pregnancy alters a woman’s body image and her sense 
of well-being. Some women feel especially vigorous and 
energetic during much of their pregnancy; others experi-
ence distressing symptoms such as nausea, backache, swell-
ing, headache, and irritability. Some women say they have 
difficulty remembering things during their last trimester. 
Depending on their health, the type of work they do, and the 
support of family and workplace colleagues, some women can 
continue to work well into the last trimester of their pregnancy.

they become mothers, Japanese women begin to have an 
impact on government, community, and public life as the 
people who are especially responsible for molding and 
shaping the next generation. For Mexican American women, 
childbearing is likely to be viewed within a broad religious 
context. “It is considered the privilege and essential obli-
gation of a married woman to bear children, but children 
come ‘when God is willing’” (Hahn & Muecke, 1987). 
Despite their difficult economic and social conditions, 
women who are Mexican immigrants in the United States 
have relatively fewer low-birth-weight babies than moth-
ers from other low-income groups. One explanation for this 
is that pregnancy brings forth substantial family support, 
which buffers the pregnant woman from the adverse effects 
of poverty (Sherraden & Barrera, 1996; Sagrestano, Felman, 
Killingsworth Rini, Woo, & Dunkel-Schetter, 1999). See the 
box that discusses the positive effects for the mother of hav-
ing a doula or supportive companion during the labor and 
delivery.
In business settings, pregnancy may be viewed as an annoy-
ance, something that is likely to interfere with productivity 
and is, at best, to be tolerated.
Within the family, a pregnant woman is likely to be treated 
with new levels of concern and care. Her pregnancy affects 
her partner, her parents and siblings, her previous children, 
and her partner’s family. By giving birth to a first child, a 
woman transforms her mother and father into grandparents 
and her brothers and sisters into uncles and aunts. Moreover, 
pregnancy may strengthen the gender identity of the baby’s 
mother or father. Just as infertility threatens one’s gender 
identity, becoming pregnant may be viewed as confi rmation 
of a woman’s femininity and a man’s virility in impregnating 
her (Heitlinger, 1989).
In some societies, pregnancy and childbirth confer spe-
cial status on a woman. In Japan, for example, traditional 
values place motherhood above all other women’s roles. 
“Only after giving birth to a child did a woman become a 
fully tenured person in the family” (Bankart, 1989). When 
The Doula or Birth 
Companion
THE IDEA OF having a supportive 
companion available to women during 
childbirth has been formalized in the role 
of doula. The term doula comes from a 
Greek word for handmaiden, referring 
to the primary servant for the woman of 
the household. Before the introduction 
of hospital deliveries, most cultures had 
a role for a close female companion who 
accompanied a woman during childbirth. 
The contemporary doula is trained to 
offer information as well as physical and 
emotional support during labor, delivery, 
and the early weeks following childbirth. 
Her role is to remain at the side of the 
laboring mother to help her have a safe, 
reassuring childbirth experience. She 
does not take the place of the midwife, 
obstetrician, nurses, or the mother’s 
partner (Doulas of North America, 1998).
The contribution of companion 
support to reducing complications 
during labor and delivery was studied 
with a group of Guatemalan women 
(Sosa, Kennell, Klaus, Robertson, & 
Urrutia, 1980). The hospital normally did 
not permit any visitors to remain with 
an expectant woman in the maternity 
ward.
Each woman in this study, however, 
was assigned a companion who stayed 
with her until delivery, talking to the 
woman, holding her hand, rubbing her 
back, and providing encouragement 
during labor. These mothers had fewer 
complications during labor than a group 
of women who had no companion, and 
their babies showed fewer signs of fetal 
distress. The mean length of labor was 
more than 10 hours shorter for those 
women who had a companion than for 
those who were alone.
A review of 15 studies involving 
more than 12,000 women examined 
additional empirical support for the 
contribution of the doula in childbirth 
(Hodnett, 2003). The studies were 
conducted in Australia, Belgium, 
Botswana, Canada, Finland, France, 
Greece, Guatemala, Mexico, South 
Africa, and the United States, under 
very different hospital conditions. All 
of the studies contrasted the childbirth 
experiences of women who did and 
did not have a supportive companion 
available during labor and delivery. 
Mothers who were accompanied by 
a supportive companion had shorter 
labors and fewer obstetrical diffi culties. 
The presumption is that a woman who 
is attended by a doula has lower levels 
of anxiety, thus reducing the release of 
neurotransmitters that might contribute 
to obstetrical diffi culties and neonatal 
distress (Corter & Fleming, 2002). 
The presence of a doula is especially 
valuable in cases, as in the Guatemalan 
study, where women would ordinarily 
labor alone with just the presence of 
the medical staff. To fi nd out more

companions, visit http://www.DONA

Critical Thinking Questions
 1. What are some possible mechanisms 
through which the presence of a sup-
portive companion might shorten 
labor and ease the delivery?
 2. What are the characteristics that would 
make a person an effective doula?
 3. How would you design a study to 
evaluate the benefi ts of a doula in 
childbirth?
 4. What are the characteristics of the 
U.S. birth culture that might prevent 
or support the inclusion of a doula 
as a component of prenatal care and 
childbirth?

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
own psychosocial maturity, their perceptions about the 
quality and stability of the relationships they are in, the sta-
bility of their employment, and their readiness to embrace 
the responsibilities of fatherhood. Some men worry about 
the economic ramifi cations of the impending birth. If they 
are unemployed or underemployed, they may worry about 
money, have low confi dence, feel they are not worth much, 
or be fearful that the mother’s income will decrease. In a 
study of an ethnically diverse sample of low-income, non-
custodial fathers, 171 men were aware of their responsi-
bility for 424 pregnancies. In-depth interviews with these 
men revealed four levels of intentionality about conception 
(Augustine, Nelson, & Edin, 2009). At the two extremes, 
17% of pregnancies were considered accidental and 15% 
were planned. But two intermediate responses illustrate 
the complex nature of reproductive behavior among this 
population. The largest group of pregnancies (47%) was 
described by the men as a result of “just not thinking.” 
These men did not have an overt plan to have a child, but 
did nothing to prevent it. In many cases, the pregnancy 
actually brought about a new level of personal responsibility 
and self-respect.
Dante, a 38-year-old African American father who had 
been living a high-risk lifestyle before the birth of his child, 
told researchers, “I know for a fact that if it wasn’t for my 
son and I was just a single guy [without kids] my life would 
be chaos!” (p. 109). Another group (19%) described their 
pregnancies as “unplanned but not unexpected.” These men 
had more stable employment, and were in a relatively long-
term positive relationship with the mother. As a result, even 
if the conception was not deliberately planned, the men felt 
that they were ready to become fathers and have a family.
Interviewer: Did you think she might get pregnant?
Respondent: Yeah, but I didn’t care. It was good. I was still a 
young man. I wasn’t wearing no protection, so it happened. 
(p. 109)
The many different types of relationships that are 
possible between a woman and her partner have impli-
cations for both the emotional state of the mother dur-
ing pregnancy and the psychosocial development of the 
child. Research supports the idea of continuity between 
the quality of the relationship between the partners dur-
ing the prenatal period and the quality of their parenting 
in the early years of childhood. This continuity in turn 
has implications for the child’s growth and development. 
Partners who show high levels of negative interaction or 
detachment during the prenatal period may have trouble 
providing an emotionally secure environment for their 
newborn child.
Couples characterized by positive mutuality, partner 
autonomy, and the ability to confront problems and regulate 
negative affect are responsive to the needs of their infants, 
promote their autonomy, and have more secure and autono-
mous children, as seen throughout the fi rst 4 years of life 
(Heinicke, 1995, p. 295).
Changes in the Mother’s Emotional State
Pregnancy is the 12th most stressful life change in a list of 43 
life events in the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (Holmes & 
Rahe, 1967). Thus, it is no surprise that mothers and fathers 
have strong emotional reactions to pregnancy. The woman’s 
attitude toward her unborn child may be pride, acceptance, 
rejection, or—as is usually the case—ambivalence. In most 
normal pregnancies, women experience anxiety and depres-
sion as well as positive feelings of excitement and hopeful-
ness. The normal physical changes during the gestational 
period include symptoms that are often associated with 
depression, such as fatigue, sleeplessness, slowed physi-
cal movement, preoccupation with one’s physical state, and 
moodiness (Kaplan, 1986). Moreover, throughout the preg-
nancy, the expectant woman has recurring worries and fears 
about the childbirth experience, whether the baby will be 
healthy, her own well-being, and the health and well-being 
of her family. These fears may be accentuated if the woman 
has heard about problems with childbirth from friends and 
relatives. In one study, women who had attended child-
birth classes were interviewed 4 weeks after they gave birth. 
Thirty-four percent of the women reported that their child-
birth experience was traumatic, including many who had 
symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (Soet, Brack, & 
Dilorio, 2003). Among women who have had previous preg-
nancies, worries may focus on recollections about the dif-
fi culties of delivery and the health and care of the new baby 
(Melender, 2002). Some women receive troubling informa-
tion during an ultrasound screening about possible fetal 
abnormalities. This information adds to anxiety during preg-
nancy (Brisch et al., 2003).
Certain psychosocial factors are associated with increased 
anxiety and depression during pregnancy, including expo-
sure to stressors, the absence of a supportive partner, and 
experiencing an unwanted pregnancy (Kalil, Gruber, Conley, 
& Sytniac, 1993). In a study of low-income African Ameri-
can and European American women, depression was high 
early in the pregnancy and declined in the months follow-
ing the birth of the child, as the women coped successfully 
with their pregnancy. Self-esteem, which was higher for the 
African American women in the study, was associated with 
lower levels of initial prenatal depression. For both African 
American and European American women, the women who 
showed the greatest drop in depression over the pregnancy 
had relatively more fi nancial resources, more social support, 
and fewer other life stressors (Ritter, Hobfoll, Lavin, Cam-
eron, & Hulsizer, 2000). Some level of maternal anxiety may 
be appropriately adaptive as a woman prepares to experience 
labor and delivery and to make the many changes necessary 
to care for a newborn.
Fathers’ Involvement during Pregnancy 
and Childbirth
Just like women, men have diverse reactions to the idea of 
having children. Their reproductive behaviors refl ect their 

 
The Mother, the Fetus, and the Psychosocial Environment | 113
Some men are not comfortable with the physical events 
of pregnancy, and they try to deny them by turning away 
from the mother. They do not want to feel the fetus’s move-
ments and are extremely uneasy or embarrassed by the 
pressure to understand the details of the female anatomy. 
Some men think that the fetus and then the baby threaten 
their own position with the mother, and they feel resentful 
and competitive toward the woman and the unborn infant. 
In some families, this resentment may lead to violence. For 
example, one study of low-income, urban women found 
that 38% had experienced violence from their male part-
ner during their pregnancy (O’Campo et al., 1995). Studies 
focusing on pregnant adolescents report the prevalence of 
violence from partners ranging from 16% to 41% (Kennedy, 
2006).
Trends in the United States have shifted dramatically 
toward greater involvement of fathers during labor and 
delivery (Reed, 2005). Expectant fathers often attend child-
birth classes to learn to assist their partners during the 
delivery. The father’s presence during labor and delivery is 
typically a great comfort to the pregnant woman. When the 
father is present, women tend to have shorter labors, report 
experiencing less pain, use less medication, and feel more 
positive about themselves and their childbirth experience 
(Grossman et al., 1980; Woollett & DosanjhMatwala, 1990). 
Fathers also describe their participation in the birth as a peak 
In the fi rst trimester, involved fathers are able to hear the 
fetal heartbeat amplifi ed through the Doppler. Through the 
use of ultrasound, fathers are able to visualize the developing 
fetus. During the second trimester, a father is able to make 
contact with his unborn child as he places his hand on his 
partner’s abdomen and feels the life and movement within. 
For many men, this is a time of great joy, as the prospect 
of fatherhood becomes more than abstract empathy with his 
partner’s experiences. Investment in the new life begins to 
increase as the reality of the fetus becomes more concrete. 
These times can provide the basis for a new kind of intimacy 
for the expectant couple as they begin to talk about their 
plans and hopes for the child, share their feelings about the 
pregnancy and upcoming birth, and explore their feelings 
related to assuming responsibility for the care and protection 
of their child.
Sometimes, however, the fi rst movements of the fetus 
stimulate a negative reaction in the father. In a longitudi-
nal study of men during their partner’s pregnancy and 8 
weeks after birth, men living in stepfamilies had higher 
levels of depression both before and after the birth than 
did men in more traditional families (Deater-Deckard, 
Pickering, Dunn, & Golding, 1998). A father’s depression 
may, in turn, have a negative effect on the mother, leaving 
her depressed and aware that she is without the support 
she was expecting.
Fathers are becoming increasingly involved in supporting their partner’s pregnancy and delivery. This support is 
both an important aspect of identifi cation with the father role, and a great emotional comfort to the mother.

CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. Given all the stress of the situation, what might account for 
the very positive feelings reported by Kunjufu at the mo-
ment of birth?
 2. What are some different roles that men can play during 
the childbirth process? What roles is Kunjufu playing?
 3. What might be some reasons that men do not want to be 
present during labor and delivery?
 4. How do hospital personnel infl uence the experiences of 
fathers during childbirth?
 5. How might childbirth preparation classes infl uence the ex-
periences of fathers during childbirth?
The Impact of the Pregnant 
Woman on the Fetus
Among the factors that infl uence the fetus’s development are 
the mother’s age, use of drugs during pregnancy and delivery, 
exposure to environmental toxins, and diet. The quality of a 
pregnant woman’s physical and emotional health before and 
during pregnancy is linked to her own knowledge about, 
and preparation for, pregnancy as well as to her culture’s atti-
tudes and practices associated with childbearing. One of the 
most harmful infl uences of the psychosocial environment on 
fetal development is poverty. Embedded in the conditions of 
poverty are many of the individual factors associated with 
suboptimal prenatal development.
The Impact of Poverty
Perhaps the most powerful psychosocial factor that infl u-
ences the life chances of the developing fetus is poverty 
(Lipina & Colombo, 2009). Women living in poverty are 
likely to experience the cumulative effects of many of the 
factors associated with infant mortality and developmental 
vulnerabilities. Poverty is directly linked to poor prenatal 
care. Women who live in poverty are likely to begin having 
babies at an earlier age and to have repeated pregnancies 
into their later adult years—practices that are associated 
with low birth weight. Women who have had little edu-
cation are less likely to be aware of the risks of smoking, 
alcohol, and drug use for their babies and are more likely 
to use or abuse these substances. Women living in poverty 
are less likely to have been vaccinated against some of the 
infectious diseases (e.g., rubella) that can harm the devel-
oping fetus. Poverty is linked with food insecurity, lack of 
experience. First-time fathers interviewed about their child-
birth experiences reported both positive and negative feel-
ings. These fathers felt that they were most helpful to their 
wives during labor, and they found the birth experience to 
be extremely powerful (Nichols, 1993). Nevertheless, these 
birthing experiences are commonly set in the context of a 
medical environment in which fathers are typically viewed 
as assistants. Little attention is given to their own psycho-
logical transition as fathers. Negative experiences for men 
during childbirth occur when they are unsure what their 
role is during the delivery or when hospital personnel treat 
them rudely, as a disruption, or fail to provide them with the 
information they want during the labor and delivery process 
(Johnson, 2002).
CASE STUDY
A FATHER’S RECOLLECTIONS ABOUT 
HIS DAUGHTER’S BIRTH
The sentiments of frustration and joy are captured in this de-
scription of a father’s experiences during labor and delivery. 
The text was taken from a bulletin board discussion about 
 fathers’ views of whether they should be present at their child’s 
birth on Blacknet.com, a place for dialogue and communica-
tion within the Black community of the United Kingdom.
Gonna remenise about when my fi rst child was born, I re-
member being dragged out of work on a Wednesday am be-
cause my then wife had gone into labour. Someone however 
forgot to inform me that women needed to dialate. geeez.
So after rushing to Guys hospital I’m told Baby not ready. 
Anyway I’m waiting for said wife to get big enough so to 
speak. All fl ippin day, All day man watching the paint dry.
I was like Donkey in Shrek 2 ‘Are we there yet?’ every fi ve 
minutes, then night falls I think ok, maybe it will be a night 
birth. Oh nooo, nooo such luck.
So here am i holding my wifes hand, or was that her 
squeezing the blood out of my hand. hmmm yes that was it. 
I’m giving the ’i’m in control mans‘ talk you know ’come on 
darling its ok, breath breath’ My girl is in full contractions now 
about 20 mins apart. So the top half of me is trying to be fi rm 
and calm, the bottom half is trying hard not to piss mi pants.
Then the nurse mentioned Epidural, oh my days I know i 
nearly passed out at the sight of the needle going into the 
spinal column, all the while that wretch is screaming blue 
murder in the next room. ’get it out’.
Anyway after waiting ALL day (do I still sound vex?) and 
ALL night with a hardback chair for a bed, you know I’m 
happy right? … next thing I know doctor come in approx 8:40

stirrups out of nowhere and got my wife with both legs in the 
air like she’s riding an invisable horse whilst lying on her back.
Then a whole heap of student doctors and nurses come 
into the room, and I mean a whole heap. So here’s the wife 

 
The Mother, the Fetus, and the Psychosocial Environment | 115
Mother’s Age
The capacity for childbearing begins about 1 to 1½ years 
after menarche (the beginning of regular menstrual peri-
ods) and normally ends at the climacteric, or menopause 
(the ending of regular menstrual periods). Thus, a woman 
is potentially fertile for about 35 years of her life. Pregnancy 
and childbirth can occur at various times during this period. 
The effects of childbirth on the physical and psychologi-
cal well-being of a mother vary with her age and emotional 
commitment to the mother role. Similarly, these factors also 
contribute signifi cantly to the survival and well-being of her 
infant. In later chapters, we will discuss the psychosocial 
consequences of childbearing for adolescents and adults. 
Here we simply point out that the quality of prenatal care 
and the degree of risk during childbirth are associated with 
the age of the mother during pregnancy.
Women between the ages of 16 and 35 tend to provide a 
better uterine environment for the developing fetus and to 
give birth with fewer complications than do women under 
16 or over 35. Particularly when it is their fi rst pregnancy, 
women over 35 are likely to have a longer labor than younger 
women, and the labor is more likely to result in the death of 
either the infant or the mother. As expected, the two groups 
with the highest probability of giving birth to premature 
babies are women over 35 and those under 16 (Behrman 
& Butler, 2007). In an analysis of over 180,000 deliveries, 
the risk of having a preterm delivery increased with age for 
women living in poor neighborhoods, African American 
women, and women who smoked (Holzman et al., 2009).
Mothers under 16 tend to receive less adequate prenatal 
care and to be less biologically mature. Young mothers are 
likely to engage in other high-risk behaviors including alco-
hol and drug use that have negative consequences for fetal 
development (Cornelius, 1996; Cornelius, Goldshmidt, Tay-
lor, & Day, 1999). In addition, adolescent mothers are more 
likely than older mothers to be exposed to violence in their 
communities, homes, and in the context of intimate relation-
ships, thus increasing their level of stress and an associated 
increased use of tobacco, alcohol, drugs, and antidepres-
sants, all of which can have negative consequences for the 
developing fetus (Kennedy, 2006). As a result of these inter-
acting factors, premature children of teenage mothers are 
more likely than those of older mothers to have neurological 
defects that will infl uence their coping capacities. Evidence 
suggests that good medical care, nutrition, and social sup-
port improve the childbirth experiences of adolescent moth-
ers who are over 16. However, the physical immaturity of 
those under 16 puts the mother and infant at greater risk 
even with adequate medical and social supports (Behrman & 
Butler, 2007).
A primary risk for infants of mothers who are over 40 is 
Down syndrome (Moore, 1993). It is hypothesized that the 
relatively high incidence of Down syndrome in babies born to 
older women is the result, in part, of deteriorating ova. How-
ever, older women are also likely to have male partners who 
are their age or older. Even though new sperm are produced 
safe, affordable housing, lack of health insurance, higher 
instances of infection, and higher rates of diabetes and car-
diovascular disease, which are all linked to the infant’s low 
birth weight and physical vulnerability (MacDonald, Seshia, 
& Mullett, 2005).
Many of the risks that face infants born to women who 
live in poverty are preventable. One of the Millennium 
Development Goals established under the auspices of the 
United Nations is to reduce global maternal mortality rates 
by 75% by the year 2015. A key element in achieving this 
goal is to dramatically increase the percentage of births 
attended by skilled medical personnel. Impoverished and 
rural women are currently far less likely than their wealthier 
and urban counterparts to receive skilled care during child-
birth. Inequality in access to skilled care between urban and 
rural women is especially notable in Sub-Saharan Africa 
where wealthier women are 6 times more likely to deliver 
with the assistance of skilled birth professionals than the 
poorest women (United Nations, 2006). Unfortunately, not 
much progress toward this goal has been achieved in the 
areas where the greatest inequities exist—Sub-Saharan Africa 
and southern Asia.
A well-organized, accessible system of regional medical 
care facilities combined with an effective educational pro-
gram on pregnancy and nutritional support can signifi cantly 
improve the health and vigor of babies born to women in 
poverty. One of the central themes in delivering effective 
prenatal and continuing services to women in poverty is the 
establishment of a caring relationship between the woman 
and the health care provider. This caring relationship pro-
vides emotional support to the woman, encouraging her 
to feel valued as a client, as a mother, and as an adult in 
the community (Barnard & Morisset, 1995; Massey, Rising, 
& Ickovics, 2005). Psychosocial factors linked to preterm 
births are discussed in the box that explores the rates of pre-
term births among African American and European Ameri-
can women.
Comprehensive prenatal care programs can improve birth 
outcomes even in a high-risk population. This kind of coor-
dination involves more than providing prenatal checkups 
and information about health care during pregnancy. It rec-
ognizes the complex challenges that face women in poverty, 
including violence, hazardous living conditions, poor qual-
ity services, and unstable or disruptive social relationships 
(McAllister & Boyle, 1998). Effective interventions must 
include nonmedical support services, such as making sure 
the woman has access to food stamps; is part of the Women, 
Infants, and Children (WIC) food program; has the transpor-
tation needed for prenatal and postnatal health care appoint-
ments; and receives housing assistance or job training as 
necessary. Furthermore, resources must be provided to care 
for, educate, and support children whose intellectual, physi-
cal, and emotional capabilities have been restricted before 
birth by their mothers’ poverty. The life chances and quality 
of survival of infants born in poverty are a refl ection of the 
value that a society places on social justice.

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
THE RATE OF preterm and low-birth-
weight babies has risen substantially 
from the mid-1980s to the present. 
Roughly 12.5% of all U.S. births are at 
less than 37 weeks of gestational age, 
and close to 8% have low birth weight 
(under 2500 grams). Preterm births 
and low birth weight are major causes 
of infant mortality (Behrman & Butler, 
2007). Research about the causes of 
preterm births typically focuses on 
genetic, physiological, psychological, 
and behavioral factors. Much of this 
research has found that even when 
taking into account differences in 
income, education, health behaviors, 
and access to prenatal care, African 
American women have a higher risk 
for preterm births than European 
American women.
Researchers in North Carolina 
conducted a study to determine 
whether psychosocial factors such 
as stressors experienced during 
pregnancy, social support from the 
baby’s father, perceptions of racial 
or gender discrimination, perceived 
neighborhood safety, and strategies 
for coping with stress might help 
predict preterm births (Dole et al., 
2004). The investigators examined the 
hypothesis that African American and 
European American women differ in 
the kinds of environmental stressors 
they are exposed to and in the way 
they cope with these stressors, and 
that these differences might help 
account for their different rates of 
preterm births.
Data were gathered from more 
than 1800 pregnant women, 38% of 
whom were African American. The 
study examined which psychosocial 
factors were the best predictors for 
preterm delivery in the two groups 
when controlling for age, parity 
(number of previous pregnancies), 
education, marital status, household 
income in relation to the number of 
adults and children in the  household, 
 prepregnancy body mass, and 
 prenatal care.
European American women were 
more at risk for preterm births when 
they:
• Reported a large number of nega-
tive life events during pregnancy.
• Were not living with a partner.
• Used escape or avoidance as a 
strategy for coping with problems.
• Reported living in a dangerous 
neighborhood.
African American women were 
more at risk for preterm births when 
they:
• Reported using distancing as a 
strategy to cope with problems.
• Reported high levels of racial 
 discrimination.
• Reported high levels of gender 
 discrimination.
• Reported high pregnancy-related 
anxiety.
Not only is the nature of the 
psychosocial environment different 
for African American and European 
American women in North Carolina, 
but they experience different vulner-
abilities to stress. For example, even 
though more African American than 
European American women lived 
in dangerous neighborhoods, this 
factor was a signifi cant predictor of 
having a preterm infant for European 
American women, but not for Afri-
can American women. More African 
American than European American 
women reported high levels of racial 
discrimination, and those who did 
were at greater risk for a preterm 
delivery. Escape and avoidance were 
high-risk coping strategies for Euro-
pean American women; distancing 
was a high-risk strategy for African 
American women. The implications 
of this research are that programs 
designed to prevent preterm births 
need to examine the psychosocial 
contexts of the participants and take 
into consideration racial and cultural 
differences, including different per-
ceptions of stressors and resources 
that help women cope with those 
stressors.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. The research suggests that there 
are different combinations of 
stressors that predict having a 
preterm infant for African American 
and European American women. 
What explanations can you think of 
to account for these differences?
 2. The research fi nds certain coping 
strategies are less effective than 
others in buffering stress. Escape 
and avoidance coping were more 
likely to be associated with 
preterm births for European 
American women, whereas 
distancing was associated with 
preterm births for African American 
women. What might account for 
these differences in the effectiveness 
of various coping strategies for the 
two groups?
 3. How does discrimination infl uence 
childbirth outcomes? What 
mechanisms can you think of that 
might account for this infl uence?
 4. Do you think that gender and 
race discrimination act cumulatively 
to impact childbirth outcomes? 
Why is the stress associated with 
gender discrimination a stronger 
predictor of childbirth outcomes 
for African American women 
than for European American 
women?
 5. Using the results of this research, 
what might you recommend 
regarding the development of 
pregnancy and childbirth support 
for European American and 
African American women? In 
what ways should this support 
differ for the two groups?

Psychosocial Factors Linked to Preterm Births for 
African American and European American Women

 
The Mother, the Fetus, and the Psychosocial Environment | 117
use of such drugs as alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, marijuana, 
cocaine, and other narcotics. Studies of the effects of specifi c 
drugs on fetal growth suggest that many drugs ingested by 
pregnant women are in fact metabolized in the placenta and 
transmitted to the fetus. Furthermore, although the impact 
of a specifi c dosage of a drug on the pregnant woman may 
be minimal, the impact on the fetus may be quite dramatic. 
Male-mediated effects of drugs on fetal development are also 
documented but less well publicized. Drug abuse among 
men may produce abnormalities of the sperm that can 
account for birth defects in their offspring (Pollard, 2000).
In reviewing the following sections about the impact of 
drugs on fetal development, three principles must be consid-
ered. First, evidence suggests that genetic predisposition may 
make some developing fetuses more vulnerable than others 
to the negative effects of certain drugs or toxins. Data on this 
genetic variability were derived from animal studies, because 
animals are more likely to have large litters of offspring, 
some of which show greater resilience to the presence of 
prenatal teratogens than others (O’Rahilly & Muller, 2001). 
Second, most teratogens do not have an all-or-none impact 
on the central nervous system. The consequence to the fetus 
of exposure to teratogens varies by the dosage, duration, and 
timing of exposure. A dosage that might be acceptable for the 
pregnant woman might be harmful to the developing fetus. 
Third, research is sparse on the ways that specifi c medica-
tions are metabolized during pregnancy. Because of physio-
logical changes during pregnancy, some medications may be 
metabolized so quickly that they do not treat the condition 
for which they were prescribed. In an effort to avoid harming 
the pregnant woman or the fetus, some serious conditions 
such as asthma or depression may be left untreated, thereby 
placing the pregnant woman and the fetus at risk for addi-
tional complications (Lyerly, Little, & Faden, 2009).
Nicotine. Women who smoke are at greater risk for mis-
carriages, stillbirths, preterm deliveries, low-birth-weight 
babies, and infant mortality. Children born to mothers who 
smoke are at increased risk for developing asthma. Neuro-
logical examinations of babies exposed to nicotine during 
the prenatal period showed decreased levels of arousal and 
responsiveness at 9 and 30 days after birth. Infants of smok-
ers have a 3 to 4 time greater risk of SIDS before 2 months of 
age. For mothers who smoke, 12.4% of babies are very low 
birth weight as compared to 7.7% of babies born to mothers 
who do not smoke (Pergament, 1998; ChildTrends, 2005).
Alcohol. The evidence is conclusive that alcohol is a terato-
gen. Prenatal exposure to alcohol can disrupt brain develop-
ment, interfere with cell development and organization, and 
modify the production of neurotransmitters, which are criti-
cal to the maturation of the central nervous system (Sokol, 
Delaney-Black, & Nordsstrom, 2003). The complex impact 
of alcohol on fetal development has been given the name 
fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, 2007). Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders 
daily, some evidence suggests that among older men, the rate 
of genetically defective sperm increases. Thus, aging in one 
or both partners may contribute to the increased incidence of 
Down syndrome in babies born to older women. These expla-
nations are not entirely satisfactory, however, because older 
women who have had multiple births are not as likely to have 
a baby with Down syndrome as are women who have their fi rst 
child at an older age. Moreover, many babies with Down syn-
drome are born to women who are under 35. It is likely that 
in some cases, Down syndrome is a result of errors that occur 
during cell division and that in others, it is a result of a geneti-
cally transmitted condition.
Figure 4.8 shows the rate of live births to women in the 
age range from 10 to 44 between 1960 and 2007. In every age 
range except the youngest, fewer women are having babies 
today than in the 1960s. Two other observations about the 
data presented in this fi gure are relevant to our understand-
ing of the timing of childbearing in adult life. First, since 
1960 the trend has shifted from a higher birth rate in the 
period from age 20 to 24 to a more equal birth rate during 
the full decade of the 20s and early 30s. Second, in compari-
son to the 1980s, the current trend shows a decline in the 
birth rate for women in their early 20s, and an increased rate 
of childbearing for women during their 30s and early 40s.
Maternal Drug Use
The range of drugs used by pregnant women is enormous. 
Iron, diuretics, antibiotics, hormones, tranquilizers, appetite 
suppressants, and other drugs are prescribed for or are taken 
over-the-counter by pregnant women. Furthermore, women 
influence the fetal environment through their voluntary

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
We emphasize the risks associated with prenatal exposure 
to alcohol because it is so widely used in American society 
and because even what many adults perceive to be a safe or 
socially acceptable amount of alcohol during pregnancy can 
have a negative effect on the fetus. In 2005, the U.S. Surgeon 
General advised all women who are pregnant or trying to get 
pregnant to abstain from alcohol consumption in order to 
prevent fetal exposure to alcohol. Because of discoveries that 
even minimal alcohol consumption could result in some dis-
ruption in fetal development, the old advice of limiting one’s 
alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been revised. In 
order to prevent any possible damaging effects of alcohol, 
the advice is to abstain from alcohol consumption entirely 
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007).
Caffeine. Caffeine freely crosses the placenta. It is com-
monly consumed in coffee, certain sodas, and tea. An 
estimated 200 foods and food products contain caffeine. Caf-
feine raises the heart rate and acts as a diuretic, resulting in 
loss of fl uids and the possibility of dehydration. Heavy caf-
feine consumption—defi ned in one study as more than 300 
milligrams, or roughly three cups of coffee per day—is asso-
ciated with an increased risk of low birth weight, and there is 
a modest relationship to prematurity. Babies exposed to high 
doses of caffeine have been found to have a higher heart rate, 
more startles and tremors, and are more diffi cult to soothe 
(Howell, 2005). Infants born to women who reduced the 
amount of caffeine they drank after the sixth week of preg-
nancy showed no ill effects associated with early caffeine 
consumption (Fenster, Eskenazi, Windham, & Swan, 1991; 
McDonald, Armstrong, & Sloan, 1992).
Narcotics. The use of narcotics, especially heroin and 
cocaine, as well as methadone (a drug used in the treatment 
of heroin addiction), has been linked to increased risks of 
(FASDs) is an umbrella term for the range of effects that can 
occur in an individual whose mother drank alcohol during 
pregnancy. These effects include physical, mental, behav-
ioral, and learning disabilities with possible lifelong implica-
tions. FASDs include fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), as well 
as other conditions in which individuals have some, but not 
all, of the clinical signs, which include abnormal facial fea-
tures, growth defi ciencies, and central nervous system (CNS) 
problems. People with FAS might have problems with learn-
ing, memory, attention span, communication, vision, hear-
ing, or a combination of these. These problems often lead to 
diffi culties in school and problems getting along with others. 
FAS is a permanent condition. At a rate of 0.5 to 2 infants 
affected per 1000 live births, fetal alcohol syndrome is the 
greatest source of environmentally caused developmental 
disruption in the prenatal CNS (O’Rahilly & Muller, 2001). 
For every child born with FAS, an estimated three more chil-
dren are born who suffer some of the neurological complica-
tions associated with fetal exposure to alcohol.
Fetal exposure to alcohol disrupts verbal and visual learn-
ing. In a longitudinal study of the effects of prenatal expo-
sure to alcohol, children born to mothers who consumed 1.5 
ounces of alcohol (one average-strength drink) daily dur-
ing pregnancy showed signifi cantly lower IQ scores at age 
4 than did children whose mothers used little or no alcohol 
(Streissguth, Barr, Sampson, Darby, & Martin, 1989). Alco-
hol use was a signifi cant predictor of reduced IQ scores even 
when many other factors—the mother’s educational level, the 
child’s birth order, the family’s socioeconomic level, the child’s 
involvement in preschool, and the quality of the mother-
child interaction—were taken into account. In other words, 
the many environmental variables that are known to have a 
positive effect on a young child’s intellectual functioning did 
not compensate for the disruption in development of the 
CNS associated with exposure to alcohol during pregnancy.
Both of these children show the facial 
characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome: 
eyes widespread, with an epicanthic fold; 
short nose; small midface and thin upper lip.

dilemma. Those who oppose such actions argue that alco-
hol use, smoking, and other forms of maternal behavior also 
have known negative effects on the developing fetus. Should 
women who use these legal substances also be charged with 
child abuse? Moreover, can society ensure that the babies 
taken from these mothers and placed in foster care will do 
better than they would have done in the care of their birth 
mothers? On the other hand, some argue that the state has 
the responsibility to protect the well-being of the unborn 
child, especially during the third trimester when the fetus has 
reached the point of viability. According to this view, actions 
that result in harm or death to the fetus ought to be consid-
ered child abuse and prosecuted as such (Pollack, 2000).
Prescription Drugs. Some drugs are administered to 
women during pregnancy as part of the treatment of a medi-
cal condition. The tragic outcome of the use of thalidomide 
for the treatment of morning sickness in the 1960s alerted 
society to the potential danger of certain chemicals to the 
fetus, particularly during the period of fetal differentiation 
and growth in the fi rst trimester. Thalidomide taken during 
the 21st to 36th days after conception can cause gross defor-
mities of the baby’s limbs.
Some drugs are administered to help sustain the preg-
nancy. Others are used to help control medical conditions, 
such as epilepsy or AIDS. Studies examining the dose and 
timing of these drugs suggest that they can have temporary 
or long-term consequences for neurological development, 
motor behavior, and personality (Rovet et al., 1995). The 
effects of some kinds of drugs may persist for a long time 
after birth, either by directly altering the CNS or by infl uenc-
ing the pattern of caregiver-infant interactions.
Obstetric Anesthetics. The study of the effects on the 
newborn of drugs used during delivery provides further evi-
dence of the infant’s dependence on the immediate environ-
ment. Initially, pain-relieving drugs were used for the benefi t 
and convenience of pregnant women and their physicians, 
and their effects on the newborn were not noticed. However, 
evidence suggests that the type, amount, and timing of anes-
thetic use in delivery are all factors that may induce neonatal 
depression and affect the coping capacities of newborns. The 
use of anesthetic drugs during delivery has been found to 
interfere with the infant’s ability to habituate to a stimulus 
(i.e., to stop responding after repeated presentations of the 
stimulus), to reduce the infant’s smiling and cuddliness, and 
to reduce alert responses to new stimuli. Furthermore, the 
relationship between drug use and some infant behavior has 
been observed to last as long as 28 days (Stechler & Halton, 
1982; Naulty, 1987).
Environmental Toxins
As increasing numbers of women enter the workforce and 
assume nontraditional work roles, concern about the haz-
ards of work settings for fetal development continues to 
grow. The levels of exposure to environmental toxins that 
birth defects, low birth weight, and higher rates of infant 
mortality (Howell, Heiser, & Harrington, 1999). Infants who 
have been exposed prenatally to opiates, cocaine, and meth-
adone show a pattern of extreme irritability, high-pitched 
crying that is evidence of neurological disorganization, fever, 
sleep disturbances, feeding problems, muscle spasms, and 
tremors (Bard et al., 2000). These babies are at high risk for 
SIDS. Prenatal cocaine exposure has been linked to cortisol 
reactivity, a hormone that contributes to a person’s ability to 
manage and regulate the responses to the stressors of daily 
life. Babies who were exposed to cocaine prenatally were 
observed at 7 months of age. They had elevated cortisol lev-
els, which leads to greater reactivity to stress, and disruptions 
in the ability to self-regulate. The disruptive consequences 
of cocaine exposure were more serious when the caregiving 
situation was unstable, suggesting that the infants who were 
physiologically predisposed to having diffi culties in manag-
ing arousal and stress suffered even further when they were 
not able to rely on a consistent context of care (Eiden, Veira, 
& Granger, 2009). Longer range studies found that some 
children who were exposed to addictive drugs in the pre-
natal period continued to show problems with fi ne motor 
coordination, had difficulty focusing and sustaining their 
attention, and, perhaps as a result, had more school adjust-
ment problems (Ben-Dat Fisher et al., 2007).
The longer term impact of prenatal drug exposure varies. 
Many women who use cocaine also drink alcohol and are 
malnourished and often exposed to violence and to sexually 
transmitted diseases. Thus, the impact of cocaine alone is dif-
fi cult to assess (Pollack, 2000). In one study, about one third 
of the babies exposed prenatally to cocaine showed defi cits 
in tests of motor or mental development during infancy; 
the others scored in the normal range (Cosden, Peerson, & 
Elliott, 1997). Of course, it is diffi cult to separate the direct 
prenatal effects of these drugs on the nervous system from 
the effects after birth that are associated with being parented 
by a drug-using mother (Tyler, Howard, Espinosa, & Doakes, 
1997). One study focused on the caregiving environment 
of 2-year-old children who had been prenatally exposed to 
cocaine. Those who were in nonparental caregiving environ-
ments were doing much better at age 2 with respect to physi-
cal development, cognitive and language skills, and social and 
emotional functioning than those who continued in the care 
of their cocaine-using birth mothers (Brown et al., 2004).
Because of the widespread abuse of cocaine, some law 
enforcement offi cials are arresting and charging women who 
have exposed their unborn infants to these harmful and ille-
gal substances. In 1997, a woman in South Carolina was 
charged with murder by child abuse when it was determined 
that she had smoked crack cocaine while pregnant, which 
was responsible for the death of her unborn child (“Crack-
Using Woman,” 1997). State laws have been passed that 
allow criminal charges to be fi led against women who give 
birth to babies who have illegal substances in their blood. 
Several states have tried taking babies away from these 
mothers, but this action poses an extremely diffi cult ethical

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
women. For example, several studies examined the impact 
of the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944–1945, when the Ger-
man army blockaded food supplies to the Netherlands. In a 
study of men born in the famine region during that period, 
21% were exposed to severe prenatal malnutrition for one or 
more trimesters. Malnutrition is inferred from the baby’s low 
birth weight in comparison with the baby’s gestational age 
(the age of the fetus from the time of conception until birth). 
Babies who are small for their gestational age have a higher 
mortality rate, more complications during post-delivery care, 
and a higher risk of mental or motor impairment than do 
babies who are of average weight for their gestational age. 
Prenatal malnutrition has an impact on the normal growth of 
all organs, normal organ functions, and the normal develop-
ment of the CNS. Behavioral disorders, learning disabilities, 
and certain forms of mental illness have been linked to pre-
natal malnutrition (Morgane et al., 1993; Neugebauer, Hoek, 
& Susser, 1999; Tanner & Finn-Stevenson, 2002).
One of the nutrients of grave concern because of its role 
in the maturation of the CNS is iron. Iron deficiency is a 
widespread nutrient disorder, with an estimated 20% to 25% 
of babies worldwide suffering from iron defi ciency anemia. 
Babies who have severe iron defi ciencies test lower in motor 
and cognitive development and show evidence of fearfulness, 
fatigue, and wariness. Even with postnatal iron-enriched 
treatment, these behavioral consequences have been found 
to persist. The brain uses iron to help support myelination. 
The hippocampus, which is a key brain structure that sup-
ports recognition memory, is also very sensitive to an early 
lack of iron. In the United States, pregnant women who are 
receiving prenatal care are typically given iron supplements. 
However, iron is often missing in the diet of poor women, 
and, as a result, the cognitive deficits established in the 
prenatal period when the nervous system is developing are 
likely to be compounded by lack of access to adequate nutri-
tion after birth (National Research Council and Institute of 
Medicine, 2000).
A child may be malnourished during pregnancy, after 
birth, or both. Although some growth retardation is hypoth-
esized to occur if a fetus is malnourished, the most severe 
impact on growth occurs when resources are inadequate 
both before and after the child is born. This is the case in 
many poverty stricken areas of the world. When prenatal 
malnutrition is followed by postnatal malnutrition and dis-
ease, it is impossible to study the effects of prenatal malnutri-
tion alone.
A pregnant woman’s diet can be successfully modifi ed to 
increase the newborn’s weight. Diet supplements that are 
rich in protein and high in calories appear to have the most 
positive impact (Sigman, 1995). The rate of infant mortal-
ity declined 69% for the babies born to Guatemalan women 
who were given a protein-enriched supplement (Brown & 
Pollitt, 1996). In Mexico, a longitudinal study compared 
children born to women who had received nutritional sup-
plements with those who had not, when the children were 
12 and again at 18. Those without the supplement had a 
may be considered safe or acceptable for adults may still 
have a negative impact on fetal development. Fetal exposure 
to lead, mercury, and ethanol in the workplace have been 
found to disrupt normal immune system development 
(Science Daily, 2005). Wives of men who are employed in 
hazardous environments may also experience higher rates of 
miscarriage, sterility, and birth defects in their babies. In one 
study, fathers’ exposure to specifi c solvents and chemicals at 
work was linked to higher rates of spontaneous abortions 
among their wives (Lindbohm et al., 1991). Recent research 
links men’s workplace exposure to lead to reduced sperm 
count, sperm motility, and sperm concentration, resulting in 
negative consequences for fertility. Paternal exposure to lead 
is also associated with low-birth-weight babies (Alexander 
et al., 1996; Min, Correa-Villasenor, & Stewart, 1996).
The workplace is not the only setting in which pregnant 
women may be exposed to environmental toxins. Women 
who regularly ate a large amount of polluted fi sh from Lake 
Michigan for 6 years before they became pregnant had 
infants who showed certain memory defi cits at 7 months of 
age (Jacobson, Fein, Jacobson, Schwartz, & Dowler, 1985). 
Although the level of these toxins—industrial waste prod-
ucts found in air, water, and soil—had no measurable effects 
on the mothers, it was high enough to infl uence CNS func-
tioning in the fetuses. This finding makes it clear that all 
communities must be sensitive to the quality of their water, 
air, and soil. Each new generation depends on its predeces-
sors for protection from these environmental hazards.
Mother’s Diet
The notion that no matter what the pregnant woman eats, 
the fetus will get what it needs for growth is simply not true. 
Providing adequate nutrition for fetal development requires 
both a balanced diet for the mother and the capacity to trans-
form nutrients into a form that the fetus can ingest, which 
the placenta takes care of (Tanner & Finn-Stevenson, 2002).
Because of ethical problems involved in experimentally 
modifying the diets of pregnant women, much of the research 
on the effects of maternal malnutrition on fetal development 
has been conducted with animal models, primarily rats. The 
impact of prenatal malnutrition on rats shows that when the 
mother is malnourished, fewer nutrients cross the placenta. 
The fetal brain receives comparatively more of the limited 
nutritional resources than the other organs; however, the 
CNS is disrupted. The consequences, for those fetuses that 
survive, include delayed skeletal development, impaired 
reflexes, and cognitive deficits (Galler & Tonkiss, 1998; 
Lukas & Campbell, 2000).
Many experts assert that for humans, prenatal malnutri-
tion, depending on its timing and severity, has an irreparable 
impact on CNS development and, as a result, on intellectual 
performance (Morgane et al., 1993). However, this assertion 
is diffi cult to demonstrate experimentally. Most of the data 
on the effects of malnutrition on human fetal growth have 
come from studying the impact of disasters and crises—
such as famines, wars, and extreme poverty—on pregnant 

 
The Mother, the Fetus, and the Psychosocial Environment | 121
Strong emotional reactions—such as prolonged anxiety 
or depression—may infl uence the fetal environment directly 
through the secretion of maternal hormones that cross the 
placental barrier. Research with animals has demonstrated 
that mothers’ exposure to stress during pregnancy does 
have long-term negative consequences for learning, motor 
development, and adaptive behavior in offspring (Kaiser & 
Sachser, 2009). A review of existing literature suggests that 
among humans, prenatal stress is associated with higher 
rates of spontaneous abortion, preterm labor and delivery, 
and growth delay among babies (Mulder et al., 2002). Cur-
rent studies consider the relationship between stress-related 
changes in endocrine levels during pregnancy and motor 
development, cognitive development, and immune function-
ing in babies. Research is focusing on ways in which stress-
induced physiological changes in the mother might infl uence 
fetal growth and nervous system development (Field et al., 
2003; DiPietro, 2004). 
What are the sources of stress for pregnant women that 
can have an impact on the developing fetus? Studies have 
explored the role of women’s exposure to psychosocial stress 
and racism on birth outcomes. Prenatal anxiety is higher 
among women who have a less positive outlook about their 
pregnancy, and who are undergoing a large number of chal-
lenging life events during pregnancy. In a comparison of 
European American, African American, and Latina women, 
the sources of prenatal anxiety were different for women of 
the different racial/ethnic groups. Income adequacy was the 
primary source of prenatal anxiety for European American 
women. For African American women, both childhood and 
current exposure to racism was signifi cantly related to preg-
nancy stress. For Latinas, a sense of mastery and support 
from the baby’s father were important predictors of levels 
of pregnancy stress (Dominguez et al., 2008; Gurung et al, 
2005).
Another source of stress is related to a woman’s work-
ing conditions. Although it is generally positive for women 
to be employed and to have work-related income, work-
related strain can have a negative impact on fetal develop-
ment. Women who work 32 hours a week or more early 
in their pregnancy and who are exposed to high levels of 
job strain, such as a demanding work pace, time pressures, 
expectations to do multiple tasks as once, and physically 
demanding, strenuous work are more likely to have low-
birth-weight babies or babies who are small for their ges-
tational age (Vrijkotte, van der Wal, van Eijsden, & Bonsel, 
2009).
The mother’s emotional state during pregnancy has an 
impact beyond the events of childbirth. Women who expe-
rience notable anxiety or depression during pregnancy are 
more likely to continue feeling depressed after giving birth 
and are more likely to have additional depressive symptoms 
in the 5 years following childbirth. Clinicians who focus 
on the etiology of depression in women emphasize that the 
period of pregnancy and childbirth should be a time for pre-
ventive intervention (Le, Munoz, Ippen, & Stoddard, 2003).
longer, slower period of cognitive maturity, some still show-
ing gains at age 18. However, the prenatally undernourished 
children never performed at the level of those whose moth-
ers received a supplement, even at age 18 (Chavez, Martinez, 
& Soberanes, 1995).
In order for prenatal nutritional intervention to have the 
greatest impact, it must be coupled with efforts to reduce 
the continued effects of poverty after birth. Children who 
are at risk for malnutrition are likely to experience more ill-
ness, lethargy, and withdrawal; delayed physical growth; 
and, in consequence, delayed intellectual growth. On the 
other hand, some of the negative effects of malnutrition 
can be offset if infants are adequately nourished after birth 
(Tanner, 1990). These infants show increased activity, make 
greater demands on their environment, and prompt more 
active caregiving responses (Brazelton, 1987a). This pattern 
of interaction may offset the initial defi cits resulting from an 
inadequate prenatal nutritional environment.
The many factors we have reviewed, including maternal 
age, exposure to drugs and environmental toxins, exposure 
to illnesses, and inadequate nutritional resources during 
various phases of pregnancy, can occur singly or in combina-
tion. The greater the number of risk factors the fetus encoun-
ters, the greater the chance for disruption in neurological 
and behavioral development. The concept of plasticity is 
well illustrated as we think about the impact of the many 
possible disruptive factors that can occur during the prenatal 
period. As suggested in Chapter 2 (Figure 2.6), psychosocial 
processes can contribute to growth and new resources for 
coping or to disruption and limitations on coping. Within 
the prenatal environment, a child’s genetic potential may 
encounter a supportive, healthy, optimizing environment or 
an environment in which one or more conditions place fetal 
development at risk. Even for infants who carry the genetic 
markers for anomalies, the expression of these conditions 
may be less disruptive or less severe when fetal development 
has taken place in a healthy, fully resourced uterine envi-
ronment. In contrast, even infants who would otherwise be 
healthy may suffer long-term negative consequences when 
they are exposed to a combination of teratogens and disrup-
tive uterine conditions.
Stress and Fetal Development 
A woman’s feelings about her femininity, her attitudes toward 
the unborn child, and her psychological stability are asso-
ciated with diffi culties experienced during pregnancy and 
labor. Women who have more stable personalities and a 
positive orientation toward pregnancy react more favorably 
to the stresses of labor. Anxious, irritable women are more 
likely to have longer labors and more complications dur-
ing labor and delivery. During labor and delivery, women 
who are more fearful of childbirth and who believe that the 
outcomes of childbirth are outside their own control are 
more likely to request epidural anesthesia than are women 
who had a low fear of childbirth and wanted to participate 
actively in the childbirth process (Heinze & Sleigh, 2003).

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
world. The Hmong believe that each of us has three souls—
one that enters the body when the infant is conceived, one 
that enters as the baby takes its fi rst breath during childbirth, 
and one that enters on the third day after birth. The soul-
calling ceremony secures these souls in the infant’s body and 
thus ensures the baby’s well-being (Rice, 2000).
In order to appreciate the events surrounding the birth 
of a child, one must understand some of the idiosyncrasies 
in a culture’s approach to pregnancy and birth. The beliefs, 
values, and guidelines for behavior regarding pregnancy 
and childbirth have been referred to as the birth culture 
(Scopesi, Zanobini, & Carossino, 1997; Gross & Pattison,

Julan is a Hmong, now living in Australia. She has just had a 
baby, and she and her family are preparing for the soul-calling 
ceremony on the third day after the baby’s birth. Once com-
pleted, she will feel that she has done what is needed to pro-
tect the baby and link it to its living as well as its supernatural 
BY THE CLOSE of 2008, an estimated 
15.7 million women and 2.1 million 
children were infected with HIV 
(human immunodefi ciency virus) 
worldwide (Avert.org, 2010). Almost all 
the children under the age of 10 were 
infected by their mothers, and most 
of them live in developing countries 
in Africa and Asia. Children born to 
untreated HIV-positive mothers have 
about a 25% chance of developing the 
disease. The chances of transmitting 
HIV increase to 45% when mothers 
breastfeed—a practice that is very 
common in developing countries 
(Bassett, 2001; Rosenfi eld & Figdor, 
2001; UNAIDS, 2006).
In North America and Europe, 
the transmission of HIV from mother 
to infant has decreased dramatically 
due to the availability of drugs 
administered to the mother for a few 
weeks—or once while the mother 
is in labor—and to the infant within 
3 days after birth. However, in the 
developing countries of Africa and 
Asia, where the disease is a raging 
epidemic, these effective treatments 
are almost never available. What 
accounts for this failure?
Four issues prevent the translation of 
what is known as best practice to what 
is actually done in developing countries:
 1. The costs of the medication to pre-
vent mother-to-infant transmission 
are enormous for poor countries.
 2. Voluntary counseling and testing 
are the cornerstones of  prevention 
and intervention, but many 
women are reluctant to be tested 
for HIV due to the stigmatizing 
nature of the disease. Even though 
most women are infected by their 
husbands, the testing is done on 
women, and they are blamed for 
bringing HIV into their families. 
Women who test positive may 
risk being abandoned by their 
husbands, thus losing the support 
of their families even as they face 
the future of their illness.
 3. The risk of transmission of HIV 
through breastfeeding continues 
even with the drug treatment. 
In order for women to give up 
breastfeeding, they need to be 
assured of safe water supplies 
and adequate availability of for-
mula. Otherwise, an equally large 
number of the children will die of 
 diarrhea and malnutrition.
 4. The treatment does not benefi t 
the HIV-infected women but 
prevents the spread of the dis-
ease to infants. As a result, al-
though the infants may be spared 
the disease, they are highly likely 
to become orphans of infected 
fathers and mothers. In Africa 
alone there are an estimated 14 
million children under age 18

This example illustrates the broad 
issues underlying the topic of the 
infl uence of the mother on fetal 
development. The care of mothers 
is essential to the well-being of the 
developing fetus, and the cultural, 
societal, and family contexts fi gure 
prominently in the care of mothers.

The Cultural Context of Pregnancy and Childbirth | 123
Comparisons across cultures serve only to place the Ameri-
can system in a cultural context.
Reactions to Pregnancy
Many cultures share the assumption that the behavior of 
expectant parents will infl uence the developing fetus and the 
ease or diffi culty of childbirth. Of the 64 cultures studied by 
Ford (1945), 42 prescribed certain behaviors for expectant par-
ents and prohibited others. Many such restrictions were dietary.
Among the Pomeroon Arawaks, though the killing and eat-
ing of a snake during the woman’s pregnancy is forbidden to 
both father and mother, the husband is allowed to kill and 
eat any other animal. The cause assigned for the taboo of the 
snake is that the little infant might be similar, that is, able 
neither to talk nor to walk. (Roth, 1953, p. 122)
In many Asian, Mediterranean, and Central and South 
American cultures, pregnancy is believed to be affected by 
the balance of hot and cold foods in a woman’s diet. Pregnant 
2007). The decision to have a child, the social and physi-
cal experiences of pregnancy, the particular style of help that 
is available for the delivery of the child, and the care and 
attitudes toward both mother and baby after delivery are all 
components of the birth culture. Not everyone in a cultural 
group adheres to the full script of the birth culture, but at 
the very least, these guidelines are part of the mythology or 
lore that surfaces as a woman and her partner experience the 
events of pregnancy. The transmission of AIDS from mother 
to fetus and the challenges associated with effective interven-
tion are discussed in the box on the prior page.
Information about approaches to pregnancy and child-
birth in traditional cultures are drawn primarily from the 
Human Relations Areas Files (Murdock & White, 1969) and 
from Ford’s (1945) comparison of reproductive behavior in 
64 cultures. In most traditional societies, men and nontribal 
women are not allowed to observe delivery. Furthermore, 
many of the events related to conception and delivery are 
considered too personal or private to discuss with outsiders. 
Thus, the data on childbearing practices are not complete. 
SOME CULTURES OBSERVE the 
formal practice of couvade, in which 
the expectant father takes to his bed 
and observes very specifi c taboos 
during the period shortly before birth. 
Among the Arapesh of New Guinea, 
childbearing is believed to place as 
heavy a burden and drain of energy 
on the father as on the mother. Some 
cultures believe that by following the 
ritual of couvade, fathers distract the 
attention of evil spirits, so that the 
mother and baby can go through 
the childbirth transition more safely 
(Helman, 1990).
Even in groups that do not practice 
the ritual of couvade, it is common to 
fi nd expectant fathers experiencing 
some couvade symptoms, such as 
general fatigue, stomach cramps, 
nausea, dizziness, or backache. 
Symptoms often begin toward the end 
of the fi rst trimester, are noticeable 
again toward the end of pregnancy, 
and end with childbirth (Klein, 1991).
Couvade is a crisis of faith—the faith 
a man has in his ability to face the 
unknown. As the wife increaseth, the 
husband decreaseth. In his despair, 
he is at the bottom of the barrel of 
his manhood. There he gropes for 
something new in his composition to 
help him to cope; and what he fi nds is 
something very, very old—an ancient 
technique to help man survive this 
very normal but very upsetting ordeal.
Ancient tools, ancient tricks, 
ancient masks. What he discovers is 
that modern man and ancient man, 
different as button-down and buckskin, 
are quite alike in one respect—they 
both value their security, and are both 
threatened when their manly armor 
starts to crack. (Finley, 1984)
Trethowan (1972), one of the fi rst 
to document the nature and extent 
of couvade symptoms in the normal 
population, suggested that these 
physical symptoms are the product 
of a man’s emotional ambivalence 
toward his wife during her pregnancy. 
The expectant father may experience 
empathy and identify with his wife’s 
pregnant state. At the same time, 
he may experience some jealousy 
of his wife, resentment of the loss 
or potential loss of intimacy in their 
relationship, repulsion by his wife’s 
physical appearance, or some envy 
of his wife’s ability to bear a child. 
These psychological confl icts, many 
of which are probably unconscious 
or unexpressed, are amplifi ed by an 
expectant father’s conscious worries 
about the health and well-being of his 
wife and their baby. The combination 
of these stresses may produce the 
couvade syndrome.

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
for both men and women. Once menstruation stops, the 
husband and the wife believe that they must copulate repeat-
edly in order to provide the building materials for the fetus’s 
semen and blood. Many cultures teach that during preg-
nancy, the woman and the fetus are more readily exposed to 
evil spirits. In several cultures, the forces of life and death are 
thought to be engaged in a particularly intense competition 
for the mother and the fetus around the time of delivery. See 
the box that discusses the Korean beliefs called Taegyo that 
assumes that the fetus is able to feel what the mother feels.
Solicitude versus shame and adequacy versus vulner-
ability are two dimensions that create a matrix within which 
the birth culture of any society or subculture can be located. 
Within this framework, pregnancy may be viewed as a time 
of great rejoicing or a time for caution and privacy; a time 
for feeling sexually powerful or extremely vulnerable. One 
might describe the U.S. medical birth culture, for example, 
as being characterized by solicitude and vulnerability. Preg-
nant women are usually treated with increased concern and 
care and are often placed in a medical system that increases 
their sense of dependency. Attitudes in the workplace also 
contribute to the sense of vulnerability when pregnancy is 
viewed as incompatible with serious dedication to the job.
In the United States, both men and women apply expec-
tations of a sick role to pregnant women. This idea includes 
the view that pregnant women should not exert themselves 
and are excused from certain obligations; that they need spe-
cial care and should seek out medical expertise to meet these 
health care needs; that they should do whatever is necessary 
to comply with the health recommendations of experts; and 
that their moodiness, irritability, or other symptoms are for-
given because these symptoms are attributed to their preg-
nant state (Myers & Grasmick, 1990).
Reactions to Childbirth
Childbirth is an important event in most societies, marked 
by the presence of specially designated attendants, a speci-
fi ed location, and certain ceremonies and rituals intended to 
support the miraculous emergence of the newborn into the 
society (Dundes, 2003). In traditional societies, the delivery 
is usually attended by two or more assistants with specifi c 
assigned roles. Traditional birth attendants are found in all 
areas of the world. They are usually women who have had 
children themselves and are respected members of their 
community. In Jamaica, the nana, or midwife, is one of the 
key fi gures in the village. She is called on to assist in many 
family crises. During pregnancy and childbirth, the nana 
provides assistance in the many rituals and taboos that mark 
the rebirth of the woman as a mother, and she usually cares 
for the mother and the infant until the ninth day after birth 
(Kitzinger, 1982).
In most traditional cultures, childbirth takes place in a 
familiar setting, either at home or in a nearby birthing hut. 
If the birth takes place at home, a woman may be separated 
from others by a curtain for privacy, but she knows that her 
women are advised to avoid both very hot foods, such as 
chili peppers and salty or fatty foods, and very cold foods, 
such as acidic, sour, or cold fresh foods (Hahn & Muecke, 
1987).
A culture’s view of pregnancy determines the kinds and 
severity of the symptoms associated with it, the types of 
treatment or medical assistance sought during pregnancy, 
and the degree to which pregnancy is responded to as a life 
stressor. Attitudes toward pregnant women can be charac-
terized along two dimensions: (1) solicitude versus shame 
and (2) adequacy versus vulnerability (Mead & Newton, 
1967). A syndrome of fathers’ reactions to a wife’s pregnancy, 
called couvade, is discussed in the box on the prior page.
Solicitude versus Shame
Solicitude toward the pregnant woman is shown in the care, 
interest, and help of others. For example, it is said among 
Jordon villagers that “as people are careful of a chicken in 
the egg, all the more so should they be of a child in its moth-
er’s womb” (Grandquist, 1950). As the Chagga in Africa say, 
“Pay attention to the pregnant woman! There is no one more 
important than she” (Guttmann, 1932).
At the other end of this spectrum are the cultures that 
convey shame through their practices. They keep pregnancy 
a secret as long as possible. This custom may stem from a 
fear that damage will come to the fetus through supernatu-
ral demons or from shyness about the sexual implications of 
pregnancy.
Societies that demonstrate solicitude increase the care 
given to the pregnant woman and fetus. These attitudes 
emphasize the importance of birth as a mechanism for 
replenishing the group, and additional resources are likely 
to be provided to the pregnant woman. By keeping the preg-
nancy a secret, cultures that instill a sense of shame in the 
woman do not promote the health of the mother or the fetus 
and may not encourage couples to have children.
Adequacy versus Vulnerability
In many societies, pregnancy is a sign of sexual prowess 
and a means of access to social status. Some cultures do not 
arrange a wedding until after the woman has become preg-
nant. In a polygynous family—one in which a man has more 
than one wife—the pregnant wife receives the bulk of her 
husband’s attention and may prevent her husband from tak-
ing an additional wife (Grandquist, 1950). In some cultures, 
women are considered more attractive after they have borne 
children. “Thus, the Aymara widow of South America with 
many children is regarded as a desirable bride” (Tichauer, 
1963). “Lepcha men consider that copulation with women 
who have borne more than one child is more enjoyable and 
less exhausting than with other adult women” (Gorer, 1938).
The other end of this continuum is the view that child-
making is exhausting, pregnant women are vulnerable, and 
women grow more frail with each pregnancy. Among the 
Arapesh of New Guinea (Mead, 1935), pregnancy is tiring

for a month after giving birth so that the baby will not “fall 
apart,” and that the new mother must not have sexual inter-
course for 100 days (Stringfellow, 1978).
A slightly more positive orientation toward childbirth is 
to identify it as a sickness. This view causes a pregnant Cuna 
Indian woman to visit her medicine man for daily medica-
tion. The midpoint of this spectrum—what we might most 
appropriately describe as natural childbirth—is a setting 
in which the mother delivers her baby in the presence of 
many members of the community, without much expres-
sion of pain and with little magic or obstetrical mechanics. 
Clark and Howland (1978) described childbirth for Samoan 
women as follows:
The process of labor is viewed by Samoan women as a nec-
essary part of their role and a part of the life experience. 
Since the baby she is producing is highly valued by her cul-
ture, the mother’s delivery is also commendable and there-
fore ego-satisfying. Pain relief for labor may well present 
the patient with a confl ict. She obviously experiences pain 
family members are close at hand. Women typically give 
birth standing, squatting, or sitting and reclining against 
something or someone. The Western birth custom of lying 
on one’s back with one’s feet propped up in the air has no 
counterpart in traditional birth cultures, nor are women 
expected to be moved from one setting or room to another 
during the phases of labor (Helman, 1990). That appears 
to be a ritual reserved for women in modern, industrialized 
societies. Views about the birth itself range from an extreme 
negative pole, where birth is seen as dirty and defi ling, to an 
extreme positive pole, where it is seen as a personal achieve-
ment. The view of childbirth as a normal physical event is 
the midpoint on this continuum.
When birth is viewed as dirty, as it is by the Arapesh of 
New Guinea and the Kadu Gollas of India, the woman must 
go to an area away from the village to deliver her child. Many 
cultures, such as that of the ancient Hebrews, require exten-
sive purifi cation rituals after childbirth. Vietnamese villagers 
believe that mothers should not bathe or shampoo their hair 
THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION of 
Korean prenatal care practices was 
written by a Korean woman who 
delivered her fi rst child in Korea 
and her second in the United States 
while her husband was in graduate 
school. She struggled with her own 
ambivalence about whether the 
traditional Korean practices were 
restrictive superstitions or valuable 
wisdom. Writing this research paper 
about her own culture helped 
her clarify the place of traditional 
practices in her modern world.
Taegyo has a long history. I could eas-
ily fi nd its history and the contents 
transmitted from generation to gen-
eration through literature and folklore 
on several Korean websites. Taegyo 
dates from the Koryo dynasty (918–
1392 A.D.) in Korea. The old Korean 
literary works, such as Taegyohunnyo, 
 Taegyosingi, Kyuhabchongseo, and 
Donguibogam provide mental and 
attitudinal guides for pregnant 
women. The most important point 
is the behavior of pregnant women; 
there are guides for maintaining 
the emotional stability of pregnant 
women, including having good car-
riage; guides for clothes, for promot-
ing pregnant women’s health, the 
prohibition of certain foods and 
medicines, and so on. In addition, 
paternal Taegyo has been considered 
important from old traditional times until 
now because it is believed to signifi cantly 
infl uence the physical and psychological 
condition of the baby as well.
According to Taegyosingi, which 
was written in the Chosun dynasty 
(1392–1910) and became the foremost 
guide for fetal education, pregnant 
women need peaceful and comfortable 
surroundings and special care from 
other family members. It also recom-
mends that pregnant women read 
good literature, follow the teaching 
of sages, look at good pictures, listen 
to good stories, and eat beautifully 
shaped foods with vivid colors. There 
are also many prohibited points: not 
to sleep with your husband; not to 
take any medications without caution; 
not to sit in cold or dirty places; not to 
go outside when it is dark, windy, or 
rainy; not to wash with cold water; not 
to sleep on your stomach; not to sleep 
after eating too much; not to whisper; 
not to lie or deceive; not to use 
abusive language. These prohibitions 
are based on the belief that the fetus 
feels exactly what the mother feels; 
thus pregnant women should be 
careful in everyday life, and listen and 
speak good things and behave and 
think properly (Kim, 2002).

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
doctor is a big fan of induction which is not my cup of tea. 
(Childbirthconnection.org, 2007)
It is reasonable to speculate that events at the time of the 
birth infl uence the mother’s feelings about herself and her 
parenting ability. Efforts by the community—especially fam-
ily members, close friends, and health care professionals—to 
foster a woman’s competence in, and control of, parenting 
and to express care and support for her seem to promote a 
woman’s positive orientation toward herself and her moth-
ering role. On the other hand, messages of social rejection, 
doubts about a woman’s competence, and attempts to take 
away control or to isolate the mother from her infant or social 
support system may undermine the woman’s self-esteem 
and interfere with her effectiveness as she approaches the 
demanding and exhausting task at hand (Dunkel- Schetter, 
Sagrestano, Feldman, & Killingsworth, 1996).
The population of the United States is increasingly diverse, 
and attention must be given to understanding the variety of 
cultural norms affecting the pregnant woman and her family 
support system. For example, research on the birth settings 
in hospitals in the United States, Germany, France, and Italy 
found that each country had a somewhat different focus on 
the woman’s ability to have control over the birth process, 
the types of emotional and technical support provided, the 
availability of childbirth preparation classes, and the focus 
given to mother-child and father-child bonding in each set-
ting (Scopesi, Zanobini, & Carossino, 1997). Other studies of 
immigrants giving birth in a new country emphasize problems 
of communication between women, their families, and the 
childbirth professionals that undercut the woman’s sense of 
as demonstrated by skeletal muscle response, tossing and 
turning, and fi xed body positions, but her culture tells her 
that she does not need medication. It is the “spoiled” palagi 
[Caucasian] woman who needs pain-relieving drugs. More-
over, the culture clearly dictates that control is expected 
of a Samoan woman, and no overt expressions of pain are 
permissible. (p. 166)
At the most positive end of the scale, birth is seen as a 
proud achievement. Among the Ila of Northern Zimbabwe, 
women attending childbirth were observed to shout praises 
of the woman who had a baby. They all thanked her, saying, 
“I give thanks to you today that you have given birth to a 
child” (Mead & Newton, 1967, p. 174).
A similar sentiment is expressed in Marjorie Karmel’s 
(1983) description of the Lamaze method of childbirth:
From the moment I began to push, the atmosphere of the 
delivery room underwent a radical transformation. Where 
previously everyone had spoken in soft and moderate tones 
in deference to my state of concentration, now there was a 
wild encouraging cheering section, dedicated to spurring 
me on. I felt like a football star, headed for a touchdown. 
(pp. 93–94)
The American view of childbirth seems to be evolving 
toward an emphasis on safety for mother and child, and con-
venience. In comparison with the medical practices of the 
1940s and 1950s, there is greater involvement of fathers 
or other birth coaches during labor and delivery, and more 
immediate contact between newborns and their parents. 
There are more opportunities for the baby to spend much 
of the day with the mother and for siblings to visit. Hospi-
tal stays are typically shorter. Many hospitals have affi liated 
birth centers that provide a more home-like environment, 
where fewer technical interventions are used, and where the 
birth is attended by a midwife or obstetrical nursing team.
At the same time, couples are advised that the best way to 
promote the healthy development and safe delivery of their 
child is to make early and regular visits to their obstetrician 
during the prenatal period, to attend childbirth instructional 
classes, to observe restrictions in diet and use of drugs, and 
to avoid exposure to certain environmental hazards that 
may harm the fetus. In the United States, 99% of births take 
place in hospitals or hospital-affi liated centers, and 91% are 
attended by physicians (BabyCenter.com, 2007). Despite the 
fact that the overwhelming majority of women giving birth 
are healthy and could expect an uncomplicated birth, over 
half of women surveyed in 2006 experienced an induced 
labor or cesarean delivery, thereby exposing themselves and 
their babies to a variety of drugs and surgical interventions 
that bypass spontaneous labor (Declercq, Sakala, Corry, & 
Applebaum, 2006).
I had a lot of pressure from the nursing staff to take Pitocin 
and to have an epidural. I felt like the birth experience was 
severely impacted by this pressure, as if the most important 
thing to the nurses was for me to have the baby quickly. My

Abortion | 127
The Legal Context of Abortion in 
the United States
At the heart of the abortion controversy in the United States 
is the confl ict between society’s responsibility to protect the 
rights of a woman and its responsibility to protect the rights 
of an unborn child. On one side are those who insist that a 
woman has the right to privacy and the right to choose or 
reject motherhood. On the other side are those who seek to 
protect the rights of the unborn fetus, which is incapable of 
protecting its own interests. Some argue that this is a false 
dichotomy and that we cannot truly separate the well-being 
of the mother and unborn fetus.
A major point requiring defi nition in the abortion contro-
versy is the developmental age at which the embryo is consid-
ered an individual and thus entitled to protection by the state. 
In 1973, in the case of Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court 
proposed a developmental model to address that issue. The 
court supported the division of pregnancy into three trimesters 
and considered abortion a woman’s right in the fi rst trimes-
ter, guarded by the U.S. Constitution’s protection of privacy. 
The court said that in the second trimester, some restrictions 
could be placed on access to abortion because of its risk to the 
mother; however, the fetus’s rights were still not an issue during 
this period. In the fi nal trimester, when the fetus was regarded 
as having a good chance of surviving outside the uterus, states 
could choose not to permit abortion. This ruling endorsed a 
woman’s right to full control over the abortion decision until 
the fetus reached a point of developmental viability. At that 
point, the Court ruled, society’s responsibility to the unborn 
child outweighs the woman’s right to freedom and privacy.
In the years since the Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme 
Court has ruled unconstitutional the state laws that tried to 
regulate abortions. However, by the year 2001, the states had 
a wide range of regulations, some permitting and others pro-
hibiting restrictions of various types. The main areas where 
restrictions have been imposed are as follows: restrictions 
on abortion after a specifi ed point related to fetal  viability, 
abortion reporting requirements, clinic access, parental 
involvement, mandatory delay and state-directed counseling, 
restrictions on insurance coverage of abortion, state funding 
of abortion for Medicaid recipients, partial-birth abortion 
bans, and restrictions on later abortions. For details about 
the restrictions that apply in each state, visit the website of 
the Guttmacher Institute, www.guttmacher.org.
In general, courts have ruled that states ought not to 
impose an undue burden on a woman by placing major 
obstacles in her way if she seeks an abortion before the fetus 
has reached viability. However, many states require counsel-
ing and informed consent, often with a mandatory waiting 
period, before the abortion can be performed. Restrictions 
also focus on the requirement for minors to get parental con-
sent before having an abortion. Most states require reporting 
from physicians who perform abortions. At present, women 
are not required to have the consent of their husbands or the 
child’s father before having an abortion.
confi dence and control. Immigrant women are especially dis-
tressed by behaviors that they perceive to be unkind, rushed, 
or unsupportive during their labor and delivery (Small, Rice, 
Yelland, & Lumley, 1999). Efforts are needed to interpret 
the key elements of the birth culture for women who are not 
 familiar with it, so that they may understand and possibly rein-
terpret those aspects that appear disrespectful or threatening.
APPLIED TOPIC
Abortion
Objective 7: To analyze abortion from a psychosocial 
perspective, including the legal context, its social and 
emotional impact on women, and men’s views.
Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy before the fetus 
is able to live outside the uterus. Each year, thousands of 
pregnancies are terminated through spontaneous abortion, 
usually referred to as miscarriage. However, the focus of 
this section is on the voluntary termination of pregnancy. In 
obstetrical practice, abortions are induced differently before 
and after 12 weeks of gestation. Before 12 weeks, the preg-
nancy is aborted by dilating the cervix and then removing 
the contents of the uterus by suction with a vacuum aspi-
rator or by scraping out the uterus. After 12 weeks, abor-
tion can be induced by the injection of a saline solution or of 
prostaglandin, which stimulates labor. The fetus may also be 
removed surgically by a procedure similar to a cesarean sec-
tion (Cunningham et al., 2001).
A nonsurgical approach to abortion, sometimes referred 
to as medical abortion, was developed in France in 1988 
with the drug RU-486, now called mifepristone. This drug 
interrupts pregnancy by interfering with the synthesis and 
circulation of progesterone (Baulieu, 1989). When combined 
with doses of prostaglandin, it is found to be 92% effective if 
taken within the fi rst 49 days after the last menstrual period. 
It causes the uterine lining to slough off, so there is no need 
for vacuum aspiration or surgical intervention (Planned 
Parenthood, 2000). Administration of mifepristone typically 
requires several clinic visits. If expulsion is not complete by 
the third visit, a surgical abortion is required. Studies fi nd 
that 1 woman out of 100 using the drug is still pregnant at 
12 days, and 2 to 4 out of 100 have had incomplete abor-
tions (“How RU-486 Works,” 1997). The drug was approved 
by the FDA in the United States in 2000 to be prescribed 
by a physician who can make a referral to a hospital or sur-
geon should a surgical abortion be required (“Congress and 
RU-486,” 2001). Medical abortions using mifepristone have 
increased each year since 2000 when it was fi rst distributed 
in the United States. In many countries of Europe and the 
United Kingdom, where mifepristone has been available for 
a longer time, medical abortions are increasingly common in 
the fi rst 9 weeks of pregnancy (Guttmacher Institute, 2007).

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
of the abortions were performed at less than 9 weeks gesta-
tion for unmarried women, a majority of whom had no prior 
abortions. Roughly one in fi ve abortions were performed for 
women who had experienced two or more prior abortions.
The Psychosocial Impact of Abortion
What do we know about the impact of abortions on women? 
Are abortions medically risky? How do women cope emo-
tionally with the experience of abortion? In 1965, 20% of 
all deaths associated with pregnancy and childbirth were 
linked to abortion. Since the legalization of abortion, 
 abortion-related deaths for women have decreased dramati-
cally. The risk of death associated with abortion between 
1993 and 1997 was 0.6 per 100,000 abortions, making it 
one of the safest surgical procedures in the United States. For 
comparison, the risk of maternal death from childbirth was 
6.7 per 100,000 deliveries. Legal abortion, especially before 
12 weeks, was over 10 times safer physically than carrying 
a pregnancy to term (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 
2002).
Although the physical risks of abortion are less than those 
associated with childbirth, this still leaves unanswered ques-
tions about the emotional or psychological risks. Current 
research on the emotional and mental health consequences 
of abortion continues to be challenged with methodologi-
cal criticisms and inconsistent fi ndings (Cougle, Reardon, & 
Coleman, 2005; Schmiege & Russo, 2005). Methodological 
questions include the following:
 1. What are some differences between women who have 
had abortions and are willing to participate in research 
and those who are not?
The Incidence of Legal Abortions
The number of reported legal abortions in the United States 
increased dramatically after the Roe v. Wade decision, from 
745,000 in 1973 to 1,554,000 in 1980 (U.S. Census Bureau, 
1999). Since then, the trend has been a decline in the num-
ber of abortions and in the ratio of abortions to live births. A 
report from the Alan Guttmacher Institute placed the num-
ber of abortions in 2005 at 1,206,000 with an abortion ratio 
of 19.4 abortions per 1000 women ages 14 to 44, which is 
the lowest abortion ratio in the United States since 1975 
(Guttmacher Institute, 2008). This decline is attributed to 
a number of factors, including changes in attitudes toward 
abortion, decline in access to abortion clinics, more effec-
tive contraceptive use, and a resulting decline in the num-
ber of unwanted pregnancies especially among adolescents. 
The public controversy and acts of violence at abortion clin-
ics have had an impact on the number of facilities that per-
form abortions and on the training of physicians. One report 
found that fi rst-trimester abortion education is a routine part 
of the training in only 46% of obstetrics and gynecology resi-
dency programs. In fact, 87% of U.S. counties do not have 
abortion facilities (Guttmacher Institute, 2008).
Some of the characteristics of U.S. women who had 
legal abortions in 2005 are summarized in Table 4.4. The 
data suggest that women who have abortions come from a 
variety of socioeconomic, developmental, and family con-
texts. Based on this diversity, one can assume that women 
have different reasons for having an abortion. The age group 
from 20 to 24 years old had the highest rate of abortions 
(32.8% of all abortions), followed by those from 25 to 29 
(23.7% of all abortions) and 15 to 19 (16.2% of all abor-
tions). White women had 54.9% of all legal abortions. Most 
The abortion controversy continues 
to highlight the social, political, reli-
gious, and cultural signifi cance of the 
prenatal period. What do you see 
as the eventual resolution of this 
controversy in the United States?

CASE STUDY
KAREN AND DON
The decision about giving birth to an infant with severe 
 genetic anomalies.
A young couple, whom we will call Karen and Don, wanted 
to start a family but were troubled by a puzzling coinci-
dence. A few years before, Don’s sister had given birth to a 
daughter with abnormalities that matched a pattern in Don’s 
younger brother: a heart defect, a double thumb, a club 
foot, and  severe mental retardation. One child like this in the 
family could be attributed to “accident” or “fate,” thought 
the couple, but two could not.
 Karen and Don went to a human genetics clinic and began 
a process of discovery. With the help of a counselor, they con-
structed a family tree . . . identifi ed potential carriers of the 
disorder in Don’s family, and persuaded them to get a blood 
test. Don’s test confi rmed the young couple’s worst fear: He 
was a carrier and potential children were at risk. . . .
The impact of these discoveries on Don’s family was pro-
found. When blood testing revealed that his mother was not 
a carrier, she was relieved of a burden of guilt she had se-
cretly carried for years. She had always thought that she was 
the cause of her son’s and her granddaughter’s abnormali-
ties. The same information implicated Don’s father; his reac-
tion to it can be gauged by his refusal to have a blood test. 
Don’s sister, who had just given birth to a normal child, had 
a tubal ligation. Don himself fell into guilty silence. Not only 
was he the carrier of a genetic defect, he was disappointing 
his wife, who desperately wanted to have a baby. He thought 
of artifi cial insemination, rejected the idea, and came close 
to abandoning altogether the idea of having children. Then, 
suddenly and surprisingly, after beginning to look into adop-
tion, Karen discovered she was pregnant. …
Now the process of discovery was extended one genera-
tion down, as Karen underwent amniocentesis to determine 
the status of her unborn fetus. … Karen’s mother … would 
not tolerate abortion. “She kept saying, ‘There is no way that 
you will terminate your pregnancy if you get bad news. There 
is just no way.’ She didn’t tell anyone I was pregnant.” … 
A process of intervention began for Karen and Don when 
amniocentesis revealed that theirs was to be a child with se-
vere abnormalities. “Maybe I should go ahead and have the 
child,” she remembered thinking, “because it could be the 
only one I’ll ever have.” But they had already decided under 
what conditions they would terminate their pregnancy. “If 
the fetus had been a carrier, then we were going to go ahead 
and go full term and have the child. But we did not want to 
have a child that we knew would have physical deformities 
and be mentally retarded.” They had to inform their families 
of their intentions, and that included Karen’s mother. “When 
we called and said, ‘It’s bad news and I’m terminating the 
pregnancy,’ she just couldn’t believe it.”

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
roughly 30% of women experience some emotional distress 
as they look back on their decision (Bradshaw & Slade, 
2003). 
Several factors are associated with a positive abortion 
outcome (Alter, 1984; Miller, 1992). Women who have an 
androgynous gender identity—that is, a fl exible view of both 
masculine and feminine characteristics—report less sense 
of loss, less anxiety, fewer physical symptoms, and fewer 
thoughts about death than other women (androgyny is dis-
cussed further in Chapter 10). These women tend to have a 
less traditional gender role orientation and expect to fi nd a 
variety of sources of satisfaction in their lives in addition to 
or instead of childrearing.
Women differ in the reasons they give for having an abor-
tion. In one study, 80 Norwegian women were interviewed at 
10 days, 6 months, and 2 years after their abortion. Some of 
the reasons they gave as most important for the decision to 
have an abortion were: education, job, fi nances, being tired 
and worn out, having enough children, the partner does not 
want children, and pressure from the male partner to have 
an abortion. At 6 months and 2 years, the strongest predictor 
of women’s emotional distress associated with the abortion 
was feeling pressure from their partners to have the abortion. 
Women who said they had enough children had somewhat 
better psychological outcomes at 2 years than others (Broen, 
Moum, Bodtker, & Ekeberg, 2005).
Another factor related to post-abortion adjustment 
is a woman’s views about the acceptability of abortion 
within the cultural context of her family’s and community’s 
beliefs (Wang & Buffalo, 2004). Not surprisingly, women 
who believe that abortion is an acceptable solution to an 
unwanted pregnancy and that abortion is also acceptable 
to their friends, family, and partner are less likely to experi-
ence strong feelings of regret or emotional upset following 
an abortion. Religious beliefs, childbearing motives, and the 
woman’s awareness of community opinions influence her 
own attitudes toward abortion.
Even though abortions can be associated with positive 
feelings of having taken control of one’s destiny, one must not 
overlook the negative reactions that some women face. For 
women whose support systems do not sanction abortion, the 
decision to have an abortion is likely to be associated with 
strong negative emotions. Lemkau (1988) reviewed clinical 
cases in which abortion produced strong, unresolved nega-
tive emotions. Sometimes, when a genetic anomaly is dis-
covered in the fetus, abortion is performed late in pregnancy. 
A woman who has already become attached to the fetus 
grieves for her loss. In other second-trimester abortions, the 
ambivalence that caused the delay in the decision to have 
an abortion is exaggerated by the physical discomfort associ-
ated with a later abortion. Some women discover that they 
are unable to conceive after an abortion, and guilt, anger, 
and regret surface. Women who are divorced, separated, or 
widowed at the time of an abortion appear to be more vul-
nerable to strong negative emotional reactions (Speckhard & 
Rue, 1992).
Karen’s abortion was no easy matter for her. “It’s not like 
I just lost the baby, I had a miscarriage. I willfully went in and 
terminated a pregnancy, and it was hard for people to deal 
with it. Some people think it was the kind of thing … you go 
in and you’re knocked out and you wake up and you’re not 
pregnant anymore. And that’s not the way it was at all. They 
induced labor, and I was in labor for ten hours, and I deliv-
ered a child. I was awake. My mother called to fi nd out how 
I was doing afterward, but then dropped the subject. When 
I went back to work, everyone acted like things should be 
normal, like nothing had ever happened, and I was defi nitely 
mourning.

CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. Try to put yourself in the roles of the main characters in 
this case: Karen, Don, Karen’s mother, Don’s mother, Don’s 
father. How might you react?
 2. How does technology enter into the case?
 3. How are the biological, psychological, and societal  
systems involved in understanding the issues faced by 
Karen and Don?
 4. How might Karen and Don’s marital relationship be 
 infl uenced by these experiences?
 5. What are the ethical considerations in this case?
 6. In what ways do cultural issues related to pregnancy, child-
birth, and abortion come into play in this case? How might 
a couple living in a different cultural context approach this 
situation differently?
Findings of a task force convened by the American Psy-
chological Association on Mental Health and Abortion 
reviewed numerous studies. After evaluating their method-
ological strengths and weaknesses, the task force reached 
the following conclusions: The majority of women who 
 terminate their pregnancy through a legal, first-trimester 
abortion do not have any mental health problems. There 
is no systematic causal association between abortion his-
tory and mental health problems. The risks of mental health 
problems associated with the fi rst trimester termination of an 
unwanted pregnancy are about the same as risks for  mental 
health problems among women who deliver an unwanted 
child (Major, Appelbaum et al., 2009).
The typical emotional reactions of women who have had 
abortions are relief at having taken control over one’s situ-
ation by ending an unwanted pregnancy, and regret over 
the loss (Lemkau, 1988; Elias, 1998; Zucker, 1999). In a 
study of more than 400 women 2 years after they had an 
abortion, 70% felt they had made the right decision. Espe-
cially when the pregnancy was unwanted and the abortion 
was performed within the fi rst 12 weeks, women generally 
resolve any negative feelings and thoughts they may have 
had soon after the abortion (Adler et al., 1990). However,

their relationship with the baby’s mother. For young fathers, 
issues of secrecy and consideration for the girlfriend may 
prevent them from seeking support for their own feelings 
(Maloy & Patterson, 1992; Thomas & Striegel, 1994–1995; 
Holmberg & Wahlberg, 2000).
Men clearly infl uence the abortion decision. Research on 
men’s infl uences on women’s reproductive health suggests 
that women are concerned about their partner’s attitudes, 
especially if they think that having a child or not having a 
child might result in abandonment (Dudgeon & Inhorn, 
2004). Abuse by a partner may be one reason women choose 
to have an abortion. Women who believe that their partner 
will love them and their unborn child are more likely to give 
birth. However, most of the research on the role of men in 
the abortion decision is based on what women say about 
how they have taken their partner into account in reaching 
their decision. More research is needed to learn what shapes 
men’s reactions to unintended pregnancy, their attitudes 
about abortion, how men contribute to the abortion deci-
sion, and how abortion experiences may infl uence a man’s 
future approach to sexual relationships and paternity. This 
research needs to be approached from a cultural perspective, 
recognizing the dynamic interplay of gender roles, family 
structure, and religious and ethnic values.
The debate surrounding the legalization and availability 
of abortion services is an excellent example of a psycho-
social controversy. Embedded in this controversy are key 
human development issues: When does human life begin? 
When is a fetus viable—that is, capable of life outside the 
uterus? What is society’s responsibility to unborn children? 
To women of childbearing age? What is the impact of an 
abortion on a woman’s physical health, psychological well-
being, and future childbearing? What is the impact of bear-
ing and rearing an unwanted child on a woman’s physical 
health and psychological well-being? What is the impact 
of being an unwanted child? What are the rights of fathers 
with respect to a woman’s decision to have an abortion? 
What are the rights and responsibilities of parents in regard 
to an adolescent’s abortion? The politicization of the abor-
tion controversy often overshadows the personal dilemmas 
that face women and men as they confront this difficult 
decision.
Men’s Reactions to Abortion
Although abortion is often construed as a women’s issue, 
women and their unborn babies are not the only people 
affected by the abortion decision. In 1976, the Supreme 
Court ruled that a woman did not need the consent of her 
husband or the child’s father to have an abortion, overruling 
a previous requirement of the father’s consent that had been 
legislated in 12 states (Etzioni, 1976). Since that decision, the 
Supreme Court has supported a woman’s independence from 
her husband or a child’s father with regard to reproductive 
decision making. However, questions about the legal rights 
of fathers to determine the fate of their unborn children are 
still being raised, and the laws will probably continue to be 
challenged as fathers become increasingly committed to par-
ticipation in parenting.
Not much is known about men’s reactions to their part-
ners’ abortions. Shostak and McLouth (1985) interviewed 
1,000 men who had accompanied women to abortion clin-
ics across the United States. Of these men, 93% said they 
would alter their birth-control methods as a result of the 
experience, and 83% believed that abortion was a desirable 
way of resolving the pregnancy problem. Many of these men 
expressed anxiety, frustration, and guilt in relation to the 
unwanted pregnancy and the abortion.
In a qualitative study of men’s experiences with unin-
tended pregnancy and abortion, a range of reactions were 
identified. Men differ in the degree to which they take 
responsibility for the pregnancy. In some cases, they view the 
unintended pregnancy as entirely the responsibility of their 
female partner. In other cases, they accept shared responsi-
bility. Similarly, men differ in the perception of the role they 
played regarding the pregnancy outcome. Some believe that 
their female partner made the decision and excluded them 
entirely, others feel that the decision was reached together, 
and still others claim that they convinced their partner to end 
the pregnancy through abortion (Reich & Brindis, 2006).
Some research has focused especially on adolescent 
fathers who may experience feelings of anxiety, anger, and 
moral conflicts about abortion. Young men feel that they 
need to be strong for their girlfriends, even if they are feeling 
their own sense of confusion or loss. Just as for women, the 
response of men is embedded in their value system and in 
Objective 1. To describe the biochemical basis of 
genetic information and the process through which it is 
transmitted from one generation to the next.
Genetic inheritance links each new infant to a specific 
ancestry and to the evolutionary history of the species. 
The important work of the genes is to produce proteins, 
which then guide cellular formation and functioning. The 
laws of heredity explain how genetic information is passed 
from parents to their offspring. The genotype is the bio-
chemical information encoded in the DNA; the phenotype 
is the expression of that information which can be infl u-
enced by patterns of interacting genes, or the interaction 
of genes and the surrounding cellular, social, or physical 
environment.

CHAPTER 4 The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development
weight often coupled with preterm births. The United States 
ranks behind many industrialized countries in the number of 
infants who die before the age of 1.
Objective 5. To analyze the reciprocity between the 
pregnant woman and the developing fetus, focusing on 
ways in which pregnancy affects a childbearing woman 
and expectant father and on basic infl uences on fetal 
growth, such as maternal age, drug use, nutrition, and 
environmental toxins.
During pregnancy, the mother and the fetus are interde-
pendent. The fetus alters the mother’s physical state, fetal 
movements provide an ongoing source of stimulation, and 
pregnancy can introduce new risks to maternal health. Preg-
nancy affects a woman’s social roles and social status. Preg-
nancy infl uences how people treat a woman, including the 
baby’s father, and what resources become available to her. 
A woman’s physical well-being and emotional state along 
with her attitude toward her pregnancy and her developing 
attachment to her unborn child set the stage for the quality 
of her parenting after the child is born.
Characteristics of the mother, her lifestyle, and her physical 
and cultural environment all infl uence fetal development. Of 
special concern are the mother’s age, any drugs she takes dur-
ing her pregnancy, her exposure to certain diseases and envi-
ronmental toxins, the use of anesthetic drugs during delivery, 
and the adequacy of the mother’s diet. Infants conceived by 
women living in poverty are exposed to the cumulative effects 
of many of the environmental hazards that are known to result 
in low birth weight and congenital abnormalities.
Objective 6. To examine the impact of culture on 
pregnancy and childbirth.
The experiences of pregnancy and childbirth are embed-
ded in a cultural context. The birth culture provides a set of 
guidelines for behavior, attitudes toward and beliefs about 
restrictions on the woman’s activities, the availability of 
resources, and the treatment of a pregnant woman by others. 
A matrix of orientations toward pregnancy refl ects solicitude 
versus shame and adequacy versus vulnerability. Most birth 
cultures can be located within this matrix.
Objective 7. To analyze abortion from a psychosocial 
perspective, including the legal context, its social and 
emotional impact on women, and men’s views.
Several factors involved in the prenatal period converge 
in the issue of abortion. The decision to abort reflects 
Objective 2. To identify the contributions of genetic 
factors to individuality through their role in controlling 
the rate of development, their contributions to individual 
traits, and the genetic sources of abnormalities.
Individual differences are due to a combination of the many 
variations in environment and experience that confront a 
growing person and the variability built into the biological 
mechanisms of heredity. Genetic factors contribute to dif-
ferences in the rate and timing of development, to patterns 
of individual characteristics such as temperament or intel-
ligence, and to mutations that result in abnormal develop-
ment. The norm of reaction is a way of conceptualizing the 
probabilistic outcome of various phenotypes given a particu-
lar genotype. The more we study human genetics, the more 
we learn about the dynamic and ongoing interplay of genetic 
information with environmental factors.
Objective 3. To trace fetal development through three 
trimesters of pregnancy, including an understanding of 
critical periods when normal fetal development can be 
disrupted.
The 38 weeks of prenatal development, including the germi-
nal period, the embryonic period, and the fetal period, involve 
a rapid differentiation of body organs and a gradual integra-
tion of survival functions, especially the ability to suck and 
swallow, the regulation of breathing and body temperature, 
and the maturation of the digestive system. Sense receptors 
are prepared to respond to stimulation long before they are 
put to use. The CNS, which begins to take shape in the third 
and fourth weeks after conception, continues to develop and 
change throughout the prenatal period and into childhood 
and adolescence. The newborn’s neurobehavioral capacities 
are influenced by the quality of the prenatal environment, 
including potential disruptions to the CNS. During weeks 3 
through 9 of the prenatal period, fetal development is espe-
cially vulnerable to the disruptive impact of teratogens, a wide 
range of viruses, medications, and environmental toxins that 
can harm organ differentiation and the maturation of the CNS.
Objective 4. To describe the birth process and factors 
that contribute to infant mortality.
Childbirth is described in fi ve stages: early signs that labor 
is approaching, the onset of labor, transition from labor to 
delivery, birthing, and the postpartum period. The length 
of labor is quite variable with fi rst births taking longer than 
subsequent births. Infant mortality rates are infl uenced by 
the quality of prenatal care, the availability of quality medical 
facilities for newborns, and risks associated with low birth

The stage is now set to consider the remaining life stages 
in a psychosocial context. In this chapter, we have discussed 
the emergence of a child into an existing family, commu-
nity, and cultural network. Although much attention has 
been given recently to the early period of childhood (birth 
through age 3) for subsequent cognitive, social, and emo-
tional development, the analysis of the prenatal period sug-
gests that the dynamic epigenetic process is already under 
way before birth. The care provided for expectant parents is 
intimately connected to the potential for optimal develop-
ment in their offspring.
the mother’s attitude toward childbirth; her criteria for a 
healthy, normal child; her age and economic resources; and 
her access to a safe means of ending the pregnancy. Deci-
sions about abortion are often tied to a woman’s percep-
tions about her partner and his attitudes toward the unborn 
child. Decisions about abortion also reflect the culture’s 
attitudes about the moral implications of ending a life after 
conception and the legal principles about when the fetus 
itself has a right to society’s protection. Finally, the decision 
to abort is related to the safety, accessibility, and expense of 
the procedure.

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
INFANCY IS A period of strikingly rapid development. Dur-
ing the fi rst year of life, the infant’s birth weight almost 
triples. (Imagine if your weight tripled within 1 year at any 
other time in your life!) The baby seems to grow before 
your very eyes. Parents will remark that they go to work 
in the morning, and their baby seems to have changed 
by the time they return in the evening. Along with this 
extraordinary rate of physical growth comes a remarkable 
process of increased control and purposefulness, leading 
to the integration of simple responses into coordinated, 
patterned behavior. By the age of 2, the fundamentals 
of movement, language, and concept formation can be 
observed. Most infants are marvelously fl exible, capable 
of adapting to any of the varied social environments into 
which they may be born.
At the turn of the 20th century, since many infants died 
before their fi rst birthday many parents did not invest 
themselves emotionally in their infants. For example, they 
often did not name an infant right away until they were 
fairly sure that the infant would live. Today, with vast im-
provements in infant survival and smaller family size, we 
have seen a change in the emphasis that society places 
on infancy. Each child is taken much more seriously. 
Safety concerns have prompted laws about car seats for 
infants, guidelines for putting babies to sleep on their 
back or side, and the widespread use of monitors in the 
baby’s room to catch signs of infant distress. The medical 
community is devising complex technologies for saving 
the lives of babies who are born weighing 1,000 grams 
(32 oz.) or less. The psychological community is giving 
attention to infant temperament and to the early origins 
of personality, focusing on individual differences among 
infants from the very fi rst weeks of life. Some parents 
take classes, read books and magazines, and join sup-
port groups so that they can “get it right the fi rst time.” 
The Internet is replete with websites and blogs targeted 
to expectant and new parents. A growing baby industry 
offers special equipment, foods, toys, books, and other 
paraphernalia. Sometimes in their exuberance to make 
a profi t from a receptive target market, companies pro-
duce infant equipment, toys, and medications that are 
fl awed and dangerous and have to be recalled.
The story of development during infancy requires 
that one keep in mind a genetically guided pattern of 
growth and development in continuous interaction with 
a complex and changing social and physical environment 
(Plomin, DeFries, Craig, & McGuffi n, 2003). The mother’s 
personality, the father’s involvement in child care, the 
quality of the parents’ relationship with each other and 
their access to social support, cultural beliefs surrounding 
childrearing practices, and poverty or economic strain 
that affect the parents’ psychological well-being are all 
factors that infl uence a child’s vulnerability or resilience. 
As the infant’s capacities change, they bring the baby 
into interaction with new facets of the environment. As 
daily experiences take place, they shape the infant’s neu-
ral pathways into patterns of thought and behavior (Coll, 
2004).

1996). The Apgar score does not explain the source of the 
diffi culty, but it provides an indication about whether some 
level of intervention is needed.
Babies differ in their physical maturity and appearance at 
birth. Differences in physical maturity have distinct conse-
quences for the capacity to regulate survival functions such 
as breathing, digesting, waking, and sleeping. Infants who 
weigh less than 2,500 grams (about 5 pounds, 8 ounces) are 
called low-birth-weight babies. Low birth weight may result 
from prematurity (i.e., being born before the full period of 
gestation). It may also result from the mother’s inadequate 
diet, smoking, or use of drugs, as discussed in Chapter 4. 
These factors tend to lower the fetus’s weight for a given ges-
tational age. Babies who are small for their gestational age 
(SGA) are at greater risk for health problems than those who 
are born prematurely but are of average weight for their ges-
tational age.
Preterm births, that is, births before 38 weeks of gesta-
tional age, have been increasing in the United States since 
1981, and now comprise 12.5% of all live births. Although 
many interventions have been devised to increase the sur-
vival of preterm infants, those born before 32 weeks have 
a high rate of infant mortality and increased risk for seri-
ous medical complications including cerebral palsy, vision 
and hearing impairments, and serious cognitive impair-
ments (Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 
2006).
Newborns 
Objective 1. To describe characteristics of newborns 
and the challenges facing low-birth-weight babies.
In the United States, the average full-term baby weighs 3300 
grams (7 to 7.5 pounds) and is 51 centimeters (20 inches) 
long. Boys are slightly heavier and longer than girls. At birth, 
girls’ nervous systems and bones are about 2 weeks more 
mature than boys’.
In the fi rst minute after birth, and then again at 5 min-
utes, the newborn’s life signs are evaluated using the Apgar 
scoring method, named for its originator, Virginia Apgar 
(see Table 5.1). Five life signs are scored on a scale from 0 
to 2: heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, refl ex irrita-
bility, and body color. A score of 7 to 10 means the infant 
is in good condition. Scores of 4 to 6 mean the infant is in 
fair condition and may require the administration of sup-
plemental oxygen. Scores of 0 to 3 suggest an extremely 
poor condition and the need for resuscitation. Even among 
the infants who score 7 to 10, those with scores of 7 or 8 
show less effi cient attention and poorer cognitive process-
ing than the higher scoring infants. The most important use 
of the Apgar scoring method is for evaluating the need for 
immediate intervention rather than as a means of assessing 
subsequent development (American Academy of Pediatrics, 
From the perspective of psychosocial development, 
fi ve major developmental tasks are especially critical dur-
ing infancy:
•  Establishment and coordination of the sensory, per-
ceptual, and motor systems
•  Elaboration of information-processing capacities and 
sensorimotor intelligence
• Early communication skills
• Formation of attachments
• Differentiation of the emotional system
This chapter begins with a description of the physi-
cal status of the newborn and then discusses each of 
the fi ve developmental tasks. The psychosocial crisis 
of infancy—trust versus mistrust—is explored as a way 
of thinking about the foundational orientation toward 
self and society. The chapter closes with an examination 
of the key roles that parents and caregivers can play in 
providing the environmental supports that promote opti-
mal development in the infant and lay the foundation for 
future growth. ■

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
A growing body of evidence suggests that certain self-
regulatory functions related to self-calming in the face of 
unpleasant stimuli and organization of wake-sleep cycles 
become integrated and synchronized during the third tri-
mester, especially between 30 and 34 weeks of gestation. 
Babies born before 30 weeks do not have the benefi t of posi-
tive features of the uterine environment that support these 
aspects of self-regulation. The box about very small babies 
in this chapter discusses some of the risks for develop-
mental disabilities among babies weighing less than 1,500 
grams. Very-low-birth-weight infants are highly vulnerable 
to medical complications. In 2000, these infants comprised 
1.4% of U.S. births but 51% of infant deaths (NIH, 2007). 
Renewed efforts are needed to determine the causes of low 
birth weight and to prevent as many preterm births as 
possible (Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 
2006).
The care for preterm infants typically takes place in a neona-
tal intensive care unit (NICU) of a hospital. Many interventions 
have been devised to improve the life chances and medical care 
of very small babies. Management of their breathing, tempera-
ture regulation, monitoring of heart rate, creation of appropri-
ate stimulation, and nurturant care in the hospital all contribute 
to improving the chances for survival. Skin-to-skin contact 
between mothers or fathers and their infants, sometimes 
referred to as Kangaroo Care, has been shown to have benefi ts 
for the newborn as well as for parents. It provides a variety of 
sensory stimulation to the infant and increases the caregiv-
ers’ confi dence and comfort in caring for their baby. Preterm 
babies who receive Kangaroo Care as well as other forms of 
gentle touching and massage gain weight faster, have improved 
temperature regulation, and improved alertness as compared 
to babies who do not receive the systematic comfort of human 
touch (Feldman & Eidelman, 2003; Feldman, 2004).
Very Small Babies
MANY BABIES ARE born before they 
reach full gestational maturity. Modern 
technology has pushed back the 
boundary of fetal viability to about 24 
weeks of gestational age, or a weight 
of about 500 grams (slightly more than 
1 pound). These tiny babies, not much 
bigger than the palm of your hand, 
receive weeks of round-the-clock care in 
their struggle to survive. In the United 
States, 49% of babies with birth weights 
between 500 and 750 grams survive 
(NICHD, 2004). Very-low-birth-weight 
infants who survive are at a signifi cantly 
increased risk of severe problems, 
including physical and visual diffi culties, 
developmental delays, and cognitive 
impairment requiring increased levels 
of medical, educational, and parental 
care (Child Health USA, 2005). Hours 
of intensive care combined with new 
medical technologies increase the life 
chances for very tiny babies. Yet many of 
them are at high risk for developmental 
disabilities associated with their extremely 
low birth weight and related physical 
immaturity.
What do we know about the 
developmental progress of these very 
small babies? Very-low-birth-weight 
babies are clearly different from full-
term babies. They are less physically 
attractive; have higher pitched, 
unpleasant cries; are more easily 
overstimulated and more diffi cult to 
soothe; and are less able to establish 
rhythmic patterns of social interaction. 
In a longitudinal study, Ruth Feldman 
(2006) compared high-risk, very small 
babies born at less than 1,000 grams to 
low-risk preterm infants (1,700–1,850 
grams) and full-term infants. She was 
interested in how the coordination 
of two important biological rhythms, 
the sleep-wake cycle and vagal tone, 
differed for the very small babies, and 
how these biological rhythms might 
relate to the infant’s ability to orient to 
and react to stimuli.
Vagal tone is a process through 
which changes in heart rate vary during 
changes in environmental conditions. 
Typically, when you breathe in, heart 
rate increases, and when you breathe 
out, heart rate decreases. Under 
conditions when a task requires attention 
and concentration, heart rate 
increases, which allows for the adaptive 
mobilization of resources. When the 
situation becomes more intense or 
threatening, heart rate slows, leading 
to conservation of resources and the 
ability to achieve a more calm state. The 
vagal system contributes to regulation 
of arousal, reactivity, and is considered 
to be a basic neural component of 
self-regulation, information processing, 
and emotion (Bornstein & Suess, 2000). 
Feldman was also interested in whether 
these biological rhythms would predict 
the infants’ ability to modify their 
reactions to stimuli and to engage in 
synchronous interactions with their 
mothers at 3 months.
The fi rst comparison of the three 
groups was based on data collected 
at 37 weeks gestational age for the 
preterm babies and at the second day 
after birth for the full-term babies. The 
full-term babies had the most mature 
sleep-wake cycle and the most mature 
vagal tone. The low-risk preterm babies 
scored next, and the high-risk preterm 
babies had the poorest scores. Both the 
sleep-wake cycle and vagal tone were

researchers have had to apply considerable ingenuity to study 
infants’ sensory/perceptual competencies. How can you know 
if an infant detects the difference between the color red and the 
color orange, or between the mother’s voice and the voice of a 
stranger? We cannot simply ask an infant to point to a circle or 
press a button to respond to a certain change in color or image. 
Behaviors such as gazing time, changes in heart rate, strength 
or frequency of sucking, facial action, head turning, and habit-
uation are used as indicators of infants’ interest or change in 
response to stimuli.
Habituation means that the infant’s response decreases 
after each presentation of an identical stimulus (Schöner & 
Thelen, 2006). Habituation allows the infant to shift atten-
tion to new aspects of the environment as certain elements 
become familiar. When a new stimulus is presented, such 
as a new level of loudness, or the same tone presented 
to a different ear, the infant shows an increase in alert 
Developmental Tasks
The Development of Sensory/
Perceptual and Motor Functions
Objective 2. To identify important milestones in the 
maturation of the sensory and motor systems, and to 
describe the interactions among these systems during 
the fi rst 2 years of life.
During the fi rst months of life, the sensory/perceptual system—
vision, hearing, taste, smell, touch, motion sensitivity, and 
responsiveness to internal cues (proprioception)—is developing 
rapidly and functions at a more advanced level than the motor 
system. Because most muscle movements are not under the 
infant’s voluntary control in the early days and months of life, 
related to neurobehavioral orientation. 
At 3 months, the infants who showed 
the poorest vagal tone were more likely 
to show distress and crying in response 
to a sequence of stimuli, and less likely 
to engage in synchronous interactions 
with their mothers. The study supports 
the important role of full gestation in 
allowing for the organization of critical 
neurobiological rhythms and their 
subsequent role in fostering emotional 
regulation, attention, and social 
interactions. It also helps to account 
for some of the diffi culties parents 
experience in social interactions with 
their very small babies.
In a study of very high-risk low-birth-
weight babies (average weight 1,000 
grams), signifi cantly fewer preterm 
babies had secure attachments at 19 
months than the comparison group of 
full-term babies. In fact, the percentage 
of very small babies who showed a 
secure attachment declined from 14 
to 19 months. One explanation for this 
decline is that the disruptive effects 
of neurological damage resulting 
from prematurity accumulate during 
the second year of life, introducing 
more anxiety among caregivers and 
greater diffi culty in achieving mutuality 
in the infant-caregiver relationship 
(Mangelsdorf et al., 1996). Other studies 
fi nd that for lower-risk preterm babies, 
about 60% establish secure attachments 
with their caregivers and 40% have 
insecure or disorganized attachments, 
a distribution that is very similar to that 
for full-term infants (Goldberg & DiVitto, 
1995; Brisch et al., 2005).
Extremely low-birth-weight infants 
are at risk for problems in subsequent 
cognitive development. Infants who are 
born weighing less than 1,500 grams are 
likely to suffer serious brain hemorrhages. 
Moreover, their undeveloped lungs 
cannot deliver an adequate supply 
of oxygen to the brain. Chronic lung 
disease, frequently associated with 
prematurity, results in breathing 
problems, feeding diffi culties, lung 
infections, and disrupted fl ow of oxygen 
(Singer, Davillier, Bruening, Hawkins, & 
Yamashita, 1996). These insults to the 
nervous system have an impact on a 
variety of information-processing skills 
that can be measured in newborns, 
including regulation of arousal and 
attention, visual recognition of familiar 
stimuli, and reactivity to novel stimuli 
(DiPietro, Porges, & Uhly, 1992; Rose, 
Feldman, & Wallace, 1992). In a Dutch 
study, more than 1300 very-low-birth-
weight babies born in 1983 were studied 
into adolescence. About 10% had very 
serious abnormalities. However, another 
40% had disabilities and behavioral and 
learning diffi culties that accumulated over 
time to impede their ability to function 
independently (Walther, den Ouden, & 
Verloove-Vanhorick, 2000). As pointed 
out in the research on attachment, the 
consequences of neurological damage 
associated with prematurity are likely to 
have an impact on social and emotional 
development as well as on cognitive 
functioning.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Why are very small babies at risk for 
impairments of cognitive and senso-
rimotor functioning? What might be 
happening with respect to neurologi-
cal development in the last trimester 
that is disrupted by preterm birth?
 2. What are some features of very-
low-birth-weight infants that might 
disrupt the establishment of synchro-
nous interactions with their caregiv-
ers? What kinds of interventions can 
you think of that could help over-
come some of these diffi culties?
 3. Can you think of reasons that could 
account for a decline in the propor-
tion of preterm babies found to have 
secure attachments between 14 and 
19 months of age other than the one 
suggested in the text?
 4. Why might the consequences of neu-
rological damage due to prematurity 
become more evident as children get 
older?
 5. What advice would you give to 
parents of premature infants about 
how to evaluate their child’s devel-
opmental level and how to foster a 
developmentally appropriate set of 
childrearing expectations?

been located, does not result in lasting language defi cits if 
it occurs prenatally or in the very early postnatal period. 
As long as the damage does not impact both hemispheres, 
the infant’s language capacities can mature without signifi -
cant or noticeable disruption or delay (Bates & Roe, 2001). 
Although we have a growing body of research that addresses 
factors that can injure or disrupt brain development, some of 
which is discussed in Chapter 4, we do not know as much 
about the conditions that optimize or foster neural develop-
ment. Much of the research on this topic comes from ani-
mal models where conditions can be controlled to increase 
or eliminate certain forms of stimulation and then examine 
the impact of these conditions on the number of connections 
among neurons, the mylenation of the neurons, and changes 
in the biochemistry of the brain that facilitate or inhibit 
nerve cells from fi ring.
In the prenatal period, brain cells are formed and the ini-
tial organization of the brain structures takes place. Neurons 
are produced at an astounding rate, and axons and dendrites 
are formed as the nerve cells begin to link up with each other 
(see Figure 5.1). Transient exuberance is the term given 
to this rapid increase in the number of neurons, dendrites, 
and synapses that form during the fi rst 2 years of life. As the 
term suggests, the growth is exceptional, producing far more 
neurons than will actually be used; and the rate of growth 
is temporary, preparing the brain to be shaped and orga-
nized through experience. Maturational processes continue 
throughout infancy that alter the interconnections among 
neurons and the speed of firing. Maturational changes in 
the central nervous system that advance the infant’s ability 
to organize and use information, and to regulate behavior 
include:
• The formation of neurons
• The continuing growth of axons and dendrites
• The formation of synapses, the connections between the 
axons of one cell and the dendrites of another
• The sculpting or pruning of synapses
• The production of neurotransmitters, the chemicals that 
stimulate or inhibit the fi ring of specifi c neurons
• Myelination, which insulates the neurons and increases 
the speed of fi ring from one neuron to the next
• The production of glial cells that provide stability for the 
neural network
During the fi rst 3 years, the brain triples in weight and 
creates about 1,000 trillion connections among the neurons. 
Different areas of the brain experience an overproduction of 
synapses at different times, with the visual cortex taking the 
lead, followed by areas related to hearing and language, and 
the prefrontal cortex where higher level thought and prob-
lem solving take place. Then, the pathways are gradually 
pruned or sculpted. As a result of early experiences, sights, 
smells, sounds, tastes, touches, and postures activate and 
strengthen specific neural pathways, whereas other path-
ways are not used and decay. The frequency and speed with 
which nerves fi re across a synapse strengthen the stability of 
responsiveness. Habituation is one of the most primitive 
forms of learning and is observed in many other mammalian 
species.
Habituation is one way to determine whether an infant can 
discriminate between two different stimuli. The researcher 
first habituates the infant to one stimulus; then a second 
stimulus is presented. Signs of renewed interest or alertness, 
measured by changes in heart rate, gazing time, or eye move-
ments, are taken as evidence that the infant has detected a 
difference between the two stimuli. If the infant shows no 
new signs of interest or responsiveness, this is taken as evi-
dence that the differences between the two stimuli were too 
slight to be perceived.
For example, 16 newborns who were 48 hours old 
were habituated to a two-dimensional image of a normal 
face or a scrambled face (eyes on the bottom of the oval, 
nose at the top with the eyebrows). The face was moved 
slowly along a bar from the midline to the right and then to 
the left. Fixation time was measured until the baby’s look-
ing time decreased by 60% from the level of the fi rst three 
trials. Then the new stimulus was introduced. No matter 
whether the babies were initially habituated to the normal 
or to the scrambled face, they all showed an increase in 
fi xation or looking time when the novel face was presented. 
Habituation was a sensitive technique for demonstrat-
ing newborns’ ability to tell the difference between a nor-
mal and a scrambled face (Easterbrook, Kisilevsky, Muir, 
& Laplante, 1999). Similar fi ndings have been observed 
in infants’ responses to patterns of musical notes, pho-
netic sounds, and complex shapes. These studies support 
the notion that young infants are capable of forming and 
retaining a scheme for sensory experiences against which 
they can compare new events.
Brain Development in Infancy
Most infants are born with intact sensory organs and a well-
formed brain. The infant’s brain contains about 100 billion 
neurons, or nerve cells, which are already connected in 
pathways that are designed to execute functions related to 
sensation, perception, and motor behavior as well as to regu-
late internal systems such as respiration, circulation, diges-
tion, and temperature control. The fundamental organization 
of the brain does not change after birth, but details of its 
structure demonstrate plasticity (Singer, 1995; Nash, 1997; 
Johnson, 1999).
What is neural plasticity? It can be thought of in two 
different but related ways. First, there are all the changes in 
the interconnections among neurons that occur as a result 
of learning and experience. Because the wide range of 
human experiences cannot be anticipated, the human brain 
is genetically designed to take in information and use it to 
guide further thought and action through the establishment 
of neural pathways. Second, there are a variety of ways that 
the brain compensates for injury by making use of alterna-
tive resources. For example, severe damage to the left cere-
bral cortex, where many language-related functions have

disuse (Hoff, 2004). Significant injuries or deficiencies 
in experiences required for optimal functioning become 
harder to correct as the system becomes more finely 
organized. We understand this process most fully in the 
visual system, which has been a focus of research in ani-
mals as well as in human infants born with specifi c visual 
anomalies.
In addition to the production and loss of synaptic con-
nections among neurons, brain development advances 
through the production of neurotransmitters, the chemi-
cals that infl uence how the nerves grow, how they respond 
to stimulation, and whether they result in the fi ring or the 
inhibition of fi ring of the neurons. These chemicals infl u-
ence the growth in dendrites and synapses in various parts 
of the brain, they alter synaptic strength, and they change in 
strength following trauma to aid in repair. Experiences such 
as skin-to-skin contact, which was described as an interven-
tion for preterm infants, contributes to the release of certain 
chemicals, helping to relieve pain and reduce stress (Carter, 
2003). Although it is not fully understood, there is a grow-
ing interest in how specifi c aspects of early nurturing might 
infl uence the neurochemical environment and thereby alter 
brain development.
the synapse. In the visual and auditory regions, this prun-
ing seems to be completed during the preschool and early 
childhood periods. In the prefrontal cortex, however, sculpt-
ing continues throughout middle to later adolescence, sug-
gesting a much wider window for the organization of higher 
order reasoning capacities (Huttenlocher & Dabholkar, 
1997). Thus, experiences and the infant’s response to expe-
rience play a role in shaping the unique patterns of inter-
connections that are preserved in each individual (Johnson, 
2000).
The process of pruning or sculpting leads to a reduction 
in plasticity. Although we do not know the exact timing for 
each area of sensory or motor competence, it is believed 
that there is much greater plasticity during the period of 
overproduction of synapses and reduced plasticity once 
the number of synapses reaches its adult level. For exam-
ple, in the development of language, all infants are capable 
of recognizing and uttering sounds from a wide universe 
of languages. However, after repeated interactions with 
family members and caregivers, the infant develops strong 
neural connections for the sounds of the language(s) spo-
ken in the home environment, and the neural connections 
associated with sounds from other languages decay with

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
Maturation in these domains is breathtaking. Our discussion 
focuses on those abilities that permit infants to participate in 
and adapt to their social environment. From birth, sensory/
perceptual capacities are vital resources that help infants 
establish emotional links with their caregivers, gather infor-
mation about their environment, and cope with sources of 
stress. Although we provide information on each of the sen-
sory modalities, it is important to realize that they typically 
function together in a multimodal system. Infants not only 
hear their caregivers, but they see, smell, and touch them. 
Voices are normally associated with faces; tastes are linked 
to smells and textures. Sensory meaning-making takes place 
with the benefi t of information from multiple sources.
Hearing. You may be surprised to learn that hearing 
rather than vision is the sense that provides the very earli-
est link between newborns and their mothers. Research has 
confi rmed that the fetus is sensitive to auditory stimulation 
in utero (Porcaro, 2006). Before birth, the fetus hears the 
mother’s heartbeat. This sound continues to be soothing to 
the infant in the days and weeks after birth. Newborns show 
a preference for the sound of their mother’s voice over an 
unfamiliar voice. The speed with which they recognize their 
mother’s voice suggests both increased attention and clear 
memory for this type of auditory stimulus (Purhonen et al., 
2005). Infants show a preference for the sound of melodies 
that their mother sang during the pregnancy and even for the 
sound of prose passages she read during the prenatal period 
(De Casper & Fifer, 1980; De Casper & Spence, 1986). One 
must assume that an infant’s indication of preference for 
these auditory stimuli is based on familiarity with the sounds 
from exposure in utero.
Young infants can distinguish changes in the loudness, 
pitch, duration, and location of sounds. They can use audi-
tory information to differentiate objects from one another 
and to track the location of objects (Bahrick, Lickliter, 
As we continue to understand the relationship of brain 
development to changes in motor behavior, cognition, emo-
tional expression and inhibition, language and communica-
tion, interpersonal or social behavior, and self-awareness, 
keep these two important principles in mind: First, through 
interactions with the immediate stimulus environment each 
infant shapes the organization of neural connections, creat-
ing very early patterns of familiarity and meaning (National 
Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2000). Thus, 
infants contribute to their own brain development by 
repeating certain actions, attending to certain stimuli more 
than others, and producing responses in caregivers. Sec-
ond, throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, 
more complex cognitive functions, including organized and 
abstract thought; self-control; appreciation for subtle forms 
of communication such as sarcasm; capacities for poetry, 
music, and symbolic art; spatial reasoning; and cognitive 
fl exibility will emerge (Rubia et al., 2006). Even though a lot 
of attention has been given to the importance of brain devel-
opment in the fi rst 3 years of life, advanced reasoning and 
expert knowledge require continued maturation of specifi c 
areas of the cortex as well as the synchronization of systems.
Sensory/Motor Development
Figure 5.2 provides a map of the sensory and motor areas of 
the brain that are related to the infant’s emerging capacities. 
The map suggests that specifi c functions are guided by activ-
ity in certain areas of the brain. However, that is an over-
simplifi cation. The more complex processes such as decision 
making, learning and memory, emotional expression and 
recognition, planning, and participation in meaningful social 
interactions require the interaction and feedback loops 
among several areas, a process that unfolds over time with 
experience and practice (Buschman & Miller, 2007).
It would be diffi cult to review the full range and detail of 
sensory capacities that emerge and develop during infancy.

foreign language, especially if the two languages differ in 
their overall tone, pauses, and rhythm (Sansavini, Berton-
cini, & Giovanelli, 1997). During the second 6 months of 
life, after exposure to a native language, the infant’s ability to 
make some sound distinctions declines. Speech perception 
becomes more tied to the native language as infants begin to 
attach meaning to certain sound combinations, indicating a 
reorganization of sensory capabilities as the child learns to 
listen to people speaking a particular language (Bornstein, 
1995; Werker & Tees, 1999). This is an example of the plas-
ticity referred to earlier—a fi ne-tuning of the neural network 
as a result of experience.
Vision. Infants respond to a variety of visual dimensions, 
including movement, color, brightness, complexity, light-
dark contrast, contours, depth, and distance (Slater & 
Johnson, 1998). The vast majority of research on sensory 
development in infancy has concentrated on assessing the 
acuity or sensitivity of vision. Visual behaviors also offer a 
way to assess the infant’s cognitive capacities. For instance, 
the time an infant takes to scan an object and the length of 
time spent fi xating on a novel object are indications of infant 
intelligence. Shorter fi xation time indicates greater speed and 
effi ciency in neural processing (Colombo, Mitchell, Coldren, 
& Freeseman, 1991; Jacobson et al., 1992).
For sighted, normally developing infants, gazing provides 
an early and continuing source of information that guides 
social interactions and learning about the physical environ-
ment (Hoehl et al., 2009). Newborns and their caregivers 
gaze into each other’s eyes. Mutual gazing has been shown 
to have a calming effect on distressed babies; and babies 
also actively avert their gaze when they need to reduce or 
withdraw from stimulation. By 4 months of age, babies can 
follow the gaze of another person toward an object and by 
9 months, they use the gaze and head turning cues of others 
& Flom, 2006; Wilcox, Woods, Tuggy, & Napoli, 2006). 
Many of these capacities are present among newborns but 
become increasingly sensitive by 6 months. In one study, 
babies ages 6 to 8 months were placed in a darkened room. 
Objects that made sounds were located within reach and 
out of reach, and off to the right or left of midline. The 
babies made reaching motions in the correct direction of 
the sounds, and they made more efforts to reach objects 
that sounded as if they were within reach than to reach 
objects that sounded out of reach (Clifton, Perris, & Bull-
inger, 1991). In another study, infants ages 4 to 6 months 
were exposed to a looming sound, which appeared to come 
closer or recede from them at a slow or rapid pace. When 
the sound loomed toward them quickly, the babies leaned 
back in a defensive strategy to escape the anticipated threat. 
This suggests that infants have the ability to use auditory 
information to detect relative speed and distance (Freiberg, 
Tually, & Crassini, 2001).
The human voice is one of the earliest stimuli to evoke 
an infant’s smile; infants appear to be particularly sensitive 
to language sounds (Benasich & Leevers, 2003). In a com-
parison of newborns and babies 3 months old, the newborns 
were equally interested in human and monkey vocaliza-
tions, and preferred these sounds to synthetic sounds. By 
3 months, however, babies showed a clear preference for 
human over monkey vocalizations suggesting that human 
auditory preferences take shape rapidly in the fi rst months of 
life (Vouloumanos, Hauser, Werker, & Martin, 2010).
Very young babies are able to differentiate basic sound 
distinctions used in human speech throughout the world. 
Infants from all language environments are able to perceive 
and distinguish among the speech sounds that could be 
used in one or more of the world’s languages. By 6 months 
of age, however, infants prefer to listen to sequences of 
words spoken in the mother’s language rather than in a 
Even in the fi rst days of life, a new-
born is taking in sensory information 
about his mother’s face, the sound of 
her voice, her scent, and the way it 
feels to be cuddled in her arms.

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
features of faces such as the round shape, the arrangement 
and distance between the eyes, or the size of the iris (Tsao, 
2006). It is as if the brain is organized to build an increas-
ingly complex perception of faces by integrating the recogni-
tion of a variety of specifi c features.
Infants show preference for face-like stimuli (Nelson, 
2001). In the early weeks following birth, infants have optimal 
focus on objects that are about 20 cm away—approximately 
the distance between the mother’s face and her baby cradled in 
her arms. Newborns can shift focus to scan and keep track of a 
moving target, but not as easily and smoothly as older babies. 
Young infants focus their attention on the contours or external 
borders of objects rather than on the internal details. Thus, 
if you were holding a young baby, the child might appear to 
be staring at your hairline or your chin rather than at your 
mouth. Faces have many of the properties that infants pre-
fer. The hairline is a type of contour; the eyes provide a light-
dark contrast; and the facial expressions provide a changing, 
moving stimulus.
An experiment with newborns who were 25 to 73 hours 
old demonstrated that one aspect of a face that is important 
to babies is the top-heavy confi guration of the features (Cas-
sia, Turati, & Simion, 2004). Figure 5.3 shows the com-
parisons that support this conclusion. Fixation time to the 
stimulus pairs of faces was used as evidence of preference. 
In Experiment 1, babies preferred the upright to the upside-
down face. In Experiment 2, babies preferred the top-heavy 
scrambled face to the bottom-heavy scrambled face. In 
Experiment 3, there was no difference in preference between 
the normal upright face and the top-heavy scrambled face. 
The results of the three studies together provide evidence 
to direct their attention. By gazing at others and following 
the gaze of others, babies use vision to form social connec-
tions, focus attention, and gain information from others 
about important objects and activities in their environment 
(Moore, 2008; Akhtar & Gernsbacher, 2008).
Visual acuity improves rapidly during the fi rst 4 months. 
Pattern and movement perception mature as well. By 2 
months, infants form an expectation of a visual sequence. As 
they watch a pattern of events, they show evidence of antici-
pating the next event in the sequence (MacMurray & Aslin, 
2004). Three-month-old infants respond to wavelengths 
of light as though they perceive distinct hues of blue, green, 
yellow, and red (Bornstein, Kessen, & Weiskopf, 1976; Aslin, 
1987; Teller & Bornstein, 1987). Four-month-old babies 
perceive objects as adults would, although they do not have 
the same set of cognitive associations with them that imply 
specifi c functions or categories. They recognize shapes and 
detect complex patterns of motion such as human walking. 
Infants are born with a variety of skills for detecting visual 
stimuli, which matures rapidly into the coordination of 
visual perception. However, the process of visual cognition—
that is, understanding the nature of objects and their physical 
properties—requires further experimentation.
Faceness. Faces are a particularly salient kind of visual 
stimulus. Several specifi c areas of the brain respond specifi -
cally to faces as compared to other kinds of complex objects. 
Research with macaques shows that specifi c nerves in the 
region of the brain that is active in processing faces fire 
exclusively to faces and not to other visual stimuli. More-
over, among those neurons, some are triggered by particular

move. By 3 months of age, infants can recognize familiar 
voice-face associations. They show surprise when a familiar 
face is paired with an unfamiliar voice (Brookes et al., 2001). 
By 4.5 months, they can imitate the facial expressions asso-
ciated with specifi c spoken sounds—making different faces 
for the / i / sound and the / a / sound (Patterson & Werker, 
1999). So while babies are making sense of their visual envi-
ronment, they are also using vision as a source of informa-
tion about language and communication.
Taste and Smell. Newborns can differentiate sweet, sour, 
bitter, and salty tastes. Facial responses to salty, sour, and 
bitter solutions share the same negative upper and midface 
response but differ in the accompanying lower face actions: 
The lips purse in response to a sour taste, the mouth gapes in 
response to a bitter taste, and no distinctive lower facial reac-
tion is seen in response to a salty taste. Two hours after birth, 
an infant’s facial responses to a sweet taste (sucrose) are char-
acterized primarily by relaxation and sucking. Sucrose has 
an especially calming effect on newborns and appears to 
reduce pain. In one experiment, newborns 1 to 3 days old 
who were undergoing circumcision or were having their heel 
pricked for a blood test for phenylketonuria cried much less 
when they were given a small sucrose solution to suck (Blass 
& Hoffmeyer, 1991). The calming effect of sweet-tasting 
substances has been observed in both preterm and full-term 
infants (Smith & Blass, 1996). It is likely that the normal 
taste of milk, which includes this sweet fl avor, has the com-
bined effect of releasing natural opioids, thereby raising the 
pain threshold, and reducing heart rate and activity level, 
thereby conserving energy.
Breastfed babies are particularly sensitive to their moth-
ers’ body odors (Cernoch & Porter, 1985). One study found 
that 7-day-old babies could use the sense of smell to distin-
guish their own mothers’ nursing pads from those of other 
mothers (MacFarlane, 1975). The mother’s odor may play 
an important role in stimulating early mother-infant interac-
tions (Porter, Balogh, & Makin, 1988).
Touch. The skin is the largest sensory organ and the earli-
est to develop in utero. A variety of evidence from animal 
and human research suggests that touch plays a central role 
of the importance of this aspect of faceness in capturing a 
newborn’s attention.
Subsequent studies have demonstrated that another fea-
ture of faceness is the congruence of the inner features with 
the outer shape. Human faces have more features, including 
eyes and eyebrows, at the wider part of the head and fewer 
features at the narrow part of the head. When stimuli com-
bine the two features of top-heaviness and congruency, they 
evoke the same level of visual preference among newborns 
as faces (Cassia, Valenza, Simion, & Leo, 2008). By 6 or 7 
months of age, infants treat faceness as a special visual cat-
egory, showing surprise when facial features are disorganized 
or upside down (Catherwood, Freiberg, Green, & Holt, 
2001; Cohen & Cashon, 2001).
In addition to the form, shape, and movement of the 
human face, certain facial expressions appear to have mean-
ing to very young babies. One- and 2-day-old babies are able 
to discriminate and imitate the happy, sad, and surprised 
expressions of a live model (Field, Woodson, Greenberg, & 
Cohen, 1982). This very early capacity for imitation wanes 
and is replaced between the ages of 1 and 2 months with a 
voluntary capacity for imitation of facial expressions when 
the model is not present. Sometime between 4 and 7 months, 
infants are able to recognize and classify some expressions 
such as happiness, fear, and anger (McClure, 2000).
Lack of motion in an adult face has a disturbing effect 
on infants. When adults pose with a still face, babies stop 
looking at the adult and, in some cases, begin grimacing or 
showing other signs of discomfort. This reaction suggests 
that infants anticipate a certain normal sequence of facial 
movements in a human interaction. Thus, the absence of 
facial movements is not simply noted as novel but distressing 
(Muir & Lee, 2003).
Some 2-day-old infants discriminate between their mother’s 
face and the face of a stranger (Field, Cohen, Garcia, & Green-
berg, 1984). By 3 months, almost all infants can distinguish a 
parent’s face from that of a stranger (Zucker, 1985). These visual 
perceptual skills illustrate the highly developed capacities for 
orienting toward social stimuli that permit infants to participate 
readily in the social context on which their survival depends.
Of course, sights and sounds typically go together. When 
people speak, their mouths change shape and their faces

This sequence of facial expressions in a newborn was elicited by a sweet solution. The initial negative grimace is followed by 
relaxation and sucking.

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
baby pauses to take in other aspects of the situation. The 
baby may then gaze at the contours of the mother’s face, 
playfully lick the milk dripping from the mother’s breast, 
smell the milk’s fragrance and taste its special sweet taste, 
and listen to the sound of the mother’s voice offering comfort 
or inviting conversation. The baby may reach up to explore 
the mother’s skin or relax in the comfort of the mother’s gen-
tle embrace. All the sensory information becomes integrated 
to create familiarity with this scheme, including a growing 
recognition of the mother and a rich mixture of sensory 
impressions associated with this special situation in which 
hunger is satisfi ed.
Motor Development
At birth, an infant’s voluntary muscle responses are poorly 
coordinated. Most early motor responses appear to be refl ex-
ive, meaning that a specifi c stimulus will evoke a particular 
motor response without any voluntary control or direction. 
Many of these built-in responses help infants survive and 
lead them to develop more complicated sequences of volun-
tary behavior. The sucking refl ex is a good example. At birth, 
inserting something in an infant’s mouth produces a sucking 
refl ex. This helps infants gain nourishment relatively easily 
before sucking behavior is under their control. Before long, 
infants become skillful at controlling the strength and sen-
sitivity of sucking behavior. They use sucking and mouth-
ing as strategies for tactile exploration. Infants have been 
shown to use their mouths to explore objects that they can 
then identify visually, thus transferring information from the 
tactile sense to the visual sense (Meltzoff & Borton, 1979; 
Gibson & Walker, 1984).
Table 5.2 describes a number of common infant refl exes, 
the evoking stimulus, and the response. Infant reflexes 
include sucking, grasping, rooting (turning the head in the 
direction of the cheek that is stroked), coughing, and step-
ping. With time, many of these behaviors make a transition 
in development. Gentle handling, such as rocking, stroking, 
and cuddling, has soothing effects on a baby. Swaddling—
the practice of wrapping a baby snugly in a soft blanket—is 
a common technique for soothing a newborn in many cul-
tures. One of the effective techniques for caring for low-
birth-weight babies is to introduce regular gentle stroking, 
rocking, and other forms of soothing touch.
Touch is an active as well as a passive sense; babies use it 
to explore objects, people, and their own bodies. Sucking is 
one of the earliest coping strategies infants use to calm them-
selves (Blass & Ciaramitaro, 1994). Sucking and mouthing 
are early forms of exploratory touch. Babies can recognize the 
qualities of objects from the way they feel in their mouths—
nubbly or smooth, chewy and fl exible, or rigid (Rose & Ruff, 
1987). For older infants, most tactile information comes 
through touching with the hands and bringing objects to the 
face in order to take a closer look or to explore them with the 
mouth. By 5 or 6 months of age, infants can use their hands 
for the controlled examination of objects. They fi nger sur-
faces to explore small details and transfer objects from one 
hand to the other to detect corners, shapes, and the fl exibil-
ity of surfaces as well as the object’s size, temperature, and 
weight (Streri, 2005).
The Interconnected Nature of Sensory/Perceptual 
Capacities. The sensory/perceptual capacities function as 
an interconnected system to provide a variety of information 
about the environment at the same time (Calvert, Spence, & 
Stein, 2004). Consider the situation when an infant is being 
nursed. At first, the mother guides the baby toward her 
breast, but the baby makes use of visual, tactile, olfactory, 
and kinesthetic cues to fi nd and grab hold of the nipple. If 
very hungry, the baby may close the eyes in order to concen-
trate exclusively on bursts of sucking behavior, coordinating 
sucking and swallowing as effi ciently as possible. But as the 
initial swallows of milk satisfy the strong hunger pangs, the

Sucking and mouthing are important 
ways of exploring objects. Fists and 
toes are the fi rst easy targets.

She also clasps her hands together and stares at them out 
in front of her at arm’s length. (Church, 1966, p. 7)
Voluntary reaching begins as the child tries to make con-
tact with objects on the same side of the body as the out-
stretched hand. By 4 months, babies will reach for objects 
placed on the same side, the opposite side, or in the middle 
of the body. By this age, babies have also become skilled in 
using both hands to hold an object, so they are more able to 
keep the object close enough to investigate. They may shift 
from exploring with their fi ngers to sucking and biting to 
fi nd out more about the object (Rochat, 1989). Between 5 
and 7 months, babies become increasingly accurate at reach-
ing and grasping a moving object, alternating hands to inter-
cept an object by anticipating the direction of its movement 
(Robin, Berthier, & Clifton, 1996).
By 12 months, babies have mastered the pincer grasp, 
using their index fi nger and thumb to pick up tiny things, 
such as string and thread, pieces of dry cereal, and spaghetti 
noodles. With this advance, they can also manipulate things 
by lifting latches, turning knobs, and placing small things 
inside bigger things and trying to get them out again. These 
motor skills provide new information about how objects 
work and how they relate to one another. The develop-
ment of fi ne motor skills contributes to the infant’s sense of 
from an involuntary to a voluntary behavior. In the pro-
cess, infants may lose a response before they regain control 
over simple movements. Then they blend several of these 
new voluntary movements into increasingly coordinated 
and complex patterns of behavior (Fentress & McLeod, 
1986). For example, very young infants can support their 
full weight through the strength of their grasping reflex. 
When propped in an infant seat, they will reach and grasp 
refl exively at an object, reaching their target about 40% of 
the time. At 4 weeks of age, this refl exive reaching behavior 
seems to disappear, but by 5 months it is replaced by vol-
untary reaching, accurate grasping, clutching, and releasing 
(Bower, 1987).
Reaching and Grasping. The transition from involun-
tary to voluntary reaching and grasping results from geneti-
cally guided maturation coupled with repeated exploration. 
Infants practice controlled, coordinated muscle movements, 
guided by visual and auditory cues—particularly cues about 
size, distance, and direction. In the following example, a 
2-month-old girl gains control of her hands and fi ngers.
She has discovered her hands, stares at them many times 
a day for three or four minutes at a time, watches them as 
she wiggles fi ngers, extends and fl exes them, rotates wrists.

walk. Parental expectations seem to infl uence the timing of 
the onset for some of these milestones (Hopkins & Westra, 
1990). During the second year, walking becomes increas-
ingly steady; crawling may be used for play but is no longer 
the preferred method for locomotion. Babies explore stairs, 
climbing up and down using a variety of strategies. They 
start to slide or jump down from modest heights. Each of 
these accomplishments requires practice, refi nement, strug-
gle, and, fi nally, mastery.
The Contributions of Nature and Nurture in Motor 
Development. Motor development provides an excellent 
illustration of the interaction between the genetically guided 
plan for growth and experience. The unfolding of motor 
capacities is guided by genetics, beginning as it does with 
the presence of a wide range of refl exive responses that are 
hardwired, so to speak, into the infant’s neurological sys-
tem. At the same time, within this plan, one observes both 
mastery and can be a source for positive emotions. At the 
same time, they may cause new confl icts between the baby 
and the caregiver, who knows that tiny things shouldn’t go 
into the mouth, and that certain objects ought not to be 
touched, moved, and manipulated.
Motor Sequence. Motor skills develop as a result of the 
physical growth and maturation of bones, muscles, and 
the nervous system in the context of varied environmen-
tal opportunities. Figure 5.4 shows the normal sequence 
of development of motor and movement skills during the 
fi rst year of life; however, babies vary in the sequence and 
rate at which they acquire these skills. Individual children 
grow in spurts, interspersed with times of slow growth and 
some periods of regression (Fischer & Rose, 1994). Usually, 
however, during the fi rst 12 months, babies begin to hold 
their heads up and roll over by themselves; they learn to 
reach for things and grasp them; they sit, crawl, stand, and

however, he must learn to raise himself on his knees, coor-
dinate his hand and leg movements, and propel himself for-
ward rather than backward. Most babies reach a point when 
they rock in a stationary position on all fours before they can 
crawl. In repeated observations of 15 infants as they made 
the transition to crawling, a key precursor was found to be 
the establishment of a strong hand preference. When infants 
fell from a seated position onto their hands, they tended to 
fall onto their nonpreferred hand, so that the preferred hand 
was available to reach out and begin crawling. Confi dence 
in being able to maintain one’s body weight on one arm 
and two legs while reaching out with the preferred hand is 
part of the motor sequence necessary for forward crawling 
(Goldfi eld, 1989). Crawling, which tends to be regarded as 
natural and easily performed in infancy, is in fact achieved 
by long and patient effort in the coordination of head and 
shoulder movement, reaching, and kicking. As the baby 
changes from crawling to walking, new strategies for navi-
gating the environment have to be invented.
Infant motor behavior requires flexibility because of the 
rapid change in physical size and strength and the variety of 
contexts for movement. Infants gain greater motor control 
with each postural status from sitting and crawling to standing 
and walking. At the same time, each new motor capacity per-
mits the exploration of a more varied environment. As a result, 
infants have to be able to make immediate assessments of the 
relationship between their physical abilities and the environ-
mental conditions in order to decide whether to avoid action, 
take familiar actions, or try to invent some new, adapted 
action. The evidence for this fl exibility can be seen as babies 
experiment with descending slopes and slides. Some try going 
headfi rst and then slide backwards; others try to go down with 
a crablike crawl and then switch over to their bottoms, and 
still others won’t go down at all (Adolph & Eppler, 2002).
Sensorimotor Intelligence: Processing, 
Organizing, and Using Information
Objective 3. To describe the development of 
 sensori motor intelligence, including an analysis of how 
infants process information, organize experiences, 
 conceptualize causality, and understand the properties 
and functions of objects.
What is sensorimotor intelligence? Think for a moment of a 
familiar experience, such as tying your shoelaces. The pat-
tern of tying shoelaces unfolds with little, if any, language 
involved. In fact, the task of explaining to a young child 
how to tie shoelaces is particularly difficult because very 
few words or concepts are part of the process. This kind of 
motor routine is an example of sensorimotor intelligence. 
When infants begin to adapt their sucking reflex to make 
it more effective, or when they use different techniques of 
sucking on the breast and the bottle, they are demonstrating 
individual and group differences. Not only are babies differ-
ent from one another at birth, but they also show different 
rates of motor advancement. For example, one study exam-
ined how babies adapted their locomotor strategy for going 
down a slope. Thirty-one infants, all 14 months old, were 
recruited for the study. Even though they were all the same 
age, their prior experience with walking ranged from 10 days 
to 137 days (Adolph & Eppler, 2002).
In addition to individual differences in the timing and 
tempo of motor development, cultures differ in the opportu-
nities provided for motor exploration. In a longitudinal study 
of almost 16,000 infants living in the United Kingdom 
(England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), cultural 
differences in the attainment of developmental motor mile-
stones were noted. Black Caribbean infants, Black African 
infants, and Indian infants were on average more advanced 
in motor development than White infants. Pakistani and Ban-
gladeshi infants were more likely to show motor delays than 
White infants. Whereas the delays among the Pakistani and 
Bangladeshi infants were explained largely by factors associ-
ated with poverty, the advantages of the babies of Caribbean, 
African, and Indian ethnicity could not be accounted for by 
these factors. The authors suggest that a combination of paren-
tal expectations and parenting practices associated with cul-
tural tradition helped support advanced motor development 
in these groups (Kelly, Sacker, Schoon, & Nazroo, 2006).
Although the normative pattern of motor development 
suggests a preprogrammed sequence of stages that is heav-
ily guided by genetics and neural structures, research on the 
process of motor development has challenged this assump-
tion. Researchers now regard the regularities in motor behav-
ior as the result of a dynamic process of exploration in which 
infants coordinate their physical actions with the demands 
and opportunities of the situation. The combination of a 
maturing central nervous system, growth in strength and 
coordination, opportunities for various types of movements, 
and the emergence of cognitions to understand and antici-
pate actions underlies an ongoing process of self-correcting, 
adaptive movement (Rutkowska, 1994).
Perception and action work hand in hand, giving the 
infant information about the physical properties of the situa-
tion and feedback about the consequences of a specifi c motor 
strategy. Over time and with practice in similar situations, 
the infant discovers the combination of action, intensity, 
direction, and speed that will create the desired outcome. 
With additional practice, this pattern then becomes most 
likely and increasingly effi cient (Thelen, 1995). (See the fea-
tured box on the stepping refl ex.)
Consider Brad’s efforts to crawl. He is placed face down in 
the middle of a brightly colored blanket. His mother kneels 
at the edge of the blanket and dangles a favorite stuffed bear. 
She smiles and says encouragingly, “Come on, Brad. Come 
get Teddy.” Brad looks intently, reaches toward the bear 
and, by kicking and squirming, manages to move forward. 
This snakelike movement is Brad’s fi rst accomplishment en 
route to well-organized crawling. Before he masters crawling,

representational abilities (Rose, Feldman, & Jankowski, 
2009). Attention refers to the infant’s ability to focus on an 
object or task as well as to shift or redirect focus from one task 
to another. Attention is a foundational cognitive ability that 
allows infants to follow the gaze of another person, track the 
path of a moving object, and participate in alternating inter-
actions. Attention is typically measured by noting how long 
an infant looks at an object, and how often the infant shifts 
gaze from one object to another when comparing objects.
Processing speed is the time it takes to identify a stimulus 
and fi gure out its meaning. The faster the processing speed, 
the more quickly one can incorporate a stream of informa-
tion. Processing speed is often assessed with reaction time 
tasks where the time elapsed from presentation of the stimu-
lus to response is taken as evidence of processing speed.
Memory is a complex capacity that includes recognizing 
something as similar to something one has seen or experi-
enced in the past, holding information in mind for a brief 
period before using it, and recalling information as needed 
(Flom & Bahrick, 2010). One way of studying memory in 
infancy is through the use of habituation tasks, which rely on 
the ability to match a stimulus with something that was expe-
rienced in the past, and to evaluate it as similar or different.
sensorimotor intelligence. The familiar scheme for sucking is 
modifi ed so that it takes into account the special properties 
of the breast and the bottle, depending on the situation.
How Infants Process Their Experiences
According to Piaget’s (1970) theory of cognitive develop-
ment, the chief mechanism governing the growth of intelli-
gence during infancy is sensorimotor adaptation. From the 
very earliest days of life, infants use their refl exes to explore 
their world. At the same time, they gradually alter their 
refl exive responses to take into account the unique proper-
ties of objects around them. Infants do not use the conven-
tional symbolic system of language to organize experience. 
Rather, they form concepts through perception and direct 
investigation of the environment. The notion of sensorimotor 
intelligence, then, encompasses the elaboration of patterns of 
movement and sensory experiences that the child comes to 
recognize in association with specifi c environmental events.
Information-Processing Abilities. Four basic infor-
mation-processing abilities provide the cognitive resources 
that support the maturation of sensorimotor intelligence. 
They include: attention, processing speed, memory, and 
The Dynamic 
Development of 
Stepping
AT SOME POINT within the fi rst 2 or 3 
weeks of life, when you hold an infant 
upright under the arms, the infant makes 
stepping motions that look very much 
like walking (Barbu-Roth et al., 2009). This 
stepping response is evoked by a number 
of stimuli, including the posture in which 
the baby is held; tactile stimulation to the 
feet; and visual information about the 
relationship of the body to the surface 
below. By the age of 2 or 3 months, this 
stepping behavior seems to disappear. 
Initial explanations for this loss of the 
stepping response were that the refl ex is 
inhibited by higher level cortical functions. 
The assumption was that the stepping 
refl ex was a vestigial behavior from some 
earlier evolutionary primate period, 
and that true stepping and walking 
was a product of voluntary movement 
genetically programmed to emerge with 
more advanced cortical development.
The idea that a behavior that is 
so closely related to walking would 
disappear and then reappear was 
puzzling. Esther Thelen and Donna 
Fisher (1982) designed research 
to examine the relationship of the 
biomechanics of infant stepping and 
its relation to the infant’s posture and 
physical growth. They were able to take 
advantage of video recordings and 
electromyography (EMG) of four muscle 
groups to capture data on patterns 
of muscle activation associated with 
various movements. Their fi rst goal 
was to explore the similarities between 
infant stepping while held upright and 
infant kicking while the infants were 
lying on their backs. The former seems 
to disappear and the latter becomes 
stronger and more coordinated over 
time. Their second goal was to consider 
the biomechanical conditions that might 
constrain the stepping response and 
increase the kicking response.
The infants who participated in the 
study were all under 2 weeks old. Of 
13 infants, 8 showed both stepping and 
kicking during the recording session. 
Both the stepping and kicking showed 
alternating right and left leg action. 
The EMG data (an electronic technique 
for recording muscles at rest and when 
they are contracting) for the two types 
of movement were quite similar. The 
timing of the fl exion and extension 
phases of the kick and the step were 
also similar. Thelen and Fisher argued 
that neonatal stepping and kicking 
while lying on the back are essentially 
the same movement patterns. The key 
to the disappearance of stepping and 
the increase in kicking is in the role 
of gravity as infants’ legs gain mass. 
As the legs gain in fat, the muscle 
strength needed to lift the legs against 
the force of gravity is not suffi cient to 
permit the stepping action. However, in 
the prone position, the kicking action 
is actually supported by the force of 
gravity. During the fi rst months of life, 
the growth of body fat outpaces the 
growth of muscle mass, so the babies 
cannot lift their legs in the upright 
position. However, the action itself 
is not lost, and in fact is practiced 
actively in the prone position. When

gathered (Schöner & Thelen, 2006). The infant starts out 
with some basic sensory, motor, and cognitive organizational 
structures. With each new challenge, a process of adaptation 
results in the revision of basic schemes to better predict and 
interpret experience (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1997). For exam-
ple, Ruby, who is 12 months old, may be surprised and upset 
when her grandmother scolds her as she reaches for a shiny 
glass bowl on the table. Grandmother knows that the bowl 
will break if Ruby pushes it off the table. By 16 months, Ruby 
warily watches her grandmother’s face as she reaches for the 
bowl and may withdraw her hand if she sees Grandma frown 
or hears the sharp “No!” that has come to be associated with 
“Don’t touch.” Ruby has developed a theory that she should 
not touch the bowl, which she cautiously tests by reaching 
for it and watching for the response.
Causal Schemes
One of the most important components of sensorimotor 
intelligence is the capacity to anticipate that certain actions 
will have specific effects on objects in the environment. 
Infants develop an understanding of causality based largely 
on sensory and motor experience. By 9 months of age, 
infants show evidence that they anticipate the direction of an 
Representational skills refer to the ability to use symbols 
or signs to stand for something, and to keep a principle or 
feature of something in mind and apply it more generally. The 
ability to transfer information across modalities—for exam-
ple, to use visual information to guide tactile exploration—is 
evidence of representational ability. Representational skills are 
involved when a child uses a word or a gesture to indicate 
an object or when a child imitates an action in pretense, like 
using a block to feed a doll or giving it a sip of pretend water 
from a pretend cup.
Taken together, these information-processing skills—
attention, processing speed, memory, and representational 
skills—support an infant’s ability to form increasingly com-
plex schemes about objects, people, actions, and the rela-
tionships among them. Changes in the demand properties 
of one aspect of a task, such as processing speed or memory, 
may infl uence attention or representational competence. For 
example, immature memory capacities may make it diffi cult 
for infants to accurately represent and categorize new objects 
(Oakes, 2009).
According to an emerging view, sometimes referred to 
as the Theory theory, infants form theories about how their 
world operates and modify them as new information is 
slightly older babies were submerged 
waist-high in water, overcoming the 
biomechanical constraints of body 
mass and gravity, the stepping pattern 
was observed (Thelen, Fisher, & Ridley-
Johnson, 1984).
Thus, the shift from stepping to 
no stepping was actually a dynamic 
adaptation to the combination of 
changing physical characteristics in a 
particular physical context (Thelen & 
Smith, 1994). The results of this research 
led to a transformation in the way we 
think about development. The earlier 
view was that the stepping motion was 
a primitive refl ex that falls away and 
is eventually replaced by a genetically 
guided plan for voluntary walking. 
However, this research shows that the 
stepping motion remains intact, but is 
not observed when the infant is in the 
upright position, because of a change 
in the ratio of fat to muscle mass. The 
babies’ legs get too heavy to lift against 
the force of gravity when they are in an 
upright position.
Studies of infant care practices in 
other cultures, especially in Africa and 
Central America, fi nd a more common 
practice of holding infants upright 
rather than lying them down in a cradle 
or crib. Infants in these cultures have 
been observed to walk at an earlier age 
than Western infants. Thelen and Fisher 
suggested that infants who are given 
more experience in an upright position 
have the opportunity to strengthen 
their leg muscles by experiencing the 
resistance against gravity when they fl ex 
their legs, possibly leading to an earlier 
use of legs for support in standing and 
walking.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Why is this research on stepping 
important for our understanding of 
development?
 2. What does this research suggest 
about the interaction of neurological, 
physical, and experiential aspects of 
motor behavior?
 3. What does this research suggest 
about how to think about the co-
ordination of systems in the early 
years of life? Can you think of other 
examples of behaviors that might be 
better understood from this systems 
perspective?
According to research on motor devel-
opment, the stepping refl ex remains 
 intact and plays a role in upright walking 
when babies are strong enough to lift 
their legs against the force of gravity.

of a spoon as a tool for eating (Connolly & Dalgleish, 1989). 
The infants were observed once a month for 6 months in 
their home during a mealtime. At first, actions involving 
the spoon appeared to focus on exploration of the spoon 
itself. The infants banged the spoon, sucked it, or rubbed it 
in their hair. Then the babies showed an understanding of 
the purpose of the spoon as a tool by repeating the action 
sequence of dipping the spoon in the dish and bringing it 
to the mouth. However, no food was on the spoon. In the 
third phase, babies began to integrate the function and 
the action by loading the spoon with food and then bring-
ing it to the mouth. During this phase, they made so many 
errors that very little food actually got to the mouth via the 
spoon. Finally, babies were able to coordinate the action and 
the function by using the other hand to steady the bowl, 
altering the angle of the spoon, picking up food they had 
dropped, and devising other strategies to enhance the func-
tion, depending on the type of food involved. Here we see a 
demonstration of how one complex motor behavior becomes 
part of a problem-solving action sequence during the senso-
rimotor period of development.
Piaget and Inhelder (1966/1969) described six phases 
in the development of causal schemes (see Table 5.3). 
Subsequent research and related theoretical revisions have 
confi rmed these levels of cognitive development (Fischer & 
Silvern, 1985). In Phase 1, refl exes, cause and effect are linked 
through the involuntary reflexive responses. The built-in 
stimulus-response systems of key refl exes are viewed as the 
genetic origin of intelligence. Babies suck, grasp, and root in 
response to specifi c types of stimulation. Piaget viewed these 
refl exes as adaptive learning systems. In detailed observa-
tions of his youngest child, Laurent, he noted daily changes 
in sucking behavior during the fi rst month of life. Laurent 
became increasingly directed in groping for the breast, form-
ing early associations between those situations in which 
he would be fed and those in which he would not (Piaget, 
1936/1952; Gratch & Schatz, 1987).
action, like pouring a liquid into a glass or using a spoon to 
bring soup to the mouth, and are surprised when the action 
is not completed or takes an unexpected twist. This under-
standing of the goal-directed nature of behavior provides a 
framework for interpreting actions as reflecting intention 
or purposefulness (Reid et al., 2009). Babies discover that 
if they cry, Mama will come to them; if they kick a chair, 
it will move; and if they let go of a spoon, it will fall to the 
fl oor. These predictable sequences are learned through rep-
etition and experimentation. The predictability of the events 
depends on the consistency with which objects or people in 
their world respond as well as on the child’s initiation of the 
action. Babies learn to associate specifi c actions with regu-
larly occurring outcomes. They also experiment with their 
own actions to determine the variety of events that a single 
behavior may cause. Eventually, they are able to work back-
ward: They can select a desirable outcome and then perform 
the behavior that will produce it.
The achievement of complex, purposeful, causal behaviors 
develops gradually during the fi rst 2 years of life. This achieve-
ment requires that infants have an understanding of the proper-
ties of objects in their environment and a variety of strategies 
for manipulating those objects. Research has shown that infants 
form expectations about how objects function in specifi c condi-
tions (Baillargeon, 2004). For example, one object can fi t inside 
another, but not if the second object has no opening. Another 
expectation is that an object can be hidden behind another 
larger object. Over time, infants become aware of the relevant 
variables that operate in a specifi c physical context. For exam-
ple, a tall object cannot completely fi t inside a shorter container. 
Infants appear to learn about the relationship of objects under 
specifi c conditions, but they do not generalize from one type of 
event to another. Therefore, they must be able to explore and 
experiment with objects in order to select the most effective 
strategies for coordinating actions to achieve specifi c goals.
The dynamic process of establishing a complex causal 
scheme is illustrated in a study of the emergence of the use

to formulate a plan, execute it, and evaluate its outcome 
depend on these skills.
Understanding the Nature of Objects and 
Creating Categories
Babies are active explorers of their environment (Bruner, 
2001). From birth, they try to make direct sensory contact 
with objects. They reach for, grasp, and mouth objects. They 
track objects visually, altering their gaze to maintain contact 
with them. Certain combinations of mouthing, looking at, and 
manipulating objects have been categorized as a type of exam-
ining behavior that provides infants with a scheme for gather-
ing information about novel objects (Ruff, Saltarelli, Capozzoli, 
& Dubiner, 1992). As products of this active engagement 
with the object world, two related but independent aspects of 
infant intelligence develop: an understanding of the nature of 
objects, and the ability to categorize similar ones.
The Nature of Objects. Through looking, manipulat-
ing, and examining, infants establish that objects have basic 
properties. In the discussion of vision, we pointed out that 
very young babies recognize the contours of objects and that 
by 4 months, they seem to perceive objects just as adults 
would. That is, babies see objects as separate from each 
other, defi ned by boundaries, taking up space, having depth, 
In the second phase, fi rst habits, the refl exive responses are 
used to explore a wider range of stimuli. Babies explore toys, 
fi ngers, parents’ noses, and blankets by sucking on them. 
Gradually, they discover the unique properties of objects and 
modify their responses according to the demands of the spe-
cifi c objects. The fact that a baby can satisfy the need to suck 
by bringing an object to the mouth is a very early form of 
purposive causal behavior.
The third and fourth phases involve coordination of 
means and ends, first with familiar situations and then 
with new ones. In the third phase, circular reactions, babies 
connect an action with an expected outcome (Wentworth 
& Haith, 1992). They shake a rattle and expect to hear a 
noise; they drop a spoon and expect to hear a noise when 
it hits the fl oor; they pull Daddy’s beard and expect to hear 
“ouch.” They do not understand why a specifi c action leads 
to the expected outcome, but they show surprise when the 
expected outcome does not follow.
In the fourth phase, coordination of means and ends, infants 
use familiar actions or means to achieve new outcomes. 
They may shake a rattle to startle Mommy or pull Daddy’s 
beard to force him to look away from the television set. The 
means and the outcomes have become quite distinct. There 
can be no question about the purposiveness of behavior at 
this point. At this stage, coordination of means and ends are 
closely tied to a specifi c context. For example, a baby may 
know how to make certain kicking motions to move a mobile 
or to get a toy to jiggle in the crib. But in another room with 
the same toy, the baby may not make the same connection. 
This may explain why babies perform less competently in 
the laboratory environment than they do at home. Many 
causal strategies that become part of a baby’s daily reper-
toire are supported by the context of a familiar environment 
(Rovee-Collier, Schechter, Shyi, & Shields, 1992).
The fi fth phase, experimentation with new means, begins 
as children experiment with familiar means to achieve new 
goals. When familiar strategies do not work, children will 
modify them in light of the situation. One can think of this 
stage as sensorimotor problem solving. Children will try to 
reach a drawer by standing on a box, fi x a broken toy with 
a string, or make a gift by wrapping a toy in a piece of 
tissue.
The last phase in the development of sensorimotor cau-
sality, insight, involves mental manipulation of means–end 
relationships. Instead of actually going through a variety of 
physical manipulations, children carry out trial-and-error 
problem-solving activities and planning in their minds, 
anticipating outcomes. They can sort out possible solutions 
and reject some without actually having to try them. The 
result is insight: Mental experimentation brings the child to 
the best solution, which is the only one necessary to enact.
The capacity to perceive oneself as a causal agent and 
to predict the outcome of one’s actions are essential to the 
development of a sense of competence, which involves 
investigation of the environment, directed problem solving, 
and persistence toward a goal. At later stages, the abilities

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
objects, they appear to have a memory for the locations of 
objects. Baillargeon’s studies demonstrate that infants can 
follow an object through at least three different ways of 
hiding it: by placing the object in a container; by moving 
the object behind a screen; or by covering the object (Bail-
largeon, 2004).
Young infants have a well-developed sense of objects 
as distinct, permanent structures that will be set into 
motion when they are pushed, knocked, or in some other 
way launched by another object. They also expect that, 
once in motion, an object will follow a prescribed trajec-
tory (Belanger & Desrochers, 2001). The infant’s ability to 
anticipate an object’s trajectory behind a screen is an early 
step in a sequence of abilities that will eventually produce 
the complex search process that Piaget described (Wilcox, 
Schweinle, & Chapa, 2003).
The Categorization of Objects. Physical objects have 
four basic properties:
 1. Objects have a location, and a path and speed of motion.
 2. Objects have mechanical properties that include how 
they move and their relation to other objects.
 3. Objects have features, such as their size, shape, and 
color.
 4. Objects have functions; this is what objects do or how 
they are used (Wilcox, Schweinle, & Chapa, 2003).
As infants explore and experiment with objects, they 
begin to devise schemes for grouping objects together. They 
modify these schemes to add new items to the category and 
to differentiate one category from another. Categories can be 
based on the physical properties of objects, such as smooth 
and rough, or on the functions of objects, as in something 
to sit on and something to dig with. The classifi cation of 
objects and events into categories is one method infants 
have of coping with the vast array of new experiences they 
encounter.
Categorization is an aid to information processing. By 
treating certain individual objects as similar because they 
belong to the same basic grouping, like two individual red 
blocks or two wiggly goldfi sh, the potential amount of infor-
mation to process is reduced. Categories can be specifi c, such 
as cups, chairs, and cars, or abstract, such as tools, food, or 
animals (Minami & Inui, 2005; Freedman et al., 2001). If 
an item is classifi ed as a member of a category, then all the 
information that has been accumulated regarding that cate-
gory can automatically be applied to the specifi c object. This 
process aids in the storage and recall processes of memory, 
in reasoning and problem solving, and in the acquisition of 
new information. Classifi cation of objects into categories is 
a cognitive capacity that becomes increasingly sophisticated 
over the childhood years.
As we pointed out earlier in the chapter, one category 
that has special meaning for infants is faceness. By 6 months 
of age, infants attribute clear expectations to faces. They 
expect faces to be organized in a certain pattern and to move 
and having certain attributes of weight, color, malleability, 
texture, and the capacity to contain something else or not. 
All of these properties influence the types of actions that 
infants use to explore the objects and the ways they are even-
tually woven into other actions (Xu, 2003).
Object Permanence. Piaget (1954) argued that under-
standing the properties of objects was one of the foundations 
of logical thought. One of the most carefully documented of 
these properties is object permanence—the concept that 
objects in the environment are permanent and do not cease 
to exist when they are out of reach or out of view. A perma-
nent object retains its physical properties even when it can-
not be seen.
Piaget suggested that initially, the infant is aware of only 
those objects that are in the immediate perceptual field. 
If a 6-month-old girl is playing with a rattle, it exists for 
her. If the rattle drops out of her hand or is taken away, 
she may show some immediate distress but will not pursue 
the rattle. The attainment of the concept of the permanent 
object frees children from reliance only on what they can 
see. The ability to hold the image of an object in the mind 
is a critical step in the emergence of complex representa-
tional thinking.
Piaget suggested that the capacity to understand that 
objects continue to exist requires a level of representational 
or symbolic thinking, which would permit an infant to 
hold the idea of the object in mind while it was hidden. 
It also requires a combination of sensorimotor capacities 
that permit the infant to become actively engaged in reach-
ing, tracking, and uncovering hidden objects and learning 
about the spatial properties of objects in the environment. 
Thus, according to Piaget, the first real evidence that 
infants have the ability to pursue a hidden object could not 
really be observed much before 8 or 9 months of age, when 
babies begin to crawl; and the full confi dence in an object’s 
permanence could probably not emerge much before 16 to 
18 months, when infants have access to representational 
thinking. By this age, infants can imagine various move-
ments and displacements of objects without actually view-
ing them.
A growing body of research has focused on what infants 
know and expect about objects well before they can crawl 
or pursue objects through space. In a series of experiments, 
Renée Baillargeon (2008) has tried to determine how 
infants evaluate objects that are hidden from view. One of 
the features of her experiments is that she has deleted the 
motor search component that is required in Piaget’s studies 
of object permanence. Most of her experiments use habitu-
ation in pretest conditions and a change in looking time as 
evidence for infants’ reactions to an unexpected outcome. 
You may recall from the earlier section that habituation 
refers to the fact that with repeated exposure to a stimu-
lus, the infant pays less and less attention to it. Based on 
her studies, she has been able to demonstrate that even at 
very early ages, before infants can search for and retrieve

the second year of life, babies know that objects have certain 
stable features, that some objects belong with others, and 
that objects have names. With these achievements, infants 
impose a new degree of order and predictability on their 
daily experiences.
The Prefrontal Cortex and 
Infant Intelligence
The cognitive skills that we have described in the preceding 
sections, particularly the ability to anticipate what actions will 
result in which consequences, the ability to develop a plan 
and follow it through in order to achieve a goal, and the ability 
to categorize objects and understand the rules that distinguish 
one set of objects from another, are all evidence of a capacity 
to generalize principles and devise abstract rules from experi-
ence. The human brain is ready at birth to detect a wide range 
of sensory stimuli, and, as we have discussed, there are also 
prewired refl exes that link stimuli with responses. With expe-
rience and biological maturation, all of these systems mature 
and become increasingly attuned to features of the environ-
ment. However, in addition to the sensory and motor systems, 
the hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to derive 
abstract concepts, rules, and generalizations from sensory and 
motor experiences and to apply them in new situations. The 
area of the brain that appears to be responsible for supporting 
these capacities is the prefrontal cortex.
The prefrontal cortex is more developed in humans than 
in other species, and, within humans, continues to develop 
into the mid twenties. It has been viewed as the brain’s exec-
utive, an area of the brain that is highly interconnected with 
all the sensory and motor systems, and with areas of the 
brain associated with emotion, memory, and reward (Miller, 
Freedman, & Wallis, 2002). The neurons in the prefron-
tal cortex can be activated from all the sensory domains in 
anticipation of events, during actions, and during memory 
of past events. One of the key features of neurons in the 
prefrontal cortex is their ability to sustain mental activ-
ity for several seconds without additional stimulation. As a 
result, the neurons of the prefrontal cortex are able to guide 
actions for the period of time it takes to transmit signals to 
other related brain areas in order to accomplish a task. Neu-
roimaging studies of infants fi nd that the prefrontal cortex 
is involved in language processing, identifi cation of novel 
stimuli, working memory, goal-oriented reasoning, and an 
understanding of objects. From ages 6 to 12 months, infants 
perform increasingly better on tasks that require them to 
resist distractions, a capacity that has been strongly associ-
ated with frontal cortex development (Holmboe, Menoda, 
Fearon, Csibra, Sasvari-Szekely, & Johnson, 2010). People 
with damage in the prefrontal cortex can recognize objects, 
engage in conversation, and have no significant memory 
impairment. Yet, they have trouble staying on task; they 
have diffi culty resisting impulses to act in response to envi-
ronmental stimuli. They tend to act on a whim without 
regard for the consequences.
and respond in special ways (Nelson, 2001). Six-month-
old infants can categorize faces as attractive or unattractive 
(Ramsey et al., 2004).
A second related category that appears early in infancy is 
the distinction between people and inanimate objects (Ells-
worth, Muir, & Hains, 1993; Rakison & Poulin-Dubois, 
2001). Infants have been observed to smile, vocalize, and 
become more active when interacting with people as com-
pared to things. By 3 months of age, infants show their abil-
ity to categorize stimuli as people or things by smiling almost 
exclusively at people. Infants may look with equal interest 
at inanimate objects, especially novel ones, but their smiles 
are reserved for people. This distinction between the social 
and the nonsocial realm can be considered a foundational 
category. It provides evidence for the unique role of social 
relationships in the process of adaptation and growth. From 
this basic distinction between a person and a thing, many 
further categories, such as father and mother, familiar and 
stranger, or adult and child, emerge that begin to differenti-
ate the infant’s social world.
Research on infant categorization skills typically involves 
sorting objects or images into groups. Using a habituation-
type methodology, the earliest form of categorization can be 
observed. When 4.5-month-old babies see an object alone, 
and then placed next to a different object, they respond in 
a way that indicates their recognition that the two objects 
are different (Needham, 2001). Using visual silhouettes, 3- 
and 4-month-old babies were able to distinguish between 
images of cats and dogs, primarily through a comparison of 
the information in the shape and features of the silhouette 
heads (Quinn, Eimas, & Tarr, 2001; Quinn, Doran, Reiss, 
& Hoffman, 2009). Thus, at very early ages, infants are 
able to differentiate and group people and objects in their 
environment.
The categorization process advances over the first 24 
months as features of objects are differentiated and linked 
to concepts and functions. Information about the shape and 
size of objects seems to guide an infant’s identifi cation and 
categorization of objects by 4.5 months. At 7.5 months, 
infants make use of information based on differences in pat-
tern, and by 11.5 months they incorporate color and shini-
ness as features that help guide categorization (Woods & 
Wilcox, 2010).
By 15 months, babies will touch all the objects that 
belong to one category and then touch all the objects in 
another category. By 18 months of age, children can perform 
multidimensional categorization tasks (e.g., sorting eight 
objects, such as four brightly colored yellow rectangles and 
four human-shaped plastic fi gures, into two distinct groups; 
Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1987, 1992). This kind of sorting does 
not require the ability to give names to the objects. How-
ever, by 20 months, infants will use both visual cues and 
names to categorize objects. The larger the infant’s vocabu-
lary, the more likely the baby is to use names to help group 
objects together (Nazi & Gopnick, 2001). Thus, categoriz-
ing and naming appear to be closely linked. By the close of

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
Babbling
Babbling, initially characterized by sounds used in many 
languages, begins to refl ect the sounds and intonation infants 
are most likely to hear. Sounds they do not hear drop out of 
their babbling and, at about this same time, their capacity 
to differentiate among language sounds not found in their 
native language diminishes (Bates et al., 1987). This envi-
ronmental shaping of language competence provides another 
example of the plasticity of brain functions. Some networks 
grow and become strengthened by experience, whereas 
others wither and are absorbed into the neural mass.
Babbling begins to take on a special character, connecting 
consonants and vowels and repeating these combinations, 
when the baby is around 6 to 10 months. Although parents 
may eagerly receive this type of babbling as evidence of fi rst 
words (i.e., baba, mama, dada), there is debate about whether 
these repetitions of babbling sounds have a symbolic value.
One sound that is especially important in the parenting 
process is “Mama.” The infant word for mother has many 
similarities across hundreds of language groups. In a study of 
“Mama” sounds, a pediatrician asked 75 parents of newborns 
in his practice to listen for mama sounds (Goldman, 2001). 
If they heard one, he asked them to note the infant’s age; the 
circumstances of the sound (time of day, etc.); if they could 
determine whether the infant wanted something, and if so, 
what; and if the sound was directed at anyone, to whom 
it was directed. Of the 75 parents, 52 spoke only English. 
Other languages included Spanish, Hindi, Italian, Russian, 
Hebrew, Ibo, Chinese, and some combination of Spanish 
and Greek or Italian. Fifty-fi ve of the parents heard a mama 
sound, often as part of a cry. Thirty-two infants made the 
mama sound for the fi rst time in the fi rst 2 months of life. It 
became more distinct and more of a whine or call as it was 
repeated over the fi rst 6 months. For those babies who made 
mama sounds, the sound was interpreted as an indication of 
wanting—especially wanting to be picked up, wanting atten-
tion, or wanting to be taken out of the crib or infant seat 
and entertained. An implication of this research is that by 
2 months, many infants have the ability to use a noncrying 
vocalization to serve as a call that brings caregiver attention.
Communication with Gestures
By 8 months, infants use sounds like grunting and whining in 
combination with gestures to achieve a goal. Sounds combined 
with gestures and looks in a certain direction become part of 
purposeful communication—trying to get the caregiver to 
reach a cookie or get a certain toy off the shelf. A common fi rst 
gesture is to raise the arms up toward the caregiver in a desire 
to be picked up (Fenson et al., 1994). Sounds may also be 
used to express emotion or to get someone’s attention. When 
Jakob was about 14 months, he used the gesture of shaking 
his hands to signal that he was all done with his food. This was 
much preferred to having him throw the food on the fl oor!
Three other communicative strategies emerge at about 
9 to 11 months. Infants begin to seek adult interest and 
attention by showing them objects and thereby initiating 
Communication
Objective 4. To characterize forerunners of language 
competence from birth through the fi rst 2 years of life.
Many of the notable achievements in language competence 
occur during toddlerhood (ages 2 and 3) and will be discussed 
in detail in Chapter 6. However, as you have already learned, 
auditory experiences in the prenatal period and continuing 
in infancy inform babies about the sounds and rhythm of the 
language that is spoken by their mothers. Through visual and 
auditory experiences, they see and hear people talking, making 
gestures, and combining language with actions. So even though 
infants may not be active partners in the spoken language of 
their home and culture from birth, they begin to participate in 
rhythmic communication exchanges through gazing, smiling, 
cooing, and coordinated play. Research on language develop-
ment has focused on the many forerunners of language com-
petence that emerge from birth through the fi rst 2 years of life.
Thought and language seem to travel independent courses 
that typically intersect during the second year of life. Before 
that time, one can distinguish meaningful communication 
that does not require speech, such as pointing and gestur-
ing, and vocalizations that are not meaningful, such as bab-
bling and cooing. A rare genetic disease, Williams syndrome, 
illustrates that the capacities for language and cognition are 
distinct. Children with Williams syndrome are typically very 
talkative and sociable; they develop a large vocabulary and 
speak in grammatically correct sentences. Although their 
speech indicates some developmental abnormalities, it is 
much further advanced than their other cognitive functions. 
For example, children with Williams syndrome may have 
diffi culty with tasks that are easy for most middle-school-
age children, like tying their shoes, subtracting 2 from 4, 
or writing their street address (Schultz, Grelotti, & Pober, 
2001). This genetic condition forces one to think about lan-
guage competence separate from other cognitive abilities. Of 
course, one does not have to go to the extreme of people with 
Williams syndrome to fi nd examples of people whose speech 
seems disconnected from their ability to think and reason.
Language Perception
Infants are able to recognize sounds and differentiate between 
sound combinations long before they are able to produce lan-
guage or understand word meaning. This capacity to recog-
nize language sounds, including the phonetic combinations of 
letters and words and the intonation of words and sentences, 
is called language perception (Tsao, Liu, & Kuhl, 2004). 
Young infants are able to hear and distinguish among the 
major language sounds used in natural language. By 5 months 
of age, infants are able to differentiate words that emphasize 
the fi rst syllable, like father, and words that emphasize the 
second syllable, like begin. By this age, they also recognize the 
sound of their own name (Mandel, Jusczyk, & Pisoni, 1995; 
Weber, Hahne, Friedrich, & Friederici, 2004).

been addressed, illustrates the parents’ active role in guiding 
the construction of this knowledge base (Chouinard, 2007).
Baby Signs
Building on the emerging capacity of infants to invent gestures 
for shared communication, Linda Acredolo and Susan Good-
wyn began to study the role of symbolic gestures in preverbal 
infants. During the second year of life, it is not uncommon 
for infants and their caregivers to use symbolic gestures, like 
waving bye-bye, putting the thumb to the mouth to request or 
refer to a bottle, or using a throwing motion to suggest play-
ing ball. Infants are avid observers of such action-meaning 
combinations, and once established, parents seem enthusias-
tic about using them to enhance communication. Following 
these naturalistic observations of symbolic gestures, Acredolo 
and Goodwyn conducted experimental research to increase 
parents’ use of symbolic gestures with their infants, and to 
evaluate the impact of this intervention on subsequent lan-
guage development. One question their research addressed 
was whether exposure to an expanded capacity for symbolic 
gestures might replace a child’s need for spoken language and 
thereby delay language production.
In one study, three groups of parent-infant dyads were 
compared; one received symbolic gesture training, one 
received training to include verbal labels in interaction with 
their infants but no training in symbolic gestures, and one 
received no special training. The verbal labeling group was 
created in order to rule out the potential benefi t of any type 
of special attention or training on babies’ language acquisi-
tion. The infants were all healthy, 11-month-old babies at 
the start of the study (Goodwin, Acredolo, & Brown, 2000). 
For the symbolic gesture group, the target gestures included 
simple movements for fi ve object and three nonobject con-
cepts: “fi sh” [SMACKING LIPS], “fl ower” [SNIFFING], “bird” 
[FLAPPING ARMS], “airplane” [SWOOPING HAND MOVE-
MENT], “frog” [FIST OPEN AND CLOSE], “Where is it?” 
[PALMS UP AND OUT], “more” [FINGER TO OPPOSITE 
PALM], and “all gone” [PALM DOWN, BACK AND FORTH]. 
For the verbal labeling group, the target words included 
“kitty,” “doggy,” “ball,” “shoe,” “boat,” “bye-bye,” “more,” 
and “all gone.” Families in the symbolic gesture group were 
encouraged to invent their own additional gestures, and fam-
ilies in the verbal labeling group were encouraged to provide 
other labels as they interacted with their babies. These fami-
lies were also given toys to take home that corresponded to 
the target words in order to encourage the use of gestures 
or labels. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted 
every 2 weeks to learn about how often and in what con-
texts the gesturing or labeling activities were taking place. 
Infants in all three groups were tested at 11 months for base-
line data, and then again at 15, 19, 24, 30, and 36 months to 
evaluate both expressive and receptive language.
In the follow-up phone conversations it was determined 
that the infants in the symbolic gesture group had acquired 
an average of 20 gestures that were initiated by the infant 
and used in a regular, patterned way to refer to objects or 
an interaction. Soon after showing, the infant begins giv-
ing objects. Adults who are willing to engage in this type 
of exchange will fi nd the baby bringing them a whole vari-
ety of toys, utensils, and pieces of dirt or dust for inspec-
tion. Following giving, a common next key gesture is 
pointing. There is some debate about whether pointing is 
a form of reaching or a way of getting an adult’s attention 
to notice an object. In either case, it is an example of an 
infant’s initial ability to establish a shared reference point 
with respect to some object in the environment. The role 
of gestures in establishing intersubjectivity is an excel-
lent example of the interdependence of motor, social, 
and psychological systems as they combine to support 
language development (Iverson & Thelen, 1999).
Gestures are a way for a nonverbal child to ask for additional 
information. Pointing or reaching may be precursors of asking 
a question like “what is this?” or “where is this?” This prever-
bal question-asking behavior is fundamental to the knowledge 
acquisition process and illustrates the child’s early active role 
in seeking information. The way that adults respond to these 
gestures, by ignoring them, responding to them, or providing 
additional information once the initial request or question has 
Gestures, such as pointing, are forms of preverbal communication.

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
First Words
From infancy to toddlerhood, one of the most signifi cant changes 
that takes place is that words emerge as more salient than ges-
tures as a way to refer to objects (Namy & Waxman, 2002). 
Around the age of 8 months, infants understand the meanings 
of some individual words and phrases (Harris, 1992; Fenson 
et al., 1994). This ability to understand words, called receptive 
language, precedes language production, the ability to produce 
spoken words and phrases. You can direct a baby’s glance by say-
ing, “Look at the fl owers,” or “Do you want candy?” At this age, 
babies can go through their paces in the ever delightful game of 
“point to your nose, eyes, ears,” and so on. The number of words 
infants understand increases rapidly after 12 months. According 
to one analysis, 16-month-olds have a receptive vocabulary of 
between 92 and 321 words (Fenson et al., 1994).
One of the first significant events in the development 
of language production is the naming of objects. With rep-
etition, a sound or word becomes associated with a specifi c 
object or a set of related objects. For example, a child may 
say ba whenever she sees her bottle. If she is thirsty and 
wants her bottle, she may try saying ba in order to infl uence 
her caregiver to produce the bottle. Gestures, actions, and 
facial expressions often accompany the baby’s word and help 
establish its meaning in the caregiver’s mind. If the baby’s 
word has meaning to the caregiver and serves to satisfy the 
baby’s needs, it will probably be retained as a meaningful 
sign. The word ba may come to mean “bottle” and other liq-
uids the child wishes to drink, such as juice, water, or milk.
The important characteristic of fi rst words is their shared 
meaning. Even though ba is not a real word, it functions in 
the same way that any noun does—it names a person, place, 
or thing. These single-word utterances accompanied by ges-
tures, actions, vocal intonation, and emotion are called holo-
phrases. They convey the meaning of an entire sentence. For 
example, saying “ba, ba” in a pleading tone while pointing 
to the refrigerator and bouncing up and down conveys the 
meaning “I need a bottle,” or “Get me the bottle.” Gradually, 
the child discovers that every object, action, and relationship 
has a name. Rapid progress occurs between 12 and 16 months 
in the naming of objects. By 16 months a typical infant has a 
productive vocabulary of 26 words. Table 5.4 provides a sum-
mary of milestones in language over the fi rst 16 months of life.
Young children fi rst talk about what they know and what 
they are interested in. Common fi rst words include impor-
tant people (Mama, Dada, names of siblings), foods, pets, 
toys, body parts (eye, nose), clothes (shoe, sock), vehicles 
(car), favorite objects (bottle, blanket), other objects in the 
environment (keys, trees), actions (up, bye-bye), yes, no, please, 
down, more, pronouns (you, me), and states (hot, hungry). Lois 
Bloom (1993) has suggested that a “principle of relevance” 
guides the early acquisition of new words. Babies pay spe-
cial attention to words and expressions that are most closely 
linked with what they are doing and thinking about at the 
time. For that reason, the actual vocabulary that is acquired 
during infancy is quite idiosyncratic, refl ecting the themes 
and experiences of each child’s everyday life.
situations that generalized beyond the object to which the 
gesture fi rst referred. Babies in the verbal labeling group were 
compared to those in the control group to evaluate the impact 
of the training effect without gestures. There were no signifi -
cant differences in performance between these two groups. 
However, when compared to the control group, babies in 
the symbolic gesture group showed advanced performance 
in expressive and receptive language as well as advances in 
their ability to use two-word combinations at 15, 19, and 24 
months. There were no signifi cant differences between the 
symbolic gesture group and the control group at 36 months.
The authors point to several processes at work that may 
help account for the role of gesture training for language devel-
opment. First, it increases the amount of infant-directed speech 
between adults and infants. Second, it encourages commu-
nication around activities and objects that the infant is inter-
ested in, thereby creating more shared attention and fostering 
a greater motivation on the infant’s part to attend to and engage 
in communication. Third, the gestures serve as a scaffold, 
allowing conversations to expand from the initial identifi cation 
of an object or action of interest into more talk, new gestures, 
and greater appreciation for the use of language for increasing 
understanding and social connection. The results of this and 
related research has led to a new enthusiasm for teaching sym-
bolic gestures to infants, incorporated into a program called 
Baby Signs (Acredolo, Goodwyn, & Abrams, 2002).
Early Grammar Recognition
Grammar refers to rules that guide the combination of words 
and phrases in order to preserve meaning. In English, for 
example, sentences are usually formed from nouns (peo-
ple, places, or things) or noun phrases, followed by verbs 
(actions) or verb phrases (e.g., “The girl reads the book”). 
Certain cues about the way words are used in a sentence or 
their order in a sentence convey their meaning. For example, 
the word “the” is a signal that a noun will follow.
By 7 to 8 months of age, infants show the ability to rec-
ognize the specifi c regularities in spoken speech and to detect 
rules about the combination of language sounds. For example, 
babies were exposed to a long string of nonsense syllables for 
2 minutes. In this string, certain sounds were always followed 
by other sounds. For example, pa was always followed by biku. 
In the test situation, babies recognized the difference between 
a sound combination that was used frequently in the string 
of sounds, such as pabiku, and a combination that was used 
very infrequently (Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996). In other 
studies, babies were habituated to 2 minutes of a grammar in 
which sentences followed an ABA form, such as ga ti ga, or a 
grammar that followed the ABB form, such as ga ti ti. In the 
test situation, babies recognized the difference between the 
grammar to which they were habituated and an inconsistent 
grammar made up of entirely different sounds (Marcus, 2000). 
The implication of these fi ndings is that long before babies can 
produce words, word phrases, or grammatically correct sen-
tences, they are gathering information about the rules that hold 
sounds and phrases together in order to make meaning.

 
Developmental Tasks | 161
the prolonged dependent status of human infants, this attach-
ment/caregiving system is foundational to survival. It creates 
the social context through which infants are protected and 
loved, and sets the stage for the establishment of the radius of 
signifi cant relationships that emerge over the next stages of life.
The Development of Attachment
Attachment theorists have described a sequence of stages 
in the formation of the attachment relationship, much of 
which takes place during the fi rst 12 months of life (Bowlby, 
1969/1982; Ainsworth, 1973, 1985; Marvin & Britner, 1999; 
see Table 5.5). Many of the sensory and motor competencies 
described earlier in this chapter contribute to an infant’s abil-
ity to establish a vivid mental representation or scheme of 
the caregiver and to stimulate caregiving behaviors. In the 
fi rst stage, during the fi rst 3 months of life, infants engage 
in a variety of behaviors, including sucking, rooting, grasp-
ing, smiling, gazing, cuddling, crying, and visual tracking or 
following, which serve to maintain closeness with a caregiver 
or bring the caregiver to the infant. Through these contacts, 
babies learn about the unique features of their caregivers. 
Caregivers, for their part, use a variety of strategies including 
eye contact, touching and holding, and vocalizing as means 
of establishing and maintaining social engagement with 
their infants (Akhtar & Gernsbacher, 2008). Caregivers and 
infants experience repeated interactions, which result in the 
formation of predictable patterns. Infants begin to internalize 
Attachment
Objective 5. To understand social attachment as the 
process through which infants develop strong emotional 
bonds with others, and to describe the dynamics of 
attachment formation during infancy.
Have you ever wondered how feelings of love and connect-
edness form between babies and their caregivers? At birth, 
an infant has some familiarity with the sound and rhythm 
of the mother’s voice but a newborn does not show evidence 
of a specifi c emotional preference for the biological mother 
over other responsive adults. By the end of the fi rst year of 
life, however, babies not only know their caregivers but also 
have very strong emotional preferences for these adults over 
all others. Attachment is the process through which people 
develop specifi c, positive emotional bonds with others. John 
Bowlby proposed the notion of the attachment behavior system 
as an organized pattern of infant signals and adult responses 
that lead to a protective, trusting relationship during the very 
earliest stage of development. The nurturing responses of the 
caregiver form a corresponding behavioral system referred to 
as parenting or caregiving (Ainsworth, 1985; Bowlby, 1988).
From an ethological perspective, the coordinated attach-
ment and caregiving systems form a pattern of mutual regula-
tion through which the infant alerts the caregiver to distress, 
and the caregiver provides protection, comfort, and care. Given 
TABLE 5.4 Milestones in Language Development from 12 Weeks to 16 Months
AT THE COMPLETION OF:
VOCALIZATION AND LANGUAGE CHARACTERISTICS
12 weeks
Markedly less crying than at 8 weeks; when talked to and nodded at, smiles, followed by squealing/
gurgling sounds usually called cooing, that is vowel-like in character and pitch-modulating; sustains cooing 
for 15–20 seconds.
16 weeks
Responds to human sounds more defi nitely; turns head; eyes seem to search for speaker; occasionally 
some chuckling sounds. Recognizes the sound of his/her name.
20 weeks
The vowel-like cooing sounds begin to be interspersed with consonantal sounds; acoustically, all vocalizations 
are very different from the sounds of the mature language of the environment.
6 months
Cooing changing into babbling resembling one-syllable utterances, neither vowels nor consonants have 
very fi xed recurrences; most common utterances sound somewhat like ma, mu, da, or di.
8 months
Reduplication (or more continuous repetition) becomes frequent; intonation patterns become distinct; 
utterances can signal emphasis and emotions. Produces meaningful gestures like wanting to be picked up, 
showing, or giving. Understands some words and phrases.
10 months
Vocalizations are mixed with sound play such as gurgling or bubble blowing; appears to wish to imitate 
sounds, but the imitations are never quite successful; expansion in comprehension of words.
12 months
Identical sound sequences are replicated with higher relative frequency of occurrence and early word pro-
duction (mama or dada); understands about 50 words and simple commands (i.e., “Show me your eyes.”).
16 months
Has a defi nite repertoire of about 40 words (the top 90th percentile has 180-word vocabulary); still much 
babbling but now of several syllables with intricate intonation pattern; no pattern; words may include 
items such as thank you and come here, but there is little ability to join items into spontaneous two-word 
phrases; understanding is progressing rapidly.

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
caregiver. In Stage 2, the baby looks intently, reaches toward 
the caregiver’s face, and pulls the caregiver’s hair.
In Stage 3, from about 6 to 9 months, babies seek physi-
cal proximity with the objects of attachment. The ability to 
crawl and to coordinate reaching and grasping contribute 
to greater control over the outcomes of their actions. In this 
phase, babies experiment with fi nding an optimal distance 
from the caregiver. They may crawl away, look back, and 
then, depending on the caregiver’s perceived availability, 
crawl back to the caregiver or smile and continue exploring. 
If the caregiver is preoccupied or out of sight, the baby may 
cry to bring the caregiver closer or to reestablish contact.
In Stage 4, from about 9 to 12 months, babies form their 
mental representation of their caregivers. This mental picture 
provides the fi rst robust working model of an attachment 
relationship. Specifi c characteristics of a caregiver and expec-
tations about how the caregiver will respond to the infant’s 
actions are organized into a complex attachment scheme 
including expectations about how the caregiver will respond 
when the child is frightened, hurt, or distressed.
In Stage 5, in toddlerhood and later, young children 
use a variety of behaviors to infl uence the behavior of their 
parents and other objects of attachment in order to satisfy 
their own needs for closeness. Bowlby described this new 
and important capacity as the creation of a goal-corrected 
partnership. Children may ask to be read to, cuddled at 
bedtime, and taken along on errands. These and other strat-
egies produce caregiver behaviors that will satisfy a child’s 
continuing needs for physical contact, reassurance, close-
ness, and love. As children become aware that other people 
have their own separate points of view, they begin to include 
the other person’s needs and goals into their plans.
As children mature, they begin to conceptualize new risks 
and threats to their security. They may initiate new strategies 
for maintaining closeness to the objects of their attachment. 
Especially when they are undergoing unusual stress, as in 
times of illness, divorce, or rejection, children of any age may 
try to activate the attachment system by sending signals that 
are intended to evoke the caregiver’s comfort and closeness.
Stranger Anxiety. During the second half of the first 
year, two signs of a child’s growing attachment to a specifi c 
rhythmic patterns of interaction, which lays a foundation for 
expectations about interpersonal communication.
In the second stage, from about 3 to 6 months, an infant’s 
attachment is expressed through preferential responsiveness to 
a few familiar fi gures. Infants smile more at the familiar per-
son than at a stranger. They show more excitement at that per-
son’s arrival, and appear to be upset when that person leaves. 
During this phase, babies initiate more interactions toward the 
familiar caregiver. They are able to control the interaction by 
linking a chain of behaviors into a more complex sequence. In 
Stage 1, for example, the baby may look intently at the primary

contribute to the formation of an early scheme for their mother.

one often sees stronger expressions of suspiciousness or fear 
among adults encountering strangers than among babies.
Separation Anxiety. At about 9 months, infants give 
another indication of the intensity of their attachment to 
their parents. They express rage and despair when their par-
ents leave them. This reaction is called separation anxiety. 
A baby’s response to separation depends on the conditions. 
Infants are less distressed when mothers leave them alone in 
a room at home than when they do so in a laboratory (Ross, 
Kagan, Zelazo, & Kotelchuck, 1975). They are less likely 
to protest if the mother leaves the door to the room open 
than if she closes the door as she leaves. Separation from the 
mother for periods of 30 minutes has been identifi ed as a 
distinct source of stress for babies 9 months of age and older. 
Neurological and biochemical evidence of stress, includ-
ing increases in adrenocortical activity and concentrations 
of cortisol in the saliva, were associated with 30 minutes 
of separation from the mother in a laboratory situation 
(Larson, Gunnar, & Hertsgaard, 1991; Gunnar, Larson, 
Hertsgaard, Harris, & Brodersen, 1992). The impact of 
stressful separations can be seen in the disruption of basic 
physical patterns, especially sleep disturbances, and in 
regression to more immature forms of play behavior, aimless 
wandering, and altered interactions with peers and teachers 
in the childcare setting (Field, 1991).
Babies’ responses to separation also appear to be related to 
their temperament. Babies who have a strong negative reaction 
to uncertainty, those who are especially distressed when they 
are confi ned or prevented from attaining a goal, and those who 
person are observed: stranger anxiety and separation anxiety. 
Stranger anxiety refers to the baby’s discomfort or tension in 
the presence of unfamiliar adults. By 6 months of age, most 
babies can distinguish a picture of their mother from a pic-
ture of a stranger (Swingler, Sweet, & Carver, 2010). Babies 
vary in how they express their protest to strangers and in 
how intensely they react (Rieser-Danner, 2003). They may 
cling to their parents, refuse to be held, stiffen at the strang-
er’s touch, or merely avert their eyes from the stranger’s face.
The baby’s response to a stranger depends on specific 
features of the situation, including how close the mother is, 
how the stranger approaches the baby, and how the mother 
responds to the stranger. For example, if a mother speaks in a 
positive tone of voice to her baby about a stranger, the baby’s 
response to the stranger is likely to be positive. In contrast, 
if the mother interacts with the stranger in a socially anxious 
manner, the baby will be more fearful of the stranger. This 
effect is especially notable in infants who are temperamen-
tally more fearful and inhibited (deRosnay, Cooper, Tsigaras, 
& Murray, 2006). The baby’s response will also be infl uenced 
by the amount of prior experience with unfamiliar adults. 
Some children are in childcare arrangements where adults fre-
quently come and go. In some parts of the world, babies rarely 
come into contact with anyone outside of their small village. 
Strangers are more unfamiliar to infants in some cultures 
and contexts than in others (Rothbaum et al., 2000). Nor-
mally, wariness of strangers is considered a positive develop-
mental sign—that is, babies are able to detect the differences 
between their parents and adults they do not know. Wariness 
of strangers continues to be expressed throughout life. In fact, 
With Dad nearby, Jakob can begin to explore this new environment and return to his secure base as needed.

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
and activity (Feldman, 2003). In a study of 126 firstborn 
sons, 60% were found to have secure attachments with their 
fathers at 13 months of age (Belsky, 1996).
Attachments to Mother, Father, and Metapelet: The 
Israeli Case. In Israel, kibbutz-reared infants showed great 
similarity between their attachment to their fathers and to 
their specially trained caregiver (called metapelet). However, 
there was no consistent pattern of similarity in the quality of 
their attachments to mother and father and to mother and 
metapelet (Sagi et al., 1985). In subsequent research, when 
these kibbutz-reared children were 5 years old, the quality 
of their infant attachment to the metapelet was a signifi cant 
predictor of their socioemotional development as observed in 
school and at free play in their dormitory (Oppenheim, Sagi, 
& Lamb, 1988). In the Israeli case, where there are multiple 
caregivers, it has also been observed that when one attach-
ment relation is negative, it can negatively infl uence other 
attachment relations. For example, in a study of more than 
750 Israeli infants, those who experienced poor quality care 
in center-based settings were also more likely to develop 
insecure attachments with their mothers (Sagi et al., 2002).
This research suggests that in the Israeli case, the combined 
contribution of multiple secure attachments, rather than the 
mother-infant relationship alone, is the best predictor of sub-
sequent social competence (Sagi & van IJzendoorn, 1996). 
Exactly how infants synthesize the internal representations of 
various attachments is not well understood. Possibly, the dis-
tinct relationships have relevance for different interpersonal 
domains or become central as individuals assume diverse social 
roles as friends, parents, or supervisors and teachers of others.
Patterns of Attachment
It is important to distinguish between the presence of an 
attachment and the quality of that attachment. According 
to attachment theory, if an adult is present to interact with 
the infant, an attachment will be formed. However, indi-
vidual differences emerge in the quality of that attachment, 
depending on the accumulation of information the infant 
gathers over many instances when the infant is seeking 
reassurance, comfort, or protection from threat (Weinfi eld, 
Sroufe, Egeland, & Carlson, 1999). The adults’ acceptance of 
the infant and their ability to respond to the child’s varying 
communications are important to forming a positive, secure 
attachment. The caregivers’ patterns of expressing affection 
and rejection will infl uence how well babies can meet their 
strong needs for reassurance and comfort.
The Strange Situation. Differences in the quality of 
attachment have been assessed through systematic observa-
tions of babies and their caregivers in a standard laboratory 
procedure called the strange situation (Ainsworth, Blehar, 
Waters, & Wall, 1978; Bretherton, 1990). During an approxi-
mately 20-minute period, the child is exposed to a sequence 
of events that are likely to stimulate the attachment behav-
ior system (see Table 5.6). The situation introduces several 
are upset by novelty or who tend to withdraw from it fi nd the 
experience of separation more stressful than others. Unique 
strategies of caregiving might be needed to buffer these babies 
from the stressful impact of separation (Rettew et al., 2006).
A baby’s responses to separation and reunion have been 
used as key behavioral indicators of attachment quality. 
Babies who are described as having an insecure attachment 
are more distressed when they are separated from their moth-
ers, and the mothers appear to be less responsive in calming 
their babies following separation (Harel & Scher, 2003).
Over time, most babies become more fl exible in response 
to parents’ temporary departures. Young children learn to 
tolerate brief separations. At 2 years of age, children are able 
to use a photograph of their mother to help sustain their 
adaptation to a new setting in the mother’s absence (Pass-
man & Longeway, 1982). By the age of 3, children may even 
look forward to a night with a babysitter or an afternoon 
at grandfather’s house. Once the attachment is fully estab-
lished, children can comfort themselves by creating mental 
images of their parents and by remembering their parents’ 
love for them. During infancy, however, the parents’ physical 
presence remains a focal point of attention and concern.
Formation of Attachments with Mother, 
Father, and Others
Most infants have more than one caring person with whom 
they form an attachment. Most commonly, the fi rst object of 
attachment is the mother, but fathers, siblings, grandparents, 
and childcare professionals also become objects of attachment. 
Several factors have been identifi ed as important for predicting 
which people will form the infant’s hierarchy or radius of sig-
nifi cant attachment fi gures (Colin, 1996; Cassidy, 1999):
 1. The amount of time the infant spends in the care of the 
person.
 2. The quality and responsiveness of the care provided by 
the person.
 3. The person’s emotional investment in the infant.
 4. The presence of the person in the infant’s life across time.
Attachments to Mothers and Fathers. Infants tend 
to have the same type of attachment with their fathers and 
their mothers, but these relationships are established inde-
pendently and depend on the amount of time the infant and 
parent spend together as well as the quality of the interac-
tions (Fox, Kimmerly, & Schafer, 1991). Early studies found 
that babies tended to have more playful interactions with 
their fathers—smiling, laughing, and looking—and more 
comforting, stress-reducing interactions with their mothers 
(Lamb, 1976). Recent studies confi rm that infants experi-
ence positive emotions as they play with their mothers and 
fathers. However, the intensity and rhythm of the experi-
ences seem to differ with each parent. In mother-infant inter-
actions, babies seem calmer, and their happy expressions are 
part of a social dialogue. In father-infant interactions, the 
babies are more excited, showing sudden bursts of laughter

cooperatively to their mothers’ requests. One can sense that 
securely attached babies have a working model of attachment in 
which they expect their caregiver to be accessible and respon-
sive. Mothers of infants who have secure attachments are able to 
talk openly and coherently about their own childhood attach-
ment fi gures and attachment behaviors (van Ijzendoorn, 1995).
Infants who show an anxious-avoidant attachment 
avoid contact with their mothers during the reunion seg-
ment following separation or ignore their efforts to interact. 
They appear to expect that their mothers will not be there 
when needed. They show less distress at being alone than 
other babies. Mothers of babies who were characterized as 
anxious avoidant seem to reject their babies. It is almost as if 
they were angry at their babies. They spend less time holding 
and cuddling their babies than other mothers, and more of 
their interactions are unpleasant or even hurtful. At home, 
these babies cry a lot, they are not readily soothed by contact 
with the caregiver, and yet they are quite distressed by sepa-
rations. Mothers of infants who show an anxious-avoidant 
attachment are often dismissive or devaluing of their own 
childhood attachment experiences (Main & Solomon, 1990).
Infants who show an anxious-resistant attachment are 
very cautious in the presence of the stranger. Their explor-
atory behavior is noticeably disrupted by the caregiver’s 
departure. When the caregiver returns, the infants appear to 
potentially threatening experiences, including the presence of 
a stranger, the departure of the mother, being left alone with 
a stranger, and being left completely alone—all in the con-
text of an unfamiliar laboratory setting. During this sequence, 
researchers have the opportunity to make systematic observa-
tions of the child’s behaviors, the caregiver’s behaviors, and the 
characteristics of their interactions. These behaviors are coded 
and compared across varying segments of the procedure.
Four Patterns of Attachment. Four patterns of attach-
ment behavior have been distinguished using the strange 
situation methodology: (1) secure attachment, (2) anxious-
avoidant attachment, (3) anxious-resistant attachment, and 
(4) disorganized attachment.
Infants who have a secure attachment actively explore the 
laboratory setting and interact with strangers while their moth-
ers are present. After separation, the babies actively greet their 
mothers or seek interaction. If the babies were distressed dur-
ing separation, once the mothers return, the infants go to the 
mothers for comfort, and the mothers effectively reduce their 
distress. Then the babies resume exploring the environment.
When observed at home, babies who have a secure attach-
ment cry less than other babies (Tracy & Ainsworth, 1981; 
Ainsworth, 1985). They greet their mothers more positively 
on reunion after everyday separations and respond more

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
have no consistent strategy for managing their distress. They 
behave in contradictory, unpredictable ways that seem to 
convey feelings of extreme fear or utter confusion (Belsky, 
Campbell, Cohn, & Moore, 1996). Observations of moth-
ers and infants who are described as having a disorganized 
attachment highlight two different patterns. Some moth-
ers are negative, intrusive, and they frighten their babies in 
bursts of intense hostility. Other mothers are passive and 
helpless, rarely showing positive or comforting behaviors. 
These mothers appear to be afraid of their babies, perhaps not 
trusting their own impulses to respond appropriately (Lyons-
Ruth, Lyubchik, Wolfe, & Bronfman, 2002). The mothers 
often have experiences of loss or abuse in their childhood 
that have disrupted their own attachment experiences.
In U.S. samples, about two thirds of the children tested 
have been characterized as securely attached. Of the remain-
der, more children fall into the anxious-avoidant category 
than into the anxious-resistant category (Ainsworth et al., 
want to be close to the caregiver, but they are also angry, so 
that they are very hard to soothe or comfort. Infants who 
are characterized as anxious-resistant have mothers who are 
inconsistent in their responsiveness. Sometimes, these moth-
ers ignore clear signals of distress. At other times, they inter-
fere with their infants in order to make contact. These infants 
do not know if their needs will be attended to. Although 
these mothers enjoy close physical contact with their babies, 
they do not necessarily do so in ways appropriate to the 
baby’s needs. The result is the formation of an internal work-
ing model of attachment that is highly unpredictable. These 
babies try to maintain proximity and to avoid unfamiliar sit-
uations that increase uncertainty about accessibility to their 
caregiver. Caregivers of infants who have formed an anxious-
resistant attachment are overly preoccupied with confl icts 
around their own childhood attachment issues.
In the disorganized attachment, babies’ responses are 
particularly notable in the reunion sequence. These babies 
Is There a Sensitive 
Period for 
Attachment?
A SENSITIVE PERIOD is a time of 
 maximal sensitivity or readiness for the 
development of certain skills or be-
havior  patterns. The particular skill or 
behavior pattern is not likely to emerge 
before the onset of the period, and it is 
extremely diffi cult if not impossible to 
 establish once the critical time period 
has passed. The successful emergence 
of any behavior that has a sensitive 
 period for development depends on the 
coordination of the biological readiness 
of the organism and environmental 
supports (Scott, 1987).
Konrad Lorenz (1935, 1937/1961) 
was one of the fi rst ethologists to 
compare the critical periods in physical 
development and those in behavioral 
development. Lorenz described a 
process of social attachment among 
birds that he called imprinting. In this 
process, the young bird establishes a 
comparatively permanent bond with 
its mother. In her absence, however, 
the young bird will imprint on other 
available targets, including a model of 
its mother or a human being. For birds, 
the onset of the critical period coincides 
with the time at which they are able 
to walk and ends when they begin to 
fear strangers. After this point, no new 
model or species can be substituted as a 
target for imprinting.
Is there a time when infants are most 
likely to form such an attachment to 
the primary caregiver? Is there a point 
after which such attachments cannot be 
formed? The answer to these questions 
is especially relevant for policies related 
to foster care and adoption. We need 
to know about the plasticity of social 
attachment in order to support optimal 
social and emotional development.
Evidence to address these questions 
has been drawn from real-life situations 
in which mother-infant relationships have 
been disrupted. Leon Yarrow (1963, 1964, 
1970) observed 100 infants who were 
shifted from foster mothers to adoptive 
mothers. The infants who were separated 
from their foster mothers at 6 months 
or earlier showed minimal distress. They 
did not express prolonged anger or

mutually rewarding interactions (Isabella & Belsky, 1991). A 
sensitive caregiver is able to recognize the infant’s emotional 
state, empathize with it, and make an appropriate response. 
A parent might recognize that the infant is distressed but be 
too busy or preoccupied to respond or to provide effective 
comfort (Leerkes, Crockenberg, & Burrows, 2004). Caregiv-
ers who are psychologically available, responsive, consistent, 
and warm in their interactions with their babies—especially 
during the fi rst 6 months of the baby’s life—are found to be 
most successful in establishing a secure attachment relation-
ship that can be measured by the time the baby is 12 months 
old (Braungart-Rieker, Garwood, Powers, & Wang, 2001). 
The way caregivers respond when infants are distressed is 
uniquely related to the formation of a secure attachment inde-
pendent of how they respond to other infant cues ( Leerkes, 
Blankson, & O’Brien, 2009). This makes sense since the 
attachment system is theorized to be especially adapted to 
protecting infants from threat. The Applying Theory and 
1978). Only a small percentage of infants show the disor-
ganized pattern (Radke-Yarrow, Cummings, Kuczynski, & 
Chipman, 1985; Carlson, Cicchetti, Barnett, & Braunwold, 
1989; van IJzendoorn et al., 1992). Research has suggested 
links between the disorganized attachment and serious men-
tal health problems in later childhood and beyond, including 
depression, borderline personality, and dissociative reactions 
(Lyons-Ruth et al., 2002; Fonagy, 2003).
Parental Sensitivity and the Quality of 
Attachment
How can we account for differences in the quality of the 
attachment? Early work on the formation of a secure attach-
ment argued that a cornerstone in this process was maternal 
sensitivity (Ainsworth et al., 1978). Sensitivity is defi ned as 
attentiveness to the infant’s state, accurate interpretation of 
the infant’s signals, and well-timed responses that promote 
depression over the separation if their 
physical and emotional needs continued 
to be met. In contrast, all the infants who 
were transferred from foster mothers 
to adoptive mothers at 8 months or 
older showed strong negative reactions, 
including angry protest and withdrawal. 
These infants found the disruption of 
their earlier relationships very stressful.
Later research by John Bowlby (1980) 
focused on adolescents who had moved 
repeatedly from one foster home or 
institution to another. These children 
never had an opportunity to form an 
enduring, loving relationship with a 
caring adult. As adolescents, they were 
described as affectionless and unable 
to form close relationships with others. 
Subsequent studies of adopted children 
have confi rmed that children who spend 
their infancy in institutions where the 
turnover in caregivers is high show 
disruptions in social functioning, including 
indiscriminate friendship formation, 
diffi culty in forming close relationships, 
and diffi culty in fi nding emotional support 
from peers (Rutter, 1995).
In the 1990s, a large number of 
orphans from Romania were adopted by 
families in the United States, Canada, and 
several European countries. While in the 
Romanian orphanages, these children had 
been exposed to a variety of neglectful 
conditions including: poor nutrition, 
little attention or adult interaction, and 
long periods of time in their cribs with 
little opportunity for stimulation or play. 
Those who were adopted by 4 months of 
age seemed to develop quite normally. 
However those who were adopted at 
8 months of age or older had a wide 
range of cognitive and affective problems 
that lasted into childhood. In particular, 
those who had longer exposure to the 
Romanian orphanages had disrupted 
social competence characterized by 
an overly friendly style of interaction 
regardless of whether the person was a 
familiar caregiver or a complete stranger, 
and a lack of close connection to their 
adoptive parents (Carlson & Earls, 1997; 
Gunnar, 2000; Rutter et al., 2010).
From these real-world examples 
of disruption in the mother-infant 
relationship, we can say that a sensitive 
period for attachment must begin at 
about 6 months of age. However, it is not 
clear if there is a time after which a secure 
attachment can no longer be established. 
In a study of children who spent their 
fi rst years of life in an institution where 
the quality of care was good but staff 
turnover was high, children who were 
adopted at age 2 were able to form 
secure attachments to their adoptive 
parents. However, at later observations 
at ages 8 and 16, the children showed 
evidence of diffi culty in peer relations 
similar to the children who remained in 
the institution (Hodges & Tizard, 1989). 
Lack of continuity in caregiving during 
infancy is likely to produce long-lasting 
disruptions in relationship formation, 
even if a secure attachment with a 
caregiver is formed at a later time.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. From a developmental perspective, 
what do you conclude about a sensi-
tive period for the formation of social 
attachment?
 2. How would you design a research 
study to evaluate whether there is a 
sensitive period for the formation of 
a secure attachment? What kinds of 
evidence would be needed to de-
termine whether there is a sensitive 
period for attachment?
 3. How would you determine whether 
the problems arising from disruptions 
in early caregiving were a result of 
a lack of attachment or some other 
explanation such as poor nutrition or 
lack of stimulation?
 4. Can you think of other aspects of 
infant development that might be 
characterized as having a sensitive 
period for optimal emergence?
 5. Based on what you have read about 
attachment, what implications can 
you draw regarding the process of 
foster care and adoption?

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
Ethnographic studies (in-depth observations of behaviors 
central to the survival of a group, such as caregiving strate-
gies) document the widespread practice of shared child care. 
When many adults and older siblings share responsibility for 
infant care, a child’s needs can be readily met. When mothers 
expect to be able to share the tasks of infant care with oth-
ers, they may also have a different ideal about the quality of 
infant attachment, a model that is less exclusive and possibly 
less emotionally intense. As a result, infants emerge with a 
more confi dent mental representation about the willingness 
of others to protect and care for them (Seymour, 2004).
The Caregiver’s Personal Life Story. Aspects of the 
caregiver’s personal life story contribute to being able to serve 
as a secure base for a child. Adults who recall their own par-
ents as accepting, responsive, and available are more likely to 
be able to transmit those qualities as they enact the caregiver 
role. Adults who have experienced early loss or disruption 
of an attachment relationship have more diffi culty providing 
a secure base for their offspring (Fonagy, Steele, & Steele, 
1991; Belsky, 1996). Studies suggest that the internal work-
ing model of an attachment relationship may be transmitted 
across generations, with mothers and fathers drawing on the 
model of an attachment they formed as infants and young 
Research to Life box discusses the possibility that there may 
be a sensitive period for the development of attachment.
Four factors come into play in producing the kind of sen-
sitivity that underlies secure attachments: (1) cultural and 
subcultural pathways, (2) the caregiver’s personal life story, 
(3) contemporary factors, and (4) characteristics of the infant 
(see Figure 5.5).
Cultural and Subcultural Pathways. Cultural and sub-
cultural pathways are integrated into one’s mental represen-
tation of a parent or caregiver. The culture’s beliefs about 
infants, including how fragile or vulnerable they are, how 
best to help infants cope with distress, and what skills or 
temperamental qualities are most valued, are likely to shape 
a caregiver’s practices (Coll, 2004). For example, Japanese 
mothers keep close, continuous proximity to their infants. 
Separations are infrequent, and infants are expected to mon-
itor their mothers’ reactions in order to assess people and 
objects in the environment. Japanese mothers subtly direct 
their infants’ play behavior through gestures and facial 
expressions. Independent play is not especially valued, and 
the idea that children would handle separation and reunion 
with the mother with little distress is not expected by 
Japanese caregivers (Okimoto, 2001).

The Relevance of Attachment 
to Subsequent Development
The nature of one’s attachment and the related internal 
working models of attachment influence expectations 
about the self, others, and the nature of relationships 
(Shaver, Collins, & Clark, 1996). Moreover, the formation 
of a secure attachment relationship is expected to infl u-
ence the child’s ability to explore and engage the environ-
ment with confi dence, knowing that the protective “other” 
is near at hand. Children who experience a secure attach-
ment are less likely to be exposed to uncontrollable stress. 
They experience rhythmic, meaningful, and predictable 
interactions that contribute to their social competences. 
As a result, they are hopeful about their ability to form 
positive relationships with others (Weinfi eld et al., 1999). 
Securely attached infants become preschoolers who show 
greater resilience, self- control, and curiosity. In contrast, 
infants who have a disorganized attachment are very hos-
tile, aggressive preschoolers (Hazan, Campa, & Gur-Yaish, 
2006). Results of numerous studies indicate that as they 
get older, children who have a disorganized attachment, 
especially boys, are at high risk for externalizing prob-
lems (Fearon, Bakermans-Kranenburg, van IJzendoorn, 
 Lapsley, & Roisman, 2010).
A clinical diagnosis—reactive attachment disorder—
has been linked to serious disturbances in infant attach-
ment. Two expressions of this disorder have been described: 
inhibited type, in which the person is very withdrawn, 
hypervigilant in social contacts, and resistant to comfort; 
and uninhibited type, in which the person shows a lack of 
discrimination, being overly friendly and attaching to any 
new person (DeAngelis, 1997b; Cain, 2006).
From a life-span perspective, the quality of the attach-
ment formed in infancy influences the formation of later 
relationships (Ainsworth, 1989). Children who have formed 
secure attachments in infancy are likely to fi nd more enjoy-
ment in close peer friendships during their preschool years. 
In an analysis of the results of more than 60 studies of the 
relationship of parent-child attachment and peer relations, 
the quality of attachment with the mother was consistently 
predictive of the quality of close peer friendships well into 
middle school and early adolescence (Schneider, Atkinson, 
& Tardif, 2001). Children who have secure attachments are 
more likely to attribute positive intentions to peers, whereas 
children with anxious attachments are more likely to view 
peers with wariness.
The attachment construct has been used to help explain 
the nature of adolescent and adult love relationships. 
Romantic relationships can be characterized along many 
of the same dimensions as infant attachments, including 
the desire to maintain physical contact with the loved one, 
increased disclosure and responsiveness to the loved one, the 
effectiveness of the loved one in providing comfort and reas-
surance that reduce distress, and an element of exclusiveness 
or preferential response to the loved one (Hazan & Shaver, 
1987; Reis, 2006).
children, which then guides their perceptions of infant cues 
and their own responses (George & Solomon, 1999; Born-
stein, 2002).
Contemporary Factors. Contemporary factors can 
infl uence the ability of an adult to provide a secure base 
for attachment. For example, some mothers experience 
high levels of postnatal depression. Depressed mothers 
are likely to be less attuned to their infants’ signals, less play-
ful, less verbally stimulating, more irritable, and generally 
less enthusiastic and happy as they interact with their infants 
(Edhborg, Lundh, Seimyr, & Widstroem, 2001). Attach-
ment insecurity is more likely when infants’ mothers are 
suffering from depression (Toth, Rogosch, Sturge-Apple, 
& Cicchetti, 2009). The role of the child’s father, and the 
relationship between the mother and father or the care-
giving partners are especially central. A partner who is 
supportive, involved in caregiving, and reassuring about 
meeting the challenges of parenting a newborn provides 
a context in which even mothers who have had insecure 
attachments themselves can thrive. On the other hand, 
some relationships are characterized by confl ict and poor 
communication, in which the partner may even compete 
with the infant for the mother’s care or impede the moth-
er’s efforts to care for her infant (Cowan, Cohn, Cowan, 
& Pearson, 1996). Other contemporary factors that infl u-
ence the caregiver’s sensitivity to the infant include the 
caregiver’s self-esteem, the degree of control the caregiver 
believes is necessary to have over the infant’s behavior, the 
presence of a supportive social network that validates the 
person’s caregiving efforts, the person’s involvement in the 
labor market, and fi nancial worries (George & Solomon, 
1999; Belsky, 2006).
Infant Characteristics. The quality of attachment can 
also be infl uenced by the characteristics of the infant. Infants 
born with physical abnormalities are more likely to evoke 
responses of rejection or neglect from caregivers (Langlois, 
Ritter, Casey, & Sawin, 1995). Physical conditions such as 
colic can test the parents’ commitment to caregiving and cre-
ate a cycle of anxiety and fearfulness. Babies with colic may 
not fi nd comfort in their caregivers’ efforts to soothe them, 
and caregivers may not experience a sense of effi cacy in their 
ability to calm their child.
Certain aspects of the infant’s temperament—especially fear-
fulness, sociability, and the intensity of negative emotions—may 
infl uence the way the attachment relationship is established 
(Izard et al., 1991). Studies have shown that temperament 
influences the kinds of caregiver responses that are most 
likely to create an internal sense of security or insecurity. 
Infants who are irritable are often difficult for parents to 
respond to. Over time, some parents may respond to diffi cult 
infants harshly or by withdrawing. These behaviors may pro-
duce an insecure attachment for the infant (Putnam, Sanson, 
& Rothbart, 2002).

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
Shaver, Albino, & Cooper, 2003). The contribution of attach-
ment orientation to intimate relationships will be discussed 
further in Chapter 11 (Early Adulthood).
The parenting relationship can also be understood as an 
elaboration of the attachment representation. Adults who 
have experienced a secure attachment in their own infancy 
are more likely to be able to comfort and respond to their 
children. Adults whose childhood attachments were unpre-
dictable or even hostile are more likely to have difficulty 
coping successfully with young infants’ needs (Ricks, 1985; 
George & Solomon, 1999). For example, in an observational 
study, parents were observed while their infants were having 
inoculations. Those parents who had an anxious-avoidant 
attachment style were less responsive to their infants’ distress 
in this context (Edelstein et al., 2004).
It may be obvious that people who have a secure attach-
ment benefi t from their belief that the world is a safe place 
and that others can be counted on to provide help under 
conditions of threat. Most of the time, people who have a 
secure attachment are more confi dent, work more effectively 
with others, and are better able to resolve interpersonal con-
fl icts than people who have an anxious-resistant or anxious-
avoidant attachment (Rom & Mikulincer, 2003; Mikulincer 
& Shaver, 2007). However, under some conditions, especially 
conditions of real danger or threat, people who have insecure 
attachments may be better able to cope specifi cally because 
they are likely to see situations as threatening, and other 
people as unlikely to meet their needs (Ein-Dor, Mikulincer, 
Doron, & Shaver, 2010). Anxiously attached individuals are 
more likely to detect dangers and alert others. Those with an 
avoidant attachment are more likely to depend on themselves 
and to resist becoming overly dependent on others. Under 
conditions of real threat, they may be the fi rst to fi nd a way to 
escape, acting quickly to save themselves. Whereas a securely 
attached person may underestimate dangers because of a gen-
eral feeling of safety, the anxiously attached person is likely 
to be among the fi rst to recognize real dangers. Whereas the 
securely attached person is likely to reach out to others under 
conditions of threat, the person with an avoidant attachment 
may be among the fi rst to fi nd a way to fl ee the danger. Thus, 
the survival of the group as a whole may be enhanced by the 
diversity of attachment orientations of the members.
Critique of the Attachment Paradigm. The attach-
ment paradigm and its measurement using the strange situa-
tion have signifi cant limitations especially when viewed from 
a cross-cultural or comparative cultural lens. Three criticisms 
are discussed here; you may think of others.
 1. The strange situation analyzes the child-caregiver attach-
ment based on how the infant copes with the stressors 
associated with separation from the caregiver. Although 
one might assume that infant-caregiver separation is a 
universal problem, it is much more common in some cul-
tures than others. For example, in many parts of Asia, Af-
rica, and South America, infants sleep with their mothers 
Fears about loss and abandonment, born from anxious 
avoidant attachments, are likely to result in anxiety about 
one’s contemporary romantic relationships:
I had a real problem trusting anyone at the start of any 
relationship. A couple of things happened to me when 
I was young, which I had some emotional diffi culties 
getting over. At the start of our relationship, if P. had 
been separated from me, I would have been constantly 
thinking: “What was he doing?”; “Was he with another 
girl?”; “Was he cheating on me?”; all that would have 
been running through my head. (Feeney, 1999, p. 365)
People with insecure attachments tend to be more coer-
cive and mistrustful. They tend to push their partners 
away. They may have problems establishing and maintain-
ing romantic relationships and in meeting the demands for 
sexual intimacy and disclosure in these relationships (Tracy, 
The attachment construct continues to be evident in adult, 
loving relationships. This mother and daughter enjoy physical 
closeness, comfort each other, and look to each other for 
reassurance in times of stress.

From this view, attachment is a foundation for subse-
quent independence. However, autonomy, exploration, 
and self-reliance are not primary goals of socialization in 
all cultures. Societies marked by greater value for inter-
dependence view the formation of infant attachment as a 
precursor to obedience, intragroup harmony, and accep-
tance of cultural norms and values. Thus, while the need 
to insure the survival of the young through sensitive and 
responsive care may be a cultural universal, the social-
ization goals that follow from the formation of a secure 
attachment may differ from one culture to the next de-
pending upon the culture’s goals, values, and traditions 
(Greenfi eld & Suzuki, 1998; Weisner, 2005).
The formation of an attachment relies on social, cogni-
tive and emotional capacities that emerge in infancy. Attach-
ments form as infants experience comfort when they are 
distressed. The sensitive caregiver may use multiple strate-
gies, including rocking and holding, gentle touch, vocaliza-
tions, and food, to reassure and soothe a baby. The caregiver 
also anticipates sources of distress and tries to keep them to 
a minimum, while engaging the baby in positive, pleasant 
interactions. Over time, infants learn to regulate their own 
emotional reactions, and to fi nd effective ways of conveying 
both positive and negative emotions in ways that will result 
in meaningful communication with others.

and are carried on the mother’s back or side throughout 
the day. Close physical contact is a culture’s way of con-
veying warmth and safety. The prolonged physical sepa-
ration that would occur if a baby sleeps in a bassinet or 
in a separate room would be considered harsh or cruel 
parenting. Thus, the premise that attachment can be as-
sessed by how well a baby copes with separation may be 
a poor yardstick in cultures where infant-mother sepa-
ration is rare and not highly valued (Greenfi eld, Keller, 
Fuligni, & Maynard, 2003).
 2. The attachment framework and the strange situation 
emphasize the nature of the mother-infant dyad as the 
prototype of an attachment relationship. Although some 
research has been carried out to compare attachment to 
mothers and fathers, or mothers and caregivers, the focus 
is on a dyadic attachment. However, in many cultures, 
the infant is cared for by a cluster or collective of older 
siblings, cousins, aunts, fathers, and uncles, as well as 
the mother and other specially designated caregivers. In 
these cultures, the ability of the child to feel safe and se-
cure depends on the coordinated care of many members 
of the family or village, rather than exclusive care by the 
mother. The strange situation in particular and the at-
tachment paradigm more generally do not capture the 
fl uid nature of this collective caregiving context and the 
degree to which it is effective in supporting a child’s feel-
ings of safety and security (Lewis, 2005).
 3. Infant-caregiver interactions can be understood as an in-
troduction to the nature of valued social relationships 
which, over time, will contribute to the child’s survival 
and successful integration into the social community. 
One of the assumptions of the attachment framework 
is that a secure attachment provides a safe harbor from 
which the child feels free to explore the environment. 
At 10 weeks of age, a baby’s 
 expression of emotion through 
 cooing and crying provides distinct, 
easily interpreted messages that cue 
caregivers to the baby’s inner states.

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
7 months of age, the infant’s mobility is quite limited. The 
cry is one of the primary signals available that will bring the 
caregiver to the infant. Infant cries vary in pitch as well as in 
tempo and duration. Adults have measurable emotional reac-
tions to infant crying, including changes in heart rate, breath-
ing, and perspiration, which indicate that the cry serves as 
a stressor (Brewster, Nelson, McCanne, Lucas, & Milner, 
1998). Studies from laboratory and natural fi eld settings and 
across cultures suggest that high-pitched cries are considered 
more upsetting to the caregiver and are treated as a signal 
of a more urgent need than are low-pitched cries. Moreover, 
information is contained in the pauses between cries. Cries 
that involve shorter pauses between crying sounds are per-
ceived by adults as more arousing and unpleasant (Zeskind, 
Klein, & Marshall, 1992).
A broad pallet of emotions emerges gradually from the 
basic states of arousal and distress. The differentiation of 
emotions follows a regular pattern, as Table 5.7 suggests. 
This table describes age-related changes for three dimensions 
of emotion: pleasure-joy, wariness-fear, and rage-anger. Emo-
tional responses during the fi rst month are closely tied to the 
infant’s internal state. Physical discomfort, arousal, pain, and 
changing tension in the central nervous system are the major 
sources of emotions. During the period from 1 to 6 months, 
emotions begin to refl ect the infant’s awareness of features of 
the environment. Babies smile at familiar faces; they show 
interest in and curiosity about novel stimuli. They express 
rage when nursing is disrupted or when they are prevented 
from viewing an activity they have been intently watching.
From 1 to 6 months, the intensity of emotional expression 
becomes more varied. For example, four different kinds of 
infant smiles have been observed: the simple smile in which a 
baby’s mouth curves upward at the corner; the Duchenne smile, 
which involves crinkling eyes, raised cheeks, and an open, 
smiling mouth; the play smiles in which the jaw drops and the 
mouth stays open; and the duplay smiles in which the jaw drops 
Because of their essential role in survival and social interac-
tion, emotions have become an important focus of study in 
infant development. Emotional development during infancy 
can be understood along four dimensions. First, new emo-
tions emerge over the period of infancy. Infants express their 
emotions at different levels of intensity—for example, from a 
whimper or fussy noise to a full-blown angry rage, or from a 
happy cooing gurgle to outright laughter. Second, with cog-
nitive maturation, a child interprets events differently. New 
emotions may become attached to familiar situations. An 
experience that may once have caused wariness, such as a new 
toy or a loud noise, may become a source of excitement or joy 
as the child gains a new understanding of the situation. Third, 
children develop strategies for regulating their emotions, so 
that they are not overwhelmed by emotional intensity. Fourth, 
emotions serve as a channel for adult-infant communication.
Emotional Differentiation
Emotions gradually become differentiated during the fi rst 
2 years of life. Peter Wolff (1966) described seven states of 
arousal in newborn infants: regular sleep, irregular sleep, 
periodic sleep, drowsiness, alert inactivity, waking activity, 
and crying. Each is characterized by a distinctive pattern 
of breathing, muscle tone, motor activity, and alertness. In 
these states, one observes the earliest differentiation among 
distress (crying), interest (alert inactivity), and excitement 
(waking activity). A newborn’s state of arousal infl uences the 
capacity to respond to the environment. Changes in arousal 
state also serve to cue responses from caregivers. Crying usu-
ally brings an effort to comfort or soothe. Visual alertness is 
likely to prompt social interactions with caregivers who use a 
variety of strategies to sustain contact such as smiling, mak-
ing cooing sounds, or shaking a toy or rattle.
Crying is an especially important emotional expression 
that contributes to the infant’s survival. Until about 6 or

of facial expressions. One example of how emotions pro-
vide a window on meaning comes from a study of infants 
in an operant conditioning experiment. Infants at ages 2, 4, 
and 6 months were observed while they learned an operant 
arm-pulling task. A string was attached to the infant’s wrist. 
When the string was pulled, it activated a switch that turned 
on a color slide of an infant smiling accompanied by the 
sound of children singing the Sesame Street theme song. Dur-
ing the learning phase, pulling the string produced the visual 
and auditory stimulus. During the extinction phase, noth-
ing happened when the string was pulled. Even as young as 
2 months old, the babies’ expressions changed from inter-
est and enjoyment during the learning phase to anger and 
sadness during the extinction phase. The findings were 
interpreted to illustrate that infants’ anger is associated with 
violation of their expectations and that expressions of inter-
est and enjoyment are associated with learning and increased 
control (Sullivan, Lewis, & Alessandri, 1992).
An infant’s smile can have a wide variety of meanings and 
can be produced in response to many stimuli. The earliest 
smiles, observed during the fi rst month of life, may occur 
spontaneously during sleep or in response to a high-pitched 
human voice. Gentle tactile stimulation—touching, tick-
ling, and rocking—can produce these early smiles. A baby’s 
first smiles are not a true form of social communication, 
although they are likely to produce positive feelings in the 
adult caregiver (Wolff, 1963, 1987).
Social smiles begin to be observed at about 5 weeks of age. 
These smiles are fi rst produced in response to a wide range 
of stimuli: familiar faces and voices (especially the mother’s), 
strangers, and nonhuman objects. Games such as tickle and 
peek-a-boo bring on open-mouth smiles and laughter (Fogel et 
al., 2006). The social smile conveys both recognition of famil-
iarity and an invitation to further communication or interac-
tion. By 4 months of age, infants smile more when the pattern 
of interaction is organized and predictable than when it is ran-
dom and unfamiliar (Rochat, Querido, & Striano, 1999).
The cognitive smile develops alongside the social smile. 
Infants smile in response to their own behaviors, as if they 
were expressing satisfaction with their accomplishments 
or self-recognition. In a study of infants over the period 
from 7 to 20 weeks, babies were observed to show the coy 
smile—smiling while averting their gaze—when they were 
successful in getting attention or renewing attention from 
an adult (Reddy, 2000). As evidenced in the string-pulling 
task described previously, infants also smile elaborately when 
they are able to make something happen. These mastery 
smiles do not appear to have a social intention.
In the second year of life, smiling is associated with a 
primitive form of humor. Babies smile when they recognize 
an incongruity, such as seeing their mother drinking from a 
baby bottle or crawling on her hands and knees. They also 
smile and laugh when they violate a caregiver’s expectations. 
These smiles suggest that the baby appreciates something 
about the discrepancy between what is being presented and 
what is normally observed (Loizou, 2005).
and the cheeks are raised (Fogel et al., 2006). The simple smile 
is considered a signal of happy social engagement, whereas 
the Duchenne, play, and duplay smiles refl ect different levels 
of intensity in play that accompany such activities as tickling, 
peek-a-boo, and playful interactions with familiar caregivers.
The period from 6 to 12 months refl ects a greater aware-
ness of the context of events. Emotions of joy, anger, and fear 
are tied to a baby’s ability to recall previous experiences and 
to compare them with an ongoing event. These emotions also 
refl ect ability to exercise some control over the environment 
and frustration when goals are blocked. Fearfulness, assessed 
several times from 4 to 12 months, increases steadily over 
the fi rst year. Babies who are less fearful at 4 months show a 
steeper increase in fear than babies who are already tempera-
mentally fearful at a very young age (Gartstein et al., 2010).
The dimension of wariness-fear becomes more differenti-
ated during the second year. Wariness is viewed as an early 
feature of the attachment process, especially as it relates to 
stranger anxiety at about 6 months and separation anxiety at 
about 9 months. Anxiety of a more nonspecifi c form begins 
to be observed during the second year. Babies begin to antic-
ipate negative experiences and express fear of objects or 
events that have been associated with negative experiences 
in the past. The construct of anxiety is included as a major 
dynamic in describing patterns of attachment, especially in 
relationships characterized by potentially rejecting or unpre-
dictable caregivers.
By the end of the fi rst year, the extent of an infant’s nega-
tive emotions, such as irritability and fear, are infl uenced by 
the caregiver’s depression and anxiety. The impact of mater-
nal depression on infants’ psychosocial development has 
received a great deal of attention in the literature, demon-
strating that there are distinct differences in the emotional 
expressiveness and social engagement of infants of depressed 
mothers. Higher levels of maternal depression and anxiety 
in infancy are linked to greater increases in fearfulness at the 
end of infancy, and more symptoms of anxiety at age 2 (Gart-
stein et al., 2010). Positive emotions are not as clearly tied 
to the caregiver’s characteristics (Pauli-Pott, Mertesacker, & 
Beckman, 2004).
Emotions that are observed during the second year 
of life—especially anxiety, pride, defi ance, and shame—
suggest an emerging sense of self. Infants recognize that 
they can operate as causal agents. They also begin to 
respond to the emotions of others. They can give love to 
others through hugs, kisses, and tender pats. They can 
share toys, comfort another distressed infant, and imitate 
another person’s excitement. In becoming a more distinct 
being, an infant achieves a new level of awareness of the 
capacity to give and receive pleasure as well as the vulner-
ability of self and others.
Emotions as a Key to Understanding Meaning
An infant’s emotional reactions provide a channel for deter-
mining the meaning the child is giving to a specifi c situation. 
Often, these reactions are studied by the systematic coding

The Ability to Regulate Emotions
Emotional regulation refers to a variety of processes that 
allow infants to control the intensity of their emotional state 
and reduce feelings of distress. These abilities, which mature 
over the fi rst 2 years of life, have important implications for 
a child’s successful social participation in preschool and later 
childhood (Calkins, 2004). Infants develop a range of tech-
niques for coping with intense emotions, both positive and 
negative. Even newborns have some strategies for reducing 
the intensity of distress, such as turning the head away, suck-
ing on their hands or lips, or closing their eyes. As infants 
gain new motor coordination and control, they can move 
away, distract themselves with other objects, or soothe them-
selves by rocking, stroking, or thumb sucking (Kopp, 1989). 
However, there are also many instances when infants are not 
able to regulate the intensity of their emotions. Researchers 
who work with infants often note the number of babies who 
had to be eliminated from their study because they simply 
could not be calmed enough in the experimental procedure 
to attend to the task. The way an infant reacts to environ-
mental stimuli, and the intensity of that reaction is often con-
ceptualized as a refl ection of the concept of temperament.
Temperament. Temperament is a theoretical construct 
that refers to relatively stable characteristics of response to the 
environment and patterns of self-regulation (Thomas & Chess, 
1980; Putnam, Sanson, & Rothbart, 2002). Temperament is 
often viewed as the biological or physiological basis of person-
ality that can be observed early in infancy. When we describe 
babies as active, cheerful, quiet, or fussy, we are often making 
reference to what scholars study as temperament. Temperament 
is a significant source of individual differences that emerges 
from a combination of genetic, environmental, and socially 
constructed factors. Theorists have offered different views about 
the specific features of temperament and what accounts for 
the stability of these features. However, they all tend to agree 
on two aspects of temperament: (1) a primary feature of tem-
perament is the child’s positive or negative reaction to environ-
mental events, and (2) the stability of this reaction leads to a 
consistent response by others (Vaughn & Bost, 1999).
Dimensions of Temperament. Thomas, Chess, and 
Birch (1970) were able to classify infants into three tempera-
mental groupings: easy, slow to warm up, and diffi cult. Table 
5.8 summarizes the characteristics of each of these tem-
peraments and the percentages of the sample that could be 
clearly identifi ed as one of the three categories. Roughly 35% 
of the sample could not be classifi ed.
Three aspects of temperament—activity level, sociability, 
and emotionality—are thought to be influenced largely by 
genetic factors (Thomas & Chess, 1977, 1986; Buss & Plomin, 
1984, 1986; Goldsmith & Campos, 1986; Wilson & Matheny, 
1986; Goldsmith et al., 1987; Braungart, Plomin, DeFries, & 
Fulker, 1992; Saudino & Zapfe, 2008). Patterns of electrical 
activity in the frontal cortex in infancy have been associated 
with individual differences in these features of temperament,

diffi cult and had a hard time adjusting to new situations as 
they grew older.
The kind of caregiving a child receives will depend in part 
on the parental context. For example, a mother’s age, her 
economic resources, the nature of the neighborhood where 
she lives, and characteristics such as depression, stress, or a 
sense of parenting effi cacy might each infl uence how patient 
and supportive a mother may be with a child who has an 
emotionally negative or irritable temperament (Paulussen-
Hoogeboom, Stams, Hemranns, & Peetsma, 2007).
A growing body of research has expanded the idea that 
child outcomes are a product of child temperament and par-
enting strategies (Rothbart & Bates, 2006). Depending on the 
caregiving they receive and the environments they encounter, 
shy children can become sociable, fearful children can become 
secure explorers of their surroundings, and highly exuber-
ant children can develop considerable self-control (National 
Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2000, p. 389).
A few examples of this kind of interaction follow:
• Gentle, low-power discipline techniques are more effec-
tive in socializing infants who are relatively fearful and 
inhibited; these techniques do not work well with tem-
peramentally fearless infants who respond better to social-
ization strategies that emphasize positive feelings between 
the mother and child (Kochanska, Aksan, & Joy, 2007).
• Children who are fearful are more likely to be inhibited 
with their peers when their mothers are overprotective, 
but more confi dent with their peers when their mothers 
are reassuring and supportive of the child’s autonomy 
(Rubin, Hastings, Stewart, Henderson, & Chen, 1997).
• Parental use of harsh punishment is not predictive of 
aggressive behavior for children who are flexible and 
low in reactivity, but is strongly linked to aggressiveness 
among children who are inflexible and highly reactive 
(Patterson & Sanson, 1999).
These and other fi ndings are creating a complex picture 
of differential susceptibility to the features of the caregiving 
environment. A modest level of parental dominance or asser-
tiveness may be frightening and intimidating for a child with 
high behavioral inhibition, and completely insignifi cant for a 
child with low behavioral inhibition (Gilissen et al., 2007).
CASE STUDY
THE COTTON FAMILY
Nancy and Paul Cotton are a professional couple who gave 
birth to their fi rst child, Anna, after they had been married 
for 7.5 years.
Nancy said, “We wanted a baby but couldn’t decide when 
to have one. Finally we realized that we could not control 
everything, or time things perfectly. No one can predict the 
future. So we fi nally decided to go ahead and have a child as 
soon as possible. … We were both privileged, lucky, and had 
particularly distinguishing between babies who are more able 
to regulate their emotions, who are easily soothed, and who 
seem to be relatively positive as contrasted to the babies who 
are easily distressed, difficult to soothe, and have difficulty 
focusing their attention (Schmidt, Fox, Perez-Edgar, & Hamer, 
2009). These dimensions—especially emotionality and activ-
ity level—show modest stability over adjacent periods of 
infancy and toddlerhood (Henderson, Fox, & Rubin, 2001).
Another view of temperament focuses on the construct of 
behavioral inhibition, a combination of fearfulness, a low 
threshold for arousal in the presence of novel or unusual 
stimuli, and general cautiousness. A method of assessing 
behavioral inhibition involves presenting infants with a 
set of unusual stimuli and observing their reactions. Some 
infants seem to think this is great fun. They smile, coo, and 
respond with positive excitement. Other infants get very 
distressed. They cry, struggle, arch their backs, and try to 
escape the situation. These early reactions in the laboratory 
setting at 4 months of age are predictors of toddler behav-
ior. The infants who react positively to the novel stimuli 
are likely to become active, busy, exploratory toddlers. The 
infants who react with distress to the novel stimuli are likely 
to become fearful, shy, and socially wary toddlers (Kagan, 
Snidman, & Arcus, 1998).
A child’s temperament infl uences the tone of interactions, 
the frequency with which interactions take place, the way 
others react to the child, and the way the child reacts to the 
reactions of others. Highly active, sociable children are likely 
to initiate interactions and to respond positively to the atten-
tion of others. More passive, inhibited, or fearful children 
will be less likely to initiate interactions and may withdraw 
when other children or adults direct attention to them. There 
is growing concern that infants and toddlers who are tem-
peramentally shy, fearful, and readily distressed by novel or 
unfamiliar situations may be vulnerable to subsequent dif-
ficulties regulating anxiety and depression (Moffitt et al., 
2007).
Many studies emphasize the relevance of the fi t or match 
between the parent’s temperament and that of the child 
(Plomin, 1990; Rettew et al., 2006). Consider the role of 
temperament in the case study on the Cotton family.
Although temperament shows some consistency over the 
period of infancy and toddlerhood, it is only modestly stable 
over longer periods of time, depending on culture, mea-
surement techniques, and methods of analysis. Measures of 
temperament in infancy do not correlate all that highly with 
measures in the early and middle school years. In all like-
lihood, temperamental characteristics are modifi ed as they 
come into contact with socialization pressures at home and 
at school, as well as with new internal capacities to regulate 
behavior. For example, Thomas and Chess (1977, 1986) 
found that when parents were calm and allowed their dif-
fi cult children to adapt to novelty at a leisurely pace, the 
children grew more comfortable and had an easier time 
adapting to new routines. However, if parents were impa-
tient and demanding, then their diffi cult children remained

How Caregivers Help Infants Manage 
Their Emotions
One of the most important elements in the development of 
emotional regulation is the way caregivers assist infants to 
manage their strong feelings (Kopp, 1989; Tronick, 1989).
Caregivers can provide direct support when they observe 
that a child is distressed. They may cuddle, hug, rock, or 
swaddle a baby. They may offer food or a pacifi er to the baby 
or nurse her as a means of comfort. Through words and 
actions, the caregiver may help a child interpret the source of 
the stress or suggest ways to reduce the stress.
In a longitudinal study of maternal comforting strategies, 
mothers were observed as they tried to comfort their chil-
dren following an inoculation at 2 and 6 months of age. The 
intensity and duration of infant crying decreased over this 
4-month period. At the younger age, mothers used affection 
and soothing as comforting strategies when their babies cried 
after the shot; at 6 months, they used vocalization and dis-
tracting strategies more often, taking advantage of the infant’s 
more developed capacities for attention and playfulness. 
For all levels of infant distress, the most effective method of 
soothing was a combination of holding/rocking and vocal-
izing, combining the sense of touch and the rhythmic move-
ment of rocking with the calming features of the mother’s 
voice. Feeding or offering a pacifi er were effective as soothing 
strategies when the baby was moderately distressed, but not 
when the baby was extremely distressed. In general, caretak-
ing strategies, like changing the baby’s diaper or getting the 
baby dressed to leave the offi ce, were not especially effective 
soothing strategies (Jahromi, Putnam, & Stifter, 2004).
Concern has been focused especially on babies who 
show intense negative emotionality early in infancy. Babies 
who show high levels of motor activity and who cry a lot 
at 4 months of age have been found to show high levels of 
wariness, fearfulness, and shyness at later ages (Park, Belsky, 
Putnam, & Crnic, 1997). These babies tend to be at risk for 
subsequent behavior problems. Studies have been directed 
toward analyzing individual differences in negative emotion-
ality and the family characteristics that might be associated 
with changes in negativity over the fi rst year of life (Calkins 
& Howse, 2004; Pauli-Pott et al., 2004). In one such study 
involving 148 babies and their parents, characteristics of the 
mothers and the fathers were examined separately to learn 
what might lead to increased negativity in the infants from 
3 months to 9 months of age. In addition to the direct qual-
ity of interactions between the mother-infant and father-
infant pairs, researchers found that high levels of marital 
dissatisfaction on the part of the mother or the father and 
the father’s emotional insensitivity were tied to increases in 
lived well. By the time we had Anna, I was thirty-three, and 
our marriage and careers were established. We felt secure.
“Being an optimistic person, I guess I expected nirvana. Anna 
was diffi cult to deliver, and breastfeeding was a nightmare. Ev-
ery time she nursed, it hurt. But I didn’t want to miss the op-
portunity. I was so determined. I used a stopwatch to make sure 
Anna got enough milk, and I gave her a pacifi er for recreation. 
When she was fi ve weeks old, I went off to our summer house 
on Martha’s Vineyard. I wondered if it was the right decision be-
cause there was less in the way of family and friends for support. 
But we worked things out together that summer. She was ener-
getic from the fi rst, and I was constantly sleep-deprived, but we 
were oh! so close. I found ways to make it easier for us. I found a 
babysitter to give me an afternoon break; I used the “Swyngo-
matic” so that I could eat a warm supper every once in a while, 
and I learned to give Anna pacifi ers or bottles to soothe herself.”
Paul interjected: “She was like a miracle to me. She was 
fabulous! Miraculous! She even looked like me. I did as much 
for her as Nancy did, not out of guilt, but because I couldn’t 
keep my hands off her. I took her with me everywhere when 
I was off work. At the Stop-and-Shop, all the ladies crowded 
around me, ‘How do you do it? You’re so good with her!’” As 
he talked of Anna, his cheeks fl ushed, his whole body actively 
described the dramatic and exciting time they had together. 
“I learned all about babies from her. I can bathe a kid faster 
than anyone in the world.”
“I went back to work when Anna was three months,” said 
Nancy. “I found full-time help. That way, I could enjoy her when 
I was home and get away when I needed to. I am a high-activity 
person, so I could understand a high-activity child like Anna. We 
could cycle together. I’ve never felt a bit of anxiety or ambiva-
lence about her. I feel as if I’ve known her from the very fi rst.
“Anna fi t,” said Nancy. “From the time she was born, we’d 
pick her up and just go. As you can see, going is pretty im-
portant in our family, and Anna thrived on it. We were not the 
only ones who enjoyed her; my own mother thought she was 
fabulous. She took care of her part-time after I went back to 
work. I had a chance to see my mother be loving and kind, a 
good mother to Anna. It was like reliving my own childhood—
another kind of miracle. You see, I’d had a sister, Ginny, who 
had died. Anna gave my mother an opportunity to heal the 
pain of Ginny’s death. This was true for me, too. We called her 
Anna Virginia after this sister. Ginny had a devastating mental 
illness. Ginny’s spirit, intelligence, and humor seemed to live 
again in Anna, but without the shadow of vulnerability.”

Developmental Tasks | 177
Emotions as a Channel for Adult-Infant 
Communication
Emotions provide a two-way channel through which infants 
and their caregivers can establish intersubjectivity. An infant 
has the capacity to produce a range of emotional expressions, 
including fear, distress, disgust, surprise, excitement, interest, 
joy, anger, and sadness. Parents and other caregivers rely on 
the facial, vocal, and behavioral cues related to these emotions 
as ways of determining an infant’s inner states and goals and 
responding to them. Babies in turn can also detect and differ-
entiate the affective expressions of others. Young infants can 
differentiate facial expressions of fear, anger, happiness, sad-
ness, and surprise. In cycles of interaction, responsive caregiv-
ers monitor changes in a baby’s affect as a way of determining 
whether their interventions are effective (Meins, 2003).
Think of a 6-month-old baby who wants a toy that is out 
of reach. The baby waves her arms in the direction of the 
toy, makes fussy noises, and looks distressed. As her father 
tries to figure out what the baby wants, he watches her 
expressions in order to discover whether he is on the right 
track. Parents who are attuned to this form of communica-
tion are more likely to help babies to achieve their goals, and 
babies are more likely to persist in attempts to communicate 
because they have experienced success in such interactions. 
Through a shared repertoire of emotions, babies and their 
caregivers are able to understand one another and create 
common meanings. Thus, emotional expression becomes a 
building block of trust (Trevarthen & Aitken, 2001).
Social Referencing. One of the most notable ways that 
infants and adults have of co-constructing their reality is the 
mechanism of social referencing in which infants gather 
information about a situation or an object by assessing their 
parent’s or caregiver’s reactions. Social referencing involves 
three coordinated processes: (1) the infant coordinates atten-
tion between the adult and an ambiguous object or situation, 
the infant’s negativity. This is signifi cant because it suggests 
that the emotional climate of the parental system is commu-
nicated in ways that an infant can perceive as early as 3 to 9 
months of age (Belsky, Fish, & Isabella, 1991).
Caregivers’ approaches to infant emotional regulation vary 
with the culture (Kitayama, Karasawa, & Mesquita, 2004). 
In some cultures, caregivers regulate emotions by prevent-
ing a child from being exposed to certain arousing situations. 
Japanese mothers, for example, try hard to prevent their 
children from being exposed to anger by avoiding frustrat-
ing them. Furthermore, parents rarely express anger to their 
young children, especially in public. Thus, Japanese parents 
try to regulate anger by minimizing the child’s experiences 
with it. Cultural values infl uence how mothers respond to 
infants’ distress and what they teach their babies about how 
to regulate feelings of wariness, fear, and anxiety.
Infants achieve emotional regulation by observing emo-
tional reactions of others. Children observe anger, pride, 
shame, or sadness in others, often in response to their own 
emotional expressions. For example, Connie stumbles and 
falls in trying to take a step on her own. She looks up at her 
mother. If her mother looks upset and frightened, Connie 
may begin to cry. On the other hand, if her mother laughs or 
speaks to her in a comforting tone, Connie may get up and 
try again. Children can be distracted from their sadness by 
seeing laughter and joy in someone else. Through empathy, 
they can reduce their angry feelings toward someone else by 
seeing how sad or frightened the other person is.
As children understand the consequences or implica-
tions of a situation, they have new motives for regulating or 
failing to regulate their emotions. Children may extend or 
expand their signals of distress if they think they will help 
them achieve their goals, such as special attention or nurtur-
ing. Children may try to disguise their distress if they think 
it will provoke additional pain. Emotional regulation, like 
emotional signaling, takes place in an interpersonal context.
Emotions provide a channel of 
communication before speech and 
language. The exchange of playful 
laughing and smiling is an early form 
of conversation.

mechanism. Foods, toys, people, animals, sounds, plants, 
and objects of all sorts can be discerned as positive and 
approachable or negative and a cause for wariness. Depend-
ing on the cultural outlook, infants in different societies will 
begin to categorize their experiences differently based in part 
on these early appraisals derived from social referencing.
The Psychosocial Crisis: Trust 
versus Mistrust
Objective 7. To describe the psychosocial crisis of trust 
versus mistrust; the central process through which the 
crisis is resolved, mutuality with the caregiver; the prime 
adaptive ego quality of hope; and the core pathology of 
withdrawal.
The term psychosocial crisis refers to a state of tension that 
occurs as a result of the developmental needs of the individ-
ual and the social expectations of the culture. At each stage 
of life, the crisis is expressed as a struggle between the posi-
tive and negative poles of a critical dimension. In infancy, the 
specifi c nature of the crisis—trust versus mistrust—focuses 
on the fundamental nature of an infant’s sense of connection 
to the social world.
Trust
In adult relationships, trust refers to an appraisal of the avail-
ability, dependability, and sensitivity of another person (Miku-
lincer, 1998). Trust emerges in the course of a relationship as 
one person discovers those traits in another person. As the 
level of trust grows, the partners may take some risks by dis-
closing information or feelings that may lead to rejection. Rela-
tionships that endure through periods of risk grow in feelings 
of trust. However, trust is more than a summary of the past: 
It is a faith that the relationship will survive in an unpredict-
able future. This faith begins in infancy. A trusting relationship 
links confi dence about the past with faith about the future.
For infants, trust is an emotion—a positive experiential 
state of confidence that their needs will be met and that 
they are valued. Trust is inferred from the infant’s increas-
ing capacity to delay gratifi cation and from the warmth and 
delight that are evident in interactions with family members. 
The sense of trust expands from immediate figures in the 
social environment to the supportiveness and responsiveness 
of the broader social and physical world. Infants also learn 
to trust their sensory systems in processing stimulation from 
the environment. In this function, the sense of trust extends 
to learning to trust oneself.
The sense of basic trust is related to but not identical to 
Bowlby’s concept of attachment. Attachment refers to the 
behavioral system that ensures safety and security for the 
infant. Over time, the internal representation of the attach-
ment relationship generalizes to other dyadic (paired) 
(2) the infant understands that the adult’s emotional reaction 
refers to the specifi c object or situation, and (3) the infant 
uses the information from the adult’s emotional reaction to 
guide behavior toward the object (Hornik & Gunnar, 1988; 
Feinman et al., 1992; Murray et al., 2008). By 12 months 
of age, infants can draw upon all of these abilities to use the 
emotional responses of another person to guide their own 
behavior (Carver & Vaccaro, 2007). They often use their 
mothers as a social reference, but other adults can serve this 
function as well. As infants approach an unfamiliar adult, 
an ambiguous situation, or a novel object, they look to their 
mother and use her facial expression or verbal expressions 
as a source of information about the situation. If the mother 
expresses wariness or a negative emotion, the infant is more 
likely to withdraw or to explore with caution. On the other 
hand, if the mother expresses a positive emotion, the infant 
is more likely to approach the situation or the unfamiliar 
person with confi dence. By 12 months of age, infants con-
sistently use this mechanism to try to appraise an ambiguous 
situation (Rosen, Adamson, & Bakeman, 1992; de Rosnay, 
Cooper, Tsigaras, & Murray, 2006).
In an extension of the social referencing concept, research-
ers wondered whether infants could gather information by 
observing how adults interacted with each other in relation to 
an object (Repacholi & Meltzoff, 2007). In an experimental 
situation, infants observed while one adult (the experimenter) 
performed specifi c activities with an object and a second adult 
(the emoter) expressed either an angry or a neutral reaction 
to the fi rst adult. For example, the angry adult might say to 
the experimenter who was demonstrating an activity with an 
object: “That’s aggravating! That’s so annoying,” while speak-
ing in an angry tone of voice and using angry facial expres-
sions. Then the infants were given an opportunity to touch the 
object while the experimenter and the emoter sat quietly in the 
room. Infants who observed the angry emoter were less likely 
to imitate the activity, slower to touch the object, and more 
likely to look at the angry adult who remained in the room, 
even though the adult was now calm and neutral in behavior. 
In the angry emoter condition, the infants had fewer positive 
facial expressions during the time when they were allowed 
to explore the object. The results of this research suggest 
that infants can gather and retain information about how to 
interact with objects in their environment based on what they 
observe of the emotional reactions of others to these objects, 
even when the responses are not directed toward them.
Social referencing illustrates how members of a cultural 
group build a shared view of reality during infancy. Infants 
actively request information by looking to their mothers or 
other adults. They also eavesdrop on adults, watching and 
listening to the emotional tone of their interactions. The 
adult’s expression, either positive or negative, cues the infant 
about whether to approach or withdraw.
Infants reduce their uncertainty and begin to appraise 
their world in the context of the emotional responses of 
their caregivers. You can probably imagine the wide range 
of objects and situations that can be evaluated through this

and tone of voice in a specifi c context, oxytocin is released. 
The release of oxytocin then triggers a set of neural networks 
that reduces wariness and fear of others, and increases will-
ingness to trust the other person (Damasio, 2005; Kirsch 
et al., 2005).
Mistrust
During infancy, experiences of mistrust can arise from at 
least three sources: infant wariness, lack of confi dence in the 
caregiver, and doubt in one’s own lovableness. First, wari-
ness, one of the earliest infant emotions, is linked initially to 
at least two infant refl exes, the startle response in reaction to 
loud noises and the Moro refl ex in response to sudden loss 
of support (see Table 5.2). All infants are prewired neuro-
logically to be alert to certain environmental dangers. Infants 
are able to use sensory information, especially the ability to 
interpret facial expressions and the ability to differentiate 
auditory cues, to assess interpersonal anger or threat. By 6 
months of age, most infants show evidence of stranger anxi-
ety, another indication of normal capacities for wariness. Two 
of the caregiver’s functions are to minimize the infant’s expo-
sure to stimuli that evoke these responses and to comfort 
and reassure the infant after exposure to threatening stimuli.
Second, babies can lack confi dence in the good intentions 
of others. Most parents contribute to experiences of mistrust 
because they inevitably make some mistakes in responding 
to their infant’s signs of distress, particularly when the baby 
is young. They may first try the bottle, and, if the crying 
continues, they may change the diaper, give water, move the 
baby to another room, or put the baby to bed—trying a vari-
ety of things until something works. Over time, however, 
sensitive caregivers learn to interpret their child’s signals 
correctly and to respond appropriately, thereby fostering the 
infant’s sense of trust in the environment.
Some caregivers are unable to differentiate the infant’s 
needs or respond appropriately to them. Others are indiffer-
ent or unusually harsh. Under conditions of maltreatment, 
seeds of doubt may grow about the trustworthiness of the 
environment. Abused infants become especially sensitive to 
cues that suggest hostility or anger in their environment, and 
are more likely to fi xate on those cues, even when the threat 
has passed (Pollak, 2008).
Infants are not only aware of threats expressed toward them, 
but are sensitive to expressions of anger or hostility among 
other members of the household. Infants are attuned to angry, 
negative interactions which, at some level, threaten their secu-
rity. Under conditions of interpersonal confl ict, infants may try 
to intervene by crying, or by sidling up to one of the adults; or 
they may try to escape by crawling away. Chronic exposure to 
interpersonal confl ict creates a level of insecurity in the child 
who may feel that needs cannot be met when the adults in 
the family, especially attachment fi gures, are engaged in angry 
interactions with each other (Davies & Woitach, 2008).
Third, babies experience the power of their own rage. In 
some children, self-regulatory abilities are poorly developed, 
relationships, especially where issues of intimacy and protec-
tion are relevant. Trust is a broader, more abstract construct. 
It not only refers to the dyadic infant-caregiver relationship 
but includes the orientation of the infant to the wider social 
network of trustable and caring others. As such, it establishes 
the infant’s fi rst paradigm for social integration. Moreover, 
infants not only establish an assessment of the central social 
figures in their world as trustable or untrustable, but they 
also achieve a sense of their own value and trustworthiness. 
Over time, a basic sense of trust expands to a global optimism 
about how one expects to be treated by others and about 
one’s ability to cope with life’s challenges. Trust is an inte-
grating force that helps synthesize emotions, cognitions, and 
actions under conditions of uncertainty, allowing the person 
to pursue goals with a belief that things will work out well.
Given the key role of trust in forming and sustaining 
human social bonds, it makes sense to think that there is 
a biological basis for trusting in interpersonal interactions. 
Research has shown that in nonhuman mammals, a sub-
stance called oxytocin acts as a hormone associated with 
labor and lactation and also as a kind of neurotransmitter 
in brain regions associated with emotional and social behav-
iors (Carter, 1998). Oxytocin produces a general sense of 
calm relaxation. In nonhuman animals, oxytocin seems to 
reduce wariness or resistance to the physical proximity of 
other animals, thereby increasing approach behavior. Recent 
research is beginning to suggest a similar role for oxytocin in 
humans—an increased willingness to accept social risks in 
interpersonal situations—which is essential for cooperation.
In this research, participants made monetary exchanges 
in the roles of investor and trustee (Kosfi eld, Heinrichs, Zak, 
Gischbacher, & Fehr, 2005). The investor and trustee both 
received 12 monetary units at the start of the game. The 
investor had to decide how many units, if any, to transfer to 
the trustee. Once the transfer was made, the amount was tri-
pled by the experimenter, and the trustee had to decide how 
many units, if any, to give back to the investor. The investor 
benefi ts only by giving many units to the trustee if the trustee 
gives a substantial number back once the investment has 
been tripled. But the trustee can keep all the investment and 
return nothing. Before the interchange began, both investors 
and trustees received a dose of oxytocin or a placebo through 
a nasal spray. Investors who received the oxytocin showed 
more trust in the trustee and were willing to invest more 
money with them than investors who received the placebo. 
The amount returned by the trustees did not differ for the 
oxytocin and placebo groups. The researchers suggest that in 
these types of economic exchanges, oxytocin helps overcome 
wariness of betrayal and increases the reward value of social 
interactions. It did not increase reciprocal behavior on the 
part of the trustees, suggesting that the action of oxytocin 
has more to do with overcoming the initial uncertainty cre-
ated by wariness than to promoting prosocial behavior.
In real life, it is likely that when a person perceives a com-
bination of certain interpersonal cues such as facial expres-
sions, especially smiling and laughter, rhythmic gestures,

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
All infants experience some aspects of mistrust, either as a 
result of mismatches between their needs and the caregiving 
strategies they receive or as a product of their own diffi cul-
ties in modulating strong feelings of wariness or anger. Thus, 
the resolution of the crisis in the direction of trust refl ects a 
real psychological achievement, in which infants are able to 
minimize their wariness of the environment and to regulate 
their own inner passions.
Over the life span, the sense of trust is transformed and 
matures into a framework for the understanding of life. 
Among older adults who have a strong sense of trust, many 
of life’s disappointments and complexities are minimized by 
a growing religious faith. Their basic sense of trust evolves 
into a powerful belief in a great source of goodness and love 
in the universe, a force that can transcend the pain of daily 
tragedies and give integrity and meaning to their dying as 
well as to their living (Erikson et al., 1986).
The Central Process for 
Resolving the Crisis: Mutuality 
with the Caregiver
To resolve the crisis of trust versus mistrust, an infant must 
establish a feeling of mutuality with a caregiver. Mutuality is 
a characteristic of a relationship. Initially it is built on the con-
sistency with which the caregiver responds appropriately to the 
infant’s needs. The caregiver comes to appreciate the variety of 
an infant’s needs, and the infant learns to expect that personal 
needs will be met. Within families, the establishment of mutu-
ality differs with each child, depending on infant characteristics 
and parental responses (Deater-Deckard & O’Connor, 2000).
which leads to frequent outbursts of negativity and frustra-
tion. They can learn to doubt their own lovableness as they 
encounter the intensity of their own capacity for anger.
Feelings of doubt or anxiety about the bond of trust are 
more common than may have been expected. About one 
third of American infant-mother pairs who have been sys-
tematically observed show evidence of an insecure attach-
ment. Cross-cultural research provides further evidence that 
a signifi cant proportion of infants have diffi culty deriving 
emotional comfort or security from their caregivers (van 
IJzendoorn & Kroonenberg, 1988; Posada et al.,1995; van 
IJzendoorn & Sagi, 1999).
In addition to the mistrust that emerges in the context 
of inconsistent, unresponsive, or harsh caregiving, there 
are many cases in which the mother-infant relationship is 
disrupted. This can happen in conditions of war, parental 
imprisonment, parental death due to disease or accident, or 
lengthy hospitalization. In all of these situations, an infant is 
at risk for experiencing a strong sense of mistrust.
Mistrust may manifest itself in the infant by withdrawal 
from interaction and by symptoms of depression and grief, 
which include sobbing, lack of emotion, lethargy, and loss of 
appetite (Field et al., 1988). It may also be revealed later on 
in development in the expressions of interpersonal distress 
observed in the angry, anxious, and resistant behaviors of 
children with insecure attachments or in the inability to form 
close, satisfying relationships with others as adolescents and 
adults. Mistrust may provide a foundation for the emergence 
of a negative scheme about the self—a scheme that is elabo-
rated over time by defi ning the self with a cluster of closely 
related, negative attributes such as cautiousness, nervous-
ness, or introversion (Malle & Horowitz, 1995).

inability to sustain coordinated attention with the caregiver, 
partly in a rapid shift of need states, and partly in the inabil-
ity of adults to sustain long periods of nonverbal communi-
cation. In normal mother-infant pairs, however, periods of 
mismatch are usually followed by communication repairs, 
so that infants and mothers cycle again through points of 
coordination in their interactions.
The coordination that occurs in the mother-infant inter-
action becomes a prototype for the positive feelings of con-
nection that people enjoy in social relationships. Long before 
infants can use language to convey their feelings or needs, 
they can experience the satisfaction of social connection 
through these cycles of communication. They do not rely on 
spoken language, but on the many emotional cues that arise 
from rhythmic patterns of breathing, facial expressions, tone 
of voice, touch, and eye gaze. As mother and baby move 
into renewed moments of coordination, their sense of plea-
sure increases, leaving a memory of such moments to guide 
future conversations (Goleman, 2006).
At a biological level, what appears to occur through expe-
riences of coordination, mismatch, and repair is the establish-
ment of a neurochemical pattern: Networks of synapses are 
established; oxytocin is released; pleasurable feelings ensue; 
and the amygdala is impacted, resulting in reduced arousal 
and a greater sense of calm. Toward the end of infancy, as a 
product of experiences of receiving sustained, sensitive care-
giving, the infant’s complex neurological social capacity for 
trust is strengthened. Even though the brain is prewired to 
recognize and respond to certain types of social stimulation, 
the nature of actual caregiving experiences establish more or 
less likely patterns of social engagement. Infants who expe-
rience disrupted, harsh, or neglectful care do not develop 
the same underlying neurochemical structures for patterns 
of social behavior. As they grow older, these children may 
experience a wide range of problems in social behavior, emo-
tional development, and even cognitive development, espe-
cially in areas of language and communication competence.
At a theoretical level, the process of coordination, mis-
match, and repair can be viewed as a building block for 
mutuality. Infants and caregivers gain confidence in their 
ability to communicate. Infants have many opportunities to 
experience the satisfaction of shared communication and the 
sense of being embedded in a responsive social environment. 
They also experience frequent recovery from a mismatched 
state to a state of effective communication, so that they can be 
hopeful about the ability to make these repairs in the future.
Establishing a Functional Rhythm 
in the Family
The match or mismatch between an infant’s rhythms and the 
family’s rhythms is an important factor in the overall adjust-
ment of a family to a new baby. Some babies are quite pre-
dictable; the timing of their sleeping, eating, playtime, and 
even fussy periods follows a clear pattern. Other babies are 
An infant infl uences the responses of a caregiver in many 
ways. Infants’ irritability and soothability contribute to the 
kinds of responses that adults make. Infants can reject or end 
an interaction by fussing, becoming tense, crying, or falling 
asleep. They can maintain an interaction by smiling, cooing, 
snuggling comfortably, or maintaining eye contact. Tech-
niques of comforting do not call forth the same responses 
from all babies. A pacifi er helps comfort some babies, whereas 
others respond to being wrapped snugly in a warm blanket.
An infant and a caregiver learn to regulate the amount of 
time that passes between the expression of a need and its 
satisfaction. Bell and Ainsworth (1972) observed mothers’ 
responses to infant crying during the fi rst year of life. Over 
the course of the year, the infants’ crying decreased, and the 
mothers tended to respond more quickly to their cries. This 
fi nding suggests a process of mutual adaptation by mothers 
and infants. Some mothers came quickly and ignored few 
cries. Other mothers waited a long time and ignored much 
of the crying. The longer mothers delayed in responding to 
their infants’ cries, the more crying the infants did in later 
months. Babies whose mothers responded promptly in the 
fi rst 6 months of life cried less often in the second 6 months.
Coordination, Mismatch, and Repair 
of Interactions
The study of mutuality with the caregiver has focused in 
some detail on patterns and rhythms of social interaction, 
especially coordination between the infant and trusted adults 
(Tronick, 2003). Coordination refers to two related charac-
teristics of interaction: matching and synchrony. Matching 
means that the infant and the caregiver are involved in simi-
lar behaviors or states at the same time. They may be playing 
together with an object, cooing and smiling at each other, 
or fussing and angry at each other. Synchrony means that 
the infant and caregiver move fl uidly from one state to the 
next. When infants are paying attention to their caregivers, 
the caregivers attempt to stimulate them. As babies withdraw 
attention, the caregivers learn to reduce stimulation and 
wait until the infants are ready to engage again. Normally, 
mother-infant interactions become increasingly coordinated 
(Tronick & Cohn, 1989; Isabella & Belsky, 1991). This does 
not mean that most of the interactions are coordinated. In 
fact, especially when babies are very young, matched interac-
tions appear to become mismatched rather quickly.
A mother and infant may be engaged in a period of coo-
ing and laughing. The mother makes a funny noise, the baby 
reacts by cooing and laughing, then the mother makes the 
noise again and the baby laughs. On the third try, the mother 
cannot get the baby to make eye contact. She may try shift-
ing the baby to another position or making the noise at a dif-
ferent pitch, but the baby looks away and squirms. The game 
is over; the connection is temporarily broken.
Why is mother-infant communication so frequently 
disrupted? The explanation may lie partly in the infant’s 

182 | 
CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
had few expressions of interest, showed more sad and angry 
expressions, showed less ability to match a happy face with 
a happy vocal expression, and were less able to regulate their 
emotions. Interactions between the mothers and their infants 
appeared to be stressful and mutually unsatisfying (Field, 
2002).
The Prime Adaptive Ego 
Quality and the Core Pathology
Hope
Erikson (1982) theorized that the positive resolution of the 
psychosocial crisis of trust versus mistrust leads to the adap-
tive ego quality of hope. As you will recall from Chapter 3, the 
prime adaptive ego qualities shape a person’s outlook on life 
in the direction of greater openness to experience and infor-
mation, greater capacity to identify a variety of pathways to 
achieve one’s goals, more willingness to assert the self and to 
express one’s wishes and views, and a positive approach to the 
formation of close relationships. Even in the face of diffi culties 
and stressful life events, these qualities contribute to higher lev-
els of functioning and well-being (Peterson & Seligman, 2003).
As the fi rst of the prime adaptive ego qualities, hope per-
vades the entire life story. It is a global cognitive orientation 
that one’s goals and dreams can be attained and that events 
will turn out for the best. As Erikson described it, “Hope 
bestows on the anticipated future a sense of leeway inviting 
expectant leaps, either in preparatory imagination or in small 
initiating actions. And such daring must count on basic trust 
in the sense of a trustfulness that must be, literally and fi gu-
ratively, nourished by maternal care and—when endangered 
by all-too-desperate discomfort—must be restored by com-
petent consolation” (1982, p. 60).
Hopefulness combines the ability to think of one or more 
paths to achieve a goal with a belief in one’s ability to move 
along that pathway toward the goal (Snyder, Cheavens, & 
Sympson, 1997). The roots of hopefulness lie in the infant’s 
understanding of the self as a causal agent. Each time a baby 
takes an action to achieve an outcome, the sense of hope 
grows. When babies encounter obstacles or barriers to their 
goals, sensitive caregivers fi nd ways to remove the obstacles 
or lead them along a new path toward the goal. The infant’s 
sense of the self as a causal agent combined with the caregiv-
er’s sensitivity create the context for the emergence of hope.
Research with adults shows that people who have a 
hopeful, optimistic outlook about the future have different 
achievement beliefs and emotional reactions in response to 
actual achievement than do people who have a pessimistic 
outlook (Norem & Cantor, 1988; Dweck, 1992). People who 
have higher levels of hopefulness undertake a larger number 
of goals across life areas and select tasks that are more dif-
fi cult. Hopefulness is generally associated with higher goals, 
higher levels of confi dence that the goal will be reached, and 
much less regular. All babies are changing rapidly during the 
fi rst 24 months of life, so daily patterns are bound to change, 
and families must make frequent adjustments in order to 
continue to meet the infant’s needs.
In American culture, by the end of the fi rst year of life, 
babies are typically expected to modify their schedule of 
needs so that they sleep when the rest of the family sleeps, 
play when the rest of the family is awake, and eat three or 
at most four times a day, generally when the other family 
members eat. During the second year of life, the demands of 
parenting change. Babies become more mobile and have new 
capacities to initiate activities. Their attention span increases, 
they have new requirements for stimulation, and they have 
new areas of wariness and resistance—things they don’t want 
to do (like take a nap) or people they don’t want to be with 
(like a certain babysitter). These and other changes require 
adaptation on the part of parents in order to sustain the 
mutuality that had been achieved or to rectify problems in 
attachment and trust that may now be evident (Heinicke & 
Guthrie, 1992). The stable features in mutual relationships 
are the caregiver’s effort to be responsive to the child’s chang-
ing capacities and needs, and the child’s ongoing monitor-
ing of and responsiveness to the caregiver’s cues (Masur & 
Turner, 2001; Robinson & Acevedo, 2001).
Parents with Psychological Problems
The importance of reciprocal interactions in building trust 
and hope during infancy is highlighted by studies of par-
ents with psychological problems. Sensitivity to an infant’s 
emotional states, the ability to respond appropriately to an 
infant’s needs, and the quality of common, daily interac-
tions can all be impaired by family risk factors. Studies of 
parents who are experiencing marital discord, who have 
been victims of child abuse or neglect, who are depressed, 
or who are mentally ill suggest that the interactional cycles 
of these parents and their children lack synchrony (Rutter, 
1990). For example, in a comparison of mothers who had 
been maltreated as children and those who had not, the mal-
treated mothers were less involved with their children dur-
ing play, made use of fewer strategies to direct their children’s 
activities, and used a more negative tone with their children 
(Alessandri, 1992).
Other research has compared interactions between 
depressed and nondepressed mothers and their infants. The 
depressed mothers were found to be unresponsive, emo-
tionally unavailable, and unable to sustain smooth com-
munication with their babies. Depressed mothers were less 
likely to show animated, positive facial expressions. Typical 
efforts at fostering an infant’s emotional regulation, com-
monly observed in nondepressed mothers—such as intro-
ducing stimulating toys and games, touching and talking, 
and the efforts at reducing arousal through appropriate 
soothing and comforting—were not common in depressed 
mothers. For their part, the infants of depressed mothers 

 
The Prime Adaptive Ego Quality and the Core Pathology | 183
a period of physical and emotional withdrawal. They lay pas-
sively in their cribs, showing limited motor exploration and 
little emotionality. Furthermore, they rarely smiled or showed 
excitement. The babies’ babbling and language were extremely 
delayed. They deteriorated physically. Their measured devel-
opmental level dropped substantially over a year’s time. These 
babies suffered from a combination of a loss of their attach-
ment fi gure, a lack of meaningful social interaction, and an 
absence of appropriate sensory stimulation—all of which pro-
duced what Spitz called anaclitic depression.
Not all instances of withdrawal are as severe as the anaclitic 
depression syndrome. However, a growing literature focuses 
on the links between disrupted mother-infant interaction and 
subsequent social withdrawal (Gerhold et al., 2002). Tem-
peramental factors including behavioral inhibition and a low 
threshold for sensory stimulation, an anxious-avoidant attach-
ment, and a lack of contingent, responsive caregiving can 
combine to produce mistrust and the formation of the core 
greater persistence in the face of barriers to goal attainment, 
thus leading to higher overall levels of performance (Snyder, 
2002). Hopefulness is essential for behavior change in that 
it combines a desire to achieve new goals and a belief that 
one will be able to fi nd successful paths toward those goals. 
Feelings of hope help people deal with their most diffi cult 
challenges, including serious illness, injury, bereavement, 
and facing the end of life (Sullivan, 2003).
Within the psychosocial framework, hope provides the 
platform from which very young children take certain leaps 
of faith. When an infant overcomes doubts and hesitancy in 
taking a fi rst independent step, you see the dividend of hope. 
When a toddler clambers over the bars of her crib and lets 
herself drop several inches to the fl oor, you see the dividend 
of hope. As a parent, when you give your adolescent the keys 
to the car, you see the dividend of hope. Without hope, nei-
ther the individual nor the society could bear the weight of 
uncertainty in our changing world. With hope, individuals 
can envision a better society and come together in actions to 
reach the collective good (Braithwaite, 2004).
Withdrawal
As a core pathology, withdrawal refers to a general orienta-
tion of wariness toward people and objects. This is especially 
disturbing because, during infancy, healthy development 
is a pattern of outward motion, extension, and increasing 
engagement with the social and physical worlds. Infants typ-
ically reach and grasp, crawl, stand, and walk. They explore 
through gazing, mouthing, and manipulating objects. Their 
behavior is typically characterized by interest in novelty, joy 
in learning, and frustration at encountering barriers to goal 
achievement. Over the fi rst year, babies become increasingly 
connected to signifi cant fi gures in their social world, follow-
ing them about, devising strategies to engage them in inter-
action, and looking to them for consolation when they are 
distressed.
Infants who are characterized by withdrawal may show 
evidence of passivity, lethargy, and neutral or negative affect. 
They are not readily engaged in social interaction and do not 
show the signs of self-directed exploration that are typical of 
most healthy infants. Withdrawal may have some of its roots 
in genetically determined temperamental characteristics. 
Some babies have a very low threshold for pain. They are 
highly sensitive to sensory stimulation and recoil from the 
kinds of handling that other babies fi nd comforting or plea-
surable. Some babies are more passive than others, requiring 
little in the way of stimulation and showing less evidence of 
exploratory behavior than active babies.
One of the earliest descriptions of withdrawal in infancy 
was provided by Rene Spitz’s (1945, 1946) analysis of chil-
dren who had been institutionalized before 1 year of age. The 
babies who suffered the most had been placed in a found-
ling home in which eight babies were cared for by one nurse. 
These babies went through a phase of initial rage, followed by 
As a result of mutual responsiveness in playful interactions, 
babies experience joy and a sense of trust. The mother’s ability 
to love expands as she fi nds ways to respond to her infant and 
evoke these wonderful feelings of happiness.

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
few instinctive behaviors of human infants in comparison with 
the infants of other species are compensated for by their enor-
mous capacity to learn. For this potential to be realized, infants 
must rely on their parents to maintain their health, provide 
stimulation, and protect them from danger. During the period 
of dependence, infants become entwined in complex social sys-
tems and develop strong emotional bonds with their caregiv-
ers. The quality of these early relationships provides infants with 
mental representations that guide their later development of 
friendships, intimacy, and relationships with their own children.
Infancy, just like pregnancy and childbirth, is culturally con-
structed. The content of experience and the way the period of 
infancy is viewed depend on cultural traditions, beliefs, and 
technologies. Some of the ways that culture defines infancy 
include the infant’s sleeping arrangements, the choice of cloth-
ing, the choice of the infant’s name and the naming process, the 
selection of foods, and access to nursing from mothers and other 
lactating women (Valsiner, 2000). Parents transmit the culture 
through their care, and by enacting certain rituals and practices, 
they introduce and integrate their infant into the cultural com-
munity. The box, “Sensitive Care in Two Cultures,” provides a 
contrast between features of sensitive care for U.S. mothers and 
pathology of withdrawal. Social withdrawal can become such 
a severe social defi cit that it interferes with adaptive function-
ing and requires clinical treatment (Calkins & Fox, 2002).
APPLIED TOPIC
The Role of Parents
Objective 8. To evaluate the critical role of parents and 
caregivers during infancy, with special attention to issues 
of safety and nutrition; optimizing cognitive, social, 
and emotional development; and the role of parents 
and caregivers as advocates for their infants with other 
agencies and systems.
Parents have an enormous responsibility for their children’s 
physical and psychosocial growth. In this chapter, we have por-
trayed infants as active, adaptive, and eager to master the envi-
ronment. At the same time, the immaturity of human infants at 
birth necessitates a long period of dependence on adults. The 
SOCIALIZATION TOWARD 
CULTURALLY valued goals is a primary 
focus of parenting. This socialization 
process begins in infancy and is 
expressed through the beliefs parents 
have about what children should 
be able to do and what they should 
know or understand in the period of 
infancy. These beliefs are translated 
into caregiving strategies (Lamm & 
Keller, 2007). A primary assumption 
of attachment theory is that the 
quality of early care, and especially 
sensitive caregiving, promotes 
attachment security, an assumption 
that has been supported in a large 
number of studies (De Wolff & van 
IJzendoorn, 1997). However, the 
behavioral components of sensitive 
caregiving and how it might be 
expressed in various cultures has not 
been explored in great detail. A study 
by German Posada and colleagues 
(2002), which contrasted maternal 
care in two middle-class samples, one 
in Denver, Colorado, and the other in 
Bogota, Colombia, was designed to 
clarify this topic.
Although men’s and women’s 
roles are changing in Latin America, 
especially among the urban middle 
class, the Colombian culture is 
considered more collectivistic and 
interdependent than the U.S. culture, 
which is viewed as more individualistic 
and independent. Two questions 
guided the research: (1) Are the 
features outlined in the attachment 
literature that defi ne sensitive care 
descriptive of care in both cultures?; 
and (2) Are there features of care 
that might be unique to the specifi c 
cultures that are related to attachment 
security?
The researchers used an 
 ethnographic methodology to for-
mulate categories of maternal be-
haviors. Two researchers observed 
mother- infant pairs at home for two 
2-hour visits. Following the visits, the 
observers used a Q-sort technique 
to describe the mothers’ behaviors. 
This technique involved sorting 90 
cards that describe maternal behavior 
into three piles: characteristic, neither 
characteristic nor uncharacteristic, and 
 uncharacteristic. Each of the three 
piles is then further sorted into cat-
egories rated from 1 (most uncharac-
teristic) to 9 (most characteristic).
From this rating process, eight 
categories of care were identifi ed. 
Four of these categories were very 
similar to features of sensitive care 
outlined in the basic attachment 
research: (1) sensitive responding to 
infant signals and communication; 
(2) accessibility, which refl ects 
a mother’s ability to consider 
the baby’s needs despite other 
competing demands; (3) acceptance 
of the infant, which is refl ected in 
the mother’s positive emotional tone 
when interacting with the baby; and 
(4) interference, a mother’s intrusive 
or noncoordinated interactions 
with the baby. Two categories 
were observed that had not been 
captured in the literature as related 
to sensitive care: Active-animated 
interactions with the baby and 
creating an interesting environment 
for the baby. One category was 
observed in each cultural group that

was unique to that culture: For the 
U.S. mothers it was close-intimate 
interactions involving cuddling, and 
close affectionate touching; for the 
Colombian mothers it was concern 
with the baby’s physical appearance, 
including concern that the baby was 
getting messy during feeding and 
that the baby was messy or soiled 
during play.
Mothers from the United States 
and Colombia were very similar in 
their scores on sensitive responding, 
accessibility, and acceptance, and 
all these dimensions were predictive 
of infants’ secure attachments. 
Mothers from Colombia were less 
interfering and more animated 
in their interactions than the U.S. 
mothers. Mothers from the United 
States scored higher on creating 
an interesting environment for the 
baby. Of these three dimensions, 
interfering was negatively related 
to secure attachments for the U.S. 
sample, but not for the Colombian 
sample, and animated was positively 
related to secure attachment for the 
Colombian sample but not for the 
U.S. sample.
The results of this study highlight 
several points about the role of 
parents during infancy. First, certain 
features of parenting appear to 
have benefi cial consequences for 
infants in both cultures, and, when 
combined with results from many 
other studies, these features are 
becoming accepted as universally 
supportive of the attachment 
process—attuned response to the 
infant’s signals, accessibility in the 
face of competing demands, and 
acceptance or the positive emotional 
tone of mother-infant interactions. 
Second, some features of parenting 
are observed across cultures but 
not always related to attachment 
security in every culture. Third, 
some features of parenting may be 
culturally or contextually specifi c 
and, while important for early 
socialization, may not be specifi cally 
relevant for the formation of a 
secure attachment.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Based on this study, what are the 
basic features that are essential 
for sensitive caregiving across 
cultures? Do you have any experi-
ences with cultures where these 
features would not be seen as es-
sential for sensitive caregiving?
 2. How do the differences in caregiving 
between the U.S. and Colombian 
samples fi t with characterizations of 
these cultures as more individualistic 
or collectivistic? Are there results of 
the study that do not exactly fi t with 
these characterizations?
 3. Assuming that the research has cap-
tured features of caregiving that are 
generally distinct between the U.S. 
and Colombian cultures, what impli-
cations do these differences have for 
infant socialization and subsequent 
socialization in the two cultures?
 4. What is your evaluation of the 
Q-sort methodology for assessing 
features of the caregiving environ-
ment? What are the weaknesses and 
strengths of this approach? What 
other methods might be used?
inadvertently transmit harmful feelings of jealousy, revenge, 
or unbridled pride (Galt, 1991). The presence of dangers or 
risks in the environment usually elicits some effort to restrict 
a child’s movement through swaddling, carrying the baby in 
a sling, or placing the baby in a playpen. Because of con-
cern about dangers, caregivers also invoke certain prohibi-
tions, such as telling the child, “No, don’t touch that,” or 
pulling the child away from something dangerous. As infants 
become more mobile in the second half of their fi rst year, the 
need to introduce prohibitions and to monitor exploratory 
activities increases. Depending on the cultural values con-
cerning independent exploration, caregivers may heighten 
their restrictions and prohibitions or may try to modify the 
environment to permit safe, unrestricted exploration.
Certain childrearing practices arise from a desire to pro-
tect young children from known dangers. For example, 
Robert LeVine (1977) described the practice of many Afri-
can cultures of carrying infants 18 months and older on the 
back, even though they were able to walk around. This prac-
tice was used to prevent toddlers from getting burned on the 
open cooking fi res at an age when they were mobile enough 
to walk or stumble into the fi re and yet not old enough to 
Colombian mothers. Five aspects of the parental role are con-
sidered aspects of promoting optimal development in infancy: 
ensuring safety in the physical environment, fostering socio-
emotional and cognitive development, coordinating the roles 
of father and mother, parents as advocates with other societal 
systems, and parents as links to other sources of social support.
Safety and Nutrition
Safety
One of the central responsibilities that parents face is to 
ensure infants’ survival by protecting them from environ-
mental dangers. The ecology of home and neighborhood, 
including the society’s degree of modernization, infl uences 
the kinds of dangers to which infants are exposed and the 
kinds of practices that families and cultures invent to protect 
their offspring. In addition to physical risks, some dangers 
are linked to superstitions, religious beliefs, and matters of 
the spirit world. In many parts of the world, parents take spe-
cial precautions to prevent their infants from coming under 
the influence of an evil eye. The eye gaze may be viewed 
as a vehicle through which a person may deliberately or

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
If the baby is breastfeeding, mothers have to be careful about 
how their own diet and medications might affect their breast 
milk. If they are using formula, they have to be careful about 
the water quality that is used. In some areas of the world, 
poor water quality makes the use of powdered formula a 
serious health risk for infants.
In making the transition to solid foods, sometime around 
4 to 6 months, there are both safety and dietary concerns. 
Babies need to be strong enough to hold their heads up, and 
to sit with some support so they do not choke on solid foods. 
Typically, parents are instructed to introduce some type of 
iron-fortifi ed rice cereal mixed with breast milk or formula as 
the fi rst solid food. New foods are introduced one at a time, 
giving the baby a few days to become accustomed to the new 
taste, watching for signs that the baby is able to digest the 
new food, and also ensuring that the baby is not allergic to 
the food. Most resources on pediatric nutrition advise against 
giving infants honey, which can cause botulism.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends con-
tinuing with breast milk or formula for the fi rst 12 months. 
After 12 months, most babies can drink cow’s milk, and eat 
cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt, which are good sources 
of protein, calcium, and vitamins.
Safety concerns related to food include: avoiding foods 
that are likely to cause choking like nuts, raisins, or large 
pieces of meat; avoiding giving bottles with milk, juice, 
or sweetened beverages at bedtime which can cause tooth 
decay; and putting food from a jar into a small dish or bowl 
rather than feeding the baby from the jar in order to pre-
vent bacteria from the baby’s saliva from contaminating 
unused portions of the food (Kliegman, Behrman, Jenson, & 
Stanton, 2007).
know how to inhibit their movements. Other hazards in the 
neighborhood, such as falling off steep cliffs or into lakes, 
rivers, or wells, prompted this same carrying behavior.
In industrialized countries, infants face different types of 
hazards, such as electrical outlets, steep stairs, and open con-
tainers of insecticides, cleaning agents, and other poisons. 
Many American families protect babies from these dangers 
by putting gates at a doorway or at the top of a stairway, or 
by placing an infant in a crib or playpen to restrict explora-
tion. In other homes, the strategy is to baby proof the home 
by removing as many known dangers as possible so that 
the baby has maximum freedom for exploration. These two 
different strategies reflect two different values concerning 
childrearing—both with the same goal of providing maxi-
mum safety and protection from danger. In the former case, 
parents try to preserve their adult environment. Children 
must modify their behavior in order to fi t into the home. In 
the latter case, parents modify the environment to accommo-
date the baby’s developmental needs. For more information 
about child safety, you may want to visit the website of the 
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, www.cpsc.gov, 
which publishes reports on recalls as well as guidelines for 
child safety and toy safety.
Nutrition
In addition to protecting children from dangers and pre-
venting injuries, parents are responsible for providing an 
age-appropriate diet that supports the infant’s changing 
nutritional needs. In the fi rst 4 to 6 months of life, breast 
milk or formula is sufficient to provide the baby’s nutri-
tional needs. Newborns may nurse every 2 to 4 hours; by 
4 months of age, babies may nurse 4 to 6 times in 24 hours. 
Infancy is culturally 
constructed. Cora rises 
early each morning, ties 
her infant to her back, and 
walks to the market to sell 
fl owers. She expects her 
baby to be calm and quiet 
while she earns her living.

they increase the baby’s arousal and orient the baby toward 
objects in the environment. Through soothing and comfort-
ing, they help their infants regain a calm state after distress. 
As babies mature, parents increase their use of language to 
guide behavior and provide new problem-solving strategies. 
Infants are constantly watching their parents, observing the 
parents’ emotional reactions as well as their novel behaviors. 
As a negative example, infants of depressed mothers become 
passive and inhibited in their reactions to the environment 
as they observe their mothers’ passive or angry depressive 
symptoms.
Over the past 20 years, the growing interest in infant 
brain development has stimulated a burgeoning market 
to sell what is advertised as intellectually stimulating and 
developmentally appropriate toys for infants and toddlers. 
The idea that there might be a sensitive period for cogni-
tive development during the fi rst 3 years of life resulted in 
the production of special lines of toys, resources, and pro-
gramming purported to promote infant intelligence. U.S. 
parents of infants have made enormous expenditures for 
special toys, music, videos, and infant stimulation programs. 
Research on the continuing plasticity of brain development, 
the subsequent pruning of synapses, and the biochemistry 
of brain functions suggests that brain development is fl uid 
and continuous well into adulthood. Although early depriva-
tion, exposure to toxins, disease or malnutrition, and harsh 
or neglectful parenting can have long-term disruptive con-
sequences for cognitive development, a preoccupation with 
the need to provide very specifi cally designed resources to 
promote infant stimulation in the period from birth to 3 in 
order to ensure optimal cognitive growth is probably over-
done. In their desire to support optimal development, par-
ents need to be wary of fads and hypes that make it seem as if 
some specifi c form of stimulation is essential for their baby’s 
growth. In fact, parents and other sensitive caregivers are the 
most valuable sensory and emotional assets a baby can have. 
Rhythmic interactions, positive tone, comfort and soothing 
care under conditions of distress, and playful, relaxed inter-
actions that allow babies to initiate as well as to follow are 
among the most valuable forms of stimulation for promoting 
social, emotional, and cognitive growth in infancy.
Fathers’ and Mothers’ Parental 
Behaviors
Do fathers and mothers differ in how they enact the parent 
role with infants? As we noted earlier, babies form strong 
attachments to their fathers as well as to their mothers. Fathers 
may be just as involved in and sensitive to their babies’ needs 
as mothers. However, the daily interactions between mothers 
and their babies and those between fathers and their babies 
are distinct. In a study of more than 1,500 children in U.S. 
two-parent families, children spent an average of 1.4 hours 
on weekdays with their fathers, and 3.3 hours on weekends. 
Mothers were the primary caregivers of infants and young 
Many fi rst-time parents are unsure about how to provide 
adequate, safe nutrition for their babies. This is a source of 
some anxiety since it is an area in which the infant so obvi-
ously depends on caring adults for health, safety, and sur-
vival. Many excellent resources are available to inform parents 
about infant nutrition, including online resources such as the 
Mayo Clinic, and the MedLine Plus of the National Institutes 
of Health. The WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) pro-
gram provides federal grants to states to make supplemental 
foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education available 
for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and nonbreastfeed-
ing postpartum women, and to infants and children up to 
age 5 who are found to be at nutritional risk (USDA, 2010).
Fostering Socioemotional and 
Cognitive Development
Another component of the parents’ role during infancy is 
their ability to promote socioemotional and cognitive devel-
opment. Much of the behavior that appears to be impor-
tant in the development of strong emotional bonds between 
infants and parents is also central to fostering intellectual 
growth. Three features of parenting quality have been found 
to support optimal development, including children’s lan-
guage, literacy, cognition, autonomy, self-effi cacy, and school 
readiness. They are: parenting sensitivity, cognitive stimula-
tion, and warmth (Lugo-Gil & Tamis-LeMonda, 2008). Par-
enting sensitivity refers to the way parents respond to their 
infant’s distress, emotional expressions, interests, and abili-
ties, effectively balancing the infant’s needs for comfort and 
reassurance with the infant’s needs for autonomy and self-
control. Cognitive stimulation refers to parents’ efforts to 
teach their child, to enrich the child’s language and cognitive 
development, and to provide an interesting, age-appropriate 
environment. Warmth refers to the parents’ expressions of 
affection, admiration, and respect for their child.
Parents foster both emotional and intellectual growth 
by structuring the stimulus environment to suit the infant’s 
developmental level (Bornstein, 2002). Parents need to rec-
ognize the infant’s perspective in providing toys, sounds, and 
visual stimulation. Part of the parents’ function is to initiate 
interactions and not just respond to their infants’ demands 
for attention. Parents need to create what they perceive to be 
a suitable environment—one that allows a variety of expe-
riences, a reasonable amount of challenge, and adequate 
opportunities to experience success. Furthermore, parents 
should be attuned to their infant’s developing skills and alter 
the environment appropriately. As their children mature, 
parents must provide more complex stimuli, more opportu-
nities for autonomy, and more encouragement for tolerating 
frustration. By providing experiences that are attuned to the 
infant’s level of cognitive functioning, parents are also sup-
porting emotional satisfaction, confi dence, and joy.
Parents use a variety of methods to help their infants 
regulate their emotions. Through physical and verbal play,

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
may even feel unqualifi ed to make the kinds of judgments 
required. For example, parents must evaluate the compe-
tence and motivation of the adults who will care for their 
child. They must estimate how successful these caregivers 
will be in meeting their child’s needs for security and stimu-
lation. And they must consider the degree to which alterna-
tive caregivers refl ect their own parental values, beliefs, and 
strategies.
Even when pressures to continue a caregiving arrange-
ment are very strong, parents must be able to assess its 
impact on their children. They must try to judge whether 
their children are in the kind of responsive, stimulating 
environment that will enhance their development. In the 
best situations, alternative care settings actually comple-
ment a parent-infant relationship. In the worst settings, 
infants may be neglected and abused. It is essential for 
parents to maintain communication with the alternative 
caregivers, to assess the quality of the care, and to inter-
vene promptly when necessary to ensure their infant’s 
well-being.
Another situation in which parents serve as advocates 
for their infants occurs when the children have some form 
of chronic illness, developmental delay, or special physi-
cal needs. These children may require coordinated health 
care, therapeutic interventions, mental health services, and 
educational supports. Most states have early intervention 
programs to support parents and help them understand 
the nature, prognosis, and treatment of the infant’s condi-
tion. Early intervention case managers help build a bridge 
between parents and physicians or other health profes-
sionals. They also assist in the identifi cation of appropriate 
children during the week, but fathers took on a more equal 
role on the weekends (Yeung, Sandberg, Davis-Kean, & 
Hofferth, 2001). A greater proportion of the time that mothers 
spend with their babies is devoted to caregiving. Fathers, who 
spend less time overall with their babies, tend to focus more 
on play—especially physical play. They use their strength 
and physical activity as a resource as they interact with their 
babies. When mothers play with their babies, the play tends 
to be with words or with toys, as opposed to rough-and-
tumble activity (Lafl amme et al., 2002).
Cameron, a stay-at-home father of two daughters (an 
infant and a two-year-old), speaks about how he thinks 
fathers are different from mothers: “I fi nd I am very playful 
with the girls. I become the play structure you know. I will 
have them sitting on me. We’ll sing ‘the people on the bus’ 
and I’m the bus! I’m the slide. I don’t think I’ve ever really 
seen my wife do that. I will do it for hours at a time through-
out the day. They are climbing all over me all day long” 
(Doucet, 2009, pp. 86–87).
Mothers more frequently respond to their babies, express 
affection, and follow up on behavior their babies initiate. 
They are also likely to be more accepting of their child’s 
behavior and to emphasize and value emotional expressive-
ness. Fathers are more likely to disregard babies’ cues and 
to direct their attention to new targets. They are more likely 
to emphasize control and discipline (Rosen & Rothbaum, 
1993). At home, fathers are likely to continue their leisure 
activity, such as reading or watching television, in the pres-
ence of their babies, whereas mothers are likely to interact 
with their babies.
The quality of interaction between fathers and infants 
depends heavily on the context. When mothers are present, 
for example, fathers interact less with their babies. When 
fathers are alone with their babies, they are more engaged 
and sensitive play companions. When fathers are not overly 
stressed at work, have strong positive identification with 
their own fathers, and are in satisfying, harmonious mar-
riages, they achieve greater levels of intersubjectivity with 
their babies. Fathers of male infants tend to interact more 
with them than fathers of female infants (Goldberg et al., 
2002). Fathers become more effective parents the more 
they understand the complexity and sophistication of infant 
competencies.
Parents as Advocates
In addition to providing care themselves, more and more 
parents are responsible for arranging supplemental care for 
their infants. As a result, parents become advocates for their 
child. Parents must review the childcare services available to 
them and select a setting that will meet their infant’s needs 
and accommodate their work requirements and economic 
resources. Family day care, in-home babysitting, and center-
based care are three common alternatives.
To function as advocates for their children, parents may 
have to engage in an unfamiliar kind of thinking. They

The more involved a father is in his infant’s care, the more 
accurate he is in reading the baby’s signals.

The effective use of a social support network ensures that 
adults will not be isolated as parents, and that others will 
be available to help the parents identify and interpret 
childrearing problems. Often, the help is very direct—for 
example, child care or sharing of clothes, playthings, and 
furniture. Support may also take the form of companion-
ship and validation of the importance of the parental role. 
However, evidence suggests that social support cannot 
fully compensate for the lack of partner support or for the 
stresses on parenting caused by economic pressures that 
prevent parents from meeting basic life needs (Simons 
et al., 1993).
In reviewing this chapter, you can begin to appreciate the 
demanding nature of the parents’ role in promoting opti-
mal development during their baby’s infancy. The elements 
of effective parenting that we have identifi ed or implied are 
listed in Table 5.9. As a parent, one must rely heavily on one’s 
own psychological well-being and on the encouragement of 
one’s spouse, caring friends, and family to sustain the ego 
strengths and emotional resources necessary to the task.
The way parents conceive of their role has a major infl u-
ence on the direction and rate of their infants’ development. 
Parenting also allows adults opportunities for creative prob-
lem solving, empathy, physical closeness, and self-insight. 
Enacting the parent role makes considerable physical, cog-
nitive, and emotional demands, but attachment to a child 
also promotes the parent’s own psychosocial development. 
These contributions to adult development are described 
further in Chapters 11 (Early Adulthood) and 12 (Middle 
Adulthood).
TABLE 5.9 OPTIMIZING AN INFANT’S DEVELOPMENT
Spend time with the child; be available when the child needs you.
Provide warmth and affection; express positive feelings toward the baby in many ways—verbally, through touching 
and hugging, and through playful interactions.
Communicate often, directly with the child; engage the child in verbal interaction. Provide stimulation.
Encourage the child’s active engagement in and exploration of the environment. Help the child understand that he 
or she causes things to happen.
Help the child engage in directed problem solving. Encourage the child to persist in efforts to reach a goal.
Keep things predictable, especially when the infant is very young.
Guide language development by using words to name, sort, and categorize objects and events. Accept the child’s 
efforts to achieve closeness.
Be sensitive to the child’s state; learn to interpret the child’s signals accurately; time your responses appropriately.
Find effective ways to soothe and comfort the child in times of distress.
Help the child interpret sources of distress and fi nd ways to regulate distress. Minimize the child’s exposure to 
intensely negative, hostile, and frightening events.
Be aware of the visual and auditory cues you send when you interact with the child. Pay attention to how the child is 
changing over time.
Monitor the child’s emotional expressions to evaluate the success of specifi c actions and interventions.
 
The Role of Parents  | 189
community resources. However, the parents are ultimately 
responsible for making sure that the services match the 
child’s changing needs.
The Importance of Social Support
The infant’s physical, cognitive, social, and emotional develop-
ment are fostered through the loving care of mothers, fathers, 
other family members, and community caregivers who are 
able to create supportive relationships with one another and 
with the infant. Infant mental health and optimal development 
are intimately entwined with the mental health of caregivers 
(Weatherston, 2001). A variety of contextual factors play a part 
in parents’ ability to promote their child’s optimal development. 
Adults who had diffi cult experiences with their own caregivers 
may come to the parental role with special challenges. They 
may not have experienced the comfort, responsiveness, or 
appropriate stimulation that are essential for effective parent-
ing. Some factors, however, help to make up for these defi cits. 
The quality of one’s intimate relationship with a loving partner 
is important in sustaining positive parent-child relationships. 
Couples who experience mutuality and trust in their own rela-
tionship are better able to create a predictable, supportive, and 
caring family environment for their children (Crockenberg, 
Leerkes, & Lekka, 2007).
Sources of social support beyond the intimate partner 
may also enhance one’s effectiveness as a parent. This sup-
port may come from the child’s grandparents and other 
family members, friends, and health care and mental 
health professionals (Bornstein & Tamis-LeMonda, 2001).

CHAPTER 5 Infancy (First 24 Months)
elaborated in the context of engagement in a stimulating 
and responsive environment. As regions of the brain become 
more organized, they infl uence each other, leading to new 
cognitive capacities and abilities for goal-oriented behavior 
and self-regulation. The infant brain, including capacities for 
social connection, sensory processing, motor behavior, and 
emotional regulation and expression, is emerging in an ongo-
ing, fl uid process of exchange of information with its social 
and physical environments. What begins as an explosion 
of possible meanings and connections gradually becomes 
sculpted into certain patterns and preferred responses, but 
with a continuous potential for new interconnections into 
childhood and beyond.
During the first months of life, the sensory/perceptual 
system—vision, hearing, taste, smell, touch, motion sensitiv-
ity, and responsiveness to internal cues (proprioception)—is 
developing rapidly and functions at a more advanced level 
than the motor system. Young infants can distinguish changes 
in the loudness, pitch, duration, and location of sounds. They 
can use auditory information to differentiate objects from one 
another and to track the location of objects. Infants respond 
to a variety of visual dimensions, including movement, color, 
brightness, complexity, light-dark contrast, contours, depth, 
and distance. By 6 or 7 months of age, infants treat faceness 
as a special visual category. Newborns can differentiate sweet, 
sour, bitter, and salty tastes. Touch is an active as well as a 
passive sense; babies use it to explore objects, people, and 
their own bodies. Over the fi rst year, infants’ voluntary motor 
functions mature rapidly. Many motor functions are present 
in a refl exive form and emerge more fully as a result of con-
tinuing muscle development, motor coordination, and prac-
tice. Stepping is one example of this dynamic emergence.
Objective 3. To describe the development of 
sensorimotor intelligence, including an analysis of how 
infants process information, organize experiences, 
conceptualize causality, and understand the properties 
and functions of objects.
Sensorimotor intelligence begins with the use of motor and 
sensory capacities to explore and understand the environ-
ment. Four basic information-processing abilities provide 
the cognitive resources that support the maturation of sen-
sorimotor intelligence: attention, processing speed, mem-
ory, and representational abilities. Of the many schemes 
that are established during this period, the emergence of an 
increasingly complex sense of causal relationships, the estab-
lishment of the concept of object permanence, and the for-
mation of categories of objects are achievements that impose 
order and predictability on experience.
Chapter Summary
Although the genetic plan plays a major role in guiding 
physical and sensory/perceptual maturation during infancy, 
there is considerable evidence for plasticity in neurological 
development as an infant’s sensorimotor system interacts 
with the social and physical environment. During infancy, 
a child rapidly develops sensory and motor skills, social 
relationships, and emotional and conceptual skills. Babies 
are born with the capacity to perceive their environment 
and to evoke responses from their caregivers. They are 
ready to respond to a wide array of caregiving conditions. 
Caregivers convey cultural beliefs and values through their 
childrearing practices, thereby shaping the infant’s experi-
ences along particular cultural pathways. The result is a 
blend of many universal features of infancy, such as the 
reflexes, sequences of motor development, attachment 
process, sensorimotor reasoning, and experiences infants 
have in their culture of care. Some of these experiences 
are a result of socialization goals, such as sleeping arrange-
ments or types of food that are given to the infant. Some 
of the experiences are a result of the language, commu-
nication patterns, and social interactions that accompany 
care. Others of these experiences are a result of individual 
differences in the caregivers’ sensitivity and ability to meet 
infants’ needs.
Objective 1. To describe characteristics of newborns 
and the challenges facing low-birth-weight babies.
Babies differ in their physical maturity and appearance at 
birth. Differences in physical maturity have distinct conse-
quences for the capacity to regulate survival functions such 
as breathing, digesting, waking, and sleeping. The Apgar 
scoring method is used to evaluate the newborn’s need for 
immediate intervention. Infants who weigh less than 2,500 
grams (about 5 pounds, 8 ounces) are called low-birth-
weight babies. Babies who are small for their gestational age 
(SGA) are at greater risk for health problems than those who 
are born prematurely but are of average weight for their ges-
tational age. Babies born before 30 weeks do not have the 
benefi t of positive features of the uterine environment that 
support the maturation of various aspects of self-regulatory 
functions.
Objective 2. To identify important milestones in the 
maturation of the sensory and motor systems, and to 
describe the interactions among these systems during 
the fi rst 2 years of life.
It makes sense to think of infants as newly developing sys-
tems that require continuous support for ongoing growth 
and refi nement. The synapses in their brains become more

critical underpinning for subsequent cognitive functioning 
and social competence.
Objective 7. To describe the psychosocial crisis of trust 
versus mistrust; the central process through which the 
crisis is resolved, mutuality with the caregiver; the prime 
adaptive ego quality of hope; and the core pathology of 
withdrawal.
The establishment of trust between the infant and the care-
giver is signifi cant in both intellectual and social develop-
ment. Through repeated interactions with caregivers, the 
infant develops a concept of the adult as both separate and 
permanent. Parental sensitivity is an underlying factor in 
determining the quality of attachment. Factors that appear to 
infl uence sensitivity are the adult’s past experiences, includ-
ing how the parent was cared for as a young child; con-
temporary factors that infl uence the caregiver’s well-being, 
self-esteem, and emotional availability, such as the quality of 
the parental dyad and experiences at work; and characteris-
tics of the infant. Once established, the trusting relationship 
between the infant and the caregiver becomes a source of 
security for the infant’s further explorations of the environ-
ment and a framework for future close relationships. Trust 
serves as a basis for an orientation toward hopefulness.
Objective 8. To evaluate the critical role of parents and 
caregivers during infancy, with special attention to issues 
of safety and nutrition; optimizing cognitive, social, 
and emotional development; and the role of parents 
and caregivers as advocates for their infants with other 
agencies and systems.
Infants are skilled at adapting to their environment, but 
they cannot bring about major changes in it. Parents and 
other caregivers are ultimately responsible for structuring 
the environment so that it is maximally suited to the infant. 
Infants count on their caregivers to create a safe environ-
ment, to provide safe and adequate nutrition, to protect 
them from distress, to promote their health and physical 
growth, and to rally appropriate social support and com-
munity resources as needed. Parents must act as advocates 
for their infants and for themselves in the parental role.
Objective 4. To characterize forerunners of language 
competence from birth through the fi rst 2 years of life.
Evidence of both language perception and language pro-
duction can be traced to infancy. Auditory and visual cues 
contribute to an awareness of the structure and rhythm of 
spoken language. Infants are able to recognize sounds and 
differentiate between sound combinations. They commu-
nicate through babbling and gestures before using spoken 
words. Around the age of 8 months, infants understand 
the meanings of some individual words and phrases. By 
16 months, an infant has a receptive vocabulary of between 
90 and 300 words; and a productive vocabulary of about 
26 words.
Objective 5. To understand social attachment as the 
process through which infants develop strong emotional 
bonds with others, and to describe the dynamics of 
attachment formation during infancy.
A social attachment forms between the infant and the pri-
mary caregiver, creating the basic mental representation 
for subsequent intimate relationships. The attachment 
has physical as well as social and emotional characteris-
tics. Sensory and motor experiences with the caregiver’s 
voice, touch, aroma, facial expressions, soothing, and 
playfulness are all part of what become integrated into 
the mental representation of the object of attachment. 
Depending upon the sensitivity of the caregiver, attach-
ments can be secure, anxious-resistant, anxious-avoidant, 
or disorganized.
Objective 6. To examine the nature of emotional 
development, including emotional differentiation, the 
interpretation of emotions, and emotional regulation.
Emotions are an early and continuous means of achiev-
ing intersubjectivity between infants and their caregiv-
ers. Emotions become increasingly differentiated in 
intensity and meaning. Emotional regulation provides a

Further Reflection
 1. What are some examples of how hearing and vision work 
together to help infants form schemes about their world?
 2. What is the possible evolutionary basis of the attachment 
behavioral system? How might contemporary life events 
threaten to disrupt this system?
 3. What are some ways that caregiving practices can nur-
ture the infant’s ability to develop causal schemes?
 4. How might differences in temperament modify the kind 
of caregiving a baby receives?
 5. What does it mean to say that meaning is co-constructed 
in infancy? How do infants and caregivers use emotional 
communication to create meaning?
 6. How might life conditions such as poverty, the dual ca-
reer family, single parenting, or having a very-low-birth-
weight baby infl uence the role of parents as advocates 
during infancy?
 7. What role might the sense of trust and the ego strength of 
hope have for the enactment of life roles such as friend, 
teacher, supervisor, or political or spiritual leader?
 8. What are some examples of how infants infl uence and

Chapter Objectives
TODDLERS SEEM TO bubble with unpredictable, star-
tling thoughts and actions that keep adults in a state of 
puzzled amazement. Toddlers are extremely busy—talking, 
moving, fantasizing, and planning all the time. Their out-
pouring of physical activity is remarkable for its vigor, con-
stancy, and complexity. Equally impressive is the fl ood of 
cognitive accomplishments, especially language production 
and unique forms of playful fantasy.
Building on a foundation of trust and optimism formed 
during infancy, toddlerhood brings a fl owering of the 
sense of personal autonomy, an enjoyment and confi -
dence in doing things for oneself and expressing one’s 
will. The successful blending of these two basic capaci-
ties for trust and autonomy provides a strong, protec-
tive shield for the young child’s ego system. From this 
foundation, children are able to venture into satisfying 
and meaningful social relationships, engage in playful 
problem solving, and face their future with an outlook of 
hopefulness and assertiveness.
The chances for such a positive conclusion to the pe-
riod of toddlerhood rest largely on the quality of the home 
environment. Toddlers, with their high energy level, im-
probable ideas, impish willfulness, and needs for mastery, 
run headlong into the full range of limits in their physical 
and social environment. Parenting during toddlerhood is 
like paddling a canoe through the rapids. It requires vigi-
lance, good communication between the bow and the 
stern, fl exibility, and a certain joie de vivre that keeps the 
whole trip fun. A child’s cognitive and social development 
during this period of life can be facilitated by the parents’ 
own ego development, their style of parenting, and the 
quality of their relationship. The degree to which dis-
cord and confl ict introduce stress into the lives of parents 
brings special risk for some toddlers. ■
CASE STUDY
ALICE WALKER GOES TO THE FAIR
It is unusual to fi nd fi rst-person recollections of the period of 
toddlerhood. In this selection, Alice Walker, Pulitzer Prize–
winning novelist and poet, shares an early memory.
It is a bright summer day in 1947. My father, a fat, funny man 
with beautiful eyes and a subversive wit, is trying to decide 
which of his eight children he will take with him to the county 
fair. My mother, of course, will not go. She is knocked out 
from getting most of us ready: I hold my neck stiff against the 
pressure of her knuckles as she hastily completes the braid-
ing and then the beribboning of my hair. My father is the 
driver for the rich old White lady up the road. Her name is 
Miss Mey. She owns all the land for miles around, as well as 
the house in which we live. All I remember about her is that 
she once offered to pay my mother thirty-fi ve cents for clean-
ing her house, raking up piles of her magnolia leaves, and

washing her family’s clothes, and that my mother—she of no 
money, eight children, and a chronic earache—refused it. But 
I do not think of this in 1947. I am two and a half years old. 
I want to go everywhere my daddy goes. I am excited at the 
prospect of riding in a car. Someone has told me fairs are 
fun. That there is room in the car for only three of us doesn’t 
faze me at all. Whirling happily in my starchy frock, show-
ing off my biscuit-polished patent leather shoes and laven-
der socks, tossing my head in a way that makes my ribbons 
bounce, I stand, hands on hips, before my father. “Take me, 
Daddy,” I say with assurance; “I’m the prettiest!”
Later, it does not surprise me to fi nd myself in Miss Mey’s 
shiny black car, sharing the back seat with the other lucky 
ones. Does not surprise me that I thoroughly enjoy the fair. 
At home that night I tell the unlucky ones all I can remember 
about the merry-go-round, the man who eats live chickens, 
and the teddy bears, until they say: “That’s enough baby 
Alice. Shut up now, and go to sleep.”

CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. What is the spirit of toddlerhood that is captured in this case?
 2. How does the case relate to the tasks of locomotion, lan-
guage, fantasy play, and self-control?
 3. What aspects of Alice’s self-concept appear to be forming 
in this episode?
 4. What images of her mother and father are being estab-
lished at this age?
Developmental Tasks
The use of the word toddler to describe development for 
2- and 3-year-olds is in itself a clue to the important part that 
locomotion plays. In fact, it is only during the fi rst year of 
this stage that the child actually toddles. By age 3, the child’s 
walk has changed from the precarious, determined, half-
humorous toddle to a more graceful, continuous, effective 
stride. Removal of diapers probably plays an important role 
in the progress of a child’s walk. When toddlers no longer 
have a large wad of padding between their legs, they quickly 
make the transition from ugly duckling to swan.
The developmental tasks of toddlerhood—expanded loco-
motion, language and communication skills, fantasy play, 
and self-control—all contribute to the child’s emerging inde-
pendence within the boundaries of the social group. Some 
theorists refer to this as the fi rst individuation process (Mahler, 
Pine, & Bergman, 1975; Blos, 1979). Obviously, 3-year-olds 
are not ready to set out for life alone in the big city. But they 
are ready to express independent thoughts, exercise some con-
trol in making choices, and do some things independently. 
The psychosocial crisis during this period of life—autonomy 
versus shame and doubt—refers to the child’s struggle to 
establish a sense of separateness without disrupting the bonds 
of affection and protection that are critical to a young child’s 
physical survival and emotional connection to the family. In 
many cultures, expectations for autonomy are brought about 
by the birth of the next child, requiring the toddler to achieve 
new levels of self-suffi ciency. Typically, this takes place with the 
support of older siblings, neighboring children, and extended 
family members who model and encourage more mature 
behavior (Edwards & Liu, 2002).
Elaboration of Locomotion
Objective 1. To describe the expansion of motor skills 
during toddlerhood, indicating their importance for 
the child’s capacity to explore the environment and to 
experience opportunities for mastery.
Locomotion plays a central role in the toddler’s psychoso-
cial development, facilitating the transformation of ideas 
into action and prompting new types of interactions with 
the social and physical environment. As locomotor skills 
develop, the child has new ways of remaining close to the 
object of attachment, new avenues for investigating the envi-
ronment, and new strategies for coping with stressful situa-
tions. Growth in locomotion and cognition go hand in hand. 
An understanding of space, distance, and the relationship of 
one place to the next expand as children maneuver through 
their environment (Gibson & Pick, 2000). One study found 
that when people think about the future, their leg muscles 
react as if they are moving ahead; and when they think about 
the past, their leg muscles react as if they are moving back-
ward (Miles, Nind, & Macrae, 2010). We can extrapolate 
that in toddlerhood, sensorimotor exploration may serve as 
the physical basis for subsequent thinking about the future 
(moving ahead through space), and thinking about the past 
(moving backward through space).
Locomotor skills also fi gure prominently in the elabora-
tion of play during this period. To the extent that coping 
involves the ability to maintain freedom of movement under 
conditions of threat, the locomotor skills acquired during 
toddlerhood provide a fundamental arsenal of lifelong strate-
gies for fi ght or fl ight. Advanced locomotor skills may also 
increase confl icts with caregivers, introducing new struggles 
of willfulness and new parental constraints (Biringen, Emde, 
Campos, & Appelbaum, 1995).
When Ellen was about 2½ years old, she enjoyed watching 
her older brother climbing up a tree in the neighbor’s yard. 
She would beg her brother to lift her up so she could get 
into the tree with him. One afternoon, Ellen’s brother lifted 
her into the tree and then ran off to play with a friend. Ellen 
tried to get down from the tree, but she got her foot stuck 
in a crack between the branches. She cried and yelled until 
her mom came to get her. Ellen’s mom scolded her for being 
in the tree and warned her never to go up there again. But 
the next afternoon, Ellen was back trying to fi gure out how 
to climb into the tree on her own.

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
Berger, 2006). These factors are integrated through repeated 
action; as one factor changes, the others must change. As a 
result, although most toddlers eventually achieve the same 
kinds of gross motor skills, the exact path toward profi ciency 
differs for different children and across cultural groups.
Some landmarks of motor development that are reached 
from ages 2 to 6—walking and running, jumping, hopping, 
throwing and catching, pedaling and steering—are described 
in Table 6.1. The development and perfection of these skills 
depend on opportunity and encouragement as well as on the 
maturation of the cognitive and motor systems (Piek, 2006).
As walking becomes a more comfortable form of locomo-
tion, new skills are added to the child’s repertoire. Running 
and jumping are the fi rst to emerge. By the age of 4, children 
are likely to leap from stairways, porches, or ladders. They 
have begun to imagine what it might be like to fl y. Jumping is 
their closest approximation to fl ying. The actions involved in 
jumping form a pattern that remains stable throughout child-
hood and into adulthood (Clark, Phillips, & Petersen, 1989).
Children’s running abilities become more elaborated all 
through toddlerhood. In fi lms used to study the emergence of 
running, it appears that for toddlers, running and walking are 
very much alike, with little increase in velocity and little or no 
fl ight (the time when both feet are off the ground) in running. 
From this example, one can see that when locomotor 
skills occur early in a developmental period, before the mat-
uration of verbal and cognitive competence, toddlers may 
fi nd themselves at odds with caregivers who must limit loco-
motion to protect the child’s safety and to secure the safety of 
other people and objects in the environment.
Difficulties encountered by engineers and inventors in 
trying to duplicate human locomotor skills with robots have 
demonstrated just how intricate and exquisite are the tod-
dler’s accomplishments (Meghdari & Aryanpour, 2003). The 
possibility that lifelong movement patterns are acquired dur-
ing these 2 years extends our appreciation of toddlers’ loco-
motor accomplishments. Qualitative changes in locomotive 
behavior are not simply a result of maturation of the cerebral 
cortex. Dynamic systems theory, as discussed in Chapter 2, 
has guided a more fully differentiated view of motor devel-
opment. Five factors interact to support the emergence of 
motor skills: (1) physical characteristics of the limbs, joints, 
and muscles involved in the movement; (2) changes in body 
weight and muscle mass; (3) new capacities in the central 
nervous system that improve coordination of feedback from 
the limbs and guide the amount of effort needed to achieve 
a motor goal; (4) the nature of behavioral goals; and (5) 
opportunities for practice (Thelen & Smith, 1994; Adolph &

play. Locomotor play provides immediate benefi ts to children 
in terms of physical fi tness, including increased bone density, 
cardiovascular fi tness, and fl exibility (Pellegrini, 2009). Cer-
tain forms of physical activity provide an important source 
of information about the physical self. They offer an avenue 
for mastery and are also the basis for a lot of fun. Toddlers 
enjoy their bodies and are generally joyful when in the midst 
of physical play. Thus, physical activity contributes in an 
essential way to the toddler’s self-concept. Children who lack 
muscle strength or coordination experience strong feelings 
of frustration as they struggle to keep their balance, throw or 
catch a ball, or use their hands and feet to perform new tasks.
Although one might expect that children who attend pre-
school would have a variety of opportunities for vigorous 
physical activity, recent research does not support this view. 
The National Association for the Education of Young Chil-
dren (NAEYC) recommends at least 60 minutes of outdoor 
activity daily for preschoolers. The National Association for 
Sport and Physical Education advises 120 minutes of physical 
activity for young children. In fact, studies of daily opportu-
nities for physical activity suggest that children in preschool 
spend most of their time indoors in what is described as sed-
entary activity, such as sitting, standing, or lying down. Even 
when they are outdoors, only 17% of the children’s activities 
were described as moderate to vigorous such as walking, run-
ning, crawling, jumping, or skipping. The amount of moder-
ate to vigorous activity varies by the quality of the preschool 
environment, with higher quality settings offering more 
materials and equipment to encourage active play, and more 
instances of teacher-initiated physical activity throughout the 
day (Brown, Pfeiffer, McIver, Dowda, Addy, & Pate, 2009).
Language Development
Objective 2. To document accomplishments in 
language development and to describe the infl uence 
of experiences for learning to communicate.
Semiotic Thinking
Jean Piaget (1970) described the years from about 2 to 5 or 
6 as the stage of preoperational thought. This is a transi-
tional period during which the sensorimotor schemes that 
were developed during infancy are represented internally. 
The most signifi cant achievement of this new stage of cogni-
tive development is the capacity for semiotic or representa-
tional thinking—understanding that one thing can stand for 
another. In semiotic thinking, children learn to recognize 
and use symbols and signs. Symbols are usually related in 
some way to the objects for which they stand. The cross, for 
example, is a symbol of Christianity. In pretend play, a scarf 
or a blanket may be a symbol for a pillow or a dress. Signs 
stand for things in a more abstract, arbitrary way. Words are 
signs; there is no direct relation between the word dog and 
the animal to which the word refers, yet the word stands for 
Toddlerhood brings tremendous advances in locomotion as 
children enjoy walking, running, jumping, and hopping. Leaping 
from steps, walls, chairs, and benches is almost like fl ying!

At the beginning, toddlers appear to be running because they 
are moving a bit faster, but their action is not similar to adult 
running. Over time, however, the movements smooth out as 
fl ight time and velocity increase (Whitall & Getchell, 1995). 
These examples of jumping and running suggest how impor-
tant early locomotor activity is in establishing motor skills 
that become elements of more complex athletic abilities in 
later childhood, adolescence, and adult life.
At fi rst, youngsters may run for the sake of running. They 
practice over and over again. Later in toddlerhood, running 
changes from a kind of game in itself to a valuable compo-
nent of many other games. The absolute speed of toddlers 
is limited by their somewhat precarious balance and short 
legs. This does not discourage them, however, from devoting 
a great deal of time and energy to running. The goals of mas-
tery and getting to new places for exploration are too strong 
to dampen their enthusiasm.
Toddlers are often exposed to a wide variety of other forms 
of locomotion, such as swimming, skiing, skating, sledding, 
and dancing. Children seem eager to use their bodies in a 
variety of ways, and they learn quickly (Gallahue & Ozmun, 
2006). As their physical coordination improves, children 
engage in a new repertoire of large-muscle activities: climbing, 
sliding, swinging, pounding, digging, and rough-and-tumble

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
How the Brain 
Processes Language
BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND language 
capacity are intimately related. From 
birth to age 3, the brain increases 
in weight from 400 to 1,100 grams, 
and trillions of neural connections are 
formed. Furthermore, myelination 
increases, continuing beyond infancy 
and toddlerhood well into adolescence. 
Myelination contributes to the speed 
of neural fi ring. Thus, over the period 
of infancy and toddlerhood, the brain is 
working extremely hard, forming synapses 
and responding with increasing speed.
With the use of positron emission 
tomography (PET) and functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 
one can observe different areas 
of activity in the brain related to 
varying language activities, including 
speaking, seeing words, and hearing 
words. PET is a technique that begins 
with the injection or inhalation of a 
radioactive material. As this material is 
metabolized in the brain, gamma rays 
are emitted and recorded. Using PET 
technology, one can discern which area 
of the brain is active during a particular 
type of activity, such as hearing or 
reading language. In fMRI, brain 
areas with more blood fl ow and more 
oxygenated blood show up better on 
the MRI. The fMRI takes advantage of 
this by comparing the brain at rest to 
the brain performing a series of tasks. 
The areas of the brain that become 
more visible following the task are 
assumed to have been activated by the 
task (Gregg, 2004).
In infancy, both hemispheres are 
involved in language perception. 
Research confi rms that by the end of the 
third year, for the vast majority of right-
handed children, the essential aspects 
of speaking and understanding spoken 
language typically become focused in 
the left hemisphere of the brain. For 
left-handed children and those who are 
ambidextrous, these aspects of language 
are focused in the right hemisphere 
(Brownlee, 1998). The nondominant 
hemisphere becomes important for 
understanding features of language such 
as interpreting the emotional tone of the 
speaker, humor, and metaphor. However, 
various neuroimaging studies have 
demonstrated that many regions of the 
brain are involved in language production 
and comprehension (Gernsbacher & 
Kaschak, 2003; see Figure 6.1). Studies 
that monitor brain activity fi nd that 
nouns and verbs, the kinds of words that 
are especially important for conveying 
meaning, are associated with different 
patterns of activity than prepositions 
and conjunctions, the kinds of words 
that are more important for grammatical 
information. Delays in exposure to a 
language, for example among deaf 
individuals who begin with American 
Sign Language and learn English later 
in life, result in little disruption in the 
organization of the brain related to 
word meaning, but signifi cant disruption 
in the areas of the brain that process 
grammatical information (Neville & Mills, 
1997; Neville et al., 1998).
Damage to these areas leads to 
a loss of the ability to speak, called 
aphasia. Damage to Broca’s area results 
in an inability to produce speech, but 
language comprehension remains 
functional. Damage to Wernicke’s area 
does not affect the ability to produce 
language, but understanding is lost. 
People with Wernicke’s aphasia can 
produce words clearly, but they do not 
make sense. People who have damage 
to the arcuate fasciculus can understand 
language, but their speech does not 
make sense, and they cannot repeat 
words.
In addition to the areas identifi ed as 
especially key for language, speaking 
involves the motor cortex; reading involves 
the visual cortex; and understanding 
spoken language involves the auditory 
cortex. The task of reading aloud involves 
the visual cortex, motor cortex, and 
Broca’s area.
Speech is different from other 
cognitive functions related to 
communication, such as language 
comprehension or symbolizing an idea 
by drawing a picture. In a condition 
called aprosodia, people have diffi culty 
talking about their emotions when 
there is damage to the area of the right

the object. For adults, it seems natural to use matchsticks or 
little squares of cardboard to represent people or buildings, 
but for children, the idea that a stick may be a car or a horse 
is a dramatic change in thinking that emerges gradually dur-
ing the preoperational period.
Semiotic thinking brings enormous fl exibility to human 
cognition. Signs embody an idea of something separate from 
the thing itself. With the elaboration of various types of sym-
bols and signs, children can begin to recount events apart 
from the situation in which they occurred. They can invent 
worlds that never existed.
Children acquire fi ve representational skills that allow 
them to manipulate objects mentally rather than by 
actual behavior: (1) imitation in the absence of the model, 
(2) mental images, (3) symbolic drawing, (4) symbolic play, 
and (5) language. Representational skills allow children to 
share their experiences with others and to create imagined 
experiences. These skills also free children from commu-
nicating only through gestures and opens up opportuni-
ties to communicate about the past or the future as well 
as the present. Children can express relationships they may 
have known in the past by imitating them, drawing them, 
talking about them, or acting them out in fantasy. They 
can also portray events and relationships that they wish 
would occur or that they wish to alter (Nelson, 2010). In 
this and the following sections, we focus on two of these 
representational skills, language and fantasy play, which are 
among the most notable achievements of toddlerhood and 
are foundational for psychosocial development across the 
life span.

hemisphere that mirrors the area of the 
left hemisphere that is used for language. 
Studies comparing deaf users of sign 
language to hearing participants who use 
spoken language have provided evidence 
that injury to the left hemisphere can 
result in a form of language aphasia. For 
the deaf, this injury does not interrupt the 
capacity to make other types of gestures, 
confi rming that language functions are 
differentiated from other symbolic and 
motor functions that might be involved in 
the communicative process (Corina, Vaid, 
& Bellugi, 1992).
Language production capacities of 
the brain demonstrate both sensitive 
periods and remarkable plasticity. 
Sensitivity is evidenced by the impact 
of delayed exposure to language on 
disruptions in grammar as well as on the 
ability to recognize and produce certain 
language sounds. Plasticity is evidenced 
in research comparing children who had 
congenital left hemisphere damage with 
adults who had left hemisphere injuries. 
The children scored much higher than 
the adults on measures of spontaneous 
speech, suggesting that other areas of 
the brain had taken over many of these 
functions (Bates et al., 2001).
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Based on what you have read about 
how the brain processes language, 
what are the distinct components of 
language competence? Which areas 
of the brain are associated with these 
components?
 2. How can you explain the notion 
that the brain shows both sensitive 
periods and plasticity regarding lan-
guage competence?
 3. What are some differences between 
vocabulary and grammar that might 
require different brain functions? 
What are the unique cognitive 
capacities that are needed for these 
two aspects of language?
 4. What are some differences be-
tween receptive and productive 
language? Why does receptive 
language precede productive lan-
guage? Where might you look in 
brain development to explain this 
difference?
 5. How does the synthesis of vocabu-
lary and grammar take place in ev-
eryday speech of normal toddlers?

FIGURE 6.1 Three Areas of the Brain That Are Intimately Related to Speech: 
Broca’s Area, Wernicke’s Area, and the Arcuate Fasciculus, a Bundle of Nerve 
Fibers That Connects the Two. Damage to these areas leads to a loss of the 
ability to speak, called aphasia. Damage to Broca’s area results in an inability 
to produce speech, but language comprehension remains functional. Damage 
to Wernicke’s area does not affect the ability to produce language, but 
understanding is lost. People with Wernicke’s aphasia can produce words clearly, 
but they do not make sense. People who have damage to the arcuate fasciculus 
can understand language, but their speech does not make sense, and they 
cannot repeat words.
Communicative Competence
In the process of language development, children acquire 
communicative competence: They become adept at using 
all the aspects of language that permit effective participa-
tion in the language environment of their culture (Kuczaj 
& Hill, 2003; Tomasello, 2006). This includes producing the 
sounds of the language; understanding the system of mean-
ings, the rules of word formation, and the rules of sentence 
formation; developing a rich vocabulary; making adjust-
ments to the social setting that are necessary to produce and 
interpret communication (pragmatics); and acquiring the 
ability to express thoughts in written as well as oral form. 
Through the achievement of communicative competence, 
children become increasingly integrated into their culture. 
They learn the expressions, tones of voice, and gestures that 
link them intimately to the language environment of their 
home and community. They learn when to speak and when 
to remain silent, and how to approach communication with 
peers, parents, and authority fi gures. They learn the terms 
applied to kin, close friends, acquaintances, and strangers; 
the words that are used to disparage or devalue; and the 
words that are used to recognize and praise. Although much 
of communication is intended to create shared meaning 
between the sender and the receiver of messages, sometimes 
communicative competence is used to deceive, mislead, or 
intimidate (Fiedler, 2008). If nurturing is the primary vehicle 
for cultural socialization in infancy, communication is the 
primary vehicle in toddlerhood. A discussion of how the tod-
dler’s brain processes language is presented in the “Applying 
Theory and Research to Life” box.

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
of age, those in the 90th percentile were using 180 words, 
and those in the 10th percentile produced 10 words or less 
(Fenson et al., 1994). All these children were healthy, nor-
mal children, with no known history of developmental delay, 
prematurity, or genetic disease. As you read about modal or 
typical patterns, try to remember that these patterns disguise 
important variations.
Communicative Competence in Toddlerhood
Language development in toddlerhood brings rapid acqui-
sition of a wide-ranging vocabulary and the initial use of 
a primitive grammar that is quickly transformed into the 
grammar of the spoken language. The typical developmen-
tal progression in language competence is characterized by 
three common patterns: (1) an acceleration in the produc-
tion of single words, followed by two-word combinations; 
(2) a predominance of nouns in the vocabulary followed by 
the addition of verbs, adjectives, and prepositions; and (3) 
two-word utterances followed by longer strings of words 
organized by use of grammatical rules that include more 
indicators of meaning, such as possession, plural, and past, 
present, and future.
Although there appears to be a universal capacity for 
language, which matures rapidly in the fi rst 4 years of life, 
and although each of the approximately 6,000 languages 
spoken in the world today are capable of doing roughly the 
same things (conveying ideas), each language has its own 
vocabulary and grammar, which have to be learned specifi -
cally. Whereas there may be a universal capacity to recognize 
certain facial expressions as happy or sad, or even certain 
gestures as meaning “give me” or “pick me up,” there is no 
universal human code that links objects, ideas, or actions to 
spoken words and sentences. Each human child has to learn 
a particular spoken language. This uniqueness of language 
contributes to its fl exibility, leading to the creative use of lan-
guage and its capacity to express novel thoughts and ideas 
(Wargo, 2008).
Vocabulary. During the period from 12 to 16 months, 
infants make significant progress in learning the names 
of objects and applying them to pictures or real examples. 
There is a rapid expansion of vocabulary during these 4 
months from few or no spoken words to about 26. Sometime 
around 18 months, the child acquires a large number of new 
words, and vocabulary continues to expand at a rapid rate 
throughout the toddler and early school years (Booth, 2009). 
The average toddler of 30 months has a spoken vocabu-
lary of about 570 words. In order to accomplish this feat, 
children seem to fast-map new meanings as they experience 
words in conversation. To fast-map is to quickly form an ini-
tial, partial understanding of a word’s meaning. It is an infor-
mation-processing technique in which children relate the 
new word to the known vocabulary by linking it to known 
words and concepts that are already well understood. The 
child has to hear the new word only a few times in a con-
text that makes its meaning clear. In day-to-day life, children 
Communicative competence begins during infancy and 
develops across the entire life span. Vocabulary, grammar, 
and pragmatics continue to be refined as one engages in 
formal schooling and enters a wider range of social settings 
where specific words, expressions, and styles of interac-
tion are in use. But toddlerhood appears to be the time of 
a dramatic expansion in verbal competence, when remark-
able achievements are made in an exceptionally brief period. 
The following discussion of language and communication is 
divided into two major sections: (1) language milestones and 
(2) the language environment. The fi rst section outlines the 
pattern of communication accomplishments of toddlerhood, 
including the expanded use of words with meaning, the for-
mation of two-word sentences, more complex sentence for-
mation, and grammar. Important physiological structures 
support this emerging competence. The second section iden-
tifi es factors in the psychosocial environment that help facili-
tate and optimize communicative competence.
The text provides an overview of patterns of accomplish-
ment in language and communication from infancy through 
about age 4. As you may remember, many of the precursors 
of spoken language, including language perception, bab-
bling, and gesturing, were discussed in Chapter 5. Certain 
sequences or developmental milestones appear to be quite 
common among children from many language environ-
ments. Communicative gestures precede the production of 
spoken words, and the production of a substantial vocabu-
lary of spoken words precedes the linking of words into 
two-word sentences. However, it is important to recognize 
the wide variability in the development of communicative 
skills. The timing of the onset of these various abilities and 
their rate of growth vary from child to child. For example, 
in a large national study of infant/toddler language, word 
production for 12-month-old infants ranged from the 90th 
percentile, who used 26 words or more, to the 10th percen-
tile, who produced no words (see Figure 6.2). By 16 months

Martin Braine (1976) analyzed the first word combi-
nations spoken by children in English, Samoan, Finnish, 
Hebrew, and Swedish. His goal was to identify the kinds of 
rules or patterns that governed these early combinations. Ten 
patterns of word combination were embedded in those early 
language samples:
 1. Making reference to something: See +X (see mother)
 2. Describing something: Hot +X (hot stove)
 3. Possession: X has a Y (Billy has a bottle)
 4. Plurality: Two +X (two dogs)
 5. Repetition or other examples: More +X (more up)
 6. Disappearance: All gone +X (all gone milk)
 7. Negation: No +X (no sleep)
 8. Actor-action relations: Person +X (Daddy sleep)
 9. Location: X + here (Grandma here)
 10. Requests: Have +X (have it, ball)
Braine found that although he could identify some com-
mon patterns of word combinations, they were not guided 
by the grammatical categories of the spoken language but by 
the meanings the child wished to express and by the variety 
of objects, people, and interactions in the immediate envi-
ronment. The patterns of word combinations used by some 
children did not overlap at all with those used by other chil-
dren in the same culture.
Early language is closely tied to the representation of sen-
sorimotor schemes—the activities that dominate the child’s 
life, such as eating, sleeping, playing games with mommy or 
daddy or the siblings, going places, coming back home, and 
so on. It expresses the properties and relationships of the 
objects and people that are important in a child’s life. Lan-
guage use emerges within a larger communication system 
and refl ects a child’s cognitive capacities. At the same time, 
it refl ects the perceptual and functional characteristics of the 
environment. Vocabulary and grammar grow hand in hand; 
as toddlers learn more words, they use them in combination 
to express more complex ideas (Bates & Goodman, 2001).
Grammatical Transformations. By combining words 
according to the set of rules of grammar for a given language, 
a person can produce a limitless number of messages that can 
be understood by another person. Remarkably, by the age of 
4, children appear to be able to structure their sentences using 
most of these rules without any direct instruction. Consider 
the difference in meaning between “The boy hit the ball” and 
“The ball hit the boy.” The simple matter of word order in a 
sentence is critical for preserving meaning. The basic format of 
an English sentence—noun phrase followed by verb phrase—
is a central part of its grammar. In order to ask a question or 
produce a negative sentence, the speaker transforms this word 
order according to a specifi c set of rules (e.g., “You are going” 
versus “Are you going?”). The addition of certain infl ections 
and modifi ers conveys information about time, possession, 
number, and relation. As children learn the grammatical trans-
formations of their language, they become much more effec-
tive in conveying exactly what they have in mind.
hear thousands of words, many over and over again, without 
necessarily knowing their meaning. However, once children 
recognize the link between a word’s sound and its meaning, 
they can quickly associate other familiar word sounds with 
their meanings (Swingley, 2007). Thus, without direct word-
by-word tutoring, children accumulate numerous samples of 
their culture’s language from the speech they hear and attach 
a minimally satisfactory defi nition to each word or phrase. 
This vocabulary burst is associated with speed of process-
ing in word recognition. Young children who recognize 
words with greater speed also seem to have a greater vocabu-
lary. The relationship between these two factors is not fully 
understood (Fernald, Swingley, & Pinto, 2001).
The early phase of vocabulary development seems to 
focus on broad semantic categories—animals, vehicles, fruits, 
clothes, and so on. New words, particularly nouns, are treated 
like the name of a category of things rather than of only one 
specifi c object or a part of it. For example, when a child learns 
the word cup, it is used to refer to all objects that have the gen-
eral shape and function of a cup. A much slower process of 
vocabulary development occurs as children and adults learn 
the distinctions among words within categories (McDonough, 
2002). You may have a very good idea about the distinction 
between annual and perennial fl owering plants, but you may 
not know the difference between the many types of each 
group and how to recognize them. In fact, building a vocabu-
lary of subcategories may become an entire fi eld of study, such 
as botany or zoology, in which the types and subtypes of a 
larger category are identifi ed, classifi ed, and named.
Two-Word Sentences. At 16 months of age, few children 
make two-word sentences, but by 30 months almost all chil-
dren make them (Fenson et al., 1994). These two-word sen-
tences are referred to as telegraphic speech. Children merge 
two words into phrases that are essential to communicate what 
they intend to say. Just as in a telegram, however, other words—
verbs, articles, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions—are left 
out. A child will say, “my ball,” “more juice,” and “Daddy gone.” 
Before this point, children tend to utter single words accompa-
nied by gestures and actions. By stringing two words together, 
they convey more meaning through verbal communication 
and rely less heavily on gestures and actions. The acquisition 
of telegraphic speech allows a child to make greater use of the 
symbolism inherent in language to communicate meaning 
(Powers, 2002).
Children are quite innovative in using two-word sen-
tences. They continue to understand more than they are able 
to say, but they appear to use their limited number of words 
and the newfound ability to combine them to get their point 
across. Children may convey different meanings with the 
same sentence. “Daddy go,” for example, may be used to tell 
someone that Daddy has left, or it may be used to tell Daddy 
to leave. Children often indicate their meanings by tone of 
voice or by the words they stress. The use of two-word sen-
tences is characteristic of toddler-age language learners in 
many cultures (Messer, 2000).

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
TABLE 6.2 Milestones in Language Development from 24 Months to 4 Years
AT THE COMPLETION OF
VOCALIZATION AND LANGUAGE CHARACTERISTICS
24 months
Vocabulary of more than 300 items (some children seem to be able to name everything in the environment); 
begin spontaneously to join vocabulary items into two-word phrases; all phrases appear to be own creations; 
defi nite increase in communicative behavior and interest in language.
30 months
Continuing increase in vocabulary with more than 550 words; many new additions every day; no babbling 
at all; utterances have communicative intent; frustrated if not understood by others; utterances consist of at 
least two words, many have three or even fi ve words; use of linguistic suffi xes for possession, plural, and past 
tense; frequent use of irregular plural noun (foot/feet) and irregular verbs; intelligibility is not very good yet 
by those unfamiliar with the child’s speech.
3 years
Vocabulary of some 1,000 words; about 80% of utterances are intelligible even to strangers; grammatical 
complexity of utterances is roughly that of colloquial adult language, although mistakes still occur.
4 years
Language is well established; deviations from the adult norm tend to be more in style than in grammar.
Source: Adapted from Lenneberg, 1967, and Fenson et al., 1994.
A surprising observation is that children use correct trans-
formations for the past tense of irregular verbs (went, gave, 
run) before they use correct infl ections of regular verbs (talked, 
walked, jumped). It appears that children first learn the past 
tense of irregular verbs through rote memory. Once they learn 
the rule for expressing the past tense by adding ed, they occa-
sionally overregularize this rule and begin making errors in the 
past tense. Thus, a 2-year-old is likely to say “I ran fast,” but a 
3-year-old may say “I runned fast.” According to a model pro-
posed by Gary Marcus, children recognize and have a symbolic 
category for words that are verbs. They establish a default rule: 
“To form the past tense, add ed to any word that can be catego-
rized as a verb.” They also memorize the past forms of the irreg-
ular verbs as they encounter them. When an irregular verb is 
required, its irregular past tense form is always used if the child 
can recall it. However, if the child cannot recall the past tense, 
or if the word is novel, the default rule is called into play. In a 
study of preschoolers, the rate of overregularization was 4.5%. 
This fell to 2.5% for fi rst graders and 1% for fourth graders, 
suggesting that as a child’s vocabulary grows, the need to apply 
the default rule to unfamiliar verbs declines (Marcus, 1996).
The grammatical errors that young children make alert 
us to the fact that they are working to fi gure out a system 
of rules with which to communicate meaning. It is unlikely 
that these errors result from imitation of adult speech. Chil-
dren say such things as “My do it” or “Dose mines.” They 
have certainly not copied those expressions from adults; 
rather, these errors suggest the beginning of a grammar that 
becomes more specialized and accurate as children acquire 
the opportunity to match their speech to that of others. One 
can catch toddlers in the act of building their grammar by 
listening to them revise their own speech. From the age of 2 
to 4, as their grammar matures, toddlers will pause in mid-
sentence and revise their speech to make a more complex 
or complete expression. Aware of linguistic alternatives, they 
stop to select one that best expresses their thoughts in a spe-
cifi c language environment (Rispoli, 2003).
The milestones in language development from 24 months 
to age 4 are summarized in Table 6.2. In the second year of 
life, babies understand words and phrases. They develop a 
vocabulary and begin to form two-word phrases. During the 
third year, language is defi nitely used to communicate ideas, 
observations, and needs. Comprehension of spoken language 
seems almost complete. Some of their speech may not be eas-
ily understood by people outside the family, partly because 
they are unable to produce clear phonetic sounds and also 
because their knowledge of adult grammar is limited. During 
the fourth year, most children acquire an extensive vocabulary. 
They can create sentences that refl ect most of the basic rules 
of grammar. Their language is a vehicle for communicating 
complex thoughts that are usually understood by children and 
adults outside the family. They can use their communicative 
skills to participate in social exchanges with other children, 
talk about their experiences, make plans, and resolve confl icts.
The pattern of language milestones is very similar across 
languages, and appears to be similar for toddlers who are 
learning a second language. In an investigation of interna-
tional adoptees, researchers compared English language 
acquisition for children who had been adopted from China 
and U.S.-born monolingual infants (Snedeker, Geren, & 
Shafto, 2007). The Chinese children were between the ages 
of 2½ and 5½ when they were adopted. They were com-
pared to U.S. infants between the ages of 1½ and 2¾. Lan-
guage competence was assessed every 3 months until the 
Chinese children had been in the United States 18 months. 
These adopted children were learning English in much the 
same way that babies of English-speaking parents learn the 
language—from exposure to English in the family environ-
ment. They had the advantage of more advanced cognitive 
maturation and experience learning a fi rst language, and the 
disadvantage of delayed exposure to English during infancy.
Three features of language learning were observed 
among the Chinese adoptees: (1) They showed the same 
pattern of language production as monolingual infants, 
using one-word utterances at first, which were mostly 
nouns with other kinds of words added over time. (2) Dur-
ing their fi rst 3 months in the United States, the adopted 
children acquired English vocabulary at a rate four times 

 
Developmental Tasks | 205
As the process of fast-mapping implies, children may add 
a word to their vocabulary without understanding the several 
meanings that this word has in different contexts. During the 
periods of early and middle childhood, considerable time 
and attention is devoted to exploring vocabulary, correcting 
some meanings that were incorrectly learned, and expanding 
the full range of meanings and underlying concepts that are 
linked to the many words that were acquired so rapidly dur-
ing toddlerhood. One estimate is that the reading vocabulary 
or comprehension of dictionary entries of a 10-year-old child 
is close to 40,000 words, with another 40,000 proper names, 
places, and expressions unique to the child’s own family, 
neighborhood, and cultural group (Anglin, 1993).
Important language functions develop more fully during 
early and middle childhood (Dickinson & Tabors, 2001). As 
their understanding of the self and the social environment 
expands, older children use language to plan a problem-
solving strategy, guide a complex series of motor activities, or 
identify the relationships among objects. Vocabulary expands, 
and words are used more frequently in the ways they are used 
in adult speech. Children learn the patterns of polite speech 
as well as slang. Depending on the nature of their conversa-
tional partners at home and school, their sentences become 
more complex, including conditional and descriptive clauses. 
The irregular verbs and nouns are learned and used correctly. 
As children attend school, they learn to conceptualize the 
grammatical structure of their language.
Beyond the formal elements of vocabulary, grammar, 
reading, and writing, language becomes a vehicle for creative 
expression. Children write poems, essays, and stories. They 
begin to use sarcasm, puns, and metaphors to elaborate their 
speech. They create secret codes with their special friends. 
Children make up riddles and jokes, put on plays and pup-
pet shows, work on school newspapers, and leave enigmatic 
faster than comparable monolingual infants. This suggests 
that prior experience coupled with advanced understand-
ing of the object-word link contributed to an accelerated 
process of vocabulary learning. (3) Both adopted children 
and monolingual infants showed the same positive correla-
tion between vocabulary size and sentence complexity. Nei-
ther infants nor adoptees whose vocabulary was less than 
300 words produced multiword expressions. Thus, despite 
their advanced cognitive maturation and prior exposure to 
another language, adoptees seemed to go through the same 
sequence of problem-solving steps to build grammatically 
complex sentences that are characteristic of monolingual 
infant language learners.
Language Development beyond Toddlerhood
Although the fundamentals of language are well established 
by age 4, there are still some things that toddlers cannot 
achieve with language. For example, Mary may raise a fuss 
about wanting the biggest piece of cake. If you allow her 
to make a choice, she selects a piece with lots of frosting. 
Clearly, the word biggest is not being used correctly. Even 
though Mary is able to memorize and repeat the words big, 
bigger, and biggest, she does not yet fully understand the 
concept to which they refer. Other observations suggest 
that 2- and 3-year-olds have diffi culty using verbal instruc-
tions to control or guide their behavior (Tinsley & Waters, 
1982). They may be able to tell themselves to “stop” or 
“go slow,” but these commands are not effective in slowing 
them down. Both of these examples demonstrate that tod-
dlers’ language development can be somewhat misleading. 
One may assume that children fully understand the more 
abstract meaning of the words they use, but in fact their 
language continues to be very idiosyncratic throughout 
toddlerhood.
Toddlers can use their language 
to enhance play and foster 
cooperation.

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
THE RISE IN THE NUMBER OF ASIAN 
AND LATINO IMMIGRANTS TO THE 
United States has led to a growing 
interest in the process through which 
young children manage the challenges 
of learning and speaking two or 
more languages. Studies of children 
in U.S. schools fi nd that there are 
some children who speak primarily a 
language other than English, some 
children who speak only English, and 
some children who are fl uent in two or 
more languages including English. A 
growing body of research documents 
that the children who speak mostly 
a language other than English have 
more emotional, academic, and 
behavioral problems than those who 
are bilingual (Han & Huang, 2010).
Young bilingual children are 
adept at switching from one language 
to another as the conversational 
situation demands. In one study of 
bilingual Latino children in Miami, 
Florida, the children had access to 
two vocabularies, one in Spanish and 
one in English. Rather than knowing 
two words for the same thing, these 
vocabularies did not overlap much. 
Knowing the two languages actually 
expanded the concepts children 
could use to express their thoughts 
in comparison to children who spoke 
English or Spanish only (Umbel, 
Pearson, Fernandez, & Oller, 1992).
Code switching begins at a very 
early age. Infants growing up in 
multilingual families begin to acquire 
fi rst words in both languages and 
are soon able to use these words 
appropriately, for example, speaking 
Spanish to their Spanish-speaking 
caregiver and English to their English-
speaking grandmother (Holowaka, 
Brosseau-Lapré, & Pettito, 2002). 
In a study of a bilingual English-
Portuguese infant at play with his 
mother and father, the child switched 
languages to fi ll in the gaps in his 
vocabulary. If he did not know the 
word for something in one language, 
he used the other. Similarly, his 
parents switched codes in order 
to provide language that was the 
best match with the child’s level of 
understanding. Thus, bilingual families 
can use their language environment 
to the child’s advantage, providing 
alternative communication strategies 
to improve communication and 
understanding (Nicoladis, 1998; 
Nicoladis & Secco, 2000).
How do bilingual individuals prevent 
one language from interfering with 
another? Research using functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
explored the process by which 
bilingual individuals inhibit one 
language while drawing on another. 
In this research, individuals who were 
bilingual from infancy were compared 
to those who were monolingual. 
Participants were asked to press a 
button when they saw a word in one 
language, but not to press the button 
when they saw words in another 
language or made up words that were 
not really words in either language. In 
this type of task, bilinguals can detect 
when a word is not in the language 
they have been instructed to attend to, 
but they do not process the word for 
its meaning. None of the brain areas 
that are associated with word meaning 
were activated when the nontarget 
words were displayed. Instead, 
bilinguals had adapted a distinct path 
from sound properties of the words 
to meaning only for the words in the 
target language (Rodriguez-Fornells, 
Rotte, Heinze, Nosselt, & Munte, 
2002). The implication is that early 
bilingualism stimulates additional 
plasticity in brain organization 
and function to accomplish tasks 
that require language separation. 
Regardless of which language is being 
spoken, the same regions of the cortex 
are used to produce and understand 
spoken language. However, when 
words from different languages are 
spoken or presented visually, an 
additional brain area is activated 
which is sensitive to monitoring and 
controlling the language that is in use 
HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND DIVERSITY
Bilingualism
or corny messages in their friends’ yearbooks. With the 
widespread use of text messaging and Twitter, new forms of 
expression have been invented that abbreviate or condense 
meaning. If you participate in these modes of communica-
tion, you quickly learn the meanings of these new symbols 
and signs.
Language plays a critical role in the resolution of sub-
sequent psychosocial crises, especially the establishment 
of group identity, intimacy, and generativity. It is primar-
ily through the quality of one’s spoken language that one 
achieves the levels of disclosure that sustain friendship and 
subsequent intimate relationships. Language also serves as a 
mechanism for resolving confl icts and for building a sense of 
cohesiveness within groups, whether of friends, coworkers, 
or family members.
The Language Environment
In this section, we focus primarily on the nature of the interac-
tion between toddlers and their caregivers, with some atten-
tion to the issue of bilingualism and the relationship of the 
language environment at home and school. Language is a cul-
tural tool, a means for socializing and educating young chil-
dren. It is one of many inventions for creating a sense of group 
identity and for passing the mythology, wisdom, and values of 
the culture from one generation to the next. Language is a part 
of the psychosocial environment. Competence in the use of 
language solidifi es the young child’s membership in the imme-
diate family and in the larger cultural group. Although there 
is strong evidence for genetically based origins of the capac-
ity for language learning, the specifi c content and tone of a 
child’s communication is strongly infl uenced by the language

(Crinion et al., 2006). You can think of 
this process as a low-level recognition 
switch that does not contribute to 
the interpretation of speech nor to 
the production of meaningful speech, 
but simply signals higher level brain 
centers that a different type of speech-
related stimulus has been experienced.
There appear to be some costs 
as well as benefi ts associated with 
bilingualism. Bilingual children have 
a smaller vocabulary overall, and in 
controlled experiments they are a bit 
slower in tasks that require thinking of 
words that name a picture. Benefi ts of 
bilingualism are evident in many tasks 
that are associated with executive 
control, including focusing attention, 
resisting distractions, monitoring 
changes in stimuli, and changing 
strategies between tasks. Bilingualism 
is increasingly being viewed as a 
context that stimulates early and 
ongoing advantages in cognitive 
fl exibility, selectivity, and control 
(Kovács & Mehler, 2009; Bialystok & 
Craik, 2010).
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. How would you evaluate the fol-
lowing statement? “The human 
brain has the capacity for a great 
deal more language competence 
than is typically observed.”
 2. Based on the information pre-
sented here, what would you ad-
vise parents who speak more than 
one language? How should they 
organize the language environ-
ment for their children?
 3. What are some potential advan-
tages and disadvantages to 
bilingualism?
 4. How does the study of bilingualism 
help inform our understanding of 
language development?
 5. How would you set up a computer 
program to function as a bilingual 
translator? What features would be 
needed to support the integration 
of two or more languages?
 6. How would you develop methods 
and a curriculum to accomplish the 
goal of fostering English fl uency 
for children who are not native 
English speakers while preserving 
and extending their fl uency in their 
native language?
The teacher, who speaks Spanish and English fl uently, helps students become 
bilingual by encouraging them to use both languages to express their ideas.

environment. In many industrialized cultures, children are 
separated from the world of adult work. Special educational 
settings are created to prepare children for the tasks of adult-
hood, and adults interact with children in specifi c ways that 
differ from their interactions with other adults. In other cul-
tures, children are present in the midst of ongoing adult activi-
ties. Children are encouraged to become active listeners and 
observers, gradually participating in conversations and work 
as their abilities permit. Thus, the nature of the interactive lan-
guage environment, the expectations for children to partici-
pate, and the kinds of communications that children are likely 
to engage in can vary based on the broad cultural orientation 
about the place and role of children in the larger society 
(Rogoff & Angelillo, 2002; Rogoff, Paradise, Arauz, Correa-
Chavez, & Angelillo, 2003).
Interaction and Language Development. Probably 
the most important factor that caregivers contribute to a 
child’s cognitive growth is the opportunity for interactions. 
Brain development in infancy and toddlerhood is stimu-
lated by exposure to adult language through conversation, 
baby talk, and reading aloud. An interactive human being 
can respond to a child’s questions, provide information, react 
in unexpected ways and surprise the child, explain plans 
or strategies, and offer praise or criticism. The frequency 
and quality of parent-child interactions are closely associ-
ated with children’s social and cognitive competence (Hart, 
Newell, & Olsen, 2003). The “Human Development and 
Diversity” box discusses bilingualism, the complex learning 
process that takes place in children who are brought up in 
families that speak two languages.

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
their direct experience, and observe shifts in language tone 
and style that accompany changes in the topic or purpose 
of the conversation. This example illustrates the variation in 
communication styles that characterize American families, 
producing substantial differences in the language-learning 
environments of the home.
Other research describes variations in the nature and 
amount of parent-child interaction that takes place dur-
ing a typical day. In one longitudinal study, 40 families (15 
Black and 25 White) were observed once per month over 
2½ years (Hart & Risley, 1992). The observations covered 
the period shortly before, during, and after the child was 
learning to talk. The number of words spoken to a child in 
an hour varied from 232 to 3,606; the percentage of time 
that parents were in the same room as the child ranged from 
38% to 99%; and the average number of times that parents 
and children took turns in an interaction ranged from 1.8 
to 17.4.
This observational study found that the quality of a par-
ent’s speech toward the child was positively related to the 
child’s IQ at 37 months of age. The study also found a sys-
tematic relationship between the quality of a parent’s speech 
toward the child and the family’s socioeconomic status. Chil-
dren in lower socioeconomic status families experienced less 
time with their parents, fewer moments of joint play, and 
exposure to fewer words. Children were less likely to have 
their speech repeated or paraphrased by their parents, less 
likely to be asked questions, and more likely to experience 
prohibitions placed on their behavior. Those parents who 
were most likely to place prohibitions on their child’s activi-
ties during this age period were less likely to listen intently 
to their child’s speech, repeat what the child had said, or ask 
the child questions.
Other studies have emphasized that it is not socioeco-
nomic status per se that infl uences language development. 
Four features of parent-child interaction differentiate high 
SES and lower SES family interactions. These are: the amount 
of talking; the use of a varied vocabulary; the early use of 
gestures to convey meaning; and the use of more complex 
sentences. The way parents talk to their infants and toddlers 
is closely related to the child’s vocabulary by age 4 (Rowe & 
Goldin-Meadow, 2009). Within socioeconomic groups, the 
more children experience responsive and stimulating inter-
actions with caregivers in the home, the further advanced 
their language abilities are by age 3 (Roberts, Burchinal, & 
Durham, 1999). However, when parents have the television 
playing, even when it is just playing in the background, the 
amount of parent-child interaction is decreased. Experimen-
tal studies have shown that when the television is playing in 
the background at home, toddlers’ social behavior declines, 
their parents engage in fewer conversations with them and 
are less responsive (Kirkorian, Pempek, Murphy, Schmidt, 
& Anderson, 2009). As result of a habitual reliance on hav-
ing the television playing, some parents inadvertently create 
environments that are disruptive to their toddler’s optimal 
language development.
The link between the frequency of parent-child interac-
tions and the child’s verbal competence is well established. 
Three different explanations have been suggested to account 
for this link:
 1. Parents and their offspring share a genetic predisposition 
for verbal competence, which is evident in the frequency 
of parent-child interactions and in the early acquisition 
of verbal skills.
 2. Parents who interact frequently with their children pro-
vide a rich array of verbal stimuli and thereby promote 
high levels of verbal comprehension and production.
 3. Children who are more verbally competent stimulate 
more interaction from their caregivers, which then es-
tablishes a more active and diverse verbal environment. 
Over time, research will no doubt clarify the nature of 
these relationships.
Certain characteristics of a language partner have been 
shown to facilitate a child’s language acquisition and commu-
nication skills (Snow, 1984; Singh, Morgan, & Best, 2002). 
When talking to infants and young children, adults tend to 
speak in a high pitch, use shorter sentences, speak slowly, 
use attention-getting strategies, and speak in a friendly, posi-
tive tone. Even older children will modify their speech when 
interacting with toddlers to hold their attention and guide 
their behavior (Rice, 1989).
Caregivers have been observed to modify their speech in 
the following ways so that they are more likely to be under-
stood (Mitchell, 2001):
 1. They simplify utterances to correspond with the toddler’s 
interests and comprehension level.
 2. They emphasize the here and now.
 3. They use a more restricted vocabulary.
 4. They do a lot of paraphrasing.
 5. They use simple, well-formed sentences.
 6. They use frequent repetitions.
 7. They use a slow rate of speech with pauses between ut-
terances and after the major content words.
These characteristics of caregiver speech are not univer-
sal; rather they reflect cultural norms for addressing tod-
dlers. They are most typically observed in middle-class, 
European American families. In one cross-cultural analysis, 
for example, African American adults in the rural South were 
observed in interaction with their children (Heath, 1989). 
Adults did not simplify or censor their speech for young chil-
dren. They frequently did not address children directly, but 
expected the children to hear what they said and to interrupt 
if they had something to add. Adults and children directed 
one another’s behavior with specifi c commands. It was just 
as acceptable for a toddler to command an adult as the other 
way around. Adults teased children, especially in the pres-
ence of others, in order to give the children a chance to 
show off their quick wit and to practice assertiveness. Within 
this language environment, children had the opportunity 
to hear a variety of opinions, gather information to extend

Scaffolding and Other Strategies for Enhancing 
Language Development. The process of language learning 
involves upward scaffolding and a process of mutual regu-
lation. Scaffolding is a metaphor for providing assistance in 
helping someone reach a new, higher level of functioning. Ver-
bal scaffolding refers to the variety of ways that adults have to 
help children reach a more advanced level of language compe-
tence, for example, by repeating words, offering new words, 
restating a child’s expressions in different words, correcting 
a child’s mistakes, or encouraging a child to say more about 
his or her ideas (Rodgers & Rodgers, 2004). With assistance, 
children can be more effective in learning vocabulary and 
expressing their ideas (Nelson, 1973). Sometimes a child may 
be misunderstood because the child’s pronunciation is so dis-
crepant from the real word (ambiance for ambulance; tommick 
cake for stomach ache). Adults can scaffold the child’s expres-
sion by modeling the correct pronunciation. Sometimes an 
adult will use a word that is a little more advanced than the 
word the child is using, which helps the child link known 
vocabulary to the new word or idea. For example: “We call 
that kind of car that has a top that goes down a convertible.” 
Scaffolding is closely related to Vygotsky’s idea of the zone of 
proximal development. By interacting with a more verbally 
competent adult or peer, children are able to reach new levels 
of linguistic ability (Landry, Miller-Loncar, Smith, & Swank, 
2002; Gregory, Kim, & Whiren, 2003).
Adults do not always interact with children by encour-
aging the child to express ideas in a more mature form. 
Sometimes, adults restate or simplify their expressions to 
make sure they are being understood. Through frequent 
interactions, adults encourage language development by 
establishing a good balance between modifying their speech 
somewhat and modeling more complex, accurate speech 
for their children. Children respond to the scaffolding by 
expressing themselves in more complete sentences and by 
using a larger vocabulary. This reflects the idea of mutual 
regulation.
Adults make use of several strategies to clarify a child’s 
meaning when the speech is unclear. One is expansion, or 
the elaboration of the child’s expressions:
CHILD: Doggie wag.
PARENT: Yes, the dog is wagging her tail.
Another strategy is prompting, often in the form of a 
question. Here the parent urges the child to say more:
CHILD: More crackel.
PARENT: You want more what?
In both of these interactions, the adult is helping the child 
to communicate more effectively by expanding on or asking 
the child to elaborate on something of interest to the child. 
The kinds of sentences that parents use help children see 
how they can produce new sentences that are more gram-
matically correct and therefore more meaningful to others.
One component of parent-child interaction that has been 
studied in detail is question-asking by the child. Children as 
young as 18 months ask questions in order to gather informa-
tion and accomplish other goals, such as asking permission 
or clarifying a situation. In one intensive study of four chil-
dren, they asked an average of 107 questions an hour while 
engaged in conversations with adults (Chouirnard, 2007). 
It appears that the ability to ask questions of parents begins 
early in infancy and may be a universal strategy that infants 
use for information gathering. However, the extent to which 
question-asking is encouraged depends on the nature of paren-
tal responses and the way parents, themselves, use question-
asking in daily conversation. For example, Tizard and Hughes 
(1984) reported that middle-class children asked more curi-
osity-based questions whereas working-class children asked 
more questions about procedural matters. Mothers who asked 
more questions had children who asked more questions. In the 
study cited previously, question-asking by parents was related 
to other aspects of their interactive style, especially the ten-
dency to expand on what their child has asked rather than to 
stop their child from speaking or acting (Hart & Risley, 1992).
In middle-class families, children are more likely to persist 
in sustained questioning where one question is followed by 
an answer, is followed by another question, and so on. This 
pattern is more likely to lead a child from factual informa-
tion to explanations and the formation of abstract concepts. 
When a child asks a lot of questions and the parent answers 
and gives additional information, this guides how the child 
builds a knowledge base and understands the world. It also 
conveys that a relationship exists between child and parent 
that allows the child to keep asking questions and to expect 
informative answers even if a question has to be asked sev-
eral times in order for the parent to understand it (Harris, 
2007). The ability to ask questions allows the child to use 
this form of challenge to gain information and to trust that 
it is all right to do this rather than to be rejected or rebuked 
with an angry response. By creating this interactive relation-
ship around inquiry and information sharing, the child and 
parent create a secure base regarding access to information 
that offers the emotional security from which new and more 
exploratory forms of curiosity can grow.
In learning vocabulary, children appear to be sensitive to 
the competence of their language partners. For example, in 
one study, 3- and 4-year-olds participated in an experiment 
where the experimenter appeared to be either knowledgeable 
and confi dent or uncertain about the name for a given toy. In 
the confi dent situation, the experimenter said things like: “I 
know right where my friend left her blinket.” In the uncertain 
situation, the experimenter said, “I’d like to help my friend, 
but I don’t know what a blinket is.” Even though the children 
in both situations learned how the toy worked, they used 
the name of the toy only if the experimenter appeared con-
fi dent (Sabbagh & Baldwin, 2001). The implication of this 
work is that by age 3, children are able to assess the expertise 
and confi dence of the language partner before incorporating 
words into their vocabulary.

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
As children enter early school age, this type of ritualized read-
ing activity provides a framework for the child’s concept of what 
it means to be a reader. Reading aloud introduces the notion that 
printed letters make up words; that stories usually have a begin-
ning, middle, and end; and that printed words and spoken words 
are similar in some ways. Experiences with handling books, 
becoming aware of the link between letters and their sounds, 
beginning to recognize printed words, and practicing the actions 
associated with reading all contribute to early reading profi ciency 
(Hammill, 2004). Depending on the context in which children 
read, they may also realize that you can learn things from printed 
words that you cannot always know from the pictures. They dis-
cover that reading is a way to learn about the world beyond what 
you can know through direct experiences.
Children and parents often engage in language games that 
expand the child’s use of words and phrases. These games are 
usually part of ongoing family life. They are introduced not 
as a separate activity but as an extension of a related activity. 
The quality of toys, social games, and conversation between 
mothers and their infants predicts the level of the child’s 
language development at ages 2 and 3 (Lacroix, Pomerleau, 
Malcuit, Seguin, & Lamarre, 2001). As an example, one 
mother described one of her 3½-year-old son David’s spon-
taneous games that began to build the bridge from speech 
to literacy. As the game developed, the object was for David 
to point to road signs as he rode with his mother to nursery 
school and for her to read as many of the signs as possible 
while they were driving along. David had created this game, 
and his mother played along willingly (Hoffman, 1985):
On the way to nursery school, David said, “Let’s talk about 
signs! What does that sign say?” I answered, “Right turn signal.”
David proceeded with, “And what does that yellow and red 
shell say?”
I answered him, “It says ‘Shell’—that’s a gasoline station.”
He asked, “Does it have seashells in it?”
I answered, “No.”
We proceeded to read signs. I read the majority as he re-
quested. However, David read “Speed Limit 35,” “Bike Route,” 
and “No Parking Any Time.” When we came to “No Parking 
This Side of Street,” he thought it was “No Parking Any Time.”
These were the signs that I was able to read as he requested 
while I was driving. They were not the only ones on the route.
Speed Limit 40 
Watch Children
Bike Route (2 times) 
No Parking Any Time (20 times)
Speed Limit 35 (12 times) Signal Ahead (3 times)
No Turn on Red (3 times) School Speed Limit (2 times)

No Parking on This Side of
Driveway 
Street (7 times)
With the achievement of language skills, children and 
their caregivers begin to explore a vast array of topics 
through spoken language. They explore their needs—hun-
ger, thirst, sleepiness, and companionship. They travel along 
Reading and Language Games. Socially interactive ritu-
als, such as telling stories, playing word games, verbal joking 
and teasing, and reading books together, also seem to enhance 
language development, especially by building vocabulary and 
preparing children to use language comfortably in social situa-
tions. Reading aloud has been identifi ed as an especially impor-
tant language activity, not only in preparation for literacy, but 
also for expanding a child’s language skills (Crain-Thoreson & 
Dale, 1992; ValdezMenchaca & Whitehurst, 1992; Hammer, 
2001). During toddlerhood, an adult may start out by reading 
picture books and asking the child questions about the pic-
tures. The adult may try to relate the picture to some event 
in the child’s life or ask the child to tell something about the 
pictures. Thus, just as in scaffolding with respect to language, 
reading along with an experienced reader can scaffold the 
child’s literacy skills (Verhoeven, 2001). Over time, the child 
becomes more and more the storyteller, while the adult listens, 
encourages, and expands the tale. Some books are read aloud 
so often that the toddler begins to read them from memory or 
retell the story in the child’s own words from the pictures.
By reading aloud and pointing to pictures, parents and their 
toddlers create an environment for the development of literacy.

Developmental Tasks | 211
Fantasy play and language are contrasting forms of represen-
tation (Copple, 2003). In acquiring language, children learn 
to translate their thoughts into a commonly shared system of 
signs and rules. For language to be effective, children must 
use the same words and grammar as the older members of 
the family, discovering how to translate their thoughts into 
existing words and categories. Fantasy serves almost the 
opposite function. In fantasy, children create characters and 
situations that may have a very private meaning. There is no 
need to make the fantasy comprehensible to an audience. 
There are probably many times when children have strong 
feelings but lack the words to express them. They may be 
frustrated by their helplessness or angry at being overlooked. 
They can express and soothe these feelings in the world of 
imagination, even though the feelings may never become 
part of a shared conversation (Erikson, 1972).
The worlds of make-believe, poetry, fairy tales, and 
folklore—the domains we often associate with childhood—
open up to the toddler as the ability for symbolization expands. 
Pretend play is not possible without semiotic thinking; it 
underlies the capacity for imagination, for allowing objects 
and people to take on new identities and new meaning.
The Nature of Pretend Play
During infancy, play often consists of the repetition of a motor 
activity. Infants delight in sucking their toes or dropping a 
spoon from the high chair. These are typical sensorimotor 
play activities. Toward the end of infancy, sensorimotor play 
includes the deliberate imitation of parental acts. Children 
who see their mothers washing the dishes may enjoy climb-
ing up on a chair and getting their hands wet, too. At fi rst, 
these imitations occur only when they are stimulated by the 
sight of the parent’s activity. As children enter toddlerhood, 
they begin to imitate parental activities when they are alone. 
the paths of emotions such as anger, sadness, delight, pride, 
and shame. They talk playfully with one another, examining 
new objects, discussing kinship relations, and creating fanta-
sies. Furthermore, adults and children talk about philosoph-
ical and moral questions like lying, helping, “what ifs,” and 
the question “how would you feel if it happened to you?” As 
children speak from their own inner world, revealing their 
own point of view, parents begin to know and appreciate 
their children’s concerns and needs in a new way. Similarly, 
children begin to hear and understand their family’s talk in 
a new way. They can question what they do not understand 
and expand what they know through family talk.
One area that has received special attention is the role of 
family conversation about feelings and its relation to a child’s 
ability to express feelings and to identify feelings in others. Chil-
dren’s use of words to refer to feelings and to describe emotions 
increases notably at 3 and 4 years of age. At this same time, chil-
dren become more skilled at recognizing feelings in others and 
in understanding how a person might feel in a certain situation 
(Brown & Dunn, 1992). Toddlers who have frequent experi-
ences of talking with their mothers when they are in distress or 
confl ict appear to be more effective at the age of 6 in understand-
ing the point of view of others and in anticipating others’ needs 
(Dunn, Brown, & Beardsall, 1991). Children who grow up in 
families that are open to identifying and talking about emotions 
are more likely to carry on this kind of talk at later ages and to 
show sensitivity to others in relationships outside the family 
(Jenkins, Turrell, Kogushi, Lollis, & Ross, 2003).

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
to separate what she knows from what the Tiger might know 
(Sabbagh, Bowman, Evraiar, & Ito, 2009).
Sometimes, adults wonder whether children can in fact 
distinguish between reality and pretense. The line between 
make-believe and reality may become blurred for all of us. 
At times, adults can encounter such confusion when watch-
ing television. Which televised images are pretend and 
which are real? Are the images and messages used to adver-
tise products real or pretend? Is a television news story real 
or pretend? Are dramatic reenactments of historical events 
real or pretend?
In simplifi ed situations, children as young as 2 can tell 
when someone is pretending and can follow the transfor-
mations in a pretend sequence (Walker-Andrews & Harris, 
1993; Rakoczy, Tomasello, & Striano, 2004). For example, 
an investigator might tell a child that she is going to fi ll two 
bowls with cereal, and then pretend to fi ll the bowls. The 
investigator then pretends to eat all of the cereal in her bowl, 
saying something at the end to indicate that all the cereal is 
gone. She then asks the child to feed a doll its cereal. Many 
2-year-olds and most 3-year-olds can follow this type of sce-
nario, selecting the bowl that is still full of pretend cereal and 
feeding it to the doll.
Studies about pretense lead to further speculations about 
what toddlers understand about someone else’s mental state. 
For example, some research focuses on what toddlers think 
is going on in someone else’s mind as they are pretending. In 
judging whether someone else is pretending or not, toddlers 
tend to focus on the way the person is acting and the context 
of the situation rather than on what the person’s intentions 
might be. Toddlers are quite accurate about judging when 
someone is engaging in make-believe or in a realistic activity, 
but they may not be able to tell you what the person is think-
ing about (Rosen, Schwebel, & Singer, 1997; Ganea, Lillard, 
& Turkheimer, 2004; Sobel, 2004).
Toddlers know the difference between what an object 
really is and what someone is pretending that it is (Flavell, 
Flavell, & Green, 1987). For example, 3-year-olds under-
stand that a sponge is really a sponge, but they can pretend it 
is a boat fl oating in the water or a car driving along the road. 
Three-year-olds also understand the difference between 
knowing something and pretending something. If they see a 
rabbit, they know it is real, but they also know that they do 
not have to have seen a rabbit in order to imagine one. How-
ever, compared with older children, 3-year-olds are more 
convinced that imagination reflects reality. If they imag-
ine something, like a fi re-breathing dragon or a horse with 
wings, they think it may actually exist. In contrast, 4-year-
olds understand that something that is imagined may not 
have a counterpart in reality (Woolley & Wellman, 1993).
Changes in Fantasy Play during Toddlerhood
Toddlers can direct their play in response to mental images 
that they have generated by themselves. At fi rst, their sym-
bolic play is characterized by the simple repetition of familiar 
activities. Pretending to sweep the fl oor, to be asleep, to be 
A vivid mental image of an action permits them to copy what 
they recall instead of what they see. This is the beginning of 
symbolic play. Before the period of preoperational thought, 
children do not really pretend because they cannot let one 
thing stand for something else. Once the capacity for sym-
bolic thought emerges, children become increasingly fl exible 
in allowing an object to take on a wide variety of pretend 
identities.
Two-year-olds appear to be able to understand the con-
text of a pretend situation. Using pretend props, they can 
pretend to feed a hungry animal or give a drink to a thirsty 
animal. They can assign a pretend function to a substitute 
prop, treating a wooden block as if it were a banana or a 
piece of cake. And they can follow through with the con-
sequences of a pretend situation, like pretending to wipe 
up pretend spilled tea with a towel (Harris & Kavanaugh, 
1993). These young children can construct a make-believe 
world, in which objects are assigned a pretend meaning (toy 
blocks can be bananas) and words are used in pretend ways 
(“feed the monkey a banana” is acted out by putting a toy 
block up to the mouth of a toy monkey).
The Capacity for Pretense
A child’s ability to pretend provides insight into the child’s 
“theory of mind.” Theory of mind refers to the way we 
account for the behaviors of others. This includes the abil-
ity to attribute beliefs, desires, and intentions to others, and 
to realize that these beliefs, desires, and intentions may be 
the cause for behaviors. Theory of mind also allows children 
to understand that it is possible for other people to have 
beliefs, desires, or intentions that differ from their own. This 
understanding is a theory because you cannot actually see the 
other person’s beliefs, desires, or intentions; you have to infer 
them from your own observations and understanding of how 
minds work. Theory of mind is a representational extension 
of the capacities for causal reasoning discussed in infancy. 
Young babies distinguish animate and inanimate objects; 
they attribute intentions and goal-directedness to animate 
objects (Meltzoff, 1995). These very early understandings 
provide the platform on which more complex representa-
tions about others are built. As children mature, sometime 
between the ages of 3 and 5, they become increasingly accu-
rate in predicting how another person might act, depending 
on that person’s beliefs or knowledge. Imagine the following 
situation. Allison is shown a small box and asked what she 
thinks is in the box. Allison says she doesn’t know. Then, the 
experimenter opens the box and shows Allison that there is 
a toy elephant in the box. Now, the experimenter closes the 
box, and introduces Allison to a Tiger puppet. The experi-
menter asks Allison, “What does Tiger think is in the box?” 
Allison’s answer is evidence about how her theory of mind 
is operating. If Allison says, “The Tiger doesn’t know what’s 
in the box,” she is demonstrating advanced reasoning about 
the mind of the other. If Allison says, “The tiger thinks there 
is an elephant in the box,” she is demonstrating immature 
reasoning about the mind of the other, since she is not able

Play moves away from common daily experiences to 
invented worlds based on stories, television programs, or 
purely imagined characters and situations. Three-year-
olds begin to generate negative as well as positive imagi-
nary images, including fears about supernatural creatures, 
witches, ghosts, and monsters. Children may take the roles 
of characters with extraordinary powers. They may pretend 
to fl y, become invisible, or transform themselves into other 
shapes with the aid of a few secret words or gestures. Their 
identifi cation with a particular fantasy hero or heroine may 
last for days or even weeks as they involve the characters of 
the story in a variety of fantasy situations.
Fourth, fantasy play becomes more planned and orga-
nized. The planning emerges as children try to coordinate 
their pretend play with other players. It is also a product of a 
new realization of what makes pretend play most fun, and of 
the desire to make sure that those components are included 
in the play. In a preschool or day care group, certain children 
are likely to take the lead in organizing the direction of fan-
tasy play. They may set the play in motion or give it direction 
by suggesting the use of certain props, assigning roles, or 
working out the context of the play. In this example, a child 
demonstrates this kind of leadership:
STUART (climbing up on a tractor tire): This will be our shark 
ship, OK? Get on quick, Jeremy! The sharks will eat you!
JEREMY: No! This is my police helicopter!
STUART: Well, OK. We’re police. But we need to chase the 
sharks, OK? I see the sharks way down there! Come on!
JEREMY: OK. Let’s get ’em! (They both make helicopter noises 
and swat at make-believe sharks with plastic garden tools.) 
(Trawick-Smith, 1988, p. 53)
a dog or a cat, and to drive a car are some of the early play 
activities of toddlers. Fantasy play changes in four ways dur-
ing toddlerhood (Lucariello, 1987; Tamis-LeMonda, Uzgiris, 
& Bornstein, 2002):
 1. The action component becomes more complex as chil-
dren integrate a sequence of actions.
 2. Children’s focus shifts from the self to fantasies that in-
volve others and the creation of multiple roles.
 3. The play involves the use of substitute objects, including 
objects children only pretend to have, and eventually the 
invention of complex characters and situations.
 4. The play becomes more organized and planned, and play 
leaders emerge.
First, children combine a number of actions in a play 
sequence. From pretending to sweep the fl oor or take a nap, 
they devise strings of activities that are part of a complex 
play sequence. While playing fi refi ghter, children may pre-
tend to be the fi re truck, the hose, the ladder, the engine, 
the siren, the people being rescued, and the fi refi ghters. All 
the elements of the situation are brought under the children’s 
control through this fantasy enactment.
Second, children become increasingly able to include oth-
ers in their play and to shift the focus of the play from the 
self to the others (Howes, 1987; Howes, Unger, & Seidner, 
1989). One can see a distinction here between solitary pre-
tense, social play, and social pretend play. Children engaged 
in solitary pretense are involved in their own fantasy activi-
ties, such as pretending that they are driving a car or giving a 
baby a bath. Children engaged in social play join with other 
children in some activity. They may dig together in the sand, 
build with blocks, or imitate each other’s silly noises. In social 
pretend play, children have to coordinate their pretense. They 
establish a fantasy structure, take roles, agree on the make-
believe meaning of props, and solve pretend problems. That 
2- and 3-year-olds can participate in this type of coordinated 
fantasy play is remarkable, especially given their very limited 
use of language to establish and sustain coordination.
Third, fantasy play changes as children become more fl ex-
ible in their use of substitute objects in their play. Fantasy 
play begins in the areas closest to children’s daily experi-
ence. They use real objects or play versions of those objects 
as props in their pretense. For example, they pick up a toy 
telephone and pretend to call Grandma, or they pretend to 
have a picnic with toy cups and plates and plastic foods. But 
as they develop their fantasy skills, these props are no longer 
essential. Children can invent objects, create novel uses for 
common objects, and sometimes pretend to have an object 
when they have nothing (Boyatzis & Watson, 1993). Despite 
these remarkably inventive capacities to impose meaning 
on neutral objects, children’s toys have become increasingly 
more realistic, refl ecting the nature of modern technology. 
Whereas experts in early childhood education continue to 
recommend the use of fl exible, open-ended play materials 
for young children, toy makers appear to be enthusiastic 
about producing realistic play materials.
One of the favorite forms of social pretense is “doctor.” With 
the use of a few props, friends can explore the fascinating realm 
of illness, healing, comforting, and advising. Patient-doctor play 
allows children to gain mastery over an area of great concern 
and uncertainty.

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
Vygotsky used the term zone of proximal development 
to refer to the distance between the actual level of a child’s 
performance, and the potential level that a child is capable of 
reaching with help from a more skilled peer or adult. When 
trying to assess a child’s developmental level, it is important 
to understand not only what the child already knows and 
can already perform, but also the domains that are in prog-
ress, so to speak—the areas that are emerging as new fi elds of 
mastery. Normally adults—especially parents and teachers—
and more advanced peers promote development by engaging 
children in activities and problem-solving tasks that draw 
children into their zone of proximal development—the new 
directions along which their capacities are moving. However, 
in play, Vygotsky saw a cognitive process that in and of itself 
captures a foreshadowing of the child’s next higher level of 
functioning.
In pretend play, children address areas where they do 
not yet feel competent in their lives and try to act as if they 
were competent. They set rules for their performance, and 
they commit themselves to function according to them. So 
if a child is pretending to be a good mother, she brings for-
ward all the ideas she has about how to be a good mother 
and applies them to the pretend situation. Similarly, if a child 
is pretending to be a superhero, she imposes all the rules 
of power, goodness, and helpfulness that she knows of and 
tries to limit her actions to those rules. Vygotsky regarded 
fantasy play as a window into the areas of competence that 
the child is striving to master but are still out of reach.
Erikson (1972) considered fantasy play vital in promot-
ing personality and social development. He valued play as a 
mechanism for dramatizing the psychological confl icts that 
children are struggling with, such as angry feelings toward 
their siblings or parents, or jealousy over a friend’s new toys. 
According to Erikson, the play often not only represents the 
problem but also offers a solution, so that children experi-
ence some new sense of resolution and a reduction in the 
tension associated with the confl ict. Symbolic play provides 
a certain fl exibility or leeway in structuring the situation and, 
at the same time, imposes some limits so that children may 
experience a new mastery of issues that are perplexing or 
overwhelming in real life. One way that children use pretend 
play to explore relationship issues and mastery of puzzling 
questions involves creating an imaginary companion to serve 
as a play partner (see the box “Imaginary Companions”).
Pretend play is a form of representational thought—
a way that children experiment with the relationships of 
objects and social roles. For children who have some forms 
of language delay, observations of their pretense provides 
insight into their cognitive capacities (Butterfi eld, 1994). 
Research suggests that pretend play actually fosters cog-
nitive, emotional, and social development. Children who 
have well-developed pretending skills tend to be well 
liked by their peers and to be viewed as leaders. This is a 
result of their advanced communication skills, their greater 
ability to take the point of view of others, and their abil-
ity to reason about social situations. Children who have 
Some theorists distinguish symbolic role-playing from 
games with rules, implying that the latter are guided by a 
formal set of mental operations that constrain play, whereas 
the former is open and fl exible. However, it is clear that pre-
tend play operates within a rule-bound structure (Vygotsky, 
1978; Harris & Kavanaugh, 1993). In order to coordinate 
symbolic play with a partner, children have to come to some 
mutual understanding about the situation, props, characters, 
and plot. The players have to limit their behavior in ways 
that conform to the unspoken or latent rules of the pretense. 
For example, if the children decide that certain leaves are 
the pretend food, then no one can use the leaves as bricks 
to build a house or as hats. If one player is supposed to be 
the mommy, that player has to act like the mommy and not 
like the baby. In games with rules, the rules are more readily 
spelled out, but in both types of play, part of what makes it 
fun is to function within the boundaries of certain kinds of 
constraints.
Dramatic role-playing, in which a child takes on the role 
of another person or creates a fantasy situation, increases 
steadily from the ages of 3 through 5. By the age of 6, how-
ever, children become involved in games with rules. They 
may use their fantasy skills during play by making up new 
games or new rules rather than by engaging in pretend play. 
If one is looking for the experts in diversifi ed, elaborated fan-
tasy, observe 4- and 5-year-olds.
Theoretical Views about the Contributions 
of Fantasy Play to Development
Fantasy play is not simply a diversion. Children use fantasy 
to experiment with and understand their social and physi-
cal environments and to expand their thinking (Pellegrini & 
Bjorklund, 2004). Theoretical views of the importance and 
value of fantasy play vary widely. Here we consider how Piaget, 
Vygotsky, and Erikson understood the role of fantasy play.
Piaget (1962) emphasized the assimilative value of play. 
He believed that through fantasy and symbolic play, children 
are able to make meaning of experiences and events that are 
beyond their full comprehension. Fantasy play is a private 
world to which the rules of social convention and the logic 
of the physical world do not necessarily apply. From this per-
spective, fantasy play frees the child from the immediacy of 
reality, permitting mental manipulations and modifi cations 
of objects and events. One cognitive benefi t of fantasy play is 
the opportunity to engage in role reversal, taking turns play-
ing the various characters, which helps to advance perspec-
tive taking among play companions.
Vygotsky (1978) saw fantasy play quite differently.
Play creates a zone of proximal development of the 
child. In play a child always behaves beyond his aver-
age age, above his daily behavior; in play it is as though 
he were a head taller than himself. As in the focus of a 
magnifying glass, play contains all developmental ten-
dencies in a condensed form and is itself a major source 
of development. (p. 102)

Imaginary 
Companions
PROBABLY THE MOST sophisticated 
form of symbolic play is the creation 
of an imaginary friend (Singer, 1975). 
An imaginary friend, which may be an 
animal, a child, or some other creature, 
springs complete in concept from the 
mind of the child. It occupies space. 
It has its own personality, which is 
consistent from day to day. It has its 
own likes and dislikes, which are not 
necessarily the same as those of its 
creator. The prevalence of imaginary 
companions may be greater than 
one might have guessed. Although 
not all children who have imaginary 
companions will disclose this information 
to adults, some studies have shown 
that as many as 65% of young children 
have imaginary companions, and some 
children have more than one (Singer & 
Singer, 1990).
In one study in the United Kingdom, 
1,800 children were asked about past 
or present experience with imaginary 
companions. Roughly 46% said 
they had one (Pearson et al., 2001). 
When parents were surveyed about 
their children, those with imaginary 
companions were more likely to be 
fi rstborn or only children, were judged 
by parents to be very imaginative in 
other aspects of their play, and to enjoy 
magical or fantasy play as compared 
to other forms of play. Children who 
have imaginary companions also 
report a more vivid imagery when 
daydreaming or engaging in pretend 
play, and more mythical creatures in 
their dreams (Bouldin, 2006). Children 
who have imaginary companions also 
tend to have more extensive language 
competence, which is observable in 
their ongoing conversations with their 
invisible friend (Bouldin & Pratt, 1999; 
Gleason, Sebanc, & Hartup, 2003). 
One by-product of having ongoing 
conversations with an imaginary 
companion and telling others about 
one’s adventures with an imaginary 
companion is that children gain practice 
in storytelling. As a result, children 
who have imaginary companions also 
have advanced abilities to produce 
verbal narratives as evidenced in the 
way they retell stories, explain past 
situations to others, and expand on 
their experiences in social conversations 
(Trifoni & Reese, 2009).
In one study, investigators invited 
children who had imaginary companions 
to come to the laboratory and play with 
their companions (Taylor, Cartwright, 
& Carlson, 1993). The children seemed 
willing to talk about their companions, 
and they thought the investigators 
would be able to see and touch their 
companions just as they could. For 
most of the children, the companions 
remained consistent for 6 months and 
retained an active role in the child’s 
fantasy life.
Several functions are served by an 
imaginary friend: it takes the place of 
other children when there are none 
around; it serves as a play companion 
for pretend play; it serves as a confi dant 
for children’s private expression; and 
it is often involved in their efforts to 
differentiate between right and wrong 
(Taylor & Mannering, 2006). Children can 
distinguish the social relationship they 
have with their imaginary companion 
from the relationships they have with 
parents, siblings, and best friends. 
Imaginary companions and real friends 
are viewed as similar in many ways, but 
children are more likely to comfort and 
nurture their imaginary friend than their 
real friend (Gleason, 2002).
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. How do imaginary friends get cre-
ated? What experiences, ideas, or 
mental states might be necessary in 
order for an imaginary companion to 
be invented?
 2. Imagine that you are 3 or 4 years old. 
What type of imaginary companion 
would you create for yourself? Why? 
Could you have an imaginary com-
panion now? Is there an equivalent of 
an imaginary companion in the lives 
of adults? What functions do they 
fi ll?
 3. Design a study to explore the 
similarities and differences between 
imaginary friends and real friends. 
What approach might you take to in-
vestigate this question? What would 
be some challenges you would need 
to overcome in order to pursue this 
problem?
 4. Suppose that a parent comes to 
you with a concern about the fact 
that their child has an imaginary 
companion. What information 
would you need in order to under-
stand the nature of the imaginary 
companion and the functions it 
serves for the child? Depending on 
the information you gather, what 
might be the optimal approach for 
parents toward their child’s imagi-
nary companion?
APPLYING THEORY AND RESEARCH TO LIFE
been encouraged in a playful, imaginative approach to 
the manipulation and exploration of materials and objects 
through fantasy show more complex language use and 
more fl exible approaches to problem solving. Children who 
have frequent opportunities for pretend play—especially 
with a more experienced play partner—are better able to 
express their feelings, show higher levels of empathy, and 
are more aware of their emotional states (Galyer & Evans, 
2001; Lindsey & Colwell, 2003).
Fantasy play is essential for the full social, intellectual, 
and emotional development of young children. Some par-
ents and teachers want to defi ne a young child’s cognitive 
growth in terms of the acquisition of words and concepts 
that seem relevant to the real world. They emphasize the 
importance of learning numbers and letters, memorizing 
facts, and learning to read. However, research on cognitive 
development suggests that gains in the capacity for symbolic 
thought provide essential underpinnings for subsequent

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
under 5 are thought to have a special link with the female 
creator spirit. Adults may watch a young child playing alone, 
interacting with imaginary companions by giving out pre-
tend food, or speaking to them in a happy tone. Rather than 
dismissing this activity as child’s play, the adults believe that 
the child is interacting with the spirit world and will take 
care not to disrupt the activity. An Ijaw woman who wants to 
become pregnant might try to appeal to a small child, hop-
ing that if she is kind to the child, the child will use this 
special link to the spirit world to help bring about the preg-
nancy (Valsiner, 2000). The nature and role of imaginary 
companions may be tolerated by U.S. families, but among 
scholars of child development, they are considered evidence 
of advanced symbolic representation, an emerging sense of 
self, and a strategy for achieving new levels of self-control.
Self-Control
Objective 4. To examine the development of self-
control, especially impulse management and goal 
attainment, highlighting strategies young children use 
to help regulate their actions.
Do you ever fi nd that you roll over for 10 more minutes of 
sleep even when you know you should get out of bed? Do you 
let your mind wander when you need to be paying attention? 
Do you go for that extra helping of cake when you are trying 
to lose 5 pounds? These are just a few examples of lapses in 
self-control. Self-regulation is frequently noted as a marker of 
maturity. The ability to control impulses, direct action toward 
a goal, express and inhibit the expression of emotions, and 
resist temptation are all evidence of this capacity (Heatherton, 
2000; Myrseth & Fishbach, 2009). Over time, self-control 
becomes a foundation for moral behavior. For toddlers, self-
control is the ability to comply with a request, modify behav-
ior according to the situation, initiate or postpone action, 
and behave in a socially acceptable way without having to be 
guided or directed by someone else (Kopp, 1982). In the fol-
lowing sections we consider two components of self-control: 
(1) control of impulses, which you might think of as a form of 
self-control directed inward toward managing one’s emotional 
states and drives (see the “Applying Theory and Research to 
Life” box below for a discussion of the expression and con-
trol of angry feelings); and (2) self-directed goal attainment, 
which you might think of as a form of self-control directed 
outward toward mastery of the environment.
Control of Impulses
Early in infancy, self-control is usually understood as the 
infant’s ability to prevent the disorganization of behavior 
brought on by overstimulation and to recover from emotional 
distress. Babies have a variety of internal regulating strategies 
(Kopp, 1982). For example, by sucking or rocking, babies 
can soothe themselves. They can also resist overstimulation 
intellectual abilities, such as abstract reasoning and inven-
tive problem solving.
The Role of Play Companions
Cognitive developmental theory emphasizes the normal 
emergence of representational thought and symbolic play as 
the natural outcome of cognitive maturation during toddler-
hood. However, the quality of that play as well as its content 
depends in part on the behavior of a child’s play compan-
ions. Consider the following incident:
In a university preschool where college students were hav-
ing their fi rst supervised experience as teachers of young 
children, a child of 3 made a bid for some pretend play 
with a student teacher. The child picked up the toy tele-
phone and made ringing noises. The student teacher picked 
up another phone and said, “Hello.” The child asked, “Is 
Milly there?” The student teacher said, “No,” and hung up 
the phone. Rather than extending the pretense into a more 
elaborate social pretend situation by saying something like 
“Who is calling?” or pretending to put Milly on the phone, 
the student teacher brought the scenario to a close.
As play companions, parents, siblings, peers, and child 
care professionals can signifi cantly enrich a child’s fantasy 
play. Play companions can elaborate a child’s capacity for 
fantasy, legitimize fantasy play, and help the child to explore 
new domains of fantasy. Research has shown that when 
mothers are available as play companions, the symbolic play 
of their 2-year-old children is more complex and lasts longer 
(Slade, 1987; Tamis-LeMonda, Uzgiris, & Bornstein, 2002). 
When adults are trained to engage in and encourage pretend 
play with toddlers, the toddlers show a higher level of ability 
to coordinate their responses with those of the adults. From 
age 16 to 32 months, toddlers become increasingly skillful 
in directing an adult’s behavior and negotiating changes in 
kinds of play (Eckerman & Didow, 1989). Early and fre-
quent opportunities to pretend with older siblings as well as 
with parents contribute to a young child’s ability to under-
stand other people’s feelings and beliefs. As toddlers experi-
ment with pretend roles, construct fantasy situations, and 
manipulate objects with a play companion, they are forced 
to establish new channels of shared meaning, thus fostering 
a new degree of awareness about self and others (Youngblade 
& Dunn, 1995).
In child care settings, the availability of a consistent group 
of age-mates results in  more complex, coordinated play. In 
contrast, children who have had many changes in their child 
care arrangements are less likely to engage in complex social 
pretend play with other children (Howes & Stewart, 1987). 
Because toddlers rely so heavily on imitation and nonverbal 
signals to initiate and develop their social pretend play, the 
more time they have together, the more complex their fan-
tasy play will be (Eckerman & Didow, 1996).
The importance of pretense and the way pretend play is 
nurtured depends in part on the meaning it is given in one’s 
culture. For example, among the Ijaw of Nigeria, children

by turning away from the source of stimulation, crying, or 
going to sleep.
During toddlerhood, children improve their ability to 
modify and control their impulses. The case of Colin illus-
trates how toddlers may fail to control their impulses. Some-
times, they simply cannot interrupt an ongoing action, even 
one they know is inappropriate. Colin, age 2 years 9 months, 
is just starting preschool:
In his relations with children, Colin progressed quickly 
from a quiet, friendly, watching relationship on the fi rst 
few days to actively hugging the other children. The hug-
ging seemed to be in an excess of friendliness and was only 
mildly aggressive. Having started hugging, he didn’t know 
how to stop, and usually just held on until he pulled the 
child down to the fl oor. This was followed very closely by 
hair pulling. He didn’t pull viciously, but still held on long 
enough to get a good resistance from the child. He grabbed 
toys from others. When stopped by an adult from any of 
these acts, he was very responsive to reason, would say, 
smiling, “I won’t do it any more,” would tear around the 
room in disorganized activity, and then return to hugging 
or pulling hair. (Murphy, 1956, pp. 11–12)
From age 2 to 4, most children are increasingly able to 
modify and control their impulses and withstand delays in 
gratifi cation. They also become more willing to modify their 
behavior because they do not wish to cause distress to oth-
ers. The ability to regulate or restrain behavior is a product 
of changing cognitive, social, and emotional competencies. 
Children become increasingly sensitive to the negative con-
sequences of impulsive acts. At the same time, they develop 
new strategies to help manage feelings of frustration, such 
as distracting themselves and redirecting their attention to 
some alternative activity or toy, creating a pretend scenario 
in which they soothe themselves through conversation 
with a fantasy character, using some physical soothing or 
comforting strategy like thumb sucking or cuddling with a 
blanket, and seeking comfort or distraction from a parent or 
play companion (Zahn-Waxler, Radke-Yarrow, Wagner, & 
Chapman, 1992; Grolnick, Bridges, & Connell, 1996).
Increasing Sensitivity to the Distress of Others. Tod-
dlers can observe and empathize with distress expressed in 
others, both children and adults. Moreover, they begin to 
understand when they have been the cause of someone else’s 
distress (Zahn-Waxler, Radke-Yarrow et al., 1992; Zahn-
Waxler, Robinson, & Emde, 1992). Often, the socializa-
tion environment helps to focus toddlers’ attention on these 
instances when parents or teachers point out their actions 
and the consequences. The following observation from a 
study of family interaction shows how a conversation about 
negative consequences and a child’s concern over his mother’s 
distress contributed to the self-regulation of impulses:
Danny is 33 months old. He and his mother are at the 
sink washing dishes. Danny blows a handful of suds at his 
mother and some gets in her eyes. Danny is laughing at this 
new game.
MOTHER: No! Nuh uh, Danny. Danny, you got it in my eye. 
(mild negative affect)
Danny stops laughing.
MOTHER: Don’t do that in my eye, OK? It hurts to get soap 
in your eye.
DANNY: (very serious) I won’t. (Brown & Dunn, 1992, 
pp. 347–348)

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
The Expression and 
Control of Angry 
Feelings
THE EXPRESSION OF anger, which is 
important to the child’s development 
of a sense of autonomy, typically 
generates tension between parents 
and children (Wenar, 1982). Toddlers 
get angry for many reasons, including 
inability to perform a task, parental 
restrictions on behavior, and peer or 
sibling rivalry. As toddlers become 
increasingly involved in directing the 
outcomes of their activities, they get 
angry when someone interrupts them 
or offers unrequested assistance. 
Toddlers are likely to get angry when 
they are tired, or when forced to make 
a transition from something they are 
enjoying to something someone else 
wants them to do. Studies involving 
observational coding of toddler 
behavior and mothers’ reports of infants 
and toddlers provide evidence that 
during the second year of life, children 
begin to use physical aggression toward 
other children, especially when they 
want to get something that another 
child has or in retaliation if a child hits 
them (Baillargeon et al., 2007). The most 
common forms of physical aggression 
at this age are kicking, biting, pushing, 
and hitting. Between ages 2 and 5, 
the frequency of physical aggression 
declines as children develop effective 
strategies for self-control.
In addition to physical aggression, 
some children use relational aggression 
to harm others. In toddlerhood, relational 
aggression involves behaviors that result 
in social exclusion by refusing to let a 
child join in a play activity, making fun of 
another child, telling another child that 
you don’t want to be his or her friend, or 
failing to invite one child to a party when 
many other children in the class or group 
are invited (Murray-Close & Ostrov, 
2009).
Some children are temperamentally 
more aggressive than others. Although 
occasional acts of aggression are not 
uncommon among toddlers, only a small 
percentage of toddlers are frequently 
aggressive and irritable (Tremblay et al., 
2004; Paulussen-Hoogeboom, Stams, 
Hermanns, & Peetsma, 2007). These 
children have been characterized by 
negative emotionality and diffi culties 
in emotion regulation. They are more 
frequently in a negative mood, get angry 
easily, have a highly intense negative 
reaction to any type of limit-setting, and 
when upset, have a hard time recovering 
or returning to a calm state (Calkins & 
Dedmon, 2000).
Children rely on their parents as 
models for learning how to express and 
control anger. The times when parents 
are angry are very important. Children 
learn as much or more about the 
expression of anger from watching their 
parents when they are angry as they do 
from verbal explanations or punishment 
(Bandura, 1977). Children are sensitive 
to angry expressions directed toward 
them through both verbal and nonverbal 
behavior. In some parent-child dyads, 
anger is a dominant theme in the 
parenting interactions (Aber, Belsky, 
Slade, & Crnic, 1999). Parents who 
are angry and abusive toward their 
children provide a model for the 
imitation of angry behavior. Children are 
also sensitive to anger between their 
parents, even when it is not directed at 
them. Parents’ hostility to each other, 
expressed through quarrels, sarcasm, 
and physical abuse, increases children’s 
sensitivity to anger and is closely 
related to disturbances in development 
(Kochanska, Aksan, & Joy, 2007).
Not all parenting efforts are directed 
at inhibiting the expression of anger. 
In an ethnographic study of the 
socialization of anger and aggression, 
three 2-year-old girls and their mothers 
from a working-class neighborhood 
of Baltimore were studied in detail. 
The mothers considered assertiveness 
APPLYING THEORY AND RESEARCH TO LIFE
Discipline Strategies and Impulse Control. In tod-
dlerhood, the immediate aim of discipline is to achieve 
compliance (Kochanska, Aksan, & Koenig, 1995). A par-
ent typically wants children to stop doing something (“Don’t 
touch those fi gurines; they might break”) or to do something 
(“Help me put the toys away now; it’s time to go to bed”). If 
the child complies, a parent might respond positively by 
smiling, patting the child or giving a hug, or compliment-
ing the child for being good, helpful, or obedient. If the child 
does not comply, a parent may try some form of distrac-
tion or offer some choice (“You can help clean up now or in 
5 minutes”). But if compliance is not forthcoming, some type 
of discipline is likely to ensue. Discipline practices have been 
described in three general categories (Hoffman, 1977):
 1. Power assertion: Physical punishment; shouting; at-
tempts to physically move a child or inhibit behavior; 
taking away privileges or resources; or threatening any 
of these things.
 2. Love withdrawal: Expressing anger, disappointment, or 
disapproval; refusing to communicate; walking out or 
turning away.
 3. Inductions: Explaining why the behavior was wrong; 
pointing out the consequences of the behavior to others; 
redirecting the behavior by appealing to the child’s sense 
of mastery, fair play, or love of another person.
In addition to these three general categories of discipline 
techniques, parental modeling and reinforcement of accept-
able behaviors are signifi cant in the development of internal 
control (Maccoby, 1992). In order to correct their behavior, 
children must know what acts are considered appropriate as 
well as how to inhibit their inappropriate acts. Modeling and 
reinforcement aid children in directing their behavior; disci-
pline serves to inhibit or redirect it.
The manner in which the discipline is carried out over 
time is associated with child outcomes, especially increases 
in compliance, prosocial behavior, and the eventual

and self-defense essential to survival 
in their neighborhood. Along with 
socialization strategies that focused on 
controlling inappropriate aggression, 
the mothers found many ways to 
model aggressiveness as they talked 
to others in the girls’ presence and to 
reward certain displays of toughness 
and assertiveness in the girls’ behavior 
(Miller & Sperry, 1987).
Children who can express anger 
without losing control make tremendous 
gains in the development of autonomy. 
Anger or confl ict with parents gives 
toddlers evidence that they are indeed 
separate from their parents and that 
this separateness, although painful, is 
legitimate. Children who are severely 
punished or ridiculed for their anger 
are left in a state of doubt. They see 
models for the expression of anger in 
the way their parents respond to them, 
and yet they are told that anger is not 
appropriate for them. The goal in the 
socialization of angry feelings is to help 
children fi nd legitimate expressions of 
anger without hurting themselves or 
others.
Several strategies help young 
children manage or reduce the intensity 
of their anger. These parenting 
strategies have to be coordinated 
with the child’s temperament and 
the ecological context in which 
parenting takes place (Thompson, 1990; 
Brinkmeyer & Eyberg, 2003; Kochanska, 
Aksan, & Joy, 2007).
• Increase a child’s experiences of 
positive, responsive interactions with 
caregivers, which has been found to 
increase a child’s sense of security 
and willingness to cooperate with 
parental requests.
• Provide brief time-out periods in a 
nearby quiet area to help children 
return to a calm state.
• Arouse feelings that are incompatible 
with anger, especially empathy for a 
possible target for one’s aggressive 
impulses.
• Minimize exposure to stimuli 
that arouse aggressive or fearful 
impulses.
• Explain the consequences of a child’s 
aggressive actions for others.
• Suggest ideas about acceptable ways 
to express angry feelings.
• Model strategies for nonaggressive 
responses to frustration and confl ict.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. What are some of the adaptive func-
tions of anger as a basic emotion?
 2. How does the expression of anger 
help a toddler achieve autonomy? 
What functions might the expression 
of anger serve in later stages of 
development?
 3. Why is anger both diffi cult to express 
and diffi cult to control once it is 
expressed?
 4. How does the expression of angry 
feelings fi t in with your ideas about 
optimal child rearing strategies and 
socialization goals?
 5. The research suggests that there are 
temperamental differences in the ten-
dency to get angry, and these differ-
ences might be accentuated by certain 
parenting practices. Imagine that you 
are advising parents about how to 
respond to their child’s anger. What 
different advice would you give if you 
thought that the child was especially 
anger-prone as compared to a child who 
was especially fearful and inhibited?
 6. What might be some gender differ-
ences in the experiences of anger 
and in societal preferences for the 
expression and control of anger? Do 
you think there is a biological basis 
for gender differences in aggressive 
behavior? What evidence would you 
need to support your conclusion?
 7. Imagine that you tried all the meth-
ods suggested at the end of the box 
to help reduce your child’s aggres-
siveness and none of them was 
effective. What would you conclude? 
What would you do?
internalization of moral standards; or increases in noncom-
pliance, aggressiveness, and low levels of moral reasoning. 
Three features of the approach to discipline appear to be 
important (O’Leary, 1995):
 1. The discipline should be immediate or as close in time 
to the situation as possible. Laxness in discipline, such as 
laughing at an undesirable behavior, waiting too long to re-
spond, reprimanding the child sometimes but not at other 
times for the same misconduct, or inadvertently rewarding 
a child for misconduct are all practices that are likely to 
increase rather than decrease the undesired behavior.
 2. The discipline for a toddler should be brief. It is impor-
tant to make sure that the toddler understands what the 
misbehavior was and why it was wrong, but the expla-
nation should be concise and presented at the toddler’s 
level of understanding. Punishment involving love with-
drawal is especially likely to be carried on too long. The 
parent should make sure the toddler knows when the 
punishment is over, and not let the child spend hours 
thinking the parent is still angry.
 3. The discipline should be appropriately fi rm, but not over-
reactive. The response to noncompliance should be coor-
dinated with the child’s behavior, focusing on expressing 
concern for the harm that was done, engaging the child 
in talking about how to repair the situation, and setting 
the stage for what the child might do next (Edwards & 
Liu, 2002). Practices that are intensely harsh, abusive, 
or cruel, whether they involve physical or emotional in-
tensity, are associated with increases in problem behav-
iors. Infrequent use of power-assertive punishment in an 
overall context of a warm, nurturing relationship may be 
effective in fostering compliance. However, intense and 
frequent harsh punishment is associated with a variety of 
maladaptive consequences for children (Weiss, Dodge, 
Bates, & Petit, 1992; Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002).

220 | 
CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
outgoing may experience more situations in which their 
actions are viewed as disruptive or in need of control. In con-
trast, children who are more socially inhibited, withdrawn, 
or passive may encounter fewer expectations to curb or 
restrict their behavior (Kochanska & Radke-Yarrow, 1992). 
The temperamental characteristic described as effortful con-
trol refers to a child’s ability to suppress a dominant response 
and perform a subdominant response instead. For example, 
even when Riley wants to shout out loud, he can talk in a 
whisper because he sees that grandpa is napping and he 
does not want to wake grandpa. Infants who are less emo-
tionally intense in their expressions of anger or joy, and who 
are more cautious in a novel situation, have been found to 
have greater effortful control in toddlerhood (Kochanska & 
Knaack, 2003).
In addition, effortful control refl ects the ability to slow 
down one’s actions on request and suppress movement in 
response to instructions (e.g., sit still; stop fi dgeting; walk, 
don’t run). One measure of effortful control requires a child 
to move a toy turtle and a toy rabbit along a curved path 
toward a barn. Effortful control is demonstrated in the child’s 
ability to move the rabbit quickly and the turtle slowly along 
the same path. Children show substantial improvement in 
their effortful control over the period from ages 2 to 4 (Li-
Grining, 2007). Longitudinal evidence suggests that effortful 
control in toddlerhood provides a basis for the formation of 
conscience and moral development in the early school-age 
period. It allows the young child to respond more easily to 
parental requests and to interrupt or suppress undesirable 
behaviors (Kochanska, Murray, & Harlan, 2000).
Third, the capacity for self-regulation may depend on the 
quality of the mother-infant attachment. Maternal responsive-
ness, emotional expressiveness, and a sense of connection are 
associated with a child’s ability to delay gratifi cation. Sensitive 
caregiving, in which the mother and toddler are able to coor-
dinate their interactions to sustain longer periods of mutually 
responsive interaction, is associated with an enhanced capac-
ity for self-regulation. Toddlers who experience this rhyth-
mic co-regulation are better able to distract themselves and 
Economic hardship produces emotional distress among 
parents, which is likely to result in harsh, neglectful, or 
erratic parent-child interactions (McLoyd, 1990). Mothers 
living in poverty are more likely than more affl uent moth-
ers to use power assertion and physical punishment as a 
form of discipline. Studies of the relationship of poverty to 
parenting practices and children’s mental health have found 
that the amount of spanking parents use is directly related 
to the family’s current level of poverty. This pattern has been 
observed in Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White fami-
lies. Furthermore, the more likely parents are to use spank-
ing and harsh discipline—especially when it is used without 
accompanying emotional support or warmth—the more 
likely their children are to show signs of emotional distress 
(depression, fearfulness, and crying) and externally directed 
behaviors such as arguing, disobedience, destructiveness, 
and impulsiveness (McLeod & Shanahan, 1993; Conger 
et al., 2002; McLoyd & Smith, 2002).
Infants and toddlers whose home environments are charac-
terized by high levels of confl ict, anger, and aggression, and 
who are targets of harsh, cold, unsupportive, and neglectful 
environments are at great risk for disruptions in self-regulation. 
Early experiences of abuse produce repeated physiological 
responses of fear, anxiety, and stress. Over time, these stress 
responses result in greater fearfulness, dysregulation of the 
natural systems that are helpful in calming and controlling 
emotions, and difficulty regulating anxiety and depression. 
Emotional processing is also disrupted under conditions of 
harsh parenting. Toddlers have fewer chances to observe or 
model effective strategies for handling confl ict and are more 
likely to behave in aggressive ways with peers. The lack of 
social competence that is caused by harsh parenting is likely to 
result in peer rejection, weak social relationship skills, and low 
levels of social integration (Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002).
Individual Differences in the Ability to Control 
Impulses. The ability to delay gratifi cation varies with the 
individual. At least three factors are associated with differ-
ences in the ease or diffi culty that children have in control-
ling their impulses (see Figure 6.3). First, toddlers differ in 
their capacity to empathize with the distress of others. Empa-
thy itself appears to have a genetic as well as an environmen-
tal basis. In a study of identical and fraternal twins who were 
2 years old, the identical twins showed greater similarity in 
their emotional concern about and response to others’ dis-
tress than did the fraternal twins. Moreover, mothers who 
showed a stronger concern for others in their childrearing 
strategies had children whose empathy was more fully devel-
oped. Furthermore, girls were observed to be more empathic 
than boys (Zahn-Waxler, Robinson et al., 1992). Individual 
differences in sensitivity to the distress of others lead to dif-
ferences in how upset  children might be when their behav-
ior causes someone else’s suffering and in how willing the 
child may be to curb that behavior in the future.
Second, differences in temperament affect self-con-
trol. Children who are more aggressive, active, or socially

Developmental Tasks | 221
caregivers use talking about emotions to help young children 
gain impulse control. First, parents articulate the family or 
cultural rules of emotional expression: “Don’t get so excited; 
calm down!” or “Stop that fussing; big boys don’t whine 
and cry!” These lessons give young children an idea about 
the acceptable levels of impulses or emotional intensity and 
about the types of emotions that need to be regulated.
Second, adults help modify the intensity of emotions 
through reassuring or distracting talk. They may try to dis-
tract a child who is worried about getting an injection, or try 
to convince the child that the shot won’t hurt or that it will be 
just a little sting. They may try to comfort a sobbing child by 
talking about some happy event that will distract the child.
Third, adults give children ideas for ways to manage their 
impulses. They might help by suggesting that the child think 
of pleasant times from the past or by singing a cheerful song. 
Adults teach children superstitions, rituals, and stories about 
how people handle their strong feelings.
Fourth, children listen to and imitate adults who talk 
about their own strong emotions and impulses. Toddlers who 
can talk to themselves may be able to control their fears, mod-
ify their anger, and soften their disappointments. They may 
repeat their parents’ comforting words, or they may develop 
their own verbal strategies for reducing pain and suffering.
The development of symbolic fantasy allows children to 
create imaginary situations in which disturbing problems 
can be expressed and resolved. Through fantasy play, tod-
dlers can control situations that are far beyond their real-
world capacities (Singer & Singer, 1990). They can punish 
and forgive, harm and heal, fear and conquer fear—all 
within the boundaries of their own imagination. Children 
can use the context of pretense to manage strong feelings and 
to preserve their emotional control (Galyer & Evans, 2001). 
When Robbie feels bad about something, he says, “Superhe-
roes don’t cry.” He is making use of fantasy and language to 
control his emotional state. When children are asked to resist 
temptation, they use a variety of verbal strategies, including 
talking quietly to themselves and singing songs to distract 
themselves (Mischel, Shoda, & Rodriguez, 1989).
Self-Regulated Goal Attainment
The second sense in which self-control develops has to do 
with toddlers’ feelings that they can direct their own behav-
ior and the behavior of others to achieve intended outcomes 
(Messer, Rachford, McCarthy, & Yarrow, 1987). During 
infancy, children become increasingly aware of themselves 
as causal agents. They make things happen. In toddlerhood, 
children become much more assertive about their desire to 
initiate actions, persist in activities, and determine when 
these activities should stop.
Benjamin at 27 months, 17 days:
When I put him to bed tonight he bellowed at the top of his 
lungs for a good fi ve minutes from sheer rage that I wouldn’t 
let him get down on the fl oor and go on playing with his 
car. What he wants and doesn’t want he can be very noisy 
deliberately guide their attention away from tempting objects 
that they are not allowed to touch (Li-Grining, 2007).
Since the early 1960s, Walter Mischel and his colleagues 
have investigated the process by which children delay grati-
fi cation. To delay gratifi cation, a child must exert willpower 
in order to resist a strong immediate pull or temptation. This 
requires shifting attention or distancing oneself from the 
immediate situation and redirecting attention or action in 
order to achieve a different goal (Mischel & Ayduk, 2002). 
For example, when they were at the zoo, Kelly asked for ice 
cream. Her mother said she could either have ice cream now 
or go to McDonalds for dinner when they left the zoo. Kelly 
agreed to wait and go to McDonalds. At age 4, children who 
delay gratifi cation longer tend to be more intelligent, more 
likely to resist temptation, demonstrate greater social respon-
sibility, and have higher achievement strivings.
According to Mischel’s research, a 4-year-old’s ability to use 
self-regulatory strategies to delay gratifi cation has enduring 
effects. More than 10 years later, children who had waited lon-
ger in an experimental situation that required a self-imposed 
delay of gratifi cation at age 4 were described by their parents 
as socially and academically more competent than their peers. 
Their parents rated these children as more verbally fl uent and 
able to express ideas, using and responding to reason, and 
more competent and skillful. These children were more atten-
tive and able to concentrate, plan, and think ahead, and they 
were also seen as better able to cope with frustration and resist 
temptation (Mischel et al., 1989; Morf & Mischel, 2002).
Other longitudinal studies have supported the strong link 
between early evidence of self-control and subsequent socializa-
tion. Children who are able to regulate their emotional reactions 
and resist temptations in toddlerhood are less likely to violate 
parental rules, they are more likely to plan as they approach new 
tasks, and as a result, they are more likely to be successful in 
school settings where cooperation and compliance are highly 
valued (Rothbart, Ahadi, & Evans, 2000; Tangney, Baumeister, 
& Boone, 2004). A growing body of research supports the rela-
tionship of children’s self-regulatory competence and many posi-
tive outcomes, including: better scholastic performance; more 
successful social functioning; and fewer behavior problems. By 
adolescence, self-control is a better predictor of academic per-
formance than IQ (Eisenberg, Fabes, Guthrie, & Reiser, 2002; 
Duckworth & Seligman, 2005). Children who are able to resist 
temptations are demonstrating that they can outwit their desires, 
using a variety of strategies to achieve longer-term goals that may 
be in confl ict with immediate pleasure.
The Role of Language and Fantasy in Impulse Control. 
Language and fantasy are children’s most useful tools for 
managing impulses. Talking about feelings and needs enables 
adults to help children understand more about their emo-
tions and to devise strategies for self-regulation. Although we 
tend to think of self-control as internally initiated and man-
aged, there are many social prompts that foster self-control 
and help children manage their impulses (Fitzsimons & 
Finkel, 2010). Thompson (1990) identifi ed four ways that

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
can hear them or understand them. He described the talk as 
egocentric because it did not seem to have any social inten-
tion. Piaget suggested that the development of communica-
tion began with inner thinking of a very private, nonsocialized 
nature. In toddlerhood, he viewed egocentric speech as evi-
dence of the relative absence of social life and the great extent 
of nonsocialized thoughts that the child is unable to express.
Vygotsky (1987) proposed a completely different devel-
opmental pathway to account for egocentric speech and its 
function. He represented the scheme as follows:
Social speech → egocentric speech → inner speech
Vygotsky viewed speech as beginning in the social interactions 
between children and adults or other children. In his view, the 
fi rst and foremost function of speech is social. Egocentric speech 
is a transformation of this social speech inward. The child uses 
speech, initially acquired through interactions with others, to 
guide behaviors. It does not have a social intention; rather, it is a 
tool for problem solving. Vygotsky viewed egocentric speech and 
actions as part of the same problem-solving function. The more 
diffi cult the problem, the more speech is necessary for the child 
to fi nd a solution. “Children solve practical tasks with the help of 
their speech, as well as their eyes and hands” (Vygotsky, 1978a, 
p. 26). Eventually, the egocentric speech of an audible nature 
dwindles (but does not disappear entirely) and becomes inner 
speech.
The kind of speech that guides problem solving emerges 
from the social speech that characterizes children’s interac-
tions with adults and eventually becomes inner speech. 
Often, when young children try to figure out how to work 
something or how to get something that is out of reach, they 
turn to adults for help. Vygotsky suggested that the kind of 
talk that adults use as they guide young children is then used 
by the children themselves to support and guide their own 
behavior. He referred to this process as the internalization of 
social speech. In a sense, a child’s capacity for self-directed 
goal attainment depends on what the child has taken in of 
the spoken, practical advice and guidance given by adults and 
older peers who have tried to help the child solve problems 
in the past. In adulthood, these speech-like cognitions are not 
typically audible; they are experienced as inner talk, or self-
talk, that help organize complex tasks (e.g., fi rst make an out-
line), encourage persistence (e.g., concentrate, stay focused), or 
review and revise (e.g., doesn’t fi t, try the bigger one).
Inner speech gives children a new degree of freedom, fl ex-
ibility, and control in approaching tasks and working toward 
a goal. They can use words to call to mind tools that are not 
visible. They can plan steps toward a goal and repeat them to 
guide their actions. They can use words like slowly, be careful, 
or hold tight to control their behavior as they work on a task. 
Language skills and self-control operate together to help 
children inhibit negative emotions and disruptive behavior 
during times of frustration (Lynam & Henry, 2001).
We have considered two rather different phenomena under 
the developmental task of self-control. Children’s ability to 
about—but he can also obviously be rather confused as to 
what he does want.…This is especially true in the afternoon 
after his nap. He may wake up demanding a ride or a walk. 
By the time he gets downstairs, it has switched to “Want to 
pway bwocks.” (Church, 1966, p. 157)
Toddlers’ sense of agency—their view of themselves as 
the originators of action—expands to include a broad array 
of behaviors. Children want to participate in decisions about 
bedtime, the clothes they wear, the kinds of foods they eat, and 
family activities. They want to do things they see their parents 
and older siblings doing. Their confi dence in their own abil-
ity to handle very diffi cult tasks is not modifi ed by a realistic 
assessment of their own skills. According to toddlers, “Any-
thing you can do, I can do better.” When they have opportu-
nities to do some of these new and complex things and they 
succeed, they gain confi dence in themselves and their abilities. 
Toddlers feel themselves to be valuable members of the family 
as they contribute to routine household tasks. Their feelings of 
confi dence and value are matched by the acquisition of a wide 
variety of complex, coordinated skills.
The Role of Language in Self-Directed Goal Attain-
ment. Toddlers use what was described by Piaget (1952) 
as egocentric speech to accompany their behavior. They talk 
aloud, but do not seem to be concerned about whether anyone 
In toddlerhood, children develop new skills for self-reliance.

or with peers, and sleeping apart from parents. The exact list 
of expectations and the age at which these behaviors are to be 
accomplished varies from one society to the next. Within U.S. 
society, pressures for autonomy are often expressed in early 
expectations for skill acquisition and verbal expressiveness. 
Children do not just prefer to do most things on their own, 
they insist on it. Once children begin to work on a task, such 
as putting on pajamas or tying shoelaces, they will struggle 
along, time after time, until they have mastered it. They may 
adamantly reject help and insist that they can manage on their 
own. They will allow someone else to help them only when 
they are sure that they can progress no further by themselves.
In many non-Western cultures, interdependence rather than 
independence is the valued goal of socialization. Children 
are likely to experience pressures toward autonomy with the 
birth of a sibling. Rather than pressing for separateness and 
distance from the caregiver, toddlers may hover near their 
mother, distressed at her new lack of availability. Through 
guidance from older siblings and peers, young children learn 
to participate in the ongoing activities of the household, 
watching intently, imitating others, and contributing as they 
can to daily tasks. Within this cultural context, expectations 
for autonomy may emphasize the ability to demand less of 
the mother, to become sensitive to the needs of others, and to 
function cooperatively with peers (Harkness & Super, 1995; 
Edwards & Liu, 2002).
The establishment of a sense of autonomy requires not only 
tremendous effort by the child but also extreme patience and 
support from parents. Toddlers’ demands for autonomy are 
often exasperating. They challenge their parents’ good sense, 
goodwill, and good intentions. Parents must learn to teach, 
cajole, absorb insults, wait, and praise. Sometimes, they must 
allow their children to try things that the children may not be 
able to do. By encouraging their children to engage in new 
tasks, parents hope to promote their sense of competence.
In the development of autonomy, toddlers shift from a 
somewhat rigid, nay-saying, ritualized, unreasonable style to 
an independent, energetic, persistent one (Erikson, 1963). The 
behavior of older toddlers is characterized by the phrase “I can 
do it myself.” They are less concerned about doing things their 
own way and more concerned with doing them on their own. 
Toddlers demonstrate an increasing variety of skills. Each new 
accomplishment gives them great pride. When doing things 
independently leads to positive results, the sense of auton-
omy grows. Toddlers begin to create an image of themselves 
as people who can manage situations competently and who 
can satisfy many of their own needs. Children who have been 
allowed to experience autonomy should, by the end of 
toddlerhood, have a strong foundation of self-confi dence and 
feelings of delight in behaving independently.
Shame and Doubt
Some children fail to emerge from toddlerhood with a sense 
of mastery. Because of their failure at most attempted tasks 
or because of continual discouragement and criticism from 
control their impulses is closely linked to the psychoanalytic 
concept of delay of gratifi cation, as Freud (1905/1953) used it 
to describe development during the oral and anal stages. Self-
directed goal attainment, sometimes referred to as agency, is a 
general motivation that accounts for children’s efforts to increase 
their competence through persistent investigation and skillful 
problem solving (White, 1960; Harter, 1982). Both abilities fos-
ter toddlers’ growing awareness of themselves. To function effec-
tively as family members, toddlers must feel confi dent in their 
ability to control the inner world of their feelings and impulses 
and the outer world of decisions and tasks. As toddlers discover 
that they can tolerate stress, express or withhold their anger as 
appropriate, and approach diffi cult tasks and succeed at them, 
they also lay claim to a growing defi nition of selfhood.
Toddlerhood is an important time in the development of a 
person’s sense of self-effi cacy—the conviction that one can per-
form the behaviors demanded by a specifi c situation (Bandura, 
2000). The more toddlers can do by themselves, the more con-
fi dence they will have in their ability to control the outcomes 
of their actions and achieve their goals. Over time, the sense 
of self-control that is formed during toddlerhood is integrated 
into adult capacities to overcome obstacles to achieve impor-
tant goals and to engage in acts of generosity and kindness even 
when these acts confl ict with their own immediate needs.
The Psychosocial Crisis: 
Autonomy versus Shame 
and Doubt
Objective 5. To analyze the psychosocial crisis of 
autonomy versus shame and doubt, to clarify the central 
process of imitation, and to describe the prime adaptive 
ego strength of will and the core pathology of compulsion.
During toddlerhood, children become aware of their sep-
arateness. Through a variety of experiences, they discover 
that their parents do not always know what they want and 
do not always understand their feelings. In early toddler-
hood, children use rather primitive devices to explore their 
independence. They may say “no” to everything offered to 
them, whether they want it or not. This is the period that 
people often refer to as the terrible twos. Toddlers seem very 
demanding and insist on having things done their own way.
Autonomy
The positive pole of the psychosocial crisis of toddlerhood 
is autonomy. During this period of life, autonomy refers to 
the ability to behave independently—to perform actions on 
one’s own. In most cultures, expectations for autonomy are 
expressed as encouragement for children to perform daily 
tasks, such as dressing and feeding themselves, playing alone

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
EVERY HUMAN CULTURE has some 
mechanism to remove waste products 
from close proximity to the social 
group. The effort to teach children 
how to dispose of human waste in a 
culturally appropriate fashion is the 
focus of what we in the United States 
refer to as toilet training or potty 
training. Any approach to this task 
refl ects a combination of technology, 
beliefs, and practices. One of the 
basic issues is whether one believes 
that the regulation of this training 
should be left to the child, drawing on 
a sense of developmental readiness, 
or left in the hands of the trainers, 
which usually suggests a training 
program (Valsiner, 2000).
In Freud’s psychoanalytic 
theory, toilet training symbolized 
the classic psychological confl ict 
between individual autonomy and 
social demands for conformity. In 
this particular confl ict, children are 
destined to lose (White, 1960). They 
must subordinate their autonomy to 
expectations for a specifi c routine 
regarding elimination. In the United 
States, the contemporary approach 
to this dichotomy between autonomy 
and conformity is advocated by the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
(1999). Their advice about toilet 
training combines waiting until the 
child is ready with introducing toileting 
in a guided, systematic fashion:
Autonomy/Readiness: Chances are, toilet 
training won’t be very successful until 
your child is past the extreme negativism 
and resistance to it that occurs in early 
toddlerhood. He must want to take this 
major step. He’ll be ready when he seems 
eager to please and imitate you, but also 
wants to become more independent. 
Most children reach this stage sometime 
between 18 and 24 months, but it is also 
normal for it to occur a little later.
Conformity/Training: The best way to 
introduce your toddler to the concept of 
using the toilet is to let him watch other 
family members of his sex.…For the fi rst 
few weeks, let him sit on the potty fully 
clothed while you tell him about the toi-
let, what it’s for, and when to use it. Once 
he sits on it willingly, let him try it with 
his diaper off. Show him how to keep his 
feet planted solidly on the fl oor, since 
this will be important when he’s having a 
bowel movement. Make the potty part 
of his routine, gradually increasing from 
once to several times each day.
The experts suggest starting with 
bowel training, and then moving on 
to urinating in the potty by allowing 
the child to play near the potty, 
dropping the contents of the dirty

Toilet Training
parents, or most likely because of both, some children 
develop an overwhelming sense of shame and self-doubt. 
This is the negative resolution of the psychosocial crisis of 
toddlerhood (Erikson, 1963). Shame is an intense negative 
emotion that focuses on a negative evaluation of the self. 
Often it is accompanied by a sense of having been exposed 
or ridiculed and made to feel inferior to others. Feelings of 
shame do not have to occur in the presence of an audience; 
however, they usually involve at least an imagined notion of 
how one’s behavior might look to others (Tangney, 2001).
One source of shame is social ridicule or criticism. You 
can probably recall feelings of shame for having had some 
kind of accident—you spilled your milk or wet the bed or 
got dirt on your new outfi t. Early experiences of shaming 
are often linked to toilet training (see the box entitled “Toi-
let Training”). Shame generally originates in an interpersonal 
interaction in which a child is made to feel embarrassed or 
ridiculed for behaving in a stupid, thoughtless, or clumsy 
way (Tangney, Wagner, Fletcher, & Gramzow, 1992). Under 
these circumstances, the child may have acted without con-
sidering the consequences, or was unable to control his or 
her actions. The negative reaction by others accompanies 
feelings of helplessness. When you are shamed, you feel 
small, ridiculed, and humiliated. Some cultures rely heav-
ily on shame coupled with opportunities for restitution as 
a means of social control. Children in these cultures grow 
up with a strong concern about how their behaviors might 
refl ect on their family or result in disrupting the social bond 
with their community. One of their greatest fears is to be 
publicly accused of immoral or dishonorable actions that 
would bring disgrace to their family (Scheff, 2003).
The quality of early attachment relationships can also con-
tribute to experiences of shame. Attachment theory suggests 
that in the process of ongoing interactions between infants 
and their caregivers, children form an internal working 
model of self and other. If the child’s working model of the 
parent is rejecting, indifferent, or unpredictable, this is likely 
to be linked to a sense of the self as unworthy or unlovable.

diaper in the potty so the child sees 
the connection, reminding the child 
to use the potty when needed, but 
not to show disappointment when 
he or she misses or forgets. Patience, 
reassurance, and praise are suggested 
while the caregiver encourages 
increasing compliance with toileting 
practices.
This approach, which you may fi nd 
extremely sensible and right, can be 
contrasted with the practices of the 
Digo, a group living in coastal Kenya 
and Tanzania. The Digo live in huts 
with mud fl oors. The smell of urine 
mixed with the mud is extremely 
unpleasant and diffi cult to remove. 
So the Digo are eager to have their 
infants urinate out of the hut as early 
as possible. Training begins at 2 to 3 
weeks of age. The caregiver sits on 
the ground outside the hut with feet 
outstretched and places the baby in 
the appropriate position for urinating. 
The baby is placed on the caregiver’s 
feet, facing away from the caregiver 
but supported by the caregiver. While 
in this position, the caregiver makes a 
low sound (“shuus”), which serves as 
a conditioned stimulus for urination. 
This is repeated frequently, day and 
night, until the baby urinates in this 
position following the sound. When 
this happens, the baby is rewarded 
with breastfeeding. By the age of 4 
to 5 months, Digo babies are trained 
to urinate only in the culturally 
approved position and setting (De 
Vries & De Vries, 1977). In contrast 
to the recommendations of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, this 
approach places a strong emphasis 
on training and shows a perception 
of readiness that is much earlier than 
the perception of readiness held in 
the United States and other Western 
cultures.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Given what you have read about 
toddlerhood, including physical, 
cognitive, language, and emo-
tional development, how do 
you think toilet training should 
occur?
 2. How is toilet training related to the 
themes of autonomy versus shame 
and doubt?
 3. What is the role of self-control, 
including self-regulation and 
self-directed goal attainment in 
toilet training?
 4. How are cultural beliefs and goals 
expressed in the toilet training 
process? What cultural beliefs do 
you think are conveyed though 
the advice given by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics?
 5. Toilet training is one area in which 
toddlers may experience strong 
feelings of shame and doubt that 
are a result of how they are treated 
by adult caregivers. Why is it so 
diffi cult for adults to deal calmly 
with toileting processes? How 
would you help adults overcome 
their strong emotional reactions to 
toileting in order to support their 
child’s successful mastery of toilet-
ing behavior?
 6. Toilet training takes place over a 
fairly long period. Once you have 
introduced the process and the 
child has experienced some suc-
cess, there will be times when the 
child does not make it to the bath-
room on time. What is the best way 
to respond when a child has acci-
dents in order to continue effective 
and successful toilet training?
In toddlerhood, the child’s representations of self and other 
become more readily observable in the way they talk about 
themselves, and in their fantasy play. Children whose earlier 
attachments were insecure are more likely to form a negative 
representation of the self, including expressing anger, blame, 
or shame about their actions or feelings (Toth, Rogosch, 
Sturge-Apple, & Cicchetti, 2009).
As children construct an idea of what it means to be a 
good, decent, capable person, they build a mental image of an 
ideal person. Children feel shame when their behavior does 
not meet the standards of their ideal, even though they have 
not broken a rule or done anything naughty. In general, shame 
is associated with feelings that the whole self is bad or worth-
less. It makes one want to disappear from the eyes of others.
Shame is extremely unpleasant. In order to avoid it, chil-
dren may refrain from all kinds of new activities. Children who 
feel shame lack confi dence in their abilities and expect to fail 
at what they do. The acquisition of new skills becomes slow 
and painful when feelings of self-confidence and worth are 
replaced by constant doubt. Children who have a pervasive 
sense of doubt feel comfortable only in highly structured and 
familiar situations, in which the risk of failure is minimal. As 
college students, young people who have high levels of shame 
were also characterized by high levels of resentment, irritability, 
anger, suspiciousness, and a tendency to blame others (Lewis, 
1987; Kaufman, 1989). Intense feelings of shame do not gener-
ally result in restitution or prosocial behavior. Rather, shame 
often motivates denial, defensiveness, anger, and aggression 
(Tangney & Dearing, 2002; Tangney & Mashek, 2004).
All children experience some failures amid their many suc-
cesses. In the process of achieving a new level of separateness, 
children may discover that they have harmed a loved one, bro-
ken a treasured toy, or wandered too far away and become sep-
arated from the caregiver at a crowded store or an unfamiliar 
park. Toddlers often exhibit periods of ambivalent dependency 
alternating with what appears to be unrealistic self-assurance as 
they try to establish a comfortable level of individuation from 
the loved one. The successful outcome to this process requires

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
Jess liked to imitate adult tasks. When his mother cleaned 
the house, he followed her with a cloth, trying to dust the ta-
bles. When Mark (Jess’s older brother) fed the dog, Jess helped 
him by getting the dog’s dish. When his father shaved in the 
morning, Jess took a toothbrush to imitate his father with 
lathering and shaving motions. He was learning to brush his 
teeth, even though his span of attention was short at this job 
and the cleansing ineffective. (Brazelton, 1974, pp. 139–140)
Imitation is also a means of participating in and sustaining 
social interactions and advancing social cognition (Meltzoff, 
2002). In a peer setting, imitation emerges as a dominant strat-
egy for children to coordinate their behaviors with those of other 
toddlers. Before verbal communication becomes a truly use-
ful tool for establishing or maintaining social contact, toddlers 
imitate one another. Through imitation, toddlers can feel con-
nected to one another and begin to invent coordinated games. 
With increasing cognitive maturity, children select imitation 
behaviors that have relevance to their own needs for mastery, 
nurturance, and social interaction. Imitation advances empathy. 
By watching and repeating the actions of others, toddlers begin 
to gain insight into the other person’s experiences and emotional 
state (Rogers & Williams, 2006). Imitation can also be a way to 
reestablish a sense of belonging after experiences of exclusion or 
rejection. By mimicking others, especially those the child wants 
to be connected to, the child increases the target’s feelings of lik-
ing, closeness, and trust (Lakin, Chartrand, & Arkin, 2008).
The emphasis on imitation highlights the central role of 
culture at this period of life. In many cultures, adults orient 
young children toward important tasks and expect them to 
watch and learn in a process of imitation and shared problem 
solving (Rogoff, Mistry, Goncu, & Mosier, 1993). Children 
are surrounded by daily events that provide models for imita-
tion, which refl ect the culture of their families and commu-
nities. Toddlers rapidly accumulate the vocabulary of speech 
and action that belongs to their cultural group. How visitors 
are greeted when they arrive at the home; how adults groom 
themselves, dress, and speak to one another; how household 
tasks and chores are performed; how older children amuse 
themselves; how young people and older people treat each 
other—the thousands of words, gestures, and rituals of daily 
life make up the culture absorbed by watchful toddlers as they 
arm themselves with the resources to press toward autonomy.
Given its pervasive role in the early development of children, 
it is not surprising to learn that imitation is supported by spe-
cifi c neural mechanisms. Recent research has identifi ed a mirror 
neuron system, which underlies a person’s ability to observe 
and then recreate the actions of others as well as to understand 
the emotions and intentions of others (Iacoboni & Dapretto, 
2006). The mirror neuron system in humans is a coordinated 
network of three areas: One area gathers visual information; one 
recognizes and processes the motor components of the visual 
information; and one processes the goal of the action. Informa-
tion from the goal-oriented area is sent back through the sys-
tem to match up with the original visual information to guide 
motor behavior. The system supports sensory and motor inte-
gration while the person is observing others, imitating others, 
fl exibility and warmth on the part of caregivers who accept and 
welcome the emerging selfhood of their child while building 
support for appropriate levels of self-control.
The Central Process: Imitation
The primary mechanism by which toddlers emerge as autono-
mous individuals is imitation. Imitation is one of the most 
widely used and effi cient mechanisms for learning. Along with 
teaching and practice, imitation is one of the basic mechanisms 
that support cultural transmission over generations. Children 
observe their more skillful parents, siblings, and peers. Each suc-
cessive generation benefi ts from observing the skilled behaviors 
of the previous generation (Caldwell & Millen, 2009). Imitation 
plays a role in skill learning as well as in social cognition, allow-
ing one person to observe and reproduce the actions, expres-
sions, and gestures of others. Although imitation requires the 
presence of active models, its outcome is a shift of the action 
from the model to the imitator. In other words, once toddlers 
succeed in imitating a certain skill, that skill belongs to them, 
and they can use it for any purpose they like.
Toddlers seem driven to imitate almost everything they 
observe, including their parents’ positions at the toilet. Tod-
dlers’ vocabularies expand markedly through their imitation of 
the words they hear in adult conversations, on television, and 
in stories. Their interest in dancing, music, and other activities 
stems from imitation of parents and peers. When one child in a 
play group makes a funny noise or performs a daring act, other 
children seem compelled to recreate this novel behavior.
The imitative behavior of toddlers is different from the socially 
induced conformity observed in older children. Toddlers are 
not aware of a great many social norms, and therefore feel little 
pressure to conform to them. Their imitative behavior is really a 
vehicle for learning. Every act becomes their own, even if it has 
been inspired by others. The primary motivation for imitation 
during toddlerhood is the drive for mastery and competence.
Through imitation, toddlers participate in and sustain social 
interactions. Lacey helps her mom with her stretching exercises 
and gets a good workout herself.

that permits a person to set goals freely and make persistent 
efforts to achieve them. It refl ects the positive connotation of 
the term willpower, the ability to sustain effort and delay gratifi -
cation in order to achieve a long-term goal (Mischel & Ayduk, 
2004). Will leads to a positive belief in oneself as someone 
who can make things happen. When you see a child strug-
gling to carry a heavy box or drag a wagon fi lled with toys up 
a steep hill, you see will in action. When you watch an older 
child chew and twist a pencil trying to fi gure out a tough math 
problem, you see will in action. And when you go to the high 
school swimming pool at 6 o’clock in the morning and see 
students working out or swimming laps to get ready for an 
upcoming meet, you see will in action.
Compulsion
Will provides a voluntary energy and focus to action. In 
contrast, compulsions are repetitive behaviors that are moti-
vated by impulse or by restrictions on the expression of it. 
They are nonspontaneous and unchanging. Compulsions 
are a close relative to the ritualization that is developed in 
toddlerhood. Children at this stage typically devise some 
well-ordered rituals, especially around important transi-
tions such as going to bed, getting dressed, and leaving the 
house. They insist that these rituals be followed precisely 
and threaten to become extremely angry if the rituals are 
violated. Rituals represent efforts to bring control and order 
to the environment. They are often associated with fears, 
such as fear of strangers or separation from loved ones for 
and being imitated by others. These neurons show activity dur-
ing observation, and even greater activity while one performs 
an action that was observed when watching others—in other 
words, when one is imitating something one is watching. The 
mirror neurons are sensitive to the intention of the action as 
well as to the actions themselves. For example, a different pat-
tern of neural fi ring in the mirror neuron system is observed 
when a grasping action is linked to drinking from a cup and 
when grasping is linked to taking the cup away from the table to 
clean up. The mirror neuron system is considered to be a key to 
clarifying empathy and our ability to understand others through 
imitation of facial expressions, body posture, and gestures. Dis-
ruptions of the mirror neuron system may be implicated in the 
social defi cits associated with autism (Gallese, 2006).
The Prime Adaptive Ego 
Quality and the Core 
Pathology
As a result of the resolution of the psychosocial crisis of 
autonomy versus shame and doubt, toddlers emerge from this 
period of life with the prime adaptive ego quality of will or the 
core pathology of compulsion. The ego quality of will provides 
a sense of being in control of one’s thoughts and actions. It is 
vital to emerging capacities for self-expression, self-direction, 
and eventually self-fulfi llment. In contrast, the core pathol-
ogy of compulsion refl ects pervasive anxiety. Thoughts impose 
themselves; actions must be carried out over and over. The will 
is taken hostage by unbidden impulses that must be satisfi ed.
Will
Erikson et al. (1986) identifi ed the prime adaptive ego quality 
that emerges through the successful resolution of the psycho-
social crisis of toddlerhood as will—the capacity of the mind 
to direct and control action. It is closely linked to the idea of 
self-directed goal attainment. Will is the inner voice, focus-
ing attention, encouraging, and urging one on, especially in 
the face of obstacles. It provides the psychological energy that 
allows people to press harder in competition, work to surpass 
previous achievements, and reach for new goals. In the face of 
disability, it is the force that urges the person to make peace 
with the loss and focus on alternate goals. In the face of crisis, 
people often refer to their will to survive or their will to live as 
the fundamental strength that kept them looking for new solu-
tions or that prevented them from giving up hope. In older 
people who experience potentially spirit-crushing, painful 
losses or disabilities, will is the force that provides buoyancy 
as they learn to accept their decline, look for areas of contin-
ued mastery, and refl ect nostalgically on past achievements.
Sometimes, we think of will in a negative way, as associated 
with stubbornness or overbearing dominance, that is, bending 
to someone’s will. But the meaning of will in the psychosocial 
context refers to the sense of inner determination and purpose

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
brain abnormalities in an area known as the striatum. In rare 
instances, OCD can be brought about as a result of a strep 
infection, when the immune system attacks an area of the 
brain in its efforts to fi ght off the infection (U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services, 1999).
In a sense, people who suffer from obsessions and com-
pulsions have a damaged will. Their ability to willfully direct 
their thoughts and actions toward a goal is impaired. Rather, 
they feel that their thoughts and actions are being controlled 
by some powerful force outside their voluntary control. It is 
not the same as a hallucination. People with compulsions or 
obsessions do not think that someone from outer space or 
some voice from the spirit world is telling them what to do. 
They recognize the directive as coming from their mind, but 
not from their will.
Compulsions represent the ego’s attempts to provide some 
structure to reality, but they do not work to promote fur-
ther development because they are not meaningful (Erikson, 
1982). The experience of the doubt-filled, shame-ridden 
person tends to be continuously unpleasant, uncertain, and 
sometimes tortuous. Life is enacted around carefully orches-
trated patterns of meaningless, compulsive behaviors.
The Impact of Poverty 
on Psychosocial Development 
in Toddlerhood
Objective 6. To conceptualize the impact of poverty on 
development in toddlerhood.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 20% of 
U.S. children under the age of 5 (4.2 million children) were 
living in families with incomes under the poverty level in 
2007. This means that, if they lived in a three-person family, 
the family’s annual income was $16,705 or less. In fact, this 
is much less than it costs to meet basic needs for housing, 
food, transportation, health care, and child care expenses. 
The United States has the dubious distinction of the high-
est child poverty rate among 17 developed countries, with 
more than 13 million children suffering from food insecurity. 
These children do not consistently have access to food and 
may have to eat substandard food, inadequate meals, skip 
meals, or get their food from food pantries and shelters (Lott 
& Bullock, 2001; Children’s Defense Fund, 2005).
Poverty is often associated with conditions that are dis-
ruptive to optimal development, including poor nutrition, 
inadequate health care, limited parental education, lack of 
stimulating parent-child interactions, and harsh punishment 
(Ramey, Campbell, & Ramey, 1999; Bradley & Corwin, 2002). 
In the fi rst years of life, the rapid growth and interdependence 
among cognitive, social, and physical domains mean that sig-
nifi cant modifi cations in any one system can have a substan-
tial impact on the others. Early malnutrition, iron defi ciency, 
younger children, or fears of environmental threats such as 
burglars or illness in somewhat older children (Evans, Gray, 
& Leckman, 1999). Rituals help provide feelings of same-
ness and continuity during changes in setting or state that 
may threaten toddler’s feelings of selfhood.
Benjamin at 27 months, 17 days:
His bedtime rituals are changing but still evident. He must 
be read to—as many books as the reader will stand for—
and his music-box must be wound up. And I don’t think 
he knows it’s even possible to sleep any way except on the 
stomach. But he doesn’t ask for his three old favorite stories 
to be told to him any more (thank heaven) and he doesn’t 
always ask to be sung to—sometimes he wants one of three 
or four particular songs, but by no means always. (Church, 
1966, p. 159)
Toddlers’ rituals usually do not repeat adult ways of doing 
things; thus, they are not mere imitations of adult rituals. 
Their rituals, however, like those of adults, serve the impor-
tant psychological function of bringing order and a sense of 
mastery to the unknown or the unpredictable. This in turn 
provides a feeling of security as toddlers pursue well-learned 
behaviors that work and may also have private symbolic 
meaning. In comparison to adaptive rituals that actually pro-
vide a sense of comfort and relief from uncertainty, compul-
sions must be carried out again and again, never adequately 
resolving the anxiety that motivates them.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a clinical diag-
nosis that has been increasingly observed among children and 
adolescents. Obsessions are persistent, repetitive thoughts that 
serve as mechanisms for binding anxiety. Compulsions are 
repetitive, ritualized actions that serve the same function. Bind-
ing anxiety occurs when the person feels that the thoughts or 
behaviors reduce some other source of distress. For instance, a 
person with a compulsive neurosis may become committed to 
repeated handwashing to rid the self of uncleanness. The com-
pulsive handwasher “scrubs his hands in tortured solitude, 
until they become raw, and yet he never feels clean” (Erikson, 
1977, p. 78). Over time, a neurosis may become very disrup-
tive to daily life because it takes a lot of time, makes it hard 
to concentrate on tasks, and the person feels a loss of control.
Cases of OCD have been documented as young as 4 
years of age. The pattern of symptoms observed in children 
and adolescents tends to differ from the pattern observed 
in adults, and among children the number and sever-
ity of symptoms can be quite diverse. Common groups of 
OCD symptoms among children include: (1) mental ritu-
als, touching and ordering, (2) contamination and cleaning, 
(3) superstitions, (4) obsessions/checking and confessing, 
and (5) somatic concerns (Ivarsson & Valderhaug, 2006). 
One case study described a child who had obsessive fears of 
choking on a big object at age 4 and needed repeated reas-
surances that this would not happen. By age 9, the child 
was diagnosed with OCD (Geffken, Sajid, & MacNaughton, 
2005). There is evidence that OCD is associated with unique

1997). A combination of factors tied to family poverty, 
including exposure to harsh parenting, disruptions in emo-
tional regulation, and the absence of positive interactions 
with adults, results in a lack of school readiness and a trajec-
tory of lower academic motivation and subsequent disengage-
ment from school. In a long-term analysis of the relationship 
between early poverty and adult outcomes, a clear link was 
found between exposure to poverty in the fi rst 5 years of life, 
and reduced income and hours of work after age 25 (Duncan, 
Ziol-Guest, & Kalil, 2010).   
In a worldwide analysis of the developmental potential 
of children under the age of 5, Sally Grantham-McGregor 
and her colleagues estimated that over 200 million children 
are exposed to such extreme conditions of poverty, malnu-
trition, and neglectful care that they are at critical risk for 
disrupted developmental outcomes (Grantham-McGregor 
et al., 2007). Poverty for these children is associated with 
inadequate food supplies, poor sanitation, increased infec-
tions and illness, and growth retardation. The mothers of 
these children have had limited education, and the home 
environment is barren and unstimulating. Poor families are 
more likely to live in high-risk neighborhoods, where chil-
dren are likely to be exposed to chaotic conditions, includ-
ing disruptions in basic services such as water or electricity, 
violence, and family instability (Ceballo & McLoyd, 2002; 
Evans et al., 2005). Schools are inadequate, and there is rel-
atively little encouragement for education. As a result, the 
children who live in extreme poverty will attend fewer years 
of school, and have less earning potential as adults. As they 
enter adulthood, they will have more children than adults 
who had more years of education, and be less able to provide 
the educational or economic resources for their children that 
will support optimal growth in the next generation. Invest-
ment in the nurturance, safety, education, health, and nutri-
tion of young children worldwide is critical in order to alter 
the trajectory of an intergenerational pattern of lost develop-
mental potential.
exposure to environmental toxins such as lead, lack of ade-
quate stimulation, and exposure to harsh or neglectful parent-
ing can all impact brain development, including reactivity to 
stress, ability to regulate anxiety, executive control, memory, 
and attention (Rodier, 2004). Many children from low-income 
families have no regular source of health care and have not 
been immunized for measles and other infectious diseases. 
Repeated bouts of illness combined with poor nutrition 
detract from a child’s energy. The combination of malnutri-
tion and illness has multiple consequences, including the pos-
sibility of structural brain damage, lethargy, delayed physical 
growth, and, as a result, minimal exploration of the environ-
ment. All these factors taken together produce what has been 
observed as delayed psychomotor and cognitive development 
in toddlerhood (Pollitt, 1994; Brown & Pollitt, 1996). Poor 
health in childhood has a lasting impact on adult health (Hal-
fon, Inkelas, & Hochstein, 2000).
Families in poverty are a diverse group, characterized by 
a range of conditions that could present challenges to opti-
mal development. For example, young mothers whose edu-
cation is disrupted by early childbearing, and mothers who 
are suffering from depression, are likely to also have reduced 
fi nancial resources. However, educational level and depres-
sion are associated with different consequences for children. 
Mothers’ educational attainment is strongly associated with 
their children’s vocabulary and school achievement. Among 
low-income families, children whose mothers have had 
fewer years of school have lower levels of school readiness 
and do worse on standard measures of academic achieve-
ment. Maternal depression is a different risk factor, associ-
ated with the child’s social skills. Children whose mothers 
are depressed are less cooperative, less compliant, and show 
more evidence of oppositional or defi ant behaviors in pre-
school (Perry & Fantuzzo, 2010).
Early exposure to poverty has lasting consequences for 
adult outcomes, especially outcomes related to academic 
achievement and cognitive abilities (Duncan & Brooks-Gunn,

Left to wait for his mother on a street corner 
in New Delhi, this child comes into contact 
with trash, pollutants, glass, dirty water, and

exposure to poverty in toddlerhood has 
cumulative effects that increase lifelong risks 
of illness, impaired cognitive development, 
passivity, and mistrust.

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
Table 6.3 summarizes the child care arrangements for chil-
dren under 6 who have not yet entered kindergarten (U.S. 
Department of Education, 2005). In 2005, 74% of children 
were involved in some type of nonparental care. This is an 
increase from 69% in 1991. The largest group, 57.2%, was 
in center-based care, which includes day care centers, Head 
Start programs, preschool, prekindergarten, and other early 
childhood programs. Arrangements vary by the child’s age, 
the family’s race/ethnicity, and household income. Three-year-
olds are more likely than 4- or 5-year-olds to be cared for by 
their parents. White, non-Hispanic families are more likely to 
arrange for nonrelative care than other racial/ethnic groups. 
Hispanic families are more likely to rely on parental care than 
other racial/ethnic groups. African American families are more 
likely than other racial/ethnic groups to use center-based care. 
Households with higher incomes ($75,000 or more) are more 
likely to make some type of nonparental arrangement for their 
children and are the most likely to use center-based programs.
Child care settings refl ect a variety of philosophies about 
the care of young children, wide differences in curricu-
lum, and a wide range of physical settings. The laissez-faire

topic of child care, emphasizing the impact of the kind 
of care and the quality of care on development during

EVERY PERSON WHO expects to combine parenting and 
employment or schooling must give some thought to how to 
provide child care. In the United States, child care arrange-
ments constitute a highly diverse market, especially when 
compared with kindergarten through 12th-grade public edu-
cation (Holloway & Fuller, 1992). Child care in the United 
States is covered by minimal federal and state regulations. 
Thus, children are in the care of a wide range of caregivers 
with varying types of education and training, from no spe-
cifi c background and training at all to bachelor’s and master’s 
degrees.

diffi culties even when the settings are of good quality (Mor-
rissey, 2009). The quality of care a child experiences can be 
assessed, but the many factors that might account for why 
some children are in high-quality care and others are in poor-
quality care, or why some children are in care for many hours 
a day and others are in care for few hours a day cannot be fully 
measured or controlled. As a result, it is best to think of stud-
ies that evaluate the impact of early child care arrangements as 
associational rather than causal.
The Impact of Child Care 
on Intelligence, Cognition, 
Academic Achievement
Results of a growing body of research suggest that the effect of 
quality day care on toddlers’ cognitive development is positive 
but modest (Azar, 1997; Ludwig & Phillips, 2007). Data from 
model programs show that quality child care contributes to 
intellectual achievement, as refl ected in higher IQ scores, both 
during the preschool years and during the fi rst grade (Burchinal 
et al., 2000). Because of the questionable validity of IQ scores 
for very young children and for children from various racial and 
ethnic subgroups, the focus on IQ as an indication of program 
impact may be inadequate. Thus, recent studies have focused 
on more specifi c competencies such as language ability, pre-
reading and prewriting skills, vocabulary, cognitive problem 
solving, and motivation for school and school achievement as 
evidence of the long-term impact of child care on intellectual 
development (Yoshikawa, 2005).
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Devel-
opment (NICHD) has been conducting a longitudinal study of 
the effects of early child care (Owen, 1997; National Institutes 
of Health, 2000). The primary aim of the study is to learn 
what impact child care has on developmental outcomes above 
and beyond the infl uence of family and home environment. 
In this study, 1,300 children under 1 month of age and their 
families were identifi ed as participants from 10 sites across the 
United States. The study, initiated in 1991, has now followed 
children into early adolescence, ages 14 and 15. Families var-
ied by race, income, family structure, mother’s education and 
employment status, and the number of hours children spent 
in nonparental care. The kinds of care included: care provided 
by grandparents and other relatives; by a nonrelative in the 
home; in a home-based setting; and in a center. The quality 
of care was measured with a focus on caregiver interactions 
that are expected to promote positive emotions, social compe-
tence, and cognitive and language skills.
Positive caregiving is measured by observing and docu-
menting the frequency of interaction, and then rating the 
quality of the interaction. The child care settings were also 
measured both in terms of their regulable characteristics, or 
guidelines recommended by governments, such as group size, 
child to adult ratio, and physical environment; and of the care-
giver’s characteristics, such as formal education, specialized 
training, child care experience, and beliefs about child rearing.
approach to the care of toddlers seems to refl ect a cultural 
belief that the nurturance and socialization of young chil-
dren are primarily the responsibility of the family, whereas 
the schooling of children over the age of 5 is a public con-
cern. However, most early childhood experts agree that there 
are markers of quality care that have an impact on children’s 
daily experiences as well as on their long-term cognitive, 
emotional, and social development. These markers include 
advanced training in the fi eld of child development and early 
childhood education for the caregivers; a small caregiver-to-
child ratio and smaller group size; a safe, clean environment; 
and sensitive, developmentally appropriate interactions 
between caregivers and children (Honig, 2002).
Because of the growing national need for child care and 
the wide choice of child care arrangements, parents, educa-
tors, and policymakers are asking such critical questions as, 
“How does child care infl uence the development of young 
children? What is our obligation to ensure quality child care 
for the children of working parents? What is our obligation 
as a society to meet the health, nutrition, and safety needs of 
the children of poor parents?”
Assessments of child care’s effects on young children gen-
erally focus on intellectual abilities, socioemotional develop-
ment, and peer relations. Research has tended to emphasize 
the impact of child care on the children of families living in 
poverty, because they are at a higher risk for school failure, 
illiteracy, and subsequent minimal employment or unemploy-
ment, even though they are less likely to be enrolled in center-
based care than families with more resources. Many studies 
focus on Head Start—a federally funded early childhood pro-
gram that has a complex mission, including education, health, 
mental health, and family support. However, until recently, 
Head Start was structured as a preschool enrichment program 
rather than full day care. Not all child care programs have the 
same educational emphasis or developmental curriculum as 
Head Start. Many studies that investigate the impact of child 
care do not systematically control for the differences in pro-
gram focus, services, and hours of service that exist among 
public and private child care and preschool programs.
Efforts to assess the impact of early child care arrange-
ments on subsequent development are often discussed as 
causal relationships (e.g., participation in quality early child 
care results in cognitive benefi ts). However, these causal state-
ments should be treated cautiously. Very few studies randomly 
assign children to early childhood programs. Even in a recent 
study where children were randomly assigned to Head Start 
programs or to a non–Head Start control group, some of the 
children who were assigned to Head Start did not enroll, and 
some who were assigned to the control group managed to get 
into a Head Start program on their own (Puma et al., 2005). 
About 15% of young children experience a combination of 
care arrangements including parental and family member 
care as well as center-based and nonrelative care, and these 
arrangements may change from year to year. Experiences with 
multiple care arrangements, and frequent changes in arrange-
ments, have been found to be associated with behavioral

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
about the tradeoff in costs and benefi ts of providing early 
educational experiences to children at risk of school failure 
(Ludwig & Phillips, 2007).
The Perry Preschool Project, a model program that has 
carried out extensive longitudinal research on its partici-
pants, has seen a number of indications of academic success. 
In the mid-1960s, 123 African American children from very-
low-income families were selected to participate in this pro-
gram. They were randomly assigned to a quality preschool 
intervention or to no preschool. At age 19, children who had 
attended a quality preschool program had higher grades, 
fewer failing grades, a more positive attitude toward school, 
and a higher literacy rate than a comparable group of young 
adults living in poverty who had not participated in a qual-
ity child care program (Schweinhart & Weikart, 1988; 
Schweinhart, Montie, Xiang, Barnett, Belfi eld, & Nores, 2005). 
Most (95%) of those who had participated in the study were 
reinterviewed at age 27. The group that had the preschool 
experience continued to show evidence of the benefits of 
their early childhood education. Those who had attended 
the quality preschool were 30% more likely to have gradu-
ated from high school or received their GED. They were 4 
times more likely to be earning $2,000 or more per month, 
and three times more likely to own their own homes (High/
Scope, 2003).
The Impact of Child Care 
on Social Competence
Quality care is also associated with higher levels of social 
competence, self-esteem, and empathy. Children who inter-
act positively with adults in their day care settings are more 
likely to continue to interact positively and comfortably 
with their teachers and classmates in the elementary grades 
( Vandell, Henderson, & Wilson, 1988). Some studies have 
found that children with more hours of child care experi-
ence are less compliant with their parents’ wishes than chil-
dren who have not been in day care. The study conducted 
by NICHD helps explain these fi ndings. The more time chil-
dren spent in nonmaternal care, the less responsive mothers 
were to their children at ages 15 and 36 months, and the less 
affectionate the child was to the mother at 24 and 36 months 
(Owen, 1997; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 
2002). These fi ndings were strongest for children who were 
in low-quality care for the longest time periods. Even when 
children were adolescents, the consequences of experiences 
in poor quality care and long hours of care continued to be 
observed. By age 15, the more hours a child spent in non-
family care as a toddler, the more they were observed to 
have diffi culties controlling their impulses as an adolescent 
( Vandell et al., 2010).
Recent studies suggest that some children are more 
affected by the quality of their early child care experi-
ences than others (Pluess & Belsky, 2010). Children who 
were characterized as having a difficult temperament in 
The research team found that child care situations with 
safer, cleaner, more stimulating physical environments and 
smaller group sizes, lower child/adult ratios, and caregiv-
ers who allowed children to express their feelings and took 
their views into account, also had caregivers who were ob-
served to provide more sensitive, responsive, and cogni-
tively stimulating care—quality of care that was expected 
to be associated with better developmental outcomes for 
children. (Retrieved July 29, 2001, from www.nichd.nih
.gov/publications /pubs /early_child_care.htm)
For more detailed information about this national longitudi-
nal study, visit the NICHD website at http://secc.rti.org.
Findings from this research suggest that family variables 
were more important predictors of the child’s development 
than the quality of child care in infancy, toddlerhood, and 
even in middle school. “Higher levels of parenting qual-
ity predicted greater levels of tested reading, math, and 
vocabulary achievement in fifth grade, and lower levels 
of teacher-rated externalizing problems and confl ict and 
high levels of social skills, social-emotional functioning, 
and work habits in the sixth grade” (Belsky et al., 2007, 
p. 693). However, after all these family factors were taken 
into account, the quality of language stimulation directed 
to the child in the child care setting made a significant 
additional contribution to children’s language and cogni-
tive competence measured at ages 2 and 3 (NICHD Early 
Child Care Research Network, 2002). Children in higher 
quality care had higher scores on measures of infant devel-
opment and school readiness. After controlling for quality 
of child care settings, the research found that children who 
did not attend any type of formal child care and were cared 
for at home performed just as well as those who attended 
quality care programs. Those who were cared for in family 
day care in their infancy performed better at age 3 than did 
those in other types of nonfamily care (National Institutes 
of Health, 2000).
Follow-up studies have found indications of long-term 
consequences of exposure to early child care. By the sixth 
grade, a positive relationship was observed between experi-
ences in quality care and measured vocabulary (Belsky et al., 
2007). By age 15, there was continued evidence of a benefi t 
to high-quality care as measured in adolescents’ academic 
performance (Vandell et al., 2010).
 Focusing on children from low-income families, expe-
riences in high-quality child care offset the negative asso-
ciations between poverty and subsequent math and reading 
skills. For children from low-income families, high- quality 
child care proved to be a benefit with regard to school 
readiness at age 3, which was then strongly associated with 
higher scores in measures of math, reading, applied prob-
lem solving, and language skills in grades 5 and 6 (Dearing, 
 McCartney, & Taylor, 2009).
In addition to test score benefi ts, children who have par-
ticipated in model programs and Head Start are less likely to 
be placed in special education classrooms or to be held back 
a grade. These advantages are of significance in thinking 

 
Child Care | 233
Howes, 2003). Long-term benefi ts for peer relations were 
observed for the participants of the Perry Preschool Project 
when, at age 19, they were more likely to report that they 
provided help to their friends and family than were com-
parison participants, but less likely to volunteer without 
pay for community service (Schweinhart & Weikart, 1988; 
Schweinhart et al., 2005).
Few of the evaluations of model programs or Head Start 
have addressed long-term social consequences. However, 
results from the Perry Preschool Project showed that by 
age 19, fewer of the children studied had committed delin-
quent acts or had been processed by the courts, fewer had 
been on welfare, and more had been employed (Barnett, 
1996). In the follow-up at age 27, those who had been 
enrolled in the quality preschool program were less likely 
to have been arrested for drug dealing, men had been mar-
ried longer, and women were more likely to be married 
and less likely to have had a child out of wedlock (High/
Scope, 2003).
Benefi ts Associated with 
Head Start
Head Start is more comprehensive than most preschool or 
child care programs. As a result, it has the potential for a 
broader range of benefits to children and families than 
other programs. The Head Start program standards include 
requirements for the staff to provide children and families 
with comprehensive services related to health and nutri-
tion. Staff must assist parents in using available resources 
for immunization; regular checkups; screening for health, 
vision, and behavioral problems; and regular preventive 
dental care (U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, 2002). In 
30 studies that reported on the health impact of Head Start, 
infancy, especially high levels of negativity and irritability at 
6 months, were compared to children who were character-
ized as low in negativity at 6 months. In 6th grade, these 
two groups of children were rated by teachers on behav-
ior problems and teacher-child confl icts. For the children 
who had low levels of negativity, there was no relationship 
between their experiences in high- or low-quality child care 
and the way teachers rated their behavior in 6th grade. For 
the children who had high levels of negativity as infants, 
the experiences in high- or low-quality child care made a 
big difference. If these children who had a more diffi cult 
temperament also experienced low-quality child care in 
toddlerhood, they had many more behavior problems and 
teacher-child confl icts. If the children who had a more dif-
fi cult temperament were in high-quality child care, they had 
fewer behavior problems and teacher confl icts than the low-
negative children, even those who had been in high-quality 
care. The point is that when evaluating the long-term con-
sequences of early child care experiences, it is important to 
take into account variations in children’s susceptibility to 
environmental conditions.
Quality child care also has an impact on peer relations. 
Children benefi t from opportunities to interact with a variety 
of peers in settings where adults are readily available to help 
them make choices and resolve differences. The quality and 
complexity of social play are especially enhanced when chil-
dren remain in the same child care setting rather than mov-
ing from one arrangement to another. In stable conditions, 
toddlers, whose verbal skills are limited, expand their strate-
gies for coordinating their play with others and for exploring 
shared fantasies. Children who are growing up in diffi cult 
and impoverished life circumstances are especially likely to 
benefi t from stable, consistent caregiving practices, where 
they can form a secure attachment to the caregivers and 
experience calm, friendly interactions with peers (Ritchie & 
Toddlers’ social competence is enhanced in qual-
ity child care settings through daily opportunities 
for sharing, taking turns, helping, and coordinating 
their play with others.

CHAPTER 6 Toddlerhood (Ages 2 and 3)
the data showed that participating children are more likely 
to get a wide variety of examinations and assessments cover-
ing medical and dental health, speech and hearing, vision, 
and nutrition. Because Head Start provides meals, young 
children in the program have a much higher daily nutritional 
intake than similar children who are not in the program 
(Zigler & Styfco, 2004). All of these opportunities allow a 
direct response to young children’s physical needs when 
their parents may not be aware of emerging problems or are 
unsure how to address them.
Head Start’s overall impact on the health of young chil-
dren is 6 times greater than the average effect of schooling 
on health found across hundreds of studies (Grott & van 
den Brink, 2005). Thus, Head Start succeeds in bringing to 
young children essential benefi ts that they are not receiving 
through their families or other school settings.
As an additional benefi t, Head Start has had a positive 
impact on families and communities. A key area of Head 
Start programming is parent education and parent involve-
ment. Results of the national Head Start Impact Study 
show that parents whose children are in Head Start are 
less likely to spank their children, and spend more time 
reading to their children, than parents whose children 
are in other kinds of child care programs (Puma et al., 
2005). Head Start has provided education, training, and 
career development for millions of parents and commu-
nity members. It has mobilized over a million community 
volunteers to assist in Head Start classrooms, and most of 
these volunteers were once Head Start or Early Head Start 
parents. Head Start has created hundreds of thousands of 
jobs, the majority of which are held by people who live 
in the low-resource communities where the programs are 
located. Thus, Head Start contributes to the advancement 
and engagement of community adults, drawing on their 
talents to contribute to the quality of education in their 
 communities (NHSA.org, 2007).
Recent changes in professional standards for Head 
Start teachers have included expectations for a bachelor’s 
degree. In our experience in Rhode Island, this has led to 
a new relationship between Head Start and the University 
of Rhode Island in order to facilitate attainment of bach-
elors’ degrees in child development for many Head Start 
teachers. As part of this program, Head Start is providing 
some tuition assistance, classroom space, and resources 
for study. Thus, through its commitment to improve the 
quality of the teaching staff, Head Start is building a pool 
of college-educated early childhood professionals in a 
population that might otherwise never complete a college 
degree.
Directions for the Future of Child 
Care in the United States
The United States faces a critical gap between the demand 
for affordable, quality child care and its availability. 
Although the number of child care settings appears to be 
ample, those that meet the standards of high quality are 
comparatively scarce. In a study conducted by the U.S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission, 220 licensed child 
care settings were evaluated for the presence of possible 
safety hazards. The safety hazards monitored in this study 
included: unsafe cribs, soft crib bedding, improper play-
ground surfacing, poorly maintained playground surfacing, 
absence of child safety gates at the top of stairs, loops hang-
ing from the window blind cords, drawstrings around the 
necks in children’s clothing, and recalled children’s prod-
ucts. The study reported that two-thirds of the settings 
showed at least one of these hazards (Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, 1999).
Concern about the need for affordable, quality child 
care is expressed by parents who are in the labor market as 
well as by those who would like to be in the labor market. 
The United States now has a national parental-leave policy, 
so that parents can take time off to care for their newborns 
without risking the loss of their jobs. But concerns about 
child care continue throughout toddlerhood and well into 
the elementary school years, when children need adult 
companionship and supervision before and after school 
hours. Services for certain groups, including children with 
disabilities, those whose parents have evening work sched-
ules, children who are ill, and those who need year-round 
programs, are in short supply. Furthermore, the supply 
of quality centers is unevenly distributed, so that many 
families in low-income communities do not have access to 
quality care (Fuller, Kagan, Caspary, & Gauthier, 2002).
Changes in national welfare policies place new pressures 
on the need for affordable, quality child care services. In 
the past, for example, Head Start programs, which have 
been an important resource to children in low-income 
families, have not offered full day care. However, because 
mothers of young children who were previously receiving 
welfare benefi ts are required to enter the labor market, they 
need to fi nd full day care for their children. Consider the 
dilemma of a woman who was trying to locate quality care 
for her child:
I called child care agencies. . . . And I interviewed all the 
people they [the state] gave me with licenses. I sat in some 
of the places for quite a while. I saw drugs being sold in and 
out of those places. I found one place I thought my daughter 
would be secure. She was sexually abused. I think that was 
the thing that really gave it to me then: I quit my job and 
went fully back on the welfare system. (Scarbrough, 2001, 
p. 267)
Quality, affordable child care is one of the primary 
resources that single parents rely on in order to stay off wel-
fare. Without some form of child care subsidy, women can-
not support themselves and their families on what they are 
typically able to earn in jobs that pay a minimum wage. Even 
with such a subsidy, the likelihood of fi nding a high-quality 
setting are low, and the risks of spending time in a poor-
quality setting are great.

 
Chapter Summary | 235
Objective 1. To describe the expansion of motor skills 
during toddlerhood, indicating their importance for 
the child’s capacity to explore the environment and to 
experience opportunities mastery.
The developmental tasks of toddlerhood support children’s 
ability to express themselves through action, language, fan-
tasy, and self-directed goal attainment. Locomotive skills 
heighten toddlers’ sense of mastery and expand their bound-
aries of experience. Advanced motor skills highlight the 
dynamic interaction of brain development, physical growth, 
opportunity, and practice.
Objective 2. To document accomplishments in 
language development and to describe the infl uence 
of experiences for learning to communicate.
Language is both a tool for the expression of feelings and 
concepts and a primary mechanism of socialization. Com-
municative competence relies on both genetically based 
capacities for symbolic representation and exposure to a lan-
guage system. Certain language skills are more vulnerable to 
the timing of exposure than others, illustrating an important 
feature of plasticity. Toddlers’ use of language gives us clues 
as to their cognitive development and their needs. Through 
language, children infl uence others, gain access to worlds 
of information, and learn new strategies for the control and 
expression of their impulses.
Objective 3. To describe the development of fantasy 
play and its importance for cognitive and social 
development.
The emergence of fantasy provides toddlers with an internal, 
personal form of symbolic representation. Fantasy allows a 
pseudomastery in which barriers are overcome and the limita-
tions of reality are less important. Confl icts can be acted out, 
and pretend solutions can be found. Fantasy may be enhanced 
by language, but it thrives even in the absence of words.
Objective 4. To examine the development of self-control, 
especially impulse management and goal attainment, 
highlighting strategies young children use to help 
regulate their actions.
Efforts at self-control—both impulse regulation and self-
directed goal attainment—begin in toddlerhood and 
continue through life. Temperamental differences in nega-
tive emotionality, anger-proneness, fearfulness, and activ-
ity level can all influence the child’s ability to achieve 
self-control. At the same time, these differences are shaped 
by parenting practices that help or disrupt children’s capaci-
ties for regulation.
Objective 5. To analyze the psychosocial crisis of 
autonomy versus shame and doubt, to clarify the central 
process of imitation, and to describe the prime adaptive 
ego strength of will and the core pathology of compulsion.
The psychosocial crisis of autonomy versus shame and doubt 
reflects the child’s needs for self-expression and mastery. 
Young children develop individuality by exercising the skills 
that develop during toddlerhood. Self-doubts result from 
repeated ridicule, shame, and failure. The adaptive ego qual-
ity of will, directly linked to self-directed goal attainment, 
emerges in a positive resolution of this crisis. In the context 
of shame and doubt, the child is likely to rely more and more 
on compulsive, ritualized behaviors.
Autonomy and individuation are given different values 
across cultures. Within the context of parent-child rela-
tionships, children learn in what ways they are expected to 
become self-suffi cient and self-expressive, and to what extent 
they are expected to fi t in or blend in with others. Toddlers 
are avid observers, imitating and incorporating parental 
behaviors and values into their own routines. Parental inter-
action, acceptance, and discipline all contribute to a child’s 
emerging sense of individuality and connection.
Objective 6. To conceptualize the impact of poverty on 
development in toddlerhood.
Living in poverty begins to pose challenges to optimal devel-
opment during the prenatal period, and these risks continue 
throughout toddlerhood. Poor nutrition, lack of health care, 
harsh or neglectful parenting, and exposure to chaotic neigh-
borhoods can all infl uence the direction of cognitive devel-
opment, emotional regulation, and sense of control. Growing 
up in a very poor community increases the likelihood that 
parents will be psychologically unavailable or will use harsh, 
restrictive disciplinary strategies that produce shame or 
unexpressed rage in their young children.
Objective 7. To apply a psychosocial analysis to the 
topic of child care, emphasizing the impact of the kind 
of care and the quality of care on development during 
toddlerhood.
Increasing numbers of young children are being cared for in 
group settings. The impact of child care depends largely on 
the quality of the personnel, the nature of the program, and 
an appropriate physical environment. The most important 
predictor of children’s social and cognitive maturation is the

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
THE PERIOD OF early school age brings children face 
to face with new and complex socialization forces. By 
the age of 6, virtually all children in the United States 
are enrolled in school. Children today are encountering 
school or school-like experiences at earlier ages than in 
the past. In 2007, 65% of 3- to 5-year-olds were enrolled 
in public or private pre-primary schools, not including 
the 5-year-olds who were enrolled in kindergarten. This 
is an increase from 37% in 1970 (U.S. Census Bureau, 
2010). It is normative for children to be enrolled in some 
type of schooling before the age that the law requires. 
School brings new information and experiences, new 
opportunities for success and failure, and new settings 
for peer group formation. School is a new source of 
infl uence on the child beyond the family. Beliefs and 
practices followed at home may come under scrutiny 
and be challenged by teachers or classmates. Parents’ 
personal hopes and aspirations for their children may 
be tempered by the reality of their children’s school 
performance.
Most early-school-age children exhibit wide-ranging 
curiosity about all facets of life. “How does this work?” 
“Why is that the rule?” “Why can’t I do that?” The child’s 
self-concept is transformed in coordination with expo-
sure to new socialization voices. In addition to family and 
school, the peer group, neighborhood, and television all 
infl uence children’s self-concept during early school age. 
Once children become aware of alternatives to their own 
families’ rules and patterns, they begin to question familiar 
notions. The press toward independence of action seen in 
the toddler is now accompanied by a new independence 
of thought in the early-school-age child. ■

Chapter Objectives
Developmental Tasks
During the early-school-age period, between the ages of 4 
and 6, children are constructing a broad overview of how 
their interpersonal world is structured and where they fi t in. 
They are devising a scheme for self in society. Because chil-
dren’s life experiences are limited and they are still highly 
impressionable, the nature of this initial worldview is likely 
to be very compelling, permeating their outlook in the years 
ahead. The lessons from early childhood about what it 
means to be a good person, to be a good boy or girl, man or 
woman, to be cherished or despised are established at a deep 
emotional and cognitive level. These ideas are intertwined 
with feelings of being safe, loved, and admired or neglected, 
rejected, or abused. As a result, the basic beliefs about one-
self and others that are formed at this time are often diffi cult 
to review or revise.
In this chapter, four developmental tasks are discussed 
that contribute to the child’s capacity to construct a world-
view: gender identifi cation, moral development, self-theory, 
and peer play. The topic of gender identifi cation includes 
a discussion of the physical, cognitive, emotional, and social 
domains as they become integrated into an early scheme 
for thinking of oneself as male or female. Issues of right 
and wrong surface constantly as a result of the child’s newly 
acquired abilities for independent thought and exposure 
to a much wider range of social influences. These expe-
riences provide the basis for early moral development. 

 
Developmental Tasks | 241
In this and other discussions of gender identifi cation, you 
will want to differentiate among three concepts: sex, gender, 
and sexual orientation. Sex refers to a person’s biological 
maleness or femaleness determined by chromosomal infor-
mation. An infant’s external genitalia are typically used as the 
evidence to determine sex. In most cases, the chromosomes 
and the hormones that are produced in the prenatal period 
converge to produce an unambiguous sex. However, there 
are exceptions of chromosomally male (XY) individuals who 
have undeveloped male genitalia and are identifi ed as female 
at birth; and chromosomally female (XX) individuals who 
have hormonal imbalances that result in the appearance of 
male genitalia (Crooks & Bauer, 2005).
Gender refers to the integrated cognitive, social, emo-
tional, and behavioral patterns associated with being a boy 
or girl, man or woman in one’s culture. In childhood, gender 
identifi cation includes learning to identify oneself as a boy or 
girl in one’s family, friendship group, and community; learn-
ing and internalizing the community’s expectations for how 
boys and girls ought to behave; and sensing how well one 
meets the social expectations for a boy or girl.
Sexual orientation refers to one’s preference for and 
attraction to sexually intimate partners. Four sexual orienta-
tions discussed in the literature are heterosexual, homosexual, 
bisexual, and asexual. Sexual orientation is not a primary topic 
of discussion in this chapter. However, it is common for men 
and women who are homosexual to recall evidence of their 
gender nonconformity in early childhood, suggesting some 
childhood precursors of sexual orientation (Bailey & Zucker, 
1995; Zucker, Drummond, Bradley, & Peterson-Badali, 2009).
Understanding and experiencing the self expand markedly 
during early school age. This developmental task centers 
on the acquisition of a personal self-theory that becomes 
increasingly complex because it is being stimulated by 
expanding social infl uences. Accompanying the development 
of the self-theory is the development of a set of complex feel-
ings about the self called self-esteem. A fourth area involves 
new levels of participation in peer play. Through the process 
of learning the rules and playing cooperatively with others, 
children begin to form meaningful friendships and mental 
representations of ways of participating in groups.
Gender Identifi cation
Objective 1. To describe the process of gender identifi -
cation during early school age and its importance for the 
way a child interprets his or her experiences.
Every human society has patterns of organization based 
partially on gender. Male and female individuals are often 
assigned different roles, engage in different tasks, have 
access to different resources, and are viewed as having dif-
ferent powers and attributes. The specifi c content of these 
gender roles varies widely from one culture to another. As 
children form their concept of gender identity, they must 
integrate their own physical experiences, knowledge, and 
observations with the socialization messages coming to them 
from parents, siblings, peers, and other salient voices of the 
culture.
In early school age, children’s 
worlds expand as they spend 
more time at school and in their 
neighborhoods. Marta loves 
this time, hanging out with the 
big girls while she waits for the 
school bus to bring her home at 
the end of the day.

 2. What are the salient images of mother and father that Lee 
may have identifi ed with?
 3. What role might the rural, small-town environment have played 
in Lee’s experiences of gender identifi cation in early childhood?
 4. How much of Lee’s preference for rough-and-tumble play 
do you attribute to her desire to be “the son” for her 
father? How much do you attribute to her temperament 
and other aspects of her personality?
 5. From what you have read, and drawing on your own 
experiences, how might Lee’s gender identifi cation at this 
period of her life infl uence her later relationships with male 
and female peers, and her capacity to form intimate 
relationships in later adolescence or early adulthood?
A Framework for Thinking 
about Gender Identity
Our goal in the discussion that follows is to explore how 
young children begin to conceptualize gender as a dimension 
of their self-concept, an organizing principle of social life, 
and a guide to their behavior. We do not expect a lifetime’s 
work on gender identity to have been completed by 6 years 
of age. During this stage, however, signifi cant conceptual and 
emotional changes give gender greater clarity and highlight 
the relevance of one’s gender in a child’s overall self-concept. 
Gender is among the very early social categories that result 
in stereotyped thinking upon which children base inferences 
about others. The establishment of gender identity links a 
child to others of their same group (boys or girls), and infl u-
ences their interests, preferences, and social interactions 
(Ruble et al., 2004).
Biological factors including brain organization and phys-
ical capacities converge with socialization pressures and a 
child’s own understanding of the demands of the situation 
to create attractor states or experiences of positive, enjoy-
able action. So, in one culture, a 4-year-old girl may feel 
happy and competent when she is playing with a toy loom, 
learning to weave as her older sisters and her mother do; 
and in another culture a 4-year-old girl may feel happy 
and competent when she is playing pretend school with a 
friend. These gendered states are emotionally and behavior-
ally satisfying. They draw on cognitive and motor skills that 
are well developed for girls, and are socially encouraged by 
adults and peers in the community. As a result, there is a 
desire to replicate them. Over time, attractor states become 
increasingly more likely, and draw the child into a pattern 
of gendered interpersonal interactions, play, and learning 
activities. However, they are not fi xed. The girl who most 
enjoys playing pretend school with friends can engage in 
rough and tumble play if her male cousins come over for 
a visit or when her dad comes home from work. As in the 
case of Lee, a girl can experience rough and tumble play as 
the attractor state and still know that she is a girl. The pro-
cess of moving toward gendered action is revised whenever 
one or more of the constraints, including biological factors, 
socialization norms, and situational demands, are modifi ed.
CASE STUDY
GENDER IDENTIFICATION IN EARLY 
CHILDHOOD
Lee, a mother of six children, recalls with warmth and hu-
mor her early childhood years growing up in New Mexico 
in the 1920s and 1930s.
I was born in the southern part of New Mexico in 
Ruidoso. The town was up in the pines in the mountains 
and was mostly just a main street that followed the river. 
There was a meadow on one side of the river with a lot of 
Indian arrowheads and shards and the biggest grasshop-
pers in the world. I used to go catch grasshoppers and 
fi nd arrowheads, and my cousin Bob and I would wander 
around by ourselves.
My father was a carpenter and my mother had planned 
to be a nurse until she stopped and got married. I think my 
father must have really wanted a son because I was quite a 
tomboy and grew up as his only son. I helped him dig and 
move rocks instead of learning how to cook and sew. We 
had a large family, uncles and aunts and a grandmother 
and great aunt, with houses right next to each other and 
big, traditional holiday dinners with everybody there.
My cousin Bob was two years younger than I was and we 
were inseparable. . . . He was a rough, tough little kid. We 
ran around without coats in the winter and hardly ever got 
sick, and he and I grew up together. It was almost like two 
boys because we used to go to the river and fi sh with our 
hands and churn the fi sh over a little fi re and try to eat it. 
We just grew up like little wild things. My parents expected 
me to be on the premises by nightfall, but that was about it. 
We played cowboys and Indians with the other kids in the 
neighborhood, and we never played with girls at all; they 
were really something to be scorned. But he was allowed to 
cuss and have good tantrums that I wasn’t allowed to have.
My mother always provided books and she would tell 
stories about Huckleberry Finn. The river in our town was 
much too small for a raft; it was rocky and was just a stream, 
but we’d pretend rafts and imagine running away. One 
time I got tied up on an Indian raid and left there, and I was 
too stubborn to call for help, so I was there past supper 
time and my mother found me and brought me in. I was 
always tearing up my clothes, and my mother was always 
tearing me up about that. I think she would have liked to 
have a daughter. It wasn’t until my sister Barbara was born 
that she had a daughter. Barbara had long curls and was 
pretty feminine. That way mother had the daughter to play 
with and daddy had the son and everything was all right.

CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. What aspects of the formation of gender identifi cation are 
captured in this narrative?

conservation of matter, which will be discussed in Chapter 8 
(Middle Childhood).
The correct use of gender labels is the earliest compo-
nent of gender identifi cation to be achieved. The categori-
zation of people as male and female is a natural category, 
much like the distinction between the familiar person and 
the stranger or between people and inanimate objects, as 
discussed in Chapter 5. Even before the abstract categories 
male and female are understood, children learn to refer to 
themselves as boys or girls by imitating their parents. From 
infancy, parents make continual reference to a child’s gen-
der in such statements as “That’s a good boy” or “That’s a 
good girl.”
As early as 21 months, a majority of infants produce at 
least one gender label, such as boy or girl. By the age of 2½ 
children can accurately label other children as boys or girls, 
and by the age of 3, they can accurately sort photographs 
of boys and girls. They can also apply gender labels such as 
Mommy and Daddy, brother and sister, and boy and girl accu-
rately. These verbal labels become useful for guiding a child’s 
attention to important distinctions between males and females 
(Gelman, Taylor, & Nguyen, 2004; Baron, Dunham, Banaji, 
& Carey, 2007). Once they know these labels, children seek 
out cues to help them make these distinctions correctly, like 
hair style, clothes, or body shape. Their attention is directed 
to the differences between male and female individuals. Hav-
ing the words or labels for gender categories, the use of these 
words stimulates a child’s further conceptualization about the 
categories and their appropriate applications, resulting in new 
understandings about the nature of gender (Nelson, 2005; 
Waxman & Lidz, 2006). What is more, when infants begin 
to use gender labels, they are also observed to increase their 
gender-typed play, suggesting that the representation of oneself 
Our analysis of gender identifi cation focuses on four com-
ponents: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learn-
ing gender role standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying 
with parents, and (4) forming a gender preference.
As you read about gender identification, try to keep in 
mind that each child is actively working to make sense of 
gender in light of his or her body, unique talents, preferences, 
temperament, and the gendered behaviors of others. Children 
of this age are asking a lot of questions about reproductive and 
sexual topics, taking great interest in the nature of household 
and family roles, and trying to fi gure out how their status as a 
male or female fi ts in to their self-theory. The outcome of this 
work will be distinct and differ from child to child. Most of 
the literature on gender differences acknowledges that differ-
ences within groups of males or females are greater than the 
average differences between males and females (Hyde, 2005). 
We believe that these intragroup variations have their origin in 
the unique ways that boys and girls create personal represen-
tations of gender during the early-school-age period.
Understanding Gender
Understanding one’s gender involves four components that 
emerge in a developmental sequence from toddlerhood 
through early school age (Kohlberg, 1966; Martin, Ruble, & 
Szkrybalo, 2002): (1) applying the correct gender label to 
themselves and others, (2) understanding that gender is per-
manent, (3) understanding gender constancy, and (4) under-
standing the genital basis of gender (see Figure 7.1). According 
to this analysis, children construct the meaning of gender, 
including the stability and constancy of their own gender 
and the gendered nature of their society, in much the same 
way that they form other cognitive schemes such as object 
permanence, which was discussed in Chapter 5 (Infancy) or 
Bill is a boy;
Karen is a girl.
I am a boy now,
and when I grow
up I’ll be a man.
Even if I play with trucks
and wear overalls, I am
still a girl.
I am a boy because
of the way my body is
made; because I have
a penis and testes.

person? How would you expect the person to behave? Gender 
role standards tell us what the culture considers typical and 
admirable for girls and boys, men and women (Eagly, 2009). 
For young children, this usually means the kinds of toys, 
clothes, and activities that would be preferred by boys or girls.
In research on gender role standards, children are typi-
cally asked to identify whether certain activities, occupa-
tions, or traits are more frequently associated with male 
individuals, female individuals, or both. For example, in the 
Sex-Role Learning Index, children are shown drawings of 20 
objects traditionally associated with gender roles—10 for the 
male gender role (such as a hammer, a shovel, and a fi re hel-
met) and 10 for the female gender role (such as an iron, a 
stove, and dishes). By age 7, most children make a perfect 
score on this type of test, illustrating that they know how 
their society links a person’s sex to activities or occupations 
(Beere, 1990; Serbin et al., 1993; Levy, 1998). Knowledge of 
gender-typed personality traits, such as gentle and affection-
ate or adventurous and self-confi dent, emerges somewhat 
later. In one study of more than 550 children, sixth grad-
ers answered about 90% of these types of questions correctly 
(Serbin et al., 1993).
An early-school-age child’s knowledge about gender role 
standards shapes the child’s preferences and behaviors. For 
example, once children identify certain toys as more appro-
priate for girls and others as more appropriate for boys, 
their own toy preferences are guided by these standards. 
Conversely, when they like a toy that is not obviously sex-
stereotyped, they are inclined to think that other children of 
their sex would like that toy as well (Martin, Eisenbud, & 
Rose, 1995). One consequence of this gender-typed thinking 
is that it limits a child’s willingness to play with certain toys 
and games, and therefore reduces the child’s opportunities to 
learn from a variety of play experiences.
as a boy or a girl motivates and guides their gender-typed 
behaviors (Zosuls, Ruble, Tamis-Lemonda, Shrout, Bornstein, 
& Greulich, 2009).
Understanding gender permanence and constancy 
emerges somewhat later, usually between ages 4 and 7 
(Serbin, Powlishta, & Gulko, 1993; Levy, 1998). Perma-
nence refers to an appreciation that a boy grows up to be a 
man and a girl grows up to be a woman. One’s sex is perma-
nent over time, even though many things about one might 
change. Constancy refers to an appreciation that one’s sex 
is unchanged by clothing, hairstyle, play activities, and 
other day-to-day alterations. Even if a boy puts on a wig and 
dresses up in a fancy dress, he is still a boy. Even if a girl puts 
on a helmet and shoulder pads and pretends to be a football 
player, she is still a girl. Understanding the genital basis of 
gender provides a fundamental context for understanding 
that gender is permanent and constant. In research involv-
ing 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds, the majority of children who 
understood the genital differences between the sexes could 
also tell that a child’s sex did not change simply because the 
child was dressed up to look like a member of the opposite 
sex. These young children understood that sex is a constant 
feature of a person, no matter how the person is dressed or 
whether the hair is long or short. In contrast, the majority 
of the children who had no knowledge of genital differences 
were unable to respond correctly to questions about con-
stancy (Bem, 1989).
Gender Role Standards and Stereotypes
Gender role standards are cultural expectations about 
appropriate behavior for boys and girls and for men and 
women. One might consider these sex stereotypes. If you had 
no information about a person other than whether the person 
was male or female, what qualities would you attribute to that

Although early-school-age 
children are familiar with gender 
stereotypes, they are also likely 
to be fl exible in their gender 
role-play.

 
Developmental Tasks | 245
training in multiple classifi cation skills (sorting objects into 
more than one category) is associated with more egalitarian, 
less stereotyped responses to gender-related tasks (Bigler & 
Liben, 1992).
Variations in family environment and socialization 
influence children’s thinking about gender role norms. 
Girls are generally more fl exible about gender roles than 
boys. Young boys whose fathers live in the home typically 
have an earlier knowledge of gender-typed roles. How-
ever, if these fathers participate in nontraditional activities 
in the home, the boys’ gender role knowledge is delayed. 
Children whose mothers perform nontraditional tasks 
develop a more flexible attitude, seeing more activities 
and occupations as appropriate for both men and women 
(Serbin et al., 1993).
Identifi cation with Parents
The third component of gender identification involves 
parental identifi cation. Identifi cation is the process through 
which one person incorporates the values and beliefs of 
another. To identify with someone is not to become exactly 
identical to that person, but to increase one’s sense of alle-
giance and closeness with that person. Through the process 
of identifi cation, ideals, values, and standards of the family 
and community are internalized so that they become a part 
of the individual’s own belief system.
During early school age, most children admire and emu-
late their parents. Young children are avid observers of their 
parents as models, they are emotionally invested in their 
parents’ reactions to them, and they are eager to internal-
ize parental values. Young children integrate parental values 
and behaviors as part of their gender scheme. Children iden-
tify with both parents, not just with the parent of the same 
sex. However, same-sex parental identifi cation can provide 
important information for a child’s gender identity, including 
the tasks and roles that the parent enacts at home and in the 
community, the way to behave with members of the opposite 
sex, and traditional or fl exible views about gender.
Individual differences in children’s gender-typed prefer-
ences in toys and play activities as well as their gender role 
knowledge are linked to their parents’ attitudes and behav-
iors. Parents who have more traditional gender-typed attitudes 
tend to have children who are more stereotyped in their play 
preferences and whose knowledge of sex stereotypes develops 
at a younger age (Weinraub et al., 1984; Fagot & Leinbach, 
1989). Parents can make deliberate efforts to encourage more 
fl exibility in gender role conceptualization and preferences by 
deliberately modeling counterstereotyped activities—fathers 
making dinner or mothers mowing the lawn—and including 
more counterstereotypical comments in conversations with 
their children (Friedman, Leaper, & Bigler, 2007). Parents 
can also balance their children’s play activities so that both 
boys and girls have opportunities for independent play that 
does not require collaboration (e.g., playing with toy trucks 
and cars on a track) and opportunities for cooperative, social-
relational play (e.g., playing pretend school) (Leaper, 2000).
The nature of parental influences on children’s gender 
role stereotyping is very complex (Turner & Gervai, 1995). 
Some parents believe that boys should be assertive and fi ght 
for their rights. Others believe that boys should think care-
fully about what is right and wrong and guide their actions 
by reason rather than by impulsive aggression. Each of these 
sets of parents has a conception of male attributes that is 
communicated to their sons by a variety of means over a 
long period. The toys that parents give their children, the 
experiences to which they expose them, and the activities in 
which they encourage their children’s participation all refl ect 
dimensions of the parents’ gender role standards. By the time 
children reach school age, they have been encouraged to 
adopt those standards and disciplined for what their parents 
have viewed as gender-inappropriate behavior. Young girls 
may be shamed for their assertiveness by being told that they 
are acting bossy, and young boys may be warned to stop act-
ing like a sissy.
As the cognitive underpinnings related to the concept of 
gender mature, children form gender schemes, or personal 
theories about cultural expectations and stereotypes related 
to gender. Children look for clues about gender, seek-
ing information from their social environment about what 
activities they should or should not engage in (“Boys don’t 
dance,” “Girls don’t play with trucks”), whom they should 
play with, and what information is especially relevant for 
them as boys or girls. They use this information to organize 
their perceptions, focus their attention, and interpret infor-
mation in such a way as to be consistent with their gen-
der scheme (Levy, Barth, & Zimmerman, 1998; Martin & 
Ruble, 2004).
Gender schemes play a role in the recollection of behav-
ior (Bauer, 1993). By the kindergarten years, both boys and 
girls recall information that is consistent with their gender 
stereotypes better than information that is counter to the ste-
reotype or that is more relevant to the opposite sex (Liben & 
Signorella, 1993). Among children ages 5 to 12, those with 
more knowledge of gender role standards also have a stron-
ger preference for same-sex peers and for gender-typed adult 
activities and occupations (Serbin et al., 1993).
Not all children are equally rigid in applying gender role 
standards to themselves or to others. Flexibility in the appli-
cation of gender role standards to oneself and others appears 
to be infl uenced by both cognitive factors and socialization. 
Children learn the stereotypes and expectations related to 
their own gender before learning the expectations for the 
opposite gender (Martin, Wood, & Little, 1990). Preschool-
age children are likely to see gender role transgressions (e.g., 
boys playing with dolls or girls pretending to be fi refi ght-
ers) as more permissible than are older children, ages 6 and 
7 (Smetana, 1986; Lobel & Menashri, 1993). In particular, 
young children who have more advanced abilities to dif-
ferentiate between moral norms (e.g., telling the truth) and 
social norms (e.g., saying “please” and “thank you”) are 
also less stereotyped in their play activities and toy choices 
(Lobel & Menashri, 1993). Among 5- to 10-year-olds, 

246 | 
CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
and women, boys and girls ought to behave. Consider the 
following:
[A family] with three children (5-year-old Dan, 7-year-old 
Lyle, and 3.5-year-old Amy) in which the mother had al-
ways believed that her children should be exposed to all 
types of experiences, with no distinction indicated between 
“boy’s kind” and “girl’s kind.” She encouraged her older son’s 
play with dolls. . . . The boys were not allowed to play 
“aggressive” sports (American football) and were redirected 
by parents toward ballet and soccer. Yet the mother herself 
reported being “taken to the limits”:
. . . watching her [the mother] play with Amy, the mother 
was painting Amy’s fi ngernails, Dan asked his mother to 
paint his fi ngernails too. “I could only bring myself to paint 
two [nails]. I knew it was ridiculous, but it just bothered 
me.” (MacKain, 1987, p. 120)
This example illustrates how strongly internalized the 
standards about gender distinctions can be. Even for par-
ents who want to minimize gender distinctions, some 
Parents devise their beliefs and parenting practices 
out of their own internalized cultural script about gen-
der. So even if they endorse gender fl exibility, they may 
not be able to carry through entirely with their beliefs. 
For example, many studies focus on how parents talk to 
their children. The results of this work suggest that moth-
ers are generally both more supportive and more negative 
with their children—that is, more expressive—whereas 
fathers are more directive, or task oriented. Furthermore, 
daughters receive more verbal interaction than do sons, 
especially from mothers. Finally, fathers are more assertive 
than mothers, and children are more assertive with their 
mothers than with their fathers (Leaper, Anderson, & 
Sanders, 1998). Thus, the family environment is gendered 
through patterns of communication that give children dif-
ferent role models for the behavior of mothers and fathers 
and provide boys and girls with opportunities to develop 
different approaches to social interaction.
In addition to the enactment of scripts for how to inter-
act, most adults have deeply held standards about how men 
Children Raised 
by Gay or Lesbian 
Parents
A GROWING NUMBER of gay and lesbian 
couples are rearing children. In many 
cases, the children were conceived in 
heterosexual marriages. Then one parent 
established a lesbian or gay relationship 
and continued to raise the child. Some 
couples have children conceived through 
artifi cial insemination or other assisted 
reproductive technologies, and both 
lesbian and gay couples have assumed 
the parent role through adoption (Bailey, 
Bobrow, Wolfe, & Mikach, 1995; Flaks, 
Ficher, Masterpasqua, & Joseph, 1995). 
The emergence of this unique family 
structure provides an opportunity to 
better understand the process of gender 
role socialization and the development of 
sexual orientation. Many questions about 
child-rearing environments and child 
outcomes can be posed. Do parents who 
have a homosexual orientation differ from 
heterosexual parents in their parenting 
strategies or parental role behaviors? 
How relevant is a parent’s sexual 
orientation in shaping a child’s gender 
role identifi cation?
Over 20 years of research has 
addressed the adjustment and develop-
ment of children raised by gay and 
lesbian parents. Several studies have 
reported that when compared to 
heterosexual couples, lesbian couples 
exhibit more sensitive parenting and 
more egalitarian role relationships. Open 
disclosure of the lesbian relationship, 
the ability to maintain ties with the rest 
of the child’s family, and a perception 
that the partners share equally in the 
tasks associated with household and 
child care all contribute to the child’s 
emotional well-being (Patterson, 1995).
In general, studies of the well-
being, cognitive levels, and emotional 
adjustment of children growing up with 
lesbian mothers fi nd no differences 
between these children and those 
growing up in heterosexual families 
(Fitzgerald, 1999; Patterson, 2006). The 
children have gender role preferences 
that are very similar to those of children 
growing up in heterosexual families 
(Patterson, 2009). One study reviewed

nontraditional child care arrangements where fathers spent 
more time caring for their young children (Radin, 1993). 
Thus, based on findings from this research program, the 
impact of father involvement on gender identity was more 
evident as the children got older, rather than during early 
childhood.
The Applying Theory and Research to Life box discusses 
children raised by gay or lesbian parents. The research fi nds 
no differences in gender role behavior, gender identity, or 
emotional well-being between children raised by heterosex-
ual or homosexual parents.
Gender Preference
The fourth component of gender identifi cation is the devel-
opment of a personal preference for the kinds of activities 
and attitudes associated with masculine or feminine roles. 
Preferences for gender-typed play activities and same-sex 
play companions have been observed among preschoolers 
as well as older children (Hoffmann & Powlishta, 2001). 
Egan and Perry (2001) conceived of gender preference as a 
prohibitions or constraints are diffi cult to disregard (Valsiner, 
2000).
The contribution of parental identification to a child’s 
gender identity is not all that well understood (Fagot, 1995). 
On balance, mothers spend much more time than fathers in 
the care and rearing of young children. Thus, much of what 
children learn about the male role is likely to be interpreted 
through interactions with their mothers, and by watch-
ing their mothers and fathers, other male companions, or 
observing men on television. In a study of 3- to 6-year-olds 
in which the fathers were the primary caregivers, children 
had higher levels of a sense of internal control and scored 
higher on verbal ability than children in more traditional 
families. However, there were no differences in the chil-
dren’s gender identifi cation between traditional and father-
caregiver families (Radin, 1982, 1988). In a follow-up study, 
when the children were adolescents, the children who had 
experienced primary care by their fathers endorsed more 
nontraditional employment arrangements and role sharing 
by men and women. They also were more favorable about 
stigmatization, gender role behavior, 
behavioral adjustment, gender identity, 
and cognitive functioning. Not all 
studies measured all of these variables, 
and even when studies focused on 
common outcomes, they used a variety 
of methods to measure the same 
variables. The studies of children of 
gay fathers focused only on sexual 
preferences and stigmatization.
Despite the variations in approaches 
to sampling, measurement, and design, 
the studies reported quite similar results. 
Children of lesbian mothers did not 
differ from other children with respect 
to emotional or behavioral problems, 
gender identity, gender role behavior, 
or cognitive functioning. Children’s 
sexual preference was not related 
to their parents’ sexual orientation. 
There was some greater sensitivity 
to stigmatization among children of 
lesbian and gay parents, with children 
in some studies reporting being teased 
about being gay or lesbian. Also, 
children gave more thought to whom 
they would tell about their parents’ 
sexual orientation. However, these 
experiences were not associated with 
higher rates of emotional or behavioral 
diffi culties. The authors concluded 
that the research, with its many fl aws, 
provides a picture of basic similarity 
between children reared in gay or 
lesbian families and those reared by 
heterosexual families.
The results of this and subsequent 
research suggest that the sexual orien-
tation of parents is not a signifi cant 
predictor of a child’s gender identifi cation 
or of future sexual orientation (Herek, 
2006). Future research might focus more 
on the unique nature and experience of 
children growing up in gay and lesbian 
families, with a particular need to include 
more studies of gay fathers and their 
approaches to parenting. Rather than 
examining vulnerabilities or potential 
defi cits in comparison to children 
raised in heterosexual families, future 
research might shed new light on the 
approaches to gender socialization and 
the interpersonal worldview that emerge 
in this family form (Lambert, 2005).
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. The research discussed previously 
fi nds no systematic relationship be-
tween a child’s sexual orientation or 
gender identifi cation and the sexual 
orientation of the parents. How do 
you explain this null fi nding?
 2. If you were asked to design re-
search to study the child-rearing 
practices and gender socialization 
of gay and lesbian parents, what 
factors would you want to take into 
account? What would you measure? 
Who would be your comparison 
group? Why?
 3. What do you think might be some 
particular strengths of the parenting 
process for lesbian or gay parents? 
What might be some weaknesses? 
How might these strengths and 
weaknesses differ from those of 
heterosexual parents?
 4. Based on what you have read 
about gender identification, 
what role would you expect a 
parent’s sexual orientation to play 
in the way gender identification is 
formed?
 5. What do you think is the likely rela-
tionship between gender preference 
in childhood and gender preference 
in adolescence or adulthood? Per-
haps the association of a parent’s 
sexual orientation to a child’s gender 
identifi cation or sexual orientation is 
not observed in childhood, but might 
be observed in later adolescence 
or adulthood. What do you think of 
that idea?

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
his parents. In many Issei families, he was the second to be 
served at meals, after his father, and he was generally in-
dulged by his mother. . . . Younger siblings were instructed 
to obey his directions, and even older sisters were expected 
to defer to him. (Ishii-Kuntz, 1997, p. 138)
To the extent that a cultural preference for males is 
communicated to children, boys are likely to establish a 
fi rmer preference for their sex group, and girls are likely 
to experience some ambivalence toward if not rejection 
of their sex group. It is easier to be happy and content 
with oneself if one feels highly valued than if one feels 
less valued. The attainment of gender preference is a more 
complex and dynamic accomplishment than might be 
imagined. In fact, one’s gender preference may fl uctuate 
at different stages of life particularly as one perceives gen-
der-based changes in access to roles, resources, and social 
status (Maccoby, 2002).
Some families develop a strong preference regarding the 
sex of an expected child. In a longitudinal study of Swed-
ish children from birth to age 25, the parents’ prenatal 
preferences for a son or daughter were related to perceived 
problems in the mother-child and father-child relation-
ships (Stattin & Klackenberg-Larsson, 1991). Mothers’ 
perceptions of problems in the parent-child relationship—
especially the relationship between fathers and their nonpre-
ferred daughters—were signifi cantly related to the fathers’ 
disappointed hopes for a son.
Looking back on their relationship with their parents 
at age 25, nonpreferred daughters were especially likely 
to note problems, saying that their mothers did not have 
time for them, their fathers were stricter with them and had 
less time for them, and their relationships with their fathers 
were, in general, worse than the relationships described 
by preferred daughters. Research among families in India 
found that mothers’ preferences for sons were positively 
correlated with their sons’ IQ scores and negatively corre-
lated with their daughters’ IQ scores (Raina, Malhi, 
Malhotra, & Jerath, 2003). These kinds of studies sug-
gest that parental preference for one sex over the other can 
infl uence the quality of parent-child interactions and the 
resources, interactions, and opportunities available to boys 
and girls as they are growing up.
Table 7.1 summarizes the four components of the acqui-
sition of gender identification: (1) developing an under-
standing of gender, (2) learning gender role standards, 
(3) identifying with parents, and (4) establishing a gender 
preference. What was once viewed as a predominantly bio-
logical process of sex role differentiation is now viewed as a 
product of the interaction of biological, cognitive, and social 
factors. The outcome of the process for an individual child 
depends on the interaction of biologically based sex character-
istics, the parents’ approaches to gender role socialization, the 
child’s personal capacities and preferences, and the cultural 
and familial values that create gender-linked expectations for 
behavior.
combination of gender typicality and gender contentedness. 
Gender typicality refers to whether a child fi ts in with oth-
ers of the same sex, likes to do the same kinds of things as 
others of the same sex, is good at the same kinds of things 
as others of the same sex, and in general displays the typical 
traits of being a girl or a boy. Contentedness means that a 
child likes being the sex proscribed at birth, does not think 
it would be more fun to be the opposite sex, and does not 
spend time wishing to do things that members of the oppo-
site sex can do. In their research, Egan and Perry found a 
strong and consistent relationship between gender typical-
ity and measures of self-esteem, social competence, and 
acceptance from both male and female peers. With respect 
to gender contentedness, they found that the greater social 
pressure children felt to conform to gender role norms, the 
more important gender contentedness was in sustaining self-
esteem and perceived social competence. Those children 
who were not content about being a boy or a girl and also 
perceived a lot of pressure to conform to gender stereotypes 
experienced lower self-esteem.
Generally, there is more latitude or fl exibility around the 
behaviors that are viewed as acceptable for young girls than 
for young boys. Little boys are more frequently stigmatized for 
acting in what is considered girlish ways, and are more likely 
to experience peer rejection if their behaviors are deemed gen-
der atypical. As a result, a nonconforming gender preference 
is more likely to be a source of distress for boys (Wallien, van-
Goozen, & Cohen-Kettenis, 2007; Hegarty, 2009).
Both boys and girls can have experiences, like those 
described by Lee in the case study on Gender Identifi ca-
tion in Early Childhood, when their personal preferences 
for play behaviors, friends, and interests do not seem to 
fi t with the cultural standards or stereotypes for their sex. 
In most cases, children and adults recognize these prefer-
ences as expressions of a child’s unique temperament or 
personality. However, some children have a strong aver-
sion to some or all of the physical characteristics or social 
roles associated with their own biological sex, a condi-
tion called gender dysphoria, and express a desire to be 
the opposite sex (APA Task Force on Gender Identity and 
Gender Variance, 2009).
Gender preference can be influenced by environmental 
cues as to the value of one sex or the other. The cues may ema-
nate from the family, ethnic and religious groups, the media, 
social institutions (such as the schools), and other culture 
carriers. Many cultures have traditionally valued men more 
than women and have given men higher status. For example, 
among Japanese immigrants who came to the United States 
between the 1890s and early 1900s, a strong value was the 
commitment to a hierarchical and male-head-of-household 
view of the family (Ishii-Kuntz, 1997):
The Issei (fi rst-generation immigrant families) customarily 
designated their eldest son the successor to the family 
business. . . . Accordingly, the eldest Nisei (second-generation) 
son usually received special treatment and privileges from

understanding that lying, cheating, stealing, hurting oth-
ers, or making fun of other children’s differences are mor-
ally wrong, and that telling the truth, playing fairly, sharing, 
being helpful, and respecting people’s differences are morally 
right. The following analysis of moral development focuses 
on how children learn moral standards and apply them to 
their own behavior as well as the behavior of others. For 
early-school-age children, achievements in moral develop-
ment include changes in three interrelated domains:
 1. Emotions. (a) Experiencing the array of emotions that fos-
ter caring about others and that produce anxiety, guilt, 
and remorse when a moral standard has been violated; 
and (b) recognizing these emotions in others.
 2. Knowledge. Learning the moral code of one’s community 
and making judgments about whether something is good 
or bad, right or wrong.
 3. Action. Taking appropriate actions to inhibit negative 
impulses, to act in accordance with rules and requests, 
to obey parents and other authorities, or to act in a car-
ing, helpful manner, depending on the situation.
Early moral development involves a process called inter-
nalization, which means behaving according to parental 
standards, rules, and values without external monitoring and 
constant reminders. This process, sometimes referred to as the 
formation of a conscience, requires that the child experience 
moral emotions, understand the community’s moral code, and 
be able to take appropriate actions to either inhibit bad behav-
ior or enact good behavior (Aksan & Kochanska, 2005). Dur-
ing toddlerhood, a child’s attention is focused on limits of and 
standards for behavior. Toddlers typically feel that demands for 
proper behavior do not come from within themselves but ema-
nate from the external world. In contrast, during early school 
age, standards and limits become part of a child’s self-concept. 
Specifi c values may be acquired primarily from parents, but 
they become integrated elements of the child’s worldview.
Internalized morality includes inhibiting harmful or 
socially unacceptable impulses and striving to do what 
is right. This is often characterized as the want vs. should 
conflict. A child wants to indulge impulses for immediate 
expression or pleasure, but knows that there should be a con-
sideration for the consequences of those behaviors (Milkman, 
Rogers, & Bazerman, 2008). For example, a 3-year-old boy 
may take great delight in teasing his dog by threatening it 
with a stick. During one of these attacks, his mother scolds 
him. She insists that he stop and explains that it is cruel to 
hurt or frighten the dog. She may have to remind the boy on 
several other occasions that hitting the dog is not permitted. 
As the boy internalizes this standard, he begins to experience 
internal control over his own behavior. He may see the dog 
lying calmly in the sun and, with a gleam in his eye, begin to 
pick up a stick. At that moment, his behavior is interrupted 
by a feeling of tension, which is accompanied by the thought 
that it is wrong to hit the dog. If the standard has been suc-
cessfully internalized, the emotional tension and the thought 
will be suffi cient to inhibit the boy from hitting the dog.
A child’s gender identity becomes a basic cognitive 
scheme that influences the interpretation of experiences. 
Children learn that people are grouped into two sexes—male 
and female. In our society, this dichotomy imposes itself on 
a wide array of social situations, including work, play, and 
politics—arenas where one’s genital sex is not especially rele-
vant. Once children learn this powerful category, they go 
about the business of fi guring out how to apply it. They rec-
ognize people as men and women, boys and girls, and they 
identify themselves as members of one of these two groups. 
They form expectations based on this categorization—that 
certain toys, interests, and behaviors are appropriate for boys 
and others are appropriate for girls; that certain activities, 
dispositions, and occupations are appropriate for men and 
others for women. These expectations are generally rein-
forced by the beliefs of the older children and adults with 
whom children interact. Thus, the gender schemes that are 
conceived during childhood play a signifi cant role in guiding 
a child’s daily activities and in shaping a preliminary vision 
of oneself in the future. Gender-based beliefs may become 
integrated into moral development, so that children begin to 
believe that it is morally right to adhere to certain gender 
role standards and morally wrong to violate these standards.

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
The special case of avoidance conditioning is viewed 
as a paradigm for understanding how internalization is sus-
tained. Having been disciplined in the past for wrong- 
doings, a child contemplating a misdeed should feel tension. 
Avoiding or inhibiting the impulse to misbehave reduces the 
tension and is therefore reinforcing. This process may occur 
even when the person who was involved in administer-
ing the discipline is absent. In other words, the scenario of 
thinking about a wrong or naughty action, feeling the anxi-
ety that is associated with past discipline, and reducing that 
anxiety by exercising restraint may take place mentally, with-
out any observable behavior. Over time, the reinforcement 
of tension reduction that is linked to controlling a wrongful 
impulse strengthens the tendency to inhibit it, and the child’s 
behavior becomes less impulsive.
Social learning theory adds another mechanism for moral 
learning: the observation of models. By observing and imi-
tating helpful models, children can learn prosocial behavior. 
When a child observes someone else perform a kind, gener-
ous, or selfl ess act, it produces an uplifting emotional response. 
Five Theoretical Perspectives 
on Moral Development
A variety of theories explain how the domains of emotion, 
knowledge, and action converge to produce the internal-
ized moral behavior considered appropriate for the early-
school-age child. The fi ve theoretical approaches presented 
here—learning theories, cognitive developmental theory, 
psychoanalytic theory, object relations theory, and evolution-
ary theory—each offer distinct views about the way morality 
becomes internalized. You may fi nd it helpful to refer back to 
Chapter 2 (Major Theories for Understanding Human Devel-
opment) to review the basic concepts of these theories.
These theories focus on the process of moral development, 
not the content. Each culture or subcultural group has its 
own set of moral standards. For example, in many Asian cul-
tures, children are taught that teachers are highly revered. 
Children learn to show respect to a teacher and to view their 
teachers as important role models. Children who are disre-
spectful of a teacher would be shamed. In the United States, 
the role of teacher does not have especially high status in 
comparison to many other occupations. Parents may express 
criticism of teachers openly in front of their children. They 
may write excuses for children’s absences or failure to com-
plete their homework, even though both the children and 
parents know these excuses are fabrications. Children may 
learn that some teachers are fair and helpful, but others 
are not. They may not believe that it is immoral to ignore a 
teacher’s request or to make fun of a teacher with the other 
children. The theories that follow suggest how children 
internalize moral standards; they do not explain what the 
standards are or suggest what they should be.
Learning Theories. The focus of learning theories is on 
the conditions that support moral behaviors or actions. 
Moral behavior and the process of internalization are viewed 
as a response to environmental reinforcements and punish-
ments (Aronfreed, 1969). Moral behaviors can be shaped 
by the consequences that follow them. A positive, prosocial 
behavior, like offering to help put the toys away or comfort-
ing another child who is distressed, is likely to be repeated 
if it is rewarded. In contrast, if a behavior is ignored or pun-
ished, it is less likely to occur again. If a child performs a 
misdeed or defi es an authority and suffers negative conse-
quences, these consequences ought to reduce the likelihood 
that such behavior will recur. If a child is in an unpleasant or 
painful environment and performs a behavior that reduces 
or eliminates the unpleasantness, the child is more likely to 
perform this same behavior again in similar situations. For 
example, if a child says, “I’m sorry. I’ll try to do better next 
time,” and this apology reduces the parent’s anger or irritabil-
ity, this behavior is likely to be repeated at other times when 
the parent is angry at the child. According to learning theory, 
internalization results as the behaviors that lead to a more 
comfortable, less threatening environment become more 
common and the behaviors that produce parental anger or 
confl ict disappear.

According to learning theory, Martin’s willingness to do his 
chores and help around the house is strengthened because he 
receives a reward for his efforts. According to this theory, what 
would happen if Martin’s father stopped giving him the reward? 

 
Developmental Tasks | 251
Cognitive Developmental Theory. In comparison to 
the learning theories, cognitive developmental theorists 
focus more on moral reasoning than on moral behavior. 
They place emphasis on the child’s active construction of 
moral meaning, focusing on developmental changes in the 
ways children make judgments and reason about morally 
relevant situations. Piaget (1932/1948) described the major 
transition in moral judgment as a shift from heteronomous 
to autonomous morality. In heteronomous morality, rules 
are understood as fixed, unchangeable aspects of social 
reality. Children’s moral judgments refl ect a sense of sub-
ordination to authority fi gures. An act is judged as right 
or wrong depending on the letter of the law, the amount 
of damage that was done, and whether or not the act was 
punished.
In autonomous morality, children see rules as prod-
ucts of cooperative agreements. Moral judgments refl ect a 
child’s participation in a variety of social roles and in egali-
tarian relationships with friends. Give-and-take with peers 
highlights mutual respect and mutual benefit as rewards 
for holding to the terms of agreement or abiding by the law. 
Piaget posed situations like the following to young children 
in order to help clarify the difference between heteronomous 
and autonomous morality.
Mark rushes into the kitchen, pushing open the door. Although 
he did not realize it, his mother had left a set of 10 cups and 
saucers on a stool behind the door. When he pushed the door 
open, the cups and saucers fell off the stool and broke.
Matt was climbing up on the kitchen counter to reach some 
cookies that his mother told him he was not supposed to eat. 
While climbing on the counter, he broke one cup and saucer.
Who committed the more serious moral transgression? 
Which boy should be more severely punished?
Hannah got in trouble in school 
today for talking back to her 
teacher. Now her mother is try-
ing to explain that it is wrong 
to be disrespectful to teachers. 
At the preconventional level of 
morality, Hannah just thinks it’s 
wrong if you get punished. Lots 
of other kids are disrespectful 
to the teacher and nothing ever 
happens to them.

If the opportunity for positive or altruistic actions occurs, the 
child who has observed someone else’s generosity is likely to be 
more caring or helpful as a result of having observed this posi-
tive action by others (Schnall, Roper, & Fessler, 2010).
By observing the negative consequences that follow the 
misdeeds of models, they can also learn to inhibit their own 
misbehavior. Their moral behavior is not limited to the 
actions they have performed—it may be based on expecta-
tions formulated from observations of how the conduct of 
relevant models has been rewarded or punished (Bandura, 
1977, 1991). For example, early-school-age children are 
more likely to judge an act of televised violence as right if 
the act goes unpunished. Having viewed such unpunished 
acts, children formulate abstract rules, concepts, and sets 
of proposition about when aggressive behavior is justifi ed 
(Kremar & Cooke, 2001).
Cognitive learning theory describes how moral behavior is 
infl uenced by situational factors and by the child’s expectations, 
values, and goals (Mischel, 1973). For example, some people 
place great value on success in athletics and may be more 
tempted to lie or cheat in order to succeed in an athletic com-
petition than in an academic setting. Another situational factor 
is the presence or absence of monitoring. The expectation that 
a misdeed will be observed and punished leads to greater resis-
tance to temptation than does the expectation that a misdeed 
will go unnoticed. Similarly, the belief that positive, prosocial 
behaviors are expected and will be noticed infl uences a child’s 
generosity and helpfulness (Froming, Allen, & Jensen, 1985). 
According to this theoretical perspective, the specifi c situation 
will infl uence the extent to which moral behavior is displayed 
(Carroll & Rest, 1982). According to the learning theories, 
moral character is built on the accumulation of many experi-
ences across different situations day after day where children 
learn which behaviors are acceptable and which are not.

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
because it was punished is seen as inadequate. The stages form 
an invariant sequence, moving from a very idiosyncratic, per-
sonal view of morality to a view in which rules and laws are 
obeyed because they have been established by an authority 
or a society, and fi nally to an understanding of rules and laws 
as created to uphold basic principles of fairness, justice, and 
humanity (Boom, Brugman, & van der Heijden, 2001).
Consistent with this theory of moral development, early-
school-age children can be expected to reason about moral 
situations at Level I, preconventional morality, which is domi-
nated by concerns about the consequences of their behavior. 
At Stage 1, children’s judgments of good and bad, right and 
wrong, are based on whether a behavior has been rewarded 
or punished or is expected to be rewarded or punished. At 
Stage 2, children’s moral judgments are based on whether 
the behavior will bring about benefi ts for them or for other 
people they care about. Thus, young children’s moral out-
look has a utilitarian orientation (Kohlberg, 1976). Research 
with fi rst graders confi rms that this preconventional outlook 
is quite common, whether children are discussing hypotheti-
cal or real-life moral dilemmas (Walker, 1989).
However, children understand that not all misbehavior 
involves a moral transgression (see the Applying Theory and 
Research to Life box for a discussion of moral transgressions, 
social convention, and personal choice). Moreover, a child’s 
moral reasoning can be altered by exposure to an environ-
ment that encourages children to participate actively in cre-
ating the moral climate. For example, in the preschool and 
early primary grades, children can function at a more fl exible, 
autonomous level when the moral atmosphere consistently 
emphasizes mutual respect. Classrooms where children are 
involved in rule making and confl ict resolution give children 
an opportunity to appreciate each other’s perspectives and to 
construct a social order that is largely regulated by the chil-
dren themselves (DeVries, Hildebrandt, & Zan, 2000).
Children operating with a heteronomous morality believe 
that the child who breaks 10 cups by accident has commit-
ted a much more serious transgression than the child who 
broke only one. Children who have achieved an autonomous 
morality believe that the child who disobeyed and violated his 
mother’s trust committed the more serious transgression. In 
general, younger children are likely to judge the moral serious-
ness of an action based on the magnitude and nature of the 
consequences. If an action, no matter what the intent, pro-
duced harm, it should be punished. Older children are able to 
consider both the intention and the consequences in making a 
moral judgment. If an action was intended to harm and pro-
duced harm, it should defi nitely be punished (Helwig, Zelazo, 
& Wilson, 2001).
Expanding on the distinction between heteronomous 
and autonomous morality, cognitive developmental theorists 
have described a sequence of stages of moral thought (Kohl-
berg, 1976; Gibbs, 1979; Damon, 1980). As children become 
increasingly skillful in evaluating the abstract and logical com-
ponents of a moral dilemma, their moral judgments change. 
At the core of this change is the mechanism called equilibra-
tion—efforts to reconcile new perspectives and ideas about 
basic moral concepts, such as justice, intentionality, and social 
responsibility, with existing views about what is right and 
wrong. Children’s reasoning may be thrown into disequilib-
rium by external sources, such as their parents’ use of explana-
tions and inductions regarding a moral dilemma or encounters 
with friends who reason differently about a moral conflict. 
Children’s own cognitive maturation, especially the ability to 
think abstractly and hypothetically about interrelated variables, 
determines how their reasoning about moral dilemmas will be 
structured (Piaget, 1978/1985; Walker, Gustafson, & Hennig, 
2001).
Kohlberg (1969, 1976) described three levels of moral 
thought, each characterized by two stages of moral judgment 
(see Table 7.2). At Level I, preconventional morality, Stage 1 
judgments of justice are based on whether a behavior is 
rewarded or punished. Stage 2 judgments are based on an 
instrumental view of whether the consequences will be good 
for “me and my family.” The fi rst and, to some degree, the sec-
ond stage of Level I characterize children of early school age. 
Level II, conventional morality, is concerned with maintain-
ing the approval of authorities at Stage 3 and with upholding 
the social order at Stage 4. Level III, postconventional moral-
ity, brings an acceptance of moral principles that are viewed 
as part of a person’s own ideology rather than simply being 
imposed by the social order. At Stage 5, justice and morality 
are determined by a democratically derived social contract. At 
Stage 6, a person develops a sense of universal ethical princi-
ples that apply across history and cultural contexts.
According to this theory, the stages form a logical hierarchy. 
At each new stage, individuals reorganize their view of morality, 
realizing the inadequacy of the preceding stage. For example, 
once a person sees morality in terms of a system that upholds 
and protects the social order (Stage 4), then the reasoning that 
argues for an act as moral because it was rewarded or immoral

Judgment
LEVEL I: PRECONVENTIONAL
Stage 1 Judgments are based on whether behavior is rewarded or 
punished.
Stage 2 Judgments are based on whether the consequences result 
in benefi ts for self or loved ones.
LEVEL II: CONVENTIONAL
Stage 3 Judgments are based on whether authorities approve or

Moral Transgressions, 
Social Convention, 
and Personal Choice
NOT ALL SOCIAL RULES or prohibitions 
have to do with moral concerns. There 
is a difference between morality, which 
usually involves the rights, dignity, 
and welfare of others, and social 
convention, which involves socially 
accepted norms and regulations (Turiel, 
1983; Smetana, 1985). For example, 
in the preschool context, stealing 
another child’s toy would be a moral 
transgression; a transgression of social 
convention would be getting up and 
wandering away during circle time. 
Preschool-age children are consistently 
able to differentiate between moral and 
social convention transgressions. They 
understand that moral transgressions 
are wrong because they affect the 
welfare of others and that social 
convention transgressions are wrong 
because they are disruptive or create 
disorder (Turiel, 2002).
Social convention transgressions 
depend on the situation. At home, it 
may be permissible to get up from the 
table during dinnertime before everyone 
has fi nished and go somewhere to play, 
whereas it is not permissible to get 
up from the snack table at preschool 
until the teacher says everyone may 
leave. Moral transgressions apply more 
consistently across settings: It is morally 
wrong to steal at home, at preschool, or 
at a friend’s house. Children as young 
as 3 and 4 make this distinction when 
they evaluate transgressions. In contrast 
to social convention transgressions, 
young children tend to judge moral 
transgressions to be more serious, 
deserving of greater punishment, and 
independent of the rules or authority 
in a situation (Smetana, Schlagman, & 
Adams, 1993).
In addition to moral and social 
convention, some behaviors fall within 
the domain of personal choice. Within 
the boundaries of fairness and social 
reciprocity, children recognize a domain 
of personal freedom. Whereas moral 
and social decisions are often guided by 
adult authority and regulations, personal 
choices are typically guided by a child’s 
own preferences (Nucci & Turiel, 2000). 
These choices might include preferences 
for certain toys or play activities, foods, 
or choice of friends. Children perceive 
that they have more latitude for 
expressing their personal preferences 
at home than at school, where social 
convention and teachers’ authority may 
restrict some of their choices (Weber, 
1999). Studies of Colombian and 
Chinese preschool-age children suggest 
that even in cultures that are considered 
strongly hierarchical or collectivist, 
young children perceive that they have 
a legitimate role in certain personal 
decisions, such as which foods or toys 
they prefer, so long as these decisions 
are coordinated with consideration for 
others (Ardila-Rey & Killen, 2001; Yau & 
Smetana, 2003).
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. What are the distinguishing fea-
tures of morality, social conven-
tion, and personal choice? Is it 
reasonable to differentiate these 
three domains? Can you think of a 
behavior that might be considered 
an aspect of personal choice in one 
culture, but a moral imperative in 
another?
 2. The discussion of moral development 
begins with a summary of fi ve theo-
ries. How does each of these theo-
ries distinguish between the domains 
of morality, social convention, and 
personal choice?
 3. In certain totalitarian dictatorships, 
children have been urged to report 
on the behaviors and political views 
of their parents, especially any be-
haviors or views that might be criti-
cal of the ruling party. What are the 
moral implications of this kind of 
expectation? What should a child do 
under these conditions?
 4. What kinds of experiences and so-
cialization messages might help a 
child to identify areas of personal 
choice? How might families differ 
in the extent to which they create 
room for children to have and ex-
press personal preferences? What 
are the likely consequences of a 
socialization environment that allows 
wide or narrow avenues for personal 
choice?

contribute to moral behavior. According to psychoanalytic 
theory, a moral sense develops as a result of strong paren-
tal identifi cation. Classical psychoanalytic theory viewed 
a child’s conscience, or superego, as an internalization 
of parental values and moral standards. It holds that the 
superego is formed during the phallic stage, between the 
ages of about 4 and 7, as a result of the confl ict between 
a child’s sexual and aggressive impulses and the ways in 
which the parents deal with the behavioral manifestations 
of those impulses.
According to psychoanalytic theory, the more severely 
a parent forces a child to inhibit impulses, the stronger the 
child’s superego will be. Freud (1925/1961) assumed that 
boys would develop more highly differentiated and punitive 
superegos than girls because he believed that boys’ impulses 
are more intense. He also believed that because of the greater 
impulsive energy demonstrated by boys, boys are treated more 
harshly by their parents than are girls. Finally, Freud suggested 
that boys identify with their fathers for two reasons: fear of 
losing the father’s love and fear of the father as an aggressor. 
This identifi cation with the father is intense and typically leads 
to a fully incorporated set of moral standards. According to 
Freud, a girl identifi es with her mother for a single reason: 
fear of losing her love. As Freud considered this motivation for 
identifi cation less intense than that of the boy, he believed that 
the girl’s superego would be correspondingly weaker.
Research on the development of conscience has failed to 
support Freud’s hypotheses. Studies that have investigated 
the ability to resist temptation or to confess after wrongdoing 
The notion that people move through a hierarchical 
sequence of stages of moral reasoning prompted by a process 
of cognitive disequilibrium has been challenged on a number 
of fronts. The direction of development over the stages has 
been viewed as too linear, valuing justice over social cooper-
ation. It has been criticized as embodying a Western cultural 
orientation, and a male-oriented value system, which places 
the individual good and individual freedoms above the good 
of the group or community (Arnold, 2000). However, cross-
cultural comparisons have found support for the idea that 
as people mature, they fi nd increasingly sophisticated ways 
of approaching moral situations. A study of more than 500 
high school and university students in Taiwan found that the 
students showed evidence of high levels of postconventional 
reasoning, even though they adopted a culturally collectivist 
Chinese moral ethic (Gielen & Miao, 2000). Longitudinal 
studies in a variety of countries have observed an evolution 
of moral thought much like that proposed by Kohlberg, in 
which the reasoning shifts from an idiosyncratic to a more 
principled approach to evaluating moral confl icts (Gielen & 
Markoulis, 2001).
Psychoanalytic Theory. The psychoanalytic theorists 
focus on the ability of children to control their impulses 
and resist temptation, rather than on their cognitive rea-
soning about what constitutes a moral transgression. This 
theoretical perspective addresses moral emotions, espe-
cially guilt about having harmful or naughty impulses, 
and pride in behaving in accord with one’s ideals, as they 
According to the psychoanalytic 
view, young children act on their 
impulses. As the superego develops, 
they are more successful at resisting 
temptation.

which to encounter these impulses, emotions, and fears. As 
a result, the child does not have to split off from his or her 
angry, vengeful self or project it onto others. By seeing the 
loved other as both good and bad, and the self as both good 
and bad, the child’s capacity for caring and empathy expands 
(Fonagy, 1999).
Longitudinal studies have provided support for the link 
between experiences of mutually responsive care in infancy 
and later moral emotion and behaviors (Kochanska, For-
man, Aksan, & Dunbar, 2005). Children whose relationship 
with their mothers was characterized as mutually responsive 
in infancy showed stronger moral emotions, that is, greater 
distress over another person’s pain and distress, and greater 
remorse after having damaged a valued toy. These children 
also showed greater restraint in resisting temptation and 
higher levels of compliance with requests from a parent or 
an experimenter when they were left alone. The early experi-
ences of mutuality with a caregiver is transformed over time 
into enjoyment during child-caregiver interactions, greater 
willingness for compliance, and less need for the use of 
power assertion or monitoring to ensure compliance.
Evolutionary Theory. The evolutionary perspective 
emphasizes an emotional or affective as well as a cogni-
tive aspect to morality. Haidt (2007, 2008) characterizes 
these components as moral intuition and moral reasoning. 
The emotional or intuitive component is a more primitive, 
immediate, almost automatic system that evaluates experi-
ences as positive or negative, good or bad, without going 
through steps of searching for more information or weigh-
ing evidence. The moral reasoning component is thought 
to have evolved later, along with language, and is used to 
reach a moral judgment or decision. According to the evolu-
tionary view, the moral reasoning component is slower than 
moral intuition, and is often used to justify the initial moral 
intuition.
Certain areas of the brain, especially the amygdala and 
insula, produce emotional alarms, signaling fear or danger, 
as well as positive responses to stimuli. Social emotions, 
including lust and disgust, pride, humiliation, and guilt, 
which are processed in the insula, contribute to moral intu-
ition. These affective areas operate to produce an orienting 
emotion that colors subsequent judgments. When people are 
told a moral story or dilemma, they typically have an imme-
diate emotional reaction. They then begin to use reason to 
justify this reaction. Sometimes, they can override the initial 
intuitive reaction, most commonly when they interact with 
others who might stimulate a different, alternative emotional 
reaction to the situation.
According to an evolutionary view, morality, especially 
altruism and care for others, and fairness and reciprocity in 
social interactions help to bind members of groups together. 
Early human groups that were able to create a moral code 
that rewarded and increased behaviors benefi cial to the group 
and that punished or reduced selfi shness would have been 
more successful in attracting new members, and fi ghting off 
have found that young girls are better able to resist temp-
tation than boys and show a pattern of decreasing moral 
transgressions over the toddlerhood and early school years 
(Mischel et al., 1989). Studies that have attempted to assess 
the relative contributions of mothers and fathers to their 
children’s moral behavior have found that mothers’ values 
and attitudes are strongly related to the moral behavior of 
their children, whereas the values and attitudes of fathers 
have little relationship to such behavior (Hoffman, 1970). 
Finally, research has found that the children of parents who 
use harsh physical punishment do not have higher levels of 
internalization. These children are likely to inhibit impul-
sive behaviors in the presence of their parents, but when 
they are observed with their peers away from home, they tend 
to be physically aggressive and do not control their behavior 
well (Pettit, Dodge, & Brown, 1988; Hart, Ladd, & Burleson, 
1990). Parental warmth, limited use of power assertion, involv-
ing children in decision making, and modeling resistance to 
temptation contribute to high levels of prosocial behavior and 
social responsibility (Maccoby, 1992).
Object Relations Theory. In contrast to Freud’s views on 
the formation of conscience, object relations theory views 
the critical time for moral development as infancy rather 
than the early-school-age years (Klein, 1932/1975; Winni-
cut, 1958; Mahler, 1963; Kohut, 1971). Infants develop an 
awareness of three domains: the body and its physical expe-
riences and needs; the existence of others; and the relations 
between the self and others (Beit-Hallahmi, 1987). All sub-
sequent psychological growth must be assimilated into these 
three domains. According to this view, the origins of moral 
reasoning and behavior have links to early feelings about 
the self and its needs, especially the feelings of pleasure and 
pain, and the way these feelings are mirrored or accepted by 
the loving caregiver.
Morality has a basis in a young child’s awareness of val-
ued others and in behaviors that strengthen or threaten the 
bonds between the self and these others. All humans are 
seen as confronted by a dynamic tension between positive 
and negative emotions—love and hate, kindness and cruelty. 
One basis of early morality lies in the child’s own sense of 
self-love, a wish to enhance and not harm or violate the self. 
Another basis is the extension of this self-love to the other 
and the wish to preserve feelings of connection, trust, and 
security that have been established in the early parent-infant 
relationship. Through experiences with sensitive caregiving, 
infants become increasingly aware of the loved object as an 
integrated whole with feelings, motives, and goals as well as 
a physical reality. At the same time, this realization about the 
other fosters the child’s own awareness of his or her inner 
mental life. When a child is distressed, for example, a calm, 
reassuring caregiver will use a certain tone of voice, facial 
expressions, and comforting strategies to help the child cope 
with the diffi culty. This gives the child a chance to feel safe 
about experiencing the inner world of painful emotions. 
The loving caregiver allows the child an intimate context in

seed—one, no more. I did not want an orchard on my head; 
that would be too heavy. For the whole day, I anxiously felt 
my skull every other minute to see whether it was still in one 
piece. Several times I almost asked my grandmother whether 
I would be allowed to eat the oranges on my head, but I 
checked myself so that she would not know I had been dis-
obedient. I decided to pretend it was an accident when she 
saw the tree. I slept very badly that night. I felt something 
was pushing up against my skull. (Chang, 1991, pp. 208–209)
CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. What is the moral lesson of this case?
 2. How does the case illustrate the themes of moral emotion, 
knowledge, and action?
 3. How does each of the theoretical perspectives discussed 
earlier contribute to an understanding of this case?
 4. How does this case illustrate the particular orientation of 
early-school-age children to moral dilemmas?
 5. How generalizable is this case? Can you imagine similar 
moral confl icts among non-Chinese children?
These theoretical views about moral development have 
been expanded through research in several directions. The 
research on empathy and perspective taking focuses on how 
children come to know and understand others. These abili-
ties are essential for moral action. The research on parental 
discipline highlights the socialization process that supports 
self-regulation and internalization of moral values, including 
the passing on of a moral code from one generation to the 
next. The research on television illustrates the co-evolution 
of morality and culture.
Empathy, Caring, and Perspective Taking
The following sections focus on empathy, caring, and per-
spective taking. They consider how the child understands 
the emotional state and the intention or motivation of others. 
These are both factors that contribute to a child’s ability to 
care about another person’s distress and to consider the other 
person’s needs and intentions when judging a moral act 
(Eisenberg, 2000).
Empathy. Empathy has been defi ned as sharing the per-
ceived emotion of another—“feeling with another” (Eisen-
berg & Strayer, 1987, p. 5). This defi nition emphasizes one’s 
emotional reaction to the observation of another person’s 
emotional condition. By merely observing the facial expres-
sions, body attitudes, and vocalizations of another person, a 
child can identify that person’s emotion and feel it person-
ally. The range of emotions with which one can empathize 
depends on the clarity of the cues the other person sends 
and on one’s own prior experiences. Research on the mirror 
neuron system discussed in Chapter 6 suggests that humans 
are neurologically and psychologically prepared to synchro-
nize their feelings and movements with others, thus enhanc-
ing the capacity for empathy.
competing groups. Thus, morality is thought to have co-
evolved with the formation of larger human communities 
in which individuals are tied together beyond the basis of 
immediate kinship. As part of this process, rites, rituals, and 
institutions have emerged that link emotions, motor behav-
iors, and states of consciousness of large groups of people 
such that they are more attuned to one another than to 
members of out-groups and more willing to share resources, 
behave in a caring way, and exhibit loyalty to others in their 
group (Hauser, 2006).
Whereas the cognitive developmental and psychoanalytic 
perspectives focus on individuals and how they manage to 
control their antisocial impulses, the evolutionary emphasis 
is on the benefi t of moral emotions for the protection and 
preservation of the group. Most of the focus on the evolution 
of morality has emphasized two components: (1) protection 
from harm, caring and altruism toward kin, and, by exten-
sion, to the salient in-group or community; and (2) reciproc-
ity, fairness, or justice toward members of one’s group. Haidt 
(2007) added three more content areas that he has found 
to be salient in the moral codes of a large number of cul-
tures: in-group loyalty; respect and obedience to authority; 
and bodily and spiritual purity and the importance of living 
in sacred or sanctioned, not a disgraceful or disgusting, way 
(p. 1001). These content areas are elaborated to varying 
degrees by each cultural group, given more or less prominence 
in various religious teachings, and passed along from genera-
tion to generation through parental socialization, stories, and 
rituals. All fi ve of these moral domains operate to build and 
strengthen communal bonds, creating a framework for how 
people should treat others, how they expect others to treat 
them, and how they should function in a larger social group.
CASE STUDY
EARLY LEARNING ABOUT OBEDIENCE
Jung Chang describes the moral environment to which she 
was exposed in her early childhood years through inter-
actions with her grandmother.
For my grandmother, all fl owers and trees, the clouds and 
the rain were living beings with a heart and tears and a moral 
sense. We would be safe if we followed the old Chinese rule 
for children, ting-hua (“heeding the words,” being obedient). 
Otherwise all sorts of things would happen to us. When we 
ate oranges my grandmother would warn us against swallow-
ing the seeds. “If you don’t listen to me, one day you won’t 
be able to get into the house. Every little seed is a baby 
orange tree, and he wants to grow up, just like you. He’ll 
grow quietly inside your tummy, up and up, and then one 
day, Ai-ya! There he is, out from the top of your head! He’ll 
grow leaves, and bear more oranges, and he’ll become taller 
than our door. . . .”
The thought of carrying an orange tree on my head fas-
cinated me so much that one day I deliberately swallowed a

2002). Infants appear to be able to recognize and interpret 
auditory and facial cues that suggest emotional expressions 
in others. In the newborn nursery, when one infant starts to 
wail, the other infants begin to cry (Sagi & Hoffman, 1976; 
Martin & Clark, 1982). Following from object relations 
theory, the intimate infant-caregiver relationship forms an 
early framework for empathy. The coordination of rhyth-
mic interactions, the creation of joint attention, and the 
achievement of intersubjectivity through early gestures 
and words provide infants with an understanding of their 
caregiver’s state. In a study of 125 fi rstborn girls, empathic 
concern for their mothers’ distress was observed to increase 
from 16 months to 22 months of age. In contrast, empathic 
concern for a stranger was observed to decrease. In infancy, 
empathy for others appears to be situational, requiring an 
ability to overcome wariness or fearfulness in order to offer 
comfort to another person (van der Mark, van IJzendoorn, 
& Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2002).
Early-school-age children can usually identify the circum-
stances that may have produced another child’s emotional 
response, especially anger and distress, and they can under-
stand and empathize with another child’s feelings. Children 
are most likely to think that external events produce emotional 
reactions: “The teacher made her put her toys away,” or “He 
tripped over the blocks.” But they can also think about internal 
states that may produce strong emotions: “He’s mad because 
he didn’t get a turn,” or “She’s sad because her stomach hurts” 
(Fabes, Eisenberg, McCormick, & Wilson, 1988; Fabes, 
Eisenberg, Nyman, & Michealieu, 1991; Dunn, Cutting, & 
Demetriou, 2000). The ability to understand the emotions 
and mental state of another person allows children to justify 
someone’s moral behavior and perhaps to forgive a transgres-
sion: “The dad just spilled juice on his paper, so he yelled at his 
daughter. He was upset; he didn’t really mean it.”
The ability to identify pleasurable and unpleasurable 
emotions in others and to empathize with them makes the 
child receptive to moral teachings. Experiences of empa-
thy can result in sympathy, a concern for the other person 
that may motivate the child to help relieve the other per-
son’s distress. It can also serve a reactive function, where 
the child experiences personal distress by recognizing the 
distress of the other (Eisenberg et al., 1999). The child may 
wonder: “What did I do to cause this unhappiness?” In the 
case of social attitude formation, empathy has been engaged 
in efforts to help children develop more compassion and 
acceptance of stigmatized groups (Batson et al., 1997).
Caring. It is one thing to feel sympathy for someone 
else, and yet another to take action to help that person. The 
principle of care refers to a sense of duty or obligation to 
help someone who is in need. Caring may build upon the 
emotions aroused by empathy. However, the principle of care 
also requires a cognitive evaluation of the other person’s situ-
ation and an action component—the desire or intention to 
do something to help. From a developmental perspective, 
the principle of care reflects a greater degree of cognitive 
The capacity for empathy changes with development. 
Hoffman (1987) described four levels of empathy, especially 
in reference to the perception of another person’s distress.
 1. Global empathy: You experience and express distress as 
a result of witnessing someone else in distress. Example: 
A baby cries upon hearing the cries of other infants.
 2. Egocentric empathy: You recognize distress in another 
person and respond to it in the same way you would 
respond if the distress were your own. Example: A tod-
dler offers his own cuddle blanket to another child who 
is crying.
 3. Empathy for another’s feelings: You show empathy for a 
wide range of feelings and anticipate the kinds of reac-
tions that might really comfort someone else. Example: 
A child sees another child crying because his favorite toy 
is broken. She offers to help fi x the toy.
 4. Empathy for another’s life conditions: You experience 
empathy when you understand the life conditions or 
personal circumstances of a person or group. Example: 
A child learns of children in another town who have 
become homeless after a fl ood. The child asks his mother 
if he can send some of his clothes to those children.
The capacity for empathy begins in infancy. Infant imita-
tion, observed in the fi rst months of life, provides an initial 
link between the observation of emotional expressions in 
another person and the expression of that emotion (Meltzoff, 
Young children can be very caring and supportive in 
comforting others, especially if they understand the reason 
behind another child’s distress.

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
Many moral dilemmas require that children subor-
dinate their personal needs for someone else’s sake. To 
resolve such situations, children must be able to sepa-
rate their personal wants from the other person’s. Sel-
man’s research suggests that children under 10 can rarely 
approach interpersonal confl icts with this kind of objec-
tivity (Selman, 1994).
One longitudinal study followed children from the ages 
of 4 and 5 into early adulthood. Those children who showed 
spontaneous sharing, helping, and other prosocial behaviors 
in the early childhood years continued to exhibit prosocial 
behavior, sympathy, and perspective taking over the course 
of adolescence and early adulthood (Eisenberg et al., 1999). 
Some combination of a genetically based social orientation, 
an ability to regulate or inhibit one’s impulses, and a consis-
tent socialization environment contribute to a young child’s 
sympathetic response toward others’ distress. Over time, this 
outlook combines with a more mature capacity for moral rea-
soning and deepening social ties that help sustain a prosocial 
orientation.
Parental Discipline
Another contribution to an understanding of moral develop-
ment comes from the research on parental discipline, which 
was introduced in Chapter 6 in relation to self-control. Par-
ents are the child’s first teachers about the content of the 
moral code the child will be expected to internalize. Parents 
must make a stand for certain values, beliefs, and behaviors 
that embody the foundation of a moral way of life. When dis-
ciplining a child, the parent emphasizes that certain behav-
iors are wrong and should be inhibited; other behaviors are 
right and should be repeated. This distinction between good 
and bad behaviors and the accompanying parental approval 
or disapproval forms the content of the child’s moral code. 
Ideally, the socialization process as well as the specifi c moral 
teaching should support a child’s belief in a caring, just, and 
fair community. Discipline strategies that are unduly harsh 
or erratic are likely to undermine these values and produce a 
set of moral beliefs focusing on power, domination, and self-
interest (Arsenio & Gold, 2006).
Parents use specifi c discipline techniques to bring about 
compliance with the moral code. Four elements are impor-
tant in determining the impact of these techniques on the 
child’s future behavior. The discipline should:
 1. Help the child interrupt or inhibit the forbidden action.
 2. Point out a more acceptable form of behavior, so that the 
child will know what is right in a future instance.
 3. Provide some reason, understandable to the child, why 
one action is inappropriate and the other more desirable.
 4. Stimulate the child’s ability to empathize with the vic-
tim of the misdeed. In other words, children are asked 
to put themselves in their victim’s place and to see how 
much they dislike the feelings they caused in the other 
person.
awareness than empathic distress, and an internalized moral 
standard that one should do what one can to reduce another 
person’s distress (Eisenberg & Fabes, 1998; Wilhelm & 
Bekkers, 2010).
Perspective Taking. The terms empathy and perspective 
taking are sometimes confused. Empathy typically refers 
to the ability to identify and experience the emotional state 
of another person. Perspective taking refers to the cogni-
tive capacity to consider a situation from the point of view 
of another person. This requires a recognition that some-
one else’s point of view may differ from one’s own. It also 
requires the ability to analyze the factors that may account 
for these differences (Piaget, 1932/1948; Selman, 1971; 
Flavell, 1974).
Imagine a child who wants to play with another child’s 
toy. If the first child thinks, “If I had that toy, I would be 
happy, and if I am happy, everyone is happy,” then that child 
may take the toy without anticipating that the other child 
will be upset. This is evidence of a lack of perspective taking. 
Whereas empathy provides an emotional bridge that enables 
children to discover the similarities between self and others, 
it does not teach them about differences. Recognizing these 
differences requires perspective taking. The capacity to take 
another person’s perspective is achieved gradually through 
parental inductions, peer interaction, social pretend play, 
confl ict, and role-playing.
Children at ages 4 and 5 frequently exhibit prosocial 
behaviors that evidence an understanding of others’ needs. 
The most common of these behaviors are sharing, cooperat-
ing, and helping. Two examples illustrate the nature of this 
kind of social perspective taking:
The path of a child with an armload of play dough was 
blocked by two chairs. Another child stopped her ongoing 
activity and moved the chair before the approaching child 
reached it.
A boy saw another child spill a puzzle on the fl oor and 
assisted him in picking it up. (Iannotti, 1985, p. 53)
Robert Selman (1980) studied the process of social per-
spective taking by analyzing children’s responses to a struc-
tured interview. Children watched audiovisual fi lmstrips that 
depicted interpersonal conflicts. They were then asked to 
describe the motivation of each actor and the relationships 
among the various performers. Four levels of social perspec-
tive taking were described. At Level 1, the youngest children 
(4 to 6 years old) recognized different emotions in the vari-
ous actors, but they assumed that all the actors viewed the 
situation much as they did. The children at Level 4 (about 
10 to 12 years old) realized that two people were able to take 
each other’s perspective into account before deciding how to 
act. Furthermore, they realized that each of those people may 
have viewed the situation differently from the way they did.

all contribute to a child’s early moral development (Laible 
& Thompson, 2000). Children and parents encounter 
many examples when children behave well and show signs 
of kindness, caring, and truthfulness. They also encounter 
many examples when children misbehave, exhibiting self-
ishness, anger, or cruelty. Especially at times when chil-
dren are experiencing emotional distress, parents teach and 
model positive moral behavior through their tone of voice, 
their willingness to hear a child’s explanations, their will-
ingness to provide explanations for their rules, and their 
ability to maintain open communication, even during con-
fl ict. They convey a sense that we are all imperfect, that we 
continue to strive toward a moral ideal, and that we can 
forgive and try again.
The Impact of Television and Video 
Games on Moral Development
Moral influences extend beyond the family to include 
schools, religious institutions, and the community. One of 
the societal infl uences that is of great concern is the impact 
of the media, especially television, video games, and Internet 
play on children’s attitudes and behavior. Some people sug-
gest that the television has become a part of the family sys-
tem. In about 80% of homes, the television is often on even 
when no one is watching. Family interactions are different 
in the presence of the television, involving less talking and 
more touching. Images, information, and dramatic situations 
In considering discipline as a mechanism for teaching 
morality, one becomes aware of the many interacting and 
interrelated components of a moral act. The discipline tech-
niques that are most effective in teaching morality to chil-
dren are those that help children control their own behavior, 
understand the meaning of their behavior for others, and 
expand their feelings of empathy. Discipline techniques that 
do not include these characteristics, such as power assertion, 
may succeed in inhibiting undesired behavior but may fail 
to achieve the long-term goal of incorporating moral values 
into future behavior.
The child’s temperament is often overlooked in deter-
mining the likely effectiveness of certain disciplinary tech-
niques. For example, children who are especially fussy and 
irritable as infants are more likely to be spanked by their 
parents (Berlin et al., 2009). Children who are tempera-
mentally fearful and inhibited in response to novel stim-
uli, and who choose to stay close to their mothers during 
toddlerhood, are especially sensitive to messages of disap-
proval. For these children, a small dose of parental criti-
cism is adequate to promote moral internalization, and too 
much power assertion appears to be counterproductive. In 
contrast, children who are highly active and who are insen-
sitive to messages of disapproval require more focused and 
directive discipline, especially a consistent program of rec-
ognizing and rewarding good behaviors and minimizing 
the situations and stimuli that may provoke impulsive or 
aggressive actions (Kochanska, 1997).
In addition to the use of discipline, parents guide moral 
development by modeling positive, prosocial behaviors and 
by talking with their children about moral issues. In Chap-
ter 6, we discussed the use of scaffolding to promote more 
effective communicative competence. In the same way, par-
ents can scaffold their child’s moral reasoning by talking with 
their children, raising questions about moral decisions their 
children are facing, and introducing new arguments or alter-
native views as their children think about moral conflicts 
(Walker & Taylor, 1991).
For example, Beth’s mother asks her to help pick up the 
toys and put them away. Beth says that her brother made 
the mess, and he should pick up the toys. Beth’s mother 
might acknowledge Beth’s frustration about picking up 
after her little brother. But then she could point out that 
Beth would be helping her by picking up the toys, and that 
at some time in the future, she will want her brother to help 
clean up a mess that Beth made. Meanwhile, it is important 
to pick up the toys so they do not get broken and so no one 
trips or falls over them. The idea that helping in a family 
is not just about what each person does, but about what is 
good for the family as a whole, challenges Beth’s moral rea-
soning and encourages her to move to a new level of moral 
reasoning.

sion of warmth and affection in the relationship, and a par-
ent’s willingness to talk about feelings and moral concerns

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy state-
ment on television viewing in which they make the following 
recommendations (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001):
 1. Discourage television viewing for all children under 
age 2.
 2. Remove televisions from children’s bedrooms.
 3. Limit children’s total entertainment media time (televi-
sion, video games, Internet play) to no more than 1 to 2 
hours per day.
 4. Focus on programs and games that are informational, 
educational, and nonviolent.
These recommendations are based on research evidence 
suggesting that about two thirds of current television pro-
gramming contains a great amount of violence, and portray-
als of violence are often glamorized and go unpunished. As a 
result, watching television and playing video games that have 
violent content have a strong impact on a child’s willingness 
to engage in real-life violence or they may be frightened by 
these violent images (Federman, 1998; Wilson et al., 2002).
Studies of children in the United States and in other coun-
tries have provided evidence that at least three processes are 
at work that may increase the level of aggressiveness in chil-
dren who are exposed to media violence (Huesmann & Eron, 
1986; Huesmann & Malamuth, 1986; Josephson, 1987; 
Liebert & Sprafkin, 1988; Comstock & Paik, 1991; Huston 
et al., 1992; see Table 7.3). First, children observe role mod-
els who perform aggressive actions. Especially when the hero 
portrayed on television infl uence family members, resulting 
in new kinds of behaviors, shared experiences, points of dis-
cussion, and exposure to distressing images that may require 
comforting or interpretation (Gentile & Walsh, 2002).
A primary focus of research has been on exposure to vio-
lence on the beliefs and behaviors of young children (Hues-
mann & Skoric, 2003). Concern about media violence is 
particularly meaningful in the context of the child’s grow-
ing moral consciousness. More than 30 years of laboratory 
experiments, fi eld experiments, and analyses of naturally 
occurring behaviors have led to the conclusion that tele-
vised and video game violence have defi nite negative con-
sequences for young children’s behaviors and beliefs.
Those who monitor contemporary television estimate 
that a typical child, watching an average of 27 hours of 
TV a week, will view “8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of 
violence from age 3 to age 12” (Silver, 1995, p. 62). An 
analysis of music television videos found that almost one 
fourth of the videos included images of violence and car-
rying weapons. Video games are especially permeated 
with violent themes. Many video games require children 
to become increasingly adept at killing off characters with 
the use of special weapons or superpowers. Studies suggest 
that long-term exposure to violent video game play is asso-
ciated with lower empathy for others, increased aggressive 
behavior, and desensitization to real-life violence (Carnagey & 
Anderson, 2004; Funk, Baldacci, Pasold, & Baumgardner, 
2004; Swing & Anderson, 2007).

the early years was associated with many positive character-
istics in adolescence, including higher grades, reading more 
books, greater creativity, and less aggression (Anderson, 
Huston, Schmitt, Linebarger, & Wright, 2001).
Many programs—some developed for children and others 
intended for a broader viewing audience—convey positive eth-
ical messages about the value of family life, the need to work 
hard and sacrifice in order to achieve important goals, the 
value of friendship, the importance of loyalty and commitment 
in relationships, and many other cultural values. A number 
of contemporary programs include characters of many races 
and ethnic backgrounds. Many feature women in positions of 
authority or performing acts of heroism. Increasingly, programs 
include characters with physical disabilities who play impor-
tant roles. Through exposure to these programs, children learn 
to challenge social stereotypes and develop positive images of 
people from many ethnic groups (Rosenkoetter, 1999).
Review of Infl uences on Moral Development
In early school age, children are developing an initial moral 
code. The approaches to this issue are summarized in 
Table 7.4. Each contribution highlights an essential element 
of the larger, more complex phenomenon. Learning theory 
points out that an external reward structure inhibits or rein-
forces behavior. Children also learn about how to behave mor-
ally by observing the behaviors of others and noting whether 
those behaviors are rewarded or punished. Cognitive theory sug-
gests that in early childhood, children are most likely to take 
a pragmatic view about whether something is right or wrong, 
based largely on the consequences. However, children can dis-
tinguish between moral transgressions and social convention 
transgressions and do not regard them with the same degree of 
seriousness. Psychoanalytic theory is especially concerned with 
the relationship between parental identifi cation and the devel-
opment of conscience. Drawing on object relations theory, the 
importance of early, loving relationships with a sensitive care-
giver is emphasized as the path through which a child comes 
to value the self and to care about others. Evolutionary theory 
suggests that the human brain has both a rapid, seemingly 
automatic intuitive moral response system that provides the 
emotional basis for moral judgments as well as a capacity for 
more deliberate moral reasoning. The evolutionary benefi ts to 
groups that were able to create moral codes for altruism, caring, 
and reciprocity suggest that these social orientations are highly 
likely to be supported at the genetic and neurological levels and 
readily expressed under conditions of appropriate nurturance.
The research on empathy and perspective taking shows that 
moral behavior requires an emotional and cognitive under-
standing of the needs of others. These prosocial skills help 
children appreciate how other children or adults may be expe-
riencing reality. With this insight, children can modify their 
own actions to benefi t others. Theory and research on paren-
tal discipline suggest that parents promote moral development 
when they establish clear standards, involve their children in 
is provoked and retaliates with aggression that goes unpun-
ished, the child is likely to imitate the aggressive actions. 
Thus, viewing media violence adds new violent behaviors to 
the child’s repertoire. Moreover, when the hero is rewarded 
or viewed as successful because of violent actions, children’s 
tendencies to express aggression are increased (Bandura, 
1973).
Second, exposure to media violence produces a height-
ening of arousal (Simons et al., 2003). The fast action that 
usually accompanies televised violence captures the view-
er’s attention. The violent incident raises the child’s level of 
emotionality, bringing to the fore other aggressive feelings, 
thoughts, memories, and action tendencies. The more fre-
quently this network of elements is activated, the stronger 
will be their association. In some video games, the child 
selects a character and is encouraged to identify with that 
role. Violent acts are repeated over and over, with the pos-
sibility that the child increases the character’s aggressive 
behaviors after each encounter, thereby escalating the level 
of emotional intensity and angry feelings as the play contin-
ues (Bushman & Anderson, 2002). Particularly for children 
who are temperamentally aggressive, watching violent televi-
sion or playing violent video games increases their inclination 
toward aggressiveness in real-life situations (Wittman, Arce, & 
Santisteban, 2008).
Finally, exposure to media violence affects a young child’s 
beliefs and values. Children who are exposed to frequent 
episodes of televised violence are more likely to believe that 
aggressive behavior is an acceptable way to resolve confl icts, 
and they become hardened to the use of aggression in peer 
interactions. They are also more accepting of the use of 
aggression as a response to frustration. Children (and adults) 
who are exposed to media violence are more likely to expect 
that others will be aggressive toward them, to worry about 
being victims of aggression, and to see the world as a danger-
ous place (Huesmann & Skoric, 2003).
Exposure to media violence has long-lasting effects. For 
example, in a longitudinal study, TV viewing habits in child-
hood (ages 6 to 10) were related to adult aggressive behav-
ior 15 years later. The study found a signifi cant relationship 
between extensive exposure to televised violence in childhood 
and later aggressive behavior for both men and women, even 
after controlling for mitigating factors such as intelligence, 
parenting characteristics, and family’s socioeconomic status. 
The more children identifi ed with aggressive TV characters, 
the stronger this relationship to adult aggressive behavior 
(Huesmann, Moise-Titus, Podolski, & Eron, 2003).
Researchers have barely begun to scratch the surface of 
television’s uses to promote prosocial development. There 
is clear evidence that children who are exposed to prosocial 
programming are influenced toward more positive social 
behavior. One study recontacted more than 500 adolescents 
whose television viewing had been studied when they were 
in early childhood. Watching educational programming in

Self-Theory
Objective 3. To analyze changes in the self-theory, with 
special focus on the theory of mind and self-esteem 
during the early-school-age years.
The development of the self-concept is at the heart of psy-
chosocial development. Psychosocial theory provides a 
framework for understanding how the ego is transformed 
dialogue, and try to increase children’s understanding of the 
effects of their behavior on others. Research on television and 
video game violence shows that children who are exposed to 
many hours of violent programming or who engage in many 
hours of violent video game play are more likely to act aggres-
sively, accept violence as a method for resolving confl icts, and 
interpret the behavior of others as having an aggressive inten-
tion. Early exposure to high doses of media violence has long-
term consequences for a person’s tendency toward aggressive 
behavior.

cies as well as by participation in new roles.
The Neuroscience of the Self
While one group of neuroscientists has focused on social 
cognitive functions that support social interaction and the 
ability to understand and predict the behaviors of others, 
another group has been searching for the specifi c regions of 
the brain that create a sense of self. Work by Uddin, Iaco-
boni, Lange, and Keenan (2007) has begun to integrate these 
research areas, suggesting that two separate but interrelated 
brain areas support the capacity for distinguishing the self 
and others, self-representation, and the ability to under-
stand and learn from others. The right frontoparietal area of 
the brain is active when individuals view their own face as 
compared to faces of familiar others. This same area is also 
active in response to images of one’s body and sounds of 
one’s voice. This area of the brain overlaps with an area of 
the mirror neuron system that was described in Chapter 6. 
The mirror neuron system supports the ability to understand 
and replicate the actions and goals of others. Thus, in a self-
recognition task these brain areas are operating in synchrony 
to intensify the experience of the sense of oneself as both the 
perceiver and the perceived (Neiworth, 2009).
Other brain regions are associated with self-representa-
tions including self-recognition, use of personal pronouns, 
expression of ownership (“Mine!”), self-appraisal, judging 
one’s personality traits, and making judgments about the 
mental states of others. Advances in self-representational 
thought in infancy are associated with the maturation of 
these brain regions (Lewis & Carmody, 2008).
Uddin et al. suggest that just as the mirror neuron system 
maps the behaviors of others onto the self, the cortical mid-
line structures map the attitudes and mental states of others 
onto the self. The cortical midline structures are activated in 
a variety of tasks involving self-referential processing, suggest-
ing that this area of the brain contributes to the integration 
of information that is involved in the formulation of a self-
concept (Northoff & Bermpohl, 2004). As one might expect, 
the frontoparietal motor neuron system and the cortical mid-
line structures are connected, facilitating a multidimensional 
understanding of self-other representations. These brain areas 
contribute to the ability for self-recognition, self-other dis-
tinctions, the ability to replicate another person’s actions and 
understand the intentions of those actions, and the ability to 
refl ect upon another person’s experiences and perceptions in 
comparison to our own (Ruby & Decety, 2001, 2004). This 
line of research supports the underlying principle from psy-
chosocial theory of an ongoing interaction between the per-
son and the social environment. At the neural level there are 
a variety of mechanisms for connecting information about the 
self and the other. As self-awareness and self-understanding 
mature, so does awareness of and understanding of the other.
In the sections that follow, the self-theory is discussed in 
relation to the distinction between the me and the I, a gen-
eral description of how the self-theory changes from infancy 
through middle childhood, and the nature of self-esteem—the 
evaluative aspect of a child’s sense of self.
through ongoing interaction with society over the life 
span. It describes the creative process through which very 
rudimentary experiences of the physical self in infancy are 
transformed into self-consciousness, self-control, a sense of 
self—other relationships, a personal identity, a style of life, 
and fi nally a sense of integrity about the life one has lived.
The self-concept can be viewed as a theory that links the 
child’s understanding of the nature of the world, the nature 
of the self, and the meaning of interactions between the two 
(Epstein, 1973, 1991, 1998). The function of the self-theory 
is to make transactions between the self and the world turn 
out as positively and benefi cially as possible. One’s theory 
about oneself draws on such inner phenomena as dreams, 
emotions, thoughts, fantasies, and feelings of pleasure or 
pain. One’s self-theory is also based on logical thoughts and 
information processing such as assessments of one’s abili-
ties, comparisons with others, and analysis of experiences 
with the environment (Epstein, 2003, 2008). When I tell my 
mother that I had a dream about monsters, does she tell me 
not to be ridiculous—that there are no monsters? Or does 
she ask me to tell her all about the monsters—what they 
looked like, how they smelled, what they ate? As I share my 
inner world with others, do they confi rm or disconfi rm my 
reality? Do they validate or invalidate my inner experiences?
The complexity and logic of the self-theory depend on the 
maturation of cognitive functions, which is tied in part to the 
maturation of the brain. Furthermore, because the self-theory 
is based on personal experiences and observations, one would 
expect it to be modified over the life course as a result of

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
Developmental Changes in the Self-Theory
At each stage, the self-theory is the result of a person’s cog-
nitive capacities and dominant motives as he comes into 
contact with the stage-related expectations of the culture 
(Stipek, Recchia, & McClintic, 1992). In infancy, the self 
consists of a gradual awareness of one’s independent exis-
tence. The infant discovers body boundaries, learns to iden-
tify recurring need states, and feels the comfort of loving 
contact with caregivers. Basic needs to maximize pleasure 
and avoid pain and to preserve closeness to the loving care-
giver serve as organizing principles for the infant’s behav-
ior. Many theorists emphasize the close connection of the 
infant’s internal working model of the self with the respon-
siveness of the other (Bretherton & Munholland, 1999). The 
infant relies on the other to be accessible, to permit explora-
tion, and to comfort and reassure. During the second year 
of life, self-recognition and the sense of the self as a causal 
agent add new dimensions to the self-theory. Gradually, 
these experiences are integrated into a sense of the self as 
a permanent being who has an impact on the environment, 
existing in the context of a group of other permanent beings 
who either do or do not respond adequately to the infant’s 
internal states.
In toddlerhood, the self-theory grows through an active 
process of self-differentiation. Children explore the limits 
of their capacities and the nature of their impact on oth-
ers. Because of toddlers’ limited ability to entertain abstract 
concepts and their tendency toward egocentrism (the per-
ception of oneself as the center of the world), their self-
theories are based largely on the accumulation of daily 
experiences of competence, self-directed goal attainment, 
and praise or disapproval. There is little recognition of 
social comparisons (being better or worse than someone 
else), but an increasing sensitivity to the positive and nega-
tive reactions of others.
The Me and the I
One of the earliest psychological analyses of self-theory was 
provided by William James (1892/1961). He described two ele-
ments of the self, the me and the I. The me is the self as object—
the self one can describe—including physical characteristics, 
personality traits, social roles and relationships, thoughts, and 
feelings. The I is the self who is aware of one’s own actions. It 
can be characterized by four fundamental features: (1) a sense 
of agency or initiation of behaviors; the self that experiences a 
sense of voluntary action or free will; (2) a sense of uniqueness; 
(3) a sense of continuity from moment to moment and from day 
to day; and (4) an awareness of one’s own awareness (i.e., meta-
cognition) (Damon & Hart, 1988).
Building on these ideas, Damon and Hart (1988) devised a 
model of self-understanding that includes both the me (self as 
object) and the I (self as subject) changing over time. This model 
is presented in Figure 7.2 as two adjoining charts. Along the 
bottom of the left hand chart—the self as object—Damon and 
Hart identifi ed four domains of the me: physical self (my physi-
cal appearance and observable characteristics), active self (my 
behaviors and actions), social self (my social bonds and social 
skills), and psychological self (my personality, emotions, and
thoughts.) Along the bottom of the right hand chart—the self 
as subject—they identifi ed three domains of the I: continuity 
(experiences that allow me to know that I am the same person 
from day to day), distinctiveness (experiences that illustrate how 
I differ from others and perceive myself to be a unique indi-
vidual), and agency (experiences that allow me to believe that 
I have an impact, that I am a causal agent). The height of the 
charts refl ects the four stages of development during which the 
me and the I mature in each domain: early school age, middle 
childhood, early adolescence, and later adolescence. 
Characteristics of the self as me and I at a particular stage 
of life can be understood by following along one row around 
the cube. Development over time, shown by the vertical 
changes in each of the seven domains, is traced from early 
school age through later adolescence. According to Damon 
and Hart, one can recognize evidence of self-understanding 
in each domain even in early childhood. Development of the 
self is not viewed as a shift in awareness of the physical self 
in childhood to an awareness of the social self at a later age. 
Rather, each domain of the self changes according to the gen-
eral organizing principle around which all aspects of the me 
and the I are synthesized. Self-understanding is transformed 
from a categorical and concrete assessment of the self in early 
school age to a comparative assessment of self and others in 
middle childhood. This is followed by a shift to an under-
standing of the social implications of one’s self-characteristics 
in early adolescence. In later adolescence the organizing prin-
ciple becomes the formulation of a personal and social iden-
tity that integrates the characteristics of the self into a set of 
beliefs and plans that guide future actions. By later adoles-
cence, a dynamic relationship is formed, which links aspects 
of the self-theory, including personal values, experiences, 
and interpretations of life events, to interpersonal relation-
ships and moral choices.
In order to collaborate on a project, children need to be able to 
take the point of view of the other person. As the self-concept 
matures, so does the ability to think about how situations may 
appear to someone else.

inherent distinctiveness in which the self is the fi gure and 
others are the ground. In the interdependent orientation, a 
greater emphasis is placed on the inherent interconnected-
ness of members of the group and an appreciation that one’s 
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors fluctuate based on the 
desire to fi t in to the larger social unit.
For example, one study reported on U.S. and Chinese 
college students’ earliest childhood memories (Wang, 2001). 
The average age for these fi rst memories was 3½ years for 
U.S. students, and 4 years for the Chinese students. The 
U.S. students’ memories tended to be discreet events where 
they had the lead role in a drama of some emotional event or 
moment. The Chinese students’ memories tended to be more 
routine events involving family and neighborhood. Students 
were asked to produce something that they actually remem-
bered, not something someone had told them.
The following is a U.S. college student’s response to a 
request to think of her earliest memory and to describe it as 
precisely as possible. This memory comes from a time when 
the student was about 3.
I remember standing in my aunt’s spacious blue bedroom 
and looking up at the ceiling. Then something caught my 
eye—it was the white wainscoting that bordered the top of 
the wall with the ceiling. I remember staring, fi xated with its 
intricate design. And while I was doing this, all of sudden, 
I had an epiphany, a sort [of] realization. It was almost my 
fi rst realization of a sense of “self.” Because, as I was star-
ing at the ceiling, I realized that no one else was around. I 
remember being taken aback by the ability to amuse myself 
without any toys. (Wang, 2001, p. 220)
The next childhood memory was told by a Chinese female 
college student from the time when she was about age 5.
I was 5 years old. Dad taught me ancient poems. It was 
always when he was washing vegetables that he would ex-
plain a poem to me. It was very moving. I will never forget 
the poems such as “Pi-Ba-Xing” one of the poems I learned 
then. (Wang, 2001, appendix)
Cultural worldviews are preserved in each society’s view 
of the self. In the United States, the self is valued as a unique, 
bounded, autonomous being. Self memories and narratives 
are told to preserve a sense of the self that guides the life his-
tory through choices and action. In China and in other Asian 
cultures, the self is viewed as an interdependent, relational 
being. In these cultures, children are encouraged to show 
restraint in their interactions with certain others, particu-
larly in public situations, in order to preserve social cohe-
sion. Whereas self-expression may be encouraged in private, 
self-control is valued in public (Raeff, 2010). As we think 
about the emergence of a self-theory in early school age, it is 
important to keep in mind that cultures not only shape the 
value placed on certain attributes, but also infl uence whether 
children are likely to think of the self as relatively stable and 
enduring across settings or relatively fl uid and attuned to the 
demands and expectations of the social situation.
During early school age, the self-theory becomes more dif-
ferentiated. Children can distinguish between the real self (how 
one actually is) and the ideal self (how one would like to be). 
They recognize some discrepancies between how they describe 
themselves and how their parents or friends may describe them 
(Oosterwegel & Oppenheimer, 1993). They can differentiate 
among various areas of activities like math, reading, and music, 
indicating perceptions of strength in certain areas and weak-
ness in others (Eccles, Wigfi eld, Harold, & Blumenfeld, 1993).
According to Damon and Hart (1988), in early school 
age the self is understood as an accumulation of categorical 
identifi  cations. No additional linkage or signifi cance is taken 
from these categorical statements—simply a recognition that 
they exist.
EXAMPLES: What kind of person are you? I have blue eyes.
Why is that important? It just is.
What kind of a person are you? I’m Catholic.
What does that say about you? I’m Catholic, and my mother 
is, and my father is, and my grandmother, and my grandfather, 
and I’m Catholic too.
(pp. 59–60)
In middle childhood, the organizing principle shifts to 
comparative assessments. Self-understanding relies on 
comparisons of oneself with social norms and standards or 
with specifi c other people.
EXAMPLES: What are you like? I’m bigger than most kids.
Why is that important? I can run faster than everybody.
What are you like? I’m not as smart as most kids.
Why is that important? It takes me longer to do my homework. 
(pp. 62–63)
The period of early school age brings with it the begin-
nings of self-consciousness. Through conversations, stories, 
photographs, and rituals, early-school-age children begin to 
understand that their experiences have a uniqueness. They 
realize that they exist in a specifi c time, not in the long ago of 
dinosaurs or pioneers, nor in near past of their grandmoth-
er’s or their mother’s childhood (Nelson, 2000).
Culture and the Self-Theory
Certain aspects of culture are thought to infl uence the nature 
of self construal. In many Western countries, values given 
to characteristics such as self-reliance, autonomy, and dis-
tinctiveness shape a relatively more independent view of the 
self. In many Asian cultures, values given to fi tting in with 
the group and preserving harmonious relationships shape 
a relatively more interdependent view of the self (Markus & 
Kitayama, 1991; Martin & Ruble, 1997). In both cultural 
views, individuals are able to differentiate a sense of self and 
other. They are aware of a continuous self who is the same 
today as yesterday, and can make distinctions between a view 
of an inner or private self and a public self. However, in the 
independent orientation, greater emphasis is placed on an

what a character wants, even if it is different from what they 
might want. However, they have trouble thinking about what 
someone else might believe, especially disconnecting their 
own knowledge of the situation from the point of view of 
another. By the time children are 5, however, they are quite 
facile at detecting the possibility of false or incorrect beliefs. 
They can separate what they know about a situation from 
what someone else may know, and they expect that a char-
acter’s actions will be based on the character’s beliefs, even 
when those beliefs are incorrect (Ziv & Frye, 2003).
The ability to appreciate that what you know or believe to 
be true is different from what others know and believe to be 
true is a salient feature of self-awareness. It allows children to 
begin to speculate about what others may think about them, 
and how their behavior may be understood or misunder-
stood. Gender role standards are especially important in this 
regard. Children are very sensitive to any implication that 
they are not living up to the expectations of how a boy or girl 
ought to act. Children are also aware of moral imperatives 
that defi ne good and evil. These cognitive gains make a child 
more sensitive to social pressure, more likely to experience 
feelings of guilt or failure, and more preoccupied with issues 
of social comparison, self-criticism, and self-evaluation. For 
these reasons, the issue of self-esteem becomes especially 
salient during early and middle childhood.
Self-Esteem
For every component of the self—the physical, active, social, 
and psychological self—a person makes an evaluation of 
worthiness. This self-evaluation, or self-esteem, is based on 
three sources: (1) messages of love, support, and approval 
Theory of Mind
From ages 4 to 6, children become more aware that people 
have different points of view. Work on the theory of mind 
focuses on the natural way children understand their own 
mental states and the mental states of others. In day-to-day 
functioning, the theory of mind suggests that children 
attribute beliefs, knowledge, and desires to others, and that 
they begin to understand that a person’s mental state is a 
cause or explanation for their behavior (Wellman, 1990; 
Doherty, 2009). With development, children gradually dis-
cern that another person’s mental state can be different from 
their own. They can begin to appreciate that someone else’s 
behaviors might be based on a set of beliefs that are errone-
ous, or desires that are in confl ict with their own desires.
Research on the theory of mind typically poses situations 
to children to see what they understand about someone else’s 
beliefs and desires. For example, in the early research, chil-
dren watched a character named Maxi put a chocolate candy 
in one location. Then, when Maxi leaves, children watched 
while another character moved the chocolate to a new place. 
Children were asked what Maxi thinks or what Maxi will do 
when he comes back into the room. Where will Maxi think 
the chocolate is located? Where will Maxi look (action) for the 
chocolate? Three-year-olds typically said that Maxi will look 
for the chocolate where they know it is—in the new location. 
Older children, ages 4 and 5, realized that Maxi has an incor-
rect belief and predicted that Maxi will look for the chocolate 
in its old location (Wimmer & Perner, 1983; Wellman, Cross, 
& Watson, 2001).
Subsequent research using similar scenarios has found 
that children as young as 3 are very good at considering 
Experiences of success build 
con fi dence and contribute to 
positive self-esteem. Gloria is 
thrilled to be able to ride her 
big two wheeler even though 
it has training wheels. She feels 
competent, proud of her 
accomplishment, and happy to 
be riding. What other kinds of 
accom plishments are likely to 
contribute to self-esteem at 
this age?

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
Feelings of positive self-worth provide a protective 
shield or buffer against anxiety that is associated with inse-
curity or conditions that threaten to expose one’s lack of 
value or meaning. If a person has a positive, optimistic self-
evaluation, then messages that are negative and incongruent 
with it will be defl ected. People with high self-esteem will 
explain a failure by examining the task, the amount of time 
needed for its completion, the other people involved, or the 
criteria for evaluating success and failure. They use a variety 
of strategies to minimize the importance of negative feed-
back. They do not permit a failure to increase doubt about 
their basic worth. Rather, their high self-esteem functions 
to protect their positive self-evaluation by coping effectively 
with negative feedback and reclaiming their view of the self as 
someone who has socially valued qualities (Brown, Dutton, & 
Cook, 2001).
By contrast, people with low self-esteem feel worse after a 
failure, tend to view failure as new evidence of their lack of 
worth, and are less likely to cope effectively with the negative 
feelings that accompany failure (Heimpel, Wood, Marshall, & 
Brown, 2002). People with low self-esteem appear to accept 
negative moods that follow a failure experience and are less 
likely to take action to try to improve their mood. Because 
negative feedback is so painful for those with low self-esteem, 
they avoid unfavorable comparisons with others, leading 
them to be more cautious in situations that might expose 
them to criticism (Bernichon, Cook, & Brown, 2003).
Despite the many positive correlates of high self-esteem, 
some scholars have questioned whether high self-esteem 
is necessarily a universally positive quality. Some research-
ers have suggested that there is such a thing as unrealistic or 
fragile high self-esteem (Kernis, 2003). For example, people 
with high self-esteem seem to defl ect failure messages in one 
area by emphasizing their abilities in another area (Brown & 
Smart, 1991). When employed consistently, this strategy can 
be perceived as a defensive reaction that allows the individual 
from others; (2) specifi c attributes and competencies; and 
(3) the way one regards these specifi c aspects of the self in 
comparison with others and in relation to one’s ideal self. The 
need to protect and enhance one’s self-esteem is considered a 
basic psychological motive that drives behavior (Greenberg, 
2008). Views of the self as being loved, valued, admired, and 
successful contribute to a sense of worth. Views of the self 
as being ignored, rejected, scorned, and inadequate contrib-
ute to a sense of worthlessness. These early affective experi-
ences build a general sense of pride or shame, worthiness or 
worthlessness, that is captured in the global statements chil-
dren make about themselves even as early as age 3 or 4 (Eder, 
Gerlach, & Perlmutter, 1987; Eder, 1989).
Information about specifi c aspects of the self is accumu-
lated through experiences of success and failure in daily 
tasks or when particular aspects of one’s competence are 
challenged. A young child may develop a positive sense of 
self in athletics, problem solving, or social skills through 
the encouraging reactions of others as well as through the 
pleasure associated with succeeding in each of these areas 
(Harter, 1985a, 1998).
With experience in a variety of roles and settings, each 
specific ability takes on a certain level of importance for 
a person. Not all abilities are equally valued at home, at 
school, and by friends. Children may believe they have 
abilities in some areas but not in those they consider highly 
important. Others may believe they have only one or two 
areas of strength, but they may highly value those areas and 
believe them to be critically important to their overall suc-
cess. Self-esteem is infl uenced by the value one assigns to 
specifi c competencies in relation to one’s overall life goals 
and personal ideals. Thus, it is possible to be a success in 
the eyes of others and still feel a nagging sense of worthless-
ness. Similarly, it is possible to feel proud and confi dent even 
when others do not value the activities and traits in which 
one takes satisfaction.
By the age of 5 or 6, children are trying hard to 
gain acceptance from adults and peers. Even mild 
criticism from a teacher is often enough to arouse 
feelings of guilt or remorse. What kind of teacher 
criticism do you imagine might be taking place in 
this photo?

the expressions of helplessness assessed in kindergarten 
proved to be a good predictor of depression and a low sense 
of self-worth. The implication is that a scheme for low self-
esteem and helplessness may begin to be crystallized in the 
early childhood period and, unless challenged through posi-
tive intervention, may color one’s sense of mastery and com-
petence in the years ahead (Davis-Kean & Sandler, 2001; 
Kistner, Ziegert, Castro, & Robertson, 2001). Young children 
need frequent reassurance from adults that they are compe-
tent, safe, and loved. They need numerous opportunities to 
discover that their unique talents and abilities are useful and 
important, and that they can have a positive impact on others. 
As competencies increase, as thought becomes more fl exible, 
and as the child makes meaningful friendships, self-esteem is 
expected to increase.
Peer Play
Objective 4. To explore the transition to more complex 
play and the process of friendship development in the 
early-school-age years.
Although experiences in the family provide the primary 
information that guides a young child’s construction of the 
social world, interactions with peers contribute important 
opportunities for physical, cognitive, social, and emotional 
development. The quality of play expands during the early-
school-age period, introducing more complex games with 
larger numbers of participants. Children form friendship 
groups that allow them to sustain more elaborate fantasy play, 
experience group confl ict, participate in group problem solv-
ing, and encounter varying ideas about the topics discussed 
previously: gender, morality, and the self. Developmental 
scholars generally acknowledge the value of child-initiated, 
freely chosen play for the young child’s cognitive and social 
development. Nonetheless, playtime at school and at home is 
dwindling. One estimate suggests that young children have 8 
fewer hours a week of unstructured play time today than did 
children 20 years ago (Elkind, 2007; Miller & Almon, 2009). 
What is more, the toys and play resources that are marketed 
for young children are becoming increasingly oriented toward 
specifi c educational objectives such as vocabulary building 
and math facts. Through the insertion of computer chips, the 
play value of many modern toys is controlled in advance by 
the manufacturers rather than invented through the child’s 
active exploration (Winerman, 2009).
Group Games
The early-school-age child continues to use vivid fantasies in 
play. During this period, a new form of play emerges. Chil-
dren show interest in group games that are more structured 
and somewhat more oriented to reality than play that is 
based primarily on imagination. Duck-Duck-Goose, London 
Bridge, and Farmer-in-the-Dell are examples of early group 
to preserve a sense of self-worth rather than to address under-
lying feelings of inferiority or shame (Jordan et al., 2003).
A different criticism concerning self-esteem is that the 
emphasis on high self-esteem is a value that reflects the 
individualist nature of Western culture. In contrast, East-
ern cultures are less concerned with affi rming the positive 
qualities of the individual, valuing instead self-discipline and 
self-improvement (Marku, Mullally, & Kitayama, 1997). A 
pancultural or universalist perspective suggests that it is a 
universal tendency for humans to strive for and protect their 
self-regard. However, the norms for what one considers evi-
dence of self-worth and the strategies that human beings use 
to advance their self-regard are shaped by culture (Brown, 
2003; Sedikides, Gaertner, & Toguchi, 2003; Sedikides, 
Gaertner & Vevea, 2005).
Self-Esteem and the Early-School-Age Child. At each 
life stage, as individuals set new goals for themselves or as 
discrepancies in competence become apparent, temporary 
periods of lowered self-esteem may be anticipated. Although 
we tend to think of self-esteem as a stable trait that char-
acterizes individuals across settings, there are periods of life 
when self-esteem is more vulnerable to fluctuation, espe-
cially as individuals encounter dramatic changes in roles, 
environments, and normative expectations for behavior 
(Trzesniewski, Donnellan, & Robins, 2003). Early child hood 
appears to be one of those periods.
As early-school-age children mature, they move into new 
social and physical environments where they encounter new 
threats to their sense of safety and new sources of evaluation 
about their value and meaning. They have a new awareness 
of the limits of their parents’ ability or willingness to protect 
them. Moreover, they are increasingly aware of the discrep-
ancies between their own competencies and what they rec-
ognize as the skills expected of them by their teachers and 
parents or exhibited by older children. They are able to view 
themselves as objects of evaluation by others. They are also 
aware of the importance of acceptance by adults and peers 
outside the family, especially their teachers and classmates. 
These newly valued others may not be as proud of their skills 
or as understanding about their limitations as are their fam-
ily members. At school, for example, young children often 
make critical comments about one another’s work. Criticisms 
tend to outnumber compliments, and boys tend to be more 
critical than girls of their peers’ work (Frey & Ruble, 1987). 
The combination of open peer criticism and a heightened 
emphasis on peer competition may make school an environ-
ment in which one’s self-esteem is frequently challenged.
For all these reasons, early-school-age children are likely 
to experience feelings of depression and worthlessness. This 
decrease in self-esteem may be a temporary fl uctuation. How-
ever, it may endure. In research with kindergartners, children 
were faced with a challenging task. The way they approached 
the task, their hopefulness about succeeding, and their gen-
eral expression of positive or negative attributes were com-
bined to reflect a measure of helplessness. Five years later,

electronic media by very young children and its impact on 
their social and cognitive development (Dill, 2009; Stras-
burger, Wilson, & Jordan, 2009).
A national survey sponsored by the Kaiser Family Foun-
dation was designed to provide descriptive information to 
address a variety of questions such as: How much time do 
children spend with electronic media? How much autonomy 
do they have in the use of these media? How much do these 
media activities replace traditional childhood activities, such 
as playing outside or reading and being read to (Rideout, 
Vandewater, & Wartella, 2003)? The study was a random, 
national telephone survey of families with children ages 
6 months to 6 years old. The parent who spent the most time 
with the child was asked to complete the survey. When both 
parents spent equal amounts of time, one parent was chosen 
at random to reply.
Almost all the children (99%) had TVs in their homes, 
with 50% having three or more TVs. Children spent on aver-
age 2 hours a day with some type of screen media, about the 
same amount of time playing outside, and about 39 minutes 
reading or being read to. About two thirds of the children 
lived in homes where the TV is on at least half the time, even 
if no one is watching.
Children are not just passive consumers of electronic 
media—they are making choices and affecting their media 
environment: 77% turn on the TV by themselves, 67% ask 
to watch specifi c shows, 62% can use a remote to change 
the channel, and 71% ask for their favorite DVDs or videos. 
By the time they are 4 to 6 years old, 70% have used a com-
puter, and of those who use a computer, 64% can point and 
click with a mouse, and 40% can load a CD or DVD and 
start it playing.
Some homes were characterized as heavy TV households 
where the TV was on always or most of the time. When 
children grow up in homes where the TV is on most of the 
time, they begin watching at a younger age (before the age 
of 1), they watch TV longer, and they read less often and for 
play. Hide-and-Seek, Hopscotch, and Statue-Maker are more 
complex games of early school age. They involve more cogni-
tive complexity, physical skill, and ritual. These games com-
bine fantasy with an emphasis on peer cooperation. Group 
play is a transitional form between the fantasy play of the 
toddler and the team sports and other games with rules of 
middle childhood (Erikson, 1977).
Group games usually include a few rules that are simple 
enough so that a child can use them effectively to begin a 
game and determine a winner without the help of an adult. 
Usually, no team concept is involved. A game is played 
repeatedly, so that many children have an opportunity to 
win. The particular pleasure that children derive from these 
games seems to result more from peer cooperation and inter-
action than from being a winner. Many of these games per-
mit children to shift roles. A child is the hider and then the 
seeker, the catcher and then the thrower, the statue-maker 
and then the statue. Through group play, children experi-
ence the reciprocal nature of role relationships. Whereas 
many of their social roles are fi xed—son or daughter, sibling, 
student—in play with peers, children have opportunities to 
experience a variety of perspectives. The Human Develop-
ment and Diversity box presents a discussion of hopscotch, 
an extremely popular and enduring children’s game that can 
be played by a group and by an individual child.
Media Play
From a psychosocial perspective, development is a prod-
uct of the ongoing interaction of the changing person in a 
changing environment. The media environment is an excel-
lent example of this idea, with children being exposed at 
younger and younger ages to electronic media, including 
television programs and videos designed specifically for 
infants and toddlers, video games, handheld game play-
ers and computer software for toddlers and preschoolers, 
and Internet sites for the very young. A research literature 
is accumulating about the scope and extent of use of these

AN ANCIENT GAME played around 
the world, hopscotch takes children 
from earth to heaven and back 
again. A hopscotch diagram is 
inscribed into the fl oor of the 
Forum in Rome. As the Roman 
empire expanded, soldiers copied 
this or similar diagrams on the 
cobblestone roads in Europe. 
Children have improvised on 
the Roman diagrams, but they 
usually have some type of fantasy 
theme. Across the continents, 
hopscotch has been described in 
16 countries, including the United 
States, Great Britain, Russia, India, 
Aruba, and Nepal, each with their 
own regional variations. Children 
toss their markers, hop over boxes, 
avoid danger areas like hell, moon, 
water, or boxes marked by other 
players, and return to home base 
(Grunfeld, 1975; Lankford, 1996; see 
Figure 7.3). The widespread appeal 
of the game refl ects many of the 
competencies and challenges of the 
early-school-age period.
The game symbolizes the perils 
of early childhood, as children try 
to move ahead in their lives without 
stepping on lines, going outside the 
boxes, or stepping into forbidden 
areas. Children in all cultures must 
balance carefully in order to stay 
within the parameters of their 
socialization.
At the same time, the game 
provides an opportunity to exercise 
mastery. Children are the creators 
of their hopscotch world, and they 
have the skills to conquer it by being 
careful, agile, and having a bit of 
luck. Erikson (1982) would emphasize 
the link in language and thought 
between hopping and hoping. 
Children take a leap of faith as they 
hop from box to box, facing perils, 
overcoming some, failing sometimes, 
and starting over.
Critical Thinking questions
 1. What are some of the elements of 
the game of hopscotch that might 
appeal to a child in the early-
school-age years?
 2. What aspects of development are 
fostered through this kind of play? 
How is physical, cognitive, and 
emotional development stimulated 
through this game?
 3. What are some other games that 
4- to 6-year-olds like to play? What 
aspects of development are 
enhanced by these games?
 4. Hopscotch is a game that can be 
played alone or with others. What 
are some other games that have 
this same kind of fl exibility? What is 
the value of this aspect of a game?
 5. Hopscotch is an example of a 
game that young children play that 
has rules, and many of the rules 
are subject to interpretation. Is the 
marker in the box or out of the 
box? Did you step on a line when 
you jumped? Did you remember 
to jump in every open box? How 
is this process of playing a game 
with rules and making judgments 
about these rules related to early 
moral development? What are 
some moral issues that are likely 
to be confronted in games of this 
type?
 6. What do you remember about 
playing group games when 
you were young? Why do you 
think you have these specifi c 
memories?

of these media. Concerns about the relationship of extensive 
TV viewing to childhood obesity, possible interference with 
social communication and language development, and expo-
sure to noneducational content deserve empirical study. The 
media environment may also contribute to the emergence 
of self-directed goal attainment, new capacities for manag-
ing multiple stimuli at once (multitasking), and new appre-
ciation for music, art, poetry, and the natural environment 
through early exposure.
Friendship Groups
In early school age, friendships are based on the exchange 
of concrete goods and the mutual enjoyment of activities. 
Young children are sensitive to the norms for fairness and 
cooperation among friends, and are more likely to be gen-
erous with their friends than with children they know who 
are not friends (Moore, 2009). Friendships are maintained 
through acts of affection, sharing, or collaboration in fan-
tasy or constructive play. By the age of 4 or 5, children who 
have stable friendships become skilled at coordinating their 
interactions with their friends, creating elaborate pretend 
games, and being willing to modify their play preferences so 
that both members in the friendship have a chance to enjoy 
the kinds of play they like best (Park, Lay, & Ramsay, 1993; 
Vaughn, Colvin, Azria, Caya, & Krzysik, 2001). Children 
may build snow forts together, play dolls or space adven-
tures, or sleep over at one another’s homes. Friendships may 
be broken by taking away a toy, hitting, or name-calling. The 
opportunity to form friendships benefi ts young children by 
enhancing their interpersonal sensitivity, social reasoning 
skills, and confl ict resolution skills (Volling, Youngblade, & 
Belsky, 1997).
Confl icts among Friends. Young children tend to evalu-
ate situations on the basis of outcomes rather than inten-
tions. Therefore, they are often harsh in assigning blame 
in the case of negative outcomes. For example, children 
were asked how much they should be blamed for another 
child getting hurt. The injury took place in six different 
hypothetical situations. In the case of the lowest level of 
responsibility, the child was accidentally hurt by someone’s 
toy, but the owner did not actually cause the injury. At this 
level, 6-year-olds were more likely than older children or 
adults to blame themselves for the outcome (Fincham & 
Jaspars, 1979). Because of this rigid approach to social 
responsibility, peer play is frequently disrupted by quarrels, 
tattling on others, and hard feelings about injustices.
Even though children appear to be drawn into the active 
world of peer friendships, it is an uneven, diffi cult, and often 
extremely frustrating terrain for many early-school-age chil-
dren. For example, many 5- and 6-year-olds participate in 
play fighting. In a study of children’s perceptions of play 
fi ghting, Italian and British children of ages 5, 8, and 11 were 
surveyed about the differences between real fighting and 
play fi ghting (Smith, Hunter, Carvalho, & Costabile, 1992). 
shorter amounts of time. Among 4- to 6-year-olds, 34% of 
those in heavy TV viewing households can read, compared 
to 56% in households where TV is on less often. Thirty per-
cent of children under 3 and 43% of those ages 4 to 6 have 
a TV in their rooms. Many of these children have their own 
VCR or DVD player and video game console as well. DVDs 
and videos are a common part of many children’s lives, with 
25% watching at least one video daily.
Many videos, computer programs, and video games are 
marketed to parents as having an educational value. How-
ever, manufacturers argue that their fi rst concern is that the 
materials have to be fun. They believe that if children don’t 
experience the materials as fun, then the media won’t be 
used and the educational value will never be realized. Parents 
appear to have confi dence in the educational value of these 
resources, seeing them as very important for their child’s 
cognitive development. However, a systematic review of the 
evidence suggests that there are few if any published studies 
that document the advertised educational claims associated 
with these resources (Garrison & Christakis, 2005).
Children’s computer programs and video games seem to 
share certain features. The most popular video games are 
action or combat scenarios, sports, and adventure games. At 
every age, boys spend more time playing video games than 
girls (Cherney & London, 2006). That may be explained in 
part by the fact that 73% of the player-controlled characters 
in the most popular video games are male. In the seven top-
selling games designed for children, all the human characters 
were white (Children Now, 2001).
Studies that focus on the design features of interactive 
games fi nd that experience with these games contributes to 
spatial visualization, visual attention, manual dexterity, and 
early readiness for computer literacy (Subrahmanyam, Kraut, 
Greenfi eld, & Gross, 2001). Most of the video games require 
some reading skills. Speed of response is a feature of many 
games. This rewards children who can think quickly, analyze 
the situation, and make a rapid fi ne motor response. When 
you lose or the turn ends, it is easy to start over and try to do 
better the next time. Many of the games provide immediate 
reinforcement through increasing points, sounds, accumula-
tion of virtual rewards, and access to new screens or levels. 
In some games, children can play with or against each other.
Studies of video game use among young children sug-
gest that children integrate their experiences with television, 
videos, and video games into other areas of imagination and 
creativity. The media themselves are often linked so that 
characters from a movie or television program are integrated 
in computer software or a video game. In role-playing vid-
eos, children may be able to choose a favorite character or 
switch characters as part of the play. Children use images 
from these media in their written narratives, their imagi-
native play, and their conversations with friends (Singer & 
Singer, 2008; Wohlwend, 2009).
Given the extensive exposure to electronic media at young 
ages, additional research is needed to help clarify the impact

children are likely to seek others of the same sex because 
they believe these other children will have the same play 
preferences they have.
At the same time, boys and girls do appear to play dif-
ferently, especially when in same-sex and mixed-sex groups. 
Thus, a preference for same-sex play groups may be fostered 
by feelings of comfort or discomfort as children accumulate 
play experiences. Finally, some cultures discourage girls and 
boys from participating in the same types of play. For exam-
ple, when children in a Brazilian tribal culture play family, 
the boys (husbands) go off to pretend to be hunting and 
fi shing, returning with leaves that are then given to the girls 
(wives), who pretend to cook them and pass them out to the 
boys to eat (Gregor, 1977).
The significance of the formation of same-sex social 
groups is that boys and girls grow up in distinct peer envi-
ronments (Maccoby, 1988, 1990). They tend to use differ-
ent strategies to achieve dominance or leadership in their 
groups. Boys are more likely to use physical assertiveness 
and direct demands; girls are more likely to use verbal per-
suasiveness and polite suggestions. The verbal exchanges in 
all-boy groups are apt to include frequent boasts, commands, 
interruptions, heckling, and generally playful teasing. Boys 
try to top one another’s stories and to establish dominance 
through verbal threats. The interactions in all-girl groups, on 
the other hand, tend to include agreeing with and acknowl-
edging the others’ comments, listening carefully to one 
another’s statements, and talking about things that bind the 
group together in a shared sentiment or experience (Leaper, 
Tenenbaum, & Shaffer, 1999). In mixed-sex groups, boys 
may be less controlling and dominating than they would be 
in all-boy groups, but this may still be more than girls fi nd 
acceptable or comfortable. As a result, girls’ negative views 
of boys are reinforced and their tendency to seek all-girl peer 
interactions increases.
About half the children liked play fighting—a somewhat 
larger number of boys than girls. But about 80% thought 
there was a risk that play fi ghting could lead to a serious, real 
fi ght. This might happen if there was an accidental injury, if 
the play fi ghting got carried away into mean name-calling, 
or if, when one child accidentally hurt the other, the second 
child mistook the injury as purposeful and hurt the fi rst child 
back. Five-year-olds said that if play fi ghting turned into real 
fighting, they would tell an adult. No matter whether the 
other child was a friend or not, they believed that such a 
transgression had to be handled with a serious intervention 
by a grown-up. The older children were more likely to forget 
about it, especially if the other person was a friend.
Sex Segregation Among Friends. One of the most 
noticeable characteristics of young children’s friendship 
groups is that they are likely to be segregated by sex. When 
boys and girls are free to choose play companions, they tend 
to choose others of their own sex. This pattern of same-sex 
social groupings among children is found not only in the 
United States but also in most other cultures (Edwards & 
Whiting, 1988). In one longitudinal study, children at age 4½ 
were found playing with same-sex friends about three times 
more often than with opposite-sex friends. By age 6½, they 
were eleven times more likely to be playing with same-sex 
friends (Maccoby & Jacklin, 1987).
Sex segregation is promoted by both cognitive and 
behavioral factors (Barbu, Le Maner-Idrissi, & Jouanjean, 
2000). Based on the earlier discussion of gender identifi ca-
tion, it is clear that children expect others of the same sex 
to like similar activities, toys, and forms of play. Children 
form internal representations of what boys and girls are 
like as friends and playmates. These internal models guide 
the inferences they make as they engage in peer interac-
tion (Markovits, Benenson, & Dolenszky, 2001). Thus, 
At this age, boys and girls tend to prefer same-sex play companions. Boys enjoy rough-and-tumble play; girls enjoy fantasy-
based, relational play.

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
Initiative
Initiative is an expression of agency—an outgrowth of early 
experiences of the self as a causal agent that continues to be 
demonstrated as children impose themselves and their ideas 
and questions onto their social world. It is a manifestation 
of the I, the executive branch of the self that was discussed 
earlier in the section on self-concept (Damon & Hart, 1988). 
Initiative is the active, conceptual investigation of the world, 
in much the same sense that autonomy is the active, physi-
cal manipulation of it (Erikson, 1963). It can be recognized 
in a child’s curiosity, exploratory behavior, and active coping 
strategies in the face of obstacles (Frese, 2001).
The child’s motivation for and skill in investigation 
depend on the successful development of a strong sense of 
autonomy in toddlerhood. Having acquired self-control and 
self-confi dence, children can perform a variety of actions and 
observe the consequences. They discover, for example, what 
makes parents or teachers angry and what pleases them. 
They may deliberately perform a hostile act in order to evoke 
a hostile response. Children’s curiosity about the order of the 
universe ranges from the physical to the metaphysical. They 
may ask questions about the color of the sky, the purpose of 
hair, the nature of God, the origin of babies, or the speed at 
which fi ngernails grow. They take things apart, explore the 
alleys and dark corners of their neighborhood, and invent 
toys and games out of odds and ends.
One expression of initiative is children’s playful explora-
tion of their own bodies and sometimes of their friends’ bod-
ies. It is not uncommon to fi nd 5- and 6-year-olds intently 
involved in a game of doctor in which both doctor and 
patient have their pants off. Boys of this age may occasionally 
be observed in a game that is won by the individual who can 
achieve the longest urine trajectory. Girls report occasions on 
which they have attempted to urinate from a standing posi-
tion, attempting to imitate how a boy does. Both boys and 
girls engage in some form of masturbation. These behaviors 
are evidence of children’s growing curiosity about and plea-
sure in their bodies and their physical functioning.
Children may express initiative while they are alone, by 
attempting to discover how things work and by building or 
inventing novel devices.
Donald kicked and knocked over an endless variety of 
things at hand. He put a block on top of a toy car, a leaf 
on top of that, then knocked the leaf off. Then he turned a 
truck over on its side, put a block on top of it, moved over 
to the car, stacked three blocks on top of it, and knocked 
the whole structure over. He took the car again, spanked it 
as if it were a doll, knocked it upside down, placed a leaf on 
top of it, then swept the leaf off. He played a little longer in 
this way, then ran out of the garage. (Murphy, 1962, p. 102)
Children may also express initiative in social situations by 
asking questions, asserting their presence, and taking leader-
ship. In one study of social competence, children described 
the strategies they used to enter a peer play group (Dodge, 
Of course, many young children do form friendships with 
children of the opposite sex. These friendships may begin as 
early as infancy or toddlerhood between children who live in 
the same neighborhood or attend the same child care center. 
They are sustained by a compatibility of interests and play 
preferences and may survive the trend toward seeking same-
sex friendships, even during early and middle childhood 
(Howes & Phillipsen, 1992). However, the general prefer-
ence for same-sex friendship groups is an important aspect 
of social development that is established during the early 
childhood years and continues into adolescence (Bukowski, 
Gauze, Hoza, & Newcomb, 1993). Although a boy and a 
girl grow up in the same culture, the same neighborhood, 
and even the same family, the tendency to establish separate 
play and friendship groups fosters the development of dis-
tinctive gender-linked communication strategies and makes 
the achievement of mutual understanding between boys and 
girls diffi cult.
Groups and Dyads. In addition to the preference for 
same-sex friends, boys and girls tend to prefer to interact 
in groups of different sizes. Early-school-age girls seem to 
enjoy dyadic (two-person) interactions over larger groups, 
whereas boys seem to enjoy larger groups (Benenson, 1993; 
Markovits, Benenson, & Dolenszky, 2001). This is not to 
say that boys and girls cannot function effectively in both 
dyadic and larger peer group situations, but when given the 
choice, boys prefer the group and girls the dyad. These two 
confi gurations, the group and the dyad, provide different 
opportunities for intimacy, different needs to exercise dom-
inance and control, and different problems in the coordina-
tion of action. They provide models for different forms of 
adult social relationships—the dyad being associated with 
intimacy between partners or in parent-child relationships, 
and the group being associated with sports teams, work 
groups, and families.
The Psychosocial Crisis: 
Initiative versus Guilt
Objective 5. To explain the psychosocial crisis 
of initiative versus guilt, the central process of 
identifi cation, the prime adaptive ego quality of 
purpose, and the core pathology of inhibition.
As children positively resolve the toddlerhood crisis of 
autonomy versus shame and doubt, they emerge from that 
stage with a strong sense of themselves as unique individu-
als. During early school age, children shift their attention 
toward investigation of the external environment. They 
attempt to discover the same kind of stability, strength, and 
regularity in the external world that they have discovered 
within themselves.

 
The Psychosocial Crisis: Initiative versus Guilt | 275
Guilt
Guilt is an emotion that accompanies the sense that one has 
been responsible for an unacceptable thought, fantasy, or action 
(Izard, 1977). It is recognized as a fundamental moral emotion 
that is usually accompanied by remorse and a desire to make 
reparation for real or imagined wrongdoing. It has the adaptive 
function of promoting social harmony, because it disrupts or 
inhibits aggressive actions and leads people to ask for forgive-
ness or to compensate for wrongs they may have done. In com-
parison to shame, which often is accompanied by strong feelings 
of anger or resentment, guilt is typically tied to constructive 
efforts to repair the harm done to others (Tangney, 2001).
Three theories offer different explanations for the 
dynamics that underlie feelings of guilt (Zahn-Waxler & 
Kochanska, 1990). The psychoanalytic perspective views 
guilt as an emotional reaction to one’s unacceptable sex-
ual and aggressive impulses. These impulses are especially 
threatening during the phallic stage, when hostility and feel-
ings of sexuality toward one’s parents become a focus of the 
child’s wishes and must be repressed.
Second, research on empathy suggests that guilt may be 
awakened at a very early age through emotional arousal and 
sensitivity to another person’s emotional distress. This view 
of guilt based on empathy is not defensive; it is closely linked 
to prosocial feelings and the basic emotional ties between 
infants and their caregivers (Hoffman, 1982).
The third, cognitive perspective suggests that guilt occurs 
when one fails to act in accord with one’s own personal stan-
dards and beliefs. This view supposes a more advanced level of 
self-refl ection and the ability to compare one’s behaviors against 
personal standards. In this theory, guilt begins to be experienced 
in early and middle childhood as children begin to be more 
comparative in their organization and evaluation of self.
Every culture imposes some limits on legitimate experi-
mentation and investigation. Some questions may not be 
asked; some acts may not be performed. Adults’ reactions 
Pettit, McClaskey, & Brown, 1986). Two children were play-
ing a game (they were referred to as the hosts), and a third 
child was asked to enter the room and try to initiate play 
with the others. The entry episode was videotaped and 
coded. The child who tried to initiate play and the two hosts 
were interviewed about the episode and asked to evaluate 
how successful the entry child had been. Three strategies for 
initiating interaction were judged to be effective and were 
associated with other evidence of social competence:
 1. Children established common ground by giving mean-
ingful information in response to questions.
 2. Children engaged in a positive, friendly interchange with 
the others.
 3. Children did not show evidence of negative, irritable 
behaviors. The children who were least successful in 
initiating entry into the play “were disruptive, . . . made 
nagging, weak demands, . . . engaged in incoherent be-
haviors, or . . . disagreed with hosts without citing a rule 
or reason” (Dodge et al., 1986, p. 25).
Children who experience a positive sense of initiative can 
apply this orientation to investigation of the physical as well 
as the social world. They innovate through the creation of 
magic potions mixed together with soap, perfume, pinecones, 
leaves, and other powerful ingredients. They create plays, sto-
ries, puppet shows, dances, and ceremonies. They dress up 
in costumes, entertain company by standing on their heads, 
engage in daring acts by hanging from tree limbs or walking 
on the tops of high ledges, and impose themselves in any and 
all curious and private discussions. They spend time trying to 
fi gure out ways to catch a glimpse of Santa Claus on Christmas 
Eve or the Tooth Fairy when she comes at night to collect her 
treasures. These are the Little Rascals years, when a sense of 
initiative is associated with a naive, exuberant, entrepreneurial 
spirit and a desire to discover, direct, and dominate. All man-
ner of investigation and inquiry is fair game.
Saniosa made her sister cry by calling her a 
bad name. Now she is in her room, thinking 
things over. For most children, occasional 
feelings of guilt lead to wanting to set things 
right and regain positive feelings with their 
family or friends.

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
Young children of depressed mothers express unusually 
high levels of distress, concern, and feelings of responsibil-
ity for others’ unhappiness. Mothers who are consistently 
sad set an example of blaming themselves for most of the 
bad things that happen. Depressed mothers are likely to 
withdraw love when the child has misbehaved—a discipline 
technique associated with high levels of guilt and anxiety 
(Zahn-Waxler, Kochanska, Krupnick, & McKnew, 1990). 
In this environment, children learn to restrict new behav-
iors out of fear that they may cause harm or unhappiness 
to someone else. Children who resolve the crisis of initiative 
versus guilt in the direction of guilt are left to rely almost 
totally on their parents or other authorities for directions on 
how to operate in the world.
The psychosocial crisis of initiative versus guilt highlights 
the close tie between intellectual curiosity and emotional 
development. During this stage, parents and the school trans-
mit the cultural attitudes toward experimentation, curiosity, 
and investigation. They also make demands that direct the 
child’s curiosity away from familial, subgroup, and cultural 
areas of taboo. Children are expected to develop the ability 
to control their own questions and behavior. Whereas vio-
lations may bring disapproval and punishment, successful 
self-control may attract no notice whatsoever. Children must 
develop a strong internal moral code that will help them 
avoid discipline. They must also develop the ability to reward 
themselves for correct behavior. The more areas of restriction 
that are imposed on children’s thinking, the more diffi cult it 
is for children to distinguish between legitimate and inappro-
priate areas of investigation. The only way that children have 
of coping with this problem is to develop a rigid moral code 
that restricts many aspects of thought and action.
The Central Process: 
Identifi cation
The discussion of the developmental tasks during early school 
age points directly to identifi cation as the central process in 
the resolution of the confl ict between initiative and guilt. We 
have introduced the concept of identifi cation in discussions 
of gender identity and moral development. Self-theory and 
self-esteem also develop in the context of social interactions. 
As a result of identifi cation, children internalize salient cul-
tural values. Children at this age actively strive to enhance 
their self-concepts by incorporating into their own behavior 
some of the valued characteristics of their parents. Through a 
variety of processes, including watching the behavior of oth-
ers, imitating others, engaging in activity where others are 
watching, and participating in play, conversation, and prob-
lem solving with others, children form an internal represen-
tation of the self that is coordinated with the representation 
of the other (Sherkow, 2001; Decety & Chaminade, 2003).
There appear to be four substantially different theories 
about the motives for identification (see Table 7.5). The 
fear of loss of love is founded on a child’s initial realization 
determine whether the child will learn to view specific 
behaviors, such as aggressiveness, sexual play, or masturba-
tion, as wrong or acceptable. Children gradually internalize 
cultural prohibitions and learn to inhibit their curiosity in 
the taboo areas. One taboo shared by most cultures is the 
prohibition of incest. Most children learn that any behavior 
that suggests sexual intimacy between family members is 
absolutely forbidden. Even the thought of such a relation-
ship comes to generate feelings of anxiety and guilt.
The child’s curiosity in other domains is limited to the 
extent that the family and the school impose restrictions on 
certain areas of inquiry or action. The psychosocial crisis of 
initiative versus guilt is resolved positively when children 
develop the sense that an active, questioning investigation 
of the environment is informative and pleasurable. Inquiry 
is tempered by a respect for personal privacy and cultural 
values. However, the dominant state of mind is curiosity and 
experimentation. The child learns that, even though certain 
areas are off limits, efforts to understand most aspects of the 
world are appropriate.
Guilt, like other negative poles of the psychosocial cri-
ses, can have an adaptive function. As children grow in their 
sense of empathy and ability to take responsibility for their 
actions, they are able to acknowledge when their actions or 
words may have caused harm to someone else. Normal levels 
of guilt have been associated with positive levels of proso-
cial behavior and high levels of empathy (Tangney, 1991). 
Feelings of guilt generally lead to remorse and some attempt 
to set things right again, to restore the positive feelings in a 
relationship.
Girls and boys may show different patterns in the expe-
rience of guilt, based on different patterns of socialization 
and relationships (Maccoby, 1990). Girls tend to have higher 
levels of empathy and boys higher levels of aggression. Girls 
are socialized to be concerned about others and to pay atten-
tion to preserving connections with them. Thus, they are 
more likely to experience guilt when they have lied or been 
inconsiderate to others. They are also more likely to experi-
ence guilt when they blame themselves for unhappiness or 
confl ict among others. In contrast, boys are socialized to be 
assertive and control the expression of their emotions. They 
are more likely to experience guilt over overt actions like 
fi ghting, victimizing other children or animals, or damaging 
property (Williams & Bybee, 1994).
Some children suffer from overwhelming guilt. They feel 
that each of their questions or doubts about the world is 
inappropriate. They may experience guilt about their own 
impulses and fantasies, even when they have taken no 
actions and no negative consequences have resulted. More-
over, these children begin to believe that their thoughts 
and actions are responsible for the misfortune or unhap-
piness of others. They do not seem to take any enjoyment 
in play, and their play is often characterized by negative or 
sad themes. Excessive guilt is one of the symptoms associ-
ated with early identifi cation of depression in preschoolers 
(Luby, 2010).

 
The Central Process: Identifi cation | 277
similarities, (2) adopting parental behaviors, and (3) being 
told about similarities by others. Increasing perceptions of 
similarity promote stronger identifi cations.
These four motives apply to the process of identifi cation 
at all ages and regardless of the sex of the identifi er or the 
model. For a particular child, one of these motives may dom-
inate, but all four motives are involved in the process. Paren-
tal identifi cation allows children to feel that their parents are 
with them even when they are not physically present. This 
feeling of connection with parents provides an underlying 
sense of security for children in a wide variety of situations.
Viewed from another perspective, identification allows 
children a growing sense of independence from their par-
ents (Jacobson, 1964). Children who know how their par-
ents would respond in a given situation no longer need the 
parents’ physical presence to direct their behavior. Children 
who can praise or punish themselves for their actions are less 
dependent on their parents to perform these functions.
Parental identifi cation affects children’s development in 
two different ways. On the one hand, the closeness with 
parents provides the basis for the incorporation of parental 
sanctions and prohibitions. Once children have integrated 
these guidelines for behavior, they are bound to feel guilty 
whenever they anticipate abandoning them. On the other 
hand, the security that results from strong parental identi-
fication allows children increased freedom when they are 
away from their parents. The child whose parental identifi ca-
tion is strong is more likely to engage the environment, take 
risks, and initiate action.
Identification with parents results in a strengthening 
of the child’s personality. An important outcome of early-
school-age identification is the formation of an ideal self-
image, which psychoanalytic theorists sometimes refer to as 
the ego ideal (Freud, 1909/1955; Sandler, Holder, & Meers, 
1963). The conscience not only punishes misdeeds but also 
rewards actions that bring children closer to some aspect of 
their ideal self-image. The ideal self is a complex view of the 
self as it may be in the future, including skills, profession, 
values, and personal relationships. It is a fantasy, a goal that 
is unlikely to be attained even in adulthood. Nonetheless, 
the discrepancy between the real self and the ideal self is a 
strong motivator. As children strive to achieve their ideal, 
they attempt new activities, set goals that strain the limits of 
their abilities, take risks, and resist temptations that might 
interfere with their desired goals.
The ego ideal is more unrealistic during early school age 
than at later stages. Young children fantasize anything they 
wish about themselves in the future. They take their parents’ 
values literally and use them to project an ideal person of 
mythic proportions. The ideal self may include the strength 
of Hercules, the wealth of Queen Elizabeth II, the wisdom 
of Confucius, and the compassion of Jesus. The lack of real-
istic constraints on the ego ideal allows children to investi-
gate and vicariously experience certain human qualities that 
may always be beyond their reach. As people grow older, it 
is important that the fantasy of the ideal self-image becomes 
of dependence on the parents. A child behaves like a parent 
in order to ensure a continued positive relationship. Eventu-
ally, the child incorporates aspects of the loved one’s person-
ality into the self-concept. The child can then feel close to 
the loved person even when they are not physically together 
(Jacobson, 1964). If a child can be like a loved parent, the 
parent’s continuous presence is not required to reassure the 
child about that parent’s love.
Identifi cation with the aggressor is aroused when children 
experience some fear of their parents. In order to protect 
themselves from harm, they perform behaviors that are sim-
ilar to those they fear. Children identify even with parents 
who are extremely brutal. Because most of the behaviors that 
these children incorporate are aggressive, they often tend to 
be aggressive toward others. This kind of identifi cation may 
give children a magical feeling of power and decrease the 
parents’ tendency to mistreat them. Parents who see great 
similarity between themselves and their children are less 
likely to threaten or harm them (Freud, 1936).
A third motive for identifi cation is the need for status and 
power (Bandura, 1977, 1986). Studies of modeling show that 
children are more likely to imitate the behavior of a model 
who controls resources than they are the behavior of a model 
who is rewarded. The imitative behavior is motivated by a 
vicarious feeling of power experienced when they behave in 
the same way as the powerful model. Within a family, chil-
dren are likely to have personality characteristics similar to 
those of the more dominant parent.
A fourth motive for identifi cation results from the chil-
dren’s need to increase the perceived similarity with their par-
ents (Kagan, 1958). Children attribute a number of valued 
characteristics to their parents, including physical size, good 
looks, special competencies, power, success, and respect. 
Children more readily share these positive attributes when 
they perceive a similarity between themselves and their par-
ents. They experience this sense of similarity in three princi-
pal ways: by (1) perceiving actual physical and psychological

focus specifi cally on intellectual development; however, one 
may assume that the level of questioning that takes place dur-
ing this stage is possible only because of an increase in cogni-
tive complexity. The process of positive parental identifi cation 
promotes the incorporation of cultural norms and strengthens 
the child’s sense of competence. Socialization during this stage 
may either foster a creative openness or an anxious dread of 
novelty.
The Prime Adaptive Ego 
Quality and the Core 
Pathology
As a result of efforts to resolve the crisis of initiative versus 
guilt, children emerge from the period of early school age 
with the benefi t of the prime adaptive ego quality of pur-
pose or the core pathology of inhibition. These predisposi-
tions suggest an orientation that leaves a child with coping 
resources that will support directed, action-oriented problem 
solving or a more passive, self-protective approach to stress, 
in which the child is more likely to allow others to guide the 
course of behavior.
Purpose
Purpose is thought or behavior with direction, and there-
fore, with meaning. “Purposefulness is the courage playfully 
to imagine and energetically to pursue valued goals” (Erik-
son, 1978, p. 29). It is a cognitively more complex exten-
sion of the will gained in toddlerhood, in that it combines 
a sense of agency with a plan. In contrast to the toddler, 
who exercises the will through the mere delight in action, 
the early-school-age child imposes intention and goals on 
action. This is the difference, for example, between running 
around the yard, laughing and shouting—typical behavior 
for toddlers—and saying to a friend, “Let’s play tag,” which 
is more likely for early-school-age children. Toddlers may 
enjoy stacking blocks or splashing in water, whereas early-
school-age children want to turn materials and toys into a 
story or a project. Their actions are going in a direction; their 
play has a plan. Behind the process of planning is a com-
plex sense of the situation, the creation of a goal, strategies 
to achieve it, and monitoring success in realizing the goal 
(Scholnick, 1995). The sense of purpose, expressed in plan-
ning and enacting plans, refl ects a signifi cant expansion of 
the ego into the realm of the present and the future.
A sense of purpose suggests not only that the action 
does have meaning, but also that the person initiating it 
has meaning. Ricky enters a play situation and says, “I have

increasingly attainable, although still beyond what has been 
attained. People who fi nd it diffi cult to modify their ideal 
self-images become vulnerable to personal frustration and 
psychological despair because they are unable to be what 
they wish. Many 6-year-old children may wish to become 
president of the United States. This largely unrealistic fantasy 
is exciting and, for some, ennobling. However, few people 
actually achieve this position. By the time one reaches early 
adulthood, it is important to have developed an occupational 
ideal that is closer to what is actually attainable.
Identification with parents is the process by which the 
ideal self-image and moral prescriptions are blended into the 
child’s personality. When children are unable to control their 
behavior so that it corresponds to the sanctions and ideals 
that they have internalized, they will experience guilt. In 
contrast, when children’s behavior approaches their ideals 
and conforms to internalized sanctions, they will experience 
feelings of self-confi dence that allow them to take initiative. 
The balance between guilt and self-confi dence determines 
the eventual resolution of the psychosocial crisis of initiative 
versus guilt.
The crisis of initiative versus guilt captures the child’s need 
to question existing norms and the emerging feelings of moral 
concern when these norms are violated. This crisis does not

have opportunities to participate in the typical give-and-take 
exchanges that provide a model for cause-effect interactions. 
These babies do not participate in the goal-corrected part-
nership with their caregiver in infancy as part of the attach-
ment process. As a result, by early school age some children 
have a very passive orientation toward play and social inter-
actions. According to Murphy, their inhibition is due to a 
lack of basic early structures or schemes for how to direct the 
fl ow of play or have a positive impact on the course of social 
interactions. These children do not impose organization on 
toys or integrate sensory and motor play into a more com-
plex scenario. They remain focused on the sensory activity 
itself, like digging in the sand, or on the imitation of basic 
behaviors, like feeding the baby.
Inhibited children are likely to emerge as shy, withdrawn, 
and often lonely during the subsequent period of mid-
dle childhood. Without some form of social intervention, 
they become increasingly withdrawn, not knowing how to 
impose their ideas into the ongoing activities of the group, 
and not experiencing the confi dence-building effects of mak-
ing suggestions and having them accepted. Consequently, by 
the end of the early-school-age period, their inhibition pro-
duces new defi cits in social skill development.
APPLIED TOPIC
School Readiness
Objective 6. To analyze the construct of school 
readiness, its relation to the developmental tasks of 
early school age, and the obstacles that may prevent 
children from being able to adapt and learn in the school 
environment.
IN 1989, PRESIDENT George H. W. Bush and the state 
governors created an educational agenda for the United 
States. The fi rst goal was that by the year 2000, all children 
in the United States would start school ready to learn. This 
goal identifi ed the importance of the fi rst years of school-
ing in setting the long-term course for school achievement 
and entry into adulthood as an educated person ready to 
undertake the roles and responsibilities of adult life. This 
goal, which seems positive and appropriate on the face of it, 
has resulted in important dialogue about what is meant by 
school readiness, how to measure it, what obstacles stand 
in its way, and who should be responsible for achieving it 
(Wesley & Buysse, 2003).
Defi ning Readiness
The concept of readiness is a familiar idea in the study of 
development. Typically, the term is used to refer to a time 
when the child’s physical, cognitive, social, and emotional 
Inhibition
Inhibition refers to the restraint or suppression of thoughts 
and behavior. Inhibition is assumed to emerge when parents 
or caregivers use high levels of love withdrawal and guilt-
inducing interactions with their children. These kinds of inter-
actions suggest to the child that the parent’s love, affection, 
and approval are conditional on the child matching certain 
specifi c parental standards. In order to adapt in this kind of 
environment and avoid risking loss of love, the child becomes 
self-conscious and restrained in action. In contrast to the sense 
of confi dence and agency implied in the notion of purpose, a 
child who is inhibited does not want to take the risks associ-
ated with imposing a plan or suggesting a direction, for fear 
that suggestions will result in parental disapproval.
Lois Murphy (1972) proposed that inhibition has early 
origins in the mother-infant relationship. She suggested 
that in healthy mother-infant interactions, mothers take 
care to provide meaningful feedback and consequences for 
their babies’ actions. When mothers are very depressed or 
psychologically unavailable, they may be unable to engage 
in the kinds of consistent, rhythmic behaviors that produce 
early experiences of cause and effect. Their babies do not

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
September of that year. Those who missed the December 1 
date had to wait until the following year. In the 1980s, con-
cern about the quality of education in the United States led 
to an upgrading of the elementary school curriculum. As 
part of this school reform, academic demands for school 
performance were raised, and children were exposed to a 
more challenging curriculum in earlier grades. Many skills 
that had been introduced in fi rst grade are now part of the 
kindergarten curriculum, and more children are having 
trouble meeting the expectations for school performance. 
In efforts to prevent early school failure, some states began 
to administer school readiness tests. However, there is no 
agreement or universal acceptance of a measure of kin-
dergarten readiness, and some educators dispute whether 
any test given to 5-year-olds can accurately predict a 
child’s ability to learn in the school environment (Ameri-
can Academy of Pediatrics, 1995; Pyle, 2002). Intelligence 
is not a stable construct for young children whose cogni-
tive abilities are changing in an uneven pattern across many 
domains. When it comes to school readiness, norm-refer-
enced assessment techniques typically fail to include the 
role of motivation, temperament, social and cultural factors 
that may infl uence the various strategies and processes that 
young children use for learning.
Most 5-year-olds do not read or write, so mass test-
ing is not feasible. Any approach to measuring kindergar-
ten readiness must involve one-on-one evaluation. Many 
early childhood educators emphasize that cognitive skills 
in reading, mathematics, and general knowledge are not 
enough to understand the child’s readiness for school. 
Physical development and motor coordination, social skills, 
maturation are at a level to undertake new learning or to 
engage in a more complex, demanding type of activity or 
relationship. It is sometimes referred to as a critical or sen-
sitive period or a teachable moment. The idea of a sensitive 
period was identifi ed in Chapter 5 in relation to attachment 
relationships, in Chapter 6 in relation to language use and 
toilet training, and in this chapter in relation to gender role 
identifi cation. Vygotsky’s concept of a zone of proximal devel-
opment is another way of conceptualizing readiness; it is the 
next higher level of performance one can achieve with the 
help of more competent teachers.
When thinking about the goal that all children should 
come to school ready to learn, the concept of readiness 
becomes somewhat more complicated. Does it refer to readi-
ness to learn or readiness to start school? One might argue 
that all children—except perhaps those with severe neuro-
logical damage—are both ready and eager to learn. How-
ever, not all children have the combined physical, cognitive, 
emotional, and social skills that allow them to adapt to the 
demands of the kindergarten environment or to succeed at 
the academic challenges of its curriculum without support 
(Bowman, Donovan, & Burns, 2000; Early, Pianta, Taylor, & 
Cox, 2001).
Measuring Kindergarten Readiness
In the past, kindergarten readiness was established largely 
by chronological age. School districts typically established 
a birthday cutoff. For example, if a child was 5 by Decem-
ber 1 of a given year, the child could start kindergarten in

and cognitive skills that support self-regulation. Parents 
tended to emphasize the importance of specific skills—
such as using a pencil or scissors, knowing the alphabet, or 
counting to 20—more frequently than the teachers (Lewit & 
Baker, 1995).
Typically, the teachers’ opinions about kindergarten 
readiness placed greater emphasis on social and emotional 
competence than on skills and knowledge, although these 
expectations differed by geographic region and by teachers’ 
years of experience. Children need to be ready to separate 
comfortably from their parents, interact in a positive way 
with other children, and engage in the appropriate behav-
iors associated with the student role: following directions, 
being quiet when asked, and asking and answering ques-
tions. School success relies more on being able to focus one’s 
attention, express one’s needs and thoughts, and exercise 
what has been described as effortful control than it does on 
being able to count to 20 or name the colors (Blair, 2002; 
Lin, Lawrence, & Gorrell, 2003).
Obstacles to School Readiness
Success in kindergarten is based on a combination of intel-
lectual and social skills, enthusiasm for learning, and the 
motivation to succeed. Most children are excited about going 
to kindergarten and doing well. However, certain demo-
graphic characteristics are associated with the likelihood of 
poor school adjustment, even in kindergarten. According 
to the national study of America’s kindergartners, four fam-
ily risk factors are (1) parents who have not graduated from 
high school, (2) low income or welfare dependence, (3) sin-
gle-parent families, and (4) families where a language other 
than English is the primary language spoken at home (Zill & 
West, 2000).
Forty-six percent of U.S. kindergartners have one or more 
of these risk factors. Having one or more risk factors was 
associated with lower scores in reading and mathematics, 
and poorer health. Children with multiple risk factors were 
more likely to show aggressive behavior in school and were 
judged as having somewhat more diffi culty making friends, 
listening to other children’s ideas, and comforting other chil-
dren than those with no risk factors. Children with multiple 
risk factors were more likely to be described by teachers as 
having diffi culty paying attention or persisting in the com-
pletion of a task and were more likely to be described as 
sometimes or never eager to learn, in contrast to children 
with no risk factors.
Figure 7.4 shows the trajectory of reading scores for chil-
dren from the fall of their fi rst kindergarten year (1998) to the 
spring of their third-grade year (2002) as it relates to the num-
ber of family risk factors (Rathbun, West, & Haausken, 2004). 
As the fi gure illustrates, risk factors are associated with measur-
able differences in reading at kindergarten. All groups improve 
communication skills, and a child’s enthusiasm for learning 
all play a part in how well a child will adapt to the school 
environment. Increasing attention is being given to social 
and emotional resources that support children’s learning 
and ability to cope with the demands of the school envi-
ronment (DeAngelis, 2010). The way a child approaches 
learning, such as task persistence, attentiveness, and orga-
nization; a child’s capacity for self-control and behavioral 
regulation; and a child’s interpersonal skills, such as get-
ting along with others, and being able to express one’s feel-
ings and ideas in a positive way are all aspects of social 
and emotional competence that contribute to school suc-
cess (Ponitz, McClelland, Matthews, & Morrison, 2009; 
Galindo & Fuller, 2010).
To address the question of what kindergartners are able 
to do at the start of school, the U.S. Department of Edu-
cation initiated the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, 
Kindergarten Class of 1998–1999 (Zill & West, 2000). 
A national sample of more than 19,000 kindergartners 
who were attending their fi rst year of regular school were 
evaluated in one-on-one assessments. Information about 
the children was also gathered from parents and teach-
ers. Children were evaluated in reading, mathematics, 
and general knowledge as well as physical health, motor 
development, social skills, problem behaviors, and the 
child’s approach to learning. The hope was that these 
assessments would provide norms for what most children 
can do when they come to kindergarten, and a look to 
the future for how these early abilities may predict sub-
sequent school success. A report of how kindergartners 
performed on each of the areas assessed can be found 
in America’s Kindergartners (West, Denton, & Germino-
Hausken, 2000). Four specifi c skills provide an indication 
of the level of competence that was measured: recognizes 
all the letters in the alphabet; counts to 20 or higher; 
writes (prints) own name; and reads or pretends to read. 
Thirty-nine percent of children ages 3 to 5 who had not 
yet started school had three or four of these skills (U.S. 
Census Bureau, 2003).
Given the lack of an objective, accepted measure or 
screening test, what do parents and teachers think are 
essential markers of school readiness? How can a parent 
judge if a child is ready or should wait a year before begin-
ning kindergarten? In two separate national surveys, par-
ents and teachers were asked what characteristics a child 
needs to be ready to start school. Teachers emphasized that 
children need to be physically healthy, well rested, and 
well nourished as the most important aspects of readiness. 
Beyond that, they emphasized the ability to communicate 
effectively, demonstrate enthusiasm and curiosity, follow 
directions, not be disruptive, and show sensitivity to the 
feelings of other children as important indicators (Lewit & 
Baker, 1995). From the teachers’ perspective, many of the 
components of readiness focus on social aspects of learning

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
during the infancy and early childhood years. Parents need 
to foster a home environment that supports their child’s 
interest and motivation for learning as well as providing 
specifi c opportunities for the acquisition of school-related 
competences. Educators and parents must become partners 
for the optimal development of children, identifying those 
children who are at risk for school failure and making plans 
for integrated, multiyear, multiservice programs to support 
their success.
One such model, described as the CoZi schools, integrates 
the philosophies of James Comer, a psychiatrist, and Edward 
Zigler, a developmental psychologist (Hornblower, 1996; 
Zigler, Kagan, & Hall, 1996). In these schools, the staff 
members reach out to families as early as the last trimester of 
pregnancy. They visit the homes of families, encourage inter-
est in books and educational activities, and talk with par-
ents about child development and child rearing. The schools 
involve parents in school-based activities that meet their 
own needs (e.g., exercise classes, adult education classes) as 
well as the needs of their children. The schools are sites for 
child care, before- and after-school care, and summer pro-
gramming. Staff members take the responsibility of mentor-
ing specifi c children who suffer from neglect or are going 
through unusual family disorganization. These schools have 
redefi ned their role to be a community resource. The goal of 
each child’s educational success is reached by addressing the 
child’s and the family’s broader social, emotional, and physi-
cal needs at the earliest possible moment (Dryfoos, 1999). 
See the Human Development and Diversity box for a discus-
sion of how to support school readiness for children with 
disabilities.
in their reading scores from kindergarten through third grade, 
but the presence of risk factors is associated with an increasing 
gap in reading as children progress through school.
Who Is Responsible for Meeting 
the Goal for School Readiness?
In establishing a national goal for children to start school 
ready to learn, we are faced with the question, “Whose 
responsibility is it to meet this goal?” Do we need to place 
more responsibility on families to provide the early experi-
ences that will foster health, confidence, motivation, and 
cognitive and social development during the fi rst 4 years of 
life? Do we need to place more responsibility on schools to 
work with children where they are by providing the envi-
ronment, services, curriculum, and methods of instruction 
that will facilitate learning for an increasingly diverse group 
of students? Do we need to place more responsibility on 
local, state, and federal government to sustain and expand 
programs such as Head Start, so that more children can par-
ticipate in early educational experiences that help offset the 
negative effects of poverty?
A psychosocial perspective suggests action on all three 
fronts. The child’s chances of success in school can be 
improved if all interacting systems support one another and 
keep the goal of academic success for the widest range of 
students in focus. Schools need to be attuned to the char-
acteristics of their incoming kindergartners and become 
ready schools. Professionals need to identify the cognitive, 
social, and motivational factors that support school success 
and fi nd ways to support development in those domains

School Readiness | 283
ABOUT 5% OF young children ages 
3 through 5 have been identifi ed as 
having moderate to severe disabilities. 
For the 2002 to 2003 school year, 
over 600,000 children of ages 3 
to 5 were being served under the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education 
Act (U.S. Department of Education, 
2003). By defi nition, these children 
are performing at or below the 
50th percentile of their age-mates 
in one or more domains, including 
motor skills, speech and language, 
social and emotional competence, 
and learning and memory (Siegel, 
1996). In the national longitudinal 
study of the kindergarten class of 
1998 to 1999, about 10% of the 
children were identifi ed by their 
parents as having a developmental 
diffi culty. For that study, a child with a 
developmental diffi culty was defi ned 
as one whose parents noted by fi rst 
grade “obtaining a diagnosis from a 
professional for problems related to 
attention, activity, communication, 
hearing, or sight that could not be 
corrected with eyeglasses” (Malone, 
West, Flanagan, & Park, 2006).
The term disability can refer to 
a wide variety of possible functional 
challenges. The two most common 
impairments are speech and language 
delays (55% of those receiving 
services) and developmental delays 
(25% of those receiving services). In 
the study of American kindergartners, 
parents reported that “substantial 
minorities of children are already 
experiencing risks for developmental 
diffi culties, with one in fi ve being 
described as overly active, one in six 
having problems concentrating for 
sustained periods, and one in nine not 
articulating words clearly or fl uently” 
(Zill & West, 2000).
Preschool and kindergarten 
programs that include children with 
disabilities face a signifi cant task—to 
ensure that the inclusion benefi ts the 
child both socially and academically. 
Many children with disabilities are 
mainstreamed in a classroom without 
any provision for encouraging social 
interaction with the other children. 
One of the major concerns facing 
teachers is the ability to promote 
positive social skills, including 
appropriate levels of assertiveness, 
self-control, and cooperation among 
students of varying abilities (U.S. 
Department of Education, 2002). 
The school setting makes specifi c 
demands on children to function in 
more constrained, regulated ways 
than might be required at home. 
Some children benefi t from the 
routine and predictability of the 
school setting, whereas others have 
diffi culty regulating their behavior 
to comply with teacher and peer 
expectations.
Effective inclusion requires 
strategies for promoting contact 
between students with and without 
disabilities and creating an accepting 
social climate among students. The 
interventions must be tailored to 
address the unique areas of defi cit. A 
child with autism, for example, may 
need to be taught how to imitate 
a model and may have diffi culty 
cooperating with peers, but might 
be able to play successfully with 
puzzles or to listen to the teacher 
read a story. A child with moderate 
neurological defi cits may have 
diffi culty with tasks that require fast 
reaction time, such as competitive 
games among students, but could 
perform well if speed of response is 
not a concern. Children with speech 
and language diffi culties may fi nd it 
diffi cult to express themselves or to 
engage in conversation with peers. 
As a result, they may withdraw 
from social interactions. Teachers 
need to fi nd ways to build on each 
child’s level of performance so that 
the child is not stigmatized for a 
disability and continues to make 
progress toward an appropriate 
academic standard.
Critical Thinking questions
 1. What kinds of accommodations 
do schools have to make for chil-
dren who have been identifi ed 
as having serious, moderate, and 
mild disabilities? You may want 
to contact someone at a local el-
ementary school or the school you 
attended to fi nd out what they are 
required to provide. How might 
this have changed since you were 
in elementary school?
 2. What might be some of the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of 
mainstreaming early-school-age 
children as compared to placing 
these children in special education 
classes?
 3. What are some of the challenges 
to effective inclusion? How might 
a course in human development 
help teachers meet these 
challenges?
 4. What ideas do you have about 
how to support the social and 
academic goals of inclusion while 
still meeting the unique needs of 
children who have specifi c dis-
abilities? What might be some 
specifi c ways to support children 
with the following disabilities: 
autism, developmental delays, 
speech and language diffi culties, 
and motor or sensory diffi culties.
 5. How might parents of children who 
have developmental diffi culties 
work with school professionals to 
help support their child’s academic 
and social development?

CHAPTER 7 Early School Age (4 to 6 Years)
Chapter Summary
Early school age marks the beginning of work on develop-
mental tasks that will persist well into adulthood. The four 
tasks of early school age are closely interrelated.
Objective 1. To describe the process of gender identi-
fi cation during early school age and its importance for 
the way a child interprets his or her experiences.
The complex process of gender identifi cation has cognitive, 
affective, physical, and interpersonal elements. As young 
children clarify the content of their gender identity, they 
create a set of beliefs about the self, including their self-
worth, relationships with other children, and the kinds of 
activities and interests that are appropriate for them, not 
only in the present but also in the future. The gender iden-
tity of the early-school-age child will be revised and reinte-
grated as it becomes a core element of personal identity in 
adolescence.
Objective 2. To describe the process of early moral 
development, drawing from theories and research to 
explain how knowledge, emotion, and action combine to 
produce internalized morality.
The development of conscience, with its capacity to reward 
and punish, brings an internalization of moral standards. 
Moral development is accompanied by a heightened sensi-
tivity to violating basic cultural standards, many of which 
relate to interpersonal behavior, especially toward adults and 
peers. The child’s experiences with transgressions, guilt, or 
praise for prosocial behavior have implications for the elab-
oration of the self-theory and particularly for the establish-
ment of self-esteem.
Objective 3. To analyze changes in the self-theory, with 
special focus on the theory of mind and self-esteem 
during the early-school-age years.
Although the self-theory is continuously revised with entry 
into new roles and the emergence of new cognitive capaci-
ties, the establishment of a positive sense of worth in early 
school age brings an important tone of optimism as the child 
faces new challenges. Competence and social acceptance are 
the essential antecedents of self-esteem.
Objective 4. To explore the transition to more complex 
play and the process of friendship development in the 
early-school-age years.
Play takes on new complexities including games with rules 
and multiple roles, exposure to diverse forms of media, and 
participation in friendship relationships. Increased involve-
ment with peers brings about an appreciation of others’ per-
spectives, social acceptance, and delight in the intimacy of 
friends as well as new experiences with confl ict and confl ict 
resolution. Children’s sense of initiative and purpose are 
refl ected in the ways they actively create their social environ-
ment through their choice of games, media entertainment, 
and friends. The social worlds of boys and girls become 
notably distinct as gender preferences are expressed in differ-
ent patterns of play and play companions.
Objective 5. To explain the psychosocial crisis 
of initiative versus guilt, the central process of 
identifi cation, the prime adaptive ego quality of 
purpose, and the core pathology of inhibition.
The psychosocial crisis of initiative versus guilt has direct 
implications for such essential personality characteristics as 
self-esteem, creativity, curiosity, and risk taking. The child who 
resolves this crisis positively will be fortifi ed with an active, 
exploratory approach to the environment. Guilt plays an 
important role in orienting children toward the implications 
of their actions for others. In moderation, guilt is an essential 
ingredient in preserving social bonds. In the extreme, how-
ever, guilt restricts creative thought and limits action.
Objective 6. To analyze the construct of school readiness, 
its relation to the developmental tasks of early school age, 
and the obstacles that may prevent children from being 
able to adapt and learn in the school environment.
The applied topic of school readiness illustrates the potential 
confl ict between development and socialization. The society 
has determined that 5-year-old children will attend school. 
At the same time, 5-year-olds are at a wide array of devel-
opmental levels, bringing them to the door of the school 
with substantial differences in physical, cognitive, social, and 
emotional competence. Factors such as disabilities, poverty, 
and a non-English-speaking home environment may all com-
plicate the child’s ability to adapt to the school environment.

 1. What are some examples of the interconnections among 
the developmental tasks of this stage? Think about how 
gender identifi cation, moral development, and peer play 
infl uence a child’s self-theory, and how the self-theory 
might infl uence these other areas.
 2. How might the biological system, including physical ap-
pearance, disabilities, motor development, and health, 
affect a child’s ability to master the developmental tasks 
of this age?
 3. What are your earliest recollections about your own 
moral development? What factors were most important 
in shaping what you believed to be right and wrong? Did 
you develop a sense of yourself as a good or a naughty 
child? What diffi culties did you face in trying to comply 
with the standards for good behavior?
 4. Think about the crisis of initiative versus guilt. What 
does it mean to you? What would you look for in a child’s 
behavior or conversation that would indicate a strong 
sense of initiative or guilt? How do you distinguish ini-
tiative from autonomy? How is the concept of initiative 
related to challenges for coping and adaptation that are 
required in adulthood?
 5. Consider the role of the media as part of the child’s 
family environment. What is the bidirectional nature of 
infl uence between children and the media? What role 
did the media play in structuring your own childhood? 
How did you make use of the media to meet your own 
needs?
 6. What would you do to foster a child’s sense of initiative 
and purpose in the transition to kindergarten? How does 
a caring community promote early school achievement 
for diverse learners? How can you conceptualize the bio-
logical, psychological, and societal factors that interact to 
shape the transition to kindergarten?

Under the guidance of parents and other adults, in middle childhood 
children gain confi dence in their ability to master new skills and 
perform valued work. Friendship formation is another domain that 
requires children’s attention, effort, and persistence as the required 
social skills become more complex.

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
THE THEORIES OF Jean Piaget and Erik Erikson stim-
ulated developmental research focusing on children 
ages 6 through 11. These theories emphasize intellec-
tual growth and a growing investment in mastery and 
competence. During this time, children are learning 
the fundamental skills that are valued in their culture, 
whether those are reading, writing, and arithmetic or 
hunting, fi shing, and weaving. As children gain confi -
dence in their abilities, they begin to have more realis-
tic images of their potential contributions to the larger 
community.
For many children, this is a joyful, vigorous time. The 
fears and vulnerabilities of their early school days are be-
hind them. Energized by ego qualities of hope, will, and 
purpose, most children are able to enjoy many of the re-
sources and opportunities of their communities. Even as 
the presence of their family members continues to be a 
comfort to them, they begin to explore more complex 
social relationships with their peers and other signifi cant 
adults.
In some parts of the world, however, life in middle 
childhood is marked by extreme disorganization and 
exploitation. Children are vulnerable to the violence 
of war as victims of terrorist attacks, civil wars, injury 
from explosions of abandoned land mines, and forced 
enlistment as soldiers among warring tribes (Pearn, 
2003; Beah, 2007). Slavers travel through impover-
ished areas, kidnapping, buying, or luring children into 
forms of slave-like labor where they are often beaten 
or sexually abused. Children of impoverished fami-
lies are being sold or given away as slaves or bonded 
laborers. An estimated 60 million children worldwide 
are involved in the harshest forms of slave labor and 
bondage, used in armed conflicts and in the service 
of drug trafficking, as well as in all forms of hazardous 
work (Human Rights Watch, 2004). Tens of thousands 
of young children in West Africa have been kidnapped 
and sold into slavery to work in cocoa farms, where 
their labor contributes to the production of the choco-
lates that children worldwide love (Bess, 2001). With 
the signing of the Optional Protocol to the Conven-
tion on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict by X countries, the docu-
mented forced participation of children in armed con-
flicts was reduced from 27 wars in 2004 to 17 wars in 
2007. Nonetheless, even now tens of thousands of 
children are forced into armed conflicts in which they 
not only witness bloodshed, but may be used as sol-
diers, spies, messengers, informants, and soldiers’ 
“wives” (Smith, 2001; Human Rights Watch, 2006; Co-
alition to stop the use of child soldiers, 2008; Annan, 
Brier, & Aryemo, 2009). 
In such circumstances, the opportunity for chil-
dren to work on the developmental tasks of friendship 
formation, concrete operational reasoning, skill learn-
ing, self-evaluation, and team play may be viewed as 
 1. To clarify the role of friendship in helping children to 
learn to take the point of view of others, be sensi-
tive to the norms and pressures of the peer group, 
experience closeness in relationships, and clarify the 
negative consequences that result from social rejec-
tion and loneliness.
 2. To describe the development of concrete opera-
tional thought, including conservation, classifi cation 
skills, mathematical reasoning, and the child’s ability 
to understand and monitor his or her own knowl-
edge and understanding.
 3. To analyze the nature of skill learning, including the 
presentation of a model for the process of acquisi-
tion of complex skills such as reading and examina-
tion of societal factors that provide the context in 
which skill learning occurs.
 4. To examine the development of self-evaluation skills, 
including feelings of pride, self-effi cacy, and ways 
that social expectations of parents, teachers, and 
peers contribute to a child’s self-evaluation.
 5. To describe a new level of complexity in play as chil-
dren become involved in team sports and athletic 
competition, and form more enduring in-group and 
out-group attitudes.
 6. To explain the psychosocial crisis of industry versus 
inferiority; the central process through which the 
crisis is resolved; education; the prime adaptive ego 
quality of competence; and the core pathology of 
inertia.
 7. To explore the impact of exposure to violence on 
development during middle childhood.

children. ■
a great luxury. We do not know much about the de-
velopmental outcomes for these children. Having the 
time, resources, and security to promote areas of cog-
nitive, social, and emotional development is possible 
Developmental Tasks
New developmental tasks emerge as children become focused 
on friendship formation, concrete mental operations, skill 
learning, self-evaluation, and team play. This mix of tasks 
coupled with new capacities for complex social, emotional, 
and intellectual activity produce a remarkable synergy. 
Whereas play dominates the behavior of early-school-age 
children, middle childhood is characterized by more pur-
poseful, industrious behavior such as earning money for 
completing chores, planning and building toys, gardens, 
or play spaces, or participating in competitions, perfor-
mances, and community events. This is not to say that play 
is lost. New thrills and excitement accompany the capacity 
to engage in more complex forms of play and games, and to 
take new risks—riding one’s bike farther from home, jump-
ing and then diving into a pool from the high board, or rid-
ing on the big, fast rollercoasters without a parent.
Friendship
Objective 1. To clarify the role of friendship in helping 
children to learn to take the point of view of others, be 
sensitive to the norms and pressures of the peer group, 
experience closeness in relationships, and clarify the 
negative consequences that result from social rejection 
and loneliness.
Can you remember some things about a friend you had when 
you were 9 or 10 years old? Friendships of middle childhood 
are often quite memorable. At this age, children describe 
close friends as people who play together, like the same 
activities, share common interests, enjoy each other’s com-
pany, and count on each other for help. Peer relationships 
include forming meaningful dyadic and group relationships, 
participating in larger peer networks, and experiencing peer 
acceptance or rejection (Gifford-Smith & Brownell, 2003).
Friendships clearly provide social and developmen-
tal advantages (Berndt & Murphy, 2002; Hruschka, 2010). 
Human beings are social animals whose development is intri-
cately dependent on a network of close, supportive social 
relationships. In middle childhood, the radius of signifi cant 
relationships expands to include classmates, teammates, 
and close friends. According to ethological theory, being a 
member of a group has protective advantages. Group coop-
eration gives a selective advantage to many social species, 
especially in tracking and hunting for food. Therefore, the 
skills of cooperation and sociability may advance the species 
as a whole as well as the individual. On an individual level, 
children who are able to participate in positive peer friend-
ships are embedded in an intellectually and socially stimulat-
ing environment. For children who have caring, responsive 
relationships with their family members, friendships provide 
additional reassurance about being integrated into the social 
community.
Family Infl uences on Social Competence
Not all children enter middle childhood with the same 
capacity to make friends and enjoy the benefi ts of close peer 
relations. Early family experiences, including the quality 
of a child’s attachment, the family’s approach to discipline, 
and the nature of family conversations, all contribute to a 
child’s social competence. By social competence, we mean 
all the skills involved in the child’s ability to form and 
maintain positive relationships with others (Bloom, 2009). 
Social competence includes the ability to alter one’s behav-
ior to conform to the norms and expectations for interac-
tions in various settings, and with different social partners. 
For example, a socially competent child can be friendly but 
not overly friendly with an unfamiliar child, or respectful 
but not overly intimidated with an unfamiliar adult. Social 
competence includes strategies for initiating an interaction 
as well as for sustaining and building an ongoing relation-
ship. Social competence also involves the ability to manage 
occasional social diffi culties, such as being teased, excluded, 
or ignored. The features of social competence change as chil-
dren mature, because the expectations for social behavior 
change with a child’s age, and the social settings a child is 
likely to encounter become more diverse. 
Children who have secure attachments in infancy appear 
to be more socially competent in preschool as evidenced 
by their greater popularity and their ability to engage more 
freely in social interactions. They are perceived as more help-
ful and better able to consider the needs of others (Sroufe & 
Fleeson, 1986; Park & Waters, 1989). By age 10, the children 
who were securely attached in infancy have more friends 
than those with insecure attachments, indicating greater lev-
els of social competence. Various studies have suggested that 
when two children with histories of secure attachments are 
friends with one another, those friendships are likely to be 
more responsive, less critical, and offer more companionship 
than friendships between children whose attachment his-
tory is mismatched (e.g., secure-insecure) (Berlin & Cassidy, 
1999).

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
companions, and play activities of their older siblings, bring-
ing them into contact with more mature play partners at a 
young age. Depending on the age differences among siblings, 
many older siblings are expected to play a nurturing or pro-
tective role for their younger siblings, thereby advancing their 
own sense of responsibility and competence. Some families 
deliberately try to foster close sibling friendships by planning 
family activities and encouraging at-home play time. 
The study of sibling relationships is extremely diffi cult 
given the many possible confi gurations of sibling order, sib-
ling spacing, sex composition of siblings, and family values 
regarding sibling relationships. There are few consistent 
results linking birth order to personality characteristics. 
What is more, relationships among siblings change over 
time as siblings develop new levels of social understanding. 
However, it makes sense to consider that children learn pat-
terns of peer interaction with their siblings that they bring 
to the larger arena of peer relationships at school or in the 
neighborhood. For example, firstborns are more likely to 
be self-assured in their position in the family whereas later-
borns, having less power or authority, need to devise unique 
strategies to get their needs met or opinions heard. The 
more positive the quality of a sibling relationship, the more 
likely the siblings are to use compromise or reconciliation to 
resolve confl icts; confl icts between siblings who do not like 
each other are more likely to result in aggression or submis-
sion, often with one child in tears (Recchia & Howe, 2009). 
In contrast to children with siblings, only children have 
less experience handling the day-to-day confl icts that arise 
among siblings, leaving them less prepared to manage peer 
confl icts outside the family (Kitzmann, Cohen, & Lockwood, 
2002). Results from two large studies fi nd that in adulthood, 
people are likely to form close friendships and romantic rela-
tionships with other people of the same birth order (Hart-
shorne & Salem-Hartshorne, 2009). This is an indication 
that people learn patterns of social interaction in their sibling 
relationships that contribute to their social competence and 
provide a foundation for the establishment of intimacy. 
Three Contributions of Friendship to 
Social Development
Children learn at least three lessons from daily interactions 
with their peers. The fi rst lesson is an increasing appreciation 
of the many points of view represented in the peer group. 
As children play together, they discover that there may be 
several versions of the same song, different rules for the same 
game, and different customs for the same holiday. In learning 
about others through the friendly exchange of ideas, children 
also learn about themselves. The second lesson teaches chil-
dren to be sensitive to the social norms and pressures of their 
peer group. The third lesson is the value of emotional close-
ness to a peer (Bukowski, 2001).
Perspective Taking and Cognitive Flexibility. The 
behavior of well-adjusted, competent children is maintained 
A mother’s discipline techniques, the way she speaks 
to her child, and her parenting values are all linked to a 
child’s development of social competence. Children whose 
mothers interact with them in positive, agreeable ways and 
openly express their feelings are likely to have more posi-
tive friendship relations than children whose mothers are 
harsh or neglectful. These patterns are observable as early 
as preschool and continue to be found in the elementary 
grades (Youngblade & Belsky, 1992). In contrast, moth-
ers who use power-assertive discipline techniques and who 
believe that aggression is an acceptable way of resolving con-
fl icts have children who expect to get their way by assert-
ing power in peer confl icts (Dishion, Patterson, Stoolmiller, 
& Skinner, 1991; Haskett & Kistner, 1991; McCloskey & 
Stuewig, 2001). Observations of the social relationships of 
8- to 12-year-old children who had been physically abused 
indicate that these children demonstrate impaired social 
competence. These children had lower ratings of social sta-
tus among their peers and were described by their peers as 
being aggressive and uncooperative, and by their teachers as 
showing noticeable behavior problems (Salzinger, Feldman, 
Hammer, & Rosario, 1993). A parent’s discipline technique 
may infl uence what a child expects in a social interaction. 
Children who have been exposed to aggressive parenting or 
violence between their parents may believe that these same 
strategies will work to establish control and compliance with 
their peers. As a result, these children are more likely to have 
confl icts with their friends and to experience social rejection 
because of their aggressiveness. 
Children may directly imitate their parents’ interper-
sonal communication styles and positive or aggressive 
behaviors. If parents ask a lot of questions and invite their 
child’s opinions, for example, the child may be more likely to 
show interest in others’ ideas and opinions. One study asked 
children and parents to describe characteristics of parental 
conflict, and related this to the child’s friendship quality 
(Kitzmann & Cohen, 2003). Children who perceived their 
parents’ conflicts as poorly resolved (e.g., “Even after my 
parents stop arguing, they stay mad at each other”) also had 
diffi culty resolving confl icts in their own close friendships. 
Children’s perceptions of poor parental confl ict resolution 
were correlated with lower friendship quality, including see-
ing their friends as less of a source of companionship, help, 
or intimacy.
Parents who are highly restrictive and who try to con-
trol their children’s behavior are less likely to permit their 
children to have frequent or diverse peer social interactions. 
Thus, these children may arrive at the middle childhood 
years with less experience in peer play (Hart, Ladd, & Burle-
son, 1990; McCloskey & Stuewig, 2001).
Although parent-child relationships play an important 
role in the development of social competence, sibling rela-
tionships are also important. When asked about their close 
friends, many adolescents mention their siblings. Sibling 
relationships provide opportunities for social interactions. 
Younger siblings are likely to be exposed to the toys, play 

 
Developmental Tasks | 293
The benefi t of these interactions is most likely to occur when 
peers have differences in perspective that result in confl icts 
that must be resolved. The benefi ts are especially positive for 
children who interact with slightly more competent peers 
who can introduce more advanced or fl exible approaches to 
problem solving (Tudge, 1992).
Perspective-taking ability improves other social skills 
that contribute to the quality of a child’s social relationships. 
Such skills include the ability to analyze social problems, 
empathize with the emotional state of another person, under-
stand that others may construe a situation differently because 
of their own information or beliefs, and accept individual dif-
ferences in personality or abilities (Chalmers & Townsend, 
1990; Wellman, 1990; Pillow, 1991; Montgomery, 1993). 
Children who are sensitive to the variety of perspectives that 
coexist in a social situation are also likely to be more posi-
tively evaluated and trusted by their peers. Those who are 
perceived as more trustworthy and attuned to the concerns 
of others are likely to form more friendships (Rotenberg, 
McDougall, Boulton, Vaillancourt, Fox, & Hymel, 2004). 
An interactive process is thus set in motion. Children who 
have opportunities to participate in peer friendships make 
progress in achieving new levels of interpersonal under-
standing. As interpersonal understanding grows, children 
acquire the skills and sensitivity with which to be more effec-
tive with—and usually more valued by—their peers.
Social Norms and Peer Group Pressure. The peer 
group evolves norms for acceptance and rejection. As 
in part by a number of social cognitive abilities, including 
social perspective taking, interpersonal problem solving, 
information processing, and communicative competence. 
These cognitive abilities foster a child’s entry into success-
ful peer interactions. At the same time, active participation 
with peers promotes the development of these social cog-
nitive abilities. In a longitudinal study of the influence of 
friendship on motivation and school adjustment, students 
who had a reciprocated friendship in sixth grade showed 
greater prosocial behavior, higher academic achievement, 
and less emotional distress than those who had no recip-
rocated friendship. The children whose friends had high 
levels of prosocial behavior in sixth grade were more likely 
to express prosocial goals for themselves in eighth grade 
(Wentzel, Barry, & Caldwell, 2004).
You may recall the discussion of perspective taking 
from Chapter 7 as one of the key factors that contributes 
to moral development, especially moral reasoning. As chil-
dren interact with peers who see the world differently, they 
begin to understand the limits of their own points of view. 
Piaget (1932/1948) suggested that peers have an important 
infl uence in diminishing one another’s self-centered outlook 
precisely because they interact as equals. Children are not 
forced to accept one another’s ideas in quite the same way 
as they are with adults. They argue, bargain, and eventually 
compromise in order to maintain friendships. The opportu-
nity to function in peer groups for problem solving and for 
play leads children away from the egocentrism of early child-
hood and closer to the eventual fl exibility of adult thought. 
These brothers are starting 
the fi rst day of the new school 
year. The older brother, who 
has been to this school before, 
will be there to reassure his 
younger brother. The younger 
brother will be comforted to 
know that his older brother 
is nearby. After a few weeks, 
they will each form their own 
sphere of friends, but at the 
beginning it’s reassuring to 
have sibling support.

strategy. Children are given a roster of the names of their 
classmates and asked to circle the names of children who are 
their friends. When two children circle each other’s names, 
they are identifi ed as friends. Close friendships are then 
identified by the children as those characterized by high 
levels of shared activity, companionship, help or guidance, 
and ease of confl ict resolution (Asher & Paquette, 2003). In 
the context of these friendships, children share private jokes, 
develop secret codes, tell family secrets, set out on adven-
tures, and help each other in times of trouble. They enjoy 
spending time together. They also fi ght, threaten, break up, 
and reunite.
Sullivan (1949) pointed out the significance of these 
early friendships as building blocks for adult relationships. 
Intimacy in best friend relationships provides a degree of 
understanding and openness that is often not possible with 
parents or family members. Within these friendships, private 
thoughts and fantasies are shared without the worry of being 
judged as silly, gross, or impractical. It is signifi cant that the 
child experiences love for and closeness to a peer rather than 
an adult. The relationship is more likely to allow for mutual-
ity of power, status, and access to resources (Youniss, 1980). 
Confl icts in a relationship may be worked out in terms that 
the children control. One child cannot take away another 
child’s allowance or send the other child out of the room 
when a confl ict arises. The children must resolve their dif-
ferences within the framework of their commitment to each 
other.
The stability of close friendships is quite variable, with 
some children remaining friends over several years, despite 
changes in classrooms and schools, whereas other children 
seem to be in different friendship relationships every few 
months (Kindermann, 1996). The structure of a school or 
classroom influences friendship formation and stability. 
children become aware of these norms, they begin to expe-
rience pressure to conform to the peer group. Adults, par-
ticularly teachers, then lose some of their power to infl uence 
children’s behavior. In the classroom, the early-school-age 
child focuses primarily on the teacher as a source of approval 
and acceptance. By age 9 or 10, children perceive the peer 
group as an equally signifi cant audience. Children often play 
to the class instead of responding to the teacher. The roles of 
class joker, class snob, and class hero or heroine emerge dur-
ing middle childhood and serve as ways of gaining approval 
from the peer group.
The need for peer approval becomes a powerful force 
toward conformity. Children learn to dress, talk, and joke in 
ways that are acceptable to their peers. They learn to inhibit 
the expression of certain emotional reactions— especially 
sadness, vulnerability, and anger—in order to present a 
cool, competent public image to their peers (Salisch, 2001). 
Heterosexual antagonism, which is common at this stage, is 
perpetuated by pressures toward conformity. If all the fi fth-
grade boys hate girls, Johnny is not very likely to admit 
openly that he likes to play with Mary. There are indications 
that perceived pressures to conform are stronger in the fi fth 
and sixth grades than at later times, even though the impor-
tance of specifi c peer groups has not yet peaked (Gavin & 
Furman, 1989).
Close Friends. Peer acceptance is not the same thing as 
close friendship (Gifford-Smith & Brownell, 2003). To gain 
peer acceptance, children may need to conform to group 
norms for dress, action, and attitude; they may have to 
conceal certain strong feelings (Lansford & Parker, 1999; 
Salisch, 2001). With close friends, there is a more intimate 
level of disclosure, trust, and supportiveness. Close friend-
ships are often measured through a mutual nomination 
Carly and Michelle have been best 
friends since fi rst grade. They love to 
spend time together whether they’re 
washing the dog, going for bike 
rides, or listening to music. They de-
pend on each other for fun, support, 
and problem solving.

acceptance feel less alone than those who are rejected by 
their peers. This relationship between peer rejection and 
loneliness has been found across countries and grades from 
kindergarten through middle school (Crick & Ladd, 1993; 
Asher & Paquette, 2003). Third, among the children who 
are anxious and solitary, those who experience exclusion 
or are rejected by peers become increasingly socially help-
less, anticipating rejection and being unwilling to take new 
risks to reach out or initiate social exchanges (Gazelle & 
Druben, 2009). Children who tend to blame themselves 
for their lack of social acceptance feel more lonely and are 
possibly less likely to believe that they can do anything to 
improve their situation. Those who are withdrawn, vic-
timized, or bullied report higher levels of loneliness than 
other unpopular children (Kochenderfer-Ladd & Wardrop, 
2001). 
What can lonely or socially anxious children do to 
increase their sense of closeness to friends? Cognitive 
restructuring techniques have been used to help children 
deal with social anxiety (Marini, Dane, & Volk, 2010). 
The central feature of cognitive restructuring is to identify 
thoughts that increase strong emotions such as anger, anxi-
ety, or sadness, challenge their accuracy, and replace them 
with interpretations that are more realistic and less dis-
ruptive to adaptive behavior (Dombeck & Wells-Moran, 
2010). With regard to social anxiety, students learn to moni-
tor changes in their anxiety level, and to become aware of 
the thoughts that accompany this increase in anxiety. For 
example, a student may recognize that his anxiety rises in 
class when he thinks about answering a question out loud, 
because he assumes that his classmates would think he is 
stupid if he were to give an incorrect answer. Once these 
assumptions have been identified, the student may be 
guided to look for evidence that these assumptions are cor-
rect, and to consider alternative interpretations. The student 
may be encouraged to take a more accepting view, recog-
nizing that everyone makes mistakes. When other students 
make mistakes, he does not usually think badly of them. 
To strengthen this perspective and remain calm, the stu-
dent might practice self-talk, such as “It’s OK to make mis-
takes; that’s how we learn.” Through cognitive restructuring, 
socially anxious students learn to recognize the sources of 
their anxiety and practice strategies for redefi ning the situa-
tion so that they can be more confi dent about taking initia-
tive in peer situations.
Some children have discovered that online communica-
tion provides an environment where they can experience 
greater levels of self-disclosure and depth of communication 
with friends. The Internet is increasingly being used as a way 
to supplement face-to-face friendship interactions through 
Instant Messaging (Peter, Valkenburg, & Schouten, 2005). 
Many children use the Internet to participate in chat with 
strangers, most use it to maintain their existing network of 
friends, and some form friendships with strangers through 
chat who then become face-to-face friends (Walther & 
Parks, 2002). In a study of Dutch children, 61% of the 
Close friends often see each other during the school day in 
classes and extracurricular activities. In schools that promote 
stable classroom groupings, where children remain in the 
same homeroom or class group from one grade to the next, 
friendship groups also remain more stable (Neckerman, 
1996).
Close friendships are infl uenced by attractiveness, intel-
ligence, classroom social status, and satisfaction with and 
commitment to the best friend (Clark & Ayers, 1988). In 
a study of more than 800 children in grades 3 to 5, 78% 
had at least one reciprocating best friend (i.e., one child 
named another as one of three best friends, and that other 
child named the first child high on the list as well), and 
55% had a very best friend. More girls than boys had best 
friends, and the quality of their best friendships was some-
what different. Girls and boys described their best friend 
relationships quite similarly with respect to having low lev-
els of confl ict or betrayal and high levels of companionship 
and shared recreational activities. However, girls described 
their best friend relationships as having higher levels of car-
ing and personal validation (“makes me feel good about my 
ideas”), intimacy (“we always tell each other our problems”), 
help and guidance (“help each other with schoolwork a lot”), 
and confl ict resolution (“we make up easily when we have a 
fi ght”) (Parker & Asher, 1993).
Loneliness
With the increased emphasis on friendship and peer 
acceptance comes the risk of peer rejection and feelings of 
loneliness. In the period from preschool to middle child-
hood, issues of shyness, social anxiety, and peer victimi-
zation become increasingly salient. Experiences of social 
rejection or dissatisfaction in friendship quality become 
linked to a more general sense of anxiety in the school 
environment and a decline in self-worth (Asher & Gazelle, 
1999; Asher, Parkhurst, Hymel, & Williams, 1999; Ford-
ham & Stevenson-Hinde, 1999). By third grade, some 
children are characterized as anxious and solitary. They 
are shy, typically watching their peers without joining in, 
wanting to interact with their peers but afraid that they 
will be socially awkward or will not be accepted (Rubin, 
Coplan, & Bowker, 2009). 
Three social characteristics combine to increase a 
child’s experiences of loneliness. First, children who are 
anxious and solitary have trouble forming close friendships 
that provide emotional closeness and companionship; they 
are more likely to feel lonely. It is not necessarily impor-
tant to have many friends. However, children who have 
at least one enduring, high-quality friendship are less likely 
to experience loneliness (Nangle, Erdley, Newan, Mason, & 
 Carpenter, 2003). Second, some children are system-
atically excluded. When they ask if they can play, other 
children say no. They don’t get invited to children’s par-
ties or are the last to be chosen for teams. Peer rejection 
is especially powerful in producing feelings of loneliness. 
Children who experience a generally positive level of peer

conditions, children protect themselves from the negative 
feelings associated with rejection by withdrawing from 
social interactions; in other conditions they may act aggres-
sively to try to reassert control (Gerber & Wheeler, 2009; 
Baumeister, DeWall, & Vohs, 2009). 
Research has identified three types of children who 
experience peer rejection. Some children who are rejected are 
disruptive and aggressive with their peers; others are socially 
withdrawn but do not exhibit aggressive tendencies; a third 
group has been described as both aggressive and withdrawn 
(French, 1988, 1990; Hymel, Bowker, & Woody, 1993). 
Children who are physically aggressive are identifi ed as early 
as toddlerhood. Aggressiveness has been noted as a feature 
of personality that is linked to diffi culties in emotional regu-
lation, exposure to power assertive or harsh parenting, and 
reduced levels of empathy. Genetic and environmental fac-
tors combine to support a child’s aggressive and oppositional 
behavior (Burt & Neiderhiser, 2009). Aggressive-rejected 
children, often referred to as bullies, are more likely than 
nonaggressive children to attribute hostile intentions to oth-
ers. They see peer interactions as threatening and say they 
would be likely to use aggressive strategies in response to 
negative peer behaviors (Quiggle, Garber, Panak, & Dodge, 
1992; Waldman, 1996). Aggressive-rejected children tend to 
have an exaggerated idea of their competence and social sta-
tus. They are less accurate in reading their own social status 
among their classmates, although they are just as accurate as 
other children in reading the social status of others (Zakriski 
& Coie, 1996). The Applying Theory and Research to Life 
box on page 298 discusses bullying and a school program 
designed to prevent it.
participants who were 10 and 11 years old used the Inter-
net for online communication. Almost 90% of those chil-
dren communicated with preexisting friends (Valkenburg 
& Peter, 2007). Children who described themselves as 
either lonely or socially anxious were more likely to per-
ceive online communication as facilitating greater breadth 
and depth of communication. Those socially anxious chil-
dren who perceived the Internet as offering a way to achieve 
greater intimacy in communication used the Internet more 
often and described their friendships as closer than socially 
anxious children who used online communication infre-
quently. The authors suggest that socially anxious children 
have more diffi culty with face-to-face self-disclosure. For 
these children, the value of the Internet is not for increasing 
general social interaction or for forming new relationships 
but for allowing greater levels of intimacy with existing 
friends, unencumbered by the diffi cult visual and auditory 
cues that may disrupt disclosure in face-to-face interactions. 
Unfortunately, online technologies and text messaging can 
also be used in a hostile way to send messages of rejection. 
Youth can use electronic media to embarrass, harass, or 
threaten their peers.
Rejection
Rejection hurts. Studies of rejection find different pat-
terns of reaction, including emotional numbness, changes 
in mood reflecting new levels of sadness or feeling bad, 
and decreases in self-esteem. Two basic needs appear to be 
thwarted when a child experiences social rejection—the 
need for control and the need for belonging. Under some 
Children as young as 8 or 9 
can share information with 
others on social networking 
sites. They can be in contact 
with friends from school, the 
neighborhood, or summer 
travels or form new friend-
ships as penpals and Face-
book friends with children 
they have never met face to 
face. Sadly, some children 
become targets of cyber-
bullying, which creates a new 
context for teasing and ex-
periences of peer rejection.

However, not all aggressive children are rejected. One 
study looked at the relationship of antisocial and prosocial 
characteristics of young children and their social standing in 
the classroom (Farmer & Rodkin, 1996). Children in four 
different types of classroom groups were compared: aca-
demic giftedness, emotional and behavioral disorders, gen-
eral education, and learning disabilities. Across all four types 
of classrooms, the most popular and socially central children 
were more athletic, cooperative, and studious and were rated 
as having more leadership skills than the less popular chil-
dren. Aggressive, disruptive characteristics were strongly 
associated with peer rejection or isolation for girls. For boys 
in the general education classes, however, aggressive behav-
ior was positively associated with popularity. Thus, one 
is led to consider person-environment fi t in evaluating the 
relationship between aggressiveness and peer rejection. In 
some classroom contexts, aggressiveness, particularly among 
boys, may be a viable path toward bonding with other boys 
and asserting one’s leadership, especially for boys who can-
not achieve notice through their academic performance 
(Poulin & Boivin, 2000). Subsequent studies have found 
that in many cases, bullies deliberately choose targets who 
are already rejected by their peers, thus minimizing the risk 
of social rejection from other children. Moreover, boys who 
bully other boys are admired by some girls who are possi-
bly being attracted to this gender-stereotyped dominant male 
behavior (Dijkstra, Lindenber, & Veenstra, 2007; Veenstra, 
Lindenberg, Munniksma, & Dijkstra, 2010). 
Children in the withdrawn group tend to be inhibited, 
anxious, and interpersonally reserved. They have a negative 
self-concept and tend to interpret negative peer reactions 
as resulting from their own personal failings (Hymel et al., 
1993). They have diffi culty dealing with stress. These chil-
dren may exhibit inappropriate emotions and display vari-
ous unusual behavioral mannerisms that are likely to draw 
ridicule from their peers (French, 1988). For example, stud-
ies of children with developmental disabilities and language 
disorders suggest that these children begin to have more rela-
tionship problems in the upper elementary school grades. 
Their social status among classmates is likely to decline, they 
may become targets of bullying, and they are less likely to be 
involved in reciprocal friendships. Over time, children who 
experience a combination of anxiety, lack of a close friend, 
and peer victimization are likely to continue to be targets 
of victimization (Asher & Gazelle, 1999; Goldbaum, Craig, 
Pepler, & Connolly, 2003; Gazelle, 2008).
Children in the aggressive-withdrawn group tend to 
be the least well liked of all three types of rejected children. 
They exhibit anxiety, poor self-control, and social with-
drawal in addition to aggressive behavior. They are rated by 
other children as incompetent in school ability; unattractive; 
showing the poorest skills in leadership, cooperation, or 
sense of humor; and the most likely to behave inappropri-
ately in school. Aggressive-withdrawn children are similar to 
the bully-victims described in the box on bullying (Marini, 
Dane, Bosacki, & YLC-CURA, 2006). Having been excluded 
or rejected by their peers, they respond by lashing out 
against children who are more vulnerable than they. Despite 
high levels of peer rejection, aggressive-withdrawn children 
do not have the same low self-concept and negative view of 
their abilities as the withdrawn children. They are likely to 
have future adjustment problems and often require psychiat-
ric treatment in adolescence or adulthood (Coie & Krehbiel, 
1984; Hymel et al., 1990).
Although we tend to think of peer rejection as having 
signifi cant implications for the formation of interpersonal 
relationships, a substantial body of research points to links 
between peer group acceptance or rejection and school 
adjustment. Beginning in the early school grades, peer rejec-
tion is associated with school problems, including school 
avoidance, negative attitudes about school, less engagement 
with school-related tasks, and a less cooperative orientation 
toward teacher requests and group activities. The longer 
this peer rejection lasts, the more impact it seems to have 
on a child’s engagement with the learning environment and 
the academic challenges of school (Ladd, Herald-Brown, & 
Reiser, 2008). 
Concrete Operations
Objective 2. To describe the development of concrete 
operational thought, including conservation, classifi cation 
skills, mathematical reasoning, and the child’s ability to 
understand and monitor his or her own knowledge and 
understanding.
Children’s abilities to analyze and manage social relation-
ships, including friendships, are linked to their ability to 
solve other kinds of problems. Advances in reasoning about 
the physical world may stimulate new ways of handling com-
plex social situations; similarly, engaging in complex social 
situations may enhance the child’s ability to bring fl exibility 
and perspective to problems of the physical world.
Thinking back to the period of infancy, the discussion 
of infant intelligence focused on the establishment of sen-
sory and motor patterns used to explore the environment, 
manipulate means-end relationships, clarify the nature of 
physical objects, and begin to form simple categories. Dur-
ing toddlerhood, cognition moves beyond the experiential 
domain as children develop a variety of representational 
skills that free them from complete reliance on their imme-
diate physical environment. Toddlers create novel situations 
and solve problems by using thought, fantasy, and language. 
Piaget (Piaget & Inhelder, 1969) suggested that at about age 
6 or 7, a qualitatively new form of thinking develops, which 
he referred to as concrete operational thought. This type of 
reasoning guides thought by imposing logical rules on one’s 
judgments, leading to the acceptance of certain inferences 
that adhere to the logic as more compelling or convincing 
than others (Moshman, 2004).

of concrete operations, children begin to consider a variety 
of actions that can be performed on objects and can do so 
mentally without having to do them physically. Thus, a men-
tal operation is a representation or scheme for an alteration 
in the relationships among objects. One of the most pow-
erful mental operations is reversibility. One can imagine an 
action, such as fi lling a glass with water, and then undoing 
the action by emptying the glass. One can even imagine add-
ing salt to water and then removing the salt, even though this 
would be diffi cult in practice. In contrast to sensorimotor 
The word operation refers to an action that is per-
formed on an object or a set of objects. A mental  operation 
is an action that is carried out in thought rather than in 
behavior. Piaget argued that such mental operations are built 
on some physical relationship that the younger child can 
perform but cannot articulate. For example, a toddler can 
arrange a graduated set of circles on a stick so that the larg-
est circle is at the bottom of the stick and the smallest circle 
is at the top. The child does not have a verbal label for the 
ordering operation but can perform it. With the emergence 
Bullying
BULLYING IS A common and long-
standing problem for children in many 
cultures. A child is considered to be bullied 
when repeatedly exposed to negative 
actions by peers, including physical 
contact, harsh and degrading words and 
gestures, exploitation, and exclusion. Dan 
Olweus (1995), who has been studying 
aggression and bullying since the 1970s, 
has estimated that roughly 9% of children 
ages 7 through 16 have been victims of 
bullying, and 7% of school-age children 
have bullied others. This suggests that as 
many as 5 million children in the United 
States are involved in problems of bullying 
or peer intimidation each year.
What are the characteristics of bullies 
and their victims? Bullies typically are 
physically stronger than their peers. They 
have strong needs for power and enjoy 
being in control. They have been reared 
in a family environment characterized by 
indifference, low involvement, and lack of 
warmth. This context results in little sense 
of personal empathy and a high degree of 
hostility toward others.
Bullies are often aggressive toward 
teachers and other authority fi gures as 
well as toward peers. It is not uncommon 
for aggressive boys to have best friends 
who are also aggressive. Within these 
relationships, the boys encourage each 
other toward rule breaking (Bagwell & 
Coie, 2004). Finally, bullies often fi nd 
some reward or reinforcement for their 
behavior, especially when they coerce 
their victims into giving them money, 
taking things of value, and being treated 
with respect by other peers.
Bullies often use their size to intimidate 
their victims.
Our understanding of the nature 
of bullies has been expanded by 
research by Jaana Juvonen and her 
colleagues (Juvonen, Graham, & 
Schuster, 2003). In research involving 
over 1900 middle school children, 
peer nominations were used to 
identify bullies (those who start fights, 
use put-downs and make fun of other 
kids, and those who spread mean 
rumors about others) and victims 
(those who get pushed around, are 
made fun of, and about whom nasty 
rumors are often started). Children 
were asked to nominate up to four 
classmates who fit the description 
of bullies and victims. These peer 
nominations were accompanied 
by teacher ratings, and self-report 
measures of psychological distress, 
including depression, social anxiety, 
and loneliness. Several of the results 
were unexpected. First, there were 
two kinds of bullies, those who were 
identified by their peers as higher 
than average in aggression and low in 
victimization (bullies); and those who 
were both high in aggression and high 
in victimization (bully-victims). Second, 
the bullies had few psychological 
problems and were perceived as being 
cool by their classmates although the 
classmates did not want to spend time 
with them. The fact that bullies enjoy 
both high social status and report few 
psychological problems helps explain 
why bullying is so hard to modify. 
Bullies enjoy their social reputation 
and, although feared by others, do not 
seem to be bothered by the fact that 
many of the children avoid them.
In contrast, bully-victims were more 
depressed and lonely than bullies, had 
lower social status than bullies, were 
less popular than bullies, and were more 
likely to be avoided by their classmates 
than any other group. They were 
described by their teachers as having 
the most conduct problems and being 
the most disengaged from school of 
any of the groups. These bully-victims 
are most like the aggressive-withdrawn 
children described previously. They are 
likely to be children who have been 
victimized by others and subsequently 
lash out as a result of shame, rage, and a 
desire for revenge.
Victims of bullying commonly have 
low self-esteem. They are anxious, 
cautious, and fi t into the withdrawn 
category of rejected children. In 
comparison to the bullies, the victims, 
especially boys, are physically weaker.

involving the grouping of trees into different categories and 
identifying the features of these categories. However, if you 
pose a problem involving trees that migrate from North 
to South with the seasons, a child in the concrete stage of 
thinking will have difficulty even entertaining the prob-
lem, because trees do not migrate. Piaget’s characterization 
of intelligence in middle childhood as concrete operational 
thought is only one perspective. In the Applying Theory and 
Research to Life box on page 306, three theoretical views 
about the nature of intelligence are compared. 
schemes, which unfold in a behavior sequence, operations 
can be done and undone in the mind (Lerner, 2002).
Piaget (1972a) used the term concrete to contrast this 
quality of thinking to the more hypothetical reasoning of 
adolescents and adults. The child reasons about objects and 
the relations among them but has difficulty entertaining 
hypothetical statements or propositions. Thinking is typi-
cally focused on real objects that exist in the world, even if 
the child is not seeing or manipulating these objects at the 
moment. For example, children can reason about problems 
When attacked, they do not retaliate. 
As a result, the abuse continues and 
often escalates. In Juvonen’s research, 
children who are perceived by their 
peers as victims also report the highest 
levels of depression, social anxiety, and 
loneliness; have the lowest social status 
as rated by peers; and are described 
by teachers as the least popular of the 
children. They are the most marginalized 
of the children, and, as a result, may be 
additionally vulnerable because they 
have no classmates who will defend 
them or intervene when they are being 
attacked.
Sexual orientation and race/
ethnicity are two factors that are 
commonly intertwined with bullying. 
Gay, lesbian, and bisexual students 
are targets of frequent bullying. 
Surveys of LGBTQ youth fi nd that 
80% say that their teachers never or 
rarely intervened to stop homophobic 
joking or bullying (SPLC Report, 
2010). Children who are members of a 
numeric ethnic minority in their school 
are more vulnerable to harassment than 
children who are in the ethnic majority. 
When a school is ethnically diverse 
and no group is in a clear numeric 
majority, children who are victims of 
bullying are more likely to attribute the 
problem to the bullies or to conditions 
of the school environment that allow 
this kind of harassment than to blame 
themselves (Graham & Juvonen, 2002; 
Graham, 2004). 
The complex social dynamics 
surrounding bullying call for a 
multidimensional approach to 
intervention. Olweus has designed a 
school-based intervention program to 
reduce bullying and prevent children 
from feeling harassed and degraded 
at school (Olweus, Limber, & Mihalic, 
1999). The program, which has 
been implemented in Norway, the 
southeastern United States, England, 
and Germany, calls for intervention at 
three levels: the school, the classroom, 
and the individual. Intervention begins 
with awareness of the extent of bullying 
and victimization within the school 
through the use of an assessment survey. 
Once the nature of the problem and the 
seriousness of its impact on students 
have been identifi ed, interventions are 
implemented that focus on fi ve basic 
principles:
 1. Create an environment in which 
children experience warmth, inter-
est, and frequent involvement with 
adults.
 2. Set clear, fi rm limits about unaccept-
able behavior that are endorsed at 
school and home.
 3. When rules and limits are violated, 
sanctions should be nonhostile 
and nonviolent, but consistently 
 enforced.
 4. Student activities during and after 
school must be monitored through 
the presence of adult supervision. 
The topic of monitoring and ap-
propriate adult supervision must 
be discussed with parents during 
PTA meetings and parent confer-
ences.
 5. Students need to meet regularly with 
teachers to discuss problems associ-
ated with the social environment of 
the school and to work on ways of 
improving the school climate.

Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Why do you think that some bullies 
are popular and have high status 
among their peers? What are some 
implications of having popular bullies 
for the students’ social structure?
 2. What might be some consequences 
of being a victim of bullying? How 
might being a victim affect subse-
quent school achievement? Peer 
relationships?
 3. What might be the negative conse-
quences of bullying for the school 
environment more generally, beyond 
the impact on specifi c victims?
 4. What do you think are the likely tra-
jectories for bullies as they move into 
adolescence and adulthood? Do you 
think being a bully is a “stable” trait 
that will continue to be expressed in 
some fashion in later stages of life? 
 5. What strategies can you think of that 
would improve the school environ-
ment for gay, lesbian, or bisexual 
students?
 6. If you were to evaluate a school-
based program to prevent bullying, 
what outcome measures would 
you select? In other words, what 
would you consider evidence that 
a program to prevent bullying was 
 effective?

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
Tony has created a plan, and is focusing seriously to implement 
his plan as he builds his brick structure. The combination of fi ne 
motor skills, computational skills, and logical reasoning come 
together in the design of his project. For many children, materials 
that offer opportunities to design and build new structures are a 
source of satisfaction throughout middle childhood.
During the stage of concrete operations, the three concep-
tual skills that have received the most attention are (1) con-
servation, (2) classifi cation, and (3) computational skills. Over 
the period of middle childhood, children apply these skills to 
achieve a clearer understanding of the logic, order, and predict-
ability of the physical world. As children take a new approach 
to problem solving through the use of the logical principles 
associated with concrete operational thought, they generalize 
these principles to their thinking about friendships, team play 
and other games with rules, and their own self-evaluation.
As the order of the physical world becomes more apparent, 
children begin to seek logic and order in social and personal 
domains as well. Sometimes, this search for order is frustrated 
by the unpredictability of the social world. At other times, chil-
dren use their enhanced capacities for reasoning to solve inter-
personal problems and to arrange their daily life so that it better 
meets their interests and needs. A hallmark of this period is an 
increase in logical, focused problem solving. Children are able 
to consider two competing explanations, look at a problem 
from another person’s point of view as well as their own, and, 
using this information, plan a strategy to reach a goal.
Conservation
The basic meaning of conservation is that physical matter does 
not magically appear or disappear despite changes in form, 
shape, or container. The concept of conservation can be applied 
to a variety of dimensions, including mass, weight, number, 
length, and volume. A child who conserves is able to resist per-
ceptual cues that alter the form of an object, insisting that the 
quantity remains the same despite the change in form. One of 
the most common problems of this type that Piaget investigated 
involves conservation of mass. The child is presented with two 
clay balls and is asked to tell whether or not they are equal. 
Once the child is satisfi ed that the balls are equal, one of them 
is fl attened out into a pancake. The child is then asked, “Which 
has more—this one [the pancake] or this one [the ball]?” Some-
times, the child is also asked whether the clay pieces are still the 
same. The child who does not conserve might say that the pan-
cake has more clay because it is a lot wider than the ball. This 
child is still in the preoperational stage of thought: She is using 
personal perceptions to make judgments rather than logic. In 
contrast, the child who conserves knows that the two pieces of 
clay are still identical in mass and can explain why.
Children eventually use the three concepts illustrated in 
Figure 8.1 to ascertain that equality in any physical dimen-
sion has not been altered. First, the child may explain that 
the pancake has the same amount of clay as the ball; no 
clay has been added or taken away. This is an example of 
the concept of identity: The pancake is still the same clay, 
and nothing has been changed except its shape. Second, the 
child may point out that the experimenter can turn the pan-
cake back into a ball. This is an example of the concept of 
reversibility. The child becomes aware that operations can 
be reversed, so that their effects are nullifi ed. Third, the child 
may notice that, although the pancake has a larger circumfer-
ence, the ball is much thicker. When the child can simulta-
neously manipulate two dimensions, such as circumference 
and thickness, we observe the concept of reciprocity. In the 
Identity:
It’s the same clay.
Reversibility:
You can roll it back
into a ball.
Reciprocity:
The ball is small and
thick; the pancake
is large and thin.

Developmental Tasks | 301
Theoretically, Piaget’s view of development suggests that 
there is a period of maturational readiness for the application of 
logical operations to physical objects. Left to their own process 
of exploration and experimentation, Piaget argued that children 
would discover the regularities and operations that underlie 
conservation. Showing a child a conservation problem and then 
explaining and reinforcing the correct answer should not be 
very effective if the child is not ready to assimilate this infor-
mation. However, research has shown that it is possible to train 
young children of preschool age to conserve (Brainerd, 1977). 
These early training studies have both theoretical and practical 
implications. The training studies suggest that it is possible to 
introduce such concepts as identity and reversibility so that chil-
dren as young as 4 can achieve conservation. They also transfer 
conservation from the tasks involved in training to other materi-
als and dimensions (Field, 1981; May & Norton, 1981).
An important element in modifying a child’s approach to 
conservation is being confronted by someone else’s reasoning 
that contradicts one’s own. For this contradiction to be effec-
tive, however, the child must be approaching a level of readi-
ness to reorganize his thinking, and the gap between the child’s 
current level of reasoning and the new ideas must not be too 
great. This reminds us of Vygotsky’s concept of the zone of 
proximal development. The implication here is that entry into 
a new stage of thought may emerge earlier and may be more 
readily infl uenced by the social environment than Piaget’s cog-
nitive developmental theory predicts. However, Piaget himself 
was not especially impressed by faster and sooner. He believed 
in the enduring benefi ts of personal discovery.
Practically speaking, research has demonstrated that pre-
school and kindergarten-age children can integrate and apply 
more abstract concepts than educators once believed they 
could. For example, studies of children as young as 3 and 4 
have shown that they understand the idea that materials are 
made of tiny particles that retain their properties even when 
they are invisible. They can use this notion of particles to 
explain how a substance, such as sugar, continues to exist in 
a solution and retain its sweetness even when it is invisible 
(Au, Sidle, & Rollins, 1993; Rosen & Rozin, 1993). In a study 
focused on estimating volume, many children in kindergarten 
and fi rst grade were able to consider the integration of three 
dimensions—height, width, and depth—to guess how many 
small cubes would be needed to build a larger cube. Their esti-
mates suggest that at even this young age, children can inte-
grate information from three dimensions (Ebersbach, 2009). 
Early childhood educators have found that, through a planned 
program of exploring, experimenting, and describing the trans-
formation of materials, young children can be guided to con-
ceptualize the physical world in a systematic, logical manner.
Classifi cation Skills
Classification was first discussed in Chapter 5, describing 
infants’ basic categorization skills. Classifi cation is the ability 
to identify the properties of categories, to relate categories or 
classes to one another, and to use categorical information to 
solve problems. Two components of classifi cation provide the 
clay ball example, change in one dimension is compensated 
for by change in another; the total mass remains the same. 
With consolidation of the concepts of identity, reversibility, 
and reciprocity, the child is able to conserve in any physical 
dimension. There appears to be a developmental sequence in 
the capacity to conserve. Children generally conserve mass 
and number earliest, weight later, and volume last.
Conservation may not generalize across all of the physi-
cal modes. For example, children who are unable to conserve 
quantity in an unfamiliar object, such as poker chips, can do 
so with a more familiar one, such as M&M’s (Gulko, Doyle, 
Serbin, & White, 1988). In one study, girls were able to per-
form a conservation of liquid task when it was presented in 
the standard manner of comparing the experimenter’s glass 
and their own. However, when the task was embedded in a 
story where juice had to be divided between two dolls, their 
performance declined. Evidence of a lack of generalizability of 
knowledge from in-school to out-of-school contexts is found 
in other areas of reasoning, especially mathematical codes and 
scientifi c principles (Perret-Clermont, Perret, & Bell, 1991).
Extensions of Piaget’s Ideas about Conserva-
tion. Researchers have raised questions about the meaning 
of conservation tasks, the timing of the emergence of conser-
vation, and the possibility of teaching children to conserve. 
The way the task is presented and the kinds of questions 
asked may infl uence a child’s responses. For example, the 
task may emphasize identity or equivalence. In an identity 
task, the child is asked to judge whether a single clay ball 
has the same amount of clay after it has been rolled into a 
sausage. In an equivalence task, there are two balls of clay. 
The child is asked to judge whether the ball that is rolled 
into a sausage has the same amount of clay as the standard, 
comparison ball. Some studies have shown that children can 
perform the identity task earlier than the equivalence task; 
others have shown the opposite; and still others have argued 
that identity and equivalence are achieved at the same time 
(Silverstein et al., 1982). In a study of 5- to 7-year-olds, chil-
dren were asked to tell how the materials looked, and then 
to tell how they really were. Giving the child this distinc-
tion between appearance and reality resulted in more correct 
answers than the standard procedure, in which this distinc-
tion was not made (Bijstra, Van Geert, & Jackson, 1989).
In a study of fi fth graders, half the students were identifi ed 
as being in the preoperational stage, even at age 10. This fi nd-
ing in itself suggests that Piaget’s view that children will enter 
the stage of concrete operational reasoning through active con-
struction and experimentation around the age of 6 or 7 is not 
universally true. The study examined strategies for enhancing 
concrete operational reasoning through guided intervention. 
Half the children received training involving special activi-
ties intended to promote logical problem solving and abstract 
thinking. Children received the training in English or Spanish 
depending on their language competence. This intervention 
was found to be successful in promoting concrete operational 
thought (Bakken, Thompson, Clark, Johnson, & Dwyer, 2001).

problems, children have to inhibit their tendency to reinter-
pret the question in line with a more common comparison, 
such as, “Are there more sparrows than ducks?”
In one study of class inclusion reasoning, an intriguing 
pattern was found. Children of ages 3 and 4, who could not 
repeat the question and clearly had not learned any rules 
about classes, were more likely to answer correctly than chil-
dren of ages 5 and 6. Children of ages 7 and 8 performed 
better than any of the younger children. The 5- and 6-year-
olds, who answered quickly and confi dently, were consis-
tently incorrect. They seemed unable to inhibit the more 
obvious comparison in order to consider the actual question 
(McCabe, Siegel, Spence, & Wilkinson, 1982).
Two processes appear to contribute to classifi cation judg-
ments among young children. First, perceived similarities 
among target objects guide judgments about whether the 
objects belong to the same category. Second, verbal labels play 
an important role in cuing children into the similarities among 
objects. When no verbal labels are available, children judge 
whether two objects are members of the same category based 
on the number of similar features. In comparison to adults, 
who rely less on verbal labels than on similarity of features, 
essential ability to apply knowledge from a known or famil-
iar instance to a new instance: categorization and induction. 
Categorization simply means that if one apple belongs to the 
category of fruit, then all apples are fruit. You do not need to 
learn this categorization label for each type of apple. Induction 
refers to the realization that whatever holds true for one mem-
ber of a category is likely to hold true for other members as 
well. For example, water and juice are both liquids. If you can 
pour water, you can pour juice. Other substances classifi ed as 
liquids should also have this property—even substances one 
has never seen. The value of classifi cation skills is not merely 
to organize objects or experiences into classes, but to take 
advantage of what is known about these categories to make 
inferences about the characteristics and dynamics of members 
of the same categories, members of hierarchically related cat-
egories, and objects that are not members of a specifi c category 
(Kalish & Gelman, 1992; Lopez, Gelman, Gutheil, & Smith, 
1992; Farrar, Raney, & Boyer, 1992).
One component of classifi cation skills is the ability to 
group objects according to some dimension that they share. 
The other component is the ability to order subgroups hier-
archically, so that each new grouping will include all pre-
vious subgroups. Vygotsky (1962) suggested a method for 
studying classifi cation in young children. Children are pre-
sented with a variety of wooden blocks that differ in shape, 
size, and color. Under each block is a nonsense syllable that 
is hidden from view. The children are instructed to select, 
one at a time, all the blocks that have the same syllable. The 
youngest children, who would be characterized as preopera-
tional in Piaget’s stage theory, tend to select blocks by their 
color. Their technique for grouping is highly associative. 
They choose each new block to match some characteristic of 
the previous selection, but they do not hold in mind a single 
concept that guides their choices.
Children who have entered the stage of concrete opera-
tions tend to focus on one dimension at fi rst, perhaps shape, 
and continue to select blocks until they discover that they 
have made an incorrect choice. They use this discovery to 
change their hypothesis about which characteristics of the 
blocks are associated with the nonsense syllable. This clas-
sifi cation task demonstrates the child’s ability to hold a con-
cept in mind and to make a series of decisions based on it. 
It also demonstrates that during the stage of concrete opera-
tions, children can use information from their mistakes to 
revise their problem-solving strategy.
Piaget studied reasoning about class hierarchies or 
class inclusion by asking questions about whether a group 
of objects included more members of one subtype than of 
the group as a whole (Piaget, 1941/1952; see also Chap-
man & McBride, 1992). Thus, when a set of pictures shows 
three ducks, six sparrows, and two robins, one might ask, 
“Are there more sparrows or more birds in these pictures?” 
This is an unusual kind of question, one that children are 
rarely asked. By the age of 8 or 9, however, many children 
can respond correctly because they recognize the distinc-
tion between classes and subclasses. In order to handle such

coins and then to see how high she can stack each type of coin.

operations underlying conservation of number, children 
understand that certain physical transformations will not 
alter the number of units in a set. If 10 poker chips are lined 
up in a row, the number remains constant whether they are 
spread out, squeezed tightly together, or stacked. Children 
can use counting to answer a “how many” question some-
time between the ages of 3 and 4. For example, they can 
assign one number to each item in a set of four poker chips 
and tell you that there are four chips in all. However, young 
children have more diffi culty selecting a set of six chips from 
a larger pile, or establishing that two sets of chips are equal 
in number. They also have trouble solving verbal story prob-
lems when no concrete objects are present (Jordan et al., 
1992; Sophian, 1998).
Young children differ widely in their mathematical 
knowledge and problem-solving skills. Success in doing 
addition and subtraction requires counting knowledge, 
working memory, understanding of part-whole relationships, 
familiarity with the language and features of specifi c prob-
lems, and experience with a variety of strategies for estimat-
ing answers, solving problems, and checking one’s answers 
(Canobi, Reeve, & Pattison, 2003; Ginsburg & Pappas, 
2004). The ability to solve addition problems begins with 
an understanding that cardinal numbers refer to quantities 
and that there is a relationship between counting objects and 
adding or subtracting them as part of a larger set or whole 
(Canobi, 2004; Zur & Gelman, 2004). Early number com-
petence includes an understanding that each number is one 
more than the number preceding it and one less than the 
number following it. This understanding allows children to 
make quick and accurate judgments about the value of small 
quantities, and to understand the logic behind joining or 
separating of sets (e.g., 5 and 2 makes 7; 7 take away 2 leaves 
5). During the first few elementary grades, most children 
acquire the complementary operations of addition, subtrac-
tion, multiplication, and division and learn to apply these 
operations no matter what specifi c objects or quantities are 
involved. Longitudinal studies show that children’s number 
competence and rate of growth in understanding numbers 
in kindergarten and fi rst grade are strong predictors of their 
mathematics achievement by third grade, a point at which 
many children are required to take mathematics assessment 
tests (Jordan, Kaplan, Ramineni, & Locuniak, 2009). 
There is a difference between the cognitive understand-
ing of single computational operations, such as addition and 
subtraction, and the coordination of computational abilities 
to solve mathematics problems (Montague, 2006). As the 
problems become more complex, involving larger numbers, 
more numbers, or numbers embedded in story problems, 
same-grade children demonstrate notable differences in 
the speed and accuracy of their solutions. The explanation 
for these differences may rest with the interaction between 
teachers and their students. Teachers differ in their confi -
dence about their own mathematical abilities, as well as their 
ability to assess children’s understanding of mathematics and 
to select appropriate approaches to mathematics instruction. 
young children expect the labels to provide important infor-
mation about objects, but they do not rely solely on these 
labels to guide their judgment (Sloutsky & Fisher, 2004).
From ages 6 to 12, children’s knowledge of catego-
ries and of the information associated with them expands 
dramatically. Moreover, children have a broad range of 
categories available into which to incorporate a novel 
observation. The capacity for classifying and categorizing 
has been explored in relation to specifi c domains, such as 
health and illness or concepts of the family. For example, 
children were told about 21 different human groupings 
and asked to say whether these groupings were a family: 
“Here are Mr. Mead and his son, Tom. They live together, 
just the two of them. Are they a family?” The youngest par-
ticipants (4- to 6-year-olds) had trouble accepting exam-
ples involving single parents or biologically related people 
who did not live in the same home as instances of a fam-
ily. Principles of biological relatedness and shared physical 
residence were both important to these children’s view of 
a family. By middle childhood, the children were able to 
accept a wider variety of groups as meeting certain essen-
tial criteria of a family, usually biological relatedness and 
emotional closeness. Emotional closeness was endorsed by 
80% of the participants as a defi ning feature of a family and 
was used repeatedly as a basis for judging whether a spe-
cifi c instance of a grouping could be considered a family or 
not (Newman, Roberts, & Syre, 1993).
Categorization skills can be used in an active way to 
construct and constrain behavior. Butler and Weatherall 
(2006) observed the natural use of categorization in the play 
sequences of 6- and 7-year-olds. Children systematically 
mapped participants to categories of play roles, and used these 
categories to establish appropriate behaviors within the play 
sequence. The use of membership categories, such as good 
and bad pirates, provides a guide toward the kinds of actions, 
props, and strengths or vulnerabilities children are allowed 
within the pretense. These categories are used to include new 
players to the situation, and to guide the initiation of new play 
sequences that will fi t with the established categories.
Computational Skills
A third characteristic of concrete operational thought is the 
development of computational skills. The number symbols 
(1, 2, etc.) can provide three types of information: nominal, 
cardinal, and ordinal. Nominal numbers are used like names, 
such as the number on a football player’s jersey or a home 
address. They do not refer to an amount. Cardinal numbers 
refer to a quantity (e.g., two siblings or 5 minutes). Ordinal 
numbers refer to the position or progression of things in a set 
(e.g., fi rst, second, third) rather than to a specifi c amount. 
In the transition from preoperational to concrete operational 
thought, children shift from using numbers in a nominal way 
(knowing and reciting the names of numbers, or reciting their 
street address) to the ordinal and cardinal nature of numbers.
Conservation of number is achieved around age 6 or 
7 (Halford & Boyle, 1985). Once they have acquired the

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
was interested in how they explained their answers. How 
do children know what they know? What reasons do they 
give to justify or support their answers? Metacognition 
refers to a range of processes and strategies used to assess 
and monitor knowledge. It includes the feeling of knowing 
that accompanies problem solving—the ability to distinguish 
those answers about which we are confi dent from those we 
doubt (Butterfi eld, Nelson, & Peck, 1988). One element of 
this feeling of knowing is understanding the source of one’s 
beliefs. For example, we can be told about sand, we can see 
pictures of it for ourselves, or we can feel and touch it. All 
three of these sources of information may coincide to create 
a single belief, or we may discover that there are inconsisten-
cies between what someone says is true and what we per-
ceive through sight or touch. By the ages of 4 and 5, children 
are able to understand how all three sources of information 
have contributed to their understanding of an experience 
(O’Neill & Gopnik, 1991).
Metacognition includes the ability to review various 
strategies for approaching a problem in order to choose the 
one that is most likely to result in a solution. It includes the 
ability to monitor one’s comprehension of the material one 
has just read and to select strategies for increasing one’s com-
prehension (Currie, 1999): “I need to reread this section.” “I 
need to underline and take notes to focus my attention on 
new information.” “I need to talk about this with someone 
in order to understand it better.” Recent research has con-
sidered psychological mindedness as an aspect of metacog-
nition. This refers to the ability to think about what might 
be accounting for one’s own or another person’s behavior. It 
requires building a link between experiences, emotions, and 
behaviors. For example, a child who is feeling sad may think 
about what happened in the recent past that is producing 
this feeling. This would be a type of refl ection on one’s psy-
chological state (Lagattuta & Wellman, 2001).
Metacognition develops in parallel with other cogni-
tive capacities. As children develop their ability to attend to 
more variables in their approach to problems, they simulta-
neously increase their capacity to take an executive posture 
in relation to cognitive tasks. They can detect uncertainty 
and introduce strategies to reduce it. They can learn study 
techniques that will enhance their ability to organize and 
In a detailed policy report on mathematics education for 
young children, the researchers concluded that early child-
hood mathematics instruction is poor, failing to build upon 
the basic capacities of mathematics understanding that most 
children bring to the preschool or kindergarten setting. “The 
typical situation is that (teachers) are poorly trained to teach 
the subject, are afraid of it, feel it is not important to teach, 
and typically teach it badly or not at all” (Ginsburg, Lee, & 
Boyd, 2008, p. 1). More research is needed to clarify factors 
that support the cognitive basis of computational skills and 
factors that support more advanced computational problem 
solving (Newcombe et al., 2009).
At the beginning of the stage of concrete operational 
thought, children’s performance on tests of cognitive matu-
rity is inconsistent. For example, children can conserve mass 
(using the clay balls task) but may make errors in conserva-
tion of weight, volume, or space. They may be able to per-
form a classification task correctly when they sort by one 
dimension, such as color, but they may make errors when 
asked to sort objects that have more than one dimension in 
common. Computational operations involving addition and 
subtraction are applied to simple, one-digit problems at fi rst, 
and are gradually extended to larger, more complex prob-
lems. The variety of concrete operations that emerge during 
middle childhood may not be fully integrated and available 
for purposeful problem-solving analyses until adolescence or 
adulthood (Flavell, 1982).
As concrete operational intelligence develops, children 
gain insight into the regularities of the physical world and 
the principles that govern relationships among objects. Per-
ceptions of reality become less convincing than a logical 
understanding of how the world is organized. For example, 
even though it looks as if the sun sinks into the water, we 
know that what we see is a result of the earth’s rotation on 
its axis. Table 8.1 summarizes the components of concrete 
operational thought.
Metacognition
As Piaget began his method of inquiry into concrete opera-
tional thought, he pointed the way to the study of metacog-
nition. Rather than being concerned solely with the exact 
answers that children gave to the questions he asked, he

(respect), winjo (comprehension of how to handle practical

Parents are likely to view the acquisition of technical skills 
and academic knowledge as important primarily insofar as 
these skills can enhance social intelligence, social harmony, 
and social acceptance (Dasen, 1984; Nsamenang, 1992).
In the United States, one observes the emergence of a 
wide range of valued skills during middle childhood, includ-
ing mathematics, science, writing, computer operation, 
sports, mechanics, music, dance, theater, art, cooking, sew-
ing, crafts, and reading. The nature and diversity of these 
skills and the fact that individual children can function at 
high levels in some but not in others raises the question 
of exactly what is meant by intelligence. The debate about 
intelligence is especially relevant in middle childhood, 
because this is when intelligence tests are administered and 
school placement decisions are made. As children discover 
the results of these tests, they make personal attributions 
about their ability or potential. Thus, IQ tests have a direct 
impact on the kind of educational experiences that children 
encounter and on their sense of academic self-effi cacy. Three 
theoretical approaches to the defi nition of intelligence are 
discussed in the box entitled “What Is Intelligence?”
Features of Skilled Learning
Skills are actions that take place in specifi c contexts (Fischer 
& Bidell, 2006). One uses the skill of manipulating a fork for 
eating, not to type on a computer. Skills can be of varying 
levels of complexity, from whistling a tune to playing poker. 
In each case, they have a developmental trajectory—the 
skill begins in some rudimentary form of action, which may 
mature to increasingly high levels of performance. Skills are 
both context specifi c and culturally guided. The skill of man-
aging a fork for eating is valued in most western cultures; 
however, chopsticks are the preferred tool in many eastern 
cultures.
Skills are changing as they become more advanced; 
they are also integrated with other skills that may permit 
new, more complex skills. Each skill is comprised of systems 
that must work together in order for the skill to be effective. 
For example, the use of a fork for eating requires hand-eye-
mouth coordination, judgments about the consistency and 
size of the food, and understanding cultural practices for eat-
ing. Once the basic skill of using a fork becomes well estab-
lished, it can be integrated into more complex skills such as 
cutting food with a knife and a fork, or the use of a fork in 
food preparation. The systems that contribute to one skill, 
such as hand-eye coordination, may contribute to more than 
one skill. These contributing systems may develop at differ-
ent rates, thus explaining why a skill may change slowly and 
then seem to advance to a new level rather suddenly.
Skills are self-organizing. Skills, by their very nature, are 
goal-oriented actions designed to perform specifi c functions 
in a particular environment. As the goals or the contexts 
for skill performance change, the skills may be modified 
or integrated with other skills to produce new behavior. 
recall information. These capacities continue to develop 
as the child becomes a more sophisticated learner (Veen-
man, Wilhelm, & Beishuizen, 2004). They are also quite 
amenable to training, both at home and at school. Meta-
cognition appears to be a natural component of cogni-
tive development. However, just like fi rst-level cognitive 
capacities, it is constructed in a social context. Interactions 
between children and adults or peers may nurture and 
stimulate metacognition by helping children to identify 
sources of information, talk about and recognize the differ-
ences between feelings of certainty and uncertainty in their 
knowledge, and devise effective strategies for increasing 
their feelings of knowing (Stright,  Neitzel, Sears, & Hoke-
Sinex, 2001; Teong, 2003).
Skill Learning
Objective 3. To analyze the nature of skill learning, 
including the presentation of a model for the process 
of acquisition of complex skills such as reading and 
examination of societal factors that provide the context 
in which skill learning occurs.
Concrete operational thought refers to an approach to rea-
soning about the physical world that is guided by the com-
pelling logic of certain mental operations. In addition to this 
general cognitive achievement, middle childhood brings 
impressive growth in the acquisition of skills. Skills are the 
basis of intellectual competence. They combine knowledge 
(knowing about) and practice (knowing how) directed toward 
identifying and solving significant, meaningful problems 
(Gardner, 1983; Kuhn, Garcia-Mila, Zohar, & Andersen, 
1995). Typically, a person moves through a developmen-
tal progression within a skill area, starting off as a novice, 
becoming more profi cient, and then, depending on a com-
bination of aptitude, training, and practice, becoming an 
expert.
Cultures differ in the kinds of abilities that are val-
ued (Greenfield, Keller, Fuligni, & Maynard, 2003). In 
some societies, like ours, symbolic skills focusing on read-
ing, mathematics, and abstract reasoning are highly valued. 
In other cultures, reading and mathematics are of less use 
and value than agricultural skills, hunting, or food prepara-
tion. In some cultures, parents consider social skills (know-
ing how to behave appropriately with peers and teachers), 
practical skills necessary for adjustment to school (com-
pleting one’s homework), and motivation (working hard to 
understand a problem) as more important indications of 
intelligence than cognitive accomplishments (Neisser et al., 
1996; Sternberg, 2007). In many African cultures, parents 
emphasize social intelligence, the ability to be attuned to the 
social intentions of others and the ability to anticipate the 
social impact of one’s actions and the actions of others. In a 
study of concepts of intelligence in rural Kenya, four differ-
ent concepts were used: rieko (knowledge and skills), luoro

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
What Is Intelligence?
THE TERM INTELLIGENCE is used 
in many contexts, with a variety of 
meanings. Informally, it may refer to 
the ability to solve diffi cult problems, to 
draw on scholarly research or literature 
in defending an argument, or to adapt 
to environmental conditions. At a 
psychometric level, it may refer to the 
score on a standardized test composed 
of one type of item (such as Peabody’s 
Picture Vocabulary Test) or many kinds 
of items (such as the Stanford-Binet 
Intelligence Test). Some theorists 
emphasize a general underlying factor, g, 
that refl ects what many different types of 
test items have in common (Spearman, 
1927). Other models suggest multiple 
intelligences with distinct areas of 
specialization. The remarkable adaptive 
and inventive capacities that human 
beings exhibit suggest a diversity of 
intellectual abilities, which are captured 
in the three theories of intelligence 
described here.
Jean Piaget (1972b) analyzed 
intelligence from a developmental 
perspective. He described four types of 
intelligence, each emerging at a different 
period of life: (1) sensorimotor intelligence 
(the ability to know through direct 
observation and manipulation of objects); 
(2) representational intelligence (the ability 
to distinguish between the real and the 
pretend; to think about and represent 
objects and events that are not present); 
(3) concrete operational intelligence (the 
ability to detect the logical relationships 
among objects; to place objects in 
sequences; and to comprehend and 
manipulate numbers); and (4) formal 
operational intelligence (the ability to use 
experimental techniques and hypothetical 
reasoning to solve problems, to generalize 
observations from one situation to another, 
and to relate cause and effect in complex, 
multidimensional problems). These 
approaches to problem solving are not lost 
as one moves from stage to stage. Rather, 
each is integrated into the next level, with 
lower levels of reasoning being viewed as 
inadequate as the person achieves new 
capacities.
Howard Gardner’s (1983) theory of 
multiple intelligences identifi es at least 
eight distinct intelligences, each with its 
own content and unique contribution 
APPLYING THEORY AND RESEARCH TO LIFE
For example, think about playing the piano as a skill. The 
original goal is to create music through the use of this spe-
cifi c instrument. Many components are required in order to 
play, including: memory, auditory perception, manual dex-
terity, rhythm, and the ability to read music. As one area 
improves, the level of playing may improve so that the notes 
are smoother, more rhythmic, and more musical. At some 
point, simple tunes are replaced by more complex composi-
tions requiring new fi ngering, more complex rhythms, faster 
speed, and coordinated use of right and left hands. As the 
technical challenges of playing the piano are mastered, the 
person begins to build a repertoire of pieces and introduces 
emotion, interpretation, liveliness, and a personal voice into 
the music. Now, the skill of playing the piano becomes a 
means of self-expression, and possibly the entertainment of 
others.
Four principles have been identified for understand-
ing how complex behavioral skills are achieved. First, the 
development of a skill depends on a combination of sen-
sory, motor, perceptual, cognitive, linguistic, emotional, and 
social processes. In sports, for example, a child must learn to 
coordinate specifi c sensory information and motor activities, 
understand the rules of the game, be able to communicate 
with the coach and the other players, gain control over emo-
tions such as fear or anger that might interfere with perfor-
mance, and sustain motivation to keep trying despite errors 
or defeat.
Second, skills are attained through the simultaneous 
integration of many levels of the component behaviors. They 
are not acquired in strict sequence from simple to complex. 
Instead, children work on the simple and more complex 
components of the skill at the same time. For example, as 
children learn the game of baseball, they practice simple 
skills like throwing and catching, and at the same time, they 
have to learn more complex skills like fi elding a ground ball 
and throwing it accurately to the fi rst baseman in order to 
make an out. 
Third, the limits of the human system place constraints 
on an individual’s capacity to perform skilled behavior. With 
practice, lower level processes begin to function automati-
cally, so a person can attend to higher order processes. In 
writing, for example, young children struggle with the physi-
cal act of printing and writing, concentrating largely on the 
motor skills necessary to make each letter, word, and sen-
tence. A skilled writer can write with little effort, focusing 
attention on the meaning of the writing, the plot, or the

Materials designed to foster spatial 
reasoning have become increasingly 
diverse, allowing children to explore new 
areas of creativity and problem solving. 
Lee is really concentrating on this proj-
ect, and seems quite pleased as she fi g-
ures out how these blocks fi t together.

to solving important, meaningful 
problems. These include linguistic, 
musical, logical-mathematical, spatial, 
naturalist, bodily-kinesthetic, and two 
forms of personal intelligence—one 
directed toward understanding one’s 
own internal feelings (intrapersonal) and 
the other directed toward identifying 
and differentiating among the 
characteristics of others (interpersonal). 
This theory recognizes domains of 
human functioning that show evidence 
of high levels of achievement that are 
not necessarily related to scientifi c, 
mathematical, or verbal reasoning. They 
cover a broader range of skills than are 
normally included in tests of intelligence, 
validating the variety of individual 
differences in competence typically 
observed among school-age children 
(Gardner, Kornhaber, & Wake, 1996).
A third view, devised by Robert 
Sternberg (1985; Sternberg, Castejon, 
Prieto, Hautamäki, & Grigorenko, 2001), 
describes three kinds of intelligence—
analytic, creative, and practical. 
According to Sternberg, only the fi rst 
is systematically measured by tests 
of intelligence, but the latter two are 
often required in job performance or 
adaptation to the demands of daily life. 
Practical intelligence is knowledge about 
how to do something, how to assess a 
situation and get a desired outcome. 
In two studies involving children in 
third and eighth grades, a classroom 
approach that focused on analytic skills 
was compared with an approach that 
included activities that called on analytic, 
creative, and practical intelligence. 
Children in the latter groups showed 
higher levels of performance, refl ecting 
the effectiveness of drawing on the 
three kinds of intelligence for more fully 
embedded learning (Sternberg, Torff, & 
Grigorenko, 1998).
Critical Thinking
 1. Compare the three theories of 
Piaget, Gardner, and Sternberg. 
What, if anything, do they have in 
common? What are their distinguish-
ing features?
 2. What are some implications of the 
three theories of intelligence for 
 educational practice? How might 
teachers approach the teaching/
learning process differently depend-
ing on which of these three views of 
intelligence they endorsed?
 3. Many scholars support the idea of 
a single underlying factor, often re-
ferred to as g, which refers to basic 
intelligence. Do you think there is 
such a thing as g? What evidence do 
you have for your belief? How does 
the idea of g fi t with the three theo-
ries presented here?
 4. How does culture infl uence intel-
ligence? Do you believe there can be 
such a thing as a culture-free test of 
intelligence?
 5. What role does intelligence play 
during middle childhood? Using the 
three theories presented here, how 
might you characterize the aspects 
of intelligence that are likely to be 
prominent at this stage of life?

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
cannot read. However, once they can read fl uently, the pos-
sibilities for independent inquiry expand signifi cantly.
Children begin to read in a variety of ways. Recall from 
Chapter 6 how David and his mother used a game with 
street signs along the road to build the bridge from language 
to literacy. At fi rst, David would ask his mother to tell him 
what every sign said. After a while, David began to sight read 
the signs by memorizing words and phrases that were linked 
to certain shapes and patterns in the signs. Other children 
begin to read by learning letters and the sounds linked to 
them, and by experimenting with sounding out the letters 
when they are strung together. At first, most children are 
bewildered and confused by these experiences. This is a time 
when they require a good deal of support and encourage-
ment for their efforts. Gradually, through a process of trial, 
feedback, and repetition, children learn to read simple words 
and sentences (Knight & Fischer, 1992). At some point, a 
child begins to articulate the concept “I can read” or “I am 
a reader.” Once this idea is part of the self-concept, efforts 
to read increase and are energized by a confi dence in one’s 
potential for success.
Reading is a complex skill that involves the acquisi-
tion and integration of several abilities, and which improves 
greatly with practice. In order to read, children have to 
translate the printed word into the spoken word they recog-
nize and link it to its meaning. Young children have a large 
spoken or oral vocabulary. They understand the meaning of 
many words. However, in order to read, they have to real-
ize that each spoken word is comprised of sounds which 
are represented in English by letters or letter combinations. 
 Phonemic awareness, that is, knowing the sound of a letter 
and being able to hear it as one reads, is a key to reading. 
Children with dyslexia frequently have trouble with this 
process of connecting letters and their sounds. Another com-
ponent of reading is the rapid naming of objects, referred 
to in the literature as RAN (rapid automatized naming). To 
measure RAN, children are asked to name 40 items includ-
ing colors, objects, numbers, and letters as fast as possible. 
RAN, measured before children have begun formal reading 
instruction, is a predictor of reading fl uency. Scholars who 
study reading argue that RAN is a general capacity for object 
recognition that is enlisted into the reading process, so that 
as a child learns to read the brain treats printed words as if 
they are objects to be recognized (Lervåg & Hulme, 2009). 
Reading involves more than recognizing one word at 
a time. Reading fl uency refers to the accuracy and speed 
with which children can read words in a text. Those chil-
dren who struggle with fi guring out each word may fi nd it 
diffi cult to capture the meaning of a sentence or paragraph. 
Over time, children who have diffi culty reading are less will-
ing to practice reading outside of class, and this lack of prac-
tice confounds their problems with fl uency (Gabrieli, 2009). 
Certain interventions have been shown to be successful for 
children who are having diffi culties with reading, especially 
when these interventions occur early in kindergarten or fi rst 
grade, and involve intensive, small group lessons with active, 
character development rather than on the physical aspects 
of the task.
Fourth, skilled behavior requires the use of strategies. 
Skillful people operate with purpose and continuously 
monitor their performance. They perceive breakdowns in 
performance, are selective in focusing attention on various 
aspects of what they are working on, and refi ne higher order 
processes as they perform the skill. This model of skill devel-
opment focuses on the elements that are necessary in order 
to move from what might be considered a novice level to a 
more advanced level in skill performance.
One must keep in mind that children vary widely in 
their rate of intellectual development and in their capacities 
to perform skills. For example, by grade 1 or 2, children have 
been identifi ed as mathematically gifted, normal, or math-
ematically disabled (Geary & Brown, 1991; Geary, Hoard, 
ByrdCraven, & DeSoto, 2004). These designations relate to 
children’s abilities to perform relatively simple mathematical 
operations, such as addition. 
Studies of children who have experienced early and pro-
longed deprivation, for example children who have spent 12 
months or more in institutional care before adoption, show 
evidence of neurological defi cits in certain areas by the age 
of 8 or 9, even when they have been adopted by stable, well-
educated families who provide supportive parenting and 
adequate resources. By the stage of middle childhood, the 
impact of early deprivation is evidenced in specifi c cogni-
tive domains but not others. For example, the children who 
experienced prolonged institutionalization perform less well 
on tests of visual memory, attention, and inhibitory control, 
but about the same as children who were adopted before 8 
months, and those who were never institutionalized on tests 
of auditory memory or executive function (Pollack, Nelson 
et al., 2010). The impact of early deprivation may be masked 
in the early years, when expectations for skill development 
are at a novice level for these children. However, by age 8 
or 9, these neurological defi cits may have a more noticeable 
impact on a child’s ability to reach a more advanced, sus-
tained level of competence or mastery. 
In each distinct area of skill development, a combina-
tion of maturational factors, aptitude or talent, opportunities 
for exposure and training, and the value placed on the skill 
by the family, school, or larger society all play a role in how 
rapidly and how well a skill will be developed. In the sec-
tions that follow, we look at reading as a specifi c case of skill 
development, and at the social and cultural contexts within 
which learning reading as a skill occurs.
Reading
Reading may be the most signifi cant skill that develops for 
children in the United States, because it opens the door to all 
the others. Literacy transforms children, just as the advent 
of the written alphabet transformed civilization. Reading 
provides access to new information, new uses of language, 
and new forms of thinking. Children are limited in their abil-
ity to learn mathematics, social studies, and science if they

experiences related to the story. Some parents point out 
words and specifi cally teach about the sounds of letters as 
they read (Reese & Cox, 1999; Justice & Ezell, 2000).
In a study of parents’ contributions to their children’s 
literacy development in the United States and Japan, fam-
ily members in both countries were found to employ a wide 
range of strategies both at home and away from home to 
encourage their children’s ability to read. These included 
reading and telling stories, discussing stories, teaching 
vocabulary, writing about their experiences, playing board 
games, and watching certain types of television programs 
(Saracho & Shirakawa, 2004). Parents who value the abil-
ity to read do some direct teaching to promote reading, urge 
their children to do well in school, provide resources for 
reading, take turns reading and listening to their children 
read, and talk with them about what they are reading. All 
these strategies produce children who are more skilled read-
ers (Bus, van IJzendoorn, & Pellegrini, 1995; Haney & Hill, 
2004).
Parents also have an indirect effect on how well a child 
will learn to read by infl uencing the child’s placement in a 
school reading group. Ability grouping for reading instruc-
tion is practically universal in elementary schools. Teachers 
depend on their perceptions of a child’s ability, work habits, 
and behavior when they assign students to reading groups 
(Haller & Waterman, 1985). The higher the level of the 
children’s reading group, the better they learn how to read. 
Parents need to understand the school’s approach to ability 
grouping and help their child understand it (National Asso-
ciation of School Psychologists, 2002). Parents who encour-
age good work habits and appropriate classroom behavior 
are likely to infl uence a teacher’s perception of their child 
and, as a result, infl uence the child’s assignment to a more 
advanced reading-level group.
The Social and Cultural Contexts of Reading. Recent 
attention has been given to the social and cultural contexts 
in which many skills, especially school-related abilities such 
as reading, emerge (Eccles, 1993). Progress in skill devel-
opment is infl uenced by parental and school expectations 
regarding levels of performance in a specific culture. The 
analysis of reading provides many good examples of the 
importance of context.
First, societies differ in their level of literacy. For example, 
in Afghanistan, 43% of men and 12.6% of women age 15 and 
older are literate (Central Intelligence Agency, 2007). In Fin-
land, a country with a population of more than 5 million, com-
pulsory public schooling does not begin until age 7, and 100% 
of the population is literate. Expectations that children should 
be read to, should be able to read, and the level of skill devel-
opment they are expected to reach at a certain age depends on 
cultural norms for literacy. The Progress in International Read-
ing Literacy Study (PIRLS) assessed reading activities of fourth 
graders in 40 countries. In the United States, 35% reported 
reading for fun daily or almost every day; this was lower than 
the average of 40% across all the countries. The more children 
engaging interactions between students and their teachers 
(Cirino, Vaughn et al., 2009). 
Parents Influence Their Child’s Reading Abili-
ties. Parents affect their children’s reading in at least six 
ways (Tudge, Putnam, & Valsiner, 1996).
 1. The value they place on literacy
 2. The emphasis they place on academic achievement
 3. The reading materials they make available at home
 4. The time they spend reading with their children and lis-
tening to their children read
 5. The way they read with their children
 6. The opportunities they provide for verbal interaction in 
the home
There are many different ways to approach the social 
occasion of reading. Some parents ask their children about 
the story as they read along to make sure the child under-
stands. Some try to expand on the story, talking with their 
children about other things they notice in the pictures or 
Children who enjoy reading books outside of school show the 
greatest gains in reading achievement between second and fi fth 
grades. Reading opens up limitless sources of information, new 
experiences, and fun.

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
reading and tests to measure reading ability. By the time they 
are applying to college, students are expected to be able to 
analyze a complex text for meaning, to know advanced prin-
ciples of grammar, and to write a well-organized essay under 
time constraints. In other cultures, a good reader might be 
someone who can read a letter for someone else, someone 
who can keep track of business accounts, or someone who 
can accurately make a copy of a text. The point is that the 
achievement of literacy is a product of cultural expecta-
tions, individual capacity, and opportunities to learn (Tudge, 
Putnam, & Valsiner, 1996).
The emphasis on skill building and the energy that 
children ages 6 to 12 bring to the acquisition of new skills 
suggest a strong parallel to toddlerhood. At both stages, 
children’s motives for competence and mastery are directed 
read for fun, the higher their reading achievement scores. In 
the United States, 43% of children said they read for fun twice 
a month or less. This was a higher percentage than the inter-
national average of 32% across all 40 nations (Mullis, Martin, 
Kennedy, & Foy, 2007). 
Second, the purpose of literacy varies from one culture to 
the next. For example, missionaries introduced literacy to the 
Kaluli of New Guinea primarily as a way to teach the Bible. 
Among the Kaluli, reading is viewed as having limited purpose 
for daily life, and as too difficult for children (Schieffelin & 
Cochran-Smith, 1984). In many societies, the ability to read the 
Bible, the Koran, or the Torah is the principal reason for literacy, 
and that one book has been the primary written resource.
Third, the mark of a literate person varies by context. 
In the United States, we have age-graded expectations for 
IN 1980, COMPARATIVE studies 
showed that fi rst- and fi fth-grade 
children in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
were substantially behind their age-
mates in Sendai, Japan, and Taipei, 
Taiwan, in tests of mathematics 
achievement. In a 10-year follow-up, 
U.S. children still lagged behind, and 
by the eleventh grade, the gap in 
achievement had widened (Stevenson, 
1992; Stevenson, Chen, & Lee, 1993). 
Even the top 10% of the Minneapolis 
students scored at about the average 
level of the Taipei and Sendai 
students.
Beginning in 1995, and then 
again in 1999, 2003, and 2007, the 
U.S. National Center for Education 
Statistics sponsored the Trends in 
International Mathematics and Science 
Study (TIMSS), which examined 
mathematics and science teaching 
practices and student accomplishment 
for eighth graders in 48 countries. 
Analysis of the 2007 data indicated 
some improvement in U.S. students’ 
scores from 1995. Eighth graders in 
fi ve countries had average scores 
statistically greater than the U.S. 
average: Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, 
Hong Kong, and Japan (National 
Center for Education Statistics, 2010).
It is diffi cult to account for these 
cross-national comparisons on the 
basis of ability. All these countries 
have practically universal enrollment 
of school-age children. Moreover, 
when children were compared in their 
knowledge of general information of 
the type not included in the school 
curriculum, the U.S. children in fi rst 
and fi fth grades scored higher than 
the Japanese and Chinese children.
At least four sociocultural 
factors interact to contribute to the 
advantage that Japanese and Chinese 
children show in mathematical 
skill development. First, there is a 
difference in parents’ views about 
what they should expect of their 
children. U.S. parents appear to be 
satisfi ed with their children’s level of 
mathematics performance and do not 
expect their children to do better. 
In contrast, Japanese and Chinese 
parents have high expectations for 
their children’s performance.
Second, parents differ in how they 
evaluate their children’s schools. U.S. 
parents are generally satisfi ed with 
the school curriculum and think that 
the schools are doing a good job. Far 
fewer Japanese and Chinese parents 
view the schools as good or excellent. 
The public pressure in these cultures is 
for greater improvement in the quality 
of education. They are more critical of 
their schools. Even though Japanese 
and Chinese children spend more time 
on homework than do U.S. children, 
their parents are more likely to 
encourage them to spend even more 
time on homework.
Third, there are cultural differences 
in the emphasis given to ability as 
compared to effort. U.S. parents and 
teachers highlight the importance 
of natural ability as a major factor in 
accounting for individual differences 
in mathematical ability. Japanese and 
Chinese parents and teachers are more 
likely to see outstanding performance 
as a result of studying hard. On the one 
hand, if you believe that skill depends 
on natural ability, you might conclude 
that not much can be done to improve 
performance. On the other hand, if you 
believe that skill depends on effort, 
you may be more inclined to devote 
additional time and focused application 
to reach a new level of performance.
Finally, there are notable 
differences in the approach to 
mathematics instruction across 
countries. In Japan, for example, 
the classroom teaching approach 
is quite distinct from that in the 
United States. Based on videotapes 
of U.S. and Japanese classrooms, 
one can observe Japanese teachers 
spending more time introducing new 
concepts and less time reviewing

outward to the environment. At both stages, children appear 
to be delighted by the potential for learning that almost 
every new encounter offers. However, as a result of children’s 
cognitive capacities and their awareness of social expecta-
tions, skill learning during middle childhood is embedded in 
a much more complex framework of continuous monitoring 
and self-assessment. Children’s beliefs and attitudes about 
which skills are important, what they should expect of them-
selves, what others expect of them, and what kinds of com-
peting demands should infl uence their dedication to skill 
development all contribute to the levels of perfor mance they 
are likely to achieve. The Human Development and Diversity 
box (starting on page 310) presents a cross-national compar-
ison of mathematics mastery and performance in the United 
States, Japan, and Taiwan.
Self-Evaluation
Objective 4. To examine the development of self-
evaluation skills, including feelings of pride, self-effi cacy, 
and ways that social expectations of parents, teachers, 
and peers contribute to a child’s self-evaluation.
During middle childhood, the emphasis on skill building is 
accompanied by a new focus on self-evaluation. Children 
strive to match their achievements to internalized goals 
and external standards. Simultaneously, they receive feed-
back from others about the quality of their performance. 
Some children may be asked to sit at one table to receive 
help; others may be told to go down the hall for tutoring.

complex problems that require four

and spending more time on problems

Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Were you surprised to learn that 
children in the United States lag 
behind children in other industrial-
ized countries with regard to their 
mathematics and science test 
scores? What are some implica-
tions of these fi ndings for the U.S. 
economy? For career opportunities 
in adulthood?
 2. What were your experiences in 
mathematics and science instruc-
tion in elementary and secondary 
school? Did you leave high school 
feeling confi dent about your ability 
in these domains? What role did 
teachers, parents, and peers play 
in your interest and achievement in 
mathematics and science?
 3. Three of the four sociocultural dif-
ferences between the Japanese and 
Chinese cultures and that of the 
United States have to do with paren-
tal attitudes and beliefs. In general, 
what role do parents in the United 
States play with respect to their chil-
dren’s education? Are they as pas-
sive with regard to their children’s 
mathematics and science achieve-
ment as the research suggests?
 4. What are the differences between 
the U.S. and the Japanese and 
Chinese cultures that you believe 
make the greatest difference with 
respect to science and mathemat-
ics achievement? How do concepts 
of individualism and collectivism 
enter into your thinking?
 5. Do you tend to favor the explana-
tion that differences in achieve-
ment are a result of differences in 
basic ability or differences in moti-
vation and effort? Why?
 6. How would you go about studying 
the relationship between beliefs 
in ability versus beliefs in effort on 
school achievement in mathemat-
ics and science?
Japanese mathematics classes involve two teachers, one who 
gives instruction to the whole class, and one who meets individu-
ally with students to help them in areas where they may be having 
diffi culties. In this way, all the students are able to move ahead at 
the same pace and “no child is left behind.”

factors. However, by ages 8 to 10 children were making a 
clearer distinction. They felt greater pride when success 
was due to internal factors and less pride when success was 
due to external factors (Graham & Weiner, 1991). By mid-
dle childhood, children are engaged in a complex process 
of self-evaluation that includes several sources of informa-
tion including their past performance, task diffi culty, the 
reactions of others, and their assessment of their ability and 
effort. 
Self-evaluation takes place in relation to internal frames 
of reference, as a child compares how well he can perform 
in one domain versus another. The internal frame of refer-
ence includes an assessment of both ability and effort. Self-
evaluation also takes place in relation to external frames of 
reference, as a child evaluates her own performance in light 
of parent, teacher, or peer feedback and observations of the 
performance of other children (Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2004). 
In the sections that follow, we focus on two different paths 
toward self-evaluation: self-effi cacy, which refl ects a child’s 
personal judgment of ability, and social expectations, which 
refl ect the impact of the expectations of others on a child’s 
performance.
Self-Effi cacy
How do children assess their competence in a specific 
ability area? Albert Bandura (1982) theorized that judg-
ments of self-efficacy are crucial to understanding this 
process. Self-efficacy is defined as the person’s sense of 
confidence that she can perform the behaviors demanded 
in a specific situation. Expectations of efficacy vary with 
the specific ability. In other words, a child may view effi-
cacy in one way in a situation requiring mathematical 
ability and in another way when the situation requires 
physical strength.
Bandura theorized that four sources of information 
contribute to judgments of self-efficacy (see Figure 8.2). 
The fi rst source is enactive attainments, or prior experi-
ences of mastery in the kinds of tasks that are being con-
fronted. Children’s general assessment of their ability in any 
Some children are designated as peer tutors who assist 
their classmates. These and many other signs are sources of 
social evaluation that children incorporate into their own 
self-evaluations.
In middle childhood, the process of self-evaluation 
is further complicated because the peer group joins the 
adult world as a source of social comparison, criticism, 
and approval. Toddlers and early-school-age children are 
likely to observe and imitate their peers in order to learn 
new strategies for approaching a task, or out of curiosity 
to see how their peers are doing a particular project. But in 
middle childhood, pressures toward conformity, competi-
tion, and the need for approval feed into the self-evalua-
tion process. At this age, children begin to pay attention 
to the work of others in order to assess their own abilities 
( Butler & Ruzany, 1993). Their athletic skills, intellectual 
abilities, and artistic talents are no longer matters to which 
only teachers and parents respond. Peers also identify oth-
ers’ skills and begin to generate profiles of one another: 
“Oh, Rafael is good in math, but he runs like a girl”; “Jane 
is kind of fat, but she writes great stories”; “I like Rashi-
dah best, because she’s good at everything.” Depending 
on their resolution of the crises of toddlerhood and early 
school age, children approach the process of self-evaluation 
from a framework of either self-confi dence or self-doubt. 
They may expect to find tasks easy to accomplish and 
approach them vigorously, or they may anticipate failure 
and approach tasks with hesitation.
In research involving children in the 8 to 13 age range, 
Susan Harter (1985b, 1993) devised a method for assess-
ing children’s perceptions of competence in five specific 
domains: scholastic competence, athletic competence, lik-
ability by peers, physical appearance, and behavioral con-
duct. She also measured general or global self-esteem. Her 
research was guided by the idea that by the age of 8, chil-
dren not only differentiate specifi c areas of competence, but 
view certain areas as more important than others. She found 
that self-esteem is highest in those children who view them-
selves as competent in domains that they judge to be impor-
tant. Competence in relatively unimportant domains is not 
strongly related to overall self-esteem.
Feelings of Pride
Feelings of pride are typically associated with positive 
self-evaluations. In general, children as well as adults feel 
happy when they succeed at an achievement-related task. 
However, the experience of pride depends in part on the 
child’s perceptions about the cause of their success. As chil-
dren mature, their feelings of pride after a success become 
increasingly linked to whether they attribute the success to 
internal factors such as their own ability or effort as com-
pared to external factors such as the poor preparation of the 
other children or a teacher who is an easy grader (Graham & 
Weiner, 1986). In experimental tests of these relationships, 
young children ages 5 and 6 felt about the same degree of 
pride whether the success was due to internal or external

who are excited and interested but not overly tense are more 
likely to perceive themselves as capable of succeeding.
Self-efficacy judgments are related to children’s per-
ceptions of their likelihood of success. These judgments 
also determine the factors to which children attribute their 
success or failure (McAuley, Duncan, & McElroy, 1989; 
Pajares, 1996). In the face of diffi culty or failure, children 
who have confi dence in their abilities and high self-effi cacy 
will work harder to master challenges. They will attribute 
their diffi culties to a failure to try hard enough, and they 
will redouble their efforts. Children who have a low sense 
of self-efficacy tend to give up in the face of difficulty 
because they attribute their failure to a basic lack of ability 
(Bandura & Schunck, 1981). The level of self-effi cacy also 
affects how children prepare to handle new challenges. In 
their thoughts, emotions, and preparation for action, those 
who are preoccupied by self-doubts differ from those who 
believe in themselves.
Children with high levels of self-efficacy related to 
academic achievement are likely to set challenging goals 
for themselves. They are also likely to regulate their learn-
ing behaviors by deliberately enlisting a number of strat-
egies, including concentrating, organizing their work, 
fi nding a good place to study, taking notes in class, and 
completing their homework assignments so that they have 
the best chances of reaching their goals (Zimmerman, 
Bandura, & Martinez-Pons, 1992; Bandura, Barbaranelli, 
Caprara, & Pastorelli, 1996). The following case study 
of Becca illustrates the behaviors and thoughts of a mid-
dle school student whose sense of self-effi cacy has been 
declining.
area (e.g., mathematics, writing, or gymnastics) is based on 
their past accomplishments in that area. There is a bidirec-
tional relationship between achievement in a domain and 
one’s confidence about being able to perform well in that 
domain. High confi dence will lead to better performance, 
and better performance will increase one’s confi dence. Over 
time, children compare their performance across various 
domains and begin to establish a more stable view of areas 
where they expect to do well and areas where they antici-
pate greater diffi culty (Denissen, Zarrett, & Eccles, 2007). 
Success experiences increase self-effi cacy, whereas repeated 
failures diminish it. Failure experiences are especially detri-
mental when they occur early in the process of trying to mas-
ter a task. Many boys and girls are diverted from mastering 
such sports as tennis and baseball because they have made 
mistakes early in their participation. They develop doubts 
about their abilities, which then prevent them from persist-
ing in the task.
The second source of information is vicarious experi-
ence. Seeing a person similar to oneself perform a task suc-
cessfully may raise one’s sense of self-effi cacy; seeing a person 
similar to oneself fail at a task may lower it.
Verbal persuasion is the third source. Children can 
be encouraged to believe in themselves and try a new task. 
Persuasion is likely to be most effective with children who 
already have confi dence in their abilities, and it helps boost 
their performance level.
The fourth source is physical state. People monitor 
their body states in making judgments about whether they 
can do well or not. When children feel too anxious or fright-
ened, they are likely to anticipate failure. In contrast, children

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
Social Expectations
Several theories of the self suggest that the appraisals and 
expectations of signifi cant others become incorporated into 
one’s own self-concept and become a source for self-evaluation 
(Chen, Boucher, & Tapias, 2006). Self-esteem is based on the 
general positive regard and approval of others and on the spe-
cifi c expectations they have for one’s ability and achievement in 
certain areas of performance (Jussim, 1990a; Harter, 1993). In 
attempting to assess their own abilities, children rely on many 
external sources of evaluation, including school grades, teach-
ers’ comments, and parent and peer evaluations (Hergovich, 
Sirsch, & Felinger, 2002). If feedback from important adults 
suggests to children that they are cooperative, intelligent, and 
creative, these attributes are likely to be incorporated into their 
self-evaluations. Children who see themselves as cooperative 
and intelligent are likely to approach social and intellectual 
tasks with optimistic expectations about their performance. 
Conversely, feedback suggesting lack of cooperation, intelli-
gence, or creativity can produce a pessimistic or antagonistic 
approach to the challenges of skill development. Even one’s 
self-efficacy can be influenced by how a relevant other has 
evaluated one’s performance in the past.
Repeated failure information or remarks that imply lack of 
ability tend to make children less confi dent of success in subse-
quent tasks. This pattern of expectations appears to crystallize 
during grades 2 and 3. Preschoolers do not make systematic 
use of success or failure feedback in predicting their next suc-
cess (Parsons & Ruble, 1977). Even in the fi rst grade, children’s 
expectations about the grades they will receive on their first 
report cards are not clearly related to their IQs or to parents’ or 
teachers’ expectations, nor are they closely related to the chil-
dren’s later estimates of their grades. By the end of the fi rst grade, 
however, children begin to be more accurate predictors of their 
performance (Alexander & Entwisle, 1988; Entwisle, Alexander, 
Pallas, & Cadigan, 1987). By middle childhood, children are 
more aware of their teachers’ expectations for their performance 
and are likely to mirror those expectations in their own attitudes 
about school, academic achievement, and school behaviors 
(Weinstein et al., 1987; Alexander, Entwisle, & Kabbani, 2001).
Teachers’ Expectations: The Self-Fulfilling Proph-
ecy. The feedback that students receive from their teachers 
is not wholly objective. Teachers’ expectations about their 
students’ abilities may be based on objective assessments, 
but they may also be derived from stereotypes about certain 
types of children or from biases based on prior experiences, 
like having a child’s older siblings in class in prior years or 
hearing unfavorable comments from other teachers. Merton 
(1948) suggested that problems may arise through a process 
that he called the self-fulfilling prophecy. This concept 
refers to the idea that false or inaccurate beliefs can produce 
a personal reality that corresponds with them.
In the original study on the effect of teacher expecta-
tions on student performance, teachers were led to believe 
that certain students were late bloomers who would show 
major gains in IQ later on in the school year. These children, 
CASE STUDY
BECCA
Becca, an eighth grader, is disengaging from school.
Under the weight of her family burdens, Becca’s academic 
confi dence has begun to falter.… In sixth grade, Becca was 
an A student; at the end of seventh grade, she asked to be 
removed from the advanced math class; and by the middle 
of eighth grade, her grades in all of her classes were drifting 
to low C’s.
A quiet girl, Becca says she has never spoken much in 
class (“unless I’m really, really sure of an answer, and some-
times not even then”), but with her self-esteem fl agging, 
she stops volunteering entirely. She even begins to see her 
silence as an advantage: As long as she’s perceived as shy, 
her teachers won’t notice that she has, in truth, disengaged 
from school.… In a sense, Becca is invisible. Her teachers 
don’t see her as someone in need of counseling or special 
help because, although her grades have dropped, she is 
never combustible: She never, for instance, yells in class, 
pounds desks, fi ghts with other children, or conspicuously 
challenges authority. Becca’s is a passive resistance—a typi-
cally feminine resistance. By opting out rather than acting 
out, Becca still conforms to the image of the ideal female 
student—quiet, compliant, obedient; as such she is easily 
overlooked, or seen as making choices rather than express-
ing psychological distress. “Becca is so quiet,” her math 
teacher admits, “she gets lost in the crowd. I don’t like 
that to happen, but it has happened with her. She doesn’t 
disrupt. She always looks like she’s paying attention, but 
maybe she’s not. I don’t know.”
“Maybe she thinks she’ll be more cool as a C student,” her 
history teacher says. “But she doesn’t even get it together 
after she gets the bad grade. I’ll say, ‘Becca, you have a D, 
you may fail,’ but then she doesn’t turn in the next homework 
assignment, which is really easy. But I think of her as someone 
who’s responsible for her own grade, and I let her be respon-
sible for that.”

CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. How would you describe Becca’s level of academic self-
effi cacy?
 2. Using Bandura’s model, how are the four factors of enac-
tive attainments, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasion, 
and physical states contributing to her self-effi cacy?
 3. What would you say is missing from Bandura’s theory of 
self-effi cacy that is illustrated in the case of Becca?
 4. What are some gender issues that may underlie this case? 
In what ways is Becca’s situation made possible because of 
gender stereotypes?
 5. How might teachers intervene to reverse this decline in 
self-effi cacy?
 6. What might be the likely outcome for Becca if this pattern 
of disengagement continues?

angry toward the students, particularly if they believed the 
students were capable of good work. Children make attribu-
tions about what might make a teacher angry at a student. 
According to studies by Graham and Weiner (1991) when 
children observe that a teacher is angry, they are likely to 
infer that the student did something or failed to do some-
thing that was within their control, which interfered with 
their performance. They may conclude that if the teacher 
is angry, the student did something wrong such as fooling 
around instead of studying for a test, or watching television 
instead of fi nishing their homework. 
When children of low ability suddenly begin putting forth 
a great deal of effort, teachers were likely to take pride in their 
own accomplishments, believing they had really helped these 
children become more motivated. If low-ability students who 
were trying hard failed, teachers felt a sense of guilt. Teachers 
were more willing to accept personal responsibility for certain 
confi gurations of student success and failure than for others. 
The students who made teachers the angriest were the bright 
ones who did not try hard (Prawat, Byers, & Anderson, 1983). 
Research on teacher expectations illustrates how social 
expectations infl uence both perceptions of others and the 
quality of interpersonal communication. Intervention pro-
grams to improve the reading performance of fi rst graders 
in low-income minority schools have built on this line of 
research. Specifi c strategies were designed to help teachers 
recognize their assumptions about student ability and effort 
and to convey encouragement and positive attainment mes-
sages to students (Good & Nichols, 2001).
Certain conditions make children more or less vulner-
able to internalizing false expectations. Children who are 
unsure about their abilities and children who are learn-
ing something for the fi rst time may be more likely to rely 
on the information they receive from others to assess their 
chosen at random from among first and second graders, 
actually did show increases in IQ of 10 to 15 points by the 
end of the school year in comparison to the control group 
(Rosenthal & Jacobson, 1968).
Subsequent studies of the self-fulfi lling prophecy in class-
room settings have shown that it has a consistent but compara-
tively small effect on student performance (Rosenthal, 1994, 
1995). In one longitudinal study, students’ math achievement 
and mathematics self-concept data were collected at the end 
of fi fth grade, early in sixth grade, and at the beginning of sev-
enth grade. Teachers’ expectations about student performance 
were assessed early in sixth grade as well. Both student achieve-
ment at the end of fi fth grade and teachers’ expectations in sixth 
grade were predictive of students’ achievement at the beginning 
of seventh grade. In the analysis of these data, the researchers 
found that the self-fulfilling prophecy (the impact of teacher 
expectations separate from prior student achievement scores) 
was observable only for those students who were in the low 
achievement group. Both overestimates and underestimates of 
these students’ abilities in sixth grade were predictive of the stu-
dents’ achievement in seventh grade. There was some tendency 
for overestimates to have a greater impact in boosting these stu-
dents’ performance than for underestimates to depress the stu-
dents’ performance (Madon, Jussim, & Eccles, 1997).
Teachers’ expectations for a student’s performance are 
infl uenced by their assessments of both the student’s ability 
and effort. In a study of elementary school teachers, a rela-
tionship was found between the teachers’ explanations for 
students’ success and failure and the emotions that teachers 
felt under the various conditions. These emotional reactions 
were assumed to be the major cues that teachers sent to stu-
dents about their performances. 
When teachers believed that students’ poor perfor-
mances were due to a lack of effort, they were likely to feel

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
Expanding on the relationship between gender role bias 
and the socialization of children’s competencies and interests, 
Eccles (1993) proposed the following model (see Figure 8.3).
The evidence suggests that general (parental) gender 
role beliefs infl uence perceptions of individual chil-
dren’s competencies and interests, which in turn affect 
the kinds of experiences parents provide.… Essentially, 
we believe that parents’ gender role stereotypes, in in-
teraction with their children’s sex, affect the following 
mediators: (1) parents’ causal attributions for the chil-
dren’s performance; (2) parents’ emotional reaction to 
their children’s performance in various activities; (3) 
the importance parents attach to their children acquir-
ing various skills; (4) the advice parents provide their 
children regarding involvement in various skills; and 
(5) the activities and toys parents provide. In turn, we 
predict that these subtle and explicit mediators infl u-
ence the development of the following child outcomes 
across the various gender-role-stereotyped activity do-
mains: (1) children’s confi dence in their ability; (2) chil-
dren’s interest in mastering various skills; (3) children’s 
affective reaction to participating in various activities, 
and as a consequence of these self and task perceptions, 
(4) the amount of time and type of effort the children 
devote to mastering and demonstrating various skills. 
(p. 170)
A number of studies support the underlying dynam-
ics of this model. Independent of actual gender differences 
in specific domains, including math, sports, and English, 
abilities. Being in a new situation, like moving to a new school 
or changing from elementary to middle school, may increase 
a child’s dependence on social expectations for performance. 
In middle childhood, when many new domains of skill devel-
opment are first being introduced, children may be more 
vulnerable to the effects of biased perceptions and erroneous 
expectations than are older children (Jussim, 1990b).
Some children appear to monitor their social environ-
ment more self-consciously than others (Musser & Browne, 
1991). High self-monitoring children are more aware of the 
emotional and nonverbal behavior of others and make more 
use of social information to evaluate and regulate their own 
behavior. These children are more responsive to subtle forms 
of feedback about their performance, taking in more infor-
mation about social expectations for their performance than 
do the children who are comparatively oblivious to the intri-
cacies of the social environment.
Parents’ Expectations. Parents’ as well as teachers’ 
expectations infl uence children’s perceptions of their abili-
ties. This process was demonstrated in a study of parents’ 
and children’s attitudes toward mathematical aptitude (Par-
sons, Adler, & Kaczala, 1982). Children in Grades 5 to 11 
and their parents were asked about their attitudes toward 
the children’s mathematics achievement. Parents had lower 
expectations for their daughters’ math achievement than for 
their sons’. They believed that mathematics is more diffi cult 
and requires more effort for girls than for boys. Their expec-
tations about their children’s aptitude were better predictors 
of the children’s self-assessments than were the children’s 
own past performances in mathematics.

initiative, and industry increases, they may interpret parental 
monitoring as evidence of a lack of confi dence in their ability 
to make good decisions or to function competently (Pomer-
antz & Eaton, 2000).
In contrast to illusions of incompetence, some people 
have illusions of competence. In four separate studies, 
researchers found that those participants who scored in the 
lowest 12% of test takers on measures of grammar, logic, 
and humor substantially overestimated their own abilities. 
The extreme lack of ability in an area is accompanied by the 
inability to distinguish accurate from inaccurate responses, 
thus leading to a misconception of competence. In contrast 
to illusions of incompetence, where children underestimate 
their abilities, illusions of competence occur when peo-
ple have such defi ciencies that they do not even realize the 
extent of their limitations (Kruger & Dunning, 1999).
The discussion of self-evaluation highlights children’s 
sensitivity to their social environment. They become aware 
of existing roles and norms and of the sanctions for norm 
violation. Direct experiences with success and failure are 
important, but they are also embedded in the context of 
social expectations. In this age period, with the skills of 
metacognition and perspective taking, children come to 
understand that people may alter their behavior in order 
to project an image that will receive a favorable evaluation 
from others. They can recognize that under certain circum-
stances they may wish to alter their own self-presentation 
in order to receive positive social evaluation from parents, 
teachers, or peers. This kind of motivated modifi cation of 
self-presentation is sometimes referred to as brownnosing or 
kissing up. Even though this behavior can be a subject of 
critical taunts from peers, the motivated student may real-
ize that this strategy is necessary in order to receive posi-
tive evaluations or high grades. For example, Perry notices 
that his English teacher is especially nice to a friend of his 
who reads poetry during their free time. Perry knows that his 
friend is not at all interested in poetry, but that the friend has 
received positive grades from the teacher, who believes that 
the child is really interested in English literature. Taking a 
cue from this strategy, Perry begins to bring a book of poetry 
to class and makes frequent eye contact with the teacher to 
convey interest. He fi nds that the teacher now smiles at him 
more often, shows new interest in his ideas, and gives his 
written work a more positive evaluation. Perry concludes 
that the image he is presenting of himself as one who likes 
English literature is infl uencing his teacher’s evaluation of his 
work. Thus, the notion that self-evaluation is shaped by the 
refl ected appraisal from others becomes more complicated 
as children become skilled in image management (Banerjee, 
2002;  Hergovich, Sirsch, & Felinger, 2002).
By the end of middle childhood, children have had 
enough school experience that they can detect favoritism, 
bias, and unfair treatment and can devise strategies to protect 
themselves from the impact of negative biases. They are able 
to judge their abilities by considering their mastery level and 
the amount of effort they have to exert in order to do well. 
parents’ stereotypes about which gender is more talented 
in a particular area infl uence their perceptions of their own 
child’s competence in that area. Parents’ perceptions of com-
petence are directly related to their children’s perception of 
competence (Eccles, Jacobs, & Harold, 1990).
A longitudinal study followed a cohort of children, start-
ing when they were in fi rst grade, in 1982, through to the 
end of high school. Data were collected from these children, 
who were from various socioeconomic and family back-
grounds; from their parents; and from school records. The 
study examined factors that placed children from this group 
at risk for dropping out of school. Parental attitudes about 
their children’s school success and school completion were 
signifi cant predictors of children’s school achievement start-
ing in fi rst grade and continuing through middle school and 
high school. Although socioeconomic status was a powerful 
predictor of dropping out of school, parental attitudes about 
their child’s ability and promise moderated the impact of 
social class for students in low, middle, and high resource 
groups, but especially in the higher resource groups (Alexan-
der, Entwisle, & Kabbani, 2001).
Illusions of Incompetence and Competence. Some 
children who perform well on tests of academic achievement 
(at the 90th percentile or above) perceive themselves as below 
average in academic ability, a phenomenon described as the 
illusion of incompetence. These children expect lower 
levels of success, are less confi dent, attempt less challeng-
ing tasks, and say that their schoolwork is more demanding 
than peers of similarly high ability who have more positive 
self-evaluations. It appears that parents play a central role in 
establishing these children’s low assessments of themselves. 
Children who have an illusion of incompetence think that 
their parents have a low opinion of their abilities and expect 
little of them. They see their fathers, in particular, as hav-
ing rigorous standards that they are not expected to meet 
( Phillips, 1984, 1987).
The parent-child dynamics that underlie this negative 
assessment were observed in a study involving children 
with high academic ability who had varying levels of per-
ceived academic competence. Children worked with their 
mothers and fathers on solvable and unsolvable tasks. The 
fathers of children who had low perceptions of their own 
academic competence were found to interact with their 
children in more critical or unsupportive ways than did 
the fathers of children who had high perceptions of their 
academic competence. The children who had illusions of 
incompetence were more emotionally upset and depen dent 
when they approached the unsolvable tasks (Wagner & 
Phillips, 1992).
Cross-sectional research suggests that children may infer 
messages of incompetence from parental control. In a com-
parison of children in grades 2 through 5, the older children 
interpreted parental helping, monitoring, and decision mak-
ing as evidence that the parents thought they were incom-
petent. As children get older and their desire for autonomy,

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
In addition to its contribution to fi tness and enthusiasm 
for physical activity, participation in team play provides a 
context for preworking—the skills and orientations that will 
apply to the world of work and to functioning in the fam-
ily group (Van der Vegt, Emans, & Van De Vliert, 2001). 
Participation on a team may create a climate for collectivist 
values such as cooperation, interdependence, and the subor-
dination of the individual’s goals to the team’s success (Ker-
nan & Greenfi eld, 2005). Team participation raises issues 
of moral judgment and moral behavior, especially regarding 
cheating, sportsmanship, and prosocial or antisocial behav-
iors (Lee, Whitehead, & Ntoumanis, 2007). In addition to 
mastery of skills and knowledge about a particular sport, 
team participation provides opportunities to spend time with 
friends and to celebrate together (Mowling, Brock, & Hastie, 
2006). Three signifi cant characteristics of the experience of 
team membership are relevant to development during this 
stage: (1) interdependence, (2) the division of labor, and (3) 
competition.
Interdependence
Team membership carries with it an awareness that one’s acts 
may affect the success or failure of the entire group. There is 
a defi nite emphasis on winning and losing, and children may 
be ostracized or ridiculed if they contribute to a team loss 
(Mowling, Brock, & Hastie, 2006). Although team sports do 
provide opportunities for individual recognition, it is quite 
clear that team success casts a halo over even the poorest 
players and team failure a shadow over even the best. Partici-
pation in team sports provides lessons in interdependence. 
All of the team members rely on one another, and ideally, 
it is to everyone’s advantage to assist the weaker members 
They are also able to decide when someone else might be a 
better judge of their abilities than they are (Burton & Mitch-
ell, 2003). The more children are embedded in strong, sup-
portive social relationships, the more confi dence they will 
have in their general worth, and the more likely they will be 
to arrive at accurate assessments of their own abilities.
Team Play
Objective 5. To describe a new level of complexity in 
play as children become involved in team sports and 
athletic competition, and form more enduring in-group 
and out-group attitudes.
During middle childhood, a new dimension is added to the 
quality of a child’s play. Children begin to participate in team 
sports and, as a result, gain a sense of team success as well 
as personal success. Team sports are generally more com-
plicated than the kinds of games described as group play in 
Chapter 7. The rules are so complex that they may require a 
referee or an umpire if they are to be followed accurately. In 
these sports, children join together into teams that remain 
together for the duration of the game. Some children join 
teams that play together for an entire season, such as Little 
League. A growing interest in physical activity and fi tness in 
adulthood has shed new light on the importance of involve-
ment in team sports in childhood and early adolescence. In a 
study of adult men ages 32 to 60, researchers found a strong 
link between voluntary participation in team sports in the 
middle childhood period and continued physical activity in 
adulthood (Taylor, Blair, Cummings, Wun, & Malina, 1999).

interwoven into the world of work, helping to give focus 
and drive to day-to-day work-related obligations and tasks. 
When adults look back on their childhood play experi-
ences, many recall the excitement associated with competi-
tion and continue to long for this excitement in their daily 
life. In one study of women in traditional and nontraditional 
professions, for example, more professional businesswomen 
and other women in nontraditional fi elds remembered expe-
riences playing in competitive sports and being on teams 
with both boys and girls during their childhood (Coats & 
 Overman, 1992).
In contrast to those who are energized by the challenges 
of competition, some children are especially sensitive to the 
pain of failure. The public embarrassment and private shame 
that accompany failure are powerful emotions. Some chil-
dren will go to remarkable extremes to avoid failing. In team 
sports, each game ends with a winning and a losing side. 
Children who have a low sense of self-esteem are more likely 
to experience intense anxiety about losing in a competitive 
situation (Brustad, 1988). Involvement in team sports is 
guaranteed to bring with it the bitterness of losing and the 
commitment to avoid it at all costs—experiences that drive 
some children away from sports and into other domains of 
competence.
Cooperation
A complementary concept is cooperation: Team members 
learn that if the team as a whole is to do its best, the team 
members must help one another. Rather than playing all 
the roles, a team member tries to help every other member 
play his role as well as possible. Cooperation takes many 
forms: Members share resources, take time to help other 
team members improve their skills, plan strategies together, 
work together on the fi eld, encourage each other, bring out 
the equipment, or clean up after the game. In many sports, 
there is a dynamic tension between competition and coop-
eration. Team members may compete with each other for 
a more desirable position or for the status of being the top 
player. At the same time, the team members know that they 
have to support each other, especially when they play against 
another team.
Cooperation is a fundamental feature of evolution. Selec-
tion favors families and groups whose members are coop-
erative. In the evolutionary past warfare between competing 
groups was common. Those groups that were able to foster 
greater cooperation among members had a better chance of 
survival (Pennisi, 2009). It appears that the human brain 
has evolved so that the individual acts to defend the group 
against threat, even if such efforts result in exposure to dan-
ger to the self. Under conditions of intergroup competition, 
the brain produces oxytocin, a hormone that enhances empa-
thy, generosity, cooperation, and trust. The adaptive value of 
cooperation is supported by this hormonal activity, which 
strengthens the individual’s positive sentiments toward 
the group and willingness to promote the group’s welfare 
(De Dreu, Greer et al., 2010).
in improving the quality of their play. Over time, the team 
provides what is sometimes referred to as a superordinate 
group identity, such that the individual members who bring 
their own individual racial/ethnic, cultural, or socioeconomic 
group differences are willing to suppress these differences 
and work together for the success of the group (Jackson 
et al., 2002). The best coaches are noted for inspiring this 
sense of interdependence and mutual support among team 
members. They urge team members to work together to 
improve their skills. Often, when teams are closely matched, 
it is the unexpected success of the weaker players that con-
tributes to a victory.
Division of Labor
Through participation with peers on teams, children dis-
cover that division of labor is an effective strategy for 
attaining a goal. Children learn that each position on a 
team has a unique function and that the team has the best 
chance of winning if each player performs her specific 
function rather than trying to do the work of all the other 
players. The concept of the team encompasses the variety 
of activities in which each of the team members actually 
engages. 
A team becomes an experiential model for approach-
ing other complex organizations. Once children learn that 
certain goals can best be attained when tasks are divided 
among a group of people, they begin to conceptualize the 
principles behind the organization of social communities. 
They recognize that some children are better suited to han-
dling one aspect of the task and others to handling another. 
Some children enjoy the skill development associated with 
team play; others enjoy learning the rules and devising 
strategies; others especially value peer companionship; and 
still others have a strong inner motive to compete and win 
(Ntoumanis, Vazou, & Duda, 2007). The distribution of 
roles to fi t the children’s individual skills and preferences 
is a subtle element of the learning that is acquired through 
team play.
Competition
Team play teaches children about competition. In team 
sports, both sides cannot win; success for one side must 
result in failure for the other. If the team experience is a labo-
ratory for learning lessons about the larger social commu-
nity, this characteristic promotes a view of social situations 
in competitive terms. Some adults think of business, politics, 
popularity, and even interpersonal confl icts as win-lose situ-
ations, in which the primary goal is to beat one’s opponents. 
The idea of a win-win strategy to resolve confl ict is very for-
eign in this context.
Winning is a great high. Many young adults have fond 
memories associated with winning an important game or a 
big match. They hope to reexperience the energy that occurs 
as a result of winning as they approach their adult activi-
ties. The metaphor of playing on a winning team is deeply

goal. The other team is seen as the enemy, and there is no 
alternative to trying one’s hardest to defeat it. Antagonism 
toward the out-group is valued in team sports, and any 
attempt to assist the other team is seen as unethical. Moving 
to the level of interethnic or intertribal confl ict, children may 
learn that moral principles that apply to members of the in-
group do not necessarily apply to members of the out-group 
(Triandis, 1990). In the extreme, adults may justify killing 
a member of an out-group under conditions of terrorism 
or war.
Children may belong to more than one team. Depend-
ing on the situation, children can view one another as mem-
bers of their in-group in one sport and as members of an 
out-group in another sport. For example, Ryan and his 
friend Tom were on the school soccer team together, but 
they belonged to different summer baseball leagues. During 
the summer, they had to compete against each other, so it 
usually turned out that they spent more time together and 
were closer friends during the school year than they were 
during the summers. Categorizing a peer as a member of an 
in-group or an out-group will lead to different attitudes and 
behaviors toward that person.
As children get older, their tendency to show unques-
tioning favoritism for their in-group is tempered by social 
reality and their experiences of participating in multiple 
groups (Verkuyten & De Wolf, 2007). They can evaluate 
information that suggests that one team or nationality or 
ethnic group is better than another, and use that informa-
tion to temper their in-group favoritism or their out-group 
prejudices. At the same time, functional messages that high-
light the benefi ts of being in one group over another can 
strengthen in-group bias. For example, research on gender 
identity suggests that young children are especially likely 
to attribute positive qualities to their own sex and to exag-
gerate the differences between their sex and the opposite 
sex. When sex is used as a functional category, for example, 
comparing boys’ and girls’ conduct or school performance, 
these in-group preferences are likely to be strengthened 
(Egan & Perry, 2001). Table 8.2 shows the in-group and 
out-group attitudes that may result from experiences in 
team play.
In-Group and Out-Group Attitudes
Team membership provides a microsystem for observing the 
formation of in-group and out-group attitudes and behav-
iors. All human societies observe distinctions between in-
group and out-group attitudes and behaviors (Haidt, 2007). 
The in-group members share common norms, goals, and 
values. They also share a common fate—in sports, for exam-
ple, the team wins or loses as a team. Feelings of cohesive-
ness with and similarity to members of an in-group prompt 
behaviors that are supportive of that group’s survival. Typi-
cally, individuals distribute resources so that members of 
their in-group receive more and members of the out-group 
receive less. However, when in-group norms emphasize fair-
ness and reject discrimination, members are more likely to 
treat members of the out-group with fairness. Thus, in-group 
norms can influence the degree to which out-group hos-
tilities are encouraged and expressed or suppressed (Jetten, 
Spears, & Manstead, 1996).
The out-group is any group whose goals are either in 
opposition to or inconsistent with the goals of the in-group. 
Any group may be perceived as an out-group, even though it 
does not actually pose any physical threat to members of the 
in-group. Students at one university may perceive students 
at another university as an out-group (e.g., the longstand-
ing football rivalry between Ohio State University and the 
University of Michigan). Students enrolled in one program 
or major may view students in a similar but competing major 
as an out-group (e.g., chemical engineers vs. electrical engi-
neers). In experimental studies, in-groups and out-groups 
have been formed based simply on wearing a blue or yel-
low badge, or based on those with blue eyes and those with 
brown eyes (Bigler, Spears, & Brown, 2001; Verkuyten & De 
Wolf, 2007). Children as young as age 5 are aware of the sta-
tus of their group. If they believe that their group has posi-
tive qualities and is valued, they are more likely to want to 
remain in the group and to see themselves as similar to other 
group members (Nesdale & Flesser, 2001; Bigler, Brown, & 
Markell, 2001).
Children learn to see the outcome of competition as a 
win-lose situation. For sports teams, the out-group’s goal of 
winning is in direct competition with the in-group’s similar

The Psychosocial Crisis: Industry versus Inferiority | 321
The combined efforts resulted in improved communication 
skills, reduced aggressiveness, increased interest in basket-
ball as an activity, and some improvement in sports ability 
(Hupp & Reitman, 1999). Well-designed sports programs 
can have a broad impact on intellectual and social devel-
opment by combining increased competence in physical 
activity with related emphasis on the cognitive and social 
components of team play.
The Psychosocial Crisis: 
Industry versus Inferiority
Objective 6. To explain the psychosocial crisis of 
industry versus inferiority; the central process through 
which the crisis is resolved; education; the prime 
adaptive ego quality of competence; and the core 
pathology of inertia.
According to psychosocial theory (Erikson, 1963), as a 
result of the resolution of the psychosocial crisis of indus-
try versus inferiority, a person’s fundamental attitude 
toward work is established during middle childhood. As 
children develop skills and acquire personal standards of 
evaluation, they make an initial assessment of whether or 
not they will be able to make a contribution to the social 
community. They also make an inner commitment to 
strive for success. Some children are keenly motivated to 
compete against a standard of excellence and achieve suc-
cess. Other children have low expectations about the pos-
sibility of success and are not motivated by achievement 
situations. The strength of a child’s need to achieve suc-
cess is well established by the end of this stage (Atkinson 
& Birch, 1978).
Supporting the psychosocial perspective, results of the 
American Psychological Association’s Stress in America sur-
vey indicate that children in middle childhood experience a 
variety of worries linked to the themes of industry and infe-
riority (Munsey, 2010). Among children ages 8 to 12, 44% 
worry about doing well in school; 28% worry about whether 
their family will have enough money; and 22% worry about 
getting along with their friends. Their worries are associated 
with physical symptoms including headaches, sleep distur-
bances, and upset stomachs. The survey found that parents 
tended to underestimate the extent to which their children 
were worrying about family fi nances or doing well in school, 
and were often unaware of the physical symptoms their 
children were experiencing. These findings illustrate the 
domains in which the confl ict of industry versus inferiority 
are being played out for children in the United States. They 
suggest that children are keenly attuned to themes of evalu-
ation and competence, not only in their academic lives, but 
in social relationships and in the adult world of work and 
family fi nancial well-being. 
Team Play as a Context for Development
Participation in team sports provides socialization experi-
ences that have both positive and negative consequences. For 
most children, belonging to a team, making friends, learn-
ing new skills, and enjoying the sense of success associated 
with a collaborative effort are positive experiences of middle 
childhood. For example, in a study of what young people 
value about their sports experiences, most children placed 
the greatest emphasis on enjoyment and personal achieve-
ment, and the least emphasis on winning (Lee, Whitehead, 
& Balchin, 2000). However, we all know of instances where 
rivalries escalate into peer hatreds, children from neighbor-
ing schools turn against each other, and coaches humiliate 
and degrade children in order to instill a commitment to the 
team and a determination to win. Perhaps the question is 
whether—particularly in team sports—the focal point of the 
activity is to enhance children’s natural impulses for com-
petence and skill elaboration, or whether the team activity 
becomes a way for adults to vent their own frustrated needs 
for domination and power.
Team play has implications for both social and intel-
lectual development. Children who play team sports see 
themselves as contributors to a larger effort and learn 
to anticipate the consequences of their behavior for the 
group. Team play creates a valuable context for the for-
mation of interpersonal relationships. Inclusion in a 
positive team experience often results in a child’s identi-
fication with the coach and other team members. These 
new emotional investments can expand the child’s sense 
of well-being and social support (Blanchard, Perreault, 
& Vallerand, 1998; Wylleman, 2000). In a comparison of 
seventh-grade children who were or were not involved in 
organized team sports, teachers rated the children who 
were involved in sports as more socially competent, and 
less withdrawn. There were no differences between the 
groups in aggression. However, among the boys, those 
involved in sports also reported a broader range of delin-
quent behaviors (McHale et al., 2005).
Games that involve teams are generally so complex that 
children are called on to learn many rules, make judgments 
about those rules, plan strategies, and assess the strengths 
and weaknesses of the other players. All of these character-
istics of participation in team sports can stimulate cognitive 
growth. In one study, for example, children were divided 
into soccer experts and soccer novices (Schneider & Bjork-
lund, 1992). The experts had an impressive depth of knowl-
edge about the game of soccer and, when given a memory 
task involving soccer-related items, were able to use their 
expertise to perform at a high level.
Interest in sports and competitive team play has been 
used as a motivational hook to promote other areas of 
school ability. For example, children diagnosed with atten-
tion defi cit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were recruited 
for a basketball camp. Many of these children had diffi culties 
regulating their impulses and showed poor social skills. The 
camp focused on athletic competence and sportsmanship.

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
Inferiority
What experiences of middle childhood might generate a sense 
of inferiority? Feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy come 
from two sources: the self and the social environment. Alfred 
Adler (1935) directed attention to the central role that organ 
inferiority may play in shaping a person’s perceptions of his 
abilities. Organ inferiority is any physical or mental limitation 
that prevents the acquisition of certain skills. Children who 
cannot master certain skills experience some feelings of inferi-
ority. Individual differences in aptitude, physical development, 
and prior experience result in experiences of inadequacy in 
some domain. No one can do everything well. Children dis-
cover that they cannot master every skill they attempt. Even 
a child who feels quite positive toward work and fi nds new 
challenges invigorating will experience some degree of inferi-
ority in a specifi c skill that she cannot master. For example, 
students who are born just after the age cutoff date for a par-
ticular sports competition may fi nd that they have a hard time 
competing with the slightly older children in their age group. 
Especially at younger ages, children who are matched with 
others who are 10 to 12 months older may experience disap-
pointment when they cannot compete successfully (Musch & 
Grondin, 2001). For many children who have developmental 
delays or motor impairments, the challenge of experiencing 
mastery in school-based skills can be very frustrating. Disor-
ders of childhood that infl uence school success are discussed 
in the Human Development and Diversity box on page 324.
If success in one area could compensate for failure in 
another, we would be safe in minimizing the effect of indi-
vidual areas of inadequacy on the overall resolution of the 
psychosocial confl ict of industry versus inferiority. However, 
Industry
Industry is an eagerness to acquire skills and perform mean-
ingful work. During middle childhood, many aspects of work 
are intrinsically motivating. The skills are new. They bring 
the child closer to the capacities of adults. Each new skill 
allows the child some degree of independence and may even 
bring new responsibilities that heighten her sense of worth. 
In addition to these self-motivating factors associated with 
increased competence, external sources of reward promote 
skill development. Parents and teachers may encourage chil-
dren to get better grades by giving them material rewards, 
additional privileges, and praise. Peers also encourage the 
acquisition of some skills, although they may have some 
negative input with regard to others. Certain youth organi-
zations, such as scouting and 4-H, make the acquisition of 
skills a very specifi c route to success and higher status.
Kowaz and Marcia (1991) described the construct of 
industry as comprising three dimensions:
 1. The cognitive component of industry was defi ned as the 
acquisition of the basic skills and knowledge that are val-
ued by the culture.
 2. The behavioral component of industry was defi ned as 
the ability to apply the skills and knowledge effectively 
through characteristics such as concentration, persever-
ance, work habits, and goal directedness.
 3. The affective component of industry was defi ned as the 
positive emotional orientation toward the acquisition 
and application of skills and knowledge, such as a gen-
eral curiosity and desire to know, a pride in one’s efforts, 
and an ability to handle the distresses of failure as well as 
the joys of success.
In many countries, children in 
middle childhood are expected 
to contribute to their families’ 
economic well-being. This fam-
ily is picking vegetables. Each 
child’s sense of industry is tied 
to being able to work effi ciently 
at a diffi cult task that is essen-
tial for the family’s survival.

The Central Process: Education | 323
the social environment does not reinforce success in all areas 
equally. During middle childhood, success in reading is 
much more highly rewarded than success in tinkering with 
broken automobile engines. Likewise, success in team sports 
is more highly valued than success in operating a ham radio. 
It is diffi cult for a child who does not excel in culturally val-
ued skills to compensate through the mastery of others.
The social environment also generates feelings of inferior-
ity through the process of social comparison. Particularly in the 
school setting, but even in the home, children are confronted 
by statements suggesting that they are not as good as some 
peer, sibling, or cultural subgroup. Children may be grouped, 
tracked, graded, or publicly criticized on the basis of how 
their efforts compare with someone else’s. The intrinsic plea-
sure of engaging in a task for the challenge it presents confl icts 
with messages that stimulate feelings of self-consciousness, 
competitiveness, and doubt: “I like playing ball, but I’m not 
as good as Ted, so I don’t think I’ll play.” As children become 
increasingly sensitive to peer acceptance and peer rejection, 
they may refuse to try a new activity because they fear the 
possibility of being bettered or embarrassed by their peers.
Finally, the social environment stimulates feelings of 
inferiority through the negative value it places on any kind of 
failure. Two types of failure messages that may contribute to 
feelings of inferiority have been described. One type consists 
of criticisms of the child’s motivation or effort. Such criti-
cisms imply that, if the child had really tried, he could have 
avoided failure. The other type refers more specifi cally to a 
lack of ability. Here, the implication is that the child does not 
have the basic aptitude to succeed. This type of failure mes-
sage is associated with a pattern of attitudes about the self 
that has been described as learned helplessness.
Learned helplessness is a belief that success or fail-
ure have little to do with one’s effort and are largely outside 
one’s control (Seligman, 1975; Nelson, 1987). In a study of 
fourth, fi fth, and sixth graders, children were asked to ver-
balize their thoughts as they worked on various tasks. The 
children’s verbalizations following failure showed a clear dif-
ference between the mastery-oriented children and the help-
less ones. The mastery-oriented children were able to keep a 
positive attitude, increase their problem-solving efforts, and 
use their past mistakes to correct their approach. The help-
less children began to blame themselves (“I never did have 
a good memory”). They emphasized the negative aspects 
of the task or criticized their own abilities and tried to fi nd 
ways to escape from the situation (Diener & Dweck, 1980).
Helpless children tend to discount their successes and, 
in response to even a few remarks about their lack of ability, 
generate a self-defi nition that leads them to take a pessimis-
tic view of their future success. When faced with a diffi cult 
or challenging situation, children described as helpless expe-
rience a negative mood while working on the task, give up 
quickly, blame their failures on a lack of ability, and expect to 
fail in the future (Cain & Dweck, 1995). Messages about fail-
ure usually suggest that there is an external standard of per-
fection—an ideal that the child did not meet. A few failures 
In the modern classroom, children are encouraged to help one 
another solve complex problems.
may generate such strong negative feelings that the child will 
avoid engaging in new tasks in order to avoid future failure. 
Longitudinal research suggests that children who are iden-
tifi ed as helpless in their approach to tasks in kindergarten 
continue to show evidence of these same behaviors, expecta-
tions, and emotions as fi rst graders and as fi fth graders (Zieg-
ert, Kistner, Castro, & Robertson, 2001). 
When children resolve the psychosocial crisis in the 
direction of inferiority they do not conceive of themselves 
as having the potential to contribute to the welfare of the 
larger community. This is a serious consequence. It makes 
the gradual incorporation of the individual into a meaningful 
social group diffi cult to achieve. The irony of the psychoso-
cial crisis at this stage is that the social community, which 
depends on the individual’s motives for mastery for its sur-
vival, is itself such a powerful force in negating those motives 
by communicating messages of inferiority.

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
knowledge and skill development, typically gained within 
the context of school or a formal program of instruction 
(Greenfi eld, Keller, Fuligni, & Maynard, 2003).
The practice of separating formal educational experiences 
from the direct, intimate, hands-on activities of home and com-
munity is only about 200 years old. Before the industrial revo-
lution, most children were educated by participating with their 
parents in the tasks of home life, farming, commerce with neigh-
bors, and participation in religious life (Coleman, 1987). In the 
case of the nobility, children often had tutors who supervised 
their education at home. Today, however, schools bear the pri-
mary responsibility for education. Teaching, which began as an 
extension of the parental role, has become a distinct profession. 
In our culture, education is not the kind of continuous interplay 
between the skilled and the unskilled that it is in more traditional 
cultures. Formal learning takes place in a special building during 
certain hours of the day. To be sure, the success of that experience 
in promoting a child’s skills and a sense of the self as a learner 
generations to its young. This is the meaning of education in 
its broadest sense. It is also the process through which stan-
dards are established for exemplary, acceptable, or unaccept-
able performance. As a result, education is the central process 
through which children experience the sense of mastery and 
accomplishment associated with industry and the critical feed-
back or negative evaluations that are associated with inferiority. 
Education is different from schooling. The term educa-
tion can have different meanings across cultural groups. For 
example, in Spanish the word educación refers to the inter-
nalization of proper, respectful social behavior. The goal of 
educación is character development. For children growing up 
in indigenous communities of north and central America, 
the cultural tradition for education emphasizes learning by 
keenly observing the activities of the adults around them, 
and then participating as they feel ready (López, Correa-
Chávez, Rogoff, & Gutiérrez, 2010). In the United States, 
the term education focuses on an individual’s acquisition of 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN children 
have real diffi culty accomplishing the 
tasks associated with basic areas of 
school achievement? The centrality of 
success in school-based learning for a 
positive resolution of the psychosocial 
crisis of industry versus inferiority 
brings the problem of childhood 
disorders to our attention. Three 
groups of disorders are described 
here, each one posing signifi cant 
challenges for academic and social 
success during middle childhood and 
beyond. Typically, these disorders 
become more disruptive as children 
encounter the increasingly complex 
demands of the school curriculum.
LEARNING DISORDERS
Learning disorders are diagnosed 
when a child’s skills and measured 
abilities in reading, mathematics, 
or written communication are well 
below the child’s grade level and 
the level expected from the child’s 
measured IQ (National Center for 
Learning Disabilities, 2001). Learning 
disorders have been identifi ed in 
approximately 5% of public school 
children in the United States. These 
children are differentiated from others 
who show low performance because 
of mental retardation, poor teaching, 
or cultural factors that interfere 
with school performance. Typically, 
learning disorders are linked with 
defi cits in the primary processing 
system, including speed and accuracy 
of information processing, attention, 
and memory. These defi cits may 
be a result of genetic disorders, 
neurological damage during the 
prenatal period, or lead poisoning 
during childhood, but not all children 
with learning disorders have a history 
of these conditions. Children who 
have learning disorders commonly 
also suffer from low self-esteem and 
are more likely than other children to 
drop out of school.
MOTOR SKILLS DISORDERS
Approximately 4% to 6% of children 
in the 5 to 11 age range have a 
developmental problem in the area 
of motor skills. Motor skills disorders 
may manifest themselves in a variety 
of ways, including diffi culty with 
large or small muscle coordination, 
speed of movement, muscle tone and 
strength, motor planning, and sensory 
integration (Floet & Maldonado-
Durán, 2006). Children with these 
disorders may appear clumsy and 
delayed in the typical acquisition of 
early motor skills such as walking, 
running, tying their shoes, or using 
scissors or a knife. In later school 
years, they have trouble writing with 
a pencil or pen, are slow to develop 
skills in putting together puzzles 
or models, and their athletic skills, 
such as throwing and catching a 
ball, are delayed. These children are 
distinguished from others who have 
some broader medical diagnosis 
such as cerebral palsy. Their delay in 
motor skills interferes with academic 
achievement to the extent that these 
children struggle with any kind of 
written assignment and have diffi culty 
completing projects that require 
manual dexterity. They lack the 
satisfaction of excelling in physical 
activities because even simple motor 
skills such as running or playing catch 
are sources of frustration.

Disorders of Childhood That Interfere with School Success

practice their newly developing skills, receiving continuous 
feedback about their level of competence.
In addition to the acquisition of skills and knowledge, 
schools emphasize an approach to behavior that can be 
described as a combination of citizenship, social competence, and 
study habits. Schools impart a code of conduct that is intended 
to facilitate the teacher’s ability to guide students’ attention, 
help children organize and focus on the tasks at hand, and fos-
ter a respectful, cooperative attitude toward adults and peers. 
Within this framework, all of these qualities become part of the 
sense of industry for those children who adapt well to the cul-
ture of schooling. Some children do not do well in this culture 
of schooling; they do not bring the expected social behaviors 
or study habits; they do not demonstrate the desired qualities 
of cooperation, self-regulation, or rule compliance. As a result, 
they receive negative evaluations, which contribute to feel-
ings of inferiority, leading to a gradual disengagement from the 
educational experiences of school. Low school-engagement 
depends heavily on the ongoing involvement and commitment 
of family members (Hill & Taylor, 2004). However, schools play 
a key role in providing opportunities for skill development and 
mastery, contexts for assessment, social comparison, and self-
evaluation, and socialization for the behavioral characteristics—
including focus, persistence, and organization—that contribute 
to the formation of a personal sense of industry.
During the elementary school years, the goal of educa-
tion is to help children develop the basic tools of learning. 
Central to this process is an introduction to the language of 
concepts, theories, and relationships that will allow them to 
organize their experiences. Schools strive to develop verbal 
and analytic problem solving. Instruction focuses on rules, 
descriptions, and abstract concepts (Tharp, 1989). Chil-
dren are exposed to a range of disciplines and methods of 
inquiry for dealing with complex problems. Throughout the 
educational process, children are presented with problems of 
increasing diffi culty. They are given many opportunities to 
COMMUNICATION 
DISORDERS
Some children experience a 
developmental delay in effective 
social communication. Diffi culties 
may include delays in acquiring new 
vocabulary; oversimplifi ed grammatical 
expressions; limited variation in 
sentence types and structures; 
problems in sound production, such 
as lisping, omitting certain sounds 
in spoken speech, or stuttering; and 
problems in understanding certain 
types of words, expressions, and 
grammatical constructions. About 
3% to 5% of children have some type 
of developmental communication 
disorder that is distinct from mental 
retardation or a hearing impairment 
that infl uences speech (National 
Dissemination Center for Children with 
Disabilities, 2004). These diffi culties 
interfere with academic performance 
especially because school learning 
involves the ongoing communication 
of information and ideas. Children who 
have communication disorders are also 
likely to be the target of peer teasing 
and social ridicule, leading to a pattern 
of social withdrawal or inappropriate 
social participation.
Learning disorders, motor 
skills disorders, and communication 
disorders are three of the more 
common childhood disorders among 
a variety of mental, emotional, and 
physical disabilities that young 
children may face as they struggle to 
resolve the crisis of industry versus 
inferiority. Each of these conditions 
makes it more diffi cult for children 
to succeed in the daily tasks of 
schooling. Children who experience 
these disorders may fi nd it diffi cult 
to carry out projects or to complete 
assignments that others view as 
simple. They may also become 
targets of peer teasing, bullying, or 
rejection. As a result, they may defi ne 
themselves as incompetent, inferior, 
or unable to learn (Valas, 2001). With 
appropriate diagnosis and effective 
intervention, however, children can 
learn strategies to overcome or 
compensate for their disabilities.
Success in coping with a disability 
may, in fact, strengthen a child’s self-
confi dence and provide a basis for 
beliefs of self-effi cacy. Many children 
use the experience of coping with a 
disability as evidence that they can 
face and overcome other diffi cult 
challenges in their lives.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Compare and contrast the kinds of 
problems children with each type 
of disorder described in this box 
might experience in school.
 2. What are some implications of each 
of these disorders for peer relation-
ships and friendship formation?
 3. What steps might a family take to 
help support a child with each of 
these disorders? What role might 
family members play with regard 
to school? Peers? The child’s own 
self-evaluation?
 4. What is the responsibility of 
schools for meeting the needs of 
children with these kinds of dis-
orders? What might be the best 
approach for supporting children 
with these various special needs?
 5. What might be some coping strat-
egies that children use to sustain 
their positive self-regard and to 
pursue high levels of achievement 
despite these challenges?

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
by infantile inferiority. It is the basis for cooperative 
participation in technologies, and it relies, in turn, on 
the logic of tools and skills. (Erikson, 1978, p. 30)
Competence provides the child with a deep confi dence 
in his ability to engage in new situations and do well. This 
idea is illustrated by a study that monitored children’s per-
ceptions of competence during school transitions from grade 
5 to 6 and from grade 6 to 7. The children who had the high-
est levels of perceived competence also had the strongest 
positive feelings about how they were doing in school and 
showed the highest scores on a measure of intrinsic moti-
vation. They wanted to be challenged by their schoolwork 
and they liked working independently and fi guring things 
out for themselves. They expressed curiosity about the tasks, 
saying they would work hard because of their own interest 
rather than to please the teacher or to get good grades (Har-
ter, Whitesell, & Kowalski, 1992).
As she conceptualized the relationship of competence 
and self-esteem, Harter (1993) described two distinct paths 
of development that emerge during middle childhood: daily 
monitoring of self-esteem and stable self-esteem. For one 
group, day-to-day self-esteem is based on current experiences 
of competence and social approval. For these children, feelings 
of self-worth vary depending on how people who are important 
to them treat them that day and on whether the child is com-
paring her accomplishments with someone who is quite a bit 
better, about the same, or not really as competent. The second 
group of children tends to have had many positive experiences 
of approval and competence in the past, which lead to a stable, 
positive sense of self-worth. As a result, these children are not as 
dependent on changing day-to-day conditions to sustain a posi-
tive feeling of worth. They tend to feel good about themselves, 
and thus enter new situations with a more positive, optimistic 
expectation of being liked and doing well. Sensing that they are 
competent, they leave this stage capable of using mastery and 
the resulting coping strategies to add to their repertoire of adap-
tive ego qualities—hope, will, and purpose—as they begin to 
encounter the new demands of early adolescence.
Children who have internalized a sense of competence 
love to learn and work. They are excited about developing 
new skills and are optimistic about being able to achieve suc-
cess. These children are the ones who sign up for new activi-
ties or start neighborhood clubs, want to be on two or three 
sports teams, look forward to fi eld trips and school projects, 
and take pleasure in being asked to help with diffi cult tasks 
like planting trees along the highway, building a new play-
ground, or raising money for earthquake victims. In contrast, 
some children feel a powerful sense of apathy or disinterest, 
which Erikson referred to as inertia.
Inertia
Inertia is the core pathology of middle childhood: “The 
antipathic counterpart of industry, the sense of competent 
mastery to be experienced in the school age, is that inertia 
behaviors in the early elementary grades are as strong predic-
tors of dropping out of school as are grades and test scores 
(Alexander, Entwisle, & Kabbani, 2001).
Schools, as institutions of the larger communities they 
serve, may not have the same expectations for success for all 
the students who attend; and children and their families do not 
all bring the same degree of trust in the educational process to 
their schooling. In some cases, parents fi nd that they have no 
access to or voice in decisions affecting their children. They and 
their children experience barriers to achieving success in the 
skills that schooling values. For example, in a study of La tino 
immigrant families, parents experienced language barriers, an 
inability of teachers to explain their children’s school diffi cul-
ties, and constraints in making contact with teachers. Even 
though parents expressed a desire to support their children’s 
school success, they felt helpless and dismissed as they tried 
to make contact with the school (Ramirez, 2003). The sense 
of inferiority can be provoked for children when they perceive 
that the school devalues or disrespects their parents. 
In some cases, inferiority is infl icted on children through 
abusive treatment by school adults. In the United States, in a 
single school year over 200,000 children were victims of cor-
poral punishment in their schools, a practice that is legal in 
20 states. African American children and children with dis-
abilities were overrepresented in the percentages of groups 
who were punished by paddling and other physical means 
(Murphy, Vagins, & Parker, 2010).
Failure in school and the public ridicule that it brings 
play a central role in the establishment of a negative self-
image, which can be readily linked to the sense of inferior-
ity. Sometimes, children defend themselves against the threat 
of failure messages by blaming others for their failures or 
by bragging that they can succeed in other ways. Much as 
it may appear that these children do not care about school 
or the school’s goals, the school remains a symbol of cul-
tural authority. Children in these groups may conclude that 
the only way to retain a basic sense of self-confi dence is to 
withdraw from school and try to establish their competence 
among their peers by accelerating their transition to adult-
hood through more risky paths (Ogbu, 1987; Clark, 1991; 
Gregory, 1995; Alexander, Entwisle, & Kabbani, 2001).
The Prime Adaptive Ego 
Quality and the Core 
Pathology
Competence
Erikson’s (1982) notion of competence as the prime adaptive 
ego quality is a belief in one’s ability to make sense of and 
master the demands of a situation. 
Competence, in turn, is the free exercise of dexterity 
and intelligence in the completion of tasks, unimpaired

Violence in the Lives 
of Children
Objective 7.  To explore the impact of exposure to 
violence on development during middle childhood.
IN RECENT YEARS the problem of violence in families, 
schools, and neighborhoods has threatened to undermine 
the quality of the psychosocial development and educational 
attainment of many American children. Each year, an esti-
mated 5 million children in the United States are exposed to 
violence in the form of direct physical abuse, domestic vio-
lence between their parents or other members of their house-
hold, and exposure to violent crimes in their neighborhood or 
school. In the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, thou-
sands of U.S. children lost one or both parents in an act of 
violence; thousands more were evacuated from their homes 
and schools; and continuing threats of violence have raised 
new levels of fear about unpredictable harm. Since the start of 
the U.S. military engagement in Iraq in 2003, Iraqi children 
have been exposed to unpredictable violence on a daily basis 
as a result of suicide bombings, roadside explosions, rocket 
and machine gun fi re, military actions, and executions of tar-
geted civilians (www.Iraqbodycount.org, 2007). Estimates by 
the United Nations have been as high as 100 civilian deaths 
a day. The topic of violence in the lives of children illustrates 
the interaction of the biological, psychological, and societal 
systems as they contribute to developmental trajectories.
that constantly threatens to paralyze an individual’s produc-
tive life and is, of course, fatefully related to the inhibition of 
the preceding age, that of play” (Erikson, 1982, pp. 76–77).
Children who leave early school age with a sense of inhi-
bition fail to participate and engage much during middle 
childhood. These are not the students who try and fail repeat-
edly, nor are they the ones whose sense of competence must 
be reconfi rmed daily. Instead, they are students who tend to 
be passive and withdrawn, never engaging psychologically 
with the demands of their schools or their communities. Chil-
dren who leave middle childhood with a sense of inertia con-
tinue to be withdrawn and passive. They will have trouble 
instigating actions or changing the course of events in their 
lives. As a result, they will not be likely to address challenges 
or problems by formulating plans of action, evaluating them, 
and then executing them. Children with a sense of inertia will 
not believe that they can master the challenges they face, and 
thus, they are likely to be swept along by the tide of events.
We all experience periods of inertia—times when we 
cannot muster the energy, enthusiasm, or confi dence to take 
action. We may become besieged by doubts about our com-
petence and worth—doubts that can produce work blocks, 
writer’s block, waves of fatigue, boredom, procrastination, 
or aimlessness. Typically, one can survive a few days or even 
weeks on automatic pilot, doing the bare minimum to sur-
vive. And children may be able to get by for quite a while 
without exercising much energy or direction, especially if 
they are being sustained by parents and teachers. Eventually, 
however, life brings demands for change and expectations 
to meet new challenges that have never been faced before. 
At those times, children who are burdened with a pervasive 
sense of inertia may be unable to cope.

CHAPTER 8 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 Years)
A second consequence of exposure to violence is the 
number of children who are themselves aggressive and vio-
lent. Many studies report a signifi cant relationship between 
victimization or witnessing violence and carrying out violent 
actions on others. The accumulation of exposure to violence 
across several settings, including community, school, and 
home, coupled with low parental monitoring and the likeli-
hood of being a victim of violence, create a context in which 
children exhibit serious violent behaviors (Garbarino, 2001; 
Preski & Shelton, 2001; Weist & Cooley-Quille, 2001). 
A third consequence of exposure to violence is the dis-
ruption it produces in children’s cognitive functioning and 
mental health (Osofsky, 1995). Children who have been 
severely abused or exposed to intense violence are now 
viewed as suffering from symptoms similar to post-traumatic 
stress disorder (Hamblen, 2003). Post-traumatic stress 
 disorder can result from direct experience of a grave threat 
to personal safety or injury, witnessing the injury or death of 
another person, or learning about the violent death or injury 
of a family member or someone close. The response usu-
ally includes “intense fear, helplessness, or horror,” and the 
person typically has recurrent vivid recollections or dreams 
of the event with accompanying strong emotional reactions. 
Children may have recurring nightmares, repeat the same 
play sequences that reenact some part of the traumatic event, 
withdraw interest from activities they used to enjoy, and 
show physical symptoms that they did not have before the 
event, such as stomachaches or headaches. School-age chil-
dren may believe that there were warning signs that would 
have allowed them to avoid the trauma if they had been alert 
enough to recognize them. As a result, these children main-
tain a type of hypervigilance or increased arousal, directing 
their attention to threat-related stimuli (Dalgleish, Moradi, 
Consequences of Exposure 
to Violence
Three consequences of exposure to violence are of especially 
grave concern: children are harmed, children become more 
violent, and exposure to violence disrupts cognitive func-
tioning and mental health.
First, as a result of the violence in their families and neigh-
borhoods, large numbers of children and youth are victims of 
violent crimes. Homicide is the third leading cause of death for 
children ages 5 to 14, and the second leading cause of death for 
adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 24 in the United States 
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Children who live in low-income 
neighborhoods are especially vulnerable to exposure to violence. 
According to a report issued by the National Center for Educa-
tional Statistics, in 2003 roughly 740,000 violent crimes were 
committed at schools against students (DeVoe et al., 2005). In 
a survey of fi fth graders who live in a very poor urban district in 
the Northeast, 82% reported being victimized at school, includ-
ing being hit by another student, kicked or pushed by a student, 
threatened with a knife or other weapon, verbally threatened, or 
robbed. Ninety-three percent of the children had observed one of 
these forms of violence being directed to other students at their 
school (Cedeno, Elias, Kelly, & Chu, 2010). Neighborhoods that 
are centers of illegal drug trade are also often the sites of vio-
lence, including stabbings, shootings, and gang raids. In these 
communities, the loss of a legitimate economic base, with few 
people in stable or high-status occupations, leads to takeovers by 
gangs and other organized criminal activities. Children are lured 
into dangerous forms of drug-related transactions, which make 
them targets of violence on the streets as well as victims of abuse 
by drug-addicted family members and youth (National Research 
Council, 1993; Okundaye, 2004). 
Every 15-year-old boy in 
this Ethiopian village of cat-
tle breeders is expected to 
know how to defend his herd 
from raids from competing 
tribes. Children are exposed 
to frequent violence and are 
trained at a young age to use 
assault weapons to protect 
their homes and property.

public health issues (Dorfman, Woodruff, Chavez, & Wal-
lack, 1997). Rather than focusing solely on the criminal 
justice definitions and strategies for deterrence, a public 
health perspective emphasizes the need to understand the 
contexts of violence from which strategies for prevention 
can be devised and evaluated, and invites collaboration in 
identifying many layers of prevention. We must learn more 
about what predisposes young children to respond to events 
in their lives with violence. We must try to determine what 
kinds of socialization environments can help children con-
trol their aggressiveness. Furthermore, we must discover 
strategies to reduce violence in neighborhoods, schools, and 
the media (Sampson, Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997; Henrich, 
Brown, & Aber, 1999). Several directions for prevention have 
been identifi ed and require coordination:
 1. Prevent prenatal and perinatal conditions that cause neu-
rological damage and increase the biological vulnerabil-
ity for violent behaviors.
 2. Develop effective techniques for educating parents and 
teachers about socialization practices that help develop 
self-control, empathy, and perspective taking.
 3. Develop effective techniques for teaching children alter-
native, nonaggressive strategies to handle and respond to 
insults, threats, and frustration.
 4. Devise educational experiences that help children to re-
frame cognitions and beliefs that lead them to interpret 
the behaviors of others as threatening.
 5. Reduce exposure to violence at home, in the neighbor-
hood, and on television.
 6. Decrease children’s access to guns.
 7. Increase the sense of social control and cohesion in neigh-
borhoods, so that mutual trust is higher, people help one 
another more, and people are more willing to take steps 
to intervene when children are acting destructively.
A wide variety of school-based programs are being imple-
mented to help reduce violence. Some focus on providing 
information about the problem and strategies for avoiding 
violence; some use role-playing, modeling, feedback, and rein-
forcement to alter students’ behaviors; and some go beyond 
the classroom and the school environment by involving par-
ents and community leaders to create a safe community where 
people are encouraged to practice positive behavioral interac-
tions (Task Force on Community Preventive Services, 2007). 
In a review of 53 studies that evaluated universal school-based 
programs, researchers found that these programs were gener-
ally effective in decreasing violence. This research found that 
school-based programs that are delivered to all the children in 
the school rather than targeted to children who are at special 
risk for exposure to violence not only succeed in reducing vio-
lence, but are often associated with reduced truancy, improved 
school achievement, and improved social skills among stu-
dents. To learn more about strategies that are designed to 
reduce violence in schools and support a positive school cli-
mate, visit the Web site of the Center for the Prevention of 
School Violence at www.ncdjjdp.org/cpsv.
Taghavi, NeshatDoost, & Yule, 2001). These symptoms may 
last for more than 1 month and often interfere with sleep, 
schoolwork, concentration, and normal social life (American 
Psychiatric Association, 1994).
Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder can be long 
lasting and, in some cases, can emerge long after the event has 
passed. For example, one study focused on 69 children who 
had lived within 100 miles of Oklahoma City in 1995 when 
the federal building was bombed. These children, studied in 
1997, did not see the explosion, they did not live near the 
explosion, and no one they knew personally was injured or 
killed in the explosion. Yet 2 years after the event, many of 
these children showed evidence of post-traumatic stress dis-
order symptoms and related diffi culties in functioning. Their 
symptoms were attributed to experiences of the event through 
the media and indirect loss through friends or family members 
who know someone who was killed (Pfefferbaum et al., 2000).
Evidence suggests that children preserve sensory and 
motor memories of the conditions associated with their 
trauma, which are then released under contemporary con-
ditions of fear. In boys, these symptoms commonly reflect 
hyperarousal, including startle response, increases in heart 
rate, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and motor hyperactivity. In 
girls, the symptoms are more likely to be dissociation, gastroin-
testinal symptoms, and pain. Under threatening conditions, 
children who have been traumatized in the past automatically 
return to these disruptive states, making it diffi cult to access 
higher order problem-solving and reasoning skills.
According to the neurobiology of aggression, simple regula-
tory and impulsive functions are governed by the more primi-
tive, reactive areas, including the brain stem and the midbrain. 
More complex functions of language and abstract reasoning 
develop later and are located largely in the subcortical and corti-
cal areas. The ability to modify and regulate impulses involves 
the coordination of two neurological pathways, one which pro-
vides intense signals about threats or dangers emerging from the 
brain stem, and the other which provides ideas about alterna-
tive coping strategies emerging from the cortex (Perry, 1994). 
An overreactive brain stem that produces intense and frequent 
impulses may result from any one or a combination of factors, 
including fetal exposure to alcohol and drugs, environmen-
tal exposure to lead, hormonal abnormalities, head injuries, 
or exposure to child abuse. Children reared in a socialization 
environment of chaos, violence, parental aggression, and harsh 
and abusive discipline lack the opportunity to develop empa-
thy, self-control, and higher order problem-solving skills that 
might allow them to modulate their strong impulses. Exposure 
to severe trauma may produce long-lasting changes in the way a 
child’s brain regulates emotional reactions, the ability to concen-
trate, and the ability to inhibit impulses (American Psychological 
Association, 1996; Science Daily, 2007).

exposure to violence among children have become signifi cant

of acquisition of complex skills such as reading and 
examination of societal factors that provide the context 
in which skill learning occurs.
An understanding of skill development combines an 
appreciation of the child’s intellectual maturity with a 
sense of the signifi cant motives that may infl uence willing-
ness to learn. Skilled action takes place in a cultural con-
text. Skill development involves the integration of multiple 
domains that may mature at different rates. Skilled behav-
ior involves the coordination of simple and complex ele-
ments as well as overarching strategies to achieve specifi c 
goals. Reading is discussed as an example of a skill that 
begins as a focus of its own (learning to read) and then 
becomes integrated into the achievement of many other 
skills (reading to learn).
Objective 4. To examine the development of self-
evaluation skills, including feelings of pride, self-effi cacy, 
and ways that social expectations of parents, teachers, 
and peers contribute to a child’s self-evaluation.
The combination of advanced reasoning through concrete 
operational thought and engagement in a more complex peer 
environment contribute to new approaches to self-evalua-
tion. The themes of pride, self-effi cacy, and sensitivity to the 
social expectations of others are all relevant to understand-
ing how children evaluate their competence or incompe-
tence, and their willingness to strive toward new levels of 
achievement.
Objective 5. To describe a new level of complexity in 
play as children become involved in team sports and 
athletic competition, and form more enduring in-group 
and out-group attitudes.
Team sports offer a new and more complex form of play, 
which combines the need for advanced levels of skill, 
cognitive capacities to understand rules and strategies for 
success, and interpersonal skills related to interdepen-
dence, cooperation, division of labor, and competition. 
Experiences regarding the formation of in-group and out-
group attitudes are part of team sports. Team sports pro-
vide a microcosm of intergroup and intragroup relations 
that will be repeated in various contexts through adult 
life. 
Objective 6. To explain the psychosocial crisis of 
industry versus inferiority; the central process through 
which the crisis is resolved; education; the prime 
Chapter Summary
During middle childhood, cognitive and social skills develop 
that are crucial to later life stages. Remarkable synergies occur 
across the cognitive domains, bringing new levels of skill 
development, expanded access to information, and complex 
strategies for approaching and solving problems. Children 
apply their cognitive abilities not only in academic, school-
related domains, but also in an increased capacity for social 
cooperation, self-evaluation, and peer group participation. 
As a result of the combination of cognitive and social skill 
development, children are able to make signifi cant contribu-
tions to the social groups to which they belong. They are also 
likely to seek approval and acceptance from these groups.
Objective 1. To clarify the role of friendship in helping 
children to learn to take the point of view of others, be 
sensitive to the norms and pressures of the peer group, 
experience closeness in relationships, and clarify the 
negative consequences that result from social rejection 
and loneliness.
The family environment provides the early context in which 
social competence emerges. The child’s ability to establish 
and preserve friendships in middle childhood is built upon 
earlier capacities including temperament, attachment, sibling 
interactions, and the family’s orientation toward peer rela-
tionships. Three important lessons are gained through par-
ticipation in friendship: increasing appreciation for various 
points of view; awareness of peer norms and expectations; 
and a growing capacity for intimacy. As the role of friendship 
increases, problems tied to loneliness, rejection, and peer 
victimization become increasingly distressing. 
Objective 2. To describe the development of concrete 
operational thought, including conservation, classifi cation 
skills, mathematical reasoning, and the child’s ability to 
understand and monitor his or her own knowledge and 
understanding.
In early and middle childhood, new cognitive capacities 
focus on mental operations that provide a logical system 
of relationships among objects. Three achievements of this 
stage of reasoning include the scheme for conservation, clas-
sifi cation, and combinatorial skills. A hallmark of this period 
is an increase in logical, focused problem solving. Children 
are able to consider competing explanations, look at a prob-
lem from another person’s point of view as well as their own, 
and use information to plan a strategy to reach a goal. 
Objective 3. To analyze the nature of skill learning, 
including the presentation of a model for the process

to prenatal and perinatal risks that disrupt their neurological 
development. They may be embedded in a family system in 
which abusive or disorganized parenting reduces their ability 
to cope with threats or stress. Violence in the neighborhood, 
media, and school strengthens impulsive, reactive responses 
and makes it increasingly diffi cult for children to draw on 
their higher order reasoning skills to reinterpret or interrupt 
their sense of anger and threat. Access to weapons, especially 
guns, leads to new heights of destructive expression for these 
children.
The achievements of middle childhood contribute in key 
ways to coping and adaptation in adulthood. Issues of indus-
try, mastery, achievement, social expectations, social skills, 
cooperativeness, and interpersonal sensitivity are all sal ient 
themes during this stage. A person’s orientation toward 
friendship and work—two essential aspects of adult life—
begin to take shape.
adaptive ego quality of competence; and the core 
pathology of inertia.
Industry focuses primarily on building competence. The 
family, peer group, and school all play their part in the sup-
port of feelings of mastery or failure, industry or inferiority. 
In our society, school is the environment in which continu-
ous attention is given to the child’s success or failure in basic 
skill areas. The child’s emerging sense of industry is closely 
interwoven with the quality of the school environment and 
the extent to which the child encounters experiences that 
foster enthusiasm for new learning and provide objective 
feedback about levels of mastery.
Objective 7. To explore the impact of exposure to 
violence on development during middle childhood.

and societal contexts of violence. Children can be exposed

In early adolescence, physical changes of puberty are accompanied 
by alterations in the self-concept. These alterations are prompted, 
in part, by the realization that one is making a transition from 
childhood toward adulthood, and, in part, by changes in the way one 
is perceived and treated by others.

CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
AT THIS POINT in our discussion of life stages, we depart 
again from Erikson’s conceptualization. His psychosocial 
theory viewed adolescence as a single stage, unifi ed by 
the resolution of the central confl ict of identity versus 
identity confusion. Erikson’s approach attempted to ad-
dress the tasks and needs of children and youth ranging 
in age from about 11 to 21 years within one developmen-
tal stage. Based on our own research on adolescence and 
our assessment of the research literature, we have come 
to the conclusion that two distinct periods of psychoso-
cial development occur during these years—early ado-
lescence (12 to 18 years) and later adolescence (18 to 24 
years). This chapter discusses the stage of early adoles-
cence; Chapter 10 discusses later adolescence.
Early adolescence begins with the onset of puberty 
and ends with graduation from high school (or roughly 
at age 18). This stage is characterized by rapid physical 
changes, signifi cant cognitive and emotional maturation, 
newly energized sexual interests, and a heightened sen-
sitivity to peer relations. We have called the psychosocial 
crisis of this stage group identity versus alienation. Later 
adolescence begins at approximately age 18 and contin-
ues for about 6 years. This stage is characterized by new 
advances in the establishment of autonomy from the fam-
ily and the development of a personal identity. The psy-
chosocial crisis of this period is individual identity versus 
identity confusion.
The elaboration of adolescence into two stages is 
closely tied to social and historical changes. At the begin-
ning of the 20th century in the United States, few youths 
in the 12 to 18 age range were in school; at the turn of the 
21st century, almost all of them were. The time between 
entry into puberty and entry into the self-sustaining roles 
of adulthood has expanded. In contrast to life 100 years 
ago, we have a longer period of required education and 
training, fewer opportunities to enter the full-time labor 
force without a high school education, laws restricting 
the employment of children under the age of 16, and a 
workplace that requires more advanced technical, rep-
resentational, and interpersonal skills for success. At the 
same time, occupational choices are much more diverse, 
and the process of selecting a career path has become 
increasingly diffi cult. Thus, adolescence has stretched out 
as a period of life. Young people reach the biological ca-
pacity to reproduce and the physical stature of an adult 
at an earlier age, but they do not yet have the education, 
skills, training, or sense of purpose to create a sustainable 
lifestyle independent of their family of origin.
For adolescents, the challenge and even the joy of 
the period is to construct a sense of self that is at once 
connected to meaningful individuals and groups and, at 
the same time, authentic and autonomous. Adolescence 
is a thrilling time of life, a time of lasting memories about 
fi rst experiences. Young people emerge into a wider,

resistance by adults who still treat teens as if they were 
young children who are not mature enough to make 
important decisions. Adolescents who are treated this 
way may display strong feelings of anger, rebellion, or 
depression. These are the problems that the media, 
television, and movies tend to highlight. However, this 
is not an accurate portrayal of most teens. According 
to a special report by U.S. News and World Report in 
2005, “adolescents now are less likely than their par-
ents were to smoke, do hard drugs, get pregnant, com-
mit violent crimes, . . . and drive drunk” (Baxter, 2009). 
Given a supportive environment in which adults are able 
to balance autonomy-granting and warmth, most young 
people make important new strides toward maturity 
during this time. They reach new levels of mastery and a 
new appreciation of their interdependence with family, 
friends, community, and culture. ■
more varied social environment. Their social relationships 
take on a new intensity and complexity. New and more 
intricate thoughts are possible, accompanied by new in-
sights about the self as well as the physical, social, and 
political environments. Many adolescents experience 
new levels of emotional intensity, including positive feel-
ings such as romantic sentiments, sexual desires, tender-
ness, and spirituality, as well as the negative emotions of 
jealousy, hatred, and rage. 
In many cultures, adolescence is a period of transi-
tion from the relatively weak and protected status of 
childhood to a more equal position in relation to adults 
and authority fi gures. As a result of their new physical 
stature, intellectual abilities, and social skills, adoles-
cents can take on many of the tasks and roles of adult 
life. In some cases, as adolescents strive to express 
their views and preferences, they are met with a strong 
when the hypothalamus begins releasing a hormone called 
go nadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH then signals 
the pituitary gland to release two more hormones—luteinizing 
hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)—to 
start sexual development. This system—the hypothalamus, 
pituitary gland, and the gonads, often referred to as the HPG 
axis—is responsible for the production and regulation of the 
sex hormones that result in the growth and maturation of the 
reproductive organs (NICHD, 2007). The hypothalamus and 
pituitary glands are also linked to the adrenal gland (the HPA 
axis), which controls reactions to stress, regulates digestion, 
and infl uences the immune system, mood, energy use, and 
the sleep-wake cycle (see the Applying Theory and Research 
to Life box for changes in the sleep needs of adolescents). 
The HPA axis establishes a feedback system that integrates 
the brain, glands, and hormones to support adaptation. Dur-
ing adolescence, both the HPG axis and the HPA axis are 
emerging into new patterns of regulation and growth.
There is a great deal of individual variation in the tim-
ing, rate of change, and coordination of these changes. Some 
changes, such as the maturation of the adrenal glands, occur 
very early, at around ages 6 to 9, and some changes, such as 
continuing growth in height, can continue well into the late 
teens and twenties. Thus, from a psychosocial perspective, one 
must think of pubertal development as a gradual transforma-
tion in which internal states and external appearance are coor-
dinated with social expectations and a changing self-image 
(Dorn, Dahl, Woodward, & Biro, 2006).
Adaptation at puberty requires an integration of bio-
logical, psychological, and social changes. A young person 
may be responding to noticeable physical changes, such as 
a height spurt or the growth of pubic hair. Some changes 
in behavior may be due to less readily observable biological 
Developmental Tasks
Physical Maturation 
Objective 1. To describe the patterns of physical 
maturation during puberty for female and male 
adolescents, including an analysis of the impact of 
early and late maturing on self-concept and social 
relationships.
Coming on the heels of a period of gradual but steady physi-
cal development in middle childhood, early adolescence 
is marked by rapid physical changes, including a height 
spurt, maturation of the reproductive system, appearance of 
secondary sex characteristics, increased muscle strength, 
and the redistribution of body weight. At the same time, the 
brain continues to develop, with changes that increase emo-
tionality, modify memory, and gradually improve connec-
tions among areas of the brain that regulate emotion, impulse 
control, and judgment (Brownlee, 1999; Spear, 2000). Vari-
ability in the rate and sequence of development is well docu-
mented (Brooks-Gunn & Reiter, 1990; Tanner, 1990). The 
time from the appearance of breast buds to full maturity may 
range from 1 to 6 years for girls; the male genitalia may take 
from 2 to 5 years to reach adult size. These individual differ-
ences in maturation suggest that during early adolescence, 
the chronological peer group is biologically far more diverse 
than it was during early and middle childhood.
Puberty encompasses a group of interrelated neurologi-
cal and endocrinological changes that infl uence brain devel-
opment, changes in sexual maturation, cycles and levels of 
hormone production, and physical growth. Puberty starts 

338 | 
CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
responses to puberty have to do with the timing of these 
changes—whether pubertal changes are perceived to be 
early, on time, or late in relation to their peers. Thus, puberty 
is not one event, but a biopsychosocial transition that takes on 
meaning in the context of a child’s culture and community.
The degree to which one’s body matches the desired or 
socially valued body build of the culture infl uences social 
acceptance by peers and adults. This match between body 
shape and cultural values also infl uences the future course of 
psychosocial development. The European American culture 
gives self-esteem advantages to muscular, well-developed 
boys and petite, shapely girls. In contrast, it detracts from the 
changes in hormone production associated with new levels 
of arousal and emotionality. Psychological changes may be 
due to age as well as pubertal status and the changes that 
are associated with age. For example, some children make 
a school transition into seventh grade at age 12, leading to 
new status, a new sense of responsibilities, and new expec-
tations for school performance. Some responses to puberty 
are cued by the way other people, including parents, teach-
ers, siblings, and peers, respond to a child whose physical 
appearance has changed. In many cultures, rites of passage 
occur with entry into puberty, giving the young person new 
roles and new status within the community. Finally, some 
Sleep Loss in 
Adolescence
ALONG WITH MANY changes in physical 
stature and appearance, puberty brings 
changes in sleep patterns. Research 
carried out in sleep labs suggests that 
when allowed to sleep as long as they 
wished, adolescents would sleep about 
9 hours. However, as they get older, 
the quality of the sleep changes, with 
less time spent in deep sleep, leaving 
adolescents more tired during the day 
even when they get the same amount 
of sleep as younger children (Dahl & 
Caskadon, 1995). In actuality, as 
adolescents make the transition to high 
school, they get less sleep than younger 
children, leaving them more tired and 
more likely to fall asleep during the day. 
The pattern of later bedtime and fewer 
hours of nighttime sleep in adolescence 
has been observed in studies conducted 
in Germany, Greece, New Zealand, and 
Taiwan as well as the United States.
The study of sleep and its relation 
to psychosocial outcomes is a growing 
fi eld (Johnson, 2004). Questions of 
interest include how the biological 
changes of puberty contribute to 
changes in sleep quality, sociocultural 
factors that contribute to sleep 
deprivation, and the impact of sleep 
habits on moodiness, self-esteem, 
depression, substance abuse, and 
school achievement. A combination of 
factors contributes to sleep deprivation 
in adolescence. Middle school tends 
to start earlier than elementary school, 
and high school starts earlier still. Many 
adolescents are in activities that involve 
before-school preparation. Adolescents 
are likely to stay up late on school 
nights doing homework, talking with 
friends, using the computer, or watching 
television. Some adolescents have jobs 
at restaurants and stores where they stay 
until closing time.
The family environment has also 
been studied as a factor that infl uences 
sleep time. For younger children ages 
5 through 11, parental warmth is 
associated with more hours of sleep 
during the weekdays. However, for older 
children in the age range 12 to 19, those 
adolescents whose families had stricter 
rules actually got more sleep (Adam, 
Snell, & Pendry, 2007).
In addition to these contextual 
factors, there is some evidence that the 
natural biorhythm for adolescents shifts 
toward a preference for a later sleep 
phase. In comparison with younger 
children, who sleep about the same 
amount during the weekdays as on 
weekends, adolescents tend to sleep 
much later on the weekends (Gaina, 
Sekine, Chen, Hamanishi, & Kagamimori, 
2004). When they have a choice, as on 
the weekends, older adolescents stay 
up later at night, when they feel alert 
and energized, and sleep later in the 
morning. This shift is tied to pubertal 
status; those teens who are in a more 
advanced pubertal status show a greater 
tendency toward this delay and a greater 
difference between weekend and 
weekday sleep (Laberge, Petit, Simard, 
Vitaro, Tremblay, & Montplaisir, 2001).
In a longitudinal study of more than 
2,000 children, the amount of sleep that 
children said they got on a typical school 
night was tracked for 3 years, in sixth, 
seventh, and eighth grades (Fredriksen, 
Rhodes, Reddy, & Way, 2004). The 
amount of sleep for both boys and girls 
declined from sixth to eighth grade. In the 
sixth grade, children who got fewer hours 
of sleep also had lower self-esteem, lower 
grades, and more depressive symptoms. 
Those students who experienced the 
greatest decline in hours of sleep over 
the 3 years also showed greater increases 
in depressive symptoms and lower self-
esteem by eighth grade. Given the strong 
associations of depression and self-esteem 
with risky health behaviors, the role of 
sleep deprivation clearly deserves greater 
attention in family and school contexts.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. How do biological maturation and 
social environment interact to alter the 
amount of sleep adolescents get?
 2. What are some implications of not 
getting enough sleep for adoles-
cents’ academic and social life?
 3. What could schools do to alter their 
schedules so that adolescents get 
the sleep they need?
 4. How might learning be infl uenced 
by sleep needs? What might be hap-
pening while a person sleeps that 
contributes to learning?
 5. Why do you think that children who 
get fewer hours of sleep have lower 
self-esteem and more signs of 
depression?

Carly’s ability as a gymnast was enhanced by a signifi cant 
increase in musculature that occurred at puberty. We do 
not know what might have happened to Carly’s gymnastic 
career if her puberty had been accompanied with a greater 
height spurt or more breast development. There is concern 
that competitive events in which athletes are punished for 
weight gain or encouraged to manipulate their weight in 
order to compete may contribute to serious health risks,

Physical Changes in Girls
The window for the transition into puberty appears to be 
expanding for girls in the United States. When European 
American, African American, and Latina girls of the same 
socioeconomic background were compared, the average 
age at menarche was about age 12 for European American 
and African American girls. Latina girls reached menarche 
slightly earlier than the African American girls (Obeidallah, 
Brennan, Brooks-Gunn, Kindlon, & Earls, 2000). How-
ever, menarche is not one of the fi rst events in the transi-
tions of puberty. A study of more than 17,000 girls ages 3 
to 12 found that roughly 15% of European American girls 
and 50% of African American girls were showing evidence 
of secondary sex characteristics, including breast buds and 
pubic hair, by age 8 (Herman-Giddens et al., 1997; Lemon-
ick, 2000). There are speculations about the cause of this 
early onset of puberty. Some consider obesity in children as 
a stimulus for early puberty; others point to the breakdown 
of insecticides in the soil, or hormones given to cattle that 
eventually make their way into a child’s diet. Family disrup-
tion and father absence, as well as the presence of fathers 
who have signifi cant symptoms of psychopathology, are all 
associated with earlier age of menarche (Tither and Ellis, 
2008). Finally, some argue that exposure to sexual stimula-
tion in television, movies, advertisements, and overt behav-
ior plays a role in promoting the production of hormones 
self-esteem of thin, gangly boys, underdeveloped girls, and 
overweight boys and girls. Changes in body size and shape 
at puberty can bring advantages or disadvantages, depending 
on the context (see the case study on Carly Patterson).
CASE STUDY
CARLY PATTERSON, OLYMPIC GYMNAST
At age 16, Carly Patterson was an all-around gold medal 
Olympic champion in gymnastics.
Carly was born February 4, 1988, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 
the fi rst of two children to Ricky and Natalie Patterson. She 
was a straight-A high school student and enjoyed things 
almost all teenagers enjoyed: shopping, movies, the beach. 
But Carly was far from normal. She worked with coaches 
Yevgeny Marchenko and Natasha Boyarskaya at the World 
Olympic Gymnastics Academy in Plano, Texas. Marchenko 
called her “Harley Davidson” because of her power. She 
trained twice a day, 6 days a week, for about 32 hours a week. 
She balanced her training and competition schedule with a 
regular high school workload. On a typical day, she was at the 
gym from 8 to 11: 30 a.m., then at school in the middle of the 
day, and then at the gym again from 4 to 7:30 p.m.
Carly began gymnastics in 1994, after attending a cous-
in’s birthday party at Elite Gymnastics in Baton Rouge. Less 
than a decade later, she made her debut at the senior inter-
national elite level, winning back-to-back American Cup titles 
in 2003 and 2004, as well as the title of 2004 U.S. Co-National 
Champion. Carly was also a part of the 2003 World Champi-
onship team where she won a silver medal in the all-around 
and helped lead the United States to their fi rst ever World 
Championship team gold medal. It was also at this competi-
tion that Carly’s signature beam dismount (an Arabian double 
front) was offi cially named the Patterson. A year later, Carly 
achieved her ultimate goal in gymnastics by earning a trip to 
the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.
Carly came home from Athens with three Olympic med-
als. The U.S. women won silver in the team competition—the 
fi rst medal for the U.S. women in 8 years, as well as the sec-
ond highest fi nish for the Americans in a fully attended Olym-
pic Games. Carly also earned a silver medal on her specialty, 
the beam. However, it was on August 19 that all of Carly’s 
hard work, dedication, and love for gymnastics paid off. She 
won the most prestigious title in gymnastics, the title of 2004 
Olympic All-Around Champion. Carly was the U.S.A.’s fi rst 
Olympic all-around champion in 20 years, as well as the fi rst 
American woman to win an Olympic all-around title in a fully 
attended Olympic Games.
We cannot fully predict how puberty will transform a 
child’s body into that of an adult. Often, adults focus on the 
challenges and diffi culties that youth face, such as eating 
disorders or high-risk behaviors. For many young people, 
however, puberty opens up expanded opportunities for ath-
letic achievement. With her small stature and slight build,

CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
the major factor in determining her social and academic 
experiences.
At fi rst I thought if I got good grades and tried to fi t in it 
wouldn’t matter how I looked. But I still got teased; it didn’t 
make a difference. All the good things about me—like that I 
was smart—it was just, “You don’t fi t. You don’t look good. 
You’re fat.” I felt like I was doing all the good things for no 
reason. So I just said, “Fine, if it’s going to be that way, then I 
don’t care.” And I don’t try at all anymore. I don’t care about 
school. (Orenstein, 2000, pp. 100–101)
In a review of research on body dissatisfaction and eat-
ing pathologies, Stice and Shaw (2002) found support for 
a relationship between body image disturbances and eating 
disorders (see Figure 9.1). Three factors appear to contrib-
ute to body dissatisfaction among adolescent girls: social 
pressures to be thin, an internalized thin ideal body type, 
and higher than average body mass. Those girls who have 
higher body dissatisfaction are likely to start dieting and 
also to experience negative emotional states, especially 
depression. In a longitudinal study of adolescents in grades 
7 through 12, symptoms of depression predicted obesity 1 
year later. The link between depression and obesity may be 
due to a decrease in physical activity, or for some, an increase 
in hunger eating and weight gain (Goodman & Whitaker, 
2002; Needham Epel, Adler, & Kiefe, 2010). The combina-
tion of these factors can lead to future eating pathologies. In 
an attempt to attain a thin ideal and to reduce negative feel-
ings about themselves, many early adolescent girls begin a 
that stimulate puberty. None of these speculations has been 
accepted as the determining factor (Lemonick, 2000).
For girls, the earliest evidence of puberty is usually breast 
bud development and the beginning of the height spurt, which 
occur on average between ages 10 and 11—almost 2 years 
sooner than the parallel experiences for boys (see Table 9.1). 
Initially, the increase in height may be embarrassing when a girl 
fi nds herself towering above her male classmates. To compen-
sate, girls often slouch or wear baggy clothes.
Generally, girls are more dissatisfi ed than boys with their 
physical appearance and their overall body image. For girls, 
self-consciousness and dissatisfaction with their appear-
ance reach their peak between the ages of 13 and 15. The 
cultural, family, or community emphasis on a thin ideal, 
combined with the view that thinness can be achieved 
through effort, lead many girls to experience dissatisfac-
tion with their body. Body dissatisfaction is associated 
with lower levels of self-esteem and increased likelihood 
of depression among early adolescent girls (Jones, 2004; 
Moore & Rosenthal, 2006).
Concerns About Obesity. The greatest concern that 
adolescent girls express about their bodies is the perception 
that they are too fat. This concern is not so much that being 
overweight is unhealthy, but that it results in peer rejection 
from both boys and girls.
Lisa is a seventh grader who attends a White, upper-
middle-class, middle school. She is clearly overweight. As 
a newcomer to her school, she found that her weight was

Reactions to Breast Development and Menarche. For 
girls, two of the most noticeable events of puberty are the devel-
opment of breast buds and the onset of the menstrual cycle 
(menarche). Breast development is one of the early aspects of 
pubertal growth, and often serves as a signal for the need to 
begin dialogue about puberty. To the average girl, the develop-
ment of breast buds is a welcome sign of her growing maturity 
and femininity (Brooks-Gunn & Warren, 1988). Some girls 
begin to wear brassieres early in puberty in anticipation of the 
onset of breast development. However, the trend toward ear-
lier breast development has parents and mental health experts 
concerned about the compression of childhood. Eight-year-old 
girls with breasts are still emotionally and cognitively like their 
undeveloped 8-year-old peers. Their physical development 
may result in new expectations for more mature behavior and 
new sexualized attention from older boys (Lemonick, 2000).
Menarche is a comparatively late event in a girl’s puber-
tal development. Breast development and the growth of 
pubic hair are earlier evidence of pubertal growth and may 
provide the signal that a conversation about menarche is 
in order. Although most girls are prepared by their moth-
ers for menstruation, the topic is often handled as a matter 
of hygiene rather than as a sexual transition. Many girls do 
not understand the relation of menstruation to reproduction. 
They simply accept their monthly periods as another sign 
of their femininity. The process of learning about menarche 
may be somewhat more anxiety producing for girls who are 
not living with their mothers or with a female caregiver. In a 
process of strict and often faddish dieting. This strategy is ill-
timed, because their bodies require well-balanced diets and 
increased caloric intake during the period of rapid growth 
(Stice & Shaw, 2004).
Concern about being overweight is culturally linked. For 
example, studies have found that girls who have strong religious 
backgrounds have a heavier real and ideal weight than less reli-
gious girls. Black girls view a slightly heavier body image as 
ideal in comparison to White girls. With Black youth, one does 
not see the relationship of obesity and low self-esteem that is 
often observed in studies of White adolescents (Martin et al., 
1988; Abell & Richards, 1996; Flynn & Fitzgibbon, 1996).
Concern about being overweight is also linked to the day-to-
day experiences girls have with peers at school. Girls who are 
overweight are more likely to try to lose weight if other girls at 
their school of similar body type are also trying to lose weight. 
Girls who are underweight are also more likely to try to lose 
weight if other underweight girls at their school are trying to 
lose weight. The implication is that even though girls are aware 
of a broad, cultural ideal about thinness, their own behavior 
regarding weight control or weight loss is infl uenced to a great 
extent by what other girls in their immediate social world are 
doing (Mueller, Pearson, Muller, Frank, & Turner, 2010).
Obesity is related to activity level. For girls, one of the com-
pounding factors in obesity is that they tend to reduce their 
activity level with age. One longitudinal study monitored 
common physical activities for children from grades 3 through 
10. During grades 6 through 8, those girls who were more 
advanced in their pubertal status were less active than the girls 
who were less physically mature. Pubertal status was not a fac-
tor that predicted activity level for boys in those same grades 
(Bradley, McMurray, Harrell, & Deng, 2000). In an ethnically 
diverse sample of more than 550 girls in grades 5 to 12, only 
36% met the national goal for strenuous activity (15 minutes 
of strenuous activity at least three times per week; Wolf et al., 
1993). The amount of overall activity and strenuous activ-
ity decreased with age, and obesity was negatively correlated 
with activity. The study also revealed differences in exercise 
patterns across ethnic groups. Hispanic American and Asian 
American girls had signifi cantly lower scores on activity level 
than African American and European American girls. Two cul-
tural hypotheses were formulated to explain this pattern, but 
neither one was tested: First, strenuous physical activity may 
be viewed as especially unfeminine by Asian Americans and 
Hispanic Americans. Second, it is possible that the slender 
body type is not seen as desirable by these ethnic groups; thus, 
there is less motivation to do strenuous exercise.

CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
growth was observed to begin sometime between ages 9 and 
10—more than 2 years before the estimate given by prior stud-
ies (Associated Press, 2001). The median age for sperm pro-
duction is about 14. Thus, like menarche, spermarche occurs 
rather late in the pubertal process (Dorn et al., 2006). In con-
trast to girls, boys are generally not well prepared by their par-
ents with information on the maturation of their reproductive 
organs (Bolton & MacEachron, 1988). Specifi cally, they are 
not taught about spontaneous ejaculation and may be sur-
prised, scared, or embarrassed by it. The sexual connotation 
of the event may make it diffi cult for boys to seek an explana-
tion from their parents. They are left to gain information from 
friends and reading material or to worry in private about its 
meaning. For many boys, spontaneous ejaculation provides 
an important clue to the way in which physical adult sexu-
ality and reproduction are accomplished. The pleasure of the 
ejaculation and the positive value of the new information that 
it provides are counterbalanced by a mild anxiety (Gaddis & 
Brooks-Gunn, 1985; Marsiglio, 1988; Adegoke, 1993). This 
is only one of the developments that arouse ambivalence in 
many boys during early adolescence.
A third area of physical development that has psychologi-
cal and social meaning for boys is the development of sec-
ondary sex characteristics, particularly the growth of facial 
qualitative study of girls who were living without their moth-
ers, the girls were often embarrassed to ask questions of their 
fathers and experienced more distress around this issue if 
they did not have access to a woman who could answer their 
questions (Kalman, 2003). This has special implications for 
the health of girls who may be separated from their mothers 
due to maternal death, war, or imprisonment.
Most girls seem to react to menstruation with a mix of 
positive and negative feelings. The positive feelings refl ect 
their pride in maturing and the confi rmation of their wom-
anliness. The negative feelings reflect the inconvenience, 
some unpleasant symptoms, and the possible embarrassment 
of menstruation (Brooks-Gunn & Reiter, 1990). Girls rarely 
tell their male peers or their fathers about the onset of men-
arche, but they do discuss it with their female friends and 
their mothers. Negative feelings are especially likely if a girl 
matures early, at age 9 or 10. In a retrospective study involv-
ing more than 1,500 Chinese American junior high school 
girls, students were asked about their knowledge and atti-
tudes about menarche and their emotional responses to their 
fi rst menstruation. Although 85% reported feeling annoyed 
and embarrassed by their fi rst menstruation, about 66% also 
reported positive feelings, especially feeling more grown up. 
The more adequate their preparation for menarche and the 
more they saw menarche as a natural, healthy event, the 
more positive were their emotional responses (Tang, Yeung, 
& Lee, 2003).
Physical Changes in Boys
Boys generally welcome the changes involving increased 
height and muscle mass that bring them one step closer to 
adult maturity. Nonetheless, some ambivalence is likely as 
boys experience the transitions of puberty. On the one hand, 
a mature physique usually brings well-developed physical 
skills that are highly valued by peers and adults alike. On 
the other hand, the period of rapid growth may leave a boy 
feeling awkward and uncoordinated for a time. This awk-
wardness results because growth does not take place at the 
same rate in all parts of the body. One particular discrepancy 
is the time lag between the height spurt and the increase in 
muscle strength. For boys, the increase in the rate of growth 
in height starts at about 12.5 years and reaches a peak 
around age 14. The peak increase in muscle strength, how-
ever, usually occurs about 12 to 14 months after the peak 
height spurt (Brierley, 1993). This time lag results in a tem-
porary period during which a boy simply cannot accomplish 
what he might expect given his height. Psychologically, this 
awkward period poses challenges to a boy’s self-esteem. For 
boys, body image dissatisfaction is typically associated with 
frustration about not looking muscular or strong—a concern 
that is magnifi ed by the lag between the height spurt and the 
increase in muscle mass (Cohane & Pope, 2000).
The onset of the growth of the testes and the penis also 
poses important challenges for early adolescent boys. Testicu-
lar growth is one of the fi rst signs of puberty in boys. A some-
what controversial study of U.S. boys reported that genital

Age at menarche varies among countries and even among 
socioeconomic groups within a country. Evidence from two 
rural counties in China illustrates the impact of improved liv-
ing standards on age at menarche. In a survey of over 12,000 
females, age at menarche decreased from an average of 16.5 
to 13.7 over an approximate 40-year interval. Improvements 
were associated with a variety of environmental conditions, 
including reduced pesticide exposure before age at men-
arche, the source of drinking water, the amount of physi-
cal labor the girls were required to perform, and improved 
nutrition (Graham, Larsen, & Xu, 1999).
What is the relevance of the secular trend for under-
standing the development of contemporary adolescents in 
post-industrialized societies? Reproductive capacity and 
physical adult stature occur at a younger age than at the turn 
of the 20th century, but full engagement in the adult soci-
ety requires more training, education, and complex prepara-
tion than in the past. Thus, adolescence is prolonged, with 
more time to experience the risks of unwanted pregnancy, 
the sense of being in a marginal social status, and disruptions 
in the transition from childhood to adulthood.
The concept of the secular trend alerts us to the impor-
tance of the psychosocial context of physical development. 
Not only are peers experiencing diverse patterns of growth, 
but parents and grandparents may also be reacting to a dis-
crepancy between their children’s development and their 
own timetable for growth. Moreover, because the period 
of reproductive capacity starts earlier than it did 50 years 
ago, young people must cope with special challenges in the 
expression and regulation of their sexual impulses. One con-
sequence of the earlier onset of puberty is that adolescents 
may fi nd themselves in potentially high-risk situations at a 
relatively young age. Given the risks inherent in a techno-
logical society, it is no wonder that adolescent exposure to 
risk behaviors is a major contemporary health concern.
Individual Differences in Maturation Rate
The age at onset of puberty and the rate of change in physi-
cal maturation vary. Early and late maturing have psycho-
logical and social consequences for both boys and girls. 
Recent research about the effects of pubertal timing has chal-
lenged the view that was established by researchers in the 
1950s and 1960s. In those studies, boys who matured early 
experienced positive consequences, including greater opportu-
nities for leadership and social status, and as a result, they had 
higher self-esteem (Mussen & Jones, 1957; Clausen, 1975). A 
similar advantage for early maturation for fi fth- and sixth-grade 
boys was reported in the early 1990s. The boys who were more 
physically mature described more positive daily emotions, bet-
ter attention, and feelings of being strong (Richards & Larson, 
1993). The explanation for these advantages was that early 
maturing boys are likely to be given increased responsibility 
by their parents and teachers. They are generally more satis-
fi ed with their bodies, feel more positive about being boys, and 
are likely to be more involved in school activities by the tenth 
grade than are late-maturing boys (Blyth, Bulcroft, & Simmons, 
and body hair. In many societies, the equipment and ritual 
behaviors associated with shaving are closely linked to the 
masculine gender role. Most boys are eager to express their 
identifi cation with this role, and they use the slightest evi-
dence of facial hair as an excuse to take razor in hand. The rit-
ual of shaving not only provides some affi rmation of the boy’s 
masculinity, but it also allows him an acceptable outlet for his 
narcissism. As he shaves, it is legitimate for him to gaze at and 
admire his changing image. In some societies, the ability to 
grow a mustache or a beard is a sign of one’s masculinity. In 
these cultures, boys cultivate and admire their mustaches or 
beards as evidence of their enhanced male status.
Cultural Contexts of Puberty
The way adolescents react to the physical changes of puberty 
depends in part on the cultural context. For example, stud-
ies of Mexican youth fi nd that girls become somewhat more 
depressed as they go through puberty, whereas boys experi-
ence an improved sense of body image and well-being (Benjet 
& Hernandez-Guzman, 2002). These gender differences may 
refl ect the greater status and new responsibilities given to male 
children in Mexican culture, and the new restrictions that apply 
to female children as they enter puberty in order to protect 
their chastity. In another cultural comparison, several studies 
comparing African American and European American ado-
lescent girls were summarized. In general, African American 
adolescent girls are more satisfi ed with their body image and 
less inclined toward eating disorders than European American 
girls. Furthermore, early pubertal onset and weight increases 
were not particularly strong predictors of negative body image 
and depression among African American girls, as they are for 
European American girls (Franko & Streigel-Moore, 2002).
The Secular Growth Trend
Along with the genetic influence that guides the timing of 
pubertal growth and sexual maturation, the environment plays 
an important role in the eventual attainment of one’s growth 
potential. A secular growth trend is a change over time in 
the average age at which physical maturation takes place 
(Godina, 2009). All over the world, changes in hygiene, nutri-
tion, and health care have contributed to an earlier entry into 
puberty and earlier growth spurt over the past century (Richter, 
2006). In the United States, children ages 10 to 14 increased in 
height by an average of 2 to 3 centimeters every decade from 
1900 to 1960. Adult height is not necessarily greater due to 
this increase; it is simply attained at an earlier age.
Other evidence of a secular trend is the decrease in 
age at menarche. Data reported by Tanner (1990) showed 
a decrease in the average age at menarche from the 1950s 
(13.5 to 14 years) to the 1970s (12.5 to 13 years). At pres-
ent, the mean age at menarche for girls in the United States is 
12.3, but the range is from 9 to 17. There is no evidence for 
a continuing decline in age at pubertal development for non-
Hispanic girls, in the period from 1966 to 1994; but there is 
some evidence for earlier pubertal development for Mexican 
American boys and girls over these years (Sun et al., 2005).

CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
mature physical appearance, they may be accelerated into 
situations where they are faced with expectations for a level 
of self-control, decision making, and leadership for which 
they are not prepared. Too much, too soon produces over-
load (Ge, Conger, & Elder, 2001; Ge & Natsuaki, 2009).
These different views of the impact of early maturing may 
all be correct. For example, it may be true that early matur-
ing boys do experience greater opportunities for leadership 
and social status. The advantages of an earlier height spurt 
and related increases in muscle mass and endurance can 
make a signifi cant difference as boys engage in athletic com-
petitions with their age-mates (Gladwell, 2008). At the same 
time, because they look older, they may begin to engage in 
some of the high-risk behaviors of slightly older boys.
Several studies suggest that early pubertal onset is also 
a source of stress for girls (Kornfi eld, 1990; Caspi & Mof-
fi tt, 1991). Because pubertal changes occur about 2 years 
earlier for girls than for boys, the early maturing girl stands 
out among all her male and female age-mates. Early onset of 
menstruation is especially stressful, resulting in heightened 
self-consciousness and anxiety (Hill, 1988). Early maturing 
girls are less likely to have been prepared for the onset of 
menstruation, and they are less likely to have close friends 
with whom they can discuss it. Early pubertal maturation 
may result in feelings of social isolation for girls.
Early maturing girls experience higher levels of conflict 
with their parents and are more likely to report depression and 
anxiety (Wierson, Long, & Forehand, 1993). Early maturing 
girls who are dissatisfi ed with their physical appearance are 
especially vulnerable to low self-esteem (Williams & Currie, 
2000). There is some evidence that early maturing girls earn 
lower grades and lower scores on academic achievement tests. 
They are also more likely to be identifi ed as having behavior 
problems in school (Blyth et al., 1981). Early maturing girls 
start dating earlier and perceive themselves as more popular 
with boys than do late-maturing girls. Some studies report that 
early maturing girls are more likely to engage in high-risk, pro-
miscuous sexual behavior. In general, however, the timing of 
the transition to puberty in and of itself is not a strong predic-
tor of a girl’s emotional well-being. Rather, this timing interacts 
with other events, including school transition, family con-
fl ict, or peer acceptance, to infl uence how girls construct the 
meaning of this physical transition (Booth, Johnson, Granger, 
Crouter, & McHale, 2003).
Romantic and Sexual Relationships
Objective 2. To characterize the development of 
romantic and sexual relationships, including a focus 
on the transition to coitus, the formation of a sexual 
orientation, and factors associated with pregnancy and 
parenthood in adolescence.
During adolescence, romantic relationships, sexual fantasies, 
and sexual behaviors increase, partly as a result of biological 
1981). In contrast, boys who mature later than their age-mates 
may experience psychological stress and develop a negative self-
image. Late-maturing boys are treated as if they were younger 
than they really are. They may become isolated from their peers 
or behave in a silly, childish manner to gain attention.
Recent research has painted a somewhat different picture of 
the consequences of early maturing for boys, especially those 
who mature in grade 7 or before. These studies show that early 
maturing boys have more hostile feelings, greater levels of anx-
iety and depression, more problems with drug and alcohol 
use, and more deviant activities and problems in school than 
boys who mature at a more average time (Alasker, 1995; Ge, 
Conger, & Elder, 2001; Wichstrom, 2001). The association 
of early maturation and heightened rates of violent and non-
violent delinquent behavior has been observed for African 
American, Mexican American, and European American youth 
(Cota-Robles, Neiss, & Rowe, 2002). In a longitudinal study 
of over 3,000 South African children born in the early 1990s, 
early maturing boys and girls were found to be more involved 
in high-risk behaviors such as smoking, experimenting with 
drugs, and sexual behavior than their less physically mature 
age-mates (Richter, 2006).
How can we account for these differences? Is early matur-
ing a benefi t or a risk for boys? Explanations for this new 
view of the impact of early maturation for boys vary. One 
explanation is that we are looking at a cohort effect. Maturing 
early in the 1950s may have been a more positive experience, 
whereas maturing early in the 1990s may expose adolescent 
boys to more stressors. Another explanation is that in today’s 
society, physical maturation at age 12 and earlier converges 
with other stressful life events, especially school transitions, 
disruption of the peer network, more challenging expecta-
tions for school performance, and the related risk of failure. 
More stressful life events coupled with the pubertal transi-
tion increase uncertainty and may leave boys feeling out of 
control. A third explanation is that boys who mature early 
have not had time to fully master the tasks of the middle 
childhood period. With an early height spurt and a more 
By grade 8, the physical diversity of the peer group is quite notice-
able. Differences in height, weight, and body shape have implica-
tions for popularity, leadership, athletic success, and self-confi dence.

Involvement in romantic relationships increases over 
the middle school and high school years, and the quality of 
these relationships becomes increasingly intimate. Furman 
and Wehner (1997) suggested that four types of needs are 
met in these romantic relationships: affi liation, attachment, 
caregiving, and sexual gratifi cation. As suggested by Sullivan’s 
(1953) interpersonal theory, the ability to engage in close 
and confiding friendships during middle childhood lays 
the groundwork for the capacity to have romantic relation-
ships. Those children who have close friendships in middle 
childhood are more likely to have romantic relationships in 
adolescence (Neeman, Hubbard, & Master, 1995). Participa-
tion in mixed-sex friendship groups is also likely to provide 
the context for the formation of romantic pairing, which 
becomes more exclusive and less group oriented over time 
(Dunphy, 1963; Connolly, Furman, & Konarski, 2000).
First Intercourse. The sexual transition may take place 
in very different contexts for adolescents. It may be a 
planned event or an unplanned impulse, often combined 
with alcohol use or a drug high. The sexual encounter 
may be viewed as a marker of independence or as an act 
of rebellion against and defi ance of the family. It may take 
place in the context of an ongoing close relationship or as 
part of a casual encounter. Usually, the earlier the transi-
tion into sexual activity and intercourse, the more likely 
the act is to be part of a profile of high-risk behaviors, 
including alcohol use, drug use, and delinquent activ-
ity. For girls 14 years old and younger, 27% said that they 
did not want their fi rst sexual experience (Terry-Humen, 
Manlove, & Cottingham, 2006). For many of these young 
teens, their fi rst sexual experience was a result of being sex-
ually assaulted (Haffner, 1998). The later the transition, the 
changes and partly as a result of social, cultural, and histori-
cal contexts. One of the earliest signs of puberty is the grad-
ual release of hormones from the adrenal gland. DHEA and 
other adrenal hormones are associated with the growth of 
pubic hair, body odor, acne, and prepubertal growth (Shirt-
cliff, Dahl, & Pollack, 2009). The amount of this hormone 
that is absorbed in the blood reaches a peak between the ages 
of 10 and 12—a time when both boys and girls begin to be 
aware of sexual feelings toward others (Herdt & McClintock, 
2000; LaFreniere, 2000). The way these sexual feelings are 
expressed depends largely on cultural factors.
The Transition into Sexualized Relationships
Most young people are involved in a variety of romantic rela-
tionships during adolescence, including dating, feelings of 
tenderness and love, and deepening commitments (Moore & 
Rosenthal, 2006). Components of both gender identity and 
sexual orientation are formulated during this period of life. 
Some adolescents are reticent about sexual behavior. Oth-
ers are sexually permissive and regularly active in sex play, 
from petting to intercourse. The manner in which early ado-
lescents think about sexual relationships varies. Some are 
preoccupied by thoughts of very romantic, idealized rela-
tionships. They can become infatuated with rock stars, ath-
letes, movie stars, or other sex symbols. Some have crushes 
on boys or girls in their school or neighborhood, and still 
others have obsessions with sexual material but do not have 
any tender or caring relationships with peers. Early adoles-
cents’ sexual awakenings represent a system that is just being 
started up and tested out. As a result of these sexual expe-
riences, adolescents begin to think of themselves as sexual, 
develop scripts and schemes for how to act sexually with 
others, and begin to formulate ideas about the kinds of peo-
ple they fi nd sexually attractive.
Dating. Dating relationships provide the initial context for 
most sexual activity. Pubertal changes may increase a young 
person’s interest in sexual ideation, but the timing and rituals 
or script of dating depends heavily on the norms of the peer 
group and the community (Garguilo, Attie, Brooks-Gunn, & 
Warren, 1987). Young people learn the art of fl irtation, practice 
how to approach and how to coyly refuse, and learn the rules 
of engagement between the sexes, which vary from culture to 
culture and from cohort to cohort. The following description 
of dating in the United States in the 1920s refl ects the values 
regarding gender, sexuality, and economics of the time.
Boys or young men asked for the company of a girl or young 
woman to some public amusement—dance, movie, party, or 
other social event. They went without adult supervision or 
interference. The male member of the couple paid and fre-
quently in the 1920s provided transportation. After the main 
event, the couple often went out to eat and frequently would 
try to fi nd some private place for necking. Whereas physical 
intimacy became an expected element of dating, the limits of 
sexual experience depended on the girl and to a large extent 
on her [social] class. (Spurlock & Magistro, 1998, p. 26)

responsible to conceal one’s sexual experience in others. 
Finally, most studies focus on individual reports and do not 
gather data to confi rm reported sexual experiences by par-
ticipating partners.
Factors Affecting the Initiation of Sexual Intercourse. 
Udry and Billy (1987) devised a model that is very useful for 
conceptualizing the transition to coitus in early adolescence 
(see Figure 9.3). In that model, three basic dimensions account 
for the adolescent’s initiation of sexual activity: motivation, 
social controls, and attractiveness.
The first dimension, sexual motivation, includes 
the biologically organized drives associated with sexual 
arousal and sexual pleasure, and a range of social motives 
such as achieving new levels of intimacy in a relationship, 
pleasing one’s partner, impressing one’s peers, gaining 
sexual experience, or preventing confl ict or dissolution 
by providing sexual satisfaction (Impett & Tolman, 2006). 
Some sexual motives can be considered approach motives 
in that sexual activity is viewed as a way of achieving a 
positive outcome, like increasing one’s physical pleasure 
or enhancing intimacy. Some sexual motives can be con-
sidered avoidance motives if sexual activity is viewed as 
preventing a negative outcome, like reducing confl ict in a 
relationship. In a study of positive sexual motives among 
ninth graders, females valued achieving intimacy more 
than males and sexual pleasure less than males. Adoles-
cents expected that sexual experience would most likely 
satisfy motives for sexual pleasure, then for intimacy, and 
least for social status. Those ninth graders who were sex-
ually active had greater expectations that sexual activity 
would result in greater intimacy in the relationship than 
those who were not sexually active (Ott, Millstein, Ofner, & 
Halpern-Felsher, 2006).
more likely it is to be seen as a marker of the transition into 
adulthood or as a planned aspect of the deepening commit-
ment to an ongoing relationship (Terry-Humen, Manlove, 
& Cottingham, 2006).
In the United States, the recent trend has been toward 
a delay in sexual experience from 1988 to 2009, especially 
notable among adolescent boys. Data from a national sur-
vey of students in grades 9 through 12 conducted in 2009 
reported that 46% of students surveyed had had sexual 
intercourse during their lifetime. The prevalence of sexual 
intercourse increased with grade level, such that by twelfth 
grade, 62% of females and 64% of males were sexually expe-
rienced. Eleventh grade seems to be the tipping point, by 
which time more than half the students (51%) are sexually 
experienced (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
2010c).
Boys are more likely to report being sexually active than 
girls at the younger ages; 8.8% of boys and 3.7% of girls report 
having sexual intercourse before age 13. By grade 12, boys and 
girls are equally likely to be sexually active and report about the 
same likelihood of having had sex with four or more partners 
(20% of females and 22.6% of males). A signifi cant percent-
age of U.S. adolescents (roughly one third) have not had sexual 
intercourse by twelfth grade. This does not mean that they 
have had no experience with intimate behavior. In a study of 
11- and 12-year-old girls, 46% of 12-year-old girls had hugged 
a boy. Other intimate behaviors that were reported at this age 
were spending time alone with a boy, holding hands, and kiss-
ing (Hipwell, Keenan, Loeber, & Battista, 2010). Roughly 75% 
of U.S. teens have engaged in what they describe as heavy pet-
ting by the age of 18 (Haffner, 1998). It is not uncommon for 
teens to experience oral sex, even if they have not had sexual 
intercourse. Figure 9.2 compares teens ages 15 to 17 from 
three race/ethnic groups, non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, 
and non-Hispanic Blacks with respect to their sexual behavior. 
Three categories of sexual behavior are included: sexual inter-
course, oral sex only, and neither intercourse nor oral sex. His-
panic and non-Hispanic Black teens are more likely to report 
having had sexual intercourse than non-Hispanic White teens. 
Non-Hispanic White teens are more likely to report having 
oral sex only than the other two groups (Terry-Humen, Man-
love, & Cottingham, 2006).
There are at least fi ve reasons why data regarding entry 
into sexual activity and age at first intercourse must be 
interpreted with caution (Savin-Williams & Diamond, 
2004). First, teens who are uncomfortable or whose parents 
are uncomfortable participating in research on this topic will 
not be included. Second, studies rarely include questions 
about same-sex sexual activity that might be comparable to 
fi rst intercourse. Third, the reporting is retrospective (i.e., 
asking adolescents to think back to when they fi rst engaged 
in sexual activities) and thus is vulnerable to inconsistencies 
and memory errors. Fourth, cultural and social contexts may 
infl uence reporting. It may be socially desirable to exaggerate 
one’s sexual experiences in some communities, and socially

Bingham, Chopak, & Vicary, 1996; Meschke, Zweig, Barber, 
& Eccles, 2000; O’Sullivan, Meyer-Bahlburg, & Watkins, 
2000). Another reason that the link between hormonal levels 
and sexual debut is unclear for girls is that for many young 
girls their early sexual experiences were unwanted.
The Effects of Religious Beliefs on Sexual Behavior. 
One of the clearest cultural infl uences on adolescent sexual 
behavior is religious participation. Adolescents who fre-
quently attend religious services and church-related activi-
ties and who value religion as an important aspect of their 
lives have less permissive attitudes toward premarital sex. 
However, an adolescent’s attitudes toward premarital sex are 
shaped by many factors in addition to religious beliefs. By the 
time young people are making independent decisions about 
religious participation, they also have opinions on premari-
tal sex. Thus, those young people who have more permissive 
views on sex may be less likely to attend religious services and 
may fi nd less satisfaction in religious participation (Thornton 
& Camburn, 1989).
As an example of how religious beliefs can affect sexual 
behavior, the Southern Baptist Church initiated a program 
that encouraged teens to make a public virginity pledge. 
Since 1993, more than 2.5 million youth have taken this 
pledge, in which they vow to abstain from sex until marriage. 
In a study of those who participated in the program, the 
pledge was found to be most effective in delaying the age of 
fi rst intercourse when taken by younger teens. It is also more 
effective for pledge takers who are a minority among their 
peers. Taking the pledge is then viewed as an act of inde-
pendent decision making and identity commitment rather 
than as compliance to peer norms (Bearman & Brueckner, 
2001). Findings based on the National Longitudinal Study of 
Adolescent Health suggest that one of the hazards of taking 
the pledge is that when it is broken, youth are less well pre-
pared to engage in protected sex and are therefore at risk for 
sexually transmitted diseases (USA Today, 2004). In a study 
reported by Rosenbaum (2009), 5 years after making their 
pledge, 82% of teens denied having ever made this pledge. 
Those who had pledged were no different from matched 
nonpledgers in the percentage who had premarital sex, sexu-
ally transmitted diseases, or lifetime sexual partners.
Sexual Orientation
Although one might assume that sexual orientation— 
heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual—begins to take shape 
in early adolescence, the research on this point is limited 
and suggests a more differentiated path. Although 6% to 8% 
of youth responding to the National Longitudinal Study of 
Adolescent Health said that they had experienced same-sex 
attractions or same-sex relationships, only a small number 
acknowledged same-sex behaviors, and even fewer identi-
fi ed themselves as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Many teens who 
have self-identifi ed as gay or lesbian have also had cross-sex 
experiences. In studies of adults, many people who consider 
The second dimension, social controls, provides the 
normative environment in which sexual activity is embed-
ded. According to the model, these controls are a product of 
parental socialization and practices, school achievement and 
educational aspirations, and the attitudes and sexual expe-
riences of friends. We have added the important infl uence 
of religious beliefs and values to the model’s list of social 
controls.
The third dimension, attractiveness, infl uences the avail-
ability of partners. Attractiveness is defi ned in part by puber-
tal maturation, social acceptance or popularity, and also by 
whether one is judged to be pretty or handsome.
In an effort to assess this model, researchers found that 
the transition to sexual intercourse for White boys was most 
strongly predicted by hormonal levels and by popularity with 
the opposite sex. In contrast, there was no clear relationship 
between hormone levels and girls’ sexual activity (Udry, Billy, 
Morris, Groff, & Raj, 1985; Katchadourian, 1990). For girls, 
various social controls—including parents, school achieve-
ment, friends’ attitudes and behaviors, and religious values—
all play an important part in predicting sexual intercourse. 
A girl’s decision to become sexually active is infl uenced by 
her own self-esteem, her personal aspirations, her parents’ 
values, her educational expectations, and the capacity of her 
parents to exercise appropriate control over her social and 
school activities, and the norms of her peer group (Crockett,

a shocking realization. In other ways, it may help focus and 
clarify feelings of uncertainty and dissociation that had been 
diffi cult for the child to understand at an earlier age. Not all 
young people who eventually recognize their same-sex sexual 
orientation reach the point of self-labeling in adolescence. 
However, with the greater visibility, openness, and acceptance 
of differences in sexual orientation and the presence of homo-
sexual role models, it is increasingly likely that this will happen.
Disclosure. Disclosure may be a prolonged process in which 
young people carefully decide which individuals can be trusted 
with this information, or it can be a very open, obvious state-
ment of personal identity. Reports of adolescents who are openly 
gay suggest that disclosure can be very stressful when it is 
accompanied by negative reactions from parents and friends and 
by acts of open hostility from school peers (Remafedi, 1987). 
Anticipating the strong social censure attached to an unconven-
tional sexual orientation, adolescents may deny or mask it by 
functioning as heterosexuals during this period of life.
I feared not being liked and being alienated. I was president 
of various school clubs, and once I beat up a guy for being 
a faggot. I was adamant that fags should be booted out of 
the Boy Scouts. Other kids asked me why I was so rough on 
them. I did not say. No one suspected me because I did sports 
and had several girlfriends. (Savin-Williams, 1996, p. 169)
Disclosure typically occurs fi rst with close friends, and 
later, if at all, with family members. Studies of gay, lesbian, 
and bisexual youth suggest that parental acceptance and 
the ability to maintain closeness and autonomy with par-
ents after disclosure are very important to their continued 
identity development and well-being (Floyd, Stein, Harter, 
themselves heterosexual have had same-sex attractions 
and experiences (Savin-Williams & Diamond, 2004). For 
sexual minority youth, two aspects of a sexual orientation 
have been identifi ed: self-labeling and disclosure (Savin-
Williams, 1996). Self-labeling refers to applying a label such 
as gay, lesbian, or bisexual to oneself. Disclosure refers to 
sharing this information with others.
Self-Labeling. In one study of 77 gay men, most recalled 
having an awareness of gay feelings as early as middle school or 
early adolescence, but they did not label themselves gay until 
later adolescence (D’Augelli, 1991). The majority (75%) knew 
they were gay before their first sexual experience. However, 
once they had labeled themselves gay, they waited an average of 
8 years to disclose their homosexuality to someone else.
Self-labeling may begin with experiences in early child-
hood when boys or girls recall feeling different from their 
peers. These feelings, typically captured in retrospective stud-
ies of gay or lesbian young adults, may include a general sense 
that they did not share the same interests as others of their 
same sex. Boys may recall being more sensitive than their 
peers or being drawn to more artistic and aesthetic interests. 
Girls may remember passionate, mysterious friendships in the 
prepubertal and early adolescent period (Diamond, 2000). In 
many instances, these feelings of being different are associated 
with confusion and a sense of isolation or lack of belonging.
Often, at puberty, the implications of these earlier child-
hood experiences become more evident. A growing awareness 
of one’s own sexual interests and fantasies, coupled with new 
information about the variety of sexual orientations that may 
exist in the peer group or community, leads to new insights 
about one’s own sexual preferences. In some ways, this may be

unwanted or forced intercourse (Small & Kerns, 1993). 
In many of these instances, unwanted sexual intercourse 
occurred on the fi rst date or in a dating relationship. This 
pattern illustrates the problematic nature of sexual contact 
in early adolescence. The boundaries for acceptable sexual 
contact are unclear; the sexual agenda for boys and girls is 
likely to be very different; and other risk-taking behaviors, 
including alcohol and drug use, may create an unwanted 
sexual encounter.
In an effort to learn more about adolescents’ reactions fol-
lowing their involvement in sexual intercourse, Australian 
researchers surveyed students in secondary schools in seven 
of the eight Australian states and territories (Donald, Lucke, 
Dunne, & Raphael, 1995). Students were asked about the 
context of their most recent sexual experience and how they 
felt about it. The majority of boys and girls said they felt 
good about their most recent sexual experience, with older 
students (ages 16 and 17) more likely to be positive about 
it than the younger students (15 and under). For girls, fi ve 
factors were signifi cantly associated with feeling good about 
their most recent sexual experience: believing that there was 
a low risk for contracting a sexually transmitted disease; hav-
ing a steady relationship with the partner; having talked with 
their partner about avoiding pregnancy; having talked with 
their partner about ways of having sexual pleasure without 
having intercourse; and not being drunk or high. For boys, 
two factors were signifi cantly associated with feeling good 
about their most recent sexual experience: having sex with a 
steady partner and not being drunk or high. Larger percent-
ages of girls than boys were likely to say they felt used or bad 
after their most recent sexual experience, and the younger 
girls were more likely than older girls to say they felt bad or 
used. About equal percentages of girls and boys said they felt 
guilty after their most recent sexual experience.
The lack of supervision and monitoring by adults, as well 
as the lack of opportunity to talk about sexuality with them, 
can place adolescents at risk for early sexual experiences that 
are abusive or associated with negative feelings. The sex-linked 
problems that many people encounter—unintended preg-
nancy, marital infi delity, rape and other forms of unwanted 
sexual contact, child sexual abuse, pornography addiction, 
and sexually transmitted diseases—are evidence that the 
socialization process—including efforts by parents, teachers, 
and religious leaders—is failing to promote mature sexuality 
in signifi cant numbers of adolescents and adults in the United 
States.
Inconsistent Contraception. Despite the fact that many 
parents and teachers do not provide information about the 
use of contraceptives as part of their education about sex and 
sexual behavior, the use of contraceptives by U.S. teens has 
increased. In 2005, 63% of the sexually active students in 
grades 9 through 12 reported that they or their partner used 
a condom during their most recent sexual intercourse (Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006). Although 
contraceptive use has increased among adolescents, their use 
Allison, & Nye, 1999). Most mental health professionals 
suggest that even when disclosure is accompanied by nega-
tive reactions, it has many emotional and social advan-
tages. By disclosing, the young person has a greater sense 
of authenticity and freedom. Once adolescents disclose to 
their friends and family, they can be more readily integrated 
into the gay community and fi nd others who will help sup-
port their emerging identity. They can direct more of their 
effort to the task of integrating their gender identity, sexual 
identity, and social relationships and figuring out how to 
cope with the challenges that their minority sexual orienta-
tion poses. Despite growing societal awareness of the diver-
sity of sexual orientations, sexual minority youth continue to 
face negative attitudes from teachers, peers, and community 
members; possible social rejection; and diffi culty fi nding age-
appropriate, nonexploitive sexual partners.
Problems and Confl icts Associated 
with Sexuality
The sexual system is one of the most problematic compo-
nents of psychosocial development for young people in the 
United States. Most parents do not feel comfortable dis-
cussing sexuality with their children. In addition to private 
thoughts, impulses, and fantasies, which may result in feel-
ings of guilt or confusion, young people confront confl icting 
messages about sexual behavior from their peers, the mass 
media, and the religious community. For example, in the 
late 1990s, the U.S. Congress authorized funding to support 
programs that taught abstinence as the primary approach to 
sex education. These programs were required to teach about 
the social, psychological, and health benefi ts of abstinence; 
the risks of sex outside of marriage; and the importance of 
monogamy. At the same time, adolescents recognize that 
nonmarital abstinence is not being practiced now and was 
not practiced by their parents’ generation. National stud-
ies show that the vast majority of both men and women are 
not virgins when they marry. In a congressional review of 13 
government-funded abstinence-only curricula, 11 presented 
information that included “unproved claims, subjective 
conclusions, or outright falsehoods regarding reproductive 
health, gender traits, and when life begins” (Connolly, 2004, 
p. AO1).
Perhaps in part because of the scarcity of well-integrated, 
scientifi cally based educational programs to help students 
understand and cope with their sexual growth and desires 
for intimacy, three problems arise that are discussed in the 
following: unwanted sexual attention, inconsistent contra-
ceptive use, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Unwanted Sexual Attention. Many adolescents, espe-
cially girls, are exposed to unwanted sexual attention. In a 
national survey, 7.5% of students in grades 9 to 12 reported 
being forced to have sexual intercourse (Centers for Dis-
ease Control, 2006). In a sample of seventh-, ninth-, and 
eleventh-grade girls, 21% reported unwanted sexual con-
tact, ranging from unwanted touching and fondling to 

350 | 
CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
were between the ages of 15 and 24 (Weinstock, Berman, & 
Cates, 2004). Untreated, chlamydia and gonorrhea can pro-
duce pelvic infl ammatory disease, leading to infertility and 
abnormal pregnancies (Alan Guttmacher Institute, 1999).
A major focus of AIDS and HIV education has been 
directed toward adolescents. The number of AIDS cases 
reported among U.S. adolescents increased from 53 in 1986 
to 4,428 in 2001; 52% among males and 48% among females. 
Most of these cases are a result of sexual transmission (Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006). Although 
adolescents believe that they have a strong understanding of 
AIDS as a disease, including its transmission and prevention, 
studies have shown that their knowledge is often confused 
or incorrect (Meschke, Bartholomae, & Zentall, 2002). At the 
same time, adolescents express little interest in learning more 
about AIDS. Many young people overestimate how well they 
understand this health problem. Others are cynical about get-
ting the specifi c information they need from typical school-
based sex education courses. These courses are often unable 
to provide the practical information that is needed to resolve 
questions about contraception, sexual intimacy, and specifi c 
patterns of physical contact that might lead to transmission 
of the disease. For example, many state and federal policies 
prohibit teaching about correct condom use as part of their 
sex education program, even in programs intended to focus 
on HIV/AIDS prevention (Alan Guttmacher Institute, 2002).
Parenthood in Early Adolescence
One of the consequences of early entry into sexual activity 
and inconsistent use of contraception is adolescent preg-
nancy. In 2007, 451,000 infants were born to women age 
19 or younger in the United States. The birth rate was 42.5 
births per 1,000 girls ages 15 to 19, up slightly from the low 
of 40.4 in 2005 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). In efforts to 
continues to be inconsistent. In part, this is because sexual 
activity among many adolescents is sporadic. In addition, 
studies of contraceptive use among adolescents have identifi ed 
a number of explanations for inconsistent use: lack of knowl-
edge about the need for contraception; lack of skills in the use 
of contraceptives and a desire to avoid embarrassment; barri-
ers to acquiring contraceptives including cost, lack of anonym-
ity, and religious or cultural barriers; lack of communication 
among the partners about who is responsible for contraceptive 
use; a view that contraceptives intrude on the spontaneity of 
sexual activity; and the involvement of drugs and alcohol with 
sexual activity, which may increase impulsiveness and reduce 
reasoned decision making (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 2006; Moore & Rosenthal, 2006).
In a study about adolescents’ views on contraceptive use 
it was clear that many adolescents were confused about the 
difference between contraception for the prevention of preg-
nancy and contraception for the prevention of STIs. For 
example, girls might say that they were more likely to expect 
a boy to use a condom if this was a casual sexual relationship, 
but that it wasn’t necessary if it was a steady relationship.
Jane answered unequivocally “yes” to the question whether 
young people she knew would use condoms every time 
they had sexual intercourse. But she added: “Depending on 
whether they didn’t want to—and whether the girl’s on the 
pill and they were in a steady relationship and they didn’t 
want to use one. But otherwise most people would use 
them.” (Kirkman et al., 1998)
Sexually Transmitted Infections. About 25% of sexu-
ally active teens contract a sexually transmitted infection 
each year. Teens are especially at risk for chlamydia, genital 
herpes, and gonorrhea. In the year 2000, of those cases of 
chlamydia where the age of the person was reported, 75%

high-poverty neighborhoods are at greater risk for teenage 
pregnancy and dropping out of school, both of which con-
tribute to continuing poverty in adulthood (Harding, 2003; 
Hao & Cherlin, 2004). The relation between age at fi rst preg-
nancy and family income by age 27 was studied in a sample 
of African American, Hispanic American, and European 
American women (Moore et al., 1993). This effect is medi-
ated through a number of other personal and family factors 
that unfold following the fi rst birth, such as continuing in 
school, the chances of getting married, the kind of work one 
does and one’s personal earnings, and the earning capacity 
of other family members. For African American women, the 
poverty level is high regardless of age at fi rst birth. However, 
the earlier African American women begin childbearing, the 
more children they are likely to have—a factor that increases 
their level of poverty. For Hispanic American women, delay-
ing childbearing resulted in higher educational attainment, 
a factor that predicts higher personal income by age 27. For 
European American women, delaying the age of childbear-
ing was associated with older age at first marriage, fewer 
children, and higher personal earnings. For all three ethnic 
groups, but especially for European Americans and Hispanic 
Americans, each year of delayed childbearing had a substan-
tial impact on reducing the chances of ending up in poverty 
by age 27.
Complications during labor and delivery may be devastat-
ing to the newborn’s health. Are young mothers more likely 
than older ones to experience such complications? Mothers 
under 19 are less likely than older mothers to initiate prena-
tal care during the fi rst trimester of pregnancy. Infants born 
to mothers under 17 are at greater risk than those born to 
women in their twenties and thirties. They have a higher 
risk of dying during the fi rst year, of being born prematurely 
or with a low birth weight, and of suffering neurological 
damage as a result of complications associated with deliv-
ery (McCarthy & Hardy, 1993; U.S. Census Bureau, 2003). 
Thus, young parents are more likely to have to cope with 
the special needs of a child with developmental disabilities. 
However, these risks arise from converging socioeconomic 
factors rather than from any biological inadequacies of being 
young. Studies involving large numbers of births at urban 
hospitals have found that younger mothers (i.e., those under 
20) who are not poor are actually less likely to experience 
complications of pregnancy and negative birth outcomes 
than older mothers of similar economic standing (Roosa, 
1984; McCarthy & Hardy, 1993).
Complications of pregnancy and negative birth out-
comes for adolescent mothers are linked to the contexts of 
pregnancy. One study found that in a sample of 170 African 
American teens, the pregnancy was unplanned or unwanted in 
about half the cases (Crosby, DiClemente, Wingood, Rose, & 
Lang, 2003). Other studies have linked sexual abuse in 
childhood with earlier sexual activity and teen pregnancy 
(Cinq-Mars, Wright, Cyr, & McDuff, 2003; Brown, Cohen, 
Chen, Smailes, & Johnson, 2004). When pregnancy occurs 
in these abusive or exploitive contexts, it is likely to be 
explain the decline in birthrates to young mothers during 
the 1990s, data were collected that focused on sexual activity 
and contraceptive use. Both delays in the initiation of sexual 
activity and more effective contraceptive use were important 
factors that contributed to the decline in teen pregnancy 
(Santelli et al., 2004).
Predictors of Teenage Pregnancy. Are there any char-
acteristics of teenage girls or their family and community 
contexts that are systematically linked to the likelihood of 
becoming pregnant? Using two national samples, Mollborn 
and Morningstar (2009) compared teenage girls who were 
pregnant to similar age girls who did not become pregnant, 
and to women who became pregnant at age 20 or older. 
The teenage mothers were more distressed; that is, they had 
higher scores on a measure of depression, than the other two 
groups, and these young mothers continued to be more dis-
tressed into their early and middle adulthood than women 
who were mothers at an older age. However, the study 
found that these differences in distress were already evident 
before the girls became pregnant, and that when other fac-
tors were taken into consideration, depression was not a sig-
nifi cant predictor of becoming pregnant. The risk factors for 
becoming a teenage mother included: low parental educa-
tion, having low grades in school, being in a single mother 
or stepparent family, and having had sexual intercourse. For 
those girls who lived in very low-resource households, being 
poor coupled with high levels of distress combined to pre-
dict the increased likelihood of teen pregnancy.
Consequences of Teenage Pregnancy. The phenom-
enon of teenage parenthood is complex, touching the lives of 
the adolescent mother and father, the child or children born 
to them, their parents, and the schools, counseling services, 
and family planning services that have been created to help 
young parents cope with parenthood. The consequences of 
teenage pregnancy and parenthood for the young mother and 
her infant depend on the psychosocial context of the preg-
nancy. Within the time period of early adolescence, there is a 
big difference between becoming a mother at 14 or at 18. For 
the younger teens (i.e., those younger than 14), the pregnan-
cies are typically unplanned and often a result of involuntary 
or forced sexual encounters. Younger teens are more likely 
to end their pregnancy by abortion. For the older teens, the 
girl’s partner is usually within 2 years of her age, and even if 
the pregnancy was unplanned, the majority of girls go ahead 
with the birth. Overall, 27% of pregnancies among those 15 
to 19 years old ended in abortion in 2006 (Alan Guttmacher 
Institute, 2010). Overall, fewer than 2% of unmarried preg-
nant teens choose to allow the baby to be adopted (Moore, 
Miller et al., 1995; Moore & Rosenthal, 2006).
Two common consequences of early pregnancy are its 
association with poverty, and the increased risk of birth 
complications associated with a lack of prenatal care. The 
most signifi cant measurable impact of early pregnancy is its 
association with subsequent poverty. Teens growing up in 

352 | 
CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
However, by the time the children are in school, contact drops 
off. In one study, half of the new adolescent fathers had weekly 
contact with their child, but by the time the children were in 
school, only 25% were still seeing the child weekly (Lerman, 
1993). Some adolescent fathers marry the mothers; others live 
with them for a while. Often, the couple continues to date. 
In some instances, they actually marry several years after the 
child is born. In many cases, the father contributes fi nancial 
support to the mother and child, even when the couples do 
not marry. Many adolescent fathers, however, have little edu-
cation and are minimally employed, so the material support 
they can provide is limited (Bunting & McAuley, 2004).
Fathering a child is bound to stimulate confl icting feelings 
of pride, guilt, and anxiety in the adolescent boy. He must 
struggle with the fact that he contributed to a pregnancy that 
may bring confl ict and pain to someone for whom he cares. 
Also, he must confront the choices that he and his girlfriend 
have in coping with an unplanned pregnancy. Furthermore, 
he may feel excluded from the birth of a child he has fathered. 
Feeling obligated to provide fi nancial support for his girlfriend 
and child may lead him to drop out of school and enter the 
labor market, even though he can only hope to be minimally 
employed (Hendricks & Fullilove, 1983; Paschal, 2006).
Little systematic research has been done on the attitudes, 
knowledge, or behaviors of adolescent fathers or the impact 
of fatherhood on a teenage boy’s subsequent development. 
One study followed a large sample of adolescent boys through 
their teen years. Those who became fathers were character-
ized as having lower self-esteem and a lower sense of inter-
nal control than their age-mates who did not become fathers. 
Shortly after fatherhood, these boys experienced a boost in 
accompanied by alcohol or drug use, cigarette smoking, and 
heightened anxiety, all of which may contribute to low birth 
weight and neurological impairments for the infants. Teens 
who become pregnant under these circumstances are more 
likely to be socially isolated and to become psychologically 
disengaged from their infants. In contrast, when teen preg-
nancy occurs in the context of family, peer, and partner sup-
port, teen mothers are likely to receive encouragement for 
their caregiving, greater fi nancial support, and opportunities 
to engage in appropriate social and educational activities that 
contribute to their own psychosocial maturity (Bunting & 
McAuley, 2004).
For some teens, the experience of motherhood has an 
enhancing or self-righting impact. In a comparison of adoles-
cent mothers who ended their pregnancies through abortion 
and those who kept their babies, the latter group demon-
strated some important changes in their behavior. Rates of 
delinquency declined in this group, and they reduced their 
cigarette smoking and marijuana use (Hope, Wilder, & 
Watt, 2003). Young mothers may be inspired by their infant 
to make a better future for themselves and their baby. This 
often means completing their education, creating a more sta-
ble home environment, and taking better care of their own 
health.
Adolescent Fathers. Although the focus of studies on 
adolescent pregnancy has been on girls, there is growing 
interest in factors that predict early fatherhood, as well as 
concerns about the impact of early fatherhood on subsequent 
development. Data from the National Longitudinal Study of 
Youth provided information about approximately 1,500 boys 
ages 13 or 14 who were studied over a period of 8 years. 
Participants reported their age at the birth of their fi rst child. 
Overall, 140 participants or slightly over 9% became fathers 
before the age of 20. A combination of individual, family, 
peer, and environmental factors predicted early age of father-
hood in this sample. Boys who were involved in more delin-
quent behaviors and more substance use were more likely 
to become fathers. Boys who started dating at a younger age 
were more likely to become fathers. Boys whose mothers had 
less education, and who had their sons while they were ado-
lescents, were more likely to become fathers. Boys who were 
living in a single parent home or not living with their biolog-
ical father were more likely to become fathers. And boys who 
were living in more dangerous neighborhoods were more 
likely to become fathers. After taking all these factors into 
account, sons of adolescent fathers were at greater risk for 
becoming fathers themselves in adolescence than were boys 
whose fathers were 20 or older at their birth. These find-
ings suggest an intergenerational pattern of early fathering in 
which young boys learn about early sexual activity as a path-
way into adulthood as part of the family socialization process 
(Sipsma, Biello, Cole-Lewis, & Kershaw, 2010).
Most studies of adolescent pregnancy fi nd that—contrary 
to the stereotype—many fathers remain in contact with the 
mother and the child in the fi rst months after the child is born. 
Not much is known about the impact of teen fathering on a 
boy’s psychological development. What factors might infl uence 
whether the boy becomes committed to nurturing and support-
ing his child or leaves the parenting entirely to the mother and 
her family?

Brain Development in Adolescence
You will recall from Chapter 4, which is about the prenatal 
period, that the brain is comprised of gray matter, the cell 
body of neurons and the nonmyelinated sections of axons 
and dendrites, and white matter, the myelinated axons that 
connect gray matter and carry messages between nerve cells 
and brain regions. Myelin is a substance that forms around 
the axons, acting as an insulator that speeds signals from one 
neuron to the next. Gray matter volume and distribution are 
associated with competence in that region of the brain. White 
matter is associated with speed and effi ciency of processing.
Brain development is ongoing throughout the prenatal 
period, infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Like 
physical maturation, it is very individual, refl ecting an ongo-
ing interaction between genetics and environment. Brain 
development is characterized by periods of intense produc-
tion of neurons and synapses followed by a process of sculpt-
ing and pruning when some connections are strengthened 
and others drop away. One of the most important discover-
ies related to adolescent brain development is that various 
areas of the cerebral cortex reach their peak in gray matter 
production during early adolescence, followed by a process 
of sculpting and pruning. The timing for these peak periods 
of gray matter production vary quite a bit from one person 
to the next, but the average is around ages 10 to 12 for the 
parietal lobe, ages 11 to 12 for the frontal lobe, and ages 16 
to 17 for the temporal lobe (Lenroot & Giedd, 2006).
The process of sculpting and pruning that occurs during 
the course of the high school years strengthens certain neu-
ral networks while others fall into disuse. Whatever a young 
person does frequently will be woven into a strong, well-
integrated network of neural signals; neural functions that 
are infrequently or rarely stimulated will weaken. Thus, the 
high school years provide a truly irreplaceable opportunity 
to shape a person’s neural landscape, creating areas of unique 
competence and mastery that develop as a result of active 
engagement in certain thoughts and behaviors.
In contrast to the gray matter, which shows an inverted 
U-shaped pattern, increasing from childhood through ado-
lescence and declining in the late teens and early adulthood, 
there is a steady increase in the volume of white matter from 
ages 4 through the twenties. The prefrontal cortex, which is 
responsible for the full range of executive functions, is not 
fully myelinated until the twenties.
Executive functions, sometimes called cognitive control 
functions, include: 
Working memory. The memory system used for 
temporarily storing and managing the information 
required to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as 
learning, reasoning, and comprehension.
Planning and organizing. Devising an approach to a 
complex task, including following a sequence of steps to 
task completion and using feedback to revise one’s plan.
Impulse control. Including resisting distractions, self-
regulation, and behavioral inhibition.
self-esteem, but in the next several years, their self-esteem 
declined to its prefatherhood level (Pirog-Good, 1995).
Researchers who have studied the topic of unwed fathers 
argue that much stronger emphasis should be placed on the 
father’s responsibility, not only for fi nancial support of the 
mother and child, but also for his continued interaction with 
his child. School counselors, for example, tend to have a 
much clearer idea about how to support the continuing psy-
chosocial development of teen mothers and their children 
than about how to support the continuing development of 
teen fathers (Kiselica, Gorcynski, & Capps, 1998). Efforts to 
include young fathers in family planning programs, parent 
education, and employment training initiatives would help 
strengthen the social context for the young mother and her 
child and would contribute to the young father’s psychoso-
cial development (Armstrong et al., 1999).
For both girls and boys, a key to the prevention of early 
pregnancy requires the building of greater confi dence in and 
commitment to the consistent use of contraception as part of 
any sexual relationship and comfortable, user-friendly access 
to reproductive health care (Cicatelli, 2004). For girls, foster-
ing a sense of self-effi cacy and investment in academic goals 
leading to postsecondary education or professional training is 
an especially important area for intervention. For boys, build-
ing greater social expectations and commitment to assum-
ing the fi nancial and social responsibilities associated with 
fatherhood—including sending clearer messages from family 
and community that boys have responsibilities in these areas 
and devising specifi c opportunities for them to enact these 
responsibilities—seem promising directions for future inter-
vention. For more information on pregnancy prevention pro-

Formal Operations
Objective 3. To introduce and critically evaluate the basic 
features of formal operational thought, highlighting the 
new conceptual skills that emerge in early adolescence 
and the factors that promote the development of 
advanced reasoning at this period of life.
As the body undergoes signifi cant changes during puberty, so 
too does mental activity. Early adolescents begin to think about 
themselves and their world in new ways that refl ect a broad-
ening of consciousness. This includes greater introspection or 
monitoring of their thoughts, greater integration of informa-
tion from various sources, and more focused planning and 
control of behaviors guided by goals and strategies. Young peo-
ple are able to think about several dimensions at once rather 
than focusing on just one domain or issue at a time. They are 
able to generate hypotheses about events that they have never 
perceived and to use logical reasoning to evaluate evidence to 
support or disconfi rm these hypotheses (Keating, 2004).

accomplishments possible for adolescents; and, at the same 
time, the effort and persistence an adolescent exerts toward 
advanced skill building stimulates new neural growth.
Piaget’s Theory of Formal 
Operational Thought
Without the benefi t of brain scans, Jean Piaget proposed a 
qualitative shift in thinking during adolescence from con-
crete to formal operational thought (Inhelder & Piaget, 
1958; Piaget, 1970, 1972a). In the period of concrete oper-
ational thought, children use mental operations to explain 
changes in tangible objects and events. In the period of for-
mal operational thought, young people use operations to 
manipulate and modify thoughts and other mental opera-
tions (Piaget, 1972b). A central feature of formal operational 
reasoning is the ability to separate and distinguish between 
reality and possibility. For example, in thinking about trying 
to get a part-time job, adolescents may consider the possi-
bilities about work related to the kind of work they would 
like to do and the kind of work they think they are quali-
fi ed to do. They may also consider certain realities such as 
the specifi c jobs that are available in their town, the number 
of hours they can work given other school and family com-
mitments, and their access to transportation. They are able 
to create different scenarios about working, based partly on 
what they want and partly on what they learn in the process 
of applying for jobs. Some of the possibilities they may have 
considered are no longer realistic; and some of the infor-
mation suggests new possibilities that they may not have 
considered.
The combination of changes in gray matter and white 
matter in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes and the 
resulting improvements in executive functions are associated 
with the following potential changes in mental competence 
during adolescence (see Figure 9.4).
Ages 10.5 to 13: New growth in the visual and 
auditory regions of the brain; new ability to perform 
calculations; increasing ability to perceive new 
meanings and functions for familiar objects.
Ages 13 to 17: New growth in visuoauditory, 
visuospatial, and somatic systems; new ability to 
review mental operations (metacognition), especially 
the ability to fi nd fl aws in one’s reasoning and to use 
information to revise problem-solving strategies.
Ages 17 to 21: New growth in prefrontal cortex: 
new abilities to question and evaluate information; 
new abilities to formulate hypotheses based on new 
information from a variety of sources.
The relationship of the brain and behaviors is bidirec-
tional. Many studies have shown a relationship between 
maturation in the prefrontal cortex and improvements in 
executive functions including working memory and response 
inhibition (Paus, 2005). At the same time, studies have shown 
that repeated activity, such as musical training, can alter brain 
structure. For example, a 3-month period of juggling practice 
was found to be related to an increase in gray-matter den-
sity in the motion-processing region of the brain (Draganski 
et al., 2004). In other words, the maturing brain makes new

and evaluate information, form new and original hypotheses integrating their own experiences

rather, it is a way of approaching and solving problems based 
on new capacities for abstract, probabilistic thinking. Six 
conceptual skills emerge during the stage of formal opera-
tions that have implications for how adolescents approach 
interpersonal relationships and the formulation of personal 
plans and goals and for how they analyze scientific and 
mathematical information (see Table 9.2; Neimark, 1982; 
Demetriou & Efklides, 1985; Gray, 1990). First, adolescents 
are able to mentally manipulate more than two categories of 
variables at the same time; for example, they can consider 
the relationship of speed, distance, and time in planning a 
trip (Acredolo, Adams, & Schmid, 1984). They can draw on 
many variables to explain their behavior as well as that of 
others. Second, they are able to think about things changing 
in the future. They can realize, for instance, that their current 
friendships may not remain the same in the years ahead.
In the maturation of scientifi c reasoning, the ability to dis-
tinguish between reality and possibility results in the formal 
operational process of hypothesis testing. Hypotheses are ten-
tative propositions or possible explanations about the causes 
of events or the systematic associations among factors that 
explain events. In the scientifi c process, one raises hypotheses 
to explain an event, and then follows the chain of evidence to 
determine whether the reality supports the hypothesis. One 
of the classic experiments that Piaget and Inhelder designed 
to demonstrate the development of hypothetical deductive 
reasoning involves the explanation of the swing of a pendu-
lum. The task is to fi nd out what variable or combination of 
variables controls the speed of the swing. Four factors can be 
varied: the mass of the object, the height from which the pen-
dulum is pushed, the force with which it is pushed, and the 
length of the string. To investigate this problem, it is neces-
sary to begin by isolating the separate factors and then varying 
only one factor at a time while keeping the others constant. As 
it happens, only the length of the string infl uences the speed 
of the pendulum. The challenge, then, is to demonstrate that 
the length of the string accounts for the speed of the pendu-
lum and that the other factors do not. Children at the stage of 
concrete operational thought have diffi culty coordinating the 
interaction among four separate variables and may lose track 
of what is being varied and what is held constant. After trying 
one or two strategies, they may simply give up. In contrast, 
being able to use formal operational thought, a child can cre-
ate a matrix of variables and test each factor separately to eval-
uate its contribution (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958; Flavell, 1963).
Six Characteristics of Formal Operational Thought. 
Formal operational thought is not a specifi c skill or expertise; 
The opportunity to manipulate 
vari ables in an experimental 
situation stimulates formal op-
erational thought. At the same 
time, the capacity for hypoth-
esis testing makes it possible 
for students to evaluate the 
results of their experiments. 
How might you design chem-
istry experiments so that they 
are most likely to foster formal 
operational reasoning?

CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
under the most supportive conditions, more abstract, sys-
tematic, and self-reflective qualities of thought can be 
observed and bring a new perspective to the way adolescents 
approach the analysis of information and the acquisition of 
knowledge (Lee & Freire, 2003).
Factors That Promote Formal Operational Thought. 
Neurological development alone is not enough to foster for-
mal operational thought. Healthy brain development must 
be coupled with a social environment that encourages hypo-
thetical, abstract reasoning; opportunities to investigate and 
explore alternative solutions; and a well-developed symbolic 
capacity for carrying out mental representations and opera-
tions. The affective components of interest, motivation, and 
self-effi cacy are also involved in sustaining engagement with 
complex problems and the emotional regulation that allows 
one to stay focused despite frustrations and failures.
Several environmental conditions facilitate the develop-
ment of formal operational thought and reduce egocen-
trism. First, early adolescents begin to function in a variety 
of role relationships that place both compatible and con-
fl icting demands on them. Among these role relationships 
are son or daughter, worker, student, friend, dating part-
ner, religious believer, and citizen. Early adolescents expe-
rience fi rsthand the pressures of multiple expectations for 
behavior. Participating in a variety of roles also facilitates 
relativistic thinking by demonstrating that what is accept-
able and valued in one situation may not be in another. A 
second environmental factor is the adolescent’s participa-
tion in a more heterogeneous peer group. When children 
move from their community elementary school to a more 
centralized junior high and high school, they are likely to 
meet other students whose family backgrounds and social 
Third, adolescents are able to hypothesize about a logical 
sequence of possible events. For example, they are able to 
predict college and occupational options that may be open 
to them, depending on how well they do in certain academic 
coursework in high school. Fourth, they are able to antici-
pate the consequences of their actions. For instance, they 
realize that if they drop out of school, certain career possi-
bilities will be closed to them.
Fifth, they have the capacity to detect the logical consis-
tency or inconsistency of a set of statements. They can test 
the truth of a statement by fi nding evidence that supports or 
disproves it. They are troubled, for example, by the apparent 
contradiction between statements such as “all people are equal 
before the law” and the reality that people who have more 
money can afford better legal representation and are likely to 
have different experiences with the legal system than those 
who live in poverty.
Sixth, adolescents are able to think in a relativistic way 
about themselves, other individuals, and their world. They 
know that they are expected to act in a particular way 
because of the norms of their community and their culture. 
Adolescents also know that in other families, communities, 
and cultures, different norms may govern the same behavior. 
As a result, the decision to behave in a culturally accepted 
manner becomes a more conscious commitment to their cul-
tural group. At the same time, it is easier for them to accept 
members of other cultures, because they realize that these 
people are the products of societies with different sets of 
rules and norms.
These qualities of thought refl ect what is possible for ado-
lescents rather than what is typical. Most adolescents and 
older adults approach problem solving in a practical, con-
crete way in their common, daily functioning. However, 
Conversations with parents 
often force adolescents to 
rethink their assumptions or 
come up with sup port for 
their decisions. Although this 
is not always pleasant, these 
kinds of interactions are an 
impor tant stimulus for more 
advanced reasoning.

her situation and the two friends together can explore a per-
sonal problem on a more objective, rational basis than Cindy 
probably could have done on her own.
The third condition that fosters the development of the 
cognitive skills of early adolescence is the content of the 
high school curriculum. Guided by Vygotsky’s theory of a 
zone of proximal development, we assume that an adoles-
cent’s capacities for formal operational reasoning are ready 
to be nurtured and advanced through exposure to educa-
tional experiences that promote systematic logical reasoning 
and problem solving. Courses in science and mathemat-
ics formally introduce students to the logical relationships 
inherent in these disciplines, and give them practice in a 
hypothetical deductive style of reasoning. Courses in the 
social sciences, such as child development, psychology, 
anthropology, or sociology introduce students to the organi-
zation of societies, individual differences in perspective, and 
psychological mindedness. The fi ne arts and the humanities 
advance students’ conceptions of ways the world has been 
or might be. They expand the repertoire of representational 
thought. According to Gardner’s model of multiple intelli-
gences (discussed in Chapter 8), the visual arts provide a 
means of integrating and innovating spatial intelligence 
with interpersonal intelligence. Many high schools involve 
students in community service learning, an experience that 
helps promote a greater sense of connection to the commu-
nity and appreciation for the diverse perspectives on com-
munity improvement. The more complex, differentiated 
academic environment of the high school can bring substan-
tial gains in conceptual skills for those students who become 
actively engaged in its academic programs (Gehlbach, 2006; 
Yamauchi, Billig, Meyer, & Hofschire, 2006; Cohen & 
Sandy, 2007).
The following examples illustrate how high school course 
experiences contributed to students’ formal operational 
reasoning.
“In my senior physics class we would learn new concepts 
then apply them by building something. For example we 
were learning about inertia so then we had to build a cart 
to hold a pumpkin and it had to go straight and travel a 
certain distance.”
“An assignment that enhanced   my logical reasoning and 
critical thinking was to design a school playground using 
specifi c software. I had to think about dimensions of my 
playground and logically think about safety issues in the 
design.”
“In high school I took a money matters course that talked 
about saving money, stocks, loans, debt, and every other 
aspect of money. It made me think in a much more logical 
way because hearing it from someone other than my parents 
made it more real.”
“In my AP art class my senior year my teacher gave us a 
topic and we had to do 20 pieces of artwork with that one 
topic/object. Mine was a seashell and water. It broadened 
my thinking to think of 20 different things to do with a 
seashell.” (Newman, 2010)
class are different from their own. In working and playing 
with these friends, they realize the extent to which their 
expectations for the future differ from those of their new 
acquaintances because their values are shaped by the fami-
lies and neighborhood from which they come. In research 
involving Mexican high school students, those who were 
identifi ed as leaders, especially those with cross-cultural con-
tact and those who were of high socioeconomic status, rea-
soned at higher stages than those who were not (Commons, 
Galaz-Fontes, & Morse, 2006).
The use of formal operational skills can be observed in 
adolescent discussions of peer-related issues and in the for-
mation of intimate or romantic relationships—domains that 
require a wide range of hypothesis raising and testing. An 
example of a conversation between a 15-year-old girl and her 
best friend follows.
CINDY: I’m so frustrated I can’t stand it. Before Sean and I 
started to date, he was nice to me. I enjoyed being with him. 
He said hello to me in the halls; we’d walk along together. We 
talked about all kinds of things. Now that we’re going out, 
he seems rude and uncaring. When we’re with other people, 
he jumps in when I start to talk, and his eyes say “be quiet.” 
He breezes by me in the halls sometimes, and when we talk 
about things (if we talk), he acts as if he is always right. I 
don’t think he cares about me anymore. What’s going on?
DONNA: I know he likes you because he tells me. Maybe you 
should talk to him and tell him what he does and how it 
makes you feel.
CINDY: No, if I do that he’ll get mad and he won’t like me 
anymore. Why don’t you talk to him?
DONNA: No, that wouldn’t do any good, because then he 
would know you talked to me about this and he would not 
like it, or he would just say what he thinks would make 
him look good.
As this conversation continues, many possible scenarios 
are proposed about why this behavior is occurring, and 
many hypotheses are raised about what could be done. The 
girls propose likely outcomes of each set of possible actions 
and attempt to evaluate the results of each. Finally, a tentative 
conclusion is reached: Boys treat girls differently when they 
are involved in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship than when 
they are not. In the just-friends situation, there is a tendency 
to treat the girl as an equal, but in the boyfriend-girlfriend 
situation, there is a tendency for the boy to expect that he 
should dominate the girl. A solution is derived: Cindy must 
shape up Sean. Because she still likes him and wants to go 
out with him, she must try to tell him how she feels and 
hope he will change his behavior so that it is supportive and 
comfortable for her.
The context of friendship between Cindy and Donna 
allows Cindy to trust discussing her problem with Donna 
so that they can examine it fully. It also allows Donna to 
disagree with Cindy without terminating the conversation. 
Thus, Cindy can get a somewhat different point of view on 

358 | 
CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
along which cognitive functioning matures in adolescence. 
Information processing, another aspect of cognitive sci-
ence, focuses on specifi c mechanisms for perceiving, encod-
ing, and retrieving bytes or units of information. Increases 
in speed, effi ciency, and capacity of information storage and 
retrieval have been documented during the period from ages 
11 to 16 (Kwon & Lawson, 2000). These capacities can be 
applied to hypothetical reasoning, but are not the same as 
formal operational thought. Improvements in logical rea-
soning may result in part from the ability to handle greater 
quantities of information more quickly and effi ciently.
In addition to development in basic processing, there are 
gains in knowledge, both as a result of schooling and experi-
ence. Knowledge in each specialized subject, such as math-
ematics, language, or science, expands, bringing not only 
increases in logic but increases in understanding the proce-
dures or strategies that are most likely to work for a given 
problem. Complementing changes in specialized knowl-
edge, adolescents demonstrate increases in self-monitoring 
and conscious control of mental activity, such as the ability 
to hold conclusions in abeyance while they examine alter-
native solutions or gather new information. These capacities 
for cognitive fl exibility contribute to the potential for more 
mature solutions (Donald, 2001).
Finally, some scholars claim that formal operational 
thought does not represent the apex or endpoint of adult 
thought and reasoning. As adults mature, they face many 
problems in which abstract, logical-mathematical reason-
ing must be integrated with the special emotional and social 
demands of the circumstances. The problem may need to be 
reframed to suit the situation. The solution may need to be 
evaluated for its impact on many interrelated parties. The 
cognitive processes associated with psychotherapy, diplo-
macy, and spiritual leadership are all examples of what might 
be considered postformal reasoning (Richards & Com-
mons, 1990; Torbert, 1994).
Egocentrism and Decentering
The term egocentrism refers to the child’s limited perspec-
tive at the beginning of each new phase of cognitive devel-
opment (Piaget, 1926; Inhelder & Piaget, 1958). In the 
sensorimotor phase, egocentrism appears as an inability to 
separate one’s actions from their effects on specifi c objects 
or people. As the scheme for causality is developed, the fi rst 
process of decentering occurs. Infants recognize that cer-
tain actions have predictable consequences and that novel 
situations call for new, relevant behaviors. For example, one 
cannot turn the light on by turning the knob on the radio. 
At each developmental stage, decentering allows the person 
to approach situations from a more objective, analytic point 
of view.
In the phase of preoperational thought, egocentrism is 
manifested in an inability to separate one’s own perspec-
tive from that of the listener. When a 4-year-old girl tells 
you about something that happened to her at the zoo, she 
may explain events as if you had seen them too. When a 
Although schooling can be a vehicle that promotes formal 
operational reasoning, not all school experiences are equally 
effective in promoting abstract, hypothetical reasoning. Keating 
(1990) described the following characteristics that are impor-
tant in creating a cognitively stimulating school experience.
Students need to be engaged with meaningful material; 
training of thinking skills must be embedded in a knowl-
edge of subject matter, for acquisition of isolated content 
knowledge is likely to be unproductive; serious engagement 
with real problems has to occur in depth and over time; 
students need experiences that lead to placing a high value 
on critical thinking, to acquiring it as a disposition, not just 
as a skill; and many of these factors occur most readily, and 
perhaps exclusively, when students have the opportunity for 
real, ongoing discourse with teachers who have reasonably 
expert command of the material to be taught. (p. 77)
One does not expect to see a mature scientist or a pro-
found philosopher by the end of early adolescence. A young 
person’s formal operational reasoning awaits further encoun-
ters with a specifi c discipline and its full range of signifi cant 
problems. However, the opportunity for cognitive growth 
during this period is extensive. Adolescents are able to gen-
erate novel solutions and apply them to current life chal-
lenges. They also are able to be increasingly objective about 
the problem-solving process and to gain insight into their 
own mental activity (Lee & Friere, 2003).
Criticisms of the Concept of Formal Operational 
Thought. In Piaget’s theory, formal operational reasoning is 
viewed as the fi nal stage in the development of logical thought. 
A number of scholars have pointed to limitations in this con-
struction. Three criticisms are discussed here. First, some 
scholars question whether there really is a qualitative, stage-
like consolidation in the use of formal reasoning. Although 
most researchers agree that formal operational thinking exists 
and does characterize the nature of mature, scientifi c reason-
ing, many studies show that adolescents and adults typically 
do not function at the formal operational level, and that their 
use of formal reasoning is inconsistent across problem areas 
(Bradmetz, 1999). For example, Neimark (1975) followed 
changes in the problem-solving strategies of adolescents 
over a 31/2-year period. Even the oldest participants in her 
study, who were 15, did not apply formal operational strate-
gies across all problems. Research has not been able to con-
fi rm Piaget’s claims that thinking becomes consistently more 
propositional across problem areas or that formal operational 
reasoning is a universal characteristic of adolescent reasoning 
in a variety of cultures. At the same time, the evidence does 
suggest that adolescents become more aware of the need to 
coordinate logic and evidence as they evaluate propositions 
(Keating, 2004). Even Piaget speculated that people were 
most likely to use formal operational reasoning primarily in 
the area of their greatest expertise.
A second criticism of formal operational reasoning is that 
it is not broad enough to encompass the many dimensions

important element in decentering, directing attention to oth-
ers and how you may be viewed in their eyes. Thus, self-
consciousness may stimulate cognitive perspective taking. 
On the other hand, an increased ability to consider the point 
of view of others and their expectations for your behavior 
may increase self-consciousness.
Egocentrism is a problem not only during the adolescent 
years. At each new phase of expanding awareness, people 
rely heavily on their own experiences and perceptions in 
order to minimize the anxiety associated with uncertainty. 
Part of the progress of formal thought implies a reliance on 
reason over experience, placing greater confi dence in what is 
known to be true than in what is seen or heard. This can lead 
to becoming confi ned to the world of one’s familiar beliefs. 
We may interpret new experiences as examples of familiar 
concepts rather than as novel events. We may reject evidence 
for an argument because it does not support an already care-
fully developed explanation. The business of casting around 
for new evidence and explanations is a lifelong challenge. It 
is much easier to rely on earlier assumptions than to con-
tinually question one’s perspective.
Emotional Development
Objective 4. To examine patterns of emotional 
development in early adolescence, including three 
examples of emotional disorders: eating disorders, 
delinquency, and depression.
Descriptions of adolescence often refer to new levels of emo-
tional variability, moodiness, and emotional outbursts. How-
ever, evidence suggests that this is also a time of increased 
emotional complexity, with new capacities to identify, 
understand, and express a wider range of emotions (Kang 
& Shaver, 2004). These capacities illustrate the close inter-
dependence of cognition and emotion, especially as reason-
ing about the consequences of expressing emotions may 
result in the control or management of emotional expres-
sion (Hoeksma, Oosterlaan, & Schipper, 2004). Given the 
likelihood of a more differentiated range of emotions dur-
ing adolescence, a major task during this time is to gain 
insight into one’s emotionality, and to expand one’s capacity 
for empathy with the emotional state of others (Weissberg & 
O’Brien, 2004). This means accepting one’s feelings and not 
interpreting them as a sign of going crazy or being strange. 
Adolescents who are highly sensitive to social expectations 
or overly controlled about expressing or accepting their 
feelings probably experience a sense of shame about their 
emotional states. Attempts to rigidly control or defend one-
self against feelings are likely to result in social alienation 
or maladaptive behaviors. In contrast, those who experience 
a diverse and well-differentiated range of emotions are also 
more likely to be characterized by greater openness to expe-
rience, empathy, and interpersonal adaptability (Kang & 
Shaver, 2004).
3-year-old boy is explaining something to his grandmother 
over the phone, he may point to objects in the room, unaware 
that his grandmother cannot see over the phone lines.
The third phase of heightened egocentrism occurs in the 
transition from concrete to formal operational thought. As 
children develop the capacity to formulate hypothetical sys-
tems, they begin to generate assumptions about their own 
and others’ behavior that will fit into these systems. For 
example, an early adolescent boy may insist that cooperation 
is a more desirable mode of interaction than competition. He 
argues that cooperation ought to benefi t each participant and 
provide more resources for the group as a whole. This boy 
may become angry or disillusioned to discover that teachers, 
parents, and even peers seek competitive experiences and 
appear to enjoy them. He may think, “If the cooperative sys-
tem is so superior, why do people persist in their illogical joy 
in triumphing over an opponent?” This kind of egocentrism 
refl ects an inability to recognize that others may not share 
one’s own hypothetical system.
In early adolescence, decentering requires an ability to 
realize that one’s ideals are not shared by all others. We live 
in a pluralistic society, in which each person is likely to have 
distinct goals and aspirations. Adolescents gradually discover 
that their neat, logical life plans must be constantly adapted 
to the expectations and needs of others. As they develop the 
fl exibility of thought that accompanies formal operational 
perspective taking, their egocentrism usually declines.
Early adolescent egocentrism has two characteristics that 
may affect adolescents’ social interactions as well as their 
problem solving: (1) preoccupation with their own thoughts, 
and (2) a belief that others are also preoccupied with their 
thoughts. First, adolescents may become withdrawn and 
isolated as the domain of their consciousness expands. 
Thoughts about the possible and the probable, the near and 
the distant future, and the logical extension of contemporary 
events to future consequences all fl ood their minds. David 
Elkind (1967) described one aspect of this process as the for-
mation of a personal fable—an intense investment in one’s 
own thoughts and feelings, and a belief that these thoughts 
are unique. Adolescents may conclude that they alone are 
having certain insights or diffi culties and that no one else 
could understand or sympathize with their thoughts. This 
tendency to withdraw into their own speculations may cut 
off access to new information or ideas and inhibit social 
interaction.
Second, early adolescents may assume that they are the 
center of interest of others’ thoughts and attentions. Elkind 
(1967) referred to this as an imaginary audience. Instead 
of considering that all people are equally wrapped up in 
their own concerns and plans, early adolescents may envi-
sion their own thoughts as being the focus of other people’s 
attention. This subjectivity generates an uncomfortable self-
consciousness that makes interaction awkward. There is 
some question about the outcome of this heightened self-
consciousness. On the one hand, a preoccupation with the 
idea that others are watching your every move may be an

CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
the likelihood of their exposure to risk since they have relatively 
little life experience upon which to base their assessment of 
risks. However, if the negative consequences rarely happen, or 
if they engage in these behaviors frequently, they are likely to 
conclude that the consequences are not as harmful as they were 
led to believe. What is more, the risks and rewards of certain 
behaviors are not the same for adolescents as they might be for 
adults. For example, the risk of being bullied, socially isolated, 
or embarrassed might be more serious for adolescents than for 
an adult. Imagine that a young person has to choose between 
calling his parents for a ride home from a party or getting a 
ride home from a friend who is intoxicated. While the parent 
may view the risk of riding with an intoxicated friend as a great 
risk, the adolescent may view the risk of being seen by peers as 
overly dependent upon his parents as the greater risk.
In contrast to the vertical control system, through which 
the frontal cortex exerts control over the limbic system, 
there is also a horizontal control system that plays a role in 
risk taking and responses to threat. This horizontal system 
refers to the fl ow of information between the right and left 
hemispheres of the brain. For right-handed children, the 
left hemisphere of the brain is the primary area involved in 
understanding spoken language, speech production, and 
the expression of positive emotions. The right hemisphere 
is involved in recognizing nonverbal expressions, processing 
positive and negative emotions, and expressing uncomfort-
able or negative emotions. The effective fl ow of information 
between the two hemispheres provides teens with the ability 
to use verbal skills to identify and regulate their emotional 
states. With maturity, adolescents are increasingly able to 
use language to gain greater control over their behavior and 
to explain their internal states to themselves and to others. 
Although executive control and verbal behavior are two sep-
arate cognitive capacities, they can work together to manage 
strong emotional states as well as to guide effective action. 
Given the state of their brain development, the challenge 
that adolescents face is how to use their maturing executive 
functions under conditions of intense emotional arousal in 
order to avoid unnecessary risk taking.
The Diversity of Emotions in Adolescence
Adolescents are more aware than younger children of gra-
dations in their emotional states and are able to attribute 
them to a wider range of causes. However, some researchers 
have questioned whether adolescence really brings the peaks 
and valleys of emotional intensity that are stereotypically 
linked to this time of life. In an attempt to assess this ques-
tion, researchers gave an electronic paging device to children 
and adolescents ages 9 to 15 and asked them to describe 
their emotional state every time they were paged (Larson & 
Lampman-Petraitis, 1989). Over 1 week, each participant 
responded about 37 times. The variability of emotions was 
not found to increase with age. However, both the boys and 
the girls in the older group expressed fewer extremely posi-
tive emotions and more mildly negative emotions than did 
The Interplay of Emotion and Cognition
A key feature of the human’s adaptive capacity is the abil-
ity to detect and respond quickly to situations that threaten 
our survival. Some areas of the brain, especially the limbic 
system, detect threats, react intuitively to information, and 
produce quick emotional reactions to situations. The limbic 
system produces signals that identify the immediate situa-
tion as threatening, or link the immediate situation to other 
previously experienced dangers. The sound of an explosion, 
being hit or threatened with violence, or the experience of 
being caught in a raging storm are all examples of situations 
that could trigger an immediate threat reaction in the limbic 
system. These reactions are referred to as bottom-up process-
ing. Other areas of the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex, 
are more analytic. Information from a variety of sources is 
evaluated, decisions are made, and a logical plan is formu-
lated. The frontal cortex receives information from the lim-
bic system, evaluates this information in light of the context, 
and makes an assessment of possible consequences of action. 
Information is then transmitted back to the limbic system 
to modify emotional signals and to the sensory-motor cortex 
to guide subsequent behavior. The frontal cortex control is 
referred to as top-down processing. The coordination of the 
limbic system and the frontal cortex is referred to as vertical 
control (Greenberg, Riggs, & Blair, 2007).
The vertical control system undergoes a process of matu-
ration that is usually not complete until the twenties. In ado-
lescence, there is evidence of some changes in the level of 
neurotransmitters in the limbic system. Adolescents are more 
emotional, more reactive to stressors, and less responsive to 
rewards than older adults. They need a more intense reward 
to have the same positive or pleasurable impact that might 
be experienced from a milder stimulus by an older person. 
At the same time, the frontal cortex and the myelination of 
neural pathways connecting the frontal cortex to the limbic 
system are not fully developed. The prefrontal cortex is the 
site of a variety of executive functions, some of which serve 
to manage strong emotions through monitoring one’s inter-
nal state, interpreting the emotions, and fi nding acceptable 
ways for expressing or, if needed, inhibiting the expression 
of emotions. Other executive functions are useful for plan-
ning a course of action, evaluating possible consequences, 
and adapting to changing circumstances as the situation 
requires. The combination of these aspects of brain devel-
opment may result in adolescents’ need for greater stimulus 
seeking and the willingness for more risk taking. With a less 
fully developed prefrontal cortex, adolescents may have diffi -
culty suppressing the immediate, emotional responses of the 
limbic system. At the same time, they may engage in more 
intensely stimulating activities, some of which adults would 
judge to be highly risky, in order to achieve the desired expe-
rience of pleasure or arousal.
Compared to adults, adolescents are nearly equally able to 
understand information about the negative consequences of 
risky behavior. In early adolescence, they may even overestimate

primarily but not exclusively among girls. Three eating disor-
ders have been described in the medical literature, but each 
one can be expressed in more severe or less severe patterns 
of symptoms (Liburd, 2006). Anorexia nervosa is character-
ized by a fear of gaining weight, refusal to maintain a mini-
mally normal body weight, and perceptions of one’s body as 
overweight in general or in specifi c areas (Herzog et al., 1999). 
Weight loss is viewed as an important accomplishment and is 
accompanied by increased self-esteem. Anorexia is found pri-
marily in girls, with symptoms beginning either shortly after 
the weight spurt that accompanies puberty or at about age 18. 
Adolescents with this condition focus their behavior on weight 
loss. They take an obsessive, determined position in reject-
ing most foods, accompanied by dieting, fasting, or excessive 
exercise. They also tend to have a distorted perception of their 
body image, seeing themselves as much fatter than they really 
are. Only about half the patients who are treated for anorexia 
recover completely. A potentially life-threatening consequence 
is extreme starvation (Liburd, 2006).
Bulimia involves spurts of binging and overeating, fol-
lowed by the use of different strategies to prevent the absorp-
tion of food, such as induced vomiting, the use of laxatives, 
or strenuous exercise. Bulimia has an incidence of between 
1% and 3% in the female adolescent population and is expe-
rienced somewhat more commonly by male adolescents 
than is anorexia. Individuals who suffer from bulimia are 
usually ashamed of their eating and often eat in secret. Their 
eating is often experienced as a frenzy or an intense loss of 
control, followed by self-criticism and depression (Moreno 
& Judd, 2006).
The origins of eating disorders are not fully understood. 
Many authors implicate the cultural infatuation with thinness 
as a stimulus of this condition. Support for this view comes 
from evidence that anorexia and bulimia are almost nonexis-
tent in nonindustrialized countries where there are often food 
shortages and where thinness is not a cultural ideal. A com-
bination of parent, peer, and media idealization of thinness, 
coupled with a tendency for girls to experience body dissatis-
faction during puberty, leads teens to restrict their food intake 
and engage in faddish diets (Dunkley, Wertheim, & Paxton, 
2001; McCabe & Ricciardelli, 2001; Stice & Shaw, 2004).
Evie tells me that she learned how to throw up in school, 
in fact in health class, from a one-day lesson designed to 
discourage eating disorders. . . . Evie says she vomited after 
dinner three to fi ve times a week off and on for almost a 
year. She didn’t do it over the summer, she says, just when 
school was in session; and never during lunch—only after 
dinner, especially when her mother’s boyfriend, a frequent 
guest at the table, urged her on to extra helpings of Tater 
Tots or dessert. On those nights, she’d wait until the dishes 
were done, then, a little while later, she’d mosey into the 
kitchen and pilfer a spoon. (Orenstein, 2000, p. 91)
A preoccupation with body appearance may be provoked 
by the relatively rapid physical changes associated with 
the children in the younger group. In a subsequent study 
using similar methods, daily emotions were monitored in 
relation to children’s pubertal status (Richards & Larson, 
1993). Boys and girls with a more mature body shape at each 
age reported more frequent thoughts and feelings about love. 
Pubertal development was slightly related to heightened feel-
ings of anger in girls, but in general, physical maturation was 
not closely linked to patterns of specifi c emotions in girls. In 
boys, the relationships between pubertal development and 
emotions were much stronger. Those boys who were more 
physically mature reported more experiences of feeling frus-
trated, tense, and hyper. They also reported a more positive 
mood, a greater ability to focus their attention, and more feel-
ings of strength. Thus, in boys, pubertal changes were associ-
ated with both positive moods and a restless irritability.
After puberty, boys and girls show noticeably different 
levels of aggression and depression, with girls showing more 
problems coping with depression and boys showing more 
problems managing and controlling their aggressive impulses 
(Leadbeater, Kuperminc, Blatt, & Hertzog, 1999). These 
differences are often expressed in terms of internalizing 
problems, such as feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness, 
in which the adolescent’s conflicts are directed inward on 
the self; and externalizing problems, sometimes referred to 
as conduct problems, such as aggression or delinquency, in 
which the adolescent’s confl icts are directed outward toward 
property or other people (Achenbach, 1991). Three topics 
are discussed below, two of which are considered examples of 
internalizing problems—eating disorders and depression—
and one that is considered an example of an externalizing 
problem, delinquency.
Eating Disorders
Eating disorders are an example of internalizing problems—
turning one’s frustration, anger, or fear inward on the self. 
Eating disorders are typically diagnosed in adolescence, and 
Sporting events provide settings where adolescents can express 
their exuberant and wild emotions, including joy, pride, and anger.

CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
products to children and adolescents and to disclose more 
accurately the amount of weight that can be lost. Physicians 
are being encouraged to rely less on height-weight tables as 
they discuss health with adolescents, because those tables do 
not take into account body type and the range of individual 
differences in healthy weight (DeAngelis, 1997a). The Acad-
emy for Eating Disorders has tried to encourage the fashion 
industry to support the health of models by setting minimal 
body mass index (BMI) guidelines for models. They oppose 
the trend of presenting design collections on extremely thin 
models. The Council of Fashion Designers of America has 
resisted endorsing specifi c weight and height requirements, 
arguing that fashions change as standards of beauty change 
(Wilson, 2007).
Depression
There is growing concern about the number of adolescents 
who experience depression (Graber, 2004). Depression is 
used in at least three different contexts: depressed mood, 
depressive syndrome, and a depressive disorder (Petersen 
et al., 1993). Depressed mood refers to feeling sad or despon-
dent, a loss of hope, a sense of being overwhelmed by the 
demands of the world, and general unhappiness. Almost 
everyone experiences this kind of depression at some time 
or another, describing it as the blues, feeling down in the 
dumps, or feeling low. Related symptoms include worry-
ing, moodiness, crying, loss of appetite, diffi culty sleeping, 
tiredness, loss of interest in or enjoyment of activities, and 
diffi culty concentrating. Depression may range from mild, 
short-lived periods of feeling sad and discouraged to severe 
feelings of guilt and worthlessness. A depressed mood may 
be predictive of more serious emotional disorders, but it 
is not in itself a clinical diagnosis. Depression appears to 
increase for both boys and girls during adolescence, with a 
peak at about ages 17 or 18 (Petersen et al., 1993). One esti-
mate is that about 35% of adolescents—a higher percentage 
for girls than for boys—have experienced a depressed mood 
in the previous 6 months.
The second use of the concept of depression is the notion 
of a depressive syndrome. This term refers to a constellation of 
behaviors and emotions that occur together. The syndrome 
usually includes complaints about feeling depressed, anx-
ious, fearful, worried, guilty, and worthless. Roughly 5% of 
the normal population experiences this syndrome.
The third use of the concept of depression is its central 
role in clinical diagnosis. For a diagnosis of major depressive 
disorder, the adolescent must have experienced fi ve or more 
of the following symptoms for at least 2 weeks: “Depressed 
mood or irritable mood most of the day; decreased interest 
in pleasurable activities; changes in weight or perhaps failure 
to make necessary weight gains in adolescence; sleep prob-
lems; psychomotor agitation or retardation; fatigue or loss 
of energy; feelings of worthlessness or abnormal amounts 
of guilt; reduced concentration and decision-making ability; 
and repeated suicidal ideation, attempts, or plans of suicide” 
(Petersen et al., 1993, p. 156).
puberty. The psychoanalytic view is that eating disorders link 
back to fear of sexual maturity and are an unconscious strat-
egy to delay entry into adulthood. The family system per-
spective emphasizes the parents’ control or overcontrol of 
their child’s actions and preferences. Eating disorders, in this 
view, are a way for a child to exert control or power over one 
key area, eating, in a context where little power is permit-
ted. In addition to these theories, some clinicians describe 
the adolescents who suffer from anorexia as having diffi culty 
accepting and expressing their emotions. Compared with 
adolescents who have other types of emotional disorders, 
adolescents with anorexia show less emotional expressivity, 
greater timidity, and more submissiveness. Adolescents with 
anorexia have been described as “duty bound, rigidly disci-
plined, and moralistic with underlying doubts and anxious 
hesitancy” (Strober, 1981, pp. 289–290).
Recent investigations have implicated certain genetic fac-
tors as associated with eating disorders. Twin studies pro-
vide evidence of a hereditary component to eating disorders. 
Three groups of genes have been shown to be associated with 
eating disorders, especially through their role in emotional 
regulation, anxiety, and appetite suppression and weight 
gain or loss. The fi rst group of genes infl uences the receptors 
and transporters of serotonin, which functions in the brain 
to control appetite, mood, sleep, memory, and learning. The 
second group of genes is related to brain-derived neuro-
trophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports the growth 
of neurons in the brain. BDNF is also associated with appe-
tite and weight gain or loss. Finally, genes associated with 
estrogen receptors have been tied to food intake as well as to 
depression and anxiety (Klump & Culbert, 2007). The exact 
role of each gene group in contributing to eating disorders 
or the severity of symptoms is not known. One hypothesis is 
that a few genes make the person vulnerable to eating disor-
ders when they are exposed to certain environmental condi-
tions. For example, girls who are engaged in specifi c types 
of activities such as ballet, gymnastics, or modeling, where 
weight is very important and where they are likely to be 
exposed to the stresses of competition and control, may be 
especially likely to develop eating disorders if they also have 
the genetic vulnerability that supports this condition.
Studies of long-term outcomes following the diagnosis of 
anorexia fi nd that appropriate treatment can restore normal 
body weight. However, a large number of young people who 
suffered from anorexia as adolescents continue to have social 
and emotional diffi culties, especially problems in empathy, 
diffi culty recognizing and identifying their emotions, obses-
sive-compulsive disorders, and anxiety (Herpertz-Dahlmann, 
Wewetzer, Hennighausen, & Remschmidt, 1996; Hsu, 
1996). Over a 10-year period, an estimated 5.6% of people 
with anorexia die from the disorder (DeAngelis, 1997a).
Because of the seriousness and widespread nature of eat-
ing disorders, public health experts are working to create a 
more positive acceptance of people of various body types 
and shapes, with less focus on thinness. Advertisers are being 
urged to regulate ads promoting weight loss programs and

with heightened marital conflict, increased hostility, and 
less nurturance toward the children, resulting in subse-
quent adjustment problems in adolescent daughters, espe-
cially problems with hostility and depression (Conger et al., 
1993; Tomarken, Dichter, Garber, & Simien, 2004). Even 
though scholars no longer view adolescence as a unique 
period of emotional turmoil, they recognize that adolescents 
are often exposed to more negative events than are younger 
children. Adolescents are more aware of what other people 
are experiencing, and because more is expected of them, 
there is more to worry about. School is more demanding, 
and there are more instances of high-stakes testing; selection 
or rejection in teams, clubs, and activities; and new perfor-
mance standards (Locker & Cropley, 2004). Teens have a 
wider circle of relationships than younger children, through 
which they are exposed to more problems, expectations, and 
disappointments.
Adolescents report experiencing hassles in the following 
domains: social alienation (disagreements with teachers, dis-
liking other students); excessive demands (not enough time 
to meet responsibilities, not enough time for sleep); romantic 
concerns (dissatisfaction in a romantic relationship); deci-
sions about one’s personal future (important decisions about 
a future career); loneliness and unpopularity (being ignored); 
assorted annoyances and concerns (money problems, dis-
agreement with a boyfriend or girlfriend); social mistreat-
ment (being taken advantage of, having one’s trust betrayed); 
and academic challenge (struggling to meet other people’s 
standards of performance at school; Kohn & Milrose, 1993). 
In this list, peer relations, including romantic relations and 
the elements of interpersonal experience that are part of 
being a member of a friendship group, play a central role.
Depression is linked to experiencing negative peer com-
parisons in areas that are considered to be important to oth-
ers, such as good looks, athletic ability, having money, or 
having good social skills (Thwaites & Dagnan, 2004). Prob-
lems with peer relations can be a source of stress that triggers 
depression. At the same time, depression can lead to disrup-
tions in peer relationships. Adolescents who are depressed 
may make more negative meaning of social interactions, 
feel more dependent on others to confirm their sense of 
self-worth, and have less energy or emotional resources for 
coping with experiences of rejection. Whereas having close 
friends who are not depressed may be a protective factor 
against depression, having friends who are depressed may 
actually induce a depressed mood. Depressed teens may 
ruminate about their problems, focus largely on negative 
experiences, experience more confl icts with each other, and 
generally convey dissatisfaction in their relationships (Brend-
gen, Lamarche, Wanner, & Vitaro, 2010). There is some evi-
dence that girls who are depressed at age 15 are more likely 
to enter long-term romantic relationships with partners who 
are coercive, nonsupportive, and physically violent (Ham-
men, 2009). The implication is that depression plays a role 
in continuing to be exposed to stressful interpersonal rela-
tionships that, in turn, create new sources of depression.
Factors Associated with Adolescent Depression. 
Adolescents face a number of challenges that make them 
vulnerable to depression. At present, no single theory is 
accepted as the explanation for depression. Some research 
points to genetic factors associated with the clinical diagno-
sis of depression. Neuroimaging of the brains of individuals 
with major depressive disorder has identifi ed an area of the 
prefrontal cortex that is reduced in size and shows reduced 
functional links with the amygdala, a region of the brain that 
is associated with the regulation of emotions. This observa-
tion of a disruption in the link between a higher-order sys-
tem that evaluates information, and a lower-order system that 
recognizes and reacts to threat coincides well with the symp-
toms of major depressive disorder that combines cognitive 
defi cits and diffi culties in emotion regulation (Insel, 2007).
Recalling the research on the interaction between 
depressed mothers and their infants discussed in Chapter 
5 (Infancy), it is hard to separate genetic and environmen-
tal factors in the etiology of clinical depression. Having a 
depressed mother increases the risk of depression during 
adolescence. Teens whose mothers are depressed are charac-
terized by more anxious attachments, more suicidal thoughts, 
and more frequent episodes of depression than teens whose 
mothers are not depressed (Essau, 2004). The direction of 
infl uence between brain and behavior is diffi cult to establish. 
Are some children more vulnerable to the negative impact 
of disrupted parenting because of some genetic neurologi-
cal abnormality, or does the disrupted parenting produce 
a change in emotional regulation that eventually results in 
structural and functional abnormalities in the brain?
Parental loss or rejection has been found to increase 
an adolescent’s vulnerability to depression (Robertson & 
Simons, 1989). In one longitudinal study of the conse-
quences of economic pressures on families, a connection 
was shown between the family’s economic stresses and 
increased parental depression. Economic strain is associated 
Ironically, the fact that girls are likely to try to comfort and sup-
port their friends during periods of emotional turmoil makes 
them more vulnerable to negative moods and depression. How 
might adolescent girls protect themselves from this negative 
consequence of close friendships?

teachers, male peers, and even their parents. These negative 
messages create a picture of a world in which the adolescent 
girl is viewed as less important, less competent, and less enti-
tled to her own independent views than her male peers. The 
result is increased feelings of insecurity, lack of confi dence, 
and new feelings of worthlessness.
Depressed mood is of special concern during early ado-
lescence for several reasons. First, it is associated with ado-
lescent suicide. (For further discussion of adolescent suicide, 
see the Applying Theory and Research to Life box.) Although 
depression is not always a precursor to suicide, there is a link 
between depression and suicidal thoughts. Second, depres-
sion is linked to alcohol and drug abuse. Adolescents who 
are struggling with strong feelings of depression may turn 
to alcohol or other drugs to try to alleviate or escape from 
these feelings. Third, adolescents who are depressed may be 
unable to participate effectively in the classroom, so their 
academic performance deteriorates. Finally, depression dur-
ing adolescence may be a forerunner of severe depression 
later in adulthood.
Delinquency
Delinquency is an example of externalizing problems, related 
to difficulties in controlling or regulating one’s impulses. 
Delinquent offenses are actions for which an adult could be 
prosecuted. Then there are offenses such as truancy, running 
away, or underage drinking that are known as status offenses, 
which are illegal for adolescents. Many adolescents commit 
some type of delinquent act that goes undetected. For most 
young people, the fear and guilt that follow a delinquent act 
are usually enough punishment to prevent further violations.
Adolescents are relatively inexperienced in coping with 
these kinds of stressors. They may not have developed 
strategies for interrupting or reducing the feelings of grief 
or discouragement that accompany stressful life events. 
The combination of pressures on parents, especially mari-
tal confl icts and economic pressures that affect youth, plus 
exposure to their own failures, disappointments, and loss of 
relationships with peers and in school, are clearly linked to a 
negative mood in adolescents, especially sadness and depres-
sion (Larson & Ham, 1993). Feelings of depression may be 
intensifi ed by accompanying hormonal changes (Hartlage, 
Brandenburg, & Kravitz, 2004). Young people may become 
convinced of their worthlessness, and this distortion of 
thought may lead them toward social withdrawal or self-
destructive actions.
Gender Difference in Depression. Most studies fi nd 
no differences in depression between prepubescent boys and 
girls; however, during the period from about age 11 to 15, 
gender differences are systematically noted and continue to 
be evident into adulthood (Jones-Webb & Snowden, 1993; 
Crawford, Cohen, Midlarsky, & Brook, 2001). Experiences 
of depression appear to be more common in adolescent girls 
than in boys. This gender difference has been found in com-
parisons of the depression scores of European American, 
African American, Mexican American, and other Hispanic 
American adolescents (Roberts & Sobhan, 1992).
Several ideas have been offered to explain this gender 
difference (Nolen-Hoeksema & Girgus, 1994; Murakumi, 
2002). First, the estrogen cycle has been linked to changes 
in mood, with periods of low estrogen production linked to 
negative feelings and low self-esteem. Second, at puberty, 
girls become critical of their bodies and especially have con-
cerns about being overweight and unattractive. This attitude 
may lead to prolonged feelings of dissatisfaction with the self 
and a consequent depression. When coupled with restricted 
dietary intake, girls may feel listless and drained of energy. 
Third, girls tend to look within for explanations of their fail-
ures and problems, blaming them on their own lack of abil-
ity; in contrast, boys tend to focus on factors outside the self, 
blaming other people or unfair conditions for their failures.
Fourth, even when girls receive strong social support 
from their parents and friends, they are also somewhat more 
sensitive to the problems that people in their support net-
work are having. Girls who have higher levels of caring and 
are involved in the problems of their close friends are more 
vulnerable to depression (Gore, Aseltine, & Colten, 1993). 
Any negative experiences that a girl’s best friend or members 
of her family are going through tend to add to her own nega-
tive mood. For example, one study found a signifi cant link 
between mothers’ emotional distress and their daughters’ 
internalizing symptoms over the period from age 11 to 22. 
The same association was not found for adolescent boys and 
their mothers (Crawford et al., 2001).
Finally, adolescent girls may begin to experience numer-
ous micro-aggressions spawned by the sexist views of 
Delinquency, especially acts against property or other people, is 
an expression of externalizing behavior. At his sentencing hear-
ing, Trevor apologizes to the court and to the victim’s family for 
his assault on a fi ve- year-old girl.

Adolescent Suicide
I thought how easily you could kill yourself 
when you were drunk. Take a bath, fall 
asleep, drown. No turtle would come 
ﬂ oating by to rescue you, no spotter plane 
would ﬁ nd you. I took my mother’s knife and 
played johnny johnny johnny on the play-
house ﬂ oor. I was drunk, stabbed myself ev-
ery few throws. I held my hand up and there 
was satisfaction at seeing my blood, the 
way there was when I saw the red gouges 
on my face that people stared at and turned 
away. (Fitch, 1999, pp. 184–185)
SUICIDE AT ANY age is deeply 
troubling, but adolescent suicide is 
cause for special anguish and soul 
searching. Why would a young person, 
with all of life ahead with its endless 
possibilities and opportunities, choose 
death? Is it possible that the prospect of 
becoming an adult is so threatening and 
terrifying that some young people would 
rather die than grow up?
Public concern over adolescent 
suicide has been increasing in response 
to the rise in the suicide rate among 
adolescents since the early 1960s. Suicide, 
which is the third leading cause of death 
among adolescents ages 15 to 24, rose 
from 5.2 per 100,000 in 1960 to 13.3 per 
100,000 in 1995. By 2006, the rate had 
declined to 9.9 per 100,000. In that age 
group, there were approximately 4,000 
suicides—one death by suicide every 
2 hours and 15 minutes (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2010). Some claim that these 
suicide rates are underestimated, as 
there is a social stigma to reporting a 
death as suicide, and there are fi nancial 
consequences to identifying a death as 
a suicide rather than as an accident. It is 
suspected that a signifi cant number of 
adolescent deaths involving automobile 
accidents were actually suicides. According 
to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance 
System reports (2010), 14% of high school 
students had seriously considered suicide 
in the preceding 12 months, and 6.3% 
attempted suicide in the preceding 12 
months. Girls are twice as likely as boys 
to attempt suicide, but boys are 5 to 6 
times as likely as girls to die in a suicide 
attempt (Irwin, Burg, & Cart, 2002). The 
rate of adolescent suicide differs by racial 
and ethnic groups. The risk of suicide 
death is substantially higher among 
American Indian and Alaskan Natives, 
especially the boys, than among other 
racial/ethnic groups. Suicide attempts 
are highest among American Indian 
and Alaskan Native girls. Differences in 
rates of suicide and suicide attempts 
across racial and ethnic groups suggest 
different risk and protective factors tied 
to culture, acculturation strains, exposure 
to stresses of poverty and community 
disorganization, the stigma of discussing 
mental health problems, and the strength 
of ties to a supportive community 
(Goldston, Molock, Whitbeck, Murakami, 
Zayas, & Hall, 2008).
Instances of suicides prompted 
by widely publicized suicides, copycat 
suicides, and clusters of friends who 
commit suicide as part of a pact suggest 
that suicidal ideation can be triggered 
by a variety of external events as well as 
by internal depression or as a reaction 
to humiliation or loss. In attempting 
to understand the causes of suicide, 
primary risk factors have been identifi ed 
(Garland & Zigler, 1993; King et al., 2001; 
Russell & Joyner, 2001). These factors 
were reconstructed by studying the 
lives of adolescents who committed or 
attempted suicide. However, they may 
not be very useful in predicting whether 
a particular individual will commit or 
attempt suicide. Although depression 
and low self-esteem are often included in 
the profi le of those who attempt suicide, 
they are usually coupled with other 
issues. The risk factors include:
 
■
Drug and alcohol abuse
 
■
Mood disorders, especially depression
 
■
A prior suicide attempt
 
■
A history of psychiatric illness
 
■
 A history of antisocial, aggressive 
behavior
 
■
A family history of suicidal behavior
 
■
Low parental monitoring
 
■
A high number of stressful life events
 
■
A minority sexual orientation
 
■
The availability of a fi rearm
In addition to these factors, there 
is usually some precipitating event. A 
shameful or humiliating experience, a 
notable failure, and rejection by a parent 
or a romantic partner are all examples. 
Use of drugs that alter cognitive 
functioning and decrease inhibitions, 
coupled with easy access to a gun, 
suggest one likely path from suicidal 
ideation to suicidal action.
The national Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA, 2001) has issued a 
monograph, the National Strategy 
for Suicide Prevention: Goals and 
Objectives for Action. A key premise of 
this monograph is that suicide is a public 
health problem that is preventable. 
Two action components of prevention 
include broadening community 
support for mental health education 
and reducing the stigma associated 
with seeking mental health services. 
A study of the impact of the Signs of 
Suicide (SOS) program in 92 schools 
demonstrated the potential impact of 
effective intervention. Students who 
participated in the program showed an 
increase in help seeking of 60% in the 
month following the introduction of the 
curriculum. School coordinators found 
no negative reactions among students 
who were exposed to information 
about suicide and suicide prevention, 
and some improvement in student and 
teacher communication following this 
intervention (Aseltine, 2003). To learn 
more about suicide prevention, visit the 
website of the American Foundation for 
Suicide Prevention, or the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration of the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Why might the number of reported 
suicides be an underestimate?
 2. How do you account for the fact 
that girls are more likely than boys 
to attempt suicide, but that boys are 
much more likely than girls to die as 
a result of their attempts?
 3. Imagine that someone you knew well 
started talking to you about different 
ways people might kill themselves 
and then you read an essay he wrote 
for class about teen funerals. What 
would you do?
 4. Why might people resist the imple-
mentation of an SOS program in 
their schools? What resources should 
schools and communities have avail-
able for teens and their families if 
they do implement such a program?
APPLYING THEORY AND RESEARCH TO LIFE

CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
seventh and eighth graders, 22% of European American 
teens, 30% of Hispanic American teens, and 39% of Afri-
can American teens responded that they had some type of 
involvement (Blum et al., 2000). Because many young peo-
ple carry some type of weapon with them—especially knives 
and guns—questions are raised about the emotional corre-
lates of this type of behavior.
Are children who carry weapons primarily preoccupied 
with fear and motivated by self-defense, or are the weap-
ons an extension of their aggressive motives? In one analy-
sis, teens who carried guns were found to differ from those 
who carried knives (Webster, Gainer, & Champion, 1993). 
For girls, the more people they knew who had been victims 
of violence, the more likely they were to carry a knife. For 
boys, the two strong predictors of carrying a knife were hav-
ing been threatened with a knife and having been frequently 
involved in fights, although not usually as the one who 
started them. Carrying a knife is linked to self-protective 
motives.
Too few girls carried guns for the researchers to identify 
predictors for that group. For the boys, however, the corre-
lates of carrying a gun included having been arrested before, 
having been involved in many fi ghts and being one of the 
people who started them, and believing that shooting people 
was justifi able in certain circumstances. Gun carrying was 
linked to a much more violent, aggressive orientation, and 
could not really be construed as a strategy for self-protection. 
Subsequent studies support the picture of boys who carry 
guns as being motivated by the desire to gain respect or to 
In an examination of a 10-year arrest trend, from 1996 
to 2005, the number of males under the age of 18 who were 
arrested decreased by 28.7% and the number of females 
under the age of 18 who were arrested decreased by 14.3%. 
Overall, in the 10-year period, juvenile arrests for violent 
crime decreased by 25% (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
2005).
In a longitudinal study of more than 4,500 high school 
seniors and high school dropouts in California and Oregon, 
more than half the sample reported being involved in violent 
behavior—65% of the boys and 41% of the girls. A subset of 
these youth, the repeat offenders, were persistently involved 
in violent acts and were also signifi cantly more likely to be 
involved in other high-risk delinquent behaviors such as 
selling drugs, committing felonies, and using alcohol, mari-
juana, or other drugs. These extremely violent youths were 
also more likely to drop out of school and to have other 
mental health problems. The fi ndings of this study suggest 
that efforts to curb youth violence must pursue a differenti-
ated approach—creating programs that are appropriate for 
the large number of youth who engage in an isolated act of 
violence, and other interventions focusing on the serious 
offenders who have multiple problems and are likely to be 
involved in both aggressive behavior and antisocial delin-
quency (Ellickson, Saner, & McGuigan, 1997).
Weapon carrying has increased dramatically over the past 
20 years. As part of the National Longitudinal Study of Ado-
lescent Health, students in grades 7 through 12 were asked 
about their involvement in weapon-related violence. Among 
In an effort to protect

detectors or security guards

and some negative conse-
quences of this kind of

connote a certain closeness among the members. They hang 
out together, know about each other’s families, plan activi-
ties together, and stay in touch with each other from day to 
day. Within cliques, intimate information is exchanged and, 
therefore, a high degree of loyalty is expected. In the transi-
tion from middle school or junior high school to the larger, 
more heterogeneous environment of the high school, there is 
a reordering of students according to a variety of abilities and 
a corresponding reordering of friendship groups. It may take 
some time for adolescents to fi nd their clique, the members of 
which may change from time to time over the fi rst year or two 
of high school. There is quite a lot of variability in the stability 
of the cliques; some dissolve over the course of a school year, 
and others remain intact throughout high school.
Crowd refers to a large group that is usually recognized by 
a few predominant characteristics, such as their orientation 
toward academics, involvement in athletics, use of drugs, or 
involvement in deviant behavior. Crowds are more reputa-
tional than cliques, refl ecting students’ values and attitudes, 
preferred activities, and school and nonschool engagement. 
Students can typically name the crowds at their school, but 
when asked, not all students clearly fi t with a specifi c crowd, 
and some students are in more than one.
Membership in a crowd at the high school may be based 
on one or more of the following characteristics: good looks; 
athletic ability; social class; academic performance; future 
goals; affiliation with a religious, racial, or ethnic group; 
special talents; involvement with drugs or deviant behav-
ior; or general alienation from school. Although the crite-
ria for group membership may not be publicly articulated, 
the groups tend to include or exclude members according 
to consistent standards. In a racially diverse sample of more 
than 600 middle school and high school students, some of 
the most common crowds mentioned were fl oaters (belong-
ing to more than one group), nice or regulars, populars, 
middles (related to income), jocks, nerds/unpopulars, preps, 
skateboarders, and misfi ts/alternatives. Roughly 20% of the 
students said they did not belong to any group (Lohman, 
2000).
In racially and ethnically diverse schools, it is not uncom-
mon for students to identify crowds based specifi cally on eth-
nic categories, such as the Asian American group, the Mexican 
Americans, and the African Americans. Given the language 
diversity of some communities, adolescents may be drawn to 
peers who have a common home language. Banding together 
with other students who speak one’s native language can pro-
vide a buffer from the direct or inadvertent stigma of limited 
English proficiency in a predominantly English-speaking 
school (Hill & Torres, 2010).
Crowds can be identified in a school setting by their 
dress, their language, the activities in which they participate, 
and the school settings in which they are most likely to con-
gregate. For example, in one school, the peer groups take 
their names from the place in the school where they hang 
out: “the fashionable ‘wall people’ who favor a bench along 
the wall outside the cafeteria, and the punkish ‘trophy-case’ 
frighten others. These boys are likely to be bullies, whose 
friends also engage in high-risk activities.
Recall from the discussion in Chapter 8 that chronic 
exposure to violence has a disruptive impact on neurological 
development. Youth who are exposed to violence experience 
higher levels of symptoms associated with post-traumatic 
stress disorder, including diffi culties regulating emotional 
reactions, diffi culties concentrating, and diffi culties inhibit-
ing aggressive impulses. Exposure to violence also increases 
aggressive cognitions and the attribution of aggressive 
motives to others while, at the same time, lowering one’s sen-
sitivity to the pain and suffering of others. Some authors sug-
gest that many boys who commit violent crimes are suffering 
from a form of post-traumatic stress disorder that leaves 
them angry, disconnected from their feelings, and unable to 
anticipate or control overwhelming images of violence that 
surge up with minimal provocation (Cunningham, Heng-
geler, Limber, Melton, & Nation, 2000; Slovak & Singer, 
2001; Allwood, 2007).
Membership in the Peer Group
Objective 5. To describe the further evolution of peer 
relations in early adolescence, especially the formation 
of cliques and crowds, and to contrast the impact of 
parents and peers during this stage.
The importance of peer interaction for psychosocial devel-
opment is a continuous theme across the life span. During 
early adolescence, the peer group becomes more structured 
and organized than it was previously (Newman, 1982). The 
implications of the individual’s relation to the peer group 
become more clearly defi ned. Before the adolescent period, 
it is important to have friends but not so important to be a 
member of a defi nable group. The child’s friends are often 
found in the neighborhood, local clubs and sports teams, 
community centers, or classrooms. In early adolescence, 
young people spend more time away from home. In middle 
school and high school, students are more likely to interact 
with each other across classroom boundaries, leading to the 
formation of larger, more loosely affi liated friendship groups. 
Dyadic friendships become an increasingly important 
source of social support, and the quality of these friendships 
changes. In addition to dyadic friendships, adolescents form 
small groups of friends, sometimes referred to as cliques, and 
in most communities they also become identified with a 
larger constellation of teens who have a common social iden-
tity, usually referred to as a crowd (Brown, 2004).
Cliques and Crowds
Cliques are small friendship groups of 5 to 10 friends (Ennett 
& Bauman, 1996). Usually, these groups provide the frame-
work for frequent interactions both within the school and 
in the neighborhood. Adolescents usually do not refer to 
their group of friends as a clique, but the term is used to 

368 | 
CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
for one reason or another are never fully included (Hansell, 
1985). Some students try to push their way into a certain 
group; others may fall out of a group. Dating someone who is 
a member of a clique or getting involved in a school activity 
(such as athletics or cheerleading) may be a way of moving 
into a new peer group. A more likely scenario is that through 
gossip, refusal to adhere to group norms, or failure in hetero-
sexual relationships, individuals may slip outside the bound-
aries of their clique. Even when the specifi c members of a 
clique change, new members tend to have some common 
characteristics. Cliques of druggies fi nd new friends who do 
drugs; cliques of jocks fi nd new friends who excel in sports.
Changing one’s crowd identity may be more difficult 
than changing from one clique to another. When the school 
population is relatively stable, it is more diffi cult to lose the 
reputational identity one has already established. In some 
schools, specifi c crowds have strong animosity toward each 
other. Members of the opposing crowds may occupy dif-
ferent areas of the school, participate in different activities, 
mock or ridicule each other, or articulate their differences in 
symbolic ways through dress, art, and music. When these 
differences are widely known, it becomes even more diffi cult 
to shift crowd identities. More research is needed about the 
contexts that permit changes in crowd membership and the 
motives that students might have for wanting a new crowd 
affi liation (Brown, 2004).
Important skills that are learned by becoming a member 
of a peer group are the assessment of group structure and the 
selection of the particular group or groups with which one 
would like to affi liate. As one begins to develop a focused 
peer group affiliation, one becomes aware of that group’s 
internal structure and norms. In adolescence, the structure 
may include patterns of dominance, dating, and relation-
ships with others outside the group. Associated with each 
of these dimensions of social structure are sets of norms or 
expectations for the behavior of the peer group members. As 
adolescents discover their positions in the dominance hier-
archy of the group, they learn how they may advance within 
kids who sit on the fl oor under a display of memorabilia” 
(Adler, 1999, p. 57). The peer culture in any high school 
is determined largely by the nature of the peer groups that 
exist and their characteristic patterns of interaction (Youniss, 
McLellan, & Strouse, 1994). These large, visible groups pro-
vide an array of prototypical identities. Although many ado-
lescents resist being labeled as part of one crowd or another, 
they usually recognize that these categories of students exist 
in their school.
In one analysis of more than 3,000 students in grades 9 
to 12 in nine different high schools, nine crowd types were 
identifi ed with a high degree of regularity across the schools. 
The crowds were labeled by the students as jocks, populars, 
popular nice, average-normal, brains, partyers, druggies, lon-
ers, and nerds (Durbin, Darling, Steinberg, & Brown, 1993). 
These crowds had distinct profi les with respect to their school 
grades, use of alcohol and drugs, involvement in delinquent 
acts, involvement in fi ghts and carrying weapons to school, 
and perceptions of how involved they were in the social life at 
the school. Thus, the youth culture, as it is sometimes called, 
actually comprises a number of subcultures, each endors-
ing somewhat different attitudes toward adults and other 
authority figures, school and academic goals, and drugs 
and deviant behavior, and expressing different orientations 
toward partying and social life (Brown, Mounts, Lamborn, & 
Steinberg, 1993).
The relationship of crowd affi liation to behavior and espe-
cially behavior problems has been established in research in 
the United States and Australia (Prinstein & LaGreca, 2002). 
In an effort to expand this picture to adolescents in Europe, 
researchers carried out a study of crowd affiliation in the 
Netherlands (Delsing, ter Bogt, Engles, & Meeus, 2007). The 
sample included over 2,000 adolescents ages 12 to 19 from 
12 schools who self-identifi ed as Dutch, Antillean, Moroc-
can, and Turkish. Adolescents were asked to rate how much 
they identified as a member of one of 10 crowds: punks, 
metal heads, Gothics, rural youth, Christian youth, normals, 
hip-hoppers, Rastas, elites, and brains. They also completed 
measures of aggression, delinquency, anxiety, and depres-
sion. The crowds could be differentiated on the basis of four 
dimensions—namely, their orientation toward: conventional 
or adult values, achievement and fi nancial independence, 
urban youth culture, and rebelliousness, nonconformity, and 
enthusiasm for rock music. Crowds whose members had a 
stronger conventional or achievement orientation also had 
lower levels of aggression and delinquency. Crowds whose 
members had stronger urban or alternative orientations also 
had higher levels of depression, delinquency, and aggression.
Group Boundaries and Norms
Membership in cliques is relatively stable but always vulner-
able to change. One description suggests that these groups 
have some central members who serve as leaders, others 
who are regularly included in clique activities, and still oth-
ers who are on the periphery. At the same time, there are 
the wannabes, who would like to be part of the clique but 
Groups of high school students are easily identifi able by their 
style of dress and the place in the school where they hang out.

money. However, they continue to maintain an emotional 
attachment to their families and to family values.
What is the nature of parent-adolescent interaction? How 
do differences in its quality infl uence the adolescent’s well-
being? Using the attachment paradigm as a frame of refer-
ence, one can think of adolescence as a time when young 
people strive to expand their range of exploration with 
reduced needs to return to the secure base. Adolescents try to 
decrease their dependence on their parents for setting goals, 
establishing patterns of tastes and preferences, and making 
decisions. This does not mean that the sense of closeness and 
connection with parents is less important. For example, ado-
lescents may not want to seek help from parents when they 
are experiencing diffi culty in their social relationships, but at 
the same time, if a serious problem arises, they want to know 
that their parent is available to be supportive and under-
standing. Adolescents who continue to experience parental 
warmth also report lower levels of emotional distress than 
those who report more distant relationships with parents 
and turn more to peers for support (Operario, Tschann, 
Flores, & Bridges, 2006). Adolescents can take the point of 
view of their parents. They realize when their behavior has 
been a source of distress to their parent, of if they have tested 
the limits of previously agreed-upon rules or boundaries. 
Within the context of a secure attachment, these times lead 
to a goal-corrected revision in the balance of autonomy and 
closeness. In many ways, the parent’s desire to foster a child’s 
self-reliance and a child’s goal to reduce the parent’s author-
ity over day-to-day behaviors are compatible. In the process 
of achieving these goals, some loss of emotional closeness is 
likely (Allen & Land, 1999; Collins & Laursen, 2006).
As adolescents go through puberty, confl icts with parents 
are likely. One way of understanding this confl ict is to view 
it as a way for adolescents to achieve new levels of individu-
ation and autonomy while still preserving bonds of closeness 
and connection (Collins & Laursen, 2006). A meta-analysis 
of patterns of confl ict in White, middle-class families found 
that frequency of confl ict and intensity of confl ict were two 
distinct dimensions. The meta-analysis found that the fre-
quency of parent-adolescent confl ict decreased from early 
adolescence (ages 10 to 12) to middle adolescence (12 
to 16), but that the intensity of those conflicts increased 
(Laursen, Coy, & Collins, 1998). Typically parent-adolescent 
confl icts are about daily issues, like household chores, clean-
ing up their room, how money will be spent, whether the 
child is spending enough time on schoolwork, or curfews, 
rather than about basic value issues like political ideology 
or religious beliefs. This same pattern has been observed in 
African American and White middle-class families (Smetana, 
Daddis, & Chuang, 2003).
With age, adolescents and their parents expand the range 
of issues that are considered personal issues that should be 
decided by teens and not subject to parental authority, like 
how they spend their free time, how they dress, or the kind 
of television shows they watch. Nonetheless, certain areas 
of morality or safety, like using drugs or smoking cigarettes, 
it and what behaviors are expected at various levels. On the 
basis of all this information, they must decide whether their 
personal growth is compatible with the peer group affi liation 
they have made.
Membership in an adolescent peer group is a forerunner of 
membership in an adult social group. Adolescent peer groups 
are somewhat less organized than their adult counterparts, 
but they are considerably more structured than childhood 
friendship groups. Through peer group membership, adoles-
cents begin to learn techniques for assessing the organization 
of social groups and their own position within them. They 
develop aspirations for advancing their own social standing. 
Also, adolescents gain some insight into the rewards and costs 
of extensive group identifi cation. Although the actual friends 
made during adolescence may change as one grows older, the 
social skills learned at this time provide a long-lasting basis 
for functioning in a mature social group.
Parents and Peers
How does involvement with peers during early adolescence 
relate to one’s closeness to family members? Do adolescents 
abandon family interactions and values for peer interactions 
and values? Can closeness to peers compensate for a lack of 
closeness to parents, or does the intimacy achieved with par-
ents extend outward to a circle of friends? To what extent 
do parents continue to have an infl uence on adolescent peer 
relationships?
In the transition from childhood to adolescence, the 
child’s radius of signifi cant relationships changes. One study 
looked at the structure and function of social support among 
African American, European American, and Hispanic Ameri-
can children in three age groups: 7-, 10-, and 14-year-olds 
(Levitt, Weber, & Guacci, 1993). In the transition from age 7 
to 10, extended family members became increasingly impor-
tant to children as a source of support. This pattern was 
found in all three ethnic groups, but the African American 
and Hispanic American children were more likely to identify 
extended family members as sources of support than were 
the European American children. From age 10 to 14, friends 
become an increasingly important source of support. The 
number of people mentioned as friends increased notably 
from age 7 to 14. However, at all three ages and in all three 
ethnic groups, family members were mentioned as the most 
central in these children’s lives—“the people who are the 
most close and important to you—people you love the most 
and who love you the most” (Levitt et al., 1993). Moreover, at 
each age, support from this close, inner circle made up largely 
of family members was an important correlate of well-being 
and sociability.
Under optimal conditions, the increasingly important role 
of peer relationships in early adolescence takes place against 
a background of continuing close, supportive relationships 
with family members. Adolescents describe a variety of overt 
signs of independence from their families: They may make 
decisions about clothes, dating, and so on; they may drive 
cars; they may stay out late; and they may earn their own 

370 | 
CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
over peer relationships was associated with greater amounts of 
delinquent behavior, more drug use, and lower grades (Mounts, 
2007). Because this was a correlational study, we do not know 
whether the parent-adolescent confl ict is a result of the parents’ 
assessment that the child’s friends are antisocial and engaging in 
high-risk behaviors, or if the parent-child confl ict about peers 
leads the child to seek out friends who are similarly distressed at 
home and resort to antisocial, high-risk behaviors.
The quality of the home environment, especially the nature 
of parenting practices, has implications for the adolescent’s peer 
relationships as well as for the quality of parent-child interac-
tions. Recall from the discussion in Chapter 8 that high levels 
of power assertion by parents are associated with a greater like-
lihood of peer rejection during middle childhood. Studies of 
the relationship of parenting practices to adolescent peer group 
membership are extending this analysis. A model was proposed 
to examine the relationship of parenting practices to adolescent 
behaviors and ultimately to crowd affi liation (Brown et al., 1993; 
Durbin et al., 1993). Parenting practices were operationally 
defi ned as the extent to which parents emphasized academic 
achievement, parental monitoring of adolescent behaviors, and 
the degree to which parents involved adolescents in decision 
making. Three adolescent behaviors were measured: the stu-
dents’ grade point averages, drug use, and self-reliance. Finally, 
the students were identifi ed as members of one of six crowds: 
popular, jocks, brains, normals, druggies, or outcasts.
Results of the research found that parenting practices had 
both direct and indirect impacts on adolescents’ crowd member-
ships. Parenting practices were linked to the children’s behavior, 
which in turn was a strong predictor of their crowd affi liation. 
Parents who emphasized academic achievement were likely 
to have adolescents who had high grades and who were self-
reliant, factors that also predicted being popular and not being 
members of the druggie or outcast groups. Low parental moni-
toring and little joint decision making were associated with drug 
use, low self-reliance, and membership in the druggie crowd. 
Even though adolescents may perceive their involvement with 
their peers as a domain that is separate and distinct from their 
family life, this research suggests that parental socialization prac-
tices infl uence peer relations.
The Psychosocial Crisis: Group 
Identity versus Alienation
Objective 6. To describe the psychosocial crisis of 
group identity versus alienation, the central process 
through which the crisis is resolved, peer pressure, the 
prime adaptive ego quality of fi delity to others, and the 
core pathology of isolation.
Throughout life, tensions arise between the desires for 
individuality and for connection. Certain cultures empha-
size connection over individuality, whereas others put 
still fall under parental authority. Some issues, such as hang-
ing around with people your parents disapprove of, may be 
topics that require negotiation. They are not clearly in the 
parental authority or the personal preference domain. Even 
though the trend is for the domain of personal preference 
to increase with age, families differ both within cultures and 
across cultures in how likely they are to view decisions as 
legitimately governed by parental authority, personal adoles-
cent preferences, or shared control (Cumsille, Darling, Fla-
herty, & Martinez, 2009). These differences in perceptions 
about who has legitimate authority around issues of concern 
to adolescents is relevant for the extent to which parents and 
children experience confl ict, the extent to which adolescents 
try to deceive their parents, and the opportunities that par-
ents have to infl uence their children’s decision making. Con-
sider the following narrative written by a Chinese adolescent 
whose family had recently immigrated to Canada (Li, 2009).
My parents said we brought you to Canada because student 
life in China is too hard. But now I don’t think my life has 
changed except for the place. I am still being pushed very 
hard. . . . They always press me like, “you should study, you 
should study, you should study. . . like this.” If I just watched 
TV for 10 minutes, by the 11th minute, they would say “go 
study, don’t watch it” or they would say “if you are tired, you 
can rest for 5 minutes, then go back to your study.” They say 
this to me almost every day. (Li, 2010, p. 488)
In European American families, as children get older, they are 
less likely to concede to their parents, and parents are increas-
ingly likely to concede to their children. In African American 
families, most confl icts end with the child conceding to the par-
ents, preserving the cultural value of obedience and respect for 
elders (Smetana, Daddis, & Chuang, 2003). In a study of Chi-
nese American adolescents, expectations for personal autonomy 
seemed to be expressed at a somewhat later age. Urban Chinese 
American youth were more accepting of open disagreements 
with their parents than rural youth, and described their relation-
ships with parents as less cohesive and more confl ictual than 
rural youth (Wenxin, Meiping, & Fuligni, 2006). Mild, periodic 
confl icts refl ect a changing balance of power or control within 
the family, as adolescents give voice to their own opinions and 
defend their choices. The acceptability of these confl icts, their 
intensity and frequency, and the ways they are resolved appear 
to be shaped by the cultural context and values regarding indi-
viduation and interdependence.
One area that has been studied recently is parent-adolescent 
confl ict about peer relationships. Parents use a variety of tech-
niques to manage, monitor, and possibly control their ado-
lescent children’s peer interactions (Mounts, 2004). Whereas 
adolescents may seek parental advice from time to time about 
peer issues, they also view peer friendships, clique membership, 
and time spent with peers to fall into the category of personal 
choice. As they get older, adolescents are likely to defend their 
right to choose their friends and to spend time with friends as

The Psychosocial Crisis: Group Identity versus Alienation | 371
In the process of seeking group affi liation, adolescents are 
confronted by the fi t—or lack of fi t—between their personal 
needs and the norms and values of relevant social groups in 
the environment. The process of self-evaluation takes place 
within the context of the meaningful groups whose members 
are available for comparison and identifi cation. Individual 
needs for social approval, affi liation, leadership, power, and 
status are expressed in the kinds of group identifi cations that 
are made and rejected during the period from age 12 to 18. 
In a positive resolution of the confl ict of group identity ver-
sus alienation, adolescents discover one or more groups that 
provide them with a sense of group belonging, meet their 
social needs, and allow them to express their social selves. 
They become psychologically connected to social life.
Cognitive Processes That Support 
the Formation of Group Identity
Adolescence is not the first time that children are aware 
of being a group member or claiming an affi liation with a 
group. Young children may be on sports teams, play in an 
orchestra or band, or belong to a dance group. They tend 
to defi ne groups on the basis of common activities. In com-
parison, adolescents begin to have a mental representation 
of the social groups in their school or community and the 
relationships among these groups. They are able to analyze 
the norms and expectations associated with various groups. 
They can assess the status or prestige of being a member of 
a particular group, and the ways that group membership 
affects attitudes and values, shapes interests, and infl uences 
one’s self-concept through acceptance and rejection (Bet-
tencourt & Hume, 1999). For example, in a high school, 
teens can identify various crowds such as the populars, the 
druggies, the athletes, and the outcasts. They can describe 
distinctions among these groups with regard to their dress, 
where they hang out at the school, and behaviors or values 
that are associated with these crowds. Further, adolescents 
can characterize what it would take to be a member of one 
of these crowds, the possibility of being in more than one of 
these crowds, the possibility for interactions among mem-
bers of these crowds, and the advantages or disadvantages 
linked to being associated with each of these crowds.
There are three cognitive capacities necessary for an ado-
lescent to establish a group identity: group representations, 
which refers to the conceptualization and labeling or clas-
sifi cation of groups; group operations, which refers to the 
processes through which groups are formed, maintained, 
or dissolved; and reflective thinking about groups, which 
includes an ability to analyze the array of groups and their 
relationship to one another.
Group Representations. Group representations provide 
the earliest forms of group identity, refl ecting the ability to 
use words and symbols to signify membership in a group. 
Infants and young children have a wide variety of group 
experiences and are able to represent their group mem-
bership using verbal labels and drawings. The capacity for 
individuality ahead of connection. However, all societ-
ies must deal with both aspects of the ego: the I as agent, 
originator, and executive of one’s individual thoughts and 
actions, and the we as agent, originator, and executive of 
collective, cooperative enterprises that preserve and fur-
ther the survival of the group (Triandis, 1990). During 
the early years of adolescence, one confronts a new psy-
chosocial confl ict, in which pressures to ally oneself with 
specifi c groups and to learn to be comfortable functioning 
as a member of a group are major preoccupations. This 
confl ict is called group identity versus alienation (Newman 
& Newman, 2001).
Group Identity
In early adolescence, young people form a scheme—an 
orchestrated, integrated set of ideas about the norms, expec-
tations, and status hierarchy of the salient groups in their 
social world, building these representations from groups 
of which they are members or in which they aspire to hold 
membership (reference groups; Gurin & Markus, 1988). 
Associated with these schemes are strong emotional invest-
ments, cognitions, and possibly behavioral patterns. As a 
young person prepares to engage in the larger social world, 
a positive sense of group identity provides confi dence that 
she is meaningfully connected to society, has a cognitive 
map of the characteristics of the social landscape, and the 
skills or tools to navigate the terrain. Perceiving oneself as 
a competent member of a group or groups is fundamental 
to one’s self-concept as well as to one’s willingness to par-
ticipate in and contribute to society. The formation of social 
commitments in early adolescence provides a foundation for 
the capacity to establish meaningful ties to groups at the per-
sonal, community, national, and international levels in adult 
life (Lawler, Thye, & Yoon, 2009).
Early adolescents experience a search for membership—
an internal questioning about the groups of which they are 
most naturally a part. They ask themselves, “Who am I, and 
with whom do I belong?” Although membership in a peer 
group may be the most pressing concern, questions about 
other group identifi cations also arise. Adolescents evaluate 
the nature of their ties to immediate and extended family 
members, and they begin to understand the unique charac-
teristics of their racial, ethnic, cultural, and sexual identities. 
They may become identifi ed with various organizations (e.g., 
religious, political, civic). Research confi rms that in the most 
positive pattern, peer group membership does not replace 
attachment to parents or closeness with family. Rather, the 
adolescent’s network of supportive relations is anchored in 
the family and expands into the domain of meaningful peer 
relationships. Adolescents who show strong signs of mental 
health and adaptive coping strategies have positive com-
munication and trusting relationships with parents or other 
close family members as well as strong feelings of trust and 
security among their friends (Raja, McGee, & Stanton, 1992; 
Levitt et al., 1993).

the distinguishing features that defi ne members, (2) experi-
encing a sense of history as a member of a group, (3) hav-
ing an emotional investment in the group, and (4) detecting 
the social evaluation of one’s group and its relation to other 
groups.
Categorizing People and Recognizing Distinguishing 
Features of Group Members. Beginning in toddler-
hood, young children use social categories related to gender 
and age to group people (Leinbach & Fagot, 1986; Martin 
et al., 1990; Lobel & Menashri, 1993; Hirschfeld, 1994). 
 Toddlers have a sense of the family group and understand that 
some people are in the family, whereas others are not (New-
man, Roberts, & Syre, 1993). With a broadening of exposure 
to social settings, children learn to recognize a wider variety 
of groups. By middle childhood, they can appreciate their 
simultaneous membership in a variety of groups such 
as family, sports team, and friendship groups (O’Brien & 
Bierman, 1988).
Groups typically have boundaries that limit membership 
and shared markers that bind the members together. In early 
adolescence, young people learn to read, categorize, and 
relate to informal peer networks where clique structures 
provide a comparatively egalitarian learning environment, 
determine social status, and help defi ne a person’s feelings 
of belonging and worth. Language use, nonverbal gestures, 
style of dress, use of certain spaces, behaviors such as cig-
arette smoking or drug use, and participation in specific 
activities may become markers that delineate group mem-
bership and provide a sense of group identifi cation. Friends 
may invent expressions or unique ways of speaking that help 
defi ne a group and strengthen members’ commitment. Over 
time, the similarities among members of a peer group are 
strengthened, thereby clarifying their commitment to certain 
values and behaviors. Although much of the literature that 
explores this process has focused on deviant or risky behav-
iors, such as cigarette smoking, alcohol use, or truancy, the 
process can support prosocial commitments as well (Dielman, 
1994; Berndt & Keefe, 1995).
Experiencing a Sense of History as a Group Member. 
In a gym class, one may be assigned to the red team one 
day and to the gray team another. These assignments do 
not foster a meaningful sense of group identity. However, if 
one joins the band and practices every day, goes to games, 
travels on the bus, and parties with the band members, the 
sense of being a bandie begins to take shape. Group identity 
emerges out of continuous interactions, through which one 
becomes visible and known to other group members while 
they become visible and known to you (Reicher, Levine, & 
Gordijn, 1998). What was done in fun last year may become 
next year’s tradition as a group selects rituals to symbolize 
how important they all are to each other.
Of course, memberships in groups change. One may 
transfer to a new school, join a new team or club, or become 
part of a group that gets together only in the summers. In 
representing groups and the relationships among groups 
expands in early adolescence, so that youth are able to map 
more groups simultaneously, including those in their imme-
diate family, school, and peer environments. The expansion 
of this representational ability may be stimulated by expo-
sure to a greater variety of groups, by increases in represen-
tational skills, and by new social demands to establish one’s 
place within the range of existing groups. It may also be a 
product of neurological changes that accompany puberty.
Group Operations. Group operations include such 
diverse processes as joining a group, forming in-group 
and out-group attitudes, stereotyping, quitting or reject-
ing a group, and exercising leadership in a group. Some of 
these operations can be observed among toddlers and early-
school-age children. They recognize the common members 
of a group, use fantasy play to coordinate roles with other 
members of a group, and talk about themselves as part of a 
family, school, or friendship relationship. Group operations 
can be observed in neighborhoods, with some children expe-
riencing exclusion and others experiencing acceptance and 
support. Children as young as 5 or 6 may join sports teams 
and learn lessons of team spirit, teamwork, and team pride. 
Research has shown that by the fourth and fifth grades, 
some children have already begun to experience social isola-
tion and social rejection (Hymel, Bowker, & Woody, 1993; 
Farmer & Rodkin, 1996).
In early adolescence, teens develop more advanced skills 
for connecting to their groups, experiencing bonding and 
acceptance, participating in leadership and team build-
ing, and detecting evidence about the possibility of rejec-
tion by their signifi cant groups. These skills are refi ned and 
extended as teens confront a wider array of groups with 
varying degrees of associational closeness.
Refl ective Thinking About Groups. The level of con-
ceptualization necessary for the formation of group identity 
involves reflective and comparative thinking. It requires 
decentering from one’s own groups to consider how these 
groups may be perceived by others, evaluating the strengths 
and weaknesses of a group, and considering the implications 
of group membership for how one is treated in the commu-
nity. Early adolescence is characterized by a new conscious-
ness about one’s membership in groups, the boundaries and 
barriers that separate groups or limit membership in groups, 
and the social implications of being in one group or another. 
The emergence of formal operational reasoning may help 
produce new capacities for refl ection and speculation about 
social relationships and complex social systems.
Four Types of Experiences That Build 
a Group Identity
Given the three cognitive capacities that permit the concep-
tualization of a group identity, we hypothesize that the actual 
formation of a group identity requires four types of experi-
ences: (1) categorizing people into groups and recognizing 

 
The Psychosocial Crisis: Group Identity versus Alienation | 373
adolescents are able to differentiate between being viewed 
negatively by others or being a target of discrimination, and 
expressing personal pride in their racial group (Williams & 
Thornton, 1998; Valk, 2000). The important point is that the 
group identity established during early adolescence occurs in 
the context of a social reality in which one’s own group can 
be located in a status hierarchy leading to judgments about 
the merits of the group and about oneself as a member of the 
group (Luhtanen & Crocker, 1992).
Ethnic Group Identity
One of the most challenging aspects of establishing group 
identity facing many adolescents is the formation of an 
ethnic group identity (Spencer & Markstrom-Adams, 1990). 
Ethnic identity is not merely knowing that one is a mem-
ber of a certain ethnic group, but recognizing that some 
aspects of one’s thoughts, feelings, and actions are infl u-
enced by one’s ethnic identity. One’s ethnic group becomes 
a signifi cant reference group, whose values, outlook, and 
goals are taken into account as one makes important life 
choices. Ethnic identity varies across ethnic groups and 
among individuals within groups. For example, some 
young people have had more exposure to the cultural 
norms and values of their ethnic group than others. Some 
have had more guided parental socialization about the 
existence of prejudice and ways of coping with discrimina-
tion. Thus, ethnic identity is more aptly viewed as a psy-
chosocial rather than a demographic variable. It is based 
upon socially constructed meaning rather than biological or 
genetic differences (Phinney, 1996b; Smedley & Smedley, 
2005; Quintana et al., 2006).
In the United States, a history of negative imagery, vio-
lence, discrimination, and invisibility has been linked to 
African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and 
Hispanic Americans. Young people in each of these groups 
encounter confl icting values as they consider the larger soci-
ety and their own ethnic identity. They must struggle with 
the negative or ambivalent feelings that are linked with their 
own ethnic group because of the cultural stereotypes that 
have been conveyed to them through the media and the 
schools and because of the absence of role models from their 
own group who are in positions of leadership and authority.
Issues of ethnic group identity may not become salient 
until early adolescence. As children of color grow up, they 
are surrounded by members of their own ethnic group and 
socialized to internalize the values and beliefs of that group. 
At the same time, through participation in school, expo-
sure to the media, and exploration of their community, 
they incorporate many of the ideals and values of European 
American culture. Several longitudinal studies demonstrate 
that there is a signifi cant trajectory of development of racial/
ethnic identity across adolescence (Altschul, Oyserman, & 
Bybee, 2006; Pahl & Way, 2006). As we have discussed, in 
adolescence peer groups become more structured. Sanctions 
against cross-race/cross-ethnic friendships and dating rela-
tionships may become more intense.
each case, the formation of a sense of group identity requires 
the accumulation of interactions and the sense of having a 
history of shared experiences (Worchel, 1998). Here one sees 
the interconnection of the I and the we. One may think of the 
I as the agent that seeks out group membership, choosing to 
join one group or avoid another. At the same time, as one 
participates in a group and experiences a sense of shared his-
tory, one begins to internalize values, beliefs, and practices 
held in common by the group, thus leading to a revision of 
the I and strengthening of the we.
Emotional Investment in the Group. The intensifi ca-
tion of emotions that occurs with puberty and early ado-
lescence is often evidenced in a deepening dedication and 
commitment to one’s groups, including family and kinship 
groups (Bettencourt & Hume, 1999). One sees here the 
seeds of nationalism and patriotism—a redirection of narcis-
sism to the group and a binding of energy to the group as 
an extension of oneself (Markovsky & Chaffee, 1995; Coats, 
Smith, Claypool, & Banner, 2000). As evidence of this emo-
tional investment, one fi nds the expression of pride about 
one’s group, a tendency to idealize the members of the group 
in comparison to others outside the group, and a willingness 
to make personal sacrifi ces in order to support or advance 
the group’s goals (Reicher et al., 1998). The emotional 
investment can be expressed as positive feelings of attrac-
tion to other members of the group and negative feelings of 
depression or jealousy associated with betrayal. New levels 
of intimacy are possible, as are new levels of hurt.
Social Evaluation of One’s Group and Its Relation 
to Other Groups. Adolescents become aware of the status 
hierarchy of the groups in their school and neighborhood. 
They recognize how their groups are viewed by others, and 
they form their own views of each group’s value and impor-
tance to them (Dunbar, 1997). Adolescents spend a good 
deal of time analyzing and evaluating the groups in their 
lives. Studies of racial and ethnic identity clearly show that 
Charlene is showing the friends in her clique a photo that she 
took of them at a party the night before. Their sense of a shared 
history increases their emotional investment in the group.

CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
The students also said the Koran, which Muslims consider 
the literal word of God, provides a perfect blueprint for their 
lives. Their ideal society would follow Islamic law and make 
no separation between religion and state. In the meantime, 
they said, they want to become doctors and lawyers and 
teachers in the United States. (Sachs, 2001, p. B1)
In a study of Muslim adolescents ages 12 to 18, 84% 
said they experienced one or more acts of discrimination in 
the previous year, and 10% reported daily discrimination 
(Sirin & Fine, 2008). Many of these experiences take place 
in school. Layered on to these overt acts are experiences 
of being watched, talked about, or treated with suspicion. 
Thus, while they claim to feel totally American, these Mus-
lim youth feel misunderstood and judged, experiencing a 
sense of being outsiders which, in its own way, strength-
ens their ethnic identity. In the face of diffi culties in trying 
to explain their Muslim faith to their non-Muslim peers, 
strong bonds of peer support form with other Muslim teens 
who have made similar commitments regarding everyday 
behaviors:
“You are not going to hang out with somebody who drinks if 
you don’t drink. Someone who parties if you don’t party. You 
need to fi nd people to get that base and who can give you 
support when you are away from home. And most likely, by 
choice the ones you can identify yourself with most, that’s 
Islam for us.” (Sirin & Fine, 2008, p. 109)
In the transition from early to late adolescence, most 
minority youth experience some critical evaluation of the 
values and beliefs of the dominant culture and how they 
conflict with the values and beliefs of their own ethnic 
group. The more fully immersed young children are in the 
values and traditions of their ethnic heritage, the more likely 
it is that they will experience a dual or multiple identity—for 
example, seeing themselves as both American and African 
American or American and Chinese American (Phinney, 
1997). Over time, and with the benefi t of exposure to read-
ing, conversations, and interactions with people from other 
subgroups, young people begin to synthesize a sense of how 
their ethnic identity fi ts into their overall personal identity 
and how it will infl uence the quality of their relationships 
with members of their own and other ethnic groups (Cross, 
1991; Phinney, 1989, 1996; Yip, Seaton, & Sellers, 2006).
Most research on ethnic identity has focused on African 
American, Latino American, and Asian American youth. Rela-
tively little attention has been given to the ethnic identity of 
the racially/ethnically privileged European American youth. 
Considerable evidence suggests that there are substantial 
benefi ts to being a member of a racially/ethnically privileged 
group for social status, access to resources, and social expecta-
tions. Not much is known about how these benefi ts and their 
link to being a member of a privileged racial/ethnic group are 
conceptualized by European American youth, and how the 
experiences of adolescence shape a racial or ethnic group iden-
tifi cation that might persist into the future (Spencer, 2006).
In the transition to high school, adolescents may encoun-
ter more evidence of discrimination through overt rejection, 
academic hassles, being ignored, being harshly punished, 
or experiencing fewer opportunities to be recognized for 
school leadership roles (French, Seidman, Allen, & Aber, 
2000; Seaton, Yip, & Sellers, 2009). The nature and extent 
of racial or ethnic hostilities are related in part to the com-
position of the high school. Students who are in a racial or 
ethnic minority within their school are more likely to expe-
rience intergroup hostilities than those who are in a more 
diverse, well-balanced school (Graham, 2004). Students 
may find that their family and ethnic group values con-
fl ict with the values of the majority culture. Acculturation 
strain may stimulate new levels of exploration and ethnic 
commitment, or new sentiments of alienation. During the 
high school years, most youth are in the process of explor-
ing what their ethnic group membership means to them, not 
yet having made a clear commitment to embracing or crys-
tallizing an ethnic identity (Yip, Seaton, & Sellers, 2006). 
In a longitudinal study of Latinos’ ethnic identity over a 
4-year period, girls showed a steady growth in exploration 
of their ethnic identity, increased clarity about what their 
ethnic identity meant to them, and increasingly positive feel-
ings about their Latina identity. For boys, there was little 
evidence of exploration or increased clarity, but there was 
growth in the positive feelings about being Latino. For both 
boys and girls, affi rmation of their Latino ethnicity was posi-
tively associated with self-esteem (Umaña-Taylor, Gonzales-
Backen, & Guimond, 2009).
In the wake of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Cen-
ter in New York on September 11, 2001, Muslim adolescents 
became a focus of some attention. The nature of their ethnic 
identity and their divided allegiances were highlighted. Stu-
dents at a Muslim high school in Brooklyn, New York, were 
interviewed about their feelings and their confl icts:
“We have a burden on us,” said Andira Abudayeh, who is 16 
and attends Al Noor. “We’re Muslims, and we feel like other 
Muslims around the world do. And we’re Americans.” . . . 
For these Chinese teens, their ethnic identity is integrated into 
their personal identity as they form friendships and make com-
mitments to their families and community.

from both the noncustodial parent and the custodial parent, 
and lacking the social skills needed to form satisfying peer 
friendships (hostile-aggressive-parenting.com, 2010).
Alienation may result from personality characteristics, 
such as shyness, introversion, or lack of sociability. Some 
young people experience social anxiety, mistrust in oth-
ers, or cautiousness in interactions that prevent them from 
forming interpersonal connections. Others are overly self-
conscious, becoming so preoccupied with their own feelings 
and thoughts that they withdraw from social interactions 
(Kochanska, Murray, & Coy, 1997). Feelings of shame over 
an illness, disability, or perceived inadequacy may lead to 
perceptions of peer rejection or an unwillingness to form 
social bonds (Fife & Wright, 2000).
Finally, alienation may result from a combination of 
problems with common identity and common bond. For 
example, friendships across racial groups may be very diffi -
cult to preserve in a neighborhood but are supported in the 
school environment. If an African American and a Euro-
pean American adolescent become close friends at school, 
both may feel alienated from the same-race peers in their 
community. Youth who are recent immigrants may experi-
ence this confl ict as they become acculturated. They may 
become increasingly distant from their families as they take 
on U.S. language and practices, but they may still be unable 
to form close, supportive relationships with U.S. adoles-
cents who view them as outsiders. Nataša, an immigrant 
from Bosnia, described her experiences of alienation as a 
high school student:
I was so different and so odd. I ended up in an all-girls Cath-
olic school in the middle of Ohio where everyone is blond 
and everyone wants to get married and have babies. . . . And 
no one wanted to talk to me; no one even wanted to talk to me. 
I was the only person in the class that no one ever talked to 
because I’m so different, and they all made a point of seeing 
me as different. (Mosselson, 2009, p. 463)
In this case, Nataša’s alienation is in part a result of her 
cultural displacement and the related lack of common iden-
tity and in part a result of the lack of common bond with 
other students in her school.
The Contribution of Alienation to Group 
Identity and Individual Identity
To some degree, experiences of alienation are important 
for the continued formulation of both group and individ-
ual identity. A period of feeling alone and lonely may help 
teens to appreciate how good social acceptance feels and 
how important it is for their well-being. Moreover, experi-
ences of alienation within a group may help a young person 
see the I against the backdrop of the we. The discomfort 
of not fi tting in helps one recognize the distinctiveness of 
one’s point of view. In the extreme, however, the lack of 
social integration that may result from a negative resolution 
of this crisis can have signifi cant implications for adjust-
ment to school, self-esteem, and subsequent psychosocial 
Alienation
Alienation refers to a sense of social estrangement, an 
absence of social support or meaningful social connec-
tion (Mau, 1992). Alienation can be viewed as deriving 
from dilemmas associated with issues of common identity, 
common bond, or both. Alienation associated with issues of 
common identity may occur when young people are forced 
to take on roles or are expected to comply with group expec-
tations to which they do not subscribe. This might occur as 
a result of stereotyping, racism, or elitism within a school 
or community. Under these conditions, adolescents perceive 
that their opinions, beliefs, and values differ substantially 
from those of the groups they are viewed as belonging to. In 
many schools, some subsets of students are marginalized due 
to some marker such as minority status, physical abnormali-
ties, or developmental delays, or as a result of poor social 
skills and low academic motivation. These students are often 
typed as nobodies, loners, disengaged, or outcasts. In a lon-
gitudinal study of crowd identity, Strouse (1999) found that 
not all students in the uninvolved crowd remained so over 
the 4 years of high school. Many changed to the average 
crowd orientation, usually by fi nding new friends, engag-
ing in social activities, and placing more emphasis on getting 
good grades.
Alienation associated with issues of common bond occurs 
when adolescents are unable to form interpersonal ties that 
provide feelings of acceptance and emotional support. This 
type of alienation may arise from several different sources. 
Under conditions of parental coldness, distancing, neglect, 
or rejection, children fi nd that they cannot count on the fam-
ily to serve as a source of emotional or instrumental support 
(Dishion, Poulin, & Medici-Skaggs, 2000). They lack a tem-
plate for experiencing the foundational benefi ts of belonging 
that are associated with group identity. As a result of harsh 
parenting, some adolescents have poor social skills—they 
are either overly aggressive and domineering, or overly with-
drawn and socially inept (Poulin, Dishion, & Haas, 1999). 
Over time, children with poor social skills are less likely to 
form satisfying social relationships with friends and are more 
likely to engage in delinquent behaviors that reflect their 
sense of alienation from family and peers.
In some families, children are exposed to a pattern of 
hostile, aggressive parenting in which the custodial parent 
insists in the most assertive and unkind way that their other 
parent is someone to be mistrusted; an enemy to be avoided 
and disrespected. These efforts to alienate a child from a par-
ent are frightening, confusing, and a source of emotional dis-
tress. The child, exposed to this kind of emotional abuse, 
may experience a variety of symptoms such as anxiety, with-
drawal, self-inflicted injuries, or uncontrolled aggression, 
any of which may make the establishment of effective peer 
relationships diffi cult. As the child gets older, he may ques-
tion or challenge the hostile, aggressive parent, asserting his 
independent view about the absent parent, and defying the 
custodial parent. The child may reach adolescence, alienated

CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
that a teen should perform a behavior (e.g., smoke mari-
juana) or risk group rejection. This is the usual connotation 
of peer pressure, and parents or educators are often focused 
on helping teens resist this type of infl uence. A second type 
of peer infl uence occurs through modeling. Teens who spend 
time with one another watch each other’s style of dress, ges-
tures, and use of language, and imitate those behaviors in 
an effort to consolidate their sense of group membership. A 
third type of infl uence is more subtle normative regulation, 
where peers use teasing, gossiping, or sarcasm to infl uence 
each other’s attitudes and behavior. Finally, peer infl uence 
occurs when friends create opportunities for unsupervised 
activities—having parties where beer is served, cruising in 
cars, or arranging to meet at a park or mall when adults are 
not likely to be present.
Affi liating with a Peer Group
The process of affi liating with a peer group requires an ado-
lescent to accept the pressure and social infl uence imposed 
by it. This process provides the context in which the crisis of 
group identity versus alienation is resolved. Adolescents are 
at the point in their intellectual development when they are 
able to conceptualize themselves as objects of expectations. 
They may perceive these expectations as forces urging them 
to be more than they think they are—braver, more outgoing, 
more confi dent, and so forth. These expectations help defi ne 
the zone of proximal development for group skills and social 
competencies. Peer pressure may have a positive effect on the 
adolescent’s self-image and self-esteem, serving as a motive 
for group identifi cation. Those dimensions of the self that are 
valued by one’s own peer group become especially salient in 
each young person’s self-assessment.
As members of peer groups, adolescents have more infl u-
ence than they would have as single individuals; they begin 
to understand the value of collective enterprise. In offering 
membership, peer groups expand adolescents’ feelings of 
connection and protect them from loneliness. When family 
confl icts develop, adolescents can seek comfort and intimacy 
among peers. For adolescents to benefi t in these ways from 
their affi liation with a peer group, they must be willing to 
suppress some of their individuality and find pleasure in 
focusing on the attributes they share with those peers.
Confl icts Between Belonging 
and Personal Autonomy
Peer groups do not command total conformity. In fact, most 
peer groups depend on the unique characteristics of their 
members to lend defi nition and vigor to the roles that emerge 
within them. However, the peer group places importance on 
some level of conformity in order to bolster its structure and 
strengthen its effectiveness in satisfying members’ needs. 
Indeed, most adolescents fi nd some security in peer group 
development. Chronic confl ict about one’s integration into 
a meaningful reference group can lead to lifelong diffi cul-
ties in areas of personal health, work, controlling anger, 
and the formation of intimate family bonds (East, Hess, & 
Lerner, 1987; Spencer, 1982, 1988; Weigel, Devereux, 
Leigh, & Ballard-Reisch, 1998).
The Central Process: 
Peer Pressure
Adolescents’ family backgrounds, their interests, and styles 
of dress quickly link them to subgroups of peers who lend 
continuity and meaning to life within the context of their 
neighborhoods or schools. The peer group social structure is 
usually well established in most high schools, and members 
of that structure exert pressure on newcomers to join one 
peer group or another. Peer pressure refers to demands for 
conformity to group norms and a demonstration of commit-
ment and loyalty to group members. At the same time, young 
people outside the groups form expectations that reinforce 
adolescents’ connections to specific peer groups and pro-
hibit their movement to others. Likewise, an individual who 
becomes a member of a group is more acceptable to the social 
system than one who tries to remain unaffi liated and aloof.
The term peer pressure is often used with a negative con-
notation, suggesting that young people behave in ways that 
go against their beliefs or values because of a fear of peer 
rejection. However, we suggest an alternative meaning that 
highlights the emerging role of the peer group in the radius 
of significant others. The pressure from those close by—
those with whom a young person interacts each day—is not 
necessarily perceived as oppressive or coercive. It is, more 
often, the subtle co-adaptation of those who interact in the 
same social space, shaping and guiding one another toward 
intersubjectivity, much as an infant and a caregiver achieve 
mutual regulation. In a process of give and take, friends 
adapt to each other’s preferences and interests, leading to a 
shared outlook on their world. For example, Ellen is very 
shy, but it’s Friday night and her good friend Pam wants to go 
to the basketball game and then to a party afterward. Ellen is 
reluctant. She knows there is often a lot of drinking at these 
parties, and she is not in with the popular crowd that usually 
goes to these parties. Pam promises her that she won’t drink 
at the party and that if Ellen is really not having a good time 
Pam will leave with her. Ellen decides to go along with Pam 
and they end up having a very good time. Pam keeps her 
promise of no drinking, and at midnight they leave so they 
are home by their curfew. Pam and Ellen are now thinking 
about having a party at Ellen’s house next week, since this 
turned out to be a lot of fun.
Brown (2004) suggested four modes of peer infl uence, all 
of which may serve to encourage some behaviors and dis-
courage others. The most overt mode is the direct suggestion 

 
The Prime Adaptive Ego Quality and the Core Pathology | 377
that are necessary to preserve small groups and larger com-
munities alike: dedication to family, civic pride, and patrio-
tism. One of the by-products of fi delity to others is mattering, 
a “feeling that others depend upon us, are interested in us, 
are concerned with our fate” (Rosenberg & McCullough, 
1981, p. 163). Mattering is a relational aspect of the self-
concept that refl ects an assessment of how aware others are 
of you, how important you are to others, and how much 
others rely on you (Elliott, Kao, & Grant, 2004). When we 
pledge ourselves to others, we also become salient for them. 
We make a difference in their lives, and that, in return, con-
tributes to our sense of well-being (Taylor & Turner, 2001). 
Adolescents who perceive that they matter to their parents 
and friends report higher levels of well-being than those who 
matter only to their parents, or to neither group (Marshall, 
2004). The box on gangs illustrates how the desire for mat-
tering may lead a young person to make an affi liation with 
a dangerous or deviant group where they feel valued and 
protected, needs that are not being met by family, school, or 
other community groups.
Looking ahead to subsequent life stages, one can antici-
pate the signifi cant role that this ego quality plays in pledg-
ing long-term faithfulness to friends, marital partners, 
children, one’s aging parents, and other groups. Research on 
factors that buffer the effects of stress often cite the contri-
bution of social support to the long-term abilities of indi-
viduals to cope with change and to adapt positively to life 
challenges. Social support implies a capacity for fi delity. Peo-
ple who function as sources of support have the ability to 
remain compassionately connected to others during periods 
of hardship and loss as well as during periods of success and 
prosperity. When one thinks of a true friend, one pictures 
someone who stands by you even when it is not especially 
advantageous to do so. A true friend is someone who cares 
about you and supports you during moments of adversity as 
well as in times of joy.
Fidelity to others becomes a source of family solidarity 
as family members age and adults are called on to meet the 
needs of their own aging parents—a topic we will cover in 
Chapter 12 on middle adulthood. The role one plays in car-
ing for one’s aging parents is largely voluntary. It is based on 
one’s own defi nition of fi lial obligation, a sense of duty and 
responsibility for one’s parents. Surely the way adults enact 
this role refl ects their capacity for fi delity to others.
Dissociation
Dissociation refers to a sense of separateness, withdrawal 
from others, and an inability to experience the bond of 
mutual commitment. It does not mean a preference for being 
by oneself, but rather a tendency toward social distanc-
ing and a reluctance to make the kinds of commitments to 
others that are required for the establishment and mainte-
nance of enduring friendships. The following is an example 
of an adolescent who describes herself as floating along, 
demands to conform. The few well-defi ned characteristics of 
the group lend stability and substance to adolescents’ views 
of themselves. In complying with group pressure, adoles-
cents have an opportunity to state unambiguously that they 
are someone and that they belong somewhere (see the box 
on gangs).
Adolescents may also find that some peer expectations 
confl ict with their personal values or needs. For example, 
they may feel that intellectual skills are devalued by the peer 
group, that they are expected to participate in social func-
tions they do not enjoy, or that they are encouraged to be 
more independent from their families than they prefer to 
be. In most cases, adolescents’ personal values are altered 
and shaped by peer group pressure to increase their simi-
larity with the other group members. If, however, the peer 
group’s expectations are too distant from the adolescents’ 
own values, establishing a satisfying group identifi cation will 
become much more diffi cult. As a result, adolescents experi-
ence tension and conflict as they try to balance the allure 
of peer group membership with the cost of abandoning per-
sonal beliefs.
Susceptibility to coercive peer pressure seems to peak at 
age 13 or 14, when adolescents are most sensitive to peer 
approval and make the initial transition toward new levels of 
behavioral autonomy and emotional independence from par-
ents (Urberg, Shyu, & Liang, 1990; Lamborn & Steinberg, 
1993). During the years from 14 to 16, adolescents become 
more adept at resisting peer pressure. Through encounters 
with peer pressure and opportunities to see how it feels to 
conform or resist, they develop a growing appreciation for 
the content of their personal values against the backdrop of 
peer expectations. However, if the emotional costs of identi-
fying with the peer group become too great, adolescents may 
not open themselves up to group pressures. Therefore, they 
will be unable to establish the sense of group identity that is 
so central to psychosocial growth. An inability to reduce the 
tension and confl ict between group pressure and personal 
values produces a state of alienation, in which the individual 
is unable either to identify with social groups or to develop 
personal friendships.
The Prime Adaptive Ego 
Quality and the Core 
Pathology
Fidelity to Others
A positive resolution of the psychosocial crisis of group iden-
tity versus alienation results in the achievement of the prime 
adaptive ego quality referred to as fidelity to others—a 
capacity to freely pledge one’s loyalty to a group and to sus-
tain one’s faithfulness to the promises and commitments one 
makes to others. Fidelity to others produces the sentiments 

378 | 
CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
resentment toward the amiability and companionship they 
observe in others. Over time, dissociation results in the 
formulation of a mental world that is not well coordinated 
with social reality. A young person who experiences dis-
sociation is likely to feel misunderstood and to lack con-
fi dence in her ability to communicate with or connect to 
others.
At a basic level, any sense of we-ness requires a shared 
understanding between at least two people and a recogni-
tion that they experience some bond of investment in or 
identification with a common reality. This common real-
ity could involve facing a common enemy, encountering 
a common crisis, or embracing a common goal. The core 
pathology of dissociation occurs when the young person 
is unable to experience the level of mutual understand-
ing or symbolic connection that creates such bonds of 
we-ness.
disconnected from reality. Dissociation may be a symptom of 
more serious mental health problems such as schizophrenia, 
or an acute reaction to stress such as exposure to violence, 
rejection, or loss.
What can I tell you about that time in my life? Hunger 
dominated every moment, hunger and its silent twin, the 
constant urge to sleep. School passed in a dream. I couldn’t 
think. Logic fl ed, and memory drained away like motor oil. 
My stomach ached, my period stopped. I rose above the 
sidewalks, I was smoke. The rains came and I was sick and 
after school I had nowhere to go. (Fitch, 1999, p. 201)
Dissociation may occur as a result of rejection, abuse, 
or neglect. It may be a symptom of a more serious men-
tal disorder, such as schizophrenia or depression. Adoles-
cents who experience dissociation are likely to mistrust 
their peers and may even develop an attitude of hostile 
Gangs
IN THE LATE 1920s and 1930s, the study 
of delinquency included an analysis 
of the role of gangs. Early on, it was 
understood that delinquent behavior was 
typically group behavior, involving two 
or more boys in some type of criminal 
activity. Gangs were viewed as social 
groups, not unlike the kinds of groups 
that boys in more stable, prosperous 
neighborhoods create. The motives for 
joining a gang—“desires for recognition, 
approbation, and esteem of his fellows, 
for stimulation, thrill, and excitement, for 
intimate companionship, and for security 
and protection” (Burgess & Bogue, 
1967, p. 300)—do not differ much from 
the motives that adolescents have for 
joining any number of social groups 
and clubs. However, the focus of these 
gangs developed a delinquent emphasis 
and tradition that was passed from one 
generation of gang members to the next 
in a neighborhood. The ethical standards 
and values of these groups were often 
contrary to conventional values. In fact, 
actions that might bring a nondelinquent 
boy dishonor or shame—such as being 
arrested, appearing in juvenile court, or 
being sent to a correctional institution—
would be viewed as a source of pride 
and distinction to a gang member 
(Burgess & Bogue, 1967).
This analysis of the nature of gangs 
has not changed much over the years. 
Gangs continue to thrive in communities 
all across the United States. According 
to a survey carried out by the National 
Youth Gang Center, 3,330 jurisdictions 
experienced gang problems in 2008. 
This is an increase of 15% from 2002. 
Based on this survey, there are 774,000 
gang members in 27,900 gangs across 
the United States. The biggest increases 
have been in small cities and suburban

Adolescent Alcohol and Drug Use | 379
Figure 9.5 provides a historical overview of the life-
time prevalence of illicit drug use for eighth, tenth, and 
twelfth graders from 1975 to 2009 based on the Monitor-
ing the Future national survey sponsored by the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse (Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, & 
Schulenberg, 2009). Following a period of decline in drug 
use from 1981 through 1992, drug use among adolescents 
increased over the 1990s and is now beginning to decline 
again, though not to its 1992 low. In 2008, 37% of twelfth 
graders had used an illicit drug, and 17% of twelfth graders 
had tried an illicit drug other than marijuana. The authors, 
who have been following trends in teen drug use and atti-
tudes toward drugs for 30 years suggest that the early and 
growing use of marijuana can account for the substantial 
number of youth who have used an illegal drug during the 
high school years.
Alcohol use has remained at a stable and relatively 
high level since 1975. In 2008, 39% of eighth graders 
APPLIED TOPIC
Adolescent Alcohol 
and Drug Use
Objective 7. To review the patterns of adolescent 
alcohol and drug use and the factors associated with 
their use and abuse within a psychosocial framework.
American high-school-age youth show a higher level of illicit 
drug use than those of any other industrialized nation. By 
their senior year in high school (typically ages 17 and 18), 
almost half of American high school students have tried an 
illegal drug—whether marijuana, amphetamines, heroin or 
other opiates, cocaine, or barbiturates (Johnston, O’Malley, 
Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2007).
jurisdictions. Forty-fi ve percent of agen-
cies describe their gang problems as 
getting worse; 10% say their problems 
are getting better. Overall, in cities of 
250,000 and more, gang-related crimes, 
including aggravated assault, drug-
related crimes, and homicides, have 
increased since 2002 (Egley, Howell, & 
Moore, 2010).
Gangs actively recruit new 
members, engage in violent acts of 
initiation, and are becoming increasingly 
associated with drug traffi cking and 
violent crime. Experts say that what 
drives young people to gangs are 
poverty, the desire to belong, and the 
desire to be loved and recognized 
(Howell, 1994). One teenager said 
that his mother was hooked on crack 
cocaine. He joined the gang looking 
for love. Another one had an eye that 
was a little crossed. He said that some 
people at school made fun of him, but 
that members of his gang did not make 
fun of him.
Young people seek love, money, 
protection, and prestige from gang 
membership. Adolescents who join 
gangs are often unsuccessful in school 
and may have been suspended or 
expelled. School failure leads to periods 
of unsupervised time in the community 
and an inability to fi nd work. Modern 
gang activities are supported by a 
growing and spreading drug trade, easy 
access to guns, and the communication 
technology of beepers, cell phones, and 
voice mail, which allow gang members 
to coordinate their activities and 
preserve control over a wider area with 
increased mobility.
The concept of gangs is closely 
linked to the theme of group identity. 
Although gangs have a violent, 
criminal, and antisocial value system, 
they provide a highly organized social 
group for identifi cation. Gangs have 
clothing, colors, symbols, and signs that 
provide recognition across settings. 
Young people are recruited into gangs, 
making them feel valued and protected 
by the older gang members. Despite 
the great risks associated with gang 
activities, the pervasive presence 
of gangs in cities and larger towns 
suggests that gangs address a number 
of needs of today’s youth—needs that 
are not being met by communities, 
schools, and families.

Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Are gangs cliques or crowds? Why 
do you think so?
 2. What might be some differences 
between being a gang member and 
being part of a clique or friendship 
group that is involved in delinquent 
activities? In what ways are gangs 
similar to other kinds of tough or 
antisocial peer groups? In what ways 
are they different?
 3. What functions are served by gang 
membership? Are the effects of gang 
membership only negative?
 4. How do concepts presented in the 
chapter related to peer group mem-
bership and group identity versus 
alienation inform your understanding 
of gang membership?
 5. Imagine that you are a school 
counselor and a student has been 
brought to your attention as some-
one who is suspected of being 
involved in criminal activity. How 
might you work differently with a 
student who you know to be a mem-
ber of a gang than with someone 
who is not a gang member?

CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
pleasurable bodily sensations. Adolescents may use alcohol 
in an attempt to increase their sense of physical arousal, 
reduce sexual inhibitions, and minimize the self-conscious-
ness that is a barrier to social interactions. In larger quanti-
ties, alcohol may alter reality in such a way that adolescents 
are willing to take risks or ignore certain physical limita-
tions. When adolescents are intoxicated, the barriers of 
physical appearance, height, weight, or sexual immaturity 
may be minimized. Thus, dissatisfaction with one’s body 
image may contribute to an inclination to drink heavily in 
social situations.
Information from the National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism provides information about the 
potential harm alcohol can have for health and brain func-
tioning (NIAAA, 2004). The following information about 
health risks associated with alcohol is taken from that 
source.
 1. Alcohol can result in memory impairments after only 
a few drinks and, as the amount of alcohol increases, 
so does the degree of impairment. One consequence 
of binge drinking, especially on an empty stomach, is 
blackouts, a time for which the intoxicated person can-
not recall key details of events, or even entire events. 
Blackouts occur more often among social drinkers than 
was previously assumed; they are not a risk only for 
those who are addicted to alcohol.
 2. Because alcohol consumption interferes with normal eat-
ing patterns, a common consequence of alcoholism is 
thiamine defi ciency. Thiamine, also known as vitamin 
had tried alcohol, and 18% said that they have been 
drunk at least once in their lives. By the twelfth grade, 
72% had tried alcohol and 55% had gotten drunk. About 
22% of twelfth graders had experienced binge drinking 
(five or more drinks in a row) in the past month (John-
ston et al., 2009). Binge drinking and drunkenness 
among twelfth graders has declined since their peak in 
the early 1980s.
Physical Effects of Alcohol
Alcohol depresses the central nervous system. Although 
many people think that alcohol makes one high, at its 
highest levels of concentration in the body it can cause 
death by suppressing breathing. Although this outcome is 
extremely rare, it may occur after chugging large quanti-
ties of alcohol, a practice that is sometimes included in 
certain adolescent initiation rites and demonstrations of 
attention seeking. Deaths associated with fraternity initia-
tion activities on college campuses have brought the prac-
tice of chugging to heightened attention (“Parents Should 
Talk to College Students,” 1997). There are two other 
situations in which alcohol use has potentially lethal con-
sequences. One is the use of alcohol in combination with 
other drugs, especially barbiturates. The other is its use in 
combination with driving.
The physical development accompanying puberty leads 
to a heightened awareness of body sensations. In small 
quantities, alcohol has a relaxing effect that may accentuate

decline, most likely because they have had more experi-
ences, explored more, and have rarely encountered the nega-
tive consequences or have judged the consequences to be 
less serious than they expected. As a result, in the case of 
binge drinking, adolescents view the behavior as less risky as 
they get older.
In addition to the assessment of risk, some adolescents 
can be characterized by high levels of sensation seeking, 
including thrill seeking, adventure seeking, disinhibition, 
and susceptibility to boredom. Youth who have a great need 
for novel, complex sensory experiences may be willing to 
take physical risks in order to satisfy this need (Tang, Wong, 
& Schwarzer, 1996). Teens who have diffi culty conceptu-
alizing the future impact of their behaviors and who have 
a strong need for thrill seeking are more likely to become 
involved in frequent and heavy alcohol use (Robbins & 
Bryan, 2004).
The Social Contexts for Understanding 
Alcohol Misuse
Adolescent alcohol use takes place in a complex social envi-
ronment comprised of family, friends, school, and neighbor-
hood. Within each of these settings, three processes come 
into play: the extent to which adolescents are exposed to 
models who drink; the strength of the bond between the 
adolescent and those who either encourage or discourage 
drinking in each context; and exposure to stressors that 
might increase an adolescent’s feelings of distress and mag-
nify the inclination to use alcohol. A study of over 6,000 
adolescents ages 11 to 17 explored the importance of these 
four contexts in predicting alcohol misuse, and how these 
contexts might interact to infl uence drinking among teens 
(Ennett et al., 2008). Each context made an independent 
contribution to the likelihood that adolescents would misuse 
alcohol. The nature of the family environment was closely 
tied to an adolescent’s alcohol misuse. High levels of fam-
ily confl ict and alcohol use by parents were associated with 
a teen’s drinking. Family closeness and parental supervision 
were associated with less drinking. In the peer context, peer 
modeling of drinking was associated with teens’ drinking 
when the peer relationships were close and reciprocated. In 
the school and the neighborhood contexts, the most impor-
tant factor was the frequency of alcohol use by students 
or neighbors. There was also evidence of some interaction 
among contexts. When family supervision was high, teens 
were less likely to misuse alcohol even if their friends and 
schoolmates were drinking. When family confl ict and family 
alcohol use were high, teens were more likely to be infl u-
enced by their friends’ and schoolmates’ drinking.
Given the significance of social contexts and the 
socialization forces that may encourage or reward risky behav-
ior, it is important to keep sight of the role of self-selection in 
alcohol and drug use as well. Selection forces refer to the 
fact that some adolescents seek out friends who will support 
B1, is an essential nutrient required by all tissues, in-
cluding the brain. The cerebellum, an area of the brain 
responsible for coordinating movement and some forms 
of learning, appears to be particularly sensitive to the 
effects of thiamine defi ciency and is the region most 
frequently damaged in association with chronic alcohol 
consumption.
 3. Long-term drinking can damage the liver, the organ 
chiefl y responsible for breaking down alcohol into harm-
less by-products and clearing it from the body. Prolonged 
liver dysfunction, such as liver cirrhosis resulting from 
excessive alcohol consumption, can harm the brain, 
leading to a serious and potentially fatal brain disorder 
known as hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encepha-
lopathy can cause changes in sleep patterns, mood, and 
personality; psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and 
depression; severe cognitive effects such as shortened at-
tention span; and problems with coordination such as 
a fl apping or shaking of the hands. In the most serious 
cases, patients may slip into a coma (i.e., hepatic coma), 
which can be fatal.
Factors Associated with Alcohol Use
Let us look at some of the factors associated with the use 
of alcohol and the part it plays in the adolescent’s life. We 
are especially concerned about understanding the rela-
tionship between alcohol use and the major themes of 
early adolescence—cognitive development, parent-child 
relationships, and peer relations.
Assessment of Risk
Many adolescents do not view alcohol consumption as espe-
cially risky. In a national survey, about 30% of high school 
seniors saw daily drinking as involving great risk, and 47% 
of high school seniors saw binge drinking (five or more 
drinks once or twice over a weekend) as involving great risk 
(Johnston et al., 2007). In a summary of research about ado-
lescent decision making and risk taking, Reyna and Farley 
(2006) describe some of the characteristics of children and 
adolescents that may infl uence their behaviors:
Compared to adults, children and adolescents have been 
found to be less able to delay gratifi cation, inhibit their 
behavior, plan for or anticipate the future, spontaneously 
bring consequences to mind, or learn from negative con-
sequences; and adolescents do not view consequences as 
being as harmful as adults do, especially if risky behaviors 
are engaged in only once or twice. (p. 29)
In contrast to what is often said of adolescents, they typi-
cally see themselves as more vulnerable to negative conse-
quences than do adults, and overestimate their exposure to 
risks. However, after early adolescence, these overestimations

CHAPTER 9 Early Adolescence (12 to 18 Years)
and community. Although alcohol and drug use may be con-
sidered a normative rite of passage for most adolescents, it 
appears that children who begin to drink or use drugs early 
in adolescence—that is, before ninth grade—are especially 
vulnerable to more serious involvement with alcohol and 
drug use later (Murray, 1997). They experience some com-
bination of family, peer, and psychosocial pressures that 
increase their willingness to engage in deviant behavior and 
to ignore or minimize the risks. The risk factors associated 
with early alcohol and drug use are linked to social class and 
culture. Control over the sale of alcohol to minors, its cost, 
and the efforts of parents and other adults—including school 
offi cials and the police—to monitor its use among adoles-
cents are all community factors that influence the use of 
alcohol in early adolescence.
their involvement with alcohol or drugs as part of a more 
general pattern of deviance or thrill seeking, whereas other 
teens, who do not drink alcohol or use drugs, fi nd friends 
who support this position. Both factors—socialization pres-
sures toward alcohol and drug use and willingness to seek 
out peers who misuse drugs and alcohol—increase over the 
high school years, with a consequent increase in the likeli-
hood that adolescents will become involved in the misuse of 
alcohol and drugs themselves (Schulenberg & Maggs, 2001).
A combination of biological, psychological, and societal 
factors converge to make alcohol and drug use a part of 
the life of normal adolescents during the high school years. 
Experimentation with alcohol is relatively easy to under-
stand in the context of the adolescent’s psychosocial needs 
and the modeling of alcohol use in the family, peer group, 
Early adolescence provides vivid evidence of the interaction 
of the biological, psychological, and societal systems during 
a period of rapid growth and development.
Objective 1. To describe the patterns of physical 
maturation during puberty for female and male 
adolescents, including an analysis of the impact of 
early and late maturing on self-concept and social 
relationships.
The period is characterized by biological changes of 
puberty, new cognitive capacities, and a new range and 
intensity of emotional life. Rapid changes in height, 
weight, muscle strength, endurance, and reproduc-
tive capacities are accompanied by new roles, and new 
responses from others. The timing of puberty has impor-
tant and long-lasting implications for personal and social 
development.
Objective 2. To characterize the development of 
romantic and sexual relationships, including a focus 
on the transition to coitus, the formation of a sexual 
orientation, and factors associated with pregnancy and 
parenthood in adolescence.
Physical maturation is accompanied by new romantic feel-
ings and sexualized experiences, some desirable, and some 
unwanted. Most adolescents find ways to express sexual 
impulses in the context of socially acceptable practices. The 
majority of adolescents engage in forms of sexual behav-
ior, including intercourse, with its accompanying risks and 
rewards, by the end of high school. The transition into sex-
ual activity involves individual motivations, family and peer 
infl uences, attractiveness, and religious values and beliefs. 
Teens face a variety of challenges associated with early 
sexuality, including unwanted sexual attention, identifi cation 
and disclosure of an alternative sexual orientation, incon-
sistent contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, and 
unwanted pregnancy.
Objective 3. To introduce and critically evaluate 
the basic features of formal operational thought, 
highlighting the new conceptual skills that emerge in 
early adolescence and the factors that promote the 
development of advanced reasoning at this period of life.
The physical changes of adolescence are taking place in a 
context of new and more complex cognitive capacities. Ado-
lescence marks a period of brain development and sculpting 
leading to more advanced, abstract reasoning, and greater 
capacity to address complex, multidimensional problems. 
During this stage of life, the quality of experiences and the 
demands for higher-order thinking can play a signifi cant role 
in advancing a young person’s cognitive abilities.
Objective 4. To examine patterns of emotional 
development in early adolescence, including three 
examples of emotional disorders: eating disorders, 
delinquency, and depression.
Emotional development is characterized by a more diverse 
range of emotions, greater awareness of one’s emotions, and 
for most teens, a growing capacity to express and control 
the expression of emotions. After puberty, boys tend to have 
more problems coping with anger and aggression, girls have 
more problems coping with anxiety and depression.

relationships, and new respect from parents, teachers, and 
peers refl ect some of the positive consequences of effective 
coping. In the process of resolving this confl ict, most ado-
lescents experience moments of alienation, a sense of sep-
arateness and disconnection, out of which can grow a new 
personal confi dence or a deep well of resentment and rage. 
The threat of peer rejection may push those adolescents who 
lack confi dence in their own worth to violate essential values 
in the pursuit of acceptance.
Objective 7. To review the patterns of adolescent 
alcohol and drug use and the factors associated with 
their use and abuse within a psychosocial framework.
Teenage pregnancy, drug addiction, drunkenness, and seri-
ous delinquent behavior all refl ect adolescents’ capacity to 
engage in high-risk behaviors that have a great potential for 
modifying the life course and exposing them to new and 
serious physical and emotional hazards. Alcohol misuse, 
which is common among U.S. teens, takes place in a context 
of family, peer, school and community forces that constrain 
or encourage drinking and drunkenness.
Objective 5. To describe the further evolution of peer 
relations in early adolescence, especially the formation 
of cliques and crowds, and to contrast the impact of 
parents and peers during this stage.
The radius of signifi cant relationships expands as adolescents 
enter new roles and new settings. Parents continue to be an 
important source of reassurance and support. However, the 
period is characterized by strong desires to fi nd membership 
and acceptance among peers. Within this context, adoles-
cents seek like-minded peers and are open to peer infl uence.
Objective 6. To describe the psychosocial crisis of 
group identity versus alienation, the central process 
through which the crisis is resolved, peer pressure, the 
prime adaptive ego quality of fi delity to others, and the 
core pathology of isolation.
The crisis of group identity versus alienation involves a 
potential tension between the I and the we, the desire to 
feel meaningfully connected to a valued group and, at the 
same time, to have an authentic, autonomous sense of self.

Further Reflection
 1. Think back on your early adolescence, from the age of 
about 12 to the end of high school. How would you char-
acterize that time of your life? What are some examples 
of experiences that made you feel competent and self-
assured? What are examples of experiences that led to 
feelings of inferiority or self-doubt?
 2. Consider the role of friendship during this period 
of life. How did your friendships change from mid-
dle childhood to adolescence? Can you recall being 
part of a clique? A crowd? How would you describe 
those groups in terms of attitudes, values, dress, ori-
entation toward school, or involvement in high-risk

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
There is general agreement among human develop-
ment scholars that the years from about 18 through 24 
are a distinct stage of development, separate from early 
adolescence and from early adulthood. Studies from a 
variety of industrialized countries confi rm the idea that 
young people in these societies have characteristics 
that distinguish them from younger teens, especially ad-
vanced cognitive reasoning abilities, intensive personal 
identity exploration, a feeling of being somewhere in 
between childhood and adulthood, and a preoccupa-
tion with future possibilities. These features are tied 
to cultural conditions, including a prolonged period of 
education and training before entry into and invest-
ment in an occupational role, delayed age at marriage 
and childbearing, and diffi culties becoming fi nancially 
self-suffi cient (Arnett, 2006; Sirsch, Dreher, Mayr, & 
 Willinger, 2009).
What should we call this stage of life? Despite a grow-
ing trend in the fi eld of human development to refer to 
this as the stage of emerging adulthood, we prefer the 
term later adolescence for the following reasons:
 1. Adulthood, a status that is socially and culturally con-
structed, is becoming an increasingly elusive state, 
diffi cult to defi ne or achieve. The adult transition is 
considered to be completed when three or more of 
the following fi ve criteria have been achieved: leaving 
home, completing one’s education, becoming fi nan-
cially independent, getting married, and, for most, 
having children (Furstenberg, 2010). Figure 10.1
 1. To examine the concept of autonomy from parents 
and the conditions under which autonomy is likely 
to be achieved.
 2. To trace the development of gender identity in later 
adolescence, including a discussion of how the com-
ponents of gender role identifi cation that were rel-
evant during the early-school-age period are revised 
and expanded.
 3. To describe the maturation of morality in later ado-
lescence, with special focus on the role of new cog-
nitive capacities that infl uence moral judgments and 
the various value orientations that underlie moral 
reasoning.
 4. To analyze the process of career choice, with atten-
tion to education and gender role socialization as 
two major infl uential factors.
 5. To defi ne and describe the psychosocial crisis of 
later adolescence, individual identity versus identity 
confusion; the central process through which this 
crisis is resolved, role experimentation; the prime 
adaptive ego quality of fi delity to values and ideals; 
and the core pathology of repudiation.
 6. To examine some of the predictors and conse-
quences of dropping out of college.

the age period of 18 to 24 years. We prefer the term 
later adolescence because it connotes a process of con-
tinued growth and maturation prior to adulthood. The 
executive decision-making capacities of the frontal cor-
tex are still maturing, suggesting that later adolescents 
have new abilities for refl ection, problem solving, and 
planning. For many, this is a period of exploration, ex-
perimentation, and self-development. As one author 
described it, “between the late teens and late 20s . . . 
young Americans experience their ‘odyssey years,’ a 
time of wandering on the path to maturity” (Boonstra, 
2009, p. 13).
Others, an estimated 15% of youth ages 16 to 24, are 
disconnected; they are not in school, and they are not 
employed. Some are in jail, others are homeless or dis-
abled, and others have been released from foster care 
but are having diffi culty achieving independent lives (Hair 
et al., 2009).
Later adolescence is a time of fewer constraints and 
greater self-determination than early adolescence. Young 
people in the age range 18 to 24 do not have to be in 
school even though many are. New legal rights and priv-
ileges become available. This is a time when life paths 
become increasingly divergent as young people make 
choices and pursue their goals. But, by and large, these 
paths are experimental and temporary, refl ecting the 
fl exibility of the stage and the lack of urgency to make 
long-term commitments.
The years from 18 to 24 are characterized by a 
heightened sensitivity to the process of identity devel-
opment. Personal identity is developed as an individual 
struggles to answer the questions, “What is the mean-
ing of my life? Who am I? Where am I headed?” Most 
young people are cognitively complex enough to con-
jure up alternative scenarios about their own future, in-
cluding possible kinds of work and various meaningful 
relationships. They struggle with the uncertainty of hav-
ing to choose many of their own life’s directions. This 
period is often characterized by a high level of anxiety. 
Even though most young people are energetic and ca-
pable, they are also troubled by the lack of certainty 
about their future. Some worry whether they will be 
able to succeed in a chosen direction; others may be 
anxious because they do not even know what direction 
they wish to take. ■
provides a comparison of the percentage of men 
and women at three ages who completed all fi ve of 
these markers of adult status by age 20, 25, and 30 
in 1960 and 2000. In 1960 this transition into adult-
hood was very unusual for men and women aged 20, 
but common for young men aged 25 and normative 
for young women aged 25. By 2000, it was no longer 
normative for all fi ve markers of adult status to be 
achieved by men or women at age 25 or 30. These 
data illustrate that adulthood is not emerging in the 
period of 18 to 24 years, but in fact, is further away 
than it was 40 years ago.
 2. In contemporary industrialized or post-industrial-
ized countries, young people are enrolling in post-
secondary education at greater rates than ever 
before. This includes associates degree, bachelor’s 
degree, and professional degree programs. The 
student status has been extended, a status that is 
by defi nition transitional as one moves toward a 
level of new knowledge and expertise. Typically the 
student status delays full-time entry into the labor 
market, and fosters a prolonged period of transi-
tional or temporary residential identifi cation with a 
community.
 3. The age at fi rst marriage is approaching 30. Although 
the majority of young people in the age range 18 to 
24 are sexually active, their relationships are tempo-
rary. Relatively few young people in the age range 18 
to 24 are involved in relationships that they expect 
will result in marriage.
 4. The economic recession of the last 3 years has re-
sulted in a growing number of young people who 
are out of work, underemployed, or working at jobs 
that are viewed as temporary. The percentage of 
young people in this age group who can support 
themselves is declining even further than it was in 
2000.
 5. Almost half of people ages 20 to 24 years who are 
not married live with their parents. One of the recent 
changes in the U.S. health policy was a provision to 
allow young people to remain on their parents’ health 
insurance policies until age 26. These are just two 
 indications of the continued fi nancial dependence 
of young people on their parents.
The prospects of making a behavioral,  psychological, 
or social transition into adulthood is not emerging in

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
early adolescence, a young person’s autonomy is expressed 
in personal preferences and tastes that are considered legiti-
mate domains for decision making. In later adolescence, a 
young person’s cognitive maturity provides problem-solving 
abilities, the ability to consider multiple perspectives and to 
evaluate information from multiple sources, and a capac-
ity to plan for the future, all of which support new levels of 
autonomous reasoning about important life choices. As later 
adolescents become more autonomous in thought, they are 
able to refl ect upon their parents’ opinions and advice, and 
to set these views next to their own as well as the views of 
peers or other mentors or authorities in order to decide what 
makes sense for them.
The concept of differentiation, which emerged from 
family systems theory, has been associated with emotional 
maturity and a healthy emergence of individuality in adoles-
cence. Differentiation is the extent to which a social system 
encourages intimacy while supporting the expression of dif-
ferences (Bomar & Sabatelli, 1996). Within the family con-
text, identity exploration is facilitated by an open exchange 
of ideas and a certain level of challenge. Adolescents must 
have opportunities to express their separateness within the 
boundaries of the family. They must feel that their parents 
accept and understand their need to have distinct opinions 
and views. This takes place as parents support their child’s 
quest for autonomy and encourage their child to express 
new ideas and differing points of view without making them 
feel guilty when they disagree (Best, Hauser, & Allen, 1997). 
Adolescents who experience high levels of parental control 
and frequent exposure to parental confl ict are likely to have 
difficulties in achieving a comfortable sense of autonomy 
(Taylor & Oskay, 1995). Ideally, individuality is achieved in 
a context of mutual caring and emotional support. A secure 
attachment to parents, based on a perception of them as 
committed to their child’s well-being, is essential for growth 
toward independence (Palladino-Schultheiss & Blustein, 
1994; Perosa, Perosa, & Tam, 1996; Buhl, 2007).
The meaning a young person gives to achieving auton-
omy from parents varies depending on personal, family, 
and cultural values, such as commitment to education, 
fi nancial independence, and marriage. For example, some 
cultural groups are more accustomed to living in mul-
tigenerational families and place great value on the fi lial 
bond between children and their parents. Parents in these 
cultures may be more comfortable with the idea of having 
their later adolescent children living in their home with-
out paying rent, and the children may perceive it as part 
of their obligation to stay near their parents and grandpar-
ents in order to provide them with social and instrumental 
support. In contrast, in some cultures, families expect their 
later adolescent children to achieve residential separate-
ness. They may expect that children ages 18 to 24 who 
are living at home will contribute to the cost of housing. 
Paths toward autonomy are also infl uenced by the young 
person’s family context. For example, children living with 
their two biological parents are likely to leave home later 
Developmental Tasks
Autonomy from Parents
Objective 1. To examine the concept of autonomy from 
parents and the conditions under which autonomy is 
likely to be achieved.
Achieving a psychological sense of autonomy from one’s 
parents is a multidimensional task that is faced gradually 
over the course of later adolescence and early adulthood. 
 Autonomy from parents is the ability to regulate one’s 
behavior and to select and guide one’s decisions and actions 
in order to achieve meaningful personal goals without undue 
control from or dependence on one’s parents. Autonomy 
suggests that decisions and behaviors are guided by personal 
will; they are voluntary rather than imposed or controlled 
by others (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Autonomy is not the same 
as rejection, alienation, or physical separation from parents. 
Rather, it is an independent psychological status in which 
parents and children accept each other’s individuality. Many 
areas of similarity between parents and children may pro-
vide bonds for a continued close, supportive relationship 
into adulthood. However, those bonds are re-created in later 
adolescence and early adulthood through a process of self-
defi nition. Adolescents who achieve autonomy can recognize 
and accept both the similarities and the differences between 
themselves and their parents, while still feeling a sense of 
love, understanding, and connection with them.
Autonomy may refer to independence of behavior, 
thoughts, and emotions (Steinberg, 2005). Much of the psy-
chosocial development that has occurred before this stage 
can be understood as preparing the individual for behavioral 
independence from his parents. Such skills as dressing one-
self, handling money, cooking, driving a car, reading, and 
writing have been mastered. Many of these skills are incor-
porated into the concept of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), 
a measure that is used to assess the self-suffi ciency of older 
adults. Although it is easy to take these skills for granted, 
they are essential for someone who is living independently. 
The physical maturation that has taken place also contrib-
utes to the possibility of autonomy. Daily survival requires 
a certain amount of physical strength, coordination, and 
endurance—qualities that accompany the physical maturity 
of adolescence.
Beyond these physical requirements, autonomy involves 
a psychological sense of confi dence about one’s unique point 
of view and an ability to express opinions and beliefs that 
may differ from those of one’s parents (Herman, Dornbusch, 
Herron, & Herting, 1997). In early school age, the process of 
identifi cation and the accompanying internalization of paren-
tal values allow the young child to function with a sense of 
what is appropriate behavior. In early adolescence, the child’s 
ability to emerge from the intimacy of the family may also be 
promoted by a growing involvement with the peer group. In

be unwilling to provide the fi nancial resources that would 
make this level of autonomy possible.
Given the variety of living arrangements that are now 
common in later adolescence, questions are being raised 
about the relationship of living arrangements to well-being. 
Do young people who continue to live at home with their 
parents have the same sense of well-being and life satisfac-
tion as young people who live in some type of group situa-
tion with other friends or who live independently? There are 
some confl icting views about this. Some studies show that 
later adolescents who live with peers or on their own have a 
more adult-like view of themselves, and get along better with 
their parents than those who live with their parents (White, 
2002). Other studies show that later adolescents who have 
a good relationship with their parents are more likely to live 
with them for a longer period (Lanz & Tagliabue, 2007). 
When there is a stepparent involved or frequent conflict 
with parents, later adolescents may feel pushed out into 
independent living. In a study of Belgian later adolescents, 
three types of living arrangements were related to well-being: 
living at home with parents, living with other students but 
returning home frequently, and living independently with 
a partner or alone. In this study, the most important factor 
was the young person’s sense that the living arrangement was 
of their own choosing. In addition, later adolescents whose 
parents supported their autonomous decision were most 
confi dent about their decision and had the greatest sense of 
well-being, regardless of whether they lived at home with 
their parents, with friends, or on their own (Kins, Beyers, 
Soenens, & Vansteenkiste, 2009).
Autonomy and the College Experience
Going away to college is an intermediate step between liv-
ing at home and establishing a permanent residence in early 
adulthood. The mere act of going to college does not in itself 
bring a sense of leaving home or of psychological autonomy 
from one’s parents. In fact, most students do not go far from 
home when they enter college as freshmen; roughly 80% 
attend college in their home state (Chronicle of Higher Educa-
tion, 2009). Many students continue to live at home while 
they attend college, and most still request and receive both 
emotional and instrumental support from their parents.
Some college-age students are more ready than others to 
embrace the demands for new levels of independence and 
responsibility. College freshmen express a variety of attitudes 
that suggest different views about their desire to be indepen-
dent from their family. Of students entering college in the 
fall of 2004, 21% said that an important reason for deciding 
to go to college was to get away from home, whereas 42% 
said that an important reason was that their parents wanted 
them to go. When asked about reasons that were important 
in selecting the specifi c college that they ended up attending, 
20% of those attending their fi rst-choice college said they 
wanted to live near home (CIRP, 2006). As they enter col-
lege, students differ markedly in how much work they have 
than are children living in a stepfamily. Three components 
of achieving autonomy from parents are discussed in the 
following sections: leaving home, attending college, and 
self-suffi ciency.
Autonomy and Leaving Home
Living away from one’s parents’ household may be a symbol 
of independence; however, it is not as readily achievable in 
the age range from 18 to 24 as it was in the past. Before 
about 1960, marriage was the most traditional reason for 
moving to a new residence, other than leaving temporar-
ily for college or the military. Since that time, however, the 
median age at marriage has increased, so that in 2008 87% 
of males and 79% of females in the age range from 20 to 
24 have never been married (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). 
Of those who have never married, almost half live at home 
with one or both parents. Few later adolescents live alone, 
but a large number, almost 25%, live in group arrange-
ments with nonfamily members including housemates, 
close friends, or intimate partners (U.S. Census Bureau, 
2009).
Parents and adolescent children have different views 
about the age at which children are expected to leave home. 
Parents tend to expect children to leave home at an older 
age—more closely tied to the expected age of marriage—
than do adolescent children. Also, parents expect daughters 
to live at home longer than sons. However, these differ-
ences are not refl ected in the expectations of the adolescents 
themselves. Thus, this issue is a potential source of family 
confl ict. Family structure is also associated with the age of 
leaving home. Children in single-parent families and girls 
in stepfamilies leave at an earlier age (Cooney & Mortimer, 
1999).
Economic factors and social norms play a significant 
role in the timing of leaving home. A child’s ability to live 
away from home may depend on whether the family is 
willing and fi nancially able to provide support during this 
period. This, in turn, depends in part on the family’s val-
ues and the later adolescent’s values. For example, many 
families are strongly committed to having their children 
complete college and are willing to provide fi nancial sup-
port while the child is away at school. However, if the child 
gets married while still in college, some families may feel 
that their fi nancial obligation to support the child is over. 
Some parents are willing to support their children who are 
away from home if the child is in college, but not willing to 
provide support if the child wants to live away from home 
but not attend school (Goldscheider, Thornton, & Yang, 
2001). Imagine that, after 1 or 2 years of college, a child 
wants to move to a new city, live with a same-sex partner, 
and seek opportunities in the entertainment industry. Some 
parents might encourage this path toward self- discovery; 
others might consider it risky, immoral, or frivolous. 
When children and parents disagree about the appropri-
ate path toward self-reliance and adulthood, parents may

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
Overall, the relationship between my parents and I has been 
a growing mutual respect. (Arnett, 2004a, p. 215)
In other cases, going to college represents a move toward 
upward mobility and a decision to seek a life path quite dif-
ferent from one’s parents. Even when parents are supportive 
of a child’s college attendance, the experiences of college may 
introduce their child to new ideas, values, and interests that 
create confl ict. Parents who have not attended college may 
not understand what their child is doing, why it is important 
or valued, or how their child’s involvement in certain classes 
or campus activities will lead to economic betterment. For 
some, this distance is gradually bridged as parents become 
familiar with their children’s lives, and children become 
more skilled at giving parents ways of understanding what 
already done toward achieving autonomy from their parents, 
how much they desire autonomy, and what evidence they 
use to determine whether they have achieved autonomy.
Revision of Attachment to Parents
The experience of entering college focuses new attention on 
the changing quality of the attachment relationship between 
college students and their parents. Students who live at college 
are more likely to rely on the mental representations of their 
attachment fi gures, whereas students who live with their par-
ents continue to be involved daily with concrete interactions. 
Issues of autonomy and control, establishing new guidelines 
and limits related to participation in family life, involvement 
in relationships with peers, and management of time and 
money are resolved in the absence of direct input from parents 
for most students who live at college, but these decisions con-
tinue to involve parental input for students who live at home.
For students who live on campus, preoccupation with 
thoughts and concerns about their parents tend to diminish 
over the course of the fi rst semester, while new relationships 
form and a new confi dence in their independent decision 
making builds. The attachment scheme or representation, 
rather than the actual interactions with parents, is what 
becomes modifi ed. Many students who attend college away 
from home begin to have more positive thoughts and feelings 
about their parents. At the same time, they begin to detect a 
new level of confi dence and respect from their parents, who 
appreciate that their children are managing to take on new 
responsibilities and to make good decisions on their own.
Over the past year I have become very close with my dad. 
Before college there was a defi nite parent-child relationship 
with my father. Now he is more like a mentor or friend. 
Students who go away to col-
lege use their group identity 
skills to form new relation-
ships while cre ating a physical 
environment that preserves a 
connection to family, friends, 
and home.

they might disagree about this issue. One of the items was: 
“My parents will give me money when I ask for it.” The fol-
lowing responses illustrate the point of view of a student 
who would like to be as fi nancially self-suffi cient as possible, 
and the point of view of a parent who wants her daughter to 
know that there are some limits to the kind of support she 
can expect (Kenyon & Koerner, 2009, p. 307).
18-YEAR-OLD FEMALE: I think one of the things we would dis-
agree about is money. My father is helping me with rent, 
and both of my parents are helping me fi nancially, when I 
need it. They want me to come to them if I need money, but 
I want to be able to do things on my own, without having 
to run to mommy or daddy whenever I need money. They 
don’t mind helping me out, but I would like to try and get 
by on my own as much as I can. It will be easier when I get 
a job.
44-YEAR-OLD MOTHER: She will think that I will give her 
money for 99% of the things that she thinks is important 
and that is not going to be the case. I will give her money 
when she needs it for the important things that you need to 
live on or with. No shopping sprees for the heck of it!
With respect to fi nancial independence, roughly 50% of 
college students who are enrolled full time are also employed. 
In a comparison of young people in the age range 22 to 26 
in six countries including the United States and Canada, evi-
dence suggests that over the past 20 years there has been a 
decline in the percentage of later adolescents who are able 
to support themselves as defi ned by wages and salary above 
50% of the national adjusted disposable personal income for 
their country (Bell, Burtless, Gornick, & Smeeding, 2007). In 
2007, 17.3% of those in the 18 to 24 age range had incomes 
below the poverty level. This rate varied by race/ethnicity: 
15% of White adolescents, 28% of Black adolescents, 14% 
of Asian and Pacifi c Islanders, and 22% of Hispanics (U.S. 
Census Bureau, 2010). All these data contribute to the pat-
tern of delays in self-suffi ciency and the postponement of an 
independent lifestyle.
One obstacle to the sense of fi nancial self-suffi ciency is 
the increasing burden of debt faced by many college stu-
dents. In addition to their student loans, 84% of students 
have credit cards. According to a survey conducted in 2009 
by Sallie Mae, half of all college students have four credit 
cards or more. The median balance on these cards was 
$1,645. Seniors were graduating with an average balance of 
$4,100 and 20% of seniors owed $7,000 or more. Over 90% 
of college students reported charging educational expenses 
including books, supplies, and tuition on their credit cards 
(Sallie Mae, 2009; Woolsey & Schulz, 2010). Many students 
with credit card debt feel forced to put jobs ahead of school 
in order to keep up with payments, and when faced with 
academic hearings, some students mention working multi-
ple jobs to pay on debts as reasons for poor academic per-
formance. Consequences of credit card debt among college 
students may include working multiple jobs; dropping out 
of school; postponing graduate school; starting off careers 
they are doing. For others, as in the case of Mary, the dis-
tance widens over time:
I go home, we talk about the weather, talk about people 
in the family, people in the neighborhood. . . . The stuff 
I would like to talk about, [my mother] can’t. She doesn’t 
understand it. Stuff she’d like to talk about I think would 
be incredibly boring. . . . I learned very early on that they 
couldn’t discuss [school]. To try to discuss it with them 
would be very frustrating to me, and embarrassing for 
them. . . . I realized I had far educated myself past my par-
ents. (Roberts & Rosenwald, 2001, p. 102)
Students who live at home while attending college tend to 
continue to be preoccupied by concerns and thoughts about 
their parents based on their actual daily interactions, and the 
quality of their relationships involves more confl ict (Sullivan & 
Sullivan, 1980; Berman & Sperling, 1991).
The relationship between emotional closeness and liv-
ing at home appears to be culturally shaped. For example, 
in the United States, later adolescents who live at home and 
have frequent daily interactions with their parents tend to 
be least close to them. In comparison, studies of European 
later adolescents fi nd that young people who live at home 
are quite happy with their living arrangements, find their 
parents to be an important source of emotional support, and 
experience considerable autonomy in the context of their 
parents’ household (Arnett, 2000). The box on attachment 
and identity formation provides more detail on the relation-
ship of parental attachment to identity formation in later 
adolescence.
The delay in age at marriage also has implications for the 
revision of the parental attachment relationship. When the 
majority of young people in the 20 to 24 age range were 
married, it was normal to expect that some of the emotional 
investment in one’s family of origin would shift to the new 
intimate marital bond. Thus, emotional distancing from 
one’s parents made sense in the context of forming a cul-
turally approved marital commitment. Today, many young 
people have deeply valued love relationships, but they are 
not married and are not ready to make lifelong commitments 
to these relationships. This results in lengthening the period 
when both children and parents may feel that the child’s pri-
mary emotional attachment is to the family of origin.
Autonomy and Self-Suffi ciency
Despite the variety of life paths and demographic character-
istics of those in the period of later adolescence, most young 
people can recognize when they have achieved a sense of 
autonomy from their parents. One important underlying 
theme is a sense of self-suffi ciency, which is expressed by 
making independent decisions, taking responsibility for 
one’s actions, and achieving a degree of fi nancial indepen-
dence. In order to gain a clearer idea of how college students 
and their parents view issues related to fi nancial self-suffi -
ciency, researchers asked students and their parents to select 
a question from a survey about autonomy and write why

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
novel and nontraditional perspectives. The growth that takes 
place during the period of later adolescence in each of these 
areas refl ects a willingness to evaluate multiple perspectives 
and to integrate personal commitments with societal expec-
tations and resources.
Gender Identity
Objective 2. To trace the development of gender 
identity in later adolescence, including a discussion of 
how the components of gender role identifi cation that 
were relevant during the early-school-age period are 
revised and expanded.
In later adolescence, new and important revisions and elab-
orations of the child’s earlier work on gender identifi cation 
are taking place (see Chapter 7). The formulation of gender 
identity refers to the acquisition of a set of beliefs, attitudes, 
and values about oneself as a man or a woman in many areas 
with high debts; poor credit ratings leading to an inability 
to obtain loans, continue education, or acquire a job; and 
bankruptcy (Mannix, 1999; Norvilitis & Santa Maria, 2002; 
Lyons, 2004).
A sense of self-suffi ciency goes beyond personal income. 
It is a subjective experience that is distinct from a person’s 
living arrangement, student status, having a steady job, or 
being in a serious love relationship. A subjective sense of 
self-suffi ciency is achieved gradually as young people face 
and meet important challenges of school, work, and fam-
ily life and build a degree of confi dence in their capacity to 
make good decisions.
The process of achieving autonomy from parents opens 
the door to new considerations of basic ego structures, 
including gender identity, morality, and career aspirations. In 
each of these areas, a young person has the opportunity to 
decenter—to step back from the close socialization pressures 
of family and neighborhood—and construct her own point 
of view. After a period of role experimentation and introspec-
tion, some may choose to adopt the framework that was in 
place at the end of the high school years. Others may invent 
Attachment and 
Identity Formation
IDENTITY FORMATION IS usually 
viewed as a process that requires young 
people to distance themselves from 
the strong expectations and defi nitions 
imposed by parents and other family 
members. To achieve an individual 
identity, one must create a vision of 
the self that is authentic—a sense of 
having taken hold of one’s destiny 
in an effort to reach goals that are 
personally meaningful. Yet research has 
demonstrated that the quality of family 
relationships contributes signifi cantly 
to a young person’s ability to achieve a 
personal identity (Allen & Land, 1999).
The relationship can be compared 
with the contribution of a secure 
attachment in infancy to a subsequent 
willingness to explore the environment. 
Securely attached infants will move 
away physically from their caregiver, 
confi dent that the caregiver will be 
available when they are in need of 
help. For later adolescents, autonomy-
seeking behaviors can be interpreted 
as a more advanced form of the 
exploratory activities observed in infancy. 
Later adolescents who have a secure 
relationship with their parents and who 
are comfortable in loosening these ties 
can begin to explore the ideological, 
occupational, and interpersonal 
alternatives that will become the content 
for their own identities.
Attachment to parents has been 
measured in later adolescence and 
adulthood using the Adult Attachment 
Interview (AAI), which asks participants 
to describe their relationship with 
their parents when they were younger, 
including specifi c memories of that 
relationship; recall incidences of 
distress in the relationship; and discuss 
factors that have infl uenced their 
relationship (George, Kaplan, & Main, 
1996). The interview is then coded 
to characterize the attachment state 
of mind as (1) autonomous, which 
is refl ective of an open, coherent 
narrative about the parent-child 
relationship; (2) dismissive, which is 
refl ective of minimizing the importance 
of the parent-child relationship, 
inability to recall many details, and a 
tendency to idealize one’s parents; 
or (3) preoccupied, which is refl ective 
of continuing anger toward one’s 
parents and a confused, vague, or 
passive narrative (Bernier et al., 
2004). Interviews with students at the 
beginning and end of the fi rst year of 
college found that the preoccupied 
students had the most diffi culty 
adapting to college and actually did 
worse with respect to adjustment and 
grades as the year went along. These 
students had the greatest diffi culty 
transferring their emotional investment 
from parents to peers, even if that 
investment was negative (Bernier et al., 
2004).
Male and female college students 
who have a positive attachment to 
their mothers are more likely to have 
an achieved identity and are less likely 
to be in a moratorium or identity-
confused status than are students who 
have insecure, mistrustful relationships 
with their mothers. On the other hand, 
those who are still emotionally depen-
dent on their parents and require 
constant reassurance of their affection 
show a greater tendency to experience 
identity confusion (Benson, Harris, & 
Rogers, 1992).
By the time young people reach 
later adolescence, those who are 
securely attached to their parents are 
confi dent about parental affection and

woman is called a mother. Both are parenting roles, but gen-
der is identifi ed, and each role is associated with somewhat 
different expectations.
All cultures construct gender-differentiated roles, and 
people expect one another to behave in certain ways because 
they are male or female. Perhaps more important, they form 
expectations of how men and women ought to act when they 
are together, so that the distinctions between the genders are 
demarcated (Freud, 1994). These expectations are taught 
and learned, beginning early in life. For later adolescents, 
the gendered nature of the family is an especially important 
factor in shaping gender identity. Family experiences from 
the past provide the gender script with which they are most 
familiar. The family life they envision for themselves in the 
future creates many of the priorities that shape their current 
commitments and goals (Valsiner, 2000).
In the United States, many people argue that gender-
based role distinctions are inappropriate, at least as a part 
of public life. They believe that men and women should be 
considered equal and treated identically in all public matters. 
But in many cultures, there are distinct, agreed-upon norms 
of social life, including intimate relations, family, work, com-
munity, and religion. The developmental task of forming 
one’s gender identity refl ects the need to integrate and syn-
thesize the three basic components of gender—its biological, 
psychological, and social meanings—into a view of oneself 
as a man or a woman entering the complex social world of 
adult life.
The Role of Culture
As discussed in Chapter 3, according to social role theory, 
roles are basic building blocks of social organizations. Every 
organization, including a family, a workplace, a commu-
nity, and a culture, can be described by its roles. Individu-
als learn the roles of their social system throughout their 
lives. Through the socialization process, people internalize 
the expectations associated with many life roles and apply 
the socially shared norms and standards linked to these roles 
to their own behaviors. This process occurs with respect to 
gender-related roles as well as to kinship, age, occupation, 
and other socially constructed roles. For example, when 
a person becomes a parent, a man is called a father and a 
support. At the same time, they trust 
in their own worth and in their ability 
to make decisions (Blain, Thompson, & 
Whiffen, 1993). In a study comparing 
university students who lived with 
their parents with those who lived 
away from home, those who lived 
away from their parents experienced 
more daily life challenges, but they 
also used more effective problem-
solving strategies to address those 
challenges. In comparison to students 
who lived at home, those who lived 
away from their parents had made 
more progress in the formation of their 
personal identity, suggesting that the 
pressures toward self-reliance may 
contribute to the clarifi cation of values 
and commitments (Jordyn & Byrd, 
2003). Later adolescents may make a 
point of not seeking parental support, 
but in a secure relationship, they 
know that help is available if needed. 
By imposing emotional distance and 
achieving greater self-reliance, later 
adolescents are able to reach a more 
objective evaluation of their parents as 
fi gures for identifi cation and, thereby, 
to create the needed space for the 
emergence of their own identity 
(Kobak, 1999).
A secure parental attachment fosters 
identity formation in the following ways:
• It fosters confi dence in the explora-
tion of social relationships, ideolo-
gies, and settings.
• It establishes positive expectations in 
regard to interpersonal experiences 
outside the family.
• It fosters the formation of group 
identities apart from the family, thus 
providing a transitional context for 
work on individual identity.
• It provides a basic layer of self-accep-
tance, permitting the young person 
to approach the process of identity 
formation with optimism.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. How does the typology of preoc-
cupied attachment correspond to 
the attachment styles described in 
the section on infant attachment in 
Chapter 5? What do you think the 
psychology of the preoccupied stu-
dents is like? Why might they have 
the greatest diffi culty adjusting to 
college?
 2. What is the relationship between 
a secure attachment in infancy and 
an autonomous attachment in later 
adolescence? What kinds of behav-
iors and attitudes would you expect 
to see among students who have an 
autonomous attachment style?
 3. How might the formation of an anx-
ious avoidant, an anxious resistant, or 
a disorganized attachment in infancy 
relate to work on identity in later 
adolescence?
 4. What might be some trade-offs be-
tween living at home with parents 
and living on campus with respect 
to identity formation and self-accep-
tance? How might cultural differences 
with regard to the values of indepen-
dence and interdependence infl uence 
the outcomes of this decision?
 5. How would you describe the optimal 
balance between autonomy from 
parents and connection to parents 
during the college years? What should 
parents do to try to achieve this bal-
ance? What should students do to try 
to achieve this balance? What should 
colleges and universities do to help 
families achieve this balance?
 6. What might be the impact of the 
three different attachment styles—
autonomous, dismissive, and preoc-
cupied—on later adolescents’ efforts 
to establish romantic relationships?

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
the meaning they will make of their own designation as male 
or female. The box on human development and diversity 
introduces the concept of the third gender, an idea that illus-
trates alternative pathways toward gender identity that exist 
in many cultures.
Reevaluating Gender Constancy
Each of the components of gender identifi cation discussed in 
Chapter 7 undergoes some transformation as work on gen-
der identity continues. Later adolescents can appreciate that 
the use of gender labels is a social convention and that, apart 
from the genital basis of this label, there are wide individual 
differences within gender groups in most traits and abilities. 
Moreover, information about genetic anomalies and medi-
cal technologies may lead later adolescents to realize that it 
is possible to have a confl ict between one’s genetic sex and 
one’s external genitalia.
Transsexuals develop a gender identity that is oppo-
site to their biological sex. They feel certain of their gender, 
which is at odds with their genital features. In these cases, 
the possibility of a sex-change operation provides an alter-
native to the notion of gender constancy (Crooks & Bauer, 
2005). One study followed the adjustment of 20 adolescent 
transsexuals who had experienced sex-reassignment surgery. 
In the 1 to 4 years following treatment, these young people 
were functioning well, and none of them expressed regrets 
about their decision (Smith, van Goozen, & Cohen-Kettenis, 
2001). Later adolescents may realize that one’s sex is not 
quite as fi xed and constant as they may have believed. Fur-
thermore, those who experience psychological confl ict about 
their gender may learn that a new designation is not only 
possible but desirable.
Reevaluating Earlier Gender Role Standards 
and Learning New Ones
Gender role expectations exist at the cultural, institutional, 
interpersonal, and individual levels. As later adolescents 
learn about these expectations, they must integrate and syn-
thesize them with their assessments of their personal needs 
and goals. The content of gender role standards—that is, the 
cultural and subcultural expectations concerning the appro-
priate behavior of male and female individuals—is different 
for later adolescents than for young children. This content 
changes as a result of changing age-related expectations and 
social change. For a 6- or 7-year-old boy, it may have been 
important to learn to be tough and not to cry or whimper, to 
stand up for himself, and not to hit girls. For a young man in 
later adolescence, the gender role expectations may include 
holding a steady job, demonstrating sexual prowess, or being 
competitive. For a 6- or 7-year-old girl, on the other hand, 
the emphasis may have been on taking turns, not being too 
bossy, and staying clean. For a young woman in later adoles-
cence, gender role expectations may focus on being a caring, 
supportive friend; expressing maternal, nurturant behavior; 
or having an attractive fi gure and knowing how to dress well.
prescribing differences in how men and women are treated, 
which tasks they are expected to perform, and what status 
they hold in their family and community. Often, these norms 
establish specifi c power differences as part of the gender dis-
tinctions. Typically, men have more power than women, but 
this is not always the case.
Others argue that men and women should be considered 
equal, but that they should be treated in ways that take into 
account the differences in their needs and capacities. For 
example, a bill introduced in the U.S. Congress required 
that all public places, such as auditoriums, stadiums, and 
theaters, have twice as many public bathroom facilities for 
women as for men to take into account the physiological and 
social differences in women’s toileting practices.
In the United States, and in many other industrialized 
nations, people are engaged in a wide-ranging dialogue about 
the scientifi c, legal, and sociohistorical bases of gender roles 
that is leading to a revision—perhaps even a  revolution—
in how gender serves as an organizing social structure. 
Although this dialogue takes place across many groups and 
in many contexts, there is still powerful pressure on young 
people to achieve their own personal gender identity. They 
may be infl uenced by voices and views in the larger society; 
however, later adolescents must decide for themselves about 
Cultures construct gender-differentiated roles. In the United 
States, the traditional attire of the bride and groom symbolize 
ideal images of feminine beauty and masculine respectability to 
which many young people aspire.

Developmental Tasks | 397
In later adolescence, young men and women begin to 
develop an analysis of what it takes to get ahead in their social 
world, whether success is defi ned as fi nding a mate, getting 
a good job, being a good parent, or being popular. They 
may learn to be more fl exible in their interpersonal behav-
ior, modifying their strategy to suit their goals. They discover 
that such traits as assertiveness, goal-directed behavior, com-
petitiveness, being a good communication partner, personal 
disclosure, and negotiation are all required in social situa-
tions, and they learn to develop and apply them as required. 
In previous generations, some of the aforementioned traits 
were considered masculine and some feminine. Today, how-
ever, they are perceived as helpful to both men and women 
to be able to succeed in work and family life.
Gender role standards may change from one generation 
to the next, so that parents who are socializing their chil-
dren may have grown up with one set of gender-role expec-
tations, but their children may enter later adolescence with 
a very different set of norms and expectations. For exam-
ple, in a national survey of college freshmen, students were 
asked to respond to a number of statements about attitudes 
and values. One of those statements was, “Activities of mar-
ried women are best confi ned to home and family.” In 1970, 
48% of freshmen agreed with that statement; in 2004, only 
21% of freshmen agreed (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1996; 
Chronicle of Higher Education, 2005). One could speculate 
that many of the parents who were college freshmen in the 
1970s had more traditional gender role attitudes than their 
children have today. Historical trends modify the outlook 
of both men and women on their appropriate and norma-
tive roles.
As one considers the contemporary context of gender role 
expectations, it appears that the main U.S. culture is moving 
toward more fl exible standards. For example, it is recognized 
that it benefi ts both men and women in the workplace to 
be appropriately assertive and to be sensitive communica-
tors. Many gender-stereotyped expectations about behaviors 
that are appropriate for men or women have been relaxed 
and replaced by a greater diversity of behavior that is con-
sidered acceptable for both men and women in our society. 
The greatest impact of this revision is on the later adolescent 
population as they formulate their gender identities. There 
are more options, choices, and goals, and fewer obstacles to 
expressing personal preferences.
Within this context of greater freedom from gender 
role stereotypes, however, certain ethnic groups face new 
confl icts between adhering to traditional cultural expecta-
tions and embracing gender roles that are less scripted. 
For example, Latinas experience a strong cultural empha-
sis on the role of women as mothers who are nurturant, 
virtuous, and devoted to their husbands and children. 
This gender role standard places pressure on them to 
restrict their occupational aspirations and to remain 
close to their family of origin, particularly when it comes 
to thinking about going to college or planning a career 
(Chilman, 1993). In later adolescence, Latinas must 
review these expectations, weighing the benefi ts they have 
had from this kind of close, attentive mothering with their 
own changing desire for higher levels of educational and 
occupational attainment. As economic demands and edu-
cational opportunities have expanded, Latinas have found 
ways to satisfy their community’s traditional expectations 
while still claiming some space for their own personal 
goals (Denner & Dunbar, 2004).
Revising Childhood Identifi cations
The component of parental identifi cation that contributes 
to gender identity is also reviewed and revised in later ado-
lescence. During this time, young people begin to encoun-
ter a wide range of possible targets for identifi cation. In the 
college environment, students meet teachers, residence hall 
counselors, and older students whose views and values may 
differ widely from those of their parents. Outside the col-
lege environment, workers meet supervisors, other workers, 
and social companions whose views and values may differ 
widely from those of their parents. Later adolescents may 
admire public figures, such as religious leaders, political 
leaders, artists, or scholars whose work and ideas are espe-
cially inspiring. In the process, later adolescents revisit the 
content of their parental identifi cations. They analyze those 
beliefs, attitudes, and values that they may have swallowed 
whole as children, evaluating which of them are still rele-
vant to their own personal vision of themselves function-
ing as a man or a woman in their current situation. They 
try to determine whether the lessons they learned as chil-
dren about how husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, 
and men and women treat each other and think about each 
other remain applicable.
Adding a Sexual Dimension to 
Gender Identity
In addition to revisions in parental identifi cations, later ado-
lescents add a sexual dimension to their gender identity. 
Biological changes of puberty, including changes in repro-
ductive capacities, secondary sex characteristics, body shape, 
height, weight, and strength, must be incorporated into one’s 
gender identity.
Satisfaction with one’s physical appearance provides 
an important basis for approaching social relations with a 
positive, optimistic outlook (Abell & Richards, 1996). Fur-
thermore, it may influence one’s attractiveness or initial 
desirability as a sexual partner. In contrast, dissatisfaction 
with one’s physical appearance as integrated into the self-
concept may interfere with the formation of positive social 
relationships, causing the person to approach interpersonal 
contacts with self-consciousness and a pessimistic expecta-
tion that he will be rejected.
Maturation of the hormonal system, which influences 
emotional arousal as well as sexual urges, contributes to the 
development of one’s gender identity. The hormonal changes 
of puberty bring new sexual impulses as well as the capacity 

398 | 
CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
secondary sex characteristics that make women more sexu-
ally attractive. In general, hormone levels are not as good a 
predictor of sexual activity for women as are the social con-
texts of family and peer group and the woman’s own inter-
nalized standards about sexual behavior (Savin-Williams & 
Diamond, 2004).
The domain of sexual activity is one of the few remain-
ing vestiges of the double standard for male and female gen-
der roles. As we pointed out in Chapter 9, it has become 
normative for both males and females to engage in sexual 
intercourse during their adolescence. However, there is a 
persistent set of social norms that advantages males who are 
sexually active, and places sexually active females at risk for 
damaging their reputation. A male who is known to have 
multiple sexual partners may be viewed as a stud, whereas a 
female who is known to have multiple sexual partners may 
be viewed as easy, fast, or a slut.
for reproduction. Hormonal changes may also contribute 
to changes in the basis of relationships. These changes call 
attention to new emotions, such as jealousy, love, depres-
sion over loss of love, sexual arousal, and passion. Individ-
ual differences in hormone levels are linked to gender role 
characteristics.
The general term for male sex hormones is androgens, 
the most prevalent of which is testosterone. Androgens, espe-
cially testosterone, are associated with sexual arousal, inter-
est, and behavior. This relationship is observed in both men 
and women. For men, higher levels of androgens are asso-
ciated with both increased sexual motivation and increased 
involvement in sexual activity. For women, higher levels of 
androgens are associated with increased sexual motivation, 
but estrogens appear to be implicated in their willingness 
to engage in sexual activity. This may be a result of the fact 
that estrogens contribute to the maturation of primary and 
BIOLOGICALLY, HUMANS MAY be 
sexually dimorphic, but in many cultures 
there is evidence of alternatives that 
expand on the dualistic perspective 
of male and female gender. Three 
examples of cultural traditions that have 
third gender categories are provided 
here as a way of illustrating the 
potential diversity of gender concepts. 
Many more examples can be found in 
anthropological writings (Nanda, 2001). 
Even as cultures differ in the norms 
that are associated with the male and 
female gender roles, many cultures 
include alternatives to the traditional 
male and female categories. These 
alternatives broaden the possibilities for 
pathways that individuals may follow as 
they crystallize their gender identity.
In Oman, a country in the Persian 
Gulf, Xanith is a term used to refer 
to biological males who function 
mostly as women (Nanda, 1998). In 
some Middle Eastern countries, this 
term is used as insulting slang for 
effeminate men. When asked, Xanith 
say they are women, but they are 
 not entirely like women according to 
Omani standards. Xanith behavior 
falls in between that of men and 
women. Under Islamic law, Xanith 
have all the rights of men and are 
allowed to worship with the men at 
the mosque, yet they are allowed to 
visit with women, eat with women, 
and walk arm in arm with women. 
The facial expressions, voice, laugh, 
movements, and swaying walk of 
the Xanith imitate those of women, 
but they wear clothing that is a 
mixture of men’s and women’s styles. 
Xanith are prohibited by law from 
wearing some women’s clothing, 
including the mask and veil that all 
adult women must wear. A Xanith 
wears the ankle-length tunic typical 
for men, but it is belted tightly at 
the waist as a woman might do. 
In Oman both men and women 
cover their heads, but Xanith go 
bareheaded. Unlike women, Xanith 
move around freely outside their 
houses, though only during the day. 
Most importantly, Xanith are openly 
prostitutes, an activity that is not 
acknowledged for Omani woman. 
Thus, the Xanith demonstrate a third 
gender role in many aspects of their 
public self-presentation.
In India and Pakistan, the Hijra 
provide another example of a third 
gender. The Hijra have an ancient 
tradition, inspired in part by the 
Hindu deity, Shiva. Shiva is sometimes 
portrayed as half male, half female. 
The Sanskrit name for this form of 
the deity, Ardhanaˉrıˉs‘vara, is best 
translated as “the lord who is half 
woman.” This image is used to 
symbolize the idea that the sacred 
powers of the universe are both 
feminine and masculine (Pettis, 
2004). Thus, Hindu thought allows for 
overlapping and even contradictory 
categories that support fl exibility in

relationships, with little intention of permanency or desire 
for having children. The birthrate to unmarried females in 
the age range 20 to 24 increased from 1990 to 2006. In 2006 
there were 636,000 births to unmarried women in this age 
range, and approximately 400,000 abortions (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2010). Roughly 25% of males under age 25 have 
fathered a child (Sonfield, 2002). Later adolescent males 
are at especially high risk for sexually transmitted infections 
(STIs), with 500 to 600 new cases of chlamydia and gon-
orrhea each year per 100,000 men in their early twenties. 
In 2007, there were 1,927 documented cases of AIDS and 
4,907 newly diagnosed cases of HIV among those 20 to 24 
years of age in the United States (Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, 2010b). As a group, later adolescents are 
more on the move, less connected to a specifi c community, 
and therefore less linked to health care services that might 
meet their needs. Until the recent change in health care policy 
INTERVIEWER: What do you think about girls or boys who 
sleep around?
BOY RESPONDENT: (Girls?) Sluts, basically. Because they have 
a mattress on their back, they like having sex. That’s the way 
I look at it, no two ways about it. Boys? A stud. Good luck 
to him. It’s OK for a guy to be like that. I don’t have to have 
sex with a guy, so I don’t care. That’s what the difference is.
GIRL RESPONDENT: (Girls?) I think they are sluts basically. 
(Boys?) They are different to girls because they like com-
peting against others, like [a] peer group pressure type of 
thing. When a guy does something, the other guys do it, 
too. They also like bragging, I think. (Moore & Rosenthal, 
2006, p. 143)
There is growing concern about the sexual and reproduc-
tive health of young people in their early twenties (Boonstra, 
2009). Later adolescents are more likely than those in their 
late twenties and thirties to be involved in multiple sexual 
gender roles. In general, Hijra are 
men who dress in women’s clothing, 
but do not try to hide their masculine 
features. When asked, they say they 
are not trying to be women, but 
view themselves as both male and 
female. In some writings, the Hijra 
are described as eunuchs; and some 
do undergo surgeries to have their 
male genitalia removed. They appear 
at weddings, usually uninvited, to 
sing and dance and bring wishes for 
fertility. They expect to be paid for 
these performances, and usually they 
are. Hijras refer to themselves using 
feminine pronouns and expect others 
to do so. They typically live together 
in a commune arrangement of fi ve or 
more chelas (disciples), supervised by 
a guru.
Among American Indian tribes, 
the two-spirit person is a native 
tradition that anthropologists have 
associated with some of the earliest 
discoveries of native artifacts. Before 
colonization and contact with 
European cultures, Native people 
believed in the existence of three 
genders: the male, the female, and 
the male-female gender, or what is 
now called the two-spirit person, a 
term derived from interpretations of 
Native languages used to describe 
people who displayed both male 
and female characteristics (Project 
Interaction, 2010). In the religious 
views of many Native people, 
humans are seen as minor relatives 
of goddesses and gods. When a 
human person is born, only one or 
the other spirit usually comes into 
substance, into life on Earth—the 
other half remains in the spirit world 
as a higher self. A woman may have 
her hidden male side, and a man may 
have his female side. Traditionally, 
the two-spirited person was one who 
had received a gift from the Creator, 
the privilege to house both male 
and female spirits in the body. Being 
given the gift of two spirits meant 
that this individual had the ability to 
see the world from two perspectives 
at the same time. This greater vision 
was a gift to be shared with all, 
and as such, two-spirited beings 
were revered as leaders, mediators, 
teachers, artists, seers, and spiritual 
guides. They were treated with 
the greatest respect, and held 
important spiritual and ceremonial 
responsibilities (Warren, 1998).
These examples extend our 
thinking about gender. They 
illustrate cultural strategies 
for formalizing alternative 
understandings about gender. In 
some cultures and at certain times in 
history, people who embrace these 
alternatives have been persecuted 
or reviled; but in other cultures and 
at other times, people who claim 
a third gender identity have been 
recognized as having special powers 
or insights.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. What are your reactions to the 
idea of a third gender? How 
does the concept of a third 
gender fi t with your own under-
standing of gender identity? Is 
it possible to be neither male 
nor female? Or both male and 
female?
 2. Why might many indigenous 
 people or cultures have con-
ceived of a social identity for 
people who combine male and 
female qualities?
 3. Whereas third gender individuals 
were respected and acknowl-
edged as having their own social 
space in many non-Western 
cultures, individuals who exhibit 
these characteristics have been 
ostracized and stigmatized in 
many Western societies. Why is 
that?

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
Much of the progress on identifying one’s sexual orienta-
tion takes place in the context of romantic relationships. In 
many early writings about the nature of homosexual cou-
ples, the concepts of gender identity and sexual orientation 
were blurred. One stereotype about homosexual relation-
ships is that they are gendered like traditionally imagined 
heterosexual relationships—one partner playing the domi-
nant role and the other partner playing the submissive role. 
Studies of same-sex couples reject this view. Lesbian and 
gay couples tend to have more equality in their relation-
ships and greater fl exibility than comparable heterosexual 
couples. Because the partners are of the same sex, they can-
not rely on traditional gender role stereotypes to define 
their functions in the household. Rather, they have to fi nd 
solutions that meet their personal preferences and compe-
tencies and try to adapt to the constraints of other work or 
school commitments (Kurdek, 1995). In one study compar-
ing gay and lesbian couples with cross-sex cohabiting cou-
ples, same-sex and mixed-sex couples who lived together 
appeared to be quite similar with respect to their satisfac-
tion as a couple. One noted difference was that the lesbian 
couples and the heterosexual men were more satisfi ed with 
the emotional expressiveness in their relationships and the 
amount of  leisure time they spent together than were the 
in the United States, which allowed children to remain on 
their parent’s health insurance policy until age 26, later ado-
lescents have been an especially vulnerable group when it 
comes to having a health provider and health insurance. This 
results in reduced access to reproductive health care and 
delayed treatment for STIs.
Sexual Orientation
Sexual orientation refers to the erotic, romantic, and 
affectionate attraction to people of the same sex, the oppo-
site sex, or both sexes (Sexuality Information and Educa-
tion Council of the United States [SEICUS], 2001). Sexual 
orientation can be understood along a continuum from 
completely heterosexual to bisexual to completely homo-
sexual preferences. Regardless of their biological sex or 
gender identity, people can be sexually attracted to men, 
attracted to women, attracted to both, or attracted to 
neither.
Gender identity refers to the meaning a person makes 
of being male or female and to the internalization of atti-
tudes, beliefs, and values associated with male and female 
behaviors. Four terms that are often used in discussing 
gender identity are masculinity, femininity, androgyny, and 
transgendered. Masculinity is typically associated with 
being instrumental and agentic (i.e., having leadership abili-
ties, being assertive, taking control); femininity is typically 
associated with being expressive and communal (i.e., valu-
ing interpersonal and spiritual development, being tender, 
sympathetic, and concerned about the well-being of others). 
Androgyny refers to the capacity to express both mascu-
line and feminine characteristics as the situation demands. 
Androgynous men score high in both masculine and femi-
nine characteristics in comparison to other men; androgy-
nous women score high in both masculine and feminine 
characteristics in comparison to other women (Bem, 1993). 
Transgendered refers to people who do not identify with 
or present themselves as refl ecting the sex they were born 
with and who move across or combine gender boundaries. 
Knowing a person’s gender identity does not allow one to 
predict sexual orientation.
Research on sexual orientation suggests that later ado-
lescence is a common time for the crystallization of a sex-
ual identity. During this time, young people begin a more 
active process of integrating their sexual fantasies, experi-
ences of sexual arousal, and understanding about sexual 
behavior into a sexual identity (Herold & Marshall, 1996). 
Later adolescents who may have struggled with acknowl-
edging and accepting their homosexual orientation during 
the high school period are likely to resolve these inner con-
fl icts and disclose their sexual orientation to others. This 
process is fostered by support from at least one close per-
son and by increasing involvement in the gay community. 
Although disclosure has its risks, failure to disclose or try-
ing to continue to pass as heterosexual is typically associ-
ated with strong feelings of isolation and self-repudiation 
(Troiden, 1993).
The crystallization of gender identity requires the integration 
of one’s sexuality, including physical appearance, primary and 
secondary sex characteristics, sexual drives, and fantasies. One’s 
sexual identity is as much a mental representation as a physical 
reality.

and decision-making authority, they are likely to experience 
a decline in their gender role preference. This could hap-
pen to men as well as women, depending on the paths they 
choose to pursue and the gender biases they encounter. For 
example, in general, we tend to think of career aspirations as 
being stifl ed for women as a result of attitudes on the part of 
men who think that women are not suited to certain types of 
work. However, the reverse situation may apply to men who 
are interested in fi elds such as early childhood education or 
nursing.
If later adolescents perceive that, apart from real differ-
ences in ability, one gender group is treated with greater 
respect, given more opportunities, and responded to with 
more attention or greater rewards, then their gender role 
preferences are likely to be recalibrated. During the high 
school years, adolescent girls are likely to encounter ste-
reotyped expectations that restrict their behavior, judge 
their appearance, or label them as sluts. Sometimes, these 
stereotypes intersect with race and social class, especially as 
they encounter negative expectations from teachers or suspi-
ciousness from shopkeepers (Abrams, 2003). Strict cultural 
norms regarding femininity, especially about body type and 
sexual behavior, can result in negative affect and alienation. 
Although some young women give in to these pressures, oth-
ers resist, refusing to give up their voice or their autonomy in 
the face of adult judgments:
Well, a lot of adults—they look at me kinda like, “ooh, she’s 
like really crazy looking,” or something like that. And my 
mom always says “oh, people are gonna think you’re a bad 
girl.” And I’m like “Whatever. I don’t care.” (Abrams, 2003, 
p. 71)
It appears that college students do not see much of this 
type of gender discrimination or preference. They tend to 
view the college environment as providing many oppor-
tunities and equal access to resources for both male and 
female students. Moreover, both male and female students 
feel equally oppressed by the stressors of college life and the 
uncertainties associated with the decisions they are trying to 
make. Typically, it is not until they enter the world of adult 
employment that they begin to experience the power differ-
ential that continues to operate to the benefi t of White men 
in U.S. society (Heilman, 2001).
Later adolescents who enter the world of work at the 
end of high school are confronted by the power differential 
immediately and may experience intimidation that forces 
them to accept it. For example, a woman who makes $2 per 
hour less than a male counterpart may be afraid to say any-
thing because she needs the job. She will have to integrate 
the reality of what she experiences into the formulation of 
her gender identity. One strategy is to accept that this is the 
way things should be according to gender role norms—that 
women should defer to men, and their contributions should 
be treated as less worthwhile. Another strategy may be to 
look for a different kind of work, in a setting where women 
and men are paid equally.
gay men or the heterosexual women (Means-Christensen, 
Snyder, & Negy, 2003).
When viewed through a gendered lens, men tend to be 
more instrumental, achievement oriented, autonomous, 
and assertive than women; women tend to be more expres-
sive, interpersonally oriented, and caring than men. Based 
on these gender differences, another misconception is that 
lesbian relationships are more likely to be fused, suffering 
from too great a need for connection, and gay relationships 
are more likely to suffer from disengagement and disruption. 
Research suggests that this description is overly simplistic. 
Just like heterosexual men and women, lesbians and gay 
men differ in their gender identities. As later adolescents 
engage in intimate relationships, the nature of their gender 
identity is clarifi ed. Within the context of lesbian or gay rela-
tionships, the interaction between the partners helps each 
person clarify gender identity. The conflicts that gay and 
lesbian partners experience with respect to power, decision 
making, sharing of responsibilities, disclosure, and closeness 
are not unlike the confl icts that heterosexual couples face as 
they take on roles and responsibilities in their relationship 
(Green, Bettinger, & Zachs, 1996).
Integrating One’s Gender Identity
During later adolescence, young men and women formulate 
their gender identities as they encounter diverse and some-
times competing social messages, role relationships, sexual 
motives and activities, and dyadic interactions. These gen-
der identities are situated in interpersonal, institutional, and 
cultural contexts. One of the salient factors contributing to 
the emergence of gender identity is gender role preference. 
This preference is based on an assessment of two factors: how 
well one can meet the cultural and social expectations asso-
ciated with one’s gender, and how positively one views the 
status associated with it. The idea of gender typicality was 
introduced in Chapter 7. As the norms for gender-related 
expectations shift, later adolescents may revise their view of 
whether their own traits, preferences, and talents are typical 
for their gender. Their view of gender typicality may become 
more differentiated. For example, Laura realizes that she has 
personal ambitions for career success and the accumulation 
of wealth that are not typical of other women in her friend-
ship group or her family. Yet, she still sees herself as fi tting in 
with her female friends and spending time in shared activi-
ties, including shopping for new clothes, volunteering at the 
senior center, and playing tennis. Her friends tease her about 
wanting to make her fi rst million dollars by the age of 25, 
but they admire her for it as well. As her personal identity 
becomes clearer, she can accept that she is similar to other 
women in many respects and different from them in others.
Later adolescents can view themselves as personally and 
socially typical of their gender, and still not be satisfi ed with 
their gender if the culture or context assigns a low status to 
their gender. If later adolescents become aware that their gen-
der prevents them from having access to resources, infl uence,

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
experiences that promote moral reasoning, and the expan-
sion of research on moral development, which includes pro-
social behavior and the ethics of care.
New Cognitive Capacities
Later adolescents bring new cognitive capacities to the arena 
of moral decision making. They are able to use abstract rea-
soning to consider the logical consequences of their actions, 
both for themselves and for others. They can project alter-
native paths in a probabilistic future. They are also able to 
consider the multiple perspectives that are possible in a 
moral situation. Most societies are structured around certain 
group inequalities in power, resources, and freedoms. Later 
adolescents can consider how resistance against certain laws, 
rules, or normative practices by a subordinated group, such 
as women or ethnic minorities, might be viewed as morally 
justifi ed by the less powerful group and morally wrong by 
the dominant group (Turiel, 2006). Later adolescents are 
increasingly aware of the rights and needs of others, and 
they are able to step outside the situation in order to examine 
how an action may satisfy their own needs but harm others. 
Later adolescents can refl ect about how principles of social 
responsibility, human rights, and justice can be preserved in 
a moral decision.
Stages of Moral Reasoning. Building on Piaget’s theory 
of cognitive development, Kohlberg (1964, 1969; Colby 
& Kohlberg, 1987) suggested that a qualitative change in 
a person’s ability to reason about moral issues is expected 
from early school age to later adolescence. With age and 
exposure to moral confl icts, moral reasoning advances in 
much the same way that other domains of logical reason-
ing mature, from an early reliance on direct perceptions and 
immediate consequences to more complex, abstract, and 
relativistic judgments. Kohlberg’s theory includes three lev-
els of moral reasoning divided into six substages (see Chap-
ter 7, Table 7.2).
At Stage I, the preconventional level, from about age 4 
to 10, children judge an action as morally justifi able based 
on the immediate consequences of the behavior and the 
approval of powerful authority figures. Stage II, the con-
ventional level, from about age 10 to 18, reflects a con-
cern about the maintenance of the existing rules and laws, 
and a respect for legitimate authority. Stage III, the post-
conventional level of moral reasoning, from about age 18 
into adulthood, brings an awareness of social, cultural, and 
political processes that result in the formulation of rules 
and laws. Morality is viewed as a system of rules that are 
agreed upon in order to preserve human rights and social 
order. These rules are understood as having been created in 
cultural and historical contexts, and can be altered as the 
norms of the community change. Beyond this appreciation 
for the cultural relativism of moral principles, there may 
emerge a commitment to overarching universal moral prin-
ciples, including greater concern for the value of human 
life, human dignity, and justice for all members of society. 
The college population tends to set social trends by 
according more variety and less rigidity to sex-linked role 
expectations. Most studies fi nd that during the college years, 
students become more fl exible in their gender role attitudes 
and more egalitarian in their views about how men and 
women ought to function in school, work, family, and com-
munity life. On the other hand, the noncollege population 
tends to set employment trends by breaking down barriers 
in many male-dominated areas of work, such as construc-
tion, trucking, and public safety. Individuals can shape and 
strengthen the nature of their gender identity by spending 
time with other people who support their views and values 
about how men and women ought to behave toward one 
another and what life paths are most desirable for them.
Internalized Morality
Objective 3. To describe the maturation of morality in 
later adolescence, with special focus on the role of new 
cognitive capacities that infl uence moral judgments 
and the various value orientations that underlie moral 
reasoning.
The development of morality was introduced in Chapter 7. 
In early school age, morality consists primarily of internal-
izing parental standards and values, recognizing the differ-
ence between right and wrong, and learning to control one’s 
behavior in anticipation of its moral consequences. As young 
people achieve new levels of autonomy from their parents 
and encounter new situations, they discover that some of 
the moral principles they learned as 6- or 7-year-olds neither 
apply to the new situation nor provide much of a rationale 
for why they should behave one way and not another. Later 
adolescents explore the distinction between social conventions 
and moral issues. Behaviors that may have been viewed as 
moral issues during childhood may be reevaluated as social 
conventions. The domain of personal preference or personal 
choice expands, resulting in a reorganization of one’s moral 
thinking.
Within the overall process of formulating a personal iden-
tity, later adolescents begin to see themselves as moral beings 
whose actions have implications for the well-being of others. 
They make moral commitments and judge their behavior 
and the behavior of others according to new moral standards 
(Damon, 1996, 2000). In the framework of forming a moral 
identity, the three elements of morality—judgment, caring, 
and action—come together in an increasingly complex polit-
ical, social, and interpersonal environment (Nucci & Turiel, 
2009). Morality may be expressed in a variety of behaviors, 
including acts of consideration and kindness; resistance to 
temptation; opposition to unfair laws, rules, or practices; and 
contributions of time, money, or other resources to enhance 
the well-being of others. The following sections examine 
Kohlberg’s analysis regarding advances in moral reasoning,

about the information and the self-assurance of the profes-
sor encouraged me to embrace this new way of thinking. 
(Chickering & Reisser, 1993, p. 240)
Through participation in thought-provoking discussions 
or challenging life experiences, moral reasoning can advance 
to the next higher level. Social and educational experiences 
tend to promote moral reasoning when they draw on exist-
ing constructs, but they also challenge those constructs by 
making their inadequacies clear. During later adolescence, 
young people are exposed to a broader social context at 
work, in their college courses, or through greater involve-
ment in community and national affairs.
Many young people participate in community service, 
such as volunteering at a soup kitchen or tutoring younger 
children in reading or math (Seider, 2007). These experiences 
can stimulate discussions about differing points of view and 
a more complex analysis of the many interdependent fac-
tors that contribute to the social order. Many communities 
have established youth development programs that involve 
adolescents in community service. As a result, a growing 
number of young people are likely to have new insights 
into moral situations (Yates & Youniss, 1996; Nasir & 
Kirshner, 2003). In a study of 12,000 college students, 
Sax & Astin (1997) found that participation in commu-
nity service during college had long-term consequences 
for adult involvement in volunteering, community activ-
ism, and helping others. A student at UCLA described her 
experiences:
As a volunteer for the UCLA Medical Center, my conversa-
tions with chronically ill patients made me realize the pro-
found emotional drain caused by long-term hospitalization. 
With each visit, I wished there was something more than my 
compassion that I could use to bring vibrancy and warmth 
back into these patients’ lives. In 2004, I used my back-
ground playing the piano and fl ute to create the volunteer 
organization, Music to Heal, through which I arrange for 
student musicians to bring music into the lives of hospital 
patients. (Mahanian, 2008, p. 27)
Exposure to a diversity of information, relationships, and 
worldviews stimulates moral reasoning. The change from 
conventional to postconventional morality that begins 
during adolescence involves a rethinking of traditional moral 
principles. During this period, there may be a loosening of 
ties to the family of origin and an increase in encounters with 
an expanding network of friends, students, and coworkers. 
Through interactions with diverse reference groups, there 
is an increasing recognition of the subcultural relativity of 
one’s moral code. There may also be a degree of confl ict over 
which moral values have personal meaning.
Expansions of Kohlberg’s View 
of Moral Development
Kohlberg’s view of moral development focuses on reason-
ing or moral knowledge, not on the emotional or behavioral 
The proportion of people who reach this fi nal level of moral 
reasoning is small, but it increases during early and middle 
adulthood.
Longitudinal data provide evidence of the sequential 
nature of these stages during childhood and adolescence 
(Nisan & Kohlberg, 1982; Colby, Kohlberg, Gibbs, & Lieber-
man, 1983; Snarey, Reimer, & Kohlberg, 1985; Colby & 
Kohlberg, 1987). The sequence of stages proposed by Kohl-
berg is noted in a variety of cultures outside the United 
States. Research confirming this has been done in Israel, 
 Turkey, the Bahamas, Honduras, Mexico, India, Kenya, 
 Nigeria, and Taiwan. Participants in these studies used 
forms of reasoning similar to those used by U.S. samples. 
The adults and adolescents in every culture used levels of 
reasoning that were higher than those used by the children 
(Nisan & Kohlberg, 1982; Rest, 1983; Snarey et al., 1985; 
Colby & Kohlberg, 1987; Dawson, 2002). The stages refl ect 
qualitatively distinct ways of reasoning about moral dilem-
mas that are supported by increasingly complex cognitive 
capacities (Dawson, 2003).
Experiences That Promote Moral Reasoning. Later 
adolescents must formulate an integrated value system with 
which to guide their behavior, particularly in the face of 
strong pressures to violate their moral beliefs. Young people 
encounter situations that they have never faced before— 
situations that require moral evaluation, judgment, and deci-
sions about action. College students may be asked to lend a 
paper that they have written so that another student can turn 
it in as her own work. Dilemmas about using illegal drugs, 
stealing books and journals from the library, or maintaining 
religious traditions and practices may confront a young per-
son who is away from home for the fi rst time. In these situa-
tions, the young person has the opportunity to envision the 
self as a moral actor and take a course of action most congru-
ent with other facets of his personal identity.
Although the sequence of moral stages appears to be well 
established, the level of moral reasoning that an individual 
actually attains depends on the kinds of moral challenges 
and situations encountered. For college students, like the 
one in the following example, the academic curriculum itself 
often creates a degree of cognitive disequilibrium that pro-
motes a revision in moral reasoning:
I was taking a theology class as a freshman in college and 
was presented with “bold” alternatives to understand and 
interpret the creation story—primarily to understand it as 
a myth. My life up to that point was characterized by ask-
ing many questions but arriving at few answers. To those 
in my fundamentalist background, those questions were 
annoyances but not insurmountable problems. In my shift 
to some answers to those questions, I moved away from 
fundamentalism to a more broadly based and responsible 
manner of critical thinking. The professor was very bright 
and responsible, yet in a sophisticated way he was some-
what irreverent. I was troubled by the dilemmas that this 
posed for me in terms of my belief structures, but something

context of the problem and a strong sense of caring, focusing 
on one’s responsibility for others and feelings of connection 
to them. Gilligan asserted that men, in contrast, empha-
size abstract principles, rules, and laws, and the conflicts 
between the rights of the parties involved in the confl ict. A 
woman, for example, might ask which outcome of a moral 
dilemma would result in the least harm for all concerned, 
whereas a man might ask whether one person has the right 
to infringe on the rights of others (Friedman, Robinson, & 
Friedman, 1987). These differences, according to Gilligan, 
are the product of different socialization patterns and result 
in different orientations to values, family life, and the basis 
of self-worth.
Several investigators have examined the claims of consis-
tent differences between men and women in moral orienta-
tion. The literature is inconclusive regarding the strength 
and consistency with which men and women differ in their 
use of what have come to be called the justice orientation 
and the caring orientation. It appears that experiential and 
situational issues, as well as concerns about interpersonal 
obligations and caring, are more dominant in open-ended 
responses from both men and women than are issues of 
justice and individual rights. However, with age, both men 
and women add more autonomous, justice-oriented rea-
soning to their repertoire (Walker, de Vries, & Trevethan, 
1987; Galotti, 1989; Galotti, Kozberg, & Farmer, 1991; 
Colby & Damon, 1994). The tendency of men and women 
to approach a moral dilemma using a justice-based or a care-
based form of reasoning is dependent on the social distance 
between the self and the other person involved. Regardless 
of gender, a caring orientation is more likely when the other 
person is viewed as a close friend or a member of one’s rel-
evant social group; a justice orientation is more likely when 
the other person is viewed as a member of an outgroup, a 
stranger, or when the nature of the relationship to the other 
person is not specifi ed (Ryan, David, & Reynolds, 2004).
In studies of prosocial behavior and empathic response to 
others, gender differences are commonly observed. Women 
report more caring behaviors, are rated as being more kind 
and considerate than men, emphasize the importance of 
helping others as a value, and exhibit more personal distress 
when faced with the distress of others (Eisenberg & Mor-
ris, 2004). In many cultures, family socialization practices 
emphasize the importance of prosocial behavior and social 
responsibility for female children. As a result of this focus, 
perhaps women are more likely than men to integrate a proso-
cial orientation into their gender identity (Froming, Nasby, & 
McManus, 1998).
The process of achieving a moral identity is made more 
diffi cult in a pluralistic society, where one’s moral concerns 
may be at odds with others’ social concerns. Certain groups 
are consistently wronged by deeply ingrained inequalities 
in the social structure. Acts of resistance or subversion by 
groups in positions of less power may be labeled as immoral 
by those in higher positions and as heroic by those in the 
disenfranchised groups (Turiel, 2003). In later adolescence, 
aspects of morality. One criticism of the theory is that stud-
ies do not fi nd a consistent relationship between a person’s 
level of moral reasoning and that person’s willingness to 
behave in a morally caring way. For example, several studies 
have taken the approach of identifying moral  exemplars—
people who have dedicated themselves to improving the 
lives of others—and comparing them to others who are 
not especially exemplary (Hart & Fegley, 1995). The moral 
exemplars are not more complex or advanced in their rea-
soning than the comparison group. What the exemplars 
demonstrate is a moral identity—a sense in which they 
defi ne themselves in moral terms and evaluate their behav-
ior against moral standards. Moral identity refl ects an inte-
gration of parental socialization about caring for others, an 
appreciation for the cultural and social contexts of moral 
actions, and experiences that have required moral action 
(Colby & Damon, 1999; Reimer, 2003).
A second criticism of Kohlberg’s approach to understand-
ing moral development is that his theory is based on a spe-
cifi c method that emphasizes prohibitive moral judgments, 
in which a person is asked to reach a decision about violat-
ing a law or breaking a promise in order to achieve some 
other goal. A typical example is the case of Heinz, a man 
who is faced with the dilemma of having to steal a drug 
from a pharmacist if he is to save his wife’s life. These dilem-
mas place justice—usually framed in terms of the legitimate 
needs or rights of the individual—in conflict with rules, 
laws, authority fi gures, and the obligations associated with 
adhering to these rules or laws.
Not all moral dilemmas are of this type, however. Some 
moral judgments involve a conflict between doing some-
thing helpful for someone else and meeting one’s own needs. 
An example would be stopping to help a person whose car 
has stalled on the highway at the risk of being late for a very 
important job interview. These dilemmas are described as 
prosocial moral judgments. The prosocial aspect of moral-
ity includes a concern for the welfare and rights of others 
and a willingness to act in order to benefi t or enhance the 
lives of others. Just as society depends on people adhering 
to rules and laws in order to preserve order, it also depends 
on a commitment to caring. People seem to be able to think 
more fl exibly about a prosocial moral dilemma than about 
a prohibitive one. Moral decisions that draw on empa-
thy and concern for the well-being of another person tend 
to evoke a higher level of moral reasoning than those that 
would require breaking a law (Eisenberg & Strayer, 1987; 
 Eisenberg & Fabes, 1998).
Expanding on the theme of prosocial morality, Carol Gil-
ligan (1977, 1982 /1993, 1988) challenged Kohlberg’s per-
spective, arguing that his description of the developmental 
course of reasoning about moral dilemmas is incomplete 
because it is based largely on the reasoning of male respon-
dents about hypothetical rather than real-life situations. She 
claimed that men and women have distinct orientations 
toward moral dilemmas. According to Gilligan, women 
approach moral decisions with greater sensitivity to the

a caring and a justice orientation in order to make contribu-
tions to their communities.
Career Choice
Objective 4. To analyze the process of career choice, 
with attention to education and gender role socialization 
as two major infl uential factors.
The choice of occupation sets the tone for one’s early adult 
lifestyle. The world of work determines one’s daily routine, 
including the time one wakes up, daily activities, expendi-
tures of physical and mental energy, and conditions for both 
immediate and long-term rewards. Because one’s occupa-
tion has implications for income and earning potential, 
one’s career choice will infl uence one’s personal fi nancial 
resources and opportunities. Occupation confers social sta-
tus and provides varying opportunities for advancement. 
Finally, it represents a direct or indirect expression of one’s 
value system. In subsequent chapters, we will discuss social-
ization in the work setting and the management of a career. 
Here, we focus on the process of career choice and its impact 
on development during later adolescence.
Work Experiences in Early Adolescence
Later adolescence is not the fi rst time young people encoun-
ter the world of work. Many early adolescents hold part-
time jobs while they attend high school. In 2008, 40% of 
16- to 19-year-olds were in the labor force, and 19% were 
unemployed—meaning that they were recently fi red or had 
been unsuccessful in looking for work during the preced-
ing 4 weeks (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). There is some con-
troversy about the benefi ts of working during high school 
and the extent to which these work experiences actually 
make a positive contribution to the occupational compo-
nent of identity development. A number of investigations 
have found that high school students who work long hours 
in stressful jobs are more likely to evidence increased ciga-
rette smoking, marijuana and alcohol use, receive lower 
grades, earn fewer course credits, and are more likely to 
drop out of high school (Entwisle, Alexander, & Olson, 
2005; Marsh & Kleitman, 2005). Students who work long 
hours have less time for school activities, socialization with 
friends, or the development of other areas of interest. The 
kinds of work opportunities that are available to adolescents 
are usually minimally skilled jobs with high turnover, low 
pay, little decision-making responsibility, and little stimula-
tion of skill development. These kinds of jobs are likely to 
produce depression and low self-esteem and may contribute 
to feelings of alienation from the school environment. For 
some adolescents, the time spent in these kinds of work set-
tings is associated with the development of cynical attitudes 
toward work and greater acceptance of unethical practices 
by workers.
young people begin to appreciate the moral ambiguities of 
their communities and may take action to express their com-
mitments to justice and care through individual or group 
efforts.
Whereas some young people appear to be character-
ized by self-indulgence and social indifference, others are 
intensely engaged in actions fueled by the passion of indigna-
tion about social injustice and commitments to moral goals. 
In 2009, a record number of college freshmen (roughly 31%) 
indicated that they expected to engage in community ser-
vice or volunteer work during their college years. Those who 
already had a community service experience in high school 
were more likely to expect to continue this type of com-
mitment during college. Volunteering has been found to be 
strongly associated with two aspects of moral commitment, 
social agency, or a personal goal of being politically and 
socially active in the community, and valuing and respect-
ing other groups’ points of view (Higher Education Research 
Institute, 2010). This large and growing group of college stu-
dents provides a very hopeful indication about the willing-
ness of the new generation of young people for combining 
The caring orientation is evidenced when Alison volunteers to 
spend time visiting with older adults in a nursing home in her 
university community.

limiting their desirability to those with traditional gender 
role expectations. Over time, as the process of identity for-
mation unfolds, involvement in careers and exposure to non-
traditional role models can also modify one’s gender identity.
Of the six factors described in Figure 10.2, high school 
and college students reported that the individual factors, 
such as abilities, achievement needs, attitudes, and self-
expectancies, most strongly affected their career decision 
making. They perceived familial, societal, and socioeconomic 
factors as having little or no impact (O’Neil et al., 1980). 
This is contrary to social science research evidence. Family 
factors play a key role in shaping educational aspirations and 
occupational goals. Societal and socioeconomic conditions 
are major factors infl uencing the job market and the chances 
of both employment and advancement. Students who have 
a clearer understanding of the critical social and economic 
factors that infl uence the labor market are better able to con-
sider career alternatives and to analyze the steps they need to 
take in order to achieve their career goals (Diemer & Blus-
tein, 2006).
Family Background and Career Opportunities. Fam-
ily background characteristics, including parents’ occu-
pation, educational background, income, culture, and 
community, are associated with educational opportunities, 
Other researchers have emphasized the diversity of work 
experiences and the potential benefits of certain kinds of 
work. Students who are able to find and keep a good job 
may feel more confi dent about themselves and their prom-
ise for future employment. When the work does not involve 
too many hours, and when it involves skill development that 
young people see as related to their future career direction, 
the experience is likely to be associated with higher levels of 
well-being and less involvement in problem behaviors. For 
girls, the perception of continuity between school and work 
and the feeling that work improves one’s school performance 
had an especially positive relationship with mental health 
and well-being (Mortimer, Finch, Shanahan, & Ryu, 1992; 
Mortimer & Johnson, 1999).
Factors Infl uencing Career Choice
As Figure 10.2 suggests, career choice is infl uenced by six 
major factors: individual, psychosocial-emotional, socio-
economic, societal, familial, and situational (O’Neil et al., 
1980). These same factors contribute to gender role social-
ization. It is important to see the interrelationship of these 
two domains for young people in our culture. Gender role 
socialization creates a powerful fi lter through which choices 
related to career development are made. Gender role ste-
reotyping may apply to certain occupational fi elds, thereby

Developmental Tasks | 407
For youth who leave high school or who graduate but do 
not go on to college, the job market has several unattractive 
features:
Most of the jobs available at this level of educational attain-
ment are routine, menial, temporary, more likely to be part 
time and to provide reduced monetary and nonmaterial re-
wards compared with jobs held by older workers. . . . More-
over, jobs within this sector are unusually unstable and may 
be supervised by rigid, autocratic employers, many of whom, 
particularly in the fast food industry, are not much older than 
the novice worker. (Borman & Hopkins, 1987, p. 136)
The impact of school experiences on subsequent career 
development goes beyond whether one plans to attend col-
lege or not. Vocational coursework of a specifi c nature, such 
as agricultural training, an emphasis on math and science 
courses, and frequent conversations with teachers about 
one’s work-related decisions are all associated with higher 
income and more stable work records after high school. 
Identity formation, self-insight, and active clarification of 
work values are all related to greater career confi dence and 
more mature career decision making (Schulenberg, Vond-
racek, & Kim, 1993; Vondracek, Schulenberg, Skorikov, & 
Gillespie, 1995).
Gender Role Socialization and Career Choice. Gen-
der role socialization shapes career decisions through two 
signifi cant psychological factors: (1)  perceptions of ability, 
and (2) career-related values and goals. First, as a result of 
socialization, men and women are likely to form different 
expectations about their ability to succeed at various career-
related skills. Self-expectancies about the ability to fulfill 
the educational requirements and the job duties of specifi c 
careers are a major factor in determining career choices. 
Recall from Chapter 8 (Middle Childhood) the discussion 
of parents’ expectations about their children’s competence 
in certain skill areas and its relation to the child’s own per-
ceptions of competence. In a longitudinal study, mothers’ 
gender-stereotyped beliefs about their young child’s math 
and science abilities predicted their child’s self-perceptions 
aspirations, and academic achievement from early school 
age through the high school and college years. Differ-
ences in family resources result in diverging educational 
backgrounds, which have direct implications for the kinds 
of careers one is prepared to enter. In the period of early 
adolescence, children from low-income families and from 
families in which the parents did not graduate from high 
school are more likely to drop out of high school and less 
likely to be enrolled in postsecondary education. Of the 
seniors graduating from high school in 2008, 72% of Euro-
pean American, non-Hispanic students went on to col-
lege, compared to 56% of African Americans and 64% of 
Latino students (National Center for Education Statistics, 
2010). Children whose parents are in the top 25% of fam-
ily income are more than 7 times more likely to gradu-
ate from college (61%) than children from families in the 
lowest 25% of family income (8.5%) (Mortenson, 2001). 
Differences in families’ ability to support occupational 
exploration, the parents’ own occupational attainments, 
and their ideas about ideal career paths infl uence their chil-
dren’s career decision-making process. For example, in a 
comparison of Chinese American and European American 
youth, the Chinese Americans emphasized the importance 
of entrepreneurial opportunities in their career interests, 
whereas the European Americans emphasized the impor-
tance of social features (Marjoribanks, 1997–1998; Leong, 
Kao, & Lee, 2004).
Education and Career Choice. It is well documented 
that career advancement and the associated earnings are 
closely linked to levels of educational attainment. For those 
who do not graduate from high school, career development 
is a bumpy path. In 2008, the unemployment rate for high 
school dropouts was 25.8%. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). 
In 2007, 67% of high school graduates in the United States 
were enrolled in some type of postsecondary institution, 
66% of men and 68% of women. This compares to 49% 
of high school graduates in 1980 (U.S. Census Bureau, 
2010). College is becoming an increasingly essential aspect 
of career development. Despite the large number of stu-
dents who attend some type of college, many do not com-
plete a degree. In 2008, 29% of the population ages 25 and 
older had a college degree or more. This percentage varies 
greatly by race/ethnicity: African Americans, 19.6%; Asian 
Americans and Pacifi c Islanders, 52.6%; European Ameri-
cans, 29.8%; and Hispanic/Latinos, 13.3% (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2010).
Table 10.1 shows the mean earned income on the basis 
of educational level for men and women who were 25 to 34 
years old in 2007. Educational attainment has a signifi cant 
relationship to annual income. As the data indicate, how-
ever, educational achievement does not result in the same 
economic advantages for men and women. Women with 1 
to 3 years of college but no degree earned less on average 
than men who were high school graduates (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2010).

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
with what they thought certain careers might allow them to 
achieve, called goal affordances. The study found that stu-
dents who thought a career would help them achieve their 
work goals were also more interested in those careers (Mor-
gan, Isaac, & Sansone, 2001). Women rated interpersonal 
goals as more important and high pay and high status goals 
as less important than men. Both men and women viewed 
careers in physical and mathematical science as offering less 
in the way of interpersonal goals and more in the way of sal-
ary and status. As a result, women were less interested in 
careers in physical and mathematical science and less likely 
to identify those fi elds as career choices. The internalization 
of gender-related goals is directly related to how motivated a 
young man or woman is in pursuing a career that promises 
to allow her to attain those goals (Evans & Diekman, 2009).
The consequences of gender role socialization for career 
choice can be seen in distribution of men and women in the 
labor force (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Although there are 
many areas where men and women are equally involved, pat-
terns of gender differentiation are quite notable. For example 
the large majority of those working in fields of preschool 
education, elementary or middle school teaching, special 
education, nursing, and office/administrative support are 
women. The large majority of those working as fi refi ghters or 
police, or in engineering, computer programming, transpor-
tation, construction, and natural resources, are men.
Gender identity is shaped by cultural values that may 
determine one’s career goals and related choices. In a study of 
the educational and occupational attainment of low-income, 
rural Appalachian women, the importance of family social-
ization influences was highlighted (Wilson, Peterson, & 
 Wilson, 1993). These families tend to have strong kinship 
ties and high levels of consensus about norms for appropriate 
of math and science self-effi cacy 2 years after high school. 
Mothers’ predictions of their child’s ability to succeed in a 
math-oriented career was a signifi cant predictor of their col-
lege-age child’s career choice (Bleeker & Jacobs, 2004). In 
the process of career decision making, strong gender-typed 
conceptualizations of the job demands of specific careers 
intervene to screen out some alternatives and highlight oth-
ers (Stromquist, 1991; Gati, Osipow, & Givon, 1995). For 
example, there is a clear path from belief in one’s competence 
in math to aspirations about careers in math, science, and 
engineering (Correll, 2001). Gendered beliefs about math-
ematics competence, infl uenced in part by parental expecta-
tions, may contribute to the persistent gender divide with 
respect to women enrolling in university and graduate pro-
grams in mathematics, physics, and engineering. Studies of 
career choice or career aspirations fi nd that women with a 
strong sense of their own goals, an awareness of their per-
sonal needs, and an ability to cope realistically with stress 
have been more likely to adopt a nontraditional career 
choice.
Second, as a result of socialization, women and men are 
likely to establish different value hierarchies, refl ecting dif-
ferent long-range life goals. Among later adolescents, young 
men have been found to prefer “jobs characterized by high 
salaries, power or infl uence over others, opportunities for 
advancement or achievement, risk taking, challenging tasks, 
a high level of responsibility, and a high level of prestige” 
(Weisgram, Bigler, & Liben, 2010, p. 779). Young women 
have been found to prefer “jobs that allow them to work 
with or help others, develop their knowledge or skills, and 
spend time with family” (Weisgram, Bigler, & Liben, 2010, 
p. 779). For example, one study compared what college stu-
dents wanted from their careers, referred to as work goals, 
After high school, Rick de-
cided to work in a local fi sh 
market. He will probably quit 
when he has earned enough 
money to buy the truck he has 
been wanting. Then he’ll travel

and achieves a degree of self-insight that permit a realistic 
and consistent choice (Schmitt-Rodermund & Silbereisen, 
1998). A person who delays the decision has a clearer sense 
of her adult interests and goals. By delaying the career deci-
sion, one also has more opportunities to explore alterna-
tive work scenarios and to understand more about the labor 
market.
Nonetheless, high schools, colleges, and various indus-
tries urge young people to make career choice decisions as 
early as possible. Thus, some of the tension that later ado-
lescents experience in connection with a choice of career is a 
product of the lack of fi t between socialization pressures and 
their own developmental timetable. With the increased like-
lihood of living to be 80 years old, there is no great rush to 
decide on a career by age 20. In the United States, the aver-
age person with a bachelor’s degree has 11 jobs between the 
ages of 18 and 32 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2007). In this con-
text, selecting the fi rst career ought to be viewed as an exten-
sion of one’s occupational education, not a decision that has 
to last a lifetime.
Phases of Career Decision Making. Once a person 
begins to accept certain elements of his self-concept related 
to the occupational aspect of identity, the process of career 
decision making begins. Tiedeman (Tiedeman & O’Hara, 
1963; Tiedeman & Miller-Tiedeman, 1985) developed a 
model of the phases of career decision making. This model 
illustrates how making career-related decisions helps to clar-
ify one’s occupational identity and, at the same time, uses the 
context of work to promote new learning about other aspects 
of the self (see Figure 10.3). A career decision depends on 
the outcomes of several tasks during early and later ado-
lescence and early adulthood. With effective problem solv-
ing, the person gains increased control over life events and 
is better prepared to meet the challenges of the next phase 
of decision making. Tiedeman identifi ed seven phases; the 
first four emphasize planning and clarification, while the 
last three emphasize implementation. The model refl ects an 
individual’s capacity for ongoing adaptation and change. At 
behaviors. They endorse traditional gender roles in which the 
men are the dominant decision makers and the women are 
expected to be homemakers and also hold low-paying jobs to 
help support the family. Educational and occupational aspi-
rations are generally higher for male than for female children 
in these families, but both are encouraged to restrict their 
aspirations to career options that will keep them close to 
their childhood homes.
Career Decision Making
The idea of career decision making must be evaluated 
in light of rapid changes in the nature of work, the perva-
siveness of the two-earner family lifestyle, the increased 
likelihood of multiple job and career changes over the life 
course, and the constant reconfi guration of the job market— 
especially the trends toward downsizing, workforce reduc-
tions, retraining, and outsourcing. The idea of occupational 
choice should not be confused with choice about labor mar-
ket participation. Although they may have a wide choice in 
the kind of work they will do, most people in the United 
States do not have a choice about whether to work or not. 
In fact, about 6% of young people in the 20 to 24 age range 
have more than one job (U.S. Census Bureau, 2007).
Career choice refl ects a central component of a person’s 
emerging identity. For some young people, occupational 
choice is a refl ection of continued identifi cation with their 
parents. They may select the same job or career as that of 
one of their parents, or they may select a career because 
it reflects their parents’ aspirations for them. Little per-
sonal choice is involved. For some young people, primarily 
women, there continues to be a path of primary identifi ca-
tion with the roles of wife and mother, with only second-
ary investment in the labor market. Many of these women, 
especially those who marry and have children after high 
school, return to school or to technical training in their 
thirties and forties in order to pick up the thread of career 
development, either as a result of divorce or when their 
children get older. Increasing numbers of men and women 
realize that their occupational career will need to be coordi-
nated and integrated with that of their spouse. In anticipa-
tion of a dual-earner lifestyle, young people begin to screen 
their career aspirations through the lens of the compatibil-
ity of job demands with family commitments and personal 
aspirations.
Concerns about future educational and career decisions 
constitute a major source of worry for college students. Of 
the students entering college as freshmen in 2004, 72% 
said that an important reason for going to college was to be 
able to get a better job (Chronicle of Higher Education, 2005). 
Many people assume that the younger a person is when he 
makes a career choice, the better. Most career development 
professionals, however, advise that a decision about a career 
be delayed until later adolescence or early adulthood. The 
concept of career maturity suggests that with increased 
cognitive and affective development, a person develops 
decision-making strategies, gains access to information, 
Most colleges have resources to help students with their career de-
cision making, including advisors, online software, and career fairs.

ate time. A person’s self-concept is modifi ed by the commit-
ment to a career path, and by the desire to create congruity 
between one’s decision and the demands that are likely to 
accompany that decision.
During the induction phase, the person encounters the 
new career environment for the fi rst time. She wants to be 
accepted and looks to others for cues about how to behave. 
The person identifi es with the new group and seeks recogni-
tion for her unique characteristics. Gradually, the self-image 
is modifi ed as the person begins to believe in the values and 
goals of the new group.
In the infl uence phase, the person is very much involved 
with the new group. He becomes more assertive in asking 
that the group perform better. The person also tries to infl u-
ence the group to accommodate some of his values. The self 
is strongly committed to group goals. During this phase, the 
group’s values and goals may be modifi ed to include the ori-
entation of the new member.
Finally, in the integration phase, group members react 
against the new member’s attempts to infl uence them. The 
new member then compromises. In the process, she attains 
each phase in the process, people can redefi ne the self and 
transcend the conditions of the work environment to change 
their minds (Miller-Tiedeman, 1999).
In the exploration phase, the person realizes that a career 
decision must be made and therefore begins to learn more 
about those aspects of the self and the occupational world 
that are relevant to the impending decision. The person 
begins to generate alternatives for action. Uncertainty about 
the future and the many possible alternatives is accompanied 
by feelings of anxiety.
In the crystallization phase, the person becomes more 
aware of the alternatives for action and their consequences. 
Confl icts among alternatives are recognized, and some are 
discarded. The person develops a strategy for making the 
decision, in part by weighing the costs and benefi ts of each 
alternative.
In the choice phase, the person decides which action 
alternative to follow. The decision is solidifi ed in the person’s 
mind as she elaborates the reasons why the decision is ben-
efi cial. There is a sense of relief and optimism as the person 
develops a commitment to executing the decision.
In the clarifi cation phase, the person more fully under-
stands the consequences of the commitment to the decision

early adulthood. Characteristics of the contemporary labor 
market may be contributing to new diffi culties that later ado-
lescents encounter as they attempt to move through the fi rst 
four phases of Tiedeman’s model.
• The increasing number of jobs and careers available make 
the exploration phase more diffi cult.
• As a result of changes in technology and organizational 
structure, some skills become obsolete and some job mar-
kets dry up. A career may become obsolete in the time it 
takes a young person to prepare for it.
• As established firms lose their identities in corporate 
mergers, identifi cation with a particular company ceases 
to be appropriate.
• As most large companies go through restructuring and 
downsizing, the people who are left are asked to do more 
tasks of a greater variety. In addition to one’s special area 
of training, it is important to develop support skills, such 
as word processing, data management, literature search 
skills, and verbal and written communication skills.
• New careers emerge at a rapid pace. From the time 
one enters the choice phase to the time one enters the 
influence phase, new kinds of work roles may become 
available.
• Career paths are less clear than they once were. Young 
people are being advised to expect three or four career 
changes in their lifetime. They may end up moving from 
the private to the nonprofi t sector, from business to edu-
cation, from service provider to entrepreneur.
• The cost of living—especially the costs of housing, health 
care, and education—introduces concerns about the 
amount of money that will be needed to live comfortably. 
Worries about making money may interfere with effective 
career decision making.
Given the complexity of the world of work, career inde-
cision is common in later adolescence. In contrast to those 
college students who know what career they plan to enter, 
there are two different patterns of career indecision. One is 
a more objective understanding of the self and the group. A 
true collaboration between the new member and the group is 
achieved. The new member feels satisfi ed and is evaluated as 
successful by the self and others.
This model emphasizes continuous interaction between the 
individual and the work context. At fi rst, interaction is neces-
sary to clarify the person’s talents and choice of career. Later, 
it is necessary to achieve a satisfactory level of adaptation to 
the work environment. At each juncture, whether the decision 
relates to college major, occupation, job change, or career redi-
rection, effective decision making involves all seven phases.
The concept of career decision-making self-effi cacy is 
widely used in the fi eld of vocational education and devel-
opment to highlight the role of a person’s emerging confi -
dence in her ability to make an effective career choice. You 
may recall from Chapter 2 that Albert Bandura introduced 
the concept of self-effi cacy to refer to the confi dence that a 
person has that he can meet the standards for performance 
in a particular domain. We discussed self-effi cacy in some 
detail in Chapter 8, as a component of the developmental 
task of self-evaluation. Judgments of self-effi cacy stem from 
four sources: prior experiences of success or failure in a spe-
cifi c domain; encouragement or discouragement from others 
(verbal persuasion); vicarious experiences of watching others 
succeed or fail; and the physical state of arousal that accom-
panies being engaged in the task. Career decision-making 
self-efficacy includes assessments about whether one can 
make an accurate self-appraisal of one’s abilities, gather rel-
evant occupational information, formulate appropriate goals, 
make plans to achieve those goals, and solve the problems 
that pose barriers to the achievement of goals (Betz, 2001). 
In each of these areas, a student can be expected to moni-
tor all four sources of information to reach a level of confi -
dence that she can make effective career choices. For college 
students, the sense of career decision-making self-effi cacy is 
closely tied to confi dence in other domains, the most impor-
tant of which is leadership. Students who believe that they 
have strong leadership abilities and who have had positive 
leadership experiences are also more confi dent about their 
ability to make effective career decisions. In addition, con-
fidence in science, math, writing, using technology, and 
cultural sensitivity all contribute to career decision-making 
self-effi cacy (Paulsen & Betz, 2004). Many courses and pro-
grams are introduced on college campuses to help support 
students’ career decision making. The idea that self-effi cacy 
about career decision making can be enhanced through 
deliberate interventions has guided many of these programs, 
resulting in measurable improvements in career confi dence, 
especially for students who are unsure or highly anxious 
about their career direction (Betz, 2007).

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
inclusion of this concept in the theory of psychosocial devel-
opment in 1950 to his analysis of American identity in 1974. 
His notion of identity involves the integration of past, present, 
and future. From the past, young people undertake a process 
of reexamination of childhood identifi cations. From the pres-
ent, young people identify and evaluate their talents, interests, 
and abilities. From the future, there is an articulation of valued 
life goals and aspirations. These three sources of identity con-
tent have to be woven into a meaningful sense of a purposeful 
self. The major works in which he discussed identity are the 
article “The Problem of Ego Identity” (Erikson, 1959) and the 
book Identity: Youth and Crisis (Erikson, 1968). Our discussion, 
which is grounded in these works, is broadened to include the 
ideas of others who have begun to extend and operationalize 
the concept of identity (Schwartz, 2001; Kroger, 2004; Cro-
cetti, Rubini, & Meeus, 2008; Lawler, 2009).
Later adolescents are preoccupied with questions about 
their essential character in much the same way that early-
school-age children are preoccupied with questions about 
their origins. In their efforts to defi ne themselves, later ado-
lescents must take into account the bonds that have been 
built between them and others in the past as well as the 
direction they hope to take in the future. Identity serves 
as an anchor point, providing the person with an essential 
experience of continuity in social relationships:
The young individual must learn to be most himself where 
he means the most to others—those others, to be sure, 
who have come to mean most to him. The term identity 
expresses such a mutual relation in that it connotes both 
a persistent sameness within oneself (self-sameness) and a 
persistent sharing of some kind of essential character with 
others. (Erikson, 1959, p. 102)
The Private and Public Faces of Identity
As the preceding quotation suggests, identity achievement 
is associated with an internal sense of individual unique-
ness and direction accompanied by a social or community 
validation about the direction one has chosen. Thus iden-
tity includes both a private and a public self. The private 
self, often described as a sense of self, refers to one’s inner 
uniqueness and unity, the subjective experience of being the 
originator of one’s thoughts and actions and of being self-
refl ective. Through the private self, one recognizes the range 
of values and beliefs to which one is committed, and one can 
assess the extent to which certain thoughts and actions are 
consistent with those beliefs. The private, subjective sense of 
self, which develops over the course of the life span, includes 
four basic elements (Blasi, 1991; Glodis & Blasi, 1993):
• A sense of agency—Being the originator of thoughts and 
actions.
• A sense of unity—Sensing that one is the same basic self 
from one moment or one situation to the next.
• A sense of otherness—Recognizing the boundaries between 
the self and others.
considered a developmentally normal state that results from 
a lack of work experience and information about the world 
of work coupled with continuing emergence of personal 
identity. The other is considered to refl ect chronic indeci-
sion, related to a pervasive lack of self-effi cacy, dependency, 
and more serious identity confusion (Guay, Ratele, Senécal, 
Larose, & Deschênes, 2006).
Ideally, one’s choice of occupation is the result of personal 
experimentation, introspection, self-evaluation, fact fi nding, 
and intuition. This process becomes intimately interwoven 
with one’s psychological development. In order to make a 
career choice, people may fi rst choose to pose diffi cult ques-
tions to themselves about their skills, temperament, values, 
and goals. When they make a decision based on this kind 
of personal evaluation, they are likely to see their careers as 
a well-integrated part of their personal identities rather than 
as activities from which they are alienated or by which they 
are dominated.
The Psychosocial Crisis: 
Individual Identity versus 
Identity Confusion
Objective 5. To defi ne and describe the psychosocial 
crisis of later adolescence, individual identity versus 
identity confusion; the central process through which 
this crisis is resolved, role experimentation; the prime 
adaptive ego quality of fi delity to values and ideals; and 
the core pathology of repudiation.
The basic confl ict of the psychosocial crisis of later adolescence 
is individual identity formation versus identity confusion. It 
results from the enormous diffi culty of pulling together the 
many components of the self—including changing perspec-
tives on one’s inner sense of beliefs and values as well as new 
and changing social demands—into a unifi ed image that can 
propel the person toward positive, meaningful action. As part 
of this process, a young person struggles to formulate a world-
view, an outlook on those goals and values that are personally 
important and to which the person is willing to make a com-
mitment. Over the period of later adolescence, whether in the 
context of college or in other work and community settings, 
young people begin to examine the beliefs and goals they may 
have internalized from childhood. Through self-reflection, 
role experimentation, and feedback from signifi cant others, 
later adolescents make decisions about whether these beliefs 
and goals are still meaningful as they look ahead to the future.
Individual Identity
Erik Erikson provided a comprehensive treatment of the 
meaning and functions of individual identity, from his

and having new kinds of social and interpersonal success 
(Green & Hill, 2003).
Both the content and evaluation components of identity 
may change over the life course. In later adolescence, the focus 
• A sense of decentering or distancing—Refl ecting on oneself 
so that one can recognize and own one’s thoughts and 
actions.
The elements of the public self include the many roles 
one plays and the expectations of others. As young people 
move through the stage of later adolescence, they fi nd that 
social reference groups—including family members, neigh-
bors, teachers, friends, religious groups, ethnic groups, and 
even national leaders—have expectations of their behavior. 
A young person may be expected to work, attend college, 
marry, serve the country in the military, attend religious 
services, vote, and provide economic support for family 
members. Persistent demands by meaningful others result 
in decisions that might have been made differently, or not 
made at all, if the individual were surrounded by a differ-
ent confi guration of social reference groups. In the process of 
achieving personal identity, one must synthesize the private 
sense of self with the public self derived from the many roles 
and relationships in which one is embedded.
The Content and Evaluation Components 
of Identity
The structure of identity has two components: content and 
evaluation (Breakwell, 1986; Whitbourne, 1986). The con-
tent includes what one thinks about, values, and believes in, 
and the traits or characteristics by which one is recognized 
and known by others. Erikson suggested that identity was 
achieved by fi nding one’s sense of direction with respect to 
salient roles and values, especially vocational decisions, politi-
cal and religious ideologies, sexual expression, and gender role 
or interpersonal values. In many measures of identity forma-
tion, these domains comprise the foundational content areas 
(Kroger, 2003). The second structural component of identity, 
evaluation, refers to the significance one places on various 
aspects of the identity content. Even though most people play 
many of the same roles, their identities differ in part because 
they place different values on some of these roles. Some peo-
ple are single-minded, placing great value on success in one 
domain, such as their vocational goals, and little value on the 
others. Other people strive to maintain a balance in the roles 
they play; they consider themselves successful if they can fi nd 
enjoyment in a variety of relationships and activities.
A person’s assessment of the importance of certain 
content areas in relation to others influences the use of 
resources, the direction of certain decisions, and the kinds 
of experiences that may be perceived as most personally 
rewarding or threatening. College students, for example, 
may differ in whether academic success and professional 
preparation or interpersonal success is most central to their 
sense of identity. Students who are more concerned about 
academic success take a different approach to the college 
environment, become involved in different kinds of activi-
ties, and have a different reaction to academic feedback than 
do students who are more concerned about making friends

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
The evening surprisingly took on (in my youthful imagi-
nation) the cast of Greenwich Village “Beats” and verboten 
revelations. The greatest stimulation, however, came when 
he played the Library of Congress recording of T. S. Eliot 
reading “The Wasteland.” In that moment, I became, willy-
nilly, a party to “modernism” in its prototypical form. I was 
surprised and delighted. I had heard nothing like it before. 
The Eliotian reading initiated my habit of “listening” for po-
ems rather than “looking” for them.  .  .  . I stepped into a 
late fall evening with an entirely new sense of myself and of 
“worlds on worlds rolling ever.”

CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. What elements of the identity process are evident in this case?
 2. What are some of the characteristics of Professor Watkins 
that may have made him a target for identifi cation for 
Houston Baker?
 3. What aspects of the college environment are likely to 
stimulate the identity process?
 4. Have you ever had an intellectual experience that gave 
you a “new sense of yourself”? What combination of fac-
tors came together to permit that to happen?
Identity Status
The identity process takes place in a historical and cultural 
context. During early and later adolescence, young people 
are aware of the age-graded expectations that exist in their 
families and communities, typically structured around spe-
cific tasks and roles, including educational attainment, 
occupation, intimacy, marriage, and childrearing. In most 
modern societies, each of these areas presents a variety of 
opportunities or possible paths as well as some constraints 
about which paths are possible given certain personal, fi nan-
cial, and cultural resources. In later adolescence, the identity 
work includes selecting goals in these domains and prepar-
ing for the achievement of these goals (Nurmi, 2004).
Identity formation is a dynamic process that unfolds as 
young people assess their competencies and aspirations 
within a changing social context of expectations, demands, 
and resources. A variety of potential resolutions of the psy-
chosocial crisis of individual identity versus identity confu-
sion have been described. At the negative pole of the crisis, 
identity confusion or diffusion, the person is not able or pos-
sibly not willing to make any commitments to adult roles 
and values. At the positive pole, identity achievement, the 
person has made commitments to a defi ned set of values and 
goals. Between these two outcomes, other identity resolu-
tions have been described, including premature resolution, 
identity foreclosure, postponement of resolution, psychoso-
cial moratorium, and negative identity (Kroger, 1993, 2003).
One of the most widely used conceptual frameworks 
for assessing identity status was devised by James Marcia 
is on integrating the various sources of content and determin-
ing which elements have the greatest salience. This is a major 
accomplishment that requires self-awareness, introspection, 
and the active exploration of a variety of roles and relation-
ships. Insight into this process is provided in the case study of 
Houston A. Baker, Jr. However, the identity that is formed at 
the end of this period is often very abstract, because later ado-
lescents have not yet encountered many of the responsibilities, 
pressures, and confl icts of adult life. The ideological frame-
work of identity has not yet been forged in the fl ames of reality.
CASE STUDY
HOUSTON A. BAKER, JR.
A poet and literary scholar tells of the impact of one of his 
college professors on his personal identity.
He intrigued us. Slowly puffi ng on the obligatory pipe, he 
would chide us for the routineness of our analyses of revered 
works in the British and American literary canons. He wore—
always—a tie and tweed of Ivy provenance, and at the end of 
the fi rst session of his “World Literature” course at Howard 
University in the fall of 1963, I had but one response—I wanted 
to be exactly like him.
The task was to prove myself worthy. I labored furiously at 
the beginning assignment—an effort devoted to Marvellian 
coy mistresses and pounding parodies thereof. The result was 
a D and the comment: “This is a perfunctory effort. You have 
refused to be creative. There are worlds on worlds rolling ever. 
Try to make contact with them.” I was more than annoyed; I 
was livid. Who did he think he was? I’d show him. My next es-
say would reveal (cleverly, of course) that I didn’t give a tinker’s 
dam for his grade or his comments. “Creative”— indeed!
My second essay might properly have been entitled: 
Love’s labor loosed on William Blake. I strained to see every 
nuance of the “Songs of Innocence.” I combed the poems 
for every mad hint that would help forward my own mad ar-
gument. I never turned my eyes from the text as I sought to 
construct the most infuriating (yet plausible) analysis imagin-
able. I felt my feet dancing to Muhammad Ali rhythms as I 
slaved away, darting logical jabs at Professor C. Watkins who 
would (I was certain) be utterly undone when I threw my irrev-
erent straight right. The paper came back with the comment: 
“This is a maverick argument, but stubbornly logical—A–” 
Bingo! The grade in itself gave me almost enough courage to 
seek him out during offi ce hours—but not quite. I corralled a 
friend to make the pilgrimage with me.
He was extraordinarily gracious on the mid-autumn after-
noon when we had our fi rst long talk. “Come in, Mr. Baker—
Miss Pierce. How are you?” His tie was loose; he was reared 
back in his desk chair. There was a clutter of papers and blue 
books, and they provided a friendly setting for a two-hour 
conversation. . . . We were thrilled that he considered us (po-
tentially) enough like him to invite us to visit him and his wife 
two weeks hence—for dessert.

labels disconnect individuals from meaningful social bonds or 
valued roles. The society creates a negative identity as other or 
to be feared. The young person accepts such negative labels as 
a self-defi nition and proceeds to validate this identity by con-
tinuing to behave in ways that will strengthen it. Some young 
people grow up admiring people who have become very suc-
cessful by following antisocial or criminal paths. Drug lords; 
gang leaders; leaders of groups that advocate hate, violence, 
and vengeance; and people who use elected political posi-
tions for personal gain are all examples of possible role models 
around which a negative identity may be formed.
A negative identity may also emerge as the result of a 
strong identifi cation with someone who is devalued by the 
family or the community. A loving uncle who is an alco-
holic or a clever, creative parent who commits suicide may 
stimulate the crystallization within the adolescent of a self-
construal as one who may share these undesirable character-
istics. Linda, for example, established the negative identity of 
a person going crazy:
Her father was an alcoholic, physically abusive man, who terri-
fi ed her when she was a child. . . . Linda, herself a bright child, 
became by turns the standard bearer for her father’s proud as-
pirations and the target of his jealousy. Midway through grade 
school she began fl unking all her courses and retreating to a 
private world of daydreams. . . . “I always expected hallucina-
tions, being locked up, down the road coming toward me. . . . 
I always resisted seeing myself as an adult. I was afraid that at 
the point I stopped the tape [the years of wild experimenta-
tion] I’d become my parents. . . . My father was the closest 
person I knew to crazy.” (Ochberg, 1986, pp. 296–297)
Identity Confusion
The foreclosed identity and the negative identity both 
resolve the identity crisis in ways that fall short of the goal of 
identity achievement. Yet both still provide the person with 
a concrete identity. The more maladaptive resolution of the 
crisis is identity confusion. Young people in this state are 
unable to make a commitment to any single view of them-
selves. They may be unable to integrate the various roles they 
play. They may be confronted by opposing value systems or 
by a lack of confi dence in their ability to make meaningful 
decisions. Within the private, subjective self, some young 
people may reach later adolescence having diffi culty accept-
ing or establishing clear ego boundaries, or they may not 
experience feelings of agency. Individuals with identity con-
fusion have been shown to have low self-esteem; they are 
more likely than individuals with other identity statuses 
to be infl uenced by peer pressures toward conformity, and 
they approach problem solving with tendencies toward pro-
crastination and avoidance, which contribute to diffi culties 
in adjusting to the college environment (Berzonsky & Kuk, 
2000; Kroger, 2004). At an unconscious level, they may have 
incorporated two or more confl icting ideas about the self—
for example, an abusive, harsh, rejecting powerful father and 
a wise, loving, nurturant, powerful grandmother—that stand 
(1980; Waterman, 1982). Using Erikson’s concepts, Marcia 
assessed identity status on the basis of two criteria: crisis and 
commitment. Crisis in this context refers to a period of role 
experimentation, exploration, and active decision making 
among alternative choices. Commitment consists of a dem-
onstration of personal involvement in the areas of occupa-
tional choice, religion, political ideology, and interpersonal 
relationships. On the basis of Marcia’s interview, the status 
of respondents’ identity development is assessed as identity 
achievement, foreclosure, moratorium, or confusion (see 
Table 10.2). People who are classifi ed as identity achieved 
have already experienced a crisis time and have made occu-
pational and ideological commitments. People who are 
classified as foreclosed have not experienced a crisis but 
demonstrate strong occupational and ideological commit-
ments. Their occupational and ideological beliefs appear to 
be close to those of their parents. The foreclosed identity is 
deceptive. A young person of 18 or 19 who can say exactly 
what she wants in life and who has selected an occupational 
goal may appear to be mature. This kind of clarity of vision 
may impress peers and adults as evidence of a high level of 
self-insight. However, if this solution has been formulated 
through the wholesale adoption of a script that was devised 
by the young person’s family, it may not actually refl ect much 
depth of self-understanding.
People who are classified as being in a state of psycho-
social moratorium are involved in an ongoing exploration 
and experimentation. Their commitments are diffuse. The 
moratorium status is typically an active, open time for gath-
ering information and discovering how one fits in certain 
roles. Finally, people who are classifi ed as identity confused 
may or may not have experienced a crisis, and they demon-
strate a complete lack of commitment. Marcia described the 
 identity-confused group as having a rather cavalier, party atti-
tude that allows members to cope with the college environ-
ment. He suggested that the more seriously confused persons 
(such as those described by Erikson, 1959) may not appear 
in his sample because they are unable to cope with college.
Sometimes, a young person develops a negative identity, 
because the society has labeled the person in a negative way 
(Erikson, 1959). Failure, good-for-nothing, juvenile delinquent, 
hood, gangster, and loser are some of the labels that the adult 
society applies to certain adolescents. Terms such as illegal 
alien or terrorist defi ne individuals as without value to society, 
and as such, impose a negative identity (Lawler, 2008). These

experience into a coordinated, clear self-defi nition is diffi cult 
and time consuming. Adolescents are likely to experience 
moments of self-preoccupation, isolation, and discourage-
ment as the diverse pieces of the puzzle are shifted and reor-
dered into the total picture. Thus, even the eventual positive 
identity formation will be the result of some degree of iden-
tity confusion. The negative outcome of identity confusion, 
however, suggests that the person is never able to formulate 
a satisfying identity that will provide for the convergence of 
multiple identifi cations, aspirations, and roles. Such individ-
uals have the persistent fear that they are losing their hold on 
themselves and on their future.
Identity Formation for Men 
and Women
Questions have been raised about whether the theory of 
identity formation, including the ideas of identity content, 
identity status, and the process of crisis and commitment, 
apply equally well to men and women. Some have argued 
that the concept of identity as it has been formulated is a 
refl ection of a male-oriented culture that focuses heavily 
on occupation and ideology rather than on interpersonal 
commitments as the foundation for identity content. These 
critics suggest that the construct of personal identity places 
greater value on self-sufficiency and autonomy, charac-
teristics associated with the traditional male gender role, 
and less value on the building of close relationships and 
connections to the group, characteristics associated with 
the traditional female gender role (Archer, 1992; Sorrel & 
Montgomery, 2001).
Some evidence of gender differences has been found in 
the content of identity. Erikson’s (1968, 1982) work suggests 
that ideological and vocational commitments are central to 
identity formation. Gilligan (1982/1993) criticized this ori-
entation, arguing that interpersonal commitment may be 
more central for women, and that its clarifi cation opens the 
way for more advanced exploration of vocations and ideol-
ogy. Research fi ndings lend some support to this concept. 
The quality of interpersonal relations and the establishment 
of satisfying social commitments are more central to the con-
tent of personal identity, particularly for women who endorse 
more traditional gender role expectations (Kroger, 2003).
Research comparing the identity status of males and 
females fi nds that the kinds of ego strengths associated with 
identity achievement are equally important to the adap-
tive functioning of men and women (Ginsburg & Orlofsky, 
1981). Few sex differences in identity status have been dis-
covered (Kroger, 1997, 2002). Men and women are equally 
likely to be distributed across the four identity statuses. Over 
the period of later adolescence, they show the same pattern 
of increasing frequencies in the moratorium and achievement 
categories and decreasing frequencies in the foreclosed and 
confused categories (Marcia, 1993; Horst, 1995). For both 
sexes, identity achievement is associated with positive ego 
in opposition to each other. Under any of these conditions, 
the demands for integration and synthesis of a personal iden-
tity arouse anxiety, apathy, and hostility toward the existing 
roles, none of which they can successfully adopt.
In comparison to the moratorium group, young people 
with a confused identity status are less conscientious, more 
likely to experience negative emotions, and more disagree-
able (Clancy & Dollinger, 1993). They are generally not 
outgoing; rather, they describe themselves as self-conscious 
and likely to feel depressed. Their relationship with their 
parents is described as distant or rejecting. Several studies 
have found that some young people who are characterized 
as identity confused have had a history of early and frequent 
involvement with drug use and abuse (Jones, 1992). Diffi -
culties in resolving earlier psychosocial crises—especially 
confl icts related to autonomy versus shame and doubt and 
initiative versus guilt—leave some young people with defi -
cits in ego formation that interfere with the kind of energy 
and playful self-assertiveness that are necessary in the pro-
cess of identity achievement.
Dolores, an unemployed college dropout, describes the 
feeling of meaningless drifting that is associated with identity 
confusion:
I have two sisters, and my father always told me I was the 
smartest of all, that I was smarter than he was, and that 
I could do anything I wanted to do . . . but somehow, I don’t 
really know why, everything I turned to came to nothing. . . . 
I had every opportunity to fi nd out what I really wanted to do.

drifted. [Her voice grew more halting.] I feel my life is such a 
waste. I’d like to write, I really would; but I don’t know. I just 
can’t get going. (Gornick, 1971)
The theoretical construct of identity status assumes a 
developmental progression. Identity confusion refl ects the 
least defi ned status. Movement from confusion to foreclo-
sure, moratorium, and fi nally identity achievement refl ects 
a developmental progression. Movement from any other 
status to confusion suggests regression. A person who has 
achieved identity at one period may conceivably return to 
a crisis period of moratorium. However, those who are in 
a moratorium or achieved status can never be accurately 
described as foreclosed, because by definition they have 
already experienced some degree of crisis (Waterman, 1982; 
Meeus, 1996). A number of studies, both cross-sectional and 
longitudinal, have shown that over time, more young people 
are characterized as having the mature identity statuses of 
moratorium and achievement, and fewer are in foreclosure 
or identity confusion (Yip, Seaton, & Sellers, 2006).
In the process of evolving an individual identity, everyone 
experiences temporary periods of confusion and depression. 
The task of bringing together the many elements of one’s

political theories, join groups that work for political causes, 
or campaign for candidates.
Some researchers have conceptualized the process of role 
experimentation as a cycling of commitment formation and 
commitment reevaluation (Klimstra, Luyckx et al., 2010). 
Early in the identity formation process, this cycle may occur 
frequently, possibly daily, as young people vacillate between 
certainty about their values or commitments and uncertainty 
about whether these commitments make sense. For example, 
as a freshman in college Sam tells his parents that he wants to 
major in political science and become a lawyer. Then, after a 
few weeks he tells his folks that he wants to go into the fi eld of 
foreign service and be a diplomat. By the time Sam comes home 
for Thanksgiving, he is talking about getting more involved in 
the student government, and thinks that when he graduates 
from college he would like to go into politics. By his senior 
year, Sam has changed his mind about his future career fi ve 
or six times, but each time he comes back to his interest in the 
law, and ends up applying to law school. Over time, as com-
mitments become more stable, the young person will experi-
ence greater confi dence and fewer episodes of reevaluation.
During later adolescence, people have few social obliga-
tions that require long-term role commitments. They are free 
to start and stop or to join and quit without serious repercus-
sions to their reputations. As long as no laws are broken in 
the process of experimenting, young people have the oppor-
tunity to play as many roles as they wish in order to prepare 
themselves for the resolution of the identity crisis without 
risking serious social censure.
Psychosocial Moratorium
The process of role experimentation takes many forms. 
Erikson (1959) used the term psychosocial moratorium 
to describe a period of free experimentation before a fi nal 
identity is achieved. Ideally, the moratorium allows individu-
als freedom from the daily expectations for role performance. 
Their experimentation with new roles, values, and belief sys-
tems results in a personal conception of how they can fi t into 
society so as to maximize their personal strengths and gain 
positive recognition from the community. The idea of being 
able to disconnect from daily demands and experiment with 
new roles may be more diffi cult for some later adolescents 
than for others. For example, young people who marry early 
and who go into the labor force right after high school may 
not have the luxury of a moratorium.
The concept of the psychosocial moratorium has been par-
tially incorporated into some college programs that permit stu-
dents to enroll in pass-fail courses before they select a major. 
The concern is to eliminate the problems of external evalu-
ation during the decision-making process. Some high school 
students take a year off for work, travel, or volunteer service 
before deciding about college or a career. College students 
often express a need for a moratorium by leaving school for a 
while, disrupting the expected path of educational and career 
development. They assert their autonomy by imposing their 
qualities: “Identity achieved youths generally exhibit higher 
levels of self-esteem, greater cognitive and ego complexity, 
postconventional levels of moral reasoning, and a strong 
capacity for inner-directed behavior” (CraigBray, Adams, & 
Dobson, 1988, p. 175).
Young men and young women do appear to handle the 
process of role experimentation and identity achievement 
somewhat differently. The uncertainty of the identity crisis is 
more likely to be accompanied by anxiety in women than in 
men (Ollech & McCarthy, 1997). This anxiety may be linked 
to concerns about achievement strivings. Many women 
experience confl ict between their image of femininity and 
their desire to set ambitious personal goals ( Ginsburg & 
Orlofsky, 1981).
Anxiety may also be a product of the general distress 
that women feel when they focus on their own agendas 
rather than on facilitating the agendas of others, as society 
seems to expect them to do. The family context is especially 
important for young women who need to experience con-
tinued attachment with parents in the process of individua-
tion (Schultheiss & Blustein, 1994). The moratorium status, 
which is considered a positive interlude on the path toward 
achievement, has been found to be linked to higher levels 
of self-doubt in women than in men. This fi nding may be 
explained by feelings of guilt that women experience when 
they attempt to assert their self-sufficiency or when they 
try to disconnect from demanding relationships in order to 
focus on their own ideas and needs.
The Central Process: 
Role Experimentation
The concept of identity status, which has dominated the 
research on identity development, implies steps or levels 
of attainment in one’s identity work. This approach may 
obscure the important question of how adolescents go about 
the task of fi guring out their values and commitments. The 
central process of role experimentation suggests an answer 
to this question. Later adolescents experiment with roles 
that represent the many possibilities for their future identi-
ties. They may imagine themselves in a variety of careers in 
an effort to anticipate what it would be like to be members 
of specifi c occupational groups. They may take a variety of 
summer jobs, change their college major, read extensively, 
and daydream about success in several occupations. They 
consider whether to marry, and they begin to defi ne the ideal 
qualities they are looking for in a long-term intimate partner. 
Dating is one form of role experimentation; it allows for a 
different self-presentation with each new date. Friendship is 
another important context within which young people begin 
to clarify their interpersonal commitments. Later adoles-
cents may also evaluate their commitment to their religion, 
consider religious conversion, or experiment with different 
rationales for moral behavior. They may examine a variety of

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
experiences and new information. Michael Berzonsky (1989, 
1993, 2003; Berzonsky & Sullivan, 1992) hypothesized that 
in later adolescence, individuals differ in how they select, 
process, and apply self-relevant information. Three types 
of approaches to identity-related information processing 
were described, each with a somewhat different implica-
tion for the place of role experimentation in the resolution 
of the identity search. The informational types “actively seek 
out and evaluate self-diagnostic information when negotiat-
ing identity issues and making decisions” (Berzonsky, 1993, 
p. 289). The normative types are “relatively more defensive 
and closed to feedback that may threaten hard core areas of 
the self” (Berzonsky, 1993, p. 290). The diffuse-avoidant types 
“procrastinate and delay dealing with self-relevant issues as 
long as possible. When push comes to shove, they tend to 
be infl uenced by immediate rewards and operate in a situa-
tion-sensitive fashion” (Berzonsky, 1993, p. 290). The three 
identity-processing styles are associated with distinct pat-
terns of defense mechanisms that come into play when later 
adolescents encounter confl icts or threats to their identity. 
The informational types use cognitive strategies to minimize 
anxiety. The diffuse-avoidant types use defenses that turn 
aggression inward toward the self or outward, blaming oth-
ers. The normative types use mechanisms of denial, distor-
tion, and negation to defend against threatening information 
(Berzonsky & Kinney, 2008).
An implication of this theory of styles of identity-related 
information processing is that the path toward identity status 
depends in part on how willing a young person is to engage 
in role experimentation. The informational types are most 
likely to initiate role experimentation as a means of clarify-
ing existing beliefs and values. The normative types have 
to process contradictions among the demands and expecta-
tions of the varying roles they play, but if possible, they will 
probably avoid novel experiences that would challenge their 
views. The diffuse-avoidant types may engage in role experi-
mentation if it is viewed as cool or is positively regarded 
among others in their peer group, but they probably would 
not take the initiative to seek out new experiences as a con-
scious, proactive strategy. Figure 10.4 shows the relationship 
between the three information-seeking styles and the four 
identity statuses described earlier. In this model, exploration 
or seeking information is associated with both the morato-
rium and the achieved statuses (White, Wampler, & Winn, 
1998).
Role experimentation implies an active process by which 
later adolescents sort through various identifi cations, scripts, 
and social pressures in order to fi nd their niche. For some 
young people, however, a turning point or critical incident 
marks the point of commitment. Often, a dramatic loss, an 
unexpected victory, or an experience of victimization can 
help crystallize a young person’s vision of how the self can 
fi t in with the community or transcend the community. Two 
examples of turning points are illustrated in the following 
case study.
own timetable and agenda on a socially prescribed sequence. 
Travel abroad is another strategy for experiencing moratorium. 
The time spent in another culture can give students an oppor-
tunity to demonstrate their self-sufficiency, examine many 
of their assumptions about values and goals, express their 
individuality, and break out of whatever social environment 
they may feel is constraining or overshadowing their sense 
of self. The moratorium offers temporary relief from external 
demands and an opportunity to establish their identity.
As parents observe the process of role experimentation, 
they may become concerned because their adolescent son 
or daughter appears to be abandoning the traditional family 
value orientation or lifestyle. The adolescent talks of changing 
religions, remaining single, or selecting a low-status career. 
The more vehemently the family responds to these proposi-
tions, the more likely the young person is to become locked 
into a position in order to demonstrate autonomy rather than 
being allowed to continue the experimentation until a more 
suitable personal alternative is discovered. Many adolescents 
seem to want to take a shocking stand or to question the 
unquestionable so that they have a feeling of control—a feel-
ing that they have chosen their own path rather than simply 
followed the one carved out for them by their family, culture, 
and time in history. Parents are well advised to understand 
role experimentation as the expression of an appropriate 
developmental process in which a young person is trying on 
various roles, beliefs, and philosophies to see how they fi t. 
If at all possible, parents need to trust in this process, giving 
their opinions and reactions when appropriate, but encour-
aging the young person to find the combination of roles, 
values, goals, and commitments that bring her the greatest 
feelings of enthusiasm and optimism about her own future.

For some later adolescents, the psychosocial moratorium allows

their physical capabilities.

The following two examples illustrate how a critical life event 
can refocus personal identity toward a new consolidation of 
energy, purpose, and commitment. In the fi rst example, Sul-
livan experiences personal losses that lead to a new occupa-
tional and value commitment. In the second example, Rachel 
experiences a national tragedy that reorients her political 
ideology.
SULLIVAN
With her mother, Sullivan was living in a housing project. In 
high school, when life got very hard, she began drinking and 
using drugs. She often stayed out late “to all hours” without 
her mother knowing or caring. Her father stepped in, put 
his foot down, and tried to teach her better habits. Soon 
after high school, she eloped with a young man who tried 
to control her and keep her from going to college. . . . The 
marriage ended after two years, then tragedy followed. An 
old boyfriend of Sullivan’s committed suicide, and shortly 
thereafter her sister was hospitalized because of a suicide 
attempt.

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
 3. Resistance and immersion. Rejection of many elements of 
the dominant culture; education about and involvement 
in one’s own ethnic group and its beliefs, values, and 
practices.
 4. Introspection. Critical examination of the values, beliefs, 
and practices of both the dominant culture and one’s 
own ethnic group’s views.
 5. Articulation and awareness. Identifi cation of those values, 
beliefs, and practices from the dominant culture and 
from one’s own ethnic group that are combined into a 
unique synthesis that forms a personal, cultural identity.
In this model, one recognizes the interaction between 
ethnic identity and personal identity (Rotheram-Borus & 
Wyche, 1994; Cross & Fhagen-Smith, 2001). Not all 
young people experience all of these stages. Some children 
are raised in families where ethnic socialization begins at a 
young age, and they never experience a sense of accepting 
the dominant culture. In fact, if they are raised in a racially 
segregated community, they may not encounter members of 
the dominant culture as signifi cant fi gures during their early 
childhood years.
For many people, the stage of articulation and awareness 
may not occur until sometime later in adulthood. But for 
many, later adolescence is the period when exploration about 
ethnic identity is highlighted (see the box “Ethnic Identity 
and Adjustment”). The transitions from Stage 1 (conformity) 
to Stages 2 and 3 are commonly stimulated by the college 
experience. Ethnic identity exploration and commitment typ-
ically increase over the college years (Sayed & Azmitia, 2009). 
The student body is usually much more diverse than one’s 
high school. Young people of many racial, ethnic, social-class, 
regional, and religious backgrounds come together in college 
and are expected to live together in the residence halls, learn 
together in the classrooms, and collaborate in college organi-
zations, social activities, sports, and cultural events. Exposure 
to this diversity may be accompanied by experiences of racial 
and ethnic prejudice, cultural ethnocentrism, and intergroup 
confl ict. At the same time, racial diversity often contributes to 
more divergent thinking, introduces new perspectives, and, 
as a result, promotes more complex thinking about social 
issues (Antonio, Chang et al., 2004). Exposure to the college 
curriculum offers an intellectual framework for understand-
ing the historical, psychological, and sociological foundations 
of racism, prejudice, and cultural confl ict (Phinney, 1996b).
For young people who remain in low-income, urban 
communities and do not attend college, the interaction of 
ethnic identity and personal identity can serve as an adaptive 
process for coping with high-risk environments. Identifi ca-
tion with the history, struggles, and heroism of one’s people 
serves as an anchor of dignity and hope in communities 
that are disrupted by unemployment and violence (Spencer, 
Cunningham, & Swanson, 1995). Through interaction with 
other members of their ethnic group, young people build 
competence and a set of strategies for managing the poverty 
and hostility that they face.

CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. How are turning points different from role 
 experimentation?
 2. What might determine whether a turning point leads to 
identity achievement or identity confusion?
 3. What is the difference between the events that Sullivan 
experienced and those that Rachel experienced? How 
might the differences in these two kinds of events relate 
to subsequent identity work?
 4. What factors might be necessary to preserve the focus 
and sense of purpose that are evoked in these critical life 
events? For example, how might family support, the re-
sponse of close friends, or opportunities for enacting new 
roles infl uence whether these changes are sustained?
Role Experimentation and 
Ethnic Identity
In Chapter 9 (Early Adolescence), we introduced the idea that 
group identity precedes individual identity. One component 
of group identity is an orientation toward one’s ethnic group. 
Efforts to understand one’s ethnic identity and to clarify 
one’s commitment to a particular ethnic subculture lead to 
self-defi nition that facilitates work on personal identity as 
well (Yip, Seaton, & Sellers, 2006). Part of forming a clear 
sense of personal identity requires an understanding of one’s 
ancestry, especially one’s cultural and ethnic heritage and the 
values, beliefs, and traditions that may have shaped one’s 
childrearing environment as well as one’s vision of the future. 
Ethnic group identity typically involves the incorporation 
of certain ideals, values, and beliefs that are specifi c to that 
ethnic group; a sense of how this ethnic group is regarded 
by outsiders; and the way in which one orients oneself with 
respect to this group—that is, whether one seeks out other 
members of the group, feels proud of one’s membership in it, 
and has positive attitudes about it (Cross, 1991).
As you might imagine, young people make the transi-
tion from early to later adolescence having done different 
amounts of work in exploring their ethnic group identity. 
One theory of ethnic minority identity development offers a 
fi ve-stage model (Atkinson, Morten, & Sue, 1983):
 1. Conformity. Identifi cation with the values, beliefs, and 
practices of the dominant culture.
 2. Dissonance. Recognition and confusion about areas of 
confl ict between the values, beliefs, and practices of the 
dominant culture and those of one’s own ethnic group.

 
The Prime Adaptive Ego Quality and the Core Pathology | 421
Fidelity to Values and Ideologies
Fidelity to values and ideologies is closely linked with the 
notion of commitment. In later adolescence, the ego strength 
of fidelity refers to “the ability to sustain loyalties freely 
pledged in spite of the inevitable contradictions and confu-
sions of value systems” (Erikson, 1978, p. 28). Fidelity incor-
porates the trust and hope of infancy and directs it toward a 
belief in values and ideologies. Fidelity may be fostered by 
identifi cation with inspirational role models or by participa-
tion in meaningful institutions. It is also achieved as a result 
of the new cognitive capacities of adolescence that permit self-
refl ection, relativistic thinking, and insight. Fidelity to values 
and ideals provides evidence of a refl ective person who has 
taken time to struggle with opposing views and to select those 
that best refl ect personal convictions (Waterman, 1992).
The emergence of fi delity to values provides a channel for 
guiding strong passions and drives toward the achievement 
of meaningful goals. At the close of later adolescence, young 
people who articulate specifi c values and goals, such as mak-
ing a contribution to their community, gaining new levels of 
expertise in their chosen fi eld, or establishing a loving, caring 
relationship, are more likely to experience a sense of subjec-
tive well-being in the years ahead as they take deliberate steps 
toward goal attainment (Bauer & McAdams, 2010). Fidelity 
to values strengthens one’s ethical resolve, especially in the 
face of the many pressures and temptations of adult life. It also 
creates a bond of belonging with others who share the same 
loyalties. At the same time, fi delity in the individual strength-
ens the society by drawing on the commitments of those who 
share a common set of values to sustain and support basic 
institutions, such as religious organizations, political parties, 
educational institutions, and social service agencies.
Fidelity to values and ideologies is closely linked to the 
developmental tasks of autonomy, gender identity, moral 
development, and career choice. In each of these domains, 
the young person faces challenges that may undermine self-
respect, or that may foster in-group favoritism over out-
group derogation. When individuals perceive their own 
personal or group identity to be threatened, they are more 
likely to withdraw, lash out, or reject the values of others. 
On the other hand, when individuals perceive a context 
of acceptance, inclusion, and fair treatment, they are more 
likely to be open to dialogue and cooperation. We do not 
know which values a young person will embrace. However, 
the more individuals are treated in a humane, respectful, and 
inclusive manner, the greater the likelihood that these values 
will be refl ected in their outlook toward others (Andersen, 
Downey, & Tyler, 2005).
Repudiation
Repudiation refers to a rejection of certain values, beliefs, and 
roles. In the diverse and pluralistic society of the United States, 
some degree of repudiation may be necessary in order to forge 
an integrated identity. One cannot embrace all ideologies and 
The Prime Adaptive Ego 
Quality and the Core 
Pathology
In the process of resolving the crisis of identity versus iden-
tity confusion, later adolescents have to examine their values 
and goals. This process relies upon more advanced execu-
tive functioning, including the capacity to take a step back 
from one’s current commitments and refl ect on their mean-
ing as well as an ability to deliberately seek out new sources 
of information and ideas that can inform personal decisions 
(Klimstra et al., 2010). As a result of this refl ective work, later 
adolescents who achieve a sense of personal identity are also 
likely to benefi t from a clearer, more confi dent sense of their 
values and beliefs. In contrast, later adolescents who experi-
ence identity confusion are likely to leave this stage of life 
with the core pathology of repudiation—a rejection or stand-
ing against rather than standing for specifi c beliefs and values.
The college environment provides an opportunity for students 
to learn about their cultural identities and the history of their 
ethnic groups.

believe that their culture, their ethnic identity, or their reli-
gion is mocked or berated. They may transform the mistrust 
and shame of childhood into fury against the other. The 
energy of youth that can mobilize noble, courageous acts of 
fi delity can also crystallize around hate, turning against one 
or more groups in acts of violence.
APPLIED TOPIC
Dropping Out of College
Objective 6. To examine some of the predictors and 
consequences of dropping out of college.
THERE IS GROWING national concern about the large 
percentage of students who attend college and then leave 
roles; each commitment brings some boundaries to one’s values 
and limits one’s investment to a certain vision of the self con-
tinuing into the future. Repudiation can serve as a mechanism 
for intergenerational change. For example, a young person may 
decide that he will reject the characteristics of an unloving or 
abusive parent. In this context, the young person will form 
his identity around suppressing certain negative qualities and 
learning to enact and endorse opposing positive qualities.
In the extreme case, repudiation results in a hostile rejec-
tion of all the ideas, values, and groups that do not adhere 
to one’s own beliefs (Erikson, 1982). It fosters a rigid world-
view that does not admit to the contributions of others’ 
ideas. The roots of militancy, prejudice, and terrorism lie in 
the formation of the core pathology of repudiation. Imagine 
young people who, on the threshold of adulthood, see their 
future as grim or hopeless. They may perceive themselves as 
subjugated victims, rejected by the mainstream. They may 
ETHNIC IDENTITY HAS been studied 
for individual ethnic groups as a com-
ponent of the self-concept, usually 
focusing on how important people’s 
ethnicity is to them, how often they 
think about themselves as members 
of their ethnic group, and how close 
they feel to other members of their 
ethnic group (Sears, Fu, Henry, & Bui, 
2003). Ethnic identity has also been 
measured as a general concept, 
allowing one to compare the strength 
of ethnic identity across groups. The 
Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure 
(MEIM) is one such measure, which 
consists of two subscales (Phinney, 
1992; Roberts et al., 1999):
 1. Affi rmation, belonging, and com-
mitment, which assesses one’s 
feelings of connection and pride 
in membership.
 2. Ethnic identity search, a develop-
mental and cognitive component, 
which assesses a person’s efforts 
to be involved in activities and 
practices associated with their 
ethnic group, and to increase their 
understanding of the group and 
its history and traditions.
The MEIM allows one to 
characterize individuals along a 
continuum from an unexamined 
ethnic identity acquired with little 
exploration or commitment (low 
ethnic identity) to a well-developed, 
achieved ethnic identity (Yasui, 
Dorham, & Dishion, 2004). The 
parallels with personal identity 
status are striking, capturing the two 
processes of exploration (crisis) and 
commitment.
Ethnic identity, as measured 
by the MEIM, has been positively 
associated with self-esteem 
across middle childhood, early 
adolescence, and later adolescence. 
Individuals with positive ethnic 
identity have been found to deal 
more effectively with threatening 
social situations involving dis-
crimination and stereotyping 
(Roberts et al., 1999). A sense of 
belonging to one’s ethnic group may 
be important as part of one’s social 
identity for all groups. However, 
the salience of ethnic identity is 
not the same for all groups. The 
establishment of a clear acceptance 
of their ethnic identity may be 
especially relevant for those who 
face discrimination or oppression 
on the basis of their ethnic 
membership.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. The MEIM has two scales: ethnic 
identity search; and affi rmation, 
belonging, and commitment. How 
well do you think these scales 
capture the meaning of ethnic 
identity? What other dimensions 
would you add if you were going 
to modify this measure?
 2. What are the parallels between 
ethnic identity achievement and 
personal identity achievement? 
How might they relate to each 
other as the person matures? Can 
you imagine having an achieved 
personal identity without a clear 
ethnic identity? What about vice 
versa?
 3. Do you think ethnic identity is 
equally important for all ethnic 
groups? For all members of an 
ethnic group? What factors 
might determine how important 
or salient ethnic identity is for an 
individual or for an ethnic group?
 4. What implications might one’s 
ethnic identity achievement have 
for the developmental tasks of 
autonomy from parents, gender 
identity, moral development, and 
career choice?

uncomfortable about borrowing more. Many students have 
financial responsibilities for their family members. Unex-
pected fees, and textbook and laboratory costs associated 
with college courses, are more diffi cult to cover for students 
from poor families, because they have less access to supple-
mental financial resources. These students’ parents have 
fewer resources, and cannot help them meet unanticipated 
expenses. Students who dedicate their summer earnings to 
paying for tuition and fees do not have enough discretionary 
income to cover unanticipated costs.
In order to manage the fi nancial requirements of attend-
ing college, many students from low-income families make a 
combination of decisions that put them at risk for dropping 
out of college. They decide to save money by living at home, 
and they work more hours a week at jobs to help defray 
expenses. Both of these factors, living off campus and work-
ing long hours, are associated with an increased likelihood 
of dropping out of college (Bozick, 2007). Because they are 
not living on campus, they are less likely to feel a part of the 
college community, and less likely to benefi t from the friend-
ship and social and academic support of other students. In 
addition, working 20 hours per week or more makes it just 
about impossible to become involved with campus activi-
ties or informal friendships that might increase feelings of 
belonging and help provide resourceful ideas about how to 
cope with the academic and career preparation demands of 
college. When demands from classes confl ict with demands 
from work, students from low-income families are less likely 
to be able to cut back on work hours.
In many cases, students from low-income families have 
had to establish independent financial status, and do not 
receive any funds from parents. Students from very poor 
families may also have attended high schools that did not 
provide adequate academic preparation, resulting in a 
requirement to take additional developmental coursework 
that does not count toward a college degree (Stinebrickner & 
Stinebrickner, 2006). Over time, students who are working 
at a job many hours a week just to keep up with tuition pay-
ments may fi nd that life in college is more stressful and less 
enjoyable than it seems to be worth.
Academic Preparation
The following factors that precede college enrollment have 
all been found to relate to college retention and graduation:
• Attendance at a college-oriented high school
• Participation in a college-preparatory curriculum
• Parents’ educational background
• Family’s educational values and goals
• The student’s intention to attend college
• Clarity of career goals
• High school coursework and grades
High school GPA and SAT and ACT scores have been 
identified as strong retention predictors (Astin, Korn, & 
Green, 1987). A rigorous high school curriculum is the 
without a degree. In general, the percentage of the U.S. popu-
lation with advanced degrees has not grown much over the 
past 10 years. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau (2010) show 
that among those ages 25 to 34, about 30% have a bachelor’s 
or advanced graduate or professional degree. Although the 
majority of high school graduates (67% in 2007) attend some 
type of postsecondary institution in the year following high 
school, many do not graduate. According to a report of the 
National Center for Higher Education Management Systems 
(NCHEMS, 2010), in 2008 the national graduation rate for 
4-year colleges was 56% after 6 years. The graduation rate 
for 2-year colleges was 27.5% after 3 years. These rates differ 
by state, type of institution (public or private, research uni-
versity or liberal arts college), and by students’ race/ethnicity 
and family economic resources. Degree completion is nota-
bly lower for students entering college whose families have 
limited economic resources, and for certain ethnic minorities, 
who tend to be overrepresented among low-income families.
Models of student retention and persistence suggest that 
degree completion is a result of the interaction of four classes 
of factors: fi nancial factors, academic preparation, personal 
factors, and characteristics of the college environment (New-
man & Newman, 1999).
Financial Factors
The cost of tuition, room, board, and fees increased 21.6% at 
public universities and 20% at private universities (adjusted 
for inflation) from the 1999–2000 academic year to the 
2007–2008 academic year (NCES, 2010). These increases 
far outpaced the average increase in family income over the 
same period. Among college freshmen, about two thirds state 
that they are either somewhat or very concerned about their 
ability to fi nance their college education (Marchand, 2010). 
It is no surprise that college students in the lowest quartile 
of family income are less likely to graduate than those in 
the higher quartiles. Students from poor families are more 
likely to be working several jobs to pay for school. Often 
they are troubled by the burden of growing debt and are

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
• An inability to cope with the new demands for autonomy, 
time management, and competition
• Disillusionment with the environment of college
• Discouragement or confusion about one’s ability to 
achieve important goals
• The onset of mental health problems
• Alcohol or drug abuse/use
• Victimization
The college environment presents new challenges to men-
tal health. Many students suffer from mental health problems 
that were managed satisfactorily in high school, but that 
become more challenging in the college environment. Away 
from family, friends, and familiar medical resources, students 
may stop taking their medication, become overwhelmed 
by anxiety or depression, or engage in new risky behav-
iors that impede their ability to concentrate. Being away 
from home may result in unexpected feelings of loneliness 
and isolation. The college environment typically introduces 
new opportunities to make decisions about daily life, and, 
as a result, brings new demands for time management. Stu-
dents may feel unable to succeed at the academic or social 
demands of the environment. They may feel overwhelmed 
by the number of tasks or the social stimulation. Students 
who are participating in competitive athletics may have dif-
fi culty meeting expectations to perform at a new, high level. 
Feelings of being overwhelmed or overloaded may result in 
poor academic performance or low levels of life satisfaction 
that can lead to dropping out of school ( Larson, 2006).
African American and Hispanic American students leave 
college at a higher rate than European American students, 
even when controlling for family income. This pattern is 
often attributed to a lack of a sense of connection or belong-
ing in the college environment. Students who are doing well 
academically may decide to leave an environment where they 
are alienated, targets of discrimination, or disconnected from 
faculty and students (Schwitzer & Thomas, 1998; Murtaugh, 
Burns, & Schuster, 1999).
Characteristics of the College 
Environment
Characteristics of the college environment have also been 
associated with student retention. In a study of student 
retention at colleges and universities with large numbers of 
low-income students, the Pell Foundation compared schools 
with higher than average and lower than average graduation 
rates (Muraskin & Lee, 2004). School structure was asso-
ciated with graduation rates. Universities characterized as 
Research I, where there were more graduate students and a 
greater emphasis on faculty research, had higher retention 
and graduation rates than the bachelor’s degree/specialized 
colleges. Those institutions with higher graduation rates 
had more full-time students, a larger student enrollment, 
and more graduate students. These schools enrolled more 
students from the top half of their high school graduat-
ing classes. They had more full-time faculty, lower student/
strongest predictor of postsecondary persistence and success 
(Adelman, 1999). Students with inadequate academic prepa-
ration and lack of familiarity with the college environment 
are more likely to leave before graduating.
There is growing concern among college faculty that stu-
dents are not prepared to meet their expectations for writing, 
mathematics, independent work, critical thinking, detailed 
examination of information, and complex problem solving 
(Sanoff, 2006). Early failure experiences in college courses 
can result in a decision to drop out of college. Michael Van 
Adams’ story illustrates this process:
Van Adams . . . told himself that the University of Maine 
wasn’t for him. He dropped out a couple of weeks before 
completing his fi rst semester. “Frankly, I wasn’t properly 
prepared for college,” he says. “I didn’t go into my freshman 
year with the right attitude. At age 18, I thought I had the 
world fi gured out; I thought I could ace my college classes 
like in high school. I couldn’t have been more off. I was 
failing three classes, and I didn’t see the point of sticking 
around.” (Whitbourne, 2002)
College mathematics and science courses are prerequisites 
for many majors. Students who fail an early mathematics or 
science course may realize that they will not be admitted to 
the major of their choice and decide to leave school. Stu-
dents who have been accustomed to ranking in the top 10% 
of their high school class may be shocked to receive grades of 
C or D in college courses, and they may assume that they do 
not have the ability to do college work. Many colleges have 
cut back on offering precollegiate or developmental courses 
in writing, mathematics, and science, thereby removing the 
support for students whose high school curriculum did not 
prepare them adequately for college-level work.
Personal Factors
The theme of personal identity and its salience in later ado-
lescence is central to the decision to remain in college or 
leave. For many students, the decision to go to college is a 
commitment to a view of oneself in the future as a person 
who is more accomplished, prepared to function at a higher 
level, earning a better income, and being in a better position 
to direct the course of one’s life. Within the college environ-
ment, identity work can be fostered as one is supported by 
others who validate the sense of a future self that is taking 
shape. It can be reassuring to be surrounded by others who 
have similar academic aspirations. Interacting and identify-
ing with faculty and graduate students who are pursuing 
interests as models for the future, the young person begins to 
see how personal goals may be attained. College coursework 
and interactions with peers can result in growth in world-
view and exposure to new models of organizing, analyzing, 
and representing experience.
A variety of personal factors can interfere with this pro-
cess. Once in college, the level of a student’s social and aca-
demic integration, along with his intent to complete college, 
can affect decisions to stay in school. Factors that can con-
tribute to dropping out of college may include:

 
Chapter Summary | 425
can cover some of their uncertainty by saying, “I’m in col-
lege.” Dropping out means losing this protective, if somewhat 
ambiguous, role. This decision brings a need to recalculate 
and reorganize one’s trajectory for the transition into adult-
hood. This task may be diffi cult and confusing because the 
identity work needed to fl ourish outside of college is different 
than the identity work required of the college student.
Dropping out has an impact on short- and long-term 
earnings. Leaving college has significant financial impli-
cations that will impact the young person’s autonomy and 
capacity for fi nancial self-suffi ciency. As presented in Table 
10.1, the median income for a person who has some college 
but no degree is only slightly more than for a person who has 
graduated from high school. In some states, like California, 
New York, and New Jersey, the difference in median annual 
income between college graduates and high school graduates 
who are in their twenties is $12,000 to $13,000 (NCHEMS, 
2007). This difference in earning capacity increases as peo-
ple move into their middle adulthood because opportunities 
for advancement are associated with higher levels of educa-
tion. Moreover, those who attend college for a year or two 
and then leave are likely to have debts from tuition, fees, and 
other costs that they carry with them without hope of the 
increase in salary that might help them repay those debts.
Reduced educational attainment will have an impact on 
occupation. This in turn may have consequences for one’s 
social status in the community. Dropping out of college may be 
accompanied by the loss of a peer group and the need to cre-
ate a new social network, and the possibility of disappointing 
family members. The lack of a college degree may make one a 
less desirable life partner and reduce one’s marriage prospects.
Given the fl exibility of the higher education system in the 
United States, there are many opportunities to reengage the 
college environment, including online enrollment, part-time 
status, evening and weekend courses, and continuing edu-
cation. We do not know much about the process through 
which students who leave college without a degree decide to 
return or how they make meaning of their disrupted college 
years. One might wonder whether the experiences leave a 
person with a feeling of regret about unrealized promise, or 
if they are able to identify a more authentic set of life goals 
that can be achieved without benefi t of a college education. 
There are many instances of people who do not graduate 
from high school or college, but who become engaged in cre-
ative, productive lives. A number of successful actors, sing-
ers, models, athletes, inventors, entrepreneurs, and authors 
have taken the noncollegiate route, choosing to use these 
years to become clearer about their life goals and to develop 
their talents (collegedropoutshalloffame.com, 2010).
faculty ratios, and smaller classes. As a related factor, they 
spent more money per student full-time equivalent (FTE), 
and tuition and fees were higher, but these colleges were able 
to offset these costs with more grants to students.
Beyond these structural features, colleges and universi-
ties that were successful in graduating their low-income 
students focused on fi ve aspects of the college environment 
(Muraskin & Lee, 2004):
• Building academic skills
• Providing fi nancial support
• Working with students to help them clarify their aca-
demic direction
• Fostering a personalized environment for instruction and 
academic support
• Encouraging campus participation
At the colleges that are successful in graduating relatively 
large numbers of low-income students, one is likely to fi nd 
pre-college or pre-enrollment courses to prepare students for 
the tone and tempo of college courses; supplemental services 
such as focused, proactive academic advising, study groups, 
and writing centers; and special housing groups, affinity 
groups, and interest groups to support students of com-
mon interest or background. Many of these campuses offer 
undergraduates research experiences with encouragement 
to consider graduate school. They create learning communi-
ties, and organize students into social and academic groups 
in order to create a more personalized educational envi-
ronment. These institutions express their commitment to 
retention and graduation through the ways faculty and staff 
interact with students, the care that is taken to create a sup-
portive environment, and the encouragement that students 
experience to achieve their goals.
The Consequences of Dropping 
Out of College
In comparison to the research that has been done to predict 
student retention, relatively little is known about how students 
who drop out of college cope with this disrupted educational 
trajectory and its impact on their transition into adulthood. 
Dropping out of college does not necessarily solve the young 
person’s problems, and may introduce new ones. Abandoning 
the set of goals and activities that are linked to college atten-
dance leaves the student in a directional vacuum. Formulating 
another set of goals and becoming involved in the activities 
required to achieve these goals may be diffi cult. There may be 
new pressures on the college dropout as people ask, “What 
are you going to do now?” While enrolled in college, students 
Chapter Summary
At the close of later adolescence, most young people are 
making the transition from childhood to adulthood. How-
ever, the process is gradual for most and increasingly pro-
longed into the decades of the twenties and thirties.
Objective 1. To examine the concept of autonomy from 
parents and the conditions under which autonomy is 
likely to be achieved.

CHAPTER 10 Later Adolescence (18 to 24 Years)
experimentation, introspection, self-evaluation, fact fi nding, 
and intuition. As such, this choice becomes intimately inter-
woven with one’s psychological development.
Objective 5. To defi ne and describe the psychosocial 
crisis of later adolescence, individual identity versus 
identity confusion; the central process through which 
this crisis is resolved, role experimentation; the prime 
adaptive ego quality of fi delity to values and ideals; and 
the core pathology of repudiation.
Those who have resolved the psychosocial crisis of indi-
vidual identity versus identity confusion have an integrated 
identity that includes a defi nition of themselves as sexual, 
moral, political, and career participants. Identity achieve-
ment represents a private sense of unity and confi dence in 
one’s beliefs as well as a more public integration of roles and 
commitments to specifi c values.
The strain of this stage is felt in the tension between the 
person’s need to question and experiment and the society’s 
expectations for closure on signifi cant themes, particularly 
occupation, gender identity, and political ideology. The 
expansion of roles and relationships exposes many young 
people to new views that require evaluation. The crisis of 
individual identity versus identity confusion suggests a 
new synthesis of earlier identifi cations, present values, and 
future goals into a consistent self-concept. This unity of self 
is achieved only after a period of uncertainty and open ques-
tioning. Role experimentation during this time is an essen-
tial strategy for coping with new information and new value 
orientations. Once young people know what they stand for, 
they can commit themselves more deeply to others.
The prime adaptive ego quality of fidelity reflects the 
capacity to commit oneself to an ideology or belief sys-
tem. The core pathology of repudiation suggests an intense 
rejection of certain values and beliefs. Although most later 
adolescents are forming a positive vision of the self that is 
connected to a shared community, some are defi ning them-
selves in opposition, as rebels, terrorists, or avengers.
Objective 6. To examine some of the predictors and 
consequences of dropping out of college.
The applied topic, dropping out of college, illustrates the fl u-
idity of this period. Identity work, which requires an integra-
tion of one’s biological, psychological, and social selves, takes 
place in concrete settings where daily demands and expecta-
tions must be met. Societal expectations set many young peo-
ple on a path toward college that they cannot follow, whether 
for fi nancial, academic, personal, or situational reasons. The 
disruption of this academic trajectory poses signifi cant chal-
lenges for establishing a life structure into adulthood. At the 
same time, it may invite more serious and considered refl ec-
tion about what a person wants out of life and the activities 
and resources that will be required to achieve those goals.
Later adolescents are striving for self-suffi ciency in a complex 
culture. Many have achieved a new degree of independence 
from their parents, so that ties of love, trust, and support are 
expressed within a framework of mutual respect and autono-
mous decision making. The process of achieving autonomy 
from parents opens the door to new considerations of basic 
ego structures, including gender identity, morality, and career 
aspirations. In each of these areas, a young person has the 
cognitive ability to refl ect on the earlier socialization pres-
sures of family and neighborhood and to construct a per-
sonal point of view.
Objective 2. To trace the development of gender 
identity in later adolescence, including a discussion of 
how the components of gender role identifi cation that 
were relevant during the early-school-age period are 
revised and expanded.
The formulation of gender identity requires an integration 
of the biological, psychological, and societal meanings asso-
ciated with being a man or a woman. It is a powerful lens 
through which many other aspects of personal identity are 
interpreted, including the content of values, commitment to 
family relationships, preferences and expectations for career 
choice, and beliefs about one’s role in an intimate relationship.
Objective 3. To describe the maturation of morality 
in later adolescence, with special focus on the role 
of new cognitive capacities that infl uence moral 
judgments and the various value orientations that 
underlie moral reasoning.
Exposure to a diversity of information, relationships, and 
worldviews stimulates moral reasoning. The change from 
conventional to postconventional morality that often occurs 
during later adolescence involves a rethinking of tradi-
tional moral principles. During this period, there may be a 
loosening of ties to the family of origin and an increase in 
encounters with an expanding network of friends, students, 
and coworkers. Through interactions with diverse reference 
groups, there is an increasing recognition of the subcultural 
relativity of one’s moral code. There may also be a degree of 
confl ict over which moral values have personal meaning.
Objective 4. To analyze the process of career choice, 
with attention to education and gender role socialization 
as two major infl uential factors.
The process of career choice, often accompanied by periods 
of uncertainty and confusion, is infl uenced by interacting 
factors, including personal abilities and attributes, emotional 
and motivational factors, family and societal factors, educa-
tional background, gender identity and gender role socializa-
tion, and the situational realities of the current labor market. 
Ideally, one’s choice of occupation is the result of personal

Further Reflection
What distinguishes the stage of later adolescence from early 
adolescence and early adulthood?
 1. How is the process of achieving autonomy from parents 
related to identity development?
 2. What changes would you expect to see in gender identity 
over the college years? Do you think men and women 
become more traditional or more nontraditional in their 
views about gender roles during college? Why?
 3. What aspects of the college experience infl uence moral 
development? What is the direction of that infl uence?
 4. Consider the bidirectional infl uence of career decision 
making and identity development. How do the two in-
fl uence each other?
 5. What are some contemporary factors that may make it 
diffi cult to resolve the confl ict of individual identity ver-
sus identity confusion during the period from ages 18 
to 24?
 6. What is ethnic identity? How does it contribute to ad-
justment and identity achievement in later adolescence?

CHAPTER 11 Early  Adulthood  (24 to 34 years)
Major Concepts in the Study 
of Adulthood
Objective 1. To identify and defi ne selected concepts that 
are especially relevant for understanding development 
during adulthood, including social roles, the life course, 
and fulfi llment theories.
In Chapter 2 (Major Theories for Understanding Human 
Development) and Chapter 3 (Psychosocial Theory) we intro-
duce a variety of theoretical concepts that explain the processes 
of continuity and change over the life span. In this chapter, 
we expand the discussion of theoretical constructs that help 
account for the directions of growth in adult life. The biologi-
cal, psychological, and societal systems continue to interact, 
 1. To identify and defi ne selected concepts that are 
especially relevant for understanding development 
during adulthood, including social roles, the life 
course, and fulfi llment theories.
 2. To analyze the process of forming intimate 
relationships, including initial attractions, mate 
selection, and commitment to a long-term relationship; 
the role of cohabitation in forming close relationships; 
and the challenges that one faces in adjusting to the 
early years of marriage.
 3. To describe the factors associated with the decision 
to have children, the impact of childbearing on 
the intimate relationship, the developing parental 
relationship, and the contribution of childbearing to 
growth in adulthood.
 4. To explore the concept of work as a stimulus for 
psychosocial development in early adulthood, 
with  special focus on the technical skills, authority 
relations, demands and hazards, and interpersonal 
relations in the work environment.
 5. To examine the concept of lifestyle as the expression

Chapter Objectives
WELCOME TO THE study of adulthood. All that has gone 
before can be seen as preparation; all that follows can be 
viewed as actualization. We have considered psychoso-
cial development through seven preparatory stages of 
life, encompassing approximately 24 years. During these 
stages, an individual undergoes rapid physical, cognitive, 
social, and emotional development. In the United States, 
life expectancy at birth is currently about 78 years. Thus, 
more than 50 years remain after the seven preparatory 
stages. In our conceptual scheme, four stages of psycho-
social development unfold during these 50 years. In this 
chapter, we discuss a few theoretical concepts about de-
velopment in adulthood, and then we address the period 
of early adulthood.
but the nature of lives becomes increasingly diverse and more 
diffi cult to characterize as stage-like over time. Life stories are 
guided by historical events, unexpected crises and opportuni-
ties, and personal choices. New levels of mastery and auton-
omy allow individuals to make decisions and choices about the 
kinds of environments in which they participate. In addition, 
the autonomy of adult life allows individuals to express their 
genetic predispositions to a greater degree than when their par-
ents, teachers, and other authority fi gures were creating their 
environments, and constraining their choices. The bidirectional 
nature of development is increasingly obvious in adulthood as 
interests, beliefs, and goals guide the direction and focus of 
actions, and these actions and their consequences in turn cre-
ate the context for the revision of interests, beliefs, and goals. 
In the following sections, we review the concepts of social 
roles, the life course, and personal fulfi llment, ideas that help 
explain the psychosocial dynamics of adulthood.

identifi cation with a specifi c worker role and fi nd the transi-
tion into retirement psychologically easier.
Roles are reciprocal, requiring complementary role identi-
ties—such as teacher-student, mother-child—in order to be 
enacted and sustained. Thus, participation in multiple roles 
brings with it a form of social integration and social support 
Social Roles
Social role is one of the concepts most frequently used for 
understanding adulthood. The major concepts of social role 
theory, which were introduced in Chapter 2, are summarized 
in Table 11.1. We consider this concept numerous times in 
the analysis of childhood and adolescent life stages, includ-
ing Chapter 7 (Early School Age) when we discuss gender 
role identifi cation, and again in Chapter 10 (Later Adoles-
cence) when we examine individual identity versus identity 
confusion. Clearly, many roles are learned and enacted during 
childhood. In adulthood, however, people assume multiple 
roles that expand their opportunities for self-expression and 
bring them into contact with new social demands. Adulthood 
can be seen as a series of increasingly differentiated and com-
plex roles that the individual plays for substantial lengths of 
time. The salient roles of adulthood, such as worker, spouse, 
friend, parent, teacher, mentor, volunteer, or community 
leader, give structure to adult identity and meaning to life.
Social roles link individuals to their social environments. 
The roles that an individual plays exist as socially shared 
patterns of expectations for behavior. All roles can be chara-
cterized by costs and benefi ts that accumulate over time. For 
example, by assuming the role of worker, one has access to 
the benefi ts associated with the role, such as social status, 
social support, or financial resources. One also becomes 
responsible for meeting the expectations of the role, such as 
working for a certain number of hours each week or com-
pleting one’s work to a certain standard of quality. Over one’s 
life, the costs and benefits of the roles accumulate, influ-
encing the ease or diffi culty with which new roles and role 
transitions can be managed (Jackson, 2004). For example, 
if a person’s worker role involves many short-term jobs with 
no retirement benefits, the transition to retirement may 
be more diffi cult fi nancially, but the person may have less

on individuals in the group, pushing them to assume a par-
ticular role at an expected age. Age norms may also suppress 
behaviors that are considered inappropriate for one’s age. 
Adults are aware of existing norms regarding the timing of 
certain behaviors and evaluate their own behaviors as being 
on time, too soon, or too late. Implied in the notion of the 
social clock are expectations about the sequencing of entry 
into new roles and age-related role transitions. For example, 
European-American adults in the United States tend to view 
an ideal sequence as work, marriage, and parenting, in that 
order. Research indicates that for women, following this 
sequence is associated with better mental health, including 
less depression and greater happiness in adulthood. Among 
African Americans, however, the sequence of work, parent-
ing, and then marriage is associated with less depression 
and greater happiness. This suggests that different social 
norms for role sequencing may be operating in the respec-
tive ethnic communities (Jackson, 2004). The social clock 
is constantly being reset as people confront the challenges, 
demands, and new structures of modern society. In contem-
porary society, with the lengthening of the life expectancy 
and the increasing vitality of older adults, there are fewer and 
fewer domains in which a person is considered too old to 
participate (Neugarten, 1990).
Figure 11.1 provides a view of the age-linked changes in 
occupational and family careers. The fi gure maps the conver-
gence of transitions across the occupational and family trajec-
tories, illustrating periods of potential harmony and confl ict 
between the demands in the two trajectories. The bottom line 
shows a model of transitions in a family career. The line above 
shows a model of transitions in an occupational career. Some-
times these transitions occur around the same time in life. For 
example, in Figure 11.1, marriage occurs during a period of 
job experimentation when a person may be changing jobs. 
This could create tension in the marriage if it results in eco-
nomic insecurity. Occupational experimentation might be cut 
short in order to establish fi nancial stability for the marriage. 
The confl icts that arise in coordinating these family and occu-
pational careers may contribute to the high divorce rate in 
the fi rst year following marriage. Looking at Figure 11.1, you 
could consider many other examples where the demands of 
the family and occupational careers infl uence each other.
In considering adult lives in contemporary society, one 
can see that this is only one possible map of the intercon-
nections between work and family in the course of a life. 
The occupational and family careers look quite different for 
the following people: a woman who extends her educational 
preparation to include a professional degree, works before 
marriage, and delays childbearing into her middle to late 
30s; a woman who remains single and dedicates her energy 
to excellence in a career; and a woman who marries right 
after high school, begins having children at 18, works during 
her childbearing years, and then retires at 55 to enjoy her 
grandchildren and her personal freedom.
The pattern of the life course is infl uenced by the histori-
cal era (Schaie & Elder, 2005). The life course of a person 
(Thoits, 1999; Wethington, Moen, Glasgow, & Pillemer, 
2000). Involvement in multiple roles allows adults to help 
socialize younger generations. Only in adulthood do indi-
viduals experience the behavioral requirements of many of 
their roles, which in turn provide a basis on which to social-
ize their children for the demands of adulthood (Kite, 1996).
The expectations associated with adult roles provide a frame 
of reference within which individuals make their own personal 
decisions. For example, a man may know what is expected 
of him in the worker role, but he may choose to ignore those 
expectations and strive for greater responsibilities, more power, 
or more autonomy. People can conform to role expectations, 
revise them, or reject them altogether. In addition to the ten-
sions produced by role confl icts and role strain, some of the 
stresses of adulthood result from the need to redefi ne certain 
role expectations in order to preserve an authentic sense of self.
Life Course
Life course refers to the integration and sequencing of 
phases of work and family life over time. Glen Elder (1985, 
1996; Elder & Shanahan, 2006), who has been a leader in 
the elaboration of the life course perspective, described the 
two central themes of trajectories and transitions. A trajec-
tory is the path of one’s life experiences in a specifi c domain, 
particularly work and family. The family trajectory might 
include marriage, parenthood, grandparenthood, and wid-
owhood. A transition is the beginning or ending of an event 
or role relationship. In the work trajectory, for example, tran-
sitions might be getting one’s fi rst job, being fi red, and going 
back to school for an advanced degree. Transitions are the 
events that make up a lifelong trajectory. A person’s work and 
family trajectories are embedded in a sociohistorical context. 
For example, for people born in the early 1920s, the events 
of World War II, occurring during their twenties, infl uenced 
their work and family formation. For many young men, the 
planned work trajectory was interrupted by military service, 
and many young women entered the labor market unex-
pectedly. At the close of the war, in the late 1940s and early 
1950s, many couples who had delayed parenting started 
their families, which gave rise to the baby boom generation.
The life course concept can be applied to the content 
of individual life histories as they are expressed in a social 
and historical time period. Each person’s life course can be 
thought of as a pattern of the adaptations to the confi gura-
tion of cultural expectations, resources, and barriers experi-
enced during a particular time period. One form of cultural 
expectations is what Bernice Neugarten and her colleagues 
(Neugarten, Moore, & Lowe, 1965) termed the social 
clock. This term refers to “age norms and age expectations 
[that] operate as prods and brakes upon behavior, in some 
instances hastening behavior and in some instances delay-
ing it” (p. 710). Neugarten and her associates suggested 
that social class groups tend to agree on the appropriate 
age for signifi cant life events, such as marriage, childrear-
ing, and retirement. This consensus exerts social pressure

who was born in 1900 and died in 1975, including the ages 
of completion of educational attainment, entry into the labor 
market, marriage, and retirement, would look quite different 
from that of a person born in 1930 and reaching age 75 in 
2005. The two people would have gone through the same 
chronological ages, but during different periods of history, 
with different opportunities, expectations, and challenges. 
The fi rst person would have been 30 at the time of the Great 
Depression. Her family could have been seriously infl uenced 
by loss of employment, diffi culty in fi nding work, and loss of 
savings for retirement. The second person would have been 
30 in 1960. Having served in the military during the Korean 
War, he would have been eligible for the GI Bill benefi ts to go 
to college, resulting in new occupational opportunities that 
contribute to occupational advancement during a booming 
economy (MacLean & Elder, 2007). There are many other 
possibilities of historical impact, but these examples illus-
trate how historical factors might affect the life course.
All the people who are roughly the same age during a 
particular historical period are referred to as a cohort. Dif-
ferences in medical advances, occupational opportunities, 
educational resources, and the number of people in the 
cohort are four factors that may affect the pattern of life 
events for cohort members. Moreover, major crises, such as 
war, famine, and political unrest, may alter a trajectory by 
introducing unanticipated transitions—for example, clos-
ing off certain activities, as when young men interrupt their 
education to go to war, or opening up new opportunities, as 
when women enter the labor market because many of the 
men are in the military (Elder, 1986; Elder, Caspi, & van 
Nguyen, 1986; Elder, Shanahan, & Clipp, 1997).
The study of the life course focuses not only on the 
sequencing of events but also on the psychological growth 
that occurs as adults strive to adjust to changing and some-
times confl icting role demands. At different ages, people bring 
a distinct perspective to these events. For example, a crisis 
such as widespread unemployment may have a direct impact 
on the work trajectory of an adult, and also on the family envi-
ronment or educational opportunities of a child. The person’s 
developmental level and the particular developmental tasks 
and psychosocial crises that are most salient at the time will 
determine how a specifi c event will infl uence the life course.
Fulfi llment Theories
As the norms and cultural expectations of modern life 
become more fl exible, there is renewed interest in personal 
fulfi llment and self-actualization as concepts that guide indi-
vidual choices and directions for growth. The humanistic or 
fulfi llment theorists emphasize the purposive, goal-oriented 
strivings that characterize adult life. People do not always act 
to reduce tension, achieve equilibrium, or avoid risk. Over 
the course of adult life, people seek out new challenges, 
impose new and diffi cult standards on their behavior, and

rather than denying or constantly disapproving of them. It 
means fostering acceptance and trust in relationships with 
others, so that people bring their most authentic selves into 
interactions. Self-acceptance is a product of the positive 
feelings that come from being direct and from the acceptance 
one receives from others.
In Rogers’ view, barriers to self-acceptance come largely 
from conditions that others place on their love or approval. If 
signifi cant others give approval based only on meeting certain 
conditions, then the person learns to modify his behavior so 
that it conforms to those conditions. However, these modifi -
cations are made at the price of self-acceptance. They lead a 
person into a pattern of inhibiting or rejecting new thoughts 
and relying more and more on the opinions of others. The 
greater the discrepancy between the authentic self as one 
perceives it and daily experience, the more one is likely to 
experience life as threatening and stressful. The greater the 
harmony between the authentic self and experience, the more 
likely one is to experience a sense of trust, freedom, and cre-
ativity in daily functioning. An implication of this theory is 
that well-being is a product of person-environment coadapta-
tion. In the search for self-acceptance, the person seeks social 
settings where her thoughts, beliefs, and actions are highly 
valued and where the social setting can be modifi ed to value 
and endorse the talents of those who participate in it.
Self-Actualization
According to Abraham Maslow’s theory, human beings are 
always in a state of striving (Maslow, 1968). Self-actualization 
is a powerful, growth-oriented motive that sits atop a pyramid 
of needs (see Figure 11.2). In Maslow’s view, the primary human 
motives concern physiological needs, such as hunger, thirst, 
and a need for sleep. The second level focuses on safety and 
security—the need to fi nd protection from dangers and threats. 
At this level, one might include security of employment, safety 
for oneself and one’s family, and concerns about one’s health 
and the health of one’s family. As those needs are satisfi ed and 
maintained at a relatively stable level, people direct their energy 
to satisfying needs for belongingness and love, including friend-
ship, intimate relationships, family and kinship ties, and desired 
group belonging. At the next level, one is motivated to enhance 
and protect self-esteem by building confidence in oneself, 
achieving valued goals and gaining the respect and admiration 
of others. Finally, if those needs can be met and sustained, the 
person directs energy to self- actualization, a motive that urges 
the person to make optimal use of his full potential, to become 
a fully effective, creative participant in daily life. The need for 
self-actualization, like White’s idea of competence, becomes a 
driving force, urging the person to seek new levels of insight 
and personal fulfi llment. People who are characterized as self-
actualized are described as authentic, having a reality-based ori-
entation about themselves and others. They are spontaneous, 
interested in solving problems, and accepting of others. They 
lack prejudice. These qualities result from a continuous force 
toward growth as the richness of a person’s human capacities 
are allowed to fl ourish (Maslow, 1943).
put themselves in unfamiliar situations in order to seek ful-
fi llment. In its recent transformation, the fulfi llment theories 
have become integrated into the fi eld of positive psychology, 
the scientifi c study of the strengths and virtues that enable 
individuals and communities to thrive (Seligman, Parks, & 
Steen, 2006).
Charlotte Buhler was one of the earliest and most continu-
ously productive of the humanistic or fulfi llment theorists. 
Her work emphasized the centrality of life goals and inten-
tionality through the life course (Buhler & Massarik, 1968). 
In her view, each person experiences life within a complex 
orientation to past, present, and future time. It is the hope for 
meeting future goals and for achieving a sense of fulfi llment 
that prompts psychological growth. Buhler saw the years of 
early and middle adulthood as a time of setting defi nite goals 
and striving to achieve them. Toward the end of middle adult-
hood, there is focused preoccupation with the assessment of 
goals and the analysis of successes and failures. This process 
ends with a sense of fulfi llment, partial fulfi llment, or despair.
The last phase of life is seen as a reaction to this assess-
ment. People may resign themselves to their successes and 
failures (as Erikson suggests in the concept of integrity). 
However, some people may be motivated to return to an ear-
lier phase of striving to achieve unfulfi lled goals or to undo 
past failures. Some people end their lives in a despondent 
state of unfulfi llment, concluding that their existence has not 
been meaningful (as we suggest in the concept of immortal-
ity versus extinction). Three concepts from fulfi llment the-
ory are especially relevant for understanding the directions 
of growth in adulthood: competence, self-acceptance, and 
self-actualization.
Competence
Robert White (1960, 1966) introduced the term competence 
motivation to explain behaviors that are motivated by a 
desire for new levels of mastery. People strive to increase 
their competence through repetition and practice of skills, 
by gaining new information, through education and train-
ing, and through feedback from earlier efforts at mastery. 
The competence motive can be seen in an infant’s efforts at 
self-feeding even when those efforts result in less food mak-
ing its way from dish to mouth. The competence motive 
can be seen in the determination of an adult to learn to ski 
despite the cold, the expense, and the sore muscles. It can be 
seen when retired persons enroll in adult education courses 
to expand their knowledge. Over the course of adulthood, 
competence is expanded through a deepening of interests, 
by pursuing information and experiences that contribute to 
what we often term expert knowledge.
Self-Acceptance
According to Carl Rogers’ theory of personality development, 
an essential component of continued growth is to experience 
and accept the authentic self (Rogers, 1959, 1961). This 
means achieving a sense of trust in one’s ideas and impulses 

 
Developmental Tasks | 435
The fulfi llment theories suggest that growth and matura-
tion in adulthood are characterized by successful encounters 
with life challenges that result in a sense of purpose, meaning, 
and mastery. Questions have been raised about the possible 
negative impact of prejudice and discrimination on the mental 
health and sense of personal self-worth of members of minor-
ity groups. A study of a national sample called “Midlife in the 
U.S.” examined this issue (Ryff, Keyes, & Hughes, 2003). 
 Psychological well-being was defi ned in terms of constructs 
basic to fulfi llment theory, including a sense of autonomy, envi-
ronmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with 
others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. The results showed 
that individuals who were members of minority groups, 
including African Americans and Hispanic Americans, had 
higher levels of well-being than comparable European Ameri-
can participants, even after perceived discrimination was taken 
into account. With regard to the sense of purpose of life, this 
advantage was especially noteworthy among the more highly 
educated participants, where the more highly educated Afri-
can Americans had a greater sense of purpose in life than the 
highly educated European American participants. The study 
found that perceived discrimination was negatively associated 
with psychological well-being for women but not for men. 
Thus, two processes seem to be at work simultaneously: (1) 
perceived discrimination undermines psychological well-being 
for women, and (2) minority status is associated with many 
indicators of psychological strength for both women and men.
In summary, the concepts of life roles, the life course, 
and fulfi llment theories extend an understanding of psycho-
logical development in adulthood. Childhood is over. One 
addresses life with great expectations and exhilaration. After

the initial excitement of the period subsides, one comes to 
realize that there is serious work to be done. Young adults 
engage in intense and meaningful relationships in mar-
riage or with intimate partners, friends, and coworkers. 
They attempt to cope with the complex challenges of daily 
life by balancing multiple roles. At the same time, they put 
into action the practices that express the values and beliefs 
to which they became committed at the close of later ado-
lescence. They establish and revise goals, setting new stan-
dards for competence and self-acceptance. Over the course 
of adulthood, people return periodically to reflect on the 
meaning of their life and the value of their accomplishments. 
The expanding period of later adulthood and very old age 
provides new opportunities to seek self-actualization and 
moments of joy through intense dedication to personal and 
interpersonal achievements.
Developmental Tasks
We have identified the period from ages 24 to 34 as early 
adulthood. For many, this is a time of continued uncertainty 
as people begin to make essential commitments to work, rela-
tionships, and ideologies that express the content of their per-
sonal identities. The nature of early adulthood has changed 
dramatically over the past 40 years, from a time when young 
people moved with some deliberate focus into roles that they 
expected would be stable and long-lasting, to a time of many 
more transitions and temporary commitments. Recall the fi g-
ure in Chapter 10 that compares the percentage of young peo-
ple who completed the transition to adulthood in 1960 to those 

436 | 
CHAPTER 11 Early  Adulthood  (24 to 34 years)
relationships. The establishment of a sense of intimacy with a 
marital partner or cohabiting adult requires movement toward 
a greater sharing of personal feelings, secrets, and ways of look-
ing at the world. In addition, one is often called upon to hear 
and respond to these same highly personal expressions from 
another person. Sometimes the demand is to listen; sometimes 
to listen and offer advice; sometimes to be understanding and 
helpful. Another set of behaviors that develop during this 
period involves establishing effective relationships in the world 
of work. Getting along with associates, responding to author-
ity fi gures, and having respectful relationships with clients or 
customers are the keys to success. For those who decide to be 
a parent, parenting is another type of relationship of consider-
able responsibility. Becoming a parent is a role that most peo-
ple are not terribly well prepared for, and as a result, there is a 
great deal of learning by doing. Becoming a parent means cre-
ating a new relationship that is distinct from any role in one’s 
past—blending the caregiver, planner, and disciplinarian in a 
balance that changes frequently as the child matures. These 
three key relationships—intimate partner, worker, and 
 parent—form the basic structure of the lifestyle that is enacted 
in early adulthood.
The pathway into adulthood is taking longer and is more 
diverse today than it was 40 years ago. Some young adults 
who did not go to college directly after high school, later 
enroll in college. Some later adolescents enter the military 
and return to civilian life to begin their early adulthood as 
veterans of war. The period of job experimentation is last-
ing longer today with many young adults making multiple 
job and career changes before settling into their career. The 
average age of entry into marriage is now the late twenties for 
women and the early thirties for men. A signifi cant percent-
age of early adults are in cohabiting relationships that do not 
end in marriage. Many marriages end in divorce. This means 
that for many, early adulthood is a time of multiple intimate 
relationships. Later age at marriage is associated with an older 
age for fi rst childbearing. All of these factors refl ect a lifestyle 
in early adulthood that is more fl uid and transitional than 
it has been in the past. At the same time, one must keep in 
mind the diversity of life stories. Some young adults assume 
signifi cant role responsibilities, autonomy from their family, 
and self-suffi ciency at relatively young ages. Others delay the 
typical commitments of adulthood well into their thirties.
Exploring Intimate Relationships
Objective 2. To analyze the process of forming 
intimate relationships, including readiness to form 
intimate relationships, initial attractions, mate selection, 
cohabitation, commitment to a long-term relationship, 
and the challenges one faces in adjusting to the early 
years of marriage.
The period of early adulthood is a time when men and 
women explore the possibility of forming relationships that 
who completed this transition in 2000. The fi ve criteria for the 
transition to adulthood as defi ned in this fi gure are: leaving 
home, fi nishing school, becoming fi nancially independent, 
getting married, and having a child. By 2000, only 31% of 
men and 46% of women had made this complete transition by 
the age of 30. It is certainly possible to feel like an adult even 
if one has not completed all of these behaviors. Yet, for most 
young people, they capture the essence of a cultural defi ni-
tion of adult status, and, as such, provide a framework for the 
psychological sense of maturity. In the 10 years from age 24 to 
34, most young adults are striving to enact the key life roles 
of worker, intimate partner, community member, and parent 
that will refl ect their ability to take responsibility for them-
selves, make important decisions about their lives, and begin 
to care for others (Arnett, 2000, 2004b, 2006).
By and large, the developmental tasks of this period 
have a lot to do with the person’s ability to form effective

completed. Thus, it makes sense to think that the capac-
ity for intimacy emerges alongside identity work (Adams 
& Archer, 1994). However, when faced with dilemmas in 
which needs for identity and intimacy confl ict, young men 
and women tend to give identity issues higher priority. The 
following example and others like it were presented to ado-
lescents to determine whether identity or intimacy would 
be the primary developmental issue guiding an important 
decision.

to this college is that it is a 6-hour driving distance from her 
boyfriend. She also has been accepted to a college  located 
within an hour away from her boyfriend, which has an av-
e rage English department. She is unsure of which one to 
choose. How much consideration should be given to each 
of the following issues in resolving this dilemma?
a. The quality of the program
b. The distance from her boyfriend
Why? (Lacombe & Gay, 1998, p. 801)
In this study, young people placed greater emphasis on 
the identity-oriented solutions, those that relate to the qual-
ity of the program and the importance of a high-quality 
education, rather than on the intimacy-oriented solutions. 
However, women were more likely than men to try to bal-
ance the two, seeking ways to meet identity and intimacy 
needs in the same solution (Lacombe & Gay, 1998).
In addition to identity achievement, school enrollment as 
well as educational and occupational attainments are linked 
to relationship commitment. Young adults who are still 
in school are less likely to make a seri  ous long-term com-
mitment to an intimate partner, either through marriage 
or through cohabitation, than those who have completed 
school (Thornton, Axinn, & Teachman, 1995). The combi-
nation of educational and occupational goals and cultural 
views about the value of marriage create community expec-
tations about the ideal age at marriage. The ideal age for mar-
riage is likely to be younger in a working-class community 
than in a middle-class community, because expectations for 
continued education are not as great (Teachman, Polonko, 
& Scanzoni, 1987). In contrast, young people who attend 
college tend to have a later timetable for marriage. Advanced 
education delays marriage more frequently for women than 
for men, perhaps because young women who have had 
more years of education have alternative means to secure 
economic resources (Qian & Preston, 1993). Nonetheless, 
college graduates are more likely to marry and less likely to 
intend to remain single than those who have never gradu-
ated from high school (Mahay & Lewin, 2007).
In addition to educational goals, readiness for a long-term 
intimate relationship may be determined by other aspects 
of one’s personal agenda, such as reaching a certain level of 
combine emotional closeness, shared interests, a shared 
vision of the future, and sexual intimacy. The nature of 
these relationships differs for various couples. Some young 
adults engage in a form of serial monogamy—a sequence 
of dyadic pairings with no commitment to marriage. Others 
fi nd a same-sex partner with whom they make a long-term 
commitment even though formal marriage is not possible 
because of laws restricting marriage to a man and a woman. 
Most young people become involved in romantic relation-
ships that involve both sexual and emotional intimacy. Many 
forms of intimate relationships in addition to marriage are 
established during early adulthood, including serious dat-
ing, cohabitation with or without the intention of marriage, 
and commitments between gay or lesbian couples.
Marriage is one context in which work on intimate social 
relationships takes place. In 2008, 86% of men and 99% of 
women had been married at least once by the ages of 45 to 
54. Among those between 65 and 74 years old in 2003, 96% 
of men and women had been married at least once (U.S. 
 Census Bureau, 2010). The main change in the marriage pat-
tern in the United States over the past 50 years is that more 
young adults postpone marriage until the end of their twen-
ties. The percentage of single, never-married women between 
the ages of 20 and 24 rose from 28% in 1960 to 79% in 
2008. The comparable increase for single men was from 53% 
in 1960 to 87% in 2010 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1976, 
2010). In the United States, it is now normative for men to 
be single throughout their twenties and for women to be sin-
gle in the fi rst half of their twenties.
Delaying the age at marriage is related to several other 
social trends, including having children at a later age, 
smaller projected family size, and, therefore, fewer years 
devoted to childrearing. Delaying age at marriage is also 
related to increased sexual exploration for single people. The 
1980s brought the uncoupling of sexual activity, marriage, 
and childbearing. Younger age at entry into sexual activity 
and increases in rates of affairs and cohabitation suggest that 
even though many young adults do not marry, they become 
involved in intimate relationships during their twenties.
Readiness to Form Intimate Relationships
What factors are important in determining a person’s readi-
ness for a long-term commitment? From a psychosocial per-
spective, one can hypothesize that work on personal identity 
must be far enough along so that the possibility of a deep, 
emotional involvement with another person will be regarded 
as exciting rather than frightening. In studies of college stu-
dents, a relationship has been found between identity status 
and the quality of intimacy. Students who had an achieved 
identity also reported the most genuine intimate relation-
ships. In contrast, those who were characterized as identity 
confused were the least intimate and the most isolated (Dyk 
& Adams, 1990; Montgomery, 2005).
Early and later adolescents are likely to be thinking 
about intimacy issues long before their work on identity is

cohabitation should be relatively brief, frequently transi-
tion into marriage, with few children born to cohabiting 
couples.
 3. Stage in the marriage process. Couples in this type of 
relationship may see some disadvantages to marrying 
immediately, but they do intend to marry. Childbearing 
in the context of this relationship is more common, be-
cause the partners expect to marry. The relationships are 
of longer duration than in type 2, more often involve 
childbearing, and end in transition to marriage.
 4. Alternative to being single. Couples want to postpone 
marriage and family formation, perhaps because they 
think they are too young to marry. These couples are 
more like single, dating couples than like married cou-
ples. These relationships should be relatively short in 
duration, end in separation, and few children are born 
in these relationships.
 5. Alternative to marriage. Couples view cohabiting as an 
alternative to marriage. These relationships are often es-
tablished in the context of cultural support for children 
born outside the bonds of marriage. These relationships 
are of long duration, less likely to transition into mar-
riage, and more likely to involve children.
 6. Indistinguishable from marriage. Because of the cultural 
acceptability of unmarried couples and institutional sup-
port for all parents, couples consider cohabitation versus 
marriage on pragmatic grounds. These relationships are 
not a conscious alternative to marriage based on attitudes 
or values. The relationships are likely to involve children, 
but they may be of shorter duration than in the alterna-
tive to marriage, if only because many of them do transi-
tion into marriage.
achievement in one’s career, completing military service, or 
earning a certain income. In each case, a person with this 
kind of ambition is less likely to seek a long-term partner or 
to be receptive to expressions of love from someone than he 
may be once the goal is achieved.
Cohabitation. In contemporary society, cohabitation has 
become a common expression of a committed relationship. 
In 2007 there were 6.2 million unmarried-couple house-
holds in the United States, not including people living in 
dormitories, group housing, or other institutions (U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau, 2010). As the number of cohabiting couples 
has increased so has the number of children growing up in 
the context of cohabiting relationships (Heuveline & Tim-
berlake, 2004; Timberlake & Heuveline, 2005). These two 
trends raise new questions about the nature and meaning of 
cohabitation. Is it an informal alternative to marriage, or is it 
more like singlehood, except that it involves a bond of con-
nection with a partner?
In a cross-national comparison of heterosexual cou-
ples, six types of cohabiting relationships were described 
that refl ect a couple’s decisions to live together, have chil-
dren, and stay together (Heuveline & Timberlake, 2004, pp. 
1216–1218):
 1. Marginal. Cohabiting is infrequent, its duration short, 
and few children are born within this relationship, be-
cause the cultural norms strongly discourage this kind of 
union.
 2. Prelude to marriage. In the face of high divorce rates, 
cohabiting may be viewed as a way for couples to test 
the relationship prior to marriage. The duration of 
Andy and Jennifer take a 
moment to celebrate their 
decision to move in together.

and a greater probability of divorce. These findings have 
been repeated for cohorts of couples who married between 
1964 and 1980 when cohabitation was less common, and 
those who married between 1981 and 1997 when cohabita-
tion became more frequent (Dush, Cohan, & Amato, 2003). 
The relationship was observed in a meta-analysis involving 
numerous studies of premarital cohabitation and marital sta-
bility (Jose, O’Leary, & Moyer, 2010). However, the relation-
ship of cohabitation and marital instability was not found 
for couples who married their cohabiting partner, suggesting 
that for these couples, the cohabiting experience was in fact 
a stage in the marriage process. More research is needed to 
understand why those who cohabit and then go on to marry 
someone else experience less marital satisfaction and greater 
marital instability.
Close Relationships between Partners of the Same 
Sex. Gay men and lesbians are a diverse group with respect 
to their interests, talents, educational backgrounds, family 
backgrounds, careers, and other important aspects of adult 
roles. In many respects, the same dynamics that infl uence 
the formation of close relationships among heterosexual cou-
ples apply to same-sex couples. Nonetheless, gay and lesbian 
couples face certain unique challenges that are not typically 
present for heterosexual couples: they often have to establish 
their relationship in a context of secrecy, they often experi-
ence disapproval from their family, and in many states they 
lack access to legal recognition of their union should they 
desire it (Kurdek, 2005; Herek, 2006).
One of the common themes in the literature on gay and 
lesbian couples is the impact on the relationship of com-
ing out to parents and other family members. In compari-
son to heterosexual couples, this is a specifi c challenge that 
may place strain on the relationship. In one study of 20 gay 
couples, all those who had come out to their parents had 
experienced ongoing disapproval from their own parents 
and their partners’ parents (LaSala, 2000). The following 
refl ections from the mother of a gay man suggest some of the 
strains that are likely to arise as gay couples disclose to fam-
ily members.
Annette E. Brenner remembers joking when her oldest son 
was 4 that she’d approve his marrying outside the family’s 
faith as long as he married a woman. When he came out to 
her and her husband at 17, one of her fi rst reactions was 
to try to negotiate him out of his gayness. She offered him 
a car, a house, if only he would wait and try marriage. He 
was at boarding school in Connecticut at the time, and she 
was convinced it was just a stage. She remembers think-
ing, “Sure, this week you’re a homosexual. Enjoy the ex-
periment, have fun. Next week you’ll be a Hare Krishna.” 
Then she became enraged. “What is this kid doing to me?” 
she’d ask herself. “What was he doing to his grandparents, 
his brother and sister?” (From “Born or Bred: The Origins 
of Homosexuality,” by D. Gelman, Newsweek, February 24, 
1992, pp. 46–53. © 1992 Newsweek, Inc. All rights re-
served. Reprinted by permission.)
The cross-national comparison was based on data from 
14 European countries plus Canada, New Zealand, and the 
United States. Cohabitation among never-married women 
is comparatively rare in Spain, Italy, and Poland (less than 
15%) and quite common in France, Finland, New Zea-
land, and Sweden (more than 60%). The median duration 
of cohabiting relationships is 3 years or longer in France, 
Sweden, and Canada; and comparatively short in the United 
States, where the median duration is 1.2 years. Across 11 
countries where there are substantial numbers of cohabiting 
relationships, 61% of these relationships end in marriage. 
In comparison, 64% of Canadian cohabitation relationships 
end in separation, as do 52% of cohabitation relationships in 
the United States.
Using the indicators of incidence of cohabitation, pro-
portion ending in marriage, and incidence of children born 
to mothers in a cohabiting relationship, the researchers 
tried to match countries with the six types of cohabitation 
most characteristic of their population. In Italy, Poland, and 
Spain, cohabitation was considered marginal. In Belgium, 
the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Switzerland, cohabitation 
was most likely a prelude to marriage. In Austria, Finland, 
Germany, Latvia, and Slovenia, cohabitation was a stage in 
the marriage process. In New Zealand and the United States, 
cohabitation was an alternative to being single. In Canada 
and France, cohabitation was an alternative to being mar-
ried. In Sweden, cohabitation was indistinguishable from 
being married. The authors warned, however, that these 
national patterns may not refl ect all the differences that are 
present within a culturally diverse society such as the United 
States (Heuveline & Timberlake, 2004). These comparisons 
do provide a frame of reference for interpreting the meaning 
of cohabitation in national contexts. They illustrate differ-
ences in cultural support for varying patterns of family for-
mation by highlighting the frequency, duration, and path of 
cohabiting relationships.
Consensual union without a civil or religious marriage 
has been practiced in Latin America for centuries and is 
regarded as a form of marital union. The practice is becom-
ing less common on the island of Puerto Rico itself, but it 
is regarded as legitimate among mainland Puerto Rican 
women. Women who had a child within such a relationship 
were more likely to describe it as informal marriage than as 
cohabitation. Women who had been married before were 
also more likely to describe their current relationship as 
informal marriage rather than cohabitation. It appears that 
consensual unions were perceived by women to be more like 
marriage than like singlehood. Long-term cohabiting couples 
are very similar to legally married couples with regard to the 
frequency of confl ict, perceptions of equity, and relationship 
satisfaction (Willetts, 2006).
Even though cohabitation has become increasingly com-
mon in the United States, there is a consistent fi nding of a 
negative relationship between cohabitation and marital qual-
ity and stability. Individuals who have cohabited in the past 
have more confl ict in their marriages, less marital happiness,

CHAPTER 11 Early  Adulthood  (24 to 34 years)
They had similar approaches to confl ict resolution, similar 
experiences with support from their social networks, and 
similar rates of dissolution or instability in their relation-
ships. The same variables predicted relationship dissolu-
tion for gay and lesbian couples. Lesbian couples were more 
alike than gay couples at the start of their relationship and 
scored higher on measures of liking their partners, trusting 
their partners, and perceiving equality in their relationship. 
Overall, lesbian couples had higher rates of relationship sat-
isfaction. This fi nding is puzzling given that lesbian and gay 
couples had the same degree of stability.
Lesbian relationships often emerge out of close, same-sex 
friendships. Lesbians are somewhat more likely to be able to 
establish long-term relationships than gay men. Most lesbi-
ans describe their relationships as stable, sexually exclusive, 
and extremely close. They also describe their relationships 
as closer and more fl exible than do gay men or heterosexual 
couples (Green et al., 1995). Greater levels of satisfaction in 
the relationship are associated with greater levels of equal-
ity and shared decision making. Equality in the relationship 
depends on equal resources and commitment to the relation-
ship (Eldridge & Gilbert, 1990). In comparison with hetero-
sexual wives, women in lesbian relationships are more likely 
to describe greater satisfaction in their sexual activity and 
greater dissatisfaction with inequalities in the relationship. 
These women place a strong value on companionship and on 
confi ding in one another, but they also expect to experience 
high levels of autonomy within their relationships.
Gay men are also interested in long-term relationships. 
However, they are less likely than lesbians to be sexually 
exclusive, and there is less consensus among them about 
Gay and lesbian couples may have to establish their rela-
tionship in a climate of secrecy and social stigma, especially 
fears about parental rejection. Gay and lesbian couples often 
perceive less social support from family members and seek out 
other members of the gay or lesbian community to validate 
and encourage their relationship (Kurdek, 2004). Even when 
they are in committed relationships, gay and lesbian young 
adults are likely to manage the negative impact of family rejec-
tion by keeping the nature of their homosexual relationship a 
secret from family members. Although this image management 
might seem to place a strain on intimate relationships, research 
shows no signifi cant relationship between the couples’ satisfac-
tion in their relationship and the extent to which they are out 
to family members (Green et al., 1995; LaSala, 2000).
Lesbian and gay relationships are similar in many respects 
and distinct in others. Lesbian and gay couples who are in a 
committed relationship tend to give great priority to main-
taining and enhancing their relationship for several reasons. 
First, they share the conflicts around coming out and the 
complications that this poses in family and work settings. 
This provides a common bond and a need to protect the 
relationship from detractors. Second, because of the nontra-
ditional nature of same-sex relationships, the partners have 
to invent many of the details of their relationship, thus mak-
ing it more salient and less scripted than heterosexual rela-
tionships. Finally, they face ongoing challenges, such as the 
complexities associated with the decision about whether and 
how to have children and how to ritualize their commitment 
to one another (Metz, Rosser, & Strapko, 1994).
In a comparison of gay and lesbian couples, the two types 
of couples were similar in many respects (Kurdek, 2003).

associated with decreased parental infl uence on one’s choice 
of marriage partner. With greater geographic mobility, young 
adults are more likely to make nontraditional partner choices, 
including interracial and same-sex unions (Rosenfeld & Kim, 
2005). However, in some ethnic groups, such as Asian Indi-
ans and Arab Americans, there is still a strong expectation 
that parents will guide the selection of a marriage partner. In 
other groups, such as the Mormons, the high value placed on 
sexual abstinence prior to marriage results in an earlier age at 
marriage than for other groups (DeGenova, 1997).
Phases in the Selection of a Partner
In the United States and other individualist cultures, most 
people believe that romantic love is the central reason for 
choosing a marriage partner. In societies with a more collec-
tivist orientation, however, love is not necessarily relevant to 
the selection of a partner. In these cultures, the choice may 
be made by family members, based on religious, fi nancial, or 
family background factors believed to contribute to a good 
match, not only for the person but also for the extended 
family system. In these cultural groups, the principle of 
endogamy, or marriage within one’s well-defi ned group, is 
encouraged. An Asian Indian college student of Muslim faith 
describes her orientation toward marriage:
A few years ago I fell in love with a Hindu guy, but after a 
while I realized I had to end the relationship. My mom, it 
would have broken her heart. I care too much about my 
family. People would look down on my parents if I married 
outside of our religion. . . . Muslims are good people. We 
are very focused. We have morals. I want to give my chil-
dren that sense of identity. So I’m comfortable waiting until 
I meet an acceptable Muslim man. (Belsky, 1997, p. 279)
Figure 11.3 provides a theoretical model including four 
phases of increasing involvement in the mate selection pro-
cess (Adams, 1986). At each phase, the relationship may be 
terminated if the key issues produce undesirable information 
or negative assessment of the partner. Also, the relationship 
may end if an alternative attraction becomes so strong that 
it reduces investment in the fi rst relationship. The alterna-
tive attraction may be another person, a job, school, or the 
desire to achieve a personal goal. In contrast, investment in 
the relationship may increase if no attractive or acceptable 
alternatives are available (Bui, Peplau, & Hill, 1996).
Phase I: Original Attraction. Phase I, original attrac-
tion, captures the early process of partner identification. 
Initial impressions are formed in the fi rst few seconds of an 
interaction. Many of these cues are captured through eye 
contact and a scan of a person’s face (Jones et al., 2010). 
For example, in an experimental study, women were shown 
pictures of men’s faces. These same men had been assessed 
as to whether they preferred pictures of adults or pictures 
of infants. Their testosterone levels were assessed using a 
saliva sample. Women were shown the photographs of these 
the importance of sexual exclusiveness (Deenen, Gijs, & van 
Naerssen, 1994; Kitzinger & Coyle, 1995). In comparison to 
lesbian relationships, gay men often fi nd partners in the con-
text of a more active, competitive social scene that involves 
multiple short-term relationships. In comparison to men in 
heterosexual couples, gay men are likely to be emotionally 
intimate. In the practical matters of household work, gay 
couples are more likely than heterosexual couples to divide 
tasks so that each partner does an equal number (Peplau & 
Beals, 2004). Gay couples report higher levels of closeness 
and fl exibility than do heterosexual couples. Moreover, the 
combination of fl exibility and closeness is strongly associated 
with couple satisfaction (Kurdek, 2006b).
Many of the same factors are associated with relationship 
quality across all types of couples: valuing security, perma-
nence, and closeness; expressiveness; perceived rewards for 
being in the relationship; trust in the partner; good problem-
solving and confl ict resolution skills; egalitarian decision mak-
ing; openness to the expression of differences; and perceived 
social support (Huston, 2000; Kurdek, 2006b). Factors that 
are likely to lead to the dissolution of a gay or lesbian couple 
are a lack of investment in the relationship, a decline in expres-
sions of positive affect and emotional support, an increase in 
confl icts, and an increased desire for personal autonomy. Inter-
dependence sustains the relationships, and power inequalities 
disrupt them. Given that the stabilizing forces such as support 
from family members, community recognition, and legal rights 
and privileges are often missing for gay and lesbian couples, it 
is remarkable that they are as stable as they are.
Readiness to Marry
What determines whether an intimate relationship will end in 
matrimony? A basic factor is the person’s underlying desire to 
marry. In the United States, most people hope to marry. In a 
national sample of individuals ages 18 to 89 in U.S. house-
holds, people who were single, heterosexual, and not in a 
steady romantic relationship were asked the following ques-
tion: If the right person came along, would you like to be mar-
ried? Over 3,000 respondents were categorized into fi ve age 
groups: 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, and 55–69. Answers 
were coded as yes or no. Overall, only 5% of respondents were 
single and had no desire to marry. This percentage was higher 
in the youngest age group (about 7%) and the oldest age 
group (about 10%), and lower in the three middle age groups 
(about 3% to 4%). In addition to age, having been divorced, 
having children, and not being employed were all associated 
with a lack of intention to marry (Mahay & Lewin, 2007).
In the United States, most individuals have a great deal of 
freedom to choose their time of marriage and their marriage 
partner. Cultural values of individualism and autonomy pro-
vide support and justifi cation for addressing personal goals 
prior to making a commitment to an intimate relationship. 
Although expectations that one will marry are strong, young 
adults have the freedom to follow their own timetables. The 
increased independence of young adults from their parents is

men and asked to rate them on four dimensions: likes chil-
dren, masculine, physically attractive, and kind. They were 
also asked to rate each man’s attractiveness as a short-term 
romantic partner and as a long-term partner in a committed 
relationship. Based on facial cues alone, women were able to 
differentiate the men who preferred the pictures of infants 
from those who preferred pictures of adults. From these 
photographs women also rated the men who had higher tes-
tosterone levels as more masculine. In their assessment of 
short- and long-term relationships, the photos that women 
rated as more masculine and physically attractive were the 
ones they rated most highly for a short-term relationship. 
The photos women rated as kind, likes children, and physi-
cally attractive were most highly rated for a long-term rela-
tionship; masculinity was no longer a salient feature for these 
ratings. This and other research support the view that for 
women, initial attraction can be based on facial cues, and 
that the importance of various cues depends on the kind of 
relationship the woman is seeking (Roney, Hanson, Durante, 
& Maestripieri, 2006).
The principle of homogamy suggests that people are 
attracted to others who share important areas of similarity. 
Three of the salient similarities that have been studied are 
race, religion, and educational level. In a study of three lev-
els of relationship commitment—sexually intimate partners, 
cohabiting couples, and married couples—the researchers 
found that at each level of relationship the couples showed 
high levels of similarity (Blackwell & Lichter, 2000, 2004). 
However, similarity extends beyond these basic demographic 
characteristics. For example, in a study of dating and mat-
ing preferences among college students, women preferred to 
date men who were similar to them in education and occu-
pational level, and preferred to marry someone who was also 
similar in religious values and desire for children (Knox, 
Zusman, & Nieves, 1997). Other studies show that couples 
are similar in their preferences for leisure, their political ori-
entation, and whether their parents had been divorced or not 
(Wolfi nger, 2003).
In a study of 12,000 Dutch couples, partners were found 
to be signifi cantly similar with regard to health indicators. 
Individuals whose partners were in poor health were sig-
nifi cantly more likely to report being in poor health them-
selves than individuals whose partners were in good health. 
Although there were patterns of accumulated health prob-
lems within households, the young couples who had been 
together only a short time were just as similar in their health 
as older couples who had been together for years. Thus, 
the researcher concluded that the similarity in health status 
was more a result of initial similarities than a product of the 
impact of shared circumstances over years of marriage (Mon-
den, 2007).
Partners are selected from among those who are avail-
able for interaction. Many of the choices one makes during 
adolescence and young adulthood—such as where to go to

$30,000 or more, roughly 20% of those in a committed rela-
tionship met in an online dating site (datingsites-reviews
.com, 2010).
In contrast to the principle of homogamy, which empha-
sizes the role of similarity in the attraction process, social 
evolutionary theory suggests that men and women differ 
in the features they emphasize in evaluating someone as a 
desirable partner. The evolutionary perspective highlights 
the reproductive potential and the reproductive investment 
of one’s partner. Reproductive potential refers to the physical, 
material, and social resources that a partner may be able to 
contribute to one’s fertility and childrearing. Reproductive 
investment refers to the willingness of a potential partner 
to commit these resources to one’s children. Men tend to 
emphasize the biological or physical resources of a potential 
partner, valuing youth and physical appearance in a part-
ner more than do women. Women tend to emphasize the 
social status and economic resources of a potential partner, 
valuing earning potential and job stability in a partner more 
than do men (Geary, Vigil, & Byrd-Craven, 2004). In a cross-
national study of heterosexual mate preferences in samples 
collected in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, 
and North and South America, David Buss (1994) found that 
men placed more emphasis on a partner’s youth and physi-
cal appearance, whereas women placed more emphasis on a 
partner’s fi nancial prospects, dependability, and industrious-
ness. In addition to physical appearance and social status, 
people who behave in an admirable, effective manner may 
be viewed as attractive or desirable. People seek others who 
will support their goals, who can be encouraging and posi-
tive, and who appear to be able to collaborate effectively in 
shared experiences (Sanders, 1997).
Phase II: Deeper Attraction. Phase I, original attraction, 
moves on to Phase II, deeper attraction, as the partners begin 
to disclose information about themselves, interact in ways 
that deepen the relationship, and discover areas of important 
similarity. In Phase II, the discovery of basic similarities and 
a feeling of rapport are central to continuing the relationship. 
Each person has key values and background characteristics 
that serve as a fi lter for assessing whether the other person 
is an eligible partner. Of course, eligibility is defi ned differ-
ently by different people. For some, any person who is con-
scious is eligible. Others have criteria that limit the choice 
of a marriage partner to someone of a certain age range, 
religion, race, educational background, and family history. 
For example, some adults would not consider marriage to 
someone who does not share their religious faith. For these 
people, only members of their own religious group are per-
ceived as eligible partners. Research conducted on religious 
homogamy finds a consistent relationship between the 
extent to which partners have similar religious beliefs and 
participate together in religious practices and their marital 
quality. However, over the past 20 years, this relationship has 
been weakening. Agreement about gender ideology, partner 
participation in the labor market, and agreement about the 
college, where to work, which activities and social functions 
to attend, and where to take a vacation—determine who one 
meets. People who occupy similar settings such as neigh-
borhoods, college environments, work settings, or religious 
institutions are likely to be similar in certain characteris-
tics that contribute to the observed homogamy in couples 
(Kalmijn & Flap, 2001).
Some early adults are in situations in which it is diffi cult 
to fi nd suitable mates. They might move to a new town for a 
job or return home after serving in the military. The problem 
they face is how they are going to meet people and begin the 
dating process. Online dating is one strategy; speed dating 
is another. When there are many alternatives, the process of 
selecting the small number of people to follow up with or 
pursue requires a strategy. Studies have shown that when a 
person is faced with a large number of alternatives, for exam-
ple, a speed dating experience in which one encounters over 
25 possible partners, people tend to focus their attention on 
certain key, readily assessable features such as age, weight, 
or height. In contrast, when there are fewer possible part-
ners, people tend to focus their selection efforts on two or 
three more complex, less obvious criteria such as occupa-
tion, educational background, or religious beliefs (Lenton & 
Francesconi, 2010).
Demographic realities infl uence the possibility of meet-
ing suitable partners. In each community, for each age group 
of women, the number of suitable, available partners may 
differ, depending on such characteristics as the educational 
level, employment opportunities, and racial composition of 
the men in that community. For example, declines in the 
marriage rates for African Americans appear to be closely 
linked to the decline in the availability of appropriate Afri-
can American male partners. Single, never-married African 
American women increased from 17% of the total female 
African American population 18 years old and older in 1970 
to 40% in 2008 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). This pattern is 
related in part to the high rates of mortality and imprison-
ment of African American men and in part to their economic 
marginality. The decline in employment opportunities in the 
manufacturing industries, where African American men had 
made earlier gains, coupled with increased crime and drug 
use in the urban communities, contribute to the decline in 
the number of marriageable African American men (Taylor, 
Chatters, Tucker, & Lewis, 1990; Raley, 1996).
Once two people meet, what factors support their con-
tinued involvement? One’s style of interaction—for exam-
ple, whether one is shy and withdrawn or expressive and 
outgoing—infl uences the number and kinds of interactions 
one has with others. In the most general sense, the choice of 
a partner depends on the network of interactions in which 
one is involved. Among the people one encounters, some 
attract attention and others do not. For many young adults, 
online dating has become a way to expand contacts and 
reach a wider network of potential partners (Merkle & Rich-
ardson, 2000; Habib, 2001). According to a survey paid for 
by Match.com, in a sample of over 2,500 people who earned

date interethnically. I see people of different ethnicities every 
day. I’m used to them” (male Latino American).
Phase III: Role Compatability and Barriers to Break 
Up. The relationship is likely to proceed from Phase II to 
Phase III if the partners extend the domains in which self-
disclosure occurs, including sexual needs, personal fears, 
and fantasies. With each new risk taken, the discovery 
of a positive, supportive reaction in the partner deepens 
the level of trust in the relationship. The discovery of role 
 compatibility and empathy begins to give the relationship a 
life of its own. Role compatibility is a sense that the two part-
ners approach a situation in ways that work well together. 
Whether it is a visit to a relative’s home, an offi ce party, a 
casual evening with friends, or running out of gas on the 
highway, the two people discover that they like the way each 
behaves and that their combined behavior is effective. Empa-
thy builds through these observations, enabling each partner 
to know how the other responds and how to anticipate the 
other’s needs.
One aspect of this new level of intimacy is the special 
way in which romantic partners interact with one another. 
In affectionate and playful exchanges, partners often use 
baby talk, a type of gentle, high-pitched register, in which 
balance of work and family roles have emerged as salient 
value positions that rival religious values in predicting mari-
tal quality and marital satisfaction (Myers, 2006).
Many individuals may not even be aware of their own 
criteria for the eligibility of potential partners. For exam-
ple, most men expect to marry women who are a few years 
younger than they are. Although they do not deliberately 
state this as a criterion for marriage, they simply do not 
interact with or feel drawn to a partner who is perceived as 
too old (Buunk et al., 2001).
Most people seek marriage partners who will understand 
them and provide a sense of emotional support. There are 
many dimensions along which two people may recognize 
similarities or differences. They may seem quite different 
on some dimensions, such as religion and social class, yet 
discover that they are quite similar on others, such as life 
goals and political ideology. For example, partners who have 
similar ideas about gender roles and how men and women 
ought to function in a marriage are likely to be drawn to 
one another. The more aware individuals are of the themes 
that are central to their own sense of personal identity, the 
better they can recognize the dimensions of similarity and 
difference in other people that will contribute to intimate 
relationships.
In addition to the preferences that individuals express 
about potential partners and the availability of those part-
ners in a particular community, third parties can play a role 
in the progression or termination of a relationship during 
Phase II (Kalmijn, 1998). Parent and family support can 
help enhance a partner’s attractiveness if family members are 
enthusiastic about the partner and encourage the relation-
ship. As the earlier example of the Muslim college student 
illustrated, parent and family reactions can also interfere 
with a deepening attraction if the potential partner meets 
with family disapproval.
Research on interethnic dating has identifi ed the role of 
social network diversity as a factor that contributes to the 
likelihood of college students dating across ethnic boundar-
ies (Clark-Ibanez & Felmlee, 2004). Students who had an 
ethnically diverse group of friends were signifi cantly more 
likely to have had one or more experiences with intereth-
nic dating relationships. Students of color and male students 
were more likely than White or female students to have had 
experiences of interethnic dating. Those students whose 
parents had a diverse group of friends were most likely to 
respond that they had experienced interethnic dating more 
than once or twice. In the open-ended responses, students 
were asked how easy or how difficult it might be to date 
someone of a different ethnic group. The majority mentioned 
social pressures and social networks in their responses. For 
most of the students, the social network exercised pressures 
against interethnic dating. As one Korean American student 
wrote, “My parents, just as most Korean parents that I have 
contact with, banish the idea of interracial dating.” However, 
those who say it would be easy to date across ethnic lines 
often mention the role of friends and associates: “It is easy to 
As role compatibility and empathy grow, the relationship takes 
on a new degree of intimacy and the couple begins to concep-
tualize a future together.

In addition to the growing sense of compatibility, barri-
ers to breaking up help consolidate the relationship. First, 
the partners have disclosed and taken risks with each other 
that they probably have not taken with others. Second, they 
have achieved comfortable feelings of predictability and 
empathy that make them more certain about each other 
than about possible alternative attractions. Third, they have 
been identifi ed by others in their social network, including 
family and friends, as a couple. Support from one’s social 
network provides a stabilizing force that may be especially 
important for couples in nontraditional relationships. Other 
barriers include procedures needed to end the relationship, 
such as moving to a new apartment or dividing up or selling 
features of words are altered and new vocabulary may be 
created. Partners may give one another affectionate nick-
names and create unique signals for communication. The 
establishment of this intimate communication system acts 
as another bond between the couple, creating a personal 
environment that is not shared with and often not even 
known to others (Bombar & Littig, 1996). At some point in 
Phase III, partners may begin to think that they are in love. 
They may even tell each other, “I love you.” As described 
in the following case study, this is more diffi cult for some 
couples than for others.

family scientists. One view, sometimes referred to as the 
communal norm, is that each person should pay close 
attention to the partner’s needs and act in ways that will sup-
port the partner’s welfare. In a communal relationship, each 
partner tries to meet the needs of the other within reason, 
without regard for or without keeping track of what has been 
received in return. Couples that are characterized as fl ex-
ibly supportive are likely to view their relationship as posi-
tive and satisfying. A second view, sometimes referred to as 
the exchange norm, is that each person expects to satisfy 
the needs of the partner and to have needs met in about the 
same amount. The exchange norm includes a sense of obli-
gation so that what one receives from the partner should be 
returned in similar value. Partners keep track of the ben-
efi ts given or received, so that there is a continuous sense 
of equity or balance in the relationship. Couples who per-
ceive that what is given is equal to what is received will view 
their relationship as positive and satisfying (Clark & Lamay, 
2010).
In a study of couples prior to their weddings and 2 years 
after they were married, most couples thought that the com-
munal norm was ideal and preferable to the exchange norm. 
Over time, the couples that relied more on the exchange 
norm were also less satisfi ed in their relationship. An inter-
esting fi nding in this study was that individuals who were 
characterized by an anxious or avoidant attachment became 
increasingly reliant on the exchange norm 2 years into their 
marriage as compared to individuals who were characterized 
by a secure attachment. Even though they viewed the com-
munal norm as ideal, those who had an anxious or avoidant 
attachment had diffi culty establishing a communal, mutu-
ally benefi cial supportive relationship. The communal norm 
depends more on trust and reciprocity as compared to the 
exchange norm that refl ects some doubt about the partner’s 
ability to care for and respond to one’s needs (Clark, Lemay, 
Graham, Pataki, & Finkel, 2010). People who have an inse-
cure attachment are likely to be mistrustful of the good 
intentions of their partner. As a result, they pay very close 
attention to the value of what they are receiving from their 
partner in relation to what they give to the partner. Unfor-
tunately, this preoccupation with a fair exchange seems to 
be associated with more marital confl ict and lower levels of 
marital happiness.
Once the choice has been made and the thrill of court-
ship has passed, the fi rst few years of a committed relation-
ship involve a process of mutual adaptation. They can be 
extremely diffi cult, particularly because the couple does not 
anticipate the strains. The partners may be quite distressed 
to find their home become riddled with the tensions that 
are a normal part of carving out a life together. In one study 
of 1,000 newlywed husbands and wives, the researchers 
found that problems appear for many couples in the fi rst few 
months of marriage. Results revealed that 8% of newlyweds 
scored in the distressed range on measures of marital satis-
faction and 14% scored in the distressed range on measures 
of marital adjustment after the fi rst few months of wedlock. 
off shared purchases, and the feelings of obligation that may 
have accompanied earlier expressions of love and sexual inti-
macy (Kurdek, 2006a). At this point, the costs of breaking 
up begin to be quite high, including loss of a confi dant, a 
companion, and disruption or even disapproval in their 
social network.
Phase IV: The Right One Relationship. Once the part-
ners enjoy role compatibility and empathy, they move on to 
Phase IV, the right one relationship. Two processes appear to 
unfold that contribute to the intensifi cation of this romantic 
attachment: the positivity bias and the similarity bias. The 
positivity bias refers to the tendency to view one’s roman-
tic partner in an overly positive light. This bias contributes 
to the perceiver’s belief that he has indeed found the abso-
lutely perfect partner. It also makes the partner feel valued 
and cherished (Rusbult, VanLange, Wildschut, Yovetich, & 
Verette, 2000). The similarity bias refers to the tendency 
to exaggerate perceptions of similarity between partners, 
thereby increasing feelings of closeness and being under-
stood (Kenny & Acitelli, 2001). Both the positivity bias and 
the similarity bias are associated with the perceiver’s satisfac-
tion in the romantic relationship, thereby reducing the likeli-
hood that an alternative attraction will deter the person from 
making a long-term commitment (Luo & Snider, 2009).
The right one relationship is characterized by both 
romantic love and friendship. The intensity of romantic 
love has been documented in studies that contrast roman-
tic love and friendship (Davis, 1985; Hatfi eld, 1988). Lovers 
describe their relationships as characterized by fascination, 
exclusiveness, and sexual desire: “I would go to bed thinking 
about what we would do together, dream about it, and wake 
up ready to be with him again” (Davis, 1985, p. 24). They 
also express more intense caring for their loved ones than for 
friends. This caring includes giving their utmost, even to the 
point of self-sacrifi ce. The intensity of these characteristics 
accounts for some of the specialness and unsettling euphoria 
associated with being in love. It may also explain the relative 
instability of love relationships. Intense emotion is diffi cult 
to sustain. In contrast, friendship or companionate relation-
ships refl ect a high level of disclosure and a sense of having 
shared many life experiences. This leads to a sense of truly 
knowing the person, experiencing mutual understanding, 
and being concerned about each other’s welfare.
Even with the help of this model, the fi nal step of commit-
ment to marriage is not easy to understand. In today’s soci-
ety, many young couples agree to live together and make a 
commitment to their partnership without marriage. The step 
from cohabitation to marriage is still not well understood.
Adjustment During the Early Years of 
Marriage
What are the defi ning characteristics of a high-quality rela-
tionship and how are they sustained during the early years 
of marriage? Two different theories have been advanced by

less likely to share time together in these ways. However, for 
both the American and Japanese couples, those who spent 
more leisure time together had higher levels of marital sat-
isfaction. The causal nature of this relationship is not fully 
understood. One might assume that happy couples choose 
to spend more time together, but it may also be that couples 
who have opportunities to spend more time together come 
to feel more positive about their marriage as a result.
Partners who have a high level of marital satisfaction 
report frequent, pleasurable interactions and a high degree 
of disclosure (Lippert & Prager, 2001). High levels of dis-
closure and disclosure reciprocity (i.e., you tell a person what 
you are thinking about, and that person tells you what she 
is thinking about) are associated with greater relationship 
satisfaction among marital partners (Finkenaure, Engles, 
Branje, & Meeus, 2004). Self-disclosure and partner dis-
closure both contribute to high levels of intimacy as well as 
relationship satisfaction. Perceptions of responsiveness from 
one’s spouse also contribute to daily feelings of intimacy. It 
is likely that the positive impact of self-disclosure and part-
ner disclosure in strengthening intimacy and satisfaction is 
accompanied by simultaneous increases in perceived part-
ner responsiveness (Laurenceau, Barrett, & Rovine, 2005). 
For both husbands and wives, the most problematic areas 
in the early months of marriage were balancing employment 
and marriage, and debt brought into marriage (Schramm, 
Marshall, Harris, & Lee, 2005). Furthermore, confirming 
the diffi culties of adjustment in the early years of marriage, 
data suggest that the probability of divorce is highest during 
the fi rst years of marriage, peaking between 2 and 4 years. 
Among marriages that end in divorce, the median time to 
separation is 6.6 years; the median time to divorce is about 8 
years (Kreider & Fields, 2002).
There are many additional sources of tension in a new 
marriage. If the partners do not have similar religious, edu-
cational, or social class backgrounds, they will have to com-
promise on many value decisions. Assuming a shared value 
orientation, certain lifestyle decisions can generate tension. 
The couple must establish a mutually satisfying sexual rela-
tionship. They must work out an agreement about spending 
and saving money. They must also respond to each other’s 
sleep patterns, food preferences, work patterns, and toilet 
habits. The couple may fi nd the demands of their parents 
and in-laws to be an additional source of confl ict. Often, it 
is the number of demands rather than any single one that 
makes the adjustment process so diffi cult.
As part of the adjustment to marriage, the partners must 
achieve a sense of psychological commitment to each other. 
The marriage ceremony is intended to make that commit-
ment public and binding. It is safe to say that most people 
probably do not fully accept the reality of their marriage 
vows until they have tested the relationship. There is a 
period of testing in every marriage, during which each part-
ner is likely to put strain on the relationship to see how 
strong it really is. The question of trust may be posed as, 
“Will you still love me even if I do . . . ?” or, “Am I still free to 
do what I did before we were married?” Every marriage rela-
tionship is different. The partners must discover the limits of 
their particular relationship, but both partners must feel that 
they still have some freedom within these limits. They must 
also believe that the limits are balanced by the love, respect, 
and support they gain in return. As each test is successfully 
passed, the partners grow closer. They trust each other more 
and become increasingly sensitive to each other’s feelings. 
Eventually, the tests diminish in number as the question 
of trust is resolved. In the study of newlyweds mentioned 
previously, the factors that worked to protect the marriages 
included respect, appreciation, commitment, mutual affec-
tion, and trust (Schramm et al., 2005).
Communication and Marital Adjustment. Intimacy 
and a high level of satisfaction require effective communica-
tion and the capacity to cope effectively with confl ict. Happy 
couples enjoy being together. They start out their marriages 
being very much in love, and they also view one another as 
responsive. They value the companionship aspects of their 
marriage, such as spending time together with friends or 
having dinner together (Kamo, 1993). In a comparison of 
American and Japanese couples, the latter were signifi cantly 
To sustain a marriage, the partners must be able to interact even 
during periods of confl ict. Withdrawal, rejection, and distancing 
are common reactions to confl ict. These strategies may be ef-
fective during a brief cooling-off period, but they do not replace 
direct communication for exploring or resolving differences.

importance of the issue. Congruence between the partners 
in how they think they and their partners are approaching 
the resolution of confl ict is signifi cantly related to marital 
satisfaction, whereas lack of congruence is significantly 
related to marital dissatisfaction and distress (Acitelli, Dou-
van, & Veroff, 1997).
In an analysis of effective problem solving among newly 
married couples, partners were asked to identify the areas 
where they had their most signifi cant disagreements (Tallman 
& Hsiao, 2004). The four most common issues were money, 
who does what around the house, communication, and time 
spent with the spouse (p. 177). The premise of the study was 
that couples who were able to resolve problems so that both 
partners were satisfi ed with the outcome would experience 
greater levels of marital satisfaction. Another assumption was 
that both trust in one another and cooperative approaches to 
problem solving were needed in order to come to mutually 
satisfying solutions. Over time, the couples who were able 
to use cooperative problem-solving strategies had greater 
marital satisfaction, which in turn contributed to improved 
cooperative behavior in subsequent problem-solving efforts. 
Moreover, those couples who exhibited cooperative, mutu-
ally respectful problem solving were able to maintain their 
relationship quality in the face of economic distress.
Communication Styles of Men and Women. A grow-
ing body of literature suggests that men and women com-
municate differently and have different perceptions of the 
process. This idea has mixed empirical support. In many 
ways, men and women are alike. For example, both perceive 
the value of affective or emotional skills in promoting and 
sustaining friendships and romantic relationships. They both 
expect close friends—and especially romantic partners—to 
have the ability to encourage, soothe, reassure, and validate 
one another (Burleson, Kunkel, Samter, & Werking, 1996). 
When faced with upsetting problems, both women and men 
are most likely to offer suggestions for how to solve the prob-
lem or to take some action, rather than simply empathize 
and identify with the person’s problem (Goldsmith & Dun, 
1997). When asked about their preferred mode or style of 
interaction as a couple, husbands and wives both prefer 
interactions that are contactful—that is, open to the other 
person’s point of view—and that also clearly express 
the speaker’s own position. They least prefer controlling 
interactions, in which one person expresses her point of 
view and does not take the other person’s point of view into 
consideration (Hawkins, Weisberg, & Ray, 1980). These sim-
ilarities suggest that men and women approach the process 
of establishing intimate relationships with many common 
skills and values.
A great deal of empirical research has demonstrated that 
couples’ communication in confl icts is associated with, and 
predictive of, marital satisfaction and stability (Weiss & Hey-
man, 1997; Noller & Feeney, 2002). One pattern of commu-
nication that has been documented in the marital interaction 
literature is the demand-withdraw pattern, in which one 
The sense of intimacy is a psychological process in its own 
right that involves sharing an open, tender relationship with 
another person. Emotional expressiveness, especially by hus-
bands, and a lack of ambivalence about expressing one’s feel-
ings are important elements in this communication process. 
In contrast, declines in affectionate and pleasurable interac-
tions, lack of intimacy, and increases in ambivalence about 
the union predict a high probability of divorce (Huston 
et al., 2001).
In contrast to factors such as self-disclosure, partner dis-
closure, and a sense of partner responsiveness, which predict 
marital satisfaction, negative interactions and conflict are 
associated with marital distress. Confl ict can be a product of 
the interaction of two well-developed identities, each with a 
distinct temperament, values, and goals. Confl ict can result 
from the simple day-to-day need to make decisions that the 
couple has never made before. It can be a refl ection of one 
or both partners’ personalities, a tendency toward irritability, 
mistrust, or an aggressive temperament. It can be a product 
of disillusionment, as one or both partners perceive that the 
relationship fails to meet critical expectations. Much of the 
research on marital distress points to differences in power 
between the partners, especially differences in the control of 
resources and ongoing disagreements about the allocation of 
resources as an underlying source of marital confl ict. What-
ever the source, marital stability and satisfaction are closely 
tied to how couples manage confl ict (Huston, Niehuis, & 
Smith, 2001).
Three dimensions of confl ict seem especially important 
in differentiating happy and distressed marital relationships. 
First, instances of negative communication—especially 
nonverbal negative expressions and hostile put-downs—are 
more frequent in distressed than in happy couples, even in 
the fi rst few years of married life.
Second, distressed couples show a pattern of coercive 
escalation—a style of interaction in which the probability 
that a negative remark will be followed by another negative 
remark increases as the chain of communication gets longer 
and longer (Gottman & Levenson, 1986). This pattern has 
been observed at the behavioral level by coding the verbal 
and nonverbal characteristics of an interaction and at the 
physiological level by monitoring heart rate, blood pres-
sure, and release of stress hormones during communication 
(Markman & Notarius, 1987; Schrof, 1994). As the commu-
nication becomes increasingly negative, the partners become 
so physiologically disorganized that they lose access to their 
more rational ego functions. Over repeated instances, they 
become sensitive to this physiological state, reaching it 
sooner. In comparison, happy couples become more effec-
tive in soothing each other and in fi nding ways of preventing 
confl icts.
Third, distressed couples have different perceptions of 
the approach that their partners are taking to resolve a con-
fl ict. For example, one partner may think that he is acting 
in a constructive way to fi nd a solution, but the other part-
ner may view the behavior as patronizing or minimizing the

things out so that everyone feels comfortable with the situ-
ation. In conflicts, these styles can become incompatible, 
especially if the woman is trying to reach consensus and 
the man withdraws. In general, women expect and desire 
a degree of closeness that is often not reciprocated. Men, 
on the other hand, are more likely to be satisfi ed with the 
degree of intimacy that they fi nd in marriage and have fewer 
expectations of or less desire for greater closeness (Dindia & 
Allen, 1992).
Adjustment in Dual-Earner Marriages. One of the 
greatest changes in U.S. families in the second half of the 
20th century was the increase in the number of married 
women who were employed. It is now normative for married 
women, including those with young children, to be in the 
labor market. The percentage of employed, married women 
whose husbands are present was 32% in 1960 and 61% in 
2008. The number of women with young children who work 
outside the home has also grown substantially. In 2005, 61% 
of married women with children under 6 years of age were 
in the labor force, compared with 39% in 1960 (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2010). Rather than drop out of the labor force and 
return to work after their children are grown, the majority of 
women now remain in the labor force throughout the early 
years of parenthood.
There is no question that the involvement of both hus-
band and wife in the labor market requires a departure from 
traditional family roles and a dialogue about the division 
of labor. Uncertainty about the expectations and behaviors 
of the spousal roles must be worked out between the part-
ners. Sometimes, this uncertainty helps to produce greater 
intimacy by generating interactions that lead to greater self-
disclosure by each partner. Personal preferences and habits 
must be examined if the partners are to arrive at an effec-
tive division of labor that is mutually satisfying. Sometimes, 
however, this process is threatening. The partners may not 
really be aware of their expectations of themselves or of the 
other person until they are married.
One analysis of the potential confl icts for dual-earner cou-
ples focused on the relative balance of power and demands 
for household labor for the two partners (Rosenfeld, 1992). 
In the traditional male-breadwinner, female-homemaker 
family model, the husband has more power as a result of his 
access to fi nancial resources and participates little in the low-
status household tasks. The wife, in contrast, has little power 
and carries the majority of responsibility for the household 
tasks. As women have entered the labor market, their access 
to fi nancial resources has increased. To the extent that their 
husbands also help in sharing the household tasks, women’s 
well-being and mental health improve.
For men, especially in families where there is a relatively 
high family income, as their wives’ income matches or sur-
passes their own and they have to take on a greater role in 
domestic tasks, their well-being declines and their mental 
health suffers. This is true primarily for men who have tra-
ditional views about the importance of men as breadwinners 
member (the demander) nags, criticizes, and makes demands 
of the other to change, while the partner (the withdrawer) 
avoids confrontation, becomes silent, and withdraws. In a 
review of numerous studies by different investigators, using 
a variety of methodologies and samples, the demand-with-
draw pattern has been found to be consistently associated 
with relationship dissatisfaction (Eldridge & Christensen, 
2002). Further, research has demonstrated that the demand-
withdraw pattern is associated with several central aspects 
of marriage, such as power differences and violence (Sagres-
tano, Heavey, & Christensen, 1999), differences in desire 
for closeness and independence, femininity and masculinity, 
gender roles, and division of labor (Eldridge & Christensen, 
2002). The demand-withdraw pattern occurs most often in 
distressed marriages. The pattern is also extremely resistant 
to change in these relationships (Eldridge et al., 2007).
Although both men and women can be in either role, 
research demonstrates that women are more often in the 
demanding role and men more often in the withdrawing role. 
These gender distinctions have been observed in a wide vari-
ety of samples, including dating couples, cohabiting couples, 
married couples, clinic couples seeking therapy, violent cou-
ples, and divorcing couples (Eldridge & Christensen, 2002). 
Findings from recent research by Eldridge and colleagues 
demonstrate that the demand-withdraw pattern increases 
with the length of the marriage. The gender disparity in roles 
seems to be associated with a specifi c element across prob-
lem discussions: The person who needs to change is the hus-
band. Because women are more often seeking change in the 
marriage (Kluwer, Heesink, & van de Vliert, 2000; Margolin, 
Talovic, & Weinstein, 1983), women are more often in the 
demanding role and men are more often in the withdraw-
ing role. When the discussion was centered on the husband 
changing, whether the change was desired by the wife (wife 
relationship problem discussion) or by the husband himself 
(husband personal problem discussion), there was a gender-
stereotyped difference in roles. If the discussion was about 
change in the wife, there was little or no gender disparity in 
roles (Eldridge et al., 2007). It is unclear whether the greater 
disparity is because husbands are more resistant to change 
than wives, because wives are more insistent on change than 
husbands, or both.
Some differences in the ways men and women approach 
communication have implications for the quality of an inti-
mate relationship. The socialization of both sexes in U.S. 
culture is still suffi ciently distinct to result in differences in 
expectations and competencies. For example, when faced 
with a problem, men are more likely to want to deny it or 
to spend time analyzing and defi ning it in comparison with 
women (Goldsmith & Dun, 1997). Similarly, men tend to 
value the skills of being a good conversationalist or story-
teller and being able to laugh and joke as well as to argue and 
defend a position somewhat more than do women ( Burleson 
et al., 1996). They tend to be more ambivalent than women 
about expressing emotions and withdraw to avoid escalating 
conflict. Women, on the other hand, tend to want to talk

on having a satisfying marriage than on any other domain of 
adult life, including work, friendships, hobbies, and com-
munity activities. Longitudinal studies of adults who either 
remained single or got married and remained married over a 
7-year period found that those who were married had higher 
levels of well-being and fewer mental health problems (Hor-
witz, White, & Howell-White, 1996; Williams, 2003). The 
research suggests that the benefi ts of being married for men-
tal health and life satisfaction accrue primarily in the con-
text of happy marriages, where the partners describe their 
relationship as one in which their spouse makes them feel 
valued and cared for (Williams, 2003).
Childbearing
Objective 3. To describe the factors associated with 
the decision to have children, the impact of childbearing 
on the intimate relationship, the developing parental 
relationship, and the contribution of childbearing to 
growth in adulthood.
One central commitment of early adulthood is parenthood. 
During early adulthood, the issue of reproduction is con-
fronted many times. Young adults make choices to delay 
parenting, have an abortion, have a child, wait before hav-
ing another child, or stop having children altogether. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 4 (The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal 
Development), many couples undergo diffi cult and expen-
sive procedures to conceive a child. Others who are unable to 
conceive decide to adopt children. Some adults become fos-
ter parents, whether or not they have children of their own. 
Even unplanned pregnancies are products of some kind of 
decision making—whether to have sexual relations knowing 
that pregnancy is possible, to avoid using effective means of 
birth control, to abort the pregnancy, or to carry the child to 
term (Lydon, Dunkel-Schetter, Cohan, & Pierce, 1996). In 
all of these decisions, many powerful themes are refl ected: 
one’s sense of fulfi lling a masculine or feminine life purpose 
by having children; one’s childhood socialization and identi-
fi cation with parental fi gures; religious beliefs about sexual-
ity, contraception, or abortion; and ideas about carrying on a 
family’s ancestry and traditions. Reproduction is the means 
by which the species perpetuates itself. As people refl ect on 
their lives, the birth of their children is commonly recalled 
as a life-story high point (McAdams & Bowman, 2001). 
Regardless of the decisions one reaches, this issue cannot 
help but heighten the sense that the decisions of adulthood 
make a difference.
Fertility Rate
The average number of births required for the natural 
replacement of a population is estimated at 2.1 births per 
adult woman. This number is calculated by assuming that 
for every adult woman in a population, a female child must 
(Brennan, Barnett, & Gareis, 2001). Men who feel demeaned 
or threatened by demands to participate in household labor 
are likely to experience depressive symptoms that are similar 
to the reactions that women have when they try to carry the 
full responsibility of household tasks while also participating 
in the labor market. Finding the balance of power and of 
household responsibilities that preserves mutual respect and 
support is a major challenge in the early years of the mar-
riage and has to be fi ne-tuned and renegotiated throughout 
the marriage.
Evidence from a variety of sources suggests that in con-
temporary U.S. society, there are a number of benefi ts for 
couples when husbands and wives have multiple roles that 
include marriage, career, and parenting (Barnett & Hyde, 
2001). Four benefi ts are summarized here:
 1. Involvement in multiple roles means that both partners 
are likely to be more fully integrated into meaningful so-
cial support systems.
 2. Participation of both partners in the labor force increases 
fi nancial resources and buffers the couple against fl uc-
tuations in each person’s job situation.
 3. Success in one role can buffer each person against nega-
tive experiences in other roles. For example, negative 
work experiences can be offset by marital happiness and 
the centrality of parenting.
 4. Involvement in similar roles provides husbands and 
wives with a shared frame of reference. Thus, partners 
are more likely to appreciate one another’s point of 
view and to empathize with each other’s struggles and 
accomplishments.
However, there are limits to the benefits of the dual-
earner arrangement. The advantages of the dual-earner, 
multiple-role lifestyle can be offset when one or both part-
ners experience role overload—for example, if the care of an 
ill parent is added to an already full basket of responsibili-
ties. The quality of the roles can undermine the benefi ts, as 
when a person is in a terrible job with inadequate wages and 
oppressive work conditions. Chronic stressors at home that 
create feelings of overload or lack of control can make the 
daily hassles of home or work life seem even worse. These 
ongoing stressors, which result in frequent but unpredictable 
demands, can cause psychological distress in the individual 
and disrupt relationship satisfaction (Serido, Almeida, & 
Wetherington, 2004). Multiple roles can be disruptive if a 
partner holds traditional gender role values that are in con-
fl ict with the enactment of multiple roles. Finally, couples 
may find that their actual work schedules do not fit well 
together, leaving too little time to be together or too little 
control over their nonwork life (Barnett, Brennan, & Gareis, 
1999).
Roughly 100 years of social science research has estab-
lished that satisfaction in the relationship of marriage con-
tributes signifi cantly to psychological well-being, including a 
greater sense of social integration and protection from other 
life stressors. For most adults, happiness in life depends more

and motherhood are among the most fulfi lling experiences 
of adulthood; roughly 60% of these students (both male and 
female) said they were likely to want to have children.
Although the majority of married couples intend to have 
children, the timing of their entry into parenthood varies. The 
age of entry into parenthood has been getting older, accompa-
nying an older age at marriage. Between 1980 and 2007, the 
birth rate for women ages 20 to 24 decreased (from 115/1,000 
to 106/1,000), and increased for women between the ages of 
30 and 34 (from 62/1,000 to 100/1,000; U.S. Census Bureau, 
2010). Both the social and biological clocks come into play 
in this decision. The social clock refers to expectations from 
family and friends that it is time to start a family. Children 
who grew up in large families where their own mothers began 
parenting at a young age may experience both social pressure 
and social support from their families to have children early 
(Barber, 2000). Couples who wait to begin their families may 
be pressured by parents who are eager to become grandpar-
ents or by friends who have already experienced the lifestyle 
changes that accompany the birth of their fi rst child.
In recent years, many couples have decided to postpone 
childbearing until after the fi rst years of their marriage. This 
decision is related to several other aspects of adult life and 
needs to be understood in the context of competing goals, 
including education, career aspirations, and a desire to expe-
rience the intimacy of the marriage. Couples who have a 
dual-earner marriage have to consider the effect of children 
on their family income. They may try to anticipate the best 
timing for childbearing in relation to job security or career 
advancement. Some couples set certain material goals for 
themselves as a prerequisite to having children. For example, 
they may decide to wait until they can buy a home, establish 
a certain amount of savings, or travel together before they 
have children. Given the high divorce rate, couples are likely 
to want to feel confident that their relationship is strong 
before deciding to have children.
Delayed entry into parenthood has typically been stud-
ied in relation to the characteristics of the woman. It has 
been found to be related to a woman’s level of education, her 
career commitment, and the family’s income.
Zine Magubane (age 32) and her husband, Patrick McCabe, 
married in June. She’s got a tenure-track university teaching 
job; he’s a sports agent who travels constantly. They want to 
wait at least a year before beginning a family “to get a little 
more stability,” says Magubane, whose mother delivered her 
at 36. Today she works hard to stay healthy, knowing she’ll 
be an older mom. (Kalb, 2001, p. 43)
In a study of the timing of entry into fatherhood, men 
who were characterized as late-entry fathers (30 years old or 
older) were more involved with their children and had more 
positive feelings about them than did the on-time or early 
fathers (Cooney, Pedersen, Indelicato, & Palkovitz, 1993). 
Older fathers may feel that they have less confl ict between 
their commitments to work and to family. They may feel that 
they have already demonstrated their ability to succeed in 
be born who will reach reproductive maturity and have chil-
dren. Because slightly more male than female children are 
born, and because not all children reach childbearing age, 
the estimate for a replacement reproductive rate is 2.1 chil-
dren (Bachu & O’Connell, 2001).
The fertility rate in the United States has fl uctuated from 
the late 1950s, when the rate was 3.5 births per woman, to 
a low of 1.8 in the 1970s. In 2007, the rate was 2.1, just at 
the replacement estimate. Fertility rates in the United States 
vary by race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. His-
panic women have the highest fertility rate; Asian or Pacifi c 
Islanders and American Indians have the lowest (Hamil-
ton, 2004; U.S. Census Bureau, 2007). Women who have 
graduated from high school have a higher fertility rate than 
women who graduated from college. Women who are not in 
the labor force have a higher fertility rate than those in the 
labor force. Women whose family income is below $25,000 
have a higher fertility rate than those above $25,000 (U.S. 
Census Bureau, 2010).
Decisions About Childbearing
In contemporary society, decisions about childbearing are 
made in the context of other personal and family goals and 
commitments. Factors such as religious beliefs, career aspira-
tions, ideals about family life, and social expectations in the 
family and culture all contribute to a couple’s commitment to 
bearing children and the timing of fi rst and subsequent preg-
nancies. Cultures differ in the norms and expectations they 
convey about the value of having children and the appropri-
ate timing and frequency of pregnancies (see the box entitled 
“The Reproductive Career of the Gusii”).
In a study of 4 decades of trends in attitudes toward 
marriage, divorce, cohabitation, and childbearing, Thorn-
ton and Young-DeMarco (2001) compared responses from 
men and women as well as adolescents from fi ve different 
national U.S. samples. Data were collected in the 1960s, 
1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, with the most recent data com-
ing from adolescents surveyed in 1997–1998. Over time, 
two themes emerged. First, in the 1980s and 1990s, people 
viewed childbearing within marriage as more of an option 
than an obligation. Over that time, respondents increas-
ingly disagreed with the idea that all married couples who 
can have children ought to have children. This concept was 
positively endorsed by 84% of mothers in 1962, but by only 
41% of mothers and 22% of their adult daughters in 1993. 
Similarly, in the 1980s and 1990s, the majority of people dis-
agreed with the idea that having children is the main reason 
for getting married, or that people who did not have children 
led meaningless lives.
In light of the changing sense of social obligation to have 
children, one might think that people would be less enthusi-
astic about the meaning of parenting and less likely to want 
to become parents, but this did not happen. The second 
trend was a steady endorsement of the value of parenting. 
The majority of high school seniors who were surveyed from 
the mid-1970s through the late 1990s agreed that fatherhood

CHAPTER 11 Early  Adulthood  (24 to 34 years)
ROBERT LEVINE (1980) described 
the patterns of adulthood among 
the Gusii, a tribe living in the Kisii 
highlands of western Kenya, about 
50 miles south of the equator. The 
Gusii lived in a well-protected, fertile 
area where they were able to expand 
their communities and grow their 
crops. LeVine characterized their 
adult life course as being composed 
of three interdependent spheres: 
reproductive, economic, and spiritual. 
His description of the reproductive 
career illustrates how personal and 
societal expectations infl uence the 
childbearing decisions of young adults.
The reproductive career seems to be 
the most salient for both sexes. Its 
goal is to become the ancestor of a 
maximally expanding genealogy. For 
women, this means to have children 
as frequently between marriage and 
menopause as is consistent with child 
health, which the Gusii believe to 
be every 2 years. A man who fails to 
impregnate his wife that often will be 
publicly accused by her of neglect. 
The woman must have at least one 
son to take care of her in her old age 
and whose wives work with her; to 
have nothing but daughters (who 
move away at marriage) is second 
only to barrenness as a disaster. If her 
husband dies, it is her right as well 
as her obligation to have a leviratic 
husband to impregnate her regularly 
so she will continue to bear children 
“for the dead man.” For men, the goal 
means not only maximizing his wife’s 
offspring but taking additional wives as 
he can afford them and so appending 
their reproductive careers to his. If a 
man has been a monogamist, he might 
take a younger second wife when his 
fi rst wife reaches menopause, for that 
would extend his reproductive career 
by a decade or more. The reproductive 
career as I see it, however, is not limited 
to the individual’s own procreation but 
includes that of his or her offspring. 
Grandchildren are as fervently desired 
as one’s own children and, not 
incidentally, play an essential role in 
the burial of the grandparents. (Levine, 
1980, p. 94)
The value placed on having children, 
the practice of child spacing, and the 
practice of extending the father’s 
reproductive career by adding a second, 
younger wife all contribute to the high 
fertility rate of the Gussi (LeVine et al., 
1996). However, current conditions 
threaten the reproductive career of the 
Gusii. The level of mortality for children 
under 5 years old is 122/1,000 births in 
the western region of Kenya. Kenya is 
among 16 countries in which the mortality 
rate for children under 5 was higher in 
2004 than it was in 1990. According to 
the Republic of Kenya Ministry of Health 
(2004), the following issues impact the 
survival of children under the age of 5:
• Decline in levels of immunization 
coverage against the six childhood 
diseases, a key indicator of use 
of child health services. Children 
ages 12 to 23 months receiving 
full vaccination against vaccine-
preventable diseases fell from 65% 
in 1998 to 60% in 2003. Children 
receiving no vaccination at all 
increased from 3% in 1998 to 6% in 
2003.
• Recurring incidences of hunger and 
the resultant child protein-energy 
malnutrition (PEM) among children. 
Although chronic undernutrition 
among children under age 5 
declined from 33% in 1998 to 30% 
in 2003, micronutrient defi ciencies 
still affect large numbers of children 
and women.
• Widespread incidences of malaria, 
diarrhea, and acute respiratory 
infections, which mainly impact 
children. These diseases currently 
contribute to about 50% of all 
reported morbidity and about 25% 
of all reported deaths.
• HIV/AIDS scourge and its related 
opportunistic infections—
increasing HIV infection rates 
among pregnant mothers.
• Lack of comprehensive obstetrics, 
neonatal care services, and 
emergency obstetrics in many 
hospitals, particularity in rural areas.
• Widespread poverty levels in the 
country, particularly in rural areas.
• Literacy levels and low mothers’ 
education levels in many parts of 
the country. Children of mothers 
with little or no education have had 
the largest risk of mortality.
• Delivery complications arising from 
many deliveries done outside health 
care facilities and not supervised by 
skilled health workers.
• Lack of access to Preventing 
Mother to Child Transmission 
(PMTCT) services to all HIV-positive 
mothers.
• Poor infant feeding and weaning 
practices.
• Inadequate access to sustainable 
clean water sources and sanitation 
facilities.
• Lack of access to health services 
in many parts of the country due 
mainly to their maldistribution.
• Insuffi cient resources (e.g., trained 
health workers, equipment, drugs).
These factors illustrate the 
potential disruptive forces of 
modernization on traditional cultural 
systems and practices.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. What are some differences in the 
orientation toward childbearing 
between the Gusii and young 
adults in the United States?
 2. What do you think is the impact 
of greater contact with the more 
industrialized, commercial world on 
the Gusii and their reproductive, 
economic, and spiritual spheres, 
including both values and behaviors?
 3. How might the goal of becoming 
an ancestor of an expanded 
genealogy affect women’s health 
and reproductive practices?
 4. How might taking a second, 
younger wife in order to continue 
a man’s reproductive career be 
perceived by his fi rst wife?
 5. The Gusii are the focus of a growing 
human rights protest. Can you fi nd 
out more about it? How does this 
infl uence your understanding of the 
reproductive goal of the Gusii and 
the status of women in this culture?

decisions about the timing for their childbearing. However, 
data from the National Survey of Family Growth indicate 
that slightly more than one third of all pregnancies are 
described by mothers as unintended. Moreover, among 
women who have had one unintended child, about one third 
have another unintended birth (Wildsmith, Guzzo, & Hay-
ford, 2010).
In addition to one’s intentions about childbearing, certain 
other experiences feed into fertility decisions. For example, 
some research fi nds that the characteristics of the fi rstborn 
child influence a couple’s decision about having another 
child. When the fi rstborn child has a sociable temperament, 
has relatively few behavioral problems, and shows a readi-
ness and eagerness for learning, families are more likely to 
be enthusiastic about having another child (Jokela, 2010). 
Sometimes the conditions leading up to pregnancy, such as 
sexual abuse, or unusually diffi cult experiences of pregnancy 
result in a reluctance to have additional children (Sperlich 
& Seng, 2008). Social policies, such as the one-child policy 
in China, or the welfare policy in the United States, which 
emphasizes labor force participation for mothers of young 
children, can have an impact on childbearing decisions.
Problems in Adjustment During Pregnancy 
and Childbearing
Although most women are healthy and happy about being 
pregnant, there is growing concern about how to treat mood 
disorders among women during pregnancy and after child-
birth. Numerous studies document the disruptive impact of 
maternal depression on the infant’s cognitive and emotional 
development and the associated mother-infant relation-
ship (Pearson et al., 2010). Some women are chronically 
depressed prior to pregnancy and are being treated with psy-
chotropic drugs. Other women become anxious or depressed 
during pregnancy. The challenge is whether to continue the 
use of these therapeutic drugs, weighing the risks of poten-
tial harm to the fetus and the risks of untreated or increased 
depressive symptoms for the pregnant woman (Cohen et al., 
2010). Approximately 13% of women experience mild to 
moderate depression in the fi rst 3 months following child-
birth (Bick & Howard, 2010). Many cases of depression go 
undiagnosed and untreated, resulting in maternal distress, 
negative affect, reduced sensitivity to the infant’s signals, and 
disengagement from the mothering role.
The Dual Roles of Intimate Partner and 
Parent
In contrast to the elation that usually accompanies the antici-
pation of and preparation for the newborn, the arrival of the 
fi rst child often brings a period of stress to the relationship 
(Newman, 2000). Belsky and Rovine (1990) found clear evi-
dence of individual differences in how couples adapted to 
the transition to parenthood. In their longitudinal study of 
128 families, they observed four patterns of change in the 
assessment of marital quality: (1) Some couples showed a

expanding to include love for their unborn child. How might the

pregnancy?

the breadwinner role and, therefore, can approach parent-
hood with more confidence and a greater sense of self-
effi cacy. Older fathers may have more emotional resources to 
bring to their marriage and their parenting relationship.
Decisions to postpone childbearing are also constrained 
by the biological clock. Despite the number of highly publi-
cized late pregnancies, the biological limits on age of child-
bearing are still signifi cant. After age 30, women’s fertility 
rates decline, and by age 40, miscarriages increase. Repro-
ductive technologies that involve fertilizing a woman’s own 
eggs decrease from 40% effectiveness for women in their late 
twenties to less than 10% for women in their forties. How-
ever, new ideas are being introduced that may push back 
these constraints, such as transferring the cell nucleus from 
an older woman’s egg, transplanting it into the cytoplasm of 
a younger woman’s egg, and implanting the new, improved 
egg into the older mother so that she can experience preg-
nancy and childbirth (Kalb, 2001).
The patterns discussed previously may lead one to 
believe that couples are making very deliberate and strategic

CHAPTER 11 Early  Adulthood  (24 to 34 years)
marriage changes to incorporate a baby and therefore may 
become less intimate.
For most couples, coping with the early months of 
 childrearing strengthens the bond between the partners. The 
partners begin to respect each other’s competence in caring 
for their child. They also begin to conceptualize their roles as 
parents and to view the increasing complexity of their family 
structure as a challenge rather than a burden. The new baby 
adds a degree of energy to the family through expressions of 
satisfaction, pleasure, and affection.
As the roles of mother and father are added to the adults’ 
repertoire of role relationships, adults face new challenges in 
balancing their work, intimate partner, and parent roles. A 
variety of factors infl uence adults’ ability to achieve a posi-
tive sense of role balance. Access to fi nancial resources helps 
couples enjoy leisure time, and purchase services that can 
reduce some degree of role strain. When partners are equally 
highly invested in their parental roles, they are more readily 
able to make the trade-offs and compromises that parenting 
requires, including modifying their leisure time to incorpo-
rate each other’s interests and the presence of their young 
child. In contrast, when partners have to work long hours, 
especially on the weekends, or try to pursue individual lei-
sure interests that do not include their partner or child, they 
may have more diffi culty achieving a comfortable sense of 
role balance (Marks, Huston, Johnson, & MacDermid, 2001; 
Claxton & Perry-Jenkins, 2008).
The daily demands of the child help the parents defi ne 
their own roles more realistically. Instead of wondering 
what parents should do, they are occupied with the actual 
demands of parenting. Through this experiential learning, 
young adults formulate their own definitions of parental 
roles. Assuming that the early experiences are successful and 
rapid decline in marital quality after the fi rst baby was born. 
(2) Others showed a slow, steady decline. (3) A third group 
showed no signifi cant change. (4) A fourth group showed 
slight increases in marital quality. These fi ndings caution us 
not to overgeneralize group trends to individual cases.
The quality of marital adjustment during the transition 
to parenthood is closely related to marital quality before 
the child was born (Heinicke, 1995). Couples who are in 
close, confi ding, satisfying marriages before their children 
are born tend to show higher levels of marital adjustment 3 
months after childbirth than do couples in confl ictual mar-
riages. However, many studies fi nd that couples experience 
increased conflict after the birth of their first child. If the 
relationship was negative and the partners had high levels of 
confl ict prior to the baby’s birth, these diffi culties are likely to 
increase (Crohan, 1996). In some couples, this confl ict esca-
lates to physical violence. An estimated 4% to 8% of preg-
nant women experience violence from their intimate partner 
during the pregnancy. The risks of intimate partner violence 
are greater in low-income households, especially in com-
munities where people feel trapped in a life of poverty and 
disorganization. A wide range of negative consequences are 
associated with this violence, including miscarriages, abor-
tions, injury or death to the pregnant woman, and continued 
abuse after the child is born (Li et al., 2010; Silverman et al., 
2010). Research suggests that several characteristics of the 
partner relationship, especially shared involvement of the 
partners in household tasks and commitment to the relation-
ship, reduce the likelihood of such violence.
In an attempt to clarify the effects of many factors on 
marital satisfaction during the transition to parenthood, 
researchers compared marital activities and evaluations 
of the marriage by parents and nonparents who had been 
married the same number of years (MacDermid, Huston, & 
McHale, 1990; Huston & Vangelisti, 1995). They found that 
over the fi rst 3 years of marriage, couples’ ratings of love and 
satisfaction declined somewhat. There were no differences 
in the magnitude of the decline for parents and nonparents. 
Having children did not account for a greater drop in love 
or satisfaction than appeared to occur as a result of adjust-
ing to marriage in general. This is an important observation 
that provides new insight into much of the earlier research 
on marital satisfaction and the transition to parenthood.
Having children did have an impact on marital companion-
ship. The percentage of leisure activities shared by the hus-
band and wife dropped sharply after the baby was born, but 
it declined only slightly for the couples without children. 
During the third year of marriage, parents had a greater 
number of shared activities per day than nonparents, but 
few when the child was not present. Figure 11.4 shows the 
number of minutes of joint leisure time per day without the 
child for two groups of parents in comparison with joint lei-
sure time for nonparents in the fi rst, second, and third years 
of marriage. After the birth of their child, couples have only 
about one third as many minutes together alone as they had 
when they were childless. The nature of companionship in

occur at younger ages, about 22% were births to unmarried 
women ages 25 to 29. The decision to have children outside 
of a marriage relationship at this age may be a result of recent 
divorce or widowhood, a decision reached in the context of 
a lesbian or a cohabiting relationship, or a decision to start 
a family without a partner. The website of Single Mothers by 
Choice (http://singlemothersbychoice.com) provides some 
insights into the motivations and resources of women who 
deliberately choose to have a child without a partner.
Adoption
Adoption is an alternative to childbearing for individuals who 
want to start a family or expand their family. Overall, adop-
tion is relatively rare today, with fewer than 1.5% of married 
women having ever adopted a child (Jones, 2008). Adop-
tion can occur between related family members, or between 
unrelated individuals. Roughly half of adoptions involve 
family members who adopt, for example, when adults with 
children remarry and their children are adopted by their 
new partner, when adults adopt the children of siblings who 
have died, or when grandparents adopt their grandchildren 
because the adult children are not able to parent. Infertil-
ity is the most common reason that adults adopt unrelated 
children. Other reasons that adults give for adoption include 
religious or philosophical convictions, for example, a belief 
that it is more responsible to care for otherwise parentless 
children than to reproduce, to prevent passing an inherit-
able diseases (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease), to avoid contributing 
to perceived overpopulation, and health concerns relating to 
pregnancy and childbirth.
Over the past 30 years, the context of adoption has 
changed in a variety of ways that has resulted in fewer chil-
dren available for adoption. The fertility rate in the United 
the parents are able to meet their child’s needs, they gradu-
ally achieve a new level of self-effi cacy in the parenting role, 
gaining new confi dence in their ability to provide a nurtur-
ing environment for their child.
The process of social attachment and its impact on the 
infant were discussed in Chapter 5 (Infancy). The theme 
of mutuality as the central process for the establishment 
of trust was stressed. Mutuality also has an impact on par-
ents. Infants actively engage their parents, evoke unique 
responses, and, through their differential behaviors, begin 
to shape parenting behaviors. Infants respond to their par-
ents with shrieks of delight, elaborate smiles, and the active 
pursuit of them. They are unrestrained in their loving. They 
mouth, bite, grab, laugh, smile, squeal, and coo in response 
to pleasure. Through their open demonstrations of affection, 
infants teach adults about the expression of love and increase 
their parents’ ability to demonstrate it. As parents and chil-
dren begin to engage in playful interactions, the capacity 
to establish and maintain reciprocal interactions expands. 
Children learn how to initiate a play sequence by bringing 
a toy or making a playful gesture. Parents then learn how to 
respond by complying to the request for play, sitting down 
on the fl oor, bringing out the box of favorite play materials, 
or tickling and tumbling. As children and parents experience 
mutual, congruent playful interactions, the bond of affection 
is strengthened and communication is enhanced (Lindsey, 
Mize, & Pettit, 1997).
Nonmarital Childbearing
In 2006, over 1.6 million babies were born to women in the 
United States who were not married. This represents 38.5% 
of all births to women ages 15 to 44 (U.S. Census Bureau, 
2010). Although the majority of births to unmarried women

CHAPTER 11 Early  Adulthood  (24 to 34 years)
The Decision Not to Have Children
Not all couples choose to have children. In 2006, 20% of 
women ages 40 to 44 were childless, twice as many as were 
childless 30 years ago (Dye, 2008). Fewer Hispanic women 
are childless than White non-Hispanic and Black women. 
Much like attitudes toward remaining single, attitudes 
toward a lifestyle in which a couple chooses not to have 
children are becoming more accepting. As discussed earlier, 
childbearing is increasingly viewed as a choice rather than 
an obligation. This shift is evidenced in part by a change in 
the sociological jargon from the term childless to the newer 
term voluntarily childfree. The decision not to have children 
is becoming increasingly common, not only in the United 
States but also in other industrialized nations, especially 
as women’s educational attainment and occupational com-
mitments reach new levels (Giles, Shaw, & Morgan, 2009). 
Nonetheless, resisting social expectations that married cou-
ples ought to bear children requires a high level of personal 
autonomy and less need for social support from a wide range 
of reference groups. It may also require a competing positive 
identity, such as commitment to one’s career goals, or a redef-
inition of gender roles to sustain and validate this decision. 
In comparison to women who have children, those who are 
voluntarily childfree have higher income, more work experi-
ence, and are less religious (Park, 2002; Abma & Martinez, 
2006).
The U.S. culture continues to be pronatalist, placing a high 
value on the meaning of parenthood in adult life. Women 
who are making childbearing decisions are often infl uenced 
by their own mothers’ religiosity and their childhood reli-
gious teachings (Pearce, 2002). In some ethnic and religious 
groups, having children is considered a sacred trust. For 
example, within the Mormon Church, children are highly 
valued. “Mormon doctrine states that children are the spirit 
sons and daughters of heavenly parents, and that God holds 
parents responsible for their stewardship in raising them in 
righteousness” (Lambert & Thomasson, 1997, p. 90).
Through a pronatalist lens, motherhood is viewed as the 
symbol of a woman’s ultimate identity, regardless of her other 
talents or accomplishments. Mary Blair-Loy (2001) describes 
a powerful family devotion schema among women—a view 
that the ideal mother should be committed full-time to her 
children and the well-being of her family. This view is con-
trasted to the work devotion schema, which suggests that an 
ideal employee should devote all time to the work setting. In 
comparison to people in many European countries, work-
ers in the United States work longer days, take less vacation, 
have no paid maternity leave, and have limited access to 
quality infant care. The tensions between pronatalist cultural 
values, the devotion to the work ideal, and the lack of poli-
cies that support parenting result in many women leaving 
the labor market during their childbearing years or reducing 
their labor participation to part-time employment (Williams 
& Cooper, 2004). From 1998 to 2004, the labor force par-
ticipation of women who had a child in the previous year 
dropped from 59% to 55%, reversing the trend of rising 
States has declined, and teen births, which were a source 
of many adoptive babies, has also declined. Social welfare 
practices have become increasingly focused on family pres-
ervation, emphasizing the importance of keeping children 
with their birth parents. International adoptions have also 
decreased. Countries including Vietnam, Guatemala, China, 
and Russia have taken steps to try to arrange for local adop-
tion rather than sending their children to the United States 
(Seabrook, 2010).
The adoption process can be implemented to support the 
best interest of children; however, it requires a clear under-
standing of the unique dynamics of this bond. Parents may 
experience some continued feelings of sadness as a result of 
not having a biologically linked child. This sadness or dis-
appointment might be conveyed to their adoptive child. 
Adopted children may also experience feelings of loss as they 
learn of the separation from the birth mother, or in the case 
of international adoption, as they begin to understand the 
separation from their cultural heritage (Grotevant, 2009). 
When children have been in foster care for 2 years or longer, 
the lack of continuity in the attachment process, and harsh 
or unstimulating conditions of care can have signifi cant neg-
ative consequences for children’s emotional and cognitive 
development. Adults who adopt older children need to be 
prepared to provide unique supportive parenting in order to 
compensate for their child’s early experiences of neglect. At 
present, the preparation and training for adoptive parents to 
help them address these concerns are not adequately devel-
oped (Palacios & Brodzinsky, 2010).
Open adoptions, which are becoming increasingly com-
mon, strive to preserve the sense of family origins and con-
nections so that children have a clearer picture of their 
developmental history as they mature. The success of this 
openness depends on the willingness of the birth mother to 
share information, and on the skill of the adoptive parents to 
incorporate this information into the narrative for the child 
about how their family was formed (Neil, 2009).

Work
Objective 4. To explore the concept of work as 
a stimulus for psychosocial development in early 
adulthood, with special focus on the technical skills, 
authority relations, demands and hazards, and 
interpersonal relations in the work environment.
Within the life course framework, the occupational career is 
a major trajectory in each person’s life story. In combination 
with intimate relationships and parenting, efforts to balance 
and coordinate work and family life produce some of the 
greatest challenges of adult life. Work is the primary means 
of accumulating fi nancial resources. It is the focus of atten-
tion for much of the waking day. One’s work determines in 
large part the activities, social relationships, challenges, satis-
factions, and hassles or frustrations of daily life. Finally, work 
is the context in which many adults express their personal 
identity and experience a sense of personal value and social 
status.
In Chapter 10 (Later Adolescence), we discussed the 
developmental task of career choice, emphasizing the link 
between career decision making and other aspects of indi-
vidual identity. Here we focus on adaptation to the world of 
work, where the demands of work present new challenges 
and opportunities for development.
The concept of work is complex. The following discus-
sion considers very general characteristics of work and their 
potential impact on one’s cognitive, social, and emotional 
development and on one’s sense of self in adulthood. This 
type of analysis is necessary because occupational roles in 
U.S. society are so varied. Each job role places the individual 
in a somewhat different psychosocial context, with a unique 
combination of expectations, resources, and strains.
The World of Work
To gain an appreciation for the variety of career paths and 
their associated impact on daily life, you may want to consult 
the Occupational Outlook Handbook, which has projections for 
jobs in hundreds of industries for the period 2008 to 2018 
(www.bls.gov/oco). For each career, the handbook provides 
information about: the training and education needed; earn-
ings; expected job prospects; what workers do on the job; 
and working conditions.
The case study of Jay Crowe, which was retrieved from 
www.wetfeet.com provides an excerpt from an interview 
with an elementary school social worker in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico. He describes what he does, what it takes to 
do well in his type of work, and how a person can get a job 
like the one he has. Then he describes his daily schedule.

tasks, and the rapid evolution and extinction of specifi c types 
of work brought on by new technologies.
In many fi elds, there are now a few huge global organiza-
tions and a large number of small innovative companies that 
do the exciting, creative work of the industry (Handy, 2001). 
Neither type, the huge global organizations nor the small, 
innovative companies, offers what used to be known as job 
security, but the work environment of these two kinds of set-
tings is likely to be vastly different. Because economic, tech-
nical, and social conditions are changing so rapidly, young 
adults face two related challenges as they navigate the world 
of work. First, they cannot expect that strategies or patterns 
that led to success in the past will necessarily lead to suc-
cess in the future. Second, they need to be more proactive 
in designing or inventing an occupational identity (Patton & 
McMahon, 2006; Handy, 2008).
The early phases of career decision making, presented in 
Tiedeman’s model in Chapter 10, focus on self-understand-
ing; career exploration; identifying a good match between 
personal interests, skills, and values, and particular careers; 
and learning as much as possible about the specific job 
opportunities in a career domain. However, because of the 
wide variety of possible occupational choices and associated 
work settings, one can make only limited progress in prepar-
ing to enact a specifi c occupational role during later adoles-
cence. Even though many employers consider educational 
attainment a selection criterion, they often use it more as 
an element in determining one’s eligibility for the job rather 
The nature of the workplace is changing rapidly. Many fac-
tors have introduced new levels of uncertainty into the pro-
cess of choosing a career, fi nding work, and staying employed. 
These factors include the transformation from agricultural 
to manufacturing to service and information industries, the 
increasingly global nature of business, the higher educational 
standards required for entry into many careers, the expecta-
tion that workers will be able to perform across a variety of

school and learn new skills in fi elds that have growth poten-
tial. Some colleges and universities have made a special effort 
to reach out to adult returning students to offer retraining to 
those whose jobs were lost as a result of the economic down-
turn. For example, Beverly Berndt was laid off from her job 
as a computer programmer for a cabinet hardware distribu-
tor. With help from the Trade Readjustment Act, she went 
back to school to earn her nursing degree. “I hate to say it, 
but getting laid off from Belwith was probably the best thing 
that ever happened to me—getting help from the state for 
tuition and books, and drawing unemployment—I couldn’t 
have done it without it” (Bauer, 2010).
Authority Relations. Each job role specifi es status and 
decision-making relationships among people. One aspect of 
job training is learning which people evaluate one’s work, 
the criteria they use, and the limits of one’s autonomy in the 
job. In today’s organizational environment, career ladders 
are less obvious, and the authority hierarchy may be diffi -
cult to identify. Young workers may be assigned to a number 
of projects with different leadership, they may be asked to 
take on signifi cant leadership roles early in their careers, and 
they may need to form interdependent, collaborative teams 
(Collin & Young, 2000). New workers must attend to both 
the authority structure and the people who occupy posi-
tions in it. They must also assess the channels for decision 
making and the ways in which they can infl uence decisions. 
With respect to the people who occupy positions of author-
ity, new workers must be able to deal with a variety of per-
sonalities in positions of higher and lower status. Having a 
good relationship with one’s supervisor is a key element in 
job satisfaction.
Roughly one third of American workers report that they 
experience some form of hostility from their supervisor at 
work in the form of being belittled, yelled at, or undermined. 
Typically, people in positions of authority are supposed to 
encourage and support those who work for them. However, 
when people in positions of power perceive threats to their 
competence or feel incompetent in a domain in which they 
are supposed to have authority, a likely reaction is to become 
aggressive. When bosses feel inadequate, they may lash out 
at those who are less powerful (Fast & Chen, 2009). Under 
these conditions, it may not be possible for a new worker 
to achieve a good working relationship with a boss who is 
defensive.
Demands and Hazards. Each job has unique occupa-
tional demands, including norms for self-preservation, pro-
ductivity, and availability. In some work settings, the worker 
comes into contact with clients, patients, or customers who 
are very stressed, anxious, rude, or aggressive. The worker 
has to manage the hostile outbursts or attacks in a profes-
sional way in order to avoid escalation, but exposure to this 
type of negative affect can be very distressing for the worker 
who is trying to carry out a job as effectively as possible. A 
than as a detailed assessment of whether one has the back-
ground and skills to perform it.
Most jobs require a period of training for the entry-level 
employee, which varies from a few weeks in the case of an 
assembly-line worker to 10 years in the case of a physi-
cian. This is the induction phase in Tiedeman’s model. Most 
people do not stay at their fi rst job. A national longitudinal 
study followed the work experiences of people who were 18 
years old in 1978 through their 32nd birthday. During this 
period, the average number of jobs they held was 10.3 (U.S. 
Census Bureau, 2010). This fi gure disguises a great deal of 
variability, with 30% having been at their current job 1 year 
or less, and 30% having been at their current job more than 
6 years (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004). These data suggest that 
job mobility is to be expected in early adulthood, and the 
formation of what has been called an attachment to one’s 
job takes most young adults a while to establish. Therefore, 
the training phase is not only about acquiring the specifi c 
knowledge and skills necessary to carry out the work, but 
also about developing the personal, interpersonal, and trans-
ferable skills that will be important as one moves around the 
labor market (Posner, 2001).
The training period involves a process of socialization 
of the new worker. During this time, the individual must 
evaluate the match between her personal characteristics 
and goals and four central components of the work situa-
tion: (1) technical skills, (2) authority relations, (3) unique 
demands and hazards, and (4) interpersonal relations with 
coworkers. These are the major arenas for new learning in 
early adulthood.
Technical Skills. Most jobs require a certain degree of tech-
nical expertise, which varies greatly from one occupation to 
another. The job training phase involves learning new skills. 
Over 33% of all workers participated in work-related educa-
tion and training, with the most hours of training reported 
by those with a college degree, performing professional and 
technical work (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Among those 
ages 25 to 44, 39% participated in work-related educational 
programs. In addition to specific training, over half of all 
workers are expected to use a computer at their work, with 
greater percentages in some fi elds than others (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2006). Thus, specifi c skill training and general tech-
nical competence are part of the job demands. The success of 
individuals in learning and applying new skills determines to 
some extent whether they will become attached to the occu-
pation. At the same time, the opportunity to learn new skills 
is part of what permits new workers to advance and seek 
new employment.
As a result of the recession of 2007–2008, a large num-
ber of workers were forced to seek new skills through job 
retraining in the wake of massive fi rings and downsizing. The 
Trade Readjustment Allowance is a government program for 
workers who were laid off as a result of shifting industry to 
Canada or Mexico and who enroll in new training programs. 
Workers have taken advantage of this program to return to

with being berated by a patient’s family members:
If you are working in an offi ce and someone comes in and 
they’re having words with you and maybe they’re rude and 
you can say, “Listen, you’ve gone too far and you need to 
leave,” whereas we have family members who come up to 
us and say, “How come you . . . ? How dare you . . . ?” And 
they can just be rude and say terrible things and we cannot, 
we really cannot, we really are not expected to, nor are we 
really allowed to answer back.” (Bullock & Morales Waugh, 
2004, p. 775)
Occupational hazards include a broad range of potential 
physical and psychological risks associated with the work-
place, including exposure to toxins, work-related injuries, 
and exposure to diseases, reproductive hazards, and working 
conditions that have negative psychological consequences, 
such as noise or shift work. The rate of work-related deaths 
and disabling injuries has decreased substantially since the 
1960s. Nonetheless, in 2007, there were 4,689 deaths and 
3.5 million disabling injuries among U.S. workers (U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau, 2010). Settings differ in the kinds of pressures or 
hazards they impose on workers. For example, mining is one 
of the most dangerous occupations. In a recent mine disaster, 
29 workers died. This disaster shocked Americans as they 
realize how many workers continue to face hazardous condi-
tions such as exposure to intense heat and humidity, expo-
sure to toxic minerals and gases, poor air quality, and long 
hours underground (Donoghue, 2004). Just as occupations 
vary in their risks, individuals differ in their vulnerability to 
occupational pressures and hazards, their willingness to risk 
certain potential dangers, and their evaluation of the pay-
off for enduring some degree of stress. The individual must 
ultimately decide whether the particular vulnerabilities are 
tolerable in light of the rewards.
Interpersonal Relationships with Coworkers. 
Although the potential for friendships in the work setting 
is usually not advertised as a central component of job sat-
isfaction, it is clearly a dominant feature in the decision to 
be committed to a particular work setting. The need for 
friends with whom one can share the anxieties of learn-
ing the new job provides a strong motive for seeking com-
radeship on the job. The presence of congenial coworkers 
who can relax together and share feelings of accomplish-
ment greatly enhances any work setting. In fact, the spirit 
of friendship on the job may compensate for many stress-
ful situational demands. A workplace that creates space for 
collaboration and social interaction is likely to promote 
friendship formation and foster a more positive interper-
sonal environment.
Some work settings stress competition among cowork-
ers; incentives are arranged to stimulate competition rather 
than cooperation. In such settings, new workers often must 
shoulder the strains of their new learning independently. 
Some settings create both competitive and cooperative 
norms by creating teams or production units that compete 
with one another for incentives. Under these arrangements 
intergroup relations tend to be more distrustful, whereas 
individual relations among team members tend to be more 
trusting and cooperative. The greater the commitment to the 
team’s goal, especially under conditions of supportive leader-
ship and encouragement for interdependence, the greater the 
team’s effectiveness and the participants’ sense of the team 
effort as a high-quality experience (Aubé & Rousseau, 2005).
Workplace bullying has become a growing concern for 
managers who recognize that bullying results in increased

sneakers, turkey parts, doorstops, and manhole covers. 
[Women] worked as waitresses or caregivers, in ‘basement 
jobs’ leading nowhere, in which they hit the ‘cellar ceiling’ 
and were vulnerable and powerless. In such jobs, a worker is 
expendable, can be easily replaced, receives the lowest pos-
sible wages, typically works part-time, receives no benefi ts, 
has no upward mobility, and has no job security” (Lott & 
Bullock, 2001, pp. 200–201).
Analyses of successful programs that try to prepare indi-
viduals and families for self-suffi ciency show that they typi-
cally emphasize some combination of basic education, job 
skills training, and adaptive work orientation with supports 
such as child care subsidies and medical benefi ts. Some pro-
grams put more time and resources into improving the con-
ditions of the jobs and fostering employee skills. Programs 
that combine work with career counseling, earnings supple-
ments, health insurance, and child care subsidies have the 
combined benefi ts of decreasing poverty rates in a commu-
nity, increasing long-term employment, and fostering chil-
dren’s well-being and school performance (Duncan, Huston, 
& Weisner, 2007).
Career Phases and Individual Development
In an attempt to synthesize career and individual develop-
ment, Kathy Kram (1985; Ragins & Kram, 2007) proposed 
a developmental model of career issues (see Table 11.2). In 
this model, careers are delineated in three phases—early 
career, middle career, and late career—which correspond 
roughly to the phases of career exploration, career establish-
ment and advancement, and career maintenance and disen-
gagement (Osipow, 1986; McAuliffe, 1997). In each phase, 
career development reflects concerns about self, including 
questions of competence and identity; concerns about career, 
including questions of occupational commitment, advance-
ment, and the quality of relationships in the work setting; 
and concerns about family, especially family role defi nition 
and possible confl icts between work and family life. Typi-
cal issues facing the person at each phase are suggested in 
Table 11.2.
Issues of greatest concern during the early career phase 
reflect the need to demonstrate competence and also to 
establish a satisfying lifestyle. Career development is never 
a completely rational process. As organizational loyalty gives 
way to a free agent orientation to career development, indi-
viduals have to take a more assertive, risk-taking approach 
to their career development. In this process, one confronts 
many myths and uncertainties about the meaning of work, 
worries about fi nancial self-suffi ciency, and confl icts between 
work and other spheres of life, especially intimate relations 
and family responsibilities. In a survey conducted by the 
American Psychological Association, men and women in 
four age groups were asked about various sources of stress in 
their lives (APA, 2010). Even though about two thirds of the 
sample reported feeling satisfi ed with their jobs, 41% said 
they typically feel tense or stressed out during the workday. 
illness and absences, as well as decreases in productivity 
(Meyers, 2006). Workers who have been bullied may be 
afraid or embarrassed to say anything about it. However, 
when interviewed about their experiences they describe 
the impact in powerful terms. “I feel that I have been 
maimed . . . I’ve been beaten, abused, broken, scared. . . . 
I feel like I have ‘kick me’ tattooed on my forehead” (Tracy, 
Lutgen-Sandvik, & Alberts, 2006). The presence of egotis-
tical, narcissistic, and aggressive coworkers can quickly dis-
rupt the interpersonal climate of the workplace, making it 
harder to solve problems or collaborate on new initiatives. 
People who are exposed to insults or bullying at work are 
likely to suffer feelings of exclusion and depression, which 
may result in lashing out against other coworkers, thereby 
adding to the hostile climate.
Poverty and Career Opportunities
A number of factors limit the range of occupational oppor-
tunities open to a person during the work search phase. 
Among the most obvious limiting factors are educational 
attainment, ability, and location. Discrimination on the basis 
of race and gender also continues to thwart the full participa-
tion of women and minorities in the workforce.
The recession that began in 2007–2008 has had a major 
impact on jobs, earnings, and unemployment. The unem-
ployment rate, which was about 5% throughout 2007 
increased to 9.9% in May 2010. In addition to the 15.3 mil-
lion who were out of work, others were cut back to part-
time, some had not searched for work in the past 4 weeks 
and were therefore not counted among the unemployed. As 
a result of these changes, the offi cial poverty rate increased 
from 12.5% in 2007 to 13.2% in 2008, an increase of 2.5 
million people. From December 2007 to February 2010, the 
number of people receiving food stamps increased by 44% 
(Davis, 2010).
These recent economic conditions have added to a soci-
etal context in which relatively few resources are allocated 
to support low-income families. In a comparison of 21 rich 
nations, the overall poverty rate for all persons ranged from 
a low of 5.4% in Finland to a high of 20.2% in Mexico. The 
United States was second highest on the list, after Mexico. 
This dubious honor can be explained by a combination of 
two factors: (1) The United States has the highest propor-
tion of workers in poorly paid jobs, and (2) the United States 
spends much less than most other countries on benefi ts that 
provide cash supplements, health, education, child care, or 
housing for low-wage workers (Smeeding, 2008).
A study of low-income, single mothers provides an exam-
ple of the dilemma facing low-wage workers. Edin and Lein 
(1997) found that cash from welfare, food stamps, and social 
security supplements covered only about three fi fths of the 
women’s expenses. Those in paid jobs were earning about 
$8 per hour and could not meet their expenses with these 
earnings. Jobs in the secondary labor market involve work-
ing in “factories producing cartons, lightbulbs, dog bones,

The younger workers, those in the age range 18 to 30, were 
most likely to report some lost productivity due to stress at 
work. Fears of the unknown—of taking on new responsi-
bilities, of discovering the limits to one’s abilities, and of dis-
appointing important people in one’s life—must all be faced 
and reframed if one is to achieve the adaptive fl exibility nec-
essary in today’s world of work.
Lifestyle
Objective 5. To examine the concept of lifestyle as the 
expression of individual identity, with consideration for 
the pace of life, balancing competing role demands, 
building a supportive social network, and adopting 
practices to promote health and fi tness.

CHAPTER 11 Early  Adulthood  (24 to 34 years)
structure of time, including when one goes to work and 
returns, what one feels energetic enough to do after work, 
how much time is free for leisure or vacations, and the 
amount of preparation required during nonworking hours to 
prepare for the next day. People who are trying to combine 
parenting with a long workday experience the greatest time 
bind. Schedule control, rather than reducing the number of 
hours of work, seems to be especially important for helping 
people maintain a sense of lifestyle balance (Tausig & Fen-
wick, 2001).
Activity level, or the pace of life, is infl uenced in part by 
one’s temperament, health, and fitness. This is a circular 
issue. Adults whose lives are very sedentary are likely to have 
lower levels of endurance and to feel the strain of daily exer-
tion. Those who are more active and who include physical 
activity in their lifestyle are likely to have more energy and to 
be able to handle the demands of an active life.
The pace of life is also influenced by the climate and 
community. In northern climates, for example, there may 
be fewer social events away from home during the winter, 
and life may therefore revolve primarily around the home. In 
spring and summer, neighborhood activities become a more 
important stimulus for social life as people emerge and renew 
their friendships. Rural communities often provide a calmer 
pace of life than urban communities. People often choose to 
live in rural or rural-like communities, even when they work 
in the city, to escape from the hectic pace of urban life.
Social Network
As a result of participation in multiple roles, most people 
expand their social network during early adulthood. They 
form friendships in the neighborhood and at work. In some 
work settings, coworkers help each other balance their work 
and family life by taking shifts for one another, covering spe-
cial family holidays, or carpooling to save expenses. Young 
adults may become involved in the social life of their reli-
gious community or civic associations. They may engage 
in community volunteer projects with friends and become 
more invested in the social needs of their neighborhood. 
If they have young children, the parents of other young 
children at the child care center or preschool may become 
important sources of social support. When options are pos-
sible, individuals often look for housing in neighborhoods 
where there are others in their same life stage and lifestyle 
orientation. For example, when couples with young children 
live in a community with other young families, they tend to 
rate the community more favorably than couples living in 
the community who do not have children (Swisher, Sweet, 
& Moen, 2004). The contribution of friendships to personal 
satisfaction and lifestyle differs widely during this time, with 
single adults and couples without children typically having 
more time for adult friendships than do parents.
The rapid and continuously expanding growth in the use 
of online social networking sites including Facebook, Twitter, 
and LinkedIn refl ects the important role of social networks 
Lifestyle is a social psychological construct that integrates 
personality characteristics, goals, convictions, and inner con-
fl icts with social opportunities and resources into an organiz-
ing pattern of actions and choices (Slavick, 1995; Lombardi, 
Melchior, Murphy, & Brinkerhoff, 1996). Simply put, a life-
style is the self in action (Richman, 2001). Central compo-
nents of the lifestyle include the tempo or pace of activities, 
the balance between work and leisure, the focus of time and 
energy in specifi c arenas, and the establishment of social rela-
tionships at varying degrees of intimacy. One’s lifestyle guides 
decisions about how to organize time and prioritize the use 
of resources. One can think of lifestyle as the fi rst translation 
of the values and commitments of individual identity into 
action through the devotion of time and energy to certain 
tasks and relationships and the development of domains of 
competence. In the United States, a strong cultural assump-
tion is that individuals are active agents who make choices 
(Savani et al., 2010). These choices refl ect one’s preferences 
and values. In early adulthood, the desire to create a life that 
is satisfying and meaningful is expressed through the system 
of choices and decisions one makes about work, leisure, liv-
ing arrangements, relationships, health, and fi tness. In gen-
eral, the more one perceives that there is freedom of choice 
about these decisions, the greater one’s sense of happiness 
and satisfaction with life (Inglehart, Foa, Peterson, & Welzel, 
2010).
Even though a person may experience considerable social 
pressure to build an identity around an occupational focus, 
the concept of lifestyle reinforces the idea that a person’s 
work or career is not the same as a meaningful life. Because 
career choices can have such an impact on other aspects of 
life, it is important to select a career that supports a life, not 
the other way around. The following discussion illustrates 
some ways in which the overlapping systems of early 
adulthood—intimate relationships, parenting, and career—
interact to organize characteristics of the lifestyle.
Pace of Life
Some counselors use the metaphor of a three-dimensional 
space to describe the lifestyle (Amundson, 2001). Length 
is the length of life, or where one is along a developmental 
continuum. For example, in early adulthood one is likely to 
view life as stretching out for many years into the future, as 
compared to middle adulthood when one is likely to think 
that one’s life is about half over. Width is the busyness of life, 
including multiple role demands and how much activity one 
tries to jam into each day. Depth is the sense of purpose and 
meaning in life and the experiences of satisfaction or fulfi ll-
ment that come with it. This three-dimensional confi guration 
changes over the course of life, both as a result of personal 
changes in goals or developmental needs and as a result of 
situational changes in demands or resources.
The pace of life, or the busyness of life, is shaped by 
work, family, personality, and environmental context. For 
most young adults, the work setting largely determines the

world of work is likely to provide the most rigorous test of 
commitment and the greatest pressures for productivity dur-
ing the early adult years. For example, researchers have doc-
umented the impact of daily workplace events and the way 
men and women behave when they come home at the end of 
the day. At the end of a negatively arousing and stressful day 
of work, women are more likely to be angry at home whereas 
men are more likely to be withdrawn (Schulz, Cowan, Pape 
Cowan, & Brennan, 2004). Pressure in the work setting may 
come from a number of sources such as unpleasant inter-
personal interactions, being bullied, increased pace and 
demands of work, feelings of incompetence, or frustration at 
being undervalued. The emotional spillover from these nega-
tive experiences competes directly with needs for intimacy 
and also with the time and energy needed for parenting. The 
lower the level of marital satisfaction, the more these work-
place stressors are likely to diminish the quality of partner 
interactions at home.
In an analysis of the role demands of dual-earner families, 
researchers identifi ed three distinct dual-earner lifestyles—
high status, low stress, and main-secondary—each with its 
own pattern of role relationships, costs, and benefi ts (Crouter 
& Manke, 1997; Crouter, 2006). In the high-status couples, 
both partners had high-prestige careers, earned compara-
tively high salaries, and were involved in their work. In these 
couples, the division of household work was more equal than 
in the other two types. They experienced the greatest amount 
of role overload, had lower levels of love and marital satisfac-
tion, and more marital confl ict than the other two groups.
in the lives of contemporary young adults. There are an 
estimated 700 million users worldwide of online social net-
working sites (ComScore, 2008). About 14% of the users on 
Facebook are ages 25 to 34 (Kiser, 2010). Similar percent-
ages are observed for Twitter and LinkedIn. These social net-
working sites have a variety of functions, including staying 
connected with the activities of friends and relatives, shar-
ing information and opinions about products or experiences, 
gaining recognition for accomplishments, and encouraging 
participation in upcoming events (Back et al., 2010; Boyd 
and Ellison, 2007). The online social networking sites func-
tion as mass communication vehicles powered by individual 
users who share their experiences and ideas with friends and 
associates. As these sites have grown, the possibility of mak-
ing personalized contact with a wide and diverse audience 
has changed the nature and meaning of social networks so 
that they are now potentially quite vast, fl uid, and include 
individuals who are not really known.
Competing Role Demands
A challenge that must be faced in early adulthood is the 
competition of role demands. One part of role learning 
involves a widening circle of competencies and relationships. 
Another part involves balancing the confl icting expectations 
of simultaneous role responsibilities. Adults struggle with 
the confl ict between the demands of the work setting and 
the demands of building an intimate relationship; with the 
tension between the desire to have children and the desire 
to achieve in the workplace. For both men and women, the

practices as the use of preventive health services, regular 
exercise, eating a well-balanced diet high in fruits and vege-
tables and low in fat, avoiding smoking, limiting the number 
of sexual partners, and using contraceptives.
An aspect of lifestyle that is often overlooked is the daily 
pattern of sleep and waking hours. A growing concern 
focuses on the large number of people who do not get the 
nightly sleep they require. This can lead to serious health 
problems, defi cits in performance and alertness, increased 
risk of motor vehicle accidents, and impaired memory and 
cognitive functioning. In addition to problems with dis-
rupted sleep or inadequate sleep, shifting one’s bedtime by 
more than 2 hours can cause difficulties in falling asleep, 
staying asleep, or waking up on time and feeling restored by 
sleep (Vital Signs, 2010). Conditions of one’s lifestyle includ-
ing living arrangements, the time one has to be at work or 
return from work, the noise level of the neighborhood, and 
one’s involvement in leisure activities including television 
viewing, online social networking or gaming, and the use of 
drugs or alcohol, can all infl uence the amount and quality of 
one’s sleep.
The concept of encouraging young adults to adopt a life-
style that promotes health is becoming a focus for preventive 
health care. Much of this research suggests that lifestyle pat-
terns established in early and middle adulthood, including 
one’s diet, activity level, exercise, encounters with challeng-
ing and intellectually stimulating tasks, and reduced involve-
ment with cigarette smoking and alcohol, all infl uence health 
and vitality in later life.
Although the establishment of a healthy lifestyle can be 
viewed as an individual’s responsibility, healthy communi-
ties are shaped by adults who share a common vision about 
the lifestyle they want for themselves and their families. 
Although many aspects of fi tness can be achieved at the indi-
vidual or family level, some, such as environmental quality, 
access to health care, reduction of violence, or access to safe 
settings that promote physical activity require a community 
commitment. Adults may join together to create resources 
and programs that increase the involvement of children and 
adults in regular physical activity. They may form a coali-
tion of parents, health care professionals, educators, business 
leaders, and law enforcement agencies to devise a plan to 
decrease incidents of violence in their community. Commit-
ment to a healthy lifestyle may be enacted through efforts to 
improve air and water quality, reduce exposure to second-
hand smoke, improve availability and access to health care 
services and health education, or increase support for envi-
ronmental resources that sustain physical activity. For exam-
ple, a benchmark report on walking and biking provides 
information about patterns of biking and walking in the 50 
states, infrastructure that supports safe biking and walking, 
the relationship of biking and walking to health and well-
being, and funding for projects that improve opportunities 
and resources for walking and biking (Steele, 2010). Figures 
11.5 and 11.6 provide international comparisons for the per-
centage of individual trips that are carried out by walking 
The low-stress couples worked about the same amount 
of hours as the high-status couples, but their jobs were in 
less prestigious categories. Examples were a mechanic and a 
secretary, and a salesman and a substitute teacher. Although 
the couples had levels of involvement similar to the high-
status group, they had the lowest amount of role overload. 
This group had the highest scores in marital satisfaction and 
love for their spouse, and the lowest scores in marital con-
fl ict. These couples monitored their children more closely 
and seemed to be more accurate in describing their children’s 
daily activities.
The main-secondary couples refl ected a lifestyle in which 
husbands were the primary workers, with higher occu-
pational prestige, more hours worked, and more work 
involvement than their wives, who typically worked part 
time. Women in these relationships had less education and 
tended to have more household responsibilities. A gender-
typed division of labor was refl ected in the pattern for female 
children, who performed more household tasks than girls in 
the other family types, whereas male children in these fami-
lies performed fewer household tasks than boys in the other 
family types.
The more involved one is in the competitive demands of 
work, the less likely one is to feel comfortable about spend-
ing time away from it. Conversely, the more engrossed one is 
in a variety of activities away from work, including hobbies 
and family events, the more time one will fi nd for leisure. 
In some occupations, the time schedule leaves little room 
for personal choice. In others, the income from a single job 
may not suffi ce to support the family. Time that might other-
wise be spent in leisure must be spent in earning additional 
income through extra work.
The balance of work and leisure is a result of one’s dispo-
sition toward them and the demands of the work setting. For 
some people, time with the family is more important than 
time at work. They highly value the time they have at home 
with their families and make it a priority when they choose a 
career. For other people, advancement in work through the 
expenditure of large amounts of time supersedes commit-
ments to home and leisure. For them, the lifestyles of part-
ners may evolve somewhat separately, because the amount of 
leisure time they share may be limited. Couples who are able 
to enjoy leisure activities together that provide opportuni-
ties for relaxed, open conversation fi nd that these contribute 
substantially to the strength of and satisfaction in their inti-
mate relationship (Kalmijn & Bernasco, 2001).
Health and Fitness
The contemporary emphasis on health and fi tness indicates 
the importance of lifestyle decisions for illness prevention 
and longevity. Research on health and health-related risks 
has begun to identify characteristics of a healthy lifestyle, 
including factors that operate at an individual level and 
those that refl ect community commitment (Healthy People, 
2000, 2010, 2020). Leading health indicators include such

or biking in Europe, North America, and Australia. As the 
data show, people in the United States are at the bottom with 
respect to the frequency with which they walk or bike to 
their destinations. The relationship of limited physical activ-
ity to signifi cant health concerns, especially obesity, diabe-
tes, and high blood pressure, is well documented. Efforts 
by communities to improve the infrastructure to support 
walking and bicycling can have important benefi ts for pub-
lic health, as well as improvements in pedestrian safety and 
reduced traffi c and air pollution.
Lifestyle is an umbrella concept for the variety of pat-
terns of activities, commitments, and satisfactions that make 
up adult experience. The cultural expectations and personal 
aspirations for establishing committed relationships, child-
bearing, and work are confronted, evaluated, and accepted 
or rejected during these early adult years. In the process of 
deciding about each of these life tasks, the person begins 
to crystallize a life pattern that refl ects personal vision of a 
meaningful path toward maturity.
The Psychosocial Crisis: 
Intimacy versus Isolation
Objective 6. To defi ne and describe the psychosocial 
crisis of intimacy versus isolation, the central process 
through which the crisis is resolved, mutuality among 
peers, the prime adaptive ego quality of love, and the

CHAPTER 11 Early  Adulthood  (24 to 34 years)
Here in San Francisco, healthy 
and environmentally con-
scious young adults ride to 
work, school, and recreational 
activities in their own traffi c 
lane. The fact that the city has 
provided a separate lane of 
traffi c for bicyclists encourages 
residents to adopt this active 
lifestyle choice.
We have seen the importance of a sense of belonging in every 
stage of the lifespan, including a sense of belonging to one’s 
family, belonging in a friendship group, belonging and feel-
ings of inclusion at school, belonging in one’s community, 
belonging to one’s religious or ethnic group, and belonging 
to the variety of groups that are especially important in the 
high school and college years. Accompanying these feelings 
of belonging, a sense of mattering emerges that helps a per-
son experience the psychological and physiological benefi ts 
of social support. In early adulthood a special and funda-
mental sense of belonging surfaces when two people disclose 
the most important characteristics of their being with each 
other. Within this intense dyadic context, the partners expe-
rience the openness to communicate their innermost feelings 
and are rewarded with the responsiveness and excitement 
with which the other person accepts these gifts of trust. 
What comes to life are special feelings of tenderness and 
devotion for another person, and feelings of being cherished 
and treasured by the other person. In contrast, some people 
are unable to engage in the trusting, open, mutually respon-
sive relationships implied by intimacy. They may experience 
rejection, exclusion, or an inability to accept the affection of 
others, resulting in a sense of isolation.
Intimacy
Intimacy is defi ned as the ability to experience an open, sup-
portive, tender relationship with another person without fear of 
losing one’s own identity in the process. An intimate relation-
ship has both cognitive and affective components. The partners 
are able to understand each other’s point of view. They usu-
ally experience a sense of confi dence and mutual regard that 
refl ects their respect as well as their affection for each other. 
Intimacy in a relationship supports independent judgments by 
each partner. It also permits the disclosure of personal feelings, 
as well as the sharing and developing of ideas and plans.
There is a sense of mutual enrichment in intimate inter-
actions. Each person perceives enhancement of well-being 
through affectionate or intellectually stimulating interactions 
with the other (Erikson, 1963, 1980). Coming as it does 
after the establishment of personal identity, the possibility of 
establishing intimacy depends on individuals’ perceptions of 
themselves as valuable, competent, and meaningful people. 
In an intimate relationship, the partners are aware of one 
another’s aspirations. Under the best of circumstances, in a 
truly intimate relationship the partners interact in such a way 
as to promote one another’s self-fulfi llment, reassuring their 
partner about the possibility of achieving their most impor-
tant goals and encouraging their self-actualization (Rusbult, 
Finkel, & Kumashiro, 2009).
It is not diffi cult to understand that a person would be 
on intimate terms with parents and siblings. The family is a 
central context for sharing confi dences, expressing love, and 
revealing weaknesses and areas of dependence. In fact, there 
is growing evidence that the nature of one’s parental attach-
ment orientation infl uences the ability to form new intimate 
relationships (see the box on attachment styles and relation-
ship formation). The unique task of young adulthood is to 
establish an intimate relationship with someone outside of 
one’s family. Two people who eventually establish intimacy 
may begin as complete strangers who have very few, if any, 
common cultural bonds. Although an extreme degree of dif-
ference is unusual, it represents the greatest challenge that 
may confront two people.
Whether they are established in the context of mar-
riage, friendship, or work, intimate relationships are often

the establishment of intimacy among coworkers. Problems 
with sex discrimination and sexual harassment at work are 
evidence that many men and women have not developed 
mature strategies for forming mutually respectful, close rela-
tionships with adults of the opposite sex. Often, men and 
women fi nd it diffi cult to establish an egalitarian relation-
ship at work. They have a hard time engaging in the kinds 
of informal interactions that bring a sense of closeness to 
same-sex coworkers, like going to lunch together, stopping 
for a drink at the end of the day, or going to the gym to work 
out. Many men fi nd it diffi cult to establish a style of interac-
tion with women that is forthright but not sexual in tone. 
Many women fi nd it diffi cult to be adequately assertive with 
men so that their ideas are taken seriously and their views 
are given full consideration.
Isolation
The negative pole of the psychosocial crisis of early adult-
hood is isolation. As social beings, people have a deep need 
for a sense of connection and belonging. Isolation, and the 
accompanying feeling of being unable to experience inter-
subjectivity or shared meaning, is a major source of psycho-
logical distress (Jordan, 1997). As with the negative poles 
of other psychosocial crises, most people experience some 
periods of this extreme. The more fully developed the ego 
becomes, the more it is characterized by clear bounda-
ries. One by-product of individuality and independence is 
a heightened sense of separateness from others. During a 
period of intense personal growth and discovery, a person 
may experience interpersonal isolation, feeling preoccupied 
by thoughts and emotions that cannot be easily shared with 
others (Rokach & Neto, 2001).
The obstacles to attainment of an intimate relationship are 
many. Some arise from childhood experiences of shame, guilt, 
inferiority, or alienation, which undermine the achievement of 
personal identity. Others result from incompatibility between 
partners. The number of adjustments that intimacy requires 
may overwhelm some young adults. Obstacles to intimacy 
derive from environmental circumstances that may erode the 
person’s feelings of self-worth or interfere with the establish-
ment of mutuality. These obstacles may be embedded in the 
socialization process, as children learn distinct gender roles 
that introduce antagonism between men and women and fos-
ter interpersonal styles that stand in the way of forming open, 
caring interpersonal relationships. Seven themes discussed in 
the following sections illustrate experiences of isolation: lone-
liness, depression, fragile identity, sexual disorders, situational 
factors, divergent spheres of interest, and enmeshment.
Loneliness
Feelings of loneliness can be separated into three categories: 
transient, situational, and chronic (Meer, 1985). Transient 
loneliness lasts a short time and passes, as when you hear a 
song or an expression that reminds you of someone you love 
characterized by an atmosphere of romantic illusions, such 
as, “Together we can conquer the world.” The romance of an 
intimate relationship is a refl ection of the energy and sense 
of well-being that come from the support and understanding 
that are shared within it (Murray, Homes, & Griffi n, 1996). 
There is a deep sense that intimate relationships are not 
replaceable.
Interaction Styles of Men and Women
Men interact less intimately than women. They generally 
demonstrate more competitiveness, less agreement, and 
lower levels of self-disclosure than women. However, levels 
of self-disclosure are not related to loneliness for men as they 
are for women. It appears that men have the same capacity 
for intimate interaction as women, but they do not choose to 
exercise it with other men. Whereas women consider inti-
macy appropriate for both same-sex and opposite-sex rela-
tionships, men tend to restrict their intimate interactions to 
women (Bank & Hansford, 2000).
In a national sample of more than 2,500 adults, men’s and 
women’s relationships were compared (Umberson, Chen, 
House, Hopkins, & Slaten, 1996). Women were shown to 
have more support from friends, they experienced higher 
levels of social integration (involvement in personally mean-
ingful relationships), and were more likely to report having 
a confi dant than were men. Married women received more 
support from their adult children than did men, whereas 
men received more support from their spouses than did 
women. In fact, almost 50% of men said that their confi dant 
was their wife, whereas only 20% of women said that their 
confi dant was their husband.
Intimacy in the Work Setting
A common context for the establishment of intimacy is the 
work setting. Affi liation and close friendships are likely to 
develop among coworkers. Workers may express devotion 
to an older leader or teacher. Through conversations, cor-
respondence, conferences, or informal interaction on the 
golf course or at the bowling alley, coworkers can achieve an 
affectionate, playful, and enriching relationship. This kind of 
intimacy is demonstrated in the following refl ection about a 
coworker.
Alan was very infl uential. I respected him as being pretty 
sharp and pretty astute. He had a lot of guts to tackle the 
problems that existed in the area and that was the union-
management business. I was really identifying with him in 
terms of what and how you run something, how you man-
age something. You would sit down and talk about or de-
bate how you do certain things, what should we do in this 
kind of situation. We would be right in line. I think it was 
the way I came at a problem; it might be similar to the way 
he would come at a problem. (Kram, 1985, p. 33)
The increased presence of men and women as cowork-
ers in the work setting has introduced new difficulties in

Attachment Styles 
and Relationship 
Formation
ATTACHMENT THEORY HAS become an 
important framework for understanding 
the process of relationship formation 
(Fraley & Shaver, 2000). One’s attachment 
style, established in infancy, provides a 
template for orienting toward intimate 
relationships in adulthood. Anxiety over 
abandonment, comfort or discomfort 
with closeness and emotional disclosure, 
and the level of self-esteem associated 
with a secure or insecure attachment 
can all contribute to the type of partner 
one seeks and one’s ability to sustain 
an intimate relationship (Brennan & 
Shaver, 1995; Jones & Cunningham, 
1996; Brennan & Morris, 1997). The 
threat of loss of access (both physical and 
emotional access) to an intimate partner 
is likely to produce anxiety, protest, and 
steps to regain proximity.
Bartholomew (1990) developed an 
attachment typology based on one’s 
attachment experiences in infancy and 
toddlerhood. One can have a positive 
or negative assessment of the self, and 
a positive or negative assessment of 
others (see Table 11.3).
Secure individuals have a positive 
model of themselves and of others: “It 
is easy for me to become emotionally 
close to others. I am comfortable 
depending on them and having them 
depend on me.”
Preoccupied individuals have a 
positive model of others, but a negative 
model of the self: “I want to be com-
pletely emotionally intimate with others, 
but I often fi nd that others are reluctant 
to get as close as I would like. I am 
uncomfortable being without close 
relationships, but I sometimes worry 
that others don’t value me as much as I 
value them.” When one or both partners 
are characterized by a preoccupied 
attachment, the likelihood of abuse in 
the relationship increases (Henderson, 
Bartholomew, Trinke, & Kwong, 2005).
Dismissing avoidant individuals have 
a positive model of self, but a negative 
model of others: “I am comfortable 
without close emotional relationships. 
It is very important to me to feel 
independent and self-suffi cient, and I 
prefer not to depend on others or have 
others depend on me.”
Fearful avoidant individuals have a 
negative model of both self and others: “I 
am uncomfortable getting close to others. 
I want emotionally close relationships, but 
I fi nd it diffi cult to trust others completely, 
or to depend on them” (Crowell, Fraley, 
& Shaver, 1999, p. 451).
The secure and the dismissing 
individuals have high self-esteem; 
however, they differ markedly in the 
value they place on intimacy and 
in their interpersonal style. Secure 
individuals value relationships and 
are viewed as warm and nurturing. In 
contrast, dismissing individuals minimize 
relationships in favor of self-reliance and 
are viewed as cold or competitive. The 
fearful avoidant and the preoccupied 
individuals lack the self-esteem of the 
secure or dismissing groups. However, 
the fearful individuals avoid social contact, 
whereas the preoccupied individuals try 
hard to engage in relationships.
Interestingly, individuals seek out 
partners with similar attachment styles. 
Not everyone is looking for a partner 
with a secure attachment. Fearful 
avoidant individuals, for example, prefer 
other anxious partners over dismissing 
or secure ones—perhaps because they 
are better able to interpret and predict 
the relationship behaviors of those who 
have a similar attachment orientation 
(Frazier, Byer, Fischer, Wright, & DeBord, 
1996).
The context of the relationship 
may also alter one’s characteristic 
attachment responses. When a close 
romantic relationship is perceived to 
be deteriorating, insecure avoidant 
behaviors may increase, even among 
those who have a secure attachment 
style (Gillath & Shaver, 2007).
Critical Thinking questions
 1. What are some similarities and 
differences between the attachment 
styles described in infancy and those 
described here regarding adult 
romantic relationships?
 2. Imagine that people have been set 
up on a blind date. How might the 
following couples get along?
  • Secure and Dismissing 
  • Secure and Preoccupied 
  • Preoccupied and Fearful Avoidant 
  •  Dismissing Avoidant and Fearful 
Avoidant
 3. Critically evaluate the model proposed 
in this analysis of adult attachment 
style. What are some strengths and 
weaknesses of creating a typology 
based on these two dimensions? What 
aspects of the attachment construct 
are omitted in this approach?
 4. Invent your own model for charac-
terizing adult orientations to romantic 
relationships. How much would you 
rely on the attachment paradigm for 
this model? What other conceptual 
themes might you draw on to classify 
how people approach intimate 
relationships?
 5. How could you take account 
of culture in conceptualizing 
the way people orient toward 
intimate relationships? How might 
people with more independent or 
interdependent views differ in the 
type of partner they seek?

The Psychosocial Crisis: Intimacy versus Isolation | 471
levels of loneliness (Rokach, Bacanli, & Ramberan, 2000). In 
contrast, those who are lonely are more angry and anxious, 
have greater fear of negative evaluation, and a more pessi-
mistic outlook about the future of a relationship (Cacioppo 
et al., 2006). Although it may seem logical to suggest that 
the lonely person should try harder to meet new people or 
develop new social skills, it is possible that the sense of isola-
tion interferes with more active coping strategies.
Depression
Depression is a worldwide health problem (Moussavi et al., 
2007). When combined with one or more other chronic dis-
eases such as arthritis, asthma, or diabetes, it substantially 
worsens a person’s health conditions. As a result, people who 
have a chronic health problem and depression are less able to 
engage in the kinds of social activities and pleasurable interac-
tions that are likely to result in the formation of intimate rela-
tionships. Isolation may be a cause as well as a consequence 
of depression. For some women, clinical depression appears to 
be linked to an orientation toward intimacy in which the self 
is systematically inhibited and devalued (Jack & Dill, 1992). 
They have a rigid view of how they should act in an intimate 
relationship, which is characterized by four major themes:
 1. They judge themselves by external standards, feeling that 
they never quite measure up to what other people expect 
of them.
 2. They believe that they should build a close relationship 
with a man by putting his needs ahead of their own, and 
that to do otherwise is selfi sh.
 3. They try to maintain a relationship by avoiding confl ict 
and repressing their own views, if they think those views 
may lead to disagreement.
 4. They perceive themselves as presenting a false front, in 
which they appear happy and satisfi ed on the outside 
although they are angry or resentful inside.
Over time, women who endorse this outlook lose contact 
with their authentic self, and even if the relationship remains 
stable, they become increasingly depressed. Longitudinal 
studies fi nd that depression in one of the partners and rela-
tionship distress occur together. Depression has a negative 
impact on relationship quality; and poor relationship quality 
increases depression (Papp, 2010).
For some, the roots of depression may begin in adoles-
cence. Those young people who tend to internalize their 
feelings under conditions of stress are likely to experi-
ence feelings of loneliness, lack of self-worth, anxiety, and 
depression. People who develop internalizing disorders 
in adolescence are at greater risk of continuing to experi-
ence depression as adults (Pine, Cohen, Gurley, Brook, & 
Ma, 1998). One of the most common stressors that may 
set off a bout of depression in adolescence is the breakup 
of a romantic relationship (Monroe, Rohde, Seeley, & 
Lewinsohn, 1999). As adolescents move into early adult-
hood, they may be more inclined to isolation as a way of 
who is far away. Situational loneliness accompanies a sudden 
loss or a move to a new city. Chronic loneliness lasts a long 
time and cannot be linked to a specifi c stressor. Chronically 
lonely people may have an average number of social contacts, 
but they do not achieve the desired level of intimacy in these 
interactions (Berg & Peplau, 1982). Many chronically lonely 
people are highly anxious about all types of social activities 
(Cacioppo et al., 2000). They believe that success in social 
relationships is important, but expect social encounters to be 
diffi cult and to end poorly. People who have high levels of 
social anxiety tend to use interpersonal strategies that place 
barriers in the way of intimacy. They are likely to be self-
deprecating and obsessed by the possibilities of negative out-
comes of social interactions. These people tend to let others 
establish the direction and purpose of interpersonal activi-
ties. There appears to be a strong relationship between social 
skills and loneliness. People who have higher levels of social 
skills, including friendliness, communication skills, appro-
priate nonverbal behavior, and appropriate responses to oth-
ers, have more adequate social support systems and lower

CHAPTER 11 Early  Adulthood  (24 to 34 years)
Gary’s pattern was always the same: First, the unbearable 
anxiety, never feeling good enough to handle the latest 
stress at his architect’s job. Then, the familiar response—a 
furtive scanning of newspaper ads, a drive to a strip show, 
two straight Scotches to catch a buzz, and fi nally a massage 
parlor. . . . Afterward, he’d sit naked on the edge of the bed, his 
thought roiling in disgust: “I must be sick . . . I can’t change.” 
But a few days later, the anxiety would begin again and 
he’d pore over the ads.” (From L. Rosellini, 1992, “Sexual 
Desire,” U.S. News & World Report, 113(1), p. 64. Reprinted 
by permission.)
Some psychologists view compulsive sexual behavior as 
an anxiety-based disorder, like other compulsions. Others 
argue that it is an addiction, like alcoholism. All agree that 
those who suffer from this disorder are not able to integrate 
sexual behavior as a meaningful component of an intimate 
relationship.
Situational Factors
Isolation can also result from situational factors. A young 
man goes off to war in Afghanistan and returns after being 
seriously wounded, resulting in the amputation of his left 
leg. As a result of his injuries, he doubts whether he could 
be an attractive or effective partner, and he is reluctant to 
engage in social activities to pursue romantic interests. A 
young woman rejects marriage in order to attend medical 
school and fi nds little time for the formation of intimate rela-
tionships. By the time she completes her internship and resi-
dency, she has many fewer options for fi nding an intimate 
partner. Under these and other similar circumstances, desires 
for intimacy may not be met.
Divergent Spheres of Interest
Isolation can arise even within an ongoing relationship as 
a product of diverging spheres of interest and activity. In a 
traditional marriage, for example, the husband and wife may 
participate in distinct roles and activities. Marriages char-
acterized by such a division of life spheres are sometimes 
referred to as his-and-her marriages (Bernard, 1972). The wife 
stays home most of the day, interacting with the children and 
the other wives in the neighborhood. The husband is away 
from home all day, interacting with his coworkers. When the 
partners have leisure time, they pursue different interests: for 
instance, the woman likes to play cards and the man likes to 
hunt. Over the years, the partners have less and less in com-
mon. Isolation is refl ected in their lack of mutual understand-
ing and lack of support for each other’s life goals and needs.
Enmeshment
Although Erikson thought of the construct of intimacy in 
tension with the construct of isolation, some family therapists 
offer another tension: between healthy intimacy and enmesh-
ment (Minuchin, 1978). Within this framework, a family 
is viewed as a structured system that contains individuals 
protecting themselves from the depression that they have 
learned to associate with risks of rejection in romantic 
relationships.
Fragile Identity
According to the psychosocial perspective, work on personal 
identity precedes the capacity for adult intimacy. Longitudi-
nal research that followed a group of adolescents from ages 
15 to 24 supported this developmental sequence, demon-
strating a clear relationship between the ego strengths associ-
ated with personal identity in middle and later adolescence 
with the capacity for mature intimate relationships in early 
adulthood (Beyers & Seuffge-Krenke, 2010). For some peo-
ple, the possibility of closeness with another person seriously 
threatens the sense of self. They imagine intimate relation-
ships to be a blurring of the boundaries of their own identi-
ties and cannot let themselves engage in them. People who 
fear a loss of identity continually erect barriers between 
themselves and others in order to keep their sense of self 
intact. Their fragile sense of self results from accumulated 
experiences of childhood that have fostered the development 
of personal identities that are either rigid and brittle or else 
totally confused. Such a tenuous sense of identity requires 
that individuals constantly remind themselves who they are. 
They may not allow their identities to stand on their own 
strength while they lose themselves, even momentarily, 
in others. They are so busy maintaining their identities or 
struggling to make sense out of confusion that they cannot 
attain intimacy.
Sexual Disorders
Isolation may be linked to sexual disorders. Two widely cited 
desire disorders are hypoactive sexual desire, a decrease or 
absence of interest in sexual activity, and compulsive sexual 
behavior, a compulsive need to relieve anxiety through sex 
(Coleman, 2003). A loss of sexual desire is usually accompa-
nied by physical withdrawal from the partner and by feelings 
of guilt and dread about losing intimacy. At the same time, 
the unafflicted partner often feels angry and guilty about 
imposing sexual needs on an unresponsive and uninterested 
partner, as in the following example.
At fi rst it was fun: feverish kisses in his red Chevy, giggly 
nights of passion in the apartment. But then came marriage, 
two kids, and suddenly her husband’s hands on her fl esh 
felt like tentacles, and the sight of him approaching made 
her body stiffen with revulsion. Then the disagreements be-
gan, hurtful scenes ending with each of them lying wedged 
against opposite sides of the bed, praying for sleep. (From L. 
Rosellini, 1992, “Sexual Desire,” U.S. News & World Report, 
113(1), p. 62. Reprinted by permission.)
In the case of compulsive sexual behavior, as in the fol-
lowing anecdote, sex is disconnected from pleasure or inti-
macy. Satisfaction of sexual drives is often accompanied by 
shame and disgust.

 
The Central Process: Mutuality Among Peers | 473
believe in and invest in the relationship (Avery, 1989). The 
partners may also realize that they depend on each other to 
solve the problems that they face as a couple.
Mutuality in relationships has been studied by asking 
participants to read brief descriptions of relationship styles 
and to say which style characterizes their relationship with 
their mother, father, best friend, and romantic partner (Neff 
& Harter, 2003). Three relationship styles were described: 
one that emphasized autonomy and one’s personal needs, one 
that emphasized connection and the needs and feelings of 
the other person, and one that described an effort to balance 
autonomy and connection by refl ecting on what would be an 
effective response to the other person as well as meeting one’s 
own needs. This last style was considered evidence of mutu-
ality. Mutuality in a romantic relationship was associated with 
the most ideal outcomes, including relationship satisfaction, 
relational self-worth, and lack of relational depression.
Mutuality is strengthened as the two partners learn to 
rely on each other and as they discover that their combined 
efforts are more effective than their individual efforts would 
be. Mutuality, like attachment, is a characteristic of the 
dyadic relationship rather than of the individual members in 
it (Rusbult & Arriaga, 1997). It is formed as two individu-
als, each of whom has a well-defi ned identity, discover that 
they can have open, direct communication, hold each other 
in high regard, and respond effectively to each other.
The Prime Adaptive Ego 
Quality and the Core Pathology
Love
For thousands of years, the nature of love and the qualities 
of a loving relationship have been described in songs and 
stories. In the resolution of the crisis of intimacy versus 
grouped into subsystems linked by patterns of communica-
tion, boundaries, alliances, and rules. As individual family 
members change and grow, the adaptive family experiences 
transitions that alter the structure. Families are character-
ized along a continuum from disengaged to enmeshed. The 
disengaged relationships are characterized by infrequent 
contact and a sense that the members of the family do not 
really seem to care about one another. This pattern may be 
viewed as similar to Erikson’s concept of isolation within a 
family group. The enmeshed relationships, in contrast, are 
characterized by over-involvement in one another’s lives, to 
the extent that any change in one family member is met by 
strong resistance by the others; individuality is viewed as a 
threat to the relationship. Individuals in an enmeshed rela-
tionship may fear isolation to such a degree that they prevent 
one another from any movement toward autonomy.
The Central Process: 
Mutuality Among Peers
The central process through which intimacy is acquired 
is mutuality among peers. Mutuality refers to empathic 
awareness of one another, understanding of self and other, 
and the ability and willingness to regulate one’s needs in 
order to respond to the needs of one’s partner (Skerrett, 
1996). One must be able to give and receive pleasure within 
the intimate context (Jeffries, 1993). The two young adults 
must bring equal strengths and resources to the relationship. 
Their intimacy is built on their ability to meet each other’s 
needs and accept each other’s weaknesses. When one partner 
needs to be dependent, the other is strong and supportive; at 
other times, the roles may be reversed. Each partner under-
stands that the other is capable of many kinds of relation-
ships. Mutuality facilitates the couple’s ability to meet each 
other’s needs in different ways over time rather than produc-
ing a static, unitary relationship. In fact, mutuality should 
enhance both individual and couple development. In the 
process of supporting each other, both partners perform in 
ways that they might not have adopted had they been alone.
The concept of mutuality has been used in previous chap-
ters to describe the development of a sense of basic trust 
during infancy. In that context, the distribution of resources, 
experience, and strength is quite uneven. Mutuality is pos-
sible only because the caregiver is committed to the infant’s 
well-being. Through caregivers’ consistent efforts, children 
eventually learn to regulate their needs to fi t the family pat-
tern. However, children at this stage are not expected to be 
sophisticated enough to assess and meet their caregivers’ 
needs. In young adulthood, the partners are responsible for 
fulfi lling each other’s needs. In most cases, there is no benev-
olent, superordinate caregiver. Just as the infant learns to 
trust the caregiver’s ability to meet personal needs, each adult 
partner learns to trust the other’s ability to anticipate and sat-
isfy the partner’s needs. By expressing trust and commitment 
to one another, each partner strengthens the other’s ability to

actions differs from culture to culture, based on the culture’s 
ideals about human nature, relationships, and cultural roles, 
especially courtship, marriage, childrearing, and religion.
In Western cultures, 10 components of a loving relation-
ship have been identifi ed:
 1. Promoting the welfare of the loved one
 2. Experiencing happiness with the loved one
 3. Highly regarding the loved one
 4. Being able to count on the loved one in time of need
 5. Mutually understanding the loved one
 6. Sharing oneself and one’s possessions with the loved one
 7. Receiving emotional support from the loved one
 8. Giving emotional support to the loved one
 9. Communicating intimately with the loved one
 10. Valuing the loved one in one’s own life
These 10 dimensions are present in relationships with 
parents, siblings, friends, and lovers. The weighting of the 10 
components, however, may vary. Also, some love relation-
ships include a dimension of sexual attraction, and others 
do not.
Romantic love has a motivational quality that is similar 
to other basic drives such as thirst and hunger. In brain 
imaging studies, people who have recently fallen deeply in 
love are shown photographs of their loved one (Aron et al., 
2005). Although participants experience a variety of emo-
tions, both positive and negative, as they gaze at the photo, 
they all typically show activation of the area of the brain 
associated with motivation and reward, areas that are rich 
in dopamine production. In addition to other cognitive 
and affective characteristics of love, there is a neurologi-
cal response associated with focused attention, new levels 
of energy, and feeling that a deep need is being satisfi ed. 
The association with dopamine-rich areas of the brain helps 
explain feelings similar to other types of craving, includ-
ing mental preoccupation with the loved one, anxiety when 
separated from the loved one, and a desire to maintain con-
tact with the loved one.
From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense to 
think that features of love have adaptive value. The pas-
sionate and romantic features of love open a person up to 
including another person in one’s life. In order to form a 
long-term relationship, a person has to reorganize activi-
ties, alter existing relationships, and modify living arrange-
ments. All these changes require a lot of energy and time. 
The passionate and romantic feelings of love probably con-
tribute to a person’s willingness to make all these changes. 
In contrast, the dimensions of intimacy and commitment 
contribute to the ability to sustain a relationship over long 
periods of time. Love between partners must be sustained 
in order to have and rear children, accumulate resources, 
fend off competitors, and preserve the social bonds of the 
family and community. The feelings of companionate love 
help motivate a person to remain devoted to one’s part-
ner in order to maintain the family system (Reis & Aron, 
2008).
isolation in early adulthood, the ego quality of love emerges 
as the capacity for mutuality and devotion that transcends 
the secure attachment of infancy. Robert Sternberg (1988) 
has described love as a set of feelings, thoughts, and motives 
that contribute to communication, sharing, and support. 
According to his theory, almost all types of love may be 
viewed as a combination of three dimensions: intimacy, the 
emotional investment in a relationship that promotes close-
ness and connection; passion, the expression of physical and 
psychological needs and desires in the relationship; and com-
mitment, the cognitive decision to remain in the relationship. 
These dimensions form a triangle that helps characterize 
the different types of love (see Figure 11.7). Each of these 
dimensions changes over time. Passion is the most fl eeting 
and, without commitment, is likely to result in a short-lived 
love. Intimacy and commitment can grow stronger over 
time. However, if passion and intimacy both decline, com-
mitment may dwindle as well (Belsky, 1997). An important 
aspect of this theory is that it helps account for loving rela-
tionships that do not follow the romantic ideal of U.S. cul-
ture. The factor of commitment, which may originate from 
valued kinship obligations or economic practicalities, can 
sustain a relationship and foster an enduring love with or 
without intimacy or passion.
Conceptions of love usually include four aspects: ideas 
about the beloved, feelings that are associated with love, 
thoughts associated with love, and actions that are likely 
to occur between the lover and the beloved (Beall & Stern-
berg, 1995). The exact content of these feelings, beliefs, and

the duration of fi rst marriages and the probability that they 
will end in separation or divorce in 6-month intervals from 
6 months to 20 years (Bramlett & Mosher, 2002). This study 
found that 20% of all fi rst marriages have dissolved through 
separation or divorce at the end of 5 years; 33% have dis-
solved after 10 years; and 43% have dissolved after 15 
years. These data are especially accurate for understanding 
the marital trajectory for women who married at younger 
ages, because a woman who married at age 30, for example, 
would be 50 after 20 years of marriage, and she would not 
have been included in the study. This study does not include 
information about the rate of dissolution of cohabiting cou-
ples, which would add another dimension to our under-
standing of relationship instability.
The focus of the following section is on the experiences 
of adults who are going through divorce rather than on the 
impact of divorce on children. The median age at fi rst mar-
riage is about 24 for women and 26 for men, and the median 
length of marriage is 7 years; therefore, one can expect that 
many individuals experience the divorce process during 
their early adulthood.
Factors Contributing to Divorce
How can we explain the high divorce rate? Here are some of 
the many hypotheses offered to account for the high divorce 
rate in the United States:
• We have an overly romantic idea about marriage; the real-
ity of married life cannot live up to our expectations.
• We are overly individualistic and unprepared to make the 
commitment to achieve a collective goal.
• Men and women are socialized to fear and mistrust or 
devalue one another.
• We are an overly secular culture with too little commit-
ment to religious values.
• The need for both partners to be involved in the world of 
work interferes with the establishment and nurturing of 
intimate relationships.
• Marriage is an outmoded institution, perpetuated by a 
patriarchal power structure.
• Women who work do not need to remain in unsupportive 
marriages.
• Men whose wives work do not feel obligated to remain in 
a marriage to support their wives.
• Smaller family size means less time devoted to chil-
drearing, and more opportunity for nonparental, adult 
exploration.
• The longer life span makes it unrealistic that marriages 
can endure throughout adulthood.
• Children who experience insecure attachments and mari-
tal instability grow up to be young adults who are unable 
to sustain intimate relationships.
• Marriage is a status that requires access to financial 
resources; lack of equitable employment opportunities 
and high risks of unemployment threaten the stability of 
marriage among low-income populations.
Exclusivity
The core pathology of this period is exclusivity—a shutting 
out of others. To some extent, exclusivity is a natural element 
in intimate relations. For example, sexual exclusivity tends 
to be valued in monogamous, sexual relationships. From an 
evolutionary perspective, women value their male partner’s 
sexual exclusivity in order to insure that his resources will be 
directed toward her and her offspring. Men will value their 
female partner’s sexual exclusivity in order to insure their 
paternity. At some level, however, exclusivity can become 
destructive to one’s ability to have relationships. Exclusivity 
of this type is characterized by intense jealousy, a rivalrous 
orientation toward anyone who shows an interest in one’s 
loved one, and preoccupation with intense feelings of anger 
and resentment, both toward the loved one and toward oth-
ers (Firestone, Firestone, & Catlett, 2006). The person has to 
expend tremendous energy monitoring the activities of the 
loved one. As a result, the person is cut off from relation-
ships and ends up isolated. Ideally, the experiences of inti-
macy and love should broaden one’s sense of connection and 
social integration. Through exclusivity, however, one’s social 
support network is limited.
Exclusivity may be extended to the overestimation of one’s 
family, religious group, and national group. As the result of a 
belief about one’s superiority, individuals become unwilling 
to seek out new people or new experiences. Exclusivity may 
limit one’s willingness to entertain new ideas. In order to 
preserve the belief in the value of one’s exclusive world, one 
has to distort reality, limit access to new information, and 
restrict movement in the social environment. Thus, exclusiv-
ity becomes a substantial impediment to coping.
APPLIED TOPIC
Divorce
Objective 7. To analyze divorce as a life stressor in early 
adulthood, including the factors contributing to it and 
the process of coping with it.
AMERICANS HAVE ONE of the highest rates of marriage 
among modern industrial societies. Almost everyone in the 
United States wants to get married, and does. However, the 
divorce rate is also high. In 2008, 7.3% of those ages 30 to 
34 had been divorced; another 3% had separated (U.S. Cen-
sus, 2010). In international comparisons, the divorce rate in 
the United States is higher than that of 34 other countries 
including the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and 
Australia. After 5 years of marriage, 23% of marriages in the 
United States end in separation or divorce. The next high-
est rates were 12% in what was West Germany, and 11% in 
Austria and Sweden (Cherlin, 2009). An analysis of the mar-
riage history of a nationally representative sample of women 
ages 15 to 44 in the United States provided an estimate of

A large number of variables have been examined as cor-
relates or predictors of divorce. The scope of these analyses 
encompasses cross-national studies, historical cohort analy-
ses, multicounty comparisons, and cross-sectional compari-
sons of couples. At the societal level, countries where there 
are fewer women than men and where women marry at a 
later age have lower divorce rates. In traditional patrilin-
eal societies, such as many Arab cultures, the social order 
is organized around families linked through ties of blood 
and marriage. Relationships are organized in a hierarchy 
of obligations and privileges that are maintained through 
an interdependence of family ties. Divorce rates are low in 
traditional Arab cultures, where the stigma of disrupting a 
marriage is not only felt at the individual level but results 
in harming important kinship bonds that are critical to the 
larger social structure (Savaya & Cohen, 2003). In countries 
or regions where traditional gender attitudes are combined 
with traditional division of labor, that is where men are in the 
labor market and women are responsible for the home, the 
divorce rate is lower. In countries or regions where women 
endorse more emancipatory gender values, divorce rates are 
higher regardless of women’s participation in the labor mar-
ket (Gelissen, 2003; Kalmijn, De Graaf, & Poortman, 2004).
In a comparison of divorce rates across more than 3,000 
counties in the United States, another important construct 
was identifi ed—social integration, or the degree to which 
“people are tied or connected to one another, shared values 
being an important element in such integration” (Breault & 
Kposowa, 1987, p. 556). The characteristics of a commu-
nity infl uence this sense of connectedness. Among the most 
signifi cant of these characteristics are population change, the 
number of people who move in or out of a community each 
year; religious integration, the percentage of the population 
that belongs to a religious organization; and urbanity, the 
percentage of people in each county who live in an urban 
area. Divorce rates are signifi cantly linked to each of these 
characteristics: They are higher in counties with high popu-
lation change, low religious integration, and high urbanity. 
These fi ndings suggest that the diffi culties that individual 
couples experience in their marriages may be aggravated by 
the community context. In contrast, marriages may be buff-
ered and supported by a sense of community identity and 
shared destiny (Rosenfeld, 2007).
At the level of couple-to-couple comparisons, four vari-
ables have been associated with the likelihood of divorce: age 
at marriage, socioeconomic level, differences in socioemo-
tional development of the partners, and the family’s history 
of divorce.
Age at Marriage
In the United States, the incidence of divorce is especially 
high for couples who marry before the age of 20. For women 
who marry younger than age 18, 48% have experienced 
marital disruption within 10 years following the marriage. In 
contrast, for women marrying at age 25 and older, only 24% 
have experienced marital disruption within 10 years (Bram-
lett & Mosher, 2002).
Both for couples who marry young and for those who 
marry at an older age, dissatisfaction with role performance 
is a signifi cant factor in marital instability. For young couples, 
dissatisfaction centers on sexual infi delity and jealousy. For 
older couples, it focuses on interpersonal confl ict, a domi-
neering style, and lack of companionship. Age at marriage 
is associated with different developmental needs and varying 
threats to marital stability. Of course, age at marriage is not a 
For couples who are dissolving 
a distressed marriage, hostility 
and resentment that have been 
characteristic of their relation-
ship are likely to escalate during 
the divorce process. Despite 
the fact that attorneys are pres-
ent, negotiations are likely to be 
riddled with angry interactions 
and communication failures.

characterized as confl icted in their relationship during the 
premarital period, who have frequent disagreements, and 
who have different perceptions of how to resolve arguments 
are more likely to be separated or divorced 3 years after mar-
riage (Fowers, Montel, & Olson, 1996). Generally, women 
experience more stress and reported more problems in 
adjusting to marriage than men (Cotten, 1999). They tend to 
be more dissatisfi ed with the level of intimacy in their mar-
riage than are men. These factors were examined earlier in 
the discussion of adjustment to marriage. Mutual satisfaction 
in marriage depends heavily on the husband’s qualities. The 
stability of the husband’s masculine identity, the happiness 
of his parents’ marriage, his educational level, his social sta-
tus, and his ability to be comfortable with the expression of 
emotions all affect marital happiness. Many husbands, how-
ever, enter marriage with a deep need to be nurtured and to 
continue the pattern of care that they received in childhood. 
The stability of a marriage depends on both partners’ achiev-
ing a sense of their own identity. This achievement helps to 
establish the balance of power and mutual respect that is so 
central to emotional and intellectual intimacy.
Family History of Divorce
The partners’ family history of divorce is yet another factor 
that contributes to marital instability. Children of divorced 
parents are more likely to get divorced themselves than are 
children of intact marriages. A number of large national 
studies find that parental divorce markedly increases the 
chances that an adult child’s marriage will end in divorce. For 
example, Amato (1996) reported that “the odds of divorce 
increased by 69% if the wife’s parents had been divorced and 
by 189% if both the wife’s and the husband’s parents had 
been divorced” (cited in Amato & DeBoer, 2001, p. 1038).
There are many interpretations of this intergenerational 
transmission of divorce (Amato & DeBoer, 2001). One inter-
pretation is that, having seen their parents voluntarily end 
their marriage, children of divorce do not view marriage as 
a lifelong commitment and hold more favorable attitudes 
toward divorce as a reasonable strategy for resolving mari-
tal confl ict (Greenberg & Nay, 1982). Another explanation 
is that children from single-parent and remarried families 
are likely to marry at an earlier age than children in intact 
marriages, thus increasing the probability of divorce. A third 
explanation is that children whose parents are in low-quality, 
high-confl ict marriages are exposed to high levels of negative 
affect and parental hostility. This may create insecure attach-
ment relations and result in poor relationship skills, which 
in turn make it diffi cult to form and sustain intimate adult 
relationships (Amato & Booth, 1996).
In a 17-year longitudinal study of marital stability, Amato 
and DeBoer (2001) were able to link the quality of the par-
ents’ marriage to the probability that their children’s marriage 
would end in divorce. Of 335 married children, 20% had 
experienced a divorce or separation. Discord in the parents’ 
marriage was not a strong predictor of divorce among the 
children. Rather, the study found that children who divorced 
single explanatory dimension. For those who marry young, 
there is also a greater incidence of premarital pregnancy, 
dropping out of school, and lower-paying employment—all 
of which contribute to the likelihood of divorce.
Socioeconomic Level
The concept of socioeconomic level is complex. It may be 
thought of as a combination of education, occupation, and 
income. Each of these components is uniquely related to the 
divorce rate (White & Rogers, 2000). Men with more educa-
tion have lower divorce rates. Women with more education 
also have lower divorce rates, except that those with 5 or 
more years of college are somewhat more likely to divorce 
than those who have had only 4 years (that is, have gradu-
ated from college). Within this overall pattern, there is also 
evidence of the Glick effect: Men and women who have 
dropped out of high school or college have higher divorce 
rates than those who have completed high school or college. 
Furthermore, those who have graduated from high school 
have a lower divorce rate than those who have had 1 to 3 
years of college. Glick (1957) explained this pattern as evi-
dence of lack of persistence. Those who are not able to com-
plete a unit of schooling may also lack the resources to work 
at resolving the problems they encounter in marriage.
Many people believe that divorce is a privilege of the 
rich, but the evidence suggests that the opposite is true. 
The divorce and separation rates are generally higher among 
couples with minimal education and low incomes. Total 
family income is related to marital stability in some distinct 
ways. First, an erratic income and a high level of debt are 
more strongly associated with marital disruption than a low, 
steady income. Second, the relationship between income 
and marital instability is different for men and women. For 
men, higher income is associated with low divorce rates. 
For women, when wives contribute 50% to 60% of the total 
family income, and when they express low to moderate mar-
ital happiness, divorce is more likely. This explanation sug-
gests that when both partners bring about equal economic 
resources to the marriage, there is less of a sense of obliga-
tion to remain in an unhappy relationship (Rogers, 2004).
Socioemotional Development of the 
Partners
Socioemotional development is reflected in such dimen-
sions as the partners’ self-acceptance, autonomy, and expres-
siveness. Personality factors associated with emotionality 
and constraint have been linked with the risk of divorce. 
Both positive and negative emotionality increase the risk of 
divorce, whereas constraint decreases it. The genetic basis of 
these personality factors and the study of the link between 
personality factors and marital history among twins have led 
some researchers to argue that genetic factors play a role in 
the risk of divorce (Jockin, McGue, & Lykken, 1996).
Problems in communication are frequently cited by men 
and women as a major cause of divorce. Couples who are

CHAPTER 11 Early  Adulthood  (24 to 34 years)
be associated with stronger feelings of emotional turmoil 
(Duran-Aydintug, 1995; Vannoy, 1995).
Attachment to a Former Spouse
One challenge in coping with divorce is that many divorced 
people retain a strong attachment to their former spouse. 
Grief in divorce has been compared to bereavement in wid-
owhood. In both cases, there is a loss and a need to adjust 
to it. Although the loss due to death may be more intense, 
especially if it is sudden, the loss due to divorce may be more 
bitter. If an affectionate bond has been established, there 
is certain to be ambivalence about losing it even when the 
divorce is desired. Attachment to a former spouse may be 
positive or negative (one may wish for a reconciliation or 
blame the spouse, respectively) or both.
In a study of more than 200 divorced people, 42% 
expressed moderate or strong attachment to their for-
mer spouse. Some people wondered what their former 
spouse was doing, spent a lot of time thinking about them, 
expressed disbelief that the divorce had really taken place, 
and felt that they would never get over it. The attachment 
was stronger for those who had not initiated the divorce. The 
lingering feelings of attachment were associated with greater 
diffi culties in adjustment to divorce, especially problems of 
loneliness and doubt about being able to cope with single life 
(Kitson, 1982). The stronger the positive or negative post-
divorce attachment, the more diffi cult the adjustment in the 
years following the divorce (Tschann, Johnston, & Waller-
stein, 1989).
In contrast to mental preoccupation or rumination about 
a former spouse, many former spouses continue to have con-
tact with each other. In a Dutch study of almost 1,800 former 
spouses, almost half continued to have contact 10 years after 
the divorce (Fischer, DeGraaf, & Kalmihn, 2005). Over time, 
contact with a former spouse decreases, especially antago-
nistic contact. Yet, even 10 years after divorce about 5% of 
the sample reported antagonistic contact; women reporting 
threats of physical harm from their former husbands and 
men reporting verbal aggression from their former wives. 
Contact was most frequent for couples who had children 
together before the divorce. For couples who did not have 
children, about 60% no longer had any contact with a for-
mer spouse 10 years after divorce. For couples with chil-
dren, about 70% have contact with each other 10 years after 
divorce. For these couples, antagonistic contact declined and 
friendly contact increased over this time.
The fact that divorce is stressful and that people have lin-
gering attachments to their former spouse does not mean 
that they consider the divorce undesirable. Studies that 
ask divorcing people what went wrong in the relationship 
suggest that for many, the conditions of the marriage were 
demeaning, exploitive, or oppressive.
Common complaints by wives include their husband’s au-
thoritarianism, mental cruelty, verbal and physical abuse, ex-
cessive drinking, lack of love, neglect of children,  emotional 
were in families in which there was relatively little confl ict, 
but which nonetheless ended in divorce. This lends support 
to the explanation that these children are not as committed 
to a lifelong view of marriage. When marital unhappiness 
occurs, these children have less inhibition about ending the 
relationship, especially if a more attractive alternative is likely.
Coping with Divorce
Divorce is not a single event, but a relatively long process 
starting with thoughts about the possibility of divorce, 
through possible steps of marital counseling, reconciliation, 
mediation, trial separation, and legal action. It is an under-
statement to say that divorce is stressful. Divorce is associ-
ated with numerous losses, including the loss of fi nancial 
resources, emotional support, one’s marital and parental 
role, social support, and social integration (Demo, Fine, & 
Ganong, 2000). Loss of income may result in other kinds of 
material loss. For example, a divorced woman and her chil-
dren may have to move to less expensive housing, sell many 
of their possessions, and leave the community where they 
have established a network of friends and social support.
Divorce can also bring role loss and social isolation. Even 
when a divorce is viewed as a desirable solution, the period 
from the suggestion of divorce to its conclusion involves a 
variety of decisions and confl icts that may be painful. In an 
analysis of a large national sample, researchers found that 
people experience increases in depression after divorce, 
regardless of whether they are leaving a negative marriage 
with high levels of conflict or a marriage that was not as 
unpleasant (Kalmijn & Monden, 2006). Divorced partners 
may lose contact with family and friends as each person’s 
social support system takes sides in the split (Kunz & Kunz, 
1995). In communities where there is high disapproval of 
divorce, men and women who decide to continue to live 
in their neighborhood following divorce are likely to suffer 
social rejection and loss of contact with neighbors and for-
mer friends (Kalmijn & Uunk, 2007).
Many people who experience divorce go through a time 
of intense self-analysis. They try to integrate the failure of 
their marriage with their personal defi nition of masculinity 
or femininity, competence as loving people, and long-held 
aspirations to enact the role of husband or wife, father or 
mother. The stress-related correlates of divorce include 
increased health problems, a higher incidence of suicide, and 
the overrepresentation of divorced adults in all forms of psy-
chiatric settings (Stack, 1990).
The process of leaving a marriage is different for the part-
ner who initiates the divorce than for the partner who is 
being left. The initiators view the process as more voluntary 
and tend to be more aware of support services and feel more 
in control, even if they experience some sentiments of self-
doubt and redefi nition. On the other hand, those who do 
not initiate the divorce are more likely to experience a period 
of shock and disbelief. They, too, must go through a process 
of identity redefi nition, which often takes longer and may 

 
Chapter Summary | 479
The magnitude of the stressors was not as important in pre-
dicting adjustment as were the coping strategies (resources 
and meaning).
In another study comparing widowed and divorced 
women, the contribution of social support to coping was 
examined in more detail. Those women who were most 
stressed by their loss received increased social support 
from friends and relatives in the following year. For the two 
groups, the most beneficial type of support differed. For 
widows, practical support, such as transportation or help 
with household chores, was positive; for those who had 
been divorced, having someone who would listen to their 
personal problems was especially helpful. For both groups, 
receiving monetary support was associated with an increase 
in distress. Thus, some types of social support appear to 
foster recovery, whereas others may serve to highlight the 
extent of one’s loss (Miller, Smerglia, Gaudet, & Kitson, 
1998).
The process of coping with divorce requires strategies 
devised to deal with the aspects of it that are perceived as 
most troublesome. Further, many coping strategies, includ-
ing becoming involved in new activities, spending more time 
with family and friends, gaining new skills, or taking a new 
job, may promote new levels of functioning. Human service 
professionals can be effective in helping adults develop cop-
ing skills for resolving some of the stresses of divorce and 
transforming a diffi cult life event into an opportunity for per-
sonal growth.
and personality problems, and extramarital sex. . . . More 
men than women describe themselves as having prob-
lems with alcohol, drugs, or physical abuse that con-
tributed to the divorce. (Demo, Fine, & Ganong, 2000, 
pp. 283–284)
Many divorced parents report that, despite the diffi culties 
of single parenting, life is more manageable than it was in 
the midst of the arguments and hostility that preceded the 
divorce.
Coping Strategies
Most people who experience divorce are determined to 
cope with the stresses it brings. Unfortunately, many adults 
do not anticipate the specifi c kinds of stressors that they 
will encounter. Of course, they have different coping strat-
egies, some of which may not be effective for the special 
demands of divorce. In a longitudinal study that focused 
on how people adjusted to divorce, the researchers empha-
sized (1) the kinds of stressors that the individuals encoun-
tered, (2) the resources they had to help them cope, and 
(3) the meaning they gave to the divorce situation (Wang 
& Amato, 2000). The major stressors were large losses in 
income, losing friends, and having to move. Those whose 
post-divorce adjustment was judged most positive had 
higher income levels, were dating someone steadily or 
remarried, were most favorable about the marital dissolu-
tion before the divorce, or actually initiated the divorce. 
Chapter Summary
Objective 1. To identify and defi ne selected concepts 
that are especially relevant for understanding development 
during adulthood, including social roles, the life course, 
and fulfi llment theories.
Three theoretical concepts were introduced to help consider 
the challenges and directions of growth in adulthood: social 
roles, the life course, and fulfillment theories. Adulthood 
comprises a series of increasingly complex and demanding 
roles, role gain and role loss, and the challenges of balancing 
multiple roles. The life course perspective is a framework for 
examining adulthood as the interface of family and occupa-
tional careers against the backdrop of chronological age, his-
torical period, and societal norms and expectations. Through 
the life course lens, one gains appreciation for the develop-
ing person and the changing historical context. Fulfi llment 
theories emphasize the ability of adults to go beyond meet-
ing daily needs and achieving equilibrium to make plans, 
strive toward goals, and seek personal meaning in life.
The developmental tasks of early adulthood require that 
individuals apply the many competencies they have acquired 
in childhood and adolescence to solving new and complex 
challenges. They may marry or make a commitment to an inti-
mate partner, have children or decide to delay or forgo child-
bearing, and choose work roles. Gradually, they evolve a style 
of life. In this process, their commitment to social institutions 
and to signifi cant others expands. Their worldview becomes 
more diverse, and their appreciation of the interdependence 
of systems increases. One of the major sources of stress at this 
life stage is the need to balance and integrate multiple roles.
Objective 2. To analyze the process of forming intimate 
relationships, including initial attractions, mate selection, 
and commitment to a long-term relationship; the role 
of cohabitation in forming close relationships; and the 
challenges that one faces in adjusting to the early years 
of marriage.
The exploration of intimate relationships requires a readi-
ness to engage in the complex set of dyadic interactions that 
move a relationship from initial attraction to deeper levels 

480 | 
CHAPTER 11 Early  Adulthood  (24 to 34 years)
Objective 5. To examine the concept of lifestyle as the 
expression of individual identity, with consideration for 
the pace of life, balancing competing role demands, 
building a supportive social network, and adopting 
practices to promote health and fi tness.
Lifestyle is the translation into action of the values, goals, 
and personal preferences that were crystallized into a per-
sonal identity in later adolescence. Components of lifestyle 
that impact the sense of well-being and personal life satisfac-
tion include the pace of life, the quality of one’s social net-
work, the ability to balance competing role demands, and 
behaviors that contribute to one’s fi tness and overall health.
Objective 6. To defi ne and describe the psychosocial 
crisis of intimacy versus isolation, the central process 
through which the crisis is resolved, mutuality among 
peers, the prime adaptive ego quality of love, and the 
core pathology of exclusivity.
The psychosocial crisis of intimacy versus isolation emphasizes 
the evolution of adult sexuality into an interpersonal commit-
ment. This crisis requires that needs for personal gratifi cation 
be subordinated to needs for mutual satisfaction. Success is 
comparatively diffi cult to achieve in our culture because of 
the basic tension between the norm of independence and the 
desire for closeness. The research on marriage suggests that 
willingness to make a personal commitment to another adult 
is one of the key aspects of success. The elaboration of com-
munication skills, the ability to engage in and resolve confl ict, 
and the ability to fi nd time for companionate, leisurely inter-
action are emphasized as central to marital stability.
Objective 7. To analyze divorce as a life stressor in early 
adulthood, including the factors contributing to it and 
the process of coping with it.
The high rate of divorce suggests that many societal, commu-
nity, and interpersonal factors work against the support of stable 
intimate relationships. In the process of coping with divorce, 
there is a clear need for daily problem solving and emotional 
expression to manage the grief, loss, and role transitions that 
accompany the disruption in an intimate relationship.
of disclosure, role compatibility, mutual support, and com-
mitment. These close relationships can take a variety of 
forms, some of which appear to set the stage for long-term 
commitment, and others that seem to be more marginal or 
temporary. A major theme in the establishment and main-
tenance of satisfying intimate relationships is the quality of 
communication and the ability of couples to coordinate their 
interactions, particularly under conditions of confl ict or role 
strain.
Objective 3. To describe the factors associated with 
the decision to have children, the impact of childbearing 
on the intimate relationship, the developing parental 
relationship, and the contribution of childbearing to 
growth in adulthood.
The decision to have children is becoming increasingly 
one of choice rather than obligation. Age at childbearing is 
delayed in line with later age at marriage. At the same time, 
there is an increase in nonmarital childbearing and in vol-
untarily child-free couples. Having children alters the adults’ 
intimate relationship, especially the amount of time parents 
spend with one another when the children are not present. 
Couples differ in the ways they balance their roles as parents 
and intimate partners; some couples grow closer and more 
companionate, whereas others experience new levels of con-
fl ict and declines in marital satisfaction.
Objective 4. To explore the concept of work as 
a stimulus for psychosocial development in early 
adulthood, with special focus on the technical skills, 
authority relations, demands and hazards, and 
interpersonal relations in the work environment.
In the period of occupational training, many new areas of 
intellectual awareness are stimulated. Self-understanding is 
integrated with social expectations and historical opportuni-
ties as men and women embark on their career paths. Four 
components of the work environment must be mastered: 
technical skills, authority relations, interpersonal relations 
with coworkers, and ways of coping with the hazards and 
risks of the workplace. One of the most challenging aspects 
of career development in this early phase is the coordina-
tion of work with the establishment of meaningful intimate 
relationships.

through predictable as well as sudden role transitions. The 
emotional well-being of the society as a whole rests largely 
on the capacity of middle adults to succeed in the develop-
mental tasks of their life stage.

Developmental Tasks
Every adult typically engages in all of the following develop-
mental tasks during middle adulthood: managing a career, 
nurturing an intimate relationship, expanding caring rela-
tionships, and managing the household. Through their roles 
in the family, at work, and in the community, middle adults 
have broad responsibilities for the nurturance, education, 
and care of children, adolescents, young adults, and older 
adults. The strains of middle adulthood result largely from 
diffi culties in balancing many roles and striving to navigate 
MIDDLE ADULTHOOD LASTS from about age 34 to 60. 
According to psychosocial theory, a new reorganization 
of personality occurs during middle adulthood that fo-
cuses on the achievement of a sense of generativity—a 
concern about the well-being of future generations. This 
new stage integrates the skills and perspectives of the 
preceding life stages with a commitment of energy to the 
future. During this period, individual and societal devel-
opments are intimately interwoven. In order for societies 
to thrive and grow, adults must dedicate their energy and 
resources to preserving the quality of life for future gen-
erations. In order for individuals to continue to thrive and 
grow, societies must provide opportunities for adults to 
express and fulfi ll their generative strivings.
Because middle adulthood covers a relatively long pe-
riod, there are opportunities to review and revise one’s 
commitments and goals along the way. People expe-
rience many transitions in their work and family roles 
during this time, encountering a widening circle of rela-
tionships and new responsibilities for the care and guid-
ance of others. Over the course of adulthood, many 
situations call for decisions that have no single correct 
answer. Several alternatives are possible, and adults must 
rely on their ability to gather and evaluate information to 
determine which choice is best for them and their loved 
ones. Flexibility coupled with a good sense of humor 
and creative problem solving emerge in this stage as key 
 coping strategies. ■

to balance work with their other important life roles, espe-
cially those of parent, carer of aging parents, intimate part-
ner, and community member.
The buying power of wages has declined, so that most 
families fi nd it necessary for both partners to work in order 
to meet a reasonable standard of living. The costs of hous-
ing, education, and health care have increased dramatically; 
and the projection of a longer life expectancy has placed 
new pressures on workers to save for a more diverse set of 
needs in retirement. The costs of medical expenses adds to 
the fi nancial worries of many middle adults, both out of con-
cern for their ability to pay for their own immediate fam-
ily’s medical expenses and for their ability to support their 
aging parents, whose health care costs are often not fully 
covered by insurance. All these features of the macrosystem 
in the United States have implications for the way individu-
als orient to the world of work and for the potential confl icts 
between work and family life (Warren, 2003, 2007).
There is reciprocity between work experiences and indi-
vidual growth. We expect that people with certain kinds of 
experiences, abilities, and values will enter certain kinds 
of work roles (Holland, 1997). Once those roles have been 
entered, the work environment and the kinds of activities 
that the person performs also infl uence intellectual, social, 
and value orientation. One’s lifelong occupational career is a 
fl uid structure of changing activities, ambitions, and sources 
of satisfaction. As people move through middle adulthood, 
the management of their occupational career becomes a task 
of central importance to their sense of personal effectiveness, 
identity, and social integration. Four themes in the manage-
ment of a career are discussed for their contribution to adap-
tation and individual development: achieving new levels of 
competence, midlife career changes, balancing work and 
family life, and the impact of joblessness.
the interaction of work and family life; and examining 
the impact of joblessness in middle adulthood.
Work is a major context for adult development. Every per-
son who enters the labor market has an occupational career. 
However, this career may not appear to be orderly or pro-
gressive. It may involve changes in the kind of work per-
formed over time, short- or long-term exit from the labor 
market due to unemployment or family responsibilities, and 
periodic return to school for new training. One can argue 
that as long as a person is involved in an effort to make 
use of skills and talents, there will be significant interac-
tions between the world of work and the person’s individual 
development.
Using the framework of systems theory, one can appreci-
ate that the microsystem of work is embedded in a larger 
societal macrosystem. Each society has an economic orienta-
tion that infl uences policies and practices related to work. 
The climate for the U.S. worker is one that encourages a rela-
tively long work week and few benefi ts. For example, there 
is no law requiring companies to provide paid vacation. In 
comparison to European countries, the labor union structure 
is less powerful in the United States and often cannot protect 
workers from new demands for productivity. According to 
data gathered by the Organization for Economic Coopera-
tion and Development, the average U.S. worker works over 
1,750 hours a year. This is over 250 hours a year more than 
in Italy, Austria, France, or Sweden, but less than in Korea, 
Japan, Mexico, or Poland (OECD, 2010). In 2009, over 5 
million employed workers ages 25 to 54 were working more 
than one job (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010). The 
demands for time commitment on U.S. workers are substan-
tial and result in signifi cant role strain as middle adults strive

CHAPTER 12 Middle Adulthood (34 to 60 Years) 
through the use of fl exible problem-solving strategies. Adap-
tive leadership is required when the organization faces new 
conditions or complex problems that cannot be solved with 
the current use of technologies or techniques. Under these 
conditions, leaders need to help frame new ways of defi ning 
problems, and engaging workers, consumers, or clients in a 
search for solutions (Heifetz, Grashow, & Linsky, 2009).
Some requirements of leadership are perceived differently 
across cultures. For example, in a study comparing full-time, 
white collar workers in China and Australia, participants 
were asked to rate traits that were important for effective 
leadership. The Australians, who expect their leaders to be 
able to work collaboratively with employees, rated friendly 
and respectful traits higher than did the Chinese workers. 
For the Chinese workers, a hierarchical authority structure is 
valued. A person in a leadership position might be perceived 
as weakening authority through friendly interactions with 
subordinates (Casimir & Waldman, 2007).
Other aspects of leadership appear to be universally effec-
tive. Leaders who are described as charismatic or visionary 
are more likely to be rated as highly effective by their subor-
dinates. Charismatic leaders are typically viewed as excep-
tional people who are able to convey a vision by distilling 
complex ideas into a simple message and linking their mes-
sage through symbols, analogies, or stories, to experiences 
that are personally relevant to their followers. Charismatic 
leaders are confi dent and optimistic. They can be seen as idi-
osyncratic or theatrical in their approach, and inspirational 
in their delivery. They are willing to take risks and often sug-
gest a new direction that is a noticeable departure from the 
way the organization has been heading. Charismatic lead-
ers are sensitive to the needs of their members and actively 
monitor and listen to people at all levels of an organization in 
order to retain rapport with their group members and to stay 
attuned to changes in the organizational climate (Conger & 
Kanungo, 1998). Across many types of groups and differ-
ent degrees of organizational complexity, charismatic lead-
ers encourage followers to become deeply committed to the 
organizational mission, to make personal sacrifi ces for this 
mission, and to perform above expectations (Fiol, Harris, & 
House, 1999). They do this in part through their positive and 
encouraging emotional messages and their ability to form 
constructive relationships with workers. Under the guidance 
of this positive leadership, workers are happier, less likely to 
miss work, and more willing to engage in training and devel-
opment activities (Den Hartog, De Hoogh, & Keegan, 2007; 
Campbell, Ward, Sonnenfeld, & Agle, 2008; Erez, Misangyi, 
Johnson, LePine, & Halverson, 2008;  Rowold & Laukamp, 
2009).
The reorganization of many large companies has resulted 
in fewer employees, who are then asked to be more produc-
tive. In this context, leaders need to develop adaptive lead-
ership to accompany their technical expertise. This involves 
communicating a clear view of the challenges, mobiliz-
ing and guiding the direction of innovation, coordinating 
people and projects, and increasing workers’ willingness 
Achieving New Levels of Competence in 
the World of Work
Middle adulthood brings new challenges, a reformulation of 
ambitions and goals, and new levels of competence in the 
workplace. Three areas are emphasized here as they relate 
to the interpersonal and cognitive components of career 
development: understanding and managing leadership and 
authority relationships, expanding interpersonal skills and 
relationships, and achieving new levels of mastery in critical 
skill areas.
Understanding and Managing Leadership and 
Authority. Authority relations encompass all the hierar-
chical relationships that give people decision-making power 
and supervisory responsibility for others. Returning to 
Tiedeman’s model, which was introduced in Chapter 10 
(Later Adolescence), in the induction phase of career develop-
ment one must identify the authority structure operating in 
the work setting and begin to establish one’s position in it. In 
the reformation phase, which typically occurs in middle adult-
hood, advancement in a career inevitably involves taking 
on positions of increased responsibility and power to make 
decisions. Career advancement means assuming author-
ity in some areas, while recognizing the authority of others. 
However, not everyone in a position of authority provides 
effective leadership. A common complaint among workers is 
that their organization lacks leadership, or that their boss or 
supervisor does not provide adequate leadership.
What is leadership? Current organizational theory sug-
gests that leadership is not a quality of personality as much 
as it is a relationship among people. Woyach (1991) defi ned 
leadership as “the process of helping a group shape a vision 
of its purpose and goals and of getting people, both inside 
and outside the group, to commit and recommit themselves 
to accomplishing that vision” (p. 7).
This definition embodies three basic assumptions: (1) 
leadership is a relationship among people, (2) leaders pro-
vide a sense of vision or direction, and (3) leaders motivate 
the group to work toward achieving its vision. Building on 
this view of leadership, Woyach (1991) argued that effective 
leaders try to balance the good of the group with their own 
self-interest. They try to take into account the best interests 
of individuals, groups, and communities, while they also 
participate and lead.
The requirements of leadership may change as the group 
develops, and as the team or organization faces new, emerg-
ing challenges. Groups may go through phases when every-
one is overloaded and distracted. During those times, leaders 
help the group return to its mission and recommit to work-
ing together. At other times, the group members may under-
stand their roles and tasks so clearly that the primary acts of 
leadership involve delegating responsibilities and removing 
obstacles to the group’s success. Effective leadership involves 
the ability to assess the changing needs and challenges faced 
by the team or organization, and to adapt to those changes 

 
Developmental Tasks | 487
Especially during periods of uncertainty and transition, mid-
dle adults who are optimistic, fl exible, open to new ideas, 
and confi dent of their competence can create environments 
where people are able to address their work in a produc-
tive, proactive manner. Through effective leadership, mid-
dle adults convey a vision about the possibilities for their 
organization, and guide others toward the achievement of 
this vision. Success in this enterprise contributes to the sense 
of meaning and mattering, essential elements of subjective 
well-being in adulthood.
Expanding Interpersonal Skills and Relation-
ships. Many occupations place a great deal of emphasis on 
the development and use of interpersonal skills—especially 
the ability to interact well with customers and coworkers and 
the ability to communicate effectively—as underlying criteria 
in the selection and promotion process. The concept of inter-
personal skills is complex and includes at least three compo-
nents: self-presentation, or how a person introduces oneself 
to others and conveys openness to further interactions; social 
scanning, or the ability to read the social cues in the situa-
tion; and social fl exibility, or the ability to respond adaptively 
to the social demands of the situation, for example by being 
assertive or cooperative as the circumstances require (Wu, 
2010). Even if these skills are not mentioned explicitly in the 
job description, success in career management requires the 
ability to infl uence others, appear credible, develop a fl uent 
conversational style, and learn to work effectively in groups 
or teams. Problems in interpersonal relationships can have a 
negative impact on employees, on the image of the organiza-
tion, and on overall productivity.
and readiness for change. Adaptive leadership may involve 
increasing employees’ sense of confi dence in their ability to 
initiate changes, as well as increasing their commitment to 
the organization during a period of uncertainty or transi-
tion (Heifetz, Grashow, & Linsky, 2009; Strauss, Griffi n, & 
 Rafferty, 2009).
The idea that leaders are able to motivate others is explored 
in detail by Rosabeth Moss Kanter (2004) in her analysis 
of how organizations are able to turn a losing streak around. 
Kanter (2004) highlighted the role of leaders in inspiring con-
fi dence. Based on hundreds of interviews and a national survey 
of more than 1,000 companies, Kanter identifi ed strategies that 
successful leaders use to encourage members of their organi-
zation to reach new, higher levels of performance. When lead-
ers believe in the goals of the organization and in the ability 
of people to achieve those goals, people will rise to meet those 
expectations. In inspiring confi dence, leaders set high standards 
and are role models for these standards. They establish systems 
for individual and system accountability. They foster collabora-
tion through mutual respect and effective communication. They 
recognize and encourage initiative, imagination, and innova-
tion. They are able to convince others outside the organization 
to invest in the goals of the organization, which makes their 
success more attainable. Thus, it falls to the leader of a group 
to embrace a vision of success and to build commitment to that 
vision rather than to be caught up in all the many obstacles that 
prevent success.
The focus on leadership highlights the importance of ego 
strengths for middle adults in positions of authority, not only 
for their own personal occupational achievements, but for 
the future of organizations and the well-being of workers.

interpersonal atmosphere, serving as models for others, dem-
onstrating pride in their achievements, providing encourage-
ment for appropriate work-related behavior, and fostering 
respect and trust among coworkers.
Meeting New Skill Demands. The characteristics of the 
occupation and the work setting determine what kinds of 
work-related skills will dominate the adult’s energies. It makes 
sense to expect that the actual tasks a person performs from day 
to day will infl uence intellectual development. The Dictionary of 
Occupational Titles (U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and 
Training Administration, 1993) was updated and converted 
to a Web-based resource called O*NET (www.onetcenter.org), 
which is maintained by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employ-
ment and Training Administration. O*NET describes over 800 
occupational titles and periodically updates each occupation 
with regard to skills, abilities, knowledge, tasks, work activi-
ties, work context, experience levels required, job interests, and 
work values and needs. Each of these dimensions has implica-
tions for workers’ adaptation to their work setting. It is likely 
that in the process of adapting to these dimensions, adults will 
carry over aspects of work-related competence to family and 
community roles.
The idea that social structure influences personality 
through occupational demands was developed in some detail 
by Melvin Kohn (1980, 1999). One of the strongest relation-
ships he identifi ed was between the substantive complexity of 
the job and intellectual fl exibility. Substantive complexity 
is the degree to which the work requires thought, indepen-
dent judgment, and frequent decision making. Those whose 
work is characterized by substantive complexity also tend to 
have relatively low levels of supervision, and their work is 
not overly routinized. As a result of these work conditions, 
they tend to value self-direction, encourage self-direction 
in others—including their children—and show evidence 
of intellectual fl exibility, the ability to handle confl icting 
information, grasp several perspectives on a problem, and 
refl ect on one’s own values and solutions.
This relationship between substantive complexity at work 
and personal intellectual fl exibility was found among workers 
in the United States, Poland, and Japan (Kohn, 2006). In the 
cross-national comparison, U.S. workers whose jobs were char-
acterized as substantively complex also had greater personal sat-
isfaction and a sense of well-being, whereas those whose work 
was highly routinized and supervised had a lower sense of well-
being. In contrast, in Poland, when these data were collected 
in 1978, the workers who had the more substantively complex 
work were also more distressed. The workers at the more routi-
nized jobs were more confi dent of job security and less threat-
ened by instability. Therefore, although the Polish workers at the 
routinized jobs had the least self-direction of all the three coun-
tries, they felt a high sense of satisfaction about their current and 
future employment. However, the managers, whose jobs were 
more substantively complex, were also at greater risk. They were 
held accountable for productivity with little opportunity to infl u-
ence rewards or working conditions.
An essential feature of many work environments is the 
ability to work in teams or groups. Teams that work well 
together are able to maintain positive social relationships 
among the members as they work to complete their group’s 
tasks, all the while supporting the personal and professional 
development of team members. Eight features of effective 
teams, many of which refl ect the importance of interpersonal 
skills and relationships, have been identifi ed in the literature 
(Marquardt, Seng, & Goodson, 2010):
Clear and meaningful goals
Clearly stated expectations for positive interpersonal 
behavior
Strong interpersonal and communication skills
Competence and commitment to solving problems and 
performing tasks
Trust, openness, and group cohesiveness
The ability to manage confl ict to preserve positive relation-
ships among members
Shared leadership
Continuous individual and team commitment to learning 
and improvement
When individuals work in teams, especially when there is 
frequent interaction, there is a tendency toward social com-
parison. One may learn that a colleague has made a lot of 
sales, received recognition for an accomplishment, or solved 
an important work-related problem. This might be viewed as 
an upward comparison—a person believes that the colleague 
performed better than others. In contrast, one may learn that 
a colleague made a lot of errors, worked too slowly, or failed 
to make a sales quota. This might be viewed as a downward 
comparison—a person believes that the colleague performed 
worse than others. This type of social comparison is an ongo-
ing aspect of the interpersonal environment at work, with 
some people being more likely to base their self-evaluation 
on comparisons with others (Buunk et al., 2005).
Thinking about reactions to social comparisons, one could 
observe that others are doing better than oneself and be 
happy for them, or one could be jealous or envious of others’ 
success. One could observe that others are doing worse than 
oneself and be relieved or proud that one is doing so well, 
or one could feel bad about others’ failures. In a cooperative 
work environment, people view the fate of their colleagues as 
directly affecting each member of the team. In such a setting, 
one can imagine a positive interpersonal dynamic, where 
people feel proud of those who are doing better than they 
are and are encouraged to seek out these high performers to 
learn from. People who feel bad when others are not doing 
as well as they are may be willing to help them raise their 
skills or improve their performance.
In middle adulthood, those in leadership positions have 
an opportunity to foster a cooperative or competitive work 
climate, and to manage the process of social comparison in 
the interest of productivity or effectiveness. Even if they are 
not in positions of authority as more senior workers, those 
in middle adulthood are often in a position to infl uence the

life. Recall from the discussion of work in Chapter 11 (Early 
Adulthood) that between the ages of 18 and 32, the average 
number of jobs held was 10.3. Although the rate of job turn-
over slows down after age 30, people still need to remain 
flexible about their attachment to a specific job. Descrip-
tions of the changing nature of organizations suggest that 
the segment of workers employed full-time by corporations 
is a shrinking percentage of working-age adults. As today’s 
 working-age labor force moves through middle adulthood, 
from 34 to 60, the nature of the labor market is also chang-
ing to a more decentralized, fee-for-services model. This 
requires individuals to create what has been described as a 
portfolio approach to their career—developing a document 
that is more detailed and three-dimensional than a resume; 
one that highlights one’s products, skills, talents, and experi-
ences (Handy, 1996). The portfolio approach assumes that 
people need to market themselves, whether in hopes of 
advancement within a company, or as they seek new employ-
ment opportunities. People who change jobs relatively often 
or who work as consultants and project managers can take 
this approach in order to convey the range of skills they have 
developed, and the diverse products or activities in which 
they have played a major role.
Work activities or work-related goals may change for 
at least fi ve reasons during middle adulthood. First, some 
careers end during middle adulthood. One example is the 
career of the professional athlete, whose strength, speed of 
reaction time, and endurance decline to the point where the 
athlete can no longer compete.
Second, some adults cannot resolve conflicts between 
job demands and personal goals. Some workers recognize 
that the kinds of contributions they thought they could 
make in the workplace are simply not possible within their 
One of the most frequently cited areas of skill develop-
ment in the contemporary labor market is creative problem 
solving. The combination of increasingly complex technology, 
instant international communication, and continuing reor-
ganization of the network of interrelated businesses results 
in the emergence of a new and changing array of problems. 
These problems may relate to the need to recruit and train 
the workforce, bring together changing teams of workers 
depending on the task, fi nd new strategies for the manufac-
ture and delivery of products, or integrate technologies. The 
concept of managerial resourcefulness is sometimes used 
to capture the nature of this problem solving. Managerial 
resourcefulness combines three critical features: a cognitive 
capacity to gather and analyze information, sensitivity to the 
emotional and motivational aspects of change, and a readi-
ness to take appropriate actions (Kanungo & Misra, 1992; 
Kanungo & Menon, 2004).
By middle adulthood, individuals have accumulated a 
deep knowledge of the specific tasks and routines associ-
ated with their work. At the same time, they have either 
tried or observed a variety of problem-solving strategies. 
Thus, the challenge for the middle adult worker is to syn-
thesize these two bodies of knowledge to create a flexible 
approach to emerging problems. Successful development 
in this area requires recognizing when conditions have 
changed such that past solutions will not be adequate. 
At the same time, it requires confidence in one’s ability 
to find new solutions and remain creative under stressful 
conditions.

of a period of unemployment or reduced income. There is 
less opportunity to consider the impact of the transition on 
family members. The person who is making an involuntary 
transition may feel compelled to take a position in order to 
support the family or to meet existing fi nancial obligations 
even if the position is not a very good fi t with personal val-
ues or goals (Fouad & Bynner, 2008).
The Impact of Joblessness
Even though the workplace can be a major source of stress, 
joblessness can be even more disruptive to personal men-
tal health and family functioning. As a result of the restruc-
turing of the labor market, plant closings, downturns in the 
e- conomy, and workforce reorganizations, many workers 
who had a history of steady employment, including increased 
responsibility and advancement, have recently faced job loss 
in their middle adulthood. Unemployment in middle adult-
hood has a major psychological impact on an individual’s 
sense of self-worth and hope for the future. Among middle-
aged workers, job loss is associated with material deprivation, 
disruption in family life, and increases in marital conflict. 
Children and spouses are commonly acutely involved in 
the effects of job loss on a middle-aged parent, and often 
the entire family experiences new feelings of alienation from 
social institutions as a result of the experience (Lobo & 
 Watkins, 1995; Perrucci, Perrucci, & Targ, 1997).
Job loss has been associated with both physical health 
and mental health consequences, such as self-doubt, pas-
sivity, and social withdrawal. Depression is a common 
consequence, and the associated family strains may also 
lead to new levels of conflict and family violence. In some 
instances, adjustments that families make to a husband’s 
unemployment result in a further reduction of his sense 
of importance and accentuate the decline in his self-
respect. Social support—especially family strengths and 
marital satisfaction—are important buffers for the nega-
tive effects of unemployment (Blustein, 2008; Bambra, 
2010).
In 2004, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.4%, slightly 
higher for men than for women. The modal period of unem-
ployment was less than 5 weeks, but about 22% were unem-
ployed for 27 weeks or more. By the end of 2009, the rate 
was 10%, and 40% of those who were unemployed, or 
6.1 million people, had been jobless 27 weeks or more. 
Table 12.1 summarizes the unemployment rates in 2009 
by race and educational attainment for individuals from 25 
years old and older. Those with less education were at espe-
cially high risk for unemployment during this diffi cult eco-
nomic period (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010).
There is a difference in how people cope with seasonal or 
short-term (less than 5 weeks) unemployment and chronic 
unemployment. Because of the cultural emphasis on pro-
ductive work, people are especially likely to experience guilt 
about being unemployed. Moreover, for men, unemploy-
ment disrupts the self-concept of the traditional defi nition 
of the adult male role as breadwinner for the family. As a 
chosen work structure. Others feel like outsiders within their 
corporations:
Trish Millines Dziko didn’t discover her affi nity for comput-
ers until she attended college on a basketball scholarship. 
Later, while she was rising through the mostly White, male 
ranks at Microsoft, she felt uncomfortable being one of the 
few African Americans in Redmond. At age 39, she retired 
as one of many Microsoft millionaires and used $100,000 of 
her kitty to establish the Technology Access Foundation, de-
signed to bring more kids of color into the game.…“I want 
to change the dynamics of the [corporation] club,” says 
Dziko, “by changing the demographics.” (Schultz, 2001, 
pp. 68–69)
A third explanation for midlife career change is the realiza-
tion that one has succeeded as much as possible in a given 
career. Adults may realize that they will not be promoted 
further or that changing technology has made their exper-
tise obsolete. Consequently, they may decide to retrain for 
new kinds of work or return to school to move in new career 
directions. In 2004 to 2005, roughly one third of middle 
adult workers were enrolled in work-related courses to gain 
new skills (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010).
Fourth, family transitions may prompt career changes. 
In some instances, adults leave the labor market or move to 
part-time work in order to care for their children or their 
aging parents. In other cases, adults enter the labor mar-
ket following divorce or widowhood. According to a U.S. 
Department of Commerce report (Dalirazar, 2007), over 
6 million adults ages 24 to 44 said they were not working 
because they were taking care of children or others.
Fifth, with the restructuring of the workforce, some 
workers are laid off and cannot be rehired in the same fi eld. 
They have to retrain for a new line of work or for similar 
work in a new industry. Other workers may remain with 
the same company but find that they are being asked 
to perform new tasks that require a new set of skills and 
responsibilities.
One must be cautious not to idealize midlife career 
change. It is not uncommon to experience a variety of fears 
or worries about leaving one occupation and starting some-
thing new: fear of making an unfavorable discovery about 
one’s abilities as a result of the change; fear of failing to sat-
isfy the expectations of important others; fear of taking on 
new responsibilities; and fear of giving up a known present 
for an unknown future (Patterson, 1997).
The ease or difficulty of work transitions depends in 
part on the extent to which workers perceive that they have 
control over the conditions of the change. Voluntary tran-
sitions usually occur with some control over the timing of 
the change, and the opportunity to prepare both fi nancially 
and with the acquisition of required skills. What is more, in 
the case of voluntary work transitions, the person has the 
sense of agency about making decisions that advance desired 
goals. Involuntary transitions often occur with little chance 
to select the optimal time or to save up for the possibility

supporting well-being. At its best, work provides resources 
for survival, creates a context for social relatedness, and 
offers opportunities for self-determination. As such, involun-
tary long-term or chronic unemployment or underemploy-
ment can undermine a middle adult’s sense of mattering, and 
establish conditions for alienation or self-loathing (Blustein, 
2008; Garrett-Peters, 2009).
Balancing Work and Family Life
Almost everyone manages a career while juggling commit-
ments to spouse, children, parents, other household members, 
and friends. A decision to assume more authority, work longer 
hours, accept an offer with another company, quit a job, accept 
a transfer to a new location, or start up one’s own business will 
touch the lives of other household and family members.
In thinking about balancing work and family life, it is 
useful to consider three interrelated concepts: role overload, 
role confl ict, and role spillover. Role overload occurs as a 
result of too many demands and expectations to handle in 
the time allowed. For example, a parent with three children 
ages 8, 11, and 15 may fi nd that the demands of getting the 
result of guilt, shame, and anger, men may fi nd it hard to 
direct their energy toward creative solutions to life problems. 
Thus, the inability to work can be expected to become a seri-
ous hurdle to the resolution of the psychosocial confl ict of 
generativity versus stagnation for men (Hopper, 1990). In a 
comparison of men and women who had both breadwinner 
and childrearing responsibilities, the men were more likely 
to view unemployment as a defeat, whereas the women 
were more likely to view unemployment as an opportunity 
( Forret, Sullivan, & Mainiero, 2010).
The threats of job loss and job insecurity can create stress 
for those who remain employed as well as for those who 
become unemployed. For example, in a study of employ-
ment conditions on job-related distress, workers in indus-
tries that were experiencing high levels of unemployment 
had a higher incidence of depression than did workers in 
industries where unemployment was low. Similarly, studies 
have shown that workers who are spared during downsizing 
and mergers show signs of anxiety and depression.
These observations highlight the salience that work has in 
middle adulthood and the role that meaningful work plays in

cohort who were long-time homemakers (McMunn, Bartley, 
Hardy, & Kuh, 2006).
The domains of work and family, both central to adult 
lives across cultures, are likely to conflict under certain 
circumstances and complement each other in other cir-
cumstances. In order to understand the nature of this rela-
tionship, researchers have identifi ed the elements of work 
and the elements of family life that appear to be most central 
to this confl ict. A model of how job characteristics and fam-
ily characteristics might contribute to work-family confl ict 
and family-work confl ict is presented in Figure 12.1.
The basic assumption is that there are role pressures 
from work and family that are mutually incompatible, so 
that meeting the expectations in one domain makes it very 
diffi cult to meet expectations in the other. Moreover, there 
may be interactions such that confl icts from work make it 
difficult to meet role expectations in the family, but then 
the disruptions in the family make it diffi cult to meet role 
expectations at work (Frone, 2003). Despite these tensions 
between work and family obligations, people strive to fi nd 
ways for the two roles to work together (work-family fi t), 
which leads to greater job satisfaction. Job flexibility, for 
example, a workplace policy that supports taking hours off 
to carry out family-related responsibilities, is viewed as a 
factor that can contribute to this successful adaptation.
In a study of the interface between work and family roles, 
the model presented in Figure 12.1 was tested in 48 countries 
(Hill, Yang, Hawkins, & Ferris, 2004). The characteristics of 
children ready for school, attending functions at three dif-
ferent schools, picking children up and dropping them off 
at various places, and trying to be emotionally available for 
the problem of the day are exhausting. Role overload can be 
experienced in one or more adult roles.
Role confl ict occurs when demands and expectations of 
various roles confl ict with each other. For example, role con-
fl ict occurs when a worker is expected to stay late at the job 
to fi nish a project, but that same night is a spouse’s birthday 
or a child’s performance.
Role spillover occurs when the demands or preoccupa-
tions about one role interfere with the ability to carry out 
another role. For example, a person may be disrupted at 
work by worries about an ill parent or distracted at home by 
a work assignment that is due the next day.
The combination of role overload, role confl ict, and role 
spillover can lead to reduced satisfaction at work and in fam-
ily roles, and a decline in the person’s sense of well-being 
(Kinnunen, Feldt, Mauno, & Rantanen, 2010). In contrast, 
multiple role involvement has also been shown to contribute 
to health and well-being. Spousal support for the partner’s 
involvement in work can increase work satisfaction, and feel-
ings of success and pride in one’s accomplishments at work 
can contribute to marital satisfaction (Dreman, 1997). In a 
large, longitudinal study of British women born in 1946, 
those women who had participated in multiple work and 
family roles over the course of their adulthood were found 
to be healthier at age 54 than women from the same birth

very exciting beginning in trying to understand the dynam-
ics of work-family interactions at a global level.
This cross-national study also adds to a growing literature 
documenting that women are more distressed by family-
work confl ict than are men, possibly because responsibilities 
for household and child care continue to rest more on the 
shoulders of employed women than on those of employed 
men (Voydanoff, 2004). Nonetheless, trends in the United 
States are moving toward a more egalitarian model. Men and 
women increasingly agree on the value of having women 
in the labor market and the importance of family-friendly 
workplace policies. Employed men are spending an increas-
ing amount of time on household and child care tasks, both 
on workdays and nonworkdays.
Between 1977 and 2002, the gap between the amount of 
time women and men spent on household tasks decreased 
from 3 hours to 1 hour on nonworkdays and from 2.5 hours 
to 1 hour on workdays. As men spend more time on child 
care tasks, the result is that children actually have more time 
with a parent than they did in 1977 (Barnett, 2004).
Balancing work and family life is challenging; it involves 
the interface of multiple, interacting systems—each partner’s 
work environment, each partner’s role demands within the 
family, and the partners’ relationships with one another and 
with their children. For example, one study found that for 
professional couples with children, when husbands were 
required to work long hours at their job, the probability of 
the wife quitting her job increased (Cha, 2010). Another 
study demonstrated the impact of workload on parents 
and their children. When mothers worked long hours and 
felt overloaded, they were less warm and accepting toward 
their adolescent children. When fathers worked long hours 
a job that were hypothesized to produce work-family confl ict 
were job responsibility, job workload, and job travel. The 
characteristics of the family that were hypothesized to pro-
duce family-work confl ict were responsibility for children, 
responsibility for elders, and being married. The model was 
tested by analyzing survey responses of more than 25,000 
IBM workers, whose average age was 39. The countries were 
divided into 11 Eastern countries with a collectivist orien-
tation, and 3 groups of countries with a more individualist 
orientation: Western developing countries, Western affl uent 
countries, and the United States.
The results of this study showed that the model was a 
good fi t for all four groups of countries. The three job char-
acteristics were signifi cantly related to work-family confl ict 
across all 48 countries, although the strength of the relation-
ship was greater in the three individualist groups of coun-
tries. Responsibility for children and elders was related to 
family-work confl ict across all the countries, but this rela-
tionship was stronger for women than for men. Contrary 
to expectations, marriage was related to less family-work 
confl ict across all the countries. Job fl exibility was associ-
ated with less work-family conflict in the Eastern coun-
tries and the Western developing countries, but not in the 
Western affl uent countries or the United States. Across all 
the countries, work was much more likely to create con-
fl ict in family life than family life was to be disruptive for 
work. The general model was a good predictor of job satis-
faction across these very different work environments. One 
might ask whether the global corporate environment of IBM 
might have smoothed out some of the cultural variations that 
would have been observed had workers been drawn from 
a greater diversity of businesses. However, this research is a

CHAPTER 12 Middle Adulthood (34 to 60 Years) 
Nurturing an Intimate Relationship
Objective 2. To examine the process of maintaining a 
vital, intimate relationship in middle adulthood, especially 
a commitment to growth, effective communication, 
creative use of confl ict, and preserving passion.  
Although people derive a signifi cant sense of personal iden-
tity from their jobs and may worry a lot about them, hap-
piness in an intimate relationship is a stronger predictor 
of overall well-being in adulthood than is satisfaction with 
work. According to a survey conducted by the AARP (Ameri-
can Association of Retired Persons, 2010), over 90% of men 
and 86% of women in middle adulthood reported that hav-
ing a good relationship with a spouse or partner was very 
important to their quality of life. Marriage and other long-
term intimate bonds are salient, dynamic relationships. They 
change as the partners mature, as the family constellation 
changes, and in response to changing events, including fam-
ily crises and historical events. Focus and effort are required 
to keep these relationships healthy and vital throughout 
middle adulthood.
What is a vital marriage? Drawing on a variety of studies 
of long-lasting marriages, four themes have been identifi ed as 
contributing to long-lasting, happy marriages: the characteris-
tics of the individual partners, the nature of the partners’ inter-
personal interactions, the partners’ commitment to nurturing 
the future of the relationship, and the preservation of passion 
in the relationship (Crooks & Bauer, 2005).
Characteristics of the Partners
Happy marriages are built on love and affection between 
two people who are basically even tempered and warm 
hearted (Huston & Melz, 2004). They are not overly anx-
ious, depressed, or impulsive. They are nurturing, expres-
sive, gentle, understanding, and conscientious. They care 
about each other, rather than being self-absorbed or indif-
ferent to one another’s fate. These individuals also contribute 
other types of social capital that help sustain the relation-
ship. For example, they may have a supportive network of 
family members and friends, they may contribute fi nancial 
resources to the family, they are cooperative rather than 
domineering in the way they participate in decision making, 
or they bring unique competencies to the tasks of household 
maintenance (Edin, 2000).
Partners’ Interpersonal Interactions
The couple must develop an effective communication sys-
tem. This requires adequate opportunities for interaction. If 
competing life roles, including work and parenting, dramati-
cally reduce opportunities for interaction, the couple will risk 
drifting apart. They will have increasingly fewer shared expe-
riences and be less readily infl uenced by each other’s obser-
vations and reactions. Studies of the correlates of marital 
and felt overloaded, they experienced more conflict with 
their adolescent children. Husbands’ negative work-related 
stressors also increased their wives’ sense of overload 
beyond what the wives were experiencing because of their 
own work situation (Crouter & Bumpus, 2001). Thus, for 
wives, balancing work and family life required coping with 
their  husband’s experiences of work-related strain as well as 
their own. 
The ability to bring positive energy from work to family 
and vice versa is a product of individual and workplace char-
acteristics. Taking the individual perspective, Ellen Galinsky 
(2007) has coined the term dual-centric to describe people 
who put the same emphasis and priority on their work and 
their personal lives. These people are equally likely to be men 
and women. They are more likely to have children at home, 
and they spend an average of about 5 hours a week more 
at home than those who place a higher priority on work 
than on their personal lives. These dual-centric individuals 
feel more successful at work and at home, and by objec-
tive measures such as their level in the organization or their 
salary, feel equally successful as those who place a greater 
priority on their work. In comparison to those who place a 
higher priority on either their work or their personal lives, 
fewer dual-centric people experience moderate or high lev-
els of stress, and fewer say that they fi nd it diffi cult to man-
age their multiple roles. In interviews with these dual-centric 
adults, Galinsky found that they were very clear and inten-
tional about having both domains as priorities in their lives, 
they set some clear boundaries between the domains, they 
practiced being emotionally as well as physically present in 
the sphere where they were functioning at the time, and they 
took time to rest or redirect their energy away from work 
from time to time.
Although much of the responsibility for managing multi-
ple roles falls to individuals, work-family facilitation is also 
supported by resources in the workplace that make it easier 
for employees to address pressing family demands within 
the scope of their daily work (Voydanoff, 2004). When the 
workplace is organized to recognize and sustain the multiple 
role responsibilities of employees, people are likely to expe-
rience an increase in their sense of self-worth, competence, 
and fulfi llment, resulting in a more positive outlook on their 
interpersonal relationships at home and greater productiv-
ity at work. For example, policies that allow workers to take 
family-related leaves without risking their job security, or to 
take time off during the day to take a child to the doctor 
or meet with a teacher, reduce work-family confl ict. A sup-
portive work climate in which supervisors help workers feel 
comfortable about using these family-fl exible policies and 
accommodating signifi cant family obligations contribute to 
work-family facilitation. Given that most people in middle 
adulthood are expected to be functioning in multiple roles, 
it makes sense that the responsibility for success in achiev-
ing an effective balance between work and family demands 
should rest not only on the coping strategies of individuals 
but on the policies and climate of the work setting.

marriage as a more temporary alliance than as a lifelong rela-
tionship. Assuming that couples share this view of their rela-
tionship as long term, the partners must learn to work toward 
change in areas where it is possible, and to accept one another 
and the characteristics of the relationship in areas where 
change cannot be accomplished. By expanding their tolerance 
for differences and admiration for their strengths, couples can 
achieve new levels of intimacy. Research by Wallerstein and 
Blakeslee (1995) on long- lasting, satisfying marriages identifi ed 
a set of psychosocial tasks that couples have to master. Salient 
in this list are the following challenges:
• Preserving a balance between intimacy in the couple and 
autonomy for the individuals
• Expanding the bonds of affection to include children 
while preserving and nurturing the couple relationship
• Shifting the focus of energy from the family of origin to 
the newly formed family while preserving relationships 
with the extended kinship network
happiness fi nd that there is a reciprocal relationship between 
interaction and happiness. In a longitudinal study, couples 
who were happier early in their marriage showed higher lev-
els of interaction in later years (Zuo, 1992). After a number 
of years of marriage, the two variables were strong predic-
tors of each other: Those who were happy were involved in 
more frequent interactions, and, similarly, those who were 
involved in frequent interactions were happier.
John Gottman and his colleagues have conducted a number 
of studies to examine the nature of interactions among heter-
osexual married couples. Their technique involves videotap-
ing couples as they discuss a diffi cult issue in their marriage. 
At the same time, they gather physiological data, including 
changes in heart rate and blood pressure. The couples are fol-
lowed in later years of their marriage using surveys and inter-
views. Based on their research, they have been able to predict 
with a high degree of accuracy whether couples will separate 
in the fi rst few years of their marriage or stay together (Gott-
man, Coan, Carrere, & Swanson, 1998; Gottman & Silver, 
2000; Driver, Tabares, Shapiro, Nahm, & Gottman, 2003).
Gottman found that enduring relationships are charac-
terized by a high ratio of positive to negative interactions. 
Couples in satisfi ed marriages did argue, but the balance of 
five positive statements to one negative statement was an 
important constant in predicting relationship stability. In sta-
ble, satisfi ed heterosexual couples, the woman tends to use a 
gentle, diplomatic beginning when she introduces a problem 
or concern, and the man accepts his wife’s infl uence. When 
the woman expresses contempt, is overly negative, or aggres-
sive, and the man is overly domineering or defensive in the 
face of confl ict, the relationship is less likely to endure.
For couples that do not have an effective communication 
system, resentments tend to accumulate with no opportunity 
to resolve them. A common pattern is that the wife wants to 
talk things over, but the husband does not see what good 
this will do. Harmonious, satisfi ed couples listen to and con-
sider each other’s problems. They validate each other’s con-
cerns by expressing understanding, even if they cannot offer 
solutions. Dissatisfied couples, on the other hand, avoid 
problems or engage in counterattack. Instead of validating 
the spouse’s concern, the partner raises complaints and criti-
cisms, or withdraws. Over the years, expressions of affection, 
enjoyment, laughter, and support decline. Even if negative or 
critical interactions do not increase, they are embedded in a 
less positive overall context. The ideal 5 to 1 ratio may drop 
to 3 or 2 to 1, making the negative interactions more salient. 
This takes the couple along the path to marital disruption.
Partners’ Commitment to Nurturing the 
Future of the Relationship
In order for a marriage to last over the long period of middle 
and later adulthood, the partners have to see a long-term com-
mitment as one of their values. Research on cohabitation and 
research on marriage stability among children whose parents 
divorced both illustrate contexts in which adults may view 
Omar and Vidya have been married for ten years, and they have 
two young children. He works as a fi eld agent for the gas company. 
She works from home as a copywriter for a catalog company. This 
allows her to devote time and attention to caring for the children 
and managing the household. They are still deeply in love and de-
light in sharing a few moments to cuddle and laugh together.

 2. What are the obstacles to continued growth for Annette in 
this case?
 3. How might childrearing responsibilities prevent new

 4. How does Annette’s decision lead to new opportunities for 
growth for Gary and her children?

sidered that could have satisfi ed her needs for continued 
growth and perhaps been less disruptive for her family?
 6. Imagine that Gary had been the one looking for a new 
structure—perhaps going into business for himself or go-
ing back to school for a new profession. What types of 
changes might this have caused in the family system? On 
the marital relationship?
Preserving Passion in a Long-Term 
Relationship
According to Sternberg’s three-dimensional model of love 
presented in Chapter 11, passion is the first thing to go. 
However, preserving an erotic and sexual aspect to intimacy 
continues to play a role in fostering long-term intimate rela-
tionships throughout adulthood. Relationship satisfaction 
is associated with openness about sexual needs, satisfaction 
with sexual frequency, and experiencing a playful enjoyment 
of sexual pleasure (Crooks & Bauer, 2005). This means cop-
ing with the physiological changes in sexual responsiveness 
that accompany aging and fi nding new ways to enjoy sexual 
contact in the context of parenting demands, chronic illness 
or disability, or other stressful life events that interfere with 
one’s sexual interest. Results of a recent AARP survey found 
that having a satisfying sexual relationship was somewhat 
more important to men than to women in middle adulthood. 
However, for both men and women, those who had a satisfy-
ing sexual relationship had higher life satisfaction than those 
who did not (AARP, 2010).
Changes in sexual responsiveness over the middle adult 
years have been well documented (Masters & Johnson, 
1966; Crooks & Bauer, 2005). For men, erections take 
longer to develop, orgasm is less intense, and the erec-
tion fades more quickly in midlife than in early adulthood. 
With age, it may take a longer period, from several hours to 
days, to experience a new erection. Even though the sexual 
response changes, orgasm continues to be a source of plea-
sure. Although there is a reduction in sperm production, 
most men remain fertile well into very old age. Most men are 
able to enjoy sexual activity throughout their life, provided 
that they continue to have a partner.
• Managing the adversities in life, such as serious illness, 
death, or disaster, in ways that strengthen the relationship
• Sharing laughter and delight in daily life
The partners must be committed to growth both as indi-
viduals and as a couple. This means that they accept the idea 
that they will change in important ways and that the relation-
ship, too, will change. Within any enduring relationship, each 
person experiences a dynamic tension between pressures and 
desires for personal growth on the one hand and the pressures 
and desires to preserve the relationship on the other hand. 
Both of these forces have the potential to overwhelm or domi-
nate the sense of mutuality, as is illustrated in the case study 
on the struggle for commitment to growth in a vital marriage. 
A vital marriage requires both partners to be open to the need 
to be themselves (as they continue to discover new dimen-
sions of self) and an energizing, interpersonal chemistry that 
is resilient even in the face of the harshest challenges.
CASE STUDY
THE STRUGGLE FOR COMMITMENT TO 
GROWTH IN A VITAL MARRIAGE
One common example of the need to permit individual 
growth within a marriage occurs when a woman who has 
been primarily responsible for child care and household man-
agement expresses an interest in entering or returning to the 
paid labor force.
Annette, who had worked as a nurse before she married, de-
cided that it was time to go back to work. Her three children 
were in elementary and middle school, and her husband had 
a full-time job, so she was by herself for long hours during the 
day. She began to feel depressed and jealous of everyone 
else’s active lives, so she took a position at a local hospital, 
working three afternoons and on Saturday each week.
At fi rst, her husband, Gary, fussed and resisted. “Why 
did she need to go to work?” he asked. They didn’t really 
need the money, and Gary liked to know that she would be 
at home when he came back from work. He wasn’t used to 
having to take the kids to their activities after school. Plus, 
Saturday used to be his day to hang out with his friends from 
work. The kids fussed at being asked to get dinner ready. 
But Annette insisted that she had to get back to work—her 
mental health and happiness depended on it.
The fi rst months were terrible. Annette wondered if she 
were doing the right thing, and Gary used every trick in the 
book to lure her back to the house. But there was no deny-
ing the value of this new job for Annette’s self-confi dence, 
her renewed feeling of personal identity, and her ability to 
return to the home with new energy and enthusiasm for her 
husband, children, and family life. Gary began to get more 
involved in the children’s lives and actually looked forward to 
the Saturdays they spent together. Soon the children began 
to see their mother in a new light, as a professional who took

intercourse and reduced sensitivity, which interfere with 
sexual pleasure. Although the number of orgasmic contrac-
tions may be fewer, orgasm remains a very important and 
pleasurable experience for postmenopausal women. With-
out the risk of pregnancy, many women are more enthusi-
astic about sexual relations after menopause than they were 
before. As discussed in the box on menopause, the impact of 
menopause for women is determined in part by its cultural 
meaning. As with other aspects of an intimate relationship, 
preserving the sexual dimension requires good communica-
tion and a sense of humor.
Nurturing vitality in an intimate relationship through-
out adulthood is a long-term challenge. The partners must 
strive to create continued interest, nurturance, and apprecia-
tion for each other even after they have achieved high levels 
of security, trust, and empathy, so that the components of a 
loving relationship operate continuously in the relationship. 
At the same time, they have to encourage and support one 
another’s continuing growth as individuals. The signifi cance 
of this task is relevant for the ongoing nature of the relation-
ship and the social support it provides as the couple enters 
later life. The quality of the parents’ marital relationship dur-
ing middle adulthood has signifi cant consequences for the 
well-being of children in the family and provides the con-
text for the children’s emerging understanding of intimacy 
and marital roles. As children mature into middle childhood 
and early adolescence, they pay attention to and try to make 
sense of the quality of their parents’ interactions with each 
other. As children observe their parents, they acquire a sense 
of how they function as intimate partners as well as parents. 
Of course, children will not perfectly replicate their par-
ents’ marriages. However, the degree of egalitarianism, the 
approach to confl ict resolution, and the expression of affec-
tion that children observe can infl uence their ideas about the 
kind of partner they seek, their ability to manage confl ict in 
an intimate relationship, and their expectations about mari-
tal interaction (Schulz, Pruett, Kerig, & Parke, 2010).
Expanding Caring Relationships
Objective 3. To describe the expansion of caring in 
middle adulthood as it applies to two specifi c roles—that 
of a parent and that of an adult child caring for one’s 
aging parents.
Middle adults have opportunities to express caring in many 
roles. This section focuses on two of those: parenting, and 
the care of one’s own aging parents. Both domains offer 
numerous challenges to the intellectual, emotional, and 
physical resources of the adult caregiver.
Parenting
In parenting, we see the critical intersection of adult development 
and child development. As parents, adults bring a psychosocial 
For some men, periods of illness, certain medications, 
heart disease, or high blood pressure can interfere with the 
ability to have an erection. Anxiety about being able to have 
an erection or a preoccupation with the quality of sexual per-
formance may interfere with the ability to become aroused. 
The introduction of a variety of new drugs to treat erectile 
disorders has increased openness and awareness of this 
problem and provided new avenues for couples to discuss 
changes in their sexual vitality. One study estimated that 
30 million men in the United States have erectile disorder 
(Levine, 2003). Although the incidence increases with age, 
usually it is not age itself but the chronic illnesses that are 
associated with aging and the accompanying medications 
that account for this relationship.
One of the common changes experienced by men in 
midlife is inflammation or increased size of the prostate 
gland. This gland produces fl uids that are released during 
ejaculation. When the prostate becomes enlarged, it may 
put pressure on the urethra and restrict the fl ow of urine. 
A significant number of men experience prostate cancer. 
Although treatments for prostate cancer vary, they can inter-
fere with sexual functioning (Ofman, 2004).
Physical changes that affect the sexual response also occur 
for women. At some time during their late forties or in their 
fi fties, women experience the climacteric, or the involution 
and atrophy of the reproductive organs. Many physiological 
changes accompany the close of fertility, including the cessa-
tion of menstruation (menopause), gradual reduction in the 
production of estrogen, atrophy of the breasts and genital tis-
sues, and shrinkage of the uterus (Carroll, 2010). The most 
commonly reported symptom is a frequent hot fl ash, a sud-
den onset of warmth in the face and neck that lasts several 
minutes. Sometimes it is accompanied by dizziness, nausea, 
sweating, or headaches. About 75% to 85% of women going 
through natural menopause report this symptom. Other 
physiological symptoms are related to the reduction of vagi-
nal fl uid and loss of elasticity, sleeplessness, and increased 
anxiety (Nelson, 2008). The symptoms appear to be closely 
related to a drastic drop in the production of estrogen. Post-
menopausal women produce only one sixth as much estro-
gen as do women who regularly menstruate.
Several studies on the use of estrogen treatment have 
found that the administration of this hormone to menopausal 
women alleviates or even prevents menopausal symptoms. 
Results of research from the Women’s Health Initiative found 
a relationship of hormone replacement therapy to decreased 
risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal 
and lung cancers, but an increased risk of breast cancer. As 
a result, many physicians have stopped prescribing hormone 
replacement therapy, and have begun to seek alternative 
therapies to help reduce severe symptoms of menopause for 
those women who experience them (Beck, 2008).
The reduction in estrogen is associated with changes 
in the sexual response cycle. The most noticeable change 
is decreased lubrication and less expansion of the vagina 
during the excitement phase. This can cause pain during

stress. It also provides a context of reassurance for children 
who observe the way their parents encourage and sustain 
each other (Hughes, Gordon, & Gaertner, 2004; McHale, 
Kuersten-Hogan, & Rao, 2004).
Being a parent is a diffi cult, demanding task that requires a 
great deal of learning. Because children are constantly chang-
ing and are often unpredictable, adults must be sensitive and 
fl exible in new situations in order to cope successfully with 
their demands. Each period of the child’s development calls 
for new and innovative parenting strategies. Childrearing 
experiences are different with each child, and the changing 
family constellation brings new demands for fl exibility and 
learning. With each successive child, however, there seems 
to be less anxiety about parenting skills. Children help adults 
learn about parenting through their responses to their par-
ents’ efforts and their own persistence in following the path 
of development.
Fathering
In the history of the fi eld of family science, the research on 
parenting has focused almost exclusively on mothers. Most 
research involved interviews or surveys of mothers, and even 
when the study used the term parent, the informant was typi-
cally a mother. In an effort to balance this one-sided view 
history of ego strengths and core pathologies, coping skills and 
defenses, and adequate or inadequate resolutions of previous 
psychosocial crises to the task of nurturing a child. They have 
scripts from their own childhood, modifi ed by information from 
friends, relatives, and experts about how to approach the task. 
With all this, they have to adapt to the unique temperament, 
developmental level, and strengths or vulnerabilities of each of 
their children and to the work, family, cultural, and community 
contexts in which childrearing is taking place.
Parenting takes place over a long period of time. In a 
two-parent family, the partners have many opportunities to 
observe and appreciate each other’s approaches to the care, 
nurturing, and guidance of their children. The concept of a 
parenting alliance has been introduced as a way to capture 
the importance of the working relationship between the part-
ners as they engage in parenting behaviors. The parenting 
alliance is defi ned as “the capacity of a spouse to acknowl-
edge, respect, and value the parenting roles and tasks of the 
partner” (Cohen & Weissman, 1984, p. 35). As adults estab-
lish their parenting alliance, they benefi t from knowing that 
their partner values, trusts, and respects the way they enact 
their parenting role. The confi dence and sense of apprecia-
tion that come with this knowledge help adults to engage 
more joyfully in their parenting and to weather periods of 
IT IS WELL established that meno-
pause causes recognizable physical 
changes that an adult woman may 
view as unpleasant. The severity of 
symptoms is determined by both 
the biological changes related to 
decreases in estrogen production 
and by the attitude of the culture 
toward the infertile, older woman. 
In cultures that reward women for 
reaching the end of the fertile period, 
menopause is associated with fewer 
physiological symptoms. In a study 
describing the reaction of women 
in India, menopause was associated 
with increased social status: “The 
absence of menstrual fl ow signaled 
an incredible elevation of stature 
for these women. Women were 
released from a veiled, secluded life 
in a compound to talk and socialize 
(even drink) with menfolk. They then 
became revered as models of wisdom 
and experience by the younger 
generation” (Gillespie, 1989, p. 46). 
Recent studies support this view 
that women from different cultural 
groups have diverse attitudes about 
menopause that may create a more 
or less positive context for the end of 
the reproductive stage of life (Lerner-
Geva, Boyko, Blumstein, & Benyamini, 
2010).
A woman’s attitudes toward aging 
and her involvement in adult roles 
infl uence the ease or diffi culty with 
which she experiences menopause. In 
U.S. society, for example, a woman who 
is going through menopause at age 50 
may also be experiencing the severe 
illness or death of her parents and the 
marriage of her youngest child. The 
severity of menopausal symptoms and 
the extent to which women experience 
changes in their sexual motivation may 
depend largely on their involvement in a 
satisfying intimate relationship (Hinchiff, 
Gott, & Ingleton, 2010).
The majority of publications 
dealing with menopause focus on 
issues such as the treatment of 
symptoms and the pros and cons 
of hormone replacement therapy 
(Utian, 2003). Comparatively few 
studies have focused on the social 
and psychological correlates of 
menopause. The tendency in the U.S. 
medical culture is to treat menopause 
as an illness or a defi cit leading to the 
loss of reproductive capacity rather 
than as a normative transition into a 
new phase of adult life (Rostosky & 
Travis, 1996).
Women differ in how they interpret 
the meaning of menopause. Some are 
embarrassed by the hot fl ashes when 
they occur in a public setting. Others 
see the symptoms of menopause as 
a reminder that they are aging in a 
culture that values youth and physical 
attractiveness in women above other 
characteristics. An emerging group 
has recast hot fl ashes as power 
surges, suggesting the beginning of 
a new, competent period of life. In a

In some families, fathers face a particularly diffi cult chal-
lenge in finding the time to interact effectively with their 
children. For example, one naturalistic observational study 
focused on the quality of family interactions in dual earner 
families when parents returned home from work, and in 
the evening when everyone was at home. Fathers typically 
returned home from work later than mothers. When moth-
ers came home from work, they were usually greeted posi-
tively by the children who then fi lled them in on the day’s 
activities. When fathers returned from work, they were 
greeted positively, but often the children then resumed their 
activities, and little conversation took place about the events 
of the day. Over the course of the evening, mothers were 
more likely to spend time with their children; fathers were 
more likely to spend time alone (Campos, Graesch, Repetti, 
Bradbury, & Ochs, 2009). One can infer from this pattern 
that fathers who want to have a more detailed picture of their 
children’s daily lives may have to develop deliberate strate-
gies for engaging their children in conversations when they 
are together.
As children get older, fathers and mothers modify their 
caregiving roles. Fathers tend to become more involved in 
their children’s care, and mothers’ involvement decreases 
somewhat. This is especially true when there are more boys 
of parenting, a growing literature is clarifying the multidi-
mensional nature of the father role and fathering in middle 
adulthood (Pleck & Masciadrelli, 2004). Paternal involve-
ment has been characterized along a variety of dimensions, 
including how men perceive their connection with their 
children; the frequency and nature of their one-to-one inter-
actions with their children; their responsibility for specifi c 
child care needs such as taking children to school, caring 
for them when they are ill, or helping with homework; and 
their accessibility when the child wants to initiate interac-
tions. Research has also focused on men’s views and values 
regarding fatherhood, the impact of fathers on children, and 
the relationship of marital quality to men’s competence as 
fathers.
Most men fi nd personal meaning and emotional support 
in their roles as husband and father. For many men, the posi-
tive quality of their marital and parental roles helps them cope 
more effectively with the stresses of work (Palkowitz, 2002). 
In many instances, specifi c lessons from home—including the 
patience and communication necessary to be an effective par-
ent, willingness to plan and work out alternative strategies for 
managing daily tasks with his wife, and the admiration he has 
for his wife in her paid labor force activities—actually help a 
man function more effectively at work.
recent online survey, women from four 
ethnic groups were asked to describe 
their menopausal symptoms (Im, 
Lee, Chee, Dormire, & Brown, 2010). 
Asian American women reported 
the fewest symptoms; European 
American women reported the most. 
Among African American women, 
there was a cultural theme of being 
strong, accepting menopause as a 
natural process, and keeping silent 
or downplaying their symptoms. 
Individual variability was noted, with 
sensitivity to symptoms linked to the 
woman’s health and concurrent life 
stressors, as well as her cultural beliefs 
about the meaning of this transition in 
her life.
The North American Menopause 
Society (NAMS) sponsored a Gallup 
poll of postmenopausal women in 
the United States. The respondents 
were divided about equally, with 
half seeing menopause as a medical 
condition that required treatment and 
half seeing it as a natural transition 
that could be weathered without 
medical intervention (NAMS, 2010). 
Another survey sponsored by NAMS 
found that women had signifi cant 
misunderstandings about the health 
risks associated with menopause, but 
relatively few received information 
to address their concerns from their 
health care providers (NAMS, 2010).

menopause, see the North American 
Menopause Society website (www

Critical Thinking Questions
 1. What might account for the 
ways that women differ in their 
interpretation of the meaning of 
 menopause?
 2. What might be some implications 
of the fact that gynecologists and 
women patients differ in what they 
view as the most important con-
cerns or worries associated with 
menopause? How might these dif-
ferences infl uence doctor-patient 
rapport, treatment strategies, and 
treatment outcomes?
 3. How does menopause relate to 
the developmental tasks of middle 
adulthood?
 4. Design a study that focuses on 
either the psychological or so-
cial correlates of menopause. 
How would you approach these 
research questions? What might 
be some diffi culties about doing 
 research on this topic?
 5. Why do you think Indian women 
experience an increase in status af-
ter menopause? What aspects of a 
culture might be related to attrib-
uting higher status and more re-
spect to postmenopausal women 
than to premenopausal women?

CHAPTER 12 Middle Adulthood (34 to 60 Years) 
The Years When Children Are in Early and Middle 
Childhood. School-age children tap parents’ resources for 
ideas about things to do, places to go, and friends to meet. 
They seek new experiences in order to expand their com-
petence and investigate the larger world outside the home. 
The role that parents play in exposing their children to cul-
tural resources such as music, art, travel, theater, and science 
contributes positively to the children’s school achievement, 
even beyond the impact of the parents’ own educa-
tional background, beliefs, and expectations (Roscigno & 
 Ainsworth-Darnell, 1999). Parents become active as chauf-
feurs, secretaries, and sometimes as buffers between their 
children and the rest of the community.
During this time, parents have many opportunities to 
function as educators for their children. They actively con-
tribute to their children’s academic success through such 
activities as reading with them, helping them with home-
work, praising them for school success, and school involve-
ment, including talking with teachers, visiting the school, 
and participating in school projects. Research on academic 
success makes it clear that parents’ aspirations for their chil-
dren, their overall parenting skills, and their involvement in 
their children’s education make a substantial contribution to 
their children’s progress (Gutman & Midgley, 2000). Parents 
who combine appropriate challenges with warmth and sup-
port typically have children who are highly motivated, think 
of themselves as academically capable, and want to do well 
in school (Bronstein et al., 1998).
Parenting during this period has the potential for boosting 
an adult’s sense of pride in the skills and knowledge already 
accumulated. Parents are gatekeepers to the resources of 
the community. They come to see themselves through their 
children’s eyes, as people who know about the world—its 
rewards, treasures, secrets, and dangers.
than girls in the family. The more hours mothers work, the 
more responsibility fathers have for their children. Within 
the context of a loving marital relationship, the traits asso-
ciated with a competent, caring parental role are learned 
and practiced so that fathers become increasingly involved 
and attuned to their child’s needs (Wood & Repetti, 2004; 
 Bradford & Hawkins, 2006; Jacobs & Kelley, 2006).
Developmental Stages of the Family
At each stage of a child’s life, the demands on parents change. 
Infants require constant care and attention. Preschoolers require 
educational toys and interaction with peers. They can spend a 
great deal of time in independent play, but they require mind-
ful supervision. Early and middle school-age children require 
parental reassurance about their skills, talents, and fears. The 
early adolescent requires less in the way of physical care but 
needs continuing emotional support and guidance, faces new 
fi nancial demands, and needs help clarifying academic and per-
sonal goals, and facilitating participation in athletics, after-school 
activities, peer relations, and social life.
For the purposes of this discussion of parenting, we have 
chosen to consider the potential infl uences of the phases of fam-
ily development on adult development. This approach illustrates 
the links in psychosocial development across generations. It 
highlights the processes through which the development of chil-
dren may prompt new growth among parents. Although middle 
adults might be parenting children of any age, we will focus on 
the following four periods, which correspond to the most likely 
transitions that take place as parents age from 34 to 60:
 1. The years when children are in early and middle childhood.
 2. The years when children are adolescents.
 3. The years when children are adults.
 4. Grandparenthood.

see the kinds of lives that their children have established for 
themselves. Erikson (Erikson et al., 1986) found that during 
this period, many parents continue to build their identities 
on the accomplishments of their children.
The transitional period during which children leave home 
does not seem to be a negative time for adults. A woman 
who was anticipating her children leaving home described 
her feelings this way:
From the day the kids are born, if it’s not one thing, it’s 
another. After all these years of being responsible for them, 
you fi nally get to the point where you want to scream, “Fall 
out of the nest already, you guys, will you? It’s time.” It’s as 
if I want to take myself back after all these years—to give 
me back to me, if you know what I mean. Of course, that’s 
providing there’s any “me” left. (Rubin, 1980, p. 313)
Parents are usually pleased as they follow their chil-
dren’s accomplishments. Furthermore, children’s indepen-
dence may permit parents to use their fi nancial resources to 
enhance their own lifestyle.
Of course, adults maintain certain parental functions dur-
ing this stage. Many children remain fully or partly fi nan-
cially dependent on their parents during their twenties. If the 
children are in college or in postgraduate study, their par-
ents may experience greater fi nancial demands than at any 
earlier period in their parenting history. In many families, 
parents take on additional jobs and additional loans to meet 
the fi nancial requirements of their children’s education. Chil-
dren who have left home may not have resolved decisions 
about occupation and marriage. For them, their parents may 
remain a source of advice and support as they go through 
periods of identity and intimacy formation and consolida-
tion. Parents begin to feel the pressure of challenges to their 
value orientation as their children experiment with new roles 
and lifestyles. During this stage, parents may serve as sound-
ing boards or as jousting partners in young people’s attempts 
to conceptualize their own lifestyle.
As less time is taken up with direct parenting responsi-
bilities, parents may begin to alter their roles and redirect 
their energies. However, some parents experience resistance 
from their children, who expect their parents to remain the 
same as they themselves change and grow. In many cases, 
young adult children return home for intervals when they 
look for a new job, find a new roommate, recover from a 
love relationship that has ended, return from military ser-
vice, or drop out of college (Thornton, Young-DeMarco, & 
Goldscheider, 1993). Throughout these transitions, young 
adults look to their parents as a source of stability and to 
their home as a safe harbor while they try to establish their 
own life structure.
One of the major family events that may occur during 
this period is the child’s decision to cohabit or marry. Parents 
are expected to accept a new person into their family—their 
child’s intimate partner. Along with this new relationship 
comes a connection to an entirely new network of relation-
ships, the partner’s family. In the United States, most parents 
The Years When Children Are Adolescents. Parents 
tend to view the years of their children’s adolescence as 
extremely trying. Adolescents are likely to seek new levels 
of behavioral independence. They spend most of the day 
away from home and apart from adult supervision. As ado-
lescents gain in physical stature and cognitive skills, they are 
likely to challenge parental authority. During this time, the 
principles that parents have emphasized as important for 
responsible, moral behavior are frequently tested. Children 
are exposed to many voices—including the media, popular 
heroes and heroines, peers, and school adults—that suggest 
there may be more than one ideal way to behave and more 
than one defi nition of success. Successful parents of adoles-
cents attempt to balance autonomy granting (opportunities 
for their children to make their own decisions), responsive-
ness, warmth and support, communication about high stan-
dards, and limit setting in the needed proportions so that 
their children can grow increasingly independent while still 
being able to rely on an atmosphere of family guidance and 
reassurance (Steinberg, 2001).
Adolescent children are the front line of each new gen-
eration. The questions they raise and the choices they make 
refl ect not only what they have learned, but also what they 
are experiencing in the present and what they anticipate in 
the future. Parents of adolescents are likely to feel persistent 
pressure to reevaluate their own socialization and their effec-
tiveness as parents. Questions are raised about their prepara-
tion for their own future as well as their children’s. The ego 
boost parents experienced from being viewed as wise and 
resourceful when their children were young is likely to be 
replaced by doubt as they and their children face an uncer-
tain future. Parents who can respond to their adolescents 
in an open, supportive way can benefi t by fi nding oppor-
tunities to clarify their own values. They can begin building 
new parent-child relationships that will carry them and their 
emerging adult children into later adulthood.
The Years When Children Are Adults. The period dur-
ing which children make their own transitions into adult-
hood results in new patterns of interaction between parents 
and children and in new opportunities for the middle adult 
parents. Alternative patterns are clearly evident in current 
U.S. families, as children take a variety of paths toward self-
suffi ciency and entry into adult roles. In 2009, 59% of those 
ages 20 to 24 and 36% of those ages 25 to 29 who were 
unmarried lived at home with their parents (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2010). By the time adult children marry, they are 
almost always ready to leave the parental home.
Family roles change during this time. Most women enter 
menopause during this period, bringing a close to the cou-
ple’s natural childbearing years. The relationship between 
the parents also changes as parenting activities diminish. 
Some couples become closer—closer than they have been 
since they first fell in love. However, divorces also occur 
after the children leave home. Parents are likely to begin a 
review and evaluation of their performance as parents as they

CHAPTER 12 Middle Adulthood (34 to 60 Years) 
Parenting can be stressful. It is full of confl icts and chal-
lenges, demanding time that the partners might otherwise 
spend with each other or in pursuit of their own interests 
and ambitions. However, parenting generates the kind of 
confl ict that promises an enormous potential for personal 
growth. By providing a meaningful, responsive context for 
children, parents have the opportunity to articulate their 
own value systems and to observe the consequences of their 
efforts in the continuous development of their children. Psy-
chosocial growth requires a willingness to engage in tasks 
that may temporarily increase stress, uncertainty, and com-
plexity. Thus, it does not mean turning away from or mini-
mizing tension. It frequently means choosing the challenge 
that is noticeably diffi cult or intriguingly complex in hopes 
of growing while struggling to meet it.
Caring for One’s Aging Parents
People tend to regard middle adulthood as a time devoted to 
future generations. However, another test of one’s capacity 
for generativity comes in the form of commitment to one’s 
aging parents. One of the signifi cant challenges of middle 
have little infl uence on their child’s decisions in this matter. 
They may fi nd themselves associated through marriage or 
intimate partnership with a family kinship group that differs 
signifi cantly from their own or with one that shares many of 
their own family’s beliefs and values.
The fi rst few years of marriage (as discussed in Chapter 
11) can be somewhat precarious. Parents may have to reinte-
grate an adult child into the family at this stage if the mar-
riage is not successful. It can be assumed that a child who 
leaves a marriage needs some temporary parental reassur-
ance and support in order to regain confi dence in the abil-
ity to form an intimate relationship. Thus, at times of crisis, 
middle adults may need to practice parenting skills they 
have not used for a while and develop new skills in helping 
their children deal with new challenges.
Grandparenthood. Grandparenthood—the time when 
an adult witnesses the birth of a new generation—might 
be considered the beginning of an additional stage in fam-
ily development. However, the transition to grandparent-
hood is outside one’s own control. Whenever one’s children 
have children of their own, the grandparent becomes alerted 
to a new sense of ancestry, lineage, and membership in 
an expanding kinship network. With grandparenthood, 
adults begin to observe their children as parents. As people 
refl ect on their own roles 20 to 30 years earlier, they may 
at tribute some of their children’s successes to their own par-
enting techniques and may take responsibility for some of 
the failures, too (Erikson et al., 1986). In Chapter 13 (Later 
Adulthood), we consider in greater detail the role of grand-
parenthood and its signifi cance to the adult. Suffi ce it to say 
that as grandparents, adults have the opportunity to relate to 
small children as an expression of the continuity of their lives 
into the future. Of course, not all grandparents relate to their 
grandchildren from this philosophical point of view. How-
ever, the attainment of the grandparent role has the potential 
for bringing with it a new perspective on time, purpose, and 
the meaning of life that may serve as a source of reassurance 
during later adulthood.
Adults differ in how they defi ne the role of grandparent. 
They may see themselves as carriers of the family traditions 
and dispensers of wisdom, as needed experts in child care, 
as convenient and trusted babysitters, or as admirers from 
afar. As grandparents, adults are asked to reinvest energy 
in small children. The quality of the relationship that 
develops between grandparents and their grandchildren 
depends not so much on the fact that they are relatives as 
on the kinds of experiences that the two generations share. 
Grandparents may also fi nd that the quality of their rela-
tionship with their grandchildren is mediated by the child’s 
parents. Especially when the grandchildren are little, the 
amount of time they spend with their grandparents and 
the way the grandparents view them are fi ltered through 
the quality of the adult relationship that their parents have 
with their own parents, the grandparents (Brubaker, 1990; 
Erber, 2005).

level of fi lial obligation, although the extent of support was 
greater in Spain and Israel than in the northern European 
countries. The nature of the obligation was varied, more pre-
scriptive in Spain and Israel, and more open to negotiation 
in the northern countries. Across countries, more help was 
given to older parents when they were unmarried and suffer-
ing from some kind of physical disability. Across countries, 
help was bidirectional, with aging adults providing emo-
tional and fi nancial support to their adult children as well as 
receiving support from them.
In fact, studies of intergenerational economic transfers 
fi nd that, on average, older adults (i.e., those 65 and older) 
give more in cash and gifts than they receive from younger 
generations and that it is more likely that an adult child will 
live in the household of an older parent than the reverse 
(Litwin, Vogel, Kunemund & Kohli, 2008; Fingerman, 
Miller, Birditt, & Zarit, 2009).
Who Provides Help? The evidence suggests that daugh-
ters assume much more of the responsibility for their aging 
adulthood is the struggle to respond effectively to one’s par-
ents as well as one’s children and grandchildren. That is why 
middle adults are sometimes referred to as the sandwich gen-
eration, tucked in the middle between caring for one’s chil-
dren and caring for one’s aging parents. As one ages from 
30 to 50, one’s parents may age from 60 to 80. The num-
ber of adults over the age of 65 increased from more than 
25 million in 1980 to 38.8 million in 2005. The number of 
adults age 75 and over was about 18.7 million, an increase 
of 88% since 1980 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). It is becom-
ing increasingly likely that middle adults will be involved in 
meeting the needs of their own aging parents and grandpar-
ents. It is also increasingly probable that their aging parents 
will survive through a period of vigorous and independent 
later adulthood into a period of frail later life.
What Is Filial Obligation? What is the nature of fi lial 
obligation as it is viewed from the perspectives of adult chil-
dren and their aging parents? Who provides what kinds of 
help? What characterizes optimal parent-child relationships 
during this phase of life? Filial obligation is a feeling of 
responsibility to care for one’s parents. One way of think-
ing about fi lial obligation is that it is a sense of responsibility 
that adult children have to help their parents as they get old 
and their physical or mental health declines. Another view is 
that the sense of fi lial obligation is a moral sense of duty that 
arises as one realizes and acknowledges the sacrifi ces one’s 
parents have made and the sense of indebtedness for those 
sacrifi ces. This view is more compatible with the observation 
that a sense of fi lial obligation can be very salient in ado-
lescence or early adulthood, not only in middle adulthood 
when one’s parents are aging (Stein, 2009).
What can aging parents expect of their adult children? How 
do adult children defi ne their responsibilities for their parents? 
One measure of fi lial obligation included fi ve components: pro-
viding needed assistance, maintaining frequent contact, avoid-
ing conflict, sharing appropriate personal information, and 
maintaining appropriate levels of self-suffi ciency (Stein, 2009). 
Using this measure with a sample of middle adults whose par-
ents were all living in assisted living communities, researchers 
found that the kind of help adults provided depended in part 
on their assessment of their parents’ physical and mental health. 
The healthier the parents, the less sense of obligation the middle 
adults felt. When middle adults evaluated their parents’ mental 
health as better than average but their physical health as worse, 
they were more inclined to provide more sharing of personal 
information. When they evaluated their parents’ physical health 
as better than average but their mental health as worse, they 
were more inclined to provide assistance. Thus, the adults’ sense 
of obligation was tailored to support their parents’ strengths.
The expression of filial obligation is affected by one’s 
culture as well as by the aging parent’s well-being. A cross-
national study of fi lial obligation compared responses from 
1,200 adults in each of five countries: Norway, England, 
Germany, Spain, and Israel (Lowenstein & Daatland, 2006). 
Across all countries, most respondents acknowledged some 
Robyn derives a great deal of satisfaction from taking a walk with 
her mother. Because of physical frailty, her mother lives with her 
now. Robyn thinks about all the things her mother has done for her 
and all the sacrifi ces she made so that Robyn could go to college 
and have the life she now has. Robyn is very happy to take care of 
her mother and to still have her mother’s company and wisdom.

CHAPTER 12 Middle Adulthood (34 to 60 Years) 
among the current aging population, many of whom state 
that they do not need assistance from their adult children. 
However, when asked whom they view as their preferred 
source of assistance should they need it, aging parents men-
tion their children first, before their friends, siblings, or 
other relatives. Likewise, adult children view themselves as 
being primarily responsible for meeting their parents’ needs; 
however, most do not expect to have to meet a variety of 
such needs (Zarit & Eggebeen, 2002).
In adulthood, preserving and building a positive parent- 
child relationship is a dyadic process in which both mid-
dle adults and aging parents may need to gather new 
 information and change old behaviors (Lyons, Zarit, Sayer, & 
Whitlach, 2002; AgriLife Extension, 2010). Thinking back 
to later adolescence and early adulthood, children may feel 
a sense of obligation to their parents, but they may not be 
in a position to reciprocate for the many ways their parents 
have helped them. During those stages of life, they continue 
to be dependent on their parents for emotional and instru-
mental support. However, sometime during early and mid-
dle adulthood, a socioemotional transition occurs. Now, in 
middle adulthood, adult children are likely to have achieved 
a greater sense of independence from their parents, and to 
have the experience and resources needed to assist them in 
some valued ways.
However, the relationship of adults and their aging par-
ents has a history. For some, this history is one of a posi-
tive attachment, mutual positive regard, and experiences 
in which parents skillfully balanced autonomy-granting 
and closeness to create a family environment in which the 
children could emerge with the resources needed to form a 
strong personal identity. In other families, children formed 
an insecure attachment, they feel rejected or undermined by 
their parents, and they emerge into adulthood with strong 
feelings of resentment or rebellion toward their parents. 
Their relationships with their parents are never close as chil-
dren go off on their own, and interactions become increas-
ingly infrequent. These antecedents will infl uence the quality 
of fi lial obligation and the context in which any kind of rela-
tionship between an adult child and their aging parent can 
take shape.
Building on the past, adult children and aging parents 
may find that they have predictable areas of conflict. In a 
desire to reduce confl ict, adults and aging parents may need 
to improve their approach to communication, or redefine 
the problem so that it does not continue to disrupt a car-
ing relationship. Similarly, adult children and aging parents 
need to identify the activities they enjoy together, and talk 
openly about how much time they want to spend together. 
For some parent-child bonds, a few hours a week or a week-
end visit every so often may be all that is desired; for others, 
daily contact may be pleasant and satisfying. Adult children 
need to learn more about the changes associated with aging, 
and begin to identify specifi c aspects of their parent’s men-
tal or physical health that may be impacted by aging. Aging 
parents need to learn more about the demands and stressors 
parents than do sons—including care for their spouse’s par-
ents as well as their own (Allen, Blieszner, & Roberto, 2001). 
This involvement is one element of the basic kin-keeping 
tasks that have traditionally been incorporated into women’s 
socialization. Daughters are more likely than sons to pro-
vide care for their aging parents even when the daughters 
are employed. However, several structural aspects of an adult 
child’s employment may influence this gender difference 
(Sarkisian & Gerstel, 2004). Women typically earn less than 
men, and more men than women are self-employed. Both 
of these factors predict how much time an adult child will 
spend helping their aging parents. Adult children who earn 
lower wages are more likely to take time off to help their 
aging parent, and adults who are self-employed are less 
likely to take time off to help their aging parent. Thus, some 
of the gender difference in caregiving is interdependent with 
the nature of workplace commitments and demands.
In addition to the amount of time that adult children 
spend helping their parents, daughters also provide some-
what different kinds of help. Daughters provide more direct 
care, such as bathing or dressing a parent, as well as emo-
tional support, such as listening to a parent’s concerns or 
helping the parent feel important and loved. However, both 
sons and daughters are about equally likely to assist in some 
of the tasks involving relations with health and human 
ser vice organizations, scheduling medical checkups, and 
reviewing insurance and other fi nancial matters. Research 
shows that aging adults who have three or more children—
whether they are sons or daughters—are more likely to end 
up living with one of them than are adults with fewer than 
three children. However, for other forms of support, such as 
receiving telephone calls, visiting, and help in daily tasks, 
older adults who have one daughter receive more support 
than those who have only sons (Spitze & Logan, 1990).
Although adult children provide much of the family sup-
port to aging parents, young adult grandchildren also report 
a sense of filial obligation and participate in the caregiv-
ing role (Fruhauf, Jarrott, & Allen, 2006). In a qualitative 
study of 17 grandchildren ages 21 to 29 who were actively 
involved in their grandparents’ care, some began to take a 
more active role when another family member was no longer 
able to help. Eleven said that they respected and valued the 
time their grandparents spent with them as children, and 
this was a way for them to reciprocate.
Josh, who has been caring for his paternal grandparents 
since he started driving, voiced the sentiment of several 
grandchildren when he stated, “It just felt like it was what 
I was supposed to do. They helped me out … helped raise 
me and so now they need us.… Now it is time to give back” 
(Fruhauf et al., 2006, p. 899).
What Factors Promote an Optimal Relationship 
Between Adults and Their Aging Parents? The 
nature of the continuing relationship between adult children 
and their aging parents is not focused solely on caregiving. 
The norms of independence and self-suffi ciency are strong

imp or an infernal fl ame, as the fi ve becomes a six; the six, a

Nervously, I dribble water into the fl ower pots. I work fast. 
She has approximately one request every three minutes.
“Thank you, darling. I feel so worthless and useless. Why 
can’t I do anything?”
“Mama, you are not worthless. You are a beautiful person. 
You still look beautiful to me,” I say, and mean it. She was my 
childhood idol. Her soulful-eyed, smooth-haired beauty was 
my fi rst acquaintance with romance.
“No, I’m not,” she whimpers; then says, “Thank you, 
 darling.”
“Mama, whatever happens, I’m with you, and I’m for you.” 
She cries. Her misery makes me recall how my fear of death 
had once made me, to my mortal shame, abandon a sick 
woman I loved. I am the namesake of Mama’s sister Florence, 
who died of cancer four summers ago. Florence is my middle 
name. Mama must be thinking of Aunt Flo, too, for she says, 
“I took care of Sister when she went up to her bedroom three 
days before she died and never came downstairs again. I re-
member she was amazed that I would wash her down there, 
you know, her private parts. She didn’t want me to have to 
do that.” After pausing, my mother adds, “I thought, Lois, 
it would help you after this is over, to be with me now when 
I need you, and do things for me.”
I am astonished at her, the good mother. She has called 
me to her sickbed, not so much as to help her as to help 
me. I, in childhood, was never hungry, never homeless, never 
seriously ill; and was never exposed to the sight of physical 
suffering. My parents had made sure of all that. But an easy 
ride of a life is only a half-truth. Now, Mama’s gift is to let me 
know her pain. She is letting me see if I am strong enough to 
grapple, by proxy, with Death (Lyles, 1991, p. 242).
CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. How would you describe the costs of caregiving in this 
case?
 2. How would you describe the rewards of caregiving in this 
case?
 3. From what you can gather, what is the quality of the 
mother-daughter relationship in this case?
 4. What role might caring for her dying mother play in Lois’s 
development as an adult?
Managing the Household
Objective 4. To analyze the tasks required for effective 
management of the household and the diversity of 
households, including blended families, single-parent 
families, and adults who live alone.
Household is a term that describes an entity that is cre-
ated by people for a particular style of living. Households 
are bounded units that pool their resources, earn and spend 
their children are facing in order to appreciate the constraints 
these demands place on their child’s helping behaviors.
Adult children are sometimes in a position of trying to 
supplement the care and support they provide their parents 
by coordinating social services and interacting with vari-
ous public agencies. Many feel unprepared for this aspect 
of the caring relationship (Zarit & Eggebeen, 2002). They 
are not comfortable dealing with hospitals, insurance agen-
cies, social service agencies, or residential treatment facili-
ties. However, when older adults require the services of these 
organizations, their adult children typically know their par-
ents’ unique needs and are among the best people to inter-
pret them for service providers. Through such contacts, 
middle adults have the opportunity to modify and improve 
the services offered by these agencies, making them more 
effective for future generations of aging adults.
Research on caregiving within the family has begun 
to examine the rewards as well as the costs in this rela-
tionship (Robertson, Zarit, Duncan, Rovine, & Femia, 
2007). Although quite a bit of attention has been given to 
caregiver strain, caregivers experience both positive and 
negative aspects of this role. The costs may include feelings 
of exhaustion, never having time for oneself, feeling over-
whelmed by the demands of multiple roles, or experiencing 
the physical strain of caregiving. Rewards of the caregiving 
role may include feelings of being appreciated, putting life’s 
demands into a new perspective, or feeling closer to the 
care recipient. In some cases, the care recipient is able to 
exchange resources with the caregiver, for example, by pro-
viding babysitting time for help with the grocery shopping. 
In a study of the costs and rewards experienced by children 
and spouses who were caring for an aging parent or part-
ner, adult children experienced more rewards in their care-
giving role than did spouses, and women experienced more 
caregiving costs than did men. An unexpected fi nding was 
that for women, companionship from their spouse was an 
especially rewarding response from the care recipients (i.e., 
their husbands). Thus, the research underscores the recipro-
cal nature of caregiving, with rewards and costs fl owing in 
both directions (Raschick & Ingersoll-Dayton, 2004). These 
ideas are refl ected in the case study of a daughter caring for 
her ailing mother.

the continuity of the household is preserved by the group 
of people and their shared belongings even though the loca-
tion of the household changes. The capacities to maintain 
a household and to nurture household members refl ect the 
leadership skills, creativity, and self-reliance that are charac-
teristics of maturity in middle adulthood.
Management of the household refers to all the planning, 
problem solving, and activities adults undertake in order 
to take care of themselves and others who are entrusted 
to their care. At present, society’s ability to recognize and 
value the accomplishments linked to the management of 
money, interact with the labor market, and engage in social 
interaction with their neighbors (Wallerstein & Smith, 
1991). The household provides a basic life structure for 
people in all cultures. The box on the Hindu joint family 
illustrates the way that household management is culturally 
constructed, based on norms for gender, age, and kinship 
ties. The demands and tasks of household management call 
forth responses that stimulate cognitive, social, and personal 
development during adulthood. The household is not only a 
physical setting, but also a shared psychological context for 
a group of people. In nomadic tribal groups, for example, 
THE ORGANIZATION of the joint 
family, including the special role of the 
man as head of the whole family and 
the woman as head of the household, 
is internalized as children grow up 
and is transformed into a commitment 
to daily activities in the transition to 
adulthood.
A Hindu joint family involves the 
sharing of the same household ter-
ritory by the parallel kin and their 
offspring (brothers or sisters, their 
spouses, and their children). Two 
lines of dominance—male and 
 female—are mutually intertwined, 
both honoring the age of the par-
ticipants. . . . Under the traditional 
pattern of authority, the eldest male 
member of the joint family was con-
sidered the head of the whole family. 
He had authority over  others—yet 
not unlimited authority. He could not 
use the power arbitrarily, without 
collectively coordinating his deci-
sions. In the second generation, the 
eldest son used to hold a superior 
position among the other male 
members of the family, yet had a 
 position subordinate to the head and 
the elder women. Thus, decisions 
within a joint family relied on mak-
ing of coalitions between less and 
more powerful members of the fam-
ily. The age-respecting dominance 
system allowed the older members 
of the family—particularly the older 
women—remarkable power. . . .
The particular system of social 
relations within a Hindu joint family 
created a collective cultural mean-
ing system of attributing high value 
to becoming a mother-in-law. . . . 
Becoming a mother-in-law meant 
takeover of the running of the whole 
joint family system in the sphere of 
home life. Becoming a mother-in-law 
obviously required passing through 
the phase of being a daughter-in-law 
in the joint family of one’s husband. 
Despite the heavy workload 
involved in the phase, women in 
the daughter-in-law phase of their 
lives internalize the value and 
positive expectations for the “pro-
motion” to the upcoming role of 
mother-in-law, which is the state of 
“mature adulthood” in the Hindu life 
course. (Valsiner, 2000, p. 89)
As the female elders in a joint 
household, women are expected to 
supervise their daughters-in-law, and 
daughters-in-law subject themselves 
to the power and guidance of their 
mothers-in-law. Daughters-in-law 
make all the meals, sweep the house, 
make the bread, serve each person 
as he or she arrives at the home for 
each meal, and wash the dishes. In 
response to real and symbolic acts 
of service, the mother-in-law makes 
sure her daughter-in-law’s needs are 
met, allows her time to visit her own 
family, buffers her from any jealousy 
or bickering from other family 
members, and gives her blessings. 
A daughter-in-law’s status increases 
when she gives birth to a son 
(Gardiner & Kosmitzki, 2005).
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. In this description of the Hindu 
joint family, the oldest male is re-
ferred to as the head of the family. 
What do you imagine is his role? 
What are his rights and responsi-
bilities? What kinds of socialization 
experiences might prepare a man 
to become head of his family?
 2. What might be some challenges 
to the social system of the Hindu 
joint family if an Indian family im-
migrates to the United States?
 3. How might modernization and the 
increased involvement of women 
in the labor market alter the bal-
ance of gender roles in the Hindu 
joint family?
 4. What are some similarities and differ-
ences between the organization of 
the Hindu joint family and the family 
in which you grew up? What was 
the power hierarchy in the family? 
How were men and women’s roles 
defi ned and coordinated?
 5. The decisions in a Hindu joint fam-
ily require the family to form coali-
tions across gender and age cate-
gories. How might such a coalition 
form? How might it operate, for 
example, around the selection of a 
marriage partner for an oldest son 
or a decision about sending a son 
or daughter to college?
 6. How might the organization of the 
Hindu joint family infl uence gender 
role preference for Hindu males 
and females?

more time is devoted to child care by both men and women. 
Dual-career couples are more likely to purchase services for 
household tasks, and are especially likely to order in meals 
or to eat out as a way of saving time. The drop in the number 
of hours dedicated to household tasks among women is not 
solely due to women’s participation in the labor market; the 
decline in hours of household work was greater over time 
for those who were not employed than for those who were 
(Casper & Bianchi, 2002).
The challenge of household management is to create an 
environment that supports both individual and group func-
tioning. The signifi cance of the household can be appreci-
ated by thinking about the consequences of its absence, 
especially in the case of homeless individuals and families 
(see the box on homelessness), or in crises such as hurri-
canes, fi res, or fl oods when people are displaced from their 
homes. Management of the household, much like the work-
place, requires leadership in order to set priorities and goals, 
manage resources, and operationalize plans. The scarcer 
the resources, the greater the pressure on the adult to make 
careful decisions and to fi nd creative solutions to the daily 
challenges of meeting the household’s physical and psycho-
logical needs. Leadership begins as adults model the pro cess 
of shared decision making and children (if there are any) 
learn to participate in problem solving. Household members 
discover ways to work together to achieve a shared vision of 
the future. The home environment is the fi rst place where 
many children discover that they can have a voice. Parents 
can create a family atmosphere in which the spirit of democ-
racy comes alive through a careful balance of freedom and 
responsibility, respect for individuality, and commitment to 
the welfare of others.
Building Networks and Coalitions
One of the most difficult and subtle kinds of new learning 
that occurs during middle adulthood is the development 
the household is poorly developed. At the same time, more 
emphasis is being placed on the centrality of the home envi-
ronment in fostering intellectual development, social compe-
tence, health, and emotional well-being.
The household system has the potential for providing 
an environment that facilitates human growth and mental 
health. Learning to create such an environment is a devel-
opmental task of the middle adult years. Households have 
the potential for much greater variety and flexibility than 
most work settings. However, many of the tasks required for 
household maintenance are tedious, physically demanding, 
repetitious, and time consuming. Over the past 40 years, as 
women have become more intensively involved in the labor 
market, research has focused on how much time people 
spend at the tasks of household maintenance and who is per-
forming those tasks.
Managing Resources and Meeting Needs
Data gathered through daily time diaries provide a picture of 
the amount of time devoted to various household tasks and the 
involvement of men and women in those tasks (Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, 2010). These data help clarify the diversity of house-
hold tasks, the amount of time devoted to those tasks, and the 
way the division of labor between men and women is played 
out in the management of the household. Table 12.2 shows the 
average percentage of men and women who are engaged in vari-
ous household-related activities each day. Table 12.3 shows the 
average number of hours spent in each activity per day by those 
who perform the activity. With the exception of lawn and garden 
care, a greater percentage of women than men are engaged in 
household activities, purchasing services and goods, caring for 
and helping household members, and communicating through 
telephone, mail, and e-mail. However, when men are involved 
in these activities, they spend almost the same amount of time at 
them as do women.
In comparison to patterns of time use from the 1960s, 
fewer hours are devoted to household tasks overall, and

protect the family from excessive external demands, while 
retaining valuable and satisfying external relationships.
Families differ in their investment in relationships out-
side the family unit. In some households, the nuclear family 
is more important than any other group. Such households 
expend little energy outside the family boundaries. At the 
other extreme are families who are involved in a number 
of community groups and who incorporate their extended 
families into frequent group activities. In some families, each 
person is encouraged to establish a group of close friends. In 
others, each person’s friends are screened or evaluated by the 
other family members. The adult’s task is to defi ne the fam-
ily’s preferred stance toward other social groups and to create 
opportunities to build desired relationships.
of an understanding of how the structures of other orga-
nizations affect one’s life and the lives of family members. 
These other organizations may include (1) members of 
the extended family (e.g., one’s in-laws), (2) other fami-
lies, (3) business or work-related associations, (4) reli-
gious groups, (5) educational groups, and (6) community 
groups. This concept was introduced briefly in Chapter 2 
in describing Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) model of the meso-
system. The family is interconnected with other social 
systems that can expand its resources. Its contact with 
social groups must include the maintenance of goodwill 
and some evidence of group identification and commit-
ment. Social groups also generate norms that may make 
demands on the family. Hence, adults must be able to 
Homelessness
THE TERM HOMELESS refers to people 
who have no permanent resting place 
and no private space (Nunez, 2004). 
Although many estimates focus on 
individuals who are living on the streets, 
in emergency shelters, or in transitional 
housing, there are also individuals 
who are living with friends or relatives, 
moving from one location to the next 
every few weeks. It is very diffi cult to 
assess the exact number of people 
who experience homelessness; the 
numbers often refl ect a specifi c point 
in time rather than a lifetime estimate. 
In 2007, the National Alliance to End 
Homelessness reported a point in time 
estimate of 744,313 people experiencing 
homelessness in January 2005 (National 
Coalition for the Homeless, 2009). 
This count did not include people who 
were in shelters for abused women, 
people who were living in outdoor areas 
typically inhabited by the homeless, 
people who may have avoided the 
shelter on that day in order to prevent 
being counted, and people who were 
housed in some other form of temporary 
housing with family and friends. In 
some locations, many people who seek 
shelter cannot be accommodated. A 
survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors 
(2008) reported that in 12 of 23 cities 
surveyed, emergency shelters and 
transitional housing units had to turn 
people away due to lack of capacity. 
Thus, efforts to count the homeless, 
even on a specifi c day, are likely to 
be inaccurate. Since homelessness is 
usually temporary, another approach is 
to make annual projections. The Urban 
Institute (2000) estimated that each year 
about 2.5 million people are homeless 
in October and 3.5 million in February. 
Roughly 38% of those who are included 
in this count are children. The National 
Coalition for the Homeless provides 
information about this and other aspects 
of homelessness on its website (www
.nationalhomeless.org).
The majority of the homeless 
population, roughly three fourths, is 
single men. However, the fastest growing 
segment of the homeless population 
is families with children. A survey of 23 
U.S. cities in 2007 found that families 
with children comprised 23% of the 
homeless, with another 5% who were 
unaccompanied minors (U.S. Conference 
of Mayors, 2008). The proportion of 
families with children who are homeless is 
estimated to be higher in rural areas.
A combination of three major factors 
contributes to the continued risk of 
homelessness for families with children 
in the United States: (1) the decline in 
the value of the minimum wage, coupled

to their child’s partner or spouse; sisters and brothers 
have partners who may or may not support each other. 
Likewise, parents may divorce and remarry, bringing one 
family system into contact with another. All these transi-
tions introduce challenges to sustaining valued coalitions 
within the extended family and protecting the family 
from disruptive forces.
Much of this chapter has focused on two-adult fami-
lies, especially those with children, often in the dual-earner 
arrangement. In the following sections, three alternative 
forms of households are described: remarriage and blended 
families, one-parent families, and single person households, 
each of which poses unique opportunities and challenges for 
household management.
Preserving relationships within the extended family 
is a delicate matter. This is the realm of family politics. 
In close family relations, it is likely that positive feelings 
of warmth and affection are coupled with negative feel-
ings of irritation and aggravation (Fingerman, Hay, & 
Birditt, 2004). Failed expectations about courtesies and 
obligations or thoughtless insults and slights from family 
members are typical stressors that occur within the family 
network. Family members may have opposing political, 
religious, or childrearing views; they may have compet-
ing motivations; or they may try to form alliances among 
family subgroups. When children decide to marry, they 
bring two family networks together that may or may 
not get along. Parents may or may not convey support 
with the prevalence of insecure jobs with 
few or no benefi ts (an estimated 22% of 
homeless people are employed); (2) the 
decline in the availability and value of 
social welfare benefi ts; and (3) shortages 
in low-income housing and public-
assistance housing (National Coalition 
for the Homeless, 2009). The recent 
increase in foreclosures has placed even 
more families at risk for homelessness.
Paths toward homelessness for 
families are diverse. Some of the 
most common precursors are job loss, 
domestic violence, substance abuse, 
mental illness, and divorce. Although 
some homeless individuals are in a 
sudden crisis, many have stumbled 
from one temporary living situation to 
the next, and others have never been 
able to establish a permanent home. 
Some of these people are singularly 
alone and unable to develop minimal 
social relationships. This is an unusual 
phenomenon, because most people 
have some ability to have meaningful 
social relationships. Among homeless 
mothers, for example, many have friends 
or family, but cannot count on them for 
housing support. For some, the nature 
of their housing crisis may disrupt their 
social network, making it impossible 
to ask for help from family or friends. 
Following an episode of homelessness, 
some families are relocated far from 
their social network, making it likely 
that they will become vulnerable to 
homelessness in the future (Toohey, 
Shinn, & Weitzman, 2004). As a result 
of victimization earlier in their lives, 
some women suffer from a degree of 
emotional dysfunction, exacerbated 
by the use of alcohol and drugs. An 
estimated 10% to 15% of homeless 
parents have a problem with drug 
addiction, making it diffi cult for them to 
hold a job, sustain a relationship, or be 
approved for low-cost housing (Nunez, 
2004).
In homelessness, society confronts 
a painful example of psychosocial 
stagnation—the inability of mature 
adults to meet their basic needs for 
shelter, food, and clothing—combined 
with its own failure to prevent their 
condition from reaching this degree of 
vulnerability. In the face of the cultural 
value placed on independence, self-
suffi ciency, and hard work, U.S. society 
has diffi culty making effective public 
responses. In fact, national policies have 
operated to increase homelessness and 
the stressors of living on the streets. 
Since 1975, there has been a steady 
and dramatic decrease in the funding 
for low-income rural and urban housing 
accompanied by the loss of low-cost 
units that qualify for public assistance 
(WRAP, 2007). Over this time, a growing 
number of cities have enacted laws that 
criminalize homelessness. These laws 
make it illegal to sleep, camp, eat, beg, 
or store personal belongings in public 
places. The police make periodic sweeps 
of areas known as gathering places for 
the homeless, forcing them to leave their 
personal belongings and to move to 
outlying areas (National Coalition for the 
Homeless and the National Law Center 
on Homelessness and Poverty, 2006).
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. What are the challenges of managing 
a household that may stimulate cog-
nitive, social, and emotional develop-
ment in adulthood? How might the 
experiences of homelessness inter-
fere with development in adulthood?
 2. What are the physical, psychologi-
cal, and social needs of people who 
are homeless? What kinds of societal 
responses might be appropriate to 
address these needs?
 3. What factors place an individual at 
risk for homelessness? How are these 
risk factors related to psychosocial 
development? How are these risk 
factors related to societal conditions? 
What is the interaction of these 
 factors?
 4. As a student of human development, 
what two suggestions would you give 
to policy makers regarding reducing 
homelessness in the United States?
 5. Look up the approach to homelessness 
in one of the following major cities: Los 
Angeles, New York, Boston, Atlanta, 
and Miami. What are the primary 
strategies being implemented in this 
city? Who is responsible for the suc-
cess of these programs? How are they 
funded? How do these programs ad-
dress basic themes of human develop-
ment in middle adulthood?

they just simply read my name, didn’t say stepfather or 
nothing else. (Marsiglio, 2004, p. 33)
In remarriage, partners must fi nd ways to create bound-
aries around the blended family, so that children can 
benefi t from the love and support of their parents, grand-
parents, and other relatives, while protecting the new fam-
ily from unwanted intrusions and pressures for competing 
loyalties. Blended families have to fi nd new traditions and 
rituals to mark their distinctiveness while preserving links 
to valued relationships from the past.
One-Parent Families
In 2008, about 30% of all families with children under 
the age of 18 were one-parent families: 80% were headed 
by women, 20% by men (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). This 
compares to 22% of all U.S. families in 1980.
The greatest stressor for single mothers is the lack of 
fi nancial resources. Roughly 40% of children living in single-
mother families had family incomes less than 100% of the 
poverty level in 2009 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). To put 
Remarriage and Blended Families
According to a national survey of marriages and divorce in the 
United States in 2001, roughly 16% of men and women had 
been married two or more times (Kreider, 2005). The psycho-
social reality of remarriage is unique. Partners come to the 
remarriage with different marital histories. One or both have a 
former spouse and in-laws from a previous marriage. In some 
cases, the relationships with the former spouse or the in-laws 
may involve unresolved confl icts. In other cases, relationships 
with the former spouse or in-laws from a previous marriage 
may continue to be close. If either partner has children, the 
remarriage involves not only a family formation between the 
adult partners, but may involve the establishment of new 
parental roles and the negotiation of ties with noncustodial 
parents and grandparents. Custody arrangements may require 
that the parents remain in the same state or community in 
order to facilitate visitation. As a result, the remarried cou-
ple’s life choices are constrained. As the new, blended family 
approaches traditional holidays, celebrations, and transitions, 
the complexities of considering these extended family bonds 
can become diffi cult (Portrie & Hill, 2005).
One of the signifi cant sources of ambiguity in a blended 
family is the relationship of stepparents to their nonbiologi-
cal stepchildren. The most common blended family is one in 
which a man marries a woman who has custody of her chil-
dren, thereby entering into the role of stepfather. What deter-
mines whether a man will embrace this role, investing in 
another man’s children as his own? William Marsiglio (2004) 
has provided a glimpse into the complexity of this process as 
men approach the social, personal, and interpersonal nature 
of becoming invested in their stepfather role. For some men, 
like Monty, the role is continuously ambiguous:
I never really understood what I was to her; I still don’t. 
I felt, I’ve always felt, like I should have been her father, 
but I never was, and I never will be.… I was always there 
for her, in positive ways, and he never was; I mean, never. 
 (Marsiglio, 2004, p. 28)
For others, like Terry, there is an openness to the possibil-
ity of sharing the role with the biological father:
Look, it’s OK to have two dads. You have a couple sets of 
grandparents and whatever. It’s OK to have two different fa-
thers. I’m the one that’s here with you all the time and he’s the 
one up there. If he gets more involved in your life, then great! 
If he doesn’t, nothing changes. I’m still here. I’m the one that’s 
going to be here every day. (Marsiglio, 2004, p. 30)
For still others, like Doug, there is no room for ambiguity:
I told her, I’ll marry you, but that’s my son legally. No step 
involved, nothing like that. That’s my son. She said, “Fine; 
I don’t see anything wrong with that.” So that’s when she 
went back to him [biological father] and said she don’t want 
any alimony, child support, nothing. Just want you out of 
the picture. He signed the papers; he said, “No problem. I 
won’t cause any trouble.” So when the papers came back,

women, being an unmarried, single parent is a deliberate strat-
egy for avoiding a diffi cult and potentially costly divorce.
People Who Live Alone
In the discussion of household management, we have 
assumed that the household consists of two or more people 
whose lives are intertwined. Questions about decision mak-
ing, consensus, and shared responsibilities are all raised in 
the context of a group of people living together. However, 
in 2007, about 31 million people in the United States lived 
alone. These one-person households were more likely to 
consist of men in the younger age groups (under 44) and 
women in the older age groups (45 and older; U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2010). Single-person households include people 
who have never married, are divorced or separated, and are 
widowed. The reasons for living alone and the backgrounds 
for this life pattern vary considerably.
Little is known about the differences in psychosocial 
development between adults who live alone and those 
who live with others. Some of the aspects of household 
this fi gure in context, 11% of children in two-parent fami-
lies had family incomes at 100% of the poverty level or less. 
Thus, children in single-mother families are 4 times more 
likely to live in poverty than children in two-parent families. 
Poverty in these families is the result of a number of factors: 
single mothers tend to have a lower earning capacity, they 
work fewer hours, and even when they receive some support 
from the child’s father, they bear a substantial portion of their 
children’s expenses.
In addition to stresses associated with poverty, single parents 
may suffer from social isolation, continuous pressure to meet 
the needs of their children, and experiencing overload in trying 
to combine work, parenting, and household decision making 
without a partner. How well can single mothers manage their 
parenting role in the face of their many role demands? Some 
studies emphasize a defi cit perspective—for example, identify-
ing factors that place children or adolescents from single-parent 
families at risk for antisocial behavior and delinquency (Bank, 
Forgatch, Patterson, & Fetrow, 1993). Other studies focus on 
adaptation and coping within the single-parent structure. They 
consider factors that help sustain a positive parent-child rela-
tionship, such as sharing a strong emotional connection with 
other family members, being able to help one another in con-
crete ways, talking with one another and listening, and spending 
time together as parent-child and with other family members 
(Simons, Beaman, Conger, & Chao, 1993; McCreary & Dancy, 
2004). Retrospective studies show that many children who are 
identified as having psychological problems, especially tem-
per tantrums, bullying, cheating, stealing, and fighting, are 
from divorced, single-mother families. However, prospective 
studies —those that look at childrearing practices and subse-
quent child outcomes—show that poor parenting practices, 
especially emotional unavailability, ineffective discipline, mini-
mal supervision, and a dominating, hostile style of interaction, 
produce these negative child outcomes in both single-parent 
and two-parent families (Patterson, 1992). Although single- 
parent families face many additional problems, it is clearly inac-
curate to label all of them as problem families.
Among single-mother families, one of the fastest grow-
ing subgroups is low-income women who have never been 
married (Casper & Bianchi, 2002). These women may be in 
cohabiting or serious romantic relationships, but for a vari-
ety of reasons they have rejected the idea of getting married. 
It is not that marriage is devalued; in fact, some argue that 
it is the high standards that these women have for marriage 
that makes them decide to stay single (Edin, Kefalas, & Reed, 
2004). Women want to be able to fi nd a partner whom they 
can trust to be faithful—someone who is not addicted to drugs 
or alcohol, who will treat them and their children with kind-
ness, and who will be able to contribute financially to their 
family. In many communities, this type of partner is diffi cult to 
fi nd. Rushing into a marriage with someone who does not have 
these qualities just because one has a child seems foolhardy. 
These women know of too many instances of couples who start 
out with great expectations and then run into job loss, infi del-
ity, abuse, drunkenness, or criminal behavior. Thus, for many

knows how important it is for Karen to have someone to help

to feel an obligation to contribute their resources, skills, 
and creativity to improving the quality of life for the young 
(de St. Aubin, McAdams, & Kim, 2004). To some degree, 
this motive is aroused as one recognizes the inevitability of 
mortality—that one will not be around forever to direct the 
course of events. Therefore, one must make contributions 
to the society, on both personal and public levels, that will 
stand some chance of continuing after one’s death.
There is an old story about three men who were observed 
laying bricks for the wall of a church. When asked what they 
were doing, the fi rst man said he was laying bricks, the sec-
ond said he was building a wall, and the third said he was 
building a church. As the story implies, during middle adult-
hood one must arrive at a philosophy of life that will impart 
signifi cance to daily activities. One part of generativity lies 
in the actual attainment of creative goals. The other part lies 
in the perspective one brings to one’s lifework, an outlook 
that appreciates the relationship of one’s life and one’s efforts 
to promoting well-being for the next generation. In contrast, 
stagnation reflects an outlook dedicated to preserving or 
embellishing one’s power and resources without regard for 
the impact of this self-centeredness on the long-term well-
being of the larger community.
Generativity
Generativity “encompasses procreativity, productivity, and 
creativity, and thus the generation of new beings, as well 
as of new products and new ideas, including a kind of self-
generation concerned with further identity development” 
(Erikson, 1982, p. 67). According to Erikson’s observations 
(Erikson et al., 1986), generativity is formed as a result of 
experiences of maintaining the world, nurturing and being 
concerned, and caring.
management, including organizing time, planning for the 
future, making decisions, and establishing relationships 
with other social groups, pose challenges to the person liv-
ing alone. On the other hand, assigning responsibility and 
establishing a pattern for group decision making clearly are 
not required. People who live alone may not feel the need 
to engage in elaborate planning and evaluation when they 
are the only ones who will be immediately affected by their 
choices. Therefore, they may be freer to decide spontane-
ously as each opportunity presents itself.
In summary, the developmental task of household man-
agement draws on many leadership skills in order to build 
a home environment that is comfortable, adaptive to chang-
ing demands, and responsive to the needs and goals of those 
who live together. The realm of the household is unique 
because it allows adults to perform with maximum fl exibility, 
creativity, and adaptability in response to the daily needs and 
long-term goals of the household members.
The Psychosocial Crisis: 
Generativity versus Stagnation
Objective 5. To explain the psychosocial crisis of gene-
rativity versus stagnation and the central processes 
through which the crisis is resolved: person-environment

The psychosocial crisis of generativity versus stagnation can be 
understood as a pressure on the adult to be committed to 
improving the life conditions of future generations (Erikson, 
1963). Generativity is critical to the survival of any society.

concern for self. As a complement to caring for others, the 
elder is also challenged to accept from others that caring 
which is required, and to do so in a way that is itself car-
ing. In the context of the generational cycle, it is incumbent 
upon the aged to enhance feelings of generativity in their 
caregivers from the younger generations. (Erikson et al., 
1986, pp. 74–75)
Measuring Generativity
The meaning of generativity is being clarified through 
attempts to measure it (Peterson & Stewart, 1993; Hawkins 
& Dollahite, 1997; McAdams & de St. Aubin, 1998). In a 
cross-sectional comparison of dimensions of generativity 
among participants in early (22–27), middle (37–42), and 
later (67–72) adulthood, four aspects of generativity were 
measured (McAdams, de St. Aubin, & Logan, 1993):
• Generative concern—A sense that one is making a differ-
ence in the lives of others
• Generative commitment—Personal strivings or goals that 
have a generative nature
• Generative action—A checklist of actions that the person 
has performed in the past 2 months that involved creat-
ing, maintaining, or offering
• Generative narrative—Autobiographical recollections 
coded for generative meaning
Based on these measures, the results suggest the following trends:
 1. Across all age groups, generative concern was signifi -
cantly correlated with happiness and life satisfaction.
 2. When all four measures of generativity were combined, 
the middle adults scored higher than the young or older 
age groups.
 3. The measures of generative commitment and generative 
narration were higher for the middle adult group.
 4. The pattern of responses showed signifi cant differences 
between the middle adult and the younger adult groups, 
but the middle adults and the older adults were not sig-
nifi cantly different.
One implication of these results is that once the genera-
tive orientation emerges, it appears to endure in the life goals 
and activities of a person into later adulthood.
The concept of generativity suggests a commitment to 
social involvement and community engagement. In a study 
designed to examine this relationship, generativity was 
assessed in a sample of African American and European 
American adults ages 34 to 65. Individual differences in gen-
erativity were associated with social support from family and 
friends, involvement in religious activities, and political par-
ticipation. Those individuals who scored higher in measures 
of generativity were also more likely to emphasize prosocial 
values in raising their children and were especially con-
scious of the way they served as role models for their chil-
dren. Within this sample, the African American adults were 
found to score signifi cantly higher on measures of generative 
concern and generative action than the European American 
It is worth pausing to consider what it means to gener-
ate. A basic dictionary defi nition is “to bring into existence.” 
Through generativity, adults may change the world by intro-
ducing new things, ideas, beings, or bonds of  relationship—
all of which had not existed before. Although Erikson 
directed us to the heightened importance of generativity for 
development in middle adulthood, it makes sense to view 
this critical capacity as emerging over the life course. Stew-
art and Vandewater (1998) suggested that generativity arises 
through three phases: (1) generative desire or motivation, 
(2) a belief in one’s capacity for generative action, and (3) a 
subjective sense of generative accomplishment.
Those adolescents whose parents have strong generative 
motives and who exhibit generative actions are likely to iden-
tify with these values and express generative concern in their 
own goals (Pratt, Norris, Hebblethwaite, & Arnold, 2008). 
This motive might be expressed in the formation of caring rela-
tionships with friends or siblings, as well as in the articulation 
of broader generative goals (Pratt, Arnold, & Lawford, 2009). 
For example, young people who want to promote better inter-
racial understanding or to improve the educational experiences 
of young children might be said to have generative motives. As 
adolescents and young adults begin to realize opportunities for 
generative action they are likely to experience a growing confi -
dence in the capacity to have an impact on the world.
Although there is an obvious link between generativity 
and the parenting role, parenting is by no means the only 
path to a sense of generativity. In a comparison of parents 
and childless adults, the link between generativity and psy-
chological well-being was equally strong for both groups 
(Rothrauff & Cooney, 2008). Generativity may be expressed 
through a wide variety of actions, including procreation, 
parenting, invention, teaching, mentoring in the workplace, 
expanding the knowledge base, improving the physical or 
social environment, and artistic creation (Kotre, 1995a; Clark 
& Arnold, 2008). Generativity may be expressed by mak-
ing a success of a remarriage involving children who have 
been neglected in their early childhood. It may be expressed 
through innovations in the workplace; in the scientist’s lab; 
in poetry, art, music, or literature; or in creating some splen-
did form of recreation, like a theme park, or a refreshing new 
food like frozen yogurt. In looking back on one’s life, one 
can assess these actions and make a judgment about whether 
one’s generative aspirations or motives have been realized.
Erikson suggested that the outcome of the crisis of gen-
erativity versus stagnation has implications for adults at the 
next life stage in the form of grand-generativity:
The reconciling of generativity and stagnation involves the 
elder in expressing a “grand-generativity” that is somehow 
beyond middle age’s direct responsibility for maintain-
ing the world. The roles of aging parent, grandparent, old 
friend, consultant, adviser, and mentor all provide the ag-
ing adult with essential social opportunities to experience 
grand-generativity in current relationships with people of 
all ages. In these relationships, the individual seeks to inte-
grate outward-looking care for others with inward-looking

CHAPTER 12 Middle Adulthood (34 to 60 Years) 
In the fall of 1999, I was encouraged to apply to the Women’s 
Health Leadership program by my former boss. At that time, 
my job was a hodgepodge of responsibilities, although I was 
beginning to focus more and more on policy work. I felt that 
I lacked direction and the tools to make changes in my job. I 
didn’t consider myself a “leader” even though my colleagues 
saw me as one. I wanted to be proactive in making posi-
tive changes in my job, so I decided to apply to WHL. What 
I didn’t expect was to learn as much about myself as I did 
about women’s health issues.
In 1997, I was diagnosed with metastatic cancer. Years 
earlier, I saw my father lose his battle with colon cancer, 
which he courageously fought for 12 years, and in 1999 
my brother was diagnosed with the same cancer. It has 
changed the way I think about my future. While work was 
important to me, I needed to set limits. While it may seem 
that participating in the WHL program would have added 
more stress to my life, it was just the opposite. Through 
WHL, I worked on an individual leadership development 
program that not only allowed me to be effective at my 
job by sharpening my skills and learning new ones but 
[also included] activities that I wanted to concentrate on 
outside of work. I spent more time having fun, learning 
new things, and spending quality time with my family 
and friends. WHL encourages personal and professional 
growth as well as teaching women to be advocates for 
themselves and other women in their community.
My major accomplishment was the creation of the 
Women’s Health Advocacy Guidebook. The guidebook is 
specific to Santa Clara County and is full of information 
on the gaps and barriers low-income, medically under-
served women face in Santa Clara County. It is a tool to 
help women’s health advocates understand the legislative 
process and how they can participate in the process. I 
distributed 40 guidebooks to women in my community 
and I have had such a positive response from them. The 
guidebook is something I wish I had when I began doing 
policy work.
Prior to WHL, I had never spoken about my experience 
with cancer. I did not fully understand or recognize the posi-
tive impact my story could have. I was always afraid that if 
I spoke about my cancer and my family’s experience with 
cancer people would just feel sorry for me, and that is the last 
thing I wanted. But WHL has taught me to take risks and to 
fi nd my voice. This past year, I have been a featured speaker 
in a “Living with Cancer” series in Santa Cruz; I submitted my 
cancer story to the San Jose Mercury News and it was printed 
with a picture of me and my dog on the front page; I was 
a panelist on assembly member Elaine Alquist’s “Women’s 
Health Forum”; and I was selected as one of 8 people to rep-
resent California and to provide testimony to the President’s 
Cancer Panel. Many people, especially women, have shared 
their experiences with me and I have felt so honored to listen 
to their stories.

adults, suggesting a cultural context for the support and 
value of generativity within various ethnic communities 
(Hart, McAdams, Hirsch, & Bauer, 2001).
Another approach to the measurement of generativity takes 
its inspiration from the construct of identity status, which was 
introduced in Chapter 10. In this view, generativity is defi ned 
as a commitment to “establish and guide the next generation 
through one’s acts of care” (Bradley, 1997; Bradley & Marcia, 
1998). Using a semistructured interview, individuals are char-
acterized along two dimensions: a person’s level of involve-
ment and active concern for the growth of the self and others, 
and a person’s level of tolerance for differences in values, ideas, 
and traditions, which refl ects the inclusivity of their generative 
concern. Using these two dimensions, generative status was 
described as fi tting into one of fi ve types:
• Generative: Vital involvement in growth for self and oth-
ers, and tolerance for a wide range of ideas
• Pseudogenerative-agentic: Active involvement in one’s 
own growth, and openness to a wide range of ideas for 
oneself but not for others
• Pseudogenerative-communal: Active involvement to pro-
mote growth and tolerance for ideas in others, but not for 
oneself
• Conventional: Active involvement in growth for oneself and 
others, but low tolerance for different ideas and values
• Stagnant: Low involvement in growth for oneself and oth-
ers and low tolerance for different ideas and values
This model expands the defi nition of generativity by mak-
ing a distinction between people who are committed to growth 
for their own immediate circle and those who are committed to 
growth for humanity or a wider and more diverse population. It 
recognizes a group of middle adults who are generative toward 
those who are part of their in-group, but not toward people 
whose ideas and values differ from their own.
The theme of generativity versus stagnation permeates the 
psychological dynamics of adult life. In the following sec-
tion, we discuss the negative pole, stagnation, and its expres-
sion in narcissistic self-preoccupation and depression. Since 
the mid-1980s, the severity of problems related to depres-
sion in adulthood have been documented, and several differ-
ent patterns have been described. Although much has been 
written about the negative side of adult life, including people 
who commit crimes or betray their families, it is important to 
recognize that the positive forces of generativity are equally 
dominant in guiding the lives of most adults and that they 
produce acts of creative leadership and caring.

Lourie Campos describes how a leadership training experi-
ence transformed her generative strivings into action.

 
The Psychosocial Crisis: Generativity versus Stagnation | 515
Consider the case of Bernie Madoff, who suddenly con-
fessed to years of money laundering that had resulted in the 
accumulation of billions in personal wealth.
So who was the real Bernie Madoff? And what could have 
driven him to choreograph a $50 billion Ponzi scheme, to 
which he is said to have confessed?
An easy answer is that Mr. Madoff was a charlatan of epic 
proportions, a greedy manipulator so hungry to accumulate 
wealth that he did not care whom he hurt to get what he 
wanted.
But some analysts say that a more complex and layered 
observation of his actions involves linking the world of 
white-collar fi nance to the world of serial criminals.
They wonder whether good old Bernie Madoff might 
have stolen simply for the fun of it, exploiting every rela-
tionship in his life for decades while studiously manipulat-
ing fi nancial regulators. (Creswell & Thomas, 2009)
Chronically depressed people do not feel a sense of 
accomplishment during middle adulthood—they think of 
themselves as worthless. They are unable to perceive them-
selves as having suffi cient resources to make any contribu-
tion to their society. These people are likely to have low 
self-esteem, doubt their opportunities for future improve-
ment, and are therefore unwilling to invest energy in con-
ceptualizing future progress. Adults who lack a belief in 
their own inner resources are vulnerable to chronic feelings 
of envy of others, which may be transformed into devalu-
ation of others, and feelings of resentment or vengeance 
( Navaro & Schwartzberg, 2007).
One of the most commonly noted sources of stagna-
tion in middle adulthood is role stagnation associated with 
employment. People who have been in their job a long time 
may be threatened by younger workers, stuck in a routine, 
or passed over for recognition and leadership. Rather than 
taking up the challenge to mentor new employees or to 
invent new approaches to their work, they become resent-
ful, avoidant, and withdrawn, and may develop physical or 
emotional symptoms associated with the stress of their frus-
tration (Clark & Arnold, 2008). The case of Lourie Campos 
illustrates how important the encouragement of professional 
development can be in forestalling stagnation and promoting 
continued generative growth in the workplace.
Middle adulthood extends over many years. During this 
stage, people encounter many complex challenges for which 
they may not be fully prepared. Promotion to an administra-
tive position, the need to care for an aging parent, and the 
negotiation of a divorce are examples. Brim (1992) argued 
that both success and failure force people to redefi ne and 
reexamine their goals. At many points, adults doubt their 
ability to move ahead, achieve their goals, or make meaning-
ful contributions. Feelings of stagnation surge temporarily.
People may recognize that unless they redefi ne their situ-
ation or take some new risks, the quality of their lives will 
deteriorate. They face the possibility of feeling outdated by 
CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. What kinds of changes did Lourie Campos experience 
as a result of the Women’s Health Leadership training 
experience?
 2. What evidence does the case provide about generative 
concern? Generative commitment? Generative action? 
Generative narrative?
 3. How did the experience of expanding her social network 
of professionals outside of her job contribute to Lourie’s 
psychosocial development?
 4. What lessons can be learned from this case about how 
to support and nurture a sense of generativity in middle 
adulthood and how to overcome feelings of stagnation?
 5. What role does the environment play in promoting gen-
erativity? Can you think of some examples of community 
programs or workplace initiatives that may foster psycho-
social development in adulthood?
Stagnation
Stagnation suggests a lack of psychological movement or 
growth. Those unable to cope with managing a household, 
raising children, or managing their career are likely to feel 
psychological stagnation at the end of middle adulthood. As 
suggested in the model of generativity statuses discussed pre-
viously, stagnation has been operationalized as an absence of 
investment in the growth of self or others and a rejection of 
ideas and values that differ from one’s own. Stagnation has 
been found to be a distinct construct, not simply the absence 
of generativity. Stagnation is positively associated with the 
personality characteristic of neuroticism, indicating high 
levels of worry, and negatively associated with the person-
ality characteristics of extraversion and openness to experi-
ence, indicating diffi culties in social relationships, problems 
achieving a sense of social acceptance, and being highly con-
trolled. Taken together, these characteristics suggest a person 
who is not only closed off to experiences with others, but is 
also lacking in the kinds of experiences that would promote 
self-development (Van Hiel, Mervielde, & DeFruyt, 2006).
The experience of stagnation may differ for the narcis-
sistic adult and the depressed adult. Narcissistic people—
adults who devote their energy and skills to the sole end of 
self-aggrandizement and personal satisfaction—are likely to 
have diffi culty looking beyond their own needs or experienc-
ing satisfaction in taking care of others. They are self-serving 
and defensive, expending energy to accumulate wealth and 
material possessions. They relate to others in terms of how 
people can serve them. Narcissistic people can exist quite 
happily until the physical and psychological consequences of 
aging begin to make an impact. At that point, and continuing 
toward old age, self-satisfaction is easily undermined by anxi-
eties related to death. It is not uncommon for such people to 
undergo some form of religious or humanitarian “conversion” 
after a serious illness or an emotional crisis forces them to 
acknowledge the limitations of a totally self-involved lifestyle.

CHAPTER 12 Middle Adulthood (34 to 60 Years) 
the kinds of transactions that occur between their person-
ality and their social milieu. They build families with life-
styles that suit the members. Making good decisions about 
social settings requires that they understand themselves, the 
nature of other people, and the social institutions that are 
part of their social environment. The degree of fi t between 
family needs and community characteristics helps support 
the essential functions of middle adulthood, including caring 
for children or aging parents, coordinating work and family 
life, and sustaining a vital marriage. When the community 
consists of other families facing similar tasks, the resources, 
mutual support, and validation for one’s life choices are 
likely to be greater (Swisher, Sweet, & Moen, 2004).
Although participation in some settings is a matter of 
choice, many others are the result of chance. Some settings 
can be abandoned or altered if they do not meet the indi-
vidual’s needs; other settings are permanent and diffi cult to 
alter. If one is in an unsuitable setting, one must be willing 
to leave it if possible or discover a way to infl uence it so that 
it meets one’s needs more adequately. Some people, how-
ever, fi nd themselves in social settings that can be neither 
abandoned nor altered. For example, a group of workers 
new technology, outmoded by new lifestyles, overburdened 
by role demands, or alienated from meaningful social con-
tacts. At these moments of crisis, adults may become entan-
gled in a process of self-protection and withdrawal that 
results in permanent stagnation. However, they may also be 
able to muster new resources and see things from a new per-
spective that will permit continuing growth and the expan-
sion of generativity.
The Central Process: 
Person-Environment 
Interaction and Creativity
Two aspects of the central process that lead to the devel-
opment of generativity in middle adulthood are person-
environment interaction and creativity. The first refers 
to ongoing experiences between the individual and the 
social environment, which includes the family, work set-
ting, neighborhood, and larger political community. Day-
to-day interactions, the expectations for behavior, the 
available resources, and the social supports that are neces-
sary for the growth of self-confi dence are elements of the 
social environment. The second part of the central process 
in the establishment of generativity is personal creativity. 
Although creativity has been defi ned in many ways, for our 
purposes we will defi ne it as the willingness to abandon 
old forms or patterns of doing things in favor of new ways. 
This requires the production, evaluation, and implementa-
tion of new ideas.
Person-Environment Interaction
Successful personality growth depends on the interaction 
between the demands of a person’s immediate environment 
and one’s own needs, skills, and interpersonal style. The 
concept of interaction suggests a potential for reciprocal 
infl uence between individuals and settings. Consequently, 
the structure and demands of settings may alter a person’s 
behavior, values, goals, and self-worth. People also have an 
impact on the settings in which they participate.
People have multiple identities and, as a result, partici-
pate in a variety of settings within their community. Adults 
do more than maintain or respond to their environments; 
they shape them. Those with higher status—that is, more 
resources and power—are more able to infl uence the quality 
of interactions they have with others in their environment. In 
turn, they are more likely to create conditions in which they 
receive validation for their identities because they are treated 
with greater respect and recognition from others for the roles 
they play (Stets & Harrod, 2004).
In creating their environments, adults decide whom they 
will marry, whether to have children, which occupation they 
will follow, and where they will live. To the degree that they 
have a choice in these matters, they are able to influence 
Some Chinese Americans choose to live and work in a Chinese 
ethnic community. They experience a sense of acceptance and 
support while contributing to the continuity of their cultural 
 heritage.

Creativity
The importance of a creative response, no matter how small, 
is that it redefi nes the world and opens the door to new pos-
sibilities. Although the idea of creativity tends to be associ-
ated with the arts, we are using the term in a broader sense to 
suggest a novel transformation in any of a variety of domains 
from the practical to the theoretical—from creating a new 
recipe to creating a painting, a dance, or a theory of human 
behavior. Through creative effort, adults impose a new per-
spective on the organization, expression, or formulation of 
ideas.
Creative adults are not dominated by social forces but 
are able to direct the course of events themselves. They are 
at a point in their development at which their own creative 
responses can become a source of infl uence on others. Think 
about the menopausal woman who referred to her fi rst hot 
flash as a power surge. Imagine the person who invented 
wheelchair basketball, or the person who invented Post-Its. 
Consider the infl uence of parents who, by creating a fl exible, 
open, and loosely structured home environment, nurture 
the self-expression of their children. Through the process of 
creative problem solving, adults help reshape the social and 
physical environments in order to meet both personal and 
social needs more satisfactorily.
Throughout middle adulthood, adults are faced with situ-
ations in family, childrearing, and work settings that provide 
stimuli for creative problem solving. In their efforts to take 
in Michigan were trained for employment in an automo-
tive plant. When the economy slumped, they were laid off. 
These workers did not have enough money saved to move 
to another town, there were no new jobs, and they did not 
have the resources or the incentive to retrain for other types 
of employment.
When one is forced to remain in social settings that are 
contrary to one’s needs, the possibility of developing genera-
tivity is seriously diminished. If one is unable to experience 
a personal sense of effectiveness at home, at work, or in the 
community, then one is unlikely to feel capable of contribut-
ing to future growth in these spheres. Fortunately, the social 
environment is so multifaceted that individuals are likely to 
experience satisfaction in their participation in at least one 
setting, even if they are dissatisfi ed in others. For example, 
people are likely to experience a sense of validation in their 
relationships with friends and close family members even 
when they have diffi culty experiencing recognition at work. 
Under these conditions, individuals can compensate for 
their inability to be generative in some settings by placing 
increased effort and investment in those in which they can 
more easily attain satisfaction. This may require that indi-
viduals reorder their priorities. If there is little opportunity 
to fi nd satisfaction in work, for example, one might begin 
to reinvest in contributions to one’s family, religion, or com-
munity. Creativity is required in order to fi nd a new balance 
among competing role demands while retaining a sense of 
joy and optimism.

traditional society, created a

CHAPTER 12 Middle Adulthood (34 to 60 Years) 
The Prime Adaptive Ego 
Quality and the Core 
Pathology
Objective 6. To defi ne the primary adaptive ego 
strength of care and the core pathology of rejectivity.
Implied in the concept of generativity is a moral directive to 
take care of and to care for and about the development of oth-
ers. As generativity is fully achieved and expressed in action, 
it will be linked to the prime adaptive ego quality of care 
(Leffel, Fritz, & Stephens, 2008). In contrast, experiences of 
stagnation are likely to be accompanied by the core pathol-
ogy of rejectivity—a defensive, self-protective outlook. The 
person who develops rejectivity blames the target of envy 
and possibly justifi es expressions of vengefulness or rage.
Care
The ego strength associated with the achievement of genera-
tivity is care. Care “is a widening commitment to take care 
of the persons, the products, and the ideas one has learned 
to care for. All the strengths arising from earlier develop-
ments in the ascending order from infancy to young adult-
hood (hope and will, purpose and skill, fi delity and love) 
now prove, on closer study, to be essential to the generative 
task of cultivating strength in the next generation, for this is 
indeed the ‘store’ of human life” (Erikson, 1982, p. 67).
Parenting contributes to the expansion of caring. Seven 
aspects of emotional development can be identifi ed as poten-
tial consequences of parenting. First, parenting brings a 
depth of commitment that is tied to the responsibility for the 
survival of a child. This depth of commitment is strength-
ened through the reinforcing nature of the child’s responses 
to attempts to meet his or her needs. Second, parenting 
brings adults into contact with new channels for express-
ing affection. Third, it requires that adults achieve a bal-
ance between meeting their own needs and those of others. 
Fourth, parenting enhances adults’ feelings of value and 
well-being through the signifi cant role they play in the child’s 
life. Fifth, parents achieve a degree of empathy for their child 
that widens the array of their emotional experiences. Sixth, 
parents may experience new levels of emotional intensity in 
reaction to their child’s behavior. Finally, many parents learn 
to help their children express and understand emotions. By 
playing a therapeutic role for their children, parents may 
become more effective in accepting and expressing their own 
emotions.
Not all adults experience the expansion of caring through 
parenting. The psychosocial achievement of middle adult-
hood is to identify the domains in which one has oppor-
tunities to infl uence the quality of the social environment, 
so that it becomes more hospitable, humane, nurturant, 
into account the requirements of the social setting and to be 
productive in it, people must develop creative plans. They 
must also attempt to carry out those plans—a task that may 
require further creativity. The essence of creative problem 
solving is to think outside the box—to resist defi ning the 
situation as it has been defi ned for you by others, then to 
formulate a new plan and translate the plan into action.
The roots of creativity can be found in childhood, in the 
semiotic, representational, playful thinking of toddlerhood. 
As-if thinking—the ability to imagine a situation in some dif-
ferent confi guration, to use objects to stand for something 
else, to give new names to familiar objects, to devise pri-
vate symbols for common experiences, to take on imagined 
roles—all these capacities of symbolic play are the founda-
tional building blocks of creativity. In our view, all humans 
are creative in the sense that they can pretend. All humans 
are creative when they cope effectively in a changing, unpre-
dictable environment. All humans are creative in that they 
can invent games, songs, tools, artifacts, or messages that are 
new to them. It is not so important that the creative act is 
new to the world, but that it is new to the person who is 
inventing it (Sternberg, Grigorenko, & Singer, 2004).
From the outset, the creative process involves frustra-
tions and risk. Typically, a creative solution is required 
because the standard way—the scripted way—is not work-
ing. In order to try new things, people must give up some 
old, reliable ways of thinking or behaving. In this process, 
people must anticipate the possibility that their efforts will 
fail. They may fl ounder for a seemingly long period, unable 
to identify the solution that will allow forward movement. 
They may worry about public embarrassment or humilia-
tion. Given one’s embeddedness in many demanding social 
roles, it is often diffi cult to step aside and view one’s situ-
ation from a fresh perspective. For some, the anxiety and 
self-consciousness associated with prolonged uncertainty 
and possible failure may be so great that creative solutions 
are never realized. Their creativity is blocked by a fear of the 
unknown, or by an inability to violate conventional norms 
of behavior.
For those who are not inhibited by the fear of failure, 
the achievement of a creative solution is invigorating. For 
the great creative geniuses—such as Sigmund Freud, Albert 
Einstein, Isadora Duncan, or Pablo Picasso—a breakthrough 
or a profound creative insight fueled their commitment to 
pursue the creative path with increased energy (Gardner, 
1993). Personal talent combined with an appreciation of the 
inadequacies of the current situation can lead to a signifi cant 
creative act, which then promotes future efforts. Creativity 
provides an outlet for caring for something that has not yet 
been defi ned or experienced. Repeated efforts to generate 
creative solutions eventually result in the formulation of a 
transforming philosophy of life. Through risk taking, occa-
sional failure, and a predominance of successful creative 
efforts, adults achieve a sense of what they believe in and 
what gives meaning to life. With this remarkable integration 
of experience and information, people enter later adulthood.

 
Discrimination in the Workplace | 519
and increasingly for women the mark of successful adult-
hood is frequently equated with success in the labor mar-
ket, which is typically attributed to personal characteristics 
of ability, intelligence, and motivation. Conversely, a lack 
of success in the labor market is attributed to defi ciencies 
in personal  characteristics—lack of ability, low intelligence, 
and poor motivation. Individuals are unlikely to attribute 
their successes to conditions of the workplace, vagaries in 
the economy, luck, or conditions of society that give them 
a special advantage and others an unfair disadvantage. Yet 
many Americans face serious and persistent disadvantages in 
the workplace that are linked to race, ethnicity, age, cultural 
practices, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disabil-
ity, or religion (MacLean, 2006).
Sex Discrimination
Promotion
Marilyn has worked as a sales clerk at a retail store for 
10 years but has been repeatedly denied the opportunity to 
advance. Men with less experience, including men that she 
trained and/or supervised, received the promotions instead.
Pay
Carla worked her way up from the position of cook’s helper 
to chef. Now another chef has been hired. He has similar 
training and work experience, but she fi nds out that he is 
being paid more than she is.
Sexual Harassment
Rita’s boss is the vice-president of the company. He repeatedly 
makes unwelcome comments about her body and routinely 
puts his arm around her waist when discussing work-related 
matters. Rita tells him his behavior makes her uncomfortable 
and asks him to stop. He says, “Maybe you are too uptight for 
this job. I probably should never have hired you.” Now Rita is 
afraid of losing her job if she doesn’t “loosen up” (equalrights
.org, 2010)
Race Discrimination
Hoping to become lieutenants, 77 New Haven fi refi ghters 
took a promotion test—but when none of the 19 Black fi re-
fi ghters qualifi ed, the city jettisoned the results. Their hopes 
dashed, 17 White fi refi ghters sued the city for racial discrim-
ination, and the case went to the Supreme Court (newser
.com, 2009).
Age Discrimination
Two years ago I worked at a nonprofi t organization and was 
the oldest person employed in that facility as a teacher. It 
was an experience that will stay with me for the rest of my 
life. Working with people that thought of you as being too 
or supportive of one’s own visions for the future. Caring 
expands in different domains for different people, but it 
always leads to having the welfare of people and enduring 
things (including ideas) deeply at heart. There is an action 
component to caring, in that people work to care for what 
they can. As the crisis of generativity versus stagnation is 
resolved in a positive direction, adults fi nd new energy and 
innovative ways to express their capacity for care.
Rejectivity
Caring strongly for certain people, products, and ideas can 
cause people to reject any person or group that appears to 
threaten them. Rejectivity refers to an unwillingness to 
embrace certain individuals, groups, or ideas in one’s circle 
of care and, at an extreme level, to view these threats as 
appropriate targets for hostility, even annihilation. Ironically, 
one may exhibit great courage and dedication to protect the 
objects of one’s care by directing intense aggression toward 
the objects that one rejects.
Erikson (1982) referred to this process as pseudospe-
ciation, in which one defi nes another group as different, 
dangerous, and potentially less human than one’s own. 
Under the rubric of pseudospeciation, family members can 
become scapegoats, neighboring communities can estab-
lish intense rivalries, racial or religious groups can terror-
ize others, and regions or countries can go to war. Thus, 
rejectivity goes beyond an intellectual selectivity of certain 
ideas and groups as more central to one’s identity than oth-
ers, taking on an aggressive energy, drawn from the power 
and authority of one’s status in middle adulthood. The 
risk of rejectivity for the society is that certain groups will 
become so powerful that they can cause the extermination 
or domination of other groups. As each subgroup falls out 
of the circle of caring, the society as a whole reaches a new 
level of stagnation.
APPLIED TOPIC 
Discrimination in the 
Workplace
Objective 7. To apply a psychosocial analysis to the 
issue of discrimination in the workplace, with special 
focus on the cost to society and to the individual when 
discrimination operates to restrict career access and 
advancement.
THE UNITED STATES has been characterized as an 
achieving society. As a cultural group, we value individual 
achievement, usually expressed through accomplishments 
in the world of work. Thus, in the United States, for men 

520 | 
CHAPTER 12 Middle Adulthood (34 to 60 Years) 
world of work is costly in economic terms—in lower lev-
els of productivity, high turnover, high levels of irritability 
and confl ict among workers, lawsuits, and less identifi ca-
tion with the company and its goals. It is costly in per-
sonal terms as well: Feelings of frustration about not being 
recognized for one’s competence or being passed over for 
promotion by less competent workers interfere with the 
development of a generative orientation. These experiences 
may lead to a more self-serving orientation, focusing exclu-
sively on self-protection or to a pervasive sense of futility 
about the future.
Disparities in Income and the 
Occupational Structure
In 2003, the median income of people who received 
an income, in constant 2003 dollars, was $17,422 for 
White women and $30,732 for White men; $16,581 for 
Black women and $21,986 for Black men; $13,642 for His-
panic women and $21,053 for Hispanic men. Women with 
bachelor’s degrees had median salaries that were 61% of 
those of men with the same degrees (U.S. Census Bureau, 
2006). In 2003, 24.4% of Blacks, 22.5% of Hispanics, and 
10.5% of Whites had incomes below the poverty level. 
Unemployment patterns showed that African Americans 
were more than twice as likely as European Americans to be 
unemployed (U.S. Census Bureau, 2006).
One explanation for the racial, ethnic, and gender differ-
ences in salary, rates of poverty, and rates of unemployment is 
that workers from different groups are distributed unevenly 
in the occupational structure. Jobs continue to be gender 
stereotyped, with women being socialized and encouraged 
to work in vocations that involve helping and serving others. 
For example, women were 46% of those employed in 2004. 
However, they made up 64% of those working in sales, 
offi ce work, and administrative support, and 57% of those 
in service occupations such as child care, food preparation, 
and service. On the other hand, women made up only 23% 
of chief executives, 14% of architects and engineers, and a 
small segment of the skilled trades where strong unions can 
protect salary scale and benefi ts (U.S. Census Bureau, 2006).
Group differences in occupational position that result in 
different salary structures and risks of layoffs are not neces-
sarily evidence of discrimination. Discrimination exists when 
two people doing the same job are paid substantially differ-
ent wages. It occurs when factors other than merit prevent 
a person from being hired, promoted, or rewarded through 
various forms of compensation or increase a person’s risk of 
being fi red. Specifi cally, discrimination occurs when a per-
son is evaluated on the basis of group membership rather 
than individual performance. In the workplace, this process 
operates as an in-group versus out-group dynamic, in which 
members of the in-group view members of the out-group 
as defi cient and, at some level, possibly threatening to their 
own continued success and well-being.

Overview of Discrimination
In the past, women and minority workers in the United 
States were restricted to low-paying jobs in the agricultural, 
service, or factory sectors. In 1964, the Civil Rights Act made 
it illegal to refuse to hire a person or discriminate in com-
pensation, fi ring practices, or any other employment ben-
efi ts based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 
This act made the practice of restricting access to employ-
ment opportunities illegal and opened up many arenas for 
professional development that had previously been denied to 
minorities (Hodson & Sullivan, 1995). With additional leg-
islation, other groups were included in the umbrella of legal 
protections. Currently, the U.S. Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission (EEOC) lists types of discrimination to 
include: age, disability, national origin, pregnancy, race, reli-
gion, and sex-based factors. This offi ce also addresses cases 
of retaliation against individuals who fi le charges of discrimi-
nation and cases of sexual harassment. The Civil Rights Act 
prohibits both intentional discrimination and otherwise neu-
tral workplace policies that disproportionately disadvantage 
persons of a certain age, race, disability, and so on (EEOC, 
2007).
Nonetheless, barriers to full and equitable involve-
ment in the labor market for women, minorities, and 
persons with disabilities as well as persons in other pro-
tected groups continue to exist (Robert & Harlan, 2006). 
For example, some women fi nd that their workplace sets 
limits on their achievement through gender-stereotyped 
assumptions about the woman’s commitment to her family 
role (Ridgeway & Correll, 2004). In these settings, women 
do not tend to be promoted to high-level administrative 
or managerial positions in which work demands would 
begin to invade family commitments. Some companies are 
reluctant to put married women in positions in which they 
may have to be transferred, for fear that their husbands will 
refuse to make the move.
In addition to blatant discrimination in hiring practices, 
working conditions, salary, and dismissals, individuals have 
to cope with subtle acts of discrimination such as margin-
alization, harassment, and rumors or fictionalized stories 
that are embarrassing or imply that they are incompetent. 
In 2006, over 23,000 charges of sex-based discrimination, 
including cases of sexual harassment and pregnancy discrim-
ination were fi led with the EEOC. In that same year, 27,000 
charges of race-based discrimination and over 15,000 
charges of disability-based discrimination were fi led with the 
EEOC.
Workplace discrimination is an exceedingly costly 
problem for the society as a whole. Discriminatory prac-
tices that lead to the disaffection of individuals from the

or that people of color are better suited to some types of 
jobs than others (Feagin & McKinney, 2003). In many 
organizations, one can observe what has been called racial 
segmentation—the creation of specific kinds of adminis-
trative positions that were created to carry out affirmative 
action agendas, community relations with specific racial 
or ethnic communities, or to promote the recruitment 
of minority employees (Forman, 2003). Because of the 
historical and continuing separation of neighborhoods, 
schools, and churches on the basis of race, few White 
adults have firsthand, personal relationships with people 
of color. Decisions about promotions or assignments to 
positions of increased responsibility are often made in 
situations where senior employees, mostly White, make 
decisions that do not take into account the values, beliefs, 
and practices of non-White groups.
Consider the following situation: “FedEx’s prohibition 
against individuals involved in customer contact from wear-
ing dreadlocks, beards, ponytails or braids had been com-
pany policy for years but it was not enforced until 1999 
when the Memphis, Tenn.-based company gave at least seven 
couriers who wore dreadlocks and worked in New York an 
ultimatum to cut them off or lose their jobs” (Cukan, 2001).
The employees were Rastafarians, who wear dread-
locks for religious reasons. They all offered to cover their 
hair with a hat or some other businesslike attire. How-
ever, FedEx refused this arrangement. The men were 
placed on a 90-day unpaid leave and then fi red because 
no noncustomer contact positions could be found. These 
men had worked for FedEx for 5 years and had excellent 
service records with the company. The state of New York 
sued FedEx for violation of antidiscrimination laws, argu-
ing that they fi red the employees based on their religious 
How Discrimination Perpetuates Itself
Employers, supervisors, and others in positions of power 
typically establish a normative profi le for their employees 
and judge each new employee against it. In some work set-
tings, the judgment about competence is equated with a 
willingness to dedicate long hours to the job, to be avail-
able at a moment’s notice, and to keep one’s cell phone on 
at all times, including evenings and weekends. Against this 
norm, women who are mothers are expected to direct their 
time and energy toward their parenting role and, thus, are 
often judged to be less committed and less competent work-
ers than women who are not mothers or than men who are 
fathers (Ridgeway & Correll, 2004). For example, in one 
study, participants rated women who were mothers as less 
competent—and thus less worthy of investing in hiring 
them, training them, or promoting them—than women who 
did not have children. Participants also rated women as less 
competent after they had children than before they became 
mothers (Cuddy, Fiske, & Glick, 2004).
These highly internalized norms about the ideal 
worker may include deeply held beliefs and values on 
the part of men about women. Men may wonder whether 
women can perform the same kinds of jobs as men and 
can effectively assume responsibility to supervise men, 
whether clients will place their trust in female executives, 
or whether women will be dedicated to their work when 
conflicts between work and family arise. In the same vein, 
these norms may include deeply held beliefs and values 
on the part of Whites about people of color—especially 
beliefs that they are superior to people of color in ability, 
that the cultural characteristics of people of color will be 
disruptive or damaging to productivity in the workplace, 
These blue collar workers 
have lost their jobs, and they 
are angry about it. Their jobs 
have been outsourced to 
other countries. They do not 
forsee new jobs that would be 
right for them emerging in the 
recovery. They have banded 
together in an organization 
through which they are assert-
ing their right to work.

CHAPTER 12 Middle Adulthood (34 to 60 Years) 
However, the history of the United States is also 
filled with many cases of individuals who succeed 
against the odds. These adults recognize the risks of 
staying in a setting that does not fit well with their 
healthy desire to create, produce, and care. They may 
strike out on their own by setting up their own com-
panies, they may challenge unfair practices through the 
courts, and they may mentor younger workers to help 
them cope with the conflicts they face in the workplace. 
The responsibility for coping with discrimination does 
not rest entirely on its victims. There are also examples 
of work settings that have taken active steps to challenge 
their own practices. Companies have been cited for their 
policies to support the hiring and promotion of women 
into senior positions, and for their innovations in weav-
ing new levels of understanding about diversity into all 
aspects of employee development. Companies are recog-
nizing that by being more visibly attuned to the interests 
and needs of culturally diverse communities, they can 
increase their brand reputation and increase their client 
base (Rodriquez, 2006).
The American workforce of the 21st century is becom-
ing increasingly diverse. Women and ethnic minorities are 
the fastest growing groups of new employees. An estimated 
13% of the workforce is composed of legal and illegal immi-
grants. In 2003, 24% of U.S. resident children under the age 
of 5 were children of color (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004b). 
Their preparation for and participation in the labor market 
will be a determining factor in the quality and productiv-
ity of the U.S. economy in the 21st century. The psychoso-
cial approach, which highlights the interdependence of the 
individual and the society, is dramatically illustrated in the 
connection between contemporary workplace policies and 
practices and their implications for the maturation of a sense 
of initiative and industry during childhood. Children who 
believe that their parents and other adult members of the 
community are thriving in work environments that respect 
and value them are more likely to make the commitment to 
schooling that is needed to participate fully when it is their 
turn to enter the labor market.
observances. In response, FedEx changed its policy, allow-
ing individuals to request an exception to the company’s 
policy regarding hairstyles in order to respect their reli-
gious beliefs. This example illustrates the continuing need 
for examination of workplace practices that create hostile 
or disrespectful environments for workers.
Psychosocial Analysis: 
Discrimination and Coping
In general, in discussing psychosocial development, one 
examines the outcome for the individual in achieving a posi-
tive resolution of the psychosocial crisis. But when consider-
ing discrimination in the workplace, one must also look at 
the consequences for a society. Discrimination in the work-
place is one expression of societal stagnation. It is a defensive 
posture, in which those in power try to protect their own 
status and profi ts by preventing members of less powerful 
groups from gaining a foothold. Rather than treating diver-
sity as a factor that can improve productivity in the work 
setting, discrimination operates to reduce it.
Over time, the fate of individuals who have been discrim-
inated against becomes a great cost to the society at large. 
Perceived discrimination in the workplace has been associ-
ated with lower job satisfaction, reduced life satisfaction, 
health problems, depression, and general anxiety (Feagin 
& McKinney, 2003). Some targets of discrimination give up 
and become chronically unemployed or underemployed, 
resulting in a loss of human capital. Others remain in a dis-
criminatory workplace, trying to get by, not making trouble, 
and yet operating behind a veil of caution. African Ameri-
can middle-class adults tell the same stories repeatedly about 
how much effort and energy they spend trying to help Euro-
pean American people feel comfortable with them (Whitaker, 
1993). Over time, this expenditure is both exhausting and 
deeply frustrating. One outcome of the various forms of dis-
crimination is the development within a person of an unspo-
ken resentment of work that may be communicated in some 
form to children, thus transmitting a cross-generational, cyn-
ical outlook on work.
Chapter Summary
During the middle adult years, people have an opportunity 
to make signifi cant contributions to their culture. Through 
work, home, childrearing, and other caring relationships, 
people express their own value orientations, moral codes, 
personalities, and talents. They grow more sensitive to the 
multiple needs of those around them and more skillful in 
infl uencing the social environment.
Objective 1. To examine the world of work as a context 
for development, focusing on interpersonal demands, 
authority relations, and demands for the acquisition of 
new skills; considering midlife career changes; examining 
the interaction of work and family life; and examining 
the impact of joblessness in middle adulthood.
The developmental tasks of middle adulthood are complex and 
require long-term persistence. During middle adulthood, people 
gauge their self-worth largely in relation to their contributions to 
complex social units, especially work, family, and community. 
Each task calls for a new level of conceptualization of the interac-
tion of the self with immediate and more remote social systems 
and an increased ability to balance one’s individual needs with 

 
Chapter Summary | 523
Objective 5. To explain the psychosocial crisis of 
generativity versus stagnation and the central processes 
through which the crisis is resolved: person-environment 
interaction and creativity.
The psychosocial crisis of the middle adult years—generativ-
ity versus stagnation—is really a moral crisis of commitment 
to a better way of life. The well-being of the community as a 
whole rests largely on the effectiveness of people in middle 
adulthood in reaching new levels of psychosocial maturity. 
The society must encourage adults to care for others besides 
themselves. The egocentrism of toddlerhood, early school 
age, and adolescence must eventually come to an end if the 
social group is to survive. In the same way that intimacy 
(giving oneself to another) requires identity, generativity 
(giving oneself to the next generation) requires love of spe-
cifi c others. Interpersonal sources of satisfaction are the pri-
mary forces propelling people toward a generative approach 
to society as a whole.
Objective 6. To defi ne the primary adaptive ego 
strength of care and the core pathology of rejectivity.
As generativity is fully achieved and expressed in action, it will 
be linked to the prime adaptive ego quality of care, a capacity to 
look after and promote the optimal development of others. In 
contrast, experiences of stagnation are likely to be accompanied 
by the core pathology of rejectivity—a defensive, self- protective 
outlook in which self-interest and self-aggrandizement are 
heightened by devaluing or degrading others.
Objective 7. To apply a psychosocial analysis to the 
issue of discrimination in the workplace, with special 
focus on the cost to society and to the individual when 
discrimination operates to restrict career access and 
advancement.
The applied topic of discrimination in the workplace provides 
evidence of societal stagnation. Often, it is middle adults in 
leadership positions who, by deliberate practice or informal 
example, set a tone that promotes the exclusion of certain 
workers on the basis of age, gender, racial or ethnic group, or 
other group characteristics. At the same time, others in middle 
adulthood suffer from discriminatory policies and are unable 
to reach the levels of achievement and contribution that their 
talents merit. Social policies and practices that interfere with 
individuals’ abilities to perform meaningful work or to achieve 
recognition and respect for their work pose a hazard to indi-
vidual psychosocial development and to the future of the social 
group. These practices, born from the core pathology of rejec-
tivity, act in opposition to the fundamental needs of a society 
to care about its members and foster the most optimistic ambi-
tions and goals possible in younger generations.
system goals. In the process of managing a career, one observes 
the bidirectional infl uence of individuals and their work set-
tings. Occupational environments have an impact on the cog-
nitive, interpersonal, and emotional development of middle 
adults; and middle adults infl uence work settings through their 
positions of authority, leadership, and the achievement of new 
levels of expertise. One of the signifi cant challenges of middle 
adulthood is the effective balancing of work and family life.
Objective 2. To examine the process of maintaining a 
vital, intimate relationship in middle adulthood, especially a 
commitment to growth, effective communication, creative 
use of confl ict, and preserving passion.
Happiness in an intimate relationship is a cornerstone of 
well-being in middle adulthood. The establishment and 
preservation of close, nurturing relationships require ego 
strengths of the partners, effective communication strategies, 
a commitment to the future of the relationship, and creative 
strategies for preserving passion and excitement within a 
framework of close companionship.
Objective 3. To describe the expansion of caring in 
middle adulthood as it applies to two specifi c roles—that 
of a parent and that of an adult child caring for one’s 
aging parents.
The maturity and commitment to care of those in middle 
adulthood are closely linked to the psychosocial well-being 
of children as well as the elderly. Through parenting, adults 
create the supportive environment for children’s safety, 
health, and development. The quality of the parental alliance 
provides the model that children observe and internalize as 
they conceptualize the nature of adult relationships. Through 
their relationship with their aging parents, adult children can 
support their parents’ optimal functioning and, at the same 
time, grow in their understanding of the challenges of aging.
Objective 4. To analyze the tasks required for effective 
management of the household and the diversity of 
households, including blended families, single-parent 
families, and adults who live alone.
Management of the household involves the creation of a safe, 
stimulating, and comforting environment for those who live 
there. The capacity to maintain a household and nurture 
those who live there is linked to the middle adult’s ability to 
identify needed resources, and to create the network of rela-
tionships that will support the members of the household. 
The skills that are needed to achieve these goals will differ 
depending on the structure of the household and the ages, 
abilities, and relationships of the household members.

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
IN THIS CHAPTER and the next, we consider the chal-
lenges, changes, and new avenues for development in 
later life. This chapter focuses on the period from 60 to 
75; the next chapter focuses on the years from 75 to the 
end of life. The French refer to the years from 60 onward 
as the troisième age, the third stage of life (Rubenstein, 
2002). One can think of the fi rst 30 years of life as a pe-
riod of construction and learning, when many avenues 
are open and the person is building the skills and knowl-
edge to engage in the roles of adulthood. The second 
30 years, from 30 to 60, are a period of enactment, when 
commitments established during identity formation are 
translated into roles and relationships. In this period, life 
is shaped by the interaction of work, family, and commu-
nity demands and expectations. The individual strives to 
achieve personal ambitions and goals, and to meet cul-
tural expectations for maturity while coping with planned 
and unexpected changes in adjoining systems. The fi nal 
30 years are a period of reinvention. For many, this stage 
of life brings a gradual release from the daily demands 
of work and family and, depending on one’s health and 
resources, provides the opportunity to invent a new life 
structure. This is a time when one faces both signifi cant 
adversity and great joy.
Psychosocial theory assumes that new opportunities 
for growth emerge at each life stage. In strong contrast 
to the stereotype of aging as an undesirable process as-
sociated with accumulated defi cits and decline, these 
chapters highlight continuous growth through coping 
and adaptation. Like each of the preceding stages, later 
adulthood is marked by stressors, risks, and forces that 
can disrupt growth.
However, the epigenetic principle implies that one can-
not understand the full unfolding of human life  without 
appreciating the beliefs, practices, and social relation-
ships of those in later adulthood and old age. Moreover, 
the interdependence of the stages in a human life story 
suggests that the ways in which older adults function and 
are treated will have immediate impact on the psychoso-
cial development of individuals in all the earlier periods of 
life. The courage and vitality of older adults are sources 
of inspiration that motivate children and younger adults 
to continue facing the challenges of their daily lives with 
optimism.
The integrating theme of later adulthood is a search 
for personal meaning. On entering this stage, adults draw 
on the competence and creativity attained during middle 
adulthood to invent solutions to their changing con-
ditions. As life progresses, motivation for achievement 
and power may give way to a desire for understanding 
and experimenting with new roles and relationships. The 
toddler’s need to know why and the later adolescent’s 
need to challenge and experiment with life roles provide 
earlier models for the coping skills required in later life. 
The individual continues to be confronted with essen-
tial problems of defi nition and explanation during later 
adulthood. At this stage, adults apply the wealth of their 
life experiences, their perspective on time, and their ad-
aptation to life crises to construct personally satisfying 
answers to the questions of life’s meaning.
Physical, social, emotional, and intellectual develop-
ments are intricately interrelated during later life. The 
more research is carried out on aspects of aging, the 
greater the appreciation for the fact that patterns of ag-
ing are neither universal nor irreversible. For example, 
although many older adults become more sedentary 
and lose aerobic capacity, others continue to perform 
strenuous labor and remain free from heart disease

Chapter Objectives

 
Developmental Tasks | 529
For people in the United States who were 65 years old 
in 2006, the average life expectancy was an additional 
17 years for men, and an additional 19.7 years for women 
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2010, Table No. 103). Major im-
provements in hygiene, nutrition, preventive medicine, 
and medical treatments and technologies have allowed 
more people to experience a vigorous later adulthood 
today than was true 70 years ago. As a result, more and 
more people are facing the developmental tasks of later 
adulthood and elderhood. ■
and respiratory diffi culties. Many life conditions, espe-
cially poverty, malnutrition, poor sanitation, and limited 
health care, can accelerate the aging process. Other life 
conditions, such as access to a stimulating social envi-
ronment, participation in a program of physical activ-
ity, and a well-balanced diet, can increase physical and 
intellectual functioning (Rowe & Kahn, 1998). It is es-
sential to keep in mind individual differences in physi-
cal and mental health when thinking about patterns of 
growth in later adulthood.
Developmental Tasks
The tasks discussed here refl ect major themes that are likely to 
be confronted in the later years of life: accepting one’s life and 
achieving a sense of life satisfaction; promoting intellectual 
vigor; redirecting energy to new roles and activities; and devel-
oping a point of view about death. These themes suggest new 
barriers to adaptation as well as new opportunities. Changes in 
memory and speed of neural processing may make the accom-
plishment of daily tasks more diffi cult. Role loss and the death 
of loved ones stimulate needs for new kinds of support and 
changes in daily lifestyle. They also convey a concrete message 
that a new period of life is under way. Success in these tasks 
requires considerable psychological effort. As the more struc-
tured roles of parent and worker become less demanding, a 
person has to fi nd new sources of personal meaning and a new 
pattern to daily life. In some cultures, aging takes place in a 
context of reverence and high regard, which makes the loss of 
certain instrumental activities less signifi cant. In other cultures, 
emphasis on autonomy, instrumentality, and achievement form 
a challenging context for the preservation of dignity in late life.
Accepting One’s Life
Objective 1. To explore the construct of life satisfaction 
in later adulthood and the factors associated with 
subjective well-being.
One of the significant challenges of aging is learning to 
accept the reality of one’s life and formulate a vision of this 
new phase of later adulthood.
“Weren’t you ever afraid to grow old?” I asked.
“Mitch, I embrace aging.”
“Embrace it?”
“It’s very simple. As you grow, you learn more. If you stayed 
at twenty-two, you’d always be as ignorant as you were at 
twenty-two. Aging is not just decay, you know. It’s growth. 
It’s more than the negative that you’re going to die, it’s also 
the positive that you understand you’re going to die, and that 
you live a better life because of it.” (Albom, 1997, p. 118)
By later adulthood, evidence about one’s successes and 
failures in the major tasks of middle adulthood—marriage, 
childrearing, and work—has begun to accumulate. Data by 
which to judge one’s adequacy in these areas are abundant. 
The process of accepting one’s past life as it has been may 
be a diffi cult personal challenge. One must be able to incor-
porate certain areas of failure, crisis, or disappointment into 
one’s self-image without being overburdened by a sense of 
inadequacy. Individuals also must be able to take pride in 
areas of achievement, even when those accomplishments 
fall short of personal expectations. At the same time, older 
adults face the work of defi ning new goals for the future. The 
discussion that follows provides a model for conceptualizing 
how older adults establish a satisfying approach to achieving 
important goals in light of changing resources.
The SOC Model
Over the life span, people confront the challenges of balanc-
ing and matching a variety of opportunities with fluctua-
tions in resources (Freund & Baltes, 1998). At every period 
of life, there are limited resources—whether time, energy, or 
money—to address all the opportunities that present them-
selves. For example, in later adulthood, a person may want 
to continue to work (an opportunity) but fi nd that a chronic 
heart condition makes it difficult to bring the required 
energy and resilience to the task (loss of a resource). Accord-
ing to the SOC model, adaptation requires the integration of 
three processes:
Selection: Identifying the opportunities or domains of ac-
tivity that are of the greatest value or importance.
Optimization: Allocating and refi ning resources in or-
der to achieve higher levels of functioning in the selected 
domains.

orientation, and goal-related activities that are aligned with 
achieving valued goals (Figure 13.1).
Goal Domains. What are the achievements that stand out 
as important areas of accomplishment in later adulthood? 
Studies of life goals and life satisfaction present different 
typologies of life goals. In one international study that com-
pared older adults in the United States and Holland, four 
domains were relevant to both groups: job or daily activ-
ity goals; social contact and family goals; health goals; and 
income goals. Across the two cultures, attainment of social 
contact and family goals were the strongest predictor of 
overall life satisfaction (Kapteyn, Smith, & van Soest, 2010). 
Other studies include self-reliance or autonomy goals, and 
leisure time and physical activity goals in their analyses of 
the link between life goals and life satisfaction (Straechen, 
Brawley, Spink, & Glazebrook, 2010; Wong & Lou, 2010).
Individuals show different patterns of investment in these 
goal domains, and in the specifi c activities or achievements 
within domains. To some extent, a person’s profi le of mean-
ingful goals takes shape in the stages of later adolescence 
and early adulthood. At that time, individuals are crystalliz-
ing their identity and creating a lifestyle. The combination 
of one’s culture and life experiences shapes an imagined self, 
moving into the future. As a person begins the process of 
accepting one’s life in later adulthood, there is a tendency 
to return to the personal goals that were envisioned at that 
earlier time of life in order to assess the extent to which they 
were realized, and perhaps to reevaluate their importance 
given the 40 years or more of life that have transpired since 
these goals were formed (Cappeliez, 2008).
Goal Orientation. In addition to the specifi c goals one 
aspires to, the literature suggests that people differ in their 
goal orientation. Some people are more agentic in their 
goal strivings. Their important goals focus on achievement, 
power, and the expression of personal abilities. Other people 
In later life, adults are inevitably faced with changes in 
resources. They may have more time but less physical stam-
ina and fewer fi nancial resources. Life satisfaction and a sense 
of well-being are linked to selecting specifi c goals as impor-
tant areas of functioning and then effectively directing both 
internal (e.g., energy, thought, planning) and external (e.g., 
hiring help, taking classes, technical assistance) resources in 
order to maximize their level of functioning. Demographic 
factors alone—such as gender, race, age, and income—are 
not adequate predictors of life satisfaction. Instead, well-
being rests on an ability to manage or reduce the impact of 
stressful life events by directing resources in order to con-
tinue engaging in valued roles and activities (Hamarat et al., 
2001; Salvatore & Sastre, 2001).
Life Goals and Life Satisfaction
Many older adults have high levels of life satisfaction even 
though they face serious stressors and physical limitations 
(Brandtsadter, 2002). In part, this is due to their ability to 
achieve or realize important personal goals, and in part it 
is due to the ability to modify or adjust their goals in light 
of changing resources. Goals are characterized as linked to 
daily actions, related to desired states in the present or the 
future, and controllable, at least in so far as the person can 
choose to invest resources in certain goals or not (Mayser, 
Schelbe, & Riediger, 2008).
In later adulthood, individuals continue to aspire to new 
goals and strive to achieve new levels of optimal function-
ing. A person’s life goals and needs may change over the 
course of later adulthood, depending on life circumstances. 
Rather than viewing satisfaction in later adulthood in terms 
of wrapping things up and facing a roleless, undifferentiated 
future, older adults continue to formulate personal goals 
and assess their current life satisfaction in light of how well 
they are able to achieve those goals. In order to appreciate 
the link between life goals and life satisfaction, it is impor-
tant to consider three aspects of life goals: goal domains, goal

Developmental Tasks | 531
Orville Brim’s father illustrates, many of the basic motives for 
goal pursuits may remain the same over time, but the imple-
mentation of specific activities may change as a person’s 
physical health or endurance declines with advanced age.
CASE STUDY
GOAL ADJUSTMENT IN LATER ADULTHOOD
Orville Gilbert Brim, who contributed to the fi eld of human 
development through his work on social role theory (see 
Chapter 3), became increasingly interested in ambition and 
self-directed goal attainment in adulthood. He describes his 
father’s successful adaptations in later life as an example of 
this process (Brim, 1992).
Brim’s father, also named Orville, lived to be 103. He was 
born in a small farming community in a rural area of Ohio in 
1883. After receiving his bachelor’s degree in education at 
Valparaiso University, he taught school in a one-room school-
house for 2 years and then became principal of a high school 
in Indiana. Eventually he left the rural Midwest to attend Har-
vard and then Columbia to get his PhD. He was a professor at 
Ohio State University until he retired at age 60. Then Orville 
and his wife, Helen, bought an abandoned farm of several 
hundred acres in Connecticut, remodeled the farmhouse, 
and settled into farming. In the early years of retirement, he 
cleared and thinned the trees on the hills and mountains of 
his farm. After a while, he stopped working the hillsides and 
planted a large vegetable and fl ower garden. Orville tilled 
the garden with a power tiller. When he was 90, he bought 
a riding tractor. When he could no longer manage the large 
garden, he focused on a small border garden and four large 
window boxes that he planted with fl owers. As his eyesight 
are more communal in their goal strivings. Their goals focus 
on intimacy, affi liation, and contributions to the moral com-
munity (Pohlmann, 2001). Other studies have contrasted 
goals that seem to emphasize self-preservation with those 
that focus on the interest in and well-being of others. One 
might look back at the psychosocial crisis of middle adult-
hood, generativity versus stagnation, and consider that the 
profi le of goals emerging from that period of life might differ 
for those who resolved the crisis in the direction of genera-
tivity compared to those who resolved it in the direction of 
stagnation (Lapierre, Bouffard, & Bastin, 1997).
Goal-Related Actions. As people make progress on the 
developmental task of accepting their life, they are able to 
integrate their goals and their goal-related activities in order 
to experience a sense of personal fulfi llment. For those in 
later adulthood who have a strong sense of self-directed 
goal attainment, sentiments of life satisfaction feed back into 
life goals, strengthening their sense of purpose and provid-
ing renewed energy. Activities that are not satisfying or that 
bring negative social exchanges will be abandoned in favor 
of activities that are enjoyable and that contribute to feelings 
of confi dence or well-being. With age, it appears that a per-
son’s goals become more supportive of each other, so that 
one activity, for example, joining a book club, can provide 
support for both intellectual goals and social goals; spend-
ing time with grandchildren can be an opportunity to experi-
ence family support and physical activity. Older adults fi nd 
that their goals support each other, and that they can invest 
more energy into personal goal pursuits as their obligations 
to other competing roles and role demands decline (Riediger, 
Freun, & Baltes, 2005). The more closely a person is able to 
match activities with valued goals, the greater the person’s 
life satisfaction (Halisch & Geppert, 2001). As the case of 
Ray and Carla have more time 
for each other now that they 
are getting closer to retire-
ment. Their happiness as a 
couple is an important source 
of life satisfaction.

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
Personality and Well-Being
We all know people who have lived diffi cult lives yet appear 
to be full of zest and enthusiasm. We also know people who 
appear to have had the benefi ts of many of life’s resources 
yet are continually complaining about problems. Whether 
specifi c events will contribute to feelings of satisfaction or 
dismay depends in part on how they are interpreted. Some 
people are more likely to be grumblers; others are more 
likely to be celebrants of life. In response to this reality, some 
researchers have looked to personality factors to predict 
subjective life satisfaction in later adulthood (Ryff, Kwan, & 
Singer, 2001). The construct of personality, which is typi-
cally viewed as stable across situations, provides ways of 
understanding individual differences in coping, goal orien-
tation, and self-evaluative processes. Personality dimensions 
interact with changing life tasks to produce individual differ-
ences in the ways these tasks are interpreted.
A number of personality characteristics have been linked 
with life satisfaction in later life, including extroversion, 
openness to experiences, lack of neuroticism, usefulness/
competence, optimism, a sense of humor, and a sense of 
control. Extroversion includes such qualities as sociability, 
vigor, sensation seeking, and positive emotions. People who 
are outgoing and enjoy social interaction tend also to report 
high levels of life satisfaction (Costa, Metter, & McCrae, 
1994). Openness to experience includes characteristics 
such as curiosity, imaginativeness, and enthusiasm about 
exploring different music, art, foods, travel, or points of view. 
Older adults who are open to ideas and to feelings are more 
likely to have a high level of life satisfaction, because they 
seek and take advantage of the novelty and unpredictabil-
ity of their lives (Stephen, 2009). A personality dimension 
described as neuroticism is characterized by anxiety, hostil-
ity, and impulsiveness. People who are neurotic experience 
discouragement, unhappiness, and hopelessness. For them, 
real-life events are screened and interpreted through a nega-
tive fi lter, resulting in low levels of satisfaction.
A personality factor associated with well-being and high 
self-esteem in older adults is usefulness/competence. This 
quality is associated with informal volunteer work, higher 
levels of involvement with others, and a greater sense of 
purpose and structure in the use of time (Ranzijn, Keeves, 
Luszcz, & Feather, 1998). Continuing to work in later adult-
hood may also contribute to this sense of usefulness/compe-
tence, or perhaps those who have a high sense of usefulness/
competence choose to work longer. Those older adults who 
take on the role of mentor for new or younger workers can 
enhance their sense of life satisfaction through this role to 
the extent that it creates opportunities to feel useful, to be 
involved as a valued resource, and to achieve their own 
career goals in this relationship (Stevens-Roseman, 2009).
Optimism is another predictor of life satisfaction. Opti-
mism is a belief that one’s decisions will lead to positive con-
sequences and that uncertain situations will turn out well. 
Under conditions of uncertainty and stress, adults who are 
optimistic have less depression, greater hopefulness, and, 
became more impaired, he shifted from reading to listen-
ing to “talking books,” and when he had to give up actually 
planting the window boxes, he enjoyed watering them and 
looking at the fl owers. Orville approached each new chal-
lenge of physical decline by correctly assessing his abilities, 
investing in a new project, and taking pride in his achieve-
ments within that domain.
CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. In this case, Brim’s father drew on early life experiences grow-
ing up on a farm to guide his goals in later adulthood. What 
are some other examples of how earlier life roles might be 
integrated into a satisfying lifestyle in later  adulthood?
 2. Based on the information provided, what do you think 
 Orville Brim Sr.’s goals were in the later part of his life?
 3. What are some of the resources Brim’s father had that 
 allowed him to achieve new goals for mastery?
A basic element in life satisfaction is the sense of belong-
ing, a fact that has been supported by a wide range of 
research across life stages (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). In 
later life, social relationships are a primary source of plea-
sure and meaning, and are an avenue for active engagement. 
People who experience loneliness or an inadequate social 
network are much less satisfi ed with life than those who per-
ceive themselves to be positively connected to a meaning-
ful circle of loved ones and friends (Gow et al., 2007). In 
the context of marital relationships, high levels of confl ict 
are associated with depression and lower life satisfaction for 
both men and women (Whisman et al., 2006). Even though 
social connection is a source of life satisfaction in later adult-
hood, negative relationships and ongoing exposure to inter-
personal confl ict can disrupt feelings of satisfaction.
In a longitudinal study, men who had participated in the 
Terman Study of Gifted Children when they were in early child-
hood were interviewed about their life satisfaction at ages 58 
to 72. Four styles of adaptation emerged: (1) poorly adjusted, 
(2) career focused but socially disengaged, (3) family focused, 
and (4) well rounded. Three family experiences from early 
childhood and adolescence, including parent-child attachment, 
family socioeconomic status, and early parental divorce, were 
associated either directly or indirectly with life satisfaction in 
later life (Crosnoe & Elder, 2004). In addition, contemporary 
factors including health and socioeconomic resources were 
generally predictive of life satisfaction for the group as a whole. 
Goals related to family life and religious life provided a greater 
sense of meaning, social benefi ts, and emotional support than 
occupational goals, especially for the family-focused and well-
rounded groups (Crosnoe & Elder, 2002b). The family-focused 
and well-rounded groups had many areas of similarity, as did 
the career-focused and poorly adjusted groups. There is some 
suggestion that people who place too great a priority on occu-
pational attainment during middle adulthood may fi nd it dif-
fi cult to reorient toward satisfying life goals in later adulthood.

 
Developmental Tasks | 533
A chronic illness, such as arthritis, may result in a signifi cant 
loss of control and reduced opportunities for physical activ-
ity or social interaction. A person who is characterized by 
a neurotic personality may be more discouraged and embit-
tered by these losses than one who is optimistic or agreeable. 
A person whose leisure activities have focused on physical 
activities, such as skiing or running, may fi nd the restric-
tions of arthritis more frustrating than someone whose hob-
bies and lifestyle are more sedentary. In a study of more than 
3,000 U.S. adults, the personality traits of conscientiousness 
and neuroticism were found to be associated with mental and 
physical health. Adults who were more conscientious had 
reduced risks of health problems, whereas those who were 
more neurotic had increased risk. Among adults with diag-
nosed physical illnesses, those who were conscientious were 
less likely to be limited by these conditions. One explanation 
for this association is that the more conscientious a person is, 
the more likely the person will follow a recommended plan 
of treatment and to incorporate recognized healthy behaviors 
into daily life (Goodwin & Friedman, 2006). Another inter-
pretation is that those who are more neurotic are also more 
likely to alienate their social support system, thereby losing 
the important functions of social support that are associated 
with health and life satisfaction (Berger, Donoho, & Way-
ment, 2009).
as a result, a greater sense of well-being (Chang & Sanna, 
2001). In contrast, those who are pessimistic experience 
more social strain, have lower social support, and as a result, 
are likely to have lower life satisfaction (Luger, Cotter, & 
Sherman, 2009).
Along with optimism, a sense of humor has been found 
to predict life satisfaction. Given the many changes associ-
ated with aging, it helps to see events as amusing rather than 
embarrassing or demeaning. Older adults who have a good 
sense of humor are likely to experience life in a more playful, 
engaged way, even if they view life as somewhat more absurd 
(Ruch, Proyer, & Weber, 2010).
A sense of control is systematically associated with life 
satisfaction (McConatha, McConatha, Jackson, & Bergen, 
1998). Life experiences such as engaging in physical activity, 
the opportunity to select one’s leisure activities, or the ability 
to decide when to retire are all examples of factors that can 
improve an older adult’s sense of control. Loss of fi nancial 
resources and social support or reduced physical resilience 
can diminish this sense. Taken together, one might infer that 
people who are extroverted, open to new experiences, opti-
mistic, experience a sense of usefulness, have a good sense of 
humor, and feel that they are in control of events in their life 
will also express high levels of satisfaction.
Illness and Health
Experiencing a sense of well-being and acceptance of one’s 
life is associated with physical health. In addition to an 
increase in vulnerability to acute illnesses, such as infl uenza, 
more than 80% of people over the age of 65 have at least 
one chronic condition such as arthritis, hypertension, coro-
nary heart disease, diabetes, or cancer. Chronic illnesses are 
long-lasting and can be characterized by periods of intense 
illness followed by periods of remission or progressive 
decline. The most common chronic conditions in the 65 to 
74 age range are arthritis, hearing impairments, heart condi-
tions, and high blood pressure (Warshaw, 2006).
Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and 
women in the United States. However, it begins about 10 
years earlier for men than for women. After menopause, the 
risk of heart disease for women increases. Moreover, women 
are less likely than men to be accurately diagnosed as suf-
fering from a heart attack, less likely to recover from it, and 
more likely to suffer the complications of stroke. The life-
style factors associated with heart disease are about the same 
for men and women. However, men are more likely to be at 
risk because they do not get the physical activity they need, 
eat more meat and fat and less fruit and fi ber than women, 
are less likely to go to the doctor for regular checkups, and 
are generally more likely to deny being sick (Guttman, 1998; 
Harvard Health Publications, 2007).
Longitudinal studies of men consistently fi nd that cur-
rent health status and functional autonomy are signifi cant 
predictors of life satisfaction (Berger, Donoho, & Wayment, 
2009). However, the relationship of health to life satisfaction 
is mediated by personality, resources, and personal goals.

In his later life, Renoir suffered from severe arthritis. To compen-
sate, he tied paintbrushes to his hands so that he could continue 
to function in this highly valued domain.

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
Problems in Defi ning and Studying 
Intelligence in Later Adulthood
The primary goals in the study of development are to 
describe and explain patterns of change and continuity over 
time. Four problems arise in evaluating the research on intel-
ligence in later life (Stuart-Hamilton, 1996). First, one must 
differentiate between age differences and age changes. 
Suppose that in a cross-sectional study conducted in 2000, 
70-year-olds performed less well on tests of fl exible problem 
solving than 40-year-olds. The difference may be clear, but 
it may not be a result of age alone. The 70-year-olds would 
have been born in 1930, and the 40-year-olds in 1960. 
Differences in performance may be a product of different 
educational opportunities, varying experiences with stan-
dardized tests, or other cohort-related factors. Educational 
opportunities increased markedly during the 20th century, 
so that younger cohorts are much more likely to have ben-
efi ted from formal schooling at both the high school and col-
lege levels (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000). For example, 
only 10% of people ages 65 to 74 in 2000 had completed a 
bachelor’s degree, whereas 18% of adults ages 35 to 44 had 
attained this level of education. In the older cohort, 26% 
had not graduated from high school, compared to 11% in 
the younger cohort. Advanced education is associated with 
greater reflectiveness, flexibility, and relativistic thinking. 
People who have attended college have been exposed to the 
scientifi c process as a way of gaining knowledge and, as a 
result, are more likely to consider that their understanding of 
the world is tentative pending new information or new tech-
nologies (King & Kitchener, 1994; Labouvie-Vief & Diehl, 
2000).
In cross-sectional studies of cognitive functioning, histori-
cal factors may be confounded with developmental or aging 
factors that may contribute to observed differences in per-
formance. In longitudinal studies that follow change over 
time, if only one cohort is sampled, it is impossible to tell 
whether changes from one period to the next are products of 
age and development or a result of fl uctuations in resources 
and challenges faced by that particular generation.
A second problem is the defi nition of abilities. Cognitive 
functioning is a broad term that encompasses such var-
ied abilities as vocabulary, problem solving, and short-term 
memory. It is possible that the pattern of change in abilities 
with age depends on which abilities are tested. Some abili-
ties are frequently used and have been developed to a high 
level of effi ciency. For example, an architect is more likely 
to retain abilities in spatial relations and reasoning than is 
someone whose work is not intimately connected with the 
construction and organization of spatial dimensions.
A third related problem is the relevance of the tasks used 
to measure adult cognitive functioning. The definition of 
intelligence that is used in the design and application of 
most intelligence tests refers to capacities that are predic-
tive of school-related success. The criteria for assessing adult 
intelligence are necessarily more varied than the ability to 
Erikson on Accepting One’s Life
Erikson et al. (1986) highlighted the importance of trust in 
the acceptance of one’s life and the challenge of accepting 
support as it becomes needed.
Maples and aspens every October bear fl amboyant witness 
to this possibility of a fi nal spurt of growth. Nature unfor-
tunately has not ordained that mortals put on such a fi ne 
show. As aging continues, in fact, human bodies begin to 
deteriorate and physical and psychosocial capacities dimin-
ish in a seeming reversal of the course their development 
takes. When physical frailty demands assistance, one must 
accept again an appropriate dependence without the loss of 
trust and hope. The old, of course, are not endowed with 
the endearing survival skills of the infant. Old bodies are 
more diffi cult to care for, and the task itself is less satisfying 
to the caretaker than that of caring for infants. Such skills as 
elders possess have been hard won and are maintained only 
with determined grace. Only a lifetime of slowly developing 
trust is adequate to meet this situation, which so naturally 
elicits despair and disgust at one’s own helplessness. Of how 
many elders could one say, “He surrendered every vestige of 
his old life with a sort of courteous, half humorous gentle-
ness”? (p. 327)
Promoting Intellectual Vigor
Objective 2. To describe factors that promote intellectual 
vigor, with a focus on memory, postformal operational 
thought, and crystallized and fl uid intelligence; and to 
consider the interaction of heredity and environment on 
intelligence in later life.
Memory, reasoning, information processing, problem- 
solving abilities, and mental rigidity or fl uidity all infl uence 
an adult’s capacity to introspect, select meaningful goals, 
manage changing resources, and plan for the future. These 
intellectual capacities also infl uence the adult’s ability to 
remain involved in productive work, advise and guide oth-
ers, and invent new solutions to the problems of daily life. 
The person’s capacity to cope with the challenges of later 
adulthood, and thereby preserve a high level of life sat-
isfaction, depends on the ability to promote and sustain 
intellectual vigor.
How can one understand cognitive functioning and 
change in later life? The study of intelligence and cognition in 
later adulthood is plagued by practical and theoretical chal-
lenges that make it diffi cult to make broad generalizations. 
In the following section, we review four problems associated 
with the study of intelligence and aging. Specifi c topics are 
then discussed, including memory, postformal operational 
reasoning, and an overview of age-related changes in various 
mental abilities. The focus then shifts to an analysis of the 
impact of heredity and environment on intelligence, and fac-
tors that help to sustain high levels of intellectual function-
ing in later life.

 
Developmental Tasks | 535
The memory functions most relevant to an understand-
ing of cognitive ability in aging have to do with the ability to 
transfer information from short-term to long-term memory 
and then retrieve it. Studies that compare the short-term 
memory abilities of older and younger adults fi nd that age is 
not associated directly with the capacity of short-term mem-
ory but with the ability to transfer newly learned information 
to long-term memory and then retrieve it on demand. Older 
adults are just as effective as younger adults in recognizing 
information that was learned in the past, but they have dif-
fi culty summoning up a specifi c name or number when they 
want to fi nd it (Rowe & Kahn, 1998).
Furthermore, older adults fi nd that their memory func-
tions are especially likely to be disrupted under conditions 
in which information is presented rapidly and contextual 
cues are absent. Older adults rely on meaning to store and 
retrieve new information. With each passing year of life, 
there is more to remember. We do not really know the lim-
its of the storage capacity of long-term memory. Studies of 
memory focus on different kinds of tasks, each with its own 
trajectory of growth and decline. Semantic memory focuses 
on basic knowledge, such as recalling the meaning of words 
like vegetable, democracy, or insect. Once learned, semantic 
memory seems very resistant to loss. People continue to 
grow in the accumulation of new ideas and information over 
adulthood.
Episodic memory focuses on specifi c situations and data. 
Measures of episodic memory may ask people to recall words 
from a list or remember what they had for breakfast 3 days 
ago. With age, so many daily events and bits of information 
are encountered that unless the events have some particular 
importance, they may not be encoded, or may become dif-
fi cult to retrieve in the accumulated network of memories.
A third type of memory task is called prospective mem-
ory. This is memory about events or actions taking place 
in the future. An example would be remembering to take 
pills at 4 p.m. or to call a spouse when arriving at a hotel 
after traveling on a business trip. This type of memory task 
requires recalling that something needs to happen at a future 
time or under some future condition, and also remember-
ing specifi cally what needs to be done. Older adults do not 
do as well as young adults on prospective memory tasks 
in laboratory conditions. However, in naturalistic studies, 
the older adults do better than the young adults (Henry, 
MacLeod, Phillips, & Crawford, 2004). Prospective memory 
is a critical component of adaptive coping, and older adults 
use a variety of strategies to help stay attuned to their func-
tional future.
Research using the narrative method suggests that people 
construct memories that make sense of their past. They tell 
a story about the past that puts events in a chronological 
sequence, highlighting events that, in retrospect, are impor-
tant achievements or turning points. For example, in one 
study, participants were asked to provide a narrative about 
a time when they said, thought, or did something wise. 
succeed in a school curriculum. Furthermore, motivational 
factors come into play in the measurement of intelligence. 
This raises the distinction between ability and performance. If 
a test is perceived as irrelevant or unimportant, an adult may 
not give much effort to performing well (Dixon, 1992).
Finally, factors associated with health are intertwined with the 
functioning of older adults, although they are often not directly 
measured. A number of age-related diseases impact an individ-
ual’s ability to learn and retain new information. However, the 
boundaries between what might be considered normal cognitive 
changes associated with age and disease-related changes are not 
easy to detect, especially in the early stages of an illness (Albert, 
2002). In a longitudinal study of intelligence, Riegel and Rie-
gel (1972) found clear declines in performance among partici-
pants who died before the next testing period. Vocabulary skills, 
which normally remain high or continue to show increases with 
age, are especially likely to decline in older individuals who will 
die within the coming few years (White & Cunningham, 1988). 
Adults who are in the early stages of dementia but have not yet 
been diagnosed as suffering from the disease are often included 
in samples described as normal or normative. This inclusion 
lowers the mean of the total group and overestimates the nega-
tive association of age and intelligence (Sliwinski, Hofer, Hall, 
Buschke, & Lipton, 2003). At each older age, the inclusion of 
adults who are in an early phase of a progressive illness lowers 
the average performance of the group as a whole.
Memory
Several aspects of cognitive functioning, including reaction 
time, visual-motor fl exibility (the translation of visual infor-
mation into new motor responses), and memory show evi-
dence of decline with age. The exact nature of changes in 
memory with age is a topic of active and ongoing research 
(Giambra, Arenberg, Zonderman, & Kawas, 1995; John-
son, 2003). A common model of memory functions breaks 
memory into three forms: the sensory register, short-term 
memory, and long-term memory. In this model, the sen-
sory register is the neurological processing activity that is 
required to take in visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory 
information. Speed of processing, which is most closely 
linked to the sensory register, can be slowed as a result of 
illness. Illness does not seem to affect higher order aspects 
of memory, particularly the recall of past life events (Rosnick 
et al., 2004). Short-term memory is the working capacity 
to encode and retrieve fi ve to nine bits of information in the 
span of a minute or two. This is the scratch pad of memory 
that is used when someone tells you a telephone number or 
gives you an address. Long-term memory is a complex net-
work of information, concepts, and schemes related by asso-
ciations, knowledge, and use. It is the storehouse of a lifetime 
of information. Remembering something for more than a few 
minutes involves moving the information from short-term to 
long-term memory, storing it in relation to other associated 
knowledge, and being able to recognize, retrieve, or recon-
struct it at a later time (Hoyer &  Verhaeghen, 2006).

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
Adolescents and young and old adults were all able to retell 
experiences where wisdom helped them to turn a negative 
experience into something positive. Adults were also able to 
describe how the wisdom experience helped shape their out-
look or life philosophy (Bluck & Gluck, 2004). Memory may 
be used in a new way in later adulthood in order to resolve 
the confl ict of integrity versus despair. Memory is used to 
recall and evaluate certain life events that may preoccupy 
one’s attention until the role of these events can be integrated 
into a meaningful sense of one’s purpose. This process may 
interfere with an adult’s ability to attend to current minutiae 
or to rehearse and recall new information.
There is wide variability in people’s memory skills. Mea-
surement of changes in memory across different types of 
tasks suggests more stability than change over much of 
adulthood (Zelinski & Lewis, 2003). Some people pay great 
attention to details and are more able to recall them. Oth-
ers ignore many details and are not able to retrieve them. A 
salesman or politician may have a knack for remembering 
the names of friends, acquaintances, and family members. 
A historian may have a memory for historical events and 
personalities. A police detective may pay great attention to 
the details of the physical environment from specifi c cases. 
As the demands of work and family life accumulate, people 
adapt by focusing attention on the details and events that 
are most salient for their success. Over time, the differences 
in people’s approaches to what they have learned, recalled, 
and found useful in coping with life shape the context for 
whether and how new information is encoded and retrieved.
In addition to actual declines in some kinds of memory 
performance, older adults complain of memory problems. 
Anxiety and frustration over memory loss nag many, even 
those older adults whose memory performance has not dra-
matically declined. However, memory complaints may refl ect 
the person’s accurate subjective assessment of a slowing in 
the retrieval process (Jonker, Launer, Hooijer, & Lindeboom, 
1996). The seriousness of the memory complaints and peo-
ple’s assessment of whether they can do anything to improve 
their memory combine to influence older adults’ worries 
about memory loss and their general sense of well-being 
(Verhaeghen, Geraerts, & Marcoen, 2000).
Postformal Operational Thinking
Research based on the standard Piagetian tasks has been 
criticized for its lack of relevance and familiarity to older par-
ticipants. The traditional tasks are dominated by the role of 
pure logic, disconnected from the situation. They emphasize 
problems that have a scientifi c rather than a pragmatic focus. 
Although the solution to most formal operational problems 
requires the manipulation of multiple variables, there is 
typically only one correct solution. In adult life, most prob-
lems involve multiple dimensions with changing or poorly 
defi ned variables and more than one solution. For example, 
given my limited resources, should I buy more life insurance, 
put cash in a certifi cate of deposit, or invest in the stock and 
bond market to best protect my family’s fi nancial future?
In later adulthood, people with academic backgrounds in 
 science and engineering use their formal operational problem-
solving skills combined with postformal reasoning to fi nd new 
solutions to recurring problems.

As a result of these limitations or criticisms of formal 
operational reasoning, scholars have formulated a view of 
postformal thought, which has been characterized in the 
following ways:
• A greater reliance on refl ection on self, emotions, values, 
and the specifi c situation in addressing a problem
• A willingness to shift gears or take a different approach 
depending on the specifi c problem
• An ability to draw on personal knowledge to fi nd prag-
matic solutions
• An awareness of the contradictions in life and a will-
ingness to try to include conflicting or contradictory 
thoughts, emotions, and experiences in fi nding a solution
• A fl exible integration of cognition and emotion so that 
solutions are adaptive, reality oriented, and emotionally 
satisfying
• An enthusiasm for seeking new questions, fi nding new 
problems, and new frameworks for understanding 
experience

Gc and Gf can be identified as integrated structures in 
both early and later adulthood (McArdle, Ferrer-Caja, Hama-
gami, & Woodcock, 2002). However, Horn argued that these 
two kinds of thinking draw on somewhat different neurolog-
ical and experiential sources. Gc refl ects the consequences of 
life experiences within a society. Socialization in the family; 
exposure to the media; and participation in school, work, 
and community settings all emphasize the use and improve-
ment of Gc. Gc increases with age, experience, and physi-
cal maturation, and remains at a high level of functioning 
throughout adulthood.
Gf is characteristic of what is meant by someone having 
common sense. Finding a general relationship and apply-
ing it without having been schooled in that problem-solv-
ing area is an example of Gf, as is being able to approach 
new problems logically, systematically, and quickly. Horn 
hypothesized that Gf depends more on the specifi c number 
of neurons available for its functioning than does Gc. Thus, 
neurological loss would be more damaging to Gf than to Gc. 
Subsequent research has supported the notion that neu-
ral effi ciency, often recognized through changes in sensory 
functioning and speed of response, is closely related to fl uid 
intelligence and shows an age-related decline, independent 
of disease (Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997). However, the 
extent of this decline may be related to the domain in which 
it is studied. For example, one study focused on men who 
had different levels of expertise in playing the game of Go. 
Measures of reasoning, memory, and cognitive speed were 
developed to apply specifi cally to that game. Older players 
generally showed the expected decline in deductive reason-
ing and cognitive speed. However, for those older men who 
were very expert players, no decline was observed (Masu-
naga & Horn, 2000). The implication is that in areas where 
there is highly developed expertise, aging is not necessarily 
accompanied by declines in either Gf or Gc.
In an analysis of the pattern of cognitive abilities across the 
life span, Tucker-Drob (2009) gathered data from a nation-
ally representative sample of over 6,000 individuals from 
ages 4 to 101. He looked at age groupings, comparing high 
and low scoring individuals at different ages, to address two 
basic questions: (1) How do various abilities change with age? 
(2) Do abilities cluster together (e.g., people who are good at 
visual-spatial thinking are also good at short-term memory), 
or is there differentiation among abilities with age (people 
can be very good in one area, and average or not so strong 
in another)? Seven broad areas of cognitive ability were mea-
sured: comprehension knowledge (similar to Gc), fl uid rea-
soning (Gf), visual-spatial thinking (e.g., identifying the pieces 
needed to complete a pattern), processing speed (e.g., quickly 
identifying two identical numbers in a row of numbers), 
short-term memory (e.g., repeating a list of unrelated words), 
long-term retrieval (e.g., naming as many examples as pos-
sible from a specifi c category of places or objects), and audi-
tory processing (e.g., identifying a word when it is presented 
against a competing background of distracting sounds). As 
illustrated in Figure 13.2, all the abilities with the exception 
People who operate with postformal thought do not do 
so in every situation. When a problem has clear parameters 
and needs a single solution, concrete or formal operations 
will work. However, when a problem is value laden, ambigu-
ous, or involves many interpersonal implications, postfor-
mal thinking comes into play (Sinnott & Cavanaugh, 1991; 
Labouvie-Vief, 1992; Commons & Richards, 2003).
Given the complexity of adult life, adaptive problem 
solving requires flexibility, differentiation of positive and 
negative aspects of a single alternative, and the ability to 
consider the implications of a course of action. Increasingly, 
problem solving becomes a social task, whereby several peo-
ple or groups of people work together to arrive at solutions. 
A component of postformal reasoning includes the ability 
to collaborate with others, balancing the interpersonal and 
analytical aspects of the work. Because members of groups 
are vulnerable to pressures toward conformity or group-
think, it is important for individuals to retain their capac-
ity to differentiate or distance themselves from the group in 
order to examine the group’s product in a more objective 
light.
Patterns of Change in Different 
Mental Abilities
There has been growing interest in assessing the extent of 
cognitive plasticity in later life. How readily can older adults 
improve their skills or learn new skills? This question seems 
to produce two different kinds of answers. One line of 
research fi nds evidence of DNA damage in the human brain 
with reduced capacity for repair beginning after about age 40. 
Damage of this kind has negative consequences for synaptic 
plasticity leading to declines in learning and memory. Certain 
brain areas are more vulnerable to the accumulated stressors 
of aging than others, and certain individuals are more vulner-
able to the neurological diseases of aging than others (Lu et al.,
2004; Erraji-Benchekroun et al., 2005; Mattson & Magnus, 
2006). In contrast, other researchers fi nd that among peo-
ple in their sixties and seventies, continuing improvement 
in performance is possible through training and practice. 
Improvement has been observed in tasks involving memory, 
reasoning, perceptual-motor speed, and visual attention, as 
well as specifi c areas of expertise (Krampe & Charness, 2006; 
Yang, Krampe, & Baltes, 2006). One possible way to recon-
cile these opposing observations is to consider how different 
types of mental abilities might change with age.
Cognitive functioning involves the coordination of a vari-
ety of mental abilities that change as a result of experience 
and aging. John Horn (1979) proposed that the course of 
mental abilities across the life span is not uniform. Some 
areas are strengthened, and others decline. Horn suggested 
differentiating crystallized intelligence (Gc) and fluid 
intelligence (Gf). Gc is the ability to bring knowledge accu-
mulated through past learning into play in appropriate situa-
tions. Gf is the ability to impose organization on information 
and generate new hypotheses. Both kinds of intelligence are 
required for optimal human functioning.

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
between twins was accounted for by their environment—
both the shared environment refl ected in growing up in the 
same family and community and the unshared environment, 
including the different interactions they had with their par-
ents, other siblings, and friends, and their participation in 
different types of educational and social settings. The stimu-
lating or stifl ing nature of the environment—including access 
to social support, the quality of health care, exposure to dis-
ease, and opportunities for continuing involvement in chal-
lenging work—transforms the genotype into an observed 
phenotype (Gottesman, 1997; Shanahan & Hofer, 2005).
The noted learning theorist B.F. Skinner (1983) described 
some possible environmental qualities that fail to reinforce 
systematic thinking or new ideas in aging people. Many peo-
ple who live alone, for example, lack the diversity of social 
interaction that produces cognitive discrepancy and new 
concepts. Older people may be reinforced for talking about 
the past. Their recollections of early memories are interesting 
to students and younger colleagues. However, preoccupa-
tion with these reminiscences does not encourage thinking 
in new directions.
Skinner claimed that one is more likely to repeat oneself 
as one ages. He suggested that it may be important for older 
adults to move into new areas of work in order to prevent 
the repetition of old ideas. Skinner believed that it is possible 
to analyze how the quality of one’s thinking is influenced 
by the circumstances of aging and also to identify interven-
tions that will prevent the deterioration of cognitive abili-
ties. These interventions include attempts to be sensitive to 
the signs of fatigue, planning for regular opportunities for 
stimulating verbal interactions with others, making careful 
outlines of written work to avoid distraction, and acting on 
ideas as they come to one’s mind rather than counting on 
remembering them later.
Cognitive functioning in later adulthood is multidimen-
sional, with substantial differences among individuals as well 
as differences among cognitive domains within the same per-
son (McArdle et al., 2002). Adults experience tremendous 
growth in domain-specifi c areas of knowledge. Within these 
domains, many complex networks of information, strate-
gies, and frameworks of meaning are elaborated that result in 
high-level, fl exible functioning. The overall level of function-
ing is subject to environmental infl uences that promote par-
ticular specialization and cognitive organization based on the 
demands of the situation, the stresses and challenges of daily 
life, and the opportunities for mastery in particular areas of 
competence. At the same time, certain aspects of the pro-
cessing base that are dependent on neural functioning may 
decline with age. This decline, however, is not always great, 
and studies have shown that capacities described as elements 
of fluid intelligence, such as speed of response, inductive 
reasoning, and spatial orientation, can benefi t from targeted 
interventions (Van Boxtel, Paas, Houx, & Adam, 1997; 
Saczynski, Willis, & Schaie, 2002). The implications of age-
related changes in cognitive functioning are discussed in the 
box about age and workplace productivity.
of Gc increased in childhood and adolescence, peaked in later 
adolescence and early adulthood, and then declined through 
adulthood and aging. In contrast, crystallized intelligence 
continued to increase throughout adulthood, until about age 
60, and then declined slightly into later life. Among those of 
higher general intelligence, there was less commonality in the 
scores across the various cognitive abilities suggesting that 
with greater intelligence comes a greater capacity to express 
certain abilities to a uniquely high level. Over the life span, 
the abilities were more differentiated; that is, people in middle 
adulthood and later life showed more variability in their cog-
nitive capacities than did younger children and adolescents.
The Interaction of Heredity and 
Environment on Mental Functioning
For years, it was assumed that the environment played an 
increasingly major role in intellectual functioning over time. 
The accumulation of life experiences, education, and social-
ization were expected to introduce new bases of knowledge 
and problem-solving structures. Recent work suggests that 
the construct of the norm of reaction, introduced in Chapter 4 
(The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development), provides 
a more appropriate framework for understanding intelligence 
in adulthood. Genetic factors, early childhood family environ-
ment, and contemporary work and family environments all 
contribute to adult cognitive functioning (DeFrias & Schaie, 
2001; Schaie & Zuo, 2001). Research on identical and fraternal 
twins who were 80 years old or older found that the heritabil-
ity of general cognitive ability was about 60% (McClearn et al., 
1997). In other words, genetic factors substantially contribute 
to the stability of cognitive capacities over the life span.
Given the strong contribution of heredity to cognitive 
ability, its expression in observable behavior depends on the 
nature of the environment. Roughly 30% of the variability

Developmental Tasks | 539
A person’s parenting skills, patience, and knowledge come 
into play in a new confi guration and may be more in demand 
in the grandparent role than they were in the parent role.
Grandparenting Styles. Grandparenthood involves 
a three-generational family system. The average age for 
becoming a grandparent is in the decade of the fifties, 
resulting in the potential of a 20- to 30-year relationship 
with one’s grandchildren (Giarrusso, Silverstein, & Bengs-
ton, 1996). The enactment of the grandparent role depends 
on the timing of entry into this role and on the outlook 
or interest of each generation in having interactions and 
access to one another. The quality of the grandparent-
grandchild relationship is negotiated through the adult 
child and is likely to change as the grandchildren mature 
(Smith & Drew, 2002).
People differ in the way they enact the grandparent role. 
In one of the first empirical studies of grandparenthood, 
Neugarten and Weinstein (1964) interviewed the grandpar-
ents in 70 middle-class families. The following fi ve grand-
parenting styles were identifi ed, each expressing a distinct 
interpretation of the role:
 1. Formal. This type of grandparent was interested in the 
grandchildren but careful not to become involved in par-
enting them other than by occasional babysitting.
 2. Funseeker. This type of grandparent had informal, playful 
interactions with the grandchildren, enjoying mutually 
self-indulgent fun with them.
 3. Surrogate parent. This style was especially likely for 
grandmothers who assumed major child care responsi-
bilities when the mother worked outside the home.
 4. Reservoir of family wisdom. This style was an authoritarian 
relationship in which a grandparent, usually the grand-
father, dispensed skills and resources. Parents as well as 
grandchildren were subordinate to this older authority 
fi gure.
 5. Distant fi gure. This type of grandparent appeared on 
birthdays and holidays but generally had little contact 
with the grandchildren.
More than 35 years later, Bengston (2001) offered a 
revised picture of the nature of multigenerational family 
bonds. His research was based on the Longitudinal Study 
of Generations (LSOG), begun in 1971, and continuing 
with data collection every 3 years. This study is based on 
more than 2,000 members of three-generational families, 
enabling the assessment of relationship characteristics 
between parents and their adult children, adult children 
and their children, and grandparents and grandchildren. 
The study highlights that the way a person enacts the 
grandparent role is not only a product of a personal defi ni-
tion of the role, but also a result of how the interconnected 
family members permit and support intergenerational 
interactions.
The LSOG identified five aspects of intergenerational 
 solidarity—a construct that refl ects closeness and commitment 
On the basis of extensive longitudinal research, Schaie 
(1994) identifi ed seven factors that are associated with retain-
ing a high level of cognitive functioning in later adulthood:
 1. Absence of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases
 2. Favorable environment linked to high socioeconomic 
status
 3. Involvement in a complex and intellectually stimulating 
environment
 4. Flexible personality style at midlife
 5. High cognitive functioning of spouse
 6. Maintenance of a high level of perceptual processing 
speed
 7. Rating oneself as being satisfi ed with life accomplish-
ments in midlife
This list illustrates the interplay of the biological, psy-
chological, and social systems that contribute to cognitive 
functioning in the later years. Retaining one’s intellectual 
complexity and creative problem-solving skills are closely 
linked to the ability to cope with the inevitable role transi-
tions that occur in later life.
Redirecting Energy to New Roles 
and Activities
Objective 3. To examine the process of redirecting 
energy to new roles and activities, with special focus on 
role gain, such as grandparenthood; role loss, such as 
widowhood; and new opportunities for leisure.
Role transition, role gain, and role loss occur in every period 
of the life span. In later adulthood, however, a convergence 
of role transitions is likely to lead to a revision of major life 
functions and a reformulation of one’s lifestyle. Roles are lost 
through widowhood, retirement, and the death of friends. 
At the same time, new roles, such as grandparent, senior 
adviser, or community leader, require the formation of new 
patterns of behavior and relationships.
Grandparenthood
Becoming a grandmother or grandfather brings a psychologi-
cal transformation as well as a change in the family system. 
With the birth of a fi rst grandchild, an adult may begin to 
refl ect on one’s own life phases of childhood, parenthood, 
and grandparenthood, revisiting earlier personal and inter-
personal themes, and possibly revising earlier understand-
ings of the parent-child relationship. Depending on one’s 
level of engagement in the grandparent role, grandparent-
hood may require a renewal of parenting skills that have been 
stored away along with the bottle sterilizer and potty chair. 
Grandparents begin to rekindle their acquaintance with the 
delights of childhood, including diapering the baby, telling 
fairy tales, taking trips to the zoo, or having the pleasure of 
small helping hands with baking, gardening, or carpentry.

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
to the grandparent’s overall sense of purpose and worth 
(Kivnick, 1988; Gattai & Musatti, 1999; Scraton & Holland, 
2006). Grandchildren symbolize an extension of personal 
infl uence that will most assuredly persist well beyond the 
grandparent’s death. To this extent, grandchildren may help 
older adults feel more comfortable about their own death. 
Grandchildren offer concrete evidence that some thread of 
their lives will persist into the future, giving a dimension of 
immortality to themselves and the family ancestry that they 
represent. Active grandparenting can also promote a process 
of life review, stimulating a revisitation of one’s own parent-
ing role and possibly supporting the achievement of a psy-
chosocial sense of integrity. For some, the lack of importance 
or attention given to grandparents or the diffi culty in creat-
ing a meaningful way of interacting with grandchildren can 
create new tensions and ambivalence about aging and role 
transitions.
In an analysis of the sources of vitality in later life, Erik-
son, Erikson, and Kivnick (1986) found that relationships 
with grandchildren played the following critical role:
The major involvement that uniformly makes life worth liv-
ing is the thought of and participation in their relationships 
with children and grandchildren. Their pride in their own 
achievement in having brought up their young, through 
thick and thin, and their satisfaction in the way these young 
have developed gives them, for the most part, deep gratifi -
cation. With the arrival of grandchildren, they may identify 
themselves as ancestors, graduated to venerability. Listen to 
their voices as they trace their own ancestry and that of their 
children’s traits: “She has her mother’s fi re, that fi rst girl of 
ours. She has more energy and more projects than anyone. 
Come to think of it, my mother had that fi re, too. And my 
wife’s two grandmothers.” “My son is a perfectionist, like 
me.” “The kids are innately smart, like their father.” (p. 326)
Grandchildren also stimulate older adults’ thoughts about 
time, the changing of cultural norms across generations, 
and the patterning of history. In relating to their grandchil-
dren as they grow up, grandparents discover elements of the 
culture that remain stable. Some familiar stories and songs 
retain their appeal from generation to generation. Certain 
toys, games, and preoccupations of children of the current 
generation are remembered by grandparents from their own 
childhood. Grandparents may become aware of changes 
in the culture that are reflected in new childrearing prac-
tices; new equipment, toys, games, and forms of entertain-
ment; and new expectations for children’s behavior at each 
life stage. By maintaining communication with their grand-
children, older adults keep abreast of the continuities and 
changes in their culture that are refl ected in the experiences 
of childhood. Through their grandchildren, adults avoid a 
sense of alienation from the contemporary world. The more 
involved grandparents are in the daily care and routines 
of their grandchildren, the more central they become to a 
child’s sense of security and well-being. This kind of impor-
tance is a benefi t not only to the child but also to the older 
within the parent-child and grandparent-grandchild relation-
ships. These dimensions are as follows:
 1. Affectional solidarity: Feelings of affection and emotional 
closeness
 2. Associational solidarity: Type and frequency of contact
 3. Consensual solidarity: Agreement in opinions and expectations
 4. Functional solidarity: Giving and receiving emotional and 
instrumental support
 5. Structural solidarity: Geographic proximity that would al-
low for interaction
Based on these measured dimensions, five intergenera-
tional family types were identifi ed, which closely resemble 
the grandparenting roles characterized by Neugarten and 
Weinstein. The tight-knit families were emotionally close, 
lived near one another, interacted often, and both gave and 
received help. The sociable families were emotionally close 
and had frequent contact, but did not offer much functional 
help. The intimate but distant families had high levels of agree-
ment and felt emotionally close but did not interact often, 
lived far apart, and offered little functional help. The obliga-
tory families lived near one another and had frequent con-
tact, but were not emotionally close and did not share much 
in the way of common opinions or expectations. Finally, the 
detached families had low levels of all measures of solidarity.
Looking at the adult children’s views of their parents, the 
sample was divided rather evenly across the five groups. 
Tight-knit and sociable families were each about 25% of the 
sample, obligatory and intimate but distant families were 
each about 16%, and detached families were about 17%. 
When ethnic groups were compared, European Ameri-
cans were more likely than African Americans or Hispanic 
Americans to describe their relationship with their mother 
as obligatory or detached. Cultural dimensions including the 
emphasis on fi lial obligation, immigration or acculturation 
status, and the symbolic meaning of linkages to one’s ances-
try all infl uence the emphasis that various cultures place on 
the grandparent role (Ikels, 1998).
Two important ideas emerge from these descriptions. 
First, contemporary U.S. families are characterized by a 
variety of intergenerational relationships. No single type is 
normative. Second, about two thirds of these relationships 
can be characterized as showing high levels of affectional and 
consensual solidarity. This has been observed in repeated 
measurements between 1971 and 1997. Thus, despite many 
changes in family characteristics, including decreased fam-
ily size, increased involvement of mothers in the labor force, 
parental divorce, and increasing educational attainment of 
the parent generation, sentiments of intergenerational close-
ness are strong. This implies an important stabilizing role for 
the grandparent generation—a role that may become increas-
ingly important for the large number of children growing up 
in single-parent and dual-earner parent families.
The Meaning of the Grandparent Role. Grandpar-
enthood has a variety of personal meanings that contribute

1991, p. 39)
Grandparent Caregivers. Roughly 6.6 million chil-
dren under the age of 18, or 9% of all U.S. children, live 
in households with at least one grandparent present. In 
comparison to other ethnic groups, African American 
and Asian American children are more likely than Anglo 
or Latino children to be living in households with one or 
both grandparents (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). For about 
one third of these children, their parents are the primary 
householders and one or more grandparents live at home 
with them (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). These grandpar-
ents are likely benefi ting from some types of support or 
care from their adult children. They may also provide 
direct and indirect support for their grandchildren, includ-
ing being home when the children return from school, tak-
ing care of the children when they are ill and the parents 
have to work, and taking over household tasks so that par-
ents and children can have time together.
In the other two thirds of this group, the grandparents 
are the householders, suggesting that many grandparents 
are using their resources to help support their adult children 
and grandchildren. About 1.5 million children live with their 
grandparents with no parents in the household. These chil-
dren are more likely to be living in poverty, without health 
insurance, and receiving some type of public assistance than 
are children who live in their grandparents’ household with 
their own parents present (Fields, 2003). Among grandpar-
ents who have custody of their grandchildren, an estimated 
40% cared for their grandchildren for 5 years or more (Abel, 
adult’s assessment of personal worth. Over time, the grand-
parent-grandchild relationship has the potential for becom-
ing increasingly meaningful as grandchildren mature into 
adulthood. This relationship, typically sustained through 
mutual personal choice, combines love, respect, mutual sup-
port, and a unique form of shared as well as diverging his-
tory (Crosnoe & Elder, 2002a; Kemp, 2005).
Some adults interpret the role of grandparent as an 
opportunity to pass on to their grandchildren the wisdom 
and cultural heritage of their ancestry. In the process of ful-
filling this role, older adults must try to find meaning in 
their experiences and communicate it in meaningful ways 
to their grandchildren. Grandparents select many avenues 
to educate their grandchildren, infl uencing their thoughts 
and fantasies. Storytelling, special trips, long walks, attend-
ing religious services, and working on special projects are all 
activities that allow grandparents moments of intimacy with 
their grandchildren. Educating one’s grandchildren involves 
a deep sense of investment in experiences and ideals that one 
believes to be central to a fruitful life.
The many ways in which grandchildren can contribute to 
an adult’s feelings of well-being have been replicated in stud-
ies conducted in European countries (Smith, 1991). A Ger-
man grandmother addressed the meaning that her grandson 
gave to her life:
Yes, he is the most important thing in my life, because I 
have nothing else at the moment. They all say I spoil him. 
I don’t know. Mama is a little bit strict, and so I always 
am careful not to spoil him too much. And it is actu-
ally Carsten this and Carsten that; he means so much to 
Jakob  invited his grand-
mother to come to school 
with him. First she read a story 
to the class; then Jakob read 
one. Reading aloud is one of 
the things they have enjoyed 
doing together ever since 
Jakob was small.

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
MUCH OF THE research about the 
grandparent role has been carried out 
by European American investigators 
with European American families. 
As a result, the work tends to begin 
from an individualist perspective, 
in which the nuclear family and the 
autonomy of the generations are 
highly valued. The results of this 
research suggest that grandparents 
play a variety of roles in U.S. families, 
and that these roles can vary from 
remote and minimally involved 
to actively engaged. This picture 
misses the qualitatively different 
ways that grandparents are viewed 
in ethnic groups that emerge from 
a more collectivist orientation, and 
the central role that grandparents 
play in the socialization process and 
family support systems. Although the 
majority of U.S. families do not have 
three generations living together 
in one household, the presence 
of grandparents living with their 
grandchildren is more than twice 
as likely in African American, Asian 
American, and Hispanic American 
families than in European American 
families. This may, in part, be a result 
of the fi nancial pressures on ethnic 
families, but it is also a result of a 
more collectivist outlook, in which 
family and kinship relationships are 
more central to the value system and 
priorities of many ethnic groups.
In an interview study of African 
Americans, Latin Americans, 
Filipino Americans, and Cambodian 
Americans, older adults (ages 50 
and up) described the importance 
of mutual assistance and its critical 
role in fostering a sense of continuity 
across the generations. This can be 
especially important for immigrant 
families. Older adults provide care, 
guidance, and instrumental assistance 
for families, especially when there are 
young children in the home and the 
parents have to work (Becker et al., 
2003).
Even when grandparents and their 
adult children are not living together 
in the same home, there is an intensity 
and frequency of involvement that are 
not as obvious in European American 
families. In many ethnic groups, the 
grandparent generation is highly 
revered. In others, the intimacy of 
the family’s daily concerns extends 
to grandparents, aunts and uncles, 
and other kin (Lockery, 1991; Burnett, 
1999).
The following brief descriptions 
suggest the outlook of fi ve U.S. ethnic 
groups on intergenerational relations. 
Each has a slightly different fl avor, but 
each suggests a more integrated role 
for the grandparent generation than 
is characteristic of European American 
families (DeGenova, 1997; Contreras 
et al., 1999; King et al., 2006).
African Americans value strong 
kinship bonds and a supportive 
extended family system. Caregiving 
responsibilities are shared among 
kin as needed. Grandparents tend to 
support working parents by providing 
care to young children, and are cared 
for in return. Their active role in the 
family often contributes a strong 
moral and religious strength and 
provides emotional support to the 
parent generation, which reduces 
stress in the household.
Arab American families have 
elaborate and intensive networks of 
HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND DIVERSITY
Intergenerational Relationships in Various Ethnic Groups
2010). In other words, this is a long-term commitment when 
the adult children are unable to parent.
Many grandparents play an especially important role in 
supporting the development of their grandchildren dur-
ing times of family stress (Landry-Meyer, 1999; Goodman, 
2003; Mills, Gomez-Smith, & DeLeon, 2005). In contem-
porary American society, one can view grandparents as a 
potential resource that is called into active duty when cer-
tain diffi culties arise for parents. In cases of parental divorce, 
grandparents often assume a central role in the lives of 
young children. Some custodial mothers move back home 
with their parents. Grandparents often assume more child 
care responsibilities during this time.
Following divorces in which the mother has pri-
mary custody of the children, the grandchild’s relation-
ship with maternal grandparents is more likely to be 
enhanced, whereas the relationship with the paternal 
grandparents is likely to decline. Several studies have 
shown that having positive ongoing relationships with 
grandparents during the years following the parents’ 
divorce is associated with a child’s ability to manage 
school demands, maintain positive relationships with 
peers and teachers, and have fewer behavior problems 
(Heatherington, Cox, & Cox, 1985; Heatherington, Stan-
ley-Hagan, & Anderson, 1989).
Grandparents also play a key role when their young, 
unmarried daughters become pregnant. The pattern of 
unmarried teen mothers living with parents is especially 
common in African American families (Minkler & Fuller-
Thomson, 2005). African American grandmothers are likely 
to perceive themselves and to be perceived by their daughters 
as actively involved in childrearing. Among young adult Afri-
can American parents, the grandmother is most often viewed 
as the person to count on for child care assistance, advice, 
and emotional support (Hunter, 1997). These grandmothers 
may be young themselves, just entering middle adulthood, 
when they assume the grandparent role. The presence of 
grandmothers appears to affect the family atmosphere as well 
as the childrearing environment. Having a grandmother in 
the home allows the mother to be more fl exible in managing

family members with a strong value 
for reciprocity, mutual protection, 
and care. Intimate family relationships 
extend to commitment to care for 
older family members.
Chinese Americans place a strong 
value on bringing honor to the family. 
Filial piety is one of the highest 
values, evidenced in a great sense of 
obligation, respect, and responsibility 
for parents.
Japanese Americans demonstrate 
strong feelings of respect and commit-
ment to parents. They have a deep 
sense of obligation for the care of 
aging parents. Retired parents may 
live with their adult child who takes on 
the leadership role for the family.
Puerto Rican and many other 
Latino cultures embrace the value of 
familialism, a sense of closeness and 
interdependence among members 
of the nuclear and extended family, 
which includes a deep respect for 
elders. Family members serve many 
functions, including socialization, 
protection, companionship, social 
and business contacts, and economic 
support. Puerto Rican families create a 
formal intergenerational link through 
the role of the compadrazgo, or 
godparent, who has a responsibility 
for the child’s well-being through life.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. If you have a living grandpar-
ent, what is your relationship 
like? What impact have your 
grandparents had on your de-
velopment at different stages? 
Describe your relationship with 
grandparents in infancy, tod-
dlerhood, early school age, and 
middle childhood.
 2. Thinking about the idea of differ-
ent styles of grandparenting, how 
do you think your grandparents 
conceptualize their role? Talk to 
them and ask if they have a sense 
of the kind of grandparent they 
are and how they would like to 
be. How does their sense of them-
selves compare with how you think 
of them in their grandparent role? 
What are the implications of the 
similarities and differences in these 
conceptualizations?
 3. Thinking about the fi ve different 
ethnic group families described in 
the box, consider how grandpar-
ents in each of these types of fami-
lies might infl uence the psychoso-
cial development of a male and a 
female child through the stages. 
Remember, you are discussing 
people from these ethnic groups 
who are also Americans.
 4. For each American ethnic group, 
consider some likely tensions be-
tween the grandparent and the 
grandchild generation. What prob-
lems might arise in each family if 
the adult children and the grand-
children identify with American 
individualistic values and grandpar-
ents identify with more collectivist 
values?
 5. Try thinking about yourself as 
a grandparent. How would you 
conceptualize your role as parent? 
As grandparent? What kind of 
grandparent would you like to be? 
Why? How do you think having a 
grandchild would infl uence your 
psychosocial development?
daily demands, thereby reducing much of the stress that 
characterizes single-parent families.
Maternal employment is another condition in which 
grandparents are likely to give direct support. Increasingly, 
parents of young children call on grandparents to provide 
all or part of daily child care (Brandon, 2000; Goodfellow & 
Laverty, 2003). These grandparents are intimately involved in 
the lives of their grandchildren, directing signifi cant energy, 
talent, and time to this role. For more information on model 
programs for grandparents who are raising their grandchil-
dren, visit the website on grandparenting developed by the 
AARP (www.aarp.org/families/grandparents).
Grandparents who take on primary responsibility for their 
grandchildren face challenges as well as experiencing satisfac-
tions in this off-time role. Many grandparents are working as 
well as caring for their children. They may have to support 
their grandchildren with little access to the social and fi nancial 
services that would be available to other low-income families 
or foster families because they do not have legal guardian-
ship of their grandchildren. Caregiver stress is associated with 
poverty, absence of social services or fi nancial support for child 
care, loss of freedom, and lack of involvement with friends 
and interests outside their family circle. When the grandchil-
dren have been exposed to chaotic or neglectful parenting, 
they may have physical and mental health problems that place 
additional strain on grandparent caregivers (Longoria, 2010).
On the other hand, grandparent caregivers perceive that 
they are expressing their generative motives in caring for 
their grandchildren. They are in a unique position to form a 
close emotional bond with their grandchildren, helping their 
grandchildren to cope during periods of family disruption 
and preserving kinship and community ties (Bullock, 2005; 
Landry-Meyer, Gerard, & Guzell, 2005; Minkler & Fuller-
Thomson, 2005; Dolbin-MacNab & Keiley, 2006).
Bill and Sharon Hicks were interviewed about the experi-
ences of raising their granddaughter, Brittany:
“It has not been easy. Sometimes we feel a little bitter because 
our anticipated freedom has been taken away.” But when 
asked if he and his wife would open their home to Brittany

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
the psychosocial consequences of widowhood include 
intense emotional grief, loss of social and emotional support, 
and loss of material and instrumental support. Emotions of 
depression, anger, shock, and overall grief as well as yearn-
ing for the deceased partner are observed 6 and 18 months 
after the loss (Carr, House, Wortman, Neese, & Kessler, 
2001). Most older widowers remarry, whereas the majority 
of widows remain unmarried and live alone.
Widows. Widows must learn to function socially and in 
their own households without the presence of a marriage 
partner. Adaptation to this role requires resilience, creative 
problem solving, and a strong belief in one’s personal worth. 
A woman who is widowed at age 60 can expect more than 
20 years of life in which to create a new, single head-of-
household lifestyle.
In addition to the bereavement itself, a number of stress-
ors challenge the coping resources of widows. Studies of 
economic changes among widows show that many experi-
ence increased expenses just prior to widowhood, as well as 
marked decreases in their fi nancial resources for years follow-
ing widowhood (Fan & Zick, 2006; Gillen & Kim, 2009). 
Women who have never participated in the labor market dur-
ing their married years may have no marketable skills and feel 
insecure about entering the labor force. They may be unin-
formed or uneasy about using social service agencies to meet 
their needs. For most women, the loss of their husband is 
most keenly felt as a loss of emotional support, as expressed 
in the following example: “He is most apt to be mentioned as 
the person the widow most enjoyed being with, who made 
her feel important and secure” (Lopata, 1978, p. 221). The 
transition to widowhood may be especially diffi cult for those 
who have been caring for an ill partner, hoping for recovery 
yet observing constant decline (Bass & Bowman, 1990).
again, he answered: “Positively, yes! Brittany has been a shin-
ing light in our lives. She has forced us to stay young at heart. 
And that’s not such a bad thing to happen.” (Abel, 2010)
Loss of Grandparent-Grandchild Contact. In contrast 
to the picture of an increasing role for grandparents in car-
ing for their grandchildren, a growing number of grandpar-
ents are losing contact with their grandchildren as a result 
of parental divorce, confl ict between the parents, death of 
an adult child, or adoption of a grandchild after remarriage. 
Disruption in the grandparent-grandchild relationship is 
especially great when the grandparent’s adult child is not 
named as the custodial parent after a divorce. In the 1980s, 
most states created statutes allowing grandparents to fi le for 
a legal right to enforced visitation with their grandchildren, 
even over parental objections. The laws differ from state to 
state, establishing different conditions under which grand-
parents may be granted visitation. In 1998, a law was passed 
to ensure that grandparents who have visitation rights in one 
state may visit their grandchildren in any state. However, in 
some states, earlier visitation laws have been overturned, 
fi nding that they interfere with parental rights regarding the 
rearing of their children. Legal recourse is not very effec-
tive given that it tends to increase the hostilities between 
grandparents and their adult children, making normal-
ized visitation even less likely (Drew & Smith, 1999). For 
more information about grandparent visitation rights, visit 
the website of the Foundation for Grandparenting (www
. grandparenting.org/) (Kornhaber, 2004).
Widowhood
Among those ages 65 to 74, 7% of men and 25% of women 
describe their marital status as widowed; by the ages 75 
and over, these rates increase to 23% for men and 59% for 
women (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2010). For many adults,

fall into the involved category, tak-
ing on parenting responsibilities

basis.

wanted to have their anger, grief, and the disruption in 
their lives acknowledged and accepted by their friends. In 
this way, they felt they could begin to come to terms with 
their loss and build a new life.
Widowers. Widowers suffer greater increases in depres-
sion following the loss of their spouses than do widows 
(Umberson, Wortman, & Kessler, 1992; Lee, DeMaris, 
Bavin, & Sullivan, 2001). Perhaps because men in tradi-
tional marriages rely heavily on their wives for both the 
instrumental support of managing daily household tasks 
and the emotional and social support of companionship 
and social activity, their lives are more intensely disrupted 
when their wives die. This may result in an immediate 
search for a new marriage partner. In a 2-year follow-up 
study of dating and remarriage after widowhood, 61% of 
men and 19% of women had remarried or were in a new 
romantic relationship by 25 months after the death of their 
spouses. For men, a higher monthly income and level of 
education were the best predictors of being remarried. For 
both men and women, involvement in a new relationship 
was positively associated with psychological well-being 
and interpreted as a positive coping strategy (Schneider, 
Sledge, Shuchter, & Zisook, 1996).
Widowhood also results in increased death rates among 
surviving spouses. In a longitudinal study of married couples 
in the United States, the death of one spouse from any of 
a variety of causes, such as cancers, infections, and cardio-
vascular diseases, was associated with an increased risk of 
death for the surviving spouse (Elwert & Christakis, 2008). 
The process of bereavement seems to accelerate the course of 
preexisting diseases, and leads to increased rates of suicides, 
accidents, and alcohol-related deaths. To some degree, the 
relationship of widowhood to mortality is tied to the well-
known health effects of marriage. Depending upon the way 
that spouses support each others’ health, the loss of a spouse 
may result in less effective adherence to medical care, less 
adequate diet, and less social interaction and social stimula-
tion, all of which are known to support physical and mental 
health in later life (Elwert & Christakis, 2006). Most adults 
cope successfully with widowhood, either by forming a new, 
intimate relationship or establishing a new, independent 
lifestyle; however, others fi nd it diffi cult to recover from the 
impact of their loss. The “Applying Theory and Research to 
Life” box illustrates the variety of patterns of adaptation to 
widowhood.
Leisure Activities
Whereas widowhood brings role loss, one way of coping is to 
become more involved in new kinds of activities and inter-
ests. As the role responsibilities of parenthood and employ-
ment decrease, older adults have more time and resources to 
devote to leisure activities. Involvement in leisure activities is 
associated with higher levels of well-being and lower stress. 
In a study of adaptation to widowhood, such activities were 
most commonly social activities with family and friends. 
Despite the extreme pain and prolonged grief that accom-
pany widowhood, most women cope with it successfully. 
In a study of women ages 60 through 98 who had recently 
become widows, there was a high degree of self-suffi ciency 
(O’Bryant & Morgan, 1990). The majority of respondents 
said they performed a variety of daily tasks, including trans-
portation, housekeeping, shopping, preparing meals, per-
sonal care and hygiene, fi nancial and other decisions, and 
providing fi nancial support, without help from others. More 
than 30% said they managed their own home repairs, yard 
work, and legal questions without help. From this study, a 
picture emerges of older, widowed women functioning at 
a high level of independence and autonomy yet benefi ting 
from assistance from others, especially their children, in spe-
cifi c domains, depending on where help is needed. Research 
from other national samples in the United States, Australia, 
and Hong Kong confi rm this picture. Resilience, which may 
be expressed in a variety of ways, including recovery of posi-
tive mood, engaging in new activities, or experiencing new 
levels of effi cacy are commonly observed in the months and 
years following widowhood. Women report that widowhood 
is a very diffi cult negative life event, but that after a period 
of bereavement they fi nd themselves making a shift to a new, 
positive phase of adult life in which they both receive and 
provide social support to others (Feldman, Byles, & Beau-
mont, 2000; Dutton & Zisook, 2005; Cheng & Chan, 2006; 
Ha, Carr, Utz, & Nesse, 2006).
Widows are likely to find support from their siblings, 
children, and friends. Over time, a widow’s siblings, espe-
cially her sisters, may become a key source of emotional sup-
port and direct, instrumental assistance with home repairs 
and shopping (O’Bryant, 1988). In an exploratory analysis 
of the responses of widows in a support-group discussion, 
comments about the positive and negative contributions of 
their social support network were analyzed (Morgan, 1989). 
The widows described their nonfamily, reciprocal friendship 
relationships as somewhat more positive than their family 
relationships. In many cases, widows found that as a result 
of their own sense of family obligation, they were drawn 
into negative events occurring in their families, especially 
divorce, illness, and the death of other family members. 
These negative events added to their distress and prevented 
them from receiving the support they felt they needed at the 
time of their own loss.
The analysis also concluded that the most positive form 
of immediate support from family, especially children, was 
a willingness to accept the widow’s feelings of grief and to 
talk openly about their father. Social support from friends 
included a similar willingness to allow the widow to take 
her time in fi nding a new identity. These women did not 
want to be forced to mourn too quickly or be told how 
strong they were and how well they were handling their 
grief: “The fact that you’re using the strength that you 
have, just to cope, and to stay alive (another voice: “to sur-
vive”) is a big job and they don’t recognize that, you know 
it makes you angry” (Morgan, 1989, p. 105). The widows

list in each of these age groups, with relatively little differ-
ence between those 55 to 64 and those 65 to 74.
A range of needs may be met through leisure pursuits, 
including companionship and social integration, experienc-
ing something new and unusual, opportunities to enhance 
one’s competence and mastery, fi nding solitude and relax-
ation, opportunities for creativity and self-expression, oppor-
tunities for intellectual stimulation, and opportunities for 
community service.
Gardening. There is growing awareness of the health and 
therapeutic value of gardening. Gardening provides regu-
lar physical activity, including stretching, coordination, and 
Recent widows and widowers who were more involved in 
leisure activities had lower levels of stress than those who 
did not participate. This does not mean that they were less 
bereaved, but perhaps social activities helped them to feel 
less isolated and gave them a sense of continuing social value 
(Patterson, 1996).
Different types of leisure activities are available that meet 
a variety of psychosocial needs. Table 13.1 shows the per-
centage of older adults, ages 55 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 and 
older, who participated in fi ve types of leisure activities at 
least once in the prior year: exercise programs, playing 
sports, charity work, home improvement and repair, and 
gardening (U.S. Census Bureau, 2009). Gardening tops the 
Patterns of 
Adaptation During 
Widowhood
IN A PROSPECTIVE, longitudinal study 
of widowhood, researchers surveyed 
married couples where the husband 
was 65 years old or older. Following 
the death of one partner, the surviving 
spouse was surveyed again at 6 and 
18 months following the loss (Bonanno, 
Wortman, & Nesse, 2004). Five patterns 
of adjustment following the death of a 
spouse were described:
 1. Common grief
 2. Chronic grief
 3. Chronic depression
 4. Depression followed by 
improvement
 5. Resilience
The most common patterns, for 
56% of the sample, were common 
grief and resilience. These two groups 
had no signs of depression before the 
loss. The common grief group had 
evidence of depression at 6 months, 
but returned to pre-loss levels at 18 
months. The resilient group had low 
levels of depression even at 6 months 
following loss. Although these groups 
experienced fond memories and 
moments of yearning for their partners, 
they did not experience long-term grief 
at 18 months. A second, unexpected 
pattern, characteristic of about 10% of 
the sample, was a group that showed 
a change for the better following 
widowhood. The participants in this 
group had high levels of depression 
before the loss, and lower levels at 
6 and 18 months following the loss. 
Participants in this group were in 
unhappy marriages, and many of them 
had been caring for chronically ill 
partners. They reported being more 
confi dent and having found a new sense 
of personal strength in coping with the 
events of widowhood.
Two other groups were described 
as chronically grieving and chronically 
depressed. The chronically grieving 
group was not depressed before the 
death of their spouse, but continued 
to show high levels of depression at 
6 and 18 months following the death. 
These widows and widowers were 
often coping with the sudden loss 
of a healthy spouse and had trouble 
finding meaning in the death of their 
partners. The chronically depressed 
were already depressed prior to the 
death of their spouse. The death 
added a new stressor that increased 
their levels of depression at 6 and 
18 months after the loss.
Subsequent studies of the transition 
from caregiver to widow support the 
idea that the conditions that surround 
the caregiving role, and the quality of 
the marital bond, as well as the physical 
and mental health of the surviving 
spouse, will infl uence the coping 
process (Pruchno, Cartwright, &  
Wilson-Genderson, 2009). The 
majority of adults are able to cope 
effectively with the loss of a spouse. 
An understanding of the context of 
the loss and the emotional well-being 
of the surviving spouse before the loss 
are important factors that infl uence the 
bereavement process. Those striving to 
support widows and widowers need to 
be mindful of these differences in order 
to offer appropriate interventions.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. What are the contexts of widowhood 
that might determine how a person 
adjusts to loss?
 2. Imagine that a person has spent sev-
eral years caring for a dying spouse. 
What aspects of role loss might occur 
upon the death of the spouse?
 3. Consider the case of couples who 
have been happily married for 
40 years or more. What might be 
some challenges of widowhood 
when one spouse dies? What are 
the resources that might be useful 
to support adjustment under these 
conditions?
 4. How might widowhood infl uence the 
resolution of the psychosocial crisis 
of integrity versus despair for the 
surviving spouse, either positively or 
negatively?
 5. What are some cultural practices or 
beliefs regarding widowhood that 
might impact the process of grief or 
bereavement?

weight resistance. Depending on the size and demands of 
the garden, gardening can help an older adult meet the rec-
ommendations for half an hour of physical activity each day. 
Gardening requires planning, research, and problem solv-
ing. Preparing a garden, evaluating plants and their care, 
and monitoring their health and growth are natural forms of 
cognitive stimulation, which can be enhanced with classes, 
books and magazines, and online resources. Gardening is 
a stress-reducing activity, especially when approached in 
an appropriate pace and with tools that are well adapted to 
one’s physical capacities. The sensory components of the 
garden, including smells, colors, and textures, can have a 
soothing, reassuring impact. Gardening can be an expres-
sion of generative motives, providing a lasting contribution 
to the community through the planting of public gardens 
or the enhancement of public spaces. Gardens are increas-
ingly incorporated into senior centers and nursing homes 
to encourage cognitive, sensory, and motor activity, and to 
provide a positive opportunity for exercising mastery. Mas-
ter Gardener programs are sponsored by many universities 
where adult volunteers learn about up-to-date research-based 
information on horticulture to share with home gardeners 
and implement in the beautifi cation of their communities 
(Morgan, 2005).
Volunteerism. Volunteerism is a salient area for activ-
ity among older adults. In the United States, among those 65 
and older, about 25% volunteer, giving a median of 90 hours 
annually of unpaid time (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009). 
Especially in the year or two following retirement, individuals 
who are not already involved in volunteer service are especially 
open to considering it (Caro & Bass, 1997). Volunteering pro-
vides a meaningful structure to daily life, especially when other 
signifi cant work and family roles are becoming less demanding. 
High rates of volunteering are associated with increases in life 
satisfaction and improved perceptions of physical health (Van 
Willigen, 2000). At the same time, certain types of volunteer 
work have been shown to have a positive impact on cognitive 
complexity and memory functions. The opportunities to assume 
new responsibilities and learn new skills are two of the rewards 
of volunteering in later adulthood (Newman, Karip, & Faux,

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
Developing a Point of 
View About Death
Objective 4. To describe the development of a point of 
view about death.
During later adulthood, it is inevitable that serious, possibly 
frightening, preoccupations about death will fi ll the individ-
ual’s thoughts. In middle adulthood, most people experience 
the death of their parents. During later adulthood, one’s peers, 
including siblings and spouses, may die. These deaths are 
sources of psychological stress and require the emotional pro-
cess of grief and mourning and the cognitive strain of trying 
to accept or understand them. At the same time, these deaths 
stimulate a more immediate recognition of one’s own mortality.
Changing Perspectives About Death
The development of a perspective on death is a continuous 
process that begins in childhood and is not fully resolved 
until later adulthood. The earliest concern with death, which 
occurs during toddlerhood, refl ects an inability to conceive 
of an irreversible state of lifelessness. Toddlers are likely 
to think that a person may be dead at one moment and 
“undeaded” the next. By middle school age, children have 
a rather realistic concept of death, but they are unlikely to 
relate that concept to themselves or to others close to them 
(Kastenbaum, 1992). Thoughts about one’s death and the 
formulation of a conceptualization of death become increas-
ingly well articulated from early through later adolescence 
(Noppe & Noppe, 1997). In the process of forming a per-
sonal identity, young people ask new questions about mortal-
ity, the meaning of life, and the possibility of life after death.
During middle adulthood, people recognize that they 
have already lived more than half of their lives. There is 
more time in the past than in the future. The issue of death 
becomes increasingly concrete as parents and older relatives 
die. At the same time, adults begin to have a larger impact on 
their families and communities. Increased feelings of effec-
tiveness and vitality lessen the threat of death. The degree 
to which individuals gain satisfaction from their own contri-
butions to future generations determines the extent of their 
anxiety about death during this stage. The achievement of a 
sense of generativity usually allows adults to accept that their 
impact will continue to be felt even after death.
Ideally, during later adulthood, ego concerns about death 
decrease. Individuals come to accept their own lives as they 
have lived them and begin to see death as a natural part of the 
life span. Death no longer poses a threat to personal value, the 
potential for accomplishment, or the desire to infl uence the lives 
of others. As a result of having accepted one’s life, one can accept 
its end without discouragement. As the case of Morrie Schwartz 
suggests, coming to terms with death does not imply a desire for 
but an acceptance of the fact of death. Along with this accep-
tance may come a greater appreciation for life itself. It takes great 
courage to face the fact of one’s own death and, at the same time, 
Exercise. Physical exercise is becoming a focus of leisure 
activity for increasing numbers of older adults because the 
benefi ts are linked to better health, positive self-esteem, 
and a new zest for life. Almost 50% of adults ages 65 to 
74 reported being involved in an exercise program dur-
ing the prior 12 months. Research suggests a relationship 
between physical fi tness—especially a regular pattern of 
aerobic exercise—and the improvement of certain visual-
spatial cognitive abilities that typically decline with age. 
In the past, professionals were reluctant to encourage vig-
orous activity for older adults. They believed that a per-
son who was unaccustomed to active physical exercise 
might be harmed by it. However, research on exercise in 
adulthood suggests that adults profi t from a program of 
exercise, and that through systematic exercise, some of 
the negative consequences of a sedentary lifestyle can be 
reversed (Riebe, Burbank, & Garber, 2002). For example, 
Hopkins and her associates described a program in which 
women ages 57 to 77 participated in a low-impact aerobic 
dance class three times a week for 12 weeks. The program 
included stretching, walking, dance movements, large 
arm movements, and major leg muscle movement. After 
12 weeks, the group showed improvement in cardiorespi-
ratory endurance (walking half a mile as fast as possible), 
flexibility, muscle strength, body agility, and balance. 
A comparison group of women who did not participate 
showed stability or decline in all of these areas (Hopkins, 
Murrah, Hoeger, & Rhodes, 1990).
Physical exercise has been identified as a component 
of optimal aging. Regular participation in moderate activ-
ity, such as walking, biking, or gardening, for 30 min-
utes a day may provide protection from certain chronic 
diseases and ease the discomfort of arthritis (DiPietro, 
2001). Exercise is associated with increased muscle tone, 
strength, and endurance, which build confidence about 
one’s body movement, coordination, and stamina. Exer-
cise also increases perceptions of self-control and self-
efficacy in meeting one’s own needs. As a result, people 
who exercise tend to have a generally more positive self-
evaluation and higher levels of self-confidence than their 
inactive peers (Fontane, 1996; Clark, Long, & Schiffman, 
1999). Fitness training has also been shown to contribute 
to improved cognitive functioning in older adults, espe-
cially in the area of executive control processes such as 
decision making, problem solving, and emotional regula-
tion (Kramer & Willis, 2002).
Redirection of energy to new roles in later adulthood 
requires a degree of fl exibility and resilience that often goes 
unnoticed in observations of older adults. Try to imagine 
what life might be like for you 30 or 40 years from now. Will 
you be prepared to embrace the technology, lifestyle, or age 
role expectations that you will encounter during your own 
later adulthood? We are impressed by how readily most 
older adults adapt to new roles, especially those of retiree 
and widow, for which there is little early preparation or 
social reward.

 
Developmental Tasks | 549
“Do what the Buddhists do. Every day, have a little bird on 
your shoulder that asks, ‘Is today the day? Am I ready? Am I do-
ing all I need to do? Am I being the person I want to be?’” He 
turned his head to his shoulder as if the bird were there now.
“Is today the day I die?” he said. . . .
“The truth is, Mitch,” he said, “once you learn how to die, 
you learn how to live.” I nodded.
“I’m going to say it again,” he said. “Once you learn how 
to die, you learn how to live.” He smiled, and I realized what 
he was doing. He was making sure I absorbed this point, 
without embarrassing me by asking. It was part of what made 
him a good teacher.
“Did you think much about death before you got sick?” 
I asked.
“No.” Morrie smiled. “I was like everyone else. I once told 
a friend of mine, in a moment of exuberance, ‘I’m gonna be 
the healthiest old man you ever met!’”
“How old were you?” 
“In my sixties.”
“So you were optimistic.”
“Why not? Like I said, no one really believes they’re going 
to die.”
“But everyone knows someone who has died,” I said. 
“Why is it so hard to think about dying?”
“Because,” Morrie continued, “most of us all walk around 
as if we’re sleepwalking. We really don’t experience the 
world fully, because we’re half-asleep, doing things we auto-
matically think we have to do.” . . .
“Mitch. Can I tell you something?” 
“Of course,” I said.
“You might not like it.” 
“Why not?”
“Well, the truth is, if you really listen to that bird on your 
shoulder, if you accept that you can die at any time—then 
you might not be as ambitious as you are.” I forced a small 
grin. “The things you spend so much time on—all the work 
you do—might not seem as important. You might have to 
make room for some more spiritual things.”
“Spiritual things?”
“You hate that word, don’t you? ‘Spiritual.’ You think it’s 
touchy-feely stuff.”
“Well,” I said.
He tried to wink, a bad try, and I broke down and laughed. 
“Mitch,” he said, laughing along, “even I don’t know what 
‘spiritual development’ really means. But I do know we’re de-
fi cient in some way. We are too involved in materialistic things, 
and they don’t satisfy us. The loving relationships we have, the 
universe around us, we take these things for granted.”
He nodded toward the window with the sunshine stream-
ing in. “You see that? You can go out there, outside, anytime. 
You can run up and down the block and go crazy. I can’t do 
that. I can’t go out. I can’t run. I can’t be out there without 
fear of getting sick. But you know what? I appreciate that 
window more than you do.”

to live out the days of one’s life with optimism and enthusiasm. 
Older adults who achieve this degree of acceptance of their 
death appreciate that the usefulness of their contributions does 
not necessarily depend on their physical presence (Kübler-Ross, 
1969, 1972).
The notion that one’s understanding of the concept of 
death changes with development is complemented by the 
idea that people go through a process in coming to terms 
with their own death. In the 1960s, Elisabeth Kübler-Ross 
engaged in groundbreaking work to understand the thoughts, 
feelings, and needs of patients who were dying. Through her 
interviews with more than 400 patients, she began to clar-
ify a process of coping with one’s death. She identifi ed fi ve 
stages that are likely to occur between the awareness of a ter-
minal illness and ultimate acceptance of one’s death: denial; 
anger and resentment; bargaining for a reprieve; depression 
and mourning one’s death; and acceptance or a willingness 
to face the reality of one’s death. She also discovered how 
eager most people were to have someone who would listen 
to their thoughts and how grateful they were to interact with 
someone about their death rather than have it treated as a 
taboo or unmentionable topic (Kübler-Ross, 1969, 1981).
Subsequent research has suggested that there is no sin-
gle, typical path in the dying process. Some people alternate 
between accepting and denying their death. They understand 
their situation, yet fall into periods of disbelief. Some people 
are able to bring what they view as an acceptable close to 
their life, saying good-bye to family and friends, and fi nding 
comfort in the support of others. Others die while still in 
a state of fear or denial (Kastenbaum, 1981, 1985). Kübler-
Ross’s stages are neither a universal nor fi xed sequence but 
they do serve as a useful model for considering the dynamic 
ego processes that are engaged as one faces death. The capac-
ity to confront the reality of death can be seen as a profound 
occasion for new insight.
CASE STUDY
MORRIE SCHWARTZ REFLECTS ON HIS 
VIEWS ABOUT DEATH
Mitch Albom, in his forties, rediscovered his former college 
professor, Morrie Schwartz, who was dying from amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurological disease that 
attacks body muscles and leaves one increasingly paralyzed. 
Mitch and Morrie met every Tuesday for the last 4 months of 
Morrie’s life.
“Everyone knows they’re going to die,” he said again, “but 
nobody believes it. If we did, we would do things differently.”
“So we kid ourselves about death,” I said.
“Yes. But there’s a better approach. To know you’re going 
to die, and to be prepared for it at any time. That’s better. 
That way you can actually be more involved in your life while 
you’re living.”
“How can you ever be prepared to die?”

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
of which relate to the actual process of dying and others to 
the consequences of it. Concerns about the process of dying 
include fears of being alone, being in pain, having others see 
one suffering, or losing control of one’s mind and body. Con-
cerns about the consequences of dying include fears of the 
unknown, loss of identity (“People will forget about me”), 
the grief that others will feel, the decomposition of the body, 
and punishment or pain in the hereafter (Tomer & Eliason, 
2000).
Several researchers have considered the sources of per-
sonal anxiety about death and the changes in preoccupation 
with death at various ages. Although older adults seem to 
think about death more frequently than do young adults, 
they do not appear to feel more threatened by it. In com-
parison to middle-aged adults, older adults experience lower 
death anxiety (Sinoff, Iosipovici, Almog, & Barnett-Greens, 
2008). Among the elderly, it appears that those who have 
higher levels of self-worth and sense of mastery also have 
lower levels of death anxiety (Ron, 2010). In comparison 
to those in early or middle adulthood, those in later adult-
hood know more people who have died and are more likely 
to have visited a cemetery or attended a funeral. Those in 
later adulthood are more likely to have made some specifi c 
arrangements related to their death, including purchasing 
cemetery space, writing a will, or making plans for their 
funeral. Their concrete experiences with the events of death, 
coupled with their own sense of mastery in preparing for 
their death may allow them to cope more effectively with 
their fears (Cicirelli, 2001).
What factors help older people cope with fears about 
death? Several resources have been identified. Psychoso-
cial theory predicts that through acts of generativity, peo-
ple experience satisfaction in guiding and nurturing future 
CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. What is the point of view about life and death that Morrie 
is developing?
 2. Why is it diffi cult for most people to listen to a dying per-
son express his or her thoughts about death?
 3. What does this conversation suggest about Morrie’s psy-
chosocial development? To what extent are issues of inti-
macy, generativity, and integrity refl ected in this dialogue?
 4. How might the conditions of Morrie’s illness infl uence his 
outlook on death?
 5. What issues would you want to discuss if you had a mentor 
like Morrie who was willing to help you learn about living 
and dying?
The formulation of a point of view about death requires 
the capacity to absorb the loss of one’s close relatives and 
friends and to accept one’s own death. The former task may 
be even more diffi cult than the latter, in that the death of peers 
begins to destroy one’s social group. Losing one’s friends and 
relatives means losing daily companionship, a shared world of 
memories and plans, and a source of support for values and 
social norms. The circumstances surrounding the deaths of 
others may also be very frightening. Older adults observe their 
peers suffering through long illnesses, dying abruptly in the 
midst of a thriving and vigorous life, or dying in absurd, mean-
ingless accidents. After each death, the surviving adults must 
ask themselves about the value of these lives and subsequently 
about the value of their own life.
Death Anxiety
Fear of personal death, or death anxiety, is natural and 
normal. Death may be feared for a variety of reasons, some

The Psychosocial Crisis: Integrity versus Despair | 551
step back and fi nd a way to integrate or reconcile the events 
of their life with the hopes and dreams they may have had 
in their early or middle adulthood. This process of meaning 
making involves an assessment of one’s life and the extent 
to which worthwhile goals were sought and achieved. In a 
search for life’s meaning, a person looks for a way to assem-
ble a coherent story of order, purpose, and value out of the 
complex puzzle pieces of a life (Reker, 1997; Krause, 2004). 
The attainment of integrity is ultimately a result of the bal-
ance of all the psychosocial crises that have come earlier, 
accompanied by all the ego strengths and core pathologies 
that have accumulated along the way. Integrity comes only 
after some considerable thought about the meaning of one’s 
life. Older adults who have achieved a sense of integrity 
view their past in an existential light. They appreciate that 
their lives and individuality are due to an accumulation of 
personal satisfactions and crises. Integrity is not so much a 
quality of honesty and trustworthiness—as the term is used 
in daily speech—as it is an ability to integrate one’s past his-
tory with one’s present circumstances and to feel content 
with the outcome.
Most people have some regrets. One may look back and 
wish that one had taken advantage of certain opportuni-
ties, been smarter about saving or investing money, or spent 
more time with one’s children while they were young (Baum, 
1999). The challenge in achieving integrity is to face the 
decisions and experiences of the past with acceptance. In 
this process, a person seeks to fi nd an integrative thread that 
makes sense of the life one has led without belaboring past 
mistakes.
Given the very abstract and subjective construct of integ-
rity, how can it be measured? One approach was devised by 
Neil Krause (2007) who created a four-dimensional measure 
of meaning in life. These dimensions included: (1) having a 
system of values, (2) having a sense of purpose, (3) having 
goals to strive for, and (4) refl ecting on the past to recon-
cile one’s accomplishments with one’s goals. Taken together, 
these four dimensions comprised a meaning in life scale. In 
a longitudinal study of older adults, Krause examined how 
various forms of social support as well as anticipated social 
support related to meaning in life over a 4-year period. Those 
older adults who received high levels of emotional support 
had higher meaning in life, but those who received tangible 
social support had lower meaning in life. Anticipated sup-
port, that is believing that you could call upon close fam-
ily and friends for help if it were needed, was the strongest 
predictor of meaning in life. Over time, anticipated support 
was also a signifi cant predictor of changes in a person’s sense 
of meaning. When older adults are confi dent that they will 
be able to count on others for help in the future, their sense 
of meaning in life is bolstered. This finding speaks to the 
role of the radius of signifi cant relationships in predicting 
and sustaining a sense of integrity in later adulthood. It also 
suggests a continuing role for trust and hope, the very earli-
est psychosocial concepts of infancy, in fostering integrity in 
late life.
generations. Achieving a positive resolution to the psycho-
social crisis of generativity versus stagnation should help 
reduce death anxiety. One study designed to test this hypoth-
esis found that the relationship of generativity to the fear of 
death was mediated by ego integrity, the positive pole of the 
crisis of later adulthood. Among those who were described 
as generative, the older adults who also had high levels of 
ego integrity had the least fear of death, supporting the the-
oretical notion of a progressive integration of ego strengths 
from one stage of life to the next (Bringle, 2007).
In addition to the achievement of a generative orienta-
tion, people who describe themselves as religious, those who 
have a strong social support system, and those who have a 
strong sense of self-worth are less likely to be preoccupied 
with the fear of death (Tomer & Eliason, 2000). Frey (2003) 
extended this perspective by focusing on the relationship of 
self-beliefs to death anxiety. Older adults who have a positive 
sense of self-effi cacy have less fear of the unknown following 
death and less fear of the pain and suffering associated with 
dying. In particular, the sense of spiritual self-effi cacy—one’s 
perceived ability to generate spiritually based faith and inner 
strength—was strongly associated with low levels of death 
anxiety.
The Psychosocial Crisis: 
Integrity versus Despair
Objective 5. To explain the psychosocial crisis of integrity 
versus despair, the central process of introspection, the 
prime adaptive ego quality of wisdom, and the core 
pathology of disdain.
The confl ict of integrity versus despair is resolved through 
a dynamic process of life review, introspection, and self-
evaluation. Contemporary factors, such as health, family 
relationships, and role loss or role transitions, are integrated 
with an assessment of one’s past aspirations and accomplish-
ments. Thoughts of the past may be fl eeting or a constant 
obsession. Memories may be altered to fit contemporary 
events, or contemporary events may be reinterpreted to fi t 
memories. The achievement of integrity is the culmination 
of a life of psychosocial growth. Psychologically speaking, it 
is the peak of the pyramid, in that it addresses the ultimate 
question, “How do I fi nd meaning in life given the ultimate 
reality of death?” Achievement of integrity in later adulthood 
inspires younger age groups to continue to struggle with the 
challenges of their own life stages.
Integrity
The term integrity, as it is used in psychosocial theory, 
refers to the ability to accept the facts of one’s life and face 
death without great fear. As people get older, they need to

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
adults between 18 and 44 years old (National Academy 
on an Aging Society, 2000). About 5% of older adults liv-
ing independently are experiencing depression at any one 
time; about 15% experience depression sometime in later life 
(Castleman, 2001).
Many of the same factors that are associated with depres-
sion in younger age groups are also associated with depres-
sion in older age groups: poverty, poor physical health, lack of 
social involvement, and being single, divorced, or widowed. 
The risk of depression in later life cannot be attributed to 
the aging process itself. The negative physiological changes 
associated with aging—such as high blood pressure, reduced 
breathing capacity, reduced muscle strength, slower reaction 
time, memory loss, and loss of visual or auditory acuity—are 
not associated with depression in and of themselves (Hinrich-
sen & Clougherty, 2006). However, among older adults, those 
who rate their own health as fair to poor and those who have 
a chronic condition are more likely to be depressed than those 
who say their health is good to excellent. Whether the illness 
contributes to the depression or the depression leads people to 
be more discouraged by their physical limitations is diffi cult 
to say. Thus, depression as a complex affective and cognitive 
syndrome does not automatically come with the territory of 
aging, but it occurs in a subset of older adults. It is especially 
likely among those who have experienced a decreased activ-
ity level; have reduced access to a signifi cant, close, confi ding 
relationship; and have accumulated physical health problems 
that limit their independence and dampen the sense of enthu-
siasm for pleasant activities (U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services, 1999).
The Central Process: 
Introspection
In order to achieve a sense of integrity, the individual must 
engage in deliberate self-evaluation and private thought. The 
fi nal achievement of a sense of integrity requires the ability 
to introspect about the gradual evolution of life events and 
to appreciate their signifi cance in the formation of the adult 
personality (Walasky, Whitbourne, & Nehrke, 1983–1984). 
This state can be reached only through individual effort. It 
may even require temporary isolation, shutting out the infl u-
ences of potentially competitive or resentful associates. One 
mode for engaging in self-evaluation is reminiscence.
Reminiscence has been defined as the recollection of 
“long-term memories of events in which the reminiscer is 
either a participant or an observer” (Ross, 1989, p. 341). 
This process of nostalgic remembering allows adults to 
recapture some of the memorable events in their life histo-
ries. Reminiscence may be a playful recalling of a life adven-
ture or a painful review of some personal or family crisis. 
The process of simple reminiscence has been described as 
comprising four elements: the selection of an event or story to 
retell or review; immersion in the details of the story, includ-
ing the strong emotions linked to the event; withdrawal from 
Despair
The opposite pole of integrity is despair. It is much more 
likely that adults will resolve the crisis of integrity versus 
despair in the negative direction than that infants will resolve 
the crisis of trust versus mistrust in the negative direction. 
For infants to experience trust, they must depend on the 
benevolence of a responsible caregiver who will meet their 
essential needs. In most cases, this caregiver is present, 
and the infant learns to rely on others. In order to experi-
ence integrity, however, older adults must incorporate into 
their self-image a lifelong record of confl icts, failures, and 
disappointments, along with accomplishments. They must 
confront what is sometimes referred to as the “death of 
dreams”—a realization that some of their most cherished 
hopes for themselves or their children cannot be accom-
plished in their lifetime (Oates, 1997).
Older adults may also face some degree of ageism—devalu-
ation and even hostility from the social community. The nega-
tive attitudes expressed by family members, colleagues, and 
younger people toward the perceived lack of competence, 
dependence, or old-fashioned ways of older people may lead 
many of them to feel discouraged about their self-worth. The 
gradual deterioration or loss of certain physical capacities—
particularly hearing, vision, and motor agility—contribute to 
an older person’s frustration and discouragement. Older adults 
recognize that they cannot perform certain tasks as well as they 
did in the past or that their domains of independent function-
ing and mastery have diminished.
Furthermore, there is a general cultural sentiment that the 
death of an older person—in contrast, for example, with the 
death of a child or youth—though sad, is not a great loss 
to society, because that person had already contributed to 
society and lived a full life. Thus, older adults may perceive 
that society is already letting go of them, even before they are 
ready to let go of life (Jecker & Schneiderman, 1994).
All of these factors are likely to create a feeling of regret 
about one’s past and a continuous, haunting desire to be able 
to do things differently, or of bitterness over how one’s life 
has turned out. People who resolve the crisis of later adult-
hood in the direction of despair cannot resist speculating 
about how things might have been or what actions might 
have been taken if conditions had only been different. They 
are preoccupied with the if-only’s of their past, disrupting a 
calm acceptance of death. Despairing individuals either seek 
death as a way of ending a miserable existence or desperately 
fear death because it makes impossible any hope of compen-
sating for past failures.
Depression
The theme of depression has been treated in several sec-
tions of this text. Given the close link between the concepts 
of depression and despair, it should come as no surprise 
that depression has been a topic of research in the study of 
adulthood and aging. Contrary to stereotypes, the popula-
tion with depression is composed largely (61%) of younger

care about my feelings or needs. But as I grow older and 
look back, I understand that they were really not compatible 
with each other. They had suffered for many years before 
their divorce. [Integrative reminiscence]
My husband died when I was away for two days visiting 
my friends in the West. He fell in the bathtub and eventually 
died because there was no one there to help him. It has been 
years now, but I still cannot forgive myself for leaving him 
home alone for two days. [Obsessive reminiscence] (Wong & 
Watt, 1991, p. 276)
Reminiscence appears to lend continuity to older adults’ 
self-concepts. They can trace the path of their own develop-
ment through time and identify moments that were of central 
importance in the crystallization of their personal philoso-
phies. Through reminiscence, older adults can revise the 
meaning of past events by using current wisdom to under-
stand or accept what took place in the past. For example, 
reminiscence was encouraged in a group of veterans who 
had been involved in the Normandy invasion at the end of 
World War II. The veterans retold their experiences of loss, 
grief, and shock, and how those experiences infl uenced their 
lives over the subsequent 50-year period. Formulating their 
experiences in a story-like format and retelling their stories 
to others provided a means of coping with the stressors of 
this past experience (Harvey, Stein, & Scott, 1995).
Reminiscence serves as an integrating process that has 
positive value in an eventual attainment of integrity. In a 
review of 20 studies with older adults who suffered from 
depression, guided reminiscence was found to be as effective 
as drug treatment or psychotherapy for alleviating depressive 
symptoms (Bohlmeijer, Smit, & Cuijpers, 2003). In excess, 
however, reminiscence can dominate reality, taking over the 
time and energy that might be directed toward more appro-
priate active social involvement. Some adults tend to dwell 
on sad events and allow earlier disappointments to pre-
occupy their current thoughts. In that case, their past lives 
take precedence over their current circumstances. No new 
events can compete successfully with past memories for their 
attention. The focus of reminiscence depends on personality, 
the specifi c nature of stressful life events, and the degree to 
which the older person is searching for new levels of self-
understanding (Cappeliez & O’Rourke, 2002).
The Prime Adaptive 
Ego Quality and the 
Core Pathology
Wisdom
When people are asked about the positive goals of later 
life, they frequently mention wisdom, which they expect 
to emerge in later adulthood and to grow with increasing 
age. Wisdom is defi ned as the “fundamental pragmatics of 
the past by distancing oneself from the event or compar-
ing past and present; and bringing closure to the memory 
by summing up, fi nding some lesson, or making a general 
observation. Through this kind of process, a person builds a 
mental and emotional bridge between the past and the pres-
ent (Meacham, 1995).
Reminiscence is linked to positive adjustment in later life, 
especially better health, a more positive outlook, and a better 
ability to cope with the challenges of daily life. However, not 
all forms of reminiscence are of equal benefi t. In particular, 
reminiscences of the integrative or instrumental type tend to 
be associated with high levels of well-being, whereas obses-
sive reminiscences are not. Integrative reminiscence involves 
reviewing one’s past in order to fi nd meaning or to recon-
cile one’s current and prior feelings about certain life events. 
Instrumental reminiscence focuses on the past, on accomplish-
ments, efforts to overcome diffi culties, and experiences to 
help cope with current difficulties. Obsessive reminiscence 
suggests an inability to resolve or accept certain past events 
and a persistent guilt or despair about them (Wong & Watt, 
1991). Contrast the following two narratives:

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
One of the concepts that helps link the idea of intel-
ligence in later adulthood with the ego strength of wisdom 
is expertise. With age, individuals who focus their intel-
ligence in intensive study, training, and repeated oppor-
tunities for problem solving within a domain become 
experts. A variety of intellectual processes support exper-
tise, including deductive reasoning, a rich and com-
plex working memory, and the ability to organize large 
amounts of information for storage and subsequent recall. 
We rely on experts to help inform important and diffi cult 
decisions. In that sense, we come to see experts as hav-
ing wisdom in their particular specialization. Although 
we may be inclined to look to experts in one field to 
help us solve a wide range of problems, the assumption 
behind expertise is that it is discipline specific. In that 
sense, expertise and wisdom are not identical (Horn & 
Masunaga, 2000; Masunaga & Horn, 2001).
Not all people who live to old age function at a high level 
of wisdom. However, when older people are asked to focus 
their responses on excellence and virtue, they appear to be 
able to generate solutions that are characterized by higher 
levels of wisdom. Moreover, people interacting together or 
even refl ecting on the inner voice of those whom they con-
sider wise are better able to produce rich, contextualized, 
and subtle responses (Baltes & Staudinger, 2000).
Three dimensions that have been hypothesized to pro-
mote wisdom are (1) opportunities to experience a wide vari-
ety of life situations and circumstances; (2) encouragement 
by a mentor or guide to expand one’s capacity for thinking 
about problems from a multidimensional, psychohistorical 
perspective; and (3) a strong generative orientation or desire 
to continue to gain insight into how people meet the chal-
lenges of life (Baltes & Smith, 1990).
life”—a type of expert knowledge that refl ects sound judg-
ment and good advice about “planning, managing, and 
understanding a good life” in the face of typically high levels 
of uncertainty (Baltes & Staudinger, 2000). Erikson identi-
fi ed wisdom as the prime adaptive ego quality of later adult-
hood, in that it reflects a detached concern for life and a 
desire to learn and communicate essential lessons from expe-
rience in the face of impending death (Erikson et al., 1986).
Wisdom has been characterized by five basic features 
(Baltes, Smith, & Staudinger, 1992, p. 272; Kramer, 2003; 
Ardelt, 2004; Staudinger, Dorner, & Mickler, 2005):
 1. Factual knowledge about fundamental life matters, such 
as general knowledge about the human condition and 
specifi c knowledge about life events, their age-related oc-
currence, and their expected and unexpected course.
 2. Procedural knowledge, composed of strategies for ap-
proaching the management and interpretation of life 
matters, including linking past, present, and future.
 3. Life-span contextualism, approaching problems with the 
realization that events are embedded in a multidimen-
sional context—including age-related, culturally  defi ned, 
role-related, and sociohistorical frameworks—and that 
events take their meaning from certain distinct domains, 
especially family, work, and leisure.
 4. Relativism of values and life goals, allowing the person to ap-
preciate differences among individuals and societies with 
respect to the priorities they place on certain values, as well 
as the ability to preserve a certain core of universal values.
 5. Recognition and management of uncertainty, incorporating 
the realization that the future cannot be totally predicted 
and that many aspects of the past and present are not 
fully known, plus an ability to manage and cope with this 
uncertainty.
Joseph looks forward to these 
quiet talks with his father. He 
knows he will always come 
away with new insight about 
planning, managing, or under-
standing the challenges he is 
facing in his own life.

Projections from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indi-
cate that in the coming 10 years there will be an increas-
ing involvement of older adults in the labor force. Table 
13.2 shows the percentage of men and women at two ages, 
65 to 74 and 75 and older, who were in the labor force in 
1988, 1998, and 2008 as well as projections for 2018. The 
rate of labor force participation was relatively stable for 
those in later adulthood and elderhood between 1988 and 
1998. However, by 2008, rates increased substantially, espe-
cially for women, and by 2018 about one third of men and 
close to 30% of women in later adulthood will be working. 
Thus, although retirement will still be normative in later life, 
a growing segment of the older population will be work-
ing (U.S. Senate, Special Committee on Aging, 1986; U.S. 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009).
Adjustment to Retirement
Adjustment during the retirement transition is an individual 
process. Most older adults cope effectively with the changes 
associated with retirement, viewing it as a desired transition. 
In retrospect, however, they often realize that preparation 
for retirement should have included more emphasis on the 
psychosocial aspects of this change rather than focusing so 
exclusively on its fi nancial impact. Retirement is a major life 
change; those who cope successfully with it tend to be more 
optimistic, actively confronting new challenges and remain-
ing physically active in the transition (Sharpley & Yardley, 
1999; Rosenkoetter & Garris, 2001).
Weiss (1997) described a longitudinal study of men and 
women who were over age 63 and intended to retire in the 
coming year or had recently retired. Most anticipated that 
retirement would bring a reduction in stress, especially 
in coping with the challenges and crises of the workplace. 
Workplace conditions such as lack of challenge, reorgani-
zation, and downsizing (with its accompanying increased 
demands on the remaining employees) are stressors that 
workers are glad to leave behind when they retire (Henkens 
& Tazelaar, 1997). In a study of young retirees ages 51 to 
59, the most commonly mentioned positive aspects of retire-
ment were the lack of pressure, more time with their spouse, 
and the ability to relax. In contrast, their greatest concerns 
were fi nancial (not being able to keep up with infl ation) and 
health concerns (National Academy on an Aging Society, 
2001). In contrast to those who are adjusting easily, a subset 
Disdain
Wisdom refl ects fl exibility of thought, openness to new inter-
pretations, and a willingness to accept the complexity of life. 
In contrast, disdain conveys a rejection of ideas and persons 
and an arrogance that implies one’s own opinions and views 
are superior. It can be understood as a defensive response to 
the repulsion for one’s physical self and failed past. Rather 
than becoming more patient, more compassionate, and less 
critical in their later life, older adults who develop disdain 
are more likely to express contempt for others and detach 
from the world around them (Erikson et al., 1986).
APPLIED TOPIC
Retirement
Objective 6. To apply theory and research to under-
standing the process of adjustment to retirement in later 
adulthood.
RETIREMENT IS A social and psychological construct that 
has a variety of definitions. One definition of retirement 
is that the person works less than full-time year round and 
receives income from a retirement pension earned during ear-
lier periods of employment. Some people defi ne retirement 
as the time at which people begin to receive social security or 
other pension benefi ts, regardless of their employment status. 
However, retirement also refers to a psychosocial transition—
a predictable, normative change that involves preparation, 
redefi nition of roles and role behaviors, and ongoing psycho-
logical adjustment as the structure and signifi cance of paid 
employment are replaced by other activities (Atchley, 2003).
Of course, some people never retire; some die before they 
reach retirement age, and others continue to work on a part-
time schedule. Some people of retirement age leave their 
primary job and take another full-time or part-time job in a 
related fi eld or in a totally different one. Many adults who are 
self-employed or whose work involves creative skills, such as 
acting, music, painting, or writing, simply continue to work 
into their late adulthood (Herzog, House, & Morgan, 1991). 
In fact, from a historical perspective, retirement is a relatively 
new concept. At the turn of the 20th century, almost 70% of 
men over the age of 65 were in the paid labor force.

confl ict. In this case, the stress of the role transition from 
work to retirement seems to be compounded by the lack 
of synchrony between the partners in the structure of their 
daily lives (Moen, Kim, & Hofmeister, 2001).
Diffi culties with Retirement
Perceptions of retirement involve a person’s enthusiasm, 
positive anticipation, or resentment about it. This is linked 
to the important ways in which work structures one’s life-
style throughout early and middle adulthood. In addition 
to the obvious functions of paid employment—especially 
income and social status—a number of latent functions pro-
vide important psychological benefi ts (Jahoda, 1982; Lo & 
Brown, 1999). Work provides a structure for the use of 
time; a context for social contact; a content for self-identity; 
regular, predictable activities into which one can channel 
intellectual, physical, and emotional energy; and a sense of 
participation in a collective effort. Retirement may be per-
ceived as resulting in deprivation in each of these areas and 
therefore presents a threat to psychological well-being.
Several measures have been devised to assess the stresses 
associated with retirement and the anxiety that people feel as 
they anticipate it. Sharpley (1997) found that when retirees 
refl ected on factors that caused them stress in everyday liv-
ing, three areas emerged: missing work, problems with per-
sonal health, and relationship issues. Fletcher and Hansson 
(1991) constructed a measure of retirement anxiety that 
captures some of the apprehensions that adults have as they 
anticipate retirement. It illustrates how people come to rely 
on work as a primary social structure and highlights the dif-
fi culties they face as they confront the transition to retire-
ment. For those who suffered from retirement anxiety, two 
of retirees report declines in life satisfaction, especially those 
who experience significant income loss, poor health, or 
death of a spouse, events that are age-related and may not 
be attributed specifi cally to retirement. Approximately one 
third of adults report signifi cant diffi culty during this process 
(Pinquart & Schindler, 2007).
From a systems perspective, it makes sense to think about 
adaptation to retirement in the context of the other life 
roles one is playing. One of the most relevant is the marital 
relationship. With the large number of married women in 
the labor market, it is important to consider the impact of 
retirement for a couple as well as for the individual. Retire-
ment transitions can involve one partner remaining in the 
labor market when the other retires, both partners retiring at 
about the same time, and one or both partners retiring from 
their primary work and becoming involved in secondary 
work after retirement. These confi gurations can have con-
sequences for the couple’s marital satisfaction because the 
change in work status affects their relationship.
The Cornell Retirement and Well-Being Study focused on 
workers and retirees ages 50 to 72. Participants were inter-
viewed once in 1994–1995 and again in 1996–1997. Among 
the people in this sample, 25% were not yet retired and their 
spouses were also not yet retired. For another 36%, both the 
respondent and the respondent’s spouse were retired. In the 
remainder, one spouse was working and the other spouse 
was retired. Several observations were made about marital 
quality during this transition. First, both men and women 
reported decreases in marital quality when they moved from 
work to retirement. The role transition from work to retire-
ment appears to have a short-term negative impact on the 
marriage. Second, if one spouse remains in the labor market 
and the other retires, the retired partner reports more marital

Retirement | 557
Today we have an entire generation of Americans who 
seem dedicated to the proposition that they will fi ght aging 
to the death. Quite literally. And that means staying front and 
center professionally. The unspoken synonym for “emeritus” 
is “old.” And old is a word we don’t even use anymore in 
polite conversation, a modern obscenity. . . .
I believe that many of our old ways of doing things are 
out of date, including some of our old ways of looking at, 
and reporting on, the world around us. Since the day he de-
livered his Inaugural Address, when I was 8 years old, people 
have been quoting the youthful John F. Kennedy saying that 
the torch had been passed to a new generation. But torches 
don’t really get passed very much because people love to 
hold on to them. . . .
If I had any lingering doubts about giving it up after almost 
nine years, they were quelled by those binders on my desk, 
full of exemplary work by reporters young enough to be my 
children. Flipping through their pages, reading such essen-
tial and beautifully rendered accounts of life in America and 
around the world, I felt certain of the future of the news busi-
ness in some form or another. But between the lines I read 
another message, delivered without rancor or contempt, the 
same one I once heard from my own son: It’s our turn. Step 
aside. And now I will.

CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. How are the developmental tasks of later adulthood re-
fl ected in this narrative?
 2. How is the psychosocial crisis of integrity versus despair 
refl ected in this case?
 3. How is the psychosocial crisis of generativity versus stag-
nation refl ected in Ms. Quindlen’s decision to retire?
 4. What challenges do you believe Anna Quindlen might face 
in retiring from Newsweek?
 5. How accurate is Ms. Quindlen’s analysis about the reluc-
tance of the baby boom generation to retire? What factors 
might account for the baby boom cohort’s approach to 
retirement?
Adjustment to retirement is expected to change with 
time. Atchley (2001) proposed phases of anticipation, transi-
tion, and eventual adaptation. Four markers in this process 
include: (1) a honeymoon period, which is busy and positive; 
(2) a disenchantment or letdown phase, in which the mean-
ing and structure of work are missed; (3) a reorientation 
phase, in which a more realistic lifestyle is created; and (4) 
a stable period, which may last 10 or 15 years until changes 
in health, fi nancial resources, or one’s social support system 
require a signifi cant revision.
In an attempt to assess this model, one study grouped 
retired men into six 6-month intervals from the date of 
retirement. In the period 13 to 18 months after retirement, 
men were signifi cantly more dissatisfi ed with life and had 
lower levels of physical activity than did those in the fi rst 6 
months after retirement. Later periods showed lower levels 
factors were especially troubling. First, people who had high 
levels of retirement anxiety worried about the loss of struc-
tured social involvement and connection. This concern was 
linked to worry about losing friendships, being lonely, and 
having little in common with former coworkers after retire-
ment. Second, people worried about having to be asser-
tive or proactive in fi nding new relationships and activities 
that would meet their needs. This concern was linked to a 
general diffi culty in handling life transitions, a high level of 
uncertainty about the future, and a general feeling of loss of 
identity. Although one might think that people who have 
high levels of retirement anxiety would use services that help 
people plan for retirement, this was not the case. They may 
try to deny this transition by avoiding planning and counsel-
ing sessions.
In addition to worries about being unable to meet social 
needs following retirement, some adults fi nd the transition 
difficult because they feel a lack of control. When people 
perceive that they are working or not working by their own 
choice and that they determine how much work to do, they 
have higher levels of health and well-being. However, when 
they perceive that their level of involvement in work is being 
decided by someone else and have little say in it, they are 
likely to have more diffi culty adjusting to retirement, more 
health problems, and a greater incidence of depression (Gall, 
Evans, & Howard, 1997; Schultz, Morton, & Weckerle, 
1998).
People whose work has brought them little satisfaction 
and those who are ready to become involved in new activi-
ties may feel more effective and independent after they retire 
(Floyd et al., 1992). They are likely to fi nd new sources of 
enjoyment, new opportunities to spend time with family and 
friends, a sense of relief at not having to deal with the stress-
ors of their job, and a new feeling of freedom to develop 
their interests or to exert more control over their daily life.

GENERATION OF WRITERS
Anna Quindlen, who has written “the last word” for News-
week for 9 years, explains why it’s time for her to move on.
The baby-boom generation has created an interesting co-
nundrum for this country. Born between 1946 and 1964, 
boomers take up more room than any other generation in 
American History. They now account for about a quarter of 
the population. And so, inevitably, they have created a kind 
of bottleneck, in the work world, in politics, in power. The 
frustration this poses for the young and talented should be 
obvious. In my personal life it was refl ected powerfully on the 
day when, talking of the unwillingness of my friends to retire, 
my eldest child noted, “You guys just won’t go.”. . .

CHAPTER 13 Later Adulthood (60 to 75 Years) 
and older had incomes below the poverty level. Poverty is 
greater for older minorities and older adults who live alone 
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2010).
The Future of Retirement
The ongoing dialogue among older workers, retirees, and 
industry is creating more varied, fl exible alternatives to full 
retirement. Certain social forces are infl uencing continuing 
involvement in the labor market after age 65. An increasing 
number of businesses are eliminating a mandatory retire-
ment age. In 2000, the earnings limit for receiving full social 
security benefi ts after age 65 was lifted. Finally, the age for 
full eligibility for social security retirement benefi ts will be 
rising to 67 for those born in 1960 or later. At the same time, 
movements toward reducing labor force participation for 
older workers include the development of early retirement 
plans, phased retirement, part-time work, and reduced or 
redefi ned job expectations. Innovation in retirement options 
seems to be taking two directions at the same time: how to 
retain older workers in meaningful work roles, and how 
to permit more fl exible earlier retirement programs (AARP, 
2000).
Several long-range concerns suggest a need to reexamine 
the right to retirement concept. First, prospects for a lon-
ger, healthier adulthood mean that a large proportion of the 
population will be out of the labor force for nearly one third 
of their adult lives if people continue to retire fully at age 
65. Between 2010 and 2030 the large baby boom genera-
tion will reach retirement age, placing new demands on the 
of satisfaction than the fi rst 6 months but not the marked 
depression of the 13- to 18-month period (Ekerdt, Bosse, 
& Levkoff, 1985). These findings support the idea of an 
early euphoric phase followed by a later letdown phase and 
reorientation. The pattern and degree of recovery are not as 
clearly described in this research.
Income Loss
Adjustment to retirement is especially difficult when it is 
associated with a dramatic reduction in income. There is 
about a 25% to 30% reduction in income after retirement, 
which is somewhat greater for those who retire before age 
65. Although work-related expenses, taxes, and child care 
expenses may decrease, health and recreational expenses 
may increase. In addition to reduced income, not all the 
sources of income are adjusted to keep pace with infl ation. 
Thus, the value of retirees’ fi xed income declines over time.
Older householders’ annual income is derived from fi ve 
primary sources: social security, property and other assets, 
pensions, earnings, and supplemental security income (see 
Figure 13.3, Fisher & Trenkamp for the Social Security 
Administration, 2010). Access to these various resources var-
ies by race and ethnicity, with older Whites having greater 
access to personal assets and pensions, and Asian Ameri-
cans and Hispanics drawing more on supplemental security 
income due to their poverty status. In 2007, the median 
income for households headed by someone 65 years old 
and older was $28,305. This can be compared to a median 
household income of $65,476 for a household headed by 
someone ages 45 to 54. About 10% of individuals 65 years

they would be working for fi nancial reasons, other motives 
were also important, including enjoyment in the work they 
were doing, a desire to have something interesting to do, and 
wanting to stay physically active and mentally stimulated 
(Brown, 2003).
Third, people who reenter the labor force during midlife 
or make major career changes then want to persist in these 
new activities in order to fulfi ll both personal and societal 
expectations of achievement. Many women who delayed 
their entry into the labor market or achieved a professional 
degree after their spouse had completed his degree want to 
extend their work life into their late sixties and seventies 
(Carp, 1997). The current cohort of workers who are now 
in their fi fties and sixties have become used to a more fl uctu-
ating work history, moving from one company or employer 
to another. They are more accustomed to taking charge of 
their occupational career rather than relying on the built-in 
career ladder of a single occupation or employer. Thus, just 
as the past few generations have begun to grow accustomed 
to retirement, new generations of older adults are fi nding 
ways to prolong their productive work lives, negotiating new 
and innovative ways of making transitions in and out of the 
paid labor force.
social security system and new expectations for services to 
support quality of life. With a reduced fertility rate, there 
may not be enough younger workers available to support 
this large nonworking population. Furthermore, it is becom-
ing increasingly diffi cult to earn and save enough during the 
40 or so years of employment to pay for 20 or more years of 
retirement.
Second, among older adults who are well educated and 
have enjoyed working, many want to continue some of their 
positive experiences through constructive work. They do not 
want to retire, and with the lifting of the mandatory retire-
ment age, they do not have to. It is not uncommon for men 
and women to take new jobs, perhaps with fewer or more 
flexible hours, after they retire from their primary work. 
Projections suggest that by the year 2012, 21% of men and 
12% of women over the age of 65 will be in the labor force. 
A great majority of these older workers remain in the labor 
market by choice. In a national telephone survey of people 
ages 50 to 70 sponsored by AARP, 70% of those who had not 
yet retired said that they expected to work after retirement 
or never retire. Almost half of those who had not yet retired 
said they expected to work into their seventies and beyond. 
Although many of those who were interviewed said that 
Chapter Summary
Variability in the patterns of adjustment during later adult-
hood results from the interaction among biological, psy-
chological, and societal factors, including personality 
characteristics, health, coping strategies, ego strengths, social 
support, and the range of life circumstances. Certain regular-
ities can be anticipated in the termination of old roles and the 
establishment of new ones. The tasks of later adulthood—
accepting one’s life, promoting intellectual vigor, redirecting 
energy to new roles and activities, and developing a point of 
view about death—require a balance among investments in 
past, present, and future.
Objective 1. To explore the construct of life satisfaction 
in later adulthood and the factors associated with 
subjective well-being.
There is an expectation that energy will be spent in the 
evaluative process of reviewing and accepting one’s past 
achievements. However, this focus on the past must be com-
plemented by the enactment of new roles, the resolution of 
new problems, and efforts to fi nd new, engaging challenges 
in the present. People who are extroverted, optimistic, expe-
rience a sense of usefulness, and feel they are in control of 
events in their life are also likely to experience high levels of 
satisfaction. Development in this period of life requires an 
ability to selectively direct resources to optimize functioning 
in the areas of life that are of primary value and satisfaction.
Objective 2. To describe factors that promote intellectual 
vigor, with a focus on memory, postformal operational 
thought, and crystallized and fl uid intelligence; and to 
consider the interaction of heredity and environment on 
intelligence in later life.
Genetic factors contribute to the stability of cognitive capaci-
ties over the life course, whereas the impact of the environ-
ment, including access to social support, engagement in 
challenging work and social relationships, health, and edu-
cation all contribute to variability in cognitive functioning. 
Certain abilities, especially general knowledge and verbal 
abilities, remain relatively unchanged with age, whereas 
speed of processing and numeric abilities tend to decline.
These patterns differ depending on overall intelligence of 
the person, the career focus and expertise of the individual.
Objective 3. To examine the process of redirecting 
energy to new roles and activities, with special focus on 
role gain, such as grandparenthood; role loss, such as 
widowhood; and new opportunities for leisure.
The nature of the grandparent role differs across cultures, 
and within cultures across families. No single type of grand-
parent-adult child-grandchild relationship is normative in 
the United States, but most are characterized by feelings of 
affection, and agreement about basic opinions and values.

failures. In this process, they fi nd a certain practical wisdom 
that is shared with others and becomes their legacy for the 
future.
Objective 6. To apply theory and research to under-
standing the process of adjustment to retirement in later 
adulthood.
The role transitions that accompany retirement illustrate 
the challenge of later adulthood. Retirement usually results 
in leaving a major life structure—one that provided social 
status, focus, purpose, and economic resources. The poten-
tial loss of daily stimulation poses threats to both cognitive 
and social functioning. Because so much of one’s social sta-
tus is linked to occupational attainment, leaving a work role 
is almost like giving up a social identity. Older adults face 
numerous adjustments after retirement, including role loss. 
They must restructure their lives so that they continue to feel 
pride in past achievements without dwelling on the past, and 
so that they seek new and realistic opportunities for mak-
ing use of their talents in the present. With the prospect of 
a long, healthy later adulthood, many in the current cohort 
of older adults expect to continue participation in the paid 
labor force even if they intend to change jobs or shift their 
occupational focus.
It is critical to be sensitive to the image that children, ado-
lescents, young and middle-aged adults, and older adults 
themselves have of later adulthood. One should not underes-
timate the impact that one’s perceptions of later life have on 
well-being and optimism at every earlier life stage. If the later 
years hold no promise, all earlier stages will be tainted with 
a sense of desperation. On the other hand, if the later years 
can be anticipated with optimism, people will be free at each 
earlier stage to experience life in a more confi dent, accepting 
manner.
Adaptation to widowhood also varies across individuals, and 
between men and women.
Men are more likely to remarry, women to live alone 
after the death of their spouse. The pattern of adjustment 
depends heavily on the quality of the relationship before 
the partner died, and the conditions surrounding the part-
ner’s death. Leisure time represents another domain in 
which there can be both role gain and role loss. Leisure 
activities can serve a wide range of physical, cognitive, and 
interpersonal goals. Through volunteerism, later adults 
also make substantial contributions to their communities.
Objective 4. To describe the development of a point of 
view about death.
In later adulthood, people’s thoughts about death tend to 
become more practical, focusing on the preparation of a will 
and planning for one’s burial. However, anxiety about death 
seems to diminish with age. A strong sense of generativ-
ity and integrity contribute to the ability to face death with 
less fear, while continuing to fi nd joy in the satisfactions of 
daily life.
Objective 5. To explain the psychosocial crisis of integrity 
versus despair, the central process of introspection, the 
prime adaptive ego quality of wisdom, and the core 
pathology of disdain.
The psychosocial crisis of integrity versus despair captures 
the courage and creative synthesis required in later adult-
hood. In the face of an increasingly evident mortality, experi-
ences in physical changes, role loss, and the death of peers, 
most older adults are able to defi ne and articulate the thread 
of meaning in their lives. They are able to look back with 
satisfaction at past achievements and with acceptance of past

CHAPTER 14 Elderhood (75 until Death)
PABLO PICASSO, WHOSE works illustrate this book, lived 
to be 91 years old. When he was 79, he married Jacqueline 
Roque, with whom he enjoyed 12 years of married life. Dur-
ing the last 20 years of his life, he remained productive and 
energetic, persistently experimenting with new art forms 
and ideas.
Here are some other examples of people who achieved 
major accomplishments after the age of 80 (Wallechinsky & 
Wallace, 1993; Wallechinsky, Wallace, & Wallace, 1977):
At 100, Grandma Moses was still painting.
At 99, twin sisters Kin Narita and Gin Kanie recorded 
a hit CD single in Japan and starred in a television 
commercial.
At 94, George Burns, who won an Oscar at age 80 
for his role in The Sunshine Boys, performed at Proctor’s 
Theater in Schenectady, New York, 63 years after he had 
fi rst played there.
At 93, George Bernard Shaw wrote the play Farfetched 
Fables.
At 91, Eamon de Valera served as president of Ireland.
At 91, Hulda Crooks climbed Mount Whitney, the 
highest mountain in the continental United States.
At 89, Arthur Rubenstein gave one of his greatest 
piano recitals in New York’s Carnegie Hall.
At 88, Konrad Adenauer was chancellor of Germany.
At 87, Mary Baker Eddy founded the Christian Science 
Monitor.
At 81, Benjamin Franklin provided leadership for the 
political compromises that led to the adoption of the 
U.S. Constitution. ■

Chapter Objectives
The Longevity Revolution
We are entering a period in which increasing numbers of peo-
ple are living into old age. As the previous examples illustrate, 
it’s not that we have no models of the long-lived in earlier 
periods of history, but that so many more adults are living into 
their eighties and nineties than ever before. In 2008, 6% of 
the U.S. population was 75 and older, and as the baby boom-
ers (those born between 1946 and 1964) mature this age 
group is expected to reach 11.6% of the population. In 1980, 
more than 2 million people were 85 and older; by 2008, this 
group had grown to 5.7 million. Of these, 92,000 were 100 
years and older. The 85-and-older population, which is the 
fastest-growing age group in the United States, is expected to 
reach 6.2 million in 2015 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010).
The 20th century was unique in human history in the 
large percentage of people who lived well beyond their 
reproductive and childrearing years into later adulthood and 
elderhood. This new facet of life raises questions about the 
pattern of mortality after achieving reproductive success and 
about what, if any, limit there might be to the human life 
span. Current projections suggest that in the United States 
the average life expectancy at birth will be 80 by the year 
2020 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Genetically based diseases 
that emerge only in the second half of life, such as breast and 
colon cancer or adult-onset diabetes, become more common 
as larger numbers of people reach advanced age. At the same 
time, the mapping of the human genome along with medi-
cal and technical innovations hold the promise of prevent-
ing some of the diseases now associated with later life. Life 
expectancy is most infl uenced by interventions that prevent 
infants and children from dying, ensuring that more people 
will reach advanced ages of 70 or older. Interventions that 
infl uence the life expectancy at ages 70 and older, however, 

 
The Longevity Revolution | 565
In an attempt to learn the secrets of longevity, Jim Heynen 
(1990) interviewed 100 people who were 100 years or older. 
He found wide variations in their lifestyles and philosophical 
perspectives. Some of the advice they offered on how to live 
a long life follows:
“Mind your own business, have a good cigar, and take a 
shot of brandy.” Brother Adelard Beaudet, Harrisville, Rhode 
Island
“I’ve lived long because I was so mean.” Pearl Rombach, 
Melbourne, Florida
“I always walked several miles a day. I’d talk to the fl owers.” 
Mary Frances Annand, Pasadena, California
“Don’t smoke before noon. Don’t drink or smoke after 
midnight. The body needs 12 hours of the day to clear 
itself.” Harry Wander, Boise, Idaho
“I’ve been a tofu eater all my life; a mild, gentle man, never 
a worrier.” Frank Morimitsu, Chicago, Illinois
“I picked my ancestors carefully.” Stella H. Harris, Manhattan, 
Kansas
“Regular hours, taking it easy, smiling, whistling at the 
women when they walk by.” John Hilton, Fort Lauderdale, 
Florida
A team of nutritionists, psychologists, physicians, and 
gerontologists interviewed 12 Cuban men and women who 
were reported to be more than 100 years old about their 
daily diets and lifestyles. The one theme they all agreed 
upon was the importance of an optimistic outlook on life. 
The coordinator of the meeting, Dr. Eugenio Selman, said 
that the six basic elements to longevity are (1) motivation to 
live, (2) appropriate diet, (3) medical attention, (4) intense 
physical activity, (5) cultural activities, and (6) a healthy 
environment. In this analysis, one sees the interaction of 
the biological, psychological, and societal systems (CNN
.com, 2005). Surprisingly absent from this list is the role of 
social integration and social support. A growing literature 
highlights the contribution of a sense of belonging to overall 
health and resilience in the face of crisis (Gow et al., 2007).
The Gender Gap Among the Very Old
A discussion of aging in the United States must acknowledge 
the shifting sex composition of the population at older ages. 
In 2008, 54% of those between 65 and 74 were women, 61% 
of those 75 and older were women, and 67% of those 85 and 
over were women (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). This gender 
gap in longevity is observed in virtually all countries of the 
world, but the differences are accentuated in the developed 
countries (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000). The imbalance 
in the sex composition is much more noticeable today than 
it was 50 years ago, when there were about as many men 
as women in the older-than-65 category (U.S. Bureau of the 
Census, 1983). Because those currently at the stage of very 
old age are predominantly women, many of the social issues 
of aging—especially poverty, health care, the future of social 
security, and housing—are also viewed as women’s issues.
will increase overall life expectancy by only a few years. 
Nonetheless, signifi cant discoveries that might prevent death 
from cancers or cardiovascular diseases could affect large 
populations and continue to extend human longevity.
From an evolutionary perspective, the human species is 
a highly complex organism, designed to survive over a rela-
tively long period in order to fi nd a mate, reproduce, and 
rear and nurture the young until they are old enough to 
reproduce. The adaptive value of life after this sequence is 
not well understood. One hypothesis is that the extended 
family—composed of grandparents as well as parents—
provides more resources for the support of the young, and 
forms an added protective layer against crises that might 
leave the younger generation vulnerable. It is clear that 
there is a genetic basis to longevity, suggesting that for some 
subgroups being long-lived has proven adaptive (Olshansky, 
Carnes, & Grahn, 1998).
Each new cohort of the very old will benefi t from the infor-
mation and technology that have been developed. The more 
knowledge is gained about the biological processes of aging 
and the genetic basis of diseases that emerge in later life, the 
more likely it is that human longevity can be extended.
Those adults in the current baby boom generation (born 
between 1946 and 1964) are quite likely to be high school 
graduates, to have benefi ted from many of the health-related 
innovations of the late 20th century, and to be even more 
vigorous than our current older population. The projections 
of increased numbers of people reaching advanced age are 
due to increases in longevity due to improvements in health 
care and fi tness and to the size of the baby boom cohort.

CHAPTER 14 Elderhood (75 until Death)
social integration, social support, and access to appropriate 
services are linked to higher levels of functioning in relation 
to one’s potential and to greater resilience in the face of illness.
The variations in life experiences and outlook among the 
very old are great. As a result, chronological age becomes less 
useful as an indicator of aging. Neugarten (1981) offered a dis-
tinction that helps clarify the functional differences among the 
very old. She described two groups: the old-old and the young-
old. The old-old have “suffered major physical or mental dec-
rements,” which increase their dependence on health and 
social services. This group will grow as the number of adults 
over 75 increases. Currently, it forms a minority of the very old. 
The majority of people over 75 can be described as young-old. 
They are competent, vigorous, and relatively healthy. They live 
in their own households and participate in activities in their 
communities. For example, among the New England centenar-
ians studied, 90% were functionally independent and relatively 
healthy up until age 92 (Perls & Terry, 2007).
Our intention is to discuss some of the most salient char-
acteristics of life after age 75 and to articulate what appears 
to be a psychosocial crisis specifi c to this period. We report 
evidence of common challenges and successful strategies for 
coping amid the great diversity of individual experiences.
A New Psychosocial Stage: 
Elderhood
Objective 1. To identify elderhood as a unique develop-
mental period for those of unusual longevity—a stage 
with its own developmental tasks and psychosocial crisis.
The fact that an increasing number of people are reaching 
advanced years and that they share certain personal and 
behavioral characteristics leads us to hypothesize a new stage 
of psychosocial development that emerges at the upper end 
of the life span, after one has exceeded the life expectancy 
for one’s birth cohort. This is the stage of life that is experi-
enced by the long-lived in a community who have outlived 
most of their age-mates. Drawing on the concept of village 
elders who share their wisdom and help resolve community 
disputes, we call this stage elderhood. Although it was not 
specifically identified in Erikson’s original formulation of 
life stages, in the book Vital Involvement in Old Age (Erikson 
et al., 1986), Erikson began to characterize the dynamics of 
psychosocial adaptation in this period of life. Throughout 
this chapter, we have drawn on Erikson’s insights to enrich 
our appreciation of the courage, vitality, and transformations 
that accompany elderhood.
We have formulated a psychosocial analysis of develop-
ment in elderhood based on research literature, firsthand 
reports, and personal observations to describe the devel-
opmental tasks, psychosocial crisis, central process, prime 
adaptive ego quality, and core pathology of this stage. We 
approach this formulation of a new stage realizing that in 
many domains—especially physical functioning, reaction 
time, memories, and cognitive abilities—variability increases 
signifi cantly with age. With advanced age, a person is less 
constrained by pressures of institutionalized roles and social 
demands. As a result, personal preferences and genetically 
based sources of individuality are freer to be expressed. In 
addition, individual differences refl ect the diversity of edu-
cational experiences, health or illness, exposure to harsh 
conditions, and patterns of work and family life.
The concept of norm of reaction introduced in Chapter 4 
(The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal Development) offers 
a framework for understanding the enormous variability in 
vitality and functioning during elderhood. The quality of func-
tioning in elderhood is a product of the interaction between 
genetic factors and environmental supports. Genetic factors 
infl uence longevity, vulnerability to illnesses, intelligence, and 
personality factors that contribute to coping (Pollack, 2001). 
Support for a genetic basis to longevity is provided from 
observations from the New England Centenarian Study that 
found that half the centenarians had grandparents, siblings, 
and other close relatives who also reached very advanced ages 
(Perls, Kunkel, & Puca, 2002). Environmental conditions 
including poverty, discrimination, social alienation, and lack of 
social support are associated with lower levels of functioning 
in relation to one’s potential. In contrast, adequate fi nances, 
Morris Dees is a co-founder and chief trial lawyer of the Southern 
Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a nonprofi t civil rights organization 
dedicated to fi ghting hate and bigotry. Dees has represented 
SPLC in a number of high-profi le cases against extremist groups, 
propelling the organization into the national spotlight. These 
included lawsuits against the Ku Klux Klan, the United Klans of 
America, and the White Aryan Resistance. Dees continues to be 
active raising money for SPLC, and taking on controversial cases 
on behalf of victims of bigotry and discrimination.

and variable across individuals. Some people who have 
observed a healthy lifestyle in early and middle adulthood 
still experience diseases whereas others who have led a more 
risky lifestyle do not experience these diseases. We do not 
fully understand the extent to which genetic, environmental, 
social, and lifestyle factors help support continued health or 
vulnerability to disease in elderhood.
The theme of the physical changes of aging can be 
approached much like its counterpart in early adolescence. 
Although the rate of change may be slower, older adults 
notice changes in a wide range of areas, including appear-
ance, body shape, strength and stamina, and the accumula-
tion of chronic illnesses. Just as in adolescence, the rate and 
sequence of changes vary from person to person. This section 
will identify major areas of physical change. The patterns 
of change described here are average trends. Not all adults 
experience all of these changes, nor to the same degree. The 
important issues are the meaning that adults attribute to 
their physical condition and the coping strategies they invent 
to adapt to these changes.
Most of us know older adults who are vigorous and zest-
ful. On the other hand, we also know older adults who are 
painfully limited in their ability to function because of physi-
cal disabilities. Many factors influence the progression of 
physical changes associated with aging, not the least of which 
is the level of fitness that was established and maintained 
during early and middle adulthood. The topics of fitness, 
sleep and rest, behavioral slowing, sensory changes, health, 
illness, and functional independence combine to provide a 
picture of the physical changes of aging.
Fitness
There is a great deal of variation in fi tness among people 
after age 75 as patterns of activity or inactivity, endurance or 
frailty, and illness or health take their toll. What is described 
here might be thought of as the usual patterns of aging. How-
ever, these changes are not inevitable and, in many instances, 
are reversible or modifi able with appropriate intervention 
(Dobek, White, & Gunter, 2007).
What are the elements of physical fi tness that are typi-
cally assessed in older populations? Seven components 
are often included in measures intended to assess fitness 
among the elderly: coordination, reaction time, balance, 
muscle strength, muscle endurance, fl exibility, and cardio-
respiratory endurance (Hilgenkamp, van Wijck, & Even-
huis, 2010). Among those 75 and older, elders who exhibit 
high levels of fi tness are also likely to report a better overall 
quality of life, higher cognitive functioning, lower levels of 
depression, and a lower likelihood of encountering physi-
cal disabilities as they age (Tainaka, Takizawa, Katamoto, & 
Aoki, 2009; Takata et al., 2010; Voelker-Rehage, Godde, & 
Staudinger, 2010).
Most people begin to notice declines in their physical 
health and fi tness in their late twenties and early thirties. As 
those who love baseball are likely to claim, “The legs are the 
fi rst to go.” On a more positive note, most people’s strength 
Developmental Tasks
Despite the wide variability in capacities, lifestyles, and 
worldviews in later life, three themes characterize the chal-
lenges that face individuals in elderhood. First, they must 
adapt to physical changes, monitoring their health and modi-
fying their lifestyles to accommodate these changes. Second, 
they must conceptualize their lives within a new time frame, 
realigning their thoughts about past, present, and future in 
order to stay connected to the present in a meaningful way. 
Third, they must develop new life structures—especially 
living arrangements and social relationships—that provide 
comfort, interest, and appropriate levels of care.
Coping with the Physical Changes 
of Aging
Objective 2. To describe some of the physical changes 
associated with aging, including changes in fi tness, 
behavioral slowing, sensory changes, and vulnerability to 
illness, and the challenges that these changes pose for 
continued psychosocial well-being.
There is no way to avoid the realization that with advanced 
age one’s body is not what it used to be. Erikson described it 
as follows:
With aging, as the overall tonus of the body begins to sag 
and innumerable inner parts call attention to themselves 
through their malfunction, the aging body is forced into a 
new sense of invalidness. Some problems may be fairly petty, 
like the almost inevitable appearance of wrinkles. Others are 
painful, debilitating, and shaming. Whatever the severity of 
these ailments, the elder is obliged to turn attention from 
more interesting aspects of life to the demanding require-
ments of the body. This can be frustrating and depressing. 
(Erikson et al., 1986, p. 309)
Aging, which is a continuous process over the life span, 
includes both development and decline. In later life, some 
physical changes are considered to be normal or expected, 
and not especially related to disease. People who are well 
educated, have access to health care and other resources, and 
have observed healthy lifestyle practices in earlier stages of life 
are still going to experience some of the normative changes of 
aging when they reach advanced age, such as some loss of 
muscle strength or diffi culty returning to normal respiration 
after periods of exertion. However, certain lifestyle practices 
including smoking cigarettes, alcohol and drug abuse, poor 
diet, and a sedentary life are likely to accelerate these patterns 
of normal decline. Other changes are disease related and 
not a result of normal aging. Some genetic factors appear to 
increase vulnerability to these diseases, but so do lifestyle fac-
tors, exposure to toxins, and stress. Thus, we want to empha-
size that the physical changes of aging are multidimensional 

568 | 
CHAPTER 14 Elderhood (75 until Death)
With advancing age, some people tend to become more 
sedentary and lose interest in physical activity. In order to 
maintain optimal functioning and to retard the degenerative 
effects of aging, very old adults must continue to have fre-
quent and regular opportunities for physical exercise. A regu-
lar program of walking or other aerobic exercise can enhance 
cardiovascular functioning and reverse some of the effects of 
a sedentary adult lifestyle. Research on weight, or resistance, 
training shows that even among the very old, a steady pro-
gram of exercise builds muscle strength, which contributes 
to agility and an overall sense of well-being (Ades, Ballor, 
Ashikaga, Utton, & Nair, 1996). Weight-bearing exercises 
help offset the normal processes of loss of muscle tone and 
bone density, improving balance and reducing the likelihood 
of falls. Experimental studies of the effects of exercise on cog-
nitive functioning show that it also leads to improvements 
in various central nervous system functions. These benefi ts 
of exercise are attributed in part to higher levels of oxygen, 
which improve the metabolism of glucose and neurotrans-
mitters in the brain, as well as to increased levels of arousal, 
which increase response speed (Newell, Vaillancourt, & 
Sosnoff, 2006).
Sleep and Rest
Older adults seem to need about the same amount of sleep, 7 
to 9 hours a night, as younger adults. However, older adults 
tend to go to sleep earlier and wake up earlier than when 
they were younger, and spend less time in deep sleep, which 
may be why older adults often report being light sleepers 
(National Institute on Aging, 2009c). More signifi cant sleep 
problems occur for older adults who have various medical 
conditions that involve pain, sleep apnea, movement dis-
orders, and urinary problems (Ohayon, Carskadon, Guil-
leminault, & Vitiello, 2004).
The most common sleep problem in elderhood is insom-
nia, which involves difficulties falling asleep or staying 
asleep. Insomnia may be a temporary problem associated 
with particular worries, excitement over an upcoming event, 
or preoccupation with an unresolved challenge. On the other 
hand, insomnia may be a symptom of other medical condi-
tions, such as unmanaged pain, or diffi culty breathing. An 
interesting problem is that people who have had a bout of 
insomnia may exacerbate their problem by worrying about 
whether they will be able to fall asleep (National Institute on 
Aging, 2009c).
Many older adults take daytime naps; an estimated 15% 
of those ages 55–64 and 25% of those ages 75–84 nap. There 
may be benefi ts from the practice of napping. In a study that 
tracked over 23,000 Greek adults for 6 years, those who 
napped 3 times a week or more for about half an hour had a 
substantially lower risk of heart attacks than those who did 
not nap (Naska et al., 2007). Napping may help reduce stress 
and allow a person to engage the remainder of the day with 
more energy. In a study of napping among older adults, those 
who had a regular habit of sleeping at about the same time 
each day and waking themselves up after about half an hour 
and capacity for moderate effort are about the same at age 70 
as they were at age 40 (Stevens-Long & Commons, 1992). 
However, older people are less resilient after a period of pro-
longed exertion. The respiratory and circulatory systems 
usually degenerate to some extent and are less capable of pro-
viding the heart and muscle tissue with oxygenated blood as 
quickly as they once could. One result is that sudden changes 
in posture can cause an older person to feel lightheaded. In 
order to adapt successfully to this kind of bodily change, 
an older person may fi nd it necessary to move more slowly 
and to change positions more deliberately. This observ-
able change in the tempo of movement may be incorrectly 
interpreted as fatigue or weakness when, in fact, it is often a 
purposeful strategy for preventing dizziness.
Slowed metabolism reduces the need for calories, but 
there are new risks. Blood sugar levels are likely to rise after 
eating, and body fat increases. These conditions increase the 
risk of type 2 diabetes. Reduction in food intake—particu-
larly the elimination of foods such as milk—may result in 
the lack of essential vitamins and minerals in an older per-
son’s diet. The resulting malnutrition may then contribute 
to osteoporosis and iron defi ciencies, which produce feel-
ings of weakness, fatigue, and a lack of resilience (Klesges 
et al., 2001). Many health concerns of later adulthood that 
may have been attributed to the aging process itself are in 
fact a direct or indirect result of malnutrition. In order to 
cope successfully with a diminished appetite, a very old per-
son must become more conscientious in selecting foods that 
will provide the nutritional elements necessary for healthy 
functioning.
An increasing number of factors make it diffi cult to main-
tain a high level of physical fi tness in later life. Some aspects 
of aging that impact fi tness are a result of the body’s natu-
ral process as cells replicate again and again and, through 
metabolism, produce by-products that can be harmful to 
the body itself. Some aspects of aging that reduce fi tness 
are a result of choices and circumstances such as a seden-
tary lifestyle, smoking, a diet heavy in fats, too much time 
in the sun, exposure to environmental toxins, and lack of 
health care.
Commitment to physical fi tness is important for adults in 
order to face their later years in the best possible physical 
condition. In its report Healthy People 2010, the U.S. govern-
ment placed inadequate physical activity at the top of the list 
of health concerns (U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, 2001). A primary goal is to promote regular, daily 
physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day. Regular 
physical activity is associated with decreased rates of death 
from heart disease, lower risk of diabetes and colon cancer, 
and prevention of high blood pressure. Physical activity also 
improves muscle and bone strength, contributes to weight 
control, and improves strength, flexibility, and balance. 
Despite these advantages, 55% of those ages 75 and older do 
not engage in any leisure time physical activity, and 87% say 
that they never engage in vigorous physical activity (National 
Center for Health Statistics, 2010).

time-consuming, approach in order to solve the problem 
correctly. Thus, a conservative orientation to the selection of 
problem-solving strategies may result in slower responses but 
not be strictly due to neurological causes (Touron & Hertzog, 
2004). Depending upon the task, cautiousness may be related 
to prior experiences of instability or falling. As older adults 
step down from the sidewalk to the street, or step off an ele-
vator or onto an escalator, they move more slowly to ensure 
that they have good footing and will not slip or fall. Finally, 
response slowing may be a product of a low level of motiva-
tion to perform a task. In experiments in which reaction time 
is being tested, adult participants may be uninterested in the 
task and thus unwilling to try to respond quickly.
The implications of the consequences of behavioral slow-
ing are currently being examined. Some researchers have 
argued that even the slightest reduction in the speed of neu-
ral firing may result in reduced sensory and information-
processing capacities. Furthermore, response slowing may 
reduce a person’s chances of survival if a situation arises in 
which a sudden evasive action or immediate response is 
required. Others have suggested that if a moment of thought 
is required before an action is taken, slowness may increase a 
person’s chances of survival.
had a greater sense of self-effi cacy and less experience of slug-
gishness in the afternoon and evening (Kaida et al., 2006).
The relationship of napping to well-being is not fully 
understood. People who are able to nap during the day may 
also be in greater control of their lives and less exposed to 
stress. On the other hand, taking a nap may be a deliberate 
way to reduce stress, relax, and prepare to engage more fully 
in the remaining hours of the day. Not surprising, napping 
several times a day is associated with unusual feelings of sleep-
iness during the day, depression, and pain (Foley et al., 2007).
Behavioral Slowing
One of the most commonly noted markers of aging is a 
gradual slowing in response to stimuli. Behavioral slowing 
is observed in motor responses, reaction time, problem-
solving abilities, memory skills, and information processing 
(Salthouse, 1996). Reaction time is a composite outcome 
of the time it takes to perceive a stimulus, retrieve related 
information from memory, integrate it with other relevant 
stored information, reason as necessary about the required 
action, and then take action—whether that means the time it 
takes to press a button after detecting a signal, or the time it 
takes to complete a crossword puzzle or solve a math prob-
lem. Age-related slowing is more readily observable in com-
plex tasks requiring mental processing than in routine tasks 
(Lemaire, Arnaud, & Lecacheur, 2004). The more complex 
the task, the greater the processing load—that is, the more 
domains of information are called into play and the more 
time it takes to select response strategies.
The number of tasks presented in a sequence and the 
complexity or choice required to make a response are all fac-
tors that infl uence response time. Under conditions where 
a choice of response is required, older adults do not show 
evidence of slowing in the early phase of processing the 
stimuli but in the executive functions associated with enact-
ing the appropriate response (Yordanova, Kolev, Hohnsbein, 
& Falkenstein, 2004). In many studies, older adults show 
improvements in response time when given opportunity 
for practice. However, when older and younger adults are 
both given opportunities for practice, the older adults do not 
improve as much as the younger, and the performance gap 
may actually increase (Hein & Schubert, 2004).
Biological, learned, and motivational factors have been 
identifi ed to account for behavioral slowing. At the biological 
level, there is evidence of the slowing of neural fi ring in certain 
brain areas, which may result in a slower speed of information 
processing. The extent of this slowing depends on the kinds 
of tasks and specifi c cognitive processes involved. Speed of 
processing may be only one of many factors responsible for 
age-related changes in cognitive processing (Hartley, 2006).
The slowing of responses may also be a product of learned 
cautiousness. With experience, people learn to respond 
slowly in order to avoid making mistakes. When confronted 
with new, experimental problem-solving tasks, older adults 
may take longer because they are not confident in using 
a new strategy. They may revert to a more familiar, if more 
As a result of behavioral slowing, it takes longer for elders to 
perform daily tasks. Her trips to the market take May more time 
than they did 10 years ago, but she still enjoys her shopping and

walk through an airport quickly to get to her gate, but may 
be slow in reading and evaluating the information that tells 
whether her fl ight is on time or delayed. Another 80-year-old 
woman may be able to read the information about the fl ight 
and quickly assess whether her fl ight is on time, but may 
take much longer to get to the departure gate.
Because slowing occurs gradually, most adults compen-
sate for it by making their environments more convenient or 
by changing their lifestyles. However, slowing becomes more 
hazardous in situations that require the older adult to keep 
pace with a tempo that cannot be modifi ed, such as highway 
driving or crossing the street with the light. For instance, 
some older people encounter problems because the amount 
of time the light stays green at a pedestrian crosswalk is insuf-
fi cient to permit them to get to the other side of the street 
safely. As older people recognize some situations in which 
they have trouble responding quickly, they must review 
the tempo of their day. Very old people may become more 
selective in their choice of activities so that they can allocate 
enough time for the tasks most important to them and per-
form them satisfactorily. This means exercising greater con-
trol over their time and being less concerned about whether 
they are in harmony with the tempo of others.
Sensory Changes
Every sense modality—vision, hearing, taste, touch, and 
smell—is vulnerable to age-related changes. With age, 
greater intensity of stimulation is required to make the same 
impact on the sensory system that was once achieved with 
lower levels of stimulation. Some of the changes in vision, 
hearing, and taste and smell are given in Table 14.1. These 
changes begin in early adulthood, and their effects increase 
throughout the remainder of life (Erber, 2005).
Vision. Visual adaptation involves the ability to adjust 
to changes in the level of illumination. Pupil size decreases 
with age, so that less light reaches the retina. Thus, older 
adults need higher levels of illumination to see clearly, and 
A common consequence of slowing is its impact on 
cognitive functioning. If the nervous system functions at a 
slower rate, it takes more time to scan and perceive informa-
tion, search long-term memory, integrate information from 
various knowledge domains, and make a response (Mad-
den, 2001). With increased input each year, it is possible 
that the time needed for processing information increases. 
In the face of complex cognitive tasks, information may be 
lost, or distractions may intervene if the process takes too 
long (Birren & Fisher, 1992). For example, Hertzog (1989) 
examined the relationship of age and speed of performance 
in a variety of mental abilities among people ranging in age 
from 43 to 89. He found that the speed of performance mea-
sure was a better predictor of mental abilities than was age. 
Other research looked at crystallized and fl uid intelligence. 
Recall from Chapter 13 (Later Adulthood) that crystallized 
intelligence tends to increase with age, whereas fl uid intel-
ligence declines. When the factor of speed of responding was 
removed from the tests of fl uid intelligence, the decline with 
age was signifi cantly less. These studies support the claim 
that changes in the speed of responding account for much—
though probably not all—of the documented evidence of 
decline in intellectual performance with age.
The debate continues, however, about whether this slow-
ing is general—infl uencing all types of cognitive and motor 
activity—or specifi c to certain domains. There is consider-
able evidence that contemporary circumstances—especially 
physical fi tness and health, as well as the kinds of medica-
tions one is taking and the presence of immediate stressors 
in one’s life—influence the speed of responding. In each 
situation, motor performance results from the adaptive self-
organization of responses that are a product of how the per-
son assesses the situation; the person’s physical strength, 
fl exibility, and endurance; and the person’s ability to control 
posture, movement, and dexterity. Speed of responding will 
vary depending on what type of response is required and 
which systems constrain behavior (Newell, Vaillancourt, & 
Sosnoff, 2006). One 80-year-old woman may be able to

Developmental Tasks | 571
Loss of hearing interferes with a basic mode of human 
connectedness—the ability to participate in conversation. 
Hearing impairment may be linked to feelings of isolation or 
suspiciousness. A person may hear things imperfectly, miss 
parts of conversations, or perceive conversations as occur-
ring in whispers rather than in ordinary tones. There are 
a variety of devices that can help support individuals who 
have hearing loss. These include hearing aids, amplifying 
devices that can make it easier to hear on the phone, alert 
systems coordinated with doorbells or smoke detectors, and 
cochlear implants that are surgically implanted to help over-
come certain specifi c types of hearing loss (National Institute 
on Aging, 2009b).
Being aware of one’s hearing loss and its impact on social 
interactions is the first step in learning to compensate for 
diminished auditory sensitivity. Knowing the people one is 
with and believing that one is valued by them can help reas-
sure a person about the nature of conversations and allay sus-
picions. Elders with hearing loss may ask for a quiet spot in a 
restaurant, or ask friends to speak one at a time in a group set-
ting. Self-esteem plays an important part in this process. The 
older person with high self-esteem is likely to be able to make 
the intellectual adjustment needed to interpret interactions 
and to request clarifi cation when necessary. Such requests may 
even serve to stimulate greater interaction and produce greater 
clarity in communication. Older people with a hearing loss 
and high self-esteem tend to insist that people who want to 
communicate with them should face them when they speak.
In contrast, older people who have low self-esteem are 
likely to be more vulnerable to suspicions about the behavior 
of others because they doubt their own worth. They are more 
likely to perceive inaudible comments as attempts to ridicule 
or exclude them. These experiences contribute to feelings of 
rejection and can produce irritability and social withdrawal.
About 20% of those ages 75 and older have multiple sen-
sory impairments. Those who have both visual and hearing 
impairments are more likely to report reduced social interac-
tions, diffi culty getting together with friends, and are at greater 
risk for falls, possibly due to the lack of sensory cues that help 
support navigation in unfamiliar settings (He et al., 2005).
Taste and Smell. There are taste receptors throughout the 
mouth, including on your tongue, the roof of your mouth, 
and your throat. These taste receptors detect fl avors of food 
based on fi ve tastes: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and tangy. In 
addition, the smell of food contributes to its flavor, and 
many would argue that the appearance of food contributes 
to its appeal. With age, the number of taste buds decreases. 
Older adults have a higher threshold than young adults for 
detecting sweet, sour, bitter, and salty tastes. Some of this 
reduced sensitivity may be related to the impact of certain 
medications, gum disease, dentures, some infections, cancer 
treatments, or alcohol consumption (National Institute on 
Aging, 2009d). In order to improve the taste of food, older 
adults may add salt or sugar, which may aggravate existing 
conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes.
it takes them longer to adjust from dark to light and from 
light to dark. Many older adults are increasingly sensitive 
to glare and may draw the shades in their rooms to prevent 
bright light from striking their eyes. Slower adaptation time 
and sensitivity to glare interfere with night driving. Some of 
the visual problems of people older than 75 are diffi culties 
with tasks that require speed of visual performance, such as 
reading signs in a moving vehicle; a decline in near vision, 
which interferes with reading and daily tasks; and diffi cul-
ties in searching for or tracking visual information (National 
Institute on Aging, 2009a). About 16.5% of those 75 and 
older report that they have trouble seeing (National Center 
for Health Statistics, 2010).
Several physiological conditions seriously impair vision 
and can result in partial or total blindness in old age. These 
conditions include cataracts, which are a clouding of the 
lenses, making them less penetrable by light; deterioration 
or detachment of the retina; corneal disease, which can 
result in redness, watery eyes, pain, and diffi culties seeing; 
and glaucoma, which is an increase in pressure from the 
fl uid in the eyeball. The incidence of visual impairments, 
especially cataracts, increases dramatically from later adult-
hood (65 to 74) to elderhood (beyond 75) (He, Sengupta, 
Velkoff, & Barros, 2005).
About 18% to 20% of elders experience problems with 
cataracts. According to vision experts, recent medical inno-
vations have made cataract surgery much less complicated 
than it was in the past. Nine out of 10 people who have cat-
aract surgery regain very good vision, somewhere between 
20/40 and 20/20 (Lee, 2002). Problems with glaucoma can 
be treated with eyedrops, lasers, or surgery. Retinal disor-
ders, especially age-related macular degeneration, can be 
prevented or treated with dietary supplements.
Loss of vision poses serious challenges to adaptation—
it has the effect of separating people from contact with the 
world. Such impairment is especially linked with feelings of 
helplessness. Most older adults are not ready to cope with the 
challenge of learning to function in their daily world without 
being able to see. For them, the loss of vision reduces their 
activity level, autonomy, and willingness to leave a familiar 
setting. For many older adults, impaired vision results in the 
decision to give up driving altogether, or at least night driv-
ing, causing a significant loss of independence. However, 
this loss can be minimized by the availability of inexpensive, 
fl exible public transportation.
Hearing. Hearing loss increases with age. About 45% of 
those ages 75 and older have some trouble with their hearing 
(National Center for Health Statistics, 2010). The most com-
mon effects of hearing loss are a reduced sensitivity to both 
high-frequency (high-pitched) and low-intensity (quiet) 
sounds and a somewhat decreased ability to understand 
spoken messages. Certain environmental factors—including 
exposure to loud, unpredictable noise, and injuries, such as 
damage to the bones in the middle ear—infl uence the extent 
of hearing loss.

expect yourself to do everything, the way you used to. Some 
things you just have to let go.” However, inappropriate restric-
tion can be, in its way, insulting and belittling. In describing 
his current life, one widowed man expresses both his refusal 
to accept restriction and his willingness to rely on appropriate 
assistance: “I can stay up here in the woods because I know if 
I really need help, my son will be here inside of three hours. 
Now, this deal with fi xing my own water pipes, I’d have never 
tried that without my son so nearby, and I didn’t even need 
him.” (Erikson et al., 1986, pp. 309–310)
Health, Illness, and Functional Independence
How can we characterize the level of health, illness, and 
functional independence in later life? A mild but persistent 
decline in the immune system is observed as a correlate of 
aging. As a result, older adults are more susceptible to infections 
and take a longer time to heal. Substantial numbers of older 
adults are affl icted with one or more chronic conditions, such as 
arthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes, or high blood pressure, which 
may require medication and interfere with daily functioning.
Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis for 
older adults. This type of arthritis results when the cartilage 
that pads bones in a joint wears away. The joints may feel stiff 
when a person has not moved for a while. Other symptoms 
include temporary or chronic pain, and gradual loss of mobil-
ity in the affected joints. Osteoporosis is a disease that weak-
ens bones so that they break easily. Bone tissue is continuously 
broken down and replaced. With age, more bone is lost than 
is replaced. Although women are at greater risk of osteoporo-
sis than men, after age 70 men and women lose bone at about 
the same rate (National Institute on Aging, 2009e, 2009f).
Data from the National Health Interview Survey (National 
Center for Health Statistics, 2010) provide a look at the 
relationship of age to difficulties in physical functioning. 
Older adults also require greater intensity to detect odors 
and are more likely to misidentify them (Receputo, Mazzo-
leni, Rapisarda, & Di Fazio, 1996). The sense of smell can 
keep a person safe. Smells related to smoke, gas leaks, 
spoiled food, or household chemicals are important indi-
cations of a possible environmental problem. Loss of smell 
in older adults can increase their vulnerability to illness or 
accidents if they ignore these cues. Changes in the senses of 
smell and taste may result in a loss of appetite or a disruption 
of normal eating habits. Loss of appetite (which may accom-
pany illness and new medications), pain due to dental prob-
lems, and changes in the digestive system all contribute to 
malnutrition among the elderly.
Coping with Sensory Changes. As a result of the vari-
ous patterns of aging among the very old, it is impossible 
to prescribe an ideal pattern of coping. The SOC model, 
which was introduced in Chapter 13 (Later Adulthood), 
becomes increasingly relevant as sensory and motor func-
tions are impaired. According to this model, in order to cope 
effectively, older adults must select the areas where they are 
most invested in sustaining optimal functioning and direct 
their resources to enhancing those areas, while compensat-
ing for the areas in which functioning is more limited. What 
one hopes to achieve is a balance between self-suffi ciency 
and willingness to accept help, preserving one’s dignity as 
much as possible and optimizing day-to-day mobility. This 
is described in the following excerpt from Erikson’s study of 
the very old:
Appropriate dependence can be accommodated and accepted 
by elders when they realistically appraise their own physi-
cal capacities. One of our more practical elders simply states, 
“Of course, you’re still interested in everything. But you don’t

dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed or a chair, walk-
ing, and using the toilet. The area of greatest limitation is 
walking, The percentage of adults needing assistance is 
small for those ages 65 to 74, increases slightly for those 
Participants were asked about whether they had certain 
upper-body and lower-body limitations. Upper-body limita-
tions included such things as reaching up over one’s head or 
using one’s fi ngers to grasp a handle. Lower-body limitations 
included walking for a quarter mile or stooping, crouching, 
or kneeling. The percentage of respondents who reported dif-
fi culty in one or more areas increased from 28% of those ages 
65 to 74, to 48% among those 75 and older. The area of most 
diffi culty was standing for 2 hours, with 33% of those over 
age 75 reporting diffi culties. This suggests that many elders 
would not go to an outdoor concert without bringing a chair.
One of the most diffi cult health challenges of elderhood is 
a group of disorders referred to as organic brain syndromes. 
These conditions, which result in confusion, disorientation, 
and loss of control over basic daily functions, present obsta-
cles for adaptation to the person with the disease as well 
as the caregivers who are responsible for the older person’s 
well-being (see the box on dementia).
Do people generally experience a rapid, general decline in 
health after age 65 or 70? Not according to self-ratings. In a 
national survey of older adults, people were asked to rate their 
health from poor to excellent. In the 75 to 84 age range, 71% of 
non-Hispanic Whites, 54% of non-Hispanic Blacks, and 50% 
of Hispanics rated their health as good, very good, or excellent. 
Among those 85 and older, the percentage who rated their 
health as good, very good, or excellent declined somewhat for 
the three groups, to 67%, 52%, and 53%, respectively (Federal 
Interagency Forum on Aging Related Statistics, 2004).
Among those in their eighties and early nineties, one 
health-related crisis may result in a marked decline in other 
areas. For example, the loss of a spouse may result in social 
withdrawal, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, loss of energy, 
unwillingness to take medication, and decline in physical 
activity. All of these changes can produce a rapid deteriora-
tion of the respiratory, circulatory, and metabolic systems.
Studies of people in their later nineties and older fi nd that 
these elders demonstrate unexpectedly good health. They 
appear to be more disease free than those who are 10 or 15 
years younger. Perls (2004) suggested that a combination 
of genetic factors protect some people from the diseases of 
aging through two complementary processes. First, they are 
less vulnerable to some of the damaging effects of oxygen rad-
icals that destroy DNA and cells. Thus, during their seven-
ties and eighties, they do not suffer from the major diseases 
such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, or Alzheimer’s disease. 
Second, they have a greater functional reserve, meaning that 
they require less of their organs to perform basic adaptive 
functions, so that they can tolerate a degree of damage with-
out losing basic capacities. Studies of centenarians confi rm 
this view of aging; they typically have a short period of poor 
health before death rather than suffering from prolonged 
disease-torn illness and disability.
In contrast to negative stereotypes about later life, the 
level of independent functioning among adults 80 years and 
older is high. Figure 14.1 shows the percentages of non-
institutionalized people in three age groups who needed help 
in six activities of daily living (ADLs): bathing/showering,

CHAPTER 14 Elderhood (75 until Death)
Developing a Psychohistorical 
Perspective
Objective 3. To develop the concept of an altered 
perspective on time and history that emerges among the 
long-lived.
Development in elderhood includes gains as well as losses. 
Through encounters with diverse experiences, decision mak-
ing, parenting and other forms of tutoring or mentoring of 
younger generations, and efforts to formulate a personal 
75 to 84, and increases markedly for those 85 and older. 
However, even among this oldest group, fewer than half 
require help with walking, and fewer than 35% need help 
with other basic tasks of self-care (American Administration 
on Aging, 2010). Over the past decade, the proportion of 
elderly people reporting such needs has declined. Many fac-
tors may account for this improvement in daily functioning 
for recent cohorts of the very old, including improved design 
of interior space in senior housing, new devices that make it 
easier for older adults to compensate for physical limitations, 
and medications that help alleviate the symptoms of chronic 
illness (National Center for Health Statistics, 2004).
Dementia
DEMENTIA IS THE loss of thinking, mem-
ory, and reasoning skills that signifi cantly 
impairs a person’s ability to carry out daily 
tasks. Symptoms include the inability to 
remember information, asking the same 
questions over and over again, becoming 
lost or confused in familiar places, being 
unable to follow directions, or neglecting 
personal safety, hygiene, or nutrition 
(National Institute on Aging, 2009g). Two 
of the most common causes of dementia 
in older people are vascular dementia or 
repeated small strokes and Alzheimer’s 
disease. With vascular dementia, the 
supply of blood to the brain is disrupted, 
resulting in the death of brain cells. 
The loss of function may be gradual or 
relatively sudden. The symptoms vary 
depending upon which area of the brain 
has been damaged. Memory, language, 
reasoning, or motor coordination can 
be disrupted. Supportive counseling, 
attention to diet, and skilled physical 
therapy to reestablish control of daily 
functions may restore much of the 
person’s previous level of adaptive 
behavior provided that additional strokes 
do not occur.
Alzheimer’s disease produces a 
more gradual loss of memory, reduced 
intellectual functioning, and an increase 
of mood disturbances—especially 
hostility and depression. The incidence 
of this disease increases with age, with 
fewer than 2% of people below the 
age of 60 affected by it, whereas an 
estimated 30% to 50% of those ages 85 
to 100 experience some symptoms. 
The severity of the disease also increases 
with age (He, Sengupta, Velkoff, & 
DeBarros, 2005).
A person with Alzheimer’s disease 
experiences gradual brain failure over 
a period of 7 to 10 years. Symptoms 
include severe problems in cognitive 
functioning, especially increased memory 
impairment and a rapid decline in 
the complexity of written and spoken 
language; problems with self-care; and 
behavioral problems, such as wandering, 
asking the same questions repeatedly, 
and becoming suddenly angry or 
stubborn (O’Leary, Haley, & Paul, 1993; 
Kemper, Thompson, & Marquis, 2001). 
Currently, there is no treatment that will 
reverse Alzheimer’s disease. Treatments 
address specifi c symptoms—especially 
mood and memory problems—and 
attempt to slow its progress.
As the number of older adults 
with Alzheimer’s disease and related 
disorders has grown, the plight of 
their caregivers has aroused increasing 
concern (Roth et al., 2001; Kantrowitz 
& Springen, 2007). Most Alzheimer’s 
patients are cared for at home, often 
by their adult children and their spouse. 
The caregiving process is ongoing, 
with an accumulation of stressors and 
periodic transitions as the patient’s 
condition changes. As the symptoms 
of the disease progress, caregivers 
have to restructure their personal, 
work, and family life. Caregivers often 
experience high levels of stress and 
depression as they attempt to cope 
with their responsibilities and assess the 
effectiveness or ineffectiveness of their 
efforts. Over time, they are likely to 
experience physical symptoms of their 
own, associated with the physical and 
emotional strains of this role.
When people with dementia are 
cared for at home by their spouse, 
children, or other relatives, three 
spheres of functioning intersect: home 
life, intimate or close relationships, 
and custodial care. The latter, custodial 
care, often involves routinization, 
surveillance, and indignities as a result 
of lost capacities, such as needing help 
with toileting, bathing, or dressing. 
Observations and interviews with 
caregivers and care recipients who live 
together suggest that these features 
of custodial care disrupt intimate 
relationships and home life, making 
daily experiences more monotonous, 
restrictive, and constraining. As their 
symptoms worsen, care recipients 
gradually lose many of the functions that 
support their identities as homemakers, 
parents, or intimate partners (Askham, 
Briggs, Norman, & Redfern, 2007).
The care of an older person with 
some form of dementia is fraught 
with problems and frustrations, but it 
also provides some opportunities for 
satisfaction and feelings of encour-
agement (Pinquart & Sörensen, 2003). 
The uplifts and hassles frequently 
reported by caregivers give some 
insight into the typical day-to-day 
experience of caring for a person who 
is suffering from Alzheimer’s disease 
(Kinney & Stephens, 1989; Donovan & 
Corcoran, 2010).

likely to be more forgiving, less interested in material accu-
mulation, and more focused on the emotional satisfactions of 
life (Allemand, 2008; Brandtstädter, Rothermund, Kranz, & 
Kühn, 2010).
Think about what it means to have lived for 75 or more 
years. Those adults who were 80 years old in 2010 lived 
through the Great Depression; World War II; the Korean 
war; the Vietnam war; the Gulf war; the Afghan and Iraqi 
wars; the assassination of President Kennedy; Watergate; the 
Clinton impeachment trials; the AIDS epidemic; the terror-
ist attacks of September 11, 2001; the fl oods that destroyed 
much of New Orleans; and the election of the fi rst African 
philosophy, adults reach new levels of conscious thought. 
Very old adults are more aware of alternatives; they can look 
deeply into both the past and the future, and can recognize 
that opposing forces can exist side by side (Riegel, 1973; 
Kunzmann & Baltes, 2005). The product of this integration of 
past, present, and future is the formation of a psychohistorical 
perspective. Through a process of creative coping, elders in 
each generation blend the salient events of their past histories 
with the demands of current reality. They are able to consider 
the contextual variations and uncertainties that are inherent in 
trying to make sense of life’s challenges. Having lived a long 
time, and envisioning less time in the future, elders are more 
The uplifts include the following:
• Seeing care recipient calm
• Sharing a joke, laughing together 
with the care recipient
• Seeing care recipient responsive
• Care recipient showing affection
• Friends and family showing under-
standing about caregiving
• Care recipient recognizing familiar 
people, smiling or winking
• Care recipient being cooperative
• Leaving care recipients with others 
at home
Some of the hassles include:
• Care recipient being confused or not 
making sense
• Care recipient’s forgetfulness, asking 
repetitive questions
• Care recipient’s agitation, anger, or 
refusing help
• Care recipient’s bowel or bladder 
accidents
• Seeing care recipient withdrawn or 
unresponsive
• Dressing and bathing care recipient, 
assisting with toileting
• Care recipient declining physically
• Care recipient not sleeping through 
the night
Two of the symptoms that are 
most diffi cult to manage are sleep 
disturbances and wandering. As 
cognitive functioning declines, the 
pattern of sleep deteriorates. A person 
with Alzheimer’s disease sleeps for 
only short periods, napping on and off 
during the day and night. Often, the 
napping is accompanied by wakeful 
periods at night, during which the 
person is confused, upset, and likely to 
wander. Caregivers must therefore be 
continuously alert, night and day. Their 
own sleep is disturbed as they try to 
remain alert to the person’s whereabouts. 
When the disease reaches this level, 
family caregivers are most likely to fi nd 
it necessary to institutionalize the family 
member. Alzheimer’s disease is a major 
cause of hospitalization and nursing 
home placement among the elderly; 
an estimated 50% of nursing home 
residents have Alzheimer’s disease or a 
related form of dementia (He, Sengupta, 
Velkoff, & DeBarros, 2005).
A woman who remembers her 
mother as independent, with strong 
views and a deep commitment to social 
justice, describes some of the ups and 
downs as she witnesses her mother’s 
condition:
My mother also had strong views on qual-
ity of life issues for the elderly. We had 
often spoken about the importance of be-
ing able to die in a digniﬁ ed way. She has 
a living will and opposes heroic measures 
to prolong life. I am convinced that Mom 
wouldn’t want the quality of life she now 
has. She can’t express herself, is unable 
to hold a knife or fork, has no control over 
her bodily functions and can’t walk.
However, on a recent visit to her 
mother, who is living in a group home, 
she describes the following scene:
I worried … that Mom wouldn’t recog-
nize me this time. But when I got there, 
she looked up at me and broke into a 
huge smile. She was truly excited to see 
me. She laughed and as I hugged her, 
we both cried. Then she began to speak 
nonstop gibberish. Although she can’t tell 
us otherwise, my mother appears to be 
happy…. I honestly don’t know if she has 
any thoughts about quality of life. (Simon, 
2002, p. B7)
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Imagine that you are responsible for 
the care of a loved one who has Al-
zheimer’s disease. What steps could 
you take to help support their opti-
mal functioning?
 2. Why do you think attention to diet is 
a recuperative component for people 
with vascular dementia?
 3. Do you think that psychosocial de-
velopment continues for people 
who have Alzheimer’s disease? What 
about the caregivers? How might the 
responsibilities of care contribute to 
or impede their psychosocial devel-
opment?
 4. Why might sleep disturbances and 
wandering be the symptoms that are 
most likely to lead to institutionaliza-
tion for those with Alzheimer’s disease?
 5. Why might an adult child want to 
care for a parent who has Alzheimer’s 
disease rather than place him or her 
in a nursing home or extended care 
facility?
 6. If you were to take on the responsi-
bilities for someone with dementia, 
how would you prepare for this role? 
How would you plan for the long-
term nature of this responsibility and 
the continuing deterioration of your 
loved one?

CHAPTER 14 Elderhood (75 until Death)
An international group of leaders, The Elders, is a different 
example of how people can bring their life experiences to 
bear to address critical issues (www.theelders.org). The Elders 
has formed to help address some of the serious and seem-
ingly intractable problems that plague our world. A premise 
of this group is that in traditional societies, the oldest mem-
bers of the group were looked to for their wisdom and guid-
ance in efforts to resolve diffi cult confl icts. In today’s world, 
where the confl icts are often of an international and intercul-
tural nature, the global community is in need of a group of 
respected and trusted leaders who can offer guidance with-
out a vested interest in a particular national, industrial, or 
religious advantage. The founding members of the The Elders 
are characterized as “trusted, respected worldly-wise indi-
viduals with a proven commitment and record of contribut-
ing to solving global problems.” The current group of Elders 
includes: Martti Ahtisarri, Nelson Mandela, Graça Machel, 
Desmond Tutu, Kofi Annan, Ela Bhatt, Lakhdar Brahimi, 
Gro Brundtland, Jimmy Carter, Fernando H. Cardoso, Mary 
 Robinson, and Aung San Suu Kyi. The Elders hope to share 
their wisdom, forged over a long lifetime and opportunities 
for international leadership.
A current effort by The Elders is to support worldwide 
immunization of children for polio and measles. They are 
working to support reunifi cation of Cyprus, and to facilitate 
peaceful negotiations in the Middle East (The Elders, 2010).
As the example of The Elders suggests, a psychohistorical 
perspective contributes to the wisdom that the very old bring 
to their understanding of the meaning of life. As a result of 
living a long time, a person becomes aware of life’s lessons as 
well as its uncertainties. The integration of a long-term past, 
present, and future combined with an appreciation for the 
relativistic nature of human experience allows these adults 
to bring an acceptance of alternative solutions and a commit-
ment to essential positive values (Baltes & Staudinger, 2000).
We are all part of the process of psychosocial evolution. 
Each generation adds to the existing knowledge base and 
reinterprets the norms of society for succeeding generations. 
The very old are likely to be parents, grandparents, and 
great-grandparents. Many are seeing their lines of descent 
continue into the fourth generation, which will dominate the 
21st century. The opportunity to see several generations of 
offspring brings a new degree of continuity to life, linking 
memories of one’s own grandparents to observations of one’s 
great-grandchildren (Wentowski, 1985). We can expect the 
value of the oral tradition of history and storytelling to take 
on new meaning as the very old help their great-grandchil-
dren feel connected to the distant past. We can also expect a 
greater investment in the future, as the very old see in their 
great-grandchildren the concrete extension of their ancestry 
three generations into the future.
Erikson (Erikson et al., 1986) identifi ed the emergence of 
these tendencies in the very old in the following excerpt:
The elder has a reservoir of strength in the wellsprings of 
history and storytelling. As collectors of time and preservers 
American president. They have experienced the political 
leadership of 14 presidents. During their lives, they have 
adapted to dramatic technological innovations in commu-
nication, transportation, manufacturing, economics, food 
production, leisure activities, and health care. They have also 
experienced striking changes in cultural and political values.
One consequence of a long life is the accumulation of 
experiences. Another is the realization that change is a basic 
element of all life at the individual and social levels. Some-
times, these changes appear cyclical; at other times, they 
appear to bring real transformations. For example, people 
who are now age 80 lived during World War II, when women 
were involved in the labor market while men served in the 
military; the 1950s, when many women withdrew from the 
labor market and committed themselves to working at home; 
and the 1970s up to the present, when it has become nor-
mative for women to be employed outside the home, even 
when they have very young children. The patterns of behavior 
that younger adults might view as normative and necessary, 
elders may recognize as part of fl uctuating social or historical 
conditions. Within the framework of an extended life, very 
old adults have opportunities to gain a special perspective on 
conditions of continuity and change within their culture. In 
the process of developing such a psychohistorical perspec-
tive, they develop a personal understanding of the effects of 
history on individual lives and of one’s place in the chain of 
events. As society becomes more accustomed to having a sig-
nifi cant group of very old adults functioning in the commu-
nity, some scholars anticipate that a culture of aging will emerge 
in technological societies. This culture is likely to provide 
more opportunities for the expression of the pragmatic wis-
dom accumulated over a long lifetime through theater, music, 
the arts, and critical commentary. At the same time, new roles 
will evolve for successful agers as mentors and advisors to the 
young (Kunzmann & Baltes, 2005). In the United Kingdom, 
pensioners have created the Retirement Lounge, an online set-
ting where retirees can interact and share their experiences:
Social interaction is extremely important when we leave work 
for good. We are no longer in the working environment to 
share a joke or gossip with our colleagues. Sadly, many retir-
ees get trapped in their home environment with no one to talk 
to apart from their family members, if they are fortunate to 
have them around. With that in mind, this portal is set up to 
serve the needs of senior citizens. This is a Pensioners Corner. 
With our pool of experience and knowledge base we should 
be able to help each other. (retirement-lounge.com, 2010)
Another online resource is sponsored by TIAA, 
myretirement.org. It has over 13,000 members who share 
ideas about weekly topics, access information about cur-
rent trends, respond to surveys about topics of relevance to 
older adults and read about the results, share aspirations, 
thoughts, and photos with others. Other sites where older 
adults are sharing their expertise include: coolgrandma.com, 
senior.com, eldercareonline (econline.com), seniornet.org, 
and senioryears.com.

preservation of a coherent self-concept. In early adulthood, 
there is an opportunity to engage in many new roles and 
to establish a lifestyle that expresses the priorities of one’s 
personal identity. In middle adulthood, the pressure of life 
roles and their competing demands may be at their peak. 
During later adulthood, the challenge is to establish an 
integrated sense of self that helps to compensate for the loss 
of salient life roles and to protect the person from a sense 
of despair. In elderhood, those who cope most effectively 
have been able to focus on certain valued characteristics 
of the self and to optimize them despite diffi cult changes 
in their social and physical resources (Diehl, Hastings, & 
Stanton, 2001).
The MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Suc-
cessful Aging (Rowe & Kahn, 1998) has offered a new, inter-
disciplinary perspective on the distinction between usual 
and successful aging. Those characterized by usual aging 
may be functioning well but are at high risk for disease, dis-
ability, and reduced capacity for functional independence. 
In contrast, the successful agers are characterized by three 
interdependent features (see Figure 14.2). They have a “low 
risk of disease and disease-related disabilities; high mental 
and physical function; and active engagement with life” 
(p. 38). This last feature, active engagement, is a frequently 
repeated theme in the fi eld of gerontology.
In an effort to describe the norms that older adults use 
to guide their conduct, researchers asked older adults from 
New York City and Savannah, Georgia, to respond to six 
pictures similar to the two drawings in Figure 14.3 (Offen-
bacher & Poster, 1985). The responses to the following two 
questions were used to construct a code of conduct: “How 
do you think that people who know this person, such as 
family or friends, feel about him or her?” and “How do you 
of memory, those healthy elders who have survived into a 
reasonably fi t old age have time on their side—time that is 
to be dispensed wisely and creatively, usually in the form of 
stories, to those younger ones who will one day follow in 
their footsteps. Telling these stories, and telling them well, 
marks a certain capacity for one generation to entrust itself 
to the next, by passing on a certain shared and collective 
identity to the survivors of the next generation: the future. 
(p. 331)
Traveling Uncharted Territory: 
Life Structures in Elderhood
Objective 4. To explore elements of the lifestyle 
structure in elderhood, especially living arrangements 
and gender roles.
How should elders behave? What norms exist to guide 
their social relationships or the structure of their daily 
lives? What does a healthy 85-year-old woman consider 
appropriate behavior, and what expectations do others 
have for her? When we talk about traveling uncharted 
territory, we are assuming that elderhood is a time of life 
for which there are few age-specific social norms. The 
very old are creating their own definitions of this life 
stage. You may have heard the expression “Life begins at 
80.” One interpretation of this adage is that because there 
are so few norms for behavior and so few responsibilities 
when one reaches elderhood, one can do whatever one 
wants.
Changes in role relationships—especially role loss in 
later adulthood—present significant challenges to the

is expressed across ethnic groups. However, the ways that 
women defi ne empowerment and experience successful aging 
is related, in part, to their cultural values and worldview. In 
a study of women between the ages of 60 and 80, nine dif-
ferent ethnic groups were self-defi ned by the participants: 
English, British Muslim, African Caribbean, Dominican, Brit-
ish Irish, Pakistani, British Polish, Indian, and Bangladeshi 
(Wray, 2003). For some of these women, freedom from the 
burdens of care for their aging family members or children 
was a valued opportunity for empowerment in later life. A 
number of women engaged in forms of group religious ser-
vices and the related opportunities for social interaction, 
volunteer work, and prayer, which created feelings of social 
inclusion and agency.
I am baptized Sikh and value religion to guide me and 
have focus in life. My religion has infl uenced my life very 
positively; this has helped me to care for my husband and 
cope with stressful events. I have planned days when I visit 
friends and attend religious activities. These are also my 
means of socializing. We offer each other support and get 
involved in charity work. (Wray, 2003, p. 519)
For some women, paid employment or volunteer work 
keeps them connected to society and provides feelings of 
being in control of their daily lives. Finally, some women 
spoke of their time with their grandchildren and the respon-
sibilities they had for their grandchildren’s care as contribut-
ing to a sense of purpose and well-being. In some cultural 
groups, the opportunity to strengthen their connection with 
their religious and ethnic communities created a form of col-
lective agency. In other cultural groups, the opportunity to 
continue to express self-reliance and control over daily life 
was especially signifi cant. Among most of the women, some 
form of interdependence and participation in meaningful 
social relationships played a key role in sustaining feelings of 
agency and continued self-worth.
The fact that older adults must carve out new patterns of 
adapting to later life is illustrated in the following sections 
in two specifi c areas of functioning: living arrangements and 
gender role defi nitions.
Living Arrangements
Approximately 78% of U.S. adults ages 75 and older 
own their own homes. However, the pattern of living 
arrangements changes after age 75, especially for women 
(see Figure 14.4). Before that age, the majority of older 
adults live in family households, mostly as married couples. 
Among adults ages 75 and older, however, only 45% live 
with a spouse; the others either live alone or with family or 
nonrelatives. The pattern differs by gender. Among women 
ages 75 and older, 48% live alone; among men ages 75 and 
older, only 23% live alone (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008). 
Older women are less likely than men to remarry after the 
death of their spouse, and older women are less likely to live 
with other family members than they were in the past. For 
unmarried elders, functional status and cognitive functioning 
feel about this person?” Four normative principles were 
found in the responses:
 1. Don’t be sorry for yourself.
 2. Try to be independent.
 3. Don’t just sit there; do something.
 4. Above all, be sociable.
This code of conduct suggests that older people believe 
that being sociable, active, and independent constitute suc-
cessful living in later life. Of course, older adults are not 
alone in valuing these qualities. However, these norms are 
important as sources of self-esteem for this age group. They 
promote a sense of vigor and a shield against depression or 
discouragement.
The themes “Don’t be sorry for yourself” and “Don’t just 
sit there” suggest that the very old continue to see their 
lives as precious resources that are not to be wasted in self-
pity and passivity. The emphasis on activity as opposed to 
meditation refl ects the Western cultural value of a sense of 
agency—thinking is not as highly valued as action. In con-
trast, doing things, having an impact, and receiving the feed-
back that action stimulates provide the keys to successful 
living. Subsequent studies have supported the idea that fi nd-
ing meaning in one’s existence, continuing to experience a 
sense of social competence, and perceptions of self-effi cacy 
help older adults maintain a sense of well-being (Onedera 
& Stickle, 2008). For example, by continuing to participate 
in intellectually complex and challenging leisure activities—
such as reading stimulating books and magazines; going to 
museums, concerts, and plays; or participating in hobbies 
that require decision making and problem solving—older 
adults contribute to preserving their intellectual fl exibility 
(Schooler & Mulatu, 2001).

America. In countries with higher levels of education for the 
general population, families were more likely to have nuclear 
households with older adults living alone (Bongaarts & 
Zimmer, 2002).
Living Alone. One implication of these trends in liv-
ing arrangements is that increasing numbers of women are 
establishing a new single lifestyle in which they function 
as heads of households at ages 75 and older. Though still 
in need of social interaction and support services, they are 
often relieved of the responsibilities of caring for spouses 
who were ill. Depending on their own health, these women 
may be freer to direct their time and interests toward their 
friends, grandchildren, hobbies, and activities than they have 
are key factors that lead to living with one’s children or other 
relatives (Liang et al., 2005).
Living arrangements among older adults are linked to 
cultural values associated with individualism and indepen-
dence or collectivism and interdependence. In a comparison 
of living arrangements of older adults in 43 countries, older 
adults were the most likely age group to live alone. However, 
in Africa it was more common for older adults to head up a 
large household that included young children than in other 
countries. In Asia co-residence with adult children was more 
common than in Africa. When older adults lived with their 
children, co-residence with adult sons and their families was 
more common in Asia and Africa, but co-residence with 
adult daughters and their families was more common in Latin

widowed (U.S. Census Bureau, 2007). Widowed men are 
much more likely to remarry, which they tend to do quickly. 
However, remarriage among the very old is still a new frontier. 
Sexual and social stereotypes inhibit some older people from 
considering remarriage. Also, potential fi nancial consequences 
may make remarriage undesirable. For instance, a widow may 
lose her husband’s pension or her social security benefi ts if 
she remarries. However, some older couples cope with this 
problem by living together instead of marrying. In 2003, there 
were 280,000 men and women ages 65 and older living as 
unmarried heterosexual couples (Fields, 2003). Those who do 
remarry usually view the new relationship quite positively.
In contrast to those older women who live alone and those 
who live with a male partner, an emerging strategy is for sev-
eral older women to live together. This alternative addresses 
the increasing costs of housing in many communities as well 
as the growing research evidence about the health and men-
tal health risks of social isolation and loneliness in later life. 
Women of the baby boom generation are more likely to have 
experienced divorce and have smaller families than the pre-
vious generation of older adults. Many of these women have 
developed and nurtured friendships with other women from 
their high school and college years, in the workplace, and 
through community participation. As they begin planning for 
later adulthood, the idea of sharing the costs and responsi-
bilities with good friends can be quite appealing. “We lived 
together in dorms and sororities. We shared apartments after 
graduation. We traveled together. We helped each other 
through divorce and the death of our parents. Why not take it 
to the next level?” (Gross, 2004, p. 1).
Interstate Migration. The great majority of older adults 
(more than 90%) remain in their home communities as 
been at any other time in their lives. In a qualitative study of 
older widows’ experiences, four themes emerged: (1) mak-
ing aloneness acceptable, (2) going my own way, (3) reduc-
ing my risks, and (4) sustaining myself (Porter, 1994). One 
aspect of this process of adaptation, often linked to “going 
my own way” and “reducing my risks,” is a decision to move 
from one’s residence. In a longitudinal study of residential 
mobility, individuals were interviewed over a 20-year period. 
Widowhood was found to be a signifi cant event that trig-
gered a decision to move, often within the first year after 
becoming widowed (Chevan, 1995).
The pattern of elderly women living alone is similar 
in Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other northern 
European countries, but it is not as common in southern 
Europe and developing countries, where both older 
men and women, whether married or widowed, live in mul-
tigenerational families. For example, data gathered in four 
Asian countries—Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, and 
Vietnam—in the mid-1990s found that from 60% to 90% of 
older adults lived with their children and grandchildren. The 
case of Japan illustrates the possible impact of moderniza-
tion on the living arrangements of the elderly. In 1960, about 
90% of older adults lived with their children (or one might 
say that the children lived with them in their households). 
By 1990, this type of living arrangement had declined to 
50%. Both the increasing longevity and improved fi nancial 
resources of older adults contribute to this trend toward 
independent housing, which is coupled with a continued 
desire for close kinship ties (Kinsella & Velkoff, 2001).
In the United States, living arrangements for older women 
differ by race and ethnic group. Older unmarried Asian 
American women, for example, are much more likely to live 
with other family members than to live alone in compari-
son to European American women of similar economic and 
educational backgrounds. Within the Asian American ethnic 
groups, acculturation appears to increase the likelihood of 
choosing to live alone. Those who immigrated to the United 
States before 1965 or who were born in the United States are 
more likely to live alone than the more recent immigrants. 
In a comparison among the Asian American cultures, older 
Japanese women were more likely to live alone than the Chi-
nese, Filipino, and Korean women. Consistent with patterns 
for European American women, the more children these 
Asian American women had, the less likely they were to be 
institutionalized (Burr & Mutchler, 1993).
Older African Americans are more likely than other eth-
nic groups to live in large households where the membership 
is changing over time. In a sample of older Floridians, the 
African American elders were more likely than other groups 
to form co-resident relationships with their grandchildren 
and other nonrelatives. As marital status, aging, and disabil-
ity or health needs of family and fi ctive kin dictated, African 
American households were more likely to add new members 
(Peek, Koropeckyj-Cox, Zsembik, & Coward, 2004).
The majority of very old men—about 70%—are mar-
ried and live with their spouses; only 21% are widowed. In 
contrast, 33% of very old women are married, and 57% are

older adults (see the box on the impact of gentrifi cation on 
the very old). Because older adults tend to have a limited 
income and depend on the quality of community resources 
and social support for their well-being, moving can be an 
especially diffi cult life event, adversely affecting their overall 
well-being (Pynoos, Caraviello, & Cicero, 2010).
Institutional Care. About 1.5 million adults older than 65 
live in nursing homes. This includes any arrangement with 
three or more beds that provides nursing and personal care 
services (U.S. Census Bureau, 2007). Nursing homes provide 
nursing care and rehabilitation for people who have severe 
functional limitations as a result of acute illness, surgery, or 
advanced dementia. The likelihood of institutionalization 
increases with age and limitations in family support. About 
75% of people in nursing homes do not have spouses. The 
likelihood of a person living in a nursing home increases 
when there is no family member who can help to manage 
daily living needs. Among nursing home residents, about 
13% are 65 to 74 years old, 35% are 75 to 84, and 51% are 
85 and older (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004b). People tend to 
think that once older adults are admitted to a nursing home, 
they stay there until they die. In fact, there is a high annual 
turnover among nursing home residents. Often, a person 
enters a nursing home for a period of convalescence after 
hospitalization and then returns home or to a setting that 
provides less intensive care.
Many nursing homes are part of a continuing care retirement 
community— a residential setting offering housing and med-
ical, preventive health, and social services to residents who are 
well at the time they enter the community. Once admitted, 
they are guaranteed nursing care if they become ill or disabled 
(Shapiro, 2001). In an analysis of nursing home use among 
residents in continuing care retirement communities, the risk 
of being transferred to the nursing home facility appeared to 
be greater than the rate for older adults in the local commu-
nity, but the length of stay per admission was shorter (Cohen, 
Tell, Bishop, Wallack, & Branch, 1989). The nursing home 
may be used for recuperative purposes rather than having 
patients stay in the hospital for a longer period. This practice 
may reduce overall medical costs and provide a better recov-
ery environment than being discharged to one’s home before 
one can fully manage all the demands of self-care.
The advantages of a continuing care community are 
described by Glenn Smith:
“We’d seen a lot of people our age struggle when one went 
into a skilled nursing facility 6 miles away,” says 76-year-
old Glenn Smith. “Then someone has to drive Momma over 
to see Daddy every day.” So Smith and his wife, Kathleen, 
moved to a CCRC (continuing care retirement community) 
atop a hill overlooking Oregon’s Rogue River Valley. A nurs-
ing home is just a short walk from their spacious three bed-
room cottage. Smith, who is a retired college administrator, 
has one bit of advice: Move in while you are younger and 
healthy in order to take full advantage of the activities—and 
pay a lower entry fee. (Shapiro, 2001, p. 60)
they age, many preferring to stay in their own home, even 
after their children move out and their spouse dies. Yet the 
trend toward interstate migration has increased since the 
mid-1960s. Each year, roughly 1% to 2% of those 75 and 
older move to a new residence across state lines (U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau, 2004b). Many of these older interstate migrants 
will live out their lives in communities in which they did not 
grow up, work, or raise their children. They are pioneers, 
establishing new friendships, community involvements, and 
lifestyles. Another signifi cantly large group of older adults 
return to their birth state, especially after one’s spouse dies 
or, in the case of serious disability, in order to be close to 
family caregivers (Stoller & Longino, 2001). In the face of 
some new physical limitations, older adults may want to be 
able to remain independent but require more help. By mov-
ing back to their home community, they are more confi dent 
about being able to draw on needed support from family 
and friends (Rowles & Ravdal, 2002). In addition to these 
permanent moves, many older adults participate in seasonal 
migration—residents from southern states go north for the 
summer, and residents of northern states go south for the 
winter. Over time, some of these seasonal migrants decide to 
establish a permanent residence in the state they visit. This 
is especially likely for northern residents who establish 
permanent residence in the South (Hogan & Steinnes, 1998).
Housing Options. Differences in lifestyle, health, inter-
est, ability to perform daily activities, marital status, and 
income enter into the very old person’s preference for hous-
ing arrangements. Housing for the elderly—sometimes 
referred to as retirement housing—has expanded dramatically, 
and developers have experimented with a great variety of 
housing confi gurations that are intended to meet the spe-
cial needs of particular aging populations (Shapiro, 2001). 
These options range from inner-city hotels for those with 
minimal incomes to sprawling luxury villages with apart-
ments, medical clinics, and sponsored activities. Retirement 
communities are typically age-restricted residences. They 
may be apartments in a high-rise, townhouses, or homes 
with shared recreational resources, like a fitness center, 
pool, or golf course, and social and cultural programming. 
Often, they provide the option for prepared meals or a com-
munal dining center. Life satisfaction in a retirement com-
munity may depend on the fi t between one’s marital status 
and the demographics of the community. For example, one 
study assessed the life satisfaction of widows who were liv-
ing alone in retirement communities. When widows out-
numbered married couples in the community, the widows 
had a high frequency of seeing friends and participating in 
activities. However, when married couples outnumbered 
widows, the widows experienced less satisfaction and were 
more socially isolated (Hong & Duff, 1994).
The majority of older adults live in urban areas, and 31% 
live in inner-city neighborhoods. As a result, any economic 
factors that affect the housing options in urban communi-
ties have a signifi cant impact on the living arrangements of

CHAPTER 14 Elderhood (75 until Death)
The Impact of 
Gentrifi cation on 
the Elderly
GENTRIFICATION IS A process of urban 
renewal or renovation in which new 
home owners and developers invest in 
the rehabilitation of neighborhoods that 
have been declining or deteriorating 
due to lack of maintenance and upkeep 
of the properties. Middle and upper 
income residents move into areas 
that have been deteriorating, often 
displacing poorer residents who have 
lived in that area for some time. To 
make investment in new construction 
and rehabilitation of older housing 
stock profi table, developers must be 
able to attract residents who can pay 
higher rents such as professionals and 
managers (the urban gentry). Once 
this process gets under way, landlords 
have an incentive to evict low-income 
residents who may have lived in the 
neighborhood for a long time in favor 
of more affl uent tenants who can afford 
higher rent (Wetzel, 2004).
Several consequences of gentri-
fi cation can have a negative impact 
on the housing options of older 
adults (Singelakis, 1990). First, 
rental apartments are converted to 
condominiums, which older adults 
cannot afford. Second, in areas where 
there is no rent control, the rent 
rises above the rate that the older 
person is able to pay. Where there is 
rent regulation, some landlords use 
harassment to force out the original 
residents. Third, properties that have 
been used as single-room-occupancy 
hotels are demolished and new 
structures are built. Single-room-
occupancy hotels provide low-cost 
housing and social support to many 
older adults who live alone. From 1970 
to 1982, more than half the single-room-
occupancy units in the United States 
were lost to various urban gentrifi cation 
projects (Hopper & Hamberg, 1986). 
A similar study of gentrifi cation in 
London found a signifi cant displacement 
of the elderly, with the hidden costs 
of overcrowding in family, friends’, 
or relatives’ homes; homelessness; 
and expanded unmet housing needs 
(Atkinson, 2000).
In addition to reducing access to 
affordable housing, the disruption 
in older adults’ living arrangements 
can have health implications due 
to dispersion of the person’s social 
support network, reduced access to 
public transportation, and less readily 
accessible sources of basic goods and 
services (CDC, 2010a).
Although gentrifi cation poses 
threats to housing for the elderly, the 
alternative of ongoing neglect and 
decay in urban neighborhoods brings its 
own risks—especially increased crime, 
health and safety hazards, and lack of 
services. Over time, people with more 
resources leave these neighborhoods, 
making them vulnerable to continued 
deterioration. Writing about the process 
of gentrifi cation in Los Angeles, David 
Zahniser describes it as follows:
That, in a nutshell, is the most maddening 
thing about gentriﬁ cation—its very duality, 
the way in which it simultaneously delivers 
pleasure and pain, miraculous beneﬁ ts and 
terrible consequences. As middle-income 
residents move in, neighborhoods that 
once heard low-ﬂ ying helicopters and au-
tomatic-weapons ﬁ re have found a greater 
measure of peace. Working-class families 
who scraped together the money to buy 
homes in the mid-1990s have happily 
cashed out, making hundreds of thousands 
of dollars en route to a ﬁ ve-bedroom home 
in Fontana, Las Vegas or Phoenix. Those 
who stay behind, however, frequently ﬁ nd 
themselves in a neighborhood they don’t 
recognize. And those who rent in a rapidly 
gentrifying neighborhood discover that 
they gained physical security while losing 
economic security, with rents rising steadily 
and the inventory of reasonably priced 
homes shrinking. (Zahniser, 2006, p. 2)
More positive approaches suggest a 
gradual rehabilitation or redevelopment 
of urban communities that preserves 
the identity of the neighborhood but 
encourages new building and new 
businesses at a slower rate of growth 
(West, 1999; CDC, 2010a). Some cities 
have placed a freeze on the conversions 
of rental units to condominiums. Others 
have created community land trusts where 
residents own the units or homes they live 
in, but the community owns the land, thus 
helping to control its use. This strategy is 
intended to help protect the neighborhood 
atmosphere and tone that have been 
created by its long-term residents.
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. Why might older adults be especially 
likely to be impacted by gentrifi ca-
tion? Why might the increased costs 
of rental or condominium purchase 
be especially diffi cult for them?
 2. What are the particular stressors that 
an older adult might face if gentrifi -
cation results in a loss of their rental 
housing unit?
 3. What might be the psychological 
effects of moving to a new neighbor-
hood for people who are in their 
eighties or nineties?
 4. Why do you think the elderly might 
want to remain in their apartment or 
home, even if the neighborhood is 
deteriorating?
 5. What obligations do you think local 
governments and developers should 
assume for the housing needs of 
the elderly in neighborhoods when 
older housing stock is renovated or 
replaced?
APPLYING THEORY AND RESEARCH TO LIFE
Aging in Place. The fastest growing component of the 
Medicare program is community-based long-term health 
care, which provides medical and social services to those 
who are chronically ill and eligible for institutionalization 
but who, nevertheless, live in the community. At their best, 
these programs are designed to complement and support 
informal caregiving, supplementing and providing relief for 
family members and friends who are trying to care for the 
very old. They bring comfort to the very old clients who pre-
fer to remain in their homes.
These programs also offer fl exibility by providing needed 
services and modifying them as a person’s condition changes.

CASE STUDY
MR. Z
The following case illustrates the importance of psychologi-
cal attitudes in allowing a person with serious physical prob-
lems to play a meaningful role in a social setting for the frail 
elderly. Mr. Z’s outlook helps him maintain his vitality and 
express his love of life.
Mr. M.L. Z is an 89-year-old White male of Eastern European 
origin. He lives in a midsized nursing home in the Midwest. 
Many of his daily activities revolve around circulating among 
the facility’s residents, chatting, playing cards, reading to 
them, and “fetching things.” Most important, Mr. Z carries 
his old battered violin with him and at the drop of a hat will 
play a tune or break into song in a surprisingly strong, clear, 
melodic voice. He claims to be able to sing songs in any one 
of seven languages, and with the least encouragement will 
try out several for anyone who will listen.
Mr. Z is small (5’ 3’’), frail looking, and completely bald. He 
has facial scars and wears extremely thick-lensed glasses. He 
seems to be known and well liked by practically all residents 
and staff of the facility in which he resides, and by many visi-
tors there as well.
He recalls a colorful history. He “escaped” his homeland at 
the tender age of 16 to avoid compulsory military service and 
fl ed to Russia. There he was inducted into the army, and was 
subsequently sent off to duty in Siberia, where he lived for 
about 6 years. After another tour of duty in a border patrol 
he deserted, he made his way across Europe, and eventually 
came to the United States. Here he took odd jobs, educated 
himself, and in time “got into show business”; he became 
a vaudeville prompter. In time his contacts in entertainment 
took him around the world. Yet time took its toll.
For example, a home health service may provide a case man-
ager who can identify the required services and coordinate a 
program of home care providers, services, and adult day care 
to meet the needs of the client and the client’s support system. 
Long-term home health care programs evolve in response to 
the pattern of need that emerges in a community and the qual-
ity of the services available. As the programs develop, their 
emphasis tends to shift from providing services to those who 
would otherwise be institutionalized to preventing institution-
alization among a high-risk population (Kaye, 1995; Kasper, 
1997; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2005).
The benefi ts of remaining in one’s home, despite serious 
limitations in functional independence, are (1) preserving 
one’s sense of autonomy and dignity, (2) reducing expenses, 
and (3) sustaining relationships with family and friends. In 
contrast, the move to a nursing home tends to be associ-
ated with higher levels of dependence and greater emphasis 
on “going along with the program” rather than on initiat-
ing one’s own plans and projects. In a comparison of older 
women living in their homes and those living in a nursing 
care facility, researchers were interested in how the living 
arrangements might influence cognitive problem solving. 
The home-based group became more engaged in the hypo-
thetical problems, their solutions suggested a greater sense 
of perceived control over the solutions, and they approached 
the problems in a more abstract, relativistic manner (Collins, 
Luszcz, Lawson, & Keeves, 1997). The results of this work 
suggest that the nursing home environment may operate to 
undermine cognitive functioning by reducing the need for 
independent problem-solving activity. However, as the case 
study about Mr. Z suggests, there are nursing home residents 
who retain their positive spirit and are able to help others 
while receiving the level of support they require given their 
serious physical disabilities.
At 97 years of age, Stella has 
had to move into a nursing 
home because she can no 
longer walk. Periodic visits 
from her great-grandson keep 
her in good spirits. He plays, 
and she is a most appreciative 
audience.

CHAPTER 14 Elderhood (75 until Death)
The extent to which men and women become more simi-
lar in outlook and behavior in later adulthood and elderhood 
is a subject of controversy. Unfortunately, few data from lon-
gitudinal or cohort sequential studies are available to address 
this topic. Cross-sectional data collected from men and 
women across a wide age span from early adulthood to elder-
hood have focused on men’s and women’s endorsement of 
affi liative and instrumental values. Men and women appear 
to be similar in their affi liative values—that is, the values 
placed on helping or pleasing others, refl ected in the amount 
of time they spend and the degree of satisfaction they achieve 
in such actions. At each age, men are more invested than 
women in instrumental values—that is, the values placed 
on doing things that are challenging, refl ected in the amount 
of time they spend and the degree of satisfaction they achieve 
in such actions. However, the youngest age groups value 
instrumentality more highly and devote more time to it than 
the oldest age group. Thus, gender differences in instrumen-
tality persist, but instrumentality becomes somewhat less 
important for older men and women. Affi liative behavior is 
equally important for men and women at both ages (Fultz & 
Herzog, 1991).
The stereotypes that are applied to aging men and women 
reflect similar patterns. College students and older adults 
(with a mean age of 70) were asked to generate character-
istics in response to one of four target stimuli: a 35-year-
old man, a 35-year-old woman, a 65-year-old man, and a 
65-year-old woman (Kite, Deaux, & Miele, 1991). Age ste-
reotypes were more prevalent than gender stereotypes. The 
attributes that were used to characterize older men and 
women were similar and distinct from the attributes used to 
characterize younger men and women.
In general, the older target people were evaluated more 
negatively by the younger participants, but not as negatively 
by the older participants. These negative judgments included 
unattractive physical qualities as well as irritable and 
depressed personality qualities. Moreover, younger partici-
pants were more likely to characterize both male and female 
older target people as lacking in instrumental traits, such as 
achievement orientation and self-confi dence. However, they 
did not view older target people as lacking in affi liative traits, 
such as caring about others or being kind or generous. Thus, 
the gender role convergence that has been hypothesized as 
taking place with advanced age is refl ected in the stereotypes 
that younger people apply to older adults.
Gender role convergence, where it is observed, may be 
due to changing circumstances rather than to a normative 
pattern of development in later life. For example, many older 
women experience a transition from living with their hus-
bands to living alone after age 75. This change is linked to 
new demands for independence, self-reliance, and agency. 
Women who are able to meet these challenges by develop-
ing independent living skills, making effective use of social 
supports and community resources, and initiating new 
relationships are likely to experience a heightened sense of 
well-being.
He tells of marrying a woman with whom he lived for almost 
40 years. They had no children and she died some 15 years 
ago. Following her death, he began to experience a series of 
physical diffi culties. An operation for cataracts left him with 
the need for very thick glasses. At one time he had a toupee 
made, which he has not worn for some time. One leg was am-
putated because of a diabetic condition, and he now wears a 
prosthetic leg. In addition, he wears a hearing aid, false teeth, 
and, for the last year, a heart pacer. Several years ago he 
experienced what he calls a small stroke, which left him “mixed 
up” for a few days. But he “worked this out,” he reports, by 
“walking a lot,” an activity in which he engages frequently.
Mr. Z says he has never smoked and drinks only on 
occasions or holidays, and then only to a limited degree. 
He scorns food fads, and eats mostly fresh fruits and lots of 
vegetables; he loves fi sh and drinks lots of tea.
Despite all his troubles, Mr. Z maintains what is apparently 
a cheerful, optimistic view of life and circumstances, while 
he pursues his hobby of energetically helping his fellow resi-
dents keep their spirits up and their interests high. He is very 
highly regarded and seen as fi lling a very important role in his 
nursing home as a storyteller and entertainer.

CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. Imagine that you were having lunch with Mr. Z. What 
questions would you want to ask him?
 2. What are the physical challenges of aging with which 
Mr. Z must cope?
 3. Why might Mr. Z be living in a nursing home?
 4. How would you describe Mr. Z’s psychohistorical perspective?
 5. What are the unique, creative adaptations that charac-
terize Mr. Z’s story?
 6. In what sense is the nursing home optimizing Mr. Z’s 
functioning?
Gender Role Defi nitions
The way in which very old adults view masculinity and femi-
ninity is yet another aspect of traveling uncharted territory. 
How do the very old define gender roles? How does gen-
der infl uence behavior? Do very old adults make the same 
distinctions as college-age individuals about the behaviors 
that are appropriate or desirable for men and women? These 
questions remain to be answered.
Evaluating the Concept of Gender Role Conver-
gence. The idea of gender role convergence suggests a 
transformation of gender role orientation during midlife. 
According to this theoretical perspective, men become more 
nurturant and more concerned with social relationships. 
Women become more assertive and concerned with inde-
pendence and achievement. As a result, men and women 
become more androgynous and, in that sense, more similar 
in gender orientation during later life (Gutmann, 1987).

 
Developmental Tasks | 585
of love relationships (see Chapter 11, Early Adulthood), 
long-lasting marriages tend to be more companionate in 
nature, emphasizing intimacy and commitment over pas-
sion. In this model, lovemaking may take on a different 
intensity and quality over time. Current research on sexual-
ity in later life confi rms that older adults have sexual needs, 
benefi t from sexual expression, and are able to be sexually 
active. A national survey of adults ages 60 and older found 
that more than half were sexually active, meaning that they 
had intercourse, oral sex, anal intercourse, or masturbated 
at least once a month (Dunn & Cutler, 2000). This study 
found that sexual activity declined with age, but that 20% to 
25% of those in their eighties were still sexually active. Older 
couples may find greater satisfaction in intimate physical 
contact, such as kissing and caressing, and experimentation 
with new ways of experiencing sexual stimulation as genital 
intercourse becomes less frequent. Following along with the 
idea of gender role convergence, men and women become 
more similar in their sexual behavior and more harmonious 
in their lovemaking (Crooks & Bauer, 2005).
Today’s cohort of older men and women, born in the 
1930s, tend to be tied to many of the traditional gender role 
standards of their historical era. For example, older women 
are likely to believe that the only kinds of relationships that 
are possible between men and women are romantic or court-
ship relationships. Few very old women have friendships 
with very old men, partly because few older men are avail-
able, but also because most older women have no models for 
independent friendship relationships with men. During their 
early and middle adult years, their friendships with men were 
either formed while they were part of a couple or mediated 
by some other situation, such as a work setting. Many men 
in the current elderhood cohort also behave in accordance 
For many older married couples, the physical effects of 
aging bring new needs for assistance in some of the tasks 
of daily living. Because men usually marry younger women, 
they are more likely to require the assistance of their wives 
in the later years of marriage, thus shifting the balance of 
power and increasing their sense of dependency. This may 
be especially true when husbands retire while their wives 
continue to work; when husbands can no longer drive and 
must depend on their wives for transportation; or when, 
due to health constraints, husbands are restricted from per-
forming the types of household tasks that once were their 
domain, such as mowing the grass, shoveling snow, repair-
ing the home, or other tasks requiring muscle strength and 
endurance. On the other hand, among adults of 75 years and 
older, more women than men have diffi culties with mobil-
ity and require assistance in the tasks of independent living. 
Thus, health and fi tness more than gender may guide the 
nature of dyadic interactions among older couples. As men 
and women become more equal with respect to power and 
resources in their marital relationship, there may be fewer 
clear-cut gender expectations. Still, to the extent that gen-
der role distinctions help stabilize a relationship, older adults 
may be reluctant to make dramatic changes to the way their 
relationships have been structured (Silver, 2003).
Romance and Sexuality. Romance, intimacy, and sexu-
ality remain important among older married couples. The 
majority of couples who have enjoyed a close, sexually 
active relationship report little change in satisfaction from 
age 60 to 85. Some couples explore different ways of expe-
riencing sexual pleasure in later life, and others report a 
more relaxed, sexually satisfying quality in their lovemak-
ing. Using Sternberg’s (1988) model of the three dimensions 
After 60 years of marriage, Ann 
and Ted still get quite a kick 
out of being together. Their 
lives are sprinkled with many 
moments like this, when a 
glance or an expression brings 
out a loving smile.

CHAPTER 14 Elderhood (75 until Death)
inhibit their sexual behavior. These social attitudes include 
assumptions that very old adults do not have sexual desires, 
they cannot have intercourse because of sexual dysfunction, 
sex may be dangerous to their health, they are physically and 
sexually unattractive, and it is morally wrong or perverted 
for older adults to be sexually active (Crooks & Bauer, 2005). 
Current cohorts of very old adults have limited knowledge 
about sexuality and aging. A number of studies have dem-
onstrated that increasing knowledge through various types 
of sex education programs can increase permissive attitudes 
about sexuality among older adults (Hillman & Stricker, 
1994). These interventions have involved the elderly peo-
ple themselves, nursing students, college students, nursing 
home staff, and adult children of aging parents. However, 
increased knowledge does not always result in more permis-
sive attitudes. Especially among health care staff in institu-
tional settings, the institutional regulations, personal moral 
values, and practical problems of permitting sexual activity 
among residents may combine to promote a more negative 
attitude even with advanced information about sexuality and 
aging.
Cohort factors may change the current societal attitudes 
toward sexuality among the very old. Because so many more 
adult women are in the workplace, they have more experi-
ence with male colleagues. Also, changing sexual norms 
have already led many more adults to experience nonmarital 
sexual relationships. A growing openness about homosexual 
relationships may reduce some of the stigma against forming 
same-sex bonds in later life. Acceptance of new sexual rela-
tionships in later life is more likely because many adults will 
have experienced a larger number of sexual relationships in 
their earlier years of adulthood. The high divorce rate since 
the mid-1970s means that in the future more women will 
have had the experience of developing a single lifestyle that 
includes a network of both male and female friends. As the 
value of intimacy for health and well-being is more fully rec-
ognized, we may expect future groups of older adults to be 
more comfortable about forming homosexual as well as het-
erosexual intimate relationships.
The Psychosocial Crisis: 
Immortality versus Extinction
Objective 5. To identify and describe the psychosocial 
crisis of immortality versus extinction, the central process 
of social support, the prime adaptive ego quality of 
confi dence, and the core pathology of diffi dence.
By the end of later adulthood, most people have developed 
a point of view about death. Although they may continue to 
experience anxiety about their impending death, they have 
found the courage to confront their fears and overcome them. 
If older adults have achieved integrity, they believe that their 
with the gender role standards of their young adulthood. 
Although women far outnumber men at advanced ages, 
men still seem to prefer to remarry rather than play the fi eld, 
although they have become a scarce and valuable commod-
ity. The norm of serial monogamy guides these men’s behav-
ior. They are probably motivated to remarry by a desire to 
continue to be taken care of as well as to satisfy their sexual 
needs.
One of the greatest challenges to continued romantic and 
sexual intimacy in later life is widowhood. Despite the fact 
that older men are much more likely to remarry than older 
women, remarriage is relatively uncommon in later adult-
hood and elderhood. One estimate found that among 1,000 
widowed men and women older than 65, 3 women and 17 
men remarried (Clarke, 1995). These data do not address 
the question of whether older men and women would like to 
have a romantic relationship after widowhood. This question 
was addressed in a study of older couples that followed men 
and women 6 and 18 months after widowhood (Carr, 2004). 
Participants were asked two questions about their romantic 
interests: “At this point do you have any interest in dating?” 
which was answered yes or no, and “Some day I would like 
to remarry,” answered on a scale from not true at all to very 
true. They were also asked if they were dating. At 6 months 
after widowhood, men were more likely to want to be dating 
than women (17% vs. 6%), more likely to want to remarry 
(30% vs. 16%), and more likely to be dating (15% vs. less 
than 1%). At 18 months after widowhood, men were still 
more likely to want to be dating (37% vs. 15%) and more 
likely to be dating (23% vs. 9%), but about equally likely to 
want to remarry (26% vs. 19%). The most important predic-
tor of whether men or women wanted to date or remarry was 
the quality of their social support system. In general, women 
had more supportive relationships with friends than did men 
prior to widowhood. The more social support men had, the 
less likely they were to express interest in remarriage. Men 
and women who had comparable levels of social support 
from friends were equally disinterested in remarriage.
This research suggests that the picture we have about 
gender differences in motivations to find a new partner 
after widowhood needs to be revised. First, although more 
men than women are interested in new romantic relation-
ships, the majority of men do not express this interest. Sec-
ond, when social support systems are comparable, men and 
women are about equally likely to reject the idea of a new 
romantic relationship. One limitation of this research was 
the way in which interest in a new partner was defi ned, lim-
iting the alternatives for romantic relationships to dating and 
marriage. Given the potential costs of remarriage in later life, 
older adults may be looking for a different kind of intimacy 
that does not require the responsibilities of co-residence 
and the legal commitments of marriage (Davidson, 2002; 
Ghazan fareeon, Karlsson, & Borrell, 2002).

as well as an unlimited transcendental future time that begins 
with their death and extends onward into infi nity (Boyd & 
Zimbardo, 1996; Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). They begin to 
see themselves as links in a long, fl uid chain of historical and 
biological growth and change. The positive pole of this cri-
sis is a confi dence in the continuity of life, a transcendence 
of death through the development of a symbolic sense of 
immortality. The achievement of this perspective, which may 
include the incorporation of transcendental goals such as 
reuniting with loved ones after death or being released from 
the limitations of an aging body, may be accompanied with 
sentiments of joy, which contribute to feelings of well-being, 
fl exibility, and acceptance of the challenges of aging.
A psychosocial sense of immortality may be achieved and 
expressed in many ways (Lifton, 1973). Here, we explore 
fi ve possible paths toward immortality. First, one may live 
on through one’s children, sensing a connection and attach-
ment to the future through one’s life and the lives of one’s off-
spring. This type of immortality can be extended to include 
devotion to one’s country, social organizations or groups, or 
humankind.
Second, one may believe in an afterlife or a spiritual plane 
of existence that extends beyond one’s biological life. Most 
religions espouse the concept of a state of harmony with 
natural forces, so that after death, one endures beyond this 
earthly life. Among many indigenous peoples, there is a 
sacred link between the living and the dead—a responsibil-
ity on the part of the living to protect and respect the sacred 
burial grounds, and a responsibility on the part of the dead 
ancestors to look after the spiritual well-being of the living. 
This belief is illustrated in the box on the responsibility of 
native Hawaiians for their ancestors’ remains.
Third, one may achieve a sense of immortality through 
creative achievements and their impact on others. Many peo-
ple find comfort in believing that they are part of a chain 
of positive infl uences on the lives of others. This sense of 
immortality is linked to the achievement of generativity in 
middle adulthood. Adults who have made a commitment to 
improving the quality of life for others during middle adult-
hood are likely to see evidence of this effort by the time they 
reach elderhood. The bond between an individual and com-
munity makes death less fi nal. An African proverb advises 
that you live as long as someone knows your name. The 
more embedded you are in your community, and the more 
lives you have touched, the greater the sense of continuity or 
transcendence.
Fourth, one may develop the notion of participation in 
the chain of nature. In death, one’s body returns to the earth, 
and one’s energy is brought forth in a new form.
Fifth, one may achieve a sense of immortality through 
what Lifton (1973) described as experiential transcendence:
This state is characterized by extraordinary psychic unity 
and perceptual intensity. But there also occurs … a pro-
cess of symbolic reordering…. Experiential transcendence 
includes a feeling of … “continuous present” that can be 
life has made sense. This amplifies their confidence about 
the choices they have made and the goals they have achieved 
without despair over the failures, missed opportunities, or 
misfortunes that may have occurred. Thus armed, the very 
old can accept the end of life and view it as a natural part of 
the life span. They are capable of distilling wisdom from the 
events of their lives, including their successes and mistakes.
However, the very old are faced with a new challenge—
a confl ict between the acceptance of death and the inten-
sifying hope for immortality. Having lived longer than 
their cohort of friends, family members, and even, in some 
cases, their children, the very old struggle to fi nd meaning 
in their survival. All of us face a certain disbelief about our 
own mortality. Although we know that death is a certainty, 
an element of human thought prevents us from facing the 
full realization of death; we continue to hope for immortal-
ity. This quality may be adaptive, in that people who have 
a sense of hope cope with the reality of death better than 
those who do not.
Immortality
Elders have a unique appreciation of time. They recognize 
that there is a fi nite amount of future time until their death,

rapture or ecstasy in which all that one senses is the power 
of the moment. In these experiences, the duality of life and 
death dissolve, and what remains is continuous being.
Extinction
The negative pole of the psychosocial crisis of elderhood is a 
sense of being bound by the limits of one’s own life history. 
In place of a belief in continuous existence and transforma-
tion, one views the end of life as an end to motion, attach-
ment, and change. Instead of faith in the ideas of connection 
equated with eternity or with “mythical time.” This continu-
ous present is perceived as not only “here and now” but as 
inseparable from past and future. (p. 10)
The notion of cosmic transcendence has been developed 
further in the writings of Lars Tornstam, a Swedish geron-
tologist, who writes about feelings of cosmic communion 
with the spirit of the universe, and a redefi nition of time, 
space, life, and death (Tornstam, 2005). This expression of 
immortality is independent of religion, offspring, or cre-
ative achievement. It is an insight derived from moments of 
THE FOLLOWING NARRATIVE 
describes the crisis of immortality 
versus extinction in the context of 
the desecration of a native Hawaiian 
burial site. In fi ghting to stop the 
destruction, those involved were 
reminded of the commitment that 
the living have for the care and 
protection of the burial grounds of 
their ancestors:
Hawai’i Nei was born December 
1988 from the kaumah a (heaviness) 
and aokanaka (enlightenment) caused 
by the archaeological disinterment of 
over 1,100 ancestral Native Hawaiians 
from Honokahua, Maui. The ancestral 
remains were removed over the 
protests of the Native Hawaiian 
community in order to build the Ritz 
Carlton Hotel. The desecration was 
stopped following a 24-hour vigil 
at the State Capital. Governor John 
Waihe’e, a Native Hawaiian, approved 
of a settlement that returned the 
ancestral remains to their one hanau 
(birth sands), set aside the reburial site 
in perpetuity, and moved the hotel 
inland and away from the ancestral 
resting place.
In one sense Honokahua 
represents balance for from this 
tragedy came enlightenment: the 
realization by living Native Hawaiians 
that we were responsible for the 
care and protection of our ancestors 
and that cultural protocols needed 
to be relearned and laws effectively 
changed to create the empowerment 
necessary to carry out this important 
and time-honored responsibility 
to malama (take care) and kupale 
(protect) our ancestors.
Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O Hawai’i 
Nei members have trained under 
the direction of Edward and Pualani 
Kanahele of Hilo in traditional protocols 
relating to the care of na iwi kupuna 
(ancestral remains). These commitments 
were undertaken as a form of aloha and 
respect for our own families, ancestors, 
parents, and children.
Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O Hawai’i 
Nei has been taught by the Kanahele 
family about the importance of pule 
(prayer) necessary to ho’olohe (listen) 
to the calling of our ancestors. Through 
pule we request the assistance of ke 
akua and our ancestors to provide us 
with the tools necessary to conduct our 
work:
E homai ka ike, e homai ka ikaika, e 
homai ka akamai, e homai ka maopop 
o pono, e homai ka ‘ike papalua, e 
homai ka man a.
(Grant us knowledge, grant 
us strength, grant us intelligence, 
grant us righteous understanding, 
grant us visions and avenues of 
communication, grant us mana.) 
Moreover, we have been taught 
that the relationship between our 
ancestors and ourselves is one of 
interdependence—as the living, we 
have a kuleana (responsibility) to care 
for our kupuna (ancestors). In turn, our 
ancestors respond by protecting us 
on the spiritual side. Hence, one side 
cannot completely exist without the 
other.

higher among those 75 years and older than in the younger 
group. Finally, national and geographic differences are sub-
stantial. For example, in Germany more than half the sui-
cides are committed by people ages 65 and older.
In the analysis of factors associated with suicide in Ger-
many, severe physical disease, loneliness and isolation, and 
feelings of meaninglessness were identifi ed as forming a bio-
psychosocial context for late-life suicide (Schmitz-Scherzer, 
1995). In Japan, suicide rates among older adults are greater 
in rural than in urban communities. The authors of this 
research suggested that changes in Japanese society have 
led to a reduced valuing of older family members and less 
extended family support. The rural elderly are less able to 
accept these changes, which undercut their sense of purpose 
and meaning (Watanabe, Hasegawa, & Yoshinaga, 1996). 
Without appropriate social support, and in the face of sub-
stantially reduced physical or psychological resources, a sig-
nifi cant number of the very old end their own lives.
Happily, evidence on the outlook of the community-
based population of the United States suggests that relatively 
few of the elderly experience a level of discouragement that 
is implied by the sense of extinction. Among those ages 75 
and older, fewer than 6% report feelings of worthlessness or 
hopelessness all of the time, most of the time, or some of the 
time (National Center for Health Statistics, 2010).
and continuity, one experiences a great fear of extinction—a 
fear that one’s life and its end amount to nothing. Erikson’s 
advice on coping with aging concerns responding to loss and 
dealing with diminished capacities (see the box).
The following quotations from a study of very old men 
suggest the range in sentiment about immortality and extinc-
tion (Rosenfeld, 1978, p. 10). About 28% of the adults in 
the study were described as having low morale and made 
statements such as “I feel I’m a forgotten man. I don’t exist 
anymore…. I don’t feel old…. I’m just living out my life.” 
About 25% were stoic but not very positive about their con-
dition: “You know you’re getting old. You have to put your 
mind to it and take it as it comes. You can’t get out of it. Take 
it gracefully.” Almost half found their lives full and reward-
ing: “I go home with my cup overfl owing. There are so many 
opportunities to do things for people. These are the happiest 
days of my life.”
The possibility of ending one’s life with a sense of extinc-
tion is refl ected in the public health concern about suicide 
among the elderly. Data from the World Health Statistical 
Annual provide a basis for describing the incidence of suicide 
for men and women in the age groups from 65 to 74 and 
75 years and older (Kennedy & Tanenbaum, 2000). Men 
commit suicide at higher rates than women at all ages, but 
the discrepancy increases with age. Suicide rates are much

with Aging
THE ERIKSONS’ ADVICE (Erikson 
et al., 1986, pp. 332–333) suggests 
the achievement of experiential 
transcendence:
With aging, there are inevitably constant 
losses—losses of those very close, and 
friends near and far. Those who have been 
rich in intimacy also have the most to lose. 
Recollection is one form of adaptation, but 
the effort skillfully to form new relationships 
is adaptive and more rewarding. Old age 
is necessarily a time of relinquishing—of 
giving up old friends, old roles, earlier 
work that was once meaningful, and even 
possessions that belong to a previous stage 
of life and are now an impediment to the 
resiliency and freedom that seem to be 
requisite for adapting to the unknown chal-
lenges that determine the ﬁ nal stage of life.
Trust in interdependence. Give and ac-
cept help when it is needed. Old Oedipus 
well knew that the aged sometimes need 
three legs; pride can be an asset but not a 
cane. When frailty takes over, dependence 
is appropriate, and one has no choice but 
to trust in the compassion of others and be 
consistently surprised at how faithful some 
caretakers can be.
Much living, however, can teach us 
only how little is known. Accept that essen-
tial “not-knowingness” of childhood and 
with it also that playful curiosity. Growing 
old can be an interesting adventure and is 
certainly full of surprises.
One is reminded here of the image 
Hindu philosophy uses to describe the 
ﬁ nal letting go—that of merely being. The 
mother cat picks up in her mouth the kit-
ten, which completely collapses every ten-
sion and hangs limp and inﬁ nitely trusting 
in the maternal benevolence. The kitten 
responds instinctively. We human beings 
require at least a whole lifetime of practice 
to do this.

Critical Thinking Questions
 1. How do you think the elderly cope 
with the reality that many of their 
friends and relatives die while they 
survive?
 2. Given the full course of psychosocial 
development, why is it especially 
diffi cult for the elderly to accept help 
and depend upon others when they 
need it? What lessons from earlier 
stages of life might prepare a person 
to do this?
 3. How might cultural beliefs, religious 
views, and a sense of meaning 
contribute to the ability of the elderly 
to see this last phase of their life as 
an adventure?
 4. Read more about Erik Erikson. What 
can you fi nd out about how well he 
was able to accept this advice in the 
last years of his life?
 5. Critically evaluate the advice 
provided by Erikson. Do you think 
it would be good advice to give 
to older adults to help them fi nd a 
sense of satisfaction? What advice 
would you offer in its place?

have limited fi nancial resources. In order for the very old to 
transcend the limitations of their daily living situations, they 
must be convinced that they are embedded in a network of 
social relationships in which they are valued. But their value 
cannot be based solely on a physical exchange of goods and 
services. Rather, it must be founded on an appreciation of 
the person’s dignity and a history of reciprocal caring.
The Dynamics of Social Support
The benefi ts of receiving social support can be diminished if 
the recipients adhere to a strong cultural norm for reciproc-
ity. The norm of reciprocity implies that you are obligated to 
return in full value what you receive: “One good turn deserves 
another.” People want and expect to be able to give about the 
same as or more than they receive. What is given does not 
have to be identical to what is received, but it has to be per-
ceived as having equal worth. Being in someone’s debt may 
be considered stressful and shameful. In a study of Japanese 
American elderly people, receiving material support from their 
family was associated with higher levels of depression and less 
satisfaction in life, especially for those who had very tradi-
tional values about reciprocity. The general principle of trying 
to mobilize social support to enhance the functioning of the 
very old has to be modifi ed to include sensitivity to the con-
text and meaning of that support (Nemoto, 1998).
Most older adults continue to see themselves as involved 
in a reciprocal, supportive relationship with their friends. 
Feelings of usefulness and competence continue to be 
important correlates of well-being in later life. Older adults 
are especially likely to experience positive feelings of life 
The Central Process: 
Social Support
Social support has been defi ned as the social experiences 
that lead people to believe that they are cared for and loved, 
esteemed and valued, and belong to a network of communi-
cation and mutual obligation (Cobb, 1979). Social support 
is a broad term that includes the quantity and intercon-
nectedness or web of social relationships in which a per-
son is embedded, the strength of those ties, the frequency 
of contact, and the extent to which the support system is 
perceived as helpful and caring (Bergeman, Plomin, Ped-
ersen, McClearn, & Nesselroade, 1990). It is commonly 
divided into two different but complementary categories: 
socioemotional support, which refers to expressions of 
affection, respect, and esteem, and instrumental support, 
which refers to direct assistance, including help with chores, 
medical care, or transportation. Both types of social sup-
port—but especially socioemotional support—contribute 
to maintaining well-being and fostering the possibility of 
transcending the physical limitations that accompany aging 
(Rowe & Kahn, 1998).
The Benefi ts of Social Support
Social support plays a direct role in promoting health, well-
being, and life satisfaction even when a person is not facing a 
specifi c stressful situation (Gow et al., 2007). First, because 
social support involves meaningful social relationships, it 
reduces isolation. People who have intimate companions 
in later life have higher levels of life satisfaction. They feel 
valued and valuable. This kind of social support is likely to 
be most appreciated when it comes from friends and neigh-
bors—members of the community who are not bound by 
familial obligation to care about the person, but who do so 
anyway.
Second, the presence of caring, familiar people provides 
a fl ow of affection, information, advice, transportation, and 
assistance with meals and daily activities, finances, and 
health care—all critical resources. The presence of a support 
system tends to reduce the impact of stressors and protect 
people from some of their negative consequences, especially 
serious illnesses and depression (Krause, 2006).
Third, social integration and membership in a meaning-
ful social support network are associated with increased lon-
gevity. Five different longitudinal studies have demonstrated 
that a high level of social integration is associated with lower 
mortality rates (Rowe & Kahn, 1997). The support sys-
tem often serves to encourage an older person to maintain 
health care practices and to seek medical attention when 
it is needed. Members of the immediate family, close rela-
tives, and friends provide direct care during times of grave 
illness or loss, encouraging the older person to cope with dif-
fi culties and to remain hopeful. Very old people are likely 
to experience declines in physical stamina. They may also

adolescence through identifi cation with a peer group, and 
in early and middle adulthood through marriage, childrear-
ing, and relationships with coworkers and adult friends. In 
later life, family members are usually the primary sources 
of social support, especially one’s spouse, children, and sib-
lings. The quality of the relationship between an adult child 
and an aging parent has a long history. Clearly, the nature of 
the support that an aging parent is able to receive or that an 
adult child is willing to provide is infl uenced by the feelings 
of closeness and connection that were fashioned during the 
childrearing process and also by the child’s relationship to 
the parents during early adulthood years.
In the United States, age is a predictor of the size of the 
social support network. Younger people have larger social 
support networks than do older people. This may be true for 
a variety of reasons. For very old people, especially women, 
the likelihood of living alone is high. After the death of a 
spouse, men and women must realign their social support 
systems from among relationships that include their adult 
children, friends, relatives, neighbors, and new acquain-
tances in order to satisfy their needs for interaction and 
companionship. In a study of social relationships following 
widowhood, women clearly benefi ted from the social net-
work that existed prior to their husband’s death. However, 
contrary to expectations, efforts to modify this network by 
renewing old acquaintances or forming new friendships did 
not help to reduce feelings of depression or loneliness, even 
2 years after the loss (Zettel & Rook, 2004). Very old adults 
who are childless or have no surviving children or siblings 
are especially vulnerable to ending their lives in isolation. In 
contrast, those who are able to preserve a diverse social net-
work are more likely to be the healthiest, make the most use 
of appropriate community services, and experience the high-
est levels of well-being (Bosworth & Schaie, 1997; Litwin, 
1997; Antonucci et al., 2001).
For many older adults, religious participation provides an 
additional source of social support. Older adults are more 
likely than younger adults to describe themselves as reli-
gious in their beliefs and behavior. Mary, who at age 80 has 
experienced the deaths of three brothers, her husband, and 
her daughter-in-law, gives and receives emotional support 
through her faith:
I always have a lot of faith. The good Lord has always given 
me the strength to go on. I was raised to believe and pray 
when I have problems. I go to Mass every Sunday, and we 
have other special days when we go to Mass. I’m a Eucharis-
tic minister. God makes me do things to feel better—I serve 
people and God. I go to buildings to give communion to 
people who can’t get out. (Rowe & Kahn, 1998, p. 164)
The place of religion in the lives of the very old is espe-
cially signifi cant for African Americans, who are more likely 
than European Americans to attend religious services regu-
larly, even at advanced ages. They are also more likely to 
describe themselves as very religious—a characterization 
that refl ects the frequency of their private prayer, their strong 
satisfaction when they are able to provide assistance to 
others at times of signifi cant life transition or need, such as 
unemployment or the divorce of a child (Davey & Eggebeen, 
1998). Even though they are comforted by knowing that sup-
port would be available when needed, older adults are likely 
to experience negative feelings when the support received is 
more than was needed or when there is no opportunity for 
them to reciprocate (Liang, Krause, & Bennett, 2001).
Older adults may expect to receive more care from their 
children when they are ill than they can provide in exchange. 
By shifting to a life-span perspective, however, they can 
retain a sense of balance by seeing the help they receive now 
as comparable to the help they gave their children at earlier 
life stages (Ingersoll-Dayton & Antonucci, 1988). When very 
old people are highly valued, it is not as important that they 
reciprocate in the exchange of tangible resources. Wisdom, 
affection, joie de vivre, and a positive model of surviving 
into old age are intangible resources that are highly valued 
by members of the very old person’s social support network. 
Being valued may also mean that the person’s advice and 
conversation are adequate exchange for some of the services 
and assistance provided by family and friends.
Social relationships can include both positive and nega-
tive interactions. Within one’s social network, positive inter-
actions might include enjoying shared activities, confi ding 
about one’s worries, or asking for help when one is ill. Nega-
tive interactions might include being taken advantage of, 
having one’s privacy invaded, or being insulted. Sometimes, 
the same people can be sources of both positive and negative 
interactions. Not surprisingly, the overall frequency of positive 
exchanges is related to lower levels of depression. When older 
adults experience the effects of negative social interactions 
in one relationship—for example, when they have an argu-
ment with their adult child—they can buffer these emotions 
by having positive interactions with another member of their 
social network—for example, a friend or spouse (Okun & 
Keith, 1998).
Many older adults are selective about the people in their 
social network, striving to interact primarily with people 
who engage in harmonious interactions. They also take steps 
to prevent confl ict in the relationships they value. For exam-
ple, they impose certain constraints on their interactions—
not criticizing someone in public, respecting others’ privacy, 
and keeping a confidence. These strategies help to avoid 
negative interactions and maximize the satisfaction and sta-
bility of their relationships. These strategies are not a sign 
of weakness or passivity, but a deliberate attempt to protect 
meaningful relationships and avoid the negative affect asso-
ciated with interpersonal confl ict (Sorkin & Rook, 2004).
The Social Support Network
Of course, being an integral part of a social system does 
not begin in later life. It has its origins in infancy, with the 
formation of a mutual relationship with a caregiver. Social 
support systems are extended in childhood and early 

592 | 
CHAPTER 14 Elderhood (75 until Death)
Nesselroade, 1997; Krause, 2007). Older adults who feel 
they are able to engage in the activities they enjoy and to 
interact with people they value are also more likely to believe 
that they can adapt to the challenges they face. As a result of 
their confi dence, they are less disrupted by stressful events 
and more hopeful about being able to fi nd successful solu-
tions in the face of negative events (Pushkar, Arbuckle, Con-
way, Chaikelson, & Maag, 1997).
Physical health and age, per se, are not the best predictors 
of confi dence. One’s perceptions of physical health problems 
and how one sees oneself in comparison to others may be 
more important predictors of confi dence than any objective 
measure of health status. Some people view themselves as 
more impaired and dependent than they actually are; oth-
ers, who may be suffering from serious illnesses, continue 
to view their situation with optimism (Ryff, 1995). Similarly, 
one’s perception of the adequacy of social support and its 
appropriateness in response to one’s needs is more impor-
tant to a sense of confi dence than the fi nancial value of the 
resources exchanged (Davey & Eggebeen, 1998).
Over the course of the life span, psychosocial theory 
predicts that each individual will confront issues related to 
the negative poles of the psychosocial crisis of each stage. 
We argue that fi nding ways to integrate the negative pole of 
each stage into an overall positive worldview strengthens 
and humanizes one’s character. Encounters with each nega-
tive pole provide a deeper sense of empathy for the suffering 
of others and a more profound appreciation for the courage 
that it takes to live out one’s life with an open, generous, 
hopeful outlook. Confi dence emerges not because of a life of 
one success after the next, but out of a sequence of struggles 
in which creative energy is required to fi nd a positive balance 
between positive and negative forces (J.M. Erikson, 1988).
Diffi dence
Diffidence refers to an inability to act because of over-
whelming self-doubt. It is considered one of the basic fac-
tors underlying personality disorders (Livesley, Jackson, & 
Schroeder, 1992). Diffidence is evidenced by an unusual 
amount of diffi culty in making daily decisions without advice 
and reassurance from others, great reluctance in undertaking 
projects or becoming involved in activities because of lack 
of confi dence, and fears of being unable to care for oneself, 
which result in the fear of being alone (American Psychiatric 
Association, 1994).
Diffidence is likely to be associated with hopelessness. 
Among the elderly, hopelessness is experienced as a nega-
tive expectancy about the future and a sense of futility about 
having an impact on impending events. The combination 
of hopelessness and depression are strongly associated with 
suicidal ideation among the elderly (Uncapher, Gallagher-
Thompson, Osgood, & Bongar, 1998). Feelings of diffi dence 
can result from increased dependency and loss of control 
due to physical illness, loss of social support, or marked 
reduction in the quality of life; or they can be a product of a 
emotional commitment, and their reading of religious mate-
rial. Religious involvement among elderly African Americans 
is not predicted by income or education, however (Taylor, 
1986). In one study of older African American residents in 
an urban area, church membership was signifi cantly related 
to well-being, particularly as a result of the perceived sup-
port they received from other church members (Walls & 
Zarit, 1991).
Ethnic identity itself may also become an important vehicle 
for social support in later life (Cool, 1987). It can provide a 
variety of sources of nonfamilial support, from a loose net-
work of associations to membership in formal clubs and orga-
nizations. Members of an ethnic group may feel a strong sense 
of community as a result of their shared exposure to past dis-
crimination, a realization of common concerns, and a sense of 
responsibility to preserve some of the authenticity of their eth-
nic identity for future generations. Participation in such a sup-
port network may be another vehicle for contributing wisdom 
gained through life experiences to those who will follow. Inso-
far as members of ethnic groups have felt somewhat marginal 
in the larger society in the past, their mutual support in later 
life may protect them from some of the negative stereotypes 
that the society imposes on the very old.
Involvement in a social support system can be viewed 
as an essential ingredient in the achievement of a sense of 
immortality. The social support system confi rms the value 
of elders, providing direct evidence of their positive impact 
on others and a sense of embeddedness in their social 
communities. The social support system of elders usually 
includes adult children. Positive interactions with them 
contribute to the sense of living on through one’s offspring 
and their descendants. Interactions with members of the 
social support system—especially those marked by feelings 
of warmth, caring, and celebration—may be moments of 
experiential transcendence for elders. They feel the fullness 
and joy of existence that transcend physical and material 
barriers.
The Prime Adaptive Ego 
Quality and the Core 
Pathology
Confi dence
In this discussion, confi dence refers to a conscious trust in 
oneself and an assurance about the meaningfulness of life. 
In this defi nition, one fi nds the earliest psychosocial crisis 
of trust versus mistrust integrated with the crisis of integ-
rity versus despair. In elderhood, after a lifetime of facing 
challenges and experiencing losses and gains, one has a new 
belief in the validity of one’s intuition, a trust in one’s world-
view, and a continued belief in one’s capacity to participate 
in the world on one’s own terms. Confi dence is sustained by 
a stable, supportive social network (Lang, Featherman, &

among the very old to remain independent. Innovative proj-
ects were funded that provided new resources or access to 
services in the community, so that older adults with a wide 
range of needs and abilities could retain an optimal level of 
independent functioning. The National Aging in Place Coun-
cil is a forum whose mission is to encourage professionals 
and corporations in specifi c communities to work together 
to provide the system of community resources that will per-
mit older adults to remain in their homes as long as possible. 
The council provides suggestions to individuals about how 
to modify their homes to make them accessible and how 
to take advantage of community resources and services. It 
also sponsors innovative collaboration between health care, 
transportation, and corporate interests to create products 
and services that will facilitate optimal residential communi-
ties for the very old (National Aging in Place Council, 2007).
Defi ning Frailty
Frailty has typically been operationalized in terms of 
dependency. One common approach is to list any diffi cul-
ties in the ADLs, including bathing, dressing, transferring 
from the bed to a chair, using the toilet, and eating. Some-
times, these assessments include walking a short distance 
because this degree of motor ability is usually required to 
function independently. Beyond these basic types of self-
care, an expanded notion of dependency refers to diffi cul-
ties in managing instrumental activities of daily living 
(IADLs), such as shopping, preparing meals, doing light 
housework, using transportation, or using the telephone. 
These tasks, though clearly more complex than the basic 
ADLs, are essential to maintaining one’s daily life without 
continuous process of ego pathology, building on the nega-
tive resolutions of earlier psychosocial crises. It is clear that 
in later life, the courage and energy required to remain fl ex-
ible and adaptive to change must be derived from the well of 
ego resources established over the life course. For some of 
the very old, this precious resource is missing, and they face 
the end of life in a state of passivity and doubt.
APPLIED TOPIC
Meeting the Needs of 
the Frail Elderly
Objective 6. To apply research and theory to concerns 
about meeting the needs of the frail elderly.
THE GOAL OF providing services or community resources 
to the frail elderly should be to enhance a realistic level of 
performance. On the one hand, one should not try to encour-
age 80-year-olds to live the lives of teenagers or people in 
their fi fties. On the other hand, one should not hold such 
minimal expectations for the elderly that they are robbed of 
their autonomy and ability to meet challenges or to strive 
toward achievable goals. One of the current issues that has 
become a focus of research and policy debate is the extent 
to which physical frailty in elderhood is treatable or prevent-
able, and how to reduce dependency, especially in long-term 
nursing care.
In 2004, the U.S. Administration on Aging announced 
a new initiative focused on supporting “Seniors Aging in 
Place” (ageinplace.org) in response to the strong preference

CHAPTER 14 Elderhood (75 until Death)
that help very old adults sustain their independence or over-
react to their physical or intellectual limitations. This ten-
dency, however, is observed in the responses of some adult 
children to their aging parents. Once the children realize 
that their parents are not functioning at the same high level 
of competence that they enjoyed previously, the children 
move toward a role reversal. The children may infantilize or 
dominate their parents, insisting on taking over all fi nancial 
matters or attempting to relocate their parents to a more pro-
tective housing arrangement. Gradually, some children take 
away all their parents’ decision-making responsibilities.
Although children may view such actions as being in their 
parents’ best interests, they may fail to take their parents’ 
preferences into account. For example, adult children tend 
to overemphasize the importance of health and financial 
considerations for their parents and to overlook the signifi -
cance of familiar housing in preserving the companionship 
and daily support that are critical to their parents’ sense of 
well-being (Kahana, 1982). Adult children may also fail to 
realize how important decision-making tasks and respon-
sibility for personal care are to the maintenance of their 
parents’ personality structure. In mutually satisfying rela-
tionships between adult daughters and their aging mothers, 
the daughters made sure that their mothers were consistently 
involved in decisions that affected their lives, even when the 
mothers were heavily dependent on their daughters for daily 
care (Pratt, Jones, Shin, & Walker, 1989).
In many nursing homes, there is a similar tendency to 
reduce or eliminate expectations of autonomy by failing to 
give residents responsibilities for planning or performing the 
activities of daily life. Routine chores such as cooking, clean-
ing, shopping for groceries, doing laundry, planning meals, 
answering the phone, paying bills, and writing letters all 
give older adults the sense that life is going along as usual. 
Replacing these responsibilities with unstructured time may 
subject very old people to more stress than continuing to 
expect some forms of regular contribution to daily life. Thus, 
paid work assignments and structured daily responsibilities 
are activities that an institutional setting can provide to help 
maintain a high level of social and intellectual functioning 
among the residents. The Eden Alternative is an emerging 
concept in nursing home care that gives residents respon-
sibilities for some aspect of their environment, depending 
on their level of functioning. These responsibilities—such as 
watering plants, volunteering in a nearby child care center, 
or reading to other residents—help overcome the negative 
impact of dependency and institutionalization (Hooyman & 
Kiyak, 2002).
Supporting the optimal functioning of frail elderly peo-
ple requires an individualized approach. Each person has a 
unique profi le of competencies and limitations. For some, 
the physical environment presents the greatest barriers to 
optimal functioning. For example, older adults who are in 
a wheelchair are likely to experience a fall every so often. 
However, those who have installed modifications in their 
home—including widened doorways and halls, railings, and 
dependence on informal or formal community support ser-
vices (Guralnik & Simonsick, 1993).
Dependency or difficulty in managing ADLs increases 
markedly after age 85. Many factors combine to produce this 
dependency. In most postindustrial societies, later adulthood 
is characterized by a sedentary lifestyle. Estimates suggest 
that only about 10% of older adults are active enough to sus-
tain appropriate levels of muscle strength and cardiovascu-
lar capacity. Weakness resulting from disuse combines with 
certain biological changes, diseases, medications, and mal-
nutrition to produce muscle atrophy, risk of falling, reduced 
arousal and cognitive capacity, and a gradual decline in con-
fi dence in being able to cope with even moderate types of 
physical exertion.
Measures of functional limitations often fail to differ-
entiate between what people say they might be able to do 
in a hypothetical context (when completing a survey) and 
what they actually do in their day-to-day lives. For exam-
ple, some people may respond to a questionnaire saying 
that they are able to walk half a mile without help, but they 
do not actually ever walk that much. Others may respond 
that they cannot walk half a mile without help, but in fact 
they walk several blocks on most days to go to the store near 
their home. When observed in their natural setting, many 
older adults use compensatory strategies to overcome some 
physical impairment or integrate the support of others so 
that they can enact certain functions even though they have 
serious disabilities. For example, in a sample of women who 
needed assistance in more than three areas of daily living, 
more than one fourth still managed to get to church services 
once a week or more. They did not allow their physical limi-
tations to restrict their role involvement (Idler, 1987; Glass, 
1998).
For many older adults, problems with remaining inde-
pendent change from time to time. In the winter, when 
streets are icy and the weather is cold, a person may 
need more help because it is difficult to walk outside or 
to wait for the bus. In the event of an acute illness requir-
ing a period of hospitalization, a person may temporarily 
need support during the posthospital recovery but does 
not require long-term institutionalization. Full recovery 
from a week or two of being bedridden may require addi-
tional physical therapy, rebuilding muscle tone and endur-
ance, and rebuilding confi dence in managing daily tasks. 
The outcome for the older person depends on the patient, 
caregiver, and health care system—all sharing expectations 
for recovery and rehabilitation rather than viewing the per-
son as permanently weakened and destined for prolonged 
dependency (Schulz & Williamson, 1993).
Supporting Optimal Functioning
Optimal functioning is what a person is capable of doing 
when motivated and well prepared. To support optimal func-
tioning of elderly people, one must accurately assess their 
limitations. One does not want to take away the supports

on the sidewalk so as not to annoy your fellow walkers” 
(Thompson, 2007, p. 31). Living in areas that are densely 
populated means access to more markets, specialty shops, 
and interesting things to do in walking distance. People in 
New York City are more likely to walk a mile to get to some-
thing than people who live in suburban or rural areas. In 
a shift from earlier views of cities as crime-ridden, disease-
promoting, alienating environments, some social scientists 
are starting to write about urban health advantages. Friend-
ship groups are likely to form in neighborhoods; big cities 
may have bigger, more fully equipped hospitals; and pop-
ulation density can attract more parks, gyms, and recre-
ational facilities. The causal relationship between urban life 
and health is probably bidirectional. As cities become safer, 
people with more resources (who generally have greater 
longevity) want to live there, attracting more of the lifestyle 
resources that support health.
For some elderly adults, the absence of meaningful inter-
personal relationships is the greatest barrier to optimal 
functioning. The role of the informal social support system 
in meeting the needs of the frail elderly cannot be under-
estimated. Children, spouses, other relatives, and neighbors 
are all important sources of help. Within communities, the 
elderly are themselves likely to provide signifi cant help to 
age-mates who may be ill, bereaved, or impaired in some 
way. Most older adults prefer not to have to ask for help. 
However, they are much better off if they have someone to 
turn to than if they have no one.
Beyond personal networks of social support, communi-
ties have been characterized by different levels of collective 
efficacy, which combines a strong sense of social cohe-
sion with a high level of informal social control (Sampson, 
Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997). People who live in communi-
ties characterized by high collective effi cacy are willing to 
take on important community concerns and to intervene on 
each other’s behalf even if they do not know one another on 
a personal level. Examples of the impact of collective effi cacy 
include reducing violent victimization, child or elder abuse, 
and illicit drug traffi cking in a neighborhood. Communities 
that are high in collective efficacy will act to draw on the 
required resources to attract health care services, create new 
recreational settings, and improve transportation resources. 
In all these ways, communities characterized by collective 
effi cacy can enhance the health and optimal functioning of 
the frail elderly (Browning & Cagney, 2003).
The Role of Creative Action
People can do a lot for themselves to promote a fulfi lling later 
life. By identifying meaningful goals and coordinating action 
to achieve these goals, older adults can create lives that are 
both meaningful and manageable (Riediger, Freund, & 
Baltes, 2005). Very old adults can alter the structure of their 
environment to preserve optimal functioning and enhance 
their sense of well-being. They may move to a warmer cli-
mate, to a homogeneous-age community, or to a more 
easy-open doors—are less likely to fall than those whose 
homes have not been modifi ed (Berg, Hines, & Allen, 2002). 
A person who cannot walk without fear of falling, see well, 
or grasp objects because of arthritis may need to have modi-
fi cations in the home that will compensate for these limita-
tions. Many creative strategies have been introduced that 
permit people with serious physical disabilities to retain an 
optimal level of autonomy in their homes.
The Role of the Community
Interventions at the community level may be necessary to 
meet the safety, health, and social needs of some older adults 
who want to remain in their communities. It is important for 
resources to be accessible. In promoting optimal function-
ing in urban settings, for example, it is important to provide 
health care settings that are more easily accessible for elderly 
people with limited mobility. Andrulis (2000) has taken this 
point of view one step further by arguing that as the number 
of elderly people in the urban centers of the United States 
increases, health care organizations and providers supported 
by local, state, and federal governments must be prepared 
to reach out to the growing population of elderly people. 
Many of these people are poor, have physical limitations, and 
experience psychological barriers such as perceived threat 
of violence, confusion, fear, and embarrassment over lack 
of financial resources. As a result, they may be unable or 
unwilling to leave their immediate environment. Community 
outreach would have to provide a wide variety of services 
to a culturally diverse population with special attention to 
poverty-related concerns.
In one community intervention service in New Haven, 
Connecticut, called LIFE (Learning Informally From the 
Elderly), community professionals charged with providing 
services to the frail elderly organized interviews and commu-
nity meetings with them to learn what challenges they were 
facing in trying to remain as independent as possible in their 
neighborhood (Pallett-Hehn & Lucas, 1994). The profes-
sionals were surprised to fi nd that the older adults brought 
safety concerns to the fore as a primary issue and that health 
and service concerns were secondary. In order to preserve 
and continue the dialogue, the professionals fostered the cre-
ation of Elder Forums—neighborhood groups where older 
adults discuss their mutual concerns and possible solutions. 
Each month, representatives from the Elder Forums come 
together in an assembly with professionals and policymak-
ers to raise concerns that have been discussed in the Elder 
Forums and to identify community resources or changes in 
policy and procedures for addressing these concerns.
In a surprising essay, Clive Thompson (2007) wrote about 
the features of life in New York City that contribute to lon-
gevity. A major theme was the role of walking and climbing 
stairs as aspects of daily life in the city. “Driving in the city 
is maddening, pushing us onto the sidewalks and up and 
down the stairs to the subways. What’s more, our social con-
tract dictates that you should move your ass when you’re

able to maintain a sense of control over the role that is most 
important to them (Krause & Shaw, 2000). As at earlier ages, 
elders make certain choices that direct the course of their 
lives, provide a sense of meaning, and infl uence their overall 
level of adjustment.
In summary, the quality of life for the frail elderly 
depends on four factors: (1) the specifi c nature and timing 
of the health-related limitations that accompany aging; (2) 
the availability of appropriate resources within the home, 
family, and community to help compensate for or minimize 
these limitations; (3) the selective emphasis that the person 
gives to some life experiences over others as being central to 
well-being; and (4) the person’s motivational orientation to 
continue to fi nd creative strategies to adapt to change.
modest home or apartment that entails fewer maintenance 
responsibilities. They may participate in exercise classes or 
other guided physical activity to improve their strength, 
endurance, and fl exibility. Elders may select some family and 
friendship relationships that they sustain through frequent 
interaction, mutual help giving, and shared activities. They 
may participate in activities in community settings, includ-
ing churches, senior centers, libraries, and volunteer orga-
nizations, through which they retain a sense of purpose and 
social connection. For example, 21% of people ages 75 and 
older participate in some form of charity work (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2007). They may decide to focus their interest on a 
single remaining role that is most important to them. One 
study has found that older people may live longer if they are

Chapter Summary
Objective 1. To identify elderhood as a unique develop-
mental period for those of unusual longevity—a stage 
with its own developmental tasks and psychosocial crisis.
Elderhood is a period of new challenges and opportuni-
ties that will be faced by an increasing number of people in 
the years ahead. Those who are 80 years old and older are 
the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. Having 
reached a sense of acceptance of one’s death, the task is to 
fi nd meaning and enjoyment in the bonus years of life. This 
requires ongoing adaptation to changing physical and cogni-
tive capacities, a deepening sense of time and the place of 
one’s life in the history of one’s people, and a willingness to 
fi nd new and fl exible solutions to the demands of daily life. 
This period of life requires ongoing adaptive self-organization.
In attempting to describe the psychosocial development 
of the very old, we are drawn to concepts that have a strong 
non-Western philosophical fl avor. We have introduced such 
concepts as psychohistorical perspective, experiential tran-
scendence, immortality, and social support—themes that 
refl ect the need to assume a long-range perspective on life 
and its meaning.
Objective 2. To describe some of the physical 
changes associated with aging, including changes 

 
Chapter Summary | 597
in fitness, behavioral slowing, sensory changes, 
and vulnerability to illness, and the challenges that 
these changes pose for continued psychosocial well-
being.
The quality of daily life for the very old is infl uenced to 
a great extent by their physical health. For some, daily 
activities are restricted by one or more chronic diseases. 
Nevertheless, the majority of elders continue to live in 
their own households and perform tasks of daily living 
independently.
Objective 3. To develop the concept of an altered 
perspective on time and history that emerges among the 
long-lived.
The concept of time changes with advanced age, so that the 
continuity of past, present, and future becomes clearer.
Objective 4. To explore elements of the lifestyle 
structure in elderhood, especially living arrangements 
and gender roles.
An increasingly wide range of lifestyle alternatives are being 
invented in elderhood, including opportunities for travel, 
housing that provides varying levels of care, and patterns 
of close relationships in which traditional gender roles are 
modified to take into consideration new capacities and 
interests.
Objective 5. To identify and describe the psychosocial 
crisis of immortality versus extinction, the central process 
of social support, the prime adaptive ego quality of 
confi dence, and the core pathology of diffi dence.
Having lived well beyond their life expectancy, elders face the 
psychosocial crisis of immortality versus extinction. A key to 
their quality of life lies in whether they are integrated into effec-
tive social support networks. Social support provides help, 
resources, meaningful social interaction, and a psychological 
sense of being valued. Elders who survive within a support 
system can transcend the limitations of their mortality, fi nding 
comfort and continuity in their participation in a chain of lov-
ing relationships. Those who are isolated, however, are more 
likely to face the end of their lives bound to the tedium of strug-
gling with their physical limitations and resenting their survival.
Objective 6. To apply research and theory to concerns 
about meeting the needs of the frail elderly.
The topic of the care of the frail elderly illustrates the rel-
evance of a psychosocial framework. The resources and 
services available in the community can support optimal 
functioning. Children, grandchildren, and other family 
members need to be able to interpret the needs of their aging 
parents without underestimating their capacity or resilience. 
Finally, older adults can guide the direction of their care by 
the decisions they make, both in earlier periods of life and as 
they detect new signs of frailty.

Further Reflection
 1. Imagine that you are now 85 years old. What kind of life 
do you hope to be living? What kinds of changes or modi-
fi cations do you envision having to make from the period 
of your fi fties and sixties in order to adapt in elderhood?
 2. What is a psychohistorical perspective? What insights 
might come along with living a very long time?
 3. The majority of the elderly are women. What are some 
implications of this for social policy and community 
development?
 4. How would you describe the difference in the major 
challenges and areas for new growth between later adult-
hood and elderhood?
 5. In what ways may the experiences of those who are 
elders today differ from those who will reach elderhood 
50 years from now (those who are 25–30 today)?
 6. Refl ecting on your study of human development, what 
are the salient factors that promote optimal functioning 
at each stage of life?

CHAPTER 15 Understanding Death, Dying, and Bereavement
LIKE BOOKENDS, BIRTH and death bracket the story of 
development. Birth is preceded by a long chain of bio-
logical transformations, in which the biochemical thread 
of DNA is passed from generation to generation. Preg-
nancy and birth occur in a psychosocial context of rela-
tionships, resources, and cultural beliefs and practices 
(see Chapter  4, The Period of Pregnancy and Prenatal 
Development). So, too, it is with death: The biological 
process of dying takes place in a psychosocial context 
of relationships, resources, and cultural beliefs and prac-
tices. As the psychosocial concept of immortality implies, 
death is accompanied by a series of transformations at 
the biological, psychological, and societal levels. It is the 
role of culture and religion to provide a narrative or ex-
planation for the transformations of energy that occur in 
death. Because we cannot empirically test many of these 
explanations, it is the role of the ego to cope with the 
unknown aspects of death, to give it personal meaning.
Death is at once a certainty, in that all living things die, 
and a random event, in that the timing of death is un-
known. We know for sure that we will die, but when and 
how are not known. Moreover, whereas through obser-
vation, systematic study, and the transmission of knowl-
edge from generation to generation, we have a good 
idea about the trajectory of development beginning with 
the prenatal period until death, we have only specula-
tions and belief systems to guide our understanding of 
what occurs at death and beyond. Thus, death is both 
inevitable and unknowable.
Thanatology is the fi eld of science that addresses dy-
ing, death, and the psychological mechanisms of coping 
with them. This fi eld includes an analysis of the attitudes 
toward dying, the meaning of death for individuals and 
societies, the rituals and practices associated with death, 
the bereavement process, and the expressions of be-
reavement across situations and cultures. ■

dying and the modern ideal of a good death.
 4. To describe death-related rituals and their 
functions.

Objective 1. To understand the role of mortality in 
shaping psychosocial development.
Psychosocial development focuses on the ongoing interac-
tions between the person and the environment. The person’s 
ability to understand the self and others matures and changes 
with each psychosocial crisis. At each stage of life, the ego is 
shaped by the perplexing nature of mortality. In infancy, as 
one achieves a balance between trust and mistrust, an out-
look of hopefulness emerges. This outlook shapes one’s ori-
entation toward risk, transitions, and ultimately death. If one 
has lived a life of hopefulness about the future, this same 
orientation is likely to extend toward one’s beliefs about 
death—a sense that whatever follows the death of the physi-
cal body is going to be good.
In the resolution of the crisis of identity versus role confu-
sion, one confronts the need to impose a sense of meaning 
on one’s life: Where am I going? What do I want out of life? 
What is my path? Even though one may believe that death is 
far off in the distant future, the creation of a personal identity 
refl ects an understanding that one’s life is fi nite; one’s choices 
should count for something.
The crisis of generativity versus stagnation brings the issue 
of mortality even more to center stage. Here, one begins to 
consider the impact of one’s life on future generations: What 
can I do to contribute to the quality of life for others, even 
after my death? How can I use my resources, talents, and 
creative abilities to ensure a good future for those who come 
after me? While still in the throes of caring for children, 
aging parents, colleagues, and communities, the generative 
action of middle adults suggests a concern for a time when 
the ego is not present to nurture and maintain.
Developing a point of view about death is a major devel-
opmental task during later adulthood. The resolution of the 
crisis of integrity versus despair requires recognition that

knowledge that they were dying. Once people became ter-
minally ill, they were deprived of the right to have a voice 
in decisions related to their treatment and the conditions 
 surrounding the end of life (Kastenbaum, 2009).
Beginning with the works of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross 
(1969, 1983), the needs of the dying person were given a 
voice again. Concern about allowing people to talk about 
their fears, to plan for their funeral, and to bring closure to 
their personal affairs led people to face death more openly 
and directly. This approach also led to new ways of thinking 
about the care of the dying. Currently, we have new tech-
nologies that allow for the prolongation of life, but are still 
caught in confl icts about how long and under what condi-
tions we should sustain life.
Defi nitions of Death
Objective 2. To defi ne the biological state of death.
The defi nition of death has changed. Historically, the criteria 
for death were lack of a heartbeat and lack of respiration, 
called cardiopulmonary death. This definition was used 
for hundreds of years. In 1981, the President’s Commission 
for the Ethical Study of Problems in Medicine and Biomedi-
cal and Behavioral Research identifi ed eight criteria for the 
determination of whole-brain death:
 1. No spontaneous movement in response to any stimuli
 2. No spontaneous respirations for at least 1 hour
death is increasingly imminent. Integrity is achieved on the 
shoulders of earlier ego strengths that allow the person to 
celebrate personal achievements, cherish meaningful rela-
tionships, and look with satisfaction at the life thus far lived. 
The integrity expressed by those in later adulthood—an 
ability to celebrate life in the face of impending death—is a 
model for younger generations.
Finally, the crisis of immortality versus extinction brings 
the confi dence of continuity. One is ready—though not nec-
essarily eager—to close one door, confi dent that another will 
open. In this period, the possibility of death cannot dampen 
the joy of being and the certainty that one’s life is intimately 
connected with all life.
Over time, direct personal experiences with dying and 
death have changed. One hundred years ago, most people 
died in their homes. Many women and infants died in child-
birth. As a result, death was experienced by family members 
who cared for the dying and were present at the death. As 
you travel through New England, it is common to fi nd small 
cemeteries near churches and homes, where you sense the 
intimate gathering of families who buried their dead nearby.
With the growth of modern medicine, people who were 
very ill were taken to hospitals. Those who were dying were 
removed from the home, and death occurred more in hospi-
tals or nursing homes. Death was sanitized through embalm-
ing practices. A culture of death as medical failure emerged, 
leaving people increasingly alienated from the realities of 
dying. The discussion of topics related to death and dying 
became taboo. Children were shielded from experiences 
with death. Doctors often tried to protect people from the 
In older communities it is com-
mon to fi nd small family ceme-
teries where people are buried 
near their home or farmland. 
These cemeteries suggest a 
time when there was a greater 
intimacy between the living 
and their ancestors.

CHAPTER 15 Understanding Death, Dying, and Bereavement
everything possible to keep the person alive. It is possible to 
register a living will online at www.uslivingwillregistry.com.
The following quotation describes the benefi t that accom-
panied a woman’s decision to register her advanced directive 
with the U.S. Living Will Registry:
I am very glad I registered my advanced directive. As care-
giver to my mother, my father, and my stepmother I can-
not express the peace of mind that registering gives. My 
husband and daughter will never go through the stress of 
wondering if they are acting according to my wishes. It will 
be very clear for them. In a way, making my advanced direc-
tive is protecting my husband and daughter, even when I am 
seriously ill. When a loved one is seriously ill is the worst 
possible time to deal with the subtleties and ramifi cations of 
hospital and legal bureaucracies. This will free them from a 
lot of those worries. (U.S. Living Will Registry, 2010)
One of the more troubling health conditions is Alzheim-
er’s disease, in which there is a gradual loss of mental com-
petence, so that a decision must be made about when the 
person is no longer competent and the living will or dura-
ble power of attorney will go into effect. The preparation of 
advance directives requires that people think about the kind 
of care they want to receive and the conditions under which 
they want treatment to be withheld. Currently, most Ameri-
cans do not complete advance directives, and many inter-
ventions that are designed to increase completion of advance 
directives are not effective (Kersting, 2004; Jezewski, Meeker, 
Sessana, & Finnell, 2007). Even though it is recommended 
that people consider these issues while they are fl ourishing, 
the fact remains that it seems to be diffi cult for people to face 
these issues and make decisions about their death.
The Process of Dying
Objective 3. To describe factors associated with the 
process of dying and the modern ideal of a good death.
People can experience death in many different ways. Their 
psychological coping strategies differ depending on the con-
ditions of the experience. In Chapter 13 (Later Adulthood), 
we described Kübler-Ross’ concept of stages in coming to 
terms with one’s death: denial, anger and resentment, bar-
gaining, depression and mourning one’s death, and accep-
tance. Although these emotional reactions are all important 
aspects of understanding how people may cope with the 
reality of their death, the differences in the conditions of 
death mean that this stage process is not likely to be experi-
enced universally.
Confronting One’s Death
In contrast to the notion of stages, some people write about 
the dying trajectory (Lawton, 2001)—that is, the time 
 3. Total lack of responsiveness to even the most painful stimuli
 4. No eye movements, blinking, or pupil responses
 5. No postural activity, swallowing, yawning, or vocalizing
 6. No motor refl exes
 7. A fl at electroencephalogram (EEG) for at least 10 minutes
 8. No change in any of these criteria when they are tested 
again 24 hours later
In addition to these eight criteria, certain other condi-
tions, such as deep coma, have to be ruled out. Two areas in 
the brain control different types of life functions: the brain-
stem controls heartbeat and respiration, and the cortex con-
trols sensory integration and cognitive function. It is possible 
for a person’s brainstem functions to continue even when 
there is no cortical functioning. This condition is called 
 persistent vegetative state. If you refer back to the list of 
eight criteria, you can see that the person in this state is not 
technically dead. When this state occurs, family members, 
doctors, and sometimes the courts are faced with the diffi cult 
decision about whether to let the person die.
In response to the report of the President’s Commission, 
Congress passed the Uniform Determination of Death Act 
(UDDA). All 50 states and the District of Columbia recog-
nize whole-brain death as the one legal standard. However, 
the UDDA allows physicians or hospitals to apply the cardio-
pulmonary defi nition or the whole-brain death defi nition, 
whichever applies fi rst. On the one hand, because of the great 
need for transplantable organs, there is urgency in deciding 
whether or not a person has died. On the other hand, it is 
not legal to remove an organ when that removal would cause 
a person’s death. Therefore, the decision whether to harvest 
organs from people who are experiencing whole-brain death 
poses a diffi cult ethical question (DeGrazia, 1998).
Advance Directives
Because there are a variety of technologies that can extend 
life when a person is no longer able to communicate, it is 
recommended that adults prepare some form of advance 
directive, such as a living will or durable power of attorney 
(Doukas & Reichel, 2007). These documents can inform a 
physician or hospital as to a person’s wishes about life-sus-
taining procedures in the face of terminal illness or imminent 
death and designate someone to act on one’s behalf. Through 
a living will, a person can direct physicians or a hospital 
to withhold life-sustaining procedures and prevent the use 
of unwanted medical measures when that person is unable 
to convey those wishes. Some older people wear bracelets 
that say, “living will—do not resuscitate (DNR).” The durable 
power of attorney authorizes someone to act on behalf of 
the person regarding financial and property matters and 
health care decisions. This directive can go into effect when 
either the agreement is signed or the disability occurs (Hooy-
man & Kiyak, 1993). One benefi t of the living will is that 
it helps resolve potential confl icts between a dying person’s 
wishes and family members’ feelings of obligation to do 

 
The Process of Dying | 605
to think I could actually outlive my parents. I am further set 
adrift by the sudden death of the crazy German doctor who 
nursed me with pea soup and sausages when I refused to go 
to the hospital with pneumonia. My thoughts race by, but I 
manage to grab them and take a look. I fi nd that I’m bon-
kers but rational. I know what’s bothering me; my plan to die 
young hasn’t worked out. What do I do now? My thoughts 
take on the structure of a song with a repeated chorus; it’s 
too late to die young.
I decide to embrace the death sentence. No need to fear 
it; no need to hasten it. Mortality is something all people 
share, a unifying force. Every life, whether long or short, is a 
treasure of infi nite value. These things are true, I fi gure, and 
it’s my job to say so. When I die, I might as well die honest.

CRITICAL THINKING AND CASE ANALYSIS
 1. What are the challenges of facing an ambiguous dying 
 trajectory? For the dying person? For close relatives?
 2. What are some of the possible reasons for Harriet’s 
 depression at age 30?
 3. According to psychosocial theory, what are some of the 
life themes that Harriet is facing at age 4? At age 30?
 4. How might her psychosocial development be affected by 
her illness at age 4 and age 30? By her sense of herself as 
someone who is dying?
 5. What are some of Harriet’s coping strengths? Weaknesses?
 6. If you were Harriet’s parents, what would you do to try to 
prepare Harriet for her life? For her death?
The dying process may bring a high degree of suffering, 
including shortness of breath, inability to eat, limited mobil-
ity, and pain. In some instances, this suffering can be alle-
viated with medications, but in some cases it grows worse. 
Health care providers and family members often express 
great dissatisfaction with these end-of-life conditions for the 
dying person and the surviving loved ones.
Finally, the dying process may be conceptualized in different 
ways depending on the age of the dying person. The primary 
cause of death differs for people of various age groups, thus cre-
ating different contexts for dying. Children and adolescents are 
most likely to die of accidents including injuries due to fi re and 
auto accidents, or abuse. In middle adulthood, cancer, heart 
disease, and AIDS are common causes of death, along with 
accidents and homicide. Older adults are most likely to die of 
the complications from chronic diseases, such as heart disease, 
diabetes, pneumonia, or cancer (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010).
People of different ages have differing cognitive abilities, 
psychological coping mechanisms, and views of the future 
that they bring to the tasks of preparing for death. Kübler-
Ross reported the following poem that was written by Mike, 
a teenage boy, to his parents on the day of his death:
The time has come,
My job is done.
Now it’s time for another one
during which the person’s health goes from good to death. 
Certain illnesses such as some cancers or AIDS result in a 
gradual decline. Under these conditions, people have more 
time to acknowledge their death and to plan for it. They may 
be asked to make a number of decisions about their treat-
ment, in each case weighing the risks or side effects of treat-
ment against the chances of prolonging life. Some people 
experience unpredictable, sudden death in the midst of a 
healthy life, as in an automobile accident, by homicide, or 
by a heart attack. This trajectory does not allow the person 
to confront the reality of death. For some, death involves an 
ambiguous decline, in which periods of illness may alternate 
with periods of remission, as in the case of leukemia or mus-
cular dystrophy. For these people, there is a complex process 
of learning to live with a terminal disease, in which there 
may be periods of health as well as periods of decline. In 
this scenario, the person may wrestle with the question of 
whether they are dying from the illness or living with the ill-
ness. The case study of Harriet McBryde Johnson illustrates 
the complex process of making meaning in the face of an 
ambiguous trajectory.
CASE STUDY
TOO LATE TO DIE YOUNG
Harriet McBryde Johnson was diagnosed with muscular dys-
trophy as a little girl. She has faced a life of surviving the 
expectation that she would die young.
I’m 3 or 4 years old. I’m sitting on the living room fl oor, play-
ing with dolls. I look up at the TV and see a little boy. He’s 
sitting on the fl oor, playing with toy soldiers. Then he’s in 
Little League; he stumbles on his way to fi rst base. He visits 
a doctor. His parents are sad. He’s in a wheelchair. Then a 
bed. Then I see the toy soldiers. No boy. An unseen narrator 
says, “Little Billy’s toy soldiers have lost their general.” It’s a 
commercial for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. As the 
narrator makes the pitch, a realization comes to me: I will die.
Is it really one of my earliest memories? Or was it manu-
factured by my imagination? I don’t suppose it matters. Ei-
ther way, it was my truth. I’m a little girl who knows she will 
die, but I don’t say anything. Somehow my mother guesses. 
“That boy,” she says, “has a different kind of muscular dystro-
phy. Girls don’t get it.” Maybe, I think, but he looks a lot like 
me. And pretty soon I see little girls on the telethon and hear 
that girls too have “killer diseases.” I don’t know the word, 
but I fi gure my mother is in denial.
By the time I am 5, I think of myself as a dying child. I’ve 
been sick a lot. There is some discussion before my parents 
decide to send me to kindergarten. I am glad they do. When 
I die, I think, I might as well die a kindergartner.
I’ve just turned 30. I’ve been lolling in bed for nearly 
3  weeks; I say I’ve strained my neck, but really it’s major 
depression. Just before my birthday my mother had brain 
surgery. She’s come through it beautifully, but I’m terrifi ed

CHAPTER 15 Understanding Death, Dying, and Bereavement
• To know when death is coming, and to understand what 
can be expected
• To be able to retain control of what happens
• To be afforded dignity and privacy
• To have control over pain relief and other symptom control
• To have choice and control over where death occurs (at 
home or elsewhere)
• To have access to information and expertise of whatever 
kind is necessary
• To have access to any spiritual or emotional support required
• To have access to hospice care in any location, not only in 
the hospital
• To have control over who is present and who shares the end
• To be able to issue advanced directives, which ensure 
wishes are respected
• To have time to say good-bye, and control over other 
aspects of timing
• To be able to leave when it is time to go, and not to have 
life prolonged pointlessly
Research on perspectives about dying fi nd that the defi -
nition of a good death is highly individual, shaped by the 
context of dying and changing over the course of the illness. 
In a research project (Carr, 2003), the ideals of a good death 
were studied by asking recent widows and widowers to rate 
their spouses’ end-of-life experiences along the following 
dimensions:
• Spouse was at peace with the idea of dying
• Spouse was aware of the impending death
• Respondent and spouse discussed the death
• Respondent was with spouse at the moment of death
• Spouse led a full life
• Spouse was not in pain
• Spouse did not receive negligent care
These dimensions represent concrete evidence of what 
people perceive to be a good death. Of all these features, the 
greatest psychological distress for the survivor was associ-
ated with seeing the spouse in great pain at the end of life. 
Although roughly 70% of Americans say they would prefer 
to die at home, about 75% actually die in a hospital, many 
undergoing painful medical interventions in attempts to pro-
long life (Cloud, 2000).
In a study of what patients, family members, and their 
health care professionals were concerned about in prepar-
ing for the end of life, the following issues were highlighted: 
naming someone to make decisions, knowing what to expect 
about one’s physical condition, having one’s fi nancial affairs 
in order, having one’s treatment preferences in writing, and 
knowing that one’s physician is comfortable talking about 
death. Dying patients were also concerned about planning 
their funeral (Steinhauser et al., 2001).
How well are people’s needs being met at the end of their 
lives? Researchers attempted to address this question through 
a telephone interview with family members or close associ-
ates of more than 1,500 people who had died in the previous 
The gates will open, open soon
I now will go.
See you soon.
Time, time will never stop
Everlasting time
Love is eternal
Forevermore love
I will always love you. (cited in Kübler-Ross, 1983, p. 189)
Because of the nature of his illness, Mike had time to pre-
pare for his death. His mother reports that he taped messages 
to his family and friends, helped plan his funeral, and gave 
a few things away before he died. At this age, Mike appears 
to have a hopeful view about an everlasting life. He is able to 
conceptualize dying as a transition that allows some continu-
ity between the life he had and the life he is going to have. 
He also sees a future in which he will be reunited with the 
other loved ones in his life before too long. Another teen-
ager, John, who was terminally ill, stated that before he died 
he wanted two things: to own a van and to make love to a 
woman (Kübler-Ross, 1983, p. 184). Here we see a youthful 
approach to the dying process. John’s goals are more fun lov-
ing and pragmatic, whereas Mike’s approach is more spiritual 
and interpersonal.
Ray Bradbury provided a portrait of a great-grandmother’s 
approach to her own death. At 90, Great-Grandma told her 
children and grandchildren:
I don’t want any Halloween parties here tomorrow. Don’t 
want anyone saying anything sweet about me; I said it all in 
my time and my pride. I’ve tasted every victual and danced 
every dance; now there’s one last tart I haven’t bit on, one 
tune I haven’t whistled. But I’m not afraid. I’m truly curious. 
Death won’t get a crumb by my mouth I won’t keep and 
savor. So don’t you worry over me. Now, all of you go, and 
let me fi nd my sleep. (Bradbury, 1957/1964, pp. 140–141)
In this case, Great-Grandma reassures her children that she 
is ready—that she has experienced a full life and sees death 
as the next dance. In addition to the way death is perceived 
by the dying, the death will be perceived and conceptualized 
differently by caregivers. The death of a child or adolescent 
may be seen as quite tragic in the minds and hearts of parents 
and friends; the death of an older person may be seen as the 
natural close to a full life. In some cultures, the death of an 
elder is especially painful, as it results in the loss of wisdom 
and guidance for younger generations. In other cultures, the 
death of a child is especially tragic, because it results in the 
loss of promise and potential for the future.
The Good Death
Professionals who are responsible for the care of the dying 
have begun to defi ne the characteristics of a good death or 
dying well (Webb, 1997; Emanuel & Emanuel, 1998; Kehl, 
2006). The results of one British study group offered the fol-
lowing 12 principles of a good death (Smith, 2000):

 
The Process of Dying | 607
• Offer a support system to help patients live as actively as 
possible until death
• Help the family cope during the patient’s illness and their 
own bereavement
Hospice care differs from traditional hospital care in that 
the focus is on enhancing the quality of life for the dying 
person and the loved ones rather than on treating the disease 
or intervening to delay the end of life. The fi rst role of hos-
pice care is to relieve the person’s pain and suffering through 
a variety of medical, physical, psychological, and spiritual 
means. Dying patients are encouraged to take an active role 
in as many aspects of their end-of-life care as their cognitive 
functioning and health permit. They are supported in talking 
about their death and interacting with their family. Hospice 
care has many advantages for those with a terminal illness. It 
prevents the experience of dying alone for those who do not 
have family and friends nearby. It allows the person to die 
in a more natural, familiar setting rather than in a hospital 
or nursing home. It offers emotional, spiritual, and physical 
comfort, helping more people experience a good death.
For example, Mary Wasacz is a spiritual care coordinator 
who works for the Hospice and Palliative Care of Westchester 
in New York. “Her job is to care for the spiritual lives of the 
dying and those who love them. She visits their homes . . . . 
She helps (patients) face their relationship with God, address 
their doubts, come to terms with their religious shortcom-
ings, hold tighter to their faith (whether it’s rich or fl icker-
ing) and prepare for death. . . .” “This is sacred ground,” says 
Wasacz. “It is such a sad time, but a privilege to be there, 
on this journey with them. It can be uplifting. What I do is 
facilitate peace” (Stern, 2007).
People come to the role of hospice work through many 
paths. Mary Wasacz is a devout Roman Catholic and 
9 to 15 months (Teno et al., 2004). The focus was on the loca-
tion where people die and the quality of care received by the 
person in the last 48 hours of life. Two thirds of the deceased 
had been in a hospital or nursing home in the last 48 hours 
of life. Of the one third who died at home, 38% had no nurs-
ing services, 12% had some home nursing services, and 50% 
had home hospice services. Over 70% of those whose loved 
ones received hospice care rated that care as excellent. Fewer 
than 50% of those whose loved ones died in a hospital, nurs-
ing home, or at home with home nursing services rated their 
care as excellent. With the exception of those receiving hos-
pice care, many of the bereaved felt that their loved ones did 
not receive the pain relief, respect, or emotional support they 
needed in the 2 days before their death.
There appear to be two different paths to achieving a good 
death among people who are in a slow, painful death trajec-
tory. One is hospice care. The other is euthanasia.
Hospice Care
Hospice care is an integrated system of medicine, nurs-
ing, counseling, and spiritual care for the dying person and 
the family. Its goal is to achieve the highest possible qual-
ity of life for the dying person and the family, alleviating 
physical and emotional pain to the highest degree possible, 
while supporting family strengths to cope with the process 
of dying, loss of the loved one, and long-term bereavement 
(Smith, 1997; Knee, 2010). Hospice care can take place in a 
hospice setting or at home.
The Hospice Education Institute (2001) offers the follow-
ing goals for high-quality end-of-life care:
• Promote relief from pain
• Integrate the psychological and spiritual aspects of patient 
care

CHAPTER 15 Understanding Death, Dying, and Bereavement
Dr. Kübler-Ross about the negative impact of institutionaliz-
ing and isolating the dying. Between 1978 and 1982, several 
demonstration programs to explore the benefi ts of hospice 
care were funded by federal agencies and private founda-
tions. As a result, the U.S. Congress included hospice care as 
a reimbursable Medicare benefi t in 1982—a provision that 
became permanent in 1986.
Since that time, Congress has increased the level of reim-
bursement for hospice care, included hospice care as part of 
veterans’ benefi ts, and included hospice care in the review 
of efforts to reduce waste and abuse in the Medicare and 
Medicaid systems. Clear guidelines have been established for 
the range and quality of services that hospices must offer in 
order to receive Medicare reimbursements, and an increasing 
range of educational and training programs have emerged 
to provide professional interdisciplinary training for those 
working in hospice and end-of-life care settings. In 1999, the 
U.S. Postal Service issued the Hospice Care Commemorative 
Stamp, marking the recognition of this successful model as 
part of the continuum of health care (National Hospice and 
Palliative Care Organization, 2005).
To take advantage of hospice through Medicare, one must 
make a decision to forgo any further life-saving or life-pro-
longing treatments. A physician must also submit certifi ca-
tion that the person is terminally ill, with 6 months or less 
to live. This provision is one of the current limitations in the 
use of hospice care within the Medicare system. In advanced 
stages of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, the 
demands on caregivers can be intense, but survival can be 
prolonged beyond 6 months. As a result, only a small percent-
age of those with Medicare hospice coverage are patients with 
Alzheimer’s disease (Kersting, 2004). To learn more about 
hospice care, you can visit the website of the National Hospice 
and Palliative Care Organization (www.hospiceinfo.org).
Euthanasia
Euthanasia is the practice of ending someone’s life for rea-
sons of mercy. In comparison to hospice care, euthanasia is 
considered when pain medication is ineffective in reducing 
suffering; when a person is in a persistent vegetative state, 
being kept alive by mechanical equipment; or when a person 
is in the fi nal stages of a terminal illness. Euthanasia gener-
ally involves hastening the end of life by allowing people to 
have control over their death.
Passive Euthanasia. Imagine that a person in the late 
stages of Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed as having cancer. 
Should treatments including surgery, chemotherapy, and 
radiation be administered to prolong the life of someone who 
is already near death? Passive euthanasia refers to withhold-
ing treatment or removing life-sustaining nourishment and 
breathing aids. The result is that death occurs more quickly 
than if these procedures were continued. Through a living 
will, a person can make wishes known to others, including 
the hospital or care center, physicians, and family mem-
bers or legal representatives. Through the durable power 
Eucharistic minister (she has been specially trained by the 
clergy to administer the sacrament of the Eucharist or com-
munion). She does not advocate her religion, or any particu-
lar religious orientation as a spiritual care coordinator, but 
her own faith helps her reassure people as they deal with 
their many fears and doubts. In contrast, Loretta Downs 
came to her role as a Hospice Partners volunteer patient 
companion after having experienced the death of many close 
friends who died of AIDS. She approaches her role in hos-
pice through the lens of yoga training.
Hospice is . . . a blanket of hope. It is a safe haven in which a 
team of specialists form a cocoon around the dying one and 
guide him or her through physical transformation while en-
couraging spiritual healing along the way. I am to be present 
in silence as well as in laughter and tears. I am to encour-
age all the appropriate activity and behavior my patients are 
able to perform while I create a space for them to engage in 
spiritual healing. . . . I am to be open to learn how to die 
myself. Now my patients and their families are my teachers. 
(Downs, 2004)
Angela Morrow described a third path, from intensive 
care nursing to hospice:
I began my nursing career in an intensive care unit. The 
majority of deaths I witnessed there involved patients, most 
of whom were elderly, undergoing painful tests and treat-
ments. . . . I’ll never forget the 90-year-old male patient who 
had terminal cancer and was admitted to the intensive care 
unit with severe breathing problems. We had to place a tube 
down his throat to help him breathe and inserted several IV 
lines to give him medicine. His hands were tied to the bed 
and he was given medication to put him into a coma-like 
state. Then his heart stopped. We spent a long time trying 
to revive him and with every chest compression I gave him, 
I thought, “What are we doing? Why are we doing this?”
Now that I’m working in hospice, I have the pleasure of 
helping my patients achieve a “good death,” one that is in 
accordance with their goals and priorities. (Morrow, 2008)
The story of the hospice movement illustrates how many 
factors converge to create a new set of policies and practices. 
The concept of the hospice as a setting for the care of termi-
nally ill patients is attributed to Dr. Cicely Saunders, who 
founded St. Christopher’s Hospice in London in 1967. In 
1963, she gave a talk at Yale University about her work with 
terminally ill cancer patients and their families, illustrating 
the many ways in which patients benefited from an inte-
grated approach to care. Following her talk, Florence Wald, 
the Dean of the Yale School of Nursing, invited Dr. Saun-
ders to be a visiting faculty member for a semester. Subse-
quently, in 1968, Dr. Wald took a sabbatical and spent time 
with Dr. Saunders at St. Christopher’s. These two health care 
leaders were supported in their efforts to create hospice set-
tings in the United States by the publication of Dr. Kübler-
Ross’ book, On Death and Dying, in 1969. In 1972, the U.S. 
Senate Special Committee on Aging heard testimony from

medication under the following conditions (Oregon Health 
Services, 2010a):
 1. Patients must be 18 years old or over, and be residents of 
the state of Oregon.
 2. Patients have been informed that they have a terminal 
disease and that they have less than 6 months to live; this 
must be confi rmed by a second opinion.
 3. The patient must make a written request for the lethal 
medication twice, at least 15 days apart, in the presence 
of two witnesses.
 4. There must be an evaluation to determine that the person 
is capable of making an informed decision, that there is 
no psychological disorder that would impair the ability 
to make the decision and that the person is not suffering 
from depression.
 5. The patient must be informed of the risks and possible 
results of taking the medication, and counseled as to fea-
sible alternatives such as hospice, or palliative care.
 6. The patient must be advised to have someone present at 
the time of taking the medication; and urged not to take 
the medication in public.
 7. The patient is advised of the right to rescind the request 
at any time.
In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that there is no 
constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, leaving the 
issue up to the states. They did not overturn the Oregon law. 
In 1997, Oregon voters affi rmed the decision to allow physi-
cian-assisted suicide by passing the measure again. In 2009, 
95 people received prescriptions, and 53 took the medica-
tion. The most frequently mentioned end-of-life concerns 
were: loss of autonomy (96.6%), loss of dignity (91.5%), and 
of attorney, a person assigns life-prolonging or life-ending 
decision making to a representative. Thus, by refusing treat-
ment or by granting discretion to others to end heroic or 
extraordinary treatment, individuals may hasten their own 
death. In the preceding example, if the person had a living 
will or durable power of attorney, a decision could be made 
by someone else to withhold treatment for the cancer, even 
though the person is no longer capable of decision making.
Active Euthanasia. Activities designed to end a person’s 
life are referred to as active euthanasia. There are several ways 
in which this may happen. Mercy killing involves actively 
taking a person’s life. This is sometimes done in order to end 
a person’s suffering. In our society, this is considered to be 
murder. States vary widely on whether the killer will be pros-
ecuted for this act and whether juries will be willing to con-
vict. In a Michigan case of a nurse who ended the lives of 
more than 20 patients at the Ann Arbor VA hospital, the jury 
found the nurse to be guilty of murder and sentenced her 
to life imprisonment. In a California case of a spouse who 
strangled her husband to end his suffering because she could 
not help him any longer, the state decided not to prosecute.
Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) involves either the 
administration of a lethal dose of some medication by a 
physician or arranging for a terminally ill patient to admin-
ister his or her own lethal dose of medication using a sui-
cide machine. This is an extremely controversial procedure. 
In 1994, Oregon passed a Death with Dignity Act (ODDA) 
allowing individuals who are terminally ill to request a pre-
scription from their physician for a lethal dose of medica-
tion. According to that act, doctors would be allowed to 
help patients commit suicide by prescribing a lethal dose of 
Technological innovations 
allow physicians to keep a 
person alive with the hope of 
saving them. These advances 
raise many ethical questions 
about conditions under which 
life should be sustained and 
treatment continued. Under 
what conditions do you 
think treatment should be 
terminated?

CHAPTER 15 Understanding Death, Dying, and Bereavement
life has expanded profoundly since 1947. One consequence 
of these improvements in medical technologies is the need 
for a new level of conscious decision-making among those 
who are dying and their families about the point at which 
medical treatment should be discontinued.
In contrast to PAS, some dying patients exercise a right 
to voluntarily refuse food and fluids as a way to hasten 
death. In interviews with 20 hospice workers, both nurses 
and social workers, 33 different cases were described where 
people wanted to hasten their death (Harvath et al., 2006). 
Two thirds sought PAS; one third chose refusal of food and 
fl uids. The hospice workers who were interviewed perceived 
these two paths as substantially different, with different ethi-
cal considerations. Voluntary refusal of food and fl uids was 
seen as “letting go of life” and most hospice workers viewed 
it as an expression of a dying person’s autonomy.
I don’t have any dilemmas or ethical issues with a person 
not eating or drinking. It’s a part of hospice that people 
have a right to determine what they will and will not do, 
how they want to die. There’s a big difference between that 
and somebody taking (a lethal dose of) medicine. Nobody 
makes a decision to tell a person not to eat or drink. (Har-
vath et al., 2006, p. 209)
Despite public opinion supporting measures to actively 
end life, these measures are illegal in the United States—with 
the exception of the states of Oregon and Washington—and 
continue to be a topic of ethical controversy (Fraser & Walters, 
2001; Walker, 2001). Those who support PAS argue that 
it respects the individual liberties and personal autonomy 
of those who are terminally ill but competent to make an 
informed decision about the end of life. It is also a compas-
sionate response to help end suffering. Finally legalizing PAS 
would open the possibility for more reasoned, full discus-
sion of alternatives between patients and their physicians. At 
present, these conversations are taking place covertly, with-
out full access to information about alternatives.
Opponents of PAS argue that legalizing assisted suicide 
might put undue pressure on elderly people to end their 
lives rather than be a burden to their families or to use pre-
cious fi nancial resources for end-of-life care. There is some 
sense that health care professionals in hospitals and nursing 
homes are less aggressive in using advanced technologies to 
prolong the life of elderly patients. Especially for those who 
have struggled to have access to quality health care during 
their adult lives, there is great mistrust about giving someone 
the right to withhold care or accelerate their death. Other 
opponents suggest that permitting those who are terminally 
ill to choose death would be one step toward a process of 
killing people who have mental disabilities or are born with 
serious defects that affect their quality of life. Some argue 
that the dying person who is in a great deal of pain may be 
depressed and lose sight of the possibilities for medical treat-
ments that could improve the medical condition. With effec-
tive counseling, the person might be less desperate about the 
decreasing ability to participate in activities that made life 
enjoyable (86.4%) (Oregon Human Services, 2010b).
How common are these measures? In the United States, 
the Death with Dignity Act was passed in the State of Wash-
ington in 2008. In all other states beside Oregon and Wash-
ington, assisted suicide and active euthanasia are illegal, 
which makes it diffi cult to know how often these strategies 
are used. It is legal in several European countries including 
Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and The Netherlands. In a 
study in The Netherlands, which has accurate records about 
requests for PAS, Wolf (1996) found that 38% of all deaths 
involved some kind of medical decision. Of these, 18% were 
the result of passive euthanasia where treatment was not pro-
vided, and 18% involved hastening death by providing pain 
medication or other care that led to death occurring more 
quickly than it might have by not using these treatments. 
Only about 2% of all cases involved the administration of 
a lethal drug or physician-assisted suicide. Thus, even in a 
country where assisted suicide is permitted, it is approached 
cautiously and used sparingly.
Ethical Issues at the End of Life
Ethical principles focus on standards of right and wrong, 
especially as they govern areas of moral and professional 
responsibility. Ethical issues surrounding end-of-life deci-
sions bring to mind the applied topic of abortion that was 
discussed in Chapter 4. One might view abortion as a special 
case of decisions about ending life. End-of-life decisions are 
relevant not only for elderly people; they may be addressed 
when parents decide to limit treatment for a terminally ill 
child, when family members decide to remove life support 
for an adult who is in a vegetative state, or when a person 
seeks assisted suicide in order to avoid a decline into an 
immobile or helpless state. The matter is made even more 
complex because decisions about ending life confl ict with 
the commitment of the medical profession to prolong life. As 
a result of many new technologies, medications, and genetic 
interventions, there are ongoing innovations that may be 
effective in slowing the progression of a disease or sustaining 
life even if the condition cannot be cured.
Public opinion about the acceptability of physicians help-
ing patients end their lives depends on how the question is 
framed. In a 2007 Gallup Poll, 49% of respondents said that 
doctor-assisted suicide was morally acceptable, and 44% said 
that it was morally unacceptable. However, when framed 
slightly differently, the response rate shifted. The following 
question has been asked in polls from 1947 to 2007: “When 
a person has a disease that cannot be cured, do you think 
doctors should be allowed by law to end the patient’s life by 
some painless means if the patient and his family request it?” 
In 1947, 37% of respondents said yes; in 2007, 71% said 
yes. Clearly, the public has a more accepting view of involv-
ing doctors in euthanasia today than in the past (Carroll, 
2007). The range of techniques that are available to prolong

casket and laid out for viewing. In some cultures, the body 
is cremated; in others, the body is buried. Cremation is typi-
cally associated with a belief in the liberation of the spirit. 
Burial is often tied to beliefs about the afterlife. For exam-
ple, ancient Egyptians believed that in order for the person’s 
soul to move on to the next life, the body needed to remain 
intact. As a result, they developed techniques for embalming 
and mummifi cation to preserve the body as long as possible 
(Encarta, 2005).
Cultures have different practices concerning how quickly 
the body is to be disposed of after death. In most Protestant 
and Catholic families, there is a 1- to 3-day viewing period 
after death, when family and friends come to the funeral 
home to see the body and pay respects to family members. 
This precedes the actual funeral service and burial. In con-
trast, among Islamic families, the body is prepared by family 
members when possible, men caring for the body of men and 
women for the body of women. The burial is expected to take 
place as soon as possible after the death, preferably within 
24 hours (IslamOnline, 2003). Viewing of the dead body 
after it has been prepared for burial is forbidden. In Japan, 
Buddhists allow 3 days to pass before the body is burned. On 
the fi rst day, a priest comes to the home and recites a prayer 
called a sutra. On the second day, the family members burn 
incense sticks before the family altar. On the third day, the 
body is burned at a funeral hall, and the ashes are brought 
back to the house and then taken to the cemetery.
Care of the Spirit
Most cultures believe that there is a spiritual component of 
a person’s being that is not destroyed as the body decom-
poses or burns. Certain ritual practices are designed to help 
the spirit make a transition to whatever existence the cul-
ture believes takes place after death. According to a Gal-
lup Poll taken in 2007, over 80% of Americans believe in 
heaven (Newport, 2007). The concept of heaven, whether 
it is viewed as a beautiful garden or a perfect, golden city, 
is typically conceptualized as a paradise of safety and abun-
dance where some form of pleasant existence continues after 
death (Miller, 2010).
The pathway to heaven depends on one’s religious and 
cultural beliefs. For example, in the Roman Catholic religion, 
the Last Rites, or Viaticum (which in Latin refers to provision 
for the journey), is a ritual that is carried out at the end of life 
or in instances of serious illness. The ritual is a celebration of 
faith; a prayer for God to deliver the person from the illness of 
body, mind, and spirit; and a process of absolving the person 
of sins in preparation for life after death in a state of grace. 
As part of the ritual, the person confesses sins, takes commu-
nion, and prays with the priest or Eucharistic minister, recit-
ing a set of familiar prayers and blessing (beliefnet, 2007).
Preparation of the spirit or soul may be achieved by recit-
ing specifi c prayers or burying the person with possessions 
that may be useful in the afterlife. Singing, dancing, and 
suffering and fi nd ways to achieve a new sense of closeness 
with loved ones. Finally, there are those who feel that allow-
ing someone to decide to end his or her own life is a viola-
tion of their religious or political views.
Death-Related Rituals
Objective 4. To describe death-related rituals and their 
functions.
Death is a powerful change of state that has mysterious 
qualities. Typically, it is accompanied by a range of symbolic 
rituals. These rituals address at least three critical aspects of 
the meaning of death. The first is how to treat the physi-
cal body—the corpse—in an appropriate way. The second is 
how to address the fate of the spiritual aspect of the person—
the soul. The third is how to meet the emotional needs of 
the survivors and the needs of the society as a whole. Across 
cultures, people feel a strong need to carry out funeral ritu-
als for the burial or cremation of the dead. Rituals have the 
advantage of offering a prescribed set of practices at a time 
when people may be too distressed to make complex deci-
sions. Over one’s life span, prior attendance and participa-
tion in funeral rituals provides some comfort and familiarity, 
which may help reduce the distress when a loved one dies.
Funeral rituals allow survivors to say good-bye to their 
loved one, honor the dead person, and, in the process, begin 
to detach themselves from the dead person. The concrete 
evidence of the body proves beyond a doubt to survivors 
that the person is dead. This helps break down natural ten-
dencies to want to deny the loss. When there is no body, 
as sometimes happens in natural disasters, mass killings, 
and war, survivors may be overcome by distress and anxi-
ety caused by uncertainty. Under these conditions, commu-
nities sometimes create memorial services or monuments 
to symbolically bury their dead (Boss, 2002a). The specifi c 
practices described in the following section are examples of 
traditional customs, which are often modifi ed depending on 
the orthodoxy of the mourners, community practices, and 
the context of the death.
Care of the Body
Most funeral preparations include specifi c practices for car-
ing for the corpse. Often, the corpse is washed and wrapped 
in a funeral shroud or cloth. Muslims wash the body in warm 
water and soap and, finally, with a scented water. Among 
American Indians, a powdery substance made of corn is 
used to cover the dead person’s face. Among Protestants and 
Catholics in Europe and the United States, the body is usu-
ally washed, embalmed, and dressed in clothes selected by 
the family. Often, cosmetics are applied to make the person 
look as if he or she is sleeping. The corpse is placed in a

CHAPTER 15 Understanding Death, Dying, and Bereavement
Care of the Surviving Family, 
Friends, and Community
In addition to addressing the treatment of the body and 
soul, death rituals are important for helping the people who 
remain to cope with their grief and reorient their lives in a 
world without the person who died. These rituals also allow 
the society to elaborate the meaning of death and decrease 
the ambiguity surrounding death. Most cultures have funer-
als for the dead. These funerals involve a gathering of family, 
friends, and spiritual leaders to carry out the rites for the dead 
person, provide a social context for expressions of grief, cele-
brate the life of the person who died, and begin the process of 
social support for those who remain. Depending on cultural 
custom, these social gatherings may occur before or after the 
burial or cremation. Funerals or memorial services provide a 
transition period surrounding death when people often have 
diffi culty believing that the loved one has really died.
Among Africans who have migrated to the United States 
in recent years, a complex set of funeral rituals are observed 
that help mark the status of the deceased and to reaffi rm tra-
ditional customs of the African community. The wake may 
last many days, as mourners gather from distant locations. 
The entire community contributes money to cover the costs 
of food, burial expenses, and the family’s support during the 
period of mourning. The funeral begins with drumming, 
singing, and dancing, which continue when the funeral pro-
cession moves to the burial site or the airport if the person is 
returned to Africa to be buried with his or her ancestors. The 
more important the social position of the deceased, the more 
elaborate the funeral (Hazell, 1997).
In the Jewish tradition, the period of mourning is pre-
scribed in some detail, taking the bereaved from the days 
playing musical instruments are sometimes used to speed 
the departed spirit on its way to the next life. Hindus believe 
that at death, the spirit leaves the body and enters a small 
fl ame that is lit next to the body. The spirit remains in the 
home because of attachments to family and possessions. The 
body is cremated, and there is a period of prayers in the per-
son’s home that lasts for 12 days. On the tenth day, the fl ame 
with the spirit is taken to the sea. Placing the fl ame in the sea 
is a signal to the spirit to leave the attachments of the earthly 
life and begin the transition to the afterlife.
In New Mexico, the Navajo believe that the dead person 
will need certain resources in the afterlife. The dead are often 
buried with an extra set of clothes, food, water, and other 
items that may be of value in the afterworld. The Navajo 
believe that everything a person creates has some part of the 
person’s spirit in it. As a result, at death, many of the artifacts 
a person made, such as pottery or blankets, are cracked or 
torn in order to release the person’s spirit (Santillanes, 1997).
Many societies also observe rituals in the years following 
the death to nurture and respect the spirit of the ancestor and 
establish a link between the living and the departed. In Esto-
nia, it is thought that there is a day each year when the dead 
return to their home for a visit. Rooms are cleaned, and food 
is laid out for a banquet. This is to preserve and strengthen 
relationships between the living and the souls of the dead. 
Many Japanese families visit the cemetery four times each 
year. They also have small altars in their homes, where they 
pray to their ancestors. They believe that the ancestors are 
always with them, guiding their lives and providing protec-
tion. In America, many people of different cultures visit the 
cemetery for periods of refl ection, solitude, and discussion 
with dead relatives. Practices of leaving fl owers and wreaths 
at the gravesite are expressions of respect.
In India, the body of a dead 
woman is prepared for cre-
mation as family members, 
friends, and members of the 
community look on.

other types of endowments. In the face of widespread catas-
trophes, such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, 
public memorial services are televised to permit interna-
tional mourning.
The box on the Amish way of death illustrates how one 
culture openly incorporates death into every aspect of life. 
The service and ritual are expressions of the belief in a spiri-
tual immortality and a simultaneous recognition of separa-
tion. Families customarily care for their aging parents in 
their own homes. Dying persons are surrounded by their 
families, who provide reassurance of generational continu-
ity. The bereaved family members receive help and care from 
community members for at least the fi rst year after a family 
death (Greksa & Korbin, 2004). In one study, Amish families 
found six conditions especially helpful for coping with death 
(Bryer, 1979, p. 260):
 1. The continued presence of the family, both during the 
course of the illness and at the moment of death
 2. Open communication about the process of dying and its 
impact on the family
 3. Maintenance of a normal lifestyle by the family during 
the course of the illness
 4. Commitment to as much independence of the dying per-
son as possible
 5. The opportunity to plan and organize one’s own death
 6. Continued support for the bereaved for at least a year 
following the funeral, with long-term support given to 
those who do not remarry
Religiosity leads to lower levels of anxiety and anger for 
the survivors and may provide them with an analysis of the 
meaning of the death of their loved one (Carr, 2003). The 
social support and dignity provided by religious rituals may 
also help survivors and decrease feelings of loneliness.
Bereavement and Grief
Objective 5. To analyze factors that affect grief and 
bereavement.
Three terms—bereavement, grief, and mourning—are 
often associated with the death or loss of a close relation-
ship. Bereavement refers to the loss of a meaningful relation-
ship; grief is the complex set of emotions and thoughts that 
accompany this loss; and mourning is the social and behav-
ioral expressions of loss, often guided by cultural practices 
(Fontana & Keene, 2009).
Bereavement
Bereavement is a long-term process of adjustment to the 
death of a loved one and is more all-encompassing than grief. 
It commonly includes physical symptoms, role loss, cognitive 
manifestations, such as seeking meaning in the loss or trying 
immediately following the funeral through the first year, 
and annually thereafter. Special focus is given to the prac-
tices expected of children on the death of their parents. This 
may be related to the importance placed on the fi fth com-
mandment, to honor one’s father and mother. Upon return-
ing to the home after the burial, the family members light a 
shiva (shiva means 7) candle, which represents the everlast-
ing soul of the deceased. They then begin 7 days of mourn-
ing. This is a time when family members stay at home and 
focus their attention on their grief and recollections of the 
deceased. Friends usually come by to visit, but no business 
is transacted. It is a solemn time, when luxuries and recre-
ation are set aside. The Kaddish, a prayer that affi rms life 
and faith in God, is recited daily. On the seventh day, the 
shiva candle is extinguished and the family members take a 
walk outside, symbolically escorting the loved one’s soul out 
of the house and indicating that the family is strong enough 
to carry on their lives. The period of mourning typically lasts 
12 months for those who have lost a parent and is marked 
by the unveiling of the tombstone or grave marker. After that 
time, children note the anniversary of their parents’ death by 
lighting a yahrzeit (year’s time) candle and attending services 
where the Kaddish is said (Louchheim, 1997).
Other rituals help to address the impact of the death on 
the larger social system. In the United States, people typi-
cally have a will, which is read to the heirs. This ritual pro-
vides for the distribution of resources and assets according 
to the deceased person’s wishes. The reading of the will and 
distribution of the assets helps to realign the social system 
following a death. Obituaries, which are published in local 
newspapers, are another custom that notifi es the larger com-
munity of a death. These statements often acknowledge the 
person’s accomplishments and recognize their family mem-
bers. This public statement can provide an opportunity for 
community members to offer support and condolences to 
the bereaved family members. A recent innovation is the 
practice of posting a tribute to a loved one on a website.
My grandma was the strongest and most beautiful person 
that I’ve ever known. She would light up a room when she 
walked in and had a wonderful warmth to her that made 
everyone love her. Although she has been gone from us for 
nearly 7 years—her spirit remains in each one of us. Life 
has not been the same without her here but we know that 
she is in a better place and that she looks over all of us. I’ve 
heard from many the famous quote of “it will get easier with 
time” but when you love someone that much it doesn’t ever 
get easier. I think you just come to accept the outcome. 
Grandma—We miss you and Love you so much!! Not just 
today but Everyday!!! Love–your family. (Hospice of Michi-
gan, 2007)
There are a variety of other ways that the lives of people 
are memorialized, including contributions to charities in 
the name of the dead person, the creation of monuments, 
naming of buildings or programs, listing of names on a wall 
or plaque, and the establishment of scholarships, grants, or

CHAPTER 15 Understanding Death, Dying, and Bereavement
THE IMPORTANCE THAT the Amish 
place on their funeral ceremonies 
is refl ected not only in familiarity 
with death but also in an intensifi ed 
awareness of community. As an Amish 
man reported in a family interview, 
“The funeral is not for the one who 
dies, you know; it is for the family.”
The Amish community takes care 
of all aspects of the funeral occasion, 
with the exception of the embalming 
procedure, coffi n, and horse-drawn 
wagon. These matters are taken care 
of by a non-Amish funeral director 
who provides the type of service that 
the Amish desire.
The embalmed body is returned 
to the home within a day of the 
death. Family members dress the 
body in white garments in accordance 
with the biblical injunction found in 
Revelation 3:5. For a man, this consists 
of white trousers, a white shirt, and 
a white vest. For a woman, the usual 
clothing is a white cape and apron 
that she wore at both her baptism and 
marriage. At baptism, a black dress is 
worn with the white cape and apron; 
at marriage, a purple or blue dress is 
worn with the white cape and apron. 
It is only at her death that an Amish 
woman wears a white dress with the 
cape and apron that she put away for 
the occasion of her death. This is an 
example of the lifelong preparation 
for death as sanctioned by Amish 
society. The wearing of white clothes 
signifi es the high ceremonial emphasis 
on the death event as the fi nal rite of 
passage into a new and better life.
Several Amish women stated that 
making their parents’, husbands’, 
or children’s funeral garments was a 
labor of love that represented the last 
thing they could do for their loved 
ones. One Amish woman related that 
each month, her aged grandmother 
carefully washed, starched, and 
ironed her own funeral clothing so 
that it would be in readiness for 
her death. This act appears to have 
reinforced for herself and her family 
her lifelong acceptance of death and 
to have contributed to laying the 
foundation for effective grief work 
for herself and her family. This can be 
seen as an example of the technique 
of preventive intervention called 
anticipatory guidance (Caplan, 1964), 
which focuses on helping individuals 
to cope with impending loss through 
open discussion and problem solving 
before the actual death.
After the body is dressed, it is 
placed in a plain wooden coffi n that is 
made to specifi cations handed down 
through the centuries. The coffi n 
is placed in a room that has been 
emptied of all furnishings, in order to 
accommodate the several hundred 
relatives, friends, and neighbors who 
will begin arriving as soon as the body 
is prepared for viewing. The coffi n 
is placed in a central position in the 
house, both for practical considerations 
of seating and to underscore the 
importance of the death ceremony.
The funeral service is held in the 
barn in the warmer months and in the 
house during the colder seasons. The 
service is conducted in German and 
lasts 1½ hours, with the same order of 
service for every funeral. The guests 
view the body when they arrive and 
again when they leave to take their 
places in the single-fi le procession of 
the carriages to the burial place.

the emotional state that emerges. If the person gains new 
insights into the loss and is able to construct positive mean-
ing in the situation, some of the distressing negative emo-
tions may subside and be replaced by positive emotions that 
could foster subsequent adjustment ( Hansson & Stroebe, 
2007).
With respect to resources, the loss of a life partner might 
be followed by the loss of social status, income, and compan-
ionship, but, over time, this same loss might result in new 
fi nancial resources such as life insurance, fewer medical bills, 
and freedom from caregiving responsibilities. Over time, grief 
might have an impact on a survivor’s health. The depression 
and confusion that accompany grieving may decrease the 
survivors’ sensitivity to their own physical health and pose 
risks to their mental health as well. People in deep mourning 
may have feelings of uselessness or emptiness that prevent 
them from seeking help for their own physical or emotional 
health problems. Some people try to cope with their grief by 
increasing their use of medication, alcohol, or tranquilizers, 
which may threaten their physical health. Loss of appetite 
and lack of sleep are other symptoms of grief that contribute 
to the pattern of increased vulnerability during this time. In 
contrast, others may fi nd a new sense of purpose and com-
mitment to life as a consequence of bereavement. They may 
take new steps to improve their own health and to treasure 
their days, realizing that life is precious. In order to under-
stand the adaptive nature of the bereavement process, one 
must appreciate that the meaning a surviving loved one gives 
to the death and the resources that are available to cope with 
the loss are changing over time.
Grief
Grief refers to the cognitive and emotional reactions that 
follow the death of a loved one. Grief reactions can vary in 
duration and intensity and can fade and reappear at unex-
pected moments. In a study of family members who were 
responsible for caring for a person suffering from later-life 
dementia, fi ve aspects of grief were identifi ed: (1) preoccu-
pation with thoughts of the deceased person, (2) longing 
for the person, (3) painful emotions, (4) feelings of dissocia-
tion—feeling disconnected from reality, and (5) sensory illu-
sions that led to the impression that the deceased person was 
still present. Of these fi ve aspects of grief, preoccupation was 
the most common and lasted the longest after the person’s 
death (Aneshensel et al., 1995).
Sometimes intense grief reactions are very similar to 
symptoms of mental illness (Hospice of Michigan, 2007). 
The following symptoms are not unusual:
Time distortion: Time seems to be frozen, the person is 
unsure what day it is, time moves unusually slowly or 
speeds by.
Obsessive rumination: Telling a story or incident over 
and over; thinking about a situation involving the 
dead person over and over.
to solve problems that arise as a result of loss of the loved 
one, and a variety of intense emotions, including anger, sor-
row, anxiety, and depression. Bereavement may be expressed 
in very individual ways and may also be guided by cultural 
practices that shape the behaviors and activities of those in 
mourning. The bereavement process can include both con-
fronting the loss and seeking ways to move away from or 
beyond the loss. It can include the expression of pain, sorrow, 
and loneliness as well as the possibility of self-insight, redefi -
nition, and psychosocial growth. The bereavement process 
can be viewed as a form of coping, as the person confronts the 
loss and its secondary stressors (Hansson & Stroebe, 2007).
Bereavement and Coping with Stress
Some authors conceptualize bereavement within a more 
general framework of coping with stress. In Reuben Hill’s 
(1958) ABCX model of coping with stress, adaptation (X) is 
determined by the interaction among three factors: the initial 
stressor (A), the resources and social support a person has to 
deal with the stressor (B), and the perception or meaning the 
person makes of the situation (C). The model was expanded 
into the double ABCX model (McCubbin & Patterson, 
1983) to refl ect the changes in the family system over time 
as the initial stressor is met and subsequent events bring new 
stressors, alter the existing resources, and change perceptions 
of the event (Figure 15.1). As this model suggests, efforts to 
cope with the initial stressor result in changes in the situation 
that alter the family’s adjustment. Initial coping strategies 
may reduce or improve the family’s resources, perceptions of 
the original stressor may change with time, and new second-
ary stressors may arise that impact the family system.
The value of this model for understanding bereavement is 
its emphasis on individual contexts of the death, the dynamic 
and changing nature of the stressor and its impact over 
time, and the key role that meaning making plays in how 
a person will adapt to the loss of a loved one. For example, 
a death might be perceived as unfair, sudden, cruel, or too 
soon by some but perceived as a blessing, or timely, by oth-
ers. Positive or negative appraisal of the loss may infl uence

inappropriate. Under conditions of grave trauma, some 
counselors suggest that an early period of denial helps the 
person cope with immediate demands. For some, the loss 
of a loved one comes after a long period of painful illness. 
Death may be viewed as a relief from suffering and, as such, 
brings a form of comfort to those who are still living. Thus, 
the context of death and its meaning for those who mourn 
suggests a more individualized view of the adaptive process 
of bereavement (Hansson & Stroebe, 2007).
Bereavement and Grief Among Older 
Widows and Widowers
Among people who have lost a spouse, intense depression is 
more likely to be experienced by those who described their 
marriage as positive and vital. It is clear that this loss strikes 
at the core of an older adult’s sense of attachment, social 
integration, and personal worth (Futterman, Gallagher, 
Thompson, Lovett, & Gilewski, 1990). In a comparison of 
older widows and widowers with adults who were not expe-
riencing bereavement, the widowed adults showed greater 
signs of depression, psychopathology, and grief at 2 months 
after the loss (Thompson, Gallagher-Thompson, Futterman, 
Gilewski, & Peterson, 1991). At 12 and 30 months after the 
loss, the two groups were comparable in levels of depression 
and psychopathology, but the bereaved group continued to 
experience higher levels of grief than the nonbereaved group. 
This research, confi rmed by other observations, suggests that 
among older adults, one may not expect a full resolution of 
the grief work associated with the death of a spouse. Rather, 
older adults come to accept a certain empty place in their 
hearts for their deceased partner and learn to fi nd appropri-
ate times to experience their profound sense of loss.
Five Patterns of Bereavement Among Widows
The complexity of bereavement as a coping process is illus-
trated in a study that followed older couples from before 
the death of a spouse until 18 months after the death. Five 
patterns of bereavement-related adjustment were identi-
fi ed (Bonanno, Wortman, & Nesse, 2004). These patterns, 
shown in Figure 15.2, were:
 1. Common grief pattern. These people had low levels of de-
pression before the spouse died. They experienced an 
increase in depression 6 months after the loss. After 18 
months, they returned to the same low level of depres-
sion that characterized them before the loss.
 2. Resilient pattern. People in this group had low levels of 
depression before the death of their spouse and contin-
ued to have low levels after the death of the spouse.
 3. Chronic grief pattern. These people had low levels of de-
pression before the loss but showed increased grief re-
sponses at both 6 months and 18 months after the loss.
 4. Chronic depression pattern. These people had high levels 
of depression before the loss, and depression continued 
at high levels at both 6 and 18 months.
Suicidal thoughts: Thoughts that the person cannot go 
on living without the deceased person in their lives.
Mystical experiences: Experiences of seeing or hearing 
the person who died, sensing them with you.
Identifi cation symptoms: Experiences of symptoms that 
are similar to those of the person who died.
Increased use of drugs and alcohol: Used to buffer 
experiences of pain from the loss.
Confusion: Diffi culty concentrating or making 
decisions.
There is no timetable for grief. One study followed the 
grief reactions of family members whose loved one died 
from cancer (Ringdal, Jordhov, Ringdal, & Kaasa, 2001). The 
intensity of grief response showed signifi cant declines by the 
end of the fi rst year after the death. In monitoring the grief 
response, however, one often fi nds confl icting evidence of 
devastation and impressive coping. A widow may be han-
dling daily tasks at a high level of competence and still fi nd 
herself in tears at seeing her husband’s hat in the closet. Over 
time, one expects to see gradual improvement in the intense, 
disruptive feelings of grief, but it is hard to say if there is a 
time when mourning is completed. Perhaps the most impor-
tant sign is that the person is able to reinvest in new activi-
ties and relationships, even while preserving affection for the 
deceased loved one.
Grief Work
In the face of bereavement, there is a need to work through 
the reality of the loss as well as the feelings that accompany 
it. The experience of the bereaved person is not that differ-
ent from the experience of the person who is coping with 
his or her own death. Psychiatrist Erich Lindemann (1944) 
worked with many of the people whose relatives had died in 
the Coconut Grove fi re in Boston. His writings continue to 
provide a basis for understanding the bereavement process.
Lindemann described the normal grief reaction as involv-
ing three phases. First, the person must achieve “emanci-
pation from bondage to the deceased.” This bondage may 
include feelings of guilt about ways in which he or she had 
criticized or even harmed the person who had died; feel-
ings of regret for things left unsaid or undone. Second, the 
person must make an adjustment to all the aspects of the 
environment from which the deceased is missing. The more 
closely linked the lives of the living and the dead, the more 
diffi cult this may be. Third, the person must begin to form 
new relationships—what we have called redirecting energy 
to new roles. Lindemann found that one major obstacle to 
working through this loss is a desire to avoid the accompa-
nying emotions and intense physical distress. According to 
his analysis, the strategy of avoiding grief only prolongs the 
survivor’s physical, mental, and emotional preoccupation 
with the dead person.
Questions have been raised about how universally appli-
cable Lindemann’s idea of grief work really is. In some cul-
tures, intense emotional expressions of grief are considered

 5. Depressed-improved pattern. These people had elevated 
levels of depression before the loss, but lower depression 
scores at 6 and 18 months after the loss.
The results of this research help to clarify the importance 
of the context of loss as it affects the bereavement process. 
The context of the loss can include the nature of the relation-
ship between the deceased person and the survivor, the sud-
den or gradual trajectory of death, the causes of death, the 
psychological health of the surviving spouse before the death 
of the partner, and the extent to which a spouse believes that 
the deceased had led a full life. The depressed-improved 
group, for example, was composed of people who were in 
unhappy or unsatisfying marriages; many had a substantial 
caregiving burden for an ailing spouse. Although people in 
this group did show evidence of grief responses at 6 months, 
they also reported benefi ts of widowhood and pride in the 
ability to cope with their new status.
In contrast, the chronic grievers comprised people 
whose lives were suddenly disrupted by the death of a 
healthy spouse. This group was especially preoccupied 
with a search for meaning as they tried to make sense of 
their spouse’s death. They had sustained experiences of 
yearning for their spouse, thinking about their spouse, and 
talking with others about their spouse at 6 months, with 
some evidence of improvement in these aspects of grief by 
18 months. The results of the study suggest that for some 
groups, especially the resilient and depressed-improved 
groups, the relative lack of expression of grief-related symp-
toms may not be due to denial of their loss, but to evidence 
of appropriate coping.

CHAPTER 15 Understanding Death, Dying, and Bereavement
Factors That Affect the Distress 
of Survivors
As illustrated in the study of patterns of bereavement among 
widows, the bereavement path depends in part on the con-
text of the loss. Grief may be more intense for those who 
lose a loved one in a sudden death. Under these conditions, 
there is no opportunity to discuss end-of-life decisions, for 
final expressions of caring and love, and for the bereaved 
to begin to anticipate life without the loved one (Howarth, 
2007). Bereavement may be diffi cult if the dying person is 
unable to receive effective pain control in their last days of 
life. Survivors who feel that the death of their loved one was 
brought about by physicians’ negligence feel greater dis-
tress and anger than survivors who feel that the loved one 
received high-quality medical care. An aspect of the dying 
process that is seen as negative for the dying person but is 
protective for the survivor is nursing home usage. It leads to 
reduced anxiety for the survivor and may prepare them for 
the separation that death fi nalizes, while sparing them from 
the burden and strain of direct caregiving.
Ambiguous loss is another especially diffi cult challenge 
for loved ones. Two types of ambiguous loss have been 
described (Boss, 1999). In the fi rst instance, the person is 
missing and may be dead, as in soldiers who are missing in 
action or people who may have died in a disaster but there 
are no physical remains. In the second instance, the person is 
physically present but unable to participate in any meaning-
ful way in family interactions, as when a person is in a coma 
or in the late stages of Alzheimer’s disease. As a result of the 
destruction of the World Trade Center in New York, some 
children experienced both types of losses: One parent died 
in the destruction of the towers but no remains were recov-
ered, and the other parent was so distraught by the spouse’s 
death that he or she became unable to enact the parent role 
(Boss, 2004). The box on ambiguous loss describes some of 
the issues surrounding this unique context of bereavement.
Finally, bereavement may be diffi cult if the survivor has 
experienced many positive benefi ts of caregiving, including 
feelings of being needed, important, and effective, as they 
addressed the needs of an ailing spouse (Boerner, Schulz, & 
Horowitz, 2004). Although family caregiving is often viewed 
as a source of stress, some people fi nd that they gain comfort 
and even a personal sense of worth through caregiving. In 
this context, the death of the ailing spouse or parent brings a 
double loss—loss of the loved one and loss of the meaning-
ful caregiving role.
Unacknowledged and Stigmatized Loss
The bereavement process is infl uenced by a society’s interpre-
tation of who the legitimate mourners are and who has expe-
rienced a legitimate death. Some people who grieve may not 
be recognized as legitimate mourners. These might include 
former spouses, foster children, partners in a gay relation-
ship, professional caregivers, extramarital lovers, families of 
addicts and criminals, and people who have had abortions. 
When communities do not sanction or support their grief, it 
may be diffi cult for these people to acknowledge that they 
have suffered a loss or to experience closure after the death. 
These unacknowledged mourners may be confused about 
their status and feel guilty or embarrassed by their attach-
ment to the dead person (Murray, 2000).
There are also situations in which a person survives a 
loved one who had a stigmatized death. Stigmatized deaths 
are those in which people attribute the death to an immoral, 
illegal, or evil cause. Some survivors may feel confl ict in their 
grief and anger toward the dead person because they believe 
that person was involved in immoral or unclean behavior. 
These feelings may lead the griever to secrecy and misrep-
resentations about the death. Social networks may shun 
people who are grieving for someone who died a stigmatized 
death. Negative stereotypes surround these deaths and are 
often extended to include survivors (Murray, 2000).
Death by suicide is an example of a stigmatized death, in 
which survivors may feel guilty about not having been able 
to prevent the death and angry at that person for the suicide. 
They may experience great confl ict because of their love for 
the person who died and their belief that death by suicide is 
immoral. Communities look down on death by suicide and 
may not provide the customary rituals that help support the 
grieving persons. Many religions consider suicide to be a sin 
and will not provide religious services or burial rights for the 
deceased. In a qualitative study of adults who were mourning 
people who had committed suicide, two persistent themes 
are trying to make sense of the death and a struggle to man-
age the social uneasiness in interactions with others. Mean-
ing making was a key factor in the coping process for these 
survivors, including the meaning of the suicide, the meaning 
of the relationship between the survivor and the person who 
committed suicide, and the meaning of the survivor’s own 
life (Begley & Quayle, 2007).
AIDS is another example of a stigmatized loss. In the 
1980s, as the AIDS epidemic was taking hold, many sur-
vivors found that there was little support for their grief. 
The devastating effects of AIDS and the associated end-of-
life conditions, compounded by fear of contamination, left 
many survivors isolated and traumatized by their stigma-
tized loss. In 1985, gay rights activist Cleve Jones discov-
ered that more than 1,000 people had died of AIDS in San 
Francisco alone. He and other activists conceived of the 
NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt as a way of honor-
ing and memorializing this loss. The fi rst national display 
of the AIDS Quilt took place on the National Mall in Wash-
ington, D.C., at a lesbian and gay rights march in 1987. At 
the time, the quilt had 1,920 panels and was seen by more 
than half a million people. By 1988, the quilt was taken 
on a 20-city tour and had grown to 6,000 panels. Today, 
there are 18 NAMES chapters in the United States and 43 
affiliates around the world. The quilt has 46,000 panels 
commemorating over 91,000 people who have died from 
AIDS (The Names Project Foundation, 2007). As a result 
of this and other initiatives, the focus shifted from shun-
ning the ill to investing in new medical research for causes 
and cures. Resources were invested in research about AIDS, 

 
Bereavement and Grief | 619
Ambiguous Loss
IN 2005, THE CHIEF Medical Examiner’s 
Offi ce of the City of New York announced 
that it would stop efforts to identify 
body parts that were recovered from the 
destruction of the World Trade Center 
on September 11, 2001. Of the 2,749 
people who were reported missing, 
1,161 had not been identifi ed from the 
remains. Despite the use of a variety of 
approaches to identifi cation, more than
9,000 body fragments were not identifi ed.
These fragments were stored for future 
analysis, in case new technologies 
are developed that allow for their 
identifi cation (Chen, 2005). At some point 
after the tragedy, the mayor of New 
York offered presumed-death certifi cates 
to families when there was no body 
that could be identifi ed. Some families 
accepted those certifi cates, whereas 
others continued to wait for DNA testing 
results. Thousands of families suffered 
ambiguous loss—some for days not 
knowing if their loved one was in the 
buildings, many for months as they 
waited for the remains to be excavated 
from Ground Zero, and some are still 
suffering because there is no physical 
evidence of their loved one’s body.
Pauline Boss (2002b, 2004, 
2007) developed an understanding 
of ambiguous loss through clinical 
observation, theory, and research. She 
worked with many families who have 
experienced this type of loss, including 
merchant marine families, soldiers’ 
families, families whose loved ones died 
in the terrorist attacks of September 
11, 2001, and families in Kosovo. 
Much of this discussion is based on her 
observation and methods.
Ambiguous loss is a problem for the 
structural and functional characteristics 
of a family. Families may try to hold 
a place for the person in daily life. 
Confusion about whether a loved one is 
dead or alive may lead some families to 
ignore parental roles, put off decisions, 
neglect daily tasks, and isolate living 
family members. Many families stop 
carrying out rituals and celebrations, 
which leads to further disconnection 
among family members.
Psychologically, the chronic uncertainty 
and lack of new information produce 
feelings of hopelessness, passivity, and 
immobilization. Because they do not 
have proof of death, family members may 
become confused—they do not know 
what to think or how to act. They may 
become stagnant by denying the loss 
and continuing to hope. The result is that 
family members are not grieving, and 
they are not coping with their loss.
Questions arise such as, “Should 
you have a funeral if you do not have 
a body?” Families would get into 
protracted arguments about this. Some 
parents did not want to tell their children 
that their father or mother was dead. 
Many children got the impression that 
they were not supposed to talk about 
the missing parent. People in these 
families are trying to hold two opposing 
ideas in their minds: (1) the loved one is 
still alive, and (2) the loved one is dead. 
As a result, their grief process is blocked. 
It takes a very long time to create a 
family life that includes acceptance and 
integration of this ambiguity.
In working with the families whose 
loved ones died on September 11, 
2001, Boss cited several techniques 
that helped people to cope with their 
loss. First, she created family storytelling 
meetings, where adults and children 
were encouraged to tell something they 
remembered about the missing person. 
Second, she arranged for groups of 
families who lived in the same community 
to meet together and tell stories about 
their missing family members. These 
meetings helped foster community 
connections. People were able to identify 
others who had the same needs, and 
they began to fi nd ways to meet those 
needs. Third, she explained the idea of 
ambiguous loss and helped people see 
why it was causing them so much distress. 
This helped reduce self-blame and family 
discord. Fourth, she encouraged families 
to revise family rituals and celebrations but 
to continue having them, because they are 
so important to preserving the unity of a 
family. Fifth, she told them not to become 
agitated and distressed by pushing for 
closure. She believes that closure is a myth 
and that death always produces ambiguity 
and uncertainty. Being done with grief, 
putting an end to mourning, and moving 
on are unrealistic expectations. People will 
always feel somewhat sad about the death 
of someone they love.
Some families were less distressed 
than others. The characteristics of these 
families included a belief that the loss 
of the loved one was predestined and 
perhaps a product of the will of God; 
some had a deep faith that God would 
care for their loved one and guide them; 
some had prior experience in coping 
with ambiguous loss; and some were 
cognitively or temperamentally better 
able to hold the two opposing ideas in 
their minds and still retain the ability 
to function. Boss (2004) reported some 
comments that were made to her by 
people who were less distressed: “My 
son has been missing so long now—he’s 
probably dead, but I feel he’s here with 
me, and always will be” (p. 559). “I must 
move on and organize life without my 
son, but at the same time I can hope 
and remember” (p. 559).
Critical Thinking Questions
 1. What are some of the challenges of 
ambiguous loss that interfere with 
the bereavement process?
 2. Critically evaluate each of the fi ve 
techniques Boss has developed to 
help people cope with their loss. 
What might be helpful about these 
strategies? Why might these tech-
niques be helpful? Are there aspects 
of these strategies that might not be 
helpful? Why not?
 3. Which types of people might be 
most troubled by ambiguous loss? 
Why? Which types of people would 
be most likely to benefi t from Boss’s 
approach? Why?
 4. Can you think of other kinds of inter-
ventions that might be helpful in sup-
porting survivors of ambiguous loss?
 5. What might be some differences in 
the challenges of coping with am-
biguous loss and stigmatized loss?
 6. Design research to investigate the 
long-term impact of ambiguous loss. 
What factors would you measure? 
What would be your indicators of ef-
fective bereavement and adjustment 
outcomes?

CHAPTER 15 Understanding Death, Dying, and Bereavement
understand the essence and limits of their existence. They 
provide a bridge for understanding the grief and unhappi-
ness of others. Grief leads to greater levels of understanding 
of oneself and others.
The adaptive process of bereavement involves an oscil-
lation between loss-oriented coping, which refers to con-
fronting one’s pain, sadness, and the loss of a loved one and 
fi nding a place for the deceased loved one in one’s thoughts 
and memories in order to achieve emotional health and cog-
nitive functioning, and restoration-oriented coping, which 
refers to fi nding ways to master the practical challenges of the 
loss in order to make meaning of the death and move along 
in one’s life (Caserta & Lund, 2007; Hansson & Stroebe, 
2007). When a person who is close dies, it stimulates refl ec-
tion about that relationship. There may be a new apprecia-
tion of the qualities of the relationship and its importance. 
One may consider what the other person did to make the 
relationship especially valued. The bereaved person may 
begin to examine his or her own behavior, thinking of ways 
to bring some of the valued qualities of the relationship with 
the dead person to ongoing friendships and family ties. Peo-
ple may make resolutions to do a better job of supporting 
valued relationships by staying in touch, writing more often, 
or calling home. In the process of experiencing the death of 
a loved one, a person may become more appreciative of the 
value of these special, close relationships, realizing that they 
will not last forever. It is important to give valued relation-
ships appropriate care and nurturance. This may lead to a 
growth in commitment to one’s radius of signifi cant relation-
ships and to maintaining excellent quality in them.
The death of a loved one may stimulate a process of life 
review, leading one to refl ect on the meaning of one’s life. 
This process of taking stock may involve posing some of the 
AIDS education, and the discovery of treatments to slow the 
course of the illness and prolong life.
In the United States and throughout the world, the 
death of adult children as a result of AIDS is resulting in 
the increased involvement of grandparents who are parent-
ing their orphaned grandchildren (Linsk & Mason, 2004; 
Winston, 2006). In a qualitative study of South Africans who 
had lost a loved one to AIDS, bereaved adults described their 
situation as so overwhelming that there was little time for the 
typical experiences of grief (Demmer, 2007). The struggle 
for daily survival was intensifi ed as a result of the economic 
losses associated with the death of an adult member of the 
household. Older women were burdened with the tasks of 
caring for the sick and looking after the surviving children. 
In this context, customary practices associated with mourn-
ing and loss were set aside in order to continue to meet the 
pressing demands of daily life.
Psychosocial Growth Through 
Bereavement
Bereavement brings new possibilities for psychosocial 
growth. Just as happiness and joy are innate human emo-
tions, so is sadness. Having these feelings is part of the 
human experience. Even though they are unpleasant, the 
emotions associated with grief connect people to their essen-
tial human nature. Expressions of grief have a social con-
sequence. An infant’s cries have the effect of bringing the 
caregiver into contact with the infant; the tears of grief com-
municate to others a person’s needs for comfort and reassur-
ance. Without experiences of grief, the moments of treasured 
happiness would mean less. These experiences help people

a result, the survivors have to redefi ne themselves and estab-
lish new personal identities. For example, when Carl died, 
his wife Lois was no longer invited to social events that were 
hosted by Carl’s coworkers. Lois no longer maintained her 
membership at Carl’s golf club. She found that it was awk-
ward to introduce herself to new people without being able 
to say that she was Carl’s wife. She recognized that her social 
status was based on Carl’s work and leisure activities. Being 
Carl’s widow did not carry the high level of social status and 
value that she was used to. Lois had to begin to create a new 
identity in her community. This work is not easy, but it is 
very important and necessary.
The death of a loved one may stimulate a revisitation of 
psychosocial crises. For example, upon the death of a par-
ent, one may reflect on earlier issues of autonomy versus 
shame and doubt, realizing a new sense of responsibility for 
one’s actions. When parents are alive, even as they get older, 
an adult child is somehow buffered from the full weight of 
autonomous self-determination. When parents die, one may 
refl ect on the many ways in which their values and beliefs 
have guided one’s attitudes and behavior.
When a spouse dies, in addition to the need to reconfi g-
ure one’s identity, issues of intimacy versus isolation may be 
revisited. A person may refl ect on the quality of his or her inti-
mate relationship, thinking about the nature of trust, levels of 
disclosure, sense of mutual respect, and openness to change. 
One may reexamine some of the ways in which intimacy was 
expressed and some of the ways in which isolation was experi-
enced in the relationship. If the opportunity arises for the for-
mation of a new intimate relationship, this revisitation could 
lead the person to approach that new relationship with differ-
ent strategies, assumptions, or expectations for self and other.
When a person you admire dies, it often promotes new 
levels of identification with the deceased. This process 
sometimes begins with the eulogy, where the community 
is reminded of the strengths and accomplishments of the 
person who died. In refl ecting on the person’s life, a survi-
vor may take on a valued characteristic, such as integrity, 
fairness, sense of humor, or patience. Survivors may find 
themselves using expressions or participating in activities 
that were associated with the person who died. In this way, 
they expand their repertoire of behaviors, activities, and ego 
strengths. In addition to identification, the survivor may 
introject the lost person (i.e., take the person’s essence inside 
themselves in thought and feelings). Introjection is differ-
ent from identifi cation, in that the person feels that the lost 
person is in them. They may carry on meaningful conversa-
tions with this person and sense their guiding presence. This 
is similar to having an imaginary companion. Introjection 
allows the bereaved person to keep the dead person alive 
and to preserve their relationship. While still carrying on a 
mature and sensible existence, the bereaved add a psycho-
logical dimension to their abilities by preserving the charac-
teristics of the revered and adored loved one.
In bereavement, thoughts are likely to turn to one’s own 
mortality. The manner of the loved one’s demise and the way 
big questions of life: What is the purpose of your life? Are 
you spending time in ways that are meaningful? Is your work 
an expression of your real values? Are your relationships sat-
isfying and meaningful? Are you making any contribution to 
your community and to the well-being of others? This kind 
of refl ection may lead to a reformulation of one’s lifestyle or a 
re-evaluation of certain life experiences.
The death of someone whose presence serves to help 
defi ne your identity requires a redefi nition of your identity. 
Social roles are typically reciprocal—children have parents, 
husbands have wives. The death of someone in a recipro-
cal role leads to the reorganization of that role and its enact-
ment. When a parent dies, children may have to assume 
some elements of the parental role. These elements are often 
concerned with greater levels of responsibility and caregiv-
ing. When a spouse dies, the remaining spouse has a new 
identity as a widow or widower. This brings with it new 
social meaning and, sometimes, a change in social status.
When a person dies, the links to social identity and social 
network may no longer exist for the person who remains. As

CHAPTER 15 Understanding death, dying, and bereavement
the death of someone close helps individuals recognize the 
value of their own lives and the emotions that significant 
others will experience when they die. In bereavement, a per-
son can fi nd comfort in the faith, confi dence, and hopeful-
ness of the person who died, and be inspired to achieve that 
sense of integrity with regard to his or her own death.
he or she faced death may help survivors prepare for the 
possibilities involved in their own death. The dead person’s 
courage may lead the living person to work to develop cour-
age. The creation of a living will by the deceased may be seen 
as benefi cial by the surviving people, who proceed to estab-
lish their own living wills. The depth of emotion created by 
The fi eld of human development has come to a new open-
ness about the topics of death and dying. There is an increas-
ing sense that people can make decisions about the quality 
of their death and that these decisions can and should be 
discussed with family members as well as with health care 
professionals. In addition to experiences with death and the 
anticipation of one’s own mortality, dialogues about death are 
taking place in families to a greater degree than they did in 
the past.
Objective 1. To understand the role of mortality 
in shaping psychosocial development.
The psychosocial perspective helps to direct attention to 
how people determine the meaning of the events of their 
lives as they interact with the environment over time. Death 
presents one of the greatest challenges to meaning making. 
At each stage of life, our understanding of death changes 
because of the different cognitive and emotional resources 
we have available and as a result of the salience and prox-
imity to death. The way people conceptualize their own 
death and the death of others is infl uenced by the cultural 
context.
Objective 2. To defi ne the biological state of death.
The defi nition of the biological state of death has changed 
as a result of the development of new technologies. In 
addition to the lack of a heartbeat and the lack of respi-
ration, death is determined by a combination of eight 
criteria that confirm the end of brain functioning. New 
legal procedures or advance directives allow people to 
convey their preferences about end-of-life treatment and 
to appoint people to make decisions for them if they are 
incapacitated.
Objective 3. To describe factors associated with the 
process of dying and the modern ideal of a good death.
The process of dying can follow different trajectories, involve 
different degrees of suffering, and occur at different ages. 
Professionals have begun to defi ne characteristics of a good 
death, and dying patients are having a greater voice in deter-
mining the nature of their death. Hospice care and euthanasia 
are two paths that people may choose when they are experi-
encing a slow, painful death trajectory. End-of-life decisions 
are a focus of ongoing ethical controversies and debate.
Objective 4. To describe death-related rituals and their 
functions.
Death-related rituals are found in all cultures. They tend to 
focus on three aspects of the meaning of death: (1) care of the 
body, (2) care of the spirit, and (3) care of the surviving fam-
ily, friends, and community. These rituals provide a context 
for acknowledging the death, preparing the spirit for its tran-
sition, and legitimizing the grief of the bereaved survivors.
Objective 5. To analyze factors that affect grief 
and bereavement.
Bereavement is the long-term process of adjustment to the 
death of a loved one. Grief is the cognitive and emotional 
reaction to loss. The concept of grief work refers to the emo-
tional expression, cognitive reorganization, and social adjust-
ments that take place as a result of the death of a loved one. 
There are many patterns of bereavement, depending on the 
context of the death, relationship of the survivor to the dead 
person, religious orientation of the survivor, and fi nality or 
ambiguity surrounding the death. Communities play a role 
in supporting the bereavement process by the way they 
respect or stigmatize the death and the way they memorialize 
and honor the dead.

APPENDIX The Research Process
The Positivist Approach to Research
In this section, we describe the positivist research approach 
(see Figure A.1). The research process usually begins with a 
puzzling idea or observation. The fact that the observation 
is puzzling means there is something to be fi gured out. The 
research process assumes there is something to be explained 
or clarifi ed that is currently not explained, or that certain 
observations lead to the possibility that current explanations 
are inadequate or incorrect. The observer tries to fi gure out 
how to explain the observation and thinks about what leads 
to what—which events or conditions cause other events or 
conditions. In this process of searching for explanations, 
one develops a set of interrelated ideas to account for the 
observation. These ideas—often referred to as assumptions, 
 hypotheses, or predictions—constitute a theory. The theory 
is not an end in itself, but a way to begin.
Scientifi c Observation
The next step of the scientifi c process is to test the theory 
through systematic observation. A good theory contains spe-
cifi c predictions about cause and effect. After the predictions 
are stated, one must fi gure out how to test whether they are 
accurate. One must operationalize the concepts of a theory 
in order to test them. That is, one must translate an abstract 
concept into something that can be observed and measured.
I
n this appendix, we highlight basic principles of the sci-
entifi c process, including the positivist and qualitative ap-
proaches to inquiry, from which much of our knowledge 
about development is derived. Scholars depend on this pro-
cess to guide inquiry, a process that imposes constraints of 
logic, methodology, and ethics in hopes of building a sound, 
unbiased understanding of patterns and processes of devel-
opment. We review basic topics in research design including 
sampling, research methods, and designs for studying devel-
opment. Finally we consider ethical guidelines for conduct-
ing research with human participants.
In approaching the challenges of conducting and inter-
preting research about development, remember that studies 
that summarize the responses or behaviors of groups of peo-
ple will not necessarily account for the experiences of spe-
cifi c individuals. Similarly, the experiences of individuals will 
not necessarily be generalizable to larger groups. The study 
of life-span development is a quest for patterns of continuity 
and change over time and across historical eras. However, 
it is important to appreciate that some patterns that might 
characterize the experiences of one cohort may not apply 
across historical periods.
The Scientifi c Process
The scientifi c process allows us to create a body of knowl-
edge that contains procedures for ensuring that the informa-
tion will be correct. Two major positions have been taken on 
how to approach the discovery of knowledge: positivism and 
qualitative inquiry, which is sometimes referred to as postposi-
tivism or phenomenology (Bordens & Abbott, 2011).
Positivism approaches the study of human behavior by 
seeking causal relationships among factors, with the goal of 
trying to predict outcomes. Often, this approach applies sta-
tistical analyses to data gathered from many participants in 
order to test specifi c hypotheses. In the positivist approach, 
the research hypotheses guide decisions about the nature 
and size of the sample, the site(s) where data are collected, 
the methods of data collection, and the statistical procedures 
used to analyze the data.
Qualitative inquiry approaches the study of human 
behavior by trying to understand the meanings, motives, and 
beliefs that underlie a person’s experiences. This approach 
emphasizes the individual’s point of view and the subjec-
tive understandings that help account for a person’s actions. 
Often this approach begins with examination of a personal 
experience, such as a parent’s experience of caring for a child 
who has a developmental disability; a process, such as staff-
parent communication in a neonatal unit; or a unique phe-
nomenon, such as a near-death experience. Approaches to 
data collection may change as the study evolves, depending 
on the nature of the participants, the ideas that emerge, and 
the researcher’s reactions and interpretations. Both positiv-
ism and qualitative inquiry strive to contribute to a new level 
of understanding of human behavior.

The Scientifi c Process | A-3
Scientific observation is characterized by three essen-
tial qualities: It must be objective, repeatable, and systematic 
(Creswell, 1994). Objective observations accurately refl ect 
the events that are taking place. They are not unduly infl u-
enced by what the observer expects or hopes to see. Sup-
pose, for example, that you want an objective assessment of 
your child’s talent for playing the guitar. You are unlikely to 
get objective feedback from friends or relatives. Because they 
know you and presumably would not like to insult you, they 
may be inclined to slant their answers to please you.
A more objective approach might be to include an audio-
tape of your child’s guitar playing with tapes of 10 other chil-
dren. You would then ask another person to play the tapes for 
10 people who do not know you or your child and ask each 
of them to rate the quality of musical ability demonstrated 
on each tape. You may or may not like the outcome, but at 
least your method would be more objective. It would reveal 
what other people think of your child’s musical ability with-
out being biased by any feelings about you or your child.
Social science research is always vulnerable to the theo-
retical biases and value orientations of the researchers. Cer-
tain practices of research design, sampling, and methodology 
are used to help overcome biases and build a higher level 
of objectivity into the process. However, many will argue 
that it is impossible to be entirely objective. One’s orienta-
tion toward framing research questions and interpreting the 
results are always infl uenced by cultural and historical con-
texts that shape the values, beliefs, and assumptions that guide 
the research process. That is why it is so important that the 
research be carried out by more than one investigator and that 
the procedures are explained in enough detail to be repeatable.
If research is repeatable, then others could carry out a 
similar investigation and compare the results with those of 
the original investigator. In order for this to occur, the origi-
nal investigator must carefully explain all the procedures 
used in the study, describe all the essential characteristics 
of the participants (e.g., age, sex, social class), and describe 
the setting or situation where the observations were made. 
Because there are many ways that one group of participants 
might differ from another and many different ways that 
observations can be made, repeatability is an important part 
of building a body of social science knowledge.
Usually, a problem or process is investigated by an indi-
vidual or research team, taking great care to make sure 
that observations are unbiased, orderly, carefully collected 
and recorded, and comprehensive. In order to ensure that 
the results of a study are accurate, the original researchers 
encourage other investigators to repeat the study to see if the 
same results are observed.
A systematic approach ensures that research is done 
in a careful, orderly way. Researchers have a framework of 
essential questions that they strive to answer based on what 
is already known and what certain theories predict. They 
approach research by having clear objectives, carefully 
defi ning the purpose of the research, and the specifi c meth-
ods they will use to reach those objectives. Although some 
 discoveries are made by accident, scientifi c research typically 
does not poke here and there at unrelated events.
Often the theory is not tested by the same person who 
develops it, because this person may have some personal 
investment in demonstrating that the theory is correct. The 
scientific process usually involves the ideas of more than 
one person. Sometimes, people with different points of view 
engage in debate, trying to refute positions they fi nd fl awed. 
At other times, two or more people work on different phases 
of theory building, experimentation, and evaluation.
If a theory is fruitful, many researchers working in indepen-
dent groups will devise ways of testing and clarifying it. Work-
ing in this way, as a community of scholars, helps to ensure that 
a theory will not be confi rmed simply because of the theorist’s 
personal biases. For example, Erik Erikson was not the person 
who tested his own psychosocial theory. Many other research-
ers have devised strategies for operationalizing Erikson’s con-
cepts, thereby expanding our understanding of concepts such 
as hope, identity, intimacy, generativity, and wisdom—to name 
a few—and clarifying the relationship of development in child-
hood and adolescence to adulthood and later life.
The fi nal phase of the scientifi c process involves an evalu-
ation of the observations. Statistical techniques help deter-
mine the likelihood that observations could have happened 
by chance. Observations that appear to be a result of chance 
do not confirm the theory. If the observations have a low 
probability of having occurred by chance, one says that they 
are statistically signifi cant. If statistically signifi cant results 
support the theory’s predictions, one is likely to accept them 
as providing evidence for the theory. Nevertheless, scientists 
may continue to examine the propositions of the theory, 
involving new participants or new methods.
What if the results do not fit the theory’s predictions? 
One approach is to re-examine the methods and design 
of the study. Perhaps the key concepts were not measured 
appropriately or the sample was biased in some way. When 
results of research are inconclusive or contrary to the pre-
dictions, scholars may try another research approach before 
revising the theory. But when several different studies fail to 
support the hypotheses, we tend to lose confi dence in the 
entire structure of the theory. We may revise or discard the 
theory and begin to develop an alternative explanation for 
the observations.
In summary, in the positivist approach, the scientifi c pro-
cess consists of creating a theory, testing it through research, 
and modifying, rejecting, or accepting it. If confirmed 
through the research process, a theory helps us interpret 
many observations about reality.
The Qualitative Inquiry Approach 
to Research
Whereas the positivist perspective assumes that there is a 
truth that can be captured through the research process, the 
qualitative inquiry approach assumes that there are many

APPENDIX The Research Process
Sampling
Sampling is the method for choosing participants who will 
be included in the study. The nature of the questions that 
are being addressed usually has implications for the best way 
to identify the sample. If the study is about some universal 
principle of development, it should apply to individuals 
from a wide variety of family and social backgrounds. For 
example, studies of normal language development should in-
clude children from various ethnic, racial, social class, and 
cultural backgrounds. One cannot argue for universal prin-
ciples if the research has shown the processes or patterns to 
be true only for a homogeneous group of children.
Every sample is taken from a population. The population 
is the large group to which the fi ndings of the research are 
intended to apply. There is no single, predetermined popu-
lation; the relevant population depends on the purpose and 
scope of the research. The sample is a smaller subgroup of 
the larger population that will participate in the study. For 
example, the population of interest might be adolescents in 
the United States who graduate from high school but do not 
go on to college. Roughly 975,000 adolescents who gradu-
ated from high school in the spring of 2007 were not enrolled 
in any postsecondary school in the fall of 2007 (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2010). No research study is likely to include all of 
those adolescents. So a sample is drawn that is expected to 
be representative of the population. Under ideal conditions, 
the participants in any study of this population ought to have 
the same general characteristics (e.g., family income; race; 
gender; urban, suburban, or rural environment; and high 
school academic background) as the population from which 
the sample was selected. The sample and the population from 
which the sample is taken determine the  generalizability of 
the research fi ndings—the extent to which we can say with 
confi dence that the observations made for this sample would 
apply to other groups. We must be careful not to assume that 
research fi ndings based on one sample are generalizable for 
all ages, both sexes, all racial and ethnic groups, all social 
classes, or individuals from other cultures.
Five approaches to sampling, described in more detail in 
the following sections, are common in the research literature: 
random samples, stratifi ed samples, matched groups, volunteer 
samples, and qualitative sampling. Each one has different impli-
cations for the generalizability of the fi ndings (Henry, 1998).
Random Samples
In a random sample, each person in a given population has 
an equal chance of being included. The researcher may en-
sure equal opportunity by putting each person’s name on a 
slip of paper and then choosing some of the slips blindly, 
or by selecting names from a list at random, using num-
bers produced by a random number generator. The Kaiser 
Family Foundation study of media use by infants, toddlers, 
and preschoolers discussed in Chapter 7 is an example of a 
study that used a random sampling of households (Rideout, 
versions of truth, depending on the informant and the con-
text. Knowledge is not out there to be discovered; rather, it 
is invented, constructed, and continuously revised as one 
accumulates new information (Schwandt, 1998; Silverman, 
2010). The approach begins with a beginner’s mind. One 
looks at the world as if it were ripe for discovery. Theory 
typically emerges from the data, rather than guiding the 
methodology and data collection. When evidence is gath-
ered that contradicts the theory, the theory is rejected or 
modifi ed. Multiple methods are employed in order to learn 
as much as possible about the setting, the participants, and 
the contexts of behavior. In some instances, the observer’s 
own experiences and beliefs are included as a guide to the 
meaningfulness of the observation. In other instances, the 
observer attempts to challenge a personal point of view by 
gathering as many different perspectives about the process 
as possible. Because qualitative inquiry assumes that there 
is not one truth, all perspectives and insights are considered 
equally valid. A major emphasis is on interpretation, made 
possible by the close acquaintance of the researcher with the 
details and voices of the participants.
In the study of human development, both positivist and 
qualitative inquiry are applied, often as complementary 
approaches to the same issue. The idea is that generaliza-
tions and categories used in the positivist approach can 
be reframed or refi ned using data from qualitative inquiry. 
Assumptions from the positivist perspective may be chal-
lenged by observations made through qualitative inquiry. 
For example, many children who live in households that 
may be characterized as female-headed, single-parent fami-
lies actually have fathers, uncles, and grandfathers who par-
ticipate actively in their daily lives, and many children who 
live in households that may be characterized as two-parent 
families actually have little daily contact with their fathers. 
Categories and defi nitions that are assumed to be meaning-
ful from a positivist perspective are often shown to be more 
ambiguous or diversely defi ned when considered through 
the qualitative lens.
Research Design
Regardless of whether the positivist or qualitative approach 
is used, each empirical study needs to be designed. Research 
investigations are designed just as cars, bridges, and build-
ings are designed. Research design is often conducted in 
meetings where small groups of scholars try to think up the 
most appropriate approach for answering their questions. 
Scientists know that the information they gain from conduct-
ing research will be infl uenced by the characteristics of the 
participants who are involved in their study, the kind of data 
that are gathered, and the conditions under which the data 
are gathered. The principles of research design focus on the 
approach to selecting a sample, the methods used to gather 
information, the design for studying change, and the tech-
niques used to analyze the data (Gliner & Morgan, 2000).

 
Research Design | A-5
Vandewater, & Wartella, 2003). The study was a random, 
national telephone survey of families with children ages 6 
months to 6 years old. The parent who spent the most time 
with the child was asked to complete the survey.
Stratifi ed Samples
In a stratifi ed sampling approach, participants are deliber-
ately selected from a variety of levels (strata) or subgroups 
within the population. For example, one study used a strati-
fi ed, random sample to examine the care received from fam-
ily members by African American and European American 
adults ages 65 and older who lived in their own homes. The 
sample groups were selected in proportion to their numbers 
in the community. Within the African American and Euro-
pean American groups, participants were selected at random 
(Peek, Coward, & Peek, 2000).
Matched Groups
The researcher can also select two or more groups of par-
ticipants who are similar on many dimensions. In most 
studies using matched groups, participants in one group re-
ceive some type of treatment or participate in some type of 
experimental intervention that the participants in the other 
group do not receive or participate in. In other studies, the 
impact of a naturally occurring difference is examined. For 
example, a matched group design was used to study the im-
pact of low birth weight on later middle school performance. 
At age 11, children who had weighed less than 750 grams 
(1.65 pounds) at birth were compared to children who had 
weighed 750 to 1400 grams (1.65 to 3.08 pounds) and to 
children of normal birth weight. The groups were matched 
on age, sex, and other background variables. The design al-
lowed researchers to evaluate the long-term risks for very 
small babies (Taylor, Klein, Minich, & Hack, 2000).
Volunteer Samples
Participants can be solicited by asking people directly, plac-
ing advertisements in newspapers or on bulletin boards, 
sending letters to teachers or parents asking for participants, 
or writing to professionals or groups of potential partici-
pants. Those who are included in the study are selected from 
among those who volunteer. Most studies that are con-
ducted with students enrolled in introductory psychology 
courses involve volunteer samples. Although the students 
may be required to participate in research, they have a choice 
about which study they will volunteer for. In some sense, all 
research with human participants uses a volunteer sample. 
One cannot compel a person to participate in research.
The Qualitative Approach to Sampling
The primary objective of the qualitative approach to sam-
pling is to learn as much as possible from each informant. 
 Researchers enter a setting with some general idea of questions 
they seek to understand. The strategy is to remain open to the 
information that is provided. Researchers may learn that they 
cannot get information about the question they started out 
with. For example, in a study of institutional wards for people 
with severe and profound retardation, Taylor (1987) wanted 
to know about residents’ perspectives. However, many resi-
dents were nonverbal, and others were reticent to share their 
opinions. So Taylor shifted his attention to staff perspectives 
on the environment. Qualitative researchers emphasize that 
the informants should have the knowledge and experience 
that the researcher requires, be able to refl ect and verbalize 
about the experiences, and be willing to participate in the 
study (Morse, 1998). The number of informants or settings 
in which research occurs is not decided in advance. Typically, 
the greater the depth and detail in each case, the fewer cases 
will be included. Additional cases are added as needed until 
the researcher believes that the variety of perspectives within 
a setting has been captured and the theoretical insights are 
well confi rmed (Taylor & Bogdan, 1998).
Strengths and Weaknesses of Approaches 
to Sampling
What are some of the strengths and weaknesses of different 
approaches to sampling? Random sampling and stratified 
sampling are the most likely to ensure that a sample is repre-
sentative of the population from which it is drawn. If each per-
son in the population has an equal chance of being included 
in a study, then the outcome or results of the study ought to be 
equally likely to apply to those in the population who did not 
participate as to those who did. These sampling approaches 
are often used to provide statistical information about a pop-
ulation. They do not provide information about any specifi c 
person within the population. For example, the mean or arith-
metic average income of a group of 100 people may not be the 
exact income of any single person in the group.
The use of matched samples allows one to examine the 
impact of naturally occurring events—such as unemploy-
ment, parental divorce, or low birth weight—that cannot be 
randomly assigned. By matching participants on a variety 
of background factors, such as IQ, family income, or birth 
order, one might be able to detect the impact of these events 
on emotional, social, or cognitive development. However, 
critics argue that one cannot match groups perfectly, and 
one might omit an important variable for which there is no 
match. For example, in the study described earlier about the 
impact of low birth weight on school achievement, sibling 
order was not included in the match. Because we know that 
fi rstborns typically do better on tests of academic achieve-
ment than siblings born later, this factor might explain more 
about the outcome than birth weight.
The method that places the greatest limits on general-
ization is volunteer sampling. One never knows what type 
of person will volunteer to participate in social science 
research. Can you think of how reliance on volunteers may 
produce special problems? For example, imagine a study that 

A-6 | 
APPENDIX The Research Process
promises to pay $25 to those who participate. People who 
volunteer to participate in this research may be especially in 
need of money. Sometimes, volunteers have more free time, 
are hoping to fi nd some kind of help as a result of participat-
ing in the research, or have greater faith in science than those 
who choose not to volunteer.
Regardless of these difficulties, volunteer samples are 
widely used. Most of the studies cited in this textbook are 
based on volunteer samples. All studies involving observa-
tion, interview, or experimentation with children require 
formal consent from parents and could be classifi ed as vol-
unteer samples. Frequently, the only way to study a certain 
question is to ask for volunteers.
Some of the research findings discussed in this text are 
based on clinical samples. This usually means that the partici-
pants have been involved in some type of treatment program or 
are on a waiting list to receive clinical treatment. These studies 
are especially important for understanding the causes of clini-
cal conditions, the developmental paths or patterns that these 
conditions exhibit, or the impact of certain interventions on 
these conditions. Without voluntary participation, there would 
be no way to begin to document the effectiveness of treatment. 
At the same time, one must be cautious not to generalize fi nd-
ings from clinical studies to the population as a whole.
It will come as no surprise that the vast majority of stud-
ies reported in American journals are based on American 
samples. The U.S. population comprises only 5% of the world 
population. Thus, studies that presume to characterize normal 
development are limited to the extent that the results have 
not been repeated or confi rmed across countries and cultures 
(Arnett, 2008). As international communication improves and 
the use of the Internet supports international collaboration, 
we are hopeful that cross-national research will increase.
Similarly, many studies of development during the period 
that we refer to as later adolescence are carried out with col-
lege students. Since roughly one third of later adolescents 
do not attend college, the results of these studies cannot be 
accurately generalized to the non-college population.
From a qualitative perspective, the best informants are 
those who willingly volunteer to share their experiences and 
refl ect on them. If the informant is providing an authentic, 
open narrative, then insights can be drawn. Each informant’s 
perspective is treated as one way of making meaning of the sit-
uation. The researcher’s job is to try to build a complex picture 
of the topic by comparing the views of multiple informants.
Research Methods
A variety of methods have been used to study development. 
Each one has its strengths and weaknesses, allowing the in-
vestigator to focus on one set of behaviors at the expense 
of others. The choice of method must fi t the problem un-
der study. Six general categories of developmental research 
are described here: observation, case study, interviews, surveys, 
tests, and experimentation. These methods have all contrib-
uted to the discovery of knowledge, and as you read further, 
you will fi nd examples of each method. Some techniques—
especially observation, case study, and interviews—are more 
commonly used in qualitative inquiry as investigators try to 
uncover basic themes or dimensions of a problem. Other 
methods—especially observation using a predetermined 
coding scheme, experimentation, structured interviews, sur-
veys, and tests—tend to be used in the positivist approach to 
the research process.
Observation
One might argue that at the heart of all science is  observation—
taking note of events and trying to make sense of them (Adler 
& Adler, 1998). Direct observation of children in their 
home and school environments is one of the oldest meth-
ods for studying development (Kessen, 1965). Researchers 
have used mothers’ diaries and observation logs to gather 
information about behavior in intimate settings that could 
not be known in any other way. Jean Piaget was guided by 
the observations of his own children in the formulation of 
his theory of cognition. Today, some researchers conduct 
observations in homes, schools, and day care centers where 
children typically spend their time. Others bring children 
and their families or friends into homelike laboratory set-
tings, where they can watch children’s behaviors under more 
constant and controlled physical conditions (Kochanska, 
 Murray, & Harlan, 2000).
Naturalistic Observation. Naturalistic observation refers 
to research in which behavior in a setting is carefully ob-
served without any other kinds of manipulation. This type of 
observation, sometimes referred to as ethnography, provides 
insight about how things occur in the real world (Fetterman, 
2010). In some instances, researchers go into a setting to 
observe the full range of interactions and behavior patterns. 
Based on their fi eld notes, they begin to develop hypotheses 
or tentative explanations about the meaning of the behaviors. 
Then, they may test these hypotheses through more focused 
observation or through controlled experimentation. In other 
instances, researchers use observation to examine a specifi c 
behavior or relationship. They may be looking for different 
forms of peer aggression, patterns of social cooperation, or 
conditions that promote cross-gender interactions. In these 
cases, the observers limit the scope of their observations to 
behaviors that are relevant to their concerns.
Participant Observation. A major methodological ap-
proach in qualitative inquiry is participant observation, in 
which the researcher actively engages in interactions with 
other members of a setting. This is done in order to gain a 
new understanding of how people in that setting experience 
the world or how the processes that take place in that setting 
might apply to broader issues such as socialization, control, or 
self-construction. To engage in this type of work, one must fi rst 
obtain access to the setting and then gain the trust of the other 
people in the setting. Some participant observation takes place 

 
Research Design | A-7
in public settings, such as parks, street corners, pool halls, or 
train stations, where the researcher can be accepted as a non-
threatening participant. Even in these situations, it may take 
time for people to interact with the observer or be willing to 
confi de in him or her. In Elliot Liebow’s (1967, 2003) famous 
study of Black street-corner men, Tally’s Corner, Liebow met 
his primary informant, Tally, while playing with a puppy out-
side a carryout restaurant. The friendship he formed with Tally 
led to introductions to other men on the street.
The participant observer usually gathers data through 
fi eld notes, which are made after an observational session. 
Over time, the skilled observer learns to retain information 
about the details of a session and to record it in a systematic 
way. This is a very demanding process; it may take several 
hours to summarize what was observed in a single hour in 
the fi eld. In addition to the observations, the researcher tries 
to capture his or her own reactions to the situation, using 
personal feelings and responses as a way of empathizing with 
the participants. In a study of a mental institution, Taylor 
made the following fi eld notes:
O.C. [observer’s comments]: Although I don’t show it, I 
tense up when the residents approach me when they’re 
covered with food or excrement. Maybe this is what the 
attendants feel and why they often treat the residents as 
lepers. (Taylor & Bogdan, 1998, p. 73)
One of the challenges in participant observation is to 
check out and confi rm one’s insights from observation by 
comparing them with information drawn from other sources. 
This is especially important the more involved one becomes 
in the setting and the more attached one grows to the partici-
pants. This confi rmatory approach is called triangulation, and 
it can be achieved by looking at written documents about the 
setting, interviewing other informants, and sharing observa-
tions with other members of a research team. This is often 
done toward the end of the study, as the researcher is prepar-
ing to leave the fi eld (Taylor & Bogdan, 1998).
Correlation. Observational studies lend themselves to an 
examination of correlation rather than causation. Correlation 
refers to a statistical analysis of the strength and direction 
of the relationships among variables. It refl ects the degree to 
which knowing the value of one variable, such as popularity, 
allows one to predict the level of another variable, such as 
aggressiveness.
The correlation coefficient is a numeric index of the 
strength of relationship between variables that can range from 
a value of +1.0 to −1.0. Let us take as an example the correla-
tion between popularity with peers and aggressiveness. If, as 
popularity increases, so does aggressiveness, the correlation 
is positive (between 0 and +1.0). If, as popularity increases, 
aggressiveness decreases, the correlation is negative (between 
0 and −1.0). If there is no systematic relationship between 
aggressiveness and popularity, the correlation is close to 0 
(see Figure A.2). A correlation of .40 suggests that there is a 
positive relationship between aggressiveness and popularity, 
but that aggressiveness cannot be predicted entirely or even 
predominantly by knowing about a person’s popularity.
A strong correlation between two variables shows only 
that there is an association between them. It does not pro-
vide information about causation. Knowing that aggression 
is negatively correlated with popularity does not necessarily 
mean that being aggressive causes children to be rejected by 
peers. It could be that some other factor, such as mistrust of 
others, accounts for both aggression and peer rejection.
Strengths and Limitations of the Observational 
Method. Many scholars agree that direct observation is an 
ideal way to study behavior (Bakeman, 2000). It avoids the 
interpretive issues that are raised when one asks people to 
report on their behavior, and it allows for the documenta-
tion of patterns of behavior that may not have been antici-
pated by the investigator. For example, in studying patterns 
of dominance among children, one might assume that hitting 
is a form of dominance. However, in observing play behav-
ior, one may fi nd that certain kinds of hitting are a type of 
affectionate interaction rather than a mechanism for achiev-
ing dominance. Another strength of observation is the abil-
ity to allow participants’ behaviors to guide the researcher’s 
conceptualization. Rather than setting up a specifi c task or 
group of questions and having people respond, the observer 
examines the full range of relevant behaviors and builds an 
interpretation of the meaning of the events from the patterns 
that have been observed.

APPENDIX The Research Process
Observational research also has weaknesses. It is often dif-
fi cult to establish agreement among observers about exactly 
what occurred. Think about the times that you and a friend 
have been in the same situation but have entirely different 
reactions to what is happening or describe it very differently 
to a third party. Typically, two or more observers’ codings of 
the same situation are compared to determine whether dif-
ferent observers interpreted the same event in the same way. 
This is called interobserver reliability. When interobserver 
reliability is high, one has confi dence that all the observers 
are describing or coding the events in the same way. When 
interobserver reliability is low, the researchers must deter-
mine why and then correct the differences in observation 
techniques. This may result in changing the category scheme 
so that it is easier to link each behavior with a category, or it 
may result in more training, so that the observers know more 
precisely how to code each behavior.
Another diffi culty with the observational method occurs 
when so much activity is taking place that it is diffi cult to 
select specifi c behaviors or to code fast enough to keep up 
with the pace of activity in the setting. The technology of 
video recording has helped address this problem. A video 
record can be reviewed over and over again. Several observ-
ers can watch a video, stop it, and discuss what they saw. 
The same events can be observed from several points of view. 
Video records allow one to track the sequences of interac-
tion, turn taking, and the formation of cycles of interac-
tion among family members, which often occur too subtly 
or quickly to be captured by direct observation (Johnson, 
Cowan, & Cowan, 1999; Heath, 2010).
Some research focuses on a particular kind of behavior or 
behavioral sequence, such as helping behavior, peer rejection, 
or confl ict. In naturalistic observation, one cannot be assured 
that the behavior of interest will take place during the obser-
vational period. Finally, some researchers fear that the pres-
ence of the observer or the introduction of audio recording or 
videotaping equipment, or even note taking, may change the 
nature of the behaviors that take place in the setting. Although 
there are techniques to limit the impact of the observer on the 
setting, this is always a concern in direct observation.
Case Study
A case study is an in-depth description of a single person, 
family, social group, or social setting. The purpose of a case 
study may be to illuminate something very particular and 
interesting about the person or organization being studied, 
illustrate a general principle by providing specifi c details, ex-
amine a phenomenon that does not conform to theoretical 
predictions, or stimulate theory development in an area that 
has not been investigated (Yin, 2009).
Some case studies document the lives of great individuals. 
In Gandhi’s Truth, Erikson (1969) provided a psychosocial 
analysis of the life of Mahatma Gandhi. Erikson considered 
Gandhi’s childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood as 
they contributed to his personality, his moral philosophy, 
and to the contradictions between his personal relationships 
and his role as a powerful social leader.
Case studies can also focus on social groups, families, 
and organizations. One of Anna Freud’s most famous cases 
described the attachments that developed among a group of 
orphans who had lived together in a concentration camp dur-
ing World War II (Freud & Dann, 1951). The study focused 
on the strong feelings the children had for one another and 
their strategies for maintaining their sense of connectedness 
once they were placed in a more normal social environment. 
The case illustrated a unique phenomenon—the intense 
emotional attachment of young children to each other—that 
had not been documented before.
Case studies can be based on a variety of sources of infor-
mation, including interviews, therapy sessions, prolonged 
observation, diaries or journals, letters, historical documents, 
and talks with people who know the subject of the study. 
The researcher usually spends a great deal of time with the 
subject of the case, in conversation, observation, and gather-
ing information from documents and informants in order to 
fully understand what is happening. In addition to gathering 
information, the researcher engages in ongoing refl ection in 
order to reach a new depth of insight about the case.
Strengths and Limitations of the Case Study Method. 
Case studies have the advantage of illustrating the complex-
ity and uniqueness of the subject. They capture the inter-
play of complex, dynamic processes. Studies carried out with 
large samples often identify general principles, whereas case 
studies provide concrete examples of how these principles 
play out in the lives of specifi c individuals or groups. Some 
cases give the details of an experience that is rare and might 
not be captured in a large-scale study. Sometimes, the case 
study brings a problem to the attention of researchers, who 
then pursue it through other methods. Although case studies 
cannot provide the basis for broad generalizations, they can 
provide specifi c examples of instances where a broad gener-
alization does not hold true. Throughout this book, you will 
fi nd case study material that is intended to help you apply 
concepts from the text to specifi c examples and to serve as 
points of refl ection about the relevance of human develop-
ment content for understanding individuals’ life stories.
Case studies have been criticized as unscientifi c. In the 
first place, they are obviously not representative of large 
groups of individuals. One must be cautious about general-
izing the conclusions drawn from a case study to other indi-
viduals or groups. Moreover, if the information that provides 
the basis of the case study is gathered in a biased or subjec-
tive way, then the results or conclusions of the study will be 
of little worth. Of course, this criticism applies to any type 
of research. Finally, critics argue that there is no reliability in 
case studies. If different people were writing a case study on 
the same individual, they might come up with very different 
views of the events and their signifi cance.
These limitations suggest that one must have a very clear 
idea of the study’s purpose and a systematic approach to 

 
Research Design | A-9
gathering information in order to conduct case studies that 
meet the standards of scientific observation. At the same 
time, vividly written, compelling case material has had a 
consistent impact in stimulating theory and research in the 
fi eld of development. In some instances, the lucid recount-
ing of case material is more convincing to policymakers than 
the results of studies based on large, national samples.
Interviews
Many case studies are based largely on face-to-face inter-
views. The interview method can also be used to gather data 
from large numbers of individuals and from people in clini-
cal settings. Interviews can be highly structured, almost like 
a verbal survey, or very open ended, allowing the participant 
to respond freely to a series of general questions. There are at 
least three common uses of in-depth interviewing (Roulston, 
2010). First, the life history or personal narrative allows the 
researcher to learn about a person’s key life experiences and 
the meaning of those experiences. The researcher’s role is to 
encourage the person being interviewed to cover all the im-
portant issues and to foster elaboration and refl ection.
Second, through interviews, informants are asked to 
describe in detail events that occurred when the researcher 
was not present. This might be a historical event, a natural 
disaster, or the behaviors of a group to which the researcher 
does not have access. For example, a researcher may want 
to interview informants who have been members of a gang 
about the gang’s initiation rites or practices. Third, inter-
views can be useful in gathering information from a number 
of people about a similar topic. For example, Harrington and 
Boardman (2000) interviewed 100 people they called path-
makers—people who achieved career success despite grow-
ing up in impoverished families and communities.
The success of the interview method depends heavily on 
the skill of the interviewer. Interviewers are trained to be 
nonjudgmental as they listen to a participant’s responses. 
They try to create rapport with the participant by convey-
ing a feeling of trustworthiness and acceptance. The goal, 
especially in qualitative interviewing, is to create a conver-
sational atmosphere where the person feels at ease to talk. In 
unstructured interviews, the interviewer must make use of 
this rapport to encourage the participant to say more about a 
topic and to share thoughts that may be private or personal. 
Matching the race and gender of the interviewer and the par-
ticipant being interviewed has been found to help foster rap-
port and improve the quality of the data that are produced.
The interview method has traditionally been associated 
with clinical research; however, it is becoming a common 
method in the study of cognition and language as well. 
Piaget’s structured interview technique (Piaget, 1929) pro-
vides a model for the investigation of conceptual develop-
ment. The researcher who uses this technique asks a child 
a question (e.g., “Are clouds living or dead?”), and then fol-
lows up on the child’s answer with questions about how 
the child arrived at his or her conclusion. In other studies, 
Piaget asked children to solve a problem, and then asked 
them to explain how they arrived at the solution. The child 
becomes an informant about his or her own conceptual 
capacities. This approach has been adapted in the study of 
moral development, interpersonal development, and posi-
tive, helping behavior.
Strengths and Limitations of the Interview Method. 
The interview method has the advantage of allowing individ-
uals to contribute their own views on the topic being studied. 
They can tell the interviewer what is important to them, why 
they might choose one alternative over another, or what they 
think is wrong with the investigator’s view of the situation. 
Interviews have the advantage of expediency when it might 
be diffi cult to gain access to a setting for observation or when 
one wants to gather information from a larger number of par-
ticipants, rather than observing just a few.
There are also limitations to the interview method. Par-
ticipants may present themselves in the way they want the 
interviewer to see them; when they do, they are said to be 
exhibiting a self-presentation bias. Research has suggested 
that young children’s responses are especially vulnerable to 
infl uence by the interviewer. By smiling, nodding, frowning, 
or looking away, the interviewer can deliberately or inadver-
tently communicate approval or disapproval. There is a fi ne 
line between establishing rapport and infl uencing responses.
Another limitation of interviews is that people may not 
be aware of all the factors that infl uence their behaviors or 
decisions. Thus, in asking people about their lives and why 
they behave as they do, one is limited to the person’s level 
of sensitivity and insight into their own situation. Whereas 
one might see certain forces at work through participant 
observation, relying solely on interviews limits the research-
ers’ access to contextual factors that may infl uence a person’s 
behavior (Taylor & Bogdan, 1998).
Surveys and Tests
Survey research is a means of collecting specifi c information 
from a large number of participants (Fowler, 2009). If people 
are to respond directly to surveys, they must be able to read 
and write, unless the survey questions are read to them. The 
survey method is, therefore, most commonly used with par-
ticipants in middle childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. 
However, survey information about infants and toddlers is 
often collected from parents, child care workers, physicians, 
nurses, and others who are responsible for meeting the needs 
of young children. Thus, surveys have contributed a great 
deal to our knowledge about the way adults perceive the be-
haviors and needs of young children.
Survey methods can be used to collect information about 
attitudes (“Do you believe teachers should be permitted to 
use corporal punishment with their students?”), current 
behaviors and practices (“How many hours per day do you 
watch television?”), aspirations (“What do you hope to do 
when you graduate from high school?”), and perceptions 

A-10 | 
APPENDIX The Research Process
(“How well does your mother/father or son/daughter under-
stand your views?”).
Survey questions are prepared in a standard form, and the 
responses are usually coded according to a prearranged set of 
categories. In well-designed surveys, the questions are stated 
clearly and offer response choices that are not ambiguous or 
overlapping. In the most powerful surveys, the sample of 
respondents is carefully selected to be representative of the 
population under study. Surveys may be conducted by tele-
phone, through the mail, on the Internet, in classrooms, at 
work, or in the participants’ homes (Fowler, 1993).
Tests are often similar in form to surveys. They con-
sist of groups of questions or problems that the person is 
expected to answer. Usually, tests are designed to measure 
a specifi c ability or characteristic. You are no doubt familiar 
with the kinds of tests typically given in school. You are pre-
sented with a group of items and asked to produce the cor-
rect answer or select the correct answer from among several 
choices. Intelligence and achievement tests are of this nature. 
A researcher might give these tests along with some other 
measures in order to learn how intelligence relates to social 
life, emotions, or self-understanding.
Other tests are designed to measure specifi c psychologi-
cal constructs such as creativity, conformity, depression, or 
extroversion. Some tests are administered to assess whether a 
person has some form of mental illness, learning disorder, or 
developmental or physical disability.
Psychological tests must be reliable and valid to be use-
ful. Tests are reliable when the results are consistent. A per-
son who takes a reliable test on 2 consecutive days should 
get approximately the same score on both days, unless some 
deliberate training or intervention has been introduced 
between test sessions. There ought to be a positive correla-
tion (between 0 and +1.0) between the two scores.
Tests are valid when they measure what they claim to 
measure. The people who design the tests have to define 
what it is they are trying to measure. They also have to pro-
vide evidence that their test really measures this construct 
(Ray, 1993). For example, when designing a test to measure 
self-esteem, one should first consider, “What is meant by 
self-esteem?” and “What type of questions or tasks would 
provide evidence of self-esteem?” Consider the various tests 
that have been designed to measure intelligence in infants 
and very young children. The results of these tests are not 
very closely related to the results of tests of intelligence given 
in adolescence and adulthood (Slater, Carrick, Bell, & Rob-
erts, 1999). In other words, correlations between intelligence 
tests given to infants and those given to the same individuals 
when they are older tend to be low (nearer to 0.0 than to 
+1.0 or –1.0). Why is this? One explanation is that the infant 
tests are not really tests of broad, adaptive intelligence, but 
measures of sensory processing and central nervous system 
coordination. As children get older, their symbolic capaci-
ties and acquired knowledge expand. As a result, they rely 
less on sensory processing and more on interpretation and 
experience to guide meaning making and problem solving.
Strengths and Limitations of Surveys and Tests. 
Surveys and tests have certain advantages that make them 
widely used in developmental research. They allow the com-
parison of responses by large groups of respondents. Surveys 
and tests have been designed to address a wide variety of 
topics. With a prearranged coding or scoring system, many 
tests can be administered and evaluated without the exten-
sive training that is usually necessary with participant obser-
vation or interview methods.
This method also has limitations. Some surveys create 
attitudes where none existed before. This is referred to as the 
reactive nature of surveys. For example, you might ask sixth-
grade children questions about their satisfaction with their 
school curriculum. The students may answer a lot of ques-
tions on this topic, even though they had not given much 
thought to the issue before. Thus, reading the questions and 
response options on a survey may help participants formu-
late their opinions (Wilson, LaFleur, & Anderson, 1996).
Another problem is the gap between answers to survey 
questions or scores on tests and actual behavior. Parents may 
respond to a survey by indicating that they allow their chil-
dren to participate in family decisions, but when it comes to 
real family decisions, they may not give their children much 
voice. Some survey questions are more difficult for some 
respondents to answer accurately than others. For example, 
consider the following question: How often did you go for 
medical treatment over the past 6 months? It would be eas-
ier for a person who went only once to respond accurately 
and with confi dence than for a person who went six or eight 
times (Mathiowetz, 1999).
Experimentation
Experimentation is a method best suited for examining 
causal relationships. In an experiment, some variable or 
group of variables is systematically manipulated to exam-
ine the effect on an outcome. For example, in research on 
memory among older adults, the complexity of the material 
and the speed of presentation are varied in order to learn 
more about how these factors infl uence the ability of adults 
to recall information. The factor (or factors) manipulated by 
the experimenter is called the independent variable. The 
dimension of the participant’s responses or reactions that is 
measured is the dependent variable. The research is carried 
out to determine whether the independent variable or some 
combination of independent variables can produce a change 
in the dependent variable.
In some experiments, one group of participants has a 
certain set of experiences or receives information (usually 
referred to as a treatment) that is not provided to another 
group. The group that experiences the experimenter’s manip-
ulation is called the experimental group. The group that 
does not experience the treatment or manipulation is called 
the control group. Differences in behavior between the two 
groups are then attributed to the treatment. For example, 
in a study of academic performance in human develop-

ment courses, students enrolled in a course would be ran-
domly assigned to the experimental group, in which they are 
linked as a study group through email, so they can contact 
one another, discuss questions from the course, and share 
their ideas. The other students, who are in the control group, 
do not receive this Internet support. Differences in course 
grades between the experimental and the control groups 
would be attributed to the Internet intervention.
In other experiments, the behavior of a single group of 
participants is compared before and after a treatment or 
across several treatments. Once again, systematic differences 
in behavior before and after the treatment are attributed to 
the experimental manipulation. In this case, each participant 
serves as his or her own control.
Control is the key to successful experimentation. The 
experimenter must exercise control in selecting the children 
or families who participate in a study. The participants must 
be able to bring equivalent competencies to the situation. If 
this condition is not met, one cannot assume that differences 
in behavior between groups are due to the treatment.
Experimenters control the way a task is presented to the 
participants so that such factors as the ability to understand 
the instructions, the order of events, and the degree of com-
fort and familiarity with the setting do not interfere with the 
participants’ behavior. Control ensures that changes in behav-
ior do, in fact, result from the experimental manipulation.
Many studies in human development are quasi- 
experimental. This means that the treatment was not con-
trolled by the experimenter but was the result of some pattern 
of life events (Wilson, 1995). Suppose we are interested in 
the impact of unemployment on conflict between married 
couples. We cannot (nor do we want to) cause some adults to 
lose their jobs while others remain employed. We can, how-
ever, compare couples of about the same age and social class 
who have experienced unemployment with couples who have 
not. In these studies, assignment to a treatment occurs as a 
result of real-world events. One would select participants for 
the study who are as much alike as possible in other respects, 
except for their encounters with unemployment. It is the task 
of the researcher to compare some of the consequences of this 
treatment—the experience of unemployment—and to address 
the limitations that are imposed on the results because of how 
individuals come to be in one group or the other.
Strengths and Limitations of the Experimental 
Method. The experimental method has the advantage of 
providing conclusions about causal relationships. If the re-
sults suggest that the participants’ behavior changes only 
when something about the experimental situation changes, 
we can conclude that the manipulation has caused the chang-
es in behavior. This is a very powerful statement, particularly 
as we search for explanations for how conditions that occur 
early in development might infl uence later outcomes.
Experiments also have limitations. Despite careful control, 
one cannot entirely rule out factors that can interfere with 
the impact of the treatment or that infl uence the respondents 
in ways that were not anticipated (Ray, 1993). For example, 
in a study of the impact of exposure to television violence, 
participants may have seen a televised documentary about 
the topic on the day before they came to participate in the 
research. In a study involving repeated observations, the par-
ticipants might talk with each other about the study between 
testing sessions, thus infl uencing their responses. Any factor 
occurring outside the specifi c design of the study that infl u-
ences the participants’ responses is a threat to the internal 
validity or meaningfulness of the experiment.
Experiments may also be challenged on the basis of 
their external validity. We cannot be certain how appli-
cable a controlled laboratory situation is to the real world. 
Would the behaviors that are observed in the laboratory also 
be observed at home, at school, or at work? For example, 
through studies of infant attachment (discussed in Chapter 5) 
we have learned that infants and young children do not 
behave the same way in the presence of their mothers as 
they do when their mothers are absent. Thus, experimental 
research conducted with children that does not allow their 
mothers to be present may produce behaviors that differ in 
quantity, quality, and sequence from the behavior that would 
be observed under conditions when the mothers are present.
Experimental studies suggest that event A causes response 
B. In many domains of development, however, a multifac-
eted, reciprocal process promotes change. Think a moment 
about the development of friendship. A friendship depends 
on so many domains and on the fi t or lack of fi t along each 
domain for the two people. Friendships may be infl uenced 
by physical appearance, abilities, temperaments, intelligence, 
family background, whether others support the friendship 
or ridicule it, and so on. Friendships are sustained and pro-
moted by continuous feedback and interaction among the 
friends rather than by one or two factors that could be said to 
promote or inhibit friendship. Experiments tend to suggest a 
unidirectional, causal explanation for behaviors that may be 
more accurately described using an interactional model.
Advantages and disadvantages of the fi ve research meth-
ods are summarized in Table A.1.
Designs for Studying 
Development
The primary concern of developmental research is to de-
scribe and account for patterns of continuity and change 
over time. We want to describe patterns of change and differ-
ences in these patterns across individuals, and to account for 
why groups of individuals who have been exposed to similar 
life situations differ from one another as they age. This is a 
very challenging task, which requires strategies for consider-
ing changing individuals in changing environments (Miller, 
2007). Four major research approaches have been created for 
examining development: retrospective studies, cross- sectional 
studies,  longitudinal studies, and cohort sequential studies.

A-12 | 
APPENDIX The Research Process
Retrospective Studies
A researcher engaged in a retrospective study asks the partici-
pants to report on experiences from an earlier time in their lives. 
Many early studies of childrearing used parents’ recollections 
of their parenting techniques to evaluate their patterns of child 
care. Researchers who studied the effects of stress during preg-
nancy often asked women to recall their emotional state before, 
during, and after their child was born. Investigators of personal-
ity development use retrospective data by asking adolescent or 
adult subjects to recall important events of their childhood.
This approach produces a record of what a person has 
retained of past events. We cannot be certain that these 
events really occurred as they are remembered or, for that 
matter, whether they occurred at all. Piaget (1951) described 
a vivid memory from his second year of life:
I was sitting in my pram, which my nurse was pushing 
in the Champs Elysées, when a man tried to kidnap me. 
I was held in by the strap fastened around me while my 
nurse bravely tried to stand between me and the thief. She 
received various scratches, and I can still see vaguely those 
on her face. (p. 188)
Thirteen years later, when Piaget was 15, the nurse joined a 
religious order. She wrote to his parents and returned a watch 
they had given her for protecting Jean from the kidnapper. She 
confessed that she had made up the story, even to the point 
of scratching her own face. Piaget believed he had created the 
visual memory from the story his parents had told him about 
the incident.
The passage of time may change the signifi cance of certain 
past events in a person’s memory. As we gain new levels of 
cognitive complexity or change our attitudes, we reorganize 
our memories of the past so as to bring them into line with our 
current level of understanding (Kotre, 1995b). Sometimes, peo-
ple claim to have recovered memories of past events that have 
been long forgotten or repressed. It is diffi cult to determine 
the accuracy of these memories (Loftus, 1993). They may be 
entangled with current experiences or with ideas taken from 
books, movies, or conversations with others. They may be 
altered by the suggestion that something happened that actu-
ally did not, or by the suggestion that something did not hap-
pen that actually did. Because memory is so easily modifi ed by 
suggestion, its usefulness in uncovering systematic data about 
the past is limited. However, retrospective data provide insight 
into how people make sense of their past and the role they 
give to past experiences in determining their present way of 
thinking. Studies that use the technique of life review provide 
insight into the way adults organize and structure key periods 
and events from their life history (McAdams et al., 1997).
Cross-Sectional Studies
Studies that compare people of different ages, social back-
grounds, or from different school or community settings are 
called cross-sectional studies. Such studies are quite com-
mon in research on child development. Investigators may 
compare children at different levels of biological maturity or 
different chronological ages to learn how a particular devel-
opmental domain changes with age. Most studies of cognitive

development discussed in Chapter 8, especially those that 
consider the shift from one type of reasoning to another, use 
the cross-sectional approach. They present children of dif-
ferent ages with the same kind of problem and then note 
differences in their approach to explaining and solving the 
problem. The main limitation of the cross-sectional method is 
that it measures group differences, not patterns of individual 
change over time. Often, however, these group differences are 
interpreted to suggest a pattern of development. With respect 
to studies on cognitive problem solving, the cross-sectional 
approach tells us that most 12-year-olds are more fl exible in 
their reasoning than most 7-year-olds. It does not tell us how 
the same children actually change from the time they are 7 
until they are 12, nor how the children who were most fl ex-
ible at age 7 would perform at age 12 in comparison with 
those who were the least fl exible.
Longitudinal Studies
A longitudinal study involves repeated observations of the 
same participants at different times. The time between ob-
servations may be brief, as from immediately after birth to 2 
or 3 days after birth. Observations may be repeated over the 
entire life course, as in Leo Terman’s longitudinal study of 
gifted children (Terman & Oden, 1947, 1959; Sears & Bar-
bee, 1978; Holahan, Sears, & Cronbach, 1995).
Longitudinal studies have the advantage of tracking the 
course of development of a particular group of individuals. 
We can discover how certain characteristics of children in 
infancy or toddlerhood relate to those same characteristics 
when the individuals reach adolescence or adulthood. We 
can also learn whether certain qualities of childhood, such 
as intelligence or outgoingness, are related to overall social 
adjustment or life satisfaction in later years. Longitudinal 
studies permit us to trace intra-individual patterns over 
time—that is, how individuals change, for example, from the 
use of one-word expressions to two-word phrases. They also 
allow us to monitor changes in groups, for example, by com-
paring adults who have children in their early twenties to 
those who remain childfree and looking at their economic or 
occupational attainment by midlife (Schaie, 1994).
Longitudinal studies may be diffi cult to complete, espe-
cially if they are intended to cover a signifi cant time period, 
such as the years from childhood to adulthood. Over this 
span of time, participants may drop out of the study, the 
investigators may lose funding or interest in the project, or 
the methods may become outdated. Questions that once 
seemed important may no longer be seen as vital. Another 
limitation is that repeated interactions with the participants 
may infl uence their behaviors. In other words, participation 
in the study could itself become a factor in their develop-
ment. One of the greatest limitations of longitudinal studies 
is that they focus on only one generation or cohort of par-
ticipants. Imagine studying the academic achievement and 
occupational attainment of a group of children born in 1980. 
Historical and social factors that may infl uence the course 
of this group’s development will be inextricably intertwined 
in the observations. One cannot tell if people growing up at 
other times in history would exhibit the pattern of changes 
that characterize this particular group.
Cohort Sequential Studies
A cohort sequential design combines the cross-sectional 
and longitudinal approaches into one method of study 
(Schaie, 1965, 1992). Groups of participants, called cohorts, 
are selected because they are a certain number of years apart 
in age. For example, we might begin with three groups of ad-
olescents who are 11, 14, and 17, respectively. Every 3 years, 
these groups would be interviewed until the 11-year-olds 
have turned 17. Every 3 years, a new group of 11-year-olds 
would be added to the study. This combination of a longitu-
dinal and cross-sectional design is a powerful developmen-
tal research method. It produces immediate cross-sectional 
data, longitudinal data after 3 and 6 years, and a comparison 
of children who were the same age (11, 14, or 17) at three 
different times. This third comparison permits us to identify 
social and historical factors that may infl uence age-related 
differences. This comparison also allows us to control for 
the possible impact of repeated measurement on the partici-
pants. Chapter 13 includes the results of a cohort sequential 
study of adult intellectual ability.
Comparisons of cohorts over long periods of time provide 
a way of controlling for the many historical factors—such 
as access to schooling, health, medical treatment, and nutri-
tion—that might infl uence intellectual performance, sepa-
rating these factors from age-related changes. The elements 
of a cohort sequential design are shown in Figure A.3. One 
drawback to the cohort sequential design is that data analysis 
requires more complex techniques in which time of response 
and frequency of response can both be included.
Evaluating Existing Research
In addition to collecting new data, social scientists devote 
considerable scholarly effort to reviewing and evaluating ex-
isting research. As a student, you may be asked to review 
research fi ndings on a topic of interest to you. You will prob-
ably rely on online databases, such as InfoTrac College Edi-
tion, EBSCOHOST, PsychInfo, or the Social Science Citation 
Index, to find books, book chapters, and journal articles 
relevant to your topic. These sources provide information 
from published sources, most of which have undergone a 
peer  review process. This means that other professionals 
have read and critically evaluated the materials before they 
were published. You may also fi nd information using Inter-
net search engines like Google or Bing. Internet resources are 
of a much more varied nature, including Web pages from 
professionals, reports of research institutes and centers, 
government documents, and ideas from teachers, students, 
and others who have opinions on the topic. The challenge 

A-14 | 
APPENDIX The Research Process
in reviewing all this information is to apply a standard for 
judging its quality and validity as you formulate your own 
analysis of the topic.
Most researchers use this method of reading and review-
ing the research of others to keep well informed about the 
research in their subject area. They analyze the work of oth-
ers to generate new questions and to formulate well-founded 
conclusions about issues in their fi eld of specialization. The 
study, analysis, and evaluation of current research literature 
constitute special skills in their own right (Fink, 2010).
Increasingly, websites provide information for research-
ers and report results of research. Because of the open access 
nature of the Web, there is no guarantee about the quality 
or validity of information. Using information from the Web 
requires a degree of care and caution over and above that 
used in the review of peer-reviewed journals. In reading 
about research from a website, one would ask many of the 
same questions about the research process that one would 
ask of a peer-reviewed journal article. In addition, the follow-
ing issues need to be considered when evaluating Web-based 
information: the authority and credibility of the authors of 
the Web-based information; the scope, relevance, and timeli-
ness of the information; and the potential bias of the author’s 
point of view.
Authority and Credibility:
 • Who publishes the website?
 • Who is the author(s) of the website?
 • What makes the author an authority on this subject?
 • Does the author cite his/her experience/credentials?
 • Does the website contain footnotes or references?

 • If so, does material taken from other sources appear to be 
fully credited?
Scope, Relevance, and Timeliness:
 • Who is the intended audience? (general, specialized, 
scholars)
 • What is the level of the material? (basic, advanced)
 • Is new research being reported or is the author reviewing/
summarizing previously conducted research?
 • What time period is covered?
 • How recently has the website been updated?
Bias and Accuracy:
 • How is the information presented? (fact, opinion, propa-
ganda, etc.)
 • If presented as fact, is it accurate?
 • Is there a bias? (cultural, political, religious, etc.)
 • If so, is the bias clearly stated or acknowledged by the 
authors?
One strategy in making use of Web-based information is to 
look for several sources on the same topic.
There are some wonderful resources of online informa-
tion. All branches of the federal government have websites 
with information about policies, programs, and research 
reports. The U.S. Census publishes the Statistical Abstracts 
online as well as frequent reports on specifi c topics. Medi-
cal information is available from the National Institutes of 
Health as well as from ongoing medical research projects that 
provide results of their research online. Advocacy groups, 
such as the National Center for Children in Poverty, pro-
vide up-to-date information about the impact of policies or 
programs. With all this information available, the research 
process is at once more open, more accessible, and more vul-
nerable to viral mischief.
Ethics
In conducting research with living beings, and especially 
with children, social scientists continually confront ethi-
cal questions. Ethics refers to principles of conduct that are 
founded on a society’s moral code. As part of their profes-
sional socialization, researchers are obligated to maintain 
humane, morally acceptable treatment of all living study par-
ticipants (Sales & Folkman, 2000).
The ethical guidelines for research with humans encom-
pass a variety of considerations. Because we are concerned 
about the right to privacy, the identities of individual par-
ticipants and their responses must be kept confidential. 
Individuals must not be coerced into participating in a 
research project, and their refusal to participate should have 
no negative consequences. If children in a classroom, for 
example, decide that they do not want to participate in a 
research project, or if their parents do not give permission 
for them to participate, they should not be shamed, given 
an undesirable alternate assignment, or given a lower grade.

 
Ethics | A-15
Researchers must protect participants from unneces-
sary painful physical and emotional experiences, includ-
ing shame, failure, and social rejection. Researchers must 
weigh the benefi ts of the new information they may discover 
in a particular study against the potential risks or harm to 
the participants. Two questions must guide the researcher’s 
decisions:
 1. How would you feel if you or one of your family mem-
bers were a participant in this study?
 2. Can the problem be studied in ways that do not involve 
pain, deception, or emotional or physical stress?
The American Psychological Association has published a 
guide for researchers titled Ethics in Research with Human Par-
ticipants (Sales & Folkman, 2000). This guide provides advice 
to researchers about how to manage all aspects of the research 
process in order to avoid any conflict of interests and to 
maintain the trust and safety of participants. Participants 
have a right to know how their privacy will be preserved and 
what steps will be taken to ensure that responses or behaviors 
observed in the research will remain confi dential. The guidelines 
require that participants be told about all aspects of the 
research that may infl uence their decision to participate. They 
must be free to withdraw from the study at any time. They 
are entitled to a full explanation of the study once it has been 
completed. When the participants are children, their parents 
must be given this information and must approve their chil-
dren’s participation.
Each university has an institutional review process that 
applies these or similar guidelines for the ethical conduct of 
research to proposals being prepared by faculty and students. 
Before a study can begin, the institutional review board con-
siders the design of the study and its potential impact on 
participants. The investigators have to commit to a proce-
dure of informed consent, so that participants are aware of 
the nature of the research, potential risks, conditions of con-
fi dentiality, and their freedom to withdraw from the study at 
any time if they choose. Approval for the research is typically 
given for 1 year. The institutional review process includes 
a mechanism for ongoing evaluation of research that takes 
place over longer periods of time. Most schools, day care 
centers, hospitals, nursing homes, and other treatment 
centers have their own review procedures for determining 
whether they will permit research to be carried out with the 
people in their programs. Ethical guidelines are important 
in order to prevent exploitation of participants and to pre-
vent unintended negative consequences of participation in 
research.

poverty Commonly understood as 
the condition of having little money and 
few material possessions. Since poverty 
is defi ned at the family level and not 
the household level, the poverty status 
of the household is determined by 
the poverty status of the householder. 
Households are classifi ed as poor when 
the total income of the householder’s 
family is below the appropriate 
poverty threshold. (For nonfamily 
householders, their own income 
is compared with the appropriate 
threshold.) The income of people living 
in the household who are unrelated

behavior are specifi ed by the gene se-
quence and by the number and identi-
ties of other proteins made in the same

secure attachment Infants actively 
explore their environment and interact 
with strangers while their mothers 
are present. After separation, the 
babies actively greet their mothers or 
seek interaction. If the babies were 
distressed during separation, the

and the babies return to exploration 
of the environment. In adulthood, this 
is an attachment outcome in which a

conditions when a task requires 
attention and concentration, heart rate 
increases, which allows for adaptive 
mobilization of resources. When the 
situation becomes more intense or 
threatening, heart rate slows, leading 
to conservation of resources and the 
ability to achieve a more calm state.
