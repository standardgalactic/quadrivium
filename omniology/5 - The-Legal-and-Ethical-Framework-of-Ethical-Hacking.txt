THE LEGAL AND ETHICAL
FRAMEWORK OF ETHICAL HACKING
Ethical hacking operates within legal frameworks
like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in
the United States. Complying with these laws is
essential to avoid legal repercussions.
When vulnerabilities are discovered, responsible
disclosure 
involves 
notifying 
the 
affected
organization without publicizing the flaw until it's
fixed to prevent malicious exploitation.
Obtaining 
explicit 
consent 
in 
writing 
is 
a
fundamental step before engaging in any ethical
hacking activity, ensuring a clear understanding
of the scope and purpose.
