About the Author
Mark Middlebrook used to be an engineer but gave it up when he discovered
that he couldn’t handle a real job. He is now principal of Daedalus Consulting,
an independent CAD and computer consulting company in Oakland, California.
(In case you wondered, Daedalus was the guy in ancient Greek legend who
built the labyrinth on Crete. Mark named his company after Daedalus before
he realized that few of his clients would be able to pronounce it and even
fewer spell it.) Mark is also a contributing editor for CADALYST magazine
and Webmaster of markcad.com. When he’s not busy being a cad, Mark sells
and writes about wine for Paul Marcus Wines in Oakland. He also teaches
literature and philosophy classes at St. Mary’s College of California — hence
“Daedalus.” AutoCAD 2005 For Dummies is his sixth book on AutoCAD.


Dedication
To Puck and Pretzel, two absolute AutoCAD dummies who never cease to
inspire and amuse. It was during walks in the woods with them that I origi-
nally worked out some of the details of these chapters. I’m pretty sure that
Puck could learn AutoCAD, if only he could figure out how to manipulate a
mouse. Pretzel, on the other hand, is too interested in squirrels to bother
with mice.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks first of all to Bud Smith, who initiated this book five editions ago,
brought me in on it along the way, and eventually handed it over to me in
toto. I hope that I prove as good a steward as he was a midwife (or is the
gender-neutral term “midspouse”?). Terri Varveris again shepherded the pro-
ject through the development process; her enthusiasm and infectious energy
have helped make each new edition more than just an obligatory update. It
was a genuine pleasure to work once again with Christine Berman, whose
combination of patience, persistence, and care make her a model project
editor. As always, Dave Byrnes carried out his duties as tech editor with skill
and verve; his diligence saved me from a few bloopers, and his thoughtful
suggestions helped make the book perceptibly better,

Introduction
I
t’s amazing to think that AutoCAD came into being over two decades ago,
at a time when most people thought that personal computers weren’t
capable of industrial-strength tasks like CAD. (The acronym stands for
Computer-Aided Drafting, Computer-Aided Design, or both, depending on
whom you talk to). It’s almost as amazing that, 20 years after its birth,
AutoCAD remains the king of the microcomputer CAD hill by a tall margin.
Many competing CAD programs have come to challenge AutoCAD, many have
fallen, and a few are still around. One hears rumblings that the long-term
future of CAD may belong to special-purpose, 3D-based software such as the
Autodesk Inventor and Revit programs. Whether or not those rumblings
amplify into a roar remains to be seen, but for the present and the near future
anyway, AutoCAD is where the CAD action is.
In its evolution, AutoCAD has grown more complex, in part to keep up with
the increasing complexity of the design and drafting processes that AutoCAD
is intended to serve. It’s not enough just to draw nice-looking lines anymore.
If you want to play CAD with the big boys and girls, you need to organize the
objects you draw, their properties, and the files in which they reside in
appropriate ways. You need to coordinate your CAD work with other people
in your office who will be working on or making use of the same drawings.
You need to be savvy about shipping drawings around via the Internet. 
AutoCAD 2005 provides the tools for doing all these things, but it’s not always
easy to figure out which hammer to pick up or which nail to bang on first.
With this book, you have an excellent chance of creating a presentable,
usable, printable, and sharable drawing on your first or second try without
putting a T square through your computer screen in frustration.
What’s Not in This Book
Unlike many other For Dummies books, this one does tell you to consult the
official software documentation sometimes. AutoCAD is just too big and com-
plicated for a single book to attempt to describe it completely. 
This book focuses on AutoCAD 2005, and also addresses its slightly less-
capable, much-lower-cost sibling, AutoCAD LT 2005. (AutoCAD LT 2005 For
Dummies, a version of this book especially for LT users, comes out several

2
AutoCAD 2005 For Dummies 
months later than the regular book.) I do occasionally mention differences
with previous versions, going back to the highly popular AutoCAD Release 14,
so that everyone has some context and upgraders can more readily under-
stand the differences. I also mention the important differences between full
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, so that you’ll know what you — or your LT-using
colleagues — are missing. This book does not cover the discipline-specific
features in AutoCAD-based products such as AutoCAD Architectural Desktop,
except for some general discussion in Chapter 1, but most of the information
in this book applies to the general-purpose AutoCAD features in the AutoCAD
2005-based versions of those programs as well.
Who Are — and Aren’t — You?
AutoCAD has a large, loyal, and dedicated group of long-time users. This
book is not for the sort of people who have been using AutoCAD for a decade,
who plan their vacation time around Autodesk University, or who consider
1,000-page-plus technical tomes about AutoCAD as pleasure reading. This
book is for people who want to get going quickly with AutoCAD, but who 
also know the importance of developing proper CAD techniques from the
beginning.
However, you do need to have some idea of how to use your computer
system before tackling AutoCAD — and this book. You need to have a com-
puter system with AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT (preferably the 2004 version). A
printer or plotter and a connection to the Internet will be big helps, too.
You also need to know how to use Windows to copy and delete files, create a
folder, and find a file. You need to know how to use a mouse to select (high-
light) or to choose (activate) commands, how to close a window, and how to
minimize and maximize windows. Make sure that you’re familiar with the
basics of your operating system before you start with AutoCAD.
How This Book Is Organized
If you saw the impressive and apparently random piles of stuff cluttering my
desk while I was writing this book, you’d wonder how I could organize a
chapter, never mind an entire book. Nevertheless, I hope you’ll find that the
book reflects some concerted thought about how to present AutoCAD in a
way that’s both easy-to-dip-into and smoothly-flowing-from-beginning-to-end.

The organization of this book into parts — collections of related chapters — is
one of the most important, uh, parts of this book. You really can get to know
AutoCAD one piece at a time, and each part represents a group of closely
related topics. The order of parts also says something about priority; yes,
you have my permission to ignore the stuff in later parts until you’ve mas-
tered most of the stuff in the early ones. This kind of building-block approach
can be especially valuable in a program as powerful as AutoCAD.
The following sections describe the parts that the book breaks down into.
Part I: AutoCAD 101
Need to know your way around the AutoCAD screen? Why does AutoCAD
even exist, anyway? What are all the different AutoCAD-based products that
Autodesk sells, and should you be using one of them — for example,
AutoCAD LT — instead of AutoCAD? Is everything so slooow because it’s sup-
posed to be slow, or do I have too wimpy a machine to use this wonder of
modern-day computing? And why am I doing this stuff in the first place?
Part I answers all these questions — and more. This part also includes what
may seem like a great deal of excruciating detail about setting up a new draw-
ing in AutoCAD. But what’s even more excruciating is to do your setup work
incorrectly and then feel as though AutoCAD is fighting you every step of the
way. With a little drawing setup work done in advance, it won’t.
Part II: Let There Be Lines
In this part, it’s time for some essential concepts, including object properties
and CAD precision techniques. I know that you’re raring to make some draw-
ings, but if you don’t get a handle on this stuff early on, you’ll be terminally
(or is that monitor-ally? ) confused when you try to draw and edit objects. If
you want to make drawings that look good, plot good, and are good, read this
stuff!
After the concepts preamble, the bulk of this part covers the trio of activities
that you’ll probably spend most of your time in AutoCAD doing: drawing
objects, editing them, and zooming and panning to see them better on the
screen. These are the things that you do in order to create the geometry —
that is, the CAD representations of the objects in the real world that you’re
designing. By the end of Part II, you should be pretty good at geometry, even
if your ninth-grade math teacher told you otherwise.

Introduction

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk
CAD drawings do not live on lines alone — most of them require quite a bit of
text, dimensioning, and hatching in order to make the design intent clear to
the poor chump who has to build your amazing creation. (Whoever said “a
picture is worth a thousand words” must not have counted up the number of
words on the average architectural drawing!) This part shows you how to
add these essential features to your drawings.
After you’ve gussied up your drawing with text, dimensions, and hatching,
you’ll probably want to create a snapshot of it to show off to your client, con-
tractor, or grandma. Normal people call this process “printing,” but CAD
people call it “plotting.” Whatever you decide to call it, I’ll show you how to
do it.
Part IV: Share and Share Alike
A good CAD user, like a good kindergartner, plays well with others. AutoCAD
encourages this behavior with a host of drawing- and data-sharing features.
Blocks, external reference files, and raster images encourage reuse of parts of
drawings, entire drawings, and bitmap image files. The new sheet sets feature
in AutoCAD 2005 opens up new possibilities for creating, organizing, and pub-
lishing the many drawings that compose a typical CAD project. CAD stan-
dards serve as the table manners of the CAD production process — they
define and regulate how people create drawings so that sharing can be more
productive and predictable. AutoCAD’s Internet features enable sharing of
drawings well beyond your hard disk and local network.
The drawing and data sharing features in AutoCAD takes you way beyond
old-style, pencil-and-paper design and drafting. After you’ve discovered how
to apply the techniques in this part, you’ll be well on your way to full CAD-
nerd-hood (you may want to warn your family beforehand). 
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part contains guidelines that minimize your chances of really messing
up drawings (your own or others’), and techniques for swapping drawings
with other people and accessing them from other computer programs.
There’s a lot of meat packed into these two chapters — juicy tidbits from
years of drafting, experimentation, and fist-shaking at things that don’t work
right — not to mention years of compulsive list-making. I hope that you find
these lists help you get on the right track quickly and stay there.

Icons Used in This Book
This icon tells you that herein lies a pointed insight that can save you time
and trouble as you use AutoCAD. In many cases, tip paragraphs act as a
funnel on AutoCAD’s impressive but sometimes overwhelming flexibility:
After telling you all the ways that you can do something, I tell you the way
that you should do it in most cases. 
The Technical Stuff icon points out places where delving a little more deeply
into AutoCAD’s inner workings or pointing out something that most people
don’t need to know about most of the time. These paragraphs definitely are
not required reading the first time through, so if you come to one of them at a
time when you’ve reached your techie detail threshold, feel free to skip over
them.
This icon tells you how to stay out of trouble when living a little close to the
edge. Failure to heed its message may have unpleasant consequences for you
and your drawing — or maybe for both of you.
There’s a lot to remember when you’re using AutoCAD, so I’ve remembered
to remind you about some those things that you should be remembering.
These paragraphs usually refer to a crucial point earlier in the chapter or in a
previous chapter. So if you’re reading sequentially, a remember paragraph
serves as a friendly reminder. If you’re not reading sequentially, this kind of
paragraph may help you realize that you need to review a central concept or
technique before proceeding.
This icon points to new stuff in AutoCAD 2005. It’s mostly designed for those
of you who are somewhat familiar with a previous version of AutoCAD and
want to be alerted to what’s new in this version. New AutoCAD users starting
out their CAD working lives with AutoCAD 2005 will find this stuff interesting,
too — especially when they can show off their new book-learnin’ to the griz-
zled AutoCAD veterans in the office who don’t yet know about all the cool,
new features.
This icon highlights differences between AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD. If you’re
using AutoCAD LT, you’ll find out what you’re missing compared to “full”
AutoCAD. If your friend is using LT, you’ll know where to look to find stuff in
AutoCAD to brag about.
A Few Conventions — Just in Case
You probably can figure out for yourself all the information in this section,
but here are the details just in case.

Introduction

Text you type into the program at the command line, in a dialog box, in a text
box, and so on appears in boldface type. Examples of AutoCAD prompts
appear in a special typeface, as does any other text in the book that
echoes a message, a word, or one or more lines of text that actually appear
on-screen. Sequences of prompts that appear in the AutoCAD command line
area have a shaded background, like so:
Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] <0.0000,0.0000>:
(Many of the figures — especially in Chapters 5 and 6 — also show AutoCAD
command line sequences that demonstrate AutoCAD’s prompts and example
responses.)
Often in this book you see phrases such as “choose File➪Save As from the
menu bar.” The funny little arrow (➪) separates the main menu name from
the specific command on that menu. In this example, you open the File menu
and choose the Save As command. If you know another way to start the same
command (for example, in this example, type SAVEAS and press Enter),
you’re welcome to do it that way instead. 
Many AutoCAD commands have shortcut (fewer letter) versions for the bene-
fit of those who like to type commands at the AutoCAD command prompt. In
this book, I format command names with the shortcut letters in uppercase
and the other letters in lowercase, so that you become familiar with the
shortcuts and can use them if you want to. So when you see an instruction
like “run the DimLInear command to draw a linear dimension,” it means “for
a linear dimension, type DIMLINEAR, or DLI for short, at the command line,
and then press the Enter key.”

utoCAD is more than just another application pro-
gram, it’s a complete environment for drafting and
design. So if you’re new to AutoCAD, you need to know
several things to get off to a good start — especially how
to use the command line area and set up your drawing
properly. These key techniques are described in this part
of the book.
If you’ve used earlier versions of AutoCAD, you’ll be most
interested in the high points of the new release, including
some newer interface components. The lowdown on
what’s new is here, too.

elcome to the fraternity whose members are the users of one of the
weirdest, wackiest, and most wonderful computer programs in the
world: AutoCAD. Maybe you’re one of the few remaining holdouts who con-
tinues to practice the ancient art of manual drafting with pencil and vellum.
Or maybe you’re completely new to drafting and yearn for the wealth and
fame of the drafter’s life. Maybe you’re an engineer or architect who needs to
catch up with the young CAD hotshots in your office. Or maybe you’re a full-
time drafter whose fingers haven’t yet been pried away from your beloved
drafting board. Maybe you tried to use AutoCAD a long time ago but gave up
in frustration or just got rusty. Or maybe you currently use an older version,
such as AutoCAD 2000 or even Release 14. 
Whatever your current situation and motivation, I hope that you enjoy the
process of becoming proficient with AutoCAD. Drawing with AutoCAD is chal-
lenging at first, but it’s a challenge worth meeting. CAD rewards those who
think creatively about their work and look for ways to do it better. You can
always find out more, discover a new trick, or improve the efficiency and
quality of your drawing production.
AutoCAD started as an MS-DOS-only program, when real men and women
typed commands and didn’t need toolbars or dialog boxes. Autodesk flirted
briefly with the Macintosh and UNIX operating systems while moving AutoCAD
into the GUI (graphical user interface) age, but the company eventually settled
on Microsoft Windows as the sole operating system for AutoCAD. (AutoCAD
2005 works with Windows XP — both the Professional and Home versions —

and Windows 2000.) Because of AutoCAD’s MS-DOS heritage and its emphasis
on efficiency for production drafters, it’s not the easiest program to master,
but it’s gotten easier and more consistent. AutoCAD is pretty well integrated
into the Windows environment now, but you still bump into some vestiges of
its MS-DOS legacy — especially the command line (that text area lurking at
the bottom of the AutoCAD screen — see Chapter 2 for details). This book
guides you around the bumps and minimizes the bruises.
Why AutoCAD?
AutoCAD has been around a long time — since 1982. AutoCAD ushered in the
transition from really expensive mainframe and minicomputer CAD systems
costing tens of thousands of dollars to merely expensive microcomputer CAD
programs costing a few thousand dollars.
AutoCAD is, first and foremost, a program to create technical drawings; draw-
ings in which measurements and precision are important, because these
kinds of drawings often get used to build something. The drawings you create
with AutoCAD must adhere to standards established long ago for hand-
drafted drawings. The up-front investment to use AutoCAD is certainly more
expensive than the investment needed to use pencil and paper, and the learn-
ing curve is much steeper, too. Why bother? The key reasons for using
AutoCAD rather than pencil and paper are
 Precision: Creating lines, circles, and other shapes of the exactly correct
dimensions is easier with AutoCAD than with pencils.
 Modifiability: Drawings are much easier to modify on the computer
screen than on paper. CAD modifications are a lot cleaner, too.
 Efficiency: Creating many kinds of drawings is faster with a CAD pro-
gram — especially drawings that involve repetition, such as floor plans
in a multistory building. But that efficiency takes skill and practice. If
you’re an accomplished pencil-and-paper drafter, don’t expect CAD to be
faster at first!
Figure 1-1 shows several kinds of drawings in AutoCAD 2005.
Why choose AutoCAD? AutoCAD is just the starting point of a whole industry
of software products designed to work with AutoCAD. Autodesk has helped
this process along immensely by designing a series of programming inter-
faces to AutoCAD that other companies — and Autodesk itself — have used
to extend the application. Some of the add-on products have become such
winners that Autodesk acquired them and incorporated them into its own
products. When you compare all the resources — including the add-ons,
extensions, training courses, books, and so on — AutoCAD doesn’t have
much PC CAD competition.

Part I: AutoCAD 101 

The Importance of Being DWG
To take full advantage of AutoCAD in your work environment, you need to be
aware of the DWG file format, the format in which AutoCAD saves drawings.
In some cases an older version of AutoCAD can’t open a DWG file that’s been
saved by a newer version of AutoCAD.
 A newer version of AutoCAD always can open files saved by an older
version.
 Some previous versions of AutoCAD can open files saved by the subse-
quent one or two versions. For example, AutoCAD 2004 can open DWG
files saved by AutoCAD 2005. That’s because Autodesk didn’t change the
DWG file format between AutoCAD 2004 and AutoCAD 2005.
 You can use the “save as” option in newer versions to save the file to
some older DWG formats.

Working with AutoCAD is easier when your co-workers and colleagues in
other companies all use the same version of AutoCAD and AutoCAD-related
tools. That way, your DWG files, add-on tools, and even the details of your
CAD knowledge can be mixed and matched among your workgroup and part-
ners. In the real world, you’ll probably work with people — at least in other
companies — who use AutoCAD versions as old as Release 14.
Many programs claim to be DWG-compatible — that is, capable of converting
data to and from AutoCAD’s DWG format. But achieving this compatibility is a
difficult thing to do well. Even a small error in file conversion can have
results ranging in severity from annoying to appalling. If you exchange DWG
files with people who use other CAD programs, be prepared to spend time
finding and fixing translation problems.
AutoCAD 2005 — like AutoCAD 2004 — does not include an option for saving
files to the R14 DWG file format. This omission creates problems if you want
to send DWG files to clients or consultants who are still using AutoCAD
Release 14. (And there are a surprising number of these folks — R14 was pop-
ular, and AutoCAD 2000 through 2004 didn’t tempt everyone to upgrade.) To
get around this limitation, you can save to the R12 DXF format, which AutoCAD
Release 14 will open — see Chapter 18 for instructions.

Seeing the LT
AutoCAD LT is one of the best deals around, a shining example of the old
80/20 rule: roughly 80 percent of the capabilities of AutoCAD for roughly 20
percent of the money. Like AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT runs on mainstream
Windows computers and doesn’t require any additional hardware devices.
With AutoCAD LT, you can be a player in the world of AutoCAD, the world’s
leading CAD program, for a comparatively low starting cost.
AutoCAD LT is a very close cousin to AutoCAD. Autodesk creates AutoCAD LT
by starting with the AutoCAD program, taking out a few features to justify
charging a lower price, adding a couple of features to enhance ease of use
versus full AutoCAD, and testing the result.
As a result, AutoCAD LT looks and works much like AutoCAD. The opening
screen and menus of the two programs are nearly identical. (LT is missing a
few commands from the AutoCAD menus.)
13
Chapter 1: Introducing AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT 2005
AutoCAD-based applications
Autodesk has expanded AutoCAD into a whole
product line of programs with AutoCAD as a
base and specialized, discipline-specific add-
ons built on top and included as one complete
product. As an AutoCAD 2005 user, you’ll be
looking for the 2005-compatible versions of
these tools, which should appear a few months
after AutoCAD 2005 ships. These discipline-
specific flavors of AutoCAD include Autodesk
Architectural Desktop and Autodesk Building
Systems (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing),
Autodesk Mechanical Desktop, Autodesk Map,
AutoCAD Land Desktop, Autodesk Survey, and
Autodesk Civil Design.
To make matters even more confusing, Autodesk
now offers Autodesk Revit and Autodesk
Inventor, software applications that compete
with Architectural Desktop and Mechanical
Desktop, respectively. Revit and Inventor are
not based on AutoCAD; they sacrifice AutoCAD
compatibility in favor of a more fundamentally
design- and 3D-oriented approach to CAD.
Whether they ultimately will replace the tradi-
tional AutoCAD-based applications remains to
be seen. Thus far, most companies seem to be
sticking with AutoCAD and the AutoCAD-based
Desktop applications.
In addition to the products from Autodesk, thou-
sands of AutoCAD add-on products — both 
discipline-specific and general-purpose — are
available from other software developers. These
companion products are sometimes called third-
party applications. Visit partnerproducts.
autodesk.com/ for more information about
what’s available.

In fact, the major difference between the programs has nothing to do with the
programs themselves. The major difference is that AutoCAD LT lacks support
for several customization and programming languages that are used to
develop AutoCAD add-ons. So almost none of the add-on programs or utilities
offered by Autodesk and others are available to LT users.
AutoCAD LT also has only limited 3D support. You can view and edit 3D
objects in AutoCAD LT, so you can work with drawings created in AutoCAD
that contain 3D objects. However, you cannot create true 3D objects.
The lack of 3D object creation in LT is not as big a negative for many users as
you may think. Despite a lot of hype from the computer press and CAD ven-
dors (including Autodesk), 3D CAD remains a relatively specialized activity.
The majority of people use CAD programs to create 2D drawings.
Although you may hear claims that AutoCAD LT is easier to master and use
than AutoCAD, the truth is that they’re about equally difficult (or easy,
depending on your nerd IQ). The LT learning curve doesn’t differ significantly
from that of AutoCAD. AutoCAD was originally designed for maximum power
and then modified somewhat to improve ease of use. AutoCAD LT shares this
same heritage.
Fortunately, the minimal differences between LT and AutoCAD mean that
after you have climbed that learning curve, you’ll have the same great view.
You’ll have almost the full range of AutoCAD’s 2D drafting tools, and you’ll be
able to exchange DWG files with AutoCAD users without data loss.
This book covers AutoCAD 2005, but almost all the information in it applies
to AutoCAD LT 2005 as well. The icon that you see at the left of this para-
graph highlights significant differences. If you’re an LT user, you may want to
look for AutoCAD LT 2005 For Dummies, which is aimed squarely at AutoCAD
LT and the types of people who use it instead of AutoCAD. 
Staying Alive with 2005
You should know this before you upgrade from a previous AutoCAD 
release:
 Wash those old Windows: AutoCAD 2005 does not support older ver-
sions of Windows, such as Windows NT, 98, and Me. You must use
Windows XP (Professional, Home, or Tablet PC) or Windows 2000.
 DWG file compatibility: AutoCAD 2005 uses the same DWG file format
as AutoCAD 2004, so you’ll be able to exchange files easily with users of
14
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

AutoCAD 2004. You can use File➪Save As to create DWG files for users
of AutoCAD 2000, 2000i, and 2002, but not for AutoCAD Release 14 and
earlier versions. (To get around this limitation, you can save to the
Release 12 DXF format — see Chapter 18 for instructions.)
 Application compatibility: If you use third-party applications with a pre-
vious version of AutoCAD, they may not work with AutoCAD 2005. Most
AutoCAD 2004 applications, including those developed with the ARX
(AutoCAD Runtime eXtension) and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)
programming interfaces will work with AutoCAD 2005, but older ARX
and VBA applications won’t work.
Many LSP (AutoLISP) programs written for the last several versions of
AutoCAD work with AutoCAD 2005.
 Increased computer system requirements: For AutoCAD 2005, Autodesk
recommends an 800 MHz Pentium III or better processor, at least 256MB
of RAM, 1024 x 768 or higher display resolution, 300MB of available hard
disk space, an Internet connection, and Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0
with Service Pack 1 or later.
AutoCAD 2005 comes out a mere year after AutoCAD 2004 and thus doesn’t
sport quite as many new features as did some earlier upgrades, many of
which came out at two-year intervals. The new features and feature improve-
ments in AutoCAD 2005, however, are well conceived and worthwhile. My
three favorites are:
 Sheet sets — a radically new and much more sophisticated way of orga-
nizing sets of drawings. (See Chapter 14.)
 Text tables, an enormously improved way to place tabular data on draw-
ings quickly and uniformly — including the ability to import the data
from Excel spreadsheets. (See Chapter 9.)
 An improved plotting interface, including background plotting. (See
Chapter 12.)

Chapter 1: Introducing AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT 2005
No Express service?
The AutoCAD 2005 CD-browser screen includes
separate links for installing the main AutoCAD
2005 software and the Express Tools — a set of
handy utilities for AutoCAD (but not available for
AutoCAD LT). If your menu bar doesn’t include
the Express menu shown in Figure 1-1, you
should consider installing the Express Tools
from your AutoCAD 2005 CD. Just pop in the CD
and, when the CD-browser page appears, click
the AutoCAD Express Tools link and follow the
installation instructions.

AutoCAD 2005 includes other goodies — look for the icon that you see at the
left of this paragraph.
If you’re using any version prior to AutoCAD 2004, the new version definitely
is worth upgrading to. You’ll enjoy a slew of improvements, including a
cleaner, more functional interface (Chapter 2), numbered and bulleted text
lists (Chapter 9), and many xref enhancements (Chapters 13 and 16).
AutoCAD 2005 is a worthy new version. If you’ve been putting off upgrading,
and especially if you’ve been hanging out with an old version such as
AutoCAD 2000 or Release 14, this probably is a good time to take the plunge.

utoCAD 2005 is a full-fledged citizen of the Windows world, with tool-
bars, dialog boxes, right-click menus, a multiple-document interface,
and all the other trappings of a real Windows program. But lurking beneath
that pretty face — and literally beneath the drawing area, right at the bottom
of the AutoCAD program window — is a weird but essential holdover from
the DOS days: the AutoCAD command line area. The command line is one of
the few un-Windows-like things in AutoCAD that you’ll have to come to terms
with, and this chapter shows you how.
Like the rest of the book, this chapter is written for someone who has used
other Windows programs but has little or no experience with AutoCAD. If
you’re experienced with Windows versions of AutoCAD, much of this chapter
is old hat for you. Do make sure, though, that you’re familiar with the inter-
face features that were added to AutoCAD 2004: palettes and the additional
buttons on the right end of the status bar.

AutoCAD Does Windows
Finding your way around AutoCAD 2005 can be an odd experience. You recog-
nize from other Windows applications much of the appearance and workings
of the program, such as its toolbars and pull-down menus, which you use for
entering commands or changing system settings. But other aspects of the
program’s appearance — and some of the ways in which you work with it —
are quite different from other Windows programs. You can, in many cases, tell
the program what to do in at least four ways — pick a toolbar icon, pick from
the pull-down menus, type at the command line, or pick from the right-click
menus — none of which is necessarily the best method to use for every task.
The experience is much like that of having to act as several different charac-
ters in a play; you’re likely to forget your lines (whichever “you” you are at
the time!) every now and then.
As with other Windows programs, the menus at the top of the AutoCAD screen
enable you to access most of the program’s functions and are the easiest-to-
remember method of issuing commands. When you want to get real work done,
you’ll need to combine the pull-down menus with other methods — especially
typing options at the command line or choosing them from the right-click
menu. I show you how throughout this book.
18
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Screen test yields high profile
The screen shots and descriptions in this chapter
reflect the default configuration of AutoCAD —
that is, the way the screen looks if you use the
standard version of AutoCAD (not a flavored ver-
sion such as Architectural Desktop) and haven’t
messed with the display settings. You can change
the appearance of the screen with settings on the
Display tab of the Options dialog box (choose
Tools➪Options➪Display) and by dragging tool-
bars and other screen components.
The change I’ve made is to configure the draw-
ing area background to be white instead of
black, because the figures in the book show up
better that way. On your system, you’ll probably
want to leave your drawing area background
black, because the normal range of colors that
appears in most drawings is easier to see
against a black background.
If you’re using a flavored version of AutoCAD, or if
someone has already changed your configuration
or added a third-party program to your setup, your
screen may look different than the figures in this
book. You can restore the default configuration —
including display settings — with the Reset button
on the Options dialog box’s Profiles tab. (AutoCAD
LT doesn’t include the Profiles feature, so LT users
are out of luck here.) But before you click the
Reset button, consider whether the modified 
configuration may be useful to someone in the
future — like you! If so, first click the Add to List
button to create a new profile. Enter a pithy name
for the new profile, such as AutoCAD default.
Then select the new profile that you created, click
the Set Current button to make it the current pro-
file, and finally click the Reset button. In the future,
you can switch between your modified and
default configurations with the Set Current button.

AutoCAD’s Opening Screen Cuisine
When you launch AutoCAD after first installing it, the opening screen, shown 
in Figure 2-1, displays an arrangement of menus, toolbars, palettes, and a new,
blank drawing. You can close the Sheet Set Manager and Tool Palettes for 
now — I describe how to turn them back on and how to use them later in this
chapter. (If you installed the Express Tools, as I describe at the end of Chap-
ter 1, you’ll also see a flock of small toolbars labeled ET. You can safely close
all these and use the Express pull-down menu to access all the Express Tools.) 
Standard Windows fare
As you see in Figure 2-1, much of the AutoCAD screen is standard Windows
fare — title bars, a menu bar, toolbars, and a status bar.

A hierarchy of title bars
Like most Windows programs, AutoCAD has a title bar at the top of its pro-
gram window that reminds you which program you’re in (not that you’d ever
mistake the AutoCAD window for, say, Microsoft Word!).
 At the right side of the title bar is the standard set of three Windows
control buttons: Minimize, Maximize/Restore, and Close.
 Each drawing window within the AutoCAD program window has its own
title bar. You use the control buttons on a drawing window’s title bar to
minimize, maximize/un-maximize, or close that drawing, not the entire
AutoCAD program.
As in other Windows programs, if you maximize a drawing’s window, it expands
to fill the entire drawing area. (AutoCAD 2005 starts with the drawing maxi-
mized in this way.) As shown in Figure 2-1, the drawing’s control buttons move
onto the menu bar, below the control buttons for the AutoCAD program win-
dow; the drawing’s name appears in the AutoCAD title bar. To un-maximize
the drawing so you can see any other drawings that you have open, click the
lower un-maximize button. The result is as shown in Figure 2-2: a separate
title bar for each drawing with the name and controls for that drawing.

Making choices from the menu bar
The menu bar contains the names of all the primary menus in your version of
AutoCAD. As with any program that’s new to you, it’s worth spending a few
minutes perusing the menus in order to familiarize yourself with the com-
mands and their arrangement. (If your menu bar doesn’t include the Express
menu, see the end of Chapter 1 for installation instructions.)
Cruising the toolbars
As in other Windows programs, the toolbars in AutoCAD 2005 provide rapid
access to the most commonly used AutoCAD commands. AutoCAD ships with
toolbars in this default arrangement (as shown in Figure 2-3):
 Standard toolbar: Located on top, just below the menu bar; file manage-
ment and other common Windows functions, plus some specialized
AutoCAD stuff such as zooming and panning.
 Styles toolbar: To the right of the Standard toolbar; analogous to the 
left part of the Formatting toolbar in Microsoft programs, but formatting
of AutoCAD’s text, dimension, and table styles. (Table styles are new in
AutoCAD 2005.) Chapters 9 and 10 cover these features.
 Layers toolbar: Beneath the Standard toolbar; commands and a drop-
down list for manipulating layers, which are AutoCAD’s fundamental
tools for organizing and formatting objects. Chapter 4 contains the layer
lowdown.
 Properties toolbar: To the right of the Layers toolbar; analogous to the
right part of the Formatting toolbar in Microsoft programs, but formatting
of AutoCAD’s properties, such as colors, linetypes, and lineweights. See
Chapter 4 when you’re ready to play with AutoCAD’s object properties.
 Draw toolbar: Vertically down the far-left edge of the screen; the most
commonly used commands from the Draw menu. Chapter 5 covers most
of the items on this toolbar.
21
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2005
Hot-wiring the menu bar
Some standard tips and tricks for Windows are
especially useful in AutoCAD. Control-key short-
cuts for the most popular functions — Ctrl+S to
save, Ctrl+O to open a file, and Ctrl+P to print —
work the same way in AutoCAD as in most other
Windows programs. Use them!
Also worth exploring are the Alt-key shortcuts,
which are available for all menu choices, not just
the most popular ones. To fly around the menus,
just press and hold the Alt key and then press
the letters on your keyboard that correspond to
the underlined letters on the menu bar and in the
menu choices. To bring up the SAVEAS com-
mand, for example, just press and hold the Alt key,
press F for File, and then press A for Save As.

 Modify toolbar: Vertically down the far-right edge of the screen; the
most commonly used commands from the Modify menu. Chapter 8
shows you how to use almost everything on this toolbar.
 Draw Order toolbar: Beneath the Modify toolbar; commands for con-
trolling which objects appear on top of which other objects. Chapter 13
mentions these features.
You can rearrange, open, and close toolbars as in other Windows programs:
 To move a toolbar, point to its border (the double-line control handle at
the leading edge of the toolbar is the easiest part to grab), click, and drag.
 To open or close toolbars, right-click on any toolbar button and choose
from the list of available toolbars, as shown in Figure 2-3.
The AutoCAD screen in Figure 2-3 shows the default toolbar arrangement,
which works fine for most people. Feel free to close the Draw Order toolbar;
you aren’t likely to use its features frequently. You may want to turn on a
couple of additional toolbars, such as Object Snap and Dimension, as you dis-
cover and make use of additional features. Throughout this book, I point out
when a particular toolbar may be useful.

If you’re not satisfied with just rearranging the stock AutoCAD toolbars, you
can customize their contents or even create new ones. The procedures are
beyond the scope of this book; they involve bouncing among the Commands,
Toolbars, and Properties tabs on the Customize dialog box in not entirely
intuitive ways. Resist slicing and dicing the stock AutoCAD toolbars until
you’re at least somewhat familiar with them. If you want to get creative there-
after, go to the Contents tab of the AutoCAD 2005 online help and choose
Customization Guide➪Basic Customization➪Create Custom Toolbars.
AutoCAD toolbar buttons provide ToolTips, those short text descriptions that
appear in little yellow boxes when you pause the cursor over a toolbar button.
A longer description of the icon’s function appears in the status bar at the
bottom of the screen.
Looking for Mr. Status Bar
The status bar appears at the bottom of the AutoCAD screen, as shown in
Figure 2-4. The status bar displays and allows you to change several impor-
tant settings that affect how you draw and edit in the current drawing. Some
of these settings won’t make complete sense until you’ve used the AutoCAD
commands that they influence, but here’s a brief description, with pointers to
detailed descriptions of how to use each setting elsewhere in this book:
 Coordinates of the cursor: The cursor coordinates readout displays the
current X,Y,Z location of the cursor in the drawing area, with respect to
the origin point (whose coordinates are 0,0,0). It’s a bit like having a GPS
(Global Positioning System) device in your drawing. Chapter 4 describes
AutoCAD’s coordinate conventions and how to use this area of the
status bar.
23
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2005
The toolbars that ET AutoCAD
If you’ve installed the Express Tools, you’ll also
see a flock of Express Tools toolbars, whose
labels begin with “ET:”, floating over the draw-
ing area. These four small toolbars collect some
of the most popular Express Tools. You’ll proba-
bly want to close most of these or at least dock
any favorites along the margin of the AutoCAD
window.
The toolbars are extensions to AutoCAD, not
part of the core program, so turning them on is
a little more complicated than just using the
right-click toolbars menu. Right-click on any
toolbar, choose Customize, click the Toolbars
tab on the Customize dialog box, and choose the
EXPRESS Menu Group. Now the Toolbars list
displays the names of the four Express Tools
toolbars; click the check boxes next to the
names in order to toggle each toolbar on or off.

If the coordinates in the lower-left corner of the screen are grayed out,
then coordinate tracking is turned off. Click the coordinates so that they
appear in dark lettering that changes when you move the cursor in the
drawing area.
 SNAP, GRID, and ORTHO mode buttons: These three buttons control
three of AutoCAD’s tools for ensuring precision drawing and editing:
• Snap constrains the cursor to regularly spaced hot spots, enabling
you to draw objects a fixed distance apart more easily.
• Grid displays a series of regularly spaced dots, which serve as a
distance reference.
• Ortho constrains the cursor to horizontal and vertical relative
movement, which makes drawing orthogonal (straight horizontal
and vertical) lines easy.
See Chapter 3 for instructions on how to configure these modes and
Chapter 4 for information about why, when, and how to use them in
actual drawing operations.
 POLAR tracking mode button: Polar tracking causes the cursor to
prefer certain angles when you draw and edit objects. By default, the
preferred angles are multiples of 90 degrees, but you can specify other
angle increments, such as 45 or 30 degrees. See Chapter 4 for instruc-
tions to specify the polar tracking angles that you prefer. Clicking the
POLAR button toggles polar tracking on or off. Ortho and polar tracking
are mutually exclusive — turning on one mode disables the other.
 Running Object Snap (OSNAP) and Object Snap Tracking (OTRACK)
buttons: Object snap is another AutoCAD tool for ensuring precision
drawing and editing. You use object snaps to grab points on existing
objects — for example, the endpoint of a line or the center of a circle.
• When you turn on running object snap, AutoCAD continues to hunt
for object snap points. Chapter 4 contains detailed instructions on
how to use this feature.
• When you turn on object snap tracking, AutoCAD hunts in a more
sophisticated way for points that are derived from object snap
points. Chapter 4 briefly describes this advanced feature.

Part I: AutoCAD 101 

AutoCAD LT doesn’t include the object snap tracking feature, so you
won’t see an OTRACK button on its status bar.
 Lineweight (LWT) display mode button: One of the properties that you
can assign to objects in AutoCAD is lineweight — the thickness that lines
appear when you plot the drawing. This button controls whether you
see the lineweights on the screen. (This button doesn’t control whether
lineweights appear on plots; that’s a separate setting in the Plot dialog
box.) Chapter 4 gives you the skinny (and the wide) on lineweights.
 MODEL/PAPER space button: As I describe in the section “Main course:
The drawing area” later in this chapter, the drawing area is composed of
overlapping tabbed areas labeled Model, Layout1, and Layout2 by default.
The Model tab displays a part of the drawing called model space, where
you create most of your drawing. Each of the remaining tabs displays a
paper space layout, where you can compose a plotable view with a title
block. A completed layout will include one or more viewports, which
reveal some or all the objects in model space at a particular scale.
The MODEL/PAPER status bar button (not to be confused with the Model
tab) comes into play after you click one of the paper space layout tabs.
The MODEL/PAPER button provides a means for moving the cursor
between model and paper space while remaining in the particular layout.
• When the MODEL/PAPER button says MODEL, drawing and editing
operations take place in model space, inside a viewport.
• When the button says PAPER, drawing and editing operations take
place in paper space on the current layout.
Don’t worry if you find model space and paper space a little disorienting
at first. The paper space layout setup information in Chapter 3 and plot-
ting instructions in Chapter 12 will help you get your bearings and navi-
gate with confidence.
 Maximize/Minimize Viewport button (paper space layouts only): When
you’re looking at one of the Layout tabs instead of the Model tab, the
status bar displays an additional Maximize Viewport button. Click this
button to expand the current paper space viewport so that it fills the
entire drawing area. Click the button — now called Minimize Viewport —
again to restore the viewport to its normal size. (Chapter 3 describes
viewports.)
 Communication Center: This button opens a dialog box containing
recent AutoCAD-related headlines that Autodesk thinks you may find
useful. The headlines are grouped into categories called channels: Live
Update Maintenance Patches, Articles and Tips, Product Support
Information, and so on. Each headline is a link to a Web page with more
information, such as how to download a software update or fix a prob-
lem. Click the Settings button to select channels you see in the
Communication Center window.
 Manage Xrefs: You won’t see this combination button and notification
symbol until you open a drawing that contains xrefs (external DWG files
25
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2005

that are incorporated into the current drawing). Chapter 13 tells you
how to use xrefs and what the Manage Xrefs button does.
 Status Bar Menu: When you click the easy-to-miss downward-pointing
arrow near the right edge of the status bar, you open a menu with
options for toggling off or on each status bar button. Now you can deco-
rate your status bar to your taste.
You can open dialog boxes for configuring many of the status bar button
functions by right-clicking the status bar button and choosing Settings.
Chapters 3 and 4 give you specific guidance about when and how to change
these settings.
A button’s appearance shows whether the setting is turned on or off.
Depressed, or down, means on; raised, or up, means off. If you’re unclear
whether a setting is on or off, click its button; its mode will change and the
new setting will be reflected on the command line — <Osnap off>, for exam-
ple. Click again to restore the previous setting.
Take an order: The command line area
If the title bars, menu bar, and status bar are the Windows equivalent of com-
fort food — familiar, nourishing, and unthreatening — then the command 
line area, shown in Figure 2-5, must be the steak tartare or blood sausage of
the AutoCAD screen feast. It looks weird, turns the stomachs of newcomers,
and delights AutoCAD aficionados. The hard truth is that you have to come
to like — or at least tolerate — the command line if you want to become at 
all comfortable using AutoCAD.
You need to get up close and personal with the command line for four reasons:
 The command line area is AutoCAD’s primary communications con-
duit with you. This is the most important reason to pay attention to the
command line. AutoCAD frequently displays prompts, warnings, and
error messages in the command line area. If you don’t keep an eye on
this area, you’ll miss a lot of vital information. You’ll continually be frus-
trated, because you won’t “hear” what AutoCAD is trying to tell you.
 The command line is an efficient way to run some commands and the
only way to run a few others. Instead of clicking a toolbar button or a
Figure 2-5:
Obey the
command
line.
26
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

menu choice, you can start a command by typing its command name and
then pressing the Enter key. Even better, you can type the keyboard short-
cut for a command name and press Enter. Most of the keyboard shortcuts
for command names are just one or two letters — for example, L for the
LINE command and CP for the COPY command. Most people who dis-
cover how to use the shortcuts for the commands that they run most fre-
quently find that their AutoCAD productivity improves noticeably. Even if
you’re not worried about increasing your productivity with this technique,
there are some commands that aren’t on the toolbars or pull-down menus.
If you want to run those commands, you have to type them!
 After you’ve started a command — whether from a toolbar, from a
menu, or by typing — the command line is where AutoCAD prompts
you with options for that command.
You activate one of these options by typing the uppercase letter(s) in
the option and pressing Enter.
In many cases, you can activate a command’s options by right-clicking in
the drawing area and choosing the desired option from the right-click
menu, instead of by typing the letter(s) for the option and pressing
Enter. But if you don’t watch the command line, you probably won’t real-
ize that there are any options!
 You sometimes need to type coordinates at the command line to specify
precise points or distances. Chapter 4 describes this technique in detail.
You don’t have to click in the command line area to type command names,
keyboard shortcuts, or command options there. AutoCAD knows that your
typing is supposed to go to the command line. The only exception is when
you’re within a text command (you’re adding a text note to the drawing itself);
in that case, the text appears in the drawing, not in the command line area.
The following sequence demonstrates how you use the command line area to
run commands, view and select options, and pay attention to messages from
AutoCAD:
1. Type L and press Enter.
AutoCAD starts the LINE command and displays the following prompt in
the command line area:
LINE Specify first point:
2. Click a point anywhere in the drawing area.
The command line prompt changes to:
Specify next point or [Undo]:
AutoCAD always displays command options in brackets. In this case, the
Undo option appears in brackets. To activate the option, type the letter(s)
shown in uppercase and press Enter. (You can type the option letter(s) in
lowercase or uppercase.)
27
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2005

3. Click another point anywhere in the drawing area.
AutoCAD draws the first line segment.
4. Click a third point anywhere in the drawing area.
AutoCAD draws the second line segment. The command line prompt
changes to:
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]:
AutoCAD now displays two options, Close and Undo, separated by a
slash.
5. Type U and press Enter.
AutoCAD undoes the second line segment.
6. Type 3,2 (without any spaces) and press Enter.
AutoCAD draws a new line segment to the point whose the X coordinate
is 3 and the Y coordinate is 2.
7. Click several more points anywhere in the drawing area.
AutoCAD draws additional line segments.
8. Type X and press Enter.
AutoCAD displays an error message (because X isn’t a valid option of
the LINE command) and reprompts for another point:
Point or option keyword required.
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]:
Option keyword is programmer jargon for the letter(s) shown in upper-
case that you type to activate a command option. This error message is
AutoCAD’s way of saying “I don’t understand what you mean by typing
‘X.’ Either specify a point or type a letter that I do understand.”
9. Type C and press Enter.
AutoCAD draws a final line segment, which creates a closed figure, and
ends the LINE command. The naked command prompt returns, indicat-
ing that AutoCAD is ready for the next command:
Command:
10. Press the F2 key.
AutoCAD displays the AutoCAD Text Window, which is simply an
enlarged, scrollable version of the command line area, as shown in
Figure 2-6.
The normal three-line command line area usually shows you what you
need to see, but occasionally you’ll want to review a larger chunk of com-
mand line history (“what was AutoCAD trying to tell me a minute ago?!”).
11. Press the F2 key again.
AutoCAD closes the AutoCAD Text Window.

Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Here are a few other tips and tricks for using the command line effectively:
 Use the Esc key to bail out of the current operation. There will be
times when you get confused about what you’re doing in AutoCAD
and/or what you’re seeing in the command line area. If you need to bail
out of the current operation, just press the Esc key one or more times
until you see the naked command prompt — Command: at the bottom of
the command line area, with nothing after it. As in most other Windows
programs, Esc is the cancel key. Unlike many other Windows programs,
AutoCAD keeps you well informed of whether an operation is in
progress. The naked command prompt indicates that AutoCAD is in a
quiescent state, waiting for your next command.
 Press Enter to accept the default action. Some command prompts
include a default action in angled brackets. For example, the first prompt
of the POLygon command is
Enter number of sides <4>:
The default here is four sides, and you can accept it simply by pressing
the Enter key. (That is, you don’t have to type 4 first.)
AutoCAD uses two kinds of brackets in command line prompts.
• Command options appear in regular brackets: [Close/Undo].
To activate a command option, type the letter(s) that appear in
uppercase and then press Enter.

line area to

29
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2005

• A Default value or option appears in angled brackets: <>.
To choose the default value or option, simply press Enter.
 Observe the command line. You’ll discover a lot about how to use the
command line simply by watching it after each action that you take.
When you click a toolbar button or menu choice, AutoCAD types the
name of the command automatically, so if you’re watching the command
line, you’ll absorb the command names more-or-less naturally.
When AutoCAD types commands automatically in response to your tool-
bar and menu clicks, it usually adds one or two extra characters to the
front of the command name.
• AutoCAD usually puts an underscore in front of the command
name (for example, _LINE instead of LINE). The underscore is an
Autodesk programmers’ trick that enables non-English versions of
AutoCAD to understand the English command names that are
embedded in the menus.
• AutoCAD sometimes puts an apostrophe in front of the command
name and any underscore (for example, ‘_ZOOM instead of ZOOM).
The apostrophe indicates a transparent command; you can run the
command in the middle of another command without canceling the
first command. For example, you can start the LINE command, run
the ZOOM command transparently, and then pick up where you
left off with the LINE command.
 Leave the command line in the default configuration initially. The com-
mand line area, like most other parts of the AutoCAD screen, is resizable
and relocateable. The default location (docked at the bottom of the
AutoCAD screen) and size (three lines deep) work well for most people.
Resist the temptation to mess with the command line area’s appearance —
at least until you’re comfortable with how to use the command line.
 Right-click in the command line area for options. If you right-click in
the command line area, you’ll see a menu with some useful choices,
including Recent Commands — the last six commands that you ran.
 Press the up- and down-arrow keys to cycle through the stack of com-
mands that you’ve typed recently. This is another handy way to recall
and rerun a command. Press the left- and right-arrow keys to edit the
command line text that you’ve typed or recalled.
Main course: The drawing area
After all these screen hors d’oeuvres, you’re probably getting hungry for the
main course — the AutoCAD drawing area. This is where you do your draw-
ing, of course. In the course of creating drawings, you click points to specify
locations and distances, click objects to select them for editing, and zoom
and pan to get a better view of what you’re working on.
30
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Most of this book shows you how to interact with the drawing area, but you
should know a few things up front.
The Model and Layout tabs (Model and Paper Space)
One of the initially disorienting things about AutoCAD is that finished draw-
ings can be composed of objects drawn in different spaces, which AutoCAD
indicates with the tabs along the bottom of the drawing area (Model,
Layout1, and Layout2 by default).
 Model space is where you create and modify the objects that represent
things in the real world — walls, widgets, waterways, or whatever.
 Paper space is where you create particular views of these objects for
plotting, usually with a title block around them. Paper space comprises
one or more layouts, each of which can contain a different arrangement
of model space views and different title block information.
When you click the Model tab in the drawing area, you see pure, unadulterated
model space, as shown in Figure 2-7. When you click one of the paper space
layout tabs (Layout1 or Layout2, unless someone has renamed or added to
them), you see a paper space layout, as shown in Figure 2-8. A completed
layout usually includes one or more viewports, which are windows that display
all or part of model space at a particular scale. A layout also usually includes a
title block or other objects that exist only in the layout and don’t appear when
you click the Model tab. (Think of the viewport as a window looking into model
space and the title block as a frame around the window.) Thus, a layout dis-
plays model space and paper space objects together, and AutoCAD lets you
draw and edit objects in either space. See Chapter 3 for information about cre-
ating paper space layouts and Chapter 12 for the lowdown on plotting them.
As I describe in the “Looking for Mr. Status Bar” section in this chapter, after
you’ve clicked one of the layout tabs, the status bar’s MODEL/PAPER button
31
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2005
AutoCAD is no vin ordinaire
The back and forth needed to get AutoCAD to
draw and complete a line is a great example of
AutoCAD’s power — and its power to confuse
new users. It’s kind of like a wine that tastes a
bit harsh initially, but that ages better than
something more immediately drinkable.
In other programs, if you want to draw a line,
you just draw it. In AutoCAD, you have to press
Enter one extra time when you’re done just to
tell AutoCAD you really are finished drawing.
But the fact that the Line command remains
active after you draw the first line segment
makes it much faster to draw complicated,
multisegment lines, which is a common activity
in a complex drawing.
This is just one example of how AutoCAD favors
ease of use for power users doing complex
drawings over ease of mastery for beginners,
who frequently forget to hit Enter that extra time
to close out a command.

moves the cursor between model and paper space while remaining in the
particular layout. (As shown in Figures 2-7 and 2-8, the orientation icon at the
lower-left corner of the AutoCAD drawing area changes between an X-Y axis
for model space and a drafting triangle for paper space as an additional
reminder of which space the cursor currently resides in.) Chapter 3 describes
the consequences of changing the MODEL/PAPER setting and advises you on
how to use it.
This back-and-forth with the MODEL/PAPER button or double-clicking is nec-
essary only when you’re drawing things while viewing one of the paper space
layouts. In practice, you probably won’t encounter that situation very often.
Instead, you’ll do most of your drawing on the Model tab and, after you’ve set
up a paper space layout, click its layout tab only when you want to plot.
Drawing on the drawing area
Here a few other things to know about the AutoCAD drawing area:
 Efficient, confident use of AutoCAD requires that you continually
glance from the drawing area to the command line area (to see those 
all-important prompts!) and then back up to the drawing area. This
sequence is not a natural reflex for most people. Get in the habit of
looking at the command line after each action that you take, whether
picking something on a toolbar, on a menu, or in the drawing area.
Figure 2-7:
Our model

32
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

 Clicking at random in the drawing area is not quite as harmless in
AutoCAD as it is in many other Windows programs. When you click in
the AutoCAD drawing area, you’re almost always performing some
action — usually specifying a point or selecting objects for editing. Feel
free to experiment, but look at the command line after each click. If you
get confused, press the Esc key a couple of times to clear the current
operation and return to the naked command prompt.
 In most cases, you can right-click in the drawing area to display a menu
with some options for the current situation.
A Palette-Cleanser
In AutoCAD 2005, two features called Properties and DesignCenter, a toolbar-
like interface called Tool Palettes, and the new Sheet Set Manager appear in
spiffy modeless dialog boxes, or palettes.
 Properties and DesignCenter: Used to control object properties and
named objects (layers, blocks, and so on), respectively. Chapter 4 shows
you how.
Figure 2-8:
Freshly laid
out in paper
space.
33
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2005

 Tool Palettes: Resembles a stack of painter’s palettes, except that each
palette holds content (drawing symbols and hatch patterns) and/or com-
mands (toolbar-like macros — a new feature in AutoCAD 2005) instead of
paints. Chapters 11, 13, and 15 help you unlock your inner Tool Palette
artistry.
 Sheet Set Manager: Provides tools for managing all of a project’s draw-
ings as a sheet set. Chapter 14 gives you the lowdown on why you might
want to and how to do so.
You toggle these palettes on and off by clicking three buttons near the end of
the Standard toolbar or by pressing Ctrl+1 (Properties), Ctrl+2 DesignCenter),
Ctrl+3 (Tool Palettes), or Ctrl+4 (Sheet Set Manager). Figure 2-9 shows all four
toggled on.
Modeless is just a fancy way of saying that these dialog boxes don’t take over
AutoCAD in the way that modal dialog boxes do. Modal dialog boxes demand
your undivided attention. You enter values, click buttons, or whatever, and
then click the OK or Cancel button to close the dialog box. While the modal
dialog box is open, you can’t do anything else in AutoCAD. A modeless dialog
box, on the other hand, can remain open while you execute other commands
that have nothing to do with the dialog box. You return to the modeless
dialog box when or if you need its features.
Manipulating AutoCAD modeless dialog boxes — or palettes — is similar to
manipulating a regular Windows dialog box, except that the title bar is along
the side instead of at the top. In other words, you click and drag the title strip
along the side to move the palette. If you experiment with the control buttons
at the bottom of this strip (or right-click anywhere on the strip), you’ll quickly
get the hang of what you can do with these palettes. In particular, turning on
the auto-hide feature causes the dialog box to “roll up” into the strip so that
it’s not taking up much screen space. When you point the cursor at the strip,
the palette unfurls again.
Another cool feature — for the Tool Palettes but not the Properties and
DesignCenter palettes — is transparency. Right-click the Tool Palettes’ title strip
and choose Transparency to control this feature. With transparency turned on,
you can see your drawing objects behind a faded version of the Tool Palettes.
(According to my dictionary, that would make the palettes translucent, not
transparent, but whatever.) If you combine transparency with auto-hide, you
end up with Tool Palettes that have a low impact on your drawing area. And if
you’re bothered by the amount of screen space taken by the command line
area, you can make it transparent, too: Undock it, right-click the title bar and
turn off Allow Docking, and then right-click again and choose Transparency.
After you’ve set the transparency to your taste, click and drag the command
line area to where you want it.

What Really Makes AutoCAD Cook?
Knowing how to use the command line, as described in the section, “Take an
order: The command line area,” is one of the secrets of becoming a compe-
tent AutoCAD user. In reading about and using AutoCAD, you encounter two
additional topics frequently: system variables, which are AutoCAD’s basic
control levers, and dialog boxes, many of which put a friendlier face on the
system variables.
Sizzling system variables
System variables are settings that AutoCAD checks before it decides how to
do something. If you set the system variable SAVETIME to 10, AutoCAD auto-
matically saves your drawing file every ten minutes; if you set SAVETIME to
60, the time between saves is one hour. Hundreds of system variables control
AutoCAD’s operations.
Properties palette
DesignCenter palette
Tool palettes
Figure 2-9:
A modeless

35
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2005

Of these hundreds of system variables in AutoCAD, 70 system variables con-
trol dimensioning alone. (Dimensioning is the process of labeling objects with
their lengths, angles, or special notes. Different professions have different
standards for presenting dimensions on their drawings. Using dimensions is
described in detail in Chapter 10.)
To change the value of a system variable, just type its name at the AutoCAD
command prompt and press Enter. AutoCAD will display the current value of
the system variable setting and prompt you for a new value. Press Enter
alone to keep the existing setting, or type a value and press Enter to change
the setting.
The procedure for entering a system variable is exactly the same as for enter-
ing a command name — type the name and press Enter. The only difference is
what happens afterward:
 A system variable changes a setting.
 A command usually adds objects to the drawing, modifies objects, or
changes your view of the drawing.
Being able to change system variables by typing their names at the command
line is a boon to power users and occasionally a necessity for everybody else.
The only problem is finding or remembering what the names are. In most
cases, you’ll be told what system variable name you need to type — by me 
in this book or by the local AutoCAD guru in your office.
To see a listing of all the system variables in AutoCAD and their current set-
tings, use the following steps:
1. Type SETvar at the AutoCAD command prompt and press Enter.
AutoCAD prompts you to type the name of a system variable (if you
want to view or change just one) or question mark (if you want to see
the names and current settings of more than one):
Enter variable name or [?]
2. Type ? (question mark) and press Enter.
AutoCAD asks which system variables to list:
Enter variable(s) to list <*>:
3. Press Enter to accept the default asterisk (which means “list all system
variables”).
AutoCAD displays the first 16 system variables and their settings:

If you want to find out more about what a particular system variable controls,
see the System Variables chapter in the Command Reference in the AutoCAD
online help.
Three kinds of system variables exist:
 Those saved in the Windows Registry. If you change this kind of system
variable, it affects all drawings when you open them with AutoCAD on
your system.
 Those saved in the drawing. If you change this kind, the change affects
only the current drawing.
 Those that aren’t saved anywhere. If you change this kind, the change
lasts only for the current drawing session.
The System Variables chapter in the online Command Reference tells you
which kind of system variable each one is.
Delicious dialog boxes
Fortunately, you don’t usually have to remember the system variable names.
AutoCAD exposes most of the system variable settings in dialog boxes so that
37

you can change their values simply by clicking check boxes or typing values
in edit boxes. This approach is a lot more user-friendly than remembering an
obscure name like “ACADLSPASDOC.”
For example, many of the settings on the tabs in the Options dialog box, shown
in Figure 2-10, are in fact system variables. If you use the dialog box quick help
(click the question mark in the Options dialog box’s title bar, and then click an
option in the dialog box), the pop-up description not only describes the set-
ting, but also tells which system variable it corresponds to.

Setup for Success
In This Chapter
 Developing a setup strategy
 Starting a new drawing
 Setting up model space
 Setting up paper space layouts
 Creating and using drawing templates
S
urprisingly, drawing setup is one of the trickier aspects of using AutoCAD.
It’s an easy thing to do incompletely or wrong, and AutoCAD 2004 doesn’t
provide a dialog box or other simple, all-in-one-fell-swoop tool to help you do
all of it right. And yet, drawing setup is a crucial thing to get right. Setup steps
that you omit or don’t do right will come back to bite you — or at least gnaw
on your leg — later.
Sloppy setup really becomes apparent when you try to plot your drawing.
Things that seemed more or less okay as you zoomed around on the screen
suddenly are completely the wrong size or scale on paper. And nothing
brands someone as a naive AutoCAD wannabe as quickly as the inability to
plot a drawing at the right size and scale. Chapter 12 covers plotting proce-
dures, but the information in this chapter is a necessary prerequisite to suc-
cessful plotting. If you don’t get this stuff right, there’s a good chance you’ll
find that . . . the plot sickens.
This chapter describes the decisions you need to make before you set up a
new drawing, shows the steps for doing a complete and correct setup, and
demonstrates how to save setup settings for reuse.
Don’t assume that you can just create a new blank DWG file and start drawing
things. In other words, do read this chapter before you get too deep into the
later chapters in this book. Many AutoCAD drawing commands and concepts
depend on proper drawing setup, so you’ll have a much easier time of drawing
and editing things if you’ve done your setup homework. A few minutes invested
in setting up a drawing well can save hours of thrashing around later on. 

After you’ve digested the detailed drawing setup procedures described in
this chapter, use the Drawing Setup Roadmap on the Cheat Sheet at the front
of this book to guide you through the process.
An Appetizing Setup Strategy
You need to set up AutoCAD correctly, partly because AutoCAD is so flexible
and partly because, well, you’re doing CAD — computer-aided drafting (or
design). The computer can’t aid your drafting (or design) if you don’t clue it
in on things like drawing scale, paper size, and units. In this context, the fol-
lowing reasons help explain why AutoCAD drawing setup is important:
 Electronic paper: The most important thing you can do to make using
AutoCAD fun is to work on a correctly set up drawing so that your screen
acts like paper, only smarter. When drawing on real paper, you constantly
have to translate between units on the paper and the real-life units of 
the object you’re drawing. But when drawing in AutoCAD, you can draw
directly in real-life units — feet and inches, millimeters, or whatever you
typically use on your projects. AutoCAD can then calculate distances 
and dimensions for you and add them to the drawing. You can make the
mouse pointer jump directly to hot spots on-screen, and a visible, resiz-
able grid gives you a better sense of the scale of your drawing. However,
this smart paper function works well only if you tell AutoCAD some cru-
cial parameters for your specific drawing. AutoCAD can’t really do its job
until you tell it how to work.
 Dead-trees paper: Creating a great drawing on-screen that doesn’t fit
well on paper is all too easy. After you finish creating your drawing on
the smart paper AutoCAD provides on-screen, you usually must then
plot it on the good, old-fashioned paper that people have used for thou-
sands of years. At that point, you must deal with the fact that people like
to use certain standard paper sizes and drawing scales. (Most people
also like everything to fit neatly on one sheet of paper.) If you set up
AutoCAD correctly, good plotting results automatically; if not, plotting
time can become one colossal hassle.
 It ain’t easy: AutoCAD provides templates and Setup Wizards for you,
but the templates don’t work well unless you understand them, and
some of the wizards don’t work well even if you do understand them.
This deficiency is one of the major weaknesses in AutoCAD. You must
figure out on your own how to make the program work right. If you just
plunge in without carefully setting it up, your drawing and printing
efforts are likely to wind up a real mess.
Fortunately, setting up AutoCAD correctly is a bit like cooking a soufflé:
Although the steps for performing your setup are complex, you can master
them with attention and practice. Even more fortunately, this chapter pro-
vides a detailed and field-tested recipe. 
42
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

While you’re working in AutoCAD, always keep in mind what your final output
should look like on real paper. Even your first printed drawings should look
just like hand-drawn ones — only without all those eraser smudges.
Before you start the drawing setup process, you need to make decisions
about your new drawing. These three questions are absolutely critical. If you
don’t answer them, or you answer them wrong, you’ll probably need to do
lots of reworking of the drawing later:
 What drawing units will you use?
 At what scale — or scales — will you plot it?
 On what size paper does it need to fit?
In some cases, you can defer answering one additional question, but it’s usu-
ally better to deal with it up front: What kind of border or title block does
your drawing require?
If you’re in a hurry, it’s tempting to find an existing drawing that was set up
for the drawing scale and paper size that you want to use, make a copy of
that DWG file, erase the objects, and start drawing. Use this approach with
care, though. When you start from another drawing, you inherit any setup
mistakes in that drawing. Also, drawings that were created in much older ver-
sions of AutoCAD may not take advantage of current program features and
CAD practices. If you can find a suitable drawing that was set up in a recent
version of AutoCAD by an experienced person who is conscientious about
doing setup right, consider using it. Otherwise, you’re better off setting up a
new drawing from scratch.
43
Chapter 3: Setup for Success
AutoCAD and paper
In other Windows programs, you can use any
scaling factor you want to squeeze content onto
paper. You’ve probably printed an Excel spread-
sheet or Web page at some odd scaling factor,
such as 82.5 percent of full size, because that’s
what it took to squeeze the content onto a single
sheet of paper while keeping the text as large
as possible.
In drafting, your printout needs to use a specific,
widely accepted scaling factor, such as 1⁄4” =
1’–0”, to be useful and understandable to
others. But the AutoCAD screen does not auto-
matically enforce any one scaling factor or
paper size. If you just start drawing stuff on the
AutoCAD screen to fit your immediate needs, it’s
unlikely that the final result will fit neatly on a
piece of paper at a desirable scale.
This chapter tells you how to start your drawing
in such a way that you’ll like how it ends up.
With practice, this kind of approach will
become second nature.

Choosing your units
AutoCAD is extremely flexible about drawing units; it lets you have them your
way. Usually, you choose the type of units that you normally use to talk about
whatever you’re drawing: feet and inches for a building in the United States,
millimeters for a metric screw, and so on.
During drawing setup, you choose two units characteristics: a type of unit —
Scientific, Decimal, Engineering, Architectural, and Fractional — and a 
precision of measurement in the Drawing Units dialog box, shown in Figure 3-1.
(I show you how later in this chapter.) Engineering and Architectural units are
in feet and inches; Engineering units use decimals to represent partial inches,
and Architectural units use fractions to represent them. AutoCAD’s other unit
types — Decimal, Fractional, and Scientific — are unitless because AutoCAD
doesn’t know or care what the base unit is. If you configure a drawing to use
Decimal units, for example, each drawing unit could represent a micron, mil-
limeter, inch, foot, meter, kilometer, mile, parsec, the length of the king’s fore-
arm, or any other unit of measurement that you deem convenient. It’s up to
you to decide.
After you specify a type of unit, you draw things on-screen full size in those
units just as though you were laying them out on the construction site or in
the machine shop. You draw an 8-foot-high line, for example, to indicate the
height of a wall and an 8-inch-high line to indicate the cutout for a doggie
door (for a Dachshund, naturally). The on-screen line may actually be only 2
inches long at a particular zoom resolution, but AutoCAD stores the length as
8 feet. This way of working is easy and natural for most people for whom CAD
is their first drafting experience, but it seems weird to people who’ve done a
lot of manual drafting. If you’re in the latter category, don’t worry; you’ll soon
get the hang of it.

Units dialog

Part I: AutoCAD 101 

When you use dash-dot linetypes (Chapter 4) and hatching (Chapter 11) in a
drawing, AutoCAD imposes one additional units consideration — whether the
drawing uses an imperial (inches, feet, miles, and so on) or metric (millimeters,
meters, kilometers, and so on) system of units. The MEASUREMENT system
variable controls whether the linetype and hatch patterns that AutoCAD lists
for you to choose from are scaled with inches or millimeters in mind as the
plotting units. MEASUREMENT=0 means inches (that is, an imperial units draw-
ing), whereas MEASUREMENT=1 means millimeters (that is, a metric units
drawing). If you start from an appropriate template drawing, as described later
in this chapter, the MEASUREMENT system variable will be set correctly and
you won’t ever have to think about it. 
Weighing your scales
The next decision you should make before setting up a new drawing is choos-
ing the scale at which you’ll eventually plot the drawing. This decision gives
you the drawing scale and drawing scale factor — two ways of expressing the
same relationship between the objects in the real world and the objects plot-
ted on paper. 
45
Chapter 3: Setup for Success
Drawing scale versus the drawing scale factor
CAD users employ two different ways of talking
about a drawing’s intended plot scale: drawing
scale and drawing scale factor.
Drawing scale is the traditional way of describ-
ing a scale — traditional in that it existed long
before CAD came to be. Drawing scales are
expressed with an equal sign or colon; for exam-
ple 1⁄8” = 1’–0”, 1 = 20, or 2:1. Translate the equal
sign or colon as “corresponds to.” In all cases,
the measurement to the left of the equal sign or
colon indicates a paper measurement, and the
number to the right indicates a CAD drawing and
real-world measurement. In other words, the
architectural scale 1⁄8” = 1’–0” means “1⁄8” on the
plotted drawing corresponds to 1’–0” in the CAD
drawing and in the real world,” assuming that the
plot was made at the proper scale.
Drawing scale factor is a single number that
represents a multiplier, such as 96, 20, or 0.5.
The drawing scale factor for a drawing is the
conversion factor between a measurement on
the plot and a measurement in a CAD drawing
and the real world.
Those of you who did your math homework in
junior high will realize that drawing scale and
drawing scale factor are two interchangeable
ways of describing the same relationship. The
drawing scale factor is the multiplier that con-
verts the first number in the drawing scale into
the second number.

You shouldn’t just invent some arbitrary scale based on your CD-ROM speed
or camera’s zoom lens resolution. Most industries work with a fairly small set
of approved drawing scales that are related to one another by factors of 2 or
10. If you use other scales, you’ll at best be branded a clueless newbie — and
at worst have to redo all your drawings at an approved scale.
Table 3-1 lists some common architectural drawing scales, using both English
and metric units. (Ratios such as 1:200 are unitless. Building plan and detail
measurements often are expressed in millimeters, so you can think of 1:200
as meaning “1 millimeter on the plotted drawing equals 200 millimeters in
actual building.”) The table also lists the drawing scale factor corresponding
to each drawing scale and the common uses for each scale. If you work in
other industries than those listed here, ask drafters or coworkers what the
common drawing scales are and for what kinds of drawings they’re used.

After you choose a drawing scale, engrave the corresponding drawing scale
factor on your desk, write it on your hand, and put it on a sticky note on your
monitor. You need to know the drawing scale factor for many drawing tasks, as
well as for some plotting. You should be able to recite the drawing scale factor
of any drawing you’re working on in AutoCAD without even thinking about it.
Even if you will use the Plot dialog box’s Fit to Paper option, rather than a
specific scale factor, to plot the drawing, you need to choose an artificial
scale to make text, dimensions, and other annotations appear at a useful size.
Choose a scale that’s in the neighborhood of the Fit to Paper plotting factor,
which AutoCAD displays in the Plot Scale area of the Plot dialog box. For
example, if you determine that you need to squeeze your drawing down
46
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

about 90 times to fit on the desired sheet size, choose a drawing scale of 1⁄8
inch = 1 foot – 0 inches (drawing scale factor = 96) if you’re using architec-
tural units or 1 = 100 (drawing scale factor = 100) for other kinds of units.
Thinking about paper
With knowledge of your industry’s common drawing scales, you can choose a
provisional scale based on what you’re depicting. But you won’t know for
sure whether that scale works until you compare it with the size of the paper
that you want to use for plotting your drawing. Here again, most industries
use a small range of standard sheet sizes. Three common sets of sizes exist,
as shown in Figure 3-2 and Table 3-2:
 ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
 Architectural
 ISO (International Standard Organization)

You select a particular set of sheet sizes based on the common practices in
your industry. You then narrow down your choice based on the area required
by what you’re going to draw. For example, most architectural plans are plot-
ted on Architectural D or E size sheets.
If you know the desired sheet size and drawing scale factor, you can calculate
the available drawing area easily. Simply multiply each of the sheet’s dimen-
sions (X and Y) by the drawing scale factor. For example, if you choose an 
11-x-17-inch sheet and a drawing scale factor of 96 (corresponding to a plot
scale of 1⁄8” = 1’–0”), you multiply 17 times 96 and 11 times 96 to get an avail-
able drawing area of 1,632 inches x 1,056 inches (or 136 feet x 88 feet). If your
sheet size is in inches but your drawing scale is in millimeters, you need to
multiply by an additional 25.4 to convert from inches to millimeters. For
example, with an 11-x-17-inch sheet and a scale of 1:200 (drawing scale factor
= 200), you multiply 17 times 200 times 25.4 and 11 times 200 times 25.4 to get
86,360 x 55,880 mm or 86.36 x 55.88 m — not quite big enough for a football
field (United States or European football).
Conversely, if you know the sheet size that you’re going to use and the real-
world size of what you’re going to draw, and you want to find out the largest
plot scale you can use, you have to divide, not multiply. Divide the needed
real-world drawing area dimensions (X and Y) by the sheet’s dimensions (X
and Y). Take the larger number — either X or Y — and round up to the near-
est real drawing scale factor (that is, one that’s commonly used in your indus-
try). For example, suppose you want to draw a 60-x-40-foot or, 720-x-480-inch,
floor plan and print it on 11-x-17-inch paper. You divide 720 by 17 and 480 by
11 to get 42.35 and 43.64, respectively. The larger number, 43.64, corresponds
in this example to the short dimension of the house and the paper. The near-
est larger common architectural drawing scale factor is 48 (corresponding to
1⁄4” = 1’–0”), which leaves a little room for the plotting margin and title block.
48
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

The Cheat Sheet at the front of this book includes two tables that list the
available drawing areas for a range of sheet sizes and drawing scales. Use
those tables to help you decide on an appropriate paper size and drawing
scale, and revert to the calculation method for situations that the tables
don’t cover. (If you don’t keep a favorite old calculator on your physical desk-
top, this may be a good time to put a shortcut to the Windows Calculator on
your virtual one.)
When you select a sheet size and drawing scale, always leave some extra
room for the following two reasons:
 Most plotters and printers can’t print all the way to the edge of the 
sheet — they require a small margin. For example, my trusty old Hewlett-
Packard LaserJet III has a printable area of about 7.9 x 10.5 inches on an
8.5-x-11-inch ANSI A size (letter size) sheet. (You’ll find this information 
in the Plot dialog box, as described in Chapter 12.) If you’re a stickler for
precision, you can use the printable area instead of the physical sheet
area in the calculations described earlier in this section.
 Most drawings require some annotations — text, grid bubbles, and so 
on — outside the objects you’re drawing, plus a title block surrounding
the objects and annotations. If you don’t leave some room for the annota-
tions and title block, you’ll end up having to cram things together too
much or to change to a different sheet size. Either way, you’ll be slowed
down later in the project when you can least afford it. Figure 3-3 shows an
extreme example of selecting a sheet size that’s too small or, conversely, a
drawing scale that’s too large. In this example, the building is too long for
the sheet, and it overlaps the title block on both the right and left sides. 
Some industries deal with the “sheet-is-too-small/drawing-scale-is-too-large”
problem by breaking drawings up onto multiple plotted sheets.
Don’t be afraid to start with paper. Experienced drafters often make a quick,
throwaway pencil and paper sketch called a cartoon. A drawing cartoon usu-
ally includes a rectangle indicating the sheet of paper you intend to plot on, a
sketch of the title block, and a very rough, schematic sketch of the thing
you’re going to draw. It helps to scribble down the dimensions of the sheet,
the main title block areas, and the major objects to be drawn. By sketching
out a cartoon, you’ll often catch scale or paper size problems before you set
up a drawing, when repairs only take a few minutes, not after you’ve created
the drawing, when fixing the problem can take hours.
49
Chapter 3: Setup for Success

Defending your border
The next decision to make is what kind of border your drawing deserves. The
options include a full-blown title block, a simple rectangle, or nothing at all
around your drawing. If you need a title block, do you have one, can you
borrow an existing one, or will you need to draw one from scratch? Although
you can draw title block geometry in an individual drawing, you’ll save time
by reusing the same title block for multiple drawings. Your company may
already have a standard title block drawing ready to use, or someone else
who’s working on your project may have created one for the project.
The right way to draw a title block is in a separate DWG file at its normal plot-
ted size (for example, 36 inches long by 24 inches high for an architectural D
size title block). You then insert or xref the title block drawing into each sheet
drawing. Chapter 13 describes how to insert and xref separate DWG files.
All system variables go
As Chapter 2 describes, AutoCAD includes a slew of system variables that con-
trol the way your drawing and the AutoCAD program work. Much of the draw-
ing setup process involves setting system variables based on the drawing
Figure 3-3:
“This sheet
size is too
small,” said
Goldilocks.
50
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

scale, sheet size, and other desired properties of the drawing. You can set
some system variables in AutoCAD dialog boxes, but a few require that you
type at the command line. Table 3-3 shows the settings that you most com-
monly need to change — or at least check — during drawing setup, along
with the names of the corresponding system variables. Later in the chapter,
in the section “The Main Course: Model Space,” I show you the procedure for
changing these settings.

Getting Creative with Templates
When you start AutoCAD 2004 with its desktop shortcut or from the Windows
Start menu, AutoCAD creates a new, blank drawing based on the default tem-
plate drawing (Acad.dwt). When you explicitly create a new drawing from
within AutoCAD, the Select Template dialog box, shown in Figure 3-4, appears
by default so that you can choose a template on which to base your new
drawing.
A template is simply a drawing whose name ends in the letters DWT, which
you use as the starting point for another drawing. When you create a new
drawing from a template, AutoCAD makes a copy of the template file and
opens the copy in a new drawing editor window. The first time you save the
file, you’re prompted for a new filename to save to; the original template file
stays unchanged.
You may be familiar with the Microsoft Word or Excel template documents,
and AutoCAD template drawings work pretty much the same way — because
Autodesk stole the idea from them! (Encouraged, of course, by Microsoft.)

Chapter 3: Setup for Success

Using a suitable template can save you time and worry because many of the
setup options are already set correctly for you. You know the drawing will
print correctly; you just have to worry about getting the geometry and text
right. Of course, all this optimism assumes that the person who set up the
template knew what he or she was doing. 
The stock templates that come with AutoCAD are okay as a starting point,
but you’ll need to modify them to suit your purposes, or create your own
from scratch. In particular, the stock AutoCAD templates aren’t set up for the
scales that you’ll want to use. The instructions in the rest of this chapter tell
you how to specify scale-dependent setup information.
So the only problems with templates are creating good ones and then later
finding the right one to use when you need it. Later in this chapter, in the sec-
tion “Cooking Up Terrific Templates,” I show you how to create templates from
your own setup drawings. Here I show you how to use an already created tem-
plate, such as one of the templates that comes with AutoCAD 2004 or from one
of your CAD-savvy colleagues. If you’re lucky, someone in your office will have
created suitable templates that you can use to get going quickly.
Follow these steps to create a new drawing from a template drawing:
1. Run the NEW command by pressing Ctrl+N or choosing File➪New.
The Select Template dialog box appears.
The first button on the Standard toolbar runs the QNEW (“Quick NEW”)
command instead of the ordinary NEW command. Unless you or some-
one else has changed the Drawing Template Settings in the Options
dialog box, QNEW does the same thing as NEW. See “Cooking Up Terrific
Templates,” later in this chapter, for information about how to take
advantage of QNEW.

2. Click the name of the template that you want to use as the starting
point for your new drawing.
3. Click the Open button.
A new drawing window with a temporary name, such as Drawing2.dwg,
appears. (The template you opened remains unchanged on your hard
disk.)
Depending on which template you choose, your new drawing may open
with a paper space layout tab, not the Model tab, selected. If that’s the
case, click the Model tab before changing the settings described in “The
Main Course: Model Space.” The section “Plot Layouts for Any Palate,”
later in this chapter, describes how to set up and take advantage of
paper space layouts.
4. Press Ctrl+S and save the file under a new name.
Take the time to save the drawing to the appropriate name and 
location now.
5. Make needed changes.
For most of the templates that come with AutoCAD, you need to con-
sider changing the units, limits, grid and snap settings, linetype scale,
and dimension scale. See the section, “The Main Course: Model Space,”
for instructions.
6. Consider saving the file as a template.
If you’ll need other drawings in the future similar to the current one,
consider saving your modified template as a template in its own right.
See the section “Cooking Up Terrific Templates” later in this chapter.
The simplest, no-frills templates are Acad.dwt (for people who customar-
ily work with sheet sizes expressed in inches) and Acadiso.dwt (for
people who customarily work with sheet sizes expressed in millimeters).
Most of the remaining templates that come with AutoCAD include title
blocks for various sizes of sheets. In addition, most templates come in
two versions — one for people who use color-dependent plot styles and
one for people who use named plot styles. You probably want the color-
dependent versions. (Chapter 12 describes the two kinds of plot styles
and why you probably want the color-dependent variety.) I warned you
that this drawing setup stuff would be complicated!
If you dig around in the Options dialog box, you may discover a setting that
turns on the old Startup dialog box, which offers several options other than
starting with a template. Among these options are the enticingly named Setup
Wizards. These so-called wizards were lame when they first appeared; they’re
no better now. Autodesk acknowledges as much by making them almost
impossible to find in AutoCAD 2005.
53
Chapter 3: Setup for Success

The Main Course: Model Space
Most drawings require a two-part setup:
1. First, set up the model space tab, where you’ll create most of your 
drawing.
2. Next, create one or more paper space layout tabs for plotting.
After you’ve decided on drawing scale and sheet size, you can perform model
space setup as described in this section.
Setting your units
First, you should set the linear and angular units that you want to use in your
new drawing. The following procedure describes how:
1. Choose Format➪Units from the menu bar.
The Drawing Units dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-5.
2. Choose a linear unit type from the Length Type drop-down list.
Choose the type of unit representation that’s appropriate for your work.
Engineering and Architectural units are displayed in feet and inches; the
other types of units aren’t tied to any particular unit of measurement.
You decide whether each unit represents a millimeter, centimeter, meter,
inch, foot, or something else. Decimal units usually are a good choice for
metric drawings.
Figure 3-5:
The default
unit-less
units.
54
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

AutoCAD can think in inches! If you’re using Engineering or Architectural
units (feet and inches), AutoCAD understands any coordinate you enter
as a number of inches. You use the ’ (apostrophe) character on your key-
board to indicate a number in feet instead of inches.
3. From the Length Precision drop-down list, choose the degree of 
precision you want when AutoCAD displays coordinates and linear
measurements.
The precision setting controls how precisely AutoCAD displays coordi-
nates, distances, and prompts in some dialog boxes. In particular, the
Coordinates box on the status bar displays the current cursor coordi-
nates using the current precision. A grosser — that is, less precise — 
precision setting makes the numbers displayed in the status bar more
readable and less jumpy. So be gross for now; you can always act a little
less gross later.
The linear and angular precision settings only affect AutoCAD’s display of
coordinates, distances, and angles on the status bar, in dialog boxes, and
in the command line area. For drawings stored as DWG files, AutoCAD
always uses maximum precision to store the locations and sizes of all
objects that you draw. In addition, AutoCAD provides separate settings for
controlling the precision of dimension text — see Chapter 10 for details.
4. Choose an angular unit type from the Angle Type drop-down list.
Decimal Degrees and Deg/Min/Sec are the most common choices.
The Clockwise check box and the Direction button provide additional
angle measurement options, but you’ll rarely need to change the default
settings: Measure angles counterclockwise and use east as the 0 degree
direction.
5. From the Angle Precision drop-down list, choose the degree of preci-
sion you want when AutoCAD displays angular measurements.
6. In the Drag-and-Drop Scale area, choose the units of measurement for
this drawing.
Choose your base unit for this drawing — that is, the real-world distance
represented by one AutoCAD unit.
7. Click OK to exit the dialog box and save your settings.
Telling your drawing its limits
The next model space setup task is to set your drawing’s limits. You wouldn’t
want it staying out all night and hanging out with just anybody, would you?
The limits represent the rectangular working area that you’ll draw on, which
usually corresponds to the paper size. Setting limits correctly gives you the
following advantages:
55
Chapter 3: Setup for Success

 When you turn on the grid (described in the section, “Making the draw-
ing snap-py (and grid-dy),” later in this chapter), the grid displays in the
rectangular limits area. With the grid on and the limits set correctly, you
always see the working area that corresponds to what you’ll eventually
be plotting, so you won’t accidentally color outside the lines.
 The ZOOM command’s All option zooms to the greater of the limits or
the drawing extents. (The extents of a drawing consist of a rectangular
area just large enough to include all the objects in the drawing.) When
you set limits properly and color within the lines, ZOOM All gives you a
quick way to zoom to your working area.
 If you plot from model space, you can choose to plot the limits area.
This option gives you a quick, reliable way to plot your drawing, but
only if you’ve set limits correctly!
Many CAD drafters don’t set limits properly in their drawings. After you read
this section, you can smugly tell them why they should and how.
You can start the LIMITS command from a menu choice, but all subsequent
action takes place on the command line; despite the importance of the topic,
AutoCAD has no dialog box for setting limits. 
The following procedure shows you how to set your drawing limits:
1. Choose Format➪Drawing Limits from the menu bar to start the LIMITS
command; or type LIMITS on the command line and press Enter.
The LIMITS command appears on the command line, and the command
line displays the following prompt at the bottom of the screen:
Command: limits
Reset Model space limits:
Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] <0.000,0.0000>:
The value at the end of the last line of the prompt is the default value for
the lower-left corner of the drawing limits. It appears according to the
units and precision that you selected in the Drawing Units dialog box —
for example, 0’–0” if you selected Architectural units with precision to
the nearest inch.
2. Type the lower-left corner of the limits you want to use and press
Enter.
The usual value to enter at this point is 0,0. (Type a zero, a comma, and
then another zero, with no spaces.) You can just press Enter to accept
the default value.
AutoCAD now prompts you for the upper-right corner of the limits:
Specify upper right corner <12.0000,9.0000>:
56
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

The initial units offered by AutoCAD correspond to an architectural A size
sheet of paper in landscape orientation. (Almost no one uses Architectural
A size paper; here’s a classic example of a programmer choosing a silly
default that no one has bothered to change in 22 years!)
3. Type the upper-right corner of the limits you want to use and press
Enter.
You calculate the usual setting for the limits upper-right corner by multi-
plying the paper dimensions by the drawing scale factor. For example, if
you’re setting up a 1⁄8” = 1’–0” drawing (drawing scale factor = 96) to be
plotted on a 24-x-36-inch sheet in landscape orientation, the upper-right
corner of the limits should be 36 inches times 96, 24 inches times 96.
Okay, pencils down. The correct answer is 3456,2304 (or 288 feet,192 feet).
Alternatively, you can cheat when specifying limits and read the limits
from the tables on the Cheat Sheet.
If you have the grid turned on, AutoCAD redisplays it in the new limits
area after you press Enter.
If you’re using Architectural or Engineering units and you want to enter
measurements in feet and not inches, you must add the foot designator
after the number, such as 6’; otherwise, AutoCAD assumes that you
mean inches.
4. Choose View➪Zoom➪All.
AutoCAD zooms to the new limits.
Making the drawing area 
snap-py (and grid-dy)
AutoCAD’s grid is a set of evenly spaced, visible dots that serve as a visual
distance reference. (As I describe in “Telling your drawing its limits,” earlier
in this section, the grid also indicates how far the drawing limits extend.)
AutoCAD’s snap feature creates a set of evenly spaced, invisible hot spots,
which makes the cursor move in nice, even increments. Both grid and snap
are like the intersection points of the lines on a piece of grid paper, but grid is
simply a visual reference, whereas snap constrains the points that you can
pick with the mouse. You can — and usually will — set the grid and snap
spacing to different distances.
Set the grid and the snap intervals in the Drafting Settings dialog box with
these steps:
1. Right-click the Snap or Grid button in the status bar and choose Settings.
The Drafting Settings dialog box appears with the Snap and Grid tab
selected, as shown in Figure 3-6.
57
Chapter 3: Setup for Success

The Snap and Grid tab has four parts, but the Snap and Grid sections are
all you need to worry about for most drafting work. 
2. Select the Snap On check box to turn on snap.
This action creates default snaps half a unit apart.
3. Enter the Snap X Spacing for the snap interval in the accompanying
text box.
Use the information in the sections preceding this procedure to decide
on a reasonable snap spacing.
The Y spacing automatically changes to equal the X spacing, which is
almost always what you want.
4. Select the Grid On check box to turn on the grid.
5. Enter the Grid X Spacing for the grid in the accompanying text box.
Use the information in the sections preceding this procedure to decide
on a reasonable grid spacing.
The Y spacing automatically changes to equal the X spacing. As with the
snap spacing, you usually want to leave it that way.
X measures horizontal distance; Y measures vertical distance. The
AutoCAD drawing area normally shows an X and Y icon in case you
forget.
6. Click OK to close the Drafting Settings dialog box.
You can also click the SNAP button on the status bar to toggle snap on and
off; the same goes for the GRID button and the grid setting.

Setting linetype and dimension scales
Even though you’ve engraved the drawing scale factor on your desk and writ-
ten it on your hand — not vice versa — AutoCAD doesn’t know the drawing
scale until you enter it. Keeping AutoCAD in the dark is fine as long as you’re
just drawing continuous lines and curves representing real-world geometry,
because you draw these objects at their real-world size, without worrying
about plot scale.
59
Chapter 3: Setup for Success
Making snap (and grid) decisions
You can set your grid spacing to work in one of
two ways: to help with your drawing or to help
you remain aware of how objects will relate to
your plot. For a grid that helps with your draw-
ing, set the grid points a logical number of mea-
surement units apart. For example, you might
set the grid to 30 feet (10 yards) on a drawing of
a (U.S.) football field. This kind of setting makes
your work easier as you draw.
Another approach is to choose a grid spacing
that represents a specific distance, such as 1
inch or 25 millimeters, on your final plot. If you
want the grid to represent 1 inch on the plot and
your drawing units are inches, enter the draw-
ing scale factor. For example, in a 1⁄4” = 1’–0”
drawing, you’d enter the drawing scale factor
of 48. A 48-inch grid interval in your drawing
corresponds to a 1-inch interval on the plot
when you plot to scale. If your drawing units are
millimeters and you want the grid to represent
25 millimeters on the plot, enter the drawing
scale factor times 25. For example, in a 1:50
drawing, you’d enter 25 x 50, or 1250.
In most cases, you’ll want to set the snap inter-
val considerably smaller than the grid spacing.
A good rule is to start with a snap spacing in the
range of the size of the smallest objects that
you’ll be drawing — 6 inches or 100 millimeters
for a building plan, 0.5 inches or 5 millimeters for
an architectural detail, 1⁄16 inch or 1 millimeter
for a small mechanical component, and so on.
Leaving the grid on in your drawing all the time is
worthwhile because it provides a visual reminder
of how far apart things are. This visual reference
is especially useful as you zoom in and out.
You don’t always want to leave snap turned on,
however. Some drawings, such as contour
maps, are made up mostly of objects with weird,
uneven measurements. Even drawings with
many objects that fall on convenient spacings
will have some unruly objects that don’t. In addi-
tion, you sometimes need to turn off snap tem-
porarily to select objects. Despite these
caveats, snap is a useful tool in most drawings. 
Setting the snap spacing to a reasonable value
when you set up a new drawing is a good idea.
Toggle snap off (by clicking the SNAP button on
the status bar or pressing the F9 key) when you
don’t need it or find that it’s getting in the way.
Toggle snap on before drawing objects that
align with specific spacings, including text and
dimension strings that you want to align neatly.
To use snap effectively, you need to make the
snap setting smaller as you zoom in and work
on more detailed areas, and larger as you zoom
back out. You are likely to find yourself chang-
ing the snap setting fairly frequently. The grid
setting, on the other hand, can usually remain
constant even as you work at different zoom
settings; that keeps you oriented as to how far
zoomed in you are in the drawing.

As soon as you start adding dimensions (measurements that show the size of
the things you’re drawing) and using dash-dot linetypes (line patterns that
contain gaps in them), you need to tell AutoCAD how to scale the parts of the
dimensions and the gaps in the linetypes based on the plot scale. If you
forget this, the dimension text and arrowheads can come out very tiny or
very large when you plot the drawing, and dash-dot linetype patterns can
look waaaay too big or too small. Figure 3-7 shows what I mean.
The scale factor that controls dash-dot linetypes is found in a system variable
called LTSCALE (as in LineType SCALE). The scaling factor that controls
dimensions is found in a system variable called DIMSCALE. You can change
either of these settings at any time, but it’s best to set them correctly when
you’re setting up the drawing.
The following sequence includes directions for typing system variable and
command names. When the names are mixed case (for example, LTScale),
you can type the full name (LTSCALE) or just the letters shown in uppercase
(LTS) before pressing Enter.
To set the linetype scale from the command line, follow these steps:
1. Type LTScale on the command line and press Enter.
AutoCAD responds with a prompt, asking you for the scale factor. The
value at the end of the prompt is the current linetype scale setting, as in
the following example:
Enter new linetype scale factor <1.0000>:
2. Type the value you want for the linetype scale on the command line
and press Enter.
The easiest choice is to set the linetype scale to the drawing scale factor.
Some people (myself included) find that the dashes and gaps in dash-
dot linetypes get a bit too long when they use the drawing scale factor. 
If you’re one of those people, set LTSCALE to one-half of the drawing
scale factor.
Figure 3-7:
The
dimension
and linetype
scales need

60
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Alternatively, you can set LTSCALE in the Linetype Manager dialog box:
Choose Format➪Linetype, click the Show Details button, and type your
desired linetype scale in the Global Scale Factor edit box.
To change the dimension scale, use the Dimension Style Manager dialog box. I
describe dimensions in detail in Chapter 10, but you should get in the habit of
setting the dimension scale during drawing setup. To do so, follow these steps: 
1. Choose Format➪Dimension Style from the menu bar, or enter
Dimstyle at the command line.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box appears. New drawings contain
the default dimension style named Standard (for English units drawings)
or ISO25 (for metric drawings).
2. Click the Modify button.
The Modify Dimension Style dialog box appears.
3. Click the Fit tab.
The Fit tab options appear, including an area called Scale for Dimension
Features.
4. In the Scale for Dimension Features area, make sure that the radio
button next to the Use Overall Scale Of setting is selected.
5. In the text box next to Use Overall Scale Of, type the drawing scale
factor for the current drawing.
I told you that you’d be using that drawing scale factor a lot!
6. Click OK to close the Modify Dimension Style dialog box.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box reappears.
7. Click Close.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box closes. Now when you draw
dimensions (see Chapter 10), AutoCAD will scale the dimension text and
arrowheads correctly.
Before you start creating dimensions, create your own dimension style(s) for
the settings that you want to use. Chapter 10 explains why and how.
Entering drawing properties
You need to do one last bit of bookkeeping before you’re finished with model
space drawing setup: Enter summary information in the Drawing Properties
dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-8. Choose File➪Drawing Properties to open
the Drawing Properties dialog box and then click the Summary tab. Enter the
drawing scale you’re using and the drawing scale factor, plus any other infor-
mation you think useful. 
61
Chapter 3: Setup for Success

Plot Layouts for Any Palate
As I describe in Chapter 2, paper space is a separate space in each drawing
for composing a printed version of that drawing. You create the drawing
itself, called the model, in model space. You then can create one or more plot-
table views, complete with title block. Each of these plottable views is called
a layout. AutoCAD saves separate plot settings with each layout — and with
the Model tab — so that you can plot each tab differently. In practice, you’ll
need to use only one of the paper space layout tabs, especially when you’re
getting started with AutoCAD.
A screen image is worth a thousand paper space explanations. If you haven’t
yet seen an example out in the wild, refer to Figures 2-7 and 2-8 in Chapter 2.
You also may want to open a few of the AutoCAD 2004 sample drawings and
click the Model and layout tabs to witness the variety of ways in which paper
space is used. A good place to start is \Program Files\AutoCAD 2005\
Sample\Wilhome.dwg.
After you complete model space setup, you should create a layout for plot-
ting. You don’t need to create the plotting layout right after you create the
drawing and do model space setup; you can wait until after you’ve drawn
some geometry. You should set up a layout sooner, not later, however. If any
scale or sheet size problems exist, it’s better to discover them early.
In AutoCAD 2005, it’s still possible to ignore paper space layouts entirely and
do all your drawing and plotting in model space. But you owe it to yourself to
give layouts a try. You’ll probably find that they make plotting more consis-
tent and predictable. They’ll certainly give you more plotting flexibility when
Figure 3-8:
Surveying
your
drawing’s
properties.
62
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

you need it. And you’ll certainly encounter drawings from other people that
make extensive use of paper space, so you need to understand it if you plan
to exchange drawings with anyone else.
Creating a layout
Creating a simple paper space layout is straightforward, thanks to the
AutoCAD 2005 Create Layout Wizard, shown in Figure 3-9. (Yes! Finally, a
useful AutoCAD wizard.) The command name is LAYOUTWIZARD, which is
not to be confused with the WAYOUTLIZARD command for drawing geckos
and iguanas! In any event, you can avoid a lot of typing by choosing Tools➪
Wizards➪Create Layout.
Although the Create Layout Wizard guides you step by step through the
process of creating a paper space layout from scratch, it doesn’t eliminate the
necessity of coming up with a sensible set of layout parameters. The sheet size
and plot scale that you choose provide a certain amount of space for showing
your model (see the information earlier in this chapter), and wizards aren’t
allowed to bend the laws of arithmetic to escape that fact. For example, a map
of Texas at a scale of 1 inch = 1 foot won’t fit on an -x-11-inch sheet, no way, no
how. In other words, garbage in, garbage (lay)out. Fortunately the Create
Layout Wizard lends itself to experimentation, and you can easily delete lay-
outs that don’t work.
Follow these steps to create a layout:
1. Choose Tools➪Wizards➪Create Layout, or type LAYOUTWIZARD and
press Enter.
2. Give the new layout a name and then click Next.
Figure 3-9:
The Create
Layout
Wizard.
63
Chapter 3: Setup for Success

In place of the default name, Layout3, I recommend something more
descriptive — for example, D Size Sheet.
3. Choose a printer or plotter to use when plotting this layout, and then
click Next.
Think of your choice as the default plotter for this layout. You can
change to a different plotter later, or create page setups that plot the
same layout on different plotters.
Many of the names in the configured plotter list should look familiar
because they’re your Windows printers (system printers in AutoCAD
lingo). Names with a PC3 extension represent nonsystem printer drivers.
See Chapter 12 for details.
4. Choose a paper size and specify whether to use inches or millimeters
to represent paper units, and then click Next.
The available paper sizes depend on the printer or plotter that you
selected in Step 3.
5. Specify the orientation of the drawing on the paper, and then click
Next.
The icon showing the letter A on the piece of paper shows you which
orientation is which.
6. Select a title block, or None (see Figure 3-10). 
If you choose a title block, specify whether AutoCAD should insert it as a
Block — which is preferable in this case — or attach it as an xref. Then
click Next.
Attaching a title block as an xref is a good practice if your title block
DWG file is in the same folder as the drawing that you’re working on.
The Create Layout Wizard’s title blocks live in the Template folder that’s
Figure 3-10:
Title block
options in
the Create
Layout
Wizard.
64
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

stored with the AutoCAD Application Data files under your Windows
user profile, which isn’t — or shouldn’t be — where you keep your pro-
ject files. Thus, in this case Block is a safer choice.
Choose a title block that fits your paper size. If the title block is larger
than the paper, the Create Layout Wizard simply lets it run off the paper.
If you don’t like any of the supplied title blocks, choose None. You can
always draw, insert, or xref a title block later. See Chapter 13 for informa-
tion about inserting or xrefing a title block.
The list of available title blocks comes from all the DWG files in your
AutoCAD Template folder. You can add custom title block drawings to this
directory (and delete ones that you never use). If you want to know where
to put them, see “Cooking Up Terrific Templates,” later in this chapter.
7. Define the arrangement of viewports that AutoCAD should create, and
the paper space to model space scale for all viewports. Then click
Next.
A paper space layout viewport is a window into model space. You must
create at least one viewport to display the model in your new layout. For
most 2D drawings, a single viewport is all you need. 3D models often
benefit from multiple viewports, each showing the 3D model from a dif-
ferent perspective.
The default Viewport scale, Scaled to Fit, ensures that all of your model
drawing displays in the viewport but results in an arbitrary scale factor.
Most technical drawings require a specific scale, such as 1 = 10 or 1⁄8” =
1’–0”.
8. Specify the location of the viewport(s) on the paper by picking its cor-
ners. Then click Next.
After you click the Select Location button, the Create Layout Wizard dis-
plays the preliminary layout with any title block that you’ve chosen.
Pick two points to define a rectangle that falls within the drawing area of
your title block (or within the plottable area of the sheet, if you chose no
title block in Step 6).
AutoCAD represents the plottable area of the sheet with a dashed rec-
tangle near the edge of the sheet. If you don’t select a location for the
viewport(s), the Create Layout Wizard creates a viewport that fills the
plottable area of the sheet.
9. Click Finish.
AutoCAD creates the new layout.
If your projects require lots of drawings, you can parlay layouts into sheet
sets — a new feature in AutoCAD 2005 that makes for more sophisticated cre-
ation, management, plotting, and electronic transfer of multi-sheet drawing
sets. See Chapter 14 for details.
65
Chapter 3: Setup for Success

Copying and changing layouts
After you create a layout, you can delete, copy, rename, and otherwise manip-
ulate it by right-clicking its tab. Figure 3-11 shows the right-click menu options.
The From Template option refers to layout templates. After you create layouts
in a template (DWT) or drawing (DWG) file, you use the From Template option
to import these layouts into the current drawing. For details, see the LAYOUT
command’s Template option in the Command Reference section of online help.
Many drawings require only one paper space layout. If you always plot the
same view of the model and always plot to the same device and on the same
size paper, a single paper space layout should suffice. If you want to plot your
model in different ways (for example, at different scales, with different layers
visible, with different areas visible, or with different plotted line characteris-
tics), you may want to create additional paper space layouts.
Some different ways of plotting the same model can be handled in a single
paper space layout with different page setups. See Chapter 12 for more details. 
Figure 3-11:
The right-
click menu
for a 
layout tab.
66
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

If you want to add another viewport to an existing layout, you need to become
familiar with the MVIEW command and the ZOOM command’s mysterious XP
option. See the MVIEW and ZOOM commands in the Command Reference 
section of AutoCAD online help. After you have the concepts down, using 
the Viewports dialog box (choose View➪Viewports➪New Viewports) and
Viewports toolbar can help you create and manage viewports more efficiently.
Lost in paper space
After you create a paper space layout, you suddenly have two views of the
same drawing geometry: the view on your original Model tab and the new
layout tab view (perhaps decorated with a handsome title block and other
accoutrements of plotting nobility). It’s important to realize that both views
are of the same geometry. If you change the model geometry on one tab,
you’re changing it on all tabs, because all tabs display the same model space
objects. It’s like seeing double after downing a few too many drinks — the
duplication is in your head, not in the real world (or in this case, in the CAD
world).
When you make a paper space layout current by clicking its tab, you can
move the cursor between paper space (that is, drawing and zooming on the
sheet of paper) and model space (drawing and zooming on the model, inside
the viewport) in several ways, including:
 Clicking the PAPER/MODEL button on the status bar
 In the drawing area, double-clicking over a viewport to move the cursor
into model space in that viewport, or double-clicking outside all view-
ports (for example, in the gray area outside the sheet) to move the
cursor into paper space
 Entering MSpace or PSpace at the command prompt
When the cursor is in model space, anything you draw or edit changes the
model (and thus appears on the Model tab and on all paper space layout tabs,
assuming that the given paper space layout displays that part of the underlying
model). When the cursor is in paper space, anything you draw appears only on
that one paper space layout tab. It’s as though you were drawing on an acetate
sheet over the top of that sheet of plotter paper — the model beneath remains
unaffected.
This distinction can be disorienting at first — even if you haven’t had a few
too many drinks. To avoid confusion, stick with the following approach (at
least until you’re more familiar with paper space):
 If you want to edit the model, switch to the Model tab first. (Don’t try to
edit the model in a paper space viewport.)

Chapter 3: Setup for Success

 If you want to edit a particular plot layout without affecting the model,
switch to that layout’s tab and make sure that the cursor is in paper
space.
Cooking Up Terrific Templates
You can create a template from any DWG file by using the Save As dialog box.
Follow these steps to save your drawing as a template:
1. Choose File➪Save As from the menu bar.
The Save Drawing As dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-12.
2. From the Save As Type pull-down menu, choose AutoCAD Drawing
Template (*.dwt).
3. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the drawing.
AutoCAD 2005’s default folder for template drawings is called Template
and is buried deep in the bowels of your Windows user profile. Save
your templates there if you want them to appear in the AutoCAD’s Select
Template list. You can save your templates in another folder, but if you
want to use them later, you’ll have to navigate to that folder each time to
use them. See the Technical Stuff paragraph after this procedure for
additional suggestions.
4. Enter a name for the drawing template in the File Name text box.
5. Click the Save button to save your drawing template.
Figure 3-12:
Saving a

68
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

The drawing is saved as a template. A dialog box for the template
description and units appears.
6. Enter the template’s measurement units (English or Metric).
Enter the key info now; you can’t do it later unless you save the template
to a different name. Don’t bother filling in the Description field. AutoCAD
doesn’t display it later in the Select Template dialog box.
7. Click OK to save the file.
8. To save your drawing as a regular drawing, choose File➪Save As from
the menu bar.
The Save Drawing As dialog box appears again.
9. From the Save As Type pull-down menu, choose AutoCAD 2004
Drawing (*.dwg).
AutoCAD 2005 uses the same DWG file format as AutoCAD 2004, so the
file type is listed that way.
10. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the drawing.
Use a different folder from the one with your template drawings.
11. Enter the name of the drawing in the File Name text box.
12. Click the Save button to save your drawing.
The file is saved. Now, when you save it in the future, the regular file, not
the template file, gets updated.
AutoCAD 2005 includes a new command called QNEW (“Quick NEW”), which,
when properly configured, can bypass the Select Template dialog box and
create a new drawing from your favorite template. The first button on the
Standard toolbar — the one with the plain white sheet of paper — runs the
new QNEW command instead of the old NEW command.
To put the Quick into QNEW, though, you have to tell AutoCAD which default
template to use: Choose Tools➪Options➪Files➪Drawing Template Settings➪
Default Template File for QNEW. AutoCAD 2005’s default setting for Default
Template File for QNEW is None, which causes QNEW to act just like NEW
(that is, QNEW opens the Select Template dialog box). 
AutoCAD 2005, unlike AutoCAD 2002 and earlier versions, stores template
drawings and many other support files under your Windows user folder. If you
want to discover where your Template folder is, choose Tools➪Options➪
Files➪Drawing Template Settings➪Drawing Template File Location. In all likeli-
hood, your Template folder lives under a hidden folder, so you won’t at first 
be able to see it in Windows Explorer. If you want to find the template folder,
choose Tools➪Folder Options➪View in Windows Explorer. Set the Hidden Files
and Folders setting to Show Hidden Files and Folders, click the OK button, and
then choose View➪Refresh. (After you snoop around, you’ll probably want to
switch back to Do Not Show Hidden Files and Folders.)
69
Chapter 3: Setup for Success

If you want to avoid this nonsense, create a folder where you can find it easily
(for example, C:\Acad-templates or F:\Acad-custom\templates on a net-
work drive). Put the templates that you actually use there and change the
Drawing Template File Location so that it points to your new template folder.
As this chapter demonstrates, there’s quite a bit to drawing setup in
AutoCAD. As with any other initially forbidding task, take it step by step and
soon the sequence will seem natural. The Drawing Setup Roadmap on the
Cheat Sheet will help you stay on track and avoid missing a step.

L
ines, circles, and other elements of geometry make
up the heart of your drawing. AutoCAD offers many
different drawing commands, many ways to use them to
draw objects precisely, and many properties for control-
ling the objects’ display and plot appearance. After you
draw your geometry, you’ll probably spend at least as
much time editing it as your design and drawings evolve.
And in the process, you need to zoom in and out and pan
all around to see how the entire drawing is coming
together. Drawing geometry, editing it, and changing the
displayed view are the foundation of the drawing process;
this part shows you how to make that foundation solid.
And for those who want to build a little higher, this sec-
tion ends with an introduction to 3D modeling and

AD programs are different from other drawing programs. You need to
pay attention to little details like object properties and the precision of
the points that you specify when you draw and edit objects. If you just start
drawing objects without taking heed of these details, you’ll end up with an
unruly mess of imprecise geometry that’s hard to edit, view, and plot. 
This chapter introduces you to the AutoCAD tools and techniques that help
you prevent making CAD messes. This information is essential before you
start drawing objects and editing them, which I describe in Chapters 5 and 6.
Drawing and Editing with AutoCAD
When you first start using AutoCAD, its most daunting requirement is the
number of property settings and precision controls that you need to pay
attention to — even when you draw a simple line. Unlike in many other pro-
grams, it’s not enough to draw a line in a more-or-less adequate location and
then slap some color on it. All those settings and controls can inspire the
feeling that you have to find out how to pilot an airliner to make a trip down
the street. (The advantage is that, after you are comfortable in the cockpit,
AutoCAD will take you on the long-haul trips and get you there faster.) 

These are the three keys to good CAD drawing practice:
 Pay attention to and manage the properties of every object that you
draw — especially the layer that each object is on.
 Pay attention to and manage the named objects in every drawing — the
layers, text styles, block definitions, and other nongraphical objects that
serve to define the look of all the graphical objects in the drawing.
 Pay attention to and control the precision of every point and distance
that you use to draw and edit each object.
These can seem like daunting tasks at first, but the following three sections
help you cut them down to size.
Managing Your Properties
All the objects that you draw in AutoCAD are like good Monopoly players: They
own properties. In AutoCAD, these properties aren’t physical things; they’re an
object’s characteristics such as layer, color, linetype, and lineweight. You use
properties to communicate information about the characteristics of the objects
you draw, such as the kinds of real-world objects they represent, their materials,
their relative location in space, or their relative importance. In CAD, you also
use the properties to organize objects for editing and plotting purposes.
You can view — and change — all of an object’s properties in the Properties
palette. In Figure 4-1, the Properties palette shows properties for a line object.
Figure 4-1:
A line 
rich in
properties.
74
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

To toggle the Properties palette on and off, click the Properties button on the
Standard toolbar. Before you select an object, the Properties palette displays
the current properties — properties that AutoCAD applies to new objects
when you draw them. After you select an object, AutoCAD displays the prop-
erties for that object. If you select more than one object, AutoCAD displays
the properties that they have in common.
Putting it on a layer
Every object has a layer as one of its properties. You may be familiar with
layers — independent drawing spaces that stack on top of each other to
create an overall image — from using drawing programs. AutoCAD, like most
CAD programs, uses layers as the primary organizing principle for all the
objects that you draw. Layers organize objects into logical groups of things
that belong together; for example, walls, furniture, and text notes usually
belong on three separate layers, for a couple of reasons: 
 They give you a way to turn groups of objects on and off — both on the
screen and on the plot. 
 They provide the best way of controlling object color, linetype, and
lineweight.
75
Chapter 4: Get Ready to Draw
Looking at layers
If you spent any time “on the boards,” as griz-
zled old-timers like to call paper-and-pencil
drafting, you may be familiar with the manual
drafting equivalent of layers. In pin-bar drafting,
you stack a series of transparent Mylar sheets,
each of which contains a part of the overall
drawing — walls on one sheet, the plumbing
system on another, the electrical system on
another, and so on. You can get different views
of the drawing set by including or excluding var-
ious sheets. 
If you’re too young to remember pin-bar 
drafting — or old enough to prefer not to — 
you may remember something similar from a
textbook about human anatomy. There’s the
skeleton on one sheet, the muscles on the next
sheet that you laid over the skeleton, and so on
until you built up a complete picture of the
human body — that is, if your parents didn’t
remove some of the more grown-up sections.
CAD layers serve a similar purpose; they enable
you to turn on or off groups of related objects.
But layers do a lot more. You use them in
AutoCAD to control other object display and plot
properties, such as color, linetype, and
lineweight. You also can use them to make
some editing tasks more efficient and reduce
the time that it takes AutoCAD to load some
drawings. Take the time to give each of your
drawings a suitably layered look.

You create layers, assign them names, assign them properties such as color
and linetype, and then put objects on them. When you draw an object,
AutoCAD automatically puts it on the current layer, which appears in the
drop-down list on the Layers toolbar.
Before you draw any object in AutoCAD, you should set an appropriate layer
current — creating it first, if necessary, using the procedure described later
in this section. If the layer already exists in your drawing, you can make it the
current layer by choosing it in the Layers toolbar, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Make sure that no objects are selected before you use the Layer drop-down
list to change the current layer. (Press the Esc key twice to be sure.) If objects
are selected, the Layer drop-down list displays — and lets you change —
those objects’ layer. When no objects are selected, the Layer drop-down list
displays — and lets you change — the current layer.
If you forget to set an appropriate layer before you draw an object, you can
select the object and then change its layer by using either the Properties
palette or the Layer drop-down list.
Figure 4-2:

layer before
you draw.

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Accumulating properties
Besides layers, the remaining object properties that you’re likely to want to
use often are color, linetype, lineweight, and possibly plot style. Table 4-1
summarizes these four properties.
Table 4-1

Controls
Color
Displayed color and plotted color or lineweight
Linetype

Lineweight

Plotted characteristics (see Chapter 12)
In Release 14 and older versions of AutoCAD, color also controlled the plot-
ted lineweight of each object — strange, but now very common in the
AutoCAD world. You may find yourself working this way even in AutoCAD
2005, for compatibility with drawings (and co-workers) that use the old way,
as described in the “About colors and lineweights” sidebar.
AutoCAD gives you two different ways of controlling object properties:
 By layer: Each layer has a default color, linetype, lineweight, and plot
style property. Unless you tell AutoCAD otherwise, objects inherit the
properties of the layers on which they’re created. AutoCAD calls this
approach controlling properties by layer.
77
Chapter 4: Get Ready to Draw
Stacking up your layers
How do you decide what to call your layers and
which objects to put on them? Some industries
have developed layer guidelines, and many
offices have created documented layer stan-
dards. Some projects even impose specific
layer requirements. (But be careful; if someone
says, “You need a brick layer for this project,”
that can mean a couple of different things.) Ask
experienced CAD drafters in your office or
industry how they use layers in AutoCAD. If you
can’t find any definitive answer, create a chart
of layers for yourself. Each row in the chart
should list the layer name, default color, default
linetype, default lineweight, and what kinds 
of objects belong on that layer. Chapter 15
includes an example.

 By object: AutoCAD also enables you to override an object’s layer’s
property setting and give the object a specific color, linetype, lineweight,
or plot style that differs from the layer’s. AutoCAD calls this approach
controlling properties by object.
If you’ve worked with other graphics programs, you may be used to assigning
properties such as color to specific objects. If so, you’ll be tempted to use the
by object approach to assigning properties in AutoCAD. Resist the tempta-
tion. In almost all cases, it’s better to create layers, assign properties to each
layer, and let the objects on each layer inherit that layer’s properties. Here
are some benefits of using the by layer approach:
 You can easily change the properties of a group of related objects that
you put on one layer. You simply change the property for the layer, not
for a bunch of separate objects.
 Experienced drafters use the by layer approach, so if you work with
drawings from other people, you’ll be much more compatible with them
if you do it the same way. You’ll also avoid getting yelled at by irate CAD
managers, whose jobs include haranguing any hapless newbies who
assign properties by object.
78
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
About colors and lineweights
AutoCAD drafters traditionally have achieved dif-
ferent printed lineweights by mapping various
on-screen display colors of drawing objects to
different plotted lineweights. An AutoCAD-using
company may decide that red lines are to be
plotted thin, green lines are to be plotted thicker,
and so on. This indirect approach sounds
strange, but until AutoCAD 2000, it was the only
practical way to plot from AutoCAD with a vari-
ety of lineweights. Also, not many people plotted
in color until recently, so few folks minded the
fact that color was used to serve a different
master.
AutoCAD 2000 added lineweight as an inherent
property of objects and the layers that they live
on. Thus, object display color can revert to
being used for — surprise! — color. You can
use display colors to control plot colors, of
course. But even if you make monochrome
plots, you can use color to help you distinguish
different kinds of objects when you view them
on-screen or to make jazzy on-screen presen-
tations of drawings for others.
Lineweights are handy, but they have quirks.
Watch for these problems as you work with
them:
 Although lineweights may have been
assigned to objects in a drawing that you
open, you won’t necessarily see them on
the screen. You must turn on the Show/Hide
Lineweight button on the AutoCAD status
bar (the button labeled LWT). 
 On a slow computer or a complex drawing,
showing lineweights may cause AutoCAD
to redraw the screen more slowly when you
zoom and pan. 
 You may need to zoom in on a portion of the
drawing before the differing lineweights
become apparent.

If you take my advice and assign properties by layer, all you have to do is set
layer properties in the Layer Properties Manager dialog box, as shown in
Figure 4-3. Before you draw any objects, make sure the Color Control, Linetype
Control, Lineweight Control, and Plotstyle Control drop-down lists on the
Properties toolbar are set to ByLayer, as shown in Figure 4-4.
If the drawing is set to use color-based plot styles instead of named plot
styles (see Chapter 12), the Plotstyle Control drop-down list will be inactive
and will display ByColor.
If you don’t like doing things the wrong way and getting yelled at by CAD
managers, don’t assign properties to objects in either of these ways:
 Don’t choose a specific color, linetype, lineweight, or plot style from the
appropriate drop-down list on the Object Properties toolbar, and then
draw the objects. 
 Don’t draw the objects, select them, and then choose a property from
the same drop-down lists. 
If you prefer to do things the right way, assign these properties by layer, as I
describe in this section.

Creating new layers
If a suitable layer doesn’t exist, you need to create one by using the Layer
Properties Manager dialog box. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Layer Properties Manager button on the Layers toolbar; or
type LAyer at the command line and press Enter.
The Layer Properties Manager dialog box appears. A new drawing has
only one layer, Layer 0. You need to add the layers you need for your
drawing.
2. Click the New Layer button (the little yellow explosion just above the
Status column) to create a new layer.
A new layer appears. AutoCAD names it Layer1, but you can type a new
name to replace it easily, as shown in Figure 4-5.
3. Type a name for the new layer.
For the following reasons, type the layer name with initial caps (only the
first letter of words in uppercase) if you can: 
• Layer names written completely in uppercase are much wider,
which means that they often get truncated in the Layers toolbar’s
Layer drop-down list.
• Uppercase layer names look like they’re SHOUTING, which is not
very polite. 
4. On the same line as the new layer, click the color block or color name
(White) of the new layer.
The Select Color dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-5:

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

The normal AutoCAD color scheme — AutoCAD Color Index (ACI) —
provides 255 colors. So many choices are nice for rendering work but
overkill for ordinary drafting. 
For now, stick with the first nine colors — the ones that appear in a
single, separate row to the left of the ByLayer and ByBlock buttons on
the Index Color tab of the Select Color dialog box. 
• These colors are easy to distinguish from one another. 
• Using a small number of colors makes configuring your plot para-
meters easier. (I describe the procedure in Chapter 12.)
AutoCAD (but not AutoCAD LT) provides an even more extravagant set
of color choices than the 255 shown on the ACI tab. In the Select Color
dialog box, the True Color tab offers a choice of more than 16 million
colors, which you can specify by using HSL (Hue Saturation Luminance)
or RGB (Red Green Blue) numbers. The Color Book tab enables you to
use PANTONE and RAL color schemes, which are popular in publishing.
If your work requires tons of colors or close color matching between the
computer screen and printed output, you’re probably familiar with the
relevant color palette and how to use it. If you’re using AutoCAD for ordi-
nary drafting or design, stick with the AutoCAD Color Index palette.
5. Click a color to select it as the color for this layer; then click OK.
The Layer Properties Manager dialog box reappears. In the Name list,
the color for the new layer changes to either the name or the number 
of the color that you selected.
AutoCAD’s first seven colors have both assigned numbers and standard
names: 1 = red, 2 = yellow, 3 = green, 4 = cyan, 5 = blue, 6 = magenta, and
7 = white (but it appears black when displayed on a white background).
The remaining 248 colors have numbers only. You can play fashion
designer and make up your own names for these colors. How about
Overly Oxidized Ocher for color number 16?

Chapter 4: Get Ready to Draw

6. On the same line as the new layer, click the Linetype name of the 
new layer.
The default AutoCAD linetype is Continuous, which means no gaps in
the line.
The Select Linetype dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-7.
If you already loaded the linetypes you need for your drawing, the Select
Linetype dialog box displays them in the Loaded Linetypes list. If not,
click the Load button to open the Load or Reload Linetypes dialog box.
By default, AutoCAD displays linetypes from the standard AutoCAD 2004
linetype definition file — Acad.lin for imperial units drawings or
Acadiso.lin for metric units drawings. Load the desired linetype by
selecting its name and clicking the OK button.
The linetypes whose names begin with ACAD_ISO are for people who
use ISO (International Organization for Standardization) linetype pat-
terns. If you don’t follow ISO standards, you’ll probably find it easier to
use the linetypes with the more descriptive names: CENTER, DASHED,
and so on.
7. Click the desired linetype in the Loaded Linetypes list to select it as
the linetype for the layer; then click OK.
The Select Linetype dialog box disappears, returning you to the Layer
Properties Manager dialog box. In the Name list, the linetype for the
selected layer changes to the linetype you just chose.
8. On the same line as the new layer, click the new layer’s lineweight.
The Lineweight dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-8.
9. Select the lineweight you want from the scrolling list, then click OK.
The lineweight 0.00 mm tells AutoCAD to use the thinnest possible
lineweight on the screen and on the plot. I recommend that, for now, you
leave lineweight set to Default and instead map screen color to plotted
lineweight, as described briefly in the “About colors and lineweights”
sidebar earlier in this chapter and in greater detail in Chapter 12. 
Figure 4-7:
The Select
Linetype
dialog box.
82
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

The default lineweight for the current drawing is defined in the Lineweight
Settings dialog box. After you close the Layer Properties Manager dialog
box, choose Format➪Lineweight or enter LWeight at the command line to
change the default lineweight.
You use the plot style property to assign a named plot style to the layer,
but only if you’re using named plot styles in the drawing (Chapter 12
explains why you probably don’t want to). The final property, Plot, con-
trols whether the layer’s objects appear on plots. Toggle this setting off
for any layer whose objects you want to see on the screen but hide on
plots.
10. If you want to add a description to the layer, scroll the layer list to the
right to see the Description column, click twice in the Description box
corresponding to your new layer, and type a description.
Layer descriptions are a new feature of AutoCAD 2005. If you choose to
use them, stretch the Layer Properties Manager dialog box to the right so
that you can see the descriptions without having to scroll the layer list.
11. Repeat Steps 2 through 10 to create any other layers that you want. 
12. Select the new layer that you want to make current and click the Set
Current button (the green check mark).
The current layer is the one on which AutoCAD places new objects that
you draw.
13. Click OK to accept the new layer settings.
The Layer drop-down list on the Layers toolbar now displays your new
layer as the current layer.
After you create layers, you can set any one of them to be the current layer.
Make sure that no objects are selected; then choose the layer name from the
Layer drop-down list on the Layers toolbar.
Figure 4-8:
The
Lineweight
dialog box.
83
Chapter 4: Get Ready to Draw

After you create layers and drawn objects on them, you use the Layer
Properties Manager dialog box to change layer properties. For example, you
can turn a layer off or on to hide or show the objects on that layer.
If you find yourself using lots of layers, you can create layer filters to make
viewing and managing the layer list easier. AutoCAD 2005 provides two kinds
of layer filters: group and property. A group filter is simply a subset of layers
that you choose (by dragging layer names into the group filter name or by
selecting objects in the drawing). A property filter is a subset of layers that
AutoCAD creates and updates automatically based on layer property criteria
that you define (for example, all layer names whose names contain the text
Wall or whose color is green). To find out more, click the Help button on the
Layer Properties Manager dialog box and read about the New Property Filter
and New Group Filter buttons.
84
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
A load of linetypes
My layer creation procedure demonstrates how
to load a single linetype, but AutoCAD comes
with a whole lot of linetypes, and there are other
ways of working with them. You don’t have to go
through the Layer Properties Manager dialog
box to load linetypes. You can perform the full
range of linetype management tasks by choos-
ing Format➪Linetype, which displays the
Linetype Manager dialog box. This dialog box is
similar to the Select Linetype dialog box
described in the layer creation procedure, but it
includes some additional options.
After you click the Load button to display the
Load or Reload Linetypes dialog box, you can
load multiple linetypes in one fell swoop by
holding down the Shift or Ctrl key while you click
linetype names. As in most Windows dialog
boxes, Shift+click selects all objects between
the first and second clicks, and Ctrl+click
enables you to select multiple objects, even if
they aren’t next to each other.
When you load a linetype, AutoCAD copies its
linetype definition — a recipe for how to create
the dashes, dots, and gaps in that particular
linetype — from the Acad.lin (imperial units)
or Acadiso.lin (metric units) file into the
drawing. The recipe doesn’t automatically
appear in other drawings; you have to load each
linetype that you want to use into each drawing
in which you want to use it. If you find yourself
loading the same linetypes repeatedly into dif-
ferent drawings, consider adding them to your
template drawings instead. (See Chapter 3 for
information about templates and how to create
them.) After you add linetypes to a template
drawing, all new drawings that you create from
that template will start with those linetypes
loaded automatically.
Don’t go overboard on loading linetypes. For
example, you don’t need to load all the linetypes
in the Acad.lin file on the off chance that you
might use them all someday. The resulting line-
type list would be long and unwieldy. Most
drawings require only a few linetypes, and most
industries and companies settle on a half dozen
or so linetypes for common use. Your industry,
office, or project may have guidelines about
which linetypes to use for which purposes.
If you’re the creative type and don’t mind edit-
ing a text file that contains linetype definitions,
you can define your own linetypes. Choose
Contents➪Customization Guide➪Custom Line-
types in the AutoCAD 2005 online help system.

Using AutoCAD DesignCenter
DesignCenter is a dumb name for a useful, if somewhat busy, palette. (Chapter
2 describes how to turn on and work with palettes.) The DesignCenter palette
is handy for mining data from all kinds of drawings. Whereas the Properties
palette, described earlier in this chapter, is concerned with object properties,
the DesignCenter palette deals primarily with named objects: layers, linetypes,
block (that is, symbol) definitions, text styles, and other organizational objects
in your drawings.
Named objects
Every drawing includes a set of symbol tables, which contain named objects.
For example, the layer table contains a list of the layers in the current drawing,
along with the settings for each layer (color, linetype, on/off setting, and so
on). Each of these table objects, be it a layer or some other type, has a name,
so Autodesk decided to call them named objects (duh!).
Neither the symbol tables nor the named objects appear as graphical objects
in your drawing. They’re like hardworking stagehands who keep the show
running smoothly behind the scenes. The named objects include
 Layers (this chapter)
 Linetypes (this chapter)
 Text styles (Chapter 9)
 Dimension styles (Chapter 10)
 Block definitions and xrefs (Chapter 13)
 Layouts (Chapter 3)
When you use commands such as LAyer, LineType, and Dimstyle, you are cre-
ating and editing named objects. After you’ve created named objects in a
drawing, DesignCenter gives you the tools to copy them to other drawings.
Getting (Design)Centered
The DesignCenter palette (shown in Figure 4-9) consists of a toolbar at the
top, a set of tabs below that, a navigation pane on the left, and a content pane
on the right. The navigation pane displays a tree view with drawing files and
the symbol tables contained in each drawing. The content pane usually dis-
plays the contents of the drawing or symbol table.
85
Chapter 4: Get Ready to Draw

The four tabs just below the DesignCenter toolbar control what you see in
the navigation and content panes:

The toolbar buttons further refine what you see in the navigation and content
panes. A few of these buttons toggle off and on different parts of the panes. If
your DesignCenter palette is missing an area that appears in Figure 4-9, click
each of the buttons until the missing part reappears. 
Follow these steps to use DesignCenter:
1. Load the drawing(s) whose content you want to view or use into the
navigation pane on the left.
If a drawing doesn’t appear on the Open Drawings tab, click the Load
button — the first one on the DesignCenter toolbar — to load it into the
navigation pane.
2. Navigate the symbol tables (such as blocks and layers), viewing their
individual named objects in the content pane on the right.
3. If you need them, drag or copy and paste individual named objects
from the content pane into other open AutoCAD drawings.
Copying layers between drawings
The following steps copy layers from one drawing to another using Design-
Center. You can use the same technique to copy dimension styles, layouts,
linetypes, and text styles.
1. Toggle the DesignCenter palette on by choosing the DesignCenter
button on the Standard toolbar or pressing Ctrl+2.
2. Open or create a drawing containing named objects you want to copy.
You can also use the Folders tab, the Open button, or the Search button
to load a drawing into DesignCenter without opening it in AutoCAD.
3. Open or create a second drawing to which you want to copy the
named objects.
4. Click the Open Drawings tab to display your two currently opened
drawings in DesignCenter’s navigation pane on the left.
If you used the Folders tab, the Open button, or the Search button in
Step 2, skip this step; DesignCenter already displays the drawing you
selected on the Folders tab.
5. If DesignCenter doesn’t display the symbol tables indented under-
neath the source drawing (the one you opened in Step 2), as shown in
Figure 4-9, click the plus sign next to the drawing’s name to display
them.
87
Chapter 4: Get Ready to Draw

6. Click the Layers table to display the source drawing’s layers in the
content pane.
7. Choose one or more layers in the content pane.
8. Right-click in the content pane and choose Copy from the cursor menu
to copy the layer(s) to the Windows Clipboard.
9. Click in the AutoCAD destination drawing’s window (the drawing that
you opened in Step 3).
10. Right-click and choose Paste from the cursor menu.
AutoCAD copies the layers into the current drawing, using the colors,
linetypes, and other settings from the source drawing.
Two other ways exist to copy layers from DesignCenter. You can drag layers
from the content pane to a drawing window. You also can right-click in the
content pane and choose Add Layer(s) from the cursor menu, which adds
layers to the current drawing. The copy-and-paste method in my example
requires the least amount of manual dexterity and less guesswork about
which drawing the layers get added to.
If the current drawing contains a layer whose name matches the name of one
of the layers you’re copying, AutoCAD doesn’t change that layer’s definition.
For example, if you drag a layer named Doors whose color is red into a draw-
ing that already includes a layer called Doors whose color is green, the target
drawing’s Doors layer remains green. Named objects from DesignCenter
never overwrite objects with the same name in the destination drawing.
AutoCAD always displays the message “Duplicate definitions will be ignored”
even if there aren’t any duplicates.
If you’re repeatedly copying named objects from the same drawings or fold-
ers, add them to your DesignCenter favorites list. On the Folders tab, right-
click the drawing or folder and choose Add to Favorites from the cursor
menu. This procedure adds another shortcut to your list of favorites. 
 To see your favorites, click the DesignCenter toolbar’s Favorites button.
 To return to a favorite, double-click its shortcut in the content pane.
Precise-liness Is Next to CAD-liness
Drawing precision is vital to good CAD drafting practice, even more than for
manual drafting. If you think CAD managers get testy when you assign proper-
ties by object instead of by layer, wait until they berate someone who doesn’t
use precision techniques when creating drawings in AutoCAD.
88
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

In CAD, lack of precision makes later editing, hatching, and dimensioning
tasks much more difficult and time consuming: 
 Small errors in precision in the early stages of creating or editing a draw-
ing often have a big effect on productivity and precision later. 
 Drawings may guide manufacturing and construction projects; drawing
data may drive automatic manufacturing machinery. Huge amounts of
money, even lives, can ride on a drawing’s precision. 
In recognition of this, a passion for precision permeates the profession.
Permanently. Precision is one of the characteristics that separates CAD from
ordinary illustration-type drawing work. The sooner you get fussy about pre-
cision in AutoCAD, the happier everyone is.
In the context of drawing objects, precision means specifying points and dis-
tances precisely, and AutoCAD provides a range of tools for doing so. Table
4-2 lists the more important AutoCAD precision techniques, plus the status
bar buttons that you click to toggle some of the features off and on.
Precision is especially important when you’re drawing or editing geometry —
the lines, arcs, and so on that make up whatever you’re representing in the
CAD drawing. Precision placement usually is less important with notes, lead-
ers, and other annotations that describe, not show. 
89
Chapter 4: Get Ready to Draw
CAD precision versus accuracy
We often use the words precision and accuracy
interchangeably, but I think it’s useful to maintain
a distinction. When I use the word precision, I
mean controlling the placement of objects so
they lie exactly where you want them to lie in the
drawing. For example, lines whose endpoints
meet must meet exactly, and a circle that’s sup-
posed to be centered on the coordinates 0,0
must be drawn with its center exactly at 0,0. I 
use accuracy to refer to the degree to which
your drawing matches its real-world counter-
part. An accurate floor plan is one in which the
dimensions of the CAD objects equal the dimen-
sions of the as-built house.
CAD precision usually helps produce accurate
drawings, but that’s not always the case. You
can produce a precise CAD drawing that’s inac-
curate because you started from inaccurate
information (for example, the contractor gave
you a wrong field measurement). Or you might
deliberately exaggerate certain distances to
convey the relationship between objects more
clearly on the plotted drawing. Even where you
must sacrifice accuracy, aim for precision.

Keyboard capers: Coordinate entry
The most direct way to enter points precisely is to type numbers at the com-
mand line. AutoCAD uses these keyboard coordinate entry formats:
90
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

 Absolute rectangular coordinates in the form X,Y (for example: 7,4)
 Relative rectangular coordinates in the form @X,Y (for example: @3,2)
 Relative polar coordinates in the form @distance<angle (for example:
@6<45)
AutoCAD locates absolute rectangular coordinates with respect to the 0,0 
point of the drawing — usually its lower-left corner. AutoCAD locates relative
rectangular coordinates and relative polar coordinates with respect to the previ-
ous point that you picked or typed. Figure 4-10 demonstrates how to use all
three coordinate formats to draw a pair of line segments that start at absolute
coordinates 2,1; go 3 units to the right and 2 units up; then go 4 units at an
angle of 60 degrees.
AutoCAD also understands absolute polar coordinates in the form
distance<angle, but this format is almost never useful.

Chapter 4: Get Ready to Draw

You can view coordinate locations by moving the cursor around in the draw-
ing area and reading the Coordinates area at the left of the status bar. The X,Y
coordinates should change as you move the cursor. If the coordinates don’t
change, click the Coordinates area until the command line says <Coords on>.
Although it’s not apparent at first, there are in fact two <Coords on> display
modes: absolute coordinates and polar coordinates. If you start a command
such as LINE, pick a point, and then click the Coordinates area a few times,
the display changes from coordinates off to live absolute coordinates (X,Y
position) to live polar coordinates (distance and angle from the previous point).
The live polar coordinates display mode is the most informative most of the
time.
When you type coordinates at the command line, do not add any spaces,
because AutoCAD interprets them as though you’ve pressed Enter. This
“Spacebar = Enter” weirdness is a productivity feature that’s been in AutoCAD
forever. It’s easier to find the spacebar than the Enter key when you’re entering
lots of commands and coordinates in a hurry.
If you’re working in architectural or engineering units, the default unit of
entry is inches, not feet.
 To specify feet, you must enter the symbol for feet after the number, for
example:
6’ for 6 feet
 You can enter a dash to separate feet from inches, as architects often do:
6’–6” is 6 feet, 6 inches.
 Both the dash and the inch mark are optional when you’re entering coor-
dinates and distances: 
AutoCAD understands 6’6” and 6’6 as the same as 6’–6”.
 If you’re typing a coordinate or distance that contains fractional inches,
you must enter a dash — not a space — between the whole number of
inches and the fraction:
6’6–1/2 (or 6’–6–1/2) represents 6 feet, 61⁄2 inches.
 If all this dashing about confuses you, enter partial inches by using deci-
mals instead:
6’6.5 is the same as 6’6–1/2 to AutoCAD, whether you’re working
in architectural or engineering units.
Grab an object and make it snappy
After you’ve drawn a few objects precisely in a new drawing, the most effi-
cient way to draw more objects with equal precision is to grab points, such as
92
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

endpoints, midpoints, or quadrants, on the existing objects. AutoCAD calls
this object snapping, because the program pulls, or snaps, the cursor to a
point on an existing object. The object snapping feature in general and object
snap points in particular often are called osnaps.
I’d like to make just one point
AutoCAD provides two kinds of object snapping modes: 
 Single point (or override) object snaps 
A single point object snap lasts just while you pick one point. 
 Running object snaps
A running object snap stays in effect until you turn it off.
Here’s how you draw precise lines by using single point object snaps:
1. Open a drawing containing some geometry.
2. Turn off running osnap mode by clicking the OSNAP button on the
status bar until the button appears to be pushed out and the words
<Osnap off> appear on the command line.
Although you can use single point object snaps while running object
snap mode is turned on, you should turn off running osnap mode while
you’re getting familiar with single point object snaps. After you’ve gotten
the hang of each feature separately, you can use them together.
3. Start the LINE command by clicking the Line button on the Draw 
toolbar.
The command line prompts you to select the first endpoint of the line:
Specify first point:
4. Hold down the Shift key, right-click anywhere in the drawing area,
and release the Shift key.
If you find the Shift+right-click sequence awkward, you can avoid it by
using the Object Snap toolbar instead. To turn the toolbar on, point to
any toolbar button, right-click, and choose Object Snap. Now you can
activate a single point object snap by clicking its toolbar button.
The object snap cursor menu appears, as shown in Figure 4-11.
5. Choose an object snap mode, such as Endpoint, from the object snap
cursor menu.
The object snap cursor menu disappears, and the command line dis-
plays an additional prompt indicating that you’ve directed AutoCAD to
seek out, for example, endpoints of existing objects:
_endp of:
93
Chapter 4: Get Ready to Draw

6. Move the cursor slowly around the drawing, pausing over various
lines and other objects without clicking yet.
When you move the cursor near an object with an endpoint, a colored
square icon appears at the endpoint, indicating that AutoCAD can snap
to that point. If you stop moving the cursor for a moment, a yellow
ToolTip displaying the object snap mode (for example, Endpoint)
appears to reinforce the idea.
7. When the endpoint object snap square appears on the point you want
to snap to, click.
AutoCAD snaps to the endpoint, which becomes the first point of the
new line segment that you’re about to draw. The command line prompts
you to select the other endpoint of the new line segment:
Specify next point or [Undo]:
When you move the cursor around the drawing, AutoCAD no longer
seeks out endpoints because single point object snaps last only for a
single pick. Use the object snap cursor menu again to snap the other end
of your new line segment to another point on an existing object.
8. Use the “press Shift, right-click, release Shift” sequence described in
Step 4 to display the object snap cursor menu, and then choose
another object snap mode, such as Midpoint, from the object snap
cursor menu.
The command line displays an additional prompt indicating that you’ve
directed AutoCAD to seek, for example, midpoints of existing objects:
_mid of:
Figure 4-11:
The object
snap cursor
menu.
94
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

When you move the cursor near the midpoint of an object, a colored trian-
gle appears at the snap point. Each object snap type (endpoint, midpoint,
intersection, and so on) displays a different symbol. If you stop moving
the cursor, the ToolTip text reminds you what the symbol means. Figure
4-12 shows what the screen looks like during this step.
9. Draw additional line segments by picking additional points. Use the
object snap cursor menu to specify a single object snap type before
you pick each point.
Try the Intersection, Perpendicular, and Nearest object snaps. If your
drawing contains arcs or circles, try Center and Quadrant.
10. When you’re finished experimenting with single point object snaps,
right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Enter from the
cursor menu.

Chapter 4: Get Ready to Draw

There’s a difference between right-clicking and Shift+right-clicking in the
drawing area:
• Right-clicking displays menu options for the current command (or
common commands and settings when no command is active).
• Shift+right-clicking always displays the same object snap cursor
menu.
AutoCAD 2005 includes a new Mid Between 2 Points (M2P) object snap mode,
which finds the point lying exactly halfway between two other points. You
should use precision techniques, such as other object snaps, to select the
two points.
Run with object snaps
Often, you use an object snap mode (such as endpoint) repeatedly. Running
object snaps address this need. These steps set a running object snap:
1. Right-click the OSNAP button on the status bar.
2. Choose the Settings option.
The Object Snap tab on the Drafting Settings dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 4-13.
3. Select one or more object snap modes by checking the appropriate
boxes.
4. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Figure 4-13:
Grabbing
multiple

features is

96
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

You click the OSNAP button on the status bar to toggle running object snap
mode off and on. After you turn on running object snap, AutoCAD hunts for
points that correspond to the object snap modes you checked in the Drafting
Settings dialog box. As with single-point object snaps, AutoCAD displays a
special symbol — such as a square for an endpoint object snap — to indicate
that it has found an object snap point. If you keep the cursor still, AutoCAD
also displays a ToolTip that lists the kind of object snap point.
Use single point or running object snaps to enforce precision by making sure
that new points you pick coincide exactly with points on existing objects. In
CAD, it’s not good enough for points to almost coincide or to look like they
coincide. AutoCAD knows the difference between “looks the same” and “is
the same,” and will cause you untold amounts of grief if you try to make do
with “looks the same.” You lose points, both figuratively and literally, if you
don’t use object snaps or one of the other precision techniques covered in
this chapter to enforce precision.
Other precision practices
The following are some other AutoCAD precision techniques (refer to Table 4-2,
earlier in this chapter):
 Snap: If you turn on snap mode, AutoCAD constrains the cursor to an
imaginary rectangular grid of points at the spacing that you’ve specified.
Follow these steps to turn on snap mode:
1. Right-click the SNAP button on the status bar.
2. Choose the Settings option.
The Snap and Grid tab on the Drafting Settings dialog box appears.
3. Enter a snap spacing in the Snap X Spacing field and then click OK.
Click the SNAP button on the status bar or Press F9 to toggle snap mode
off and on. To use snap effectively, change the snap spacing frequently —
changing to a smaller spacing as you zoom in and work on smaller areas.
You often need to toggle snap off and on, because selecting objects and
some editing tasks are easier with snap off.
 Ortho: Ortho mode constrains the cursor to move at right angles (orthog-
onally) to the previous point. Click the ORTHO button on the status bar or
Press F8 to toggle ortho mode off and on. Because technical drawings
often include lots of orthogonal lines, you’ll use ortho mode a lot.
97
Chapter 4: Get Ready to Draw

 Direct distance entry: This “point and type” technique is an easy and
efficient way to draw with precision. You simply point the cursor in a par-
ticular direction, type a distance at the command line, and press Enter.
AutoCAD calls it “direct distance entry” because it avoids the indirect
command line method of specifying a distance by typing relative or polar
coordinates. (I describe this older method earlier in this chapter.) You
can use direct distance entry any time the crosshair cursor is anchored
to a point and the command line prompts you for another point or a dis-
tance. You’ll usually use direct distance entry with ortho mode turned
on, to specify a distance in an orthogonal direction (0, 90, 180, or 270
degrees). You also can combine direct distance entry with polar tracking
to specify distances in non-orthogonal directions (for example, in angle
increments of 45 degrees).
 Object snap tracking: This feature extends running object snaps so that
you can locate points based on more than one object snap point. For
example, you can pick a point at the center of a square by tracking to
the midpoints of two perpendicular sides. (AutoCAD LT lacks the object
snap tracking feature.)
 Polar tracking: When you turn on polar tracking, the cursor jumps to
increments of the angle you selected. When the cursor jumps, a ToolTip
label starting with Polar: appears. Right-click the POLAR button on the
status bar and choose the Settings option to display the Polar Tracking
tab on the Drafting Settings dialog box. Select an angle from the Increment
Angle drop-down list and then click OK. Click the POLAR button on the
status bar or press F10 to toggle polar tracking mode off and on.
 Polar snap: You can force polar tracking to jump to specific incremental
distances along the tracking angles by changing the snap type from Grid
snap to Polar snap. For example, if you turn on polar tracking and set it
to 45 degrees and turn on polar snap and set it to 2 units, polar tracking
jumps to points that are at angle increments of 45 degrees and distance
increments of 2 units from the previous point. Polar snap has a similar
effect on object snap tracking.
To activate polar snap, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the SNAP button on the status bar.
2. Choose the Settings option.
The Snap and Grid tab on the Drafting Settings dialog box appears.
3. Click the Polar Snap radio button, type a distance in the Polar
Distance edit box, and then click OK.
When you want to return to ordinary rectangular snap, as described at
the beginning of this list, select the Grid Snap radio button in the
Drafting Settings dialog box.

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

If you’re new to AutoCAD, its wide range of precision tools probably seems
overwhelming at this point. Rest assured that there’s more than one way to
skin a cat precisely, and not everyone needs to understand all the ways. You
can make perfectly precise drawings with a subset of AutoCAD’s precision
tools. I recommend these steps: 
1. Get comfortable with typing coordinates, ortho mode, direct distance
entry, and single point object snaps. 
2. Become familiar with running object snaps and try snap. 
3. After you have all these precision features under your belt, feel free to
experiment with polar tracking, polar snap, and object snap tracking.
It’s easy to confuse the names of the snap and object snap (osnap) features.
Remember that snap limits the cursor to locations whose coordinates are
multiples of the current snap spacing. Object snap (osnap) enables you to
grab points on existing objects, whether those points happen to correspond
with the snap spacing or not.

A
s you probably remember from your crayon and coloring book days,
drawing stuff is fun. CAD imposes a little more discipline, but drawing
AutoCAD objects is still fun. In computer-aided drafting, you usually start by
drawing geometry — shapes such as lines, circles, rectangles, and so on that
represent the real-world object that you’re documenting. This chapter shows
you how to draw geometry.
After you’ve created some geometry, you’ll probably need to add some
dimensions, text, and hatching, but those elements come later (in Part III of
this book). Your first task is to get the geometry right; then you can worry
about labeling things.
Drawing geometry properly in AutoCAD depends on paying attention to object
properties and the precision of the points that you specify to create the
objects. I cover these matters in Chapter 4, so if you eagerly jumped to this
chapter to get right to the fun stuff, take a moment to review that chapter first.

Introducing the AutoCAD 
Drawing Commands
For descriptive purposes, this chapter divides the drawing commands into
three groups:
 Straight lines and objects composed of straight lines
 Curves
 Points
AutoCAD-based application-specific programs such as Architectural Desktop
add extra drawing tools to the mix — for example, commands for drawing
walls and doors. See the documentation that comes with the application-
specific program for information on such tools.
Table 5-1 offers an overview of most of the drawing commands in AutoCAD,
without the 3D-related commands. It describes the commands’ major options
and shows you how to access them from the command line, the Draw menu,
and the Draw toolbar. (Don’t worry if not all the terms in the table are famil-
iar to you; they become clear as you read through the chapter and use the
commands.)

Many of the choices on the AutoCAD Draw menu open submenus containing
several variations on each drawing command.
The AutoCAD drawing commands depend heavily on your reading the com-
mand line area and sometimes typing things there. Don’t worry; I remind you
to do so. (If “command line area” sounds to you like a place to order cafeteria
food, not an AutoCAD essential concept, see Chapter 2.) Many of the com-
mand options that you see in command line prompts are available as well by
right-clicking in the drawing area.
So what’s the best course: to enter drawing commands from the command line
or to choose them from the menus or toolbars? I suggest that you start a draw-
ing command the first few times — until you remember its command name —
by clicking its button on the Draw toolbar. After you click the button, fasten
your eyes on the command line area so that you see the name of the command
and its command line options. Use the keyboard or the right-click menus to
103
Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line

select options, depending on whether your hand is on the keyboard or the
mouse at that moment. After you’re acquainted with a drawing command and
decide that you like it enough to use it often, find out how to type its keyboard
shortcut (the uppercase letters in the command names in Table 5-1).
A few drawing commands, such as DOnut, aren’t on the Draw toolbar; you
have to type those or choose them on the Draw menu.
The Straight and Narrow: Lines,
Polylines, and Polygons
As I harp on a bunch of times elsewhere in this book, CAD programs are for
precision drawing, so you’ll spend a lot of your AutoCAD time drawing objects
composed of straight-line segments. This section covers these commands:
 Line: Draws a series of straight line segments; each segment is a sepa-
rate object
 PLine: Draws a polyline — a series of straight and/or curved line seg-
ments; all the segments remain connected to each other as a single object
 RECtang: Draws a polyline in the shape of a rectangle
 POLygon: Draws a polyline in the shape of a regular polygon (that is, a
closed shape with all sides equal and all angles equal)
The following additional straight-line drawing commands also are available in
AutoCAD:
 RAY: Draws a semi-infinite line (a line that extends infinitely in one 
direction)
 XLine: Draws an infinite line (a line that extends infinitely in both 
directions)
The RAY and XLine commands are used to draw construction lines that guide
the construction of additional geometry. Drawing construction lines is less
common in AutoCAD than in some other CAD programs. AutoCAD’s many
precision techniques often provide more efficient methods than construction
lines of creating new geometry.
Toe the line
The Line command in AutoCAD draws a series of one or more connected line
segments. Well, it appears to draw a series of connected segments. In fact,
104
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

105
Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line
each segment, or piece of a line with endpoints, is a separate object. This con-
struction doesn’t seem like a big deal until you try to move or otherwise edit
a series of segments that you drew with the Line command; you must select
every piece separately. To avoid such a hassle, use polylines, described later
in this chapter, not lines and arcs when you want the connected segments to
be a single object.
If you’re used to drawing lines in other programs, you may find it confusing
at first that AutoCAD’s Line command doesn’t stop after you draw a single
segment. AutoCAD keeps prompting you to specify additional points so that
you can draw a series of (apparently) connected segments. When you’re fin-
ished drawing segments, just press the Enter key to finish the Line command
and return to the Command prompt.
Unlike a lot of AutoCAD drawing commands, Line doesn’t offer a bunch of
potentially confusing options. There’s a Close option to create a closed
polygon and an Undo option to remove the most recent segment that you
drew.
Like all drawing commands, Line puts the line segment objects that it draws
on the current layer, and uses the current color, linetype, lineweight, and plot
style properties.
 Make sure that you’ve set these properties correctly before you start
drawing. (I recommend that you set color, linetype. lineweight, and plot
style to ByLayer.) See Chapter 4 for information on setting the current
properties with the Object Properties toolbar.
 When you’re doing real drafting as opposed to just experimenting, make
sure that you use one of AutoCAD’s precision tools, such as object
snaps, typed coordinates, or tracking to ensure that you specify each
object point precisely. Chapter 4 describes these tools.
Follow these steps to draw a series of line segments by using the Line 
command:
1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the line segments that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Line button on the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the Line command and prompts you at the command
line:
Specify first point:
3. Specify the starting point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
Remember to use one of the precision techniques described in Chapter 4
if you’re doing real drafting. For the first point, object snap, snap, track-
ing, and typing coordinates all work well.

AutoCAD prompts you at the command line to specify the other end-
point of the first line segment:
Specify next point or [Undo]:
4. Specify additional points by clicking or typing.
Again, use one of the AutoCAD precision techniques if you’re doing real
drafting. For the second and subsequent points, all the techniques men-
tioned in the previous step work well, plus ortho and direct distance entry.
After you specify the third point, AutoCAD adds the Close option to the
command line prompt:
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]:
5. When you’re finished drawing segments, end with one of these steps:
• Press Enter, or right-click anywhere in the drawing area and
choose Enter (as shown in Figure 5-1), to leave the figure open.
• Type C and press Enter, or right-click anywhere in the drawing area
and choose Close from the cursor menu, to close the figure.
AutoCAD draws the final segment and returns to the Command prompt,
indicating that the Line command is finished:

Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line
Connect the lines with polyline
The Line command is fine for some drawing tasks, but the PLine command is
a better, more flexible choice in many situations. The PLine command draws
a special kind of object called a polyline. You may hear CAD drafters refer to a
polyline as a pline because of the command name. (By the way, PLine is pro-
nounced to rhyme with “beeline” — in other words, it sounds like the place
you stand when you’ve drunk a lot of beer at the ball game.)
The most important differences between the Line and PLine commands are
these:
 The Line command draws a series of single line segment objects. Even
though they appear on the screen to be linked, each segment is a sepa-
rate object. If you move one line segment, the other segments that you
drew at the same time don’t move with it. The PLine command, on the
other hand, draws a single, connected, multisegment object. If you
select any segment for editing, your changes affect the entire polyline.
Figure 5-2 shows how the same sketch drawn with the Line and the
PLine commands responds when you select one of the objects.
Use the PLine command instead of Line in most cases where you need to
draw a series of connected line segments. If you’re drawing a series of end-
to-end segments, there’s a good chance that those segments are logically
connected — for example, they might represent the outline of a single
object or a continuous pathway. If the segments are connected logically, it
makes sense to keep them connected in AutoCAD. The most obvious prac-
tical benefit of grouping segments together into a polyline is that many
editing operations are more efficient when you use polylines. If you move a
single, disconnected line segment, the other segments that you drew at
the same time don’t move with it — likewise for other common editing
operations, such as copying, erasing, rotating, and mirroring. When you
select any segment in a polyline for editing, the entire polyline is affected.
 The PLine command can draw curved segments as well as straight ones.
 You can add width to each segment of a polyline. Polyline segment width
is similar to lineweight, except that it can be uniform or tapered. The
ability to create polyline segments with line widths was more important
in the old days before AutoCAD had lineweight as an object property.
People used to draw polylines with a small amount of width to show the
segments as somewhat heavier than normal on plots. Nowadays, it’s
easier and more efficient to achieve this effect with object lineweights
(as described in Chapter 4) or plot styles (as described in Chapter 12).
After you create a polyline, you can adjust its segments by grip editing any of
the vertex points. (The little squares on the vertices in Figure 5-2 are called
grips; see Chapter 6 for details on grip editing.) For more complicated poly-
line editing tasks, you can use the PEdit command to edit the polyline, or you
can convert the polyline to a collection of line and arc segments by using the

eXplode command — although you lose any width defined for each segment
when you explode a polyline.
Drawing polylines composed of straight segments is pretty much like drawing
with the Line command, as demonstrated in the following procedure. Watch
the command prompts carefully because the PLine command has a lot of
options! Remember that you can right-click in the drawing area to select one
of the options, but reading the command prompts is your ticket to knowing
what the options are at any moment.
To draw a polyline composed of straight segments, follow these steps:
1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the polyline object that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Polyline button — the one that looks like a fishhook — on
the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the PLine command and prompts you at the command
line:
Specify start point:
3. Specify the starting point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
AutoCAD displays the current polyline segment line-width and prompts
you to specify the other endpoint of the first polyline segment:
Current line-width is 0.0000
Specify next point or [Arc/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/Width]:
Polyline (all segments form one object)
Line (each segment is a separate object)

Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line
4. If the current line-width isn’t zero, change it to zero by typing W,
Enter, 0, Enter, 0 (as shown in the following command line sequence).
Specify next point or [Arc/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/Width]:
W
Enter Specify starting width <0.0000>: 0
Enter Specify ending width <0.0000>: 0
Enter Specify next point or
[Arc/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/Width]:
Despite what you may think, a zero width polyline segment is not the
AutoCAD equivalent of writing with disappearing ink. “Zero width”
means “display this segment, using the normal, thin line-width on the
screen.” AutoCAD still applies object property or plot style lineweights
when you plot.
5. Specify additional points by clicking or typing.
After you specify the second point, AutoCAD adds the Close option to
the command line prompt:
Specify next point or
[Arc/Close/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/Width]:
In addition, you can view and choose options from the right-click menu,
as shown in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3:
Getting in
the PLine.

6. After you finish drawing segments, either press Enter (to leave the
figure open) or type C and press Enter (to close it).
AutoCAD draws the final segment and returns to the Command prompt,
indicating that the PLine command is finished:
Command:
In the following procedure, I spice things up a bit and give you a preview of
coming (curvy) attractions by adding an arc segment to a polyline.
Just so you know, curved segments in polylines are circular arcs — pieces of
circles that you can draw with the AutoCAD Arc command. AutoCAD can
draw other kinds of curves, including ellipses and splines, but not within the
PLine command.
To draw a polyline that includes curved segments, follow these steps:
1. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 of the previous procedure.
2. When you’re ready to add one or more arc segments, type A and
press Enter to select the Arc option.
The command line prompt changes to show arc segment options. Most
of these options correspond to the many ways of drawing circular arcs
in AutoCAD; see “Arc-y-ology,” later in this chapter.
Specify endpoint of arc or
[Angle/CEnter/CLose/Direction/Halfwidth/Line/
Radius/Second pt/Undo/Width]:
3. Specify the endpoint of the arc by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
AutoCAD draws the curved segment of the polyline. The command line
prompt continues to show arc segment options.
Specify endpoint of arc or
[Angle/CEnter/CLose/Direction/Halfwidth/Line/
Radius/Second pt/Undo/Width]:
Your options at this point include
• Specifying additional points to draw more arc segments
• Choosing another arc-drawing method (such as CEnter or 
Second pt)
• Returning to drawing straight-line segments with the Line option
In this example, I return to drawing straight-line segments.
110
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Perhaps the most useful of the alternative arc-drawing methods is
Second pt. You can use it to gain flexibility in the direction of the arc,
but at the cost of losing tangency of contiguous segments. Sometimes
it’s best not to go off on a tangent, anyway.
4. Type L and press Enter to select the Line option.
Specify endpoint of arc or
[Angle/CEnter/CLose/Direction/Halfwidth/Line/
Radius/Second pt/Undo/Width]: L
The command line prompt changes back to showing straight-line seg-
ment options.
Specify next point or
[Arc/Close/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/Width]:
5. Specify additional points by clicking or typing.
6. After you’re finished drawing segments, either press Enter or type C
and press Enter.
Command:
Figure 5-4 shows some of the things that you can draw with the PLine com-
mand by using straight segments, arc segments, or a combination of both.
The Line and PLine commands work well for drawing a series of end-to-end
single lines, but what if you want to draw a series of double lines to repre-
sent, for example, the edges of a wall or roadway? Here are three options:
Figure 5-4:
A plethora

Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line

 Use the AutoCAD MLine command to draw multilines — series of two or
more parallel, straight lines. The AutoCAD multiline feature was full of
limitations and bugs when it debuted ten years ago. It hasn’t improved
significantly since then. Look up the MLine and MLSTYLE commands in
AutoCAD’s online help system if you’d like to tangle with this feature,
but be prepared to spend time experimenting and struggling.
 In AutoCAD LT only, use the DLine (Double Line) command to draw pairs
of parallel line and/or arc segments. AutoCAD LT doesn’t include the
MLine command, which, given MLine’s problems, probably is more of a
blessing than a limitation. AutoCAD, on the other hand, doesn’t include
the DLine command. (Score one for the little brother!)
 Use the PLine command to draw a single set of connected line and/or
arc segments, and then use the Offset command to create one or more
sets of parallel segments. Chapter 6 covers the Offset command.
Square off with rectangle
You can use the PLine or Line command to draw a rectangle segment by seg-
ment. In most cases, though, you’ll find it easier to use the special-purpose
RECtang command. The following procedure demonstrates how:
1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the rectangle that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Rectangle button on the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the RECtang command and prompts you at the com-
mand line to specify a point for one corner of the rectangle:
Specify first corner point or
[Chamfer/Elevation/Fillet/Thickness/Width]:
You can add fancy effects with the additional command options. The
default options work best for most purposes. Look up “RECTANG com-
mand” in the AutoCAD help system if you want to know more about the
options.
3. Specify the first corner by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
The command line prompts you to specify the other corner of the
rectangle — the one that’s diagonally opposite from the first corner:
Specify other corner point or [Dimensions]:
4. Specify the other corner by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
112
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

If you know the size of the rectangle that you want to draw (for example,
100 units long by 75 units high), type relative coordinates to specify the
dimensions (for example, @100,75). (Chapter 4 describes how to type
coordinates.)
AutoCAD draws the rectangle.
Choose your sides with polygon
Rectangles and other closed polylines are types of polygons, or closed figures
with three or more sides. The AutoCAD POLygon command provides a quick
way of drawing regular polygons — polygons in which all sides and angles are
equal. (If regular polygons seem a little square, maybe that’s because a
square is a special case of a regular polygon!)
The following procedure demonstrates the POLygon command:
1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the polygon that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Polygon button on the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the POLygon command and prompts you at the com-
mand line to enter the number of sides for the polygon:
Enter number of sides <4>:
3. Type the number of sides in the polygon that you want to draw and
press Enter.
The command line prompts you to specify the center point of the
polygon:
Specify center of polygon or [Edge]:
You can use the Edge option to draw a polygon by specifying one side,
instead of the center and radius of an imaginary inscribed or circum-
scribed circle. The imaginary circle method is much more common.
4. Specify the center point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
The command line prompts you to specify whether the polygon will be
inscribed in or circumscribed about an imaginary circle whose radius
you will specify in the following step:
Enter an option [Inscribed in circle/Circumscribed about
circle] <I>:
113
Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line

5. Type I or C and press Enter.
The command line prompts you to specify the radius of imaginary circle:
Specify radius of circle:
6. Specify the radius by typing a distance or clicking a point.
AutoCAD draws the polygon.
If you type a distance or you click a point with Ortho turned on, the
polygon will be aligned orthogonally, as shown in Figure 5-5. If you click
a point with Ortho turned off, the polygon most likely won’t be aligned
orthogonally.
Figure 5-5 shows the results of drawing plenty of polygons — a practice known
as “polygony,” and which, as far as I know, remains legal in most states.
Rectangles and polygons in AutoCAD are really just polylines that you specify
in a way that’s appropriate to the shape you’re creating. You’ll notice this
when you grip edit a rectangle or polygon and move one of the vertexes: Only
the selected vertex moves. AutoCAD doesn’t make the entire rectangle or
polygon larger or smaller. (See Chapter 6 for information about grip editing.)

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

(Throwing) Curves
Although straight line segments predominate in many CAD drawings, even
the most humdrum, rectilinear design is likely to have a few curves. And if
you’re drawing car bodies or Gaudí buildings, your drawings will be almost
nothing but curves! This section shows you how to use the following
AutoCAD curve-drawing commands:
 Circle: Draws circles (you were expecting rectangles, maybe?)
 Arc: Draws circular arcs — arcs cut from circles, not from ellipses,
parabolas, or some other complicated curve
 ELlipse: Draws ellipses and elliptical arcs
 SPLine: Draws smoothly flowing curves of a variety of shapes
 DOnut: Draws filled-in annular rings and circles
 REVCLOUD: Draws free-form “clouds,” the most common application of
which is to indicate revised areas in the drawing
The following sections describe each command.
Going full circle
AutoCAD offers an easy way to draw circles, and it also offers . . . other ways.
The easy way is to define the center point of the circle and then to define the
radius or diameter. You can also define a circle by entering one of the follow-
ing options of the command (for those “other” ways):
 3P (3-Point): Specify any three points on the circumference.
 2P (2-Point): Specify the endpoints of a diameter of the circle.
 Ttr (Tangent-Tangent-Radius): Specify two lines or other objects that
are tangent to the circle, and then specify its radius.
Whether these additional circle-drawing methods are useful or superfluous
depends on the kinds of drawings that you make and how geometry is
defined in your industry. Get familiar with the default center point/radius
method and then try the other methods to see whether they may be helpful
to you. If you find yourself going around in circles, you can always draw them
the default way and move them into position with other geometry.
115
Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line

1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the circle that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Circle button on the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the Circle command and prompts you at the command
line to specify the center point of the circle:
Specify center point for circle or [3P/2P/Ttr (tan tan
radius)]:
The prompt shows the methods other than “center point plus radius”
that you can use to draw circles in AutoCAD. (No, “tan tan radius” is not
a mathematician’s dance.) Look up “CIRCLE command” in the online
help if you think you may have a use for these less common circle-
drawing methods.
3. Specify the center point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
Use one of the precision techniques described in Chapter 4 if you’re
doing real drafting. Object snap, snap, and typing coordinates all work
well for specifying the center point.
The command line then prompts you to specify the circle’s radius:
Specify radius of circle or [Diameter]:
Type D and press Enter if you prefer to enter the diameter rather than
the radius and you’ve forgotten your twos tables — or, more seriously,
if the diameter is easier to specify with the cursor or type exactly
than the radius is.
4. Specify the radius by typing a distance or clicking a point.
AutoCAD draws the circle, as shown in Figure 5-6.
Arc-y-ology
Arcs in AutoCAD are, quite simply, pieces of circles. As with circles, AutoCAD
offers you an easy way to define arcs. Just specify three points on-screen to
define the arc, easy as one-two-three. These points tell AutoCAD where to
start the arc, how much to curve it, and where to end it.
Sounds pretty easy, right? So where’s the problem? The trouble is that you
often must specify arcs more exactly than is possible by using this method.
AutoCAD helps you specify such arcs, too, but the procedure ain’t easy.
116
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

You can start your arc by specifying the center of the arc or the start point. If
you choose the Center option, AutoCAD prompts you for the center point
first and the start point second. AutoCAD defines arcs counterclockwise, so
pick a start point in a clockwise direction from the end point. After you spec-
ify the center and start point, AutoCAD presents several options you can
choose, including the following:
 Angle: This option specifies the included angle that the arc sweeps out.
A 180-degree angle, for example, is a semicircle.
 Length of chord: This option specifies the length of an imaginary
straight line connecting the endpoints of the arc. Most people use this
option seldom or never.
 Endpoint: This option specifies where the arc ends. It’s the default
option and is often the easiest to use.
Figure 5-6:
Pi R
square(d);
circles are
round.
117
Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line

If you specify the start point as the first option, you can choose among the
following three command line options as well:
 Center: This option prompts you for the arc’s center point and then fin-
ishes with the three options listed above.
 End: This option specifies the endpoint of the arc. You then need to
define the angle the arc covers, its direction, its radius, or its center
point.
 Second point: This is the default option. The second point you choose is
not the endpoint; instead, it’s a point on the arc that, along with the start
and endpoints, defines the arc’s curvature — that is, how much it curves.
After you enter the second point, you must enter an endpoint to com-
plete the arc.
To get a feel for how these permutations can be strung together to create dif-
ferent arc-drawing methods, choose Draw➪Arc and look at the impressive
submenu that unfurls, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Figure 5-7:
A deluge of
Arc options,

118
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

The following example shows how you draw an arc with the default start
point/second point/endpoint method:
1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the arc that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Arc button on the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the Arc command and prompts you at the command line
to specify the first endpoint of the arc:
Specify start point of arc or [Center]:
3. Specify the start point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
The command line prompts you to specify a second point on the arc:
Specify second point of arc or [Center/ENd]:
4. Specify a second point on the arc by clicking a point or typing
coordinates.
The second point lies somewhere along the curve of the arc. AutoCAD
determines the exact curvature of the arc after you choose the final end-
point in the following step. To align the second point with an existing
object, use an object snap mode.
The command line prompts you to specify the other endpoint of the arc;
as you move the cursor around, AutoCAD shows how the arc will look:
Specify end point of arc:
5. Specify the other endpoint of the arc by clicking a point or typing
coordinates.
AutoCAD draws the arc, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Ellipses (S. Grant?)
An ellipse is like a warped circle with a major (long) axis and a minor (short)
axis. These axes determine the ellipse’s length, width, and degree of curva-
ture. An elliptical arc is an arc cut from an ellipse. Some kinds of drawing
geometry require ellipses or elliptical arcs, but many people use AutoCAD
happily for years without ever drawing an ellipse. If you think you’re one of
those people, skip this section.
The AutoCAD ELlipse command provides a straightforward way of drawing
an ellipse: You specify the two endpoints of one of its axes and then specify
an endpoint on the other axis. But like the Arc command, the ELlipse com-
mand offers a bunch of other options on the command line:
119
Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line

 Arc: This option generates an elliptical arc, not a full ellipse. You define
an elliptical arc just as you do a full ellipse. The following methods for
creating an ellipse apply to either.
 Center: This option requires that you define the center of the ellipse and
then the endpoint of an axis. You can then either enter the distance of
the other axis or specify that a rotation around the major axis define the
ellipse. If you choose the latter, you can enter (or drag the ellipse to) a
specific rotation for the second axis that, in turn, completely defines the
ellipse.
 Rotation: With this option, you specify an angle, which defines the cur-
vature of the ellipse — small angles make fat ellipses (0 degrees creates
a circle, in fact), and large angles make skinny ellipses. The name of the
option, Rotation, has something to do with rotating an imaginary circle
around the first axis. If you can figure out the imaginary circle business,
then you have a better imagination than I do.
The following example creates an ellipse by using the default endpoints of
the axes method. Figure 5-8 shows an ellipse and an elliptical arc.
Figure 5-8:
An ellipse
and

arc.
120
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Command: ELlipse Enter
Specify axis endpoint of ellipse or [Arc/Center]: pick or
type the first endpoint of one axis
Specify other endpoint of axis: pick or type the other
endpoint of one axis
Specify distance to other axis or [Rotation]: pick or type
the endpoint of the other axis
You can create elliptical arcs (as opposed to the circular arcs that the
AutoCAD Arc command draws) by using the Arc option of the ELlipse com-
mand; it’s perfect for drawing those cannonball trajectories! Alternatively,
you can draw a full ellipse and use the TRIM or BREAK command to cut a
piece out of it.
Splines: The sketchy, sinuous curves
Most people use CAD programs for precision drawing tasks: straight lines,
carefully defined curves, precisely specified points, and so on. AutoCAD is
not the program to free your inner artist — unless your inner artist is
Mondrian. Nonetheless, even meticulously created CAD drawings sometimes
need free-form curves. The AutoCAD spline object is just the thing for the job.
Although PLine is pronounced to rhyme with “beeline,” SPLine rhymes with
“vine.” (If you liked my earlier pronunciation comment, you may want to
think about beer before you say “PLine” and about wine before you say
“SPLine.”)
You can use AutoCAD splines in two ways:
 Eyeball the location and shape of the curve and don’t worry too much
about getting it just so. That’s the free-form, sketchy, not-too-precise
approach that I describe here.
 Specify their control points and curvature characteristics precisely.
Beneath their easy-going, informal exterior, AutoCAD splines are really
highly precise, mathematically defined entities called NURBS curves
(Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline curves). Mathematicians and some
mechanical and industrial designers care a lot about the precise charac-
teristics of the curves they work with. For those people, the AutoCAD
SPLine and SPlinEdit commands include a number of advanced options.
Look up “spline curves” in the AutoCAD online help if you need preci-
sion in your splines.
121
Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line

Drawing splines is straightforward, if you ignore the advanced options. The
following procedure draws a free-form curve with the SPLine command:
1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the spline that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Spline button on the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the SPLine command and prompts you at the command
line to specify the first endpoint of the spline:
Specify first point or [Object]:
3. Specify the start point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
The command line prompts you to specify additional points:
Specify next point:
4. Specify additional points by clicking or typing coordinates.
After you pick the second point, the command line prompt changes to
show additional options:
Specify next point or [Close/Fit tolerance] <start tangent>:
Because you’re drawing a free-form curve, you usually don’t need to use
object snaps or other precision techniques when picking spline points.
5. Press Enter after you’ve chosen the final endpoint of your spline.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify tangent lines for each end of the spline:
Specify start tangent:
Specify end tangent:
The Specify start tangent and Specify end tangent prompts can
control the curvature of the start and end points of the spline. In most
cases, just pressing Enter at both prompts to accept the default tangents
works fine.
6. Press Enter twice to accept the default tangent directions.
AutoCAD draws the spline.
Figure 5-9 shows some examples of splines.
After you’ve drawn a spline, you can grip edit it to adjust its shape. See
Chapter 6 for information about grip editing. If you need finer control over
spline editing, look up the SPlinEdit command in the AutoCAD online help.
122
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Donuts: The circles with a difference
Creating a donut is a simple way to define a single object that consists of two
concentric circles with the space between them filled.
When you start the DOnut command, AutoCAD prompts you for the inside
diameter and the outside diameter — the size of the hole and the size of the
donut, as measured across their widest points. After you’ve entered these
values, AutoCAD prompts you for the center point of the donut. But one
donut is rarely enough, so AutoCAD keeps prompting you for additional
center points until you press Enter (the AutoCAD equivalent of saying, “no,
really, I’m full now!”).
The following example draws a regulation-size donut, with a 1.5-inch hole and
3.5-inch outside diameter. Figure 5-10 shows several kinds of donuts.
Command: DOnut Enter
Specify inside diameter of donut <0.5000>: 1.5 Enter
Specify outside diameter of donut <1.0000>: 3.5 Enter
Specify center of donut or <exit>: pick or type the center
point of one or more donuts
Specify center of donut or <exit>: Enter
Figure 5-9:
A slew of
splines.
123
Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line

You can use the DOnut command to create a filled circle — also known as a
jelly-filled donut. Just specify an inside diameter of 0.
Revision clouds on the horizon
It’s customary in many industries to submit a set of drawings at a stage of
completion and then submit them again later with revisions — corrections,
clarifications, and requested changes. Often, the recipients like to locate
changed stuff easily. A common drafting convention in many industries is to
call attention to revised items by drawing free-form clouds around them. The
REVCLOUD command makes quick work of drawing such clouds.
Drawing revision clouds is easy, after you understand that you click with the
mouse only once in the drawing area. That one click defines the starting
point for the cloud’s perimeter. After that, you simply move the cursor
around, and the cloud takes shape. When you return to near the point that
you clicked in the beginning, AutoCAD automatically closes the cloud.
Figure 5-10:
Donuts,
plain and
jelly-filled.
124
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

The following example shows you how to draw a revision cloud. Figure 5-11
shows what revision clouds look like.
Command: REVCLOUD
Minimum arc length: 0.5000  Maximum arc length: 0.5000
Style: Normal
Specify start point or [Arc length/Object/Style] <Object>:
pick a point along the perimeter of your future
cloud
Guide crosshairs along cloud path... sweep the cursor around
to define the cloud’s perimeter
You don’t need to click again. Simply move the cursor around without click-
ing. AutoCAD draws the next lobe of the cloud when your cursor reaches the
Minimum arc length distance from the end of the previous lobe.
Continue moving the cursor around until you return to the point that you
clicked at first.
Revision cloud finished.
Figure 5-11:
Cloud cover.
125
Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line

Here are a few tips for using revision clouds:
 It’s a good idea to put revision clouds on their own layer so that you can
choose to plot with or without the clouds visible.
 You’ll probably find it easier to control the shape of revision clouds if
you turn off ortho mode before you start the command.
 You may need to add a triangle and number, as shown in Figure 5-11, to
indicate the revision number. A block with an attribute is a good way to
handle this requirement: Chapter 13 covers blocks and attributes.
If the revision cloud’s lobes are too small or too large, erase the cloud, restart
the REVCLOUD command, and use the command’s Arc length option to
change the minimum and maximum arc lengths. The default minimum and
maximum lengths are 0.5 (or 15 in metric drawings) multiplied by the DIM-
SCALE (DIMension SCALE) system variable setting. If you make the minimum
and maximum lengths equal (which is the default), the lobes will be approxi-
mately equal in size. If you make them unequal, there will be more variation
in lobe size — you’ll get “fluffier” clouds. Fortunately, of these options are
more than most nonmeteorologists will need. If you’ve set DIMSCALE prop-
erly during your drawing setup procedure (see Chapter 3), REVCLOUD
should do a pretty good job of guessing reasonable default arc lengths.
Scoring Points
I thought about not covering points in this book, but I didn’t want you com-
plaining that AutoCAD 2005 For Dummies is pointless.
The word point describes two different things in AutoCAD:
 A location in the drawing that you specify (by typing coordinates or
clicking with the mouse)
 An object that you draw with the POint command
Throughout this chapter and most of the book, I tell you to specify points —
that’s the location meaning. This section tells you how to draw point objects.
A point object in AutoCAD can serve two purposes.
 Points often identify specific locations in your drawing to other
people who look at the drawing. A point can be something that dis-
plays on the screen, either as a tiny dot or as another symbol, such as a
cross with a circle around it.
126
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

 You can use points as precise object snap locations. Think of them as
construction points. For example, when you’re laying out a new building,
you might draw point objects at some of the engineering survey points
and then snap to those points as you sketch the building’s shape with
the polyline command. You use the NODe object snap mode to snap to
AutoCAD point objects. In this guise, points usually are for your use in
drawing and editing precisely. Other people who view the drawing prob-
ably won’t even be aware that the point objects are there.
What makes AutoCAD point objects complicated is their almost limitless
range of display options, provided to accommodate the two different kinds of
purposes just described (and possibly some others that I haven’t figured out
yet). You use the Point Style dialog box, shown in Figure 5-12, to specify how
points should look in the current drawing.
DDPTYPE is the command that opens the Point Style dialog box. You can
access it from the menus by choosing Format➪Point Style. The top portion of
the dialog box shows the available point display styles. Most of the choices
do pretty much the same thing. Just click one of the squares that says “hey,
that’s a point!” to you.
Figure 5-12:

Chapter 5: Where to Draw the Line

The first choice, a single-pixel dot, is hard to see on the screen, and the
second choice, invisible (a stealth point?), is impossible to see. Avoid these
choices if you want your point objects to show up on the screen and on plots.
The single-pixel dot, which is the default display style, works well if you use
point objects as object snap locations and don’t want the points obtrusive
on plots.
The remaining settings in the Point Style dialog box control the size at which
points appear on the screen at different zoom resolutions. The default set-
tings often work fine, but if you’re not satisfied with them, click the Help
button to find out how to change them.
After you specify the point style, placing points on-screen is easy; the follow-
ing example shows you how.
This is an example of the command-line commands to create a point:
Command: POint Enter
Current point modes: PDMODE=0 PDSIZE=0.0000
Specify a point:  pick or type the coordinates of a location
in the drawing
PDMODE and PDSIZE in the command prompt are system variables that corre-
spond to the point display mode and display size options in the Point Style
dialog box. If you want to know exactly how the system variables correspond
to the dialog box choices, you have all the makings of a successful CAD nerd.
Click the Help button in the Point Style dialog box to find out more (about the
system variables — not about yourself).
If you start the POint command from the Draw toolbar or the Draw➪Point➪
Multiple Point menu, it will repeat automatically — that is, it will prompt you
repeatedly to Specify a point. When you’re finished drawing points, press
Esc to finish the command for good. If the command doesn’t repeat automati-
cally and you want to draw more points, press the Enter key to repeat the
POint command and pick another location on the screen. Repeat as required:
Enter, pick, Enter, pick, Enter pick . . . by now you should’ve gotten the point.

diting objects is the flip side of creating them, and in AutoCAD, you spend
a lot of time editing — far more than drawing objects from scratch. That’s
partly because the design and drafting process is by its nature iterative, and
also because CAD programs make it easy to edit objects cleanly.
When you edit objects in AutoCAD, you need to be just as concerned about
specifying precise locations and distances as you are when you originally
create the objects. Make sure that you’re familiar with the precision tech-
niques described in Chapter 4 before you apply the editing techniques from
this chapter to real drawings.
Commanding and Selecting
AutoCAD offers two main styles of editing:
 Command-first editing
 Selection-first editing
Within the selection-first editing style, you have an additional choice of edit-
ing that uses actual, named commands and direct manipulation of objects
without named commands. The following sections cover these editing styles.

Command-first editing
With command-first editing, you enter a command and then click the objects
on which the command works. This style of editing may seem backwards to
you at first unless you’re a longtime user of AutoCAD or a veteran of command-
line operating systems (where you typically type the name of command and
then the names of the files or other objects to which you want to apply the
command). Command-first editing works well for power users who are in a
hurry and who are willing to memorize most of the commands they need to
do their work. It’s no surprise that command-first editing is the default style
of editing in AutoCAD.
Selection-first editing
In selection-first editing, you perform the same steps — in the same order —
as in most Windows applications: Select the object first, then choose the
command.
Selection-first editing tends to be easier to master, which is why Windows and
the Macintosh are easier for most people to use for a variety of tasks than DOS
ever was. Selection-first editing makes AutoCAD more approachable for new
and occasional users.
Direct manipulation is a refinement of selection-first editing in which you per-
form common editing operations by using the mouse to grab the selected
object and perform an action on it, such as moving all or part of it to a differ-
ent place in the drawing. No named command is involved; the act of moving
the mouse and clicking the mouse buttons in certain ways causes the editing
changes to happen. AutoCAD supports direct manipulation through a power-
ful but somewhat complicated technique called grip editing. Grips are the little
square handles that appear on an object when you select it. You can use the
grips to stretch, move, copy, rotate, or otherwise edit the object. These grip-
editing techniques can make selection-first editing almost as powerful as 
command-first editing. The complications arise from the fact that you can 
do so many things with an object after you select it.
Choosing an editing style
This chapter emphasizes command-first editing. (I also discuss grip editing at
the end of the chapter.) AutoCAD is fundamentally a command-first program.
AutoCAD started out offering only command-first editing and later added 
selection-first methods; AutoCAD 2005 inherits this ancestral trait. I emphasize 
command-first editing for the following reasons:
130
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

 It’s the default AutoCAD editing style.
 It works consistently with all editing commands — some editing com-
mands remain command-first only.
 It provides added object selection flexibility, which is useful when you
work on complicated, busy drawings.
After you know how to do command-first editing, you can simply reverse the
order of many editing operations to do them selection-first style instead. But
if you don’t get familiar with command-first editing in the beginning, you’ll be
completely bewildered by some very useful AutoCAD commands that work
only in the command-first style, such as TRim and EXtend. (Commands such as
these ignore any already selected objects and prompt you to select objects.)
Much of the information in this chapter assumes that you’re using the default
AutoCAD selection settings. If object selection or grip editing works differently
than I describe in this chapter, check the settings on the Option dialog box’s
Selection tab. Five check box settings should be turned on (all other check box
settings should be turned off):
 Noun/Verb Selection
 Implied Windowing
 Object Grouping
 Enable Grips
 Enable Grip Tips
Grab It
Part of AutoCAD’s editing flexibility comes from its object selection flexibility.
For example, command-first editing offers 16 selection modes! (I describe the
most useful ones in this chapter.) Don’t worry though; you can get by most of
the time with three selection modes:
 Selecting a single object
 Enclosing objects in a window (pick left corner; then right corner)
 Including part or all objects in a crossing window (pick right corner;
then left corner)
131
Chapter 6: Edit for Credit

One-by-one selection
The most obvious way to select objects is to pick (by clicking) them one at a
time. You can build up a selection set cumulatively with this “pick one object
at a time” selection mode. This cumulative convention may be different from
what you’re used to. In most Windows programs, if you select one object and
then another, the first object is deselected, and the second one selected. Only
the object you select last remains selected. In AutoCAD, all the objects you
select, one at a time, remain selected and are added to the set, no matter how
many objects you pick. (You can change this behavior to make AutoCAD work
like Windows does by turning on ‘Use Shift to add to selection’ on the Option
dialog box’s Selection tab, but I suggest you not change it.) Most editing com-
mands affect the entire group of selected objects.
Selection boxes left and right
Selecting objects one at a time works great when you want to edit a small
number of objects, but many CAD editing tasks involve editing lots of objects.
Do you really want to pick 132 lines, arcs, and circles, one at a time?
Like most Windows graphics programs, AutoCAD provides a selection window
feature for grabbing a bunch of objects in a rectangular area. As you may guess
by now, the AutoCAD version of this feature is a bit more powerful than the
analogous feature in other Windows graphics programs and, therefore, slightly
confusing at first. AutoCAD calls its version implied windowing.
If you click a blank area of the drawing —, that is, not on an object — you’re
implying to AutoCAD that you want to specify a selection window, or box. If
you move the cursor to the right before picking the other corner of the selec-
tion box, you’re further implying that you want to select all objects that reside
completely within the selection box. If you instead move the cursor to the left
before picking the other corner of the selection box, you’re implying that you
want to select all objects that reside completely or partially within the selec-
tion box.
The AutoCAD terminology for these two kinds of selection boxes gets a little
confusing:
 The move-to-the-right, only-select-objects-completely-within-the-box
mode is called Window object selection.
 The move-to-the-left, select-objects-completely-or-partially-within-the-
box mode is called Crossing object selection.
132
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

You might think of these modes as bounding box (to the right) and crossing
box (to the left). Fortunately, AutoCAD gives you a visual cue that there’s a
difference. As you move to the right, the bounding box appears as a solid rec-
tangle. As you move to the left, the crossing box appears as a ghosted, or
dashed, rectangle.
Figures 6-1 and 6-2 show a bounding box and a crossing box, respectively, in
action.
You can mix and match selecting individual objects, specifying a bounding box,
and specifying a crossing box. Each selection adds to the current selection set,
allowing you to build up an enormously complicated selection of objects and
then operate on them with one or more editing commands.

Chapter 6: Edit for Credit

You can press the Shift key in combination with any of the three standard
selection modes — single object, bounding box (Window), and crossing box
(Crossing) — to remove already selected objects from the selection set. This
feature is especially useful when you’re building a selection set in a crowded
drawing; you can select a big batch of objects by using Window or Crossing,
and then hold down the Shift key while selecting to remove the objects that
you want to exclude from the editing operation.
Perfecting Selecting
When you edit in command-first mode, you have all the selection options
described in the previous section — single object, bounding box (Window),
and crossing box (Crossing) — plus a slew of others. If you type ? and press
Enter at any Select objects prompt, AutoCAD lists all the selection options:

To use any of the command-first selection options at the Select objects
prompt, type the uppercase letters corresponding to the option and press
Enter. After you’re finished selecting objects, you must press Enter again to
tell AutoCAD that you’ve finished selecting objects and want to start the edit-
ing operation.
The following example demonstrates how to use the Erase command in 
command-first mode with several different selection options. The selection
techniques used in this example apply to most AutoCAD editing commands:
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
If any objects are selected when you start an editing command, the
command in most cases will operate on those objects (selection-first
editing) instead of prompting you to select objects (command-first edit-
ing). For the reasons that I describe earlier in this chapter, you should
use the command-first editing style until you’re thoroughly familiar with
135
Chapter 6: Edit for Credit

it. Later, you can experiment with selection-first editing if you like. (Just
reverse the sequence of commanding and selecting that I describe in this
chapter.)
2. Click the Erase button on the Modify toolbar.
The command line displays the Select objects prompt.
3. Select two or three individual objects by clicking each one.
AutoCAD adds each object to the selection set. All the objects you select
remain ghosted. The command line displays the Select objects prompt.
4. Specify a bounding selection box (Window) that completely encloses
several objects.
Move the cursor to a point below and to the left of the objects, click,
release the mouse button, move the cursor above and to the right of the
objects, and click again.
All objects that are completely within the box are selected.
5. Specify a crossing selection box (Crossing) that encloses a few objects
and cuts through several others.
Move the cursor to a point below and to the right of some of the objects,
click, release the mouse button, move the cursor above and to the left of
some of the objects, and click and release again.
All objects that are completely within or cross through the box are
selected.
6. Type WP and press Enter to activate the WPolygon selection option.
The command line prompts you to pick points that define the selection
polygon.
7. Pick a series of points and press Enter.
Figure 6-3 shows an example. After you press Enter, AutoCAD selects all
objects that are completely within the polygon.
8. Press Enter to end object selection.
AutoCAD erases all the selected objects.
Notice how you were able to use a combination of object selection methods to
build up a selection set and then press Enter to execute the command on them.
Most AutoCAD editing commands work this way in command-first mode.
If, after erasing a selection set, you immediately realize that you didn’t really
mean to do away with so many objects, you can use the Undo button on the
Standard toolbar to restore all of them. But AutoCAD has one additional 
un-erase trick up its sleeve — the aptly named OOPS command. When you
type OOPS and press Enter, AutoCAD restores the last selection set that you
erased — even if you’ve run other commands after Erase.
136
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Ready, Get Set, Edit!
The following sections cover the most important AutoCAD editing commands,
using command-first editing mode.
Whether you start an AutoCAD editing command by clicking a toolbar button,
choosing a pull-down menu command, or typing a command name, in almost
all cases the command prompts you for points, distances, and options at the
command line. Read the command line prompts during every step of the com-
mand, especially when you’re figuring out how to use a new editing command.
Otherwise, you’re unlikely to complete the command successfully.
As I describe in Chapter 4, maintaining precision when you draw and edit is
crucial to good CAD work. If you’ve used a drawing program and are accus-
tomed to moving, stretching, and otherwise editing objects by eye, you’ll need
to suppress that habit when you edit in AutoCAD. Nothing ruins a drawing
faster than approximate editing, in which you shove objects around until they
look okay, without worrying about precise distances and points.

Chapter 6: Edit for Credit

The Big Three: Move, CoPy, and Stretch
Moving, copying, and stretching are, for many drafters, the three most common
editing operations. AutoCAD obliges this need with the Move, CoPy, and Stretch
commands.
Base points and displacements
The Move, CoPy, and Stretch commands all require that you specify how far
and in what direction you want the objects moved, copied, or stretched. After
you’ve selected the objects to be edited and started the command, AutoCAD
prompts you for two pieces of information:
Specify base point or displacement:
Specify second point of displacement or <use first point as
displacement>:
In a not-so-clear way, these prompts say that two possible methods exist for
you to specify how far and in what direction you want the objects copied,
moved, or stretched:
 The most common way is to pick or type the coordinates of two points
that define a displacement vector. AutoCAD calls these points the base
point and the second point (hence, it’s called the “base point method”).
Imagine an arrow pointing from the base point to the second point —
that arrow defines how far and in what direction the objects get copied,
moved, or stretched.
 The other way is to type an X,Y pair of numbers that represents a dis-
tance rather than a point. This distance is the absolute displacement
that you want to copy, move, or stretch the objects (thus it’s called the
“displacement method”).
How does AutoCAD know whether your response to the first prompt is a base
point or a displacement? It depends on how you respond to the second prompt.
(Is that confusing, or what?) First, you pick a point on-screen or enter coordi-
nates at the Base point prompt. Next, there are a couple of possibilities:
 If you then pick or type the coordinates of a point at the second point
prompt, AutoCAD says to itself, “Aha — displacement vector!” and moves
the objects according to the imaginary arrow pointing from the base point
to the second point.
 If you press Enter at the second prompt (without having typed anything),
AutoCAD says, “Aha — displacement distance,” and uses the X,Y pair of
numbers that you typed at the first prompt as an absolute displacement
distance.
138
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

What makes this displacement business even more confusing is that AutoCAD
lets you pick a point at the first prompt and press Enter at the second prompt.
AutoCAD still says, “Aha — displacement distance,” but now it treats the coor-
dinates of the point you picked as an absolute distance. If the point you picked
has relatively large coordinates, the objects can get moved way outside the
normal drawing area as defined by the limits. The objects fly off into space,
which you probably won’t notice at first because you’re zoomed into part of
your normal drawing area; it just looks to you like the objects have vanished!
In short, be careful when you press Enter during the Move, CoPy, and Stretch
commands. Press Enter in response to the second prompt only if you want
AutoCAD to use your response to the first prompt as an absolute displace-
ment. If you make a mistake, click the Undo button to back up and try again.
You can use Zoom Extents (described in Chapter 7) to look for objects that
have flown off into space.
Move
The following steps demonstrate command-first editing with the Move com-
mand, using the base point method of indicating how far and in what direction
to move the selected objects. This procedure also gives detailed recommenda-
tions on how to use precision techniques when you edit:
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
2. Click the Move button on the Modify toolbar.
The command line displays the Select objects prompt.
3. Select one or more objects.
You can use any of the object selection techniques described in the “Per-
fecting Selecting” section, earlier in this chapter.
4. Press Enter when you’re finished selecting objects.
AutoCAD displays the following prompt:
Specify base point or displacement:
5. Specify a base point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
This point serves as the tail end of your imaginary arrow indicating how
far and in what direction you want the objects moved. After you pick a
base point, it’s fairly easy to see what’s going on because AutoCAD dis-
plays a temporary image of the object that moves around as you move
the cursor. Figure 6-4 shows what the screen looks like.
139
Chapter 6: Edit for Credit

Specify a base point somewhere on or near the object(s) that you’re
moving. You can use an object snap mode to choose a point exactly on
one of the objects.
AutoCAD displays the following prompt:
Specify second point of displacement or <use first point
as displacement>:
6. Specify the second point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
The second point serves as the arrow end of your imaginary displace-
ment arrow. After you specify the second point, AutoCAD moves the
objects.
Don’t press Enter alone at this prompt! If you do, AutoCAD treats the X,Y
coordinates of the first point you picked as an absolute displacement,
and the objects fly off in an unpredictable fashion.

140
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

These are common precision techniques for specifying the second point:
 Use an object snap mode to pick a second point exactly on another object
in the drawing.
 Type a relative or polar coordinate, as described in Chapter 4. For exam-
ple, if you type @6,2, AutoCAD moves the objects 6 units to the right and
2 units up. If you type @3<45, AutoCAD moves the objects 3 units at an
angle of 45 degrees.
 Use direct distance entry to move objects in an orthogonal or polar track-
ing direction. See Chapter 4 for instructions.
Copy
The CoPy command works almost identically to the Move command, except
that AutoCAD leaves the selected objects in place and moves new copies of
them to the new location. The CoPy command also includes a Multiple option
for making multiple copies of the same set of objects. You activate the Multi-
ple option by typing M and pressing Enter after you finish object selection. As
always, you must watch the command line prompts to find out what you can
do and when to do it!
Copy between drawings
You can’t copy objects from one drawing to another with the CoPy command.
Instead, you use the COPYCLIP command, together with its companion com-
mand, PASTECLIP. Follow these steps:
1. Open two drawings that contain geometry you want to copy from one
to the other. Arrange the two drawings so that you can see both of
them, as shown in Figure 6-5.
If you don’t have enough screen real estate to arrange the two drawings
side by side, you can leave them overlapped and change between the two
drawing windows by using the Window menu or by pressing Ctrl+Tab.
2. In the first drawing, right-click in the drawing area and choose Copy
from the cursor menu.
Choose Cut if you want to move rather than copy the objects to the other
drawing. Choose Copy with Base Point if you want to choose a specific
base point rather than let AutoCAD choose a base point.
The base point that AutoCAD chooses is the lower-left corner of an imag-
inary rectangle that just barely encloses all the objects you’ve selected.
3. If you chose Copy with Base Point in Step 2, pick a base point to use
for the copy operation.
The base point is like a base point for a block definition, as described in
Chapter 13. Choose a useful point such as the endpoint of a line, the
lower-left corner of a rectangle, or the center of a circle.
141
Chapter 6: Edit for Credit

4. Select the objects that you want to copy and then press Enter to end
object selection.
5. Click in the second drawing’s window to make it current.
6. Right-click in the second drawing’s window and choose Paste from the
cursor menu.
Choose Paste to Original Coordinates if you want to copy the objects so
that they land at the same point (with respect to 0,0) in the second
drawing as they were located in the first drawing.
7. Specify an insertion point for the copied objects by object snapping to
a point on an existing object or typing absolute X,Y coordinates.
AutoCAD copies the objects.
It’s easy to confuse the CoPy and COPYCLIP commands:
 CoPy is AutoCAD’s primary command for copying objects within a 
drawing.
 COPYCLIP — along with related commands like CUTCLIP and 
PASTECLIP — is AutoCAD’s version of copy and paste via the Windows
Clipboard.
Figure 6-5:

142

(You can use the Windows Clipboard cut-and-paste method to copy or move
objects within a single drawing, but using the AutoCAD CoPy and Move com-
mands usually gives you better control and precision.)
Table 6-2 summarizes AutoCAD’s Clipboard-related commands, along with the
equivalent choices on the right-click menu and the Standard toolbar.

Stretch
The Stretch command is superficially similar to CoPy and Move; it has the
same inscrutable base point and displacement prompts, and it shifts objects —
or parts of objects — to other locations in the drawing. But it also has impor-
tant differences that often confound new AutoCAD users to the point where
they give up trying to find out how to use Stretch. That’s a mistake, because
Stretch is a valuable command. With it, you can perform editing operations in
seconds that would take many minutes with other commands. Here are the
things you need to know to make Stretch your friend:
 To use Stretch, you must select objects by using a crossing selection box
(or crossing polygon), as described in the section “Perfecting Selecting,”
earlier in this chapter. See Figure 6-6.
 Stretch operates on the defining points of objects — endpoints of a line,
vertices of a polyline, the center of a circle, and so on — according to
the following rule: If a defining point is within the crossing selection box
that you specify, AutoCAD moves the defining point and updates the
object accordingly.
For example, if your crossing selection box surrounds one endpoint of a
line but not the other endpoint, Stretch moves the first endpoint and
redraws the line in the new position dictated by the first endpoint’s new
location. It’s as though you have a rubber band tacked to the wall with
two pins, and you move one of the pins. See Figure 6-7.
143
Chapter 6: Edit for Credit

 Stretch can make lines longer or shorter, depending on your crossing
selection box and displacement vector. In other words, the Stretch com-
mand really combines stretching and compressing.
 You usually want to turn on ortho or polar tracking mode before stretch-
ing. Otherwise, you’ll end up stretching objects in strange directions, as
shown in Figure 6-8.

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

The following steps describe how to Stretch lines:
1. Draw some lines in an arrangement similar to the dark lines shown in
Figure 6-9.
Start your stretching with simple objects. You can work up to more com-
plicated objects — polylines, circles, arcs, and so on — after you’ve lim-
bered up with lines.
2. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
3. Click the Stretch button on the Modify toolbar.
The command line displays the Select objects prompt, with a warn-
ing to use the Crossing or CPolygon object selection mode:
Select objects to stretch by crossing-window or crossing-
polygon...
Select objects:
4. Specify a crossing selection box that encloses some, but not all, end-
points of the lines.
Figure 6-9 shows a sample crossing selection box that completely encloses
the two vertical lines on the right side of the figure. This crossing selec-
tion box cuts through the four horizontal lines, enclosing only one end-
point of each.
You specify a crossing selection box by picking a point, moving your
mouse to the left, and picking a second point.
5. Press Enter to end object selection.
AutoCAD displays the following prompt.
Specify base point or displacement:
6. Specify a base point by object snapping to a point on an existing object
or by typing absolute X,Y coordinates.
This step is just like Step 5 in the Move procedure earlier in this chapter.
AutoCAD displays the following prompt.
Specify second point of displacement or <use first point
as displacement>:
7. Toggle ortho mode on and then off by clicking the ORTHO button on
the status bar; try moving the cursor around first with ortho mode on
and then with it off to see the difference.
Figure 6-9 shows what the screen looks like as you move the cursor
around with ortho off.

Chapter 6: Edit for Credit

8. Toggle ortho mode on and then specify the second point — usually by
using direct distance entry, object snapping to a point on an existing
object, or typing relative X,Y coordinates.
This step is just like Step 6 in the Move procedure earlier in this chapter.
After you pick the second point, AutoCAD stretches the objects. Notice
that the Stretch command moved the two vertical lines because the
crossing selection box contained both endpoints of both lines. Stretch
lengthened or shortened the four horizontal lines because the crossing
selection box enclosed only one endpoint of each.
The Stretch command takes some practice, but it’s worth the effort. Draw some
additional kinds of objects and practice stretching with different crossing selec-
tion box locations as well as different base points and second points.

More manipulations
The commands in this section — ROtate, SCale, ARray, and OFfset — provide
other ways (in addition to Move, CoPy, and Stretch) of manipulating objects
or creating new versions of them. The procedures for each command assume
that you’re familiar with the object selection and editing precision techniques
presented in the Move, CoPy, and Stretch procedures (see the previous sec-
tions in this chapter).
Rotate
The ROtate command “swings” one or more objects around a point that you
specify. Follow these steps to use the ROtate command:
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
2. Click the Rotate button on the Modify toolbar.
3. Select one or more objects and then press Enter to end object selection.
AutoCAD prompts you for the base point for rotating the selected objects:
Specify base point:
4. Specify a base point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
The base point becomes the point about which AutoCAD rotates the
objects. You also have to specify a rotation angle:
Specify rotation angle or [Reference]:
5. Specify a rotation angle by typing an angle measurement and pressing
Enter.
Alternatively, you can indicate an angle on the screen by moving the
cursor until the Coordinates section of the status bar indicates the
desired angle and then clicking. If you choose this alternative, you will
need to use ortho mode or polar tracking to indicate a precise angle (for
example, 90 or 45 degrees) or an object snap to rotate an object so that
it aligns precisely with other objects.
After you specify the rotation angle by typing or picking, AutoCAD rotates
the objects into their new position.
147

Scale
If you read all my harping on drawing scales and drawing scale factors in Chap-
ter 3, you may think that the SCale command performs some magical scale
transformation on your entire drawing. No such luck. It merely scales one or
more objects up or down by a factor that you specify. Here’s how it works:
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
2. Click the Scale button on the Modify toolbar.
3. Select one or more objects and then press Enter to end object selection.
AutoCAD prompts you for the base point about which it will scale all the
selected objects:
Specify base point:
AutoCAD does not scale each object individually around its own base
point (because most AutoCAD drawing objects don’t have individual
base points). Instead, AutoCAD uses the base point that you specify to
determine how to scale all objects in the selection set. For example, if
you select a circle to scale, pick a point outside the circle as the base
point, and then specify a scale factor of 2, AutoCAD not only makes the
circle twice as big, but also moves the circle twice as far away from the
base point that you specified.
4. Specify a base point by picking a point or typing coordinates.
The base point becomes the point about which the objects are scaled.
AutoCAD prompts you for the scale factor:
Specify scale factor or [Reference]:
5. Type a scale factor and press Enter.
AutoCAD then scales the objects by the factor that you type, using the
base point that you specified. Numbers greater than one increase the
objects’ size. Numbers smaller than one decrease the objects’ size.
Changing the drawing scale factor of a drawing after you’ve drawn it is a
tedious and complicated process in AutoCAD. In brief, you need to change the
scale-dependent system variables described in Chapter 3, and then scale
some, but not all, drawing objects. You don’t scale the real-world geometry
that you’ve drawn, because its measurements in the real world remain the
same. You do scale objects such as text and hatching that have a fixed height
or spacing regardless of drawing scale factor. (The SCALETEXT command can
help with this operation. See Chapter 9 for more information.) Because of these
complications, try to make sure that you choose a proper scale and set up
the drawing properly for that scale before you begin drawing. See Chapter 3
for details.

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Array
The ARray command is like a supercharged CoPy: You use it to create a rectan-
gular grid of objects at regular X and Y spacings or a polar wheel of objects at a
regular angular spacing. For example, you can use rectangular arrays to popu-
late an auditorium with chairs or a polar array to draw bicycle spokes.
The following steps describe how to create a rectangular array, which you’ll
probably do more often than creating a polar array:
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
Alternatively, you can select objects before starting the ARray command
and thereby skip Step 3.
2. Click the Array button on the Modify toolbar.
The Array dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-10.
3. Click the Select Objects button, and then select one or more objects.
Press Enter to end object selection and return to the Array dialog box.
4. Make sure that the Rectangular Array radio button is selected.
If rectangular arrays seem too square, choose the cool Polar Array radio
button instead and experiment with the other array option.
5. Fill in the five edit boxes: Rows, Columns, Row Offset, Column Offset,
and Angle of Array.
Figure 6-10:
ARray

149
Chapter 6: Edit for Credit

The Rows and Columns numbers include the row and column of the origi-
nal objects themselves. In other words, entries of 1 don’t create any new
objects in that direction. The Row Offset and Column Offset measure-
ments are the distances between adjacent rows and columns.
6. Click Preview.
AutoCAD shows what the array will look like by using your current set-
tings and displays a dialog box with Accept, Modify, and Cancel buttons.
7. Click the Accept button if you’re satisfied with the array, or the Modify
button if you want to change the array parameters.
Offset
You use Offset to create parallel copies of lines, polylines, circles, arcs, or
splines. Follow these steps to use OFfset:
1. Click the Offset button on the Modify toolbar.
AutoCAD prompts you for the offset distance — the distance from the orig-
inal object to the copy you’re creating:
Specify offset distance or [Through] <Through>:
2. Type an offset distance and press Enter.
Alternatively, you can indicate an offset distance by picking two points on
the screen. If you choose this method, you normally should use object
snaps to specify a precise distance from one existing object to another.
AutoCAD prompts you to select the object from which you want to
create an offset copy:
Select object to offset or <exit>:
3. Select a single object, such as a line, polyline, or arc.
Note that you can select only one object at a time with the OFfset com-
mand. AutoCAD asks where you want the offset object:
Specify point on side to offset:
4. Point to one side or the other of the object and then click.
It doesn’t matter how far away from the object the cursor is when you
click. You’re simply indicating a direction.
AutoCAD repeats the Select object prompt, in case you want to offset
other objects by the same distance:
Select object to offset or <exit>:
5. Go back to Step 3 if you want to offset another object, or press Enter if
you’re finished offsetting objects for now.
Figure 6-11 shows the OFfset command in progress.
150
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

If you want to offset a series of connected lines (for example, a rectangular
house plan outline or one side of a pathway on a map), make sure that you
either draw it as a polyline or convert the individual line and/or arc segments
into a polyline with the PEdit command. If you draw a series of line segments
with the Line command and then try to offset it, you have to pick each seg-
ment and offset it individually. Even worse, the corners usually aren’t finished
off in the way that you’d expect, because AutoCAD doesn’t treat the segments
as connected. You avoid all these problems by offsetting a polyline, which
AutoCAD does treat as a single object. See Chapter 5 for more information
about the differences between lines and polylines.
Slicing and dicing
The commands in this section — TRim, EXtend, BReak, Fillet, and CHamfer —
are useful for shortening and lengthening objects and for breaking them in two.

Trim and Extend
TRim and EXtend are the twin commands for making lines, polylines, and arcs
shorter and longer. They’re the yin and yang, the Laurel and Hardy, the Jack
Sprat and his wife of the AutoCAD editing world. The two commands and their
prompts are almost identical, so the following steps cover both. I show the
prompts for the TRim command; the EXtend prompts are similar:
1. Click the Trim or Extend button on the Modify toolbar.
AutoCAD prompts you to select cutting edges that will do the trimming
(or, if you chose the EXtend command, boundary edges for extending to):
Current settings: Projection=UCS, Edge=None
Select cutting edges ...
Select objects:
2. Select one or more objects that will act as the knife for trimming objects
or the wall to which objects will be extended. Press Enter to end object
selection.
Figure 6-12 shows a cutting edge (for TRim) and a boundary edge (for
EXtend).
AutoCAD prompts you to select objects that you want to trim or extend:
Select object to trim or shift-select to extend or
[Project/Edge/Undo]:
3. Select a single object to trim or extend. Choose the portion of the
object that you want AutoCAD to trim away or the end of the object
that’s closer to the extend-to boundary.
AutoCAD trims or extends the object to one of the objects that you
selected in Step 2. If AutoCAD can’t trim or extend the object — for exam-
ple, if the trimming object and the object to be trimmed are parallel —
the command line displays an error message such as Object does not
intersect an edge.
TRim and EXtend normally allow you to select only one object at a time
for trimming or extending. The one exception is that you can type F and
press Enter to use the Fence object selection mode (refer to Table 6-1).
Fence is useful for trimming or extending a large group of objects in one
fell swoop.
The command line continues to prompt you to select other objects to
trim or extend:
Select object to trim or shift-select to extend or
[Project/Edge/Undo]:
152
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

4. Choose additional objects, or press Enter when you’re finished trim-
ming or extending.
If you accidentally trim or extend the wrong object and you’re still in the
TRim or EXtend command, type U and press Enter to undo the most
recent trim or extend.
The example in Figure 6-12 shows trimming to a single cutting edge, in which
the end of the trimmed lines gets lopped off. Another common use of the TRim
command is for trimming out a piece of a line between two cutting edges. In
the two-cutting-edges scenario, TRim cuts a piece out of the middle of the
trimmed line.
The LENgthen command provides other useful ways to make lines, arcs, and
polylines longer (or shorter). You can specify an absolute distance (or “delta”)
to lengthen or shorten by, a percentage to lengthen or shorten by, or a new
total length. Look up “LENGTHEN command” in AutoCAD’s help system for
more information.

Break
The BReak command isn’t what you use before heading out for coffee. It’s for
breaking pieces out of — that is, creating gaps in — lines, polylines, circles,
arcs, or splines. BReak also comes in handy if you need to split one object
into two without actually removing any visible material.
If you want to create regularly spaced gaps in an object — so that it displays
dashed, for instance — don’t use BReak. Use an AutoCAD dash-dot linetype
instead. See Chapter 4 for more linetype information.
The following example shows how you BReak an object:
1. Click the Break button on the Modify toolbar.
AutoCAD prompts you to select a single object that you want to break:
Select object:
2. Select a single object, such as a line, polyline, or arc.
The point you pick when selecting the object serves double duty: It
selects the object, of course, but it also becomes the default first break
point (that is, it defines one side of the gap that you’ll create). Thus, you
should either use one of the AutoCAD precision techniques, such as an
object snap, to pick the object at a precise point, or use the First point
option (described in the next step) to repick the first break point.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify the second break point, or to type F and
press Enter if you want to respecify the first break point:
Specify second break point or [First point]:
3. If the point that you picked in the preceding step doesn’t also corre-
spond to a break point (see the previous tip), type F and press Enter to
respecify the first break point, and then pick the point with an object
snap or other precision technique.
If you do type F and press Enter and then respecify the first break point,
AutoCAD prompts you now to select the second break point:
Specify second break point:
4. Specify the second break point by picking a point or typing coordinates.
AutoCAD cuts a section out of the object, using the first and second
break points to define the length of the gap.
If you want to cut an object into two pieces without removing anything, click
the Break at Point button on the Modify toolbar. You first select the object and
then choose a second point that defines where AutoCAD breaks the object in
two. You can then move, copy, or otherwise manipulate each section of the
original object as a separate object.
154
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Fillet and Chamfer
Whereas TRim, EXtend, and BReak alter one object at a time, the Fillet and
CHamfer commands require a pair of objects. As Figure 6-13 shows, Fillet cre-
ates a curved corner between two lines, whereas CHamfer creates an angled,
straight corner. In case you wondered, it’s pronounced “fill-et,” not “fill-eh.”
Saying that you know how to “fill-eh” may get you a job in a butcher shop, but
it will get you strange looks in a design office.
The following steps describe how to use the Fillet command:
1. Click the Fillet button on the Modify toolbar.
AutoCAD displays the current Fillet settings and prompts you to select
the first object for filleting or specify one of three options:
Current settings: Mode = TRIM, Radius = 0.0000
Select first object or [Polyline/Radius/Trim/mUltiple]:
2. Type R and press Enter to set the fillet radius.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify the fillet radius that it uses for future
fillet operations:
Specify fillet radius <0.0000>:
Figure 6-13:

up those

Chapter 6: Edit for Credit

3. Type a fillet radius and press Enter.
The number you type will be the radius of the arc that joins the two lines.
Select first object or [Polyline/Radius/Trim/mUltiple]:
4. Select the first line of the pair that you want to fillet.
AutoCAD prompts you to select the second object for filleting:
Select second object:
5. Select the second line of the pair that you want to fillet.
AutoCAD fillets the two objects, drawing an arc of the radius that you
specified in Step 3.
You can fillet two lines and specify a radius of zero to make them meet at a
point. If you have lots of lines to fillet, whether with a zero or nonzero radius,
use the Fillet command’s mUtliple option to speed the process.
The CHamfer command works similarly except that, instead of specifying a
fillet distance, you specify either two chamfer distances or a chamfer length
and angle.
Get a Grip
Although command-first editing is the most flexible and widespread editing
style in AutoCAD, it’s not the only way. Grip editing is a useful adjunct to 
command-first editing, especially when you want to modify just one or two
objects. You may have encountered grip editing when using other kinds of
graphics programs. Even if you’re an experienced user of other graphics pro-
grams, you’ve never seen grips used in quite the way that AutoCAD uses them.
Anything that you can do with grip editing can be done with command-first
editing as well. In some situations, grip editing is a little more efficient or con-
venient than command-first editing, but command-first editing always gets
the job done. If you master only one style of editing, make it command-first
style. In other words, feel free to skip this section — at least until you’re com-
fortable with command-first editing.
About grips
Grips are little square handles that appear on an object after you select it. 
156
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

In their simplest guise, AutoCAD grips work similar to the little squares on
graphical objects in other Windows programs. But in AutoCAD, instead of
clicking and dragging a grip, you must click, release the mouse button, move
the cursor, and click again at the new location. (By separating the selection of
beginning and ending points into two different operations, AutoCAD allows
you to use different techniques — such as different object snap modes — to
select each point.)
AutoCAD grips are, for sophisticated users, better than the grips found in most
other programs, because you can do so much more with them. You can, for
example, use AutoCAD grips to move, stretch, or copy an object. You also can
use them to rotate an object, scale it to a different size, or mirror an object —
that is, create one or more backwards copies. Grips also act as visible object
snaps, or little magnets that draw the cursor to themselves.
A gripping example
The following sections cover in detail the five grip-editing modes — Stretch,
Move, Rotate, Scale, and Mirror. Follow these steps to explore the grip-editing
modes:
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
AutoCAD displays the naked command prompt — that is, no command
is currently active:
Command:
2. Click an object on-screen to select it and display its grips.
Grips — solid blue squares on the selected object — appear at various
points on the object. Note that the AutoCAD command prompt remains
naked; you haven’t started a command or grip-editing operation yet.
3. Click another object.
Both the newly selected object and the object that you selected previ-
ously display grips.
4. Click one of the grips on either object.
The blue square turns to a red square. This grip is now hot, or ready for
a grip-editing operation.
Grip-editing options now appear on the command line. The first option
to appear is STRETCH.
157
Chapter 6: Edit for Credit

5. Press the spacebar repeatedly to cycle through the five grip-editing
options on the command line:
** STRETCH **
Specify stretch point or [Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit]:
** MOVE **
Specify move point or [Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit]:
** ROTATE **
Specify rotation angle or [Base
point/Copy/Undo/Reference/eXit]:
** SCALE **
Specify scale factor or [Base
point/Copy/Undo/Reference/eXit]:
** MIRROR **
Specify second point or [Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit]:
The grip-editing option displayed on the command line changes as you
press the spacebar. If you move the cursor (without picking) in between
each press of the spacebar, the appearance of your selected object
changes as you display each option. As you can see, each of the grip-
editing operations resembles the ordinary AutoCAD command of the
same name. Choosing STRETCH, for example, causes a stretched version
of the object to appear on-screen.
Pressing the spacebar a bunch of times is a good way to become familiar
with the grip-editing modes, but there’s a more direct way to choose a
particular mode. After you click a grip to make it hot, right-click to dis-
play the grip-editing menu. That menu contains all the grip-editing options
plus some other choices, as shown in Figure 6-14.
6. Press the spacebar until STRETCH (or the option you want) reappears
as the grip-editing option.
7. Move the hot grip in the direction in which you want to stretch (or
otherwise manipulate) your object.
AutoCAD dynamically updates the image of the object to show you what
the modified object will look like before you click the final location.

8. Click again to finish the grip-editing operation.
The selected object with the hot grip updates. The object with the cold
grips doesn’t change.
9. Click the same grip that you chose in Step 4 (now in a different loca-
tion) to make it hot.
10. This time, move the cursor near one of the grips on the other object.
When you feel the magnetic pull of the grip on the other object, click
again to connect the hot grip with the other grip.
The object point represented by the hot grip now coincides exactly with
the grip on the other object.
11. Press Esc to deselect all objects and remove all grips.
Figure 6-15 shows a hot (red) endpoint grip of a line being connected to the
cold (blue) endpoint grip of another line. The ghosted line shows the original
position of the line being edited, and the continuous line shows the new posi-
tion. Using a grip in this way as a visible object snap offers the same advan-
tage as using single point object snaps, as described in Chapter 4: It ensures
precision by making sure that objects meet exactly.

You can experiment with all the grip-editing options to find out how they affect
a selected object.
Because MOVE and STRETCH are the most useful grip-editing modes, I cover
them more specifically.
Move it!
Back in the days of manual drafting, moving objects was a big pain in the
eraser. You had to erase the stuff you wanted to move and redraw the objects
in their new location. In the process, you usually ended up erasing parts of
other stuff that you didn’t want to move and left smudged lines and piles of
eraser dust everywhere. CAD does away with all the fuss and muss of moving
objects, and AutoCAD grip editing is a great way to make it happen. The fol-
lowing steps describe how to move objects:
1. Select one or more objects.
Use any combination of the three editing modes — single object, bound-
ing box, or crossing box — described in the section, “Grab It,” earlier in
this chapter.
2. Click one of the grips to make it hot.
At this point in your editing career, it doesn’t matter which grip you click.
As you become more familiar with grip editing, you’ll discover that cer-
tain grips serve as better reference points than others for particular edit-
ing operations.
3. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Move from the
cursor menu.
4. Move the cursor to a different location and click.
As you move the cursor around, AutoCAD displays the tentative new
positions for all the objects, as shown in Figure 6-16. After you click, the
objects assume their new positions.
5. Press Esc to deselect all objects and remove all grips.
Copy, or a kinder, gentler Move
If you were paying attention during “A gripping example,” earlier in the chapter,
you may have noticed while pressing the spacebar that COPY was not among
the five grip-editing modes. Why not? Because every grip mode includes a copy
option (as the command line prompts shown in “A gripping example,” earlier in
this chapter indicate). In other words, you can STRETCH with copy, MOVE with
copy, ROTATE with copy, SCALE with copy, and MIRROR with copy.
160
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

The copy option leaves the selected objects in place and does the editing
operation on a new copy of the objects.
By far the most common use for the copy option is with the MOVE grip-editing
mode. If you think about “MOVE with copy” for about two seconds, you’ll real-
ize that it’s just a complicated way of saying “copy.” The following steps show
how to copy objects quickly by using grip editing:
1. Select one or more objects.
2. Click any one of the grips to make it hot.
3. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Move from the
cursor menu.
If you want to copy objects in the normal sense of the word “copy,” you
must choose the MOVE grip-editing mode first. Otherwise, you’ll be copy-
ing with the STRETCH grip-editing mode.
4. Right-click again and choose Copy from the cursor menu.

5. Move the cursor to a different location and click.
After you click, new objects appear in the new location.
6. Move the cursor to additional locations and click there if you want to
make additional copies.
7. Press Esc twice — once to end the copying operation and once to des-
elect all objects and remove all grips.
A warm-up Stretch
In AutoCAD, stretching is the process of making objects longer or shorter. The
STRETCH grip-editing operation is really a combination of stretching and com-
pressing, but the programmers probably realized that STRETCHANDCOMPRESS
didn’t exactly roll off the tongue.
The STRETCH grip-editing mode works differently than the other modes. By
default, it affects only the object with the hot grip on it, not all objects with
grips on them. You can override this default behavior by using the Shift key
to pick multiple hot grips. Follow these steps to get acquainted with using the
STRETCH grip-editing mode to stretch one or more objects:
1. Turn off ortho mode by clicking the ORTHO button on the status bar
until the button appears to be pushed out and the words <Ortho off>
appear on the command line.
Ortho mode forces stretch displacements to be orthogonal — that is,
parallel to lines running at 0 and 90 degrees. During real editing tasks,
you’ll often want to turn on ortho mode, but while you get acquainted
with stretching, leaving ortho mode off makes things clearer.
2. Select several objects, including at least one line.
3. On one of the lines, click one of the endpoint grips to make it hot.
All the objects remain selected, but as you move the cursor, only the line
with the hot grip changes. Figure 6-17 shows an example.
4. Click a new point for the hot endpoint grip.
The line stretches to accommodate the new endpoint location.
5. On the same line, click the midpoint grip to make it hot.
As you move the cursor, the entire line moves. Using the STRETCH grip-
editing mode with a line’s midpoint “stretches” the entire line to a new
location.
162
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

6. Click a new point for the hot midpoint grip.
The line moves to the new midpoint location.
7. On one of the lines, click one of the endpoint grips to make it hot.
8. Hold down the Shift key, and then click one of the endpoint grips on a
different line to make it hot.
Two grips on two different lines are now hot because you held down the
Shift key and clicked the second grip.
You can create more hot grips by holding down the Shift key and clicking
more grips.
9. Release the Shift key and re-pick any one of the hot grips.

Chapter 6: Edit for Credit

Releasing the Shift key signals that you’re finished making grips hot. Re-
picking one of the hot grips establishes it as the base point for the stretch
operation (see Figure 6-18).
10. Click a new point for the grip.
All the objects with hot grips stretch based on the displacement of the
grip that you clicked in Step 9.
11. Turn on ortho mode by clicking the ORTHO button on the status bar
until the button appears to be pushed in and the words <Ortho on>
appear on the command line. Repeat Steps 2 through 10 to see the
effect of ortho mode on stretching.
For most real-world editing situations, you’ll want to turn on ortho or polar
tracking mode before stretching. Ortho mode is good for all kinds of drawing
and editing tasks because it enforces a nice, rectilinear orderliness on your
drawing. Chapter 4 describes how to use ortho mode to draw orthogonal lines.

Polishing those properties
When you think of editing objects, you probably
think first about editing their geometry: moving,
stretching, making new copies, and so on. That’s
the kind of editing I cover in this chapter.
Another kind of editing is changing objects’
properties. As I describe in Chapter 4, every
object in an AutoCAD drawing has a set of non-
geometrical properties, including layer, color,
linetype, and lineweight. Sometimes, you need
to edit those properties — when you acciden-
tally draw something on the wrong layer, for
example. Three common ways of editing
objects properties in AutoCAD are
 The Properties palette: This is the most flex-
ible way to edit properties. Select any object
(or objects), right-click in the drawing area,
and choose Properties from the cursor
menu. The Properties palette displays a
tabular grid that lists the names and values
of all properties. Click in the value cell to
change a particular property.
 Layers and Properties toolbars: Another way
to change properties is to select objects and
then choose from the drop-down lists (Layer,
Color, and so on) on the Layers and the
Properties toolbars. See Chapter 4 for more
information.
 Match Properties: You can use the Match
Properties button on the Standard toolbar
— the button with the paintbrush on it — to
paint properties from one object to another.
Match Properties works similarly to the
Format Painter button in Microsoft applica-
tions. Match Properties works even when
the objects reside in different drawings.

O
ne of the advantages of CAD over manual drawing is its capability of
giving you different ways to view your drawing. You can zoom in close,
zoom out to a great distance, and pan around. In fact, not only can you zoom
and pan in your drawing, but in most kinds of drawings, you must do it fre-
quently to be able to draw, edit, and view effectively.
Technical drawings are jampacked with lines, text, and dimensions. Zooming
and panning frequently enables you to see the details better, draw more con-
fidently (because you can see what you’re doing), and edit more quickly
(because object selection is easier when there aren’t a zillion objects on the
screen). This chapter covers AutoCAD’s most useful display control features.
Zoom and Pan with Glass and Hand
Moving your viewpoint in to get a closer view of your drawing data is called
zooming in; moving your viewpoint back to get a more expansive view is
called zooming out.
Zooming in and out of your drawing is one of the big advantages that
AutoCAD offers over manual drawing. You can do detailed work on tiny
objects and then zoom out and move around rooms, houses, or neighbor-
hoods from an Olympian perspective.
Panning is closely related to zooming. If you zoom in enough that some of your
drawing no longer shows up on-screen, you’re going to want to pan around —
move left, right, up, and down in your drawing — without zooming in and out.
AutoCAD makes panning easy with scroll bars and real-time panning.

Both panning and zooming change what is known as the view. The view is the
current location and magnification of the AutoCAD depiction of your drawing.
Each time you zoom or pan, you establish a new view. You can give a name to
a specific view to make returning to that view easy, as I demonstrate later in
this chapter.
Fortunately, zooming and panning in AutoCAD is as simple as it is necessary.
The following steps describe how to use AutoCAD’s Zoom and Pan Realtime
feature, which is easy to operate and provides a lot of flexibility:
1. Click the Zoom Realtime button (the one that looks a magnifying glass
with a plus/minus sign next to it) on the Standard toolbar.
The Realtime option of the Zoom command starts. The cursor changes
to a magnifying glass, and AutoCAD prompts you at the command line:
Press ESC or ENTER to exit, or right-click to display
shortcut menu.
2. Move the cursor near the middle of the screen, press and hold down
the left mouse button, and drag the cursor up and down until the
table almost fills the screen.
Dragging up increases the zoom magnification and dragging down
decreases it.
3. Right-click in the drawing area to display the Zoom/Pan Realtime
cursor menu, shown in Figure 7-1, and choose Pan from the menu that
appears.
The cursor changes to a hand.
4. Click and drag to pan the drawing in any direction.
You can use the right-click menu to toggle back and forth between Zoom
and Pan as many times as you like. If you get lost, choose Zoom Original
or Zoom Extents to return to a recognizable view.
5. Right-click in the drawing area and choose Exit.
The cursor returns to the normal AutoCAD crosshairs.

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

In the preceding example, you started with zooming and ended with panning.
You also have the option of doing the reverse: Click the Pan Realtime button
(the one showing a hand), and after you’ve panned, use the right-click menu
to switch to zooming. However you start it, the important thing to realize is
that Zoom and Pan Realtime is a single AutoCAD function. At any time, you
can switch between panning and zooming (or switch to a related function,
such as Zoom Window) by using the right-click menu.
You also can pan and zoom by using your mouse’s scroll wheel (if it has one)
or the middle button of a three-button mouse:
 To zoom in and out, roll the scroll wheel forward (in) or backward (out).
 To zoom to the extents of your drawing, double-click the scroll wheel or
the middle button.
 To pan, hold down the scroll wheel or the middle button as you move
the mouse.
The scroll wheel or middle mouse button zoom and pan operations described
in the preceding paragraph depend on an obscure AutoCAD system variable
named MBUTTONPAN. (See Chapter 2 for a description of what system vari-
ables are and how to change them.) When MBUTTONPAN is set to 1 — the
default value — you can use the middle button to pan and zoom, as I describe
in the preceding tip. If you change MBUTTONPAN to 0, clicking the middle
mouse button displays a cursor object snap menu, as it did in older AutoCAD
versions. If you’re not able to zoom or pan with your middle mouse button, set
MBUTTONPAN back to 1. (With MBUTTONPAN set to 1, you use Shift+right-
click to display the cursor object snap menu.)
Realtime zooming and panning is the easiest, most interactive way to get
around in your drawings. In some situations, though, this method is less effi-
cient or precise than the old-fashioned methods, the most important of
which are described in the next section.
Out of the frying pan . . .
Another way to pan in AutoCAD should be familiar from other Windows 
programs — the scroll bars in the drawing area. Scrolling is the same in
AutoCAD as in any other Windows program; click the arrows in the right and
bottom borders of the drawing window to scroll, or pan, a step at a time; or
click and drag the little square “thumbs” in those borders to pan as little or
as much as you want to.
Believe it or not, the realtime and scrollbar panning methods are relatively
recent enhancements in AutoCAD’s long history. These methods have pretty
much replaced the less-intuitive two-point method of panning in older ver-
sions of AutoCAD. If you want to see how Grandpa used to pan, enter –Pan
169
Chapter 7: A Zoom with a View

(with the leading dash) at the command line and then follow the prompts.
This older method remains useful in special situations where you need to pan
orthogonally by a specific distance — that is, move the display precisely hori-
zontally without wavering up and down or precisely vertically without waver-
ing side to side. This situation sometimes occurs in advanced paper space
viewport setup, which I don’t cover in this book.
Time to zoom
Because zooming is such a frequent necessity in AutoCAD, it’s worth knowing
some alternative ways of doing it.
The Zoom command has different options, the most important of which are
the following:
 All and Extents: Zoom Extents zooms out just far enough to show all the
objects in the current drawing. Zoom All does the same thing, unless the
drawings limits are larger than the extents, in which case Zoom All zooms
to show the entire rectangular area defined by the limits. If you’ve defined
your limits properly (see Chapter 3), Zoom All is a good way to see your
whole drawing area. These two options are especially useful when you
zoom in too small or pan off into empty space and want to see your entire
drawing again.
It’s a good idea to Zoom All or Zoom Extents and then save before you
close a drawing. By performing these steps, you ensure the following:
• The next person who opens the drawing — whether it’s you or
someone else — can see the full drawing from the very beginning.
• The drawing preview that displays in the Select File dialog box 
displays the full drawing, instead of just a tiny, unidentifiable
corner of it.
 Window: This option is great for zooming in quickly and precisely. It
zooms to a section of your drawing that you specify by clicking two
points. The two points define the diagonal of a window around the area
you want to look at. (Note that the Zoom command’s Window option is
not a click-and-drag operation — unlike in some other Windows pro-
grams and, confusingly, unlike in the Zoom/Pan realtime Zoom Window
option. With the Zoom command’s Window option, you click one corner,
release the mouse button, and then click the other corner.)
 Scale (X/XP): The X option zooms by a percentage of the current display;
values less than 1 cause you to zoom in, values greater than 1 cause you to
zoom out. You can also think of the value as a scaling factor: 0.5X causes
the screen image to shrink to half its apparent size, and 2X causes the
screen image to double its apparent size. (The XP option after a number is
for zooming model space objects in a viewport relative to paper space; see
Chapter 3 for information about paper space.)
170
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

 Realtime: Realtime zooming, the technique described previously,
enables you to zoom in and out by starting a realtime zoom and then
moving the cursor up to zoom in or down to zoom out.
 Previous: This option undoes the last zoom and/or pan sequence. It’s
like going back in time but without the funny costumes!
Some of the zoom options take some getting used to. I recommend that you 
use realtime zoom and pan for most of your zooming and panning. Supplement
it with Zoom Window to move quickly into a precise area, Zoom Previous to
back up in zoom/pan time, and Zoom All or Zoom Extents to view your whole
drawing.
A View by Any Other Name . . .
If you find yourself repeatedly zooming and panning to the same area, you
probably can get there faster with a named view. A named view is a name that
you assign to a particular region of your drawing. After you create a named
view, you can return to that region quickly by restoring the view. You use the
View command, which displays the View dialog box, to create and restore
named views. Follow these steps to create a named view:
1. Zoom and pan until you find the view that you want to assign a name to.
2. Choose View➪Named Views.
The View dialog box appears.
3. Click the New button.
The New View dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.
4. Type a name in the View Name text box.
5. (Optional) Type a new category in the View Category box, or select an
existing one from the drop-down list.
View Category is a new view property in AutoCAD 2005. You use it to
organize views and certain display characteristics of views in sheet sets,
as described in Chapter 14. Until you use the sheet sets feature, you can
leave this box blank.
6. Select the Current Display radio button, if it’s not selected already.
If you want to name a region other than the currently displayed view,
select the Define Window radio button instead, click the Define View
Window button to the right of it, and pick two corners of the region’s
rectangle (as though you were zooming windows).
171
Chapter 7: A Zoom with a View

7. Confirm or change the choices in the Settings area.
The Store Current Layer Settings with View option is new in AutoCAD
2005. If you leave this setting turned on, then when you later restore the
view, AutoCAD also will restore the layer visibility settings (on/off and
freeze/thaw) that were in effect when you created the view. (Chapter 4
describes the layer visibility settings.) The two UCS-related settings are
primarily for 3D drawings (see Chapter 8). If you’re creating 2D draw-
ings, you can ignore the UCS settings.
8. Click OK.
The New View dialog box disappears, and you see your new named view
in the list in the View dialog box.
9. Click OK.
The View dialog box disappears.
To restore a named view, choose View➪Named Views or enter View at the
command line to display the View dialog box. Click the name of the view that
you want to restore, click the Set Current button, and then click OK to close
the dialog box.
With the new Update Layers and Edit Boundaries buttons in the main View
dialog box, you can change the layer visibility settings that AutoCAD associ-
ates with an existing view and revise the view’s boundary.
You also can plot the area defined by a named view. See Chapter 12 for
instructions on plotting views.

Looking Around in Layout Land
All the zoom, pan, and view operations I describe in this chapter apply to paper
space layouts as well as to model space. (Chapter 3 describes the difference
between model space and paper space and how to navigate between the two.)
One little complication exists, though: In a paper space layout — that is, any
drawing area tab except for the Model tab — it’s possible for the cursor to be
either in paper space or in model space inside a viewport. Zooming and panning
have a different effect depending on which space your cursor is in at the
moment. Experiment with the different effects by following these steps:
1. Open a drawing that contains at least one paper space layout with a
title block and one or more viewports.
If you don’t have any such drawings handy, try using the AutoCAD sample
drawing \Program Files\AutoCAD 2005\Sample\Wilhome.dwg.
2. Click one of the layout tabs — that is, any tab other than the Model tab.
AutoCAD displays the paper space layout for that tab, including any title
block and viewports.
3. Click the PAPER/MODEL button on the status bar until it says PAPER.
Alternatively, you can double-click in the gray part of the drawing area
outside of the layout.
The cursor is now in paper space, so zooming and panning changes the
display of all the objects in the layout, including the title block.
4. Choose View➪Zoom➪All.
AutoCAD displays the entire layout, as shown in Figure 7-3.
5. Zoom and pan by using any of the techniques described in this chapter.
Zooming and panning change the appearance of the title block, as
shown in Figure 7-4. The effect is similar to moving a plotted sheet in
and out and all around in front of your face.
6. Choose View➪Zoom➪All.
AutoCAD displays the entire layout again.
7. Click the PAPER/MODEL button on the status bar until it says MODEL.
Alternatively, you can double-click with the cursor over a viewport.
The cursor is now in model space, inside the viewport, so zooming and
panning change only the display of the objects that are visible in the
viewport. The display of the title block doesn’t change.

8. Zoom and pan by using any of the techniques described in this chapter.
Zooming and panning don’t change the appearance of the title block, as
shown in Figure 7-5. The result looks as if you’re moving a picture of the
model space geometry in and out and all around behind a frame.
In real drawings, you usually shouldn’t zoom and pan inside viewports
after they’ve been set up (see Chapter 3). Doing so changes the scale of
the viewport, which messes up plotting. I’m asking you to do it here to
illustrate the difference between zooming in paper space and zooming in
a model space viewport.
If the title block is changing when you zoom and pan, someone has locked
the viewport to prevent the kind of mischief that I warn against in the pre-
vious paragraph. (You also see the command line prompt Viewport is
view-locked. Switching to Paper space.) See “viewports, floating,
locking” in the AutoCAD online help system if you need to lock — or
unlock — viewports.
9. Choose View➪Zoom➪Previous one or more times until you’ve
restored the original view.
10. Click the PAPER/MODEL button on the status bar until is says PAPER.
Always leave the cursor in paper space when you’re finished.

Chapter 7: A Zoom with a View

11. Choose File➪Close and click the No button to close the drawing with-
out saving changes.
In this example, I have you close the drawing without saving changes,
just in case you did mess up the viewport zoom scale.
In most cases, you set up a paper space layout once, as described in Chapter 3,
and then just return to it to plot. You shouldn’t be spending a lot of time zoom-
ing and panning in paper space layouts. You zoom and pan to get a better view
of what you’re drawing and editing, and that’s what the Model tab is for. But if
you do want to zoom in paper space — to get a better look at part of your title
block, for example — make sure that you’re doing it with the PAPER/MODEL
button set to PAPER.
AutoCAD 2005 includes new VPMAX and VPMIN commands for maximizing and
minimizing a viewport in the current layout. These commands provide an alter-
native to switching between the Model and Layout tabs without the potential
problems of zooming inside of paper space viewports. The easiest way to run
VPMAX or VPMIN is to click the new Maximize Viewport/Minimize Viewport
button located on the status bar, just to the right of the PAPER button.
Degenerating and Regenerating
As you zoom and pan around your drawing, you may wonder how the image
that you see on the screen is related to the DWG file that AutoCAD saves on
the hard disk. Well, maybe you don’t wonder about that, but I’m going to tell
you anyway!
When you draw and edit objects, AutoCAD stores all their geometrical prop-
erties (that is, location and size) in a highly precise form — technically,
double floating-point precision. The program always maintains that precision
when you save the DWG file. For computer performance reasons, however,
AutoCAD does not use that high-precision form of the data to display your
drawing on the screen. Instead, AutoCAD converts the highly precise num-
bers in the DWG file into slightly less precise integers in order to create the
view that you see on the screen.
The happy consequence of this conversion is that zooming, panning, and
other display changes are a lot faster than they would be otherwise. The
unhappy consequence is that the conversion, which is called a regeneration
(or regen for short), occasionally leaves you with some artifacts to deal with.
In most cases, AutoCAD performs regenerations automatically when it needs
to. You sometimes will see command line messages like Regenerating model
or Regenerating layout, which indicate that AutoCAD is taking care of
regens for you.
176
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

If, on the other hand, you see the command line message Regen queued,
then AutoCAD is warning you that it’s not performing a regeneration, even
though one might be advisable now. In addition, you might see a warning
dialog box with the message “About to regen — proceed?” These messages
are AutoCAD’s way of saying, “What your drawing looks like on the screen at
the moment may not exactly match the real version of the drawing database
that gets stored when you save the drawing. I’ll update the display version at
the next regeneration.”
The REGENAUTO system variable controls whether or not AutoCAD performs
most regenerations automatically (see Chapter 1 if you’re unfamiliar with
system variables or how to change them):
 The default REGENAUTO setting in new drawings, 1, tells AutoCAD to
regenerate your drawing automatically if it’s required to synchronize the
screen display with the drawing database.
 The other REGENAUTO setting, 0 (Off), tells AutoCAD not to regenerate
automatically, but instead to display Regen queued on the command
line and let you force a regeneration with the REgen command if you
want to.
The REGENAUTO off option is for the most part a holdover from much slower
computers and older versions of AutoCAD. You probably don’t need to sub-
ject yourself to the mental contortion of trying to avoid REgens unless you
work on huge drawings and/or use a painfully slow computer.
Don’t confuse the REgen command with the Redraw command. REgen
(View➪Regen) forces the synchronization process described in this section.
Redraw (View➪Redraw) simply repaints the screen, without attempting to
synchronize the screen with the drawing database. The Redraw command
was useful in the days of very slow computers and older versions of
AutoCAD, which didn’t handle the display as effectively, but it’s essentially a
useless command now.
The REgenAll command (View➪Regen All) regenerates all viewports in a
paper space layout. If you run the REgenAll command in model space, it has
the same effect as the ordinary REgen command.

F
or millennia, people have documented the design and construction of
three-dimensional objects by drawing two-dimensional views of them.
Most people have continued to use these “classical” methods with CAD
because the methods are well understood and work reasonably well. After all,
if 2D drawing was good enough for guys like Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea
Palladio, it should be good enough for us, right?
Nonetheless, there’s a growing trend of using CAD programs to create 3D
models and letting the CAD program generate the 2D views more-or-less auto-
matically. This approach seems more logical, especially if the documentation
requires numerous, complex views of the same object. 3D modeling also is a
virtual necessity (pun intended) when you want to create rendered (shaded)
views for presentation purposes.
The 3D construction and visualization tools in AutoCAD have improved dra-
matically over the years to support this 3D modeling approach to CAD, but
it’s still a complex process that requires sophistication on the part of the
CAD user. Although 3D modeling requires only one more dimension than 2D
drafting, developing 3D CAD models is considerably more complicated. Users
must master new techniques and contend with the 2D limitations of most dis-
play screens and input devices.
This chapter introduces you to the concepts, tools, and techniques for
AutoCAD 3D modeling and visualization. Be prepared to spend some additional
time wading around in the AutoCAD online help system and experimenting if
you want to become proficient at 3D modeling. And if 3D CAD makes you feel
a little wobbly at first, Figure 8-1 shows that you’re not alone.

Full 3D support is one of the main differentiators between full AutoCAD and
AutoCAD LT. If you’re using AutoCAD LT, you can look at and plot 3D models
created in AutoCAD, but you can’t do much 3D object creation or editing
yourself. Also, viewing 3D models is less flexible in AutoCAD LT because it
lacks AutoCAD’s 3DOrbit command.
Is 3D for Me?
The concept of 3D hardly seems to need introduction. We live in a three-
dimensional world, and most of the objects that you represent in your 2D
AutoCAD drawings are three-dimensional.
Traditional 2D drawings provide clues to help the viewer’s mind construct a
3D model from the 2D image on paper. Multiple views from different view-
points in 3D space give experienced designers, drafters, and builders the
information they need to make 3D sense of 2D drawings. Design and drafting
have succeeded pretty well by using 2D representations as the guide to creat-
ing 3D objects. But at some point, nothing can replace a true 3D model, such
as in helping someone understand how a building will look when constructed
or how two parts fit together.
What does using 3D in CAD mean? Fundamentally, it means creating models
instead of views. Rather than create cross sections of an object or individual
views of it from certain perspectives, you create a fully three-dimensional model
of the object. This 3D depiction of each object includes all the necessary
Figure 8-1:
Leaning
toward 3D.
180
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

information for AutoCAD to create a view from any point of view. With a prop-
erly constructed 3D model, AutoCAD can output commands to machines to
create actual 3D objects, whether plastic prototypes carved from a tank of
jelly by lasers or an actual bolt, valve, or piston created by computer-
controlled machine tools.
AutoCAD, like most 3D CAD programs, enables you to create three different
kinds of 3D models of objects:
 Wireframes: A wireframe model is like a skeleton of a 3D object; it
shows the edges of the object, not any of its surfaces. You create a set of
2D objects that represent an outline of each part of the object and then
connect them three-dimensionally to make the wireframe. It’s like build-
ing a model from wire coat hangers. One of the biggest limitations of
wireframe models is that you can’t shade them; there aren’t any surfaces
“inside” the wire edges to catch the light — imagine shining a flashlight
on a coat hanger.
 Surfaces: A surface model represents the “skin” of an object but not the
solid mass inside. AutoCAD uses objects called meshes to create sur-
faces. A mesh is a faceted surface that represents the edges and surfaces
of a 3D object. You also can create a surface mesh by sweeping a 2D
object such as a polyline around an axis. Creating a surface model is like
building a physical model out of thin sheets of balsa wood. A surface
model is one step up from a wireframe model because you can apply
material properties and shading to its surfaces.
Surface meshes are just the thing for some 3D modeling tasks, but they
have limitations:
• Some 3D objects are awkward to build by pasting surfaces together.
• You can’t check mass properties or interferences of a surface
model. (AutoCAD doesn’t recognize that there’s any solid mass
inside the surfaces.)
 Solids: A solid model is as close to true 3D as you can get without whip-
ping out some Play-Doh and building a real-world model yourself. You
build solid models by constructing basic 3D shapes and then combining
them — adding, subtracting, or finding their intersections — and modi-
fying them. It’s like using lots of fancy saws, drills, and glue to build a
model made out of wooden blocks. You can render a solid model, as well
as check mass properties and interferences.
In most practical applications of 3D, you select one type of representation —
wireframe, surface, or solid — for all or most of the objects in the drawing,
based on ease of construction and intended use of the model. However,
AutoCAD doesn’t prevent you from mixing all three types of 3D objects in the
same drawing.
181
Chapter 8: On a 3D Spree

After you determine the type of 3D representation to use, you decide on the
appropriate level of detail and construct the model, using the commands and
techniques introduced in this chapter. Finally, you create the required 2D
and/or rendered views for plotting or viewing on the screen.
You can do some experimentation with 3D on any computer system that can
run AutoCAD. If you want to pursue serious work in 3D AutoCAD, pay atten-
tion to the following prerequisites:
 Know AutoCAD well. You need to be pretty comfortable using AutoCAD
for 2D work before doing much with 3D. You should be able to control
object properties, use precision techniques, draw and edit 2D objects,
and zoom and pan — in other words, all the stuff covered in Chapters 4
through 7 of this book. If you aren’t comfortable with these techniques in
2D drafting, you’re likely to find 3D modeling in AutoCAD a real struggle.
 Get a fast computer. For beginning 3D work, any AutoCAD-adequate
system will do the job. For serious work with 3D models, you need a fast
computer, lots of memory, and lots of disk space.
182

3D thumbs up
Using 3D takes time to master, creates addi-
tional work, and slows down your computer.
Why bother using it? Here are four key reasons
why anyone in his or her right mind would bother
with 3D:
 It’s the wave of the future. As CAD pursues
greater realism and production efficiency,
3D is becoming important for more tasks in
more professions. Drafters and designers
who want to keep up with how CAD is likely
to be used in the future should become
familiar with 3D now.
 Sometimes it’s nice. Drawing in 3D is useful
for several tasks, including creating shaded
renderings to help sell a design to a client,
and fit-and-finish testing to find potential
problems before a design is put into con-
struction or manufacturing.
 Sometimes it’s needed. Drawing in 3D is
required for a small but growing number of
tasks. Many mechanical designs are done in
3D or converted into 3D at some point in the
design process. 3D perspective views make
drawings easier to understand. And the
shaded renderings used for both designing
and selling are becoming a practical neces-
sity in some fields.
 Sometimes it’s faster. The fastest way to
create a single view of something usually is
to draw that view in 2D. If you need multiple
views, it may be faster to create a 3D model
and then slice and render it as needed for
the views you want to create.

 Get and master additional software. In addition to AutoCAD, you may
need other programs — either AutoCAD add-ons or separate packages —
to do work that AutoCAD isn’t as good at. Specialized 3D modeling and
rendering programs are among the tools of the trade of most people who
do a lot of 3D work. Illustration packages can help you jazz up the
appearance of your drawing.
Many of Autodesk’s newer software products — AutoCAD-based ones
like Architectural Desktop and Mechanical Desktop and non-AutoCAD
ones like Revit and Inventor (see Chapter 1 for more information) — use
3D modeling as their fundamental approach to CAD. If you intend to use
3D on real projects, you’ll probably use 3D-centric programs such as
these, not plain AutoCAD. The information in this chapter will get you
started on the right track, especially if you eventually use one of the
AutoCAD-based applications.
 Do a real project. Real work is the best motivation for discovering 3D. If
you don’t have an actual work assignment, create a task. Something as
“simple” as creating a 3D model of your chair will make the difference
between really finding out something useful about 3D and just reading
about it in the manuals.

3D thumbs down
Consider these issues before you decide how
much to use 3D on a particular project:
 2D input and editing: The mouse, keyboard,
and drawing tablet are all 2D devices; the
more complex the 3D object you’re trying to
model, the more complicated it is to con-
struct the object with these devices. 
In addition, the AutoCAD 3D editing tools
are fairly limited in scope — especially 
for solids. For most heavy-duty 3D work, 
you need a third-party application, a disci-
pline-specific version of AutoCAD (such 
as Architectural Desktop), or a special-
purpose solid modeling program.
 2D output: Most of the currently available
output methods, notably paper and the
computer screen, are 2D. Presenting your
3D model in its full, three-dimensional glory
requires extra work by you or the viewer.
 Performance: Today’s personal computers
are adequate for the task of storing fairly
complex 2D models and displaying them on-
screen and on plots; if the model is 3D, the
difficulty increases geometrically, and per-
formance seems to slow geometrically as
well. You may need a faster computer and
more memory to meet these demands. You
may also find yourself taking longer coffee
breaks as you wait for your computer to
load or render complex 3D models.

Getting Your 3D Bearings
The first challenge in 3D modeling is being able to see your three-dimensional
model on a two-dimensional computer screen. The normal model space view
on the Model tab in the drawing area shows a single, projected 2D view of
your model — the top-down, “plan” view by default.
AutoCAD provides two model space capabilities that enable you to escape
this visual flatland:
 With viewports, you can carve the model space drawing area into smaller
rectangular areas, each of which shows a different view of the model.
 With viewpoints, you can change the point in 3D space from which you
look at the model. By setting a different viewpoint in each viewport, you
can look at several sides of your model at the same time. It’s like looking
at one of Picasso’s cubist paintings, only more orderly.
If you want to experiment with viewports and viewpoints in an existing 3D
drawing, try one of the AutoCAD2005 samples, such as \Program Files\
AutoCAD 2005\Sample\Welding Fixture Model.dwg. To remove shading
and make the model faster to work with, choose View➪Shade➪2D Wireframe.
Model space viewports left and right
Chapter 3 discusses viewports in paper space, which are useful for creating
layouts for use in plots and presentations in both 2D and 3D. Model space
viewports, cousins of paper viewports, are less powerful but simpler and are
intended to help you construct 3D models.
Model space viewports divide the screen into separate rectangles with no
gaps between them. Unlike with paper space viewports, you can’t move,
stretch, or overlap them. You can’t plot multiple model space viewports;
that’s what paper space is for. And, unlike in layouts, a layer that’s visible in
one model space viewport always is visible in all of them.
You may hear or read references to tiled viewports, which is just another name
for model space viewports. Tiled refers to the way in which model space view-
ports always fill the drawing area, with no gaps and no overlapping allowed.
Conversely, paper space viewports are sometimes called floating viewports
because you can move them around, leave gaps between them, and overlap
them.
Model space viewports enable you to see several views of your model at one
time, each from a different viewpoint. For this reason, model space viewports
are especially useful when you’re creating and editing objects in 3D. As you
draw and edit, the different views help ensure that you’re picking points that
are located correctly in 3D space.

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

To set up model space viewports, use the Viewports dialog box:
1. Choose View➪Viewports➪New Viewports.
The Viewports dialog box appears.
2. Choose one of the Standard Viewport arrangements and choose 3D in
the Setup drop-down list.
3. Click OK.
Figure 8-2 shows the dialog box and the model space result of choosing the
Four Right Standard Viewport arrangement and the 3D Setup. This arrange-
ment, along with the Four Equal, and Four Left standard viewport arrange-
ments, works well for creating viewports that show top, front, right, and
isometric views of a 3D model.
To return to a single viewport later, click in the one whose view you want to
use, then open the Viewports dialog box and choose Single in the Standard
Viewports list.
Seeing the world from new viewpoints
When you choose 3D in the Viewports dialog box’s Setup drop-down list, you
direct AutoCAD to change the viewpoint in each viewport. The default view-
points when you choose a four viewport arrangement are top, front, right,
and isometric. These viewpoints work well for viewing and constructing
simple models, but eventually, you’ll probably want to specify your own,
custom viewpoint in a particular viewport.

Chapter 8: On a 3D Spree

The easiest way to change viewpoints is to use the View➪3D Views submenu
(shown in Figure 8-3) to switch to one of the standard orthographic 3D views
or an isometric view:
 The six standard orthographic (straight-on) views are Top, Bottom, Left,
Right, Front, Back.
 The four standard isometric views are SW (left-front), SE (right-front), NE
(right-back), and NW (left-back). An isometric view is one in which you
see the object from above, but not too high above — as though you were
hovering in a low-flying helicopter.
These ten views are called standard because they’re often used in manual
drafting and rendering work. They work well for showing 3D models of
common objects such as mechanical components and buildings. (You can
also change to plan view, which is a top-down view of either the world coordi-
nate system or a user coordinate system. I describe coordinate systems in “A
Cartesian Orientation,” later in this chapter.)
You can specify nonstandard viewpoints by choosing View➪3D Views➪
Viewpoint Presets. In the Viewpoint Presets dialog box that appears, specify
the following settings:
 A viewing angle in the XY plane (imagine moving a camera on a dolly
around an object, while keeping the camera at the same elevation)
 An angle from the XY plane (imagine using a boom to swoop the camera
up to a different height so that you’re looking at the object from increas-
ingly steep angles)

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

By default, AutoCAD shows 3D models in 2D wireframe mode, even if you’ve
created surface or solid objects. If you want to better visualize which objects
are in front of which other objects, especially in an isometric or other non-
orthogonal view, you have a couple of options:
 Choose View➪Shade and then choose Hidden or any of the Shaded
options.
 Render the model, as described later in this chapter.
Dynamic viewpoints with 3DOrbit
Standard views and the Viewpoint Presets dialog box are fine for many 3D
construction tasks, but if you really want to have fun with a model, 3DOrbit is
your ticket to it.
AutoCAD LT doesn’t include the 3DOrbit command. In LT, you can use the
DDVPOINT and DView commands to look at a model from different points of
view.
The 3DOrbit command displays an arcball on the screen — a circle represent-
ing a sphere around your object. You click various places inside, outside, and
on the arcball and then drag to change the 3D view. The idea is that you’re
spinning the imaginary sphere containing your model. As you drag the
cursor, AutoCAD updates the screen dynamically.
3DOrbit provides many other options through its right-click shortcut menu.
You can change the shading mode and projection type, and you can turn on
several visual aids that help you understand where you are in 3D space.
Additional shortcut menu options enable you to pan, zoom, and restore stan-
dard or named views.
The following steps show some of the things that you can do with 3DOrbit:
1. If you’ve divided model space into two or more viewports, click in the
viewport in which you want to change the viewpoint.
2. Choose View➪3D Orbit.
The 3DOrbit arcball appears, as shown in Figure 8-4.
3. Move the cursor inside the arcball.
The 3DOrbit full orbit cursor appears: two oval arrows circling a sphere.
4. Click and drag, keeping the cursor inside the arcball.
You can rotate the model in all directions. Imagine that the cursor is
your finger pushing on a globe that rotates freely in all directions.
187
Chapter 8: On a 3D Spree

Pay attention to the shaded UCS (user coordinate system) icon at the
lower-left corner of the drawing area as you change the view. The UCS
icon helps you visualize how each orbiting operation works. (The next
section of this chapter tells more about UCSs.)
5. Release the mouse button and move the cursor outside the arcball.
The 3DOrbit roll cursor appears: a circular arrow circling a sphere.
6. Click and drag, keeping the cursor outside the arcball.
You can rotate the model around an axis at the center of the circle,
coming out of the screen. Imagine that you’re turning the steering wheel
on a car, with the steering column pointing into the screen.
7. Release the mouse button and move the cursor over one of the small
circles at the quadrant points (that is, 12 o’clock, 3 o’clock, 6 o’clock,
and 9 o’clock) of the arcball.
The 3DOrbit horizontal or vertical rotation cursor appears: an elliptical
arrow circling a sphere.

8. Click and drag away from the small circle.
You can rotate the model around a horizontal axis (if you clicked the
circle at 3 o’clock or 9 o’clock) or a vertical axis (if you clicked the circle
at 12 o’clock or 6 o’clock) passing through the little circle. Imagine that
you’re turning a piece of meat on a spit, with the spit located horizon-
tally or vertically in the plane of the screen.
9. Release the mouse button and right-click in the drawing area.
The 3DOrbit shortcut menu, shown in Figure 8-4, appears.
10. Experiment with the additional options, such as Shading Modes and
Projection.
Here’s the lowdown on some of these options:
• Gouraud Shaded usually looks more realistic than Flat Shaded.
• Hidden removes hidden lines but doesn’t shade.
• Wireframe is the default wireframe view, without hidden lines
removed.
• Parallel projection is the default AutoCAD projection — lines that
are parallel in the 3D object remain parallel in the projected view
on the screen.
• Perspective projection makes objects look more realistic (for
example, train tracks appear to converge in the distance), but lines
that are parallel in the model don’t remain parallel in perspective
projection.
If you manage to 3DOrbit out of control so that you no longer see your
model, right-click to display the 3DOrbit shortcut menu and choose
More➪Zoom Extents. The Zoom, Pan, and Preset Views options offer
other ways of getting your model back in your sights.
11. When you’re finished orbiting, right-click in the drawing area and
choose Exit.
Choose More➪Adjust Clipping Planes on the 3DOrbit right-click menu (or the
3DCLIP command outside of 3DOrbit) to slice away part of your model tem-
porarily to view what’s inside the surfaces or solid boundaries. See “clipping,
3D objects” in the AutoCAD online help for more information.
You can control the camera point and target point that 3DOrbit uses (the point
that you’re looking from and the point that you’re looking towards). Before
you start the 3DOrbit command, type CAMERA at the command prompt and
press Enter. Click or type the coordinates of the desired camera point target
points.
189
Chapter 8: On a 3D Spree

A Cartesian Orientation
Viewing your model from different viewpoints in multiple viewports is all well
and good, but unless your 3D spree is limited to looking at other people’s
models, you need to know how to specify points and distances in 3D. To do
that, you need to understand AutoCAD’s coordinate systems and conventions
for entering 3D points and distances.
Coordinate systems: The WCS and UCS
AutoCAD stores the locations of all the objects that you draw as 3D Cartesian
coordinates (X, Y, and Z) in the world coordinate system (or WCS). The WCS
defines the origin (0,0,0) point for the drawing and the orientation of the X, Y,
and Z axes. A particular point in the Cartesian coordinate system is defined
by its X, Y, and Z coordinates, where the coordinate indicates the distance
from the origin (0,0,0) point along the X, Y, or Z axis.
The WCS is the default XYZ coordinate system when you start a new drawing.
X is horizontal on the screen, Y is vertical on the screen, and Z extends out of
the screen, towards your face.
The X-Y plane (the set of points where Z = 0) is the construction plane in
which you create 2D objects. It’s also important for creating 3D objects,
because many commands operate with respect to the X-Y plane.
When you’re drawing and editing 3D objects, it’s often useful to be able to
move or rotate the construction plane. You do so in AutoCAD by defining a
user coordinate system (UCS). A UCS can have a different origin (0,0,0) point
and can have its X, Y, and Z axes point in different directions than they do in
the WCS.
Choose Tools➪Orthographic UCS➪Preset to run the UCSMAN command,
which opens the UCS dialog box, shown in Figure 8-5. This dialog box simpli-
fies the job of changing to common UCSs, such as Top, Front, and Right. The
Tools➪New UCS submenu runs the UCS command, which provides additional
options. Look up “UCS command” in AutoCAD’s online help to find out more
about UCSs and how to work with them.
To keep you informed about which coordinate system is current in each view-
port, AutoCAD displays a UCS (user coordinate system) icon in each view-
port by default. The icon looks like two or three little arrows (depending on
the viewpoint), each of which represents the direction of the positive X, Y, or
Z axis. This icon shows the working construction plane — the plane in which
AutoCAD places 2D objects when you draw them. Use the View➪Display➪UCS
Icon submenu to turn the icon off or on or to change its properties.
190
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Don’t confuse viewpoints and coordinate systems:
 The viewpoint controls what you see in a particular viewport, but doesn’t
control what you do to objects — that is, the viewpoint doesn’t dictate
the results of drawing and editing commands.
 The current coordinate system defines the construction plane in a par-
ticular viewport — that is, the UCS (or WCS) dictates how the points
that you specify during drawing and editing commands influence the
specific locations and orientations of objects. The UCS icon shows the
current coordinate system, not the current viewpoint.
Specifying coordinates in 3D
As I indicate in Chapter 4, you specify points in 2D drafting by typing a pair of
numbers in the format X,Y for absolute coordinates (with respect to the point
0,0) or @X,Y for relative coordinates (with respect to the previous point that
you specified). In both cases, you ignore the Z coordinate, but AutoCAD still
stores it — as zero.
When you create 3D models, you no longer can ignore the Z axis. You need to
worry about three coordinates for each point that you pick or type. AutoCAD
provides several ways of specifying 3D points. These are the most common:
 Typed coordinates: When you type coordinates, you simply add a Z
coordinate: X,Y,Z for absolute coordinates (with respect to the point 0,0,0)
or @X,Y,Z for relative coordinates.
There are 3D analogues to 2D polar coordinates (@distance<angle), too.
See “polar coordinates, entering, cylindrical” and “polar coordinates,
entering, spherical” in the AutoCAD online help.
Figure 8-5:
Get with the
UCSMAN.
191
Chapter 8: On a 3D Spree

 Object snaps: Happily, the object snap techniques described in Chapter
4 for picking precise locations on existing objects work equally well in
3D. You can object snap to endpoints, intersections, midpoints, and so
on, without having to worry about the current construction plane as
defined by the WCS or UCS.
In practice, you’ll have to be more careful when using object snaps in 3D
work. Remember that there are now three coordinates instead of two to
be precise about. If you’re viewing a 3D model from just one viewpoint,
it’s easy to osnap to a point that looks right in that view but in fact lies
“deeper” or “shallower” in 3D space that you realize. Thus it’s a good
idea to display your model from several different points of view, as
described in the “Getting Your 3D Bearings” section, earlier in this chap-
ter. The different points of view help you predict which location in 3D
space a given object snap mode will grab and make any object snap mis-
takes more obvious.
An additional object snap mode, Apparent Intersection, is useful when
you want to snap to the imaginary intersection of two objects that
appear on the screen to intersect, but don’t in fact intersect because
they lie in different planes.
 Coordinate filters: You’ll sometimes need to pick a point some of whose
coordinates (for example, the X and Y coordinates) match one object snap
point and some of whose coordinates (for example, the Z coordinate)
match another object snap point. Coordinate filters — also called point
filters — solve this problem handily. With coordinate filters, you use the
coordinates of points on existing objects to help specify new points. You
use coordinate filters together with object snaps to “build up” a point one
or two coordinates at a time. When AutoCAD prompts you to pick a point,
you activate a coordinate filter before you pick the point. The coordinate
filter tells AutoCAD which coordinates of the subsequent point to use.
You activate a coordinate filter by clicking one of the six choices on the
object snap cursor menu’s Point Filters submenu (shown in Figure 8-6):
.X, .Y, .Z, .XY, .YZ, or .XZ. (You display the object snap cursor menu by
pressing Shift+right-click; see Chapter 4 for more information.) For exam-
ple, if you select .XY and then pick a point, AutoCAD remembers only
the X and Y coordinates of that point. AutoCAD then prompts you to
pick another point and combines the Z coordinate of that second point
with the X and Y coordinates of the first point to determine the 3D loca-
tion of the new point. Look up “coordinate filters” in AutoCAD’s online
help for more information and an example.
At this point, you may be feeling less then completely 3D-coordinated,
despite the WCS, UCSs, and XYZs. All this stuff will become clearer after you
create some viewports and draw some objects. The next section gives you
some specific instructions, but don’t be afraid to experiment with typing
Cartesian coordinates, object snapping in 3D, and working with different pre-
defined UCSs. Or, you can console yourself with the following paragraph’s
geometrical trivia and vile pun.
192
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

In case you’re wondering, the Cartesian coordinate system is named after its
inventor, the French mathematician René Descartes. (Yes, he of “I think there-
fore I am” and the Monty Python Philosophers’ Drinking Song fame.) He did not,
however, invent the cart. The cart came earlier, and the horse came earlier
still. It’s for that reason that we know not to put Descartes before de horse.
Drawing in 3D
This section introduces four techniques for creating 3D objects: drawing 3D
lines and polylines, extruding 2D objects, creating surface meshes, and creat-
ing solids.
When you draw 3D objects, just like when you draw 2D objects, put them on
appropriate layers and use precision techniques to specify each point and
distance. See Chapter 4 for more information.
Drawing 3D lines and polylines
The most straightforward way to draw objects for a 3D wireframe model is to
use the Line or 3DPOLY (3D Polyline) command and specify 3D coordinates.
The 3DPOLY command is similar to the PLine (Polyline) command, which is
described in Chapter 5. Both commands draw a series of connected line seg-
ments, but they have different capabilities:
Figure 8-6:
The object
snap cursor
menu’s
Point Filters
submenu.
193
Chapter 8: On a 3D Spree

 The 3DPOLY command accepts 3D points for the line segments’ vertices.
The PLine command requires that all vertices be in the same plane.
 3DPOLY is limited to straight line segments. PLine can draw arc segments
and create segments with uniform or tapered width.
 Segments created with 3DPOLY can’t display dash-dot linetypes; 3D
polyline segments always display as continuous lines. 
The command sequence for drawing 3D segments with the Line or 3DPOLY
command is the same as for drawing 2D segments with the Line command;
see Chapter 5 for details. The only difference is that you specify 3D coordi-
nates instead of 2D ones. Figure 8-7 shows an example.
Creating 2D representations in this way is straightforward, though tedious for
all but the simplest objects. More important, a wireframe model becomes
increasingly difficult to decipher as the complexity of the model increases.
You see a mass of lines representing the edges, and you have difficulty telling
which parts of which edges are in front of others. To reduce this visual confu-
sion, you need to graduate to a surface or solid modeling commands, as
described earlier and in the subsequent sections of this chapter.
Extruding from 2D to 3D
One way to create a surface model is to extrude, or thicken, 2D objects. For
example, if you give thickness to a circle, it becomes a cylinder. If you give
thickness to a 2D polyline or a series of lines segments, it looks like a fence.
AutoCAD calls this depth thickness, which is not to be confused with other
characteristics that you may be tempted to call “thickness” — linewidths that
you add for plotting and uniform or tapered widths that you can add to poly-
line segments. Linewidths and polyline segment widths make objects fatter
but leave them in the 2D plane. Thickness pushes objects out of the plane,
giving them a new dimension.
Folks who do heavy-duty 3D modeling somewhat derisively refer to the result
of adding thickness to 2D objects as 21⁄2D — a bit more than 2D, but not quite
3D. That’s because extrusion is a limited 3D technique compared to creating
real surface meshes and solids, as described in the following two sections.
You can’t model most objects in a detailed way with extrusion alone. Imagine
a set of wooden blocks in which every block has a uniform thickness, with no
tapering allowed — kind of dull, huh? Even AutoCAD LT, despite its adver-
tised 3D limitations, can do extrusion (although only the simple kind of extru-
sion described in the following steps). Nonetheless, extrusion is a fun and
fairly low-stress way to get started with 3D, and it’s adequate for some simple
modeling tasks. It’s also a good warm-up exercise for full 3D solid extrusion,
which I describe later in this chapter.
194
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

The following steps show the general procedure for creating “21⁄2D” extruded
objects.
1. Define a suitable UCS (user coordinate system), as described earlier in
“Coordinate systems: The WCS and UCSs.”
The extrusion direction will be perpendicular to the UCS, so think about
the orientation of the 2D object and which way you want it to “pop out”
into 3D space.
2. Draw a 2D object.
See Chapter 5 for more information.
3. Open the Properties palette.
See Chapter 6 for more information.
4. Press Esc to make sure that no objects are selected.
5. Click the object to select it.
6. In the Thickness field, type an extrusion thickness and press Enter.
AutoCAD extrudes the object perpendicular to the UCS in which you cre-
ated it, as shown in Figure 8-8.
Figure 8-7:

195
Chapter 8: On a 3D Spree

If you extrude closed polylines and then shade or render them, the extruded
shapes appear hollow — that is, without any tops or bottoms on them. You
can work around this limitation by using the 3DFACE command to add three-
sided or four-sided surfaces as “lids.” You can build up irregular shapes by
using a combination of three-sided and four-sided faces. A better approach in
most cases is to use the EXTrude command, which creates a true solid out of
closed polylines and other closed shapes. (EXTrude requires AutoCAD — it’s
not included in AutoCAD LT.)
Meshing around with surface meshes
For surface models that are more complex than simple extrusions of 2D
objects, you can use a variety of AutoCAD commands that draw 3D meshes.
One set of commands draws surface model representations of 3D primitives:
box, pyramid, wedge, dome, sphere, cone, torus, dish, and mesh. (In this case,
the word primitive isn’t a pejorative. A 3D primitive is a relatively simple shape
that can be used alone or as a subcomponent of a more complex 3D object.)
To create these objects, choose Draw➪Surfaces➪3D Surfaces, select a primi-
tive shape from the image tile menu (shown in Figure 8-9), and follow the
command line prompts. It’s like constructing your own set of wooden blocks,
except that they don’t take up any space in your closet after you’re finished
playing with them!
Figure 8-8:
Just add

and voilà —
instant 3D!
(Or 21⁄2D,
anyway.)
196
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

The Surfaces submenu of the Draw menu includes commands for creating
complex 3D surfaces from 2D lines and curves. For example, with the Revolved
Surface menu choice (the REVSURF command), you revolve a set of 2D line and
arc segments around an axis of revolution to “sweep out” a 3D surface. But in
most cases, you’re better off using solid modeling commands such as REVolve
instead.
A solid(s) foundation
Solid modeling is in many ways the culmination of 3D CAD. Solids more accu-
rately represent most real-world objects than do wireframes or surfaces. And
even when representational accuracy isn’t the main issue, it’s easier to con-
struct many kinds of models with solids.
Solid modeling also places more serious demands on computer software and
hardware. It takes a sophisticated program and fast computer — not to mention
a capable human being running all this stuff — to create useful solid models.
That’s why solid modeling historically has lagged behind wireframe and surface
modeling and only recently become common on ordinary PCs. AutoCAD’s solid
modeling capabilities have improved steadily over the years, but most people
who do real solid modeling use AutoCAD add-on applications or separate,
stand-alone programs that have been created with this task in mind. Examples
include Inventor from Autodesk and SolidWorks from SolidWorks Corporation.

Chapter 8: On a 3D Spree

Many special-purpose solid modeling programs use a combination of solid and
surface modeling techniques for maximum flexibility in constructing and edit-
ing 3D models. These kinds of programs — and solid modeling in general —
are becoming especially popular in mechanical design.
Constructing the basic building blocks — or solid primitives — for a solid
model in AutoCAD isn’t difficult. As with wireframe and surface objects, you
follow these steps:
1. Define a suitable UCS (user coordinate system).
See “Coordinate systems: The WCS and UCSs,” earlier in this chapter. The
UCS controls the construction plane and basic 3D orientation of the solid.
2. Choose Draw➪Solids and then choose a solid from the top half of the
submenu.
As shown in Figure 8-10, your choices are Box, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone,
Wedge, and Torus. (These are similar to the surface mesh choices shown
in Figure 8-9. In this case, though, you’re creating solid instead of surface
versions.)
When you see a 3D object in a drawing, you can’t tell by looking whether it’s
a 2D extruded object, surface mesh, or solid. If you want to find out, open the
Properties palette and select the object. The drop-down list at the top of the
palette shows the type of object that you selected.
Figure 8-10:
Everything

198
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Constructing solid primitives is pretty simple and immediately gratifying. For
example, you can quickly put together a virtual cityscape by populating your
drawing with boxes, cylinders, cones, and wedges representing buildings. For
additional gratification, you’ll want to shade or render them (see the “Ending
with Rendering” section, later in this chapter). If you have any questions about
any of the 3D solid primitive commands, choose Contents➪User’s Guide➪
Create and Modify Objects➪Draw Geometric Objects➪Create 3D Objects➪
Create 3D Solids in the AutoCAD online help.
After the solid primitives, the next pair of commands on the Draw➪Solids
submenu is Extrude and Revolve:
 Extruding is similar to adding thickness (see “Extruding from 2D to 3D,”
earlier in this chapter) except that it creates true solids rather than “21⁄2D”
objects. In addition, you can specify tapers with the EXTrude command.
 Use the REVolve command to create a solid by rotating a closed object
around an axis.
The commands described in this section are the building blocks of solid mod-
eling. Developing useful 3D models takes a lot more than just knowing the
basics. You can model simple objects by using solid primitives, extrusion and
revolution, and the editing techniques discussed in the next section. But for
most real-world solid modeling work, you’ll want additional software and
learning resources.
Editing in three dimensions
When you’re ready to modify wireframes or surfaces, you can use most of the
editing commands described in Chapter 6. Grip editing also works well on
most wireframe and surface objects.
As with 3D drawing, you need to be a more careful when editing in 3D to make
sure that the editing transformations you apply occur correctly in all three
spatial dimensions. Display your model in multiple viewports from different
viewpoints so that you can see what’s going on and catch mistakes right away.
Modifying 3D solids is trickier. Simple editing commands like Move, CoPy, and
ROtate work fine, but most of the commands that alter an object’s shape (for
example, Stretch, Trim, and Break) don’t work on solids. You can use grips to
move and copy solids, but not to stretch them.
Instead, AutoCAD provides a set of specialized commands on the Modify➪

Ending with Rendering
To my mother, who grew up on a farm in Iowa, rendering was what you did to
fat to make it into lard. But in CAD, rendering is the process of illuminating a
set of 3D objects with one or more imaginary lights and then creating a more-
or-less realistic picture of the results. (No, computer programmers didn’t
have lard on their minds when they borrowed the word rendering. Hand-
drawn pictures of building facades were called renderings long before com-
puters got into the act.)
A single example of this technique is called a still rendering. Multiple frames
strung together produce computer animation. The objects that you see in
movies such as Toy Story or A Bug’s Life are first created as 3D models and
then rendered frame by frame — a process that can take immense amounts of
time even on ultrafast graphics workstations — to produce the beautifully,
well-rendered images you see.
AutoCAD creates still renderings only. If you want to create animations, you
need to use other software programs such as Discreet’s 3DS Max. Even if you
use animation programs, AutoCAD can be useful for developing the initial 3D
models.

Rendering has steadily improved in speed and usability as PCs have become
faster, and programmers have improved their rendering algorithms.
Rendering of simple scenes is now practical on a mainstream PC, and a fast
personal computer can create some impressive images in a reasonable
amount of time. Rendered images are useful for previewing how your models
will work in real life and also can be powerful tools for sales and marketing
communications for your company. A (rendered) picture can be worth quite
a bit more than a thousand words.
To see how rendering works with the default options in AutoCAD, use the
steps that follow. When you’re ready to get fancy, choose User’s Guide➪
Create Realistic Images and Graphics➪Render 3D Objects for Realism in the
AutoCAD online help system.
1. Create one or more 3D objects.
Use the steps in the previous section or use one of the sample 3D drawings
in \Program Files\AutoCAD 2005\Sample.
Unless you want a monochromatic rendering, create the objects on
several different layers that you’ve assigned different colors.
2. Choose View➪Render➪Render.
The Render dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-12.
Figure 8-12:
The Render
dialog box
and a

Chapter 8: On a 3D Spree

3. Ignore all the options and click the Render button.
You can get okay results without changing the options. When you click
Render, AutoCAD renders the 3D objects. See Figure 8-12 for an example.
To make rendered images look less cartoonish, you need to apply materials
to 3D objects and define different light sources. For more information, navi-
gate to the Render 3D Objects for Realism help page mentioned just before
the preceding steps and then look at Create Rendered Images➪Use Materials
in Rendering and Create Rendered Images➪Use Lights in Rendering.
The SHADE command offers a simpler alternative to the RENDER command,
without all the lighting, surface materials, and other options. To experiment
with shading, choose any of the options on the View➪Shade menu. (To return
to an unshaded view, choose View➪Shade➪2D Wireframe.) As I mention ear-
lier in this chapter, the 3DOrbit command’s right-click menu includes shaded
modes that you can see even while navigating around your model in real time.
In addition to viewing rendered and shaded views on the screen, you can plot
them, whether they’re in a paper space layout or in model space. Use the
Shaded Viewport Options area of the expanded Plot dialog box to control this
feature. Chapter 12 contains more information about plotting.
If you want to plot multiple rendered views (or a rendered view plus other
nonrendered views), create a paper space layout with multiple viewports, as
described in Chapter 3. As I mention earlier in this chapter, tiled model space
viewports are great for creating and viewing 3D models, but you can plot only
one model space viewport at a time. Use paper space layouts to compose
multiple viewports for plotting purposes.
People who do a lot of rendering and want higher quality, photorealistic
results usually use programs other than AutoCAD to render their models.
Discreet 3DS Max, Autodesk VIZ, and McNeel’s are three popular photorealis-
tic rendering programs. Most rendering programs can import 3D models from
AutoCAD DWG files, but some people use specialized 3D modeling programs
to do their modeling as well.

In this part . . .
T
ext, dimensions, and hatching have long been impor-
tant clarifying elements in drafting. In AutoCAD, these
elements are ﬂexible almost to a fault, and you can edit
and update them quickly as you change the geometry
beneath them. The text, dimension, and hatching annota-
tions that you add “speak” about the geometry so that
others can understand exactly what, how big, and how far. 
After you’ve made some drawings that talk, you’ll proba-
bly send the message around by printing — or as CAD
users call it, plotting — them. AutoCAD 2005 introduces a
redesigned, streamlined Plot dialog box, which makes the
often-complex task of plotting a little less daunting.
Chapter 12 in this section is your passport to navigating
the revised plot process, understanding how the legacy
of AutoCAD plotting inﬂuences current practice, and most
of all getting a good-looking, properly scaled plot onto
paper.

lthough it’s often true that “A picture is worth a thousand words,” it’s
also true that adding a few words to your drawing can save you from
having to draw a thousand lines and arcs. It’s a lot easier to write “Simpson
A35 framing clip” next to a simple, schematic representation of a clip than to
draw one in photorealistic detail and hope that the contractor can figure out
what it is!
Most CAD drawings include some text in the form of explanatory notes, objects
labels, and titles. This chapter demonstrates how to add text to drawings and
shows you how to take advantage of AutoCAD text styles and the spelling
checker. Chapter 10 covers text that’s connected with dimensions and leaders.
In most cases, adding text, dimensions, and other descriptive symbols is
something that you should do later in the drafting process, after you’ve
drawn at least some of the geometry. In CAD drawings, text and other annota-
tions usually are intended to complement the geometry, not to stand alone.
Thus, you generally need to have the geometry in place before you annotate
it. Many drafters find that it’s most efficient to draw as much geometry as
possible first, and then add text labels and dimensions to all the geometry at
the same time. In this way, you develop a rhythm with the text and dimen-
sioning commands, instead of bouncing back and forth between drawing
geometry and adding annotations. (It helps if you hum “I’ve got rhythm . . .”
while sliding the mouse back and forth in time.)

Getting Ready to Write
In AutoCAD, adding text to a drawing is only slightly more complicated than
adding it to a word processing document. Here are the steps:
1. Create a new AutoCAD text style, or select an existing style, that
includes the font and other text characteristics you want to use.
2. Make an appropriate text layer current.
3. Run one of these commands to draw text:
• mText draws paragraph (also called multiline) text.
• TEXT draws single-line text.
4. Specify the text alignment points, justification, and height.
5. Type the text.
You’re probably familiar with most of these steps already — especially if
you’ve ever used a word processor. In the next few sections of this chapter, I
review the particularities of AutoCAD text styles, the two kinds of AutoCAD
text, and ways of controlling height and justification.
Simply stylish text
AutoCAD assigns text properties to individual lines or paragraphs of text
based on text styles. These text styles are similar to the paragraph styles in
Microsoft Word: They contain font and other settings that determine the look
and feel of text. An AutoCAD text style includes
 The font
 A font height, which you can set or leave at 0 for later flexibility
 Special effects such as italic
 Really special effects such as vertical and upside down, which almost
nobody uses
Before you add text to a drawing, use the Text Style dialog box to select an
existing style or create a new one with settings that are appropriate to your
purpose. Your AutoCAD notes may generate strange responses (or no response
at all) if they appear in Old Persian Cuneiform or the Cyrillic alphabet.
Most drawings require very few text styles. You can create one style for all
notes, object labels, and annotations, and another one for special titles. A
title block may require one or two additional fonts, especially if you want to
mimic the font used in a company logo or project logo.
206
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

As with layers, your office may have its own text style standards. If so, you’ll
make everyone happy by following those standards. One of the best ways
to make your use of text styles efficient and consistent is to create them in
a template drawing that you use to start new drawings. (If your office is
well organized, it may already have a template drawing with the company-
approved styles defined in it.) See Chapter 3 for information about creating
and using templates. Another handy technique is to copy existing text styles
from one drawing to another by using the DesignCenter palette. See Chapter 4
for instructions.
Font follies
When you create a text style in AutoCAD, you have a choice of a huge number
of fonts. AutoCAD can use two different kinds of fonts: native AutoCAD SHX
(compiled SHape) fonts and Windows TTF (TrueType) fonts:
 SHX: In the Text Style dialog box, SHX font names appear with a drafting
compass to the left of the name. SHX fonts usually provide better perfor-
mance because they’re optimized for AutoCAD’s use.
 TTF: In the Text Style dialog box, TrueType font names appear with a TT
symbol to the left of name. TTF fonts give you more and fancier font
options, but they slow down AutoCAD when you zoom, pan, and select
and snap to objects. TrueType fonts also can cause greater complica-
tions when you exchange drawings with other AutoCAD users. Chapter
16 describes the special procedure that you need to use in order to
install custom TrueType fonts.
It’s okay to use a TrueType font sparingly for something like a title block logo,
but in general, you should stick with standard AutoCAD SHX fonts whenever
possible.
The most popular AutoCAD font is ROMANS.SHX (Roman Simplex). (You may
also run into SIMPLEX.SHX, an older version of Roman Simplex.) ROMANS.SHX
is a good, general-purpose font for drafting in AutoCAD. Avoid complicated,
thick fonts. They can slow down AutoCAD, and they’re usually more difficult
to read than the simpler fonts. Remember, you’re doing CAD here — not fancy
graphic design or reproduction of medieval manuscripts!
Whenever possible, avoid custom fonts, which are font files that don’t come
with AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT (both programs come with the same fonts).
AutoCAD installs its standard SHX fonts into the C:\Program Files\AutoCAD
2005\Fonts folder — as long as you haven’t added any custom fonts to that
folder, you can refer to it for a list of standard fonts. If you use a custom font,
exchanging your drawings with other people will be more complicated. If
you’re compelled to use a custom font, make a note of it and remember either
to send it whenever you send the DWG file (assuming that the font isn’t copy-
righted, which many custom fonts are) or to warn the recipients that the text
207
Chapter 9: Text with Character

will appear different on their systems. It’s far less hassle to eschew custom
fonts altogether. See Chapter 16 for additional information about how to deal
with fonts when you send and receive drawings.
Get in style
The following steps describe how to select an existing text style or create a new
one before you enter text into a drawing. (If you want to experiment with an
existing drawing that contains a variety of text styles, you can use \Program
Files\AutoCAD 2005\Sample\Hummer Elevation.dwg.)
1. Choose Format➪Text Style.
The Text Style dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-1.
2. In the Style Name drop-down list, select each style in turn to see what
text styles have been created in this drawing.
Note the font name and look at the Preview panel to get a feel for what
the different fonts look like.
3. If you find a suitable text style, select it in the Style Name drop-down
list and then skip to Step 9.
What constitutes a suitable text style depends on industry practices,
office standards, and personal preferences about how the text should
look. The information in preceding sections may help you decide. If not,
ask an experienced drafter in your office or look at some printed draw-
ings and try to match the text on those.
The selected text style name becomes the current style.
4. If you don’t find a suitable text style, or if you prefer to create your
own text style, click New.
The New Text Style dialog box appears, with an edit box for you to type
a name.
Figure 9-1:
Text with
style.
208
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

5. Type a name for your new text style and then click OK.
Your new text style is added to the Style Name list and becomes the
current style.
6. Choose a font from the Font Name list.
ROMANS.SHX is the best all-purpose font for most drafting work. If you’d
like to use a different font, review the font suggestions and warnings in
the previous section.
The font that you choose becomes the font that’s assigned to your new
text style.
7. Set the remaining text style settings as shown in Figure 9-1: Height =
0.0, Width Factor = 1.0, Oblique Angle = 0.0, and all four check boxes
unchecked.
A text style height of 0.0 makes the style variable height, which means
that you can specify the height separately for each single-line text object.
Assigning a fixed (that is, nonzero) height to a text style forces all single-
line text using the style to be the same height. Variable height styles are
more flexible, but fixed height styles usually make it easier to draw text
of consistent height. The decision to use variable height versus fixed
height styles is another aspect of text that depends on office practice,
so if you work with other AutoCAD users, ask around.
8. Click Apply.
9. Click Close.
The Text Style dialog box closes, and the text style that you selected or
created is now the current style for new text objects.
Taking your text to new heights
In Chapter 3, I describe the importance of choosing an appropriate drawing
scale when you set up a drawing. I warn you that you need to know the draw-
ing scale factor for tasks described in other chapters of this book. This is one
of those chapters, and I’m about to explain one of those tasks!
Drawing scale is the traditional way of describing a scale with an equal sign
or colon — for example 1⁄4” = 1’–0”, 1:20, or 2:1. The drawing scale factor repre-
sents the same relationship with a single number such as 48, 20, or 0.5. The
drawing scale factor is the multiplier that converts the first number in the
drawing scale into the second number.
One of the things that distinguishes knowledgeable CAD users is that they
always know the drawing scale factor of any drawing they’re working on.
Make it a point to determine the drawing scale factor of a drawing before you
add text to it.
209
Chapter 9: Text with Character

Plotted text height
Most industries have plotted text height standards. A plotted text height of 1⁄8
inch or 3 mm is common for notes. Some companies use slightly smaller
heights (for example, 3⁄32 inch or 2.5 mm) to squeeze more text into small
spaces.
Calculating AutoCAD text height
To calculate AutoCAD text height, you need to know the drawing scale factor,
the desired plotted text height, and the location of the multiplication button
on your calculator. Use the following steps to figure out text height:
1. Determine the drawing’s drawing scale factor.
If you set up the drawing, you should know its drawing scale, as
described in Chapter 3. If someone else set up the drawing, try the sug-
gestions in the sidebar, “Figuring out a drawing’s scale factor.”
210
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Attack of the giant text strings
“Why do I need to know the drawing scale
factor in order to draw text?,” you may ask —
especially if you’ve spent time “on the boards,”
as we grizzled old-timers like to call manual
drafting. You need to know the drawing scale
factor because you handle scaling of objects
and text in CAD opposite from the way you do in
manual drafting.
In manual drafting, you squeeze real-world
objects (the building, widget, or whatever) down
by a specific scale factor, like 10 or 48, so that
they fit nicely on a sheet of paper. Naturally,
you always draw text the size that you want it
to appear on the paper (for example, 1⁄8 inch 
or 3 mm high), regardless of the scale of the
drawing.
In CAD drafting, you draw objects as if they were
at their actual size. Then, when you plot, you
shrink — or, if you make drawings of tiny things
such as microprocessor circuitry, expand —
the entire drawing by that same scale factor (for
example, 10 or 48) to fit on the paper. When you
shrink the whole drawing to fit on the paper, text
shrinks, too. To avoid indecipherably small text,
or incredibly large text, you must create text at
a size that’s scaled appropriately by the draw-
ing scale factor. (If you’re an architect, imagine
that your text is neon lettering on the side of the
building. If you’re a mechanical designer, think
of a brand name stamped on the side of a screw.)
For example, assume that someone has drawn
a widget at a scale of 1:20 (corresponding to a
drawing scale factor of 20), and you want your
notes to appear 3 mm high when the drawing is
plotted to scale. You need to create text that’s
20 times 3 mm, or 60 mm, high. In a building plan
drawn at a scale of 1⁄4” = 1’–0” (drawing scale
factor equals 48), text that will appear 1⁄8 inch
when plotted needs to be 1⁄8 inch times 48, or 6
inches, high.
This “tiny text”/”enormous text” approach
seems peculiar at first, especially if you were
schooled in manual drafting. But it’s a conse-
quence of CAD’s ability to let you draw and
measure the geometry in real-world units. After
all, the geometry of what you’re representing,
not the ancillary notes, usually is the main point
of the drawing.

2. Determine the height that your notes should appear when you plot
the drawing to scale.
See the “Plotted text height” section for suggestions.
3. Multiply the numbers that you figured out in Steps 1 and 2.
Table 9-1 lists some common drawing scales and text heights for drawings in
imperial and metric units. You should know how to calculate the drawing
scale factors and text heights, but you’re allowed to use the table to check
your work. (Hint: Multiply the number in the second column by the number
in the third column to get the number in the fourth column!) The Cheat Sheet
tables include some additional drawing scales and text heights.

Figuring out a drawing’s scale factor
If you’re adding text to a drawing that someone
else created, you may not immediately know its
drawing scale factor. In some cases, making the
determination is trivial, whereas in other cases
it’s tricky indeed. Here are some methods you
can use:
 Ask the creator of the drawing.
 Look for text or a scale bar on the drawing
that indicates the scale.
 Use an architectural or engineering scale to
measure distances on the plotted drawing,
if you have one.
 Check the value of the DIMSCALE (DIMension
SCALE) system variable, as described in
Chapter 10.
None of these methods is infallible by itself, but
by comparing the evidence, you usually can
figure out the drawing scale factor with rea-
sonable certainty.

After you know the AutoCAD text height, you can use it to define the height of
a text style or of an individual text object. If you assign a nonzero height to a
text style (Step 7 in the “Get in style” section, earlier in this chapter), all
single-line text strings that you create with that style will use the fixed height.
If you leave the text style’s height set to zero, AutoCAD asks you for the text
height when you draw each single-line text object.
This discussion of text height assumes that you’re adding text in model
space, which is the most common practice. You may want to add text to a
paper space layout — for example, when you draw text in a title block or add
a set of sheet notes that doesn’t directly relate to the model space geometry.
When you create text in paper space, you specify the actual, plotted height,
instead of the scaled-up height.
One line or two?
For historical reasons (namely, because the AutoCAD text capabilities used
to be much more primitive than they are now), AutoCAD offers two different
kinds of text objects and two corresponding text-drawing commands. Table 9-2
explains the two options.
Table 9-2
The Two Kinds of AutoCAD Text
Text Object
Command
Comments
Paragraph text
mText
Designed for multiple lines, with word-wrapping.
AutoCAD keeps the multiple lines together as a
single object. Other special formatting, such as
hanging indents, is possible.
Single-line text
TEXT
Designed for creating single lines. Although you
can press Enter to create more than one line of
text, each line becomes a separate text object.
Although you may be inclined to ignore the older single-line text option, it’s
worth knowing how to use both kinds of text. The TEXT command is a bit
simpler than the mText command, so it’s still useful for entering short, single-
line pieces of text such as object labels and one-line notes. And it’s the com-
mand of choice for CAD comedians who want to document their one-liners!
Your text will be justified
Both the TEXT and mText commands offer a bewildering array of text justifica-
tion options — in other words, which way the text flows from the justification
point or points that you pick in the drawing. For most purposes, the default
212
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Left justification for single-line text or Top Left justification for paragraph text
works fine. Occasionally, you may want to use a different justification, such
as Centered for labels or titles. Both commands provide command-line
options for changing text justification. I point out these options when I
demonstrate the commands later in this chapter.
Using the Same Old Line
Despite its limitations, the TEXT command is useful for labels and other
short notes for which mText would be overkill. The following procedure
shows you how to enter text by using the AutoCAD TEXT command.
You can use TEXT for multiple lines of text: Just keep pressing Enter after you
type each line of text, and TEXT puts the new line below the previous one.
The problem is that TEXT creates each line of text as a separate object. If you
later want to add or remove words in the multiple lines, AutoCAD can’t do
any word-wrapping for you; you have to edit each line separately, cutting
words from one line and adding them to the adjacent line.
The AutoCAD 2005 TEXT command was called DTEXT (Dynamic TEXT) in
older versions of AutoCAD (Release 14 and earlier). You may hear AutoCAD
old-timers refer to the DTEXT command instead of TEXT. And you thought
they called it DTEXT because it wasn’t good enough to be A, B, or C text. . . .
The TEXT command does all of its prompting on the command line, so be
sure to read the command line prompts at each step along the way.
Here’s how you enter text with the TEXT command:
1. Set an appropriate layer current, as described in Chapter 4.
2. Set an appropriate text style current, as described in the section
“Simply stylish text,” earlier in this chapter.
3. Use the OSNAP button on the status bar to turn off running object
snap mode.
You usually don’t want to snap text to existing objects.
4. Choose Draw➪Text➪Single Line Text from the menu bar to start the
TEXT command.
The Text button on the Draw toolbar starts the multiline text command,
mText, which I cover in the next section.
AutoCAD tells you the current text style and height settings and prompts
you to select a starting point for the text, or to choose an option for
changing the text justification or current text style first:
Current text style: “Standard” Text height: 0.2000
Specify start point of text or [Justify/Style]:
213
Chapter 9: Text with Character

5. If you want to change justification from the default (lower left), type J,
press Enter, and choose one of the other justification options.
Look up “single-line text, aligning” in the online help system if you need
help with the justification options.
6. Specify the insertion point for the first text character.
You can enter the point’s coordinates from the command line, use the
mouse to click a point on-screen, or press Enter to locate new text imme-
diately below the most recent single-line text object that you created.
AutoCAD prompts you at the command line for the text height:
Specify height <0.2000>:
7. Specify the height for the text.
This prompt doesn’t appear if you’re using a text style with a fixed (that
is, nonzero) height. See “Simply stylish text,” earlier in this chapter, for
information about fixed versus variable text heights.
AutoCAD prompts you at the command line for the text rotation angle:
Specify rotation angle of text <0>:
8. Specify the text rotation angle by entering the rotation angle from the
command line and pressing Enter or by rotating the line on-screen
with the mouse.
AutoCAD prompts you at the command line to type the text:
Enter text:
9. Type the first line of text and press Enter.
10. Type additional lines of text, pressing Enter at the end of each line.
Figure 9-2 shows text appearing on-screen as you type it.
11. To complete the command, press Enter at the start of a blank line.
AutoCAD adds the new line text object — or objects, if you typed more
than one line — to the drawing.
To align lines of text exactly, make sure that you type in all the lines in one
invocation of the TEXT command, pressing Enter after each line to make the
next line appear just after it. Otherwise, aligning different lines of text pre-
cisely is harder to do (unless you set your snap just right or use a compli-
cated combination of object snaps and point filters).
To edit single-line text after you’ve created it, select the text, right-click, and
choose Text Edit. The Edit Text dialog box appears, enabling you to edit the
contents of the text string. If you want to edit other text properties, such as
text height, select the text, right-click, and choose Properties to display the
Properties palette. Use the Properties palette to change parameters as
needed.

Saying More in Multiline Text
When you just can’t shoehorn your creative genius into one or more one-line
pieces of text, the AutoCAD multiline text object gives you room to go on and
on and on. The following procedure shows you how to create text paragraphs
with the mText (multiline Text) command.
Making it with mText
The first part of the mText command prompts you for various points and
options on the command line. The order is a bit confusing, so read these
steps and the command line prompts carefully.
Here’s how you use the mText command:
1. Set an appropriate layer and text style current and turn off running
object snaps, as in Steps 1 through 3 in the previous section.
Figure 9-2:
Single-line
text.
215
Chapter 9: Text with Character

2. Click the Multiline Text button on the Draw toolbar.
The command line displays the current text style and height settings
and prompts you to select the first corner of an imaginary rectangle that
will determine the word-wrapping width for the text object:
Current text style:  “S-NOTES”  Text height:  0.125
Specify first corner:
3. Pick a point in the drawing.
The command line prompts you for the opposite corner of the text rec-
tangle that will determine the word-wrapping width and gives you the
option of changing settings first:
Specify opposite corner or [Height/Justify/Line
spacing/Rotation/Style/Width]:
4. Type H and press Enter to change the default text height.
The command line prompts you for a new default text height:
Specify height <0.2000>:
5. Type an appropriate text height.
See the “Taking your text to new heights” section, earlier in this chapter,
for information. If you’re adding text in model space, remember to use
the scaled AutoCAD text height, not the plotted text height.
The command line prompt for the opposite corner of the mText rectan-
gle reappears:
Specify opposite corner or [Height/Justify/Line
spacing/Rotation/Style/Width]:
6. If you want to change justification from the default (top left), type J,
press Enter, and choose one of the other justification options.
Look up “multiline text, aligning, Justify Multline Text” in the index of the
online help system if you want an explanation of the other justification
options.
7. Pick another point in the drawing.
Don’t worry about the height of the rectangle that you create by choos-
ing the second point; the width of the rectangle is all that matters.
AutoCAD adjusts the height of the text rectangle to accommodate the
number of lines of word-wrapped text. Don’t worry too much about the
width, either; you can adjust it later.
The Multiline Text Editor frameless window appears with the tab and
indent ruler above it and the Text Formatting toolbar above that, as
shown in Figure 9-3.

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

If you want to see multiline text at its final height as you type it, zoom to
a reasonable resolution before you start the mText command. If the text
would be very small (because you’re zoomed way out) or very large
(because you’re zoomed way in), AutoCAD temporarily adjusts the size
of the text in the frameless editor to show what you’re typing. When you
finish entering the text (as in Step 11), AutoCAD places it in the drawing
at the height that you specified.
8. Verify the text font and height.
The text font and height should be right if you correctly performed
Steps 1, 4, and 5. If not, you can change these settings in the Font drop-
down list and the Font Height edit box in the Text Formatting toolbar.
9. Type text into the text area of the dialog box.
AutoCAD word wraps multiline text automatically. If you want to force a
line break at a particular location, press Enter.
10. If you want other formatting, select text, right-click, and select the
appropriate option from the right-click menu (as in Figure 9-4).

11. Click OK in the Text Formatting toolbar (or press Ctrl+Enter).
The Multiline Text Editor window closes, and AutoCAD adds your text to
the drawing.
As you can tell by looking at the Text Formatting toolbar and multiline text
right-click menu, the mText command gives you plenty of other options. The
Text Formatting toolbar includes a Stack/Unstack button for fractions. The
right-click menu includes access to the Indents and Tabs feature, a Find and
Replace utility, tools for changing between lower- and uppercase, a special
Symbol submenu (including some new symbols in AutoCAD 2005), and an
Import Text option for importing text from a TXT (ASCII text) file or RTF (Rich
Text Format) file. If you think you may have a use for these additional features,
choose Contents➪Command Reference➪Commands➪M Commands➪MTEXT
in AutoCAD’s online help.
New mText might in AutoCAD 2005
AutoCAD 2005 adds two more options to the multiline text right-click menu:
Insert Field and Background Mask.
mText dons a mask
When you turn on background masking, AutoCAD hides the portions of any
objects that lie underneath the text. Use these steps to turn on and control
this feature:

218
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

1. Right-click in the Multiline Text Editor window and choose
Background Mask from the context menu.
2. Click the Use Background Mask check box so that this option is
turned on.
3. Either click Use Background (to make the mask the same color as the
drawing area’s background color) or choose a color from the drop-down
list (to make the text appear in a solid rectangle of the specified color).
4. Click OK to return to the Multiline Text Editor window.
If you’ve turned on background masking but it isn’t having the desired effect,
use the DRaworder or TEXTTOFRONT command to move text “on top of”
other objects.
mText plays the field
Insert Field creates a text field that updates automatically every time you
open, save, plot, or regenerate the drawing. These fields can contain data
such as the date, filename, or author. Fields draw information from the oper-
ating system settings, Drawing Properties dialog box, sheet sets feature, and
AutoCAD system variables (see Chapter 2). Use the following procedure to
add a field while you’re creating mtext:
1. Right-click in the Multiline Text Editor window and choose Insert
Field from the context menu.
2. Choose a Field Name in the left column.
3. Choose a Format in the right column, or, for date fields, type a format
in the Date Format box.
4. Click OK.
AutoCAD adds the field to the mText object that you’re creating or editing.
If you see four dashes instead of a valid field value, you probably need to do
one of the following things:
 Regenerate the drawing (see Chapter 7).
 Save the drawing.
 Fill in Drawing Properties dialog box values (see Chapter 3) and then
regenerate the drawing.
 Configure sheet sets (see Chapter 14).
Figure 9-5 shows fields and background masking in action.

Chapter 9: Text with Character

Keeping tabs (and indents) on your mText
Another advantage of mText is that it supports tabs and indents. This feature
is especially useful for creating hanging indents — the kind of indents that
push an entire paragraph to the right of a number or bullet, as shown in
Figure 9-5. (Before AutoCAD 2004, there was no straightforward way to per-
form this feat.) The procedure isn’t as straightforward as in most word pro-
cessing programs, but at least you can create numbered and bulleted lists
with hanging indents. Here’s how:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 8 in the preceding section, “Making it with
mText.”
2. In the tab and indent ruler, drag the lower slider (the triangle point-
ing up) to the right a small distance.
The lower slider controls the indentation of the second and subsequent
lines in each paragraph. (The upper slider controls the indentation of
the first line in each paragraph.) An indent of two to four of the short,
vertical tick marks usually works well.
3. Click in the ruler just above the lower slider.
A small L appears above the lower slider. The L shows the tab stop.
Figure 9-5:
mText plays
the field
and dons
a mask.
220
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Make sure that the corner of the L aligns horizontally with the point of
the lower slider triangle. If not, click and drag the L until it aligns.
4. Type a number followed by a period or parenthesis (for example, 1.)
or a character that represents a bullet (for example, *).
5. Press the Tab key.
The cursor jumps to the tab stop that you added in Step 3.
6. Type the text corresponding to the current number or bullet.
As AutoCAD wraps the text, the second and subsequent lines align with
the beginning of the text in the first line, as in Figure 9-6.
7. Press Enter to finish the current numbered or bulleted item.
8. Press Enter again if you want to leave a blank line between numbered
or bulleted items.

221
Chapter 9: Text with Character

9. Repeat Steps 4 through 8 for each subsequent numbered or bulleted
item.
If you find that your indents aren’t quite the right size, select all the text
and adjust the lower slider and tab stop.
10. Resume with Step 9 in the section, “Making it with mText.”
If you prefer to type tab and indent distances, not adjust them with the
cursor, use the Indents and Tabs choice on the mText right-click menu.
Whichever way you do it, if you select text first, the tab and indent changes
apply to the selected text. If you don’t select text first, the changes apply to
new text from that point in the multiline text object forward.
The AutoCAD text commands are designed for the kinds of text that most
people add to drawings: short, single-line notes or longer blocks of a para-
graph or two. If you want sophisticated formatting or long stretches of text,
you’re likely to bump up against the fact that AutoCAD lacks the capabilities
of even the most basic word processing programs. If you’re contemplating
adding pages of text or fancy text formatting to a drawing, consider putting
the text in a separate word processing document instead. If you absolutely
must place the text from a long document on a drawing (on a general notes
sheet, for example), you’ll have to break it up into several columns, each of
which is a separate mText object. Get the text right in a word processor first
and then copy and paste it into AutoCAD.
If you’re tempted to circumvent my warning by pasting a word processing
document directly into an AutoCAD drawing, please read Chapter 17 first.
Modifying mText
After you create a multiline text object, you edit it like a single-line text
object: Select the object, right-click, and choose Mtext Edit or Properties.
 The Mtext Edit option opens the Multiline Text Editor window so that
you can change the text contents and formatting.
 The Properties option opens the Properties palette, where you can
change overall properties for the text object.
The easiest way to change the word-wrapping width of a paragraph text object
is to grip edit it. Select the text object, click one of the corner grips, release the
mouse button, move the cursor, and click again. Chapter 6 describes grip
editing in detail.
AutoCAD includes two text modification commands that may be useful to
you when you become an AutoCAD textpert. SCALETEXT scales a group of
text objects, similar to the SCale command. The difference is that SCALETEXT
scales each text object around its own base point, whereas SCale uses a single
222
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

base point for scaling all objects. SCALETEXT is especially useful when you
have to change the scale of a drawing. JUSTIFYTEXT changes the justification
of one or more text strings without causing the text to move. Both of these
commands are available on the Modify➪Object➪Text submenu.
Setting the Text Table
My vote for the best new feature in AutoCAD 2005 without a doubt goes to
tables. You don’t know the meaning of the word “tedious” unless you’ve tried
to create a column-and-row data table in previous versions of AutoCAD with
the Line and TEXT commands. AutoCAD 2005’s new table object and the
TableStyle and TaBle commands for creating it make the job almost fun.
Tables have style, too
You control the appearance of tables — both the text and the gridlines —
with table styles (just as you control the appearance of stand-alone text with
text styles). Use the TableStyle command to create and modify table styles.
Follow these steps to create a table:
1. Choose Format➪Table Style.
The Table Style dialog box appears.
2. In the Styles list, select the existing table style whose settings you
want to use as the starting point for the settings of your new style.
For example, select the default table style named Standard.
3. Click the New button to create a new table style that’s a copy of the
existing style.
The Create New Table Style dialog box appears.
4. Enter a New Style Name and click Continue.
The New Table Style dialog box appears as shown in Figure 9-7.
5. On the Data tab, specify settings for the data text and gridlines (that
is, for all cells except the column heads and the table title).
The settings you are likely to want to change are Text Style, Text Height,
and perhaps either Text Color or Grid Color. (If you leave colors set to
ByBlock, then the text and grid lines will inherit the color that’s current
when you create the table. That color will be the current layer’s color, if
you follow my advice in the “Accumulating properties” section of
Chapter 4.)
223
Chapter 9: Text with Character

6. Repeat Step 5 for the Column Heads tab and the Title tab.
7. Click OK to close the New Table Style dialog box.
The Table Style dialog box reappears.
8. (Optional) Select your new table style from the Styles list, and then
click Set Current.
Your new table style becomes the current table style that AutoCAD uses
for future tables in this drawing.
9. Click Close.
The Table Style dialog box closes. Now you’re ready to create a table, as
described in the next section.
AutoCAD stores table styles in the DWG file, so a style that you create in one
drawing isn’t immediately available in others. You can copy a table style from
one drawing to another with DesignCenter. (Use the “Borrowing existing
dimension styles” procedure in Chapter 10, but substitute Table Styles for
DimStyles.)
Creating and editing tables
After you create a suitable table style, adding a table to your drawing is easy
with the TaBle command. Here’s how:
Figure 9-7:
Setting the
table.
224
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

1. Set an appropriate layer current.
Assuming that you leave the current color, linetype, and lineweight set
to ByLayer, as I recommend in Chapter 4, the current layer’s properties
will control the properties of any parts of the table that you left set to
ByBlock when you defined the table style. (See Step 5 in the “Tables
have style, too” section.)
2. Choose Draw➪Table.
The Insert Table dialog box appears.
3. Choose a table style from the Table Style Name drop-down list.
4. Choose an Insertion Behavior.
Specify Insertion Point is the easiest method and means that you’ll pick
the location of the table’s upper-left corner (or lower-left corner if you
set Table Direction to Up in the table style). With this method, you spec-
ify the default column width and number of rows in the Insert Table
dialog box.
Specify Window means that you’ll pick the upper-left corner and then
the lower-right corner. With this method, AutoCAD automatically scales
the column widths and determines how many rows to include. 
5. Specify Column & Row Settings.
If you chose Specify Window in Step 4, AutoCAD sets the Column Width
and number of Data Rows to Auto, which means that AutoCAD will figure
them out based on the overall size of the table that you specify in Steps
7 and 8.
6. Click OK.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify the insertion point of the table.
7. Click a point or type cooordinates.
If you chose Specify Insertion Point in Step 4, AutoCAD draws the table
grid lines, places the cursor in the title cell, and displays the Text
Formatting toolbar.
8. If you chose Specify Window in Step 4, specify the diagonally opposite
corner of the table.
AutoCAD draws the table. Based on the table size that you indicated,
AutoCAD chooses the column width and number of rows.
9. Type a title for the table.
10. Press the arrow keys or tab key to move among cells, and type values
in each cell.
The cell right-click menu offers many other options, including copying
contents from one cell to another, merging cells, inserting rows and
columns, changing formatting, and inserting a block (that is, a graphical
symbol — see Chapter 13 for information about blocks).
225
Chapter 9: Text with Character

The new AutoCAD 2005 fields feature described earlier in this chapter
works for table text, too — you can insert a field into a table cell. For
example, you might use this feature to create part of a title block, with
fields serving as the “date” and “drawn by” data.
11. Click OK on the Text Formatting toolbar.
Figure 9-8 shows a completed table, along with the Insert Table dialog box.
You can edit cell values later simply by double-clicking in a cell. To change
column width or row height, click on the table grid and then click and move
the blue grips. (To change the width of one column without altering the over-
all width of the table, hold down the Ctrl key while you move the grip.) If you
want to change other aspects of a table or individual cells in it, select the
table or cell and use the Properties palette to make changes.
You can import tables from Microsoft Excel instead of using the Insert Table
dialog box. To import Excel data, select the desired cells and choose Edit➪
Copy in Excel. Then in AutoCAD, choose Edit➪Paste Special and choose
AutoCAD Entities in the Paste Special dialog box. AutoCAD attempts to copy
the Excel spreadsheet’s formatting along with the cell data, but you’ll proba-
bly have to adjust column widths and perform other cleanup on the imported
table.

in AutoCAD’s online help.
Checking Out Your Spelling
AutoCAD, like almost every other computer program on this planet — and
possibly on other planets and moons in our solar system — has a spelling
checker.
Unlike Microsoft Word, AutoCAD’s spelling checker doesn’t make those little
red squiggles under your errors, but it does let you search for spelling errors
in most of the text objects in your drawing. This feature checks single-line
text, paragraph text, and attribute text (described in Chapter 13), but not
dimension text (described in Chapter 10). The following procedure demon-
strates how to use the spell checker:
1. Press the Esc key to unselect any selected objects.
2. Choose Tools➪Spelling to start the SPell command.
This is text spell-checking, not casting a spell. (That’s the EYEOFNEWT
command.) The command line prompts you to select objects.
3. Select the objects you want to check.
You can use any of the standard AutoCAD object selection methods to
select text to check. (See Chapter 6 if you’re unfamiliar with object selec-
tion.) Type ALL and press Enter if you want to check the spelling of all
text in the drawing. Don’t worry if you select objects other than text; the
spelling checker ignores any objects that aren’t text. When you’re fin-
ished selecting objects, press Enter to start the spelling check.
If a misspelling is found, the Check Spelling dialog box appears with the
first misspelled or unrecognized word. Figure 9-9 shows an example.
4. Click the dialog box buttons to tell AutoCAD how to handle a 
misspelling.
You probably know which buttons to click from having used other
spelling checkers. If not, use the dialog box help to find out: Click the
question mark on the Check Spelling dialog box’s title bar, and then click
the button that you want to know more about.
AutoCAD continues with spell-checking until it has checked all the
selected text objects. When it finds no further misspellings, the dialog
box disappears, and the Spelling check complete alert appears.
227
Chapter 9: Text with Character

Every industry has its own abbreviations and specialized vocabulary. At first,
AutoCAD complains about perfectly good words (from a drafter’s point of
view) such as thru and S.A.D. (which stands for See Architectural Drawing).
Be prepared to click the Add button frequently during the first few weeks to
tell AutoCAD which words and abbreviations are acceptable in your industry
and office. If you’re patient with it, AutoCAD, like an errant puppy, will gradu-
ally become more obedient. Then you’ll be thru feeling S.A.D.

n drafting — either CAD or manual drafting — dimensions are special text
labels with attached lines that together indicate unambiguously the size of
something. Although it’s theoretically possible to draw all the pieces of each
dimension by using AutoCAD commands such as Line and mText, dimension-
ing is so common a drafting task that AutoCAD provides special commands
for doing the job more efficiently. These dimensioning commands group the
parts of each dimension into a convenient, easy-to-edit package. Even better,
as you edit an object — by stretching it for example — AutoCAD automati-
cally updates the measurement displayed in the dimension text label to indi-
cate the object’s new size, as shown in Figure 10-1.
AutoCAD controls the look of dimensions by means of dimension styles, just as
it controls the look of text with text styles. (AutoCAD also uses text styles to
control the appearance of the text in dimensions.) But dimension styles are
much more complicated than text styles, because dimensions have so many
more pieces that you need to control. After you find or create an appropriate
dimension style, you use one of several dimensioning commands to draw
dimensions that point to the important points on an object (the two endpoints
of a line, for example).
AutoCAD dimensioning is a big, complicated subject. (It’s so complicated, in
fact, that Autodesk has an especially wise person in charge of dimensioning in
AutoCAD — this person is called the “DimWit.”) Every industry has its own
dimensioning conventions, habits, and quirks. As usual, AutoCAD tries to sup-
port them all and, in so doing, makes things a bit convoluted for everyone. This
chapter covers the essential concepts and commands that you need to know
to start drawing dimensions. Be prepared to spend some additional time study-
ing how to create any specialized types of dimensions that your industry uses.

You may be able to avoid getting too deeply into the details of dimensioning
just by copying dimension styles from existing drawings in your office. (I show
you how later in this chapter.) This may also be a good time to get some advice
and coaching from the AutoCAD geek in the cubicle across from yours.
You add dimensions to a drawing after you’ve drawn at least some of the
geometry; otherwise, you won’t have much to dimension! Your dimensioning
and overall drafting efficiency improve if you add dimensions in batches,
rather than draw a line, draw a dimension, draw another line, draw another
dimension. . . .

Why dimensions in CAD?
You may think that CAD would have rendered
text dimensions obsolete. After all, you comply
with all my suggestions about using AutoCAD
precision techniques when you draw and edit,
and you’re careful to draw each object at its
true size, right? The contractor or machinist can
just use AutoCAD to query distances and angles
in the CAD DWG file, right? Sorry, but no (to the
last question, anyway). Here are a few reasons
why the traditional dimensioning that CAD draft-
ing has inherited from manual drafting is likely
to be around for a while:
 Some people need to or want to use paper
drawings when they build something. We’re
still some time away from the day when 

Discovering New Dimensions
Before digging into the techniques that you use to create dimension styles
and dimensions, I review some AutoCAD dimensioning terminology. If you’re
already familiar with CAD dimensioning lingo, just skim this section and look
at the figures in it. Otherwise, read on.
Anatomy of a dimension
AutoCAD uses the names shown in Figure 10-2 and described in the following
list to refer to the parts of each dimension:
 Dimension text: Dimension text usually is the number that indicates the
actual distance or angle. Dimension text can also include other text
information in addition to or instead of the number. For example, you
can add a suffix such as TYP. to indicate that a dimension is typical of
several similar configurations, or you can insert a description such as
See Detail 3/A2.
 Dimension lines: The dimension lines go from the dimension text out-
ward (parallel to the direction of the object being measured), to indicate
the extent of the dimensioned length. AutoCAD’s default dimension style
settings center the dimension text vertically and horizontally on the
dimension lines (see Figure 10-2), but you can change those settings to
231
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions
contractors haul computers around in their
tool belts (never mind mousing around a
drawing while hanging from scaffolding).
 In many industries, paper drawings still rule
legally. Your company may supply both plot-
ted drawings and DWG files to clients, but
your contracts probably specify that the plot-
ted drawings govern in the case of any dis-
crepancy. The contracts probably also warn
against relying on any distances that the
recipient of the drawings measures — using
measuring commands in the CAD DWG file
or a scale on the plotted drawing. The text
dimensions are supposed to supply all the
dimensional information that’s needed to
construct the object.
 Dimensions sometimes carry additional
information besides the basic length or
angle. For example, dimension text can indi-
cate the allowable construction tolerances or
show that a particular distance is typical of
similar situations elsewhere on the drawing.
 Even conscientious CAD drafters rarely
draw every object its true size. Drafters
sometimes exaggerate distances for graph-
ical clarity. For example, they might draw a
small object larger than its true size so that
it shows up clearly on a scaled plot. In addi-
tion, drafters sometimes settle for approxi-
mate distances because time pressures
(especially late in a project) make it difficult
to be completely accurate.
So remember the old rule of drafting prowess:
“It’s not the size of the drawn object that mat-
ters, but the dimensions that are on it.”

cause the text to appear in a different location — riding above an unbro-
ken dimension line as shown in Figure 10-1, for example. See the section
“Adjusting style settings,” later in this chapter, for instructions.
 Dimension arrowheads: The dimension arrowheads appear at the ends 
of the dimension lines and clarify the extent of the dimensioned length.
AutoCAD’s default arrowhead style is the closed, filled type shown in
Figure 10-2, but you can choose other symbols, such as tick marks, to indi-
cate the ends of the dimension lines. (Don’t get ticked off, but AutoCAD
calls the line ending an arrowhead even when, as in the case of a tick
mark, it doesn’t look like an arrow.)
 Extension lines: The extension lines extend outward from the extension
line origin points that you select (usually by snapping to points on an
object) to the dimension lines. By drafting convention, a small gap usu-
ally exists between the extension line origin points and the beginning of
the extension lines. The extension lines usually extend just beyond
where they meet the dimension lines.
A field guide to dimensions
AutoCAD provides several types of dimensions and commands for drawing
them. Figure 10-3 shows the most common types, and the following list
describes them:
 Linear dimensions: A linear dimension measures the linear extent of an
object or the linear distance between objects. Most linear dimensions
are either horizontal or vertical, but you can draw dimensions that are
rotated to other angles, too. An aligned dimension is similar to a linear
dimension, but the dimension line tilts to the same angle as a line drawn
through the origin points of its extension lines.

232
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

 Radial dimensions: A radius dimension calls out the radius of a circle or
arc, and a diameter dimension calls out the diameter of a circle or arc.
You can position the dimension text inside or outside the curve, as
shown in Figure 10-3. If you position the text outside the curve, AutoCAD
by default draws a little cross at the center of the circle or arc.
 Angular dimensions: An angular dimension calls out the angular mea-
surement between two lines, the two endpoints of an arc, or two points
on a circle. The dimension line appears as an arc that indicates the
sweep of the measured angle.
Other types of AutoCAD dimensions include ordinate, tolerance, center mark,
and leader dimensions. See the “Pointy-Headed Leaders” section at the end of
this chapter for instructions on how to draw leaders. Look up “dimensions,
creating” on the Index tab in the AutoCAD online help system for more infor-
mation about other kinds of dimensions.
Dimension associativity
By default, AutoCAD groups all the parts of each dimension — the extension
lines, dimension lines, arrowheads, and text — into a special associative
dimension object. Associative means two things:
 The different parts of the dimension function as a single object. When
you click any part of the dimension, AutoCAD selects all of its parts.
 The dimension is connected with the points on the object that you spec-
ified when you drew the dimension. If you change the size of the object

Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

(for example, stretch a line), the dimension updates appropriately — the
lines and arrows move, and the text changes to reflect the line’s new
size.
I call dimensions with both of these characteristics geometry-driven 
associative dimensions, because the geometry “drives” the location of the
parts of the dimension and what the text says.
For historical reasons, AutoCAD also is capable of creating dimensions that
possess just the first type of associativity — that is, the dimension functions as
a single, grouped object but isn’t directly connected with the object whose size
it shows. Autodesk now calls these kinds of dimensions nonassociative, which
is pretty confusing to AutoCAD veterans, because AutoCAD used to call them
associative! AutoCAD also is capable of creating dimensions that possess no
type of associativity at all — no grouping of the bits and pieces and no connec-
tion to the dimensioned object. Autodesk now calls these exploded dimensions,
but before AutoCAD 2002, they were called nonassociative!
I mention the conflicting use of associative and nonassociative in case you
find yourself discussing dimensions with AutoCAD veterans, most of whom
will use the terms in their older sense. To avoid confusion, I always use the
term geometry-driven associative dimensions (or simply geometry-driven
dimensions) in this book to refer to dimensions that possess both types of
associativity. For more information about how to determine which kind of
dimension AutoCAD draws, see “Controlling and editing dimension associa-
tivity,” later in this chapter.
Pulling out your dimension tools
The AutoCAD Dimension menu provides access to dimensioning commands. If
you find yourself adding dimensions in batches, the Dimension toolbar is more
efficient because it makes the dimensioning commands more accessible. You
toggle the Dimension toolbar off and on by right-clicking any AutoCAD toolbar
icon and choosing Dimension from the cursor menu. As with other toolbars,
you can move the Dimension toolbar to a different location on the screen or
dock it on any margin of the drawing area.
All dimensioning commands have long command names (such as DIMLINEAR
and DIMRADIUS) and corresponding shortened abbreviations (DLI and DRA)
that you can type at the command prompt. If you do lots of dimensioning and
don’t want to toggle the Dimension toolbar on and off repeatedly, memorize
the abbreviated forms of the dimension commands that you use frequently.
You’ll find a list of the long command names on the Contents tab in the
AutoCAD online help system. Choose Command Reference➪Commands➪
D Commands. The short names are the first, fourth, and fifth letters of the
long names. (In other words, take the first five letters of the long name and
remove IM.)
234
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Doing Dimensions with Style(s)
Creating a usable dimension style that gives you the dimension look you want
is the biggest challenge in using AutoCAD’s dimensioning features. Each draw-
ing contains its own dimension styles, so changes you make to a dimension
style in one drawing affect only that drawing. However, after you get the dimen-
sion styles right in a drawing, you can use it as a template or starting point for
later drawings.
A dimension style is a collection of drawing settings called dimension variables,
which are a special class of the system variables that I introduce in Chapter 2.
If you want to see a list of the dimension variable names and look up what each
variable controls, see Contents➪Command Reference➪System Variables➪
D System Variables in the AutoCAD online help system. All the system variables
that begin with DIM are dimension variables.
AutoCAD users, like all computer nerds, like to shorten names. You may hear
them refer to dimstyles and dimvars instead of dimension styles and dimen-
sion variables. You can tell them that doing so makes you think of them as
dimwits — which is actually an honorable title at Autodesk, as I mention earlier
in this chapter.
Borrowing existing dimension styles
If you’re lucky enough to work in an office where someone has set up dimension
styles that are appropriate for your industry and project, you can skip the pain
and strain of creating your own dimension styles. If the ready-made dimension
style that you need lives in another drawing, you can use the DesignCenter
palette to copy it into your drawing, as described in the following steps:
1. Open the drawing that contains the dimension style you want to copy
(the source drawing).
2. Open the drawing to which you want to copy the dimension style (the
destination drawing).
If you already had both drawings open, make sure that you can see the
destination drawing. If you can’t, choose the Window menu and then
choose the destination drawing in order to bring it to the foreground.
3. Click the AutoCAD DesignCenter button on the Standard toolbar.
The DesignCenter palette appears. (Chapter 4 describes this palette in
detail.)
4. In the DesignCenter palette, click the Open Drawings tab.
DesignCenter’s navigation pane displays a list of drawings that you cur-
rently have open in AutoCAD.
235
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

5. In the left pane of the DesignCenter palette, click the plus sign next to
the name of the drawing that you opened in Step 1.
A list of copyable objects, including Dimstyles, appears.
6. Click and drag the desired dimension style from the right pane of the
DesignCenter palette into the window containing the drawing that you
opened in Step 2, as shown in Figure 10-4.
If the name of the dimension style that you copy duplicates the name of an
existing dimension style in the destination drawing, AutoCAD refuses to
overwrite the existing dimension style. In that case, you must first rename
the existing dimension style in the destination drawing by using the infor-
mation in the following section, “Creating and managing dimension styles.”
7. Change the Use Overall Scale Of factor on the Fit tab of the Modify
Dimension Style dialog box so that it matches the drawing scale factor
of the current drawing.
See Chapter 3 for detailed instructions.

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

If you want a dimension style to be available in new drawings, copy the style
to a template drawing and use that template to create your new drawings.
See Chapter 3 for more information about template drawings.
Creating and managing dimension styles
If you do need to create your own dimension styles, or you want to tweak
ones that you copied from another drawing, you use the Dimension Style
Manager dialog box, shown in Figure 10-5.
Every drawing comes with a default dimension style named Standard (for
nonmetric drawings) or ISO-25 (for metric drawings). Although you can use
and modify the Standard or ISO-25 style, I suggest that you leave it as is and
create your own dimension style(s) for the settings that are appropriate to
your work. This approach ensures that you can use the default style as a ref-
erence. More important, it avoids a potential naming conflict that can change
the way your dimensions look if the current drawing gets inserted into
another drawing. (Chapter 13 describes this potential conflict.)
The following steps describe how to create your own dimension style(s):
1. Choose Format➪Dimension Style from the menu bar, or click the
Dimension Style Manager button on the Styles toolbar.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box appears.
2. In the Styles list, select the existing dimension style whose settings
you want to use as the starting point for the settings of your new style.
For example, select the default dimension style named Standard or ISO-25.

Yet another

237
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

3. Click the New button to create a new dimension style that’s a copy of
the existing style.
The Create New Dimension Style dialog box appears.
4. Enter a New Style Name and click Continue.
The New Dimension Style dialog box appears, which is the same as the
Modify Dimension Style dialog box shown in Figure 10-6.
5. Modify dimension settings on any of the six tabs in the New Dimension
Style dialog box.
See the descriptions of these settings in the next section of this chapter.
In particular, be sure to set the Use Overall Scale Of factor on the Fit tab
to set the drawing scale factor.
6. Click OK to close the New Dimension Style dialog box.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box reappears.
7. Select your new dimension style from the Styles list, and then click Set
Current.
Your new dimension style becomes the current dimension style that
AutoCAD uses for future dimensions in this drawing.
8. Click Close.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box closes.
9. Draw some dimensions to test your new dimension style.
Avoid changing existing dimension styles that you didn’t create, unless you
know for sure what they’re used for. When you change a dimension style set-
ting, all dimensions that use that style change to reflect the revised setting.
Thus, one small dimension variable setting change can affect a large number
of existing dimensions! When in doubt, ask the dimension style’s creator
what the dimension style is for and what the consequences of changing it are.
If that’s not possible, instead of modifying an existing dimension style, create
a new style by copying the existing one, and then modify the new one.
A further variation on the already baroque dimension style picture is that you
can create dimension secondary styles (also called substyles or style families) —
variations of a main style that affect only a particular type of dimension, such as
radial or angular. You probably want to avoid this additional complication if you
can, but if you open the Dimension Style Manager dialog box and see names of
dimension types indented beneath the main dimension style names, be aware
that you’re dealing with secondary styles. Look up “dimension styles, sec-
ondary styles” on the Index tab in the AutoCAD online help system for more
information.
238
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Adjusting style settings
After you click New or Modify in the Dimension Style Manager dialog box,
AutoCAD displays a tabbed New/Modify Dimension Style subdialog box with a
mind-boggling — and potentially drawing-boggling, if you’re not careful — array
of settings. Figure 10-6 shows the settings on the first tab, which I’ve modified
from the AutoCAD defaults to conform to one office’s drafting standards.
Fortunately, the dimension preview that appears on all tabs — as well as on the
main Dimension Style Manager dialog box — immediately shows the results of
most setting changes. With the dimension preview and some trial-and-error
changing of settings, you usually can home in on an acceptable group of set-
tings. For more information, use the dialog box help: Click the question mark
button on the title bar and then click the setting that you want to know more
about.
Before you start messing with dimension style settings, it’s important to
know what you want your dimensions to look like when they’re plotted. If
you’re not sure how it’s done in your industry, ask others in your office or
profession or look at a plotted drawing that someone in the know represents
as being a good example.
The following sections introduce you to the more important New/Modify
Dimension Style tabs and highlight useful settings. Note that whenever you
specify a distance or length setting, you should enter the desired plotted size.
AutoCAD scales all these numbers by the overall scale factor that you enter
on the Fit tab.
Figure 10-6:
Modifying

settings.
239
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

Following Lines and Arrows
The settings on the Lines and Arrows tab control the basic look and feel of all
parts of your dimensions except text. Use this tab to change the type and size
of arrowheads or the display characteristics of the dimension and extension
lines.
Tabbing to Text
Use the Text tab to control how your dimension text looks — the text style and
height to use (see Chapter 9) and where to place the text with respect to the
dimension and extension lines. You’ll probably want to change the Text Style
setting to something that uses a more pleasing font than the dorky default
Txt.shx font, such as the Romans.shx font. The default Text Height is too large
for most situations — set it to 1⁄8”, 3mm, or another height that makes sense.
Figure 10-7 shows one company’s standard text settings.
The text style that you specify for a dimension style must be a variable height
style — that is, the height that you specify in the Text Style dialog box must be
zero. (See Chapter 9 for more information about variable height and fixed height
text styles.) If you specify a fixed height text style for a dimension style, the text
style’s height will override the Text Height setting in the New/Modify Dimension
Style subdialog box. This behavior is confusing at best and unacceptable at
worst. Use a variable height style to avoid the problem.
Enter the desired plotted text height. Don’t multiply it by the drawing scale
factor, as you do for ordinary text.
Figure 10-7:
Whip your
dimension
text into
shape.
240
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Industry or company standards usually dictate the size of dimension text.
(For example, 1⁄8 inch is common in the architectural industry.) In any case,
make sure you pick a height that’s not too small to read on your smallest
check plot.
AutoCAD 2005’s new background mask feature, described in Chapter 9, works
for dimension text, too. To turn on masking, choose either Background or a
specific color from the Fill Color drop-down list. When you do, AutoCAD
hides the portions of any objects that lie underneath dimension text. (To
ensure that dimension text lies on top of other objects, use the DRaworder or
TEXTTOFRONT command — see Chapter 9 for more information.
Getting Fit
The Fit tab includes a bunch of confusing options that control when and where
AutoCAD shoves the dimension text if it doesn’t quite fit between the dimen-
sion lines. The default settings leave AutoCAD in “maximum attempt at being
helpful mode” — that is, AutoCAD moves the text, dimension lines, and arrows
around automatically so that things don’t overlap. If these guesses seem less
than satisfactory to you, try the modified settings shown in Figure 10-7: Select
the Over the Dimension Line, without a Leader radio box under Text Placement
and the Always Draw Dim Line between Ext Lines check box under Fine Tuning.
(You can always move the text yourself by grip editing it, as I describe later in
this chapter.)
Most important, the Fit tab includes the Use Overall Scale Of setting, as noted
in Figure 10-8. This setting acts as a global scaling factor for all the other
length-related dimension settings. Always set Use Overall Scale Of to the
drawing scale factor of the current drawing.
Drawing scale factor goes here
Figure 10-8:
Keep Fit and
don’t forget
the Scale.
241
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

If your drawing includes areas of different scales, you can create multiple
dimension styles, one for each scale. Alternatively, you can set the Use
Overall Scale Of setting to 1.0 and draw dimensions in a paper space layout,
rather than in model space. See the “Trans-spatial dimensioning” section,
later in this chapter, for more information.
The Use Overall Scale Of setting corresponds to the DIMSCALE system vari-
able, and you’ll hear AutoCAD drafters refer to it as such. AutoCAD accepts
zero as a special DIMSCALE setting for dimensioning in paper space layouts.
Look up the DIMSCALE system variable in the AutoCAD online help system
for more information about additional dimension scale options.
Using Primary Units
The Primary Units tab gives you incredibly — or maybe overly — detailed con-
trol over how AutoCAD formats the characters in the dimension text string. You
usually want to set the Unit format and Precision and maybe specify a suffix for
unit-less numbers, such as mm for millimeters. You may also change the Zero
Suppression settings, depending on whether you want dimension text to read
0.5000, .5000, or 0.5. (“Zero Suppression!” also makes a great rallying cry for
organizing your fellow AutoCAD drafters.)
Other style settings
If your work requires that you show dimensions in two different units (such
as inches and millimeters), use the Alternate Units tab to turn on and control
alternate units. If your work requires listing construction tolerances (for
example, 3.5 mm +/–0.01), use the Tolerances tab to configure the tolerance
format that you want.
The New/Modify Dimension Style dialog box Tolerance tab settings are for
adding manufacturing tolerances (for example, +0.2 or -0.1) to the text of ordi-
nary dimensions — the kind of dimensions I cover in this chapter. AutoCAD also
includes a separate TOLERANCES command that draws special symbols called
geometric tolerances. If you need these symbols, you probably know it; if you’ve
never heard of them, just ignore them. Look up “Geometric Tolerance dialog box”
on the Index tab in the AutoCAD online help system for more information.
Drawing Dimensions
After you’ve copied or created a suitable dimension style, you’re ready to
dimension. Fortunately, adding dimensions to a drawing with existing dimen-
sion styles is usually pretty straightforward.
When you want to dimension something in AutoCAD, you can either select
the object, such as a line or polyline segment, or select points on that object,
such as the endpoints of the line or polyline segment. If you select an object,
242
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

AutoCAD finds the most obvious points on it to dimension, such as the end-
points of a line. If you choose to select individual points instead, use object
snaps (see Chapter 4). The points that you pick — or that AutoCAD finds for
you — are called the origins of the dimension’s extension lines. When you
change the size of the object (for example, by stretching it), AutoCAD auto-
matically moves the dimension’s origin points and updates the dimension
text to show the new length.
If you don’t use object snaps or another AutoCAD precision technique to
choose dimension points, the dimension text probably won’t reflect the pre-
cise measurement of the object. This lack of precision can cause serious
problems. When in doubt, osnap to it!
When you set up a new drawing, make sure that you change the Use Overall
Scale Of setting on the Fit tab in the New/Modify Dimension Style dialog box
so that it matches the drawing scale factor. Before you draw any dimensions
in a drawing that you didn’t set up, check this setting to make sure it’s correct.
The AutoCAD dimension drawing commands prompt you with useful informa-
tion at the command line. Read the command line prompts during every step
of the command, especially when you’re trying a dimensioning command for
the first time.
Lining up some linear dimensions
Linear dimensions are the most common type of dimensions, and horizontal
and vertical are the most common of those. The following example demon-
strates all the important techniques for creating horizontal and vertical
linear dimensions, as well as aligned dimensions (which are similar to linear
dimensions):
1. Use the LINE command to draw a nonorthogonal line — that is, a line
segment that’s not horizontal or vertical.
An angle of about 30 degrees works well for this example.
If you want to apply dimensioning to an object other than a line, use
these steps as a general guideline, filling in the appropriate commands
and data as applicable to your drawing.
2. Set a layer that’s appropriate for dimensions current.
See Chapter 4 for details.
3. Set a dimension style that’s appropriate for your needs current.
Choose an existing dimension style from the Dim Style Control drop-down
list on the Styles toolbar, or create a new style by using the procedure in
the section, “Creating and managing dimension styles,” earlier in this
chapter.
243
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

4. Choose Dimension➪Linear or click the Linear Dimension button on
the Dimension toolbar.
AutoCAD prompts you:
Specify first extension line origin or <select object>:
5. To specify the origin of the first extension line, snap to the lower-left
endpoint of the line by using endpoint object snap.
If you don’t have endpoint as one of your current running object snaps,
specify a single endpoint object snap by holding down the Shift key, right-
clicking, and choosing Endpoint from the cursor menu. (See Chapter 4 for
more about object snaps.)
AutoCAD prompts you:
Specify second extension line origin:
6. To specify the origin of the second extension line, snap to the other
endpoint of the line by using endpoint object snap again.
AutoCAD draws a horizontal dimension — the length of the displacement
in the left-to-right direction — if you move the cursor above or below the
line. It draws a vertical dimension — the length of the displacement in 
the up-and-down direction — if you move the cursor to the left or right 
of the line.
AutoCAD prompts you:
Specify dimension line location or
[Mtext/Text/Angle/Horizontal/Vertical/Rotated]: 
7. Move the mouse to generate the type of dimension you want, horizon-
tal or vertical, and then click wherever you want to place the dimen-
sion line.
When you’re specifying the dimension line location, you usually don’t
want to object snap to existing objects — you want the dimension line
and text to sit in a relatively empty part of the drawing rather than bump
into existing objects. If necessary, temporarily turn off running object
snap (for example, click the OSNAP button on the status bar) in order to
avoid snapping the dimension line to an existing object.
AutoCAD draws the dimension.
If you want to be able to align subsequent dimension lines easily, turn on
Snap and set a suitable snap spacing — more easily done than said! —
before you pick the point that determines the location of the dimension
line. See Chapter 4 for more information about snap.
8. Repeat Steps 4 through 7 to create another linear dimension of the
opposite orientation (vertical or horizontal).
244
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

9. Choose Dimension➪Aligned or click the Aligned Dimension button on
the Dimension toolbar.
The prompt includes an option to select an object instead of picking two
points (you can use this technique with the Linear Dimension command,
too):
Specify first extension line origin or <select object>:
10. Press Enter to choose the select object option.
AutoCAD prompts you:
Select object to dimension:
11. Select the line or other object that you want to dimension.
AutoCAD automatically finds the endpoints of the line and uses them as
the extension line origin points, as shown in Figure 10-9.

Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

AutoCAD prompts you:

[Mtext/Text/Angle]:
12. Click wherever you want to place the dimension line.
AutoCAD draws the dimension.
Drawing other kinds of dimensions
After you have the hang of ordinary linear dimensions, you should be able to
master other common dimension types quickly. Draw some lines, arcs, and
circles, and try the other dimension commands on the Dimension toolbar or
menu.
Although AutoCAD includes special commands for dimensioning the diame-
ter or radius of a circle or arc, you can use the linear dimension techniques
described in the previous section to dimension these objects.
To draw a series of side-by-side dimensions whose dimension lines are per-
fectly aligned, use the DimCOntinue command. To draw an overall dimension
above one or more smaller dimensions, use DimBAseline. If you use these
commands often in your work, you may find that the QDIM (Quick DIMension)
command provides a quick way to draw lots of dimensions in one fell swoop.
Figure 10-10 shows some results of using the more common additional dimen-
sioning commands.
Trans-spatial dimensioning
Trans-spatial dimensioning may sound like the latest New Age fad — after all,
most of Autodesk’s programmers do work in California — but actually it’s just
a relatively new (circa AutoCAD 2002) dimensioning feature. There’s an age-
old argument about whether to draw dimensions in model space, where the
geometry that you’re dimensioning usually resides, or paper space. (See
Chapter 3 for information about model space and paper space.) Most people
have settled on dimensioning in model space, but sometimes dimensioning in
paper space offers advantages — for example, when you want to dimension
different parts of the same geometry in different paper space viewports.
Since AutoCAD 2002, the program works much better for dimensioning in
paper space layouts — when you set the DIMSCALE system variable to 1.0
and then draw dimensions in paper space, AutoCAD can associate them with
objects in model space.
246
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Get comfortable with dimensioning in model space first. If you later want to
try dimensioning in paper space, look up “dimensioning, methods” in the
AutoCAD online help system.
Editing Dimensions
After you draw dimensions, you can edit the position of the various parts of
each dimension and change the contents of the dimension text. AutoCAD
groups all the parts of a dimension into a single object.
Editing dimension geometry
The easiest way to change the location of dimension parts is to use grip edit-
ing, which I describe in Chapter 6. Just click a dimension, click one of its
grips, and maneuver away. You’ll discover that certain grips control certain
directions of movement. Experiment a few minutes to see how they work.
If you want to change the look of a dimension part (for example, substitute a
different arrowhead or suppress an extension line), use the Properties
DimRAdius
DimLInear
DimDIameter
DimANgular
DimCOntinue
DimBAseline
Figure 10-10:
Examples of

Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

palette. (See Chapter 6 for more on the Properties palette.) All the dimension
settings in the New/Modify Dimension Style dialog box (see “Adjusting style
settings,” earlier in this chapter) are available in the Properties palette when
you select one or more dimensions.
If you select one or more dimensions and right-click, the cursor menu dis-
plays a number of useful options for overriding dimension settings or assign-
ing a different style.
When you change a setting in the Properties palette, you’re overriding the
default style setting for that dimension. If you need to make the same change to
a bunch of dimensions, it’s better to create a new dimension style and assign
that style to them. You can use the Properties palette or the right-click menu to
change the dimension style that’s assigned to one or more dimensions.
You can use the Properties palette to turn on AutoCAD 2005’s new back-
ground mask feature, described in Chapter 9, for the text of individual dimen-
sions: Select the dimensions, display the Text area in the Properties palette,
and choose either Background or a specific color from the Fill Color drop-
down list. Note that turning on background mask in the Multiline Text Editor
window, as Chapter 9 tells you to do for regular (nondimension) text, does
not work for dimension text. You must use the Fill Color setting on either the
Text tab of the New/Modify Dimension Style dialog box (as described earlier
in this chapter) or the Properties palette.
The AutoCAD eXplode command on the Modify toolbar will blow a dimension
apart, into a bunch of line and multiline text objects. Don’t do it! Exploding a
dimension makes it much harder to edit cleanly and eliminates AutoCAD’s
capability of updating the dimension text measurement automatically.
Editing dimension text
In most cases, you shouldn’t have to edit dimension text. Assuming that 
you drew your geometry accurately and picked the dimension points pre-
cisely, AutoCAD displays the right measurement. If you change the size of the
associated object, AutoCAD updates the dimension and its measurement.
However, you occasionally may need to override the dimension text (that is,
replace it with a different measurement) or add a prefix or a suffix to the true
measurement.
AutoCAD creates dimension text as a multiline text (mText) object, so dimen-
sion text has the same editing options as ordinary text. Unfortunately, the
right-click menu for dimension objects doesn’t include a Text Edit option. You
can use the Text Override field in the Properties palette, or type ED (the key-
board shortcut for the ddEDit command) to edit dimension text in the
Multiline Text Editor window.
248
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

The default text is <> (that is, the left and right angled bracket characters),
which acts as a placeholder for the true length. In other words, AutoCAD dis-
plays the true dimension length as text in the actual dimension (and keeps
the text up-to-date if you change the distance between the dimension’s origin
points). You can override the true length by typing a specific length or other
text string. You can preserve the true length but add a prefix or suffix by
typing it before or after the left- and right-angled bracket characters. In other
words, if you enter <> Max., and the actual distance is 12.00, AutoCAD dis-
plays 12.00 Max. for the dimension text. If you later stretch the object so
that the actual distance changes to 14.50, AutoCAD automatically changes
the dimension text to read 14.50 Max. Now you can appreciate the impor-
tance of drawing and editing geometry precisely!
Avoid the temptation to override the default dimension text by replacing the
angled brackets with a numeric value. Doing so eliminates AutoCAD’s capabil-
ity of keeping dimension measurements current, but even worse, you get no
visual cue that the default distance has been overridden (unless you edit the
dimension text). If you’re overriding dimension text a lot, it’s probably a sign
that the creator of the drawing didn’t pay enough attention to using precision
techniques when drawing and editing. I’m not going to point any fingers, but
you probably know whom to talk to.
Controlling and editing 
dimension associativity
When you add dimensions by selecting objects or picking points on the
objects by using object snap modes, AutoCAD normally creates geometry-
driven associative dimensions, which are connected to the objects and move
with them. This is the case in new drawings that were originally created in
any version of AutoCAD starting with 2002. (Autodesk introduced geometry-
driven dimensions in AutoCAD 2002. Before that, AutoCAD normally created
dimensions whose parts functioned as a single grouped object but that
weren’t connected with the dimensioned object.)
In drawings that were created originally in versions older than AutoCAD 2002,
you must set the new DIMASSOC system variable to 2 before AutoCAD 2005
will create geometry-driven associative dimensions. An easy way to make this
change for the current drawing is to open the Options dialog box (choose
Tools➪Options), click the User Preferences tab, and turn on the Make New
Dimensions Associative setting. Be aware that this setting affects only new
dimensions that you draw from now on. Thus, you’ll end up with geometry-
driven associative new dimensions and less than fully associative existing
dimensions in your old drawing. Look up “DIMASSOC system variable” in the
AutoCAD online help system for more information.
249
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

You aren’t likely to need any of these three commands very often, but if you
do, look up the command name in the online help system.
 DIMREASSOCIATE: If you have dimensions that aren’t currently geometry-
driven (probably because they were created in older versions of AutoCAD)
or are associated with the wrong objects, you can use the DIMREASSOCI-
ATE command (Dimensions➪Reassociate Dimensions) to associate them
with points on the objects of your choice.
 DIMDISASSOCIATE: You can use the DIMDISASSOCIATE command to
sever the connection between a dimension and its associated object.
 DIMREGEN: In a few special circumstances, AutoCAD doesn’t automati-
cally update geometry-driven associative dimensions (maybe Autodesk
should call them “usually geometry-driven but occasionally asleep at the
wheel associative dimensions”). In those cases, the DIMREGEN command
will fix things.
Pointy-Headed Leaders
No, I’m not talking about your boss (or about you, if you happen to be the
boss). I’m talking about arrows that point from your comment to the object
or area about which you’re commenting. AutoCAD treats leaders as a special
kind of dimension object (no jokes about dimwitted leaders, now). You can
draw leaders and text at the same time easily by using the qLEader (Quick
Leader) command, as described in the following steps.
qLEader is an improved version of the old LEADER command, which remains in
AutoCAD 2005 for compatibility reasons. I recommend that you use qLEader
instead of LEADER. Fortunately, the AutoCAD 2005 Dimension menu and tool-
bar choices run the qLEader command.
qLEader is another one of those annoying AutoCAD commands that prompts
you for some information on the command line and some in a dialog box. Pay
close attention to the command line prompts throughout this example:
1. Set a layer that’s appropriate for dimensions current.
See Chapter 4 for details.
2. Set a dimension style that’s appropriate for your needs current.
Choose an existing dimension style from the drop-down list on the Styles
toolbar, or create a new style by using the procedure in the section,
“Creating and managing dimension styles,” earlier in this chapter.
250
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

3. Choose Dimension➪Leader or click the Quick Leader button on the
Dimension toolbar.
The command line prompts you to select the first leader point — that is,
the arrowhead point — and gives you the option of changing leader set-
tings first:
Specify first leader point, or [Settings] <Settings>:
If you want to draw curved rather than straight leader lines or choose a
different leader arrowhead style, press Enter now to open the Leader
Settings dialog box.
4. Pick a point that you want to point to.
If you use an object snap mode, such as Nearest or Midpoint, to pick a
point on an object, AutoCAD associates the leader with the object. If you
later move the object, AutoCAD updates the leader so that it points to
the new location.
The command line prompts you for the next point — AutoCAD draws a
shaft from the arrowhead to this point:
Specify next point:
5. Pick a second point.
If you pick a second point that’s too close to the arrowhead point,
AutoCAD doesn’t have enough room to draw the arrowhead, and thus
omits it.
AutoCAD repeats the next point prompt so that you can draw a multiseg-
ment shaft if you want to:
Specify next point:
6. Pick one more point if you want to, or press Enter if you want a leader
with a single shaft.
Pressing Enter tells the qLEader command that you’re finished selecting
the points that define the leader shaft. By default, the qLEader command
lets you pick up to three points (the arrowhead point and two more
points). You can change this behavior in the Leader Settings dialog box
(refer to Step 3).
The command line prompts you to specify the width for word-wrapping
the text that you’ll attach to the leader:
Specify text width <0.0>:
The default text width, 0.0, turns off word-wrapping and displays your
text on a single line. You can type a width or point and click with the
mouse.
251
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

Turning off word-wrapping works fine for short notes that fit on one line.
If you think your note may be longer, specify a width instead of accept-
ing the default value of 0.0.
7. Press Enter to suppress word-wrapping, or move the cursor to the
right or left to specify a width for word-wrapping; then click.
The command line prompts you to type a short note directly at the com-
mand line, or press Enter to type your note in the Multiline Text Editor
window:
Enter first line of annotation text <Mtext>:
8. Press Enter to open the Multiline Text Editor window.
9. Enter your comment.
10. Click OK.
The Multiline Text Editor window closes and adds your comment to the
drawing, next to the leader.
Figure 10-11 shows several different leaders with notes.

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

If both the leader arrowhead and the text are the wrong size or appear to be
missing entirely, the dimension scale isn’t set correctly in the drawing. (As I
warn you earlier, AutoCAD treats leaders as a special kind of dimension
object.) See Chapter 3 for detailed instructions on how to set the dimension
scale. After you set the dimension scale properly, erase and re-create the
leader and text.
If you add a comment to a drawing and later decide that the comment merits
a leader, you can use the qLEader command to draw the leader so that the
end of the shaft ends up in the vicinity of the existing text object. Then, when
the Multiline Text Editor window appears (Step 8 in the previous steps), click
OK without entering any new text.
A leader and the text that you draw with it are partially associated with each
other. When you move the text, the leader’s shaft follows. Unfortunately, the
converse isn’t true — moving the leader or one of its vertices doesn’t cause
the text to follow.

f you were hoping to hatch a plot (or plot a hatch), see Chapter 12 instead.
If you want to hatch an egg, buy my companion book, Raising Chickens For
Dummies. If you need to fill in closed areas of your drawings with special pat-
terns of lines, this is your chapter.
Drafters often use hatching to represent the type of material that makes up an
object, such as insulation, metal, concrete, and so on. In other cases, hatching
helps emphasize or clarify the extent of a particular element in the drawing —
for example, showing the location of walls in a building plan, or highlighting a
swampy area on a map so you know where to avoid building a road. Figure 11-1
shows an example of hatching in a structural detail.
An AutoCAD hatch is a separate object that fills a space, that has an appear-
ance dictated by the hatch pattern assigned to it, and that is associated with
the objects that bound the space, such as lines, polylines, or arcs. If you move
or stretch the boundaries, AutoCAD normally updates the hatching to fill the
resized area.
Don’t go overboard with hatching. The purpose of hatching is to clarify, not
overwhelm, the other geometry in the drawing. If your plots look like a patch-
work quilt of hatch patterns, it’s time to simplify.

Hatching is another kind of annotation of your geometry, similar in purpose to
text and dimensions. As I describe at the beginning of Chapter 9, you’ll usually
be more efficient if you save annotation for later in the drafting process. Draw
as much geometry as possible first, and then hatch the parts that require it. In
other words, batch your hatch.
Hatch . . . Hatch . . . Hatchoo
This section outlines the steps you use to add hatching to a drawing with the
Boundary Hatch and Fill dialog box, shown in Figure 11-2. You can use this
information to get started quickly with hatching. When you need more informa-
tion about any part of the process, jump to the relevant sections of “Pushing
the Boundary (of) Hatch,” later in this chapter.
The following steps show you how to hatch an enclosed area by using the
“pick points” method of selecting the hatch area:
1. Open a drawing containing geometry that forms fully closed bound-
aries, or draw some boundaries by using the drawing commands I
describe in Chapter 5.
The areas you want to hatch must be completely enclosed. The Circle,
POLygon, and RECtang commands, and the Line and PLine commands
with the Close option, make great hatch boundaries (see Chapter 5 for
details).

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

2. Set an appropriate layer current, as described in Chapter 4.
It’s usually best to put hatching on its own layer.
3. Start the bHatch command by clicking the Hatch button on the Draw
toolbar.
The Boundary Hatch and Fill dialog box appears.
For historical reasons, AutoCAD 2005 also has a HATCH command, which
prompts you at the command line instead of opening a dialog box. Trust
me — you want the bHatch command’s dialog box.
4. Choose Predefined, User Defined, or Custom from the Type drop-down
list.
Predefined or User Defined works best for most purposes. See the next
section for details.
5. If you chose Predefined or Custom in the previous step, select any
predefined or custom hatch pattern from the Pattern drop-down list
or the Pattern button just to the right of it. If you chose User Defined,
you don’t need to choose a pattern.
6. Specify an Angle and Scale for the hatch pattern (or, if you chose User
Defined in Step 4, specify Angle and Spacing).
See “Getting it right: Hatch angle and scale,” later in this chapter, for more
information.

7. Click the Pick Points button.
The Boundary Hatch and Fill dialog box (temporarily) disappears, and
your drawing reappears with the following prompt at the command line:
Select internal point:
8. Select a point inside the boundary within which you want to hatch by
clicking it with the mouse.
AutoCAD analyzes the drawing and decides which boundaries to use. 
In a complex drawing, this analysis can take several seconds. AutoCAD
highlights the boundary that it finds.
If AutoCAD highlights the wrong boundary, right-click, choose Clear All
from the cursor menu, and try again.
9. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Enter from the
cursor menu to indicate that you’re finished selecting points.
The Boundary Hatch and Fill dialog box reappears.
10. Click the Preview button to preview the hatch.
The Boundary Hatch and Fill dialog box (temporarily) disappears again,
and AutoCAD shows you what the hatch will look like.
Pick or press Esc to return to dialog or <Right-click to
accept hatch>:
11. Click anywhere in the drawing area to return to the Boundary Hatch
and Fill dialog box.
12. Adjust any settings and preview again until you’re satisfied with the
hatch.
13. Click OK.
AutoCAD hatches the area inside the boundary. If you modify the bound-
ary, the hatch automatically resizes to fill the resized area.
Occasionally, AutoCAD gets confused and doesn’t resize a hatch after you
resize the boundary. If that happens, erase and then re-create the hatch in
the resized area.
Pushing the Boundary (of) Hatch
The remainder of this chapter shows you how to refine the techniques pre-
sented in the preceding section. I describe how to copy existing hatching, take
advantage of the various options in the Boundary Hatch and Fill dialog box,
and choose more complicated hatching boundaries.
258
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Hatch from scratch
You can use predefined, user-defined, or custom hatch patterns. Most of the
time, you’ll choose either predefined or user-defined hatch patterns, unless
some generous soul gives you a custom pattern. The next four sections
describe the hatch pattern type choices.
259
Chapter 11: Down the Hatch
Catch a hatch: Copying hatch properties
One slick way to hatch is by using the Inherit
Properties button in the Boundary Hatch and Fill
dialog box to copy hatch properties from an
existing hatch object. Think of it as point and
shoot hatching. If someone — such as you —
added some hatching in the past that’s just like
what you want to use now, click the Inherit
Properties button and pick the existing hatching.
Inherit Properties updates the hatch pattern
settings in the Boundary Hatch and Fill dialog
box to make them the same as the existing
hatch pattern object that you picked. You can
use the cloned hatch pattern specifications as
is or modify them by making changes in the
Boundary Hatch and Fill dialog box.
Consistency is a good thing in drafting, espe-
cially in computer-aided drafting, in which some
or all your drawing may be used for a long time.
Thus it’s good to use the same hatch patterns,
scales, and angles for the same purposes in all
your drawings. Find out whether your project,
office, company, or profession has hatching
standards that apply to your work.

Pick a pattern, any pattern: Predefined hatch patterns
To use AutoCAD’s predefined hatch patterns, select Predefined from the drop-
down list box at the top of the Hatch tab in the Boundary Hatch and Fill dialog
box. This selection sets the stage for choosing the hatch pattern.
You specify a predefined hatch pattern in one of two ways:
 If you know the name of the hatch pattern, select it from the Pattern drop-
down list. The list is alphabetical, except that SOLID (that is, a solid fill)
is at the very beginning.
 If you don’t know the pattern’s name, or you prefer the visual approach,
click the Pattern button (the tiny button with the ellipsis [three dots] to
the right of the Pattern prompt and pattern name) to display the Hatch
Pattern Palette with pattern previews and names.
AutoCAD has about 80 predefined hatch patterns from which to choose. The
list includes ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (Interna-
tional Standards Organization) standard hatch patterns. Figure 11-3 shows
the Other Predefined hatch patterns, which cover everything from Earth to
Escher to Stars. Hatch patterns whose names begins with AR- are intended
for architectural and related industries.
After you’ve selected a pattern, specify angle and scale, as I describe in the
section “Getting it right: Hatch angle and scale,” in this chapter.
Figure 11-3:
Plenty of
hatch
patterns.
260
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

It’s up to you: User-defined hatches
A user-defined hatch pattern makes a hatch pattern out of parallel lines. Use
this option to create a simple pattern and specify the space between the lines
in drawing units. For example, you can hatch a wall in a building plan with a
user-defined pattern and specify that the hatch lines be three inches apart.
After you choose User Defined from the Type drop-down list in the Boundary
Hatch and Fill dialog box, you specify the angle and spacing of the lines. You
can select the Double check box to achieve a crosshatching effect (two per-
pendicular sets of hatching lines).
Getting it right: Hatch angle and scale
Predefined and custom hatch patterns require that you enter the angle and
scale for AutoCAD to generate the hatching. You usually won’t have any trou-
ble deciding on an appropriate angle, but a suitable scale can be tricky.
261
Chapter 11: Down the Hatch
Make it solid, man
Although you may not guess it, AutoCAD treats
filling an area with a solid color as a type of
hatching. Simply choose Solid from the top of
the Pattern drop-down list.
Like any other object, a solid hatch takes on
the current object color — or the current
layer’s color if you leave color set to ByLayer.
Therefore, check whether the current object
layer and color are set appropriately before
you use the Solid hatching option (see Chapter
4 for details).
You can create the effect of a solid fill in
AutoCAD in several other ways:
 If you want a filled-in circle or donut, use
the DOnut command and specify an inside
diameter of 0.
 If you want one or more line segments with
either uniform or tapered widths, use the
PLine command’s Width option. (Chapter 5
discusses the DOnut and PLine commands.)
 If you want a pattern that starts out solid but
then fades away (or transitions to a differ-
ent color) in one or more directions, use the
Gradient tab on the Boundary Hatch and Fill
dialog box. This option creates a gradient
fill. You can control the color(s), direction(s),
and angle of the gradient.
Solid and gradient fills are a good way to mimic
poché — an old hand-drafting technique in
which you shade areas with a lighter colored
pencil (usually red) to make those areas appear
lightly shaded on blueline prints. The figure
shows some examples of solid and gradient fills.

The hatch scale usually should be a pattern-specific multiplier times the draw-
ing scale factor, as described in Chapter 3. For example, the EARTH pattern
(in the Other Predefined tab of the Hatch Pattern Palette; refer to Figure 11-3)
looks pretty good in a full scale (1 = 1) drawing with a hatch scale of 0.75. If
you’re adding EARTH pattern hatching to a 1” = 1’–0” detail (drawing scale
factor equals 12), try using a hatch scale of 0.75 × 12, or 9.0. This pattern-
specific multiplier and drawing-scale-factor approach ensures that hatching
looks consistent (that the spaces between the lines are the same) at all scales
when you plot.
Assuming that you know your drawing’s scale factor, the only complication is
figuring out what the pattern-specific multiplier should be for a particular
hatch pattern. In a more rational world, the pattern-specific multiplier would
always be something sensible, like 1.0. Unfortunately, that’s not the case for
all hatch pattern definitions. Even worse, there’s no way to predict before
you use a hatch pattern for the first time what an appropriate pattern-specific
multiplier might be. (Autodesk created the hatch patterns whose names begins
with AR- — that is, the ones intended for architectural drawings — with a final
hatch scale of 1.0 in mind, but in some cases you’ll have to adjust up or down
in order to achieve a suitable scale.) You have to use trial and error the first
time, and then make a note of the hatch pattern and multiplier for future use.
The first time you use a hatch pattern definition, try 1.0 as the multiplier. Don’t
forget to multiply by the drawing scale factor. Preview the hatch and then
adjust the hatch scale iteratively; preview after each change. After you settle
upon a scale for the current drawing, calculate the corresponding multiplier
(for future use); divide the hatch scale by the current drawing’s scale factor.
User-defined patterns require that you enter an angle and spacing, not angle
and scale. Spacing is expressed in the current drawing units.
Do fence me in: Defining hatch boundaries
After you specify the hatch pattern, angle, and scale you want to use, you
define the boundary (or boundaries) into which you want to pour that hatch
pattern in one of two ways: 
 Picking points within the area(s) you want hatched
 Selecting objects that surround those areas
The actual operation involved in using either of these options is confusing to
most people. You’ll probably need a little practice before you get used to it.
262
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

The idea behind either definition option is simple when applied to simple
areas — that is, closed areas with no additional objects inside them. To define
the hatch boundary for a simple area, do one of these two things:
 Click the Pick Points button in the Boundary Hatch and Fill dialog box
and then click a point inside the boundary. 
 Click the Select Objects button and select one or more objects that form
a fully closed boundary.
This simple hatching gets more complicated if you have one closed object
inside another, as in Figure 11-4. The AutoCAD hatch preview and a bit of
experimentation will clarify all these potentially puzzling permutations.
As I warn earlier in this chapter, boundaries must be completely closed before
AutoCAD will hatch them. That’s one of the reasons you should employ the
precision techniques from this book whenever you draw or edit objects. If
the lines surrounding your boundary don’t either meet exactly or cross, Auto-
CAD scolds you with a Valid hatch boundary not found error message.

Chapter 11: Down the Hatch

The Valid hatch boundary not found error message means you need to
“repair” lines or other objects so they are a fully closed boundary. Sometimes
you can use the Fillet command with a zero fillet radius to force two lines to
meet exactly. Another possibility is to use grip editing to align one endpoint
precisely with another. Chapter 6 discusses these two editing techniques.
If you don’t want to go to the trouble of repairing your drawing in this way, you
can use AutoCAD 2005’s new Gap Tolerance setting, located on the Advanced
tab of the Boundary Hatch and Fill dialog box, to tell AutoCAD to overlook
small gaps when dealing with hatch boundaries.
Hatching that knows its place
In AutoCAD 2005, the Boundary Hatch and Fill dialog box includes a new Draw
Order setting that controls where AutoCAD places the hatching with respect to
the boundary in terms of object selection. (Refer to Figure 11-2.) The default
setting, Send behind boundary, puts the hatching “underneath” its boundary
for object selection purposes, and that’s usually exactly what you want.
Have palette, will hatch
With Tool Palettes, described in Chapter 2, you can create click-and-drag
hatch palettes. With a hatch palette, you click a tool (a swatch) and drag
into an enclosed boundary to hatch the area. If your hatching needs are
simple, you can create a Tool Palette for the patterns and scales you often
use. See “hatches, adding to tool palettes” in AutoCAD’s online help for more
information.
Editing Hatch Objects
Editing an existing hatch pattern is simple after you’re familiar with the Bound-
ary Hatch and Fill dialog box. Follow these steps:
1. Select the hatch object.
2. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Hatch Edit from
the cursor menu.
AutoCAD opens the Hatch Edit dialog box and displays the hatch object’s
current settings.
3. Make any desired changes, use the Preview button to look them over,
and click OK to keep the changes.
264
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Alternatively, you can use the Properties palette (described in Chapter 6) to
make most existing hatch pattern changes. The Properties palette is especially
good for changing several hatches at once.
To make one hatch look like another, use the Match Properties button on the
Standard toolbar.
The TRim command (described in Chapter 6) is now capable of trimming hatch
patterns in most cases — although it removes associativity of the hatch pat-
tern with the boundary.

espite the increasing number of offices with a computer (or two) on
every desk, many people still need to or want to work with printed
drawings. Perhaps you thought that using AutoCAD means you don’t have to
rely on hard-copy versions of drawings, but can view them on-screen instead.
Even if that’s true, you may need to give hard-copy prints to your less savvy
colleagues who don’t have AutoCAD. You may want to make some quick
prints to pore over during your bus ride home. You may find that checking
drawings the old-fashioned way — with a hard-copy print and a red pencil —
turns up errors that managed to remain hidden on the computer screen.
Whatever the reason, you’ll want to print drawings at some point — probably
sooner rather than later. Depending on where you are in a project, plotting is
the pop quiz, midterm, or final exam of your drawing-making semester. This
chapter helps you ace the test.
You Say Printing, I Say Plotting
Plotting originally meant creating hard-copy output on a device that was capa-
ble of printing on larger sheets, such as D size or E size, that measure several
feet on a side. (See Chapter 3 for information about drafting paper sizes.)
These plotters often used pens to draw, robot-fashion, on large sheets of

vellum or Mylar. The sheets could then be run through diazo blueline
machines — copying machines that create blueline prints — in order to
create less-expensive copies. Printing meant creating hard-copy output on
ordinary printers that used ordinary sized paper, such as A size (letter size,
81⁄2 x 11 inches) or B size (tabloid or ledger size, 11 x 17 inches).
Nowadays, AutoCAD and most CAD users make no distinction between plot-
ting and printing. AutoCAD veterans usually say “plotting,” so if you want to
be hip, you can do so, too.
Whatever you call it, plotting an AutoCAD drawing is considerably more com-
plicated than printing a word processing document or a spreadsheet. CAD has
a larger range of different plotters and printers, drawing types, and output
procedures than other computer applications. AutoCAD tries to help you tame
the vast jungle of plotting permutations, but you’ll probably find that you have
to take some time to get the lay of the land and clear a path to your desired
hard-copy output.
The plotting system in AutoCAD 2005 is essentially the same as the one that
Autodesk introduced in AutoCAD 2000, but with a reorganized, somewhat
less imposing Plot dialog box. In addition, Autodesk has improved the page
setups feature and added background plotting. I describe all these changes in
this chapter.
Get with the system
One of the complications you face in your attempts to create hard copy is that
AutoCAD has two distinct ways of communicating with your plotters and print-
ers. Operating systems, and the programs that run in them, use a special piece
of software called a printer driver to format data for printing and then send it to
the printer or plotter. When you configure Windows to recognize a new printer
connected to your computer or your network, you’re actually installing the
printer’s driver. (“Bring the Rolls around front, James. And bring me a gin and
tonic and a D-size plot while you’re at it.”) AutoCAD, like other Windows pro-
grams, works with the printers you’ve configured in Windows. AutoCAD calls
these system printers because they’re part of the Windows system.
But AutoCAD, unlike other Windows programs, can’t leave well enough alone.
Some output devices, especially some larger plotters, aren’t controlled very
efficiently by Windows system printer drivers. For that reason, AutoCAD comes
with specialized nonsystem drivers (that is, drivers that are not installed as part
of the Windows system) for plotters from companies such as Hewlett Packard,
Xerox, and Océ. These drivers are kind of like nonunion workers. They ignore
the tidy rules for communicating with Windows printers in order to get things
done a bit more quickly and flexibly.
268
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Using already-configured Windows system printer drivers usually is easiest,
and they work well with many devices — especially devices that print on
smaller paper, such as laser and inkjet printers. However, if you have a large
plotter, you may be able to get faster plotting, better plot quality, or more
plot features by installing a nonsystem driver. To find out more, choose
Contents➪Driver and Peripheral Guide➪Use Plotters and Printers in the
AutoCAD online help system.
The AutoCAD 2005 CD includes a Windows system printer driver for Hewlett-
Packard DesignJet large format printers. This driver is optimized for CAD
plotting. To install the driver, load your AutoCAD 2005 CD, click Install, and
then click Hewlett Packard DesignJet Printer Drivers.
Configure it out
For now, you simply should make sure that AutoCAD recognizes the devices
that you want to use for plotting. The following steps show you how:
1. Launch AutoCAD and open an existing drawing or start a new, blank
drawing.
2. Choose Tools➪Options to open the Options dialog box, and click the
Plot and Publish tab.
3. Click the drop-down arrow to view the list just below the Use As
Default Output Device option, as shown in Figure 12-1.
The list includes two kinds of device configurations, designated by two
tiny, difficult-to-distinguish icons to the left of the device names: 
• A little laser printer icon, with a sheet of white paper coming out
the top, indicates a Windows system printer configuration. 
• A little plotter icon, with a piece of paper coming out the front,
indicates a nonsystem (that is, AutoCAD-specific) configuration.
The nonsystem configuration names always end in pc3, because they’re
stored in special AutoCAD Printer Configuration version 3 files. So, if you
can’t tell the difference between the icons, look for the pc3 at the end of
the name.
4. Verify that the list includes the printers and plotters that you want to
have available in AutoCAD.
If not, choose Start➪Printers and Faxes (in Windows XP) or Start➪
Settings➪Printers (in Windows 2000), launch the Add Printer Wizard,
and follow the instructions. If your printer isn’t in the default Windows
list, cancel the wizard and hunt down a driver disk that came with your
printer, or, better yet, download the current driver from the printer 
manufacturer’s Web site.
269
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

5. Choose the output device that you want to make the default for new
drawings.
6. Click OK to close the dialog box and retain any change that you made
in the previous step.
You use the AutoCAD Plotter Manager Add-A-Plotter Wizard to create nonsys-
tem driver configurations. (Choose File➪Plotter Manager to display a window
containing a shortcut to the wizard.) This wizard is similar to the Windows
Add Printer Wizard; if you can handle adding an ordinary printer in Windows,
you probably can handle adding a nonsystem plotter configuration to
AutoCAD. When you complete the wizard steps, AutoCAD saves the informa-
tion in a PC3 (Plot Configuration version 3) file.
A Simple Plot
Okay, so you believe me. You know that you’re not going to master AutoCAD
plotting in five minutes. That doesn’t change the fact that your boss, employee,
wife, husband, construction foreman, or 11-year-old son wants a quick check
plot of your drawing.

Plotting success in 16 steps
Here’s the quick, cut-to-the-chase procedure for plotting a simple drawing —
a mere 16 steps! This procedure assumes that you plot in model space — that
is, that the Model tab at the bottom of the drawing area shows the drawing in
a way that you want to plot. (I cover plotting paper space layout tabs in the
section “Plotting the Layout of the Land,” later in this chapter.) This proce-
dure doesn’t deal with controlling plotted lineweights (see the “Plotting
Lineweights and Colors” section later in this chapter for those details). It
should, however, result in a piece of paper that bears some resemblance to
what AutoCAD displays on your computer monitor.
Follow these steps to make a simple, not-to-scale, monochrome plot of a drawing:
1. Open the drawing in AutoCAD.
2. Click the Model tab at the bottom of the drawing area to ensure that
you’re plotting the model space contents.
I explain model space and paper space in Chapter 3, and I explain how to
plot paper space layouts later in this chapter.
3. Zoom to the drawing’s current extents (choose View➪Zoom➪Extents)
so you can verify the area you’re going to plot.
The extents of a drawing consist of a rectangular area just large enough
to include all the objects in the drawing.
4. To display the Plot dialog box, click the Plot button on the Standard
toolbar.
The Plot dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-2.
5. In the Printer/Plotter area, select a device from the Name list.
6. In the Paper Size area, select a paper size that’s loaded in your printer
or plotter.
Of course, you must make sure that the paper size is large enough to fit
the drawing at the scale you want to plot it at. For example, if you want
to plot a D-size drawing, but you have only a B-size printer, you’re out of
luck — unless you resort to multiple pieces of paper and lots of tape.
7. In the Plot Area area (sponsored by the Department of Redundancy
Department), choose Extents.
If you set limits properly, as I suggest in Chapter 3, then choose Limits
instead in order to plot the drawing area that you defined. The Window
option — that is, plot a window whose corners you pick — is useful
when you want to plot just a portion of your drawing. 
8. In the Plot Offset area, choose Center the Plot.
Alternatively, you can specify offsets of zero or other amounts in order
to position the plot at a specific location on the paper.
271
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

9. In the Plot Scale area, either choose Fit to Paper or uncheck Fit to
Paper and specify a scale (by choosing from the drop-down list or
typing into the two text boxes).
For most real plotting, you’ll plot to a specific scale, but feel free to
choose Fit to Paper for now. If you do want to plot to a specific scale, see
the “Instead of fit, scale it” section later in this chapter for guidance.
10. Click the More Options button (at the bottom-right corner of the
dialog box, next to the Help button.
The Plot dialog box reveals additional settings, as shown in Figure 12-3.
11. In the Plot Style Table (Pen Assignments) area, choose
Monochrome.ctb or Monochrome.stb.
AutoCAD may ask you whether to “Assign this plot style table to all lay-
outs?” Answer Yes to make Monochrome.ctb (or Monochrome.stb) the
default plot style table for the paper space layout tabs as well as the Model
tab, or answer No to make the change apply only to the current tab.
The “Plotting with style” section later in this chapter describes plot style
tables.
12. In the Plot Options area, make sure that Plot With Plot Styles is on
and Save Changes to Layout is off, as shown in Figure 12-3.
Leaving Save Changes to Layout turned off tells AutoCAD to use any plot
settings changes that you make only for this plot — AutoCAD will revert
to the original plot settings the next time you plot the drawing.
More Options button

272
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

After you become confident with plotting, you may want to turn on this
setting so that AutoCAD does save your plotting settings changes as the
default. Alternatively, click the Apply to Layout button to make the cur-
rent plot settings the default for future plotting of this tab (that is, the
Model tab) in this drawing.
13. In the Drawing Orientation area, choose Portrait or Landscape.
The postage stamp-sized preview in the middle of the Plot dialog box
should help you decide on the right orientation. If not, the full preview in
the next step will tell you for sure.
14. Click the Preview button and check that the drawing displays on the
paper at the correct orientation and size, as shown in Figure 12-4;
then, right-click and choose Exit to return to the Plot dialog box.
15. If you found any problems in the preview, adjust the plot settings (for
example, Plot Area, Plot Scale, or Drawing Orientation) and repeat
the preview until the plot looks right.
16. Click OK to create the plot.
When AutoCAD finishes generating and sending the plot, it displays a
“Plot and Publish Job Complete” balloon notification from the status bar.
If you decide that you don’t want to see these notifications, right -lick
the Plot/Publish Details Report Available icon near the right end of the
status bar and deselect Enable Balloon Notification.
There — 16 steps, as promised. If for some reason your plot didn’t work, well,
I warned you that AutoCAD plotting was complicated and temperamental!
Read the rest of this chapter for all the details about the numerous other
plotting options that can cause plotting to go awry. If you’re in a big hurry,

Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

Preview one, two
One of the keys to efficient plotting is liberal use of AutoCAD’s partial and full
preview features. (To maintain political fairness, I recommend conservative
use of some other AutoCAD options elsewhere in the book.)
The postage stamp-sized partial preview in the middle of the Plot dialog box
is a quick reality check to make sure your plot fits on the paper and is turned
in the right direction. If the plot area at the current scale is too large for the
paper, AutoCAD displays thick red warning lines along the side(s) of the
sheet where the drawing will be truncated.
Press the Preview button to see a full preview in a separate window. You see
exactly how your drawing lays out on the paper and how the various line-
weights, colors, and other object plot properties will appear. You can zoom 
and pan around the preview by using the right-click menu. (Any zooming or
panning that you do does not affect what area of the drawing gets plotted —
zooming and panning is just a way to get a better look at different areas of the
plot preview.)

Instead of fit, scale it
In most real plotting situations, you want to plot to a specific scale rather
than let AutoCAD choose an oddball scale that just happens to maximize the
drawing on the paper. And if you’re going to plot the Model tab of a drawing
to scale, you need to know its drawing scale factor. Chapter 3 describes setup
concepts and Chapter 9 provides some tips for determining the scale factor
of a drawing that someone else created.
If your drawing was created at a standard scale, such as 1:50 or 1⁄4 ”=1’–0”,
then you simply choose the scale from the handy drop-down Scale list in the
Plot dialog box. If your scale is not in the list, then type the ratio between
plotted distance and AutoCAD drawing distance into the two text boxes
below the Scale list, as shown in Figure 12-5. The easiest way to express the
ratio usually is to type 1 (one) in the upper box and the drawing scale factor
in the lower box. (See Chapter 3 for more information.)
Creating half-size plots for some purposes is common in some industries. To
plot model space half-size, double the drawing scale factor. For example, a 
1⁄8 ”=1’–0” drawing has a drawing scale factor of 96, which is equivalent to a
plot scale of 1=96. To make a half-size model space plot of it, specify a plot
scale of 1=192 (or choose 1⁄16 ”=1’–0” from the Scale drop-down list).

Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

Even if you work with drawings that are created to be plotted at a specific
scale, plotting with a Fit to Paper scale may be the most efficient way to make
a reduced-size check plot. For example, drafters in your office might create
drawings that get plotted on D size sheets (24 x 36 inch), whereas you have
access to a laser printer with a B size (11 x 17 inch) paper tray. By plotting
the D size drawings Scaled to Fit on B size paper, you end up with check plots
that are slightly smaller than half size ( 11⁄24 size, to be exact). You won’t be
able to measure distances on the check plots with a scale, but you probably
will be able to check them visually for overall correctness.
Plotting the Layout of the Land
In the previous section I show you how to plot the model space representa-
tion of your drawing by making sure that the Model tab is active when you
open the Plot dialog box. However, paper space gives you many additional
options for controlling the look of your output, without having to modify the
underlying geometry or the way it looks to someone working on the DWG file.
So in some drawings, you want to plot a paper space layout instead.
About paper space layouts and plotting
As Chapter 3 describes, you can use AutoCAD’s paper space feature to com-
pose one or more layouts for plotting your drawing in particular ways. Each
layout lives on a separate tab, which you click at the bottom of the drawing
area. In addition, AutoCAD saves plot settings (plot device, paper size, plot
scale, and so on) separately for each of the tabs — that is, for each of layout
tabs as well as the Model tab.
Whether to plot model space or a paper space layout in a drawing depends
entirely on how the drawing was set up. If you or someone else went through
a layout setup procedure similar to the one in Chapter 3, then you probably
should plot the paper space layout. If not, then plot the Model tab.
Don’t confuse the Model tab at the bottom of the drawing area with the
MODEL/PAPER button on the status bar. The tabs control which view of the
drawing (model space or a paper space layout) fills the drawing area. When 
a paper space layout fills the drawing area, the status bar button controls
whether drawing and editing take place in paper space or in model space
inside a viewport. When you plot a layout, it doesn’t matter whether the
MODEL/PAPER button says MODEL or PAPER — AutoCAD always plots the
paper space layout (not just the contents of model space in the viewport).
276
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

The presence of a Layout1 tab next to the Model tab at the bottom of the
drawing area doesn’t necessarily mean that the drawing contains an already
set up paper space layout. AutoCAD always displays a Layout1 tab when you
open a drawing created in AutoCAD Release 14 or earlier, and displays a
Layout1 and Layout2 tab when you open a drawing created in AutoCAD 2000
or later. Layout1 and Layout2 are simply AutoCAD’s default names; the cre-
ator of the drawing may have renamed them to something more descriptive.
If you don’t have any paper space drawings handy, you can use one of the
AutoCAD sample drawings, such as the architectural floor plan drawing
stored in \Program Files\AutoCAD 2005\Sample\8th floor plan.dwg.
The path to paper space 
layout plotting success
Plotting a paper space layout is pretty much like plotting model space,
except that you need to find the appropriate layout first and make sure that
its tab is selected before you open the Plot dialog box:
1. Click the layout tabs at the bottom of the drawing area until you find a
suitably set up layout.
If no one has set up the layout yet, AutoCAD creates a default layout. (If
the Show Page Setup Manager for New Layouts setting on the Display
tab of the Options dialog box is turned on, you’ll see the Page Setup
Manager dialog box first — just click the Close button.) The default
layout probably won’t be useful for real projects, but you use it to find
out about the layout plotting procedure. Refer to Chapter 3 for instruc-
tions on creating a real layout.
2. Click the Plot button on the Standard toolbar.
The Plot dialog box appears.
3. Specify a Printer/Plotter Name and a Paper Size.
4. In the What to Plot list, choose Layout.
5. Specify the Plot Offset (such as zero in both the X and Y directions).
6. Specify a Plot Scale of 1:1.
One of the big advantages of layouts is that you don’t need to know any-
thing about drawing scale in order to plot the drawing — hence the name
paper space. Figure 12-6 shows the proper settings for plotting a layout.
To create a half-size plot of a layout, specify a plot scale of 1:2. In addi-
tion, turn on the Scale Lineweights setting in order to reduce lineweights
proportionally. (I cover plotting lineweights later in this chapter.)
277
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

If you find that the layout is too big for your plotter’s largest paper size
at a plot scale of 1:1, you can change the What to Plot setting to Extents
and then specify Fit to Paper for the Plot Scale. Alternatively, you can
exit the Plot dialog box and fix the problem if you want to have a paper
space layout that permanently reflects a new paper size. Use the Page
Setup dialog box to modify the layout settings, or copy the layout and
modify the new layout.
7. Click the More Options button and change any additional plot options
that you want to.
Refer to Steps 11 through 13 in the section, “Plotting success in 16 steps.” 
8. Click the Preview button, check that the drawing displays on the
paper at the correct orientation and size, right-click and choose Exit
to return to the Plot dialog box.
If you found any problems in the preview, change your plot settings and
Preview again until it looks right.
9. Click OK to create the plot.

Plotting Lineweights and Colors
In previous sections of this chapter I help you gain some plotting confidence.
Those sections show you how to create scaled, monochrome plots with uni-
form lineweights in model space or paper space. Those skills may be all you
need, but if you care about controlling plotted lineweights and colors, or
adding special effects such as screening (plotting shades of gray), read on.
Plotting with style
Plot styles provide a way to override object properties with alternative plot
properties. (See Chapter 4 for information about object properties.) The
properties include plotted lineweight, plotted color, and screening (plotting
shades of gray). Figure 12-7 shows the full range of options. They come in two
exciting flavors:
 Color-dependent plot styles
 Named plot styles
Color-dependent plot styles are based on the standard way of plotting in ear-
lier versions of AutoCAD (before AutoCAD 2000), whereas named plot styles
provide a newer way.
Figure 12-7:

dependent

279
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

It’s remotely possible that you won’t need to bother with plot styles. If the
drawings you want to plot have layer and object properties (especially
lineweight) that reflect how you want objects to plot, you can dispense with
plot styles. But most people and most drawings use plot styles, so you
should at least be familiar with them.
A couple of common reasons for using plot styles are to:
 Map screen colors to plotted lineweights. If this idea seems completely
loony to you, try to suspend judgment until you’ve read the “Plotting
through thick and thin” section, a bit later in this chapter.
 Create screened lines on monochrome plots. Lines that are screened
display in various shades of gray, not black. Drafters sometimes use
screened lines to de-emphasize secondary objects that otherwise would
overwhelm the main objects in the drawing. Screening is expressed as a
percentage, with 100% being completely black and 0% being invisible.
Using plot styles
If you want objects in your drawing to plot with properties that differ from
their display properties, you need plot styles. For example, you can plot with
different lineweights or colors from the ones you’re using for display purposes.
Or, as I mention in the preceding section, you may need to map display colors
to plotted lineweights. AutoCAD groups plot styles into plot style tables, each
of which is stored in a separate file.
Color-dependent plot style tables live in Color TaBle (CTB) files and they map
the 255 AutoCAD display colors to 255 plot styles. AutoCAD automatically
attaches the color-dependent plot styles to every object, based on — you
guessed it — the object’s color. (Are those AutoCAD programmers brilliant, or
what?) Color-dependent plot style tables are especially handy for mimicking
the old color-mapped-to-lineweight plotting approach of AutoCAD R14 and ear-
lier releases; this remains the most common method in most companies.
Named plot style tables live in Style TaBle (STB) files. After you’ve created 
a named plot style table, you create one or more plot styles and give them
any names you like. Then you can assign the named plot styles to layers or 
to individual objects. (See Chapter 4 for more information about object and
layer properties.)
“Named” refers to the plot styles, not to the tables. Both color-dependent
plot style tables and named plot style tables have names because both are
stored in files and files have to have names. But color-dependent plot styles
don’t have names and named plot styles do have names.
To use a plot style table, and its included plot styles (whether they’re color-
dependent or named), you must attach it to model space or a paper space
280
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

layout. The plot style table then affects plotting only for that tab. This approach
lets you plot the same drawing in different ways by attaching different plot
styles to different tabs.
You can attach a plot style to model space or a paper space layout by select-
ing its tab at the bottom of the drawing area, opening the Plot dialog box or
Page Setup dialog box, and choosing the plot style table name in the Plot
Style Table (Pen Assignments) area of the expanded Plot dialog box. See
“Controlling plotted lineweights with screen colors,” later in this chapter, for
an example.
When you start a new drawing in the usual way — that is, by using a template
drawing (see Chapter 3), the template drawing’s plot style behavior determines
whether you can choose CTB or STB files. (That’s why most of AutoCAD’s
stock template drawings come in Color Dependent Plot Styles and Named Plot
Styles versions.) If you want to change from color-dependent plot styles to
named plot styles (or vice versa) in a particular drawing, use the 
CONVERTPSTYLES command.
The Plotting tab on the Options dialog box contains a setting called Default
Plot Style Behavior For New Drawings, but it’s practically useless. It doesn’t
change the current drawing and, despite its name, doesn’t even affect new
drawings that you start from a template drawing.
Creating plot styles
If you’re really lucky, you won’t need to use plot styles. If you’re somewhat
lucky, you’ll need to use plot styles, but someone will provide the plot style
table files for you. If that’s the case, you must put the CTB or STB files in your
Plot Styles folder in order for AutoCAD to recognize them. (To find the loca-
tion of your Plot Styles folder, open the Options dialog box, choose the Files
tab, and look for the Printer Support File Path➪Plot Style Table Search Path
setting.)
If you’re not lucky at all, then you’ll need to be smart — that is, you’ll want to
know how to create your own plot style table files. Here’s how:
1. Choose File➪Plot Style Manager.
The Plot Styles folder opens in a separate window.
2. Double-click the Add-A-Plot Style Table Wizard program shortcut.
3. Read the opening screen and then click Next.
4. Choose the Start From Scratch option, or one of the other three options
if you want to start with settings from another file. Then click Next.
The remaining steps in this procedure assume that you chose Start From
Scratch. If you chose another option, simply follow the wizard’s prompts.
281
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

If the creator of a drawing provides you with an AutoCAD R14/AutoCAD
LT 98 PC2 (version 2) or AutoCAD R12/AutoCAD LT 95 PCP (version 1)
file, choose the Use A PCP Or PC2 File option. With this option, the
wizard imports color-to-plotted-lineweight settings automatically.
5. Choose whether you want to create a color-dependent plot style table
(CTB file) or a named plot style table (STB file). Then click Next.
Choose Color-Dependent Plot Style Table in order to map screen colors
to plotted lineweights. Choose Named Plot Style Table in order to leave
screen colors alone (so that the colors plot as you see them on-screen)
and to create named plot styles that you can apply to layers or objects.
6. Type a name for the new CTB or STB file and then click Next.
7. Click the Plot Style Table Editor button.
The Plot Style Table Editor dialog box opens (refer to Figure 12-7).
8. If you created a color-dependent plot style table, assign Lineweight,
Screening, or other plot properties to each color that’s used in the
drawing. If you created a named plot style table, click the Add Style
button and then assign plot properties to each of the named styles
that you create.
To determine which colors are used in a drawing, switch to the AutoCAD
window and open the Layer Properties Manager dialog box by clicking
the Layers button located on the Object Properties toolbar.
To change a setting for all colors or named styles, select all of them first
by clicking the first color or named style, holding down the Shift key,
scrolling to the end of the list, and then clicking the last color or named
style. Any subsequent changes you make get applied to all the selected
colors or named styles.
9. Click the Save & Close button to close the Plot Style Table Editor
dialog box. Then click Finish to complete the steps for the wizard.
The Plot Styles folder now displays your new CTB or STB file.
10. Close the Plot Styles folder by clicking on the X in its title bar.
Creating your first plot style table can be a harrowing experience, because
you have so many options. Just remember that your most likely reason for
creating one is to map screen colors to plotted lineweights (as I describe in
greater detail in the next section). Also remember that you may be able to
minimize your effort by getting a CTB file from the person who created the
drawing that you want to plot.
In Chapter 4, I recommend that you limit yourself to the first 9 Standard Auto-
CAD Colors when defining layers, and not a patchwork of the 255 colors that
AutoCAD makes available. If you follow my advice, your work to create a color-
dependent plot style table will be much reduced, because you’ll have to assign
plot properties for only 9 colors, rather than worrying about 255 of them.
282
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

You can use \Program Files\AutoCAD 2005\Sample\Plot Screening and Fill
Patterns.dwg for systematic testing of your CTB files. This drawing shows an
array of color swatches for all 255 AutoCAD colors. Some of the other tabs
(such as Grayscale and Screening 25%) also demonstrate how different CTB
files attached to the same layout produce radically different results.
If you really get carried away and decide to take advantage of the 16 million-
odd colors in AutoCAD’s True Color capability, then you’re not going to be
controlling lineweights with color-dependent plot styles. CTB plot styles
affect the lineweights only of objects that use the traditional 255 colors of the
AutoCAD Color Index palette. If you want True Color, use object lineweights
or named plot styles to control plotted lineweight.
Plotting through thick and thin
Long ago, manual drafters developed the practice of drawing lines of different
thicknesses, or lineweights, in order to distinguish different kinds of objects.
Manual drafters did it with different technical ink pen nib diameters or with
different hardnesses of pencil lead and varying degrees of pressure on the
pencil. Because a computer mouse usually doesn’t come with different diam-
eters of mouse balls or a pressure-sensitive button, AutoCAD and its develop-
ers had to figure out how to let users indicate lineweights on-screen and on a
plot. They came up with two different ways to indicate lineweight: 
 Mapping on-screen colors to plotted lineweights. I describe this
common approach in Chapter 4.
 Displaying lineweights on-screen to match what the user can expect to
see on the plot. This approach was introduced in AutoCAD 2000.
Controlling plotted lineweights with object lineweights
Plotting object lineweights is trivial, assuming that the person who created
the drawing took the trouble to assign lineweights to layers or objects (see
Chapter 4 for details). Just make sure that the Plot Object Lineweights setting
in the expanded Plot dialog box is turned on. You may also want to turn off
the Plot With Plot Styles setting, because plot styles can override the object
lineweights with different plotted lineweights.
As long as you turn on the Plot Object Lineweights setting, you’ll find that
(those who hate cheap puns, read no further!) the plot thickens! It also thins,
but that’s not as funny.
If you don’t want to plot the lineweights assigned to objects, you must turn
off both the Plot Object Lineweights and Plot With Plot Styles settings in the
Plot Options area of the Plot dialog box. Turning on Plot With Plot Styles
turns on Plot Object Lineweights as well.
283
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

Controlling plotted lineweights with screen colors
To map screen colors to plotted lineweights, you need a color-dependent plot
style table (CTB file), as I describe in the section “Plotting with style,” earlier
in this chapter. If you’re plotting a drawing created by someone else, that
someone else may be able to supply you with the appropriate CTB file, or at
least with a PCP or PC2 file from which you can create the CTB file quickly. At
the very least, the creator of the drawing should be able to give you a printed
chart showing which plotted lineweight to assign to each AutoCAD screen
color. Use the instructions in the “Plotting with style” section to copy or
create the required CTB file.
Unfortunately, no industry-wide standards exist for mapping screen colors to
plotted lineweights. Different offices do it differently. That’s why it’s so useful
to receive a CTB, PCP, or PC2 file with drawings that someone sends you.
After you have the appropriate CTB file stored in your Plot Styles folder,
follow these steps to use it:
1. Click the tab that you want to plot — the Model tab or the desired
paper space layout tab.
2. Click the Plot button on the Standard toolbar.
3. In the Plot Style Table (Pen Assignments) area on the expanded 
Plot dialog box, select the CTB file from the Name list, as shown in
Figure 12-8.
This action attaches the plot style table (CTB file) to the tab that you
clicked in Step 1.
284
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Plotting with plodders
Color-as-color and lineweight-as-lineweight
seem like great ideas, but Autodesk knew when
it added object lineweights back in 1999 that
longtime users of AutoCAD weren’t going to
abandon the old colors-mapped-to-lineweights
approach overnight. Thus, you can still control
plotted lineweight by display color in AutoCAD.
AutoCAD veterans by and large have chosen to
stick with their Old Way for now. They’ve done
so for a variety of reasons, including inertia,
plotting procedures and drawings built around
the Old Way, third-party applications that don’t
fully support the newer methods, and the 
need to exchange drawings with clients and
subcontractors who haven’t upgraded. In sum-
mary, the ripple effect of those who need to or
want to continue using colors-mapped-to-
lineweights is lasting a long time. Don’t be sur-
prised if you find yourself going with the flow
for awhile.
The default setting in AutoCAD 2005 is to plot
object lineweights, so that’s the easiest method
if you don’t have to consider the historical prac-
tices or predilections of other people with whom
you exchange drawings. Mapping screen colors
to lineweights requires some initial work on your
part, but after you’ve set up the mapping scheme,
the additional effort is minimal.

4. Click the Apply to Layout button.
AutoCAD records the plot setting change with the current tab’s configu-
ration information. Assuming that you save the drawing, AutoCAD uses
the CTB that you selected as the default plot style when you (or other
people) plot that tab in the future.
5. Continue with the plotting procedures described earlier in this chapter.
If your drawing uses a named plot style table instead of a color-dependent
plot style table, you follow the same procedure, except that you select an
STB file instead of a CTB file in Step 3. 
You can tell whether the current drawing was set up to use color-dependent
plot styles or named plot styles by looking at the Properties toolbar. If the
last drop-down list (Plot Style Control) is grayed out, the drawing can use
color-dependent plot styles. If this list is not grayed out, the drawing can use
named plot styles.
Plotting in color
Plotting the colors that you see on-screen requires no special tricks. In the
absence of a plot style table (that is, if you set Plot Style Table (Pen Assign-
ments) to None in the Plot dialog box), AutoCAD sends color information as 
it appears on-screen to the plotter. As long as your output device can plot in
color, what you see should be what you get.

285
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

If you attach a plot style table to the tab that you’re plotting (as described in
the previous section), you can — if you really want to — map screen colors
to different plotted colors. In most cases you don’t want that kind of confu-
sion. Instead, leave the Color property in the plot style table set to Use
Object Color.
If your goal is not to plot color, make sure that you set the Color property for
all plot styles to Black. If you try to plot colors on a monochrome device, you
may find that objects appear in various shades of gray, like in a black and
white newspaper photograph, with lighter colors mapped to lighter shades of
gray and darker colors to darker shades of gray. This process of mapping
colors to shades of gray is called monochrome dithering, and it usually is not
what you want in a CAD drawing. To override it, use the Plot Style Table
Editor, as described in the section “Creating plot styles,” earlier in this chap-
ter, to set the Color option for all colors to Black (the default setting is Use
Object Color). If you don’t already have a plot style table that you want to use,
choose Monochrome.ctb (for color-based plot styles) or Monochrome.stb (for
named plot styles), both of which come with AutoCAD.
286
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
When in doubt, send it out
Whether you plot to scale or not, with different
lineweights or not, in color or not, consider using
a service bureau for some of your plotting. In-
house plotting on your office’s output devices is
great for small check plots on faster laser or inkjet
printers. Large format plotting, on the other hand,
can be slow and time consuming. If you need to
plot lots of drawings, you may find yourself
spending an afternoon loading paper, replenish-
ing ink cartridges, and trimming sheets.
Good plotting service bureaus have big, fast,
expensive plotters that you can only dream about
owning. Also, they’re responsible for babysitting
those fancy devices, feeding them, and fixing
them. As a bonus, service bureaus can make
blueline prints from your plots, if you need to dis-
tribute hard-copy sets to other people.
The only downside is that you need to coordinate
with a service bureau to make sure it gets what it
needs from you and can deliver the kinds of plots
you need. Some service bureaus plot directly
from your DWG files, while others ask you to
make PLT (plot) files. Some service bureaus 
specialize in color plotting, while others are more
comfortable with monochrome plotting and
making blueline copies.
When you’re choosing a service bureau, look for
one that traditionally has served drafters, archi-
tects, and engineers. These service bureaus
tend to be more knowledgeable about AutoCAD,
and they should have more plotting expertise
than the desktop publishing, printing, and copy-
ing shops.
Whomever you choose, do some test plots well
before the day when that important set of draw-
ings is due. Talk to the plotting people and get a
copy of their plotting instructions. Have the ser-
vice bureau create some plots of a couple of
your typical drawings and make sure they look
the way you want them to.
If you do lots of plotting with a service bureau,
look into whether you can charge it to your clients
as an expense (just like bluelines or copying).

To see the full range of AutoCAD colors available on your plotter, or to see
how a particular plot style table affects plotting, plot \Program Files\AutoCAD
2005\Sample\Plot Screening and Fill Patterns.dwg. The Screening 100% layout
in this drawing contains color swatches for all 255 AutoCAD colors.
It’s a (Page) Setup!
Page setups specify the plotter, paper size, and other plot settings that you
use to plot a particular tab of a particular drawing. AutoCAD maintains sepa-
rate page setups for model space and for each paper space model layout
(that is, for each tab you see in the drawing area). When you click the Apply
to Layout button in the Plot dialog box (or turn on the Save Changes to
Layout setting and then click OK to plot), AutoCAD stores the current plot
settings as the page setup for the current tab.
You also can give page setups names and save them. The advantage of doing
so is that you can switch quickly between different plot settings and copy plot
settings from one drawing tab to another. Named page setups are stored with
each drawing, but you can copy them from another drawing into the current
one with the Page Setup Manager dialog box (described later in this section).
If your plotting needs are simple, you don’t need to do anything special with
page setups. In the Plot dialog box, just click the Apply to Layout button or
turn on the Save Changes to Layout setting to save any plotting changes with
the tab you’re plotting.
If you want to get fancier, you can create named page setups in order to plot
the same layout (or the model tab) in different ways, or to copy plot settings
from one tab to another or one drawing to another. Click the Add button in
the Plot dialog box to create a named page setup from the current plot set-
tings. After you create a named page setup, you can restore its plot settings
by choosing it from the Page Setup Name list.
For even greater control, choose File➪Page Setup Manager to create, change,
and copy page setups. In the Page Setup Manager dialog box, shown in Figure
12-9, you can create new page setups and modify existing ones. Click the Modify
button to open the Page Setup dialog box, which is almost identical to the Plot
dialog box. The primary difference is that you’re changing plot settings rather
than actually plotting. The Set Current button copies the page setup that you’ve
selected n the Page Setups list to the current layout tab. With the Import button,
you can copy a layout from another drawing or drawing template (DWT) file.

Continuing the Plot Dialog
In previous sections of this chapter, I cover most of the important options in
the Plot dialog box. This section reveals a few more fine points that will make
your plotting life easier. I don’t cover every minute, obscure, useful-only-at-
cocktail party-discussions detail. I do point out some occasionally useful
options that will increase your vocabulary when you’re communicating with
the Plot dialog box.
Use the Plot dialog box’s quick help to find out more about any part of the
dialog box: 
1. Click the question mark next to the close button in the dialog box’s
title bar. 
2. Point the cursor at the part of the dialog box that confuses you and click. 
3. Click the Help button at the bottom of the dialog box if the pop-up help
isn’t enough.
 Printer/Plotter: As I describe in the section “Configure it out,” earlier in
this chapter, you use the Name list to select the Windows system printer
or nonsystem driver configuration that you want to use for plotting.
The Properties button opens the Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box,
with which you can change media (type of paper) and other properties
that are unique to the currently selected plotter or printer. In particular,
you can define custom paper sizes.

As if AutoCAD’s Plot dialog box settings weren’t overwhelming enough,
some plotter drivers hide important settings in the Plotter Configuration
Editor dialog box, typically behind the Custom Properties button near the
bottom of the dialog box. (For example, if you’re using the HP enhanced
Windows system driver mentioned earlier in this chapter, you can click
the Custom Properties button and then the More Sizes button to specify
which paper sizes are available to you on the Plot Settings tab of the main
Plot dialog box.)
To make matters even more confusing, if you make any changes in the 
Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box, AutoCAD prompts you to save
the changes to a separate PC3 file. You should choose Save Changes
to the Following File (that is, create a new AutoCAD-specific con-
figuration that includes the revised settings) and type a configuration
name that you’ll recognize later. When you want to plot with custom set-
tings, remember to choose the AutoCAD-specific PC3 configuration near
the end of the Plotter Configuration Name list, and not the Windows
system printer configuration near the beginning of the list.
 Plot to File: If you need to plot to a file rather than directly to your plot-
ter or network printer queue, turn on this option. When you click OK to
plot, AutoCAD asks you for a plot file name and location.
This option is especially useful when you want to use the ePlot feature
to publish a DWF file on a Web site. You also may need to create files to
send to a plotting service bureau.
 Plot Stamp On: Use this option to turn on and off and configure the con-
tents of a text string that AutoCAD adds automatically to the corner of
each plot. The plot stamp can include useful information such as the
drawing filename and plot date and time.
 Plot Area: Specify the area of the drawing to plot. Your choices include
Display, Extents, and Window, regardless of whether you’re plotting a
paper space layout or the model space tab. If you defined named views
in the drawing, AutoCAD adds a View option. The additional choice is
Layout for a paper space layout tab or Limits for the model space tab.
• Display means the drawing as it’s currently displayed in the drawing
window (including any white space — or black space — around the
drawing objects). 
• Extents means the rectangular area containing all the objects in the
drawing. 
• Limits means the model space area that you specified (or should
have specified) when you set up the drawing, See Chapter 3 for
details. 
• Window means a rectangular area that you specify.
• View means a named view, which you select from the drop-down
list (Chapter 7 describes named views and how to create them). 
289
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

Usually, you’ll choose to plot Layout in paper space. For model space,
the choice depends on whether the drawing was set up properly and
what you want to plot. If you set limits properly, as I suggest in Chapter 3,
then plot Limits in order to get the whole drawing area. If you’re trying
to plot a drawing in which the limits weren’t set properly, try Extents
instead. Use Window or View if you want to plot just a portion of model
space.
 Plot Offset: A plot offset of X=0 and Y=0 positions the plot at the lower-
left corner of the plottable area. If you want to move the plot from this
default position on the paper, enter nonzero numbers or turn on the
Center the Plot option. (The Center the Plot option is available only
when you haven’t selected Layout from the What to Plot list.)
 Shaded Viewport Options: If your drawing includes viewports showing
shaded or rendered 3D models (see Chapter 8), use this area to control
the plotted appearance.
 Plot Options: The Plot Object Lineweights option and the Plot with Plot
Styles option control whether AutoCAD uses the features described in
the “Plotting with style” and “Plotting through thick and thin” sections
earlier in this chapter.
The Hide Paperspace Objects option controls whether AutoCAD hides
objects that are behind other objects when a 3D model is displayed in a
viewport. If your drawing is entirely 2D, then this option doesn’t matter. If
your drawing includes 3D objects, them turning on this setting is like
applying the 3DOrbit command’s Hidden option, described in Chapter 8,
to the plot.
 Plot Upside-Down: Turn on this setting if you want to rotate the plot 180
degrees on the paper (a handy option for plotting in the southern hemi-
sphere, or for avoiding having to cock your head at an uncomfortable
angle as you watch plots come out of the plotter).
AutoCAD normally generates plots in the foreground — that is, the plotting
process takes over the program for the entire time that the program is creat-
ing the plot. AutoCAD 2005 includes a new background plotting feature that
returns control of the program to you more quickly. If you have a reasonably
fast computer with adequate memory, turn on this feature in the Options
dialog box: Choose Tools➪Options, click the Plot and Publish tab, and turn
on Plotting in the Background Processing Options area.
If you want to automate plotting for a batch of drawings, check out Chapter 15.

Troubles with Plotting
No matter how many times you read this chapter or how carefully you study
the AutoCAD documentation, you’ll occasionally run into plotting problems.
You’re especially likely to encounter problems when trying to plot other
people’s drawings, because you don’t always know what plotting conventions
they had in mind. (Plotting conventions aren’t where spies meet; they’re a
standardized approach to plotting issues.) Table 12-1 describes some of the
more common plotting problems and solutions.

fter you get the lines and text right, you may be justi-
ﬁed in thinking that your work in AutoCAD is done.
But AutoCAD enables you to do so much more! Blocks and
external references help you manage data within draw-
ings, between drawings, and across a network. AutoCAD
2005’s new sheet sets feature bids fair to redeﬁne how
people organize drawings on larger, multisheet projects,
so this section devotes a new chapter to it. If you plan to
share drawings — whether among your own projects, with
people in your ofﬁce, or with folks in other companies,
you need to think about consistency in presentation and
drawing organization — in other words, CAD standards.
The Internet is the biggest ongoing swap meet in human
history, and AutoCAD offers some unique trading possibil-
ities — and potential pitfalls — via e-mail and the Web.

hapter 6 shows you how to copy objects within a drawing or even to
another drawing. That’s one way to use CAD to improve drafting efficiency.
You can copy a DWG file and then modify it to create a similar drawing — an
even better productivity-booster, as long as you’re in the habit of making simi-
lar drawings. But all those are baby steps compared to the techniques that I
cover in this chapter: treating drawings, parts of drawings, and raster images as
reusable and updateable modules. If you want to make drafting production
more efficient with CAD, then you want to know how to use blocks, xrefs, and
raster files.
A block is a collection of objects grouped together to form a single object. You
can insert this collection more than once in the same drawing, and when you
do, all instances of the block remain identical, even after you change the block
definition. Although a block lives within a specific drawing, you can transfer
copies of it into other drawings. You can add fill-in-the-blank text fields called
attributes to blocks.
An external reference, or xref, is like an industrial-strength block. An external
reference is a pointer to a separate drawing outside the drawing you’re work-
ing on. The referenced drawing appears on-screen and on plots as part of
your drawing, but it continues to live as a separate document on your hard
disk. If you edit the externally referenced drawing, the appearance of the
drawing changes in all drawings that reference it.

A raster file (also called a bitmap file) stores a graphical image as a series of
dots. Raster files are good for storing photographs, logos, and other images,
whereas CAD vector files are good for storing geometrical objects such as lines
and arcs, along with text and other annotations for describing the geometry.
Sometimes it’s handy to combine raster images with CAD vector files, and
AutoCAD’s IMage command makes the process straightforward.
Blocks, external references, and raster images enable you to reuse your work
and the work of others, giving you the potential to save tremendous amounts
of time — or to cause tremendous problems if you change a file on which other
peoples’ drawings depend. Use these features when you can to save time, but
do so in an organized and careful way so as to avoid problems.
The way you use blocks and especially xrefs will depend a lot on the profession
and office in which you work. Some disciplines and companies use these draw-
ing organization features heavily and in a highly organized way, while others
don’t. Ask your colleagues what the local customs are and follow them.
Rocking with Blocks
First, a little more block theory and then you can rock right into those blocks.
To use a block in a drawing, you need two things: a block definition and one
or more block inserts. AutoCAD doesn’t always make the distinction between
these two things very clear, but you need to understand the difference to avoid
terminal confusion about blocks. (Maybe this syndrome should be called
blockheadedness?)
A block definition lives in an invisible area of your drawing file called the block
table. (It’s one of those symbol tables that I describe in Chapter 4.) The block
table is like a book of graphical recipes for making different kinds of blocks.
Each block definition is like a recipe for making one kind of block. When you
insert a block, as described later in this chapter, AutoCAD creates a special
object called a block insert. The insert points to the recipe and tells AutoCAD,
“Hey, draw me according to the instructions in this recipe!”
Although a block may look like a collection of objects stored together and
given a name, it’s really a graphical recipe (the block definition) plus one or
more pointers to that recipe (one or more block inserts). Each time you insert
a particular block, you create another pointer to the same recipe.
296
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

The advantages of blocks include:
 Grouping objects together when they belong together logically. You can
draw a screw using lines and arcs, and then make a block definition out of
all these objects. When you insert the screw block, AutoCAD treats it as a
single object for purposes of copying, moving, and so on.
 Saving time and reducing errors. Inserting a block is, of course, much
quicker than redrawing the same geometry again. And the less geometry
you draw from scratch, the less opportunity there is to make a mistake.
 Efficiency of storage when you reuse the same block repeatedly. If you
insert the same screw block 15 times in a drawing, AutoCAD stores the
detailed block definition only once. The 15 block inserts that point to
the block definition take up much less disk space than 15 copies of all
the lines, polylines, and arcs.
 The ability to edit all instances of a symbol in a drawing simply by mod-
ifying a single block definition. This one is the biggie. If you decide that
your design requires a different kind of screw, you simply redefine the
screw’s block definition. With this new recipe, AutoCAD then replaces all
15 screws automatically. That’s a heck of a lot faster than erasing and
recopying 15 screws!
Blocks aren’t as great for drawing elements used in multiple drawings, however,
especially in a situation where several people are working on and sharing parts
of drawings with one another. That’s because blocks, after they get into multi-
ple drawings, stay in each drawing; a later modification to a block definition in
one drawing does not automatically modify all the other drawings that use that
block. If you use a block with your company’s logo in a number of drawings
and then you decide to change the logo, you must make the change within
each drawing that uses the block.
External references enable you to modify multiple drawings from the original
referenced drawing. You can find out more about external references in the
section “Going External,” later in this chapter.
If all you need to do is make some objects into a group so that you can more
easily select them for copying, moving, and so on, use the AutoCAD group fea-
ture. Type Group and press Enter to open the Group Manager dialog box. Then
select some objects, click the Create Group button, and type a name for the
group. When you’re editing drawings containing groups, press Ctrl+H to toggle
“group-ness” on or off. If you’ve toggled “group-ness” on, picking any object
in a group selects all objects in the group. If you’ve toggled it off, picking an
object selects only that object, even if it happens to be a member of a group.
297
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

Creating block definitions
To create a block definition from objects in the current drawing, use the Block
Definition dialog box. (The other way to create a block definition is by inserting
another drawing file into your current drawing as a block, which I explain in the
next section.) The following steps show you how to create a block definition
using the Block Definition dialog box:
1. Click the Make Block button on the Draw toolbar.
The Block Definition dialog box appears (see Figure 13-1).
Layers matter when you create the objects that makes up a block. Block
geometry created on most layers retains the characteristics, such as color
and linetype, of those layers. But if you create a block using geometry on
Layer 0, that geometry has no characteristics, such as color and linetype
of its own; chameleonlike, it takes on the features of the layer into which
it’s inserted.
2. Type the block definition’s name in the Name text entry box.
If you type the name of an existing block definition, AutoCAD replaces that
block definition with the new group of objects you select. This process is
called block redefinition.
To see a list of the names of all the current blocks in your drawing, pull
down the Name list.

3. Specify the base point, also known as the insertion point, of the block,
using either of the following methods:
• Enter the coordinates of the insertion point in the X, Y, and Z text
boxes.
• Click the Pick Point button and then select a point on the screen.
(In this case, use an object snap or other precision technique, as
described in Chapter 4, to grab a specific point on one of the block’s
objects.)
The base point is the point on the block by which you insert it later, as I
describe in the next section.
Use an obvious and consistent point on the group of objects for the base
point, such as the lower-left corner, so that you know what to expect when
you insert the block.
4. Click the Select Objects button and then select the objects that you want
as part of the block.
AutoCAD uses the selected objects to create a block definition. Figure 13-2
shows the base point and group of selected objects during the process of
creating a new block definition.

5. Click a radio button to tell AutoCAD what to do with the objects used
to define the block: Retain them in place, Convert them into a block
instance, or Delete them.
The default choice, Convert To Block, is usually the best. See Step 9 for a
description of what happens with each choice.
6. Choose Create Icon From Block Geometry in the Preview Icon area.
Go ahead and create the icon; it will help you and others find the right
block to use later.
7. Specify the Insert units to which the block will be scaled in the Drag-
and-Drop Units drop-down menu.
When you or someone else drags the block from one drawing into another
via the DesignCenter palette (see Chapter 4) or Tool Palette (described
later in this chapter), the units you specify here and the units of the draw-
ing you’re dragging into will control the default insertion scale factor.
8. Enter the block Description.
Now is the time to think like a database manager and enter a useful
description that will identify the block to yourself and others.
9. Click OK to complete the block definition process.
If you typed the name of an existing block definition in Step 2, AutoCAD
warns you that you’ll redefine that block definition. Click Yes to redefine,
which will update all instances of the block in the current drawing to
match the changed block definition.
AutoCAD stores the block definition in the current drawing’s block table. If
you chose the Convert To Block radio button (the default) in Step 5, Auto-
CAD also creates a block insert pointing to the new block definition — the
objects look the same on-screen, but now they’re an instance of the block
rather than existing as separate objects. If you chose the Retain radio
button, the objects remain in place but aren’t converted into a block
insert — they stay individual objects with no connection to the new block
definition. If you chose the Delete radio button, the objects disappear
(but the block definition still gets created).
You can include in a block definition a special kind of variable text object called
an attribute definition. When you insert a block that contains one or more
attribute definitions, AutoCAD prompts you to fill in values for the text fields.
Attributes are useful for variable title block information (sheet number, sheet
title, and so on) and symbols that contain different codes or call-outs. I
describe how to create and use attribute definitions later in this chapter.

Keep your common symbol drawings in one or more specific folders that you
set aside just for that purpose. You may want use one of the following tech-
niques to develop a block library of symbols that you use frequently:
 Create a separate DWG file for each symbol (using WBLOCK, or simply
by drawing each one in a new drawing). 
 Store a bunch of symbols as block definitions in one drawing and use
DesignCenter to import block definitions from this drawing when you
need them. 
Inserting blocks
AutoCAD provides a number of ways to insert a block, but the most com-
monly used and most flexible is the Insert dialog box. Here’s the procedure
for inserting a block:
1. Set an appropriate layer current, as described in Chapter 4.
It’s a good idea to insert each block on a layer that has something to do
with its geometry or purpose: 
• If all the objects in the block definition reside on one layer, then it’s
usually best to insert the block on that layer. 
• If the block geometry spans several layers, choose one of them to
insert the block on.
301
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids
BLOCK and WBLOCK
The Block command, which opens the Block
Definition dialog box, is great for use within a
drawing, but what if you want to use the block
definition in multiple drawings? The easiest
method is to use DesignCenter to copy a block
definition from one drawing to another, as
described in Chapter 4.
Another method involves the WBLOCK and
Insert commands. I don’t cover this method
here, because it’s less intuitive than using
DesignCenter. But you may hear AutoCAD
drafters talk about “wblocking” part of a draw-
ing. So that you can keep these block-y names
straight:
 The Block command creates a block defin-
ition from objects in the current drawing.
 The WBLOCK command creates a new
DWG file from objects in the current draw-
ing, or from a block definition in the current
drawing.

If any of the block definition’s geometry was created on layer 0, then that
geometry will inherit the color, linetype, and other object properties of
the layer that you insert the block on. It’s like the chameleon changing
color to match its surroundings or a politician changing his position to
match the day’s opinion polls.
2. Click the Insert Block button on the Draw toolbar.
The Insert dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-3.
3. Enter the block definition name or external filename by using one of
the following methods:
• Use the Name drop-down list to select from a list of block definitions
in the current drawing.
• Click the Browse button to select an external DWG file and have
AutoCAD create a block definition from it.
You can use an external drawing to replace a block definition in your cur-
rent drawing. If you click Browse and choose a file whose name matches
the name of a block definition that’s already in your drawing, AutoCAD
warns you and then updates the block definition in your drawing with
the current contents of the external file. This process is called block
redefinition, and as described in Steps 2 and 9 in the preceding section,
AutoCAD automatically updates all the block inserts that point to the
block definition.
4. Enter the insertion point, scale, and rotation angle of the block.
You can either click the Specify On-Screen check box in each area, to spec-
ify the parameters on-screen at the command prompt, or type the values
you want in the Insertion Point, Scale, and Rotation text boxes.
Check the Uniform Scale check box to constrain the X, Y, and Z scaling
parameters to the same value (which in almost all cases you want).
Figure 13-3:
The Insert
dialog box.
302
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

5. If you want AutoCAD to create a copy of the individual objects in the
block instead of a block insert that points to the block definition, click
the Explode check box.
6. Click OK.
7. If you checked Specify On-Screen for the insertion point, scale, or
rotation angle, answer the prompts on the command line to specify
these parameters.
After you insert a block, all the objects displayed in the block insert behave
as a single object. When you select any object in the block insert, AutoCAD
highlights all the objects in it.
Another way to insert a block is to drag a DWG file’s name from Windows
Explorer and drop it anywhere in the current drawing window. AutoCAD then
prompts you to choose an insertion point and optionally change the default
scale factor and rotation angle. Similarly, you can drag a block definition’s
name from the Blocks section of the DesignCenter palette and drop it into the
current drawing window. (Chapter 4 describes DesignCenter.)
AutoCAD provides one additional way of inserting blocks: the Tool Palette,
which is described in Chapter 2. As is true of using Tool Palette for hatching
(Chapter 11), you first must create and configure appropriate tools — that is,
swatches. The easiest method is right-clicking a drawing in DesignCenter and
choosing Create Tool Palette. A new page is added to the Tool Palette area con-
taining all the block definitions from the drawing that you right-clicked. Simply
click and drag a tool to insert its corresponding block into a drawing. As with
hatching, you don’t get the chance to specify a different insertion scale. You
also can’t use all of AutoCAD’s precision tools to specify the insertion point
precisely, so you may need to move the block into place after inserting it. I
recommend that you first master the other block insertion methods described
in this chapter — especially the Insert dialog box and DesignCenter palette.
Then if you find yourself inserting the same blocks frequently, consider creat-
ing a Tool Palette containing them. See “tool palettes, adding drawings from” in
the AutoCAD online help system for more information.
Be careful when inserting one drawing into another. If the host (or parent)
drawing and the inserted (or child) drawing have different definitions for
layers that share the same name, the objects in the child drawing takes on
the layer characteristics of the parent drawing. For example, if you insert a
drawing with lines on a layer called Walls that’s blue and dashed into a draw-
ing with a layer called Walls that’s red and continuous, the inserted lines on
the wall layer will turn red and continuous after they’re inserted. The same
rules apply to linetypes, text styles, dimension styles, and block definitions
that are nested inside the drawing you’re inserting.
303
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

If you need to modify a block definition after you’ve inserted one or more
instances of it, use the REFEDIT command (Modify➪Xref and Block Editing➪
Edit Reference In-Place). Look up “REFEDIT” in the AutoCAD online help
system.
Attributes: Fill-in-the-blank blocks
You may think of attributes as the good (or bad) qualities of your significant
other, but in AutoCAD, attributes are fill-in-the-blank text fields that you can
add to your blocks. When you create a block definition and then insert it sev-
eral times in a drawing, all the ordinary geometry (lines, circles, regular text
strings, and so on) in all the instances are exactly identical. Attributes pro-
vide a little more flexibility in the form of text strings that can be different in
each block insert.
For example, suppose that you frequently designate parts in your drawings
by labeling them with a distinct number or letter in a circle for each part. If
you want to create a block for this symbol, you can’t simply draw the number
or letter as regular text using the mText or TEXT command. If you create a
block definition with a regular text object (for example, the letter A), the text
string will be the same in every instance of the block (always the letter A).
That’s not much help in distinguishing the parts!
Instead, you create an attribute definition, which acts as a placeholder for a text
string that can vary each time you insert the block. You include the attribute
definition when you create the block definition (as I demonstrate in the “Creat-
ing block definitions” section earlier in this chapter). Then each time you insert
the block, AutoCAD prompts you to fill in an attribute value for each attribute
definition.
The AutoCAD documentation and dialog boxes often use the term attribute to
refer indiscriminately to an attribute definition or an attribute value. I attribute
a lot of the confusion about attributes to this sloppiness. Just remember that
an attribute definition is the text field or placeholder in the block definition,
while an attribute value is the specific text string that you type when you insert
the block.
If you’ve worked with databases, the correspondences in Table 13-1 between
AutoCAD objects (blocks and attributes) and database terminology may help
you understand the concept.

Attribute definitions
You use the Attribute Definition dialog box to create attribute definitions
(clever, huh?). The procedure is similar to creating a text string, except that
you must supply a little more information. Create attribute definitions with
the following steps:
1. Change to the layer on which you want to create the attribute definition.
2. Choose Draw➪Block➪Define Attributes to run the ATTDEF command.
The Attribute Definition dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-4.
You rarely need to use any of the Mode settings (Invisible, Constant,
Verify, or Preset). Just leave them unchecked. If you’re curious about
what the modes do, use the dialog box help to find out more.
3. In the Attribute area, type the Tag (database field name), Prompt (user
prompt), and Value (default value).
The Tag can’t contain any spaces. The Prompt and Value fields may con-
tain spaces.

Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

Attribute values can include AutoCAD 2005’s new automatically updating
fields, such as date, filename, or system variable setting. Click the Insert
Field button to the right of the Value text box to insert a field. See the
“mText plays the field” section in Chapter 9 for more information.
4. In the Text Options area, specify the Justification, Text Style, Height,
and Rotation.
The text properties for attribute definitions are the same as those for
single-line text objects — see Chapter 9.
5. Choose the Pick Point button and choose an insertion point for the
attribute definition.
An attribute definition’s insertion point is like a text string’s base point.
Remember to use snap, object snap, or another precision tool if you want
the eventual attribute values to be located at a precise point.
6. Click OK to create the attribute definition.
7. Repeat Steps 1 through 6 for any additional attribute definitions.
If you need to create a series of similar attribute definitions, create the
first one using Steps 1 through 6. Then copy the first attribute definition
and edit the copy with the Properties palette.
Block definition containing attribute definitions
After you create one or more attribute definitions — and any other geometry
that you want to include in the block — you’re ready to create a block defini-
tion that contains them. Follow the steps in the section, “Creating block defin-
itions,” earlier in this chapter.
At Step 4 in the section, “Creating block definitions,” select any attribute defi-
nitions first before you select the other geometry. Select each attribute defini-
tion one-by-one (clicking on each attribute definition rather than selecting
multiple attributes with a selection window), in the order that you want the
attribute value prompts to appear in the Enter/Edit Attributes dialog box (see
Figure 13-5). If you don’t select the attributes one by one, your block and attrib-
utes will still work, but the order of the attribute prompts in the Enter/Edit
Attributes dialog box may not be what you want.
You can use the Block Attribute Manager (choose Modify➪Object➪Attribute➪
Block Attribute Manager) to reorder the attribute definitions in a block defini-
tion. You also can use this dialog box to edit other attribute definition settings,
such as the prompt, text style, or layer. If you get tired of traversing four menu
picks to get to this command, you can type the command name — BATTMAN
(Block ATTribute MANager) — instead. I suppose it’s only a matter of time
before Autodesk adds a ROBIN (ReOrder Block INsert) command. . . .

Attributes are particularly useful for creating a title block. Use regular AutoCAD
commands, including mText or TEXT, to draw the parts of the title block that
will remain the same in all drawings. Then use ATTDEF to create an attribute
for each text string in the drawing that might change on different sheets.
Insert a block containing attribute definitions
After you create a block definition that contains attribute definitions, you insert
it just like any other block. Follow the steps in the section, “Inserting blocks,”
earlier in this chapter. At the end of the steps, AutoCAD should display the
Enter Attributes dialog box, shown in Figure 13-5. The dialog box contains one
row for each of the attribute definitions and has any default values filled in. You
simply edit the values and then click OK.
The ATTDIA (ATTribute DIAlog box) system variable controls whether Auto-
CAD prompts for attribute values in a dialog box (ATTDIA=1) or at the com-
mand line (ATTDIA=0). If you insert a block and see command line prompts
for each attribute value, type a value and press Enter for each attribute value.
When you return to the Command: prompt, type ATTDIA, press Enter, type 1,
and press Enter again. When you insert blocks with attributes in this drawing
in the future, AutoCAD displays the Edit Attributes dialog box instead of
prompting you at the command line.
Edit attribute values
After you insert a block that contains attributes, you can edit the individual
attributes in that block insert with the EATTEDIT command (Enhanced
ATTtribute EDIT — nothing to do with eating). Choose Modify➪Object➪
Attribute➪Single and click on any object in the block insert. AutoCAD displays
the Enhanced Attribute Editor dialog box with the current attribute values, as
Figure 13-5:
The Enter
Attributes
dialog box.
307
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

shown in Figure 13-6. The most common attribute editing operation is to edit
the text value — that is, the text string that appears in the block insert. You
also can change properties of the attributes, such as layer and text style.
Many people use attributes in the way I’ve described so far — as fill-in-the-
blank text fields in blocks. But attributes also can serve as data extraction
tools. For example, you can export attribute values, such as part numbers and
quantities, to a text, spreadsheet, or database file for analysis or reporting. The
Attribute Extraction wizard (Tools➪Attribute Extraction) makes the process
fairly straightforward. If you’re hungry to find out more, look up “EATTEXT
(Enhanced ATTribute EXTtract) command” in the AutoCAD online help system.
Exploding blocks
The objects in each block insert act like a well-honed marching squadron: If
you move or otherwise edit one object in the block insert, all objects move or
change in the same way. Usually this cohesion is an advantage, but occasion-
ally you need to break up the squadron in order to modify one object without
affecting the others.
To explode a block insert into individual objects, click Explode (the firecracker
button) on the Edit toolbar and then select the block insert. When you explode
a block insert, AutoCAD replaces it with all the objects — lines, polylines, arcs,
and so on — specified in the block definition. You then can edit the objects or
perhaps use them to make more block definitions.
Don’t make a habit of exploding blocks cavalierly, especially if you’re working
in someone else’s drawing and aren’t sure why the objects are organized as
blocks. Most people use blocks for a reason, and if you go around exploding
them left and right, you’re likely to be treated the same way that anyone who
blows up a lot of things gets treated.

Attribute
Editor dialog

If you explode a block that contains attributes, the attribute values change
back to attribute definitions. This usually isn’t the sort of change that you want.
If you really need to explode the block insert, you’ll probably want to erase
the attribute definitions and draw regular text strings in their place. If you’ve
installed the AutoCAD Express Tools, you can perform this task automatically
with the BURST command (Express➪Blocks➪Explode Attributes to Text).
Going External
In AutoCAD, an xref, or external reference, is a reference to another, external
file — one outside the current drawing — that you can make act as though
it’s part of your drawing. Technically, a reference is simply a pointer from one
file to another. The xref is the actual pointer, but many people call the combi-
nation of the pointer and the external file the xref.
Drawings that you include as xrefs in other drawings often are called child draw-
ings. Drawings that contain pointers to the child drawings are called parent
drawings. This family terminology gets a little weird when you realize that a
309
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids
Purging unused block definitions
Each block definition slightly increases the size
of your DWG file, as do other named objects
such as layers, text styles, and dimension styles.
If you delete (or explode) all the block inserts that
point to a particular block definition, then that
block definition no longer serves any purpose.
You should run the PUrge command periodically
in each drawing and purge unused block defin-
itions and other named objects. Choose File➪
Drawing Utilities➪Purge to display the Purge
dialog box, as shown in the figure. Click the
Purge All button in order to purge all unused
named objects in the current drawing.

child drawing can have lots of parent drawings that refer to it — apparently it’s
the commune version of family relations. If you find such relationships odd, you
can, like the AutoCAD online help system, refer to the parent drawing as the
host drawing. I prefer the terms parent and child, in part because they’re easily
extendable to describing more complex hierarchies, such as a parent draw-
ing, which xrefs a child drawing, which in turn xrefs a grandchild drawing.
Xrefs have a big advantage over blocks: If you change a child drawing, AutoCAD
automatically loads the change into all the parent drawings that reference the
child drawing.
AutoCAD loads all xrefs into the parent drawing each time the parent drawing
is opened. If the child drawing has been changed, AutoCAD automatically
incorporates those changes into the parent drawing.
When you open a drawing containing xrefs, AutoCAD 2004 displays a little
symbol (which looks like papers with a binder clip) on the right end of the
status bar. This symbol alerts you to the fact that some of the things you see
in the drawing are actually parts of other, xrefed drawings. If an xref changes
while you have the parent drawing open (because you or someone else opens
and saves the child drawing), the status bar xref symbol displays an External
Reference Files Have Changed balloon notification. (If you want to change
whether the notifications appear and how often AutoCAD checks for changes,
look up XREFNOTIFY and XNOTIFYTIME in the online help.) You can use the
Reload option in the Xref Manager dialog box to show the updated xrefs. See
the “Managing xrefs” section later in this chapter for details.
Another advantage of xrefs over blocks is that their contents aren’t stored in
your drawing even once. The disk storage space taken up by the original draw-
ing (that is, the xref) isn’t duplicated, no matter how many parent drawings ref-
erence it. This characteristic makes xrefs much more efficient than blocks for
larger drawings that are reused several times.
But you can always buy more hard disk space, so the storage issue isn’t cru-
cial. The key benefit of xrefs is that they enable you to organize your drawings
in a modular way so that changes you make to a single drawing file automati-
cally “ripple through” all the parent drawings to which it’s xrefed. This benefit
is even greater on larger projects involving multiple drafters, each of whose
work may be incorporated in part or in whole in the work of others.
The automatic update feature of xrefs is a big advantage only if you’re orga-
nized about how you use xrefs. Suppose that an architect creates a plan draw-
ing showing a building’s walls and other major features that are common to
the architectural, structural, plumbing, and electrical plan drawings. The archi-
tect then tells the structural, plumbing, and electrical drafters to xref this back-
ground plan into their drawings, so that everyone is working from a consistent
and reusable set of common plan elements. If the architect decides to revise
310
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

the wall locations and updates the xrefed drawing, everyone will see the cur-
rent wall configuration and be able to change their drawings. But if the archi-
tect absent-mindedly adds architecture-specific objects, such as toilets and
furniture, to the xrefed drawing, or shifts all the objects with respect to 0,0,
everyone else will have problems. If different people in your office share xrefs,
create a protocol for who is allowed to modify which file when, and what com-
munication needs to take place after a shared xref is modified.
Becoming attached to your xrefs
Attaching an external reference is similar to inserting a block, and almost as
easy. Just use the following steps:
1. Set an appropriate layer current, as described in Chapter 4.
I recommend that you insert xrefs on a separate layer from all other
objects. Note that if you freeze the layer an xref is inserted on, the entire
xref disappears. (This behavior can be either a handy trick or a nasty
surprise.)
2. Choose Insert➪Xref Manager from the menu bar to start the XRef
command.
The Xref Manager dialog box appears (see Figure 13-7).
Don’t choose Insert➪External Reference. This menu choice jumps ahead
to Step 4, which will be confusing at this point.
3. Click Attach.
The Select Reference File dialog box appears.
Figure 13-7:
The Xref
Manager
dialog box.
311
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

4. Browse to find the file you want to attach, select it, and then click Open.
The External Reference dialog box appears.
5. Specify the parameters for the xref in the dialog box.
Parameters include the insertion point, scaling factors, and rotation angle.
You can set these parameters in the dialog box or specify them on-screen,
just as you can do when inserting a block, as described earlier in this
chapter.
You can choose the Attachment or Overlay radio button to tell AutoCAD
how to handle the xref. The choice matters only if you create a drawing
that uses xrefs, and then your drawing is in turn used as an xref. Attach-
ment is the default choice, and it means that the xrefed file will always
be included with your drawing when someone else uses your drawing as
an xref. Overlay, the other choice, means that you see the xrefed draw-
ing, but someone who xrefs your drawing won’t see the overlaid file. By
choosing Overlay, you can xref in a map, for example, to your drawing of
a house, but not have the map show up when someone else xrefs your
house drawing. (That person can xref the map, if need be.) I recommend
that you use the default Attachment reference type unless you have a
specific reason to do otherwise.
The Path Type drop-down list provides more flexibility in how the xref’s
path gets stored. See the “Forging an xref path” section later in this
chapter for more information. For now, I recommend that you choose
Relative path instead of the default Full path.
6. Click OK.
The externally referenced file appears in your drawing.
Layer-palooza
When you attach or overlay an xref, AutoCAD adds new layers to your current
drawing that correspond to the layers in the xrefed DWG file. The new layers
are assigned names that combine the drawing name and layer name; for
example, if you xref the drawing MYSCREW.DWG, which has the layer names
GEOMETRY, TEXT, and so on, the xrefed layers will be named MYSCREW|
GEOMETRY, MYSCREW|TEXT, and so on. By creating separate layers corre-
sponding to each layer in the xrefed file, AutoCAD eliminates the potential
problem I warned you about with blocks when layers have the same name
but different color or linetype in the two drawings.
AutoCAD also creates new linetypes, text styles, dimension styles, and 
block definitions for each of these items in the xrefed file — for example,
MYSCREW|DASHED, MYSCREW|NOTES, MYSCREW|A-DIMS, and
MYSCREW|LOGO.

Creating and editing an 
external reference file
To create a file that you can use as an external reference, just create a drawing
and save it (or use the WBLOCK command to create a new DWG from geometry
in the current drawing). That’s it. You then can create or open another drawing
and create an external reference to the previous one. The xrefed drawing
appears in your parent drawing as a single object, like a block insert. In other
words, if you click any object in the xref, AutoCAD selects the entire xref. You
can measure or object snap to the xrefed geometry, but you can’t modify or
delete individual objects in the xref — you open the xref drawing in order to
edit its geometry.
AutoCAD 2004’s XOPEN command (Modify➪Xref and Block Editing➪Open
Reference) provides a quick way to open an xrefed drawing for editing. You
just start the command and pick on any object in the xref. Alternatively, you
can use the Open button in the Xref Manager dialog box to open one or more
xrefs for editing. See the “Managing xrefs” section later in this chapter for
more information.
An alternative to opening the xrefed file when you need to edit it is to use the
REFEDIT command (Modify➪Xref and Block Editing➪Edit Reference In-Place).
Look up “REFEDIT” in the AutoCAD online help system.
Forging an xref path
When you attach an xref, AutoCAD by default stores the xref’s full path — that
is, the drive letter and sequence of folders and subfolders in which the DWG
file resides, along with the filename. This default behavior corresponds to the
Full path setting in the Path Type drop-down list. (Figure 13-8 shows the
three xref path options.) Full path works fine as long as you never move files
on your hard disk or network and never send your DWG files to anyone else —
which is to say, it almost never works fine!
At the other end of the path spectrum, the No path option causes AutoCAD
not to store any path with the xref attachment — only the filename is stored.
This is the easiest and best option if the parent and child drawings reside in
the same folder.
If you prefer to organize the DWG files for a particular project in more then one
folder, then you’ll appreciate AutoCAD’s Relative path option, shown in
Figure 13-8. This option permits xrefing across more complex, hierarchical
folder structures, but avoids many of the problems that Full path can cause.
313
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

For example, you may have a parent drawing H:\Project-X\Plans\First floor.dwg
that xrefs H:\Project-X\Common\Column grid.dwg. If you choose Relative
path, AutoCAD will store the xref path as ..\ Common\Column grid.dwg
instead of H:\Project-X\Common\Column grid.dwg. Now if you decide to
move the \Project-X folder and its subfolders to a different drive (or send
them to someone else who doesn’t have an H: drive), AutoCAD will still be
able to find the xrefs.
When you use Relative path, you’ll see xref paths that include the special
codes . and .. (single and double period). The single period means “this
parent drawing’s folder” and the double period means “the folder above 
this parent drawing’s folder” (in other words, the folder of which the parent
drawing’s folder is a subfolder).
You can report on and change xref paths for a set of drawings with the
AutoCAD Reference Manager. See Chapter 16 for more information.
If all these path options and periods have got you feeling punchy, you can
keep your life simple by always keeping parent and child drawings in the same
folder and using the No path option when you attach xrefs.
Managing xrefs
The Xref Manager dialog box includes many more options for managing xrefs
after you attach them. Important dialog box options include:

 List of external references: You can change between a List and a Tree
view of your drawing’s external references just by clicking the appropri-
ate button at the top of the dialog box. You also can resize the columns
by dragging the column dividers or re-sort the list by clicking the column
header names, just as in other Windows dialog boxes.
 Detach: Completely removes the selected reference to the external file
from your drawing.
 Reload: Causes AutoCAD to reread the selected xrefed DWG file from the
disk and update your drawing with its latest contents. This feature is
handy when you share xrefs on a network and someone has just made
changes to a drawing that you’ve xrefed.
 Unload: Makes the selected xref disappear from the on-screen display
of your drawing and from any plots you do of it, but retains the pointer
and attachment information. Use the Reload button to redisplay an
unloaded xref.
 Bind: Brings the selected xref into your drawing and makes it a block.
You might use this function, for example, to “roll up” a complex set of
xrefs into a single archive drawing.
In many offices, binding xrefs without an acceptable reason for doing so
is a crime as heinous as exploding blocks indiscriminately. In both cases,
you’re eliminating an important data management link. Find out what
the policies are in your company. When in doubt, keep yourself out of a
bind. And even when you do have a good reason to bind, you generally
should do it on a copy of the parent drawing.
 Open: Opens one or more xref drawings in separate drawing windows
after you close the Xref Manager dialog box. After you edit and save an
xref drawing, return to the parent drawing and use the Reload option in
the Xref Manager dialog box to show the changes.
None of these options (other than opening and editing the xref) affects the
xrefed drawing itself; it continues to exist as a separate DWG file. If you need to
delete or move the DWG file that the xref refers to, do it in Windows Explorer.
The fact that the xrefed drawing is a separate file is a potential source of prob-
lems when you send your drawing to someone else; that someone else needs
all the files that your drawing depends on, or it will be useless to the receiving
party. Make sure to include xrefed files in the package with your drawing. See
Chapter 16 for a procedure.
AutoCAD (but not AutoCAD LT) includes an additional xref feature called xref
clipping. You can use the XCLIP command to clip an externally referenced file
so only part of it appears in the parent drawing. AutoCAD LT doesn’t include
the XCLIP command, but if you open a drawing containing an xref that was
clipped in AutoCAD, the clipped view will be preserved.
315
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

Blocks, Xrefs, and Drawing Organization
Blocks and xrefs are useful for organizing sets of drawings to use and update
repeated elements . It’s not always clear, though, when to use blocks and
when to use xrefs. Applications for xrefs include
 The parts of a title block that are the same on all sheets in a project.
 Reference elements that need to appear in multiple drawings (for exam-
ple, wall outlines, site topography, column grids).
 Assemblies that are repeated in one or more drawings, especially if 
the assemblies are likely to change together (for example, repeated
framing assemblies, bathroom layouts, modular furniture layouts).
 Pasting up several drawings (for example, details or a couple of plans)
onto one plot sheet.
 Temporarily attaching a background drawing for reference or tracing.
On the other hand, blocks remain useful in simpler circumstances. Situations
in which you might stick with a block are:
 Components that aren’t likely to change.
 Small components.
 A simple assembly that’s used repeatedly, but in only one drawing. (You
can easily update a block in one drawing with the REDEFIT command.)
 When you want to include attributes (variable text fields) that you can fill
in each time you insert a block. Blocks let you include attribute defini-
tions; xrefs don’t.
Everyone in a company or workgroup should aim for consistency in when
and how they use blocks and xrefs. Check whether guidelines exist for using
blocks and xrefs in your office. If so, follow them; if not, it would be a good
idea to develop some guidelines. Chapter 15 discusses how to start such
guidelines.
Mastering the Raster
AutoCAD includes another xreflike feature: the ability to attach raster images
to drawings. This feature is useful for adding a raster logo to a drawing title
block or placing a photographed map or scene behind a drawing. A raster, or
bitmapped, image is one that’s stored as a field of tiny points.
316
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

Most AutoCAD drawings are vector images. A vector image is an image defined
by storing geometrical definitions of a bunch of objects. Typical objects include
a line, defined by its two endpoints, and a circle, defined by its center point and
radius. Vector-based images are typically smaller (in terms of the disk space
they occupy) and more flexible than raster images, but also are less capable of
displaying visually rich images such as photographs.
Raster images often come from digital cameras or other programs, such as
Photoshop. Raster images also can come into the computer from some kind
of scanner that imports a blueline print, photograph, or other image.
Whether you’re doing your scanning yourself or having a service bureau do it
for you, you need to know that AutoCAD handles most of the popular image file
formats including the Windows BMP format, the popular Web graphics formats
GIF and JPEG, the popular PCX and TIFF formats, as well as DIB, FLC, FLI, GP4,
MIL, PNG, RLE, RST, and TGA.
Here are three scenarios to incorporate raster images in your drawing:
 Small stuff: You can add logos, special symbols, and other small images
that you have in raster files.
 Photographs and maps: You can add photographs (such as a future build-
ing site) and maps (for example, showing the project location).
 Vectorization: To convert a raster image into a vector drawing by tracing
lines in the raster image, you can attach the raster image in your draw-
ing, trace the needed lines by using AutoCAD commands, then detach the
raster image. (This procedure is okay for a simple raster image; add-on
software is available, from Autodesk and others, to support automatic or
semiautomatic vectorization of more complex images.)
Using raster images is much like using external references. The raster image
isn’t stored with your drawing file; a reference to the raster image file is
established from within your drawing, like an xref. You can clip the image and
control its size, brightness, contrast, fade, and transparency. These controls
fine-tune the appearance of the raster image on-screen and on a plot.
When you attach raster images, you have to make sure that you send the
raster files along when you send your drawing to someone else.
AutoCAD LT can open, view, and plot drawings containing attached raster
images, but LT can’t do the attaching. Raster masters require full AutoCAD.

Attaching an image
Follow these steps to bring a raster image into AutoCAD:
1. Choose Insert➪Image Manager from the menu bar or type IMage at the
command line to start the IMage command.
The Image Manager dialog box appears (see Figure 13-9).
2. Click the Attach button.
The Select Image File dialog box appears.
3. Browse to find the file you want to attach, select it, then click Open.
The Image dialog box appears.
Click the Details button in the Image dialog box to see more information
about the resolution and image size of the image you’re attaching.
4. Specify the parameters for the attached image in the dialog box.
Parameters include the insertion point, scale factor, and rotation angle.
You can set these parameters in the dialog box or specify them on-screen,
similar to what you can do with blocks and external references, as
described earlier in this chapter. Use the quick dialog box help (click the
question mark in the dialog box’s title bar and then click the area in the
dialog box for which you want help) or click the dialog box’s Help button
to find out more about specific options.
The AutoCAD 2005 IMage command includes the same Full path,
Relative path, and No path options that debuted for xrefs in
AutoCAD 2004. (See “Forging an xref path” earlier in this chapter.)
Figure 13-9:

5. Click OK.
The image appears in your drawing.
6. If you need to ensure that the raster image floats behind other objects
in the drawing, select the raster image, right-click, choose Draw Order,
and then choose Send to Back.
The DRaworder command provides additional options for which objects
appear on top of which other objects. If you need this kind of flexibility,
look up “DRAWORDER command” in the AutoCAD online help system.
Managing images
You manage the images in your drawing with the Image Manager dialog box.
It includes virtually the same options as the External References dialog box.
You can view a list of image files that appear in the current drawing, detach
(remove) image references, and unload and reload images when needed. You
can’t bind an image to your drawing; it always remains an external file.
You can clip images so that only part of the image is displayed in your draw-
ing. Choose Modify➪Clip➪Image and follow the prompts to clip the image. You
can have multiple overlapping or distinct pieces of any number of images in
your drawing, and only the parts you need are loaded into memory when you
have your drawing open.
Raster image files often are larger than DWG files of corresponding complex-
ity; raster file size can affect performance within AutoCAD, because the raster
file loads into memory when you are working on your drawing. Some work-
arounds speed up operations:
 Attach raster images late in the production process. 
 Create a lower-resolution version of the raster file, just large enough to
create the desired effect in your drawing.
 Use the Unload button in the Image Manager dialog box to temporarily
disable an image without losing the attachment information.
In addition, raster files can increase the time that AutoCAD takes to generate
plots (and the plot file sizes) dramatically. Before you settle on using large
raster files in your AutoCAD drawing, do some testing on zooming, editing,
and plotting.

Sheet Sets without Regrets
In This Chapter
 Understanding resource drawings, views, and sheets
 Creating and using sheet sets
 Adding drawings and assembling views
 Adding a sheet list table
A
typical AutoCAD project can include dozens of drawings, scores of
sheets, lots of layouts, copious cross-drawing references, and more than
a few people working on those components at once. How do you create,
manage, update, plot, and generally keep a handle on all that stuff without
going crazy? The new sheets sets feature in AutoCAD 2005 is Autodesk’s
response to this challenge.
Without sheet sets, you must manage project drawings “manually” — that is,
you have to make sure that all the project’s drawings get created, get num-
bered and named correctly, and have up-to-date title block information. You
also have to ensure that cross-sheet references are accurate (for example,
when a plan includes references to details on other sheets). When the time
comes to send drawings to clients or consultants, you must ensure that you
include all the sheets and that all of them are up-to- date. For a large project
with many drawings, these can be daunting tasks. It’s easy to end up with
missing sheets or sheets that contain obsolete title block or cross-reference
information, especially when you add or renumber sheets later in a project. 
Sheet sets comprise a new palette, a group of completely new commands, and
a few updated existing features. Together these things make possible a new
approach to managing all the drawings for a project. Sheet sets provide a single
interface that lists all your sheets, their numbers, and their names. (AutoCAD
stores this information, along with the relationships among the sheets, in a DST
file.) You can add and renumber sheets easily. You can create cross-sheet refer-
ences that update automatically after you renumber sheets, and you can create
a sheet list on your title sheet that updates automatically after you change
sheet numbers or titles. When you’re ready to send or plot drawings, a sheet
set enables AutoCAD to locate and gather all the required files.

Because the sheet sets approach is brand new, it remains to be seen how
quickly (or whether) AutoCAD users adopt it. My prediction is that companies
with well-managed CAD production staffs that work on larger projects requir-
ing lots of sheets will find sheet sets compelling and move to adopt them
quickly. Companies whose projects require only a few drawing sheets or whose
AutoCAD users tend to do their own thing with little central organization prob-
ably will continue to deal with sheets as discreet, unconnected DWG files.
Sheet sets rely on other relatively sophisticated AutoCAD features, so make
sure that you’re familiar with the following before you delve into this chapter:
 Paper space layouts (Chapter 3)
 Named views (Chapter 7)
 Tables and text fields (Chapter 9)
 Blocks and attributes (Chapter 13)
 External references (Chapter 13)
Understanding external references and layouts is especially important because
these features are central to the way that the Sheet Set Manager creates and
organizes sheets.
Taming Sheet Sets
Your passport to the brave new world of sheet sets comes in the form of the
Sheet Set Manager palette, shown in Figure 14-1. You use this palette for most
sheet set operations. To toggle the palette on or off, click the Sheet Set
Manager button (which looks like a roll of drawings) on the Standard toolbar
or press Ctrl+4. If you choose to leave the palette on most of the time, you
may want to turn on its auto-hide setting so that it gets out of the way auto-
matically when you’re not using it — refer to Chapter 2 for instructions.
The Sheet Set Manager palette’s three tabs indicate the three major types of
objects you use to create and manage sheet sets:
 Resource Drawings contain subcomponents such as individual plans,
details, and elevations that you use to build your sheets. Resource draw-
ings usually contain geometry and annotations in model space only.
Resource drawings usually don’t include title blocks or paper space lay-
outs. You must add DWG files to the Resource Drawings tab before you
can create Views and add them to Sheets.
 Views are areas of resource drawings that you place on a sheet. A sheet
set view can be the entire resource drawing or just a portion of it that
you’ve defined, using the AutoCAD named views feature. (Chapter 7
explains named views and shows how to create them.) 
322
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

You don’t have to use named views in order to take advantage of sheet
sets, but you may use them to assemble different areas of a resource
drawing onto one or more sheets. For example, if you draw a large plan
that needs to be broken up onto several sheets in order to plot at a legi-
ble scale, you define a named view for each area of the plan and place
each view on a separate sheet.
 Sheets are paper space layouts within drawing files. (Chapter 3 describes
layouts and shows how to create them.) Each sheet corresponds to one
sheet in the sheet set. With the sheet set methodology, AutoCAD attaches
resource drawings as xrefs into sheet drawings and creates paper space
viewports on a layout in order to show the desired area of the resource
drawing — either a named view or the entire drawing. You use the Sheet
Set Manager to tell AutoCAD which resource drawings and views to put
on which sheets. AutoCAD then does the attach-xref-and-make-viewport
procedure automatically.
AutoCAD stores the settings for all this stuff — the names of files and configu-
ration data that control how the sheet set features work with those files — in
a DST file. Each project has its own DST file, and multiple AutoCAD users can
use one project’s DST file at the same time.
Using an Existing Sheet Set
The quickest way to get started with sheet sets is to use one that someone
else — such as a CAD manager in your office — has set up. You also can

experiment with Autodesk’s sheet set samples, located under C:\Program
Files\AutoCAD Neo\Sample\Sheet Sets.
To open an existing sheet set configuration, do one of the following:
 Click the menu at the top of the Sheet Set Manager palette and choose
Open. AutoCAD displays a file dialog box, in which you can navigate to
the appropriate folder, select the sheet set data file, and click the Open
button.
 In Windows Explorer, double-click on a DST file.
In either case, AutoCAD displays the sheet set information in the Sheet Set
Manager palette, as shown in Figure 14-1. Click each of the three tabs to get
an idea of how the particular sheet set that you opened is configured.
With a sheet set open, you’re ready to perform tasks such as these:
 Double-click a name on any of the tabs to open the corresponding DWG
file in AutoCAD. Double-clicking a sheet name on the Sheet List tab or a
drawing name on the Resource Drawings tab opens that DWG file, while
double-clicking a view name on the View List tab opens the DWG file and
zooms to the view. Thus, you can use the Sheet Set Manager to navigate
quickly among all the drawings for a project.
 Right-click the sheet set name or a sheet subset name on the Sheet List
tab to create a new sheet, using the template drawing (DWT file) config-
ured for the project or sheet subset. (The “Getting Your Sheets Together”
section, later in this chapter, describes how to specify the DWT file for a
sheet set or subset.)
 Right-click a resource drawing to place it — either the entire drawing or
a named view within it — on a sheet drawing.
 Right-click a sheet or view to rename and renumber it. Names and num-
bers can be linked to labels on the sheets, so that when you change the
names or numbers in the Sheet Set Manager, AutoCAD automatically
updates them in all drawings where they appear. (See the next two para-
graphs for more information.)
 Right-click the sheet set name to add a sheet list table (that is, an index
of the drawings for the project) to the current drawing. AutoCAD uses
the name and number data described in the preceding paragraph to
create the sheet table list and keep it current.
 On the View List tab, right-click the sheet set name and choose Properties
to specify label blocks and callout blocks. Then you can right-click view
names to place these automatically updating blocks in drawings. Label
blocks show the number and name of a part of a drawing (for example, a
single detail or a plan). Callout blocks reference another part of the draw-
ing set — usually on another sheet (for example, a pointer on a plan to an
elevation or detail on a different sheet).

 Right-click sheets or subsets to publish (that is, plot) them, package
them for electronic transmittal, or archive them for yourself. (Chapter 16
includes instructions for these tasks.)
The rest of this chapter provides details and procedures for many of these
operations.
You don’t have to use all the features described earlier in order to benefit
from sheet sets. For example, you might use the Sheet Set Manager just to
create a navigational list of your drawings, add a sheet index to the cover
sheet of the drawing set, and batch plot all the sheets.
The Sheet Set Setup
If you don’t have an obliging CAD manager to configure sheets sets for you,
then you’ll have to do it yourself. You use the Create Sheet Set wizard for this
task. Follow these steps to create a new sheet set:
1. Open the menu at the top of the Sheet Set Manager palette and choose
New Sheet Set. 
The Create Sheet Set wizard appears.
2. Choose Create a Sheet Set Using Existing Drawings, and then click
Next.
The Sheet Set Details page appears, as shown in Figure 14-2.
Figure 14-2:

Details.

Chapter 14: Sheet Sets without Regrets

3. Type a name and description for the sheet set, and choose a directory
for the DST (sheet set configuration data) file.
By default, AutoCAD stores DST files that you create in your local My
Documents\AutoCAD Sheet Sets folder. Unless you’re the only person
working on a project, you should instead put DST files in a commonly
accessible place on your local network. You can store the DST files for
all projects in a single network folder or simply keep each project’s DST
file in the same folder that holds the project’s DWG files.
4. Click the Sheet Set Properties button, review the other settings, and
click OK.
You can change all this stuff later in the Sheet Set Manager palette, so
don’t worry too much about it now. Use the dialog box help (click the
question mark and then click on a setting) to find out more about any of
the settings.
5. Click Next.
The Choose Layouts page appears. You can click the Browse button to
add any drawing(s) that you’ve already created for the project to the
sheet set, but it’s just as easy to add them later in the Sheet Set Manager
palette. (I show you how in the next section.)
6. Click Next.
The wizard displays a summary of the settings that it saved to the new
DST file.
7. Click Finish.
AutoCAD closes the Create Sheet Set wizard and opens your new sheet
set in the Sheet Set Manager palette.
The other way to create a new sheet set is to copy one from an existing DST
file. If you choose Create a Sheet Set Using An Example Sheet Set in Step 2,
then you can choose from half a dozen Autodesk samples or open a file
dialog box and browse to other DST files. The Autodesk examples are fine for
experimenting, but you will need to modify them in order to make them
usable on real projects.
To change any of the sheet set properties (which you reviewed in Step 5
above), right-click the sheet set name on the Sheet List tab of the Sheet Set
Manager palette and choose Properties.
Getting Your Sheets Together
A new sheet set without any sheets is a lonely thing indeed, so after you create
a new sheet set, you’ll need to populate the set with drawings. A common way
to get started is to create a drawing with a suitable layout and title block in
326
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

paper space and then add it to the set. The other method is to direct the Sheet
Set Manager to create a new drawing, using the template and folder that’s con-
figured in the sheet set properties. I cover both methods here.
Adding existing sheets to a set
Use these steps to add an existing drawing to the sheet set for a project:
1. Create and save at least one properly set up drawing, including a
paper space layout. (See Chapter 3 for details.)
If you delete any unused layout tabs (right-click the tab and choose
Delete), the sheet list will turn out cleaner and less confusing. When
you’re using sheet sets, it’s usually best to set up and use just one layout
per drawing file.
2. Open the Sheet Set Manager palette.
3. (Optional) On the Sheet List tab of the Sheet Set Manager palette,
right-click the sheet set name and choose New Subset. Type a subset
name and click OK.
You can use sheets subsets to group your sheets into categories. See the
“Sheet subsets” section after these steps for an explanation and examples.
This isn’t your only chance to assign a sheet to a subset. You can create
the subset later and then drag the sheet into it.
4. Right-click the sheet set name (or the subset name that you created in
the previous step) and choose Import Layout as Sheet.
The Import Layouts as Sheets dialog box appears.
5. Click the browse button (the one with an ellipsis on it).
6. Navigate to and select the drawing that you created in Step 1, and
then click Open.
AutoCAD will report an error if you try to import a drawing that doesn’t
contain any configured layouts.
7. Select one or more layouts to import into the Sheet List and click OK.
AutoCAD adds the layout(s) to the Sheet List, as shown in Figure 14-3.
The sheet name is a combination of the DWG file name (S-sheet-plans-01
in this figure) and layout name (30x42).
8. Right-click the newly imported sheet and choose Rename and
Renumber.
The Rename and Renumber Sheet dialog box appears.
327
Chapter 14: Sheet Sets without Regrets

9. Type a Sheet Number and Sheet Title in the text boxes, and then 
click OK.
If you later create a sheet list table — that is, a drawing sheet index —
for your cover sheet, then AutoCAD will use what you type here to
describe the sheet. (I demonstrate this procedure at the end of this
chapter.) You usually should type the sheet number and title as they will
appear in the title block. This information also helps you and others
identify the sheet unambiguously in the Sheet List.
Sheet subsets
On the Sheet List tab, you can create sheet subsets to organize your sheets
into types — for example, plan sheets, elevation sheets, and detail sheets.
The advantages of using subsets are:
 On a project with lots of drawings, you can find drawings and under-
stand what kinds of drawings make up the set more easily. This kind of
organization also makes it easy to select a group of related files for plot-
ting or transmitting to someone else.
 You can configure each subset to use a unique template drawing (for
example, DWT file). Thus when you create new drawings with the Sheet
Set Manager, as described in the next section, different kinds of drawings
can start from different templates. For example, you might use one tem-
plate to start plans and a different one to start details, based on different
scales or other considerations.
Figure 14-3:
An imported
sheet.
328
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

 You can configure each subset to create new sheet drawings in different
folders. For example, you might keep your plan sheets and detail sheets
in two different folders.
To configure both of the second two options, right-click the subset name and
choose Properties.
Don’t confuse sheet subsets with sheet selections. You create the latter with
the Sheet Selections button at the top of the Sheet List tab. A sheet selection
is simply a grouping of sheets with a name attached to it. You can use sheet
selections to grab a group of sheets quickly for transmitting, archiving, or
publishing. (Chapter 16 describes these activities.) Sheet selections don’t
store any configuration information and don’t affect the organization of the
Sheet List. Sheet subsets do both of those things.
Creating new sheets for a set
Use the following steps to create a new sheet drawing, using the configura-
tion settings for the sheet set:
1. (Optional) On the Sheet List tab of the Sheet Set Manager palette,
right-click the sheet set name and choose New Subset. Type a subset
name and click OK.
2. Right-click the sheet set name or subset name and choose Properties.
The Sheet Set Properties dialog box appears.
3. Verify or change the Sheet Creation properties, and then click OK.
Sheet Storage Location determines where the new sheet DWG file will
get created, and Sheet Creation Template specifies the DWT file that it
gets created from.
4. Right-click the sheet set name or subset name and choose New Sheet.
The New Sheet dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-4.
Figure 14-4:
Creating a
new sheet.
329
Chapter 14: Sheet Sets without Regrets

5. Type a Sheet Number, Sheet Title, and File Name in the text boxes,
and then click OK.
The previous procedure describes what the Sheet Number and Sheet Title
are for. File Name determines the name of the DWG file that AutoCAD cre-
ates. AutoCAD generates the default file name by combining the sheet
number and sheet title. You probably want to remove the sheet number
from this automatically generated name, for the reasons described in the
following Tip.
Don’t type .DWG in the File Name box. AutoCAD always adds the file extension,
so if you type .DWG, AutoCAD will create a file named Whatever.Dwg.Dwg. 
If you anticipate ever having to renumber sheets on your project — and even
if you don’t anticipate it, it may happen! — you should name your sheet files
based on their general contents rather than their (current) sheet numbers.
For example, when you create an architectural floor plan that you anticipate
will be sheet A-201, name the sheet file A-FP01.dwg (first floor plan in the
series) instead of A-201.dwg. By giving sheet files names that are independent
of their sheet numbers, you retain the flexibility to renumber sheets automat-
ically later with just a few changes in the Sheet Set Manager.
Assembling sheet views 
from resource drawings
After you create a new sheet (or add an existing one that doesn’t yet contain
all the necessary drawing components), you use the Resource Drawing tab to
compose views on the sheet. A view can be simply the entire drawing, or it
can be a named view that you’ve created in the resource drawing. In all cases,
the Sheet Set Manager attaches the resource drawing as an xref to the sheet
drawing and creates a properly scaled viewport on the sheet drawing’s layout.
Each sheet can contain one view (for example, a large plan) or more than one
(for example, several elevations or a dozen details).
To place an entire resource drawing on a sheet, follow these steps:
1. On the Sheet List tab of the Sheet Set Manager palette, double-click
the sheet to which you want to add the resource drawing.
AutoCAD opens the drawing for editing.
2. Click the Resource Drawings tab.
3. If you haven’t yet specified the folder that contains the resource draw-
ing that you want to use, double-click Add New Location, browse to
the directory, and click the Open button.
330
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

You can add more than one folder to the Resource Drawings tab.
4. Right-click the resource drawing that you want to add to the sheet,
choose Place on Sheet, and move the cursor into the sheet drawing’s
layout.
AutoCAD attaches the resource drawing as an xref and creates a view-
port for it. You position the viewport with the cursor. 
5. Right-click.
A scale menu appears, as shown in Figure 14-5.
6. Choose the proper scale for the resource drawing.
AutoCAD rescales the viewport, and you continue to drag it with the
cursor.
7. Position the viewport where you want it and click.
AutoCAD places the viewport on the sheet.
If you need to adjust the viewport later, select it and use grip editing, the
Properties palette, or the Viewports toolbar to make changes.
8. Click the View List tab on the Sheet Set Manager palette.
Figure 14-5:
Adding a
view to a
sheet.
331
Chapter 14: Sheet Sets without Regrets

AutoCAD has added the resource drawing that you just used to the list
of views for this sheet set.
9. Right-click the new view name and choose Rename and Renumber.
The Rename and Renumber Sheet dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 14-6.
10. Type a View Number and View Title in the text boxes, and then 
click OK.
As I describe earlier in this chapter, you can direct the Sheet Set Manager
to use this information to create automatically updating labels. For exam-
ple, if you place a detail on a sheet, AutoCAD feeds the information in this
dialog box to a label block in the sheet drawing that shows the detail
number and title. In addition, you can create callouts on other sheets that
refer to this detail. If you later change the information in this dialog box,
the Sheet Set Manager changes it in the detail label as well as in the call-
outs that reference the detail. (You create label and callout blocks in sepa-
rate drawings, as described in Chapter 13. You then right-click the sheet
set name or a view name and choose Properties to configure the sheet set
or view to use these blocks.) Look up “callout blocks (for sheet views)”
and “label blocks (for sheet views)” in the AutoCAD online help system
for detailed instructions. 
Figure 14-6:
Specifying 
a view’s
number 
and title.
332
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

After you specify callout and label blocks on the View List tab, use the view’s
right-click menu to place either kind of block.
On the View List tab, you can create view categories by right-clicking the sheet
set name and choosing New View Category. Each view category can use differ-
ent callout blocks — right-click the view category and choose Properties to
configure callout blocks.
Placing a named view on a layout is just like placing an entire resource draw-
ing, except that on the Resource Drawing tab you click the plus sign next to
the drawing name to reveal its named views, right-click the desired view, and
choose Place on Sheet. (If you haven’t yet created the named view that you
need, open the drawing by double-clicking it on the Resource Drawing tab,
and choose View➪Named Views to open the View dialog box. See the section
titled “A View by Any Other Name. . .” in Chapter 7 for instructions on how to
create named views.)
Making an Automatic Sheet List
After you create sheets and assemble views on them from resource drawings,
you can take advantage of the additional sheet set features described in the
“Using an Existing Sheet Set” section earlier in this chapter. For example, you
can batch plot all the sheets for a project by right-clicking the sheet set name
and choosing Publish➪Publish to Plotter. (Chapter 16 describes the PUBLISH
command.)
Before you publish your CAD magnum opus, however, you probably want to
create an index. As long as you’re diligent about filling in the sheet number
and title properties, as I advise in the “Adding existing sheets to a set” and
“Creating new sheets for a set” sections earlier in this chapter, the Sheet Set
Manager will build a drawing index for you automatically. Even better, when
you add, remove, renumber, or rename sheets, AutoCAD updates the index
automatically. The Sheet Set Manager creates the drawing index, using
AutoCAD 2005’s new table object, for which reason it’s called a sheet list table.
(See Chapter 9 for information about tables.)
Use the following steps to create an automatic and automatically updateable
sheet list table:
1. On the Sheet List tab of the Sheet Set Manager palette, double-click
the sheet to which you want to add the drawing index.
AutoCAD opens the drawing for editing.
2. Right-click the sheet set name and choose Insert Sheet List Table.
The Insert Sheet List Table dialog box appears.
333
Chapter 14: Sheet Sets without Regrets

3. If you’re not happy with the fonts, text heights, colors, or text align-
ment of the table in the Table Style Settings area, click the ellipsis
button to open the Table Style dialog box, create and configure a new
style, and then click Close to return to the Insert Sheet List Table
dialog box.
Chapter 9 shows how to create table styles.
The default alignment for the data cells is Top Center. You may want to
change it to Top Left (that is, align sheet numbers and titles left flush
rather than centered).
4. If you want to change the number of columns, which data appear in
each column, and what the column headings and table title say, use
the Table Data Settings area to do so.
Click the Add button to create an additional column. Drop-down lists in
the Column Settings area show the types of data that you can include in
the table. (Double-click the entry in the Data Type column to display the
drop-down list.) Much of the additional, optional data come from the
Drawing Properties dialog box, which I describe in Chapter 3. (The Sheet
Number, Title, Description, and Plot data all come from the sheet set
properties.)
5. Click OK.
By default, AutoCAD displays a dialog box reminding you not to edit 
the sheet list table manually, because the Sheet Set Manager handles it
automatically.
6. Click OK.
AutoCAD creates the table, and you drag it with the cursor.
7. Position the table where you want it and click.
AutoCAD places the table on the sheet. Each of the data cells is a field
that gets its value from the sheet set properties (see Figure 14-7) or
drawing properties.
After you make changes to the Sheet List, such as adding a sheet or editing a
sheet title, select the table, right-click, and choose Update Sheet List Table.
Now are computers great, or what?! 
If you didn’t quite get the sheet list table properties right on the first try,
select the table, right-click, and choose Edit Sheet List Table Settings.

Although sheet sets are too new to know for sure, they’re poised to alter pro-
foundly the way that people create and manage drawings in AutoCAD. Like all
software innovations that increase the sophistication of a process and manage
dependencies, sheet sets require some study, some configuration, and signifi-
cant coordination on everyone’s part. (One good resource is the group of sheet
sets tutorials in Help➪New Features Workshop.) In this case, those who
expend the effort are likely to be well rewarded.

I
f you’ve ever worked with other people to create a multichapter, visually
complex, frequently updated text document, then you probably under-
stand the importance of coordinating how everyone works on the parts of
the document. Even if you’re someone who churns out documents from your
one-person office or lonely cubicle, you probably try to ensure a reasonably
consistent look and feel in similar documents. You employ consistent fonts,
the same company logo, and the same paper size in most documents — or if
you don’t, you probably at least think that you should!
CAD exacts similar demands for reasonable consistency, only more so:
 Most companies would like to take pride in the clarity and consistency
of their drawings. Sloppy drawings with randomly varying text heights
and lineweights don’t reflect well on you and make your drawings harder
to read. 
 CAD drawings that don’t conform with some logically consistent scheme
usually are harder to edit and to reuse by others who work on the pro-
ject and by you when you work on other projects.
This stuff is important enough in CAD that it has a special name: CAD standards.
Those people compulsive enough to fret about it all the time and sadistic
enough to impose their fretting on others also have a special name: CAD man-
agers. This chapter won’t turn you into a CAD manager — a reassurance you’re
probably grateful for — but it does introduce the most important CAD stan-
dards issues. This chapter also suggests some ways to come up with your
own simple CAD standards, in case you’re going it alone and don’t have the

benefit of a ready-made company or project CAD standards document to guide
you. The chapter ends with an overview of AutoCAD tools that can help you
comply with and check conformity to CAD standards.
Why CAD Standards?
Throughout this book, I emphasize things like setting up your drawings prop-
erly, drawing objects on appropriate and consistent layers, and specifying suit-
able text fonts and heights. These practices amount to conforming to a CAD
standard.
You need to do these things if you work with or exchange drawings with others.
If you don’t, several bad things will happen. You’ll be pegged as a clueless new-
bie by experienced drafters, who understand the importance of CAD consis-
tency. Even if your ego can handle the contempt, you’ll make everyone’s
work slower and more difficult. And if the project has electronic drawing sub-
mittal requirements, you may find that your client rejects your DWG files and
demands that you make them conform to the CAD standards in the contract.
Even if you work solo and don’t have any particular requirements imposed
from outside, your own work will go more smoothly and look better if you
adhere to a reasonably consistent way of doing things in AutoCAD. You’ll cer-
tainly find plotting easier and more predictable.
CAD standards originally grew out of a desire to achieve a graphical consis-
tency on the plotted drawings that mirrored the graphical consistency on
hand-drafted drawings. Before the days of CAD, most companies had manual
drafting standards that specified standard lettering (text) sizes, dimension
appearance, symbol shapes, and so on. Sometimes these standards were
based on standard industry reference books, such as the Architectural Graphic
Standards.
As CAD users became more sophisticated, they realized that CAD standards
needed to incorporate more than just the look of the resulting plot. CAD draw-
ings contain a lot more organizational depth than printed drawings — layers,
screen colors, blocks, xrefs, text and dimension styles, and the like. If these
things aren’t subject to a modicum of standardization; then different people
who work on the same drawings or projects are likely to end up stumbling
over — or throwing things at — one another.
In short, the first job of CAD standards is to impose some graphical consis-
tency on plotted output. CAD standards also encourage consistency in the
way that people create, assign properties to, organize, and display objects in
the CAD file.

Which CAD Standards?
If CAD standards are as important as I claim, you might expect that industries
would’ve settled on a standardized way of doing things. No such luck. Although
the manual drafting conventions in many professions have carried over to
some degree into CAD, a lot of the things that need standardization have been
left to the imagination of individual companies, departments, or people. For
example, you’ll find that different companies usually name layers differently
and employ different schemes for mapping object screen color to plotted
lineweight (see Chapter 12). In particularly disorganized companies, you’ll
find that different drafters use different layers and color-to-lineweight. And in
the worst cases, the same drafter will do these things differently in different
drawings!
As you can imagine, this proliferation of nonstandard standards makes shar-
ing and reusing parts of CAD drawings a lot more difficult. You can at least
minimize the pain within your own office by conforming to any existing CAD
standards or, if there aren’t any, by encouraging the development of some.
(Later in this chapter, I give some suggestions for how to get started.)
339
Chapter 15: CAD Standards Rule
The aesthetics of CAD
Manual drafting veterans frequently complain
that CAD drawings don’t look as good as the
drawings that they used to create by hand. “Too
‘flat,’ too cartoonish, and inconsistent” are
some of the refrains that you hear. These com-
plaints are not just the whining of old-timers.
Good manual drafters were justifiably proud of
the appearance of their drawings. They focused
on making the finished bluelines look sharp and
read well.
When computers and CAD software got into the
act, it became easy for CAD drafters to focus on
the screen image and pay less attention to the
plotted output. In the early days, CAD users
struggled with a new way of making drawings
and didn’t have as much time to make them look
good. By the time that CAD became common-
place, a new crop of CAD users had grown up
without the benefit of discovering how to make
good-looking drawings on paper.
There’s no reason that CAD drawings can’t look
as good as manual drawings. It’s a matter of
understanding the look that you’re after and
caring enough to want to achieve it. If you see
some especially clear and elegant printed
drawings, find out who drew them and take that
person out to lunch. You’ll probably uncover
some techniques that you can translate into
making better CAD drawings. You may also gain
new respect for the skills of those who made
handsome and functional drawings with the
simplest of tools.

Even if you’re lucky or perseverant enough to get a well-rounded set of CAD
standards in your office, that may not be the end of it. CAD-savvy people from
different companies who collaborate on projects often want to minimize the
pain of inconsistency during drawing exchange. Although each company may
have its own CAD standards house in order, there’s no way that all those stan-
dards will be the same. Thus, one or more companies (often the lead consul-
tant) may impose a set of project-specific CAD standards. Project-specific
standards don’t necessarily need to be as detailed as a full-blown company
CAD standards document, but depending on the project and the person who
created the project-specific CAD standards, they might be.
The result of this confusing muddle of industry practices, company CAD stan-
dards, and project-specific CAD standards is that you find yourself switching
among different standards as you work on different projects. Before you start
making drawings, find out whether any particular CAD standards apply. It’s a
lot easier to start off conforming with those standards than to fix nonconform-
ing drawings later.

Industry standards
Professional, trade, and governmental groups in
some industries have made an attempt to pro-
mulgate CAD standards for the benefit of every-
one in the industry. For example, the American
Institute of Architects (AIA), together with sev-
eral professional engineering associations,
published a CAD Layer Guidelines document,
which has become part of a so-called National
CAD Standard that’s now promulgated by the
U.S. government’s National Institute of Building
Sciences, or NIBS (see www.nationalcad-
standard.org). The International Organiza-
tion for Standardization, or ISO (the acronym
reflects the French ordering of the words), pub-
lishes ISO standards document 13567 (see www.
iso.ch). This document, which comes in no
fewer than three parts, attempts to provide a
framework for CAD layer standards in the build-
ing design industries throughout the world.
These documents may be useful to you in your
search for standards, but they aren’t a panacea.
The majority of CAD-using companies has
ignored officially promulgated CAD standards,
because these companies developed their own
standards and practices years ago and are
loath to change. That doesn’t mean that you
can’t use the officially promulgated standards,
but they won’t suddenly make you a part of
some mythical CAD standards mainstream.
Also, practical implementation of most official
CAD standards in a specific company requires a
generous amount of clarification, modification,
and additional documentation. In other words,
you don’t just buy the document and then get to
work; someone needs to tailor it to your com-
pany and projects. And finally, some of these
officially promulgated CAD standards docu-
ments are shockingly expensive. Apparently
these organizations haven’t found out that the
way to make something popular is to post it on
the Web for free!

What Needs to Be Standardized?
If you are in a company or on a project without any CAD standards, put
together at least a minimal set of guidelines. First, impose some consistency
on plotted appearance and use of layers. If you make a few rules for yourself
before you start, you’ll end up with drawings that are more professional look-
ing and easier to edit — and more likely to be useful on future projects.
A spreadsheet or word processing program is great for documenting your CAD
standards decisions as they firm up. Many CAD standards components work
best as tabular lists of layers, colors, and so on. (See Tables 15-1 and 15-2 in
this chapter for examples.) Use the cells in a spreadsheet or the tables feature
in a word processor to organize your CAD standards documentation.
Before you start, make sure that you’re familiar with managing properties
(Chapter 4) and plot styles (Chapter 12). You need a good understanding to
make intelligent decisions about your plotting and layer standards. (If you
want to make unintelligent decisions, don’t worry about those chapters!)
Plotting
If you plan to use color-dependent plot styles (most people do), develop a
color-to-lineweight plotting chart like Table 15-1. If you choose the more logi-
cal but lonelier named plot styles approach, make a similar chart, with plot
style names instead of color in the first column. (See Chapter 12 for informa-
tion about color-dependent and named plot styles.) After you complete a
plotting chart, create a plot style table (CBT file for color-dependent plot
styles or STB file for named plot styles), as in Chapter 12.

Your life will be easier — and your plotting chart will be shorter — if you limit
yourself to a small portion of the 255 colors in the AutoCAD Color Index (ACI).
The first nine colors work well for many people.
If your work requires screened (shaded or faded-out) lines, extend the plotting
chart to include a couple of additional AutoCAD colors. For each color, list the
plotted lineweight and screen percentage ranging from 0% for invisible to 100%
for solid black.
Layers
After you work out your plotting conventions, you’re ready to develop a chart
of layers. A chart of layers takes more thought and work, and you’ll probably
revise it more frequently than the plotting chart. Find a typical drawing from
your office or industry and identify the things you’ll draw — such as walls,
text, dimensions, and hatching. Then decide how you’d like to parse those
objects onto different layers (see Chapter 4). Here are some guidelines:
 Objects that you want to plot with different lineweights go on different
layers. Assign each layer an appropriate color, based on how you want
the objects to appear on the screen and on plots. If you’re using object
lineweights (Chapter 4) or named plot styles (Chapter 12), include a
column for these settings in your chart. In all cases, let the objects
inherit these properties from the layer.
 Objects whose visibility you want to control separately go on different
layers. Turn off or freeze a layer in order to make the objects on that layer,
and only the objects on that layer, disappear temporarily.
 Objects that represent significantly different kinds of things in the real
world go on different layers. For example, doors should go on different
layers from walls in an architectural floor plan.
As you make your layer decisions, you’ll develop a layer chart that resembles
Table 15-2. If you use named plot styles instead of color-dependent plot styles,
add a Plot style column to the chart.

Non-plotting information
The layer chart in Table 15-2 is simpler than the layer systems used by experi-
enced drafters in most companies. The layer names in the table are based on
names in the AIA CAD Layer Guidelines document mentioned in the “Industry
standards” sidebar. That document recommends adding a discipline-specific
prefix to each layer name: A-Walls for walls drawn by the architectural team,
S-Walls for walls drawn by the structural team, and so on. 
Other stuff
The following settings and procedures deserve some consistency, too:
 Text styles: Decide on text fonts and heights and use them consistently.
(See Chapter 9 for more information.)
Manual CAD drafting standards often specify a minimum text height of 
1⁄8 inch or 3 mm, because hand-lettered text smaller than that becomes
difficult to read, especially on half-size prints. Plotted 3⁄32 inch or 2.5 mm
CAD text is quite legible, but half-size plots with these smaller text
heights can result in text that’s on the margin of legibility. Text legibility
on half-size — or smaller — plots depends on the plotter resolution, the
lineweight assigned to the text, and the condition of your eyes. Test
before you commit to using smaller text heights, or use 1⁄8 inch or 3 mm
as a minimum.
343
Chapter 15: CAD Standards Rule

 Dimension styles: Create a dimension style that reflects your preferred
look and feel. (See Chapter 10.)
 Hatch patterns: Choose the hatch patterns that you need and decide on
an appropriate scale and angle for each. (See Chapter 11.)
 Drawing setup and organization: Set up all the drawings on a project in
the same way, and use sheet sets, blocks, and xrefs in a consistent fashion.
After you make standards, create a simple test drawing and make sure that
the plotted results are what you want. You’ll undoubtedly revise and extend
your standards as you go, especially on your first few projects. In time, you’ll
find a set of standards that works for you.
Cool Standards Tools
Most of the hard CAD standards work happens outside of AutoCAD — think-
ing, deciding, documenting, revising, and so on. But ultimately you need to
translate that work into your CAD practice, and AutoCAD includes some tools
to make the job easier. Table 15-3 lists standards-related AutoCAD utilities.

Chapter 15: CAD Standards Rule

AutoCAD standards checking tools require an AutoCAD Drawing Standards
(DWS) file. You create a DWS file from a drawing with all the allowed layers,
dimension styles, text styles, and linetypes; use File➪Save As to save it as a
DWS (not DWG) file. The DWS file defines acceptable named objects for the
Check Standards and Batch Standards Checker utilities. See “standards files,
creating” in AutoCAD’s online help system for information.
AutoCAD 2005 monitors CAD standards compliance when you’ve specified
standards for the current drawing. By default, a balloon notification appears
from the right end of the status bar. CAD managers can trade the balloon for
a message that offers to fix the mistake. To configure the notification level,
click the Settings button in the Configure Standards dialog box.
If your company does have CAD standards in place, someone may have created
custom tools to help you comply with those standards. For example, the CAD
manager may have put together template drawings with customized settings or
block libraries of standard symbols. CAD managers sometimes create custom
menu choices, scripts, or utility programs for the company’s CAD standards.

U
nless you’ve been living under a rock for the past five years, you know
that the Internet is causing major changes in the way that people work.
(And even if you have been living under a rock, someone probably is offering
broadband service to it by now!) Because of the Net, most of us communicate
differently, exchange files more rapidly, and fill out express delivery forms less
frequently.
AutoCAD users were among the online pioneers, well before the Internet burst
onto the public scene. Despite this early adoption, the CAD world has been
relatively slow to take the full-immersion Internet plunge. Exchanging draw-
ings via e-mail and using the World Wide Web for CAD software research and
support are pretty common nowadays. But it’s still uncommon to find draw-
ings incorporated into Web pages or Web-centric CAD applications. That’s
partly because CAD drafters have traditionally been somewhat insulated from
the general computing community — they spend most of their time cranking
out drawings and leave all that new-fangled Web design stuff to people 
who don’t have real work to get done, thank you very much! Even the more
forward-thinking CAD users tend to display a healthy, and often reasonable,
skepticism about whether any particular innovation will help with the press-
ing job of getting drawings finished on deadline.

Many of the features described in this chapter have undergone frequent tinker-
ing, revision, and refocusing in recent AutoCAD versions. AutoCAD 2005 adds
new ETRANSMIT and PUBLISH capabilities to keep up with the new sheet sets
feature, which is described in Chapter 14. The Standard toolbar includes a
new Markup Set Manager for those who receive drawing markups from users
of Autodesk DWF Composer. (DWF Composer is Autodesk’s newest effort to
draw more people into using the DWF format. The idea is that architects, engi-
neers, and others who don’t themselves use AutoCAD can mark up drawings
by using DWF Composer and then transmit those markups to an AutoCAD
drafter, who incorporates the changes into the DWG files.) 
This chapter shows you how — and when — to use AutoCAD’s Internet fea-
tures. I also cover how the Internet features can connect with traditional CAD
tasks, such as plotting. The emphasis of this chapter is on useful, no-nonsense
ways of taking advantage of the Internet in your CAD work.
Your ticket to most of the features described in this chapter is an account with
an Internet service provider (ISP). You probably already have Internet access
through work or a private ISP account — or both; but if not, now is the time to
get connected. Other CAD users will expect to be able to send drawings to you
and receive them from you via e-mail. Software companies, including Autodesk,
expect you to have Web access in order to download software updates and
support information. Dial-up modem access to the Internet is acceptable, but if
you’re doing much drawing exchange or want to be able to download software
updates without waiting all day, consider springing for broadband access, such
as DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) or cable modem.
The Internet and AutoCAD: An Overview
As with all things Internet-y, AutoCAD 2005’s Internet features are a hodge-
podge of the genuinely useful, the interesting but still somewhat immature or
difficult to use, and the downright foolish. I steer you toward features and
techniques that are reliable and widely used today. I warn you about “stupid
pet trick” features that may impress a 12-year-old computer geek but leave
your project leader wondering what planet you come from. On the other
hand, a few of today’s questionable features are likely to become the reliable,
commonplace ones of tomorrow. I give you enough context to see how every-
thing works and where it may lead. Table 16-1 summarizes the AutoCAD 2005
Internet features and tells you where in this book to find more information.

Sending Strategies
E-mail and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) have largely replaced blueline prints,
overnight delivery, floppies, and higher capacity disks as the standard means
of exchanging drawings. Some companies even use specially designed Web-
based services, such as Autodesk’s Buzzsaw, as a repository for project draw-
ings from all the companies working on a particular project. Whether you’re
exchanging drawings in order to reuse CAD objects or simply to make hard-
copy plots of someone else’s drawings, you need to be comfortable sending
and receiving drawings electronically.
Sending and receiving DWG files doesn’t differ much from sending and receiv-
ing other kinds of files, except for the following:
 DWG files tend to be bigger than word processing documents and
spreadsheets. Consequently, you may need to invest in a faster Internet
connection, as described earlier in this chapter.
 You can easily forget to include all the dependent files. I tell you in the
next section how to make sure that you send all the necessary files — and
how to pester the people who don’t send you all their necessary files.
350
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

 It’s often not completely obvious how to plot what you receive. Read
Chapter 12 and the section, “Bad reception?” in this chapter to solve
plotting puzzles.
Whenever you send DWG files together, follow the Golden Exchange Rule: “Send
files unto others as you would have them sent unto you.” That means sending
all the dependent files along with the main DWG files, sending plotting support
files (CTB or STB files — see Chapter 12), and including a description of what
you’re sending. And ask the recipient to try opening the drawings you send
them right away, so you both have more time to respond if there’s any problem.
Send it with ETRANSMIT
Many people naively assume that an AutoCAD drawing is always contained in
a single DWG file, but that’s often not the case. Each drawing file created in
AutoCAD can contain references to other kinds of files, the most important of
which are described in the following table. Thus, before you start exchanging
drawings via e-mail or FTP, you need a procedure for assembling the draw-
ings with all their dependent files.

As you can see from the table, the consequences of not including a custom
font aren’t that dire: The recipient still will see your text, but the font will be
different. Of course, the new font may look odd or cause text spacing prob-
lems within the drawing. If, on the other hand, you forget to send xrefs or
raster graphics that are attached to your main drawing, the objects con-
tained on those attached files simply will be gone when the recipient opens
your drawing. Not good!
351
Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

Table 16-2 doesn’t exhaust the types of files that your DWG files might refer
to. Custom plotter settings (such as custom paper sizes) may reside in PC3 
or PMP files. If you use the new sheet sets feature, a DST file contains infor-
mation about the sheet structure. An FMP file controls some aspects of font
mapping. (Like so much else in AutoCAD, the tools and rules for mapping
missing fonts are flexible but somewhat complicated. Look up the “FONTALT”
and “FONTMAP” system variables in the AutoCAD online help system for
detailed information.)
Rapid eTransmit
Fortunately, the AutoCAD ETRANSMIT command pulls together all the files
that your main DWG file depends on. Follow these steps to assemble a draw-
ing with all its dependent files with ETRANSMIT.
1. Open the drawing that you want to run ETRANSMIT on.
If the drawing is already open, save it. ETRANSMIT requires that any
changes to the drawing be saved before you proceed.
2. Choose File➪eTransmit.
The Create Transmittal dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-1.
3. On the Files Tree or Files Table tab, remove the check mark next to
any file that you want ETRANMSIT not to copy with the main drawing.
Figure 16-1:
Rapid
eTransmit.
352
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

Unless you have assigned custom font mapping, you can omit the
Acad.fmp file.
4. Select a transmittal setup from the list.
Transmittal setups are new in AutoCAD 2005. They contain settings that
control how ETRANSMIT processes the drawings and creates the trans-
mittal package. Click the Transmittal Setups button to create new or
modify existing setups. The default Standard transmittal setup works
fine for many purposes, except that you probably want to turn on the
Include Fonts setting, as described in the next paragraph. In any case,
you should view the settings (click the Modify button) just to see what
options you can change if you need to later.
If you want AutoCAD to include SHX and TTF font files, including any
custom fonts that you’re using, you must turn on the Include Fonts setting
in the transmittal setup. (Click Transmittal Setups, click Modify, and check
the Include Fonts box.) Note, however, that many SHX and TTF files are
custom fonts, which work like licensed software. Sending them to others
is just like sharing your AutoCAD program CD with others. No, I don’t
mean that it’s easy and fun; I mean that it’s illegal and unethical. Before
you send a custom font file to someone else, find out what the licensing
restrictions are on the font and be prepared to work within them.
5. Click the View Report button.
You see a report listing the files that ETRANSMIT will copy, along with
warnings about any files that it can’t locate.
6. Review the report and make sure that ETRANSMIT was able to find all
the files.
7. Click OK.
ETRANMSIT displays a file dialog box so that you can specify the name
and location of the transmittal package (which is a ZIP file by default).
8. Click Save.
ETRANSMIT creates the transmittal package (which is a ZIP file by
default).
Although AutoCAD 2005 automatically compresses its DWG files, zipping files
manages to compress them even further (about 20 percent more, in my expe-
rience). More importantly, zipping creates a single, tidy package of all your
DWG, raster image, plot style table, and font files. No one likes to receive an
e-mail message carrying an endless cargo of attached files. Do everyone a
favor: be hip and zip.
The only downside to zipping is that creating a zipped file and extracting files
from it require a separate zip/unzip program. Several good shareware utilities
are available, including WinZip (www.winzip.com).
353
Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

Transmitting multiple drawings
In many cases, you’ll want to send more than one drawing to a recipient. In
this situation, you can open each drawing and run ETRANSMIT on each in
turn. (In the transmittal setup, set Transmittal Package Type to Folder (set
of files), specify the Transmittal File Folder to copy the files to, and use
Transmittal Options to control whether the files are copied to one or more
than one folder.) When you’ve processed all the drawings, use a program like
WinZip to package the files into a single zipped file before sending it.
AutoCAD 2005 provides a slicker way of transmitting multiple drawings, as
long as you’re using the new sheet sets feature (described in Chapter 14). In
the Sheet Set Manager palette, just right-click the sheet set name and choose
eTransmit. The Create Transmittal dialog box then will include an additional
Sheets tab, as shown in Figure 16-2. This tab lists all drawings in the sheet set
and includes them in the transmittal by default.
AutoCAD 2005 includes a new ARCHIVE command, which functions identically
to ETRANSMIT, but without the transmittal document and without saved
setups. ARCHIVE works only with sheet sets. In the Sheet Set Manager palette,
right-click the sheet set name and choose Archive. You use this command to
save copies of a set of drawings at some milestone during a project — for
example, at a design review or bid set submittal.

FTP for you and me
FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a simple but robust protocol for copying files
over the Internet. A computer that’s connected to the Internet can act as an FTP
server, which means that part of its hard disk is accessible over the Internet.
The person who configures the FTP server can place restrictions so that only
people who enter a particular logon name and password can see and download
files. FTP overcomes the file size limitations that often occur with e-mail.
Because of all these FTP benefits, it’s increasingly common for people at
larger companies to place drawing files on their company’s FTP site and tell
you to go get them. This approach relieves them of having to e-mail you the
files, and relieves you of waiting for that 10MB e-mail download when you
least expected it.
In most cases, the person making the files available to you via FTP will send
you a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that looks like a Web page address,
except that it starts with FTP:// instead of HTTP://. If you open your Web
browser and enter the FTP URL into the address field, the browser should con-
nect to the FTP site, ask you for a location and name to use for the file when it
gets copied to your system, and begin downloading the file. If the FTP site uses
password protection, you’ll have to enter a logon name and password first.
If you want fancier FTP download options, you can use an FTP utility program
such as WS_FTP (www.ipswitch.com).
Even if you work for a small company, you may be able to post files on your
ISP’s FTP server in order to make them available to others. Check with your
ISP to find out whether you can do it and, if so, what the procedures are.
FTP transfers are more prone to user confusion problems than are e-mail files,
especially if the recipient hasn’t used FTP before. For example, it’s common for
the person posting the files to forget to tell the recipient the logon name and
password, or for the recipient not to have an FTP program — or to not know
how to use it. Check with your recipient the first couple of times you use FTP
to transfer files to make sure they got the files successfully — and don’t be sur-
prised if they ask you to use e-mail or overnight delivery instead.
Bad reception?
Other sections in this chapter focus on sending files to others. What happens
when you’re on the receiving end? Not everyone will be as conscientious as
you are about following the Golden Exchange Rule. You’ll receive drawings with
missing dependent files and no information or support files for plotting.
355
Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

When you receive an e-mail message or FTP download containing drawings
(zipped, I hope!), copy the file to a new folder on your hard disk or a network
disk and unzip the files.
Check at least a few of the drawings in the package to make sure that all the
xrefs, fonts, and raster image files were included. You can perform this check
by opening each main drawing in that folder. After you open each file, press
the F2 key to view the command line window, and look for missing font and
xref error messages of the following sort:
Substituting [simplex.shx] for [helv.shx].
Resolve Xref “GRID”: C:\Here\There\Nowhere\grid.dwg
Can’t find C:\Here\There\Nowhere\grid.dwg
A Substituting. . . message indicates AutoCAD couldn’t find a font and is
substituting a different font for it. A Can’t find. . . message indicates that
AutoCAD couldn’t locate an xref. Any missing raster files appear as rectangu-
lar boxes with the names of the image files inside the rectangles. Alterna-
tively, you can open the Xref Manager or Image Manager dialog box, which
reveals any missing xref or raster image files. (See Chapter 13 for details.)
Write down each missing file and then tell the sender to get on the ball and
send you the missing pieces. While you’re at it, tell that person to buy this
book and read this chapter!
Press the F2 key after opening any drawing that you didn’t create so that you
know right away if any fonts and xrefs are missing.
If you receive drawings with custom TrueType font files (files whose extensions
are TTF), you must install those files before Windows and AutoCAD will recog-
nize them. Choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel. (In Windows XP, choose
Start➪Control Panel and then click the Switch to Classic View link in order to
see the Fonts applet.) Double-click the Fonts icon to open the Fonts window,
and then choose File➪Install New Font.
Help from the Reference Manager
In Chapter 13, I warn you about the complications of xref paths and the poten-
tial perils of AutoCAD not being able to locate xrefs if you move project folders
around or transfer drawings to or from someone else. A similar danger exists
for raster image files (Chapter 13) and font files (Chapter 9). The ETRANSMIT
356
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

command, described earlier in this chapter, does a good job of gathering
together dependent xrefs, raster files, and font files, but it can’t gather what
AutoCAD can’t locate.
AutoCAD’s Reference Manager utility is a real lifesaver if you find yourself suf-
fering from xref, raster image, or font path perils — whether they occur in
your own company or when sending files to or receiving them from others.
Reference Manager is a separate utility program, not a command inside
AutoCAD. Follow these steps to launch the utility:
1. Choose Start➪Programs➪Autodesk➪AutoCAD 2005➪Reference
Manager.
The Reference Manager program opens, as shown in Figure 16-3.
2. Choose the Add Drawings button to add one or more DWG files to the
drawings pane on the left.
3. Click the Export Report button to create a text report listing all the
dependent files and their paths, or click the Edit Selected Paths
button to modify paths.
Click the Help button in Reference Manager to find out more about the
utility’s capabilities.
If you always keep parent and child DWG files in the same folder — the sim-
plest approach to dealing with xref paths — then you probably won’t need to
use the Reference Manager.

In a previous section of this chapter, I explain how you can exchange drawings
via e-mail and FTP. That’s all the Internet connectivity that many AutoCAD
users need, but if you’re curious about connecting drawings to the Web or
sharing drawings with people who don’t have AutoCAD, this section is for you.
The AutoCAD Web features are built on two pieces of technology:
 A special lightweight drawing format called DWF that Autodesk originally
developed especially for putting drawings on the Web.
 A free program from Autodesk called Autodesk Express Viewer that
enables anyone to view and print DWF files without having AutoCAD.
All about DWF
The AutoCAD DWG format works well for storing drawing information on local
and network disks, but the high precision and large number of object proper-
ties that AutoCAD uses make for comparatively large files.
To overcome this size problem and encourage people to publish drawings on
the Web, Autodesk developed an alternative lightweight vector format for rep-
resenting AutoCAD drawings: DWF (Design Web Format). A DWF file is a more
compact representation of a DWG file. DWF uses less space — and less transfer
time over the Web and e-mail — because it’s less precise and doesn’t have all
the information that’s in the DWG file.
DWF hasn’t exactly taken the Web by storm; Autodesk has gradually recast it
as a format for electronic plotting, or ePlotting, including for sharing drawings
with people who don’t have AutoCAD. In other words, Autodesk is pushing
DWF as a CAD analogue to Adobe’s PDF (Portable Document Format). Thus
you can create DWF files from your drawings and send the DWFs to people
who don’t have AutoCAD. Your recipients can view and plot the DWF files
after they download the free Autodesk Express Viewer program, which is
available on Autodesk’s Web site, www.autodesk.com.

ePlot, not replot
A DWF file captures a single, plotted view of your drawing, so, unlike a DWG
file, it can provide a relatively unambiguous snapshot of what you want to
see on paper. With a DWG file, on the other hand, you have to provide lots of
information to other people — drawing view, scale, plot style settings, and so
on — in order for them to get the same plotting results that you did.
Potential ePlotting scenarios include:
 Architects and other consultants on a building project periodically upload
DWF files to the project Web site. Architects and engineers with some min-
imal CAD knowledge can review the drawings on-screen and create their
own hard-copy plots, if necessary. Principals and clients who don’t want
anything to do with CAD, or even with computers, can have their secre-
taries or other employees create hard-copy plots for them to examine.
 When Internet-savvy people need hard-copy prints of your drawings, you
e-mail a zipped file containing DWF files, along with the URL for Autodesk
Express Viewer and simple instructions for creating plots from the DWF
files. (Be ready to walk them through the process by phone the first time
or two to reduce anxiety on everyone’s part.)
 A CAD plotting service bureau encourages its customers to send DWF files
instead of DWG files for plotting. The DWF files are much smaller and
require less intervention on the part of the service bureau’s employees.
The ePlot concept debuted in AutoCAD 2000 and hasn’t yet caught on in a big
way. Autodesk hopes to establish ePlot and the DWF format as a standard for
CAD documents similar to what Adobe’s PDF has become for word process-
ing documents. It remains to be seen whether ePlotting will become a popu-
lar way to generate hard-copy output. In particular, many people outside of
CAD-using companies don’t have access to large-format plotters. They’re lim-
ited to 81⁄2-x-11-inch — or, at best, 11-x-17-inch — reduced-size check plots.
Consequently, many people won’t be able to plot your DWF files to scale, and
may not even be able to plot them large enough to read everything.
Don’t be afraid to try ePlotting with colleagues inside or outside your com-
pany, but don’t become too dependent on it until you see whether the rest of
the CAD world shares your enthusiasm. Otherwise, you risk becoming the
only one who’s willing to use your DWF files for plotting — in which case the
next version of the feature will be called mePlot.
359
Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

AutoCAD 2005 uses version 6 of the DWF format, which Autodesk introduced
with AutoCAD 2004. (The DWF format changes at least as often as the DWG
format, as Autodesk adds new features to AutoCAD and new Design Web
Format capabilities.) The most important new feature in DWF 6 is multiple
sheets in a single DWF file, as shown in Figure 16-4. It’s like stapling together 
a set of drawings, except that you never have to worry about your stapler
being empty.
Making DWFs with ePlot
As I describe in the previous section, AutoCAD treats DWF files like electronic
plots, or ePlots. You create a DWF file from the current drawing just as if you
were plotting it to a piece of paper, as I describe in Chapter 12. The only differ-
ence is that, in the Plot dialog box’s Printer/Plotter area, you choose the plotter
configuration named DWF6 ePlot.pc3, as shown in Figure 16-5. When you do
so, AutoCAD automatically turns on the Plot To File setting. Then when you
click OK to generate the ePlot, AutoCAD displays a file dialog box in which you
specify a filename and location for the DWF file that gets created. The location
can be a folder on a hard disk or a Web server.

Pay particular attention to the Scale setting on the Plot Settings tab. If you’re
creating a DWF simply for viewing in a browser, you can plot Scaled To Fit. If
you want to enable others to ePlot your DWF file to scale, as described earlier
in this chapter, you need to choose the desired plot scale factor. Chapter 12
describes how to choose an appropriate plot scale factor.
Making DWFs (or Plots) with PUBLISH
The ePlot method of creating DWF files described in the previous section
works fine for single drawings. But if you want to create DWF files for a lot of
drawings or plot a bunch of drawings the good ol’ fashioned way (on paper,
that is), you can use the Publish dialog box, shown in Figure 16-6, to speed
the process.

Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

Although the Publish dialog box is wired to support DWF as well as regular
(paper) plotting, for now, more people are likely to use it for paper plotting. (An
alternative use is creating plot files to send to a plotting service bureau.) But if
you do decide to go into large-scale DWF publishing, including multisheet DWF
files, use the Publish Drawing Sheets dialog box, as in the following steps.
1. Choose File➪Publish.
The Publish dialog box appears (refer to Figure 16-6). The dialog box
lists all tabs (Model and paper space layouts) of the current drawing for
plotting. The Publish dialog box refers to each tab as a sheet.
2. Use the buttons below the sheet list to preview any sheet, add sheets
from other drawings, remove sheets from the to-be-plotted list, or
rearrange the plotting order.
With the additional buttons, you can save and recall lists of sheets. See
Step 4 for more information.
3. After you specify the sheets that you want to plot, specify whether you
want to plot them to an actual plotter or plot (PLT) file or to a DWF file.
You can select a specific plotter configuration for each sheet by choos-
ing a Page Setup in the sheet list. See Chapter 12 for more information
about page setups.
4. Click the Publish Options button to display a dialog box containing
additional settings.
Most of these options are of concern only if you’re creating DWF files. The
one exception is Default Output Directory, which also applies to creating
plot (PLT) files.
5. Click the Save Sheet List button to save the current drawings and set-
tings list, if you anticipate having to publish the same group of draw-
ings again.
6. Click the Publish button to start the process.
AutoCAD 2005’s new sheet sets feature (described in Chapter 14) includes a
direct link to multisheet publishing. In the Sheet Set Manager palette, right-
click the sheet set name and choose Publish. The submenu includes choices
for publishing directly to a plotter or DWF file and for opening the Publish
dialog box preloaded with all the sheet sets.
Don’t confuse the PUBLISH command (File➪Publish) with the PUBLISHTOWEB
command (File➪Publish to Web). The PUBLISH command creates sets of DWF
files, plot files, or actual plots. The PUBLISHTOWEB Wizard creates a Web page
containing images of your drawings. The results of this Wizard won’t put any
362
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

Web designers or programmers out of work, but you can use it to create primi-
tive Web page paste-ups of your drawings. See “PUBLISHTOWEB command” in
the AutoCAD online help system if you’d like to give it a whirl.
Hand-y objects
No Web file format would be complete without hyperlinks, and DWF has those,
too. You can attach a hyperlink to any drawing object in AutoCAD, not just to a
text string. As you pass the cursor over an object with a hyperlink, the cursor
changes from the ordinary pointer to a globe and two links of a chain (as in
“World Wide Web” and “link,” not “world-wide chain gang”). Right-click the
object and select the Hyperlink option from the menu, which opens your
browser and navigates to the URL that’s attached to the object. If you create a
DWF file that includes objects with hyperlinks, Autodesk Express Viewer
embeds the links in the DWF file so that you can Ctrl+click to navigate to them.
Hyperlinks on objects are a clever trick, but they’re of limited practical value
in most DWG and DWF files:
 The drawing images are so small that it’s difficult to distinguish the hyper-
link on one object from the hyperlink on another object.
 Most people aren’t used to associating hyperlinks with individual lines
and other objects. The interface is likely to leave them perplexed.
If you’d like to experiment with hyperlinks in objects, look up “HYPERLINK
command, about” in the online help system.
Autodesk Express Viewer
After you create DWF files, whether with ePlot or PUBLISH, you or the recipi-
ent of your DWF files can use Autodesk Express Viewer to view and print
them. Autodesk Express Viewer, shown in Figure 16-4 earlier in this chapter,
is a free viewer from Autodesk. You can download the current version from
Autodesk’s Web page, www.autodesk.com (click on Product and Solutions
and then Autodesk Express Viewer).
When you install AutoCAD 2005, the setup program by default installs Auto-
desk Express Viewer as well. Choose Start➪Programs➪Autodesk➪Autodesk
Express Viewer, or simply double-click on a DWF file in Windows Explorer, to
launch it.

Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

The Drawing Protection Racket
Whether you’re sending DWG or DWF files, you may be concerned about their
misuse (that is, by the wrong people or for the wrong purposes), abuse (for
example, modification without your consent), or reuse (on other projects or by
other people without due compensation to you).
The previous version, AutoCAD 2004, added two new features for securing
your drawings when you send them to others:
 Password protection enables you to lock a DWG or DWF file so that only
those who type the password that you’ve specified can open, insert, or
xref it.
Add password protection to drawings only when you really need it:
• If you forget the password, then you no longer will be able to open
the drawing. Neither AutoCAD nor Autodesk has any magical way
to extract the password or unlock the drawing.
• After you password protect a drawing, others can’t insert the draw-
ing as a block or attach it as an xref.
If you’re using a password, you probably should do it on a copy of the
drawing that you send, and keep an unprotected version for yourself.
 Digital signature is a high-tech way to add an electronic marker to a
DWG file that verifies that someone approved the drawing. AutoCAD’s
digital signature feature relies on fairly new technology by Microsoft.
You must first get an account with a digital certificate provider, who
serves to authenticate you and your computer. Of course, for this fea-
ture to be useful, you need to send drawings to someone who wants to
receive digitally authenticated drawings from you (or vice versa) and
who has the technological savvy to deal with digital certificates. For
more information, see “digital signatures, learning more about” in the
AutoCAD online help system.
To activate either of these options for the current drawing, choose File➪Save
As to display the Save Drawing As dialog box, and then choose Tools➪Security
Options to display the Security Options dialog box before you save the file. If
you want to add a password to the current drawing, just type it in the text field
on the password tab of the Security Options dialog box.
After you password protect and save a DWG file, anyone who tries to open,
insert, or xref it will see a dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 16-7.
364
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

To password protect a DWF file, use the PUBLISH command and click the
Publish Options button in the Publish dialog box.
Although electronic security features such as the ones described in this 
section can be useful as part of a strategy to protect your work from misuse,
they’re not a substitute for communicating clearly, preferably in the form of
written contracts, what constitutes appropriate use of drawings that you
send to or receive from others. http://markcad.com/autocad/elecdwg
exchange.htm outlines the issues and suggests how to play well with your
drawing exchange buddies.

Chapter 17
Ten Ways to Do No Harm
H
ippocrates of Greece is famous for many things, not least of which is
the Hippocratic oath sworn by doctors. It begins “First, do no harm.”
This is not a bad approach to take when editing existing drawings with
AutoCAD whether the drawings were created originally by you or by some-
one else. You can accidentally undo days or weeks of work by yourself and
others in minutes. (Of course, you also can purposefully undo days or weeks
of work by yourself and others in minutes, but I can’t give much advice to
stop you if you want to do that!)
Follow these guidelines to avoid doing harm to the hard work of others and
the productive potential of yourself.
Be Precise
Throughout this book, I remind you that using precision techniques such as
snap, object snaps, and typed coordinates is a fundamental part of good CAD
practice. Don’t try to use AutoCAD like an illustration program, in which you
eyeball locations and distances. Use one of the many AutoCAD precision
techniques every time you specify a point or distance.
Control Properties by Layer
As I describe in Chapter 4, AutoCAD gives you two different ways of control-
ling object properties such as color, linetype, and lineweight: by layer and by
object. Unless you have a really good reason to assign properties by object —
such as instructions from your company’s CAD manager or the client for
whom you’re creating the drawing — use the by-layer method: Assign colors,
linetypes, and lineweights to layers, and let objects inherit their properties
from the layer on which they reside. Don’t assign explicit color, linetype, or
lineweight to objects.

Know Your Drawing Scale Factor
Chapter 3 describes the importance of choosing an appropriate drawing
scale factor when you set up a drawing. Knowing the drawing scale factor of
any drawing you’re working on is equally important whether you set it up or
not. You need this number in order to calculate lots of scale-dependent
objects, such as text, dimensions, and hatching. Chapter 9 includes tips for
figuring out the drawing scale factor of an existing drawing.
Know Your Space
Understand the difference between model space and paper space (described
in Chapter 2) and know which space the different parts of the drawing you’re
looking at on-screen reside in. Above all, make sure that you draw objects in
the appropriate space. When you’re viewing a paper space layout, keep an
eye on the status bar’s MODEL/PAPER button so that you know which space
the cursor currently is in. (Chapter 3 describes how to keep your model and
paper space bearings.) When you plot, ensure that you’ve selected the right
tab — either Model or one of the paper space layout tabs.
If Someone (Sheet) Set It,
Don’t Forget It
Sheet sets are brand new in AutoCAD 2005, and it remains to be seen how
readily AutoCAD-using companies will take to them as a way of organizing
drawing sets. If you create new drawings on a project that’s organized with
sheet sets, use the Sheet Set Manager palette to ensure that your drawing
starts out as a full-fledged citizen of the set. If you find yourself working on a
drawing that’s part of a set, be sure that you understand how the sheet set as
a whole is organized and how your drawing fits into it. Be aware that some
information, such as title sheet data, sheet list, and pointer blocks, may be
generated automatically for the sheet set, and avoid thwarting these auto-
matic annotations by drawing separate text or symbols for the same purpose.
Explode with Care
The eXplode command makes it easy to explode polylines (Chapter 5),
dimensions (Chapter 10), hatches (Chapter 11), and block inserts (Chapter 13)
into their constituent objects. The only problem is that someone probably
370
Part V: The Part of Tens 

grouped those objects together for a reason. So until you understand that
reason and know why it no longer applies, leave the dynamite alone.
Don’t Cram Your Geometry
It’s okay to cram for a geometry test, but don’t cram geometry, dimensions,
text, or anything (and everything) else into your drawings. A real temptation
exists to put a lot of stuff into every square inch of your drawing, using
AutoCAD’s flexible panning and zooming capabilities to really work over all
the available space. If you succumb to this temptation, you’ll discover that
editing is more difficult and adding more information may be impossible! In
addition, the result probably will be harder to read. Instead of cramming stuff
onto the sheet, use white (empty) space to surround areas of dense geome-
try. Put details on separate sheets. Attach a page of notes instead of putting a
ton of text onto your drawing. Managing a reasonable number of drawings
with less on each one is easier than having two or three densely packed
sheets crammed with every bit of geometry and annotation needed for the
project.
Freeze Instead of Erase
It’s common to start with an existing drawing from another discipline when
you want to add, say, an electrical system to a floor plan. But if you remove
the landscaping around a building because you don’t need it for the wiring,
you may cause a great deal of rework when the landscaping information is
needed again. And what if the person who did the landscaping work has, in
the meantime, decided to leaf? (Sorry . . . ) Unless you know that objects are
no longer needed, use the AutoCAD Freeze or Off layer setting to make
objects on those layers invisible without obliterating them. These settings
are in the Layer Properties Manager dialog box, as described in Chapter 4.
Use CAD Standards
Become knowledgeable about CAD standards in your industry and company,
and take advantage of any standardized resources and approaches that are
available to you. (See Chapter 15 for suggestions.) By following standards
consistently, you can apply your creativity, expertise, and energy to the inter-
esting parts of the job at hand, not to arguing about which hatching patterns
to use. And if you find that things are a mess in your company because no
one else pays much attention to industry standards, well, knowing those
standards makes you very employable as well.
371
Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Do No Harm

Save and Back Up Drawings Regularly
As with all computer documents that you work on, get in the habit of saving
your current AutoCAD drawing regularly. I recommend every 10 minutes or
so. Each time you save, AutoCAD writes the current state of the drawing to
the drawingname.DWG file, after renaming the previously saved version 
drawingname.BAK. Thus, you can always recover the next-to-last saved ver-
sion of your drawing by renaming drawingname.BAK to somethingelse.DWG
and opening it in AutoCAD.
AutoCAD also includes an automatic drawing save feature. It’s useful as a sec-
ondary backup save, but you shouldn’t rely on it exclusively. AutoCAD creates
automatic save files with inscrutable names like Drawing1_1_1_1478.SV$
and puts them in the folder specified by the Automatic Save File Location set-
ting on the File tab of the Options dialog box. Save your drawing and save
yourself the pain of lost work and the hassle of trying to locate the right auto-
matic save file. If you find yourself in the unfortunate position of needing an
automatic save file, move the SV$ files file from the automatic save folder to
another folder. Rename the files from SV$ to DWG, open them in AutoCAD,
and look for the one that corresponds to the drawing you’re trying to
recover. Note that AutoCAD deletes the SV$ file after you close the drawing,
so it’s usually useful only after a software or computer crash.
Backing up your data is prudent advice for any important work that you do
on a computer, but it’s doubly prudent for CAD drawings. A set of CAD draw-
ings is a lot harder and more time consuming to re-create than most other
computer documents. Unless you’re willing to lose more than a day’s worth
of work, develop a plan of daily backups onto tape, CD-RW (CD ReWritable)
discs, or another high-capacity medium.
Don’t be lulled into complacency by the increasing reliability of hard disks.
Although hard disk failure is increasingly rare, it still happens, and if it hap-
pens to you sans backup, you’ll quickly understand the full force of the
phrase “catastrophic failure.” Also, backups aren’t just protection against
disk failure. Most of the time, backups help you recover from “pilot error” —
accidentally erasing a file, messing up a drawing with ill-advised editing, and
so on. Even if you’re conscientious and never make mistakes, there’s a good
chance that someone else in your office who has access to your DWG files
hasn’t quite achieved your exalted level of perfection. Protect your work and
minimize recriminations with regular backups.

Ten Ways to Swap Drawing
Data with Other People
and Programs
A
t various times, you probably need to transfer information from one
kind of document to another. You even may have taken the CAD plunge
because you want to import AutoCAD drawing data into your word process-
ing or other documents. If so, this chapter is for you. It covers exchanging
AutoCAD drawing data with other programs — what works, what doesn’t,
and how to do it. I also tell you when to give up and reach for the scissors
and glue.
This chapter frequently mentions vector and raster graphics file formats:
 A vector format stores graphics as collections of geometrical objects
(such as lines, polygons, and text). Vector graphics are good for high
geometrical precision and for stretching or squeezing images to different
sizes. These two characteristics make vector formats good for CAD.
 A raster format stores graphics as a series of dots, or pixels. Raster
graphics are good for depicting photographic detail and lots of colors.
Exchanging AutoCAD drawing data with other programs sometimes works
great the first time you try it. Sometimes, you have to try a bunch of tech-
niques or exchange formats to get all the data to transfer in an acceptable
way. Occasionally, no practical exchange method exists for preserving for-
matting or other properties that are important to you. Where your exchange
efforts fall in this spectrum depends on the kind of drawings you make,
the other programs you work with, and the output devices or formats that
you use. I provide recommendations in this chapter, but be prepared to
experiment.
Table 18-1 lists exchange formats between common programs and AutoCAD.

The remainder of this chapter gives you specific procedures for making most
of the exchanges recommended in this table, as well as others.
DWG
DWG, AutoCAD’s native file format, is the best format for exchanging draw-
ings with other AutoCAD or LT users. Use the SAVE and SAVEAS commands to
create DWG files and the OPEN command to open them.
AutoCAD LT can’t create every kind of object that AutoCAD can — raster
attachments and most 3D objects, for example — but it can successfully read
and save DWG files that contain these objects. 
374
Part V: The Part of Tens 

AutoCAD 2005 can’t save to the AutoCAD Release 14 DWG format. Apparently,
the Autodesk bigwigs figure that the best way to persuade R14 users to
upgrade is to make their lives as inconvenient and isolated as possible! If
you need to send AutoCAD 2005 drawings to AutoCAD R14 users, save them
in R12 DXF format instead of a DWG format. (See the “DXF” section for
instructions.)
Autodesk does not document the native AutoCAD DWG file format, and rec-
ommends that all file exchanges between AutoCAD and other CAD programs
take place via DXF files (see the next section). But several companies have
reverse-engineered the DWG format, and it’s now common for other CAD pro-
grams to read and sometimes write DWG files directly, with greater or lesser
accuracy. Because the DWG format is complicated, isn’t documented, and
gets changed every couple of years, no one ever figures it out perfectly. Thus,
exchanging DWG files with non-Autodesk programs always involves some
compatibility risks.
When you send DWG files to other people — whether they use AutoCAD or a
different CAD program — you need to make sure that their software can read
the DWG file version that you’re sending. See Chapter 1 for information about
AutoCAD DWG file versions.
When you send DWG files to other people, remember to use the ETRANSMIT
command to ensure that you send all the dependent files (fonts, xrefs, and
raster images). See Chapter 16 for details.
375
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Swap Drawing Data with Other People and Programs
Round-trip DWG fare
The most demanding — and elusive — kind of
data exchange is called round-trip transfer.
Round-trip means that you create and save a
file in one program, edit and save it in another
program, and then edit and save it in the first
program again. A perfect round trip is one in
which all the data survives and the users of both
programs can happily edit whatever they want
to. Unfortunately, the perfect round trip, like the
perfect visit to your cousins, rarely happens. 
In CAD, round-trip transfer becomes an issue
when two people want to work on the same
drawings with different CAD programs. AutoCAD
and AutoCAD LT have excellent round-trip
compatibility, as Chapter 1 explains. Expect a
bumpier road if you’re exchanging drawings
with users of other CAD programs. Perform
some test transfers before you assume that
your drawings can get from here to there and
back again unscathed. 

DXF
DXF (Drawing eXchange Format) is the Autodesk-approved format for
exchanging between different CAD programs. (Some other vector graphics
applications, such as drawing and illustration programs, read and write DXF
files, too.) DXF is a documented version of the DWG format. Because DXF
more-or-less exactly mimics the DWG file’s contents, it’s (usually) a faithful
representation of AutoCAD drawings.
How well DXF works for exchanging data depends largely on the other pro-
gram that you’re exchanging with. Some CAD and vector graphics programs
do a good job of reading and writing DXF files, while others don’t. In practice,
geometry usually comes through well, but properties, formatting, and other
nongeometrical information can be tricky. Test before you commit to a large-
scale exchange, and always check the results.
To create DXF files, use the SAVEAS command (File➪Save As) and choose one
of the three DXF versions in the Files of Type drop-down list. To open a DXF
file, do the same with the OPEN command (File➪Open).
DWF
As Chapter 16 describes, DWF is Autodesk’s special “lightweight” drawing
format for posting drawings on the Web or sharing them with people who
don’t have AutoCAD. Those people can use Autodesk’s free Express Viewer
program to view and print DWF files (as well as DWG files). Chapter 16
describes how to create and use DWF files.
PDF
Adobe’s PDF (Portable Document Format) is the most popular format for
exchanging formatted text documents among users of different computers
and operating systems. PDF also does graphics, as you probably know from
having viewed PDF brochures on Web sites. 
Autodesk has worked hard to make DWF the PDF for CAD drawing exchange,
but DWF hasn’t yet caught on in a big way. When AutoCAD users need to
send drawings to people who don’t have AutoCAD, many prefer to convert
the drawings to PDF files. Most potential recipients are familiar with PDF and
already have the free Adobe Reader installed on their computers, neither of
which can be said of DWF.
376
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The free Adobe Reader views and prints PDF files, but won’t create them. In
order to convert an AutoCAD drawing (or any other Windows document) into
a PDF file, you’ll need additional software. Adobe sells Acrobat Standard and
Professional for this purpose — see www.adobe.com/acrobat/ for details
and a trial version. Many other companies offer commercial and shareware
PDF-creation programs. One such utility is Pdf995 (www.pdf995.com), which,
despite its under-$10 price, does a good job of creating PDF files from
AutoCAD drawings.
WMF
There are lots of different vector and raster graphics file formats, but
Microsoft has been pretty successful at making its WMF and BMP formats the
lingua franca — or should that be lingua bill-a? — for exchanging graphical
information in Windows. 
WMF (Windows MetaFile) is a vector format, so it does a decent job of repre-
senting AutoCAD objects such as lines, arcs, and text. 
To create a WMF file showing some or all the objects in a drawing, use the
EXPORT command (File➪Export) and choose Metafile (*.wmf) in the Files
of Type drop-down list. After you create a WMF file in AutoCAD, use the other
program’s file insertion command to place the image in a document. 
AutoCAD puts objects in the WMF file with the colors and display lineweights
that you see on the AutoCAD screen. To create a WMF file that looks like a
monochrome plot — that is, with varying lineweights and all objects black —
you need to set layer and object properties in AutoCAD so the objects look
that way on-screen before you create the WMF file. 
You can go the other direction, from a WMF file into AutoCAD, by using the
WMFIN command (Insert➪Windows Metafile).
BMP, JPEG, TIFF, and 
Other Raster Formats
BMP (BitMaP) is the standard Windows raster format. AutoCAD can create
BMP files from drawing objects (via the EXPORT command) and place BMP
files in drawings (via the IMage command). When you export AutoCAD draw-
ing objects to a BMP file, all the objects get converted to dots. Turning a line
into a bunch of dots isn’t a swell idea if you want to change the line again. But
it is useful if you need to copy a drawing into a company brochure.

Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Swap Drawing Data with Other People and Programs

One problem with BMP files is their big file size. Unlike some other raster for-
mats, BMP doesn’t offer compression. Because CAD drawings usually are
fairly large in area, they can turn into monstrously large BMP files.
Creating a BMP file showing some or all the objects in a drawing is just like
creating a WMF file: Use the EXPORT command (File➪Export) but choose
Bitmap (*.bmp) in the Files of Type drop-down list. After you create a BMP
file in AutoCAD, you use the other program’s File➪Open to open it or the
graphics file insertion command to place it in an existing document.
If you want to go the other direction, a BMP file into an AutoCAD drawing, use
the IMage command, as described in Chapter 13.
Although BMP is a standard Windows format for exchanging raster data, it’s
certainly not the preferred format of many programs. Other common raster
formats include PCX, JPEG, and TIFF (the latter two appears as JPG and TIF in
Windows). Among their other advantages, these formats offer image com-
pression, which can reduce the size of raster files dramatically. 
If the program that you’re trying to work with works best with other formats,
or you want to avoid huge BMP files, you have a couple of options:
 Create an AutoCAD-friendly format (such as WMF or BMP) and translate
it to another graphics format with a translation program such as HiJaak
(www.imsisoft.com) or VuePrint (www.hamrick.com).
AutoCAD includes new JPGOUT, PNGOUT, and TIFOUT commands for
creating JPG, PNG, and TIF files in the same way that you export WMF
and BMP files. Type the command name, press Enter, specify a raster file
name, and select the objects to be included in the image file. These com-
mands use the current drawing area background color as the back-
ground color for the image. If you want your image background to be
white, make sure that the AutoCAD drawing area color is white when
you run the command. (Choose Tools➪Options➪Display➪Colors to
change display colors.) 
 If you need to convert drawings to a raster format other than BMP or
TIF, the second option is to use the AutoCAD Raster File Format driver.
This driver enables you to “plot” to a file with one of nine raster formats,
including PCX, JPEG, and TIFF. Before you can use the Raster File Format
driver, you must create a new plotter configuration: Choose File➪Plotter
Manager and then run the Add-A-Plotter wizard. After you create the
Raster File Format driver configuration, you use the Plot dialog box as
described in Chapter 12 to generate “plots” to raster files.
To go the other direction, raster image file into an AutoCAD drawing, use the
IMage command, as described in Chapter 13.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Windows Clipboard
If you need to transfer lots of WMF or BMP figures, you can do it a bit more
quickly with the Windows Clipboard, which bypasses the creation of WMF
and BMP files on disk. Instead, Windows uses your computer’s memory to
transfer the data. Choose Edit➪Copy in the program from which you want to
copy the data and Edit➪Paste Special in the program to which you want to
copy it. In the Paste Special dialog box, choose Picture to paste the image in
WMF format or Bitmap to paste it in BMP format.
OLE
Microsoft Windows includes a data transfer feature, Object Linking and
Embedding, or OLE. (In case you’re wondering, that’s “OLE” pronounced like
the Spanish cheer, not like the Cockney way of saying hole.) Microsoft touts
OLE as an all-purpose solution to the challenge of exchanging formatted data
between any two Windows programs. 
If you want to share data between two OLE-aware programs (and most
Windows applications are OLE-aware), creating an embedded or linked docu-
ment shouldn’t be much more complicated than cut and paste. That’s the
theory. 
Here’s how it works. In OLE lingo, the program that you’re taking the data
from is the source. The program that receives the data is called the container.
For example, if you want to place some word processing text from Microsoft
Word into an AutoCAD drawing, Word is the source, and AutoCAD is the
container.
In Word, you select the text that you want to put in the AutoCAD drawing and
choose Edit➪Copy to copy them to the Windows Clipboard. Then, you switch
to AutoCAD and choose Edit➪Paste Special. The Paste Special choice dis-
plays a dialog box containing the choices Paste and Paste Link. The Paste
option creates a copy of the object from the source document and embeds
the copied object into the container document. The Paste Link option links
the new object in the container document to its source document so any
changes to the source document are automatically reflected in the container
document. In other words, if you link word processing text to an AutoCAD
drawing, changes that you make later in the Word document get propagated
to the AutoCAD drawing automatically. If you embed the same spreadsheet
object in an AutoCAD drawing, changes that you later make to the text in
Word aren’t reflected in the AutoCAD drawing.
379
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Swap Drawing Data with Other People and Programs

That’s how it’s supposed to work. In practice, the container application some-
times doesn’t display or print all the linked or embedded data correctly. See
the “Should you shout, ‘OLE!’?” sidebar for details.
Screen Capture
If your goal is to show the entire AutoCAD program window, not just the
drawing contained in it, create a screen capture. Most of the figures in this
book are screen captures. You might use similar figures to put together a
training manual or to show your mom all the cool software you use.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Should you shout, “OLE!”?
Unfortunately, OLE is afflicted with several prac-
tical problems. 
 Compound OLE documents can slow per-
formance — a lot. If you plan to use OLE,
you should have a fast computer with lots
of memory — or lots of time on your hands. 
 Supporting OLE well is a difficult program-
ming job, and many applications, including
AutoCAD, suffer from OLE design limitations
and bugs. (For example, when you link or
embed a word processing document, only
the first page appears in AutoCAD.)
 Previous versions of AutoCAD exhibited
more OLE problems than AutoCAD 2005. In
particular, plotted OLE output often under-
went creative but undesirable transforma-
tions. If you exchange drawings with users
of earlier versions, what they see on the
screen and plot may not match what you
created.
AutoCAD 2005 includes a bevy of OLE improve-
ments, which address some of the limitations:
 You can control text size more easily,
via the MOLESCALE system variable and
OLESCALE command.
 Editing of OLE objects with commands such
as Move and CoPy is more consistent with
editing of native AutoCAD objects. 
 You can control the quality of plotted OLE
objects with a setting on the Plot and
Publish tab of the Options dialog box.
Even with the OLE improvements in AutoCAD
2005, you should consider carefully and test
extensively before embedding or linking docu-
ments into drawings. If you want to play it safe,
use the alternative methods described in this
chapter, and save OLÉ for your next trip to
Spain.

Windows includes a no-frills screen capture capability that is okay for an
occasional screen capture. It works like this:
1. Capture the whole screen or active window with one of these steps:
• Press the Print Screen key to capture the entire Windows screen,
including the desktop and taskbar. 
• Hold down the Alt key and press the Print Screen key to capture
just the active program window (for example, AutoCAD). 
Windows copies a bitmap image to the Windows Clipboard. 
2. Paste the bitmap image into another program. You have two options:
• Paste into a paint program (such as the Paint program in
Windows). Use that program to save a raster image as a BMP file
format. 
• Paste the bitmap image directly into a document (such as a Word
document or an AutoCAD drawing) without creating another file.
If you do lots of captures, a screen capture utility program makes the job
faster and gives you more options. You can control the area of the screen that
gets captured, save to different raster file formats with different mono-
chrome, grayscale, and color options, and print screen captures. One good
screen capture utility program is FullShot by Inbit, Inc. (www.inbit.com).
When you create screen captures, pay attention to resolution and colors:
 High screen resolutions (for example, above 1280 x 1024) can make your
captures unreadable when they get compressed onto an 81⁄2-x-11-inch
sheet of paper and printed on a low-resolution printer. 
 Some colors don’t print in monochrome, and a black AutoCAD drawing
area is overwhelmingly dark. For most of the screen captures in this
book I used 1024 x 768 resolution, a white AutoCAD drawing area, and
dark colors — mostly black — for all the objects in the drawing.
TXT and RTF
TXT (Text, also called ASCII for American Standard Code for Information
Interchange) is the simplest format for storing letters and numbers. TXT files
store only basic text, without such formatting as boldface or special para-
graph characteristics. RTF (Rich Text Format) is a format developed by
Microsoft for exchanging word processing documents (text plus formatting).
381
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Swap Drawing Data with Other People and Programs

Select Import Text from the Multiline Text Editor window’s right-click menu
to import an TXT or RTF file. AutoCAD imports plain text from TXT and RTF
files. When you import an RTF file, AutoCAD even brings along most of the
text formatting and alignment. Chapter 9 covers the Multiline Text Editor
window.
Because no sane person would use AutoCAD as a word processor, AutoCAD
doesn’t provide any special tools for exporting text. You can select AutoCAD
text, copy it to the Windows Clipboard, then paste it into another program.
