Preface
The past 35 years have seen the emergence of a growing desire worldwide that positive
actions be taken to restore and protect the environment from the degrading effects of all forms
of pollution—air, water, soil, thermal, radioactive, and noise. Since pollution is a direct or
indirect consequence of waste, the seemingly idealistic demand for “zero discharge” can be
construed as an unrealistic demand for zero waste. However, as long as waste continues to
exist, we can only attempt to abate the subsequent pollution by converting it to a less noxious
form. Three major questions usually arise when a particular type of pollution has been
identiﬁed: (1) How serious are the environmental pollution and water resources crisis?
(2) Is the technology to abate them available? and (3) Do the costs of abatement justify the
degree of abatement achieved for environmental protection and water conservation? This
book is one of the volumes of the Handbook of Environmental Engineering series. The
principal intention of this series is to help readers formulate answers to the above three
questions.
The traditional approach of applying tried-and-true solutions to speciﬁc environmental and
water resources problems has been a major contributing factor to the success of environmental
engineering, and has accounted in large measure for the establishment of a “methodology of
pollution control.” However, the realization of the ever-increasing complexity and interre-
lated nature of current environmental problems renders it imperative that intelligent planning
of pollution abatement systems be undertaken. Prerequisite to such planning is an under-
standing of the performance, potential, and limitations of the various methods of environ-
mental protection available for environmental scientists and engineers. In this series of
handbooks, we will review at a tutorial level a broad spectrum of engineering systems
(processes, operations, and methods) currently being utilized, or of potential utility, for
pollution abatement. We believe that the uniﬁed interdisciplinary approach presented in
these handbooks is a logical step in the evolution of environmental engineering.
Treatment of the various engineering systems presented will show how an engineering
formulation of the subject ﬂows naturally from the fundamental principles and theories of
chemistry, microbiology, physics, and mathematics. This emphasis on fundamental science
recognizes that engineering practice has in recent years become more ﬁrmly based on
scientiﬁc principles rather than on its earlier dependency on empirical accumulation of
facts. It is not intended, though, to neglect empiricism where such data lead quickly to the
most economic design; certain engineering systems are not readily amenable to fundamental
scientiﬁc analysis, and in these instances we have resorted to less science in favor of more art
and empiricism.
Since an environmental engineer must understand science within the context of applications,
we ﬁrst present the development of the scientiﬁc basis of a particular subject, followed by
exposition of the pertinent design concepts and operations, and detailed explanations of their
applications to environmental conservation or protection. Throughout the series, methods of
system analysis, practical design, and calculation are illustrated by numerical examples.
v

These examples clearly demonstrate how organized, analytical reasoning leads to the most
direct and clear solutions. Wherever possible, pertinent cost data have been provided.
Our treatment of environmental engineering is offered in the belief that the trained engineer
should more ﬁrmly understand fundamental principles, be more aware of the similarities
and/or differences among many of the engineering systems, and exhibit greater ﬂexibility
and originality in the deﬁnition and innovative solution of environmental system problems.
In short, an environmental engineer should by conviction and practice be more readily
adaptable to change and progress.
Coverage of the unusually broad ﬁeld of environmental engineering has demanded an
expertise that could be provided only through multiple authorships. Each author (or group of
authors) was permitted to employ, within reasonable limits, the customary personal style in
organizing and presenting a particular subject area; consequently, it has been difﬁcult to treat
all subject materials in a homogeneous manner. Moreover, owing to limitations of space,
some of the authors’ favored topics could not be treated in great detail, and many less
important topics had to be merely mentioned or commented on brieﬂy. All authors have
provided an excellent list of references at the end of each chapter for the beneﬁt of the
interested readers. As each chapter is meant to be self-contained, some mild repetition among
the various texts was unavoidable. In each case, all omissions or repetitions are the respon-
sibility of the editors and not the individual authors. With the current trend toward metrica-
tion, the question of using a consistent system of units has been a problem. Wherever possible,
the authors have used the British system (fps) along with the metric equivalent (mks, cgs, or
SIU) or vice versa. The editors sincerely hope that this redundancy of units’ usage will prove
to be useful rather than being disruptive to the readers.
The goals of the Handbook of Environmental Engineering series are: (1) to cover entire
environmental ﬁelds, including air and noise pollution control, solid waste processing and
resource recovery, physicochemical treatment processes, biological treatment processes,
biotechnology, biosolids management, ﬂotation technology, membrane technology, desalina-
tion technology, water resources, natural control processes, radioactive waste disposal,
hazardous waste management, and thermal pollution control; and (2) to employ a multimedia
approach to environmental conservation and protection since air, water, soil, and energy are
all interrelated.
This book is Vol. 15 of the Handbook of Environmental Engineering series, which has been
designed to serve as a water resources engineering reference book as well as a supplemental
textbook. We hope and expect it will prove of equal high value to advanced undergraduate
and graduate students, to designers of water resources systems, and to scientists and
researchers. The editors welcome comments from readers in all of these categories. It is our
hope that the book will not only provide information on water resources engineering, but will
also serve as a basis for advanced study or specialized investigation of the theory and analysis
of various water resources systems.
This book, Modern Water Resources Engineering, covers topics on principles and appli-
cations of hydrology, open channel hydraulics, river ecology, river restoration, sedimentation
and sustainable use of reservoirs, sediment transport, river morphology, hydraulic

Abstract Hydrology deals with the occurrence, movement, and storage of water in the earth
system. Hydrologic science comprises understanding the underlying physical and stochastic
processes involved and estimating the quantity and quality of water in the various phases and
stores. The study of hydrology also includes quantifying the effects of such human interven-
tions on the natural system at watershed, river basin, regional, country, continental, and global
scales. The process of water circulating from precipitation in the atmosphere falling to the
ground, traveling through a river basin (or through the entire earth system), and then
evaporating back to the atmosphere is known as the hydrologic cycle. This introductory
chapter includes seven subjects, namely, hydroclimatology, surface water hydrology, soil
hydrology, glacier hydrology, watershed and river basin modeling, risk and uncertainty
analysis, and data acquisition and information systems. The emphasis is on recent develop-
ments particularly on the role that atmospheric and climatic processes play in hydrology, the

1. INTRODUCTION
Hydrology deals with the occurrence, movement, and storage of water in the earth system.
Water occurs in liquid, solid, and vapor phases, and it is transported through the system in
various pathways through the atmosphere, the land surface, and the subsurface and is stored
temporarily in storages such as the vegetation cover, soil, wetlands, lakes, ﬂood plains,
aquifers, oceans, and the atmosphere. Thus, hydrology deals with understanding the under-
lying physical and stochastic processes involved and estimating the quantity and quality of
water in the various phases and stores. For this purpose, a number of physical and statistical
laws are applied, mathematical models are developed, and various state and input and output
variables are measured at various points in time and space. In addition, natural systems are
increasingly being affected by human intervention such as building of dams, river diversions,
groundwater pumping, deforestation, irrigation systems, hydropower development, mining
operations, and urbanization. Thus, the study of hydrology also includes quantifying the
effects of such human interventions on the natural system (at watershed, river basin, regional,
country, continent, and global scales). Water covers about 70 % of the earth surface, but only
about 2.5 % of the total water on the earth is freshwater and the rest is saltwater (NASA Earth
Observatory website). Of the total amount of the earth’s freshwater, about 70 % is contained
in rivers, lakes, and glaciers and about 30 % in aquifers as groundwater [1].
A related term/concept commonly utilized in hydrology is hydrologic cycle. It conveys
the idea that as water occurs in nature, say in the form of rainfall, part of it may be
temporarily stored on vegetation (e.g., trees), the remaining part reaches the ground surface,
and in turn part of that amount may inﬁltrate and percolate into the subsurface, and another
part may travel over the land surface eventually reaching the streams and the ocean. In
addition, part of the water temporarily stored on the vegetation canopy, the soil, depression
pools, the snow pack, the lakes, and the oceans evaporates back into the atmosphere. That
process of water circulating from the start of the precipitation, traveling through the river
basin (or through the entire earth system), and then evaporating back to the atmosphere is
known as the hydrologic cycle.
This introductory chapter includes seven subjects, namely, hydroclimatology, surface water
hydrology, soil hydrology, glacier hydrology, watershed and river basin modeling, risk and
uncertainty analysis, and data acquisition and information systems. The intent is to discuss some

basic concepts and methods for quantifying the amount of water in the various components of
the hydrologic cycle. However, the chapter content cannot be comprehensive because of space
limitations. Thus, the emphasis has been on recent developments particularly on the role that
atmospheric and climatic processes play in hydrology, the advances in hydrologic modeling of
watersheds, the experiences in applying statistical concepts and laws for dealing with risk and
uncertainty and the challenges encountered in dealing with nonstationarity, and the use of newer
equipment (particularly spaceborne sensors) for detecting and estimating the various compo-
nents of the hydrologic cycle such as precipitation, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration.
Current references have been included as feasible for most of the subjects.
2. HYDROCLIMATOLOGY
All years are not equal when it comes to hydrology and climate. The year-to-year response
of the hydrologic system that results in ﬂoods or droughts is driven by the nonlinear interac-
tions of the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface. While a deterministic understanding of the
complex interactions of these systems may be near impossible, certain patterns have been
identiﬁed that have been correlated to particular hydrologic response in different locations.
These identiﬁed patterns range in spatial and temporal scales as depicted in Fig. 1.1. At the
lower left are the smaller spatial scale and relatively fast evolving atmospheric phenomena
that can impact midlatitude weather systems resulting in different hydrologic outcomes. As
the space and time scale expand, ocean processes start to play a role, and the patterns or
relations are coupled ocean–atmosphere events that can span multiple years and play a role in
spatial patterns of hydrologic response as well as magnitude. The largest spatial and longest
time-scale processes come from the oceanic system and can play a role in decadal variability
of hydrologic response.

The strength of a given pattern and the interactions among multiple identiﬁed patterns
across multiple scales play an important role in the type and level of hydrologic response (e.g.,
ﬂood or drought). In addition, changes to the hydroclimatic system arising from natural and
anthropogenic elements can impact the hydrology in a given location. This section presents an
overview of the climate system and its potential impact on hydrology. Speciﬁed patterns in the
ocean and atmospheric systems will be shown and related to hydrologic response in locations
where a clear connection has been identiﬁed. Hydrologic response to climate change will also
be reviewed noting some of the latest work completed in this area.
2.1. The Hydroclimatic System
The climate for a given location is a function of the nonlinear interactions of multiple
physical processes occurring simultaneously in the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface
systems. The atmosphere responds to changes in solar radiation, tilt and rotation of the
earth, atmospheric constituents, and distribution of heat input from the ocean and land surface
systems. The ocean system responds to changes in wind stresses from the atmosphere as well
as from thermohaline currents at various depths that may be inﬂuenced by the bathymetry of
the different ocean basins and relative positions of the continents. The land system is
inﬂuenced by the temperature of both atmosphere and ocean and develops its own pattern
of heating that is radiated back to the atmosphere as long-wave radiation. All of these
elements play a role in the evolution of weather systems that result in different hydrologic
outcomes.
While physical equations have been developed to describe the different time-evolving
elements of these systems, using them directly to determine their impact on hydrology is
extremely complex and ﬁlled with uncertainty. An alternative approach is to look for
characteristic recurring patterns in the hydroclimatic system and examine their correlation
with hydrologic time series to determine if there is a potential link. In some cases, the
correlation may not be strong, but this may be due to the impact of other patterns or the
combination of processes. Because of this, greater insight may be gained by examining
hydrologic response through the use of probability distributions conditioned upon a given
hydroclimatic patterns or collection of patterns. This can be limited by the available realiza-
tions provided by the observed record.
In the following sections, three scales of hydroclimate patterns identiﬁed in Fig. 1.1 are
presented along with their potential impact on hydrologic response. Examples from observa-
tions or studies that have identiﬁed regions having signiﬁcant correlative response will be
highlighted. Additional factors that can impact extreme events also will be pointed out.
Finally, a discussion of hydrologic response due to climate change will be provided in the
context of scale and forcing of the hydroclimate system.
2.2. Hydroclimatic System Patterns: Atmospheric Patterns
Atmospheric patterns are the smallest in spatial scale and shortest in temporal scale. They
are considered hydroclimatic patterns as they are larger than the scale of weather systems
which is often referred to as the synoptic scale [2]. The synoptic scale has a spatial extent the
4
J.D. Salas et al.

size of time-varying high- and low-pressure systems that form as part of the time evolution of
the atmosphere. These systems are usually 500–1,000 km in spatial extent with extreme cases
being larger. The life cycle of these events as they impact a given location results in a time
scale on the order of 3 days. Patterns of atmospheric hydroclimate evolve on the order of
weeks and have a spatial scale of several thousand kilometers. In addition, the pattern itself
may result in the formation of planetary waves that can impact weather systems far removed
from the pattern itself.
One of the most well-known atmospheric hydroclimate patterns is the Madden-Julian
Oscillation [3]. This continent-sized cluster of convective activity migrates across the tropics
with a periodicity ranging from 30 to 90 days. It is thought that the convective activity excites
planetary scale waves that can interact with weather systems in the midlatitudes which can
lead to enhanced precipitation for some locations. Maloney and Hartmann [4, 5] studied the
inﬂuence of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico.
A second pattern of atmospheric hydroclimate that can inﬂuence midlatitude weather
systems and the resulting hydrologic response is the Arctic Oscillation [6]. This pressure
pattern between the Northern Hemisphere polar region and northern midlatitudes has two
phases called the positive phase and negative phase. In the positive phase, the higher pressures
are in the northern midlatitudes which results in storm tracks shifting northward and conﬁning
arctic air masses to the polar region. As a result, places like Alaska, Scotland, and Scandinavia
tend to be wetter and warmer, while the Mediterranean region and western United States tend
to be drier. The negative phase is the opposite with more cold air movement to the northern
midlatitudes and wetter conditions in the western United States and Mediterranean regions.
The time frame for the oscillations is on the order of weeks. The oscillation does not directly
cause storms but inﬂuences pressure tendencies in the midlatitudes that can facilitate the
formation of storms in select regions. Additional information on this phenomenon can be
found on the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Climate
Prediction Center’s web pages (e.g., http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/
daily_ao_index/teleconnections.shtml).
2.3. Hydroclimatic System Patterns: Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean Patterns
Coupled atmosphere-ocean patterns extend from the scale of atmospheric phenomena to
the scale of select regions in ocean basins. These patterns can persist from months to years and
can have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on atmospheric circulation patterns that result in changes to
storm tracks and observed hydrologic conditions at given locations.
The best-known phenomenon of this type is the El Nin˜o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The
ENSO pattern was discovered in pieces by different researchers in the late 1800s [7]. Subse-
quent studies showed that the variously observed pressure differences, changes in surface
ocean currents, and changes in the equatorial sea surface temperatures in the eastern Paciﬁc
Ocean from the dateline to the coast of South America were all part of the ENSO pattern.
There are three phases to ENSO: a warm (El Nin˜o) phase, a cool (La Nin˜a) phase, and a
neutral phase. Transitions between phases occur in time periods ranging from 2 to 7 years.
While this is a tropical phenomenon, hydrologic impacts occur across the globe as the global

atmosphere responds to the tropical ocean/atmosphere conditions that can persist for more
than a year. Further information on ENSO can be found in Philander [7] and NOAA’s Climate
Prediction Center web pages.
The United States has several regions that have seemingly well-deﬁned hydrologic
responses to the different phases of ENSO. The southeast tends to have colder drier winters
during La Nin˜a. In the west, the Paciﬁc Northwest tends to be wetter (drier) than average
during La Nin˜a/El Nin˜o, while the Southwest is drier (wetter) than average [8]. Cayan
et al. [9] investigated the relationship of ENSO to hydrologic extremes in the western United
States. Gray [10], Richards and O’Brien [11], and Bove et al. [12] have investigated links of
Atlantic Basin hurricane activity to the state of ENSO which has a distinct impact on
hydrologic condition in the Gulf States and Eastern seaboard.
It is important to realize that the ENSO phenomenon tends to impact the atmospheric
circulation patterns. Variability in the positioning of the atmospheric circulation patterns
relative to the land surface can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the observed hydrologic
response for some locations. Figure 1.2 shows a plot of the Multivariate ENSO Index, an
index based on multiple factors to determine the strength of the El Nin˜o or La Nin˜a event
[13]. In Fig. 1.2, red regions are associated with El Nin˜o events, and blue regions are
associated with La Nin˜a events.
2.4. Hydroclimatic System Patterns: Ocean System Patterns
The oceanic component of the hydroclimate system has the longest time scale of evolution
which can lead to interannual to decadal inﬂuences on hydrologic response. Ocean system
patterns that inﬂuence the hydroclimate system are often tied to sea surface temperature
patterns that are driven in part by ocean circulations due to heat content and salinity variations
across the depth and breadth of the ocean basins.
One pattern of oceanic hydroclimate is the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation (PDO). This sea
surface temperature pattern spans the entire Paciﬁc Ocean north of the equator ([14]; Minobe
[15]). In the Atlantic basin, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) has been identiﬁed
by Xie and Tanimoto [16]. Figure 1.3 shows a plot of the PDO and AMO.

Nin˜a events and red regions are associated with El Nin˜o events (source: NOAA, ESRL, http://www.
pmel.noaa.gov/co2/ﬁle/Multivariate+ENSO+Index) (Color ﬁgure online).

For the PDO, there are two phases, a warm phase and a cold phase. In the warm phase of the
PDO, a pool of warmer than average sea surface temperatures extends across the northeast
Paciﬁc. It is surrounded by a ring of cooler-than-normal water to the west. The cold phase has
a cooler-than-average pool of water in the northeast Paciﬁc with a ring of warmer water
surrounding it to the west. The transition between a warm and cold phase occurs between
10 and 30 years. Its discovery was an outcome of a search for causal mechanisms of changes
in ﬁsheries patterns along the coast of North America [14, 18]. Due to ocean patterns’ long
time period of evolution, they tend to serve as a backdrop upon which the shorter time-scale
processes occur. In that sense, impacts tend to relate more to decadal variability rather than
speciﬁc event inﬂuence. Correlations with hydrologic conditions can be found in numerous
studies and reviews (e.g., [19–21]).
Like the PDO, the AMO has a warm and cold phase deﬁned primarily by SST patterns. For
the North Atlantic and the AMO, any linear trends are removed from the SST time series prior
to determining the phase of the AMO to take anthropogenic climate change into account.
Variability in the AMO is associated with the ocean’s thermohaline circulation. Correlations
of the AMO to Northern Hemisphere precipitation and air temperature patterns are also
numerous (e.g., [22–24]).
2.5. Interactions Across Scales and Extreme Events
The phenomena mentioned above do not evolve in isolation, and at any given time,
multiple features can be inﬂuencing midlatitude weather patterns and their associated hydro-
logic response. In some cases, the interactions can mitigate the inﬂuence of one pattern and

may muddle the correlation with hydrologic response in a given location. On the other hand,
there may be times when interactions between the processes occur in such a way that an
unusually extreme event results. In these cases, there may be additional processes such as
atmospheric rivers [25] that come into play.
Atmospheric rivers are narrow bands of high concentrations of atmospheric water vapor
that extend from the tropics to the midlatitudes. When these water vapor bands interact with
the right atmospheric dynamics, extreme precipitation events tend to occur. The relation of
processes such as atmospheric rivers and other hydroclimate patterns and their associated
impact on hydrologic response is an area of open research. NOAA’s Climate Prediction
Center tracks a large collection of these hydroclimate system patterns and has more informa-
tion and references on their website.
2.6. Climate Change
Changes in atmospheric composition impacting the radiative balance of the atmosphere
can have signiﬁcant impacts on hydrologic processes. Increasing temperatures lead to higher
freezing altitudes which lead to higher elevation snow lines. Higher snow lines mean greater
watershed area contributing to runoff during a precipitation event which will result in more
direct runoff and possible higher peak ﬂows. Higher snow lines may result in smaller runoff
volumes during the snowmelt period, changing the shape of the annual hydrograph. Higher
snow lines may also change the local water balances resulting in changes to watershed yields
for water supply purposes.
Methods for assessing hydrologic impacts of climate change are varied. Impacts to annual
and monthly hydrology for water supply purposes have looked at scaled changes to monthly
ﬂow volumes using ratios (e.g., [26–28]). Hydrologic models have been used to determine
changes to ﬂows using temperature and precipitation change estimates from global climate
model projections (e.g., [29–31]). However, these simulations assume that the model calibra-
tion for historical hydrologic conditions is also appropriate for future climate conditions. Such
questions suggest that more research is needed into watershed processes and their potential
change in relationship to each other with different climate conditions. Another option for
expanding the hydrologic realizations of the observed record is to use paleoclimate estimates
of hydrologic variables. For example, this has been done in the United States Bureau of
Reclamation’s Lower Colorado Study [32]. Other methodologies will likely be developed as
more reﬁned climate change projection information becomes available and more planning
studies require consideration of climate change impacts.
2.7. Remarks
Climate plays a signiﬁcant role in hydrologic response. Year-to-year variations in peak
ﬂows, low ﬂows, or annual totals can be related to speciﬁc hydroclimatic patterns through a
variety of correlative methods. Several hydroclimatic patterns have been identiﬁed with
phases lasting from days to years to decades. Climate change may cause fundamental shifts
in hydrologic processes at a given location that may impact the correlative relation between
8
J.D. Salas et al.

the climate phenomena and local hydrologic response. Continued research and development
is needed to move beyond correlative relations to a greater understanding of the physical
processes that enable climate to impact weather that impacts hydrologic response. While a
deterministic mapping of these processes may not be possible due to the complexity and
interaction of the different phenomena, there should be opportunity for examining conditional
probability distributions and their evolution based on the evolution of the climate system.
3. SURFACE WATER HYDROLOGY
3.1. Precipitation
The lifting of moist air masses in the atmosphere leads to the cooling and condensation
which results in precipitation of water vapor from the atmosphere in the form of rain, snow,
hail, and sleet. Following the cooling of air masses, cloud droplets form on condensation
nuclei consisting of dust particles or aerosols (typically < 1 μm diameter). When the con-
densed moisture droplet is larger than 0.1 mm, it falls as precipitation, and these drops grow as
they collide and coalesce to form larger droplets. Raindrops falling to the ground are typically
in the size range of 0.5–3 mm, while rain with droplet sizes less than 0.5 mm is called drizzle.
There are three main mechanisms that contribute to lifting of air masses. Frontal lifting
occurs when warm air is lifted over cooler air by frontal passage resulting in cyclonic or
frontal storms. The zone where the warm and cold air masses meet is called a front. In a warm
front, warm air advances over a colder air mass with a relatively slow rate of ascent causing
precipitation over a large area, typically 300–500 km ahead of the front. In a cold front, warm
air is pushed upward at a relatively steep slope by the advancing cold air, leading to smaller
precipitation areas in advance of the cold front. Precipitation rates are generally higher in
advance of cold fronts than in advance of warm fronts. Oftentimes, warm air rises as it is
forced over hills or mountains due to orographic lifting as it occurs in the northwestern United
States, and the resulting precipitation events are called orographic storms. Orographic
precipitation is a major factor in most mountainous areas and exhibits a high degree of spatial
variability. In convective lifting, warm air rises by virtue of being less dense than the
surrounding air, and the resulting precipitation events are called convective storms or, more
commonly, thunderstorms.
Natural precipitation is hardly ever uniform in space, and spatially averaged rainfall (also
called mean areal precipitation) is commonly utilized in hydrologic applications. Mean areal
precipitation tends to be scale dependent and statistically nonhomogeneous in space. Precip-
itation at any location (measured or unmeasured) may be estimated using an interpolation
scheme that employs linear weighting of point precipitation measurements at the individual
rain gauges over a desired area as
^P x
ð Þ ¼

where ^P x
ð Þ is the precipitation estimate at location x; P(xi) is the measured precipitation at
rain gauge i, that is, located at xi; wi is the weight associated with the point measurement at
station i; and N is the total number of measurements (gauges) being used in the interpolation.
Because of unbiasedness, the following condition P
N
i¼1
wi ¼ 1 must be met.
There are a variety of ways to estimate the weights, wi, depending on the underlying
assumptions about the spatial distribution of the precipitation. Some of the more common
methods are summarized brieﬂy:
(a)
The precipitation is assumed to be uniformly distributed in space, and an equal weight is assigned
to each station so that the estimated rainfall at any point is simply equal to the arithmetic average
of the measured data, i.e.,
wi ¼ 1
N ,
i ¼ 1, . . . , N:
ð1:2Þ
(b)
The precipitation at any point is estimated to equal the precipitation at the nearest station. Under
this assumption, wi ¼ 1 for the nearest station, and wi ¼ 0 for all other stations. This method-
ology is the discrete equivalent of the Thiessen polygon method [33] that has been widely used in
hydrology.
(c)
The weight assigned to each measurement station is inversely proportional to the distance from
the estimation point to the measurement station. This approach is frequently referred to as the
reciprocal-distance approach (e.g., [34]). An example of the reciprocal-distance approach is the
inverse-distance-squared method in which the station weights are given by
wi ¼
1=d2
i
X
N

i

 ,
i ¼ 1, . . . , N,
ð1:3Þ
where di is the distance to station i and N is the number of stations within some deﬁned radius
where the precipitation is to be estimated.
(d)
The weights are calculated using geostatistical methods such as kriging using either the covari-
ance or the variogram function of the precipitation (e.g., [35]). Because the kriging weights are
dependent on spatial continuity of precipitation, kriging techniques are suitable for examining
scale dependency of spatially averaged precipitation [36].
The methods above should not be used to estimate precipitation depths of mountainous
watersheds where the spatial variability is very high. Nowadays, these computations are
facilitated through the use of geographic information systems (GIS) that enable processing
and visualization of data. Figure 1.4 is an example of spatial interpolation of precipitation
over a watershed using kriging techniques.
After specifying the station weights in the precipitation interpolation formula, the next step
is to numerically discretize the averaging area by placing an averaging grid. The deﬁnition of
the averaging grid requires speciﬁcation of the origin, discretization in the x- and y-directions,
and the number of cells in each of the coordinate directions. The precipitation, ^P xj
 
, at the
10

center, xj, of each cell is then calculated using (1.1) with speciﬁed weights, and the average
precipitation over the entire area, P , is given by
P ¼ 1

Aj,
ð1:4Þ
where A is the averaging area, Aj is the area contained in cell j, and J is the number of cells that
contain a portion of the averaging area.
The fractions of precipitation that are trapped inﬁltrate into the ground and ﬁll local
depressions are called abstractions or losses, while the remainder is called excess precipita-
tion, i.e., the fraction that generates runoff. The terms used in abstractions and runoff
computations are illustrated in Fig. 1.5 where precipitation and loss rates are plotted versus
time for a precipitation event. The total precipitation depth P(t) is the area under the plot of
precipitation intensity i. The total precipitation is partitioned into initial abstraction Ia,
continued abstraction Fa, and excess precipitation (which is assumed to be converted into
surface runoff and its accumulation is called cumulative runoff R(t)). The initial abstraction Ia
is the area under the precipitation intensity curve at the beginning of the precipitation event

when all the precipitation is lost through interception, surface storage, inﬁltration, and other
abstractions. The continued abstraction Fa includes losses that occur after the initial abstrac-
tion has been met and primarily represents inﬁltration losses into the soil. Referring to
Fig. 1.5, continued abstraction is the area under the loss rate curve after runoff is initiated,
and the total abstraction S is the sum of Ia and Fa. The excess precipitation R(t) is the area
under the precipitation intensity plot after subtracting the total losses. The ultimate abstraction
S is an estimate of the total abstractions assuming that precipitation continues indeﬁnitely.
3.2. Interception and Depression Storage
Interception is the part of precipitation that is stored on the earth’s surface such as
vegetation. Part of the intercepted water evaporates, but part of it may eventually ﬁlter
through the vegetation and reach the soil surface as throughfall or creep down the branches
as stemﬂow. Studies indicate that interception accounts for 10–30 % of the total rainfall in the
Amazon rainforest depending on the season. Precipitation is also intercepted by buildings and
other aboveground structures as in urban areas and industrial complexes. Methods used for
estimating interception are mostly empirical, where the amount of interception is expressed
either as a fraction of the amount of precipitation or as a function of the precipitation amount.
Interception percentages over seasonal and annual time scales for several types of vegetation
have been summarized by Woodall [37]. These data indicate that, on an annual basis,

interception ranges from 3 % for hardwood litter to 48 % for some conifers. Many interception
formulas are similar to that originally suggested by Horton [38], where the interception, I, for
a single storm, is related to the precipitation amount, P, by an equation of the form
I ¼ a þ b Pn,
ð1:5Þ
where a and b are constants. When I is expressed in millimeters, typical values are n ¼ 1 (for
most vegetative covers), a between 0.02 mm for shrubs and 0.05 mm for pine woods, and
b between 0.18 and 0.20 for orchards and woods and 0.40 for shrubs. The interception storage
capacity of surface vegetation may vary from less than 0.3 mm to 13 mm, with a typical value
for turf grass of 1.3 mm.
Some interception models account for limited storage capacity of surface vegetation and
evaporation during a storm (e.g., [39]) such as
I ¼ S 1  eP=S


þ K
0Et,
ð1:6Þ
where S is the storage capacity of vegetation, P is the amount of precipitation during the
storm, K0 is the ratio of the surface area of one side of the leaves to the projection of the
vegetation at the ground (called the leaf area index), E is the evaporation rate during the storm
from plant surfaces, and t is the duration of the storm. The storage capacity, S, is typically in
the range of 3–5 mm for fully developed pine trees; 7 mm for spruce, ﬁr, and hemlock; 3 mm
for leafed-out hardwoods; and 1 mm for bare hardwoods [40]. More sophisticated models of
interception are described in Ramirez and Senarath [41] and Brutsaert [42].
Interception by forest litter is much smaller than canopy interception. The amount of litter
interception is largely dependent on the thickness of the litter, water holding capacity,
frequency of wetting, and evaporation rate. Studies have shown that it is only a few
millimeters in depth in most cases [43] and, typically, about 1–5 % of annual precipitation
and less than 50 mm/year are lost to litter interception [44].
Water that accumulates in surface depressions during a storm is called depression storage
and can be a major part of the hydrologic budget in ﬂat watersheds [45]. This portion of
rainfall does not contribute to surface runoff. Depression storage is generally expressed as an
average depth over the catchment area, and typical depths range from 0.5 to 7.5 mm.
3.3. Inﬁltration
The process by which water enters into the ground through the soil surface is called
inﬁltration and is usually the dominant rainfall abstraction process. Bare-soil inﬁltration
rates are considered high when they are greater than 25 mm/h and low when they are less
than 2.5 mm/h [46]. The inﬁltration rate f expresses how fast water enters the soil at the
surface. If water is ponded on the surface, the inﬁltration occurs at the potential inﬁltration
rate (often called inﬁltration capacity) and is considered to be limited by soil properties. In
case of rainfall over initially dry soils, the rate of supply of water at the surface (rainfall rate)
is less than the potential inﬁltration rate, all the water enters the soil, and inﬁltration is limited

by rainfall rate. The cumulative inﬁltration F is the accumulated depth of water inﬁltrated
over a given time and is related to inﬁltration rate as

ð1:7aÞ
and
F tð Þ ¼

f tð Þdt:
ð1:7bÞ
The simplest model for inﬁltration is the ϕ index, which is a constant rate of abstraction
such that the excess depth of rainfall equals the direct runoff depth; it has been commonly
used in practice. Our current understanding of water movement through unsaturated soils is
expressed by Richards’ equation, and the inﬁltration process determines the boundary condi-
tion at the soil surface. Since Richards’ equation is nonlinear, simpler empirical models for
inﬁltration are commonly used. For example, Horton [47, 48] expressed potential inﬁltration
rate as
f tð Þ ¼ f c þ f 0  f c
ð
Þekt,
ð1:8Þ
where k is a decay constant and f0 is the initial inﬁltration rate at t ¼ 0 and decreases
exponentially until it reaches a constant rate fc. Philip [49, 50] expressed cumulative inﬁltra-
tion as
F tð Þ ¼ St1=2 þ Kt,
ð1:9Þ
where S is soil sorptivity (a function of the soil suction potential) and K is the saturated
hydraulic conductivity. Thus, the potential inﬁltration rate from this model when water supply
is not limited is
f tð Þ ¼ 1
2 St1=2 þ K:
ð1:10Þ
The two terms in Philip’s equation represent the effects of suction and gravity forces,
respectively, in moving the water to deeper soil locations.
Green and Ampt [51] proposed a simpliﬁed inﬁltration model which approximated the
water content proﬁle in the soil as a sharp front, with the volumetric moisture content equal to
the initially uniform value of θi below the front and saturated soil with moisture content equal
to porosity η above the front. The wetting front penetrates to a depth L in time t since the start
of the inﬁltration process. Water is ponded to a small depth H0 on the soil surface, denoting an
inﬁnite supply of water at the surface. For a control volume extending from the soil surface to
the wetting front of unit area, volumetric continuity yields

where ψ is the suction head at the wetting front.
When the supply of water is limited as it normally occurs during rainfall events, water will
pond on the surface only if the rainfall intensity exceeds the inﬁltration capacity of the soil.
The ponding time tp is the elapsed time between the time rainfall begins and the time water
begins to pond on the soil surface. During pre-ponding times (t < tp), the rainfall intensity is
less than the potential inﬁltration rate, and the soil surface is unsaturated. Ponding is initiated
when the rainfall intensity exceeds the potential inﬁltration rate at t ¼ tp and the soil surface
reaches saturation. With continued rainfall (t > tp), the saturated region extends deeper into
the soil, and the ponded water is available on the soil surface to contribute to runoff.
At incipient ponding conditions, Fp ¼ i tp and the inﬁltration rate equals the rainfall rate
(i.e., f ¼ i) so that

and the inﬁltration rate by (1.13). Pre- and post-ponding inﬁltration rates under supply-

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly the Soil Conservation
Service (SCS), developed the curve number method that is widely used in practice due to
its simplicity and availability of empirical information (SCS, [53, 54]). The method relies on
the use of a single parameter called the curve number CN. Following Fig. 1.5, consider the

where R(t) is the runoff volume (rainfall excess) expressed in the form of depth that results
from precipitation P(t), S is the maximum potential abstraction after runoff begins, Ia is the
initial abstraction before runoff begins, and CN is a curve number. Note that even though R, P,
S, and Ia are essentially volumes, they have units of cm or inches, because these numbers are
expressed over the watershed area. The theoretical justiﬁcation of the foregoing method has
been developed [55, 56].
The curve number CN depends on soil characteristics, land cover, and antecedent
moisture conditions. Information on local soils is available from various sources, including
published NRCS county soil surveys. The standard NRCS soil classiﬁcation system consists
of four groups (A, B, C, and D). Group A soils have low runoff potential and high
inﬁltration rates (greater than 0.76 cm/h) and consist primarily of deep well-drained sands
and gravel. Group B soils have moderate inﬁltration rates (0.38–0.76 cm/h) and consist
primarily of moderately ﬁne to moderately coarse textured soils, such as loess and sandy
loam. Group C soils have low inﬁltration rates (0.127–0.38 cm/h) and consist of clay loam,
shallow sandy loam, and clays. And Group D soils have high runoff potential and low
16
J.D. Salas et al.

inﬁltration rates (less than 0.127 cm/h) and consist primarily of clays with a high swelling
potential, soils with a permanent high water table, or shallow soils over nearly impervious
material. Rather than estimating S for each watershed, NRCS recommends working with a
dimensionless CN with 0  CN  100. A CN of 100 corresponds to S ¼ 0, implying that
all precipitation is converted to runoff. For gauged watersheds, the parameters CN (or S)
and Ia may be determined by calibration. For ungauged watersheds, CN values may be
estimated using tables (SCS, [57]).
3.4. Evaporation and Evapotranspiration
While precipitation brings water from the atmosphere down to the earth, evaporation does
the opposite; it returns water from the earth back to the atmosphere. Evaporation generally
occurs from all water storages such as interception and depression storages and surface water
storages such as lakes and reservoirs. Also water may evaporate from the soil, snow, ice, and
from all bodies that store and carry water. A related phenomenon is the water that is
transported by plants from the root zone to the atmosphere, a process that is called transpi-
ration. In this section, we will discuss the fundamental concepts behind the process of
evaporation from liquid water bodies, soil, and solid water (ice and snow). In addition, we
will discuss several methods for estimating lake evaporation and evapotranspiration from
natural and irrigated ﬁelds and river basins. The study of evaporation is important in
hydrologic and water resources engineering for several reasons. One important reason is in
water balance studies of reservoirs and river basins. For example, in designing the capacity of
a reservoir for municipal water supply, one must take into account the expected losses of
water by evaporation from the planned reservoir. Also, (after the dam is built) during the real-
time operation of the reservoir (to meet the expected water demands), one must consider that
certain amount of water will be lost by evaporation. Another example is the problem of
determining the expected water demands of irrigation systems. One must determine how
much water will be lost by evaporation from the irrigated ﬁeld plus the amount of water that
will be needed by the plant to growth and to transpire.
Globally, about 62 % of the precipitation that falls on the continents is evapotranspired.
About 97 % of this amount is evapotranspiration (ET) from land surface, while 3 % consti-
tutes open-water evaporation. ET exceeds runoff in most river basins and is a major compo-
nent of energy and water vapor exchange between land surfaces and the atmosphere.
3.4.1. Concept of Evaporation
Evaporation denotes the conversion of water in the liquid or solid phase at or near the
earth’s land surface to atmospheric water vapor. In general the term includes evaporation of
liquid water from rivers, lakes, oceans, and bare soil. Related terms include evapotranspira-
tion from vegetative surfaces and sublimation from ice and snow surfaces.
Evaporation can be thought of as a diffusion process in which there exists transfer of water
vapor. This water transfer is caused by a generating force which is the gradient of water vapor
pressure existing in the interface liquid-air. Following Eagleson [58], let us consider a water
body in which the temperature of the water surface is denoted by T0 and the air above the
Introduction to Hydrology
17

water surface is still (no wind) and has temperature T and water vapor pressure equal to e. One
could also assume that just above the water surface, there is a thin layer of saturated air with
temperature equal to that of the water surface, i.e., T0, and saturated vapor pressure denoted by
e0 (the thin layer becomes saturated as a result of a continuous exchange of water molecules
due to vaporization and condensation).
Evaporation from the water body will exist as long as there is a gradient of water vapor
pressure, i.e., whenever the saturated vapor pressure eo (at temperature To) is greater than the
water vapor pressure e of the air above the thin layer. Therefore, one can write
E ¼ K ∂e
∂y ,
ð1:21Þ
where E ¼ evaporation rate, K ¼ mass transfer coefﬁcient, e ¼ vapor pressure, and
y ¼ height. Naturally there must be many other factors besides water vapor pressure that
inﬂuences evaporation rates. They may be categorized as (a) meteorological factors, (b) the
nature of the evaporating surface, and (c) water quality. Meteorological factors include
radiation, vapor pressure, humidity, temperature, wind, and pressure (elevation). Short- and
long-wave radiations are main sources of energy that are necessary for liquid water to become
water vapor. Water temperature at the water surface determines the water vapor pressure just
above the (water) surface. Likewise, air temperature and air moisture determine the water
vapor conditions (pressure) above the water surface. And both the water vapor near the water
surface and that above the surface determine the rate of evaporation as (1.21) suggests. Also
wind has a major effect; it enhances the rate of evaporation due to turbulent convection.
Certainly the nature of the evaporating surface must have some effect on evaporation rates.
For example, under all other conditions being the same, the evaporation rate per unit area from
water must be different than that from ice. One difference is the temperatures at the surfaces
of water and ice and the corresponding saturated water vapor pressures. Another difference is
that the net radiation will vary for both surfaces because of the differences in albedo and
reﬂectivity. Water quality is also important in determining evaporation rates. An example is
the difference in evaporation rates per unit area of clean water versus water with a high
concentration of sediments.
3.4.2. Lake Evaporation
Estimating evaporation rates from open-water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs has been
an active area of study for water scientists and hydrologic engineers for many decades. Many
theories and formulas have been developed for estimating lake evaporation. The various
estimation methods can be classiﬁed as (a) use of pan coefﬁcients, (b) water budget analysis
(mass balance or continuity equation), (c) energy budget analysis (energy balance),
(d) aerodynamic method (diffusion or mass transfer), and (e) combination method (Penman
method).

J.D. Salas et al.

Estimating Lake Evaporation by Pan Coefﬁcients
Measurements of evaporation in a pan or water tank are quite useful for predicting
evaporation rates from any surface such as water and soil. For example, the standard US
National Weather Service Class A pan is a common instrument utilized in the United States. It
has 4 ft. diameter and is 10 in. deep. The pan is ﬁlled with water to a depth of 8 in. The water
surface in the pan is measured by a hook gauge in a stilling well attached to the pan, and
measurements are usually made daily. Water in the pan is ﬁlled back to the full depth of 8 in.
each time a reading of the stilling basin is made. Evaporation readings are adjusted for any
precipitation measured in a standard rain gauge. There are several other types of
evaporimeters that are currently used in many parts of the world. The method (one of the
simplest methods available) involves measuring pan evaporation at or near the lake and using
a pan coefﬁcient. The equation is
EL ¼ cEp,
ð1:22Þ
where EL denotes lake evaporation, Ep is pan evaporation, and c is a pan coefﬁcient. The
coefﬁcient c generally varies with the season, the type of pan, and the region. The average of
the monthly (or seasonal) pan coefﬁcients is smaller than one and about the same as the
coefﬁcient based on annual quantities. For example, for Class A pans, the annual c is of the
order of 0.70. The coefﬁcient 0.7 is generally used in formulas that calculate pan evaporation
to obtain an estimate of lake evaporation. Extensive tables of c are available; see, for instance,
Bras [59].
Estimating Lake Evaporation by the Water Budget Equation
This is the most obvious approach and involves direct measurements of all water inputs,
outputs, and change of water storage in the lake during the time interval Δt considered.
Applying the mass balance (water budget) equation, we can determine the water storage in the
lake at the end of the time interval Δt as S2 ¼ S1 + I + P  E  O  Og where I ¼ surface
inﬂow into the lake, P ¼ precipitation on the lake surface, E ¼ evaporation from the lake,
Og ¼ subsurface seepage, O ¼ surface outﬂow (lake outﬂow or releases), and S1 ¼ lake
storage at the beginning of the time interval. Solving for E gives
E ¼ ΔS þ I þ P  O  Og,
ð1:23Þ
where ΔS ¼ S1  S2. This method may give reasonable estimates of lake evaporation as long
as the measurements (and estimations) of the variables involved are accurate. This can be
generally achieved regarding the terms ΔS and O. However, the terms I and P may or may not
be accurate depending of the particular case at hand. For example, the inﬂow I should be
accurate if a stream gauging station is available upstream and near the lake entrance (it would
be less accurate if the gauging station is located far from the dam site). Also estimates must be
made of the runoff from the ungauged creeks surrounding the lake. Likewise estimates of
P may be accurate or not depending on the size of the lake and the available network of
precipitation gauges. On the other hand, the term Og is generally inaccurate or unknown.
Introduction to Hydrology
19

Estimates of Og can be obtained by calibrating a loss function by taking appropriate mea-
surements in the reservoir during certain periods of time. However, this may not be practical
or possible in large lakes.
Estimating Lake Evaporation by the Energy Budget Method
This approach involves direct measurements or estimation of all sources of energy inputs,
outputs, and change of energy stored in the lake during the time interval Δt considered.
Assuming a lake area unit of 1 cm2 and the time interval of 1 day, the energy budget equation
for the lake in cal/(cm2  day) can be written as
Qθ ¼ Qs  Qr  Ql  Qh  QE þ Qadv,
ð1:24Þ
where Qs ¼ short-wave radiation input, Qr ¼ reﬂected short-wave radiation, Ql ¼ net long-
wave radiation output (atmospheric long wave, reﬂected long wave, and emitted long wave
from the lake), Qh ¼ sensible heat loss (heat conduction at the molecular level), QE ¼ energy
used for lake evaporation, Qadv ¼ net advected energy (due to inﬂow, outﬂow, precipitation,
and seepage), and Qθ ¼ change of energy stored during the time interval considered. One can
simplify this equation by assuming that Qh ¼ BQE in which B is called the Bowen’s ratio.
B may be determined by
B ¼ 0:61

ð1:25Þ
where pa ¼ air pressure in mb, T0 ¼ temperature of the water surface in C, Ta ¼ temper-
ature of the air in C, e0 ¼ saturated water vapor pressure (in mb) at temperature T0, and
ea ¼ water vapor pressure of the air in mb. Then from (1.24), the energy used for lake
evaporation is
QE ¼ Qs  Qr  Ql

Because QE ¼ ρLvE, where ρ ¼ density of water in g/cm3, Lv ¼ latent heat of vaporiza-
tion in cal/g (it can be determined accurately by Lv ¼ 597.3  0.564 T for T  40 C), and
E is the evaporation rate in cm/day (for a 1 cm2 area of the lake), the foregoing equation can be
written as
E ¼ Qn þ Qadv  Qθ
ð

ð1:26Þ
where Qn ¼ Qs  Qr  Ql ¼ net radiation in cal/(cm2day). This term may be estimated
from measurements in a pan (tank) as
Qn ¼ Qnp þ εσ T0p  T0

4,
ð1:27Þ

where Qnp ¼ pan net all-wave radiation in cal/(cm2day) (measured using a net
pyrradiometer), T0p ¼ water surface temperature in the pan in K, σ ¼ 11.71  108 cal/
(cm2  K4  day) (Stefan-Boltzmann constant), and ε ¼ water surface emissivity 	 0.97.
Lastly the term Qadv  Qθ can be determined by accounting the amount of energy contained
in each term of the water budget equation (e.g., [60]).
In addition, pan evaporation may be estimated from (1.26) if the pertinent quantities
involved are either measured or estimated for a pan. For instance, neglecting the term
Qadv  Qθ, an estimate of pan evaporation may be obtained by
Ep ¼ Q

,
ð1:28Þ
where Qnp is the net radiation for the pan in cal/(cm2  day) and the symbol Q0np is used to
emphasize that the net radiation is computed in equivalent units of evaporation. Furthermore,
formulas for estimating pan evaporation as a function of daily solar radiation and air
temperature are available. For example, a formula to estimate pan evaporation developed
based on Class A pan data is given by (e.g., [60])
Ep ¼ Q

where Ep ¼ Q0np ¼ pan evaporation in mm per day, Qs ¼ solar radiation in cal/(cm2 day),
and Ta ¼ air temperature in C. Then, lake evaporation may be determined approximately by
EL ¼ c Ep where c is a pan coefﬁcient. Often a value of c ¼ 0.7 is used for a Class A pan.
Estimating Lake Evaporation by the Mass Transfer Method (Aerodynamic
or Diffusion)
From turbulent convection theory, the vertical ﬂux of water vapor can be written as
E ¼ ρKw
∂q h
∂y ,
ð1:30Þ
where E ¼ lake evaporation rate in g/(cm2  s) (ﬂux), ρ ¼ density (g/cm3), Kw ¼ water
eddy diffusivity (cm2/s), q h ¼ mean speciﬁc humidity, and y ¼ elevation above the lake
water surface (cm). Likewise, from the equation of momentum ﬂux, one can write
τ ¼ ρKm
∂u
∂y ,
ð1:31Þ
where τ ¼ momentum ﬂux or shear stress in g/(cm  s2), Km ¼ kinematic eddy viscosity
(cm2/s), and u ¼ mean wind velocity in the horizontal direction (cm/s). The sketch shown in
Fig. 1.6 summarizes the foregoing concepts.
Introduction to Hydrology
21

Based on the foregoing concepts and equations, it may be shown that an expression for
E can be written as (e.g., [61])
E ¼ d u e0  ea
ð
Þ
ð1:32aÞ
which says that the evaporation rate is a function of both u and e and d is a constant. But
(1.32a) gives zero evaporation if u ¼ 0, which is not realistic. Therefore, a modiﬁed equation
can be written as (e.g., [59])
E ¼ a þ bu
ð
Þ e0  ea
ð
Þ,
ð1:32bÞ
where a and b are coefﬁcients. Recall that e0 is the saturated vapor pressure at the lake surface
temperature T0 and ea is the vapor pressure of the air above the lake. However, in formulas of
this type, the saturated vapor pressure es at the air temperature Ta is often used instead of eo.
Several empirical formulas of the type of (1.32a) and (1.32b) have been developed (e.g.,
[62–65]). For example, Dunne’s formula is
E ¼ 0:013 þ 0:00016u 2
ð
Þ 1  f

Þea,
ð1:33Þ
where E ¼ lake evaporation in cm/day, u 2 ¼ wind speed at 2 m above the lake water surface
in km/day, f ¼ relative humidity of the air above the lake surface (fraction), and ea ¼ vapor
pressure of the air above the lake surface in mb.
Furthermore, mass transfer-based formulas have been developed for estimating pan evap-
oration. For example, an empirical equation for a Class A pan evaporation is [46]
Ep ¼ 0:42 þ 0:0029u p

and ea ¼ water vapor pressure of the air at 1.5 m above the ground surface (mb). Then, lake
evaporation may be estimated as EL ¼ 0.7 Ep.

Estimating Lake Evaporation by Penman’s Equation (Combination Method)
Penman [66] combined the energy budget and the mass transfer methods for estimating
lake evaporation. Essentially it involves combining (1.26) and (1.32) under certain assump-
tions. First of all, the term Qadv  Qθ in (1.26) was neglected or assumed to be negligible;
then in estimating the net all-wave radiation Qn, the temperature of the lake water surface T0
was replaced by the air temperature above the lake, Ta; and then in estimating the effect of
turbulent convection as in (1.32), e0 was replaced by es. Under these conditions, Penman’s
equation is applicable to shallow lakes. Penman showed that the equation for estimating lake
evaporation takes the form
E ¼ ΔQ
0
n þ γEa
Δ þ γ
,
ð1:35Þ
where E ¼ lake evaporation in inches/day or cm/day; Q0n ¼ net all-wave radiation expressed
in the same units as E, i.e., in/day or cm/day (i.e., if Qn is known then Q0n ¼ Qn/(ρLv)); and
Ea ¼ evaporation term estimated by the mass transfer method, e.g., from (1.32b). The
coefﬁcient γ (mb/C) is determined by γ ¼ 0.00061 pa, in which pa is the air pressure in
mb. Likewise, the coefﬁcient Δ is the derivative of es with respect to T evaluated at Ta. An
approximate equation to estimate Δ in units mb/C is [60]
Δ ¼ des
dT ¼ 0:00815Ta þ 0:8912

Ta  25 C:
ð1:36Þ
Therefore, (1.35) gives an estimate of daily lake evaporation if adequate climatological
data are available for a shallow lake. However, to apply (1.35) for deep lakes, where
signiﬁcant energy transfer from deep layers of the lake to the evaporating surface (of the
lake) may occur, in addition to advected energy, one must make an adjustment to the estimate
provided by (1.35). Such an adjustment must include an estimate of the term Qadv  Qθ plus
an adjustment factor α. Recall that (1.35) assumes that the energy advected into the lake is
balanced by a change of heat storage, i.e., Qadv  Qθ 	 0. This assumption may be reason-
able for shallow lakes, but for deep lakes, further corrections may be necessary. For example,
lake evaporation may be adjusted as
E

L ¼ EL þ α Qadv  Qθ
ð

ð1:37Þ
in which E0L ¼ adjusted lake evaporation, EL is the lake evaporation from (1.35), and α is an

where pa ¼ atmospheric pressure in mb, T0 ¼ water temperature of the lake surface in C,
and v4 ¼ 4 m wind speed (upwind from the lake) in km/day.
Introduction to Hydrology
23

Also Penman’s equation can be used to estimate pan evaporation if the variables involved
in the right-hand side of (1.35) correspond to a pan. Thus, if Q0n in (1.35) is obtained for a pan
(for instance, using (1.28) or (1.29)) and Ea is given by (1.34), for example, then E of (1.35) is
an estimate of pan evaporation. Therefore, Penman’s equation for estimating pan evaporation
can be written as
Ep ¼ ΔQ
0
np þ γEap
Δ þ γ
,
ð1:39Þ
where the term Ea in Penman’s equation (1.35) has been replaced by Eap to emphasize that it
refers to an estimate for a pan. Then lake evaporation can be obtained by EL ¼ c∙Ep in which
c is the pan coefﬁcient.
An equation that corrects for the sensible heat transfer through the pan is available.
Assuming that pan evaporation Ep is estimated using Penman’s equation (1.39), the corrected
equation of pan evaporation (mm/day) becomes [60]

Ta ¼ air temperature in C and the + sign after Ep is for T0 > Ta and the – sign otherwise.
And the correction factor αp can be approximated by [60]

No additional correction for advected energy is necessary because it is generally small for a
pan. Then lake evaporation can be determined by multiplying E0p by an appropriate pan
coefﬁcient.
3.4.3. Transpiration, Evapotranspiration, and Consumptive Use
Transpiration is the water vapor discharged to the atmosphere by plants through their
stomatal pores. The factors affecting transpiration are (a) meteorological (e.g., radiation,
temperature, and wind), (b) type of plant (e.g., shallow roots, long roots, and leaves) and
stage of growth, (c) type of soil, and (d) available water. The role of meteorological factors is
similar as for evaporation from free water surface discussed in Sects. 3.4.1 and 3.4.2. In fact,
Penman’s equation has been modiﬁed [67] to determine the evaporation rate from vegetation
surfaces, and the resulting modiﬁed equation has been known as the Penman–Monteith
equation.
Evapotranspiration is a widely used term in hydrology and irrigation engineering. Evapo-
transpiration is the amount of water evapotranspired by the soil and the plants of a given area
of land. A relater term, consumptive use, accounts for evapotranspiration and the amount of
water utilized by plants for growing plant tissue. When the area considered is a watershed or a
24
J.D. Salas et al.

river basin, evapotranspiration includes water evaporated from lakes and in general from all
other sources. In addition, two other terms related to evapotranspiration are potential evapo-
transpiration (PET) and actual evapotranspiration (AET). Potential evapotranspiration is the
expected evapotranspiration rate for the expected (normal) climatic conditions in the area,
under plenty amount of water available in the soil and under complete (dense) vegetation
coverage (i.e., potential evapotranspiration is a maximum evapotranspiration rate under
unlimited water availability). On the other hand, actual evapotranspiration is less or equal
to potential evapotranspiration because it depends on the water available in the soil. Also the
term reference-crop evapotranspiration has been used as being equivalent to PET [66]. Fur-
thermore, additional concepts related to PET such as Bouchet’s complementary relationship
and its advection-aridity interpretation have been suggested (e.g., [68–70]).
Soil moisture tension (refer to Sect. 4), which varies with soil moisture, plays an important
role in the evaporation rate of the water that reaches the plant stomata. Figure 1.7 shows a
schematic of the typical relationship between soil moisture tension and content, the wilting
point (soil moisture level below which plants cannot extract water from the soil), the ﬁeld
capacity (soil moisture level above which water may percolate down below the root zone and
eventually reach the aquifer), and the available water (amount of water that is available to the
plant). Also Fig. 1.8 shows a schematic of an assumed relationship between potential and
actual evapotranspiration as a function of soil moisture.
We illustrate some of the foregoing concepts with a simple example. Assume that at time
t ¼ 0, the soil moisture at a farm lot is at ﬁeld capacity. If the expected precipitation rate is
12 mm/week and the consumptive use is 30 mm/week, how often and how much one must
irrigate? Without any further information given for the problem, a simple approach could be
to irrigate at a rate so as to make up for the deﬁcit and to keep the soil moisture at the ﬁeld
capacity level. In this case, the irrigation rate would be 30  12 ¼ 18 mm/week. However,
one may like to take into account the water availability of the soil, the depth of the root zone,
and the operating irrigation policy. For instance, suppose that the ﬁeld capacity is 30 %

(in volume), the wilting point is 10 %, and the root zone depth is 300 mm. Then the
corresponding amounts of water for the 300 mm root zone are θFC ¼ 0.30  300 ¼ 90 mm
(ﬁeld capacity) and θWP ¼ 0.10  300 ¼ 30 mm (wilting point), and the available water is
AW ¼ 90  30 ¼ 60 mm. In addition, suppose the operating policy is such that we would
like to avoid drying up the soil beyond 50 mm. Since at the beginning of the week, the soil
moisture is at ﬁeld capacity, i.e., θ0 ¼ 90 mm; after one week, the soil moisture will go down
to θ1 ¼ 90 + 12  30 ¼ 72 mm > 50 mm. Similarly, at the end of the second week (without
irrigation), the soil moisture becomes θ2 ¼ 72 + 12  30 ¼ 54 mm, i.e., at the end of the
second week, the soil moisture reaches the limiting threshold of 54 mm. Then, one may
irrigate 90  54 ¼ 36 mm every 2 weeks to comply with the operating policy.
Methods for Estimating Consumptive Use
There are several methods available for estimating consumptive use as a function of
climatic factors such as temperature and radiation and type of vegetation (e.g., [71–73]).
For example, the Blaney-Criddle empirical equation [74] gives the consumptive use as a
function of temperature, the percentage of daytime hours, and a crop use coefﬁcient. The
consumptive use for a given month t can be determined by
ut ¼ 1=100
ð
ÞKtTtDt,
ð1:42Þ
where ut ¼ consumptive use for month t (inches), Kt ¼ crop use coefﬁcient for month t,
Tt ¼ mean monthly air temperature F, and Dt ¼ % of the annual daytime hours occurring
during month t (it varies with the latitude, the month, and the hemisphere). Table 1.1 provides
values of Dt as a function of latitude and month of the year. Then, the total consumptive use
U throughout the irrigation season is

We apply the Blaney-Criddle method to determine the total consumptive use and the net
water required for an irrigation area located in eastern Colorado (with approximate latitude of
40N). The irrigation area of 100 acres is planned where 20 % of the land will grow beans and
80 % potatoes. Consider the crop coefﬁcients 0.65 and 0.70 for beans and potatoes, respec-
tively, and the growing seasons June–August and May–September, respectively. The average
monthly precipitation and temperature data for the referred months are shown in columns
2 and 3 of Table 1.3. We will apply (1.44) for each crop, and then, the total consumptive use
for the 100-acre area in units of acre-ft can be determined by

where N(b) and N(p) are the number of months of the growing season for beans and potatoes,
respectively, and Ks(b) and Ks(p) refer to the crop coefﬁcients, respectively. The computa-
tions are carried out in Table 1.3. From the foregoing equation and the results of the table, we

The Blaney-Criddle method has been quite popular in practice for several decades. It is still
used because of its simplicity. However, Penman [66] and Monteith [67] laid the foundation
for an energy-based method, which has been known in literature as the Penman–Monteith
method. Perhaps the most recent manual on the subject published in the United States has
been prepared by a task committee sponsored by the Environmental Water Resources
Research Institute (EWRI) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) [72]. The
committee recommended a “standardized reference evapotranspiration equation” denoted as
ETSZ which may be applicable for a reference ET for a short crop (e.g., clipped grass with

where Δ ¼ slope of the saturation vapor pressure-temperature curve (kPa/C), Rn ¼ net
radiation at the crop surface (MJ/(m2  day)), G ¼ soil heat ﬂux density at the soil surface
(MJ/(m2  day)), γ ¼ psychrometric constant (kPa/C), u2 ¼ mean daily wind speed at 2-m
height (m/s), es ¼ saturation vapor pressure (kPa) at 1.5–2.5-m height calculated as the
average of the es obtained for maximum and minimum air temperature, ea ¼ mean actual
vapor pressure at 1.5–2.5-m height (kPa), and T ¼ mean daily air temperature at 1.5–2.5-m
height (C). Note that the constants 900 (numerator) and 0.34 (denominator) must be changed
to 1,600 and 0.38, respectively, for daily tall reference ET, and different sets of constants must
be used for calculations of hourly ET. The referred manual [72] provides the needed equations
for calculating the various terms in (1.45) along with explanatory appendices and examples.
Equation (1.45) has been tested for 49 sites throughout the United States and found to be
reliable.
Furthermore, the estimation of the crop evapotranspiration ETc (i.e., consumptive use)
requires an appropriate crop coefﬁcient Kc, i.e., ETc ¼ Kc ETSZ, where Kc varies depending on
whether ETSZ is for short reference or long reference ET. Allen et al. [72] provides the various
key references available in literature for determining the appropriate values of Kc. The crop
coefﬁcient varies with crop development stage and ranges from 0 to 1 (e.g., about 0.2 for
young seedlings to 1.0 for crops at peak growing stage, although in some cases Kc may reach
values greater than 1, depending on the crop and weather conditions). For illustration Table 1.4
gives values of Kc for commonly grown crops in the State of Colorado [76].
We include a hypothetical example, similar to the previous one, but with additional
concepts and details. For this purpose, we consider a farm lot with a soil having ﬁeld capacity
equal to 30 % (in volume) and wilting point 10 %. The root zone depth is equal to 30 cm, the
crop evapotranspiration ETc (consumptive use) has been calculated as 30 mm/week, and the
expected precipitation is 10 mm/week (for the sake of simplicity, we use weeks as the time
frame; the calculations would be more realistic using a daily time step). It is also assumed that
the actual evapotranspiration AET is equal to ETc whenever the soil moisture is at ﬁeld
capacity or greater; otherwise the actual evapotranspiration decreases linearly from ETc to
zero at the wilting point (refer to Fig. 1.8). In addition, it is assumed that in the past several
days, it has been raining so that at the time of planting the soil moisture is at ﬁeld capacity
(level). However, after planting supplementary irrigation may be needed to make up for the
soil moisture deﬁcit. Irrigation guidelines for the crop at the referred site suggest avoiding the
soil moisture falling below 60 % of the ﬁeld capacity level at any given time. The question is
how much to irrigate and how often, to sustain the crop growth at the farm level.

Summarizing, the following data are speciﬁed: θFC ¼ 30 %, θWP ¼ 10 %, y ¼ 30 cm,
ETc ¼ 30 mm/week, θ0 ¼ θFC, and θt > 0.60 θFC for any t. Then, for a soil depth of 300 mm,
the ﬁeld capacity (in mm) is equal to θFC ¼ 0.30  300 ¼ 90 mm, the wilting point (in mm)
is θWP ¼ 0.1  300 ¼ 30 mm, the available water AW ¼ 90  30 ¼ 60 mm, and θt > 0.6

irrigation in the ﬁrst week, by the end of the week, the soil moisture depth becomes θ1 ¼

Likewise, assuming no irrigation for the second week, the soil moisture by the end of the
second week is θ2 ¼ θ1 + P  AET2 ¼ 70 + 10  20 ¼ 60 mm > 54 mm, and the actual
evapotranspiration for the third week is AET3 ¼ 15 mm. Further, if we continue the third
week with no irrigation, the soil moisture by the end of the third week becomes θ3 ¼ θ2 +
P  AET3 ¼ 60 + 10  15 ¼ 55 mm > 54 mm. If we let another week without irrigation, it
may be shown that the soil moisture will fall below the threshold 54 mm; thus, it is apparent
that we would need to irrigate in the following weeks. Table 1.5 gives the results of
calculations following the procedure as shown above except that supplementary irrigation
of 10 mm is considered every other week. Note that in the hypothetical example, we simply
used the expected precipitation rate of 10 mm/week. In an actual situation, the weekly
precipitation can be updated from measurements. The values in Table 1.5 suggests that
irrigating more than 10 mm every other week will result in higher soil moisture levels and
consequently higher values of AET. In fact, if we over-irrigate, it may cause the soil moisture
to exceed the ﬁeld capacity θFC so that not only the AET will be at the maximum rate but also
the excess water will percolate down to lower levels (in that case, the soil moisture balance
must include the deep percolation term DP as shown in Fig. 1.9) and the irrigation water
would not be used efﬁciently.
3.5. Runoff
Runoff is a term used to denote the excess water from precipitation that is available on the
land surface after abstractions. Estimations of surface ﬂows over a watershed are used for
designing hydraulic structures such as bridges, spillways, dams, levees, storm sewers, cul-
verts, and detention basins. They are also useful for ﬂood management programs, especially
for delineating ﬂood plains. The inﬂuence of land use changes over time can also be
represented in mathematical models of watershed runoff. Also runoff estimates are a

prerequisite for computation of sediment transport and associated chemicals. There are
numerous mechanisms of runoff generation that often occur in combination to produce
streamﬂow.
Hortonian overland ﬂow occurs from a catchment when rainfall exceeds the ability of the
soil to inﬁltrate water and the excess water moves on the surface downslope. For Hortonian
overland ﬂow to occur, the rainfall intensity must be greater than the saturated hydraulic
conductivity of the soil, and the duration of the rainfall event must be long enough to achieve
surface saturation. Hortonian overland ﬂow is prominent in (1) semiarid to arid regions where
rainfalls tend to be intense and natural surface conductivities are low, (2) areas where surface
conductivity has been reduced by compaction, and (3) impermeable areas. Horton’s [47] view
was modiﬁed by Betson [77], who proposed the partial-area concept according to which
surface water may originate as Hortonian overland ﬂow on a limited contributing area that
varies from basin to basin.
In many forested catchments, rainfall intensity rarely exceeds the saturated conductivity of
the surface soil, and saturation-excess overland ﬂow develops because rain falls on tempo-
rarily or permanently saturated areas (wetlands) with no storage for water to inﬁltrate.
Saturation overland ﬂow is liable to be a dominant runoff mechanism in drainage basins
with concave hillslope proﬁles and wide, ﬂat valleys. When slowly moving subsurface water
encounters saturated areas near the stream, some of the water reemerges onto the ground
surface because the capacity of the soils to transmit all of the incoming water downslope is
insufﬁcient.
The areas of a catchment that are prone to saturation tend to be near the stream channels or
where groundwater discharges to the surface. These areas grow in size during a storm and
shrink during extended dry periods [65, 78, 79]. The areas on which saturation-excess
overland ﬂow develops expand and shrink during a storm in response to rainfall reﬂecting
the overall wetness of the watershed. This mechanism of runoff generation is often referred to
as the variable source area concept and was modeled by Govindaraju and Kavvas [80]. Var-
iable source areas exert a very strong inﬂuence on the nature of the streamﬂow hydrograph for
a storm event.
Most hydrologic models treat the overland ﬂow process as fully turbulent, broad sheet ﬂow,
which may be satisfactory for computing runoff rates. However, overland ﬂow can occur over

large parts of the landscape, and the depths and velocities of ﬂow can be extremely variable.
The microrelief of most natural soil surfaces is highly variable, resulting in nonuniform ﬂow
depths across the surface. The ﬂow concentration is sometimes called rills, and the areas
between rills are called interrill areas. The degree that ﬂow concentrations occur on a surface
depends on soil cover, tillage, natural roughness, and soil erodibility.
Further, the interaction of overland ﬂow with inﬁltration is strongly modulated by spatial
heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties. Speciﬁcally, water running downstream may
inﬁltrate into regions characterized by moisture deﬁcit leading to the runon process that, in
principle, should be represented through a coupled solution of overland ﬂow and inﬁltration
equations. The assumption of spatially uniform inﬁltration and rainfall excess is an important
limitation in most current modeling approaches of surface ﬂows over natural surfaces. Runon
has been incorporated in analyzing inﬁltration and Hortonian surface runoff (e.g., [81–85]).
Morbidelli et al. [85] presented a simple methodology that allows for an explicit representa-
tion of the runon process at the watershed scale.
Water that has inﬁltrated the soil surface and is impeded from downward movement due to
stratiﬁcation (abrupt or gradual) tends to move laterally in shallow soil horizons as subsurface
storm ﬂow or interﬂow. While this subsurface water generally moves slowly to the stream and
contributes to baseﬂow, it may be energized by the presence of preferential ﬂow pathways
(e.g., soil cracks, old animal burrows, decayed root channels) leading to quickﬂow response in
the stream. The response of interﬂow to rainfall events would be sluggish if it is not aided by
the presence of macropores where Darcian ﬂow through the soil matrix is largely short-
circuited by water moving in conduits. Macropores are typically on the order of 3–100 mm in
diameter and are interconnected to varying degrees; thus, they can allow water to bypass the
soil matrix and move rapidly at speeds much greater than those predicted by Darcy’s law.
Stillman et al. [86] show that the effective conductivity of soils increased by several orders of
magnitudes in the presence of macropores. The combination of macropores and tile drains
was shown to generate Hortonian-like streamﬂow responses even when no surface ﬂow was
observed. It is generally difﬁcult to assess the importance of macropores or to simulate their
effects in catchment-scale models because their number, orientation, size, and interconnec-
tedness are highly site-speciﬁc and macroscopic properties have to be obtained through
calibration.
In general, groundwater ﬂow results in the longest travel time (days, weeks, to years) for
the water that fell on the soil surface to eventually reach the stream. Streamﬂows during the
dry periods are comprised almost entirely of groundwater discharge or baseﬂow. Conse-
quently, baseﬂow tends to vary slowly and over long time periods in response to changing
inputs of water through net recharge. The unsaturated portion of the soil holds water at
negative gauge pressures (i.e., water pressure is less than atmospheric pressure). The hydrau-
lic resistance offered by the unsaturated soil is high, resulting in low ﬂux rates (see Sect. 4.1).
Flow through the unsaturated zone is one of the primary mechanisms of replenishing the
aquifer through recharge. In special cases, unsaturated ﬂow may contribute to baseﬂow in a
stream [87].

4. SOIL MOISTURE HYDROLOGY
“Soils sustain life” [88]. Many factors are embedded in that statement. From the hydrologic
perspective, the key is soil moisture (soil water), and the mechanism for storing soil water is
capillarity. More fundamentally the answer to how soils sustain life is the surface tension of
water. Soil moisture is commonly considered the water in the root zone that enables the
interaction with atmospheric processes such as precipitation and air temperature; it recycles
water back to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration and serves as the medium for
inﬁltration and subsurface recharge.
4.1. Basic Concepts and Deﬁnitions
Some key concepts related to soil water are:

Weak intermolecular attractions called van der Waals forces hold water together.
Intermolecular forces are feeble; but without them, life as we know it would be impossible. Water would not
condense from vapor into solid or liquid forms if its molecules didn’t attract each other. [89]
l
Surface tension is a force per unit area acting at air-water interfaces, because water molecules are
attracted to themselves rather than to air. Where the air-water interface contacts a solid (i.e., soil
particle), a contact angle forms to balance forces on the liquid water at the contact, which allows
the curvature of an air-water interface to balance capillary forces. In this way, surface tension
combines with the geometry of solids, or porous media, to cause capillarity.
l
Capillarity holds water in small pores, while allowing pressure continuity and drainage of water
from larger pores at a given water pressure or matric potential. Soil water can be retained or stored
in the near-surface soils for extraction by plants at matric potentials up to a wilting point of
approximately 15 bars or 15 atmospheres of negative pressure.
Water is stored in the near surface primarily due to capillary forces that counteract gravity.
As soils drain and dewater, smaller pores hold the remaining water, and the resulting
hydraulic conductivity decreases rapidly. Mualem [90] quantiﬁed the unsaturated hydraulic
conductivity K using the concept of a bundle of capillary tubes with a distribution of diameters
representing the pore throats in real porous media. As a result, K of a soil having complex
geometry has been quantiﬁed using the relatively simple equation:

in which θ is volumetric water content [m3 m3] with subscripts r and s denoting residual and

water content is related to a pore water distribution function of the pore radii together with the
capillary law, in which ψ is inversely proportional to the pore radius. Subsequently, van

The parameter β comes from the ﬁtted water retention curve of (1.49). Mualem [90]
explored a range of η values (1.0 to 2.5) over a large data set (45 soils) and found that an
average value of approximately η ¼ 0.5 was optimal.
How well do these (1.49) and (1.50) ﬁt measured soil characteristics? Many studies have
reported water retention (storage) data relevant to (1.49), but ﬂux data relevant to estimating
hydraulic conductivity (1.50) are rarely measured. A high-quality data set for a silt loam soil is
shown in Fig. 1.10. The van Genuchten (vG) equation (1.49) ﬁts the water retention data well
over the range of measured soil water contents (left in Fig. 1.10). However, the default
(predictive) Mualem-van Genuchten (MvG) equation (1.50) with η ¼ 0.5 overestimated

measured values of K at high values of soil water suction (right in Fig. 1.10). By ﬁtting the
η value (η ¼ 4.7), the ﬁtted K is excellent over 6 orders of magnitude. Note that this value of
the saturation exponent is greater than the upper limit explored by Mualem [90]. Figure 1.10
(right) also illustrates how poorly the Gardner (1958) equation ﬁts the K data due to its
exponential structure, and the ﬁt cannot be improved further by parameter adjustment.
Gardner’s equation is commonly used for its quasi-linear mathematical convenience, but
this example offers caution. More recently, Rucker et al. [93] presented a method for
improved parameter equivalence between MvG and Gardner equations, given the utility of
Gardner’s exponential form.
This example soil (Ida silt loam is not an extreme example) allows us to illustrate some
possible time scales associated with soil hydraulic properties at different moisture states. Six
orders of magnitude in K from saturation (θ ¼ 0.55 m3 m3) to the assumed wilting point of
plants (15 bar or approximately θ ¼ 0.20 m3 m3) are indicative of the potential range of
temporal responses in soils (assuming a unit vertical gradient or gravity drainage). For
example, 1 year ¼ 365  86,400 s ¼ 31.5  106 s, such that the same amount of water
draining in about half a minute at saturation would take a full year at 15 bar.
Perhaps as impressive a contrast is the change in K going from saturation to 100 cm of
suction. In this example, very little water is drained (Δθ ~ 0.05 m3 m3), but K decreases by a
factor of approximately 20. At θ ~ 0.5 m3 m3, K ¼ 105 cm s1, or less than 9 mm day1,
water is being stored in the root zone for plant extraction at a maximum daily rate similar to
the drainage rate. Subsequently, as the soil drains and dries further, root water uptake is the
dominant sink.
Intermolecular forces in a soil water system may be depicted as shown in Fig. 1.11 [96],
where moisture tension or matric suction is shown (in a log-log scale) to be a power function
of water ﬁlm thickness in soil. Here water ﬁlm thickness is deﬁned as a representative length
of the water-solid interface to the air-water interface. Hygroscopic water is in very close
proximity with the solid surface (within approximately 0.2 μm) and is considered immobile
under subsurface environmental conditions. Field capacity is a commonly used term (see
Sect. 3.4), but not well deﬁned. Soils do drain under gravitational force (unit vertical gradient)

at rates determined by K(ψ), such that capillary water drains at different rates. However, the
drastically reduced rates of drainage (Fig. 1.10 right) allow soil water to be stored over a range
of time scales (minutes to years).
4.2. Soil Moisture Recycling
In addition to soils storing water for plant growth, water evaporated from soils and
transpired by plants is recirculated into the atmosphere, thus promoting a positive feedback
mechanism for precipitation. The importance of this feedback seems to depend on the scale of
interest. At the global scale, circulation of water between the land, atmosphere, and ocean is
obviously important. Simulation of such circulation patterns is the basis for projecting future
climates in general circulation models (GCMs). Moving down in scale to individual conti-
nents, basins, and regional watersheds, the coupling of land-atmosphere interactions may
become looser. For this reason, hydrologic models are typically run “off-line” (not coupled
with an atmospheric model to capture these land-atmosphere feedbacks) and driven by
measured precipitation without considering feedbacks. However, regional-scale feedback
has been shown to account for a “weakly dependent” pattern of annual rainfall via “precip-
itation recycling” in central Sudan [97], the Amazon Basin [98], and other regions of the
world (e.g., [99]). At linear scales of <300 km (i.e., watershed areas <90,000 km2), however,
the recycling ratio (P/ET) of a watershed is expected to be less than 10 % based on simple
scaling of annual precipitation in the Amazon Basin [100]. More recently, Koster et al. [101]
described the Global Land–Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (GLACE) as a model
intercomparison study addressing the effects of soil moisture anomalies that affect precipita-
tion at the GCM grid cell resolution over the globe. The simulated strength of coupling
between soil moisture and precipitation varied widely, but the ensemble multi-GCM results
provided “hot spots” of relatively strong coupling based on a precipitation similarity metric.
Koster et al. [101] discussed differences between their approach and the methods of estimat-
ing “recycling” above, but all studies indicate that the land’s effect on rainfall is relatively
small, though signiﬁcant in places, relative to other atmospheric processes.
4.3. Variability of Soil Moisture
Soil moisture varies spatially (laterally and vertically) and temporally with characteristic
periodicities (from inﬁltration events to diurnal, seasonal, annual cycles) and longer-term
variability related to climatic variability (e.g., ENSO, PDO, and AMO) and projected climate
change. As noted in Sect. 4.1, soil moisture response times are controlled primarily by
moisture-dependent soil hydraulic properties. Generally, soils in humid climates respond
much faster to a unit of inﬁltrated water than similar soils in more arid climates. This
highlights an interaction between climate and soil physical characteristics (related to soil
texture and structure). Delworth and Manabe [102] found global patterns of soil moisture in
simulations, where the surface energy balance controlled soil moisture interactions with the
atmosphere. The partitioning of sensible and latent (evaporative) heat ﬂuxes were inﬂuenced
strongly by soil moisture. This caused longer response times in soil moisture at high latitudes

(moving from the equator to the poles) associated with lower potential evaporation.
Therefore, depending upon the scale of interest, one may need to consider coupled land
(soil and vegetation)-atmosphere interactions to assess the spatial and temporal variability of
soil moisture.
Proﬁle soil moisture dynamics can also vary spatially by hillslope position in semiarid
(e.g., [103]) and more humid environments [104, 105].
Spatial variability of soil moisture may be related to short-term hydrologic processes, land
management, and weather patterns and to long-term soil development and terrain attributes.
Spatial soil moisture has been correlated with terrain attributes, such as surface slope, aspect,
curvature, potential upslope contributing area, and attributes derived from these quantities.
The processes causing these correlations usually are not identiﬁed rigorously, but the inferred
factors include short-term hydrometeorological ﬂuxes and long-term pedologic and geomor-
phic processes.
Zaslavsky and Sinai [106] related near-surface (0–0.4 m) soil moisture variation to
topographic curvature (Laplacian of elevation) in Israel, citing processes of unsaturated
lateral subsurface ﬂow and raindrop splash affected by local surface curvature. Slope-oriented
soil layering and the associated state-dependent anisotropy [107, 108], as well as lateral ﬂow
caused by transient wetting and drying [109], likely caused the observed soil moisture
variability.
In a more humid environment in Australia [110], soil moisture variability has been related
to topographic attributes, including ln(a), where a is the speciﬁc contributing area or a
potential solar radiation index (PSRI) as a function of topographic slope, aspect, and solar
inclination (latitude). More recently, data from Australia and other sites have been reanalyzed
using empirical orthogonal functions (EOF’s) for space-time interpolation of soil moisture
[111], and the EOF parameters were correlated with the mean soil moisture state and
topographic attributes [112, 113]. In this way, spatially explicit patterns of soil moisture are
estimated rather than relating a lumped statistical distribution of soil moisture to the spatial
mean, as previously inferred using the variable inﬁltration capacity (VIC) model [114].
4.4. Scaling of Soil Moisture
The variance of soil moisture within an area typically increases with the size or spatial
extent of the area [115]. Green and Erskine [116] and Green et al. [117] conducted ﬁeld-
scale experiments to measure spatial attributes of soil moisture, soil hydraulic properties
(water inﬁltration capacity), crop yield, and landscape topography for spatial scaling and
modeling in rain-fed agricultural terrain. The spatial sampling design for soil water
(Fig. 1.12a) provided a range of sample spacings, and these samples were used to estimate
the lumped statistical distribution of water content for each sample date illustrated with
histograms (Fig. 1.12b).
Fractal geometry was found to characterize the spatial autocorrelation structure of these
spatial variables. “Simple” or monofractal geometry was inferred for soil moisture using
power-law semi-variograms (Fig. 1.13a–e). The ﬁtted power-law models plot as straight lines
on a log-log scale (Fig. 1.13f), which shows the temporal variability of the spatial structure.

power-law multiplier and exponent, respectively, where b is related to the Hurst exponent or fractal
dimension [116].
Introduction to Hydrology
39

Steeper lines in June and their associated higher values of the model exponent correspond to
greater spatial organization, which yields a higher Hurst exponent and lower fractal
dimension [116].
In a different agricultural ﬁeld in Colorado, Green et al. [117] estimated steady inﬁltration
rates from single-ring inﬁltrometer measurements at 150 nested sample locations spanning
10 hillslope positions (30-m by 30-m sites). Fractal behavior was analyzed using fractional
moment analysis and power-law variogram ﬁts to estimate the multifractal exponent or the
monofractal Hurst exponent H as a function of the maximum lag distance hmax. The spatial
values of inﬁltration displayed persistence (H > 0.5) up to a maximum H ¼ 0.9 at approx-
imately 200 m, followed by a decline in H down to a value of H ¼ 0.14 for hmax ¼ 600 m.
Because such “pre-asymptotic” behavior [118] in inﬁltration fractal behavior and persis-
tence may be due to the sparseness of the measurements between landscape positions, terrain
attributes computed from a 5-m grid DEM were used as surrogate spatial data. Terrain
attributes (slope and contributing area) displayed similar variations in fractal behavior using
the dense terrain data. Spatial persistence was identiﬁed at hillslope scales (approximately
200 m) with much lower values of H at smaller and larger scales. Green et al. [117] surmised
that hillslope-scale processes affecting soil erosion, deposition, and development may account
for the deviations from pure fractal behavior. Based on previous numerical simulations [119],
areal inﬁltration capacity decreases with increasing values of H, for a given variance in
saturated hydraulic conductivity. If H changes with the scale of analysis, as indicated here,
pre-asymptotic persistence of inﬁltration rates at hillslope scales may be larger than expected
at ﬁeld to watershed scales.
Advances in hydrologic simulation and spatial quantiﬁcation for precision agriculture and
conservation require prediction of landscape-related variability and the transfer of informa-
tion across spatial scales. The studies referenced here provided insights and methods for
scaling inﬁltration, soil water content, and crop yield related to landscape topography.
5. HYDROLOGY OF GLACIERS
The cryosphere is an important component of the hydroclimate system, and the melt of
snow and ice plays a vital role in the hydrologic cycle of river basins [120]. In recent decades,
there has been a major concern of water resources specialists and policy makers regarding the
accelerated decline of glaciers worldwide. It has been argued that such decline has been
occurring due to global warming resulting from a number of factors such as the effects of
increasing atmospheric concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, the effect of land
use changes, and other human activities. Regardless the loss of glacier cover may have a
signiﬁcant impact on the availability of water resources in various parts of the world, such as
the Andean and Himalayan regions. For example, it has been estimated that glacier decline
may have a signiﬁcant impact on hydropower production in the Peruvian Andes Mountains
[121]. This section describes brieﬂy the methods commonly available for estimating ice melt/
snowmelt. A more detailed discussion on the subject can be found in Singh et al. [122] and the
references cited below.

J.D. Salas et al.

5.1. Basic Concepts and Deﬁnitions
A glacier is a body of solid water in a perennial state that gains mass through solid
precipitation (primarily snow) and loses it by melting and sublimation of ice. The relationship
between the gain and loss of mass of water is known as glacier mass balance. The area where
the accumulation of mass occurs is called the accumulation zone and is located at the top of
the glacier, where, by the action of gravity, it moves downward towards the lower parts of the
glacier. A glacier behaves as a viscoplastic body that becomes deformed because of its own
weight [123]. Generally the solid precipitation (snow) that is subject to temperature below
0 C is transformed into ice. In addition, the albedo is generally above 0.6 which avoids the
exchange of energy with the surface of the glacier. At the lower part of the glacier, there is the
ablation zone where the process of fusion takes place with more intensity and snow and ice are
melted (Fig. 1.14). This mainly occurs on the surface, in part because of the temperature
(above 0 C) and liquid precipitation that allows the albedo to be below 0.4. The ablation and
the accumulation zones are separated by an imaginary line known as glacier equilibrium line
Fig. 1.14. Andean Glacier where it can be seen as the accumulation and ablation zones separated by
the glacier equilibrium line ELA (line of segments) (personal communication from Bernard Pouyaud).
Introduction to Hydrology

(ELA) where the glacier mass balance is zero (no gain or loss of mass) and is usually found
close to the isotherm 0 C. A related term is the line (elevation) of the annual end-of-the
summer snowline (EOSS) which sometimes is used as a surrogate for glacier mass balance
values [124]. The dynamics in the accumulation and ablation zones is mainly controlled by
the energy balance and the topography of the area where the glacier is located.
The study of glaciers has a broad interest, ranging from paleoclimatology (isotopic dating
of ice cores, reconstitution of moraines, etc.) to future scenarios of the evolution of the glacier
coverage as time evolves. From a hydrologic perspective, the most relevant processes are the
ice melting and the ensuing contribution of glacier meltwater to river discharge. The dynam-
ics of glaciers are complex because of the physical processes involved, the topographic
conditions, the geographical area where it is located, and the climatic conditions of the
area. A simple conceptualization assumes that a glacier consists of a system of three
components: snow, ﬁrn, and ice.
5.2. Glacial and Snow Fusion Methods
The processes of ice melt and snowmelt are driven by different factors such as energy
exchange, albedo, temperature, slope, shading, and orientation. A number of methods have
been proposed in literature for estimating the amount of ice melt and snowmelt (e.g.,
[125–127]). The methods are based on one or more of the several processes and variables
involved. The modeling of ice and snow fusion in the midlatitude areas is similar as in the
tropical regions, except for the difference of seasonal climatic conditions. Currently there are
two types of methods used for estimating the glacial melting and snowmelting: the
temperature-index (often called degree-day) method and the energy balance method. Also
hybrid methods have been suggested. The details and experience of the various methods have
been reviewed by Hock [126, 127].
5.2.1. Temperature-Index Methods
The temperature-index methods are based on conceptual models that are formulated as
lumped (global) or semi-distributed levels. They are generally based on empirical relation-
ships between the ice melt/snowmelt and the air temperature. This is because of the strong
correlation that exists between these two variables. For example, Braithwaite and Olesen
[128] found a correlation of 0.96 between annual ice melt and positive air temperature.
Despite that several other factors besides air temperature inﬂuence the ice melt/snowmelt
rate, the main reason why temperature-index-based models generally give quite satisfactory
estimates of ice melt/snowmelt is because of the signiﬁcant relationship between some of the
key physical factors involved with temperature. For example, long-wave radiation and
sensible heat ﬂux generally are the largest source of heat for the melting of ice and snow.
And both heat ﬂuxes are strongly affected by air temperature (Ohmura [120]). A detailed
review of the physical basis and the various factors involved in temperature-based models,
their usefulness, limitations, and experience can be found in Ohmura [120] and Hock [126].
Hock [126] gave four reasons why temperature-index models have been popular in
practice. They are summarized as follows: (1) wide availability of air temperature data,
42
J.D. Salas et al.

(2) simple interpolation and forecasting possibilities of air temperature, (3) generally good
performance, and (4) ease of use. The temperature-index models can be used at different time
scales such as daily, weekly, and monthly. The temperature data are easily available either
from measurements or indirectly from reanalysis. Its wide application includes the prediction
of ice melting/snowmelting for ﬂow forecasts operations, modeling of glacier mass balance,
and the evaluation of the snow and ice response applied to climate change predictions (e.g.,
[129, 130]).
The classical model for the ice melt and snowmelt for a given day may be expressed as
Mt ¼ DDF  Tt,
Tt > 0
¼ 0
,
Tt  0,
ð1:51Þ
where Mt ¼ ice melt or snowmelt during a given day (mm/day), Tt ¼ mean daily temperature
(C), and DDF ¼ degree-day factor (mm/(day  K)). Naturally in order to calculate the
total melt M during a given number of days n (e.g., n ¼ 30 days), one will have to integrate
the daily values so that M ¼ ∑n
1Mt.
The values of DDF may be determined by direct comparison using snow lysimeters or
ablation stakes or from the melting estimated by the energy balance method (e.g., [131–133]).
Field work investigations have shown that the term DDF exhibits signiﬁcant temporal and
spatial variability and it generally varies depending on the season, location, orientation of
mountain slopes, humidity, wind, and other environmental factors. Hock [126] provides a
table of average values of DDF for snow and ice (Table 1.6 above is a brief summary).
Table 1.6 shows that the values of DDF for snow are lower than those for ice, which is mainly
because of the higher albedo of snow compared to the albedo for ice.

5.2.2. Energy Balance Method
The energy balance is a physically based method where all sources of energy of the
underlying system (e.g., 1 m2 on the surface of a glacier) are considered and the excess of
energy is assumed to be used for ice melt/snowmelt. It is mostly used for estimating melt for
short time steps (e.g., daily or hourly) although it can be used for longer periods. The energy
balance method analyzes the exchange of energy produced between the surface of the glacier
and the air.
The energy balance equation may be written as [127]
QN þ QH þ QL þ QG þ QR þ QM ¼ 0,
ð1:52Þ
where QN is the net radiation ﬂux, QH is the sensible heat ﬂux, QL is the latent heat ﬂux, QG is
the ground heat ﬂux, QR is the heat ﬂux brought by rainfall, and QM is the energy consumed by
the ice melt/snowmelt (the units of all energy ﬂuxes may be W/m2). Then the ice melt/
snowmelt rates may be determined by
M ¼ QM
ρwLf
,
ð1:53Þ
where ρw is the density of water and Lf is the latent heat of fusion. Therefore, the energy
balance method for estimating the melt rate M requires measuring all the heat ﬂuxes involved
in (1.52), i.e., QN, QH, QL, QG, and QR. However, this task is generally costly since it requires
many especial equipment and instruments. Thus, alternative methods have been developed for
estimating the various terms involved based on standard meteorological observations [127].
Energy balance models may be applied at a site (location of the equipment) or for an area
(e.g., a square grid). Examples of energy balance studies at a site can be found in Table 2 of
Hock [127]. For instance, Hay and Fitzharris [134] for the Ivory Glacier (1,500 m) in New
Zealand gave the following estimates: QN ¼ 76, QH ¼ 44, QL ¼ 23, and QR ¼ 4 (W/m2),
which correspond to 52 %, 30 %, 16 %, and 2 %, respectively, of the total energy ﬂux
available for melt, i.e., QM ¼ 147 W/m2 (these estimates were made for a period of 53 days
during the summer). As expected, the relative contributions of the various components of the
energy balance equation vary with the weather conditions so that they change during the melt
season. Also the direct comparisons of the various estimates reported by different studies are
restricted by the different uncertainties arising from the instruments and methods utilized. In
addition, energy balance studies at spatial distributed scales are lacking; thus, a challenge for
distributed studies is the extrapolation of input data and energy balance components for the
entire grid [127].
5.2.3. Remarks
The temperature-index-based methods are much simpler to use than the energy balance
methods. For this reason, the former methods have found wide acceptance in practice for a
variety of problems such as ﬂow forecasting (e.g., [135]) and assessment of basin response to
potential climate change [136]. For basin studies requiring melt estimations at the monthly,
44
J.D. Salas et al.

weekly, and daily time scales, simple temperature-index-based methods may be sufﬁcient, but
for smaller temporal scale (e.g., hourly) and spatial scale (e.g., small basins), more reﬁned
energy-based methods may be desirable.
In addition, over the years, there have been a number of studies oriented to improving
the temperature-index-based methods by incorporating a radiation term in the equations
(e.g., [131, 137, 138]) and adding other variables such as wind speed and vapor pressure
(e.g., [139]). Likewise, the temperature-index-based and energy balance-based methods
have been applied for the same basin but for different time periods, i.e., the temperature-
index-based method for the dry periods and a simpliﬁed energy balance method during wet
periods [140]. Also, software such as SRM has been developed and applied for a wide range
of studies for estimating snowmelt and glacier melt worldwide [141].
Furthermore, in some cases, estimations of glacier melt contributions to streamﬂows have
been made using water balance equations for the basin where a glacier drains. For example,
this method has been applied [142] to estimate that a signiﬁcant amount (at least one-third) of
annual streamﬂows of the Santa River in Peru arises from the melt of glaciers located at the
Cordillera Blanca (Andes Mountains). Also a simple energy balance model with remotely
sensed data of short-wave and long-wave radiations, DEM obtained from the Global Land
One-Kilometer Base Elevation (GLOBE) and glacier areas derived from the Global Land Ice
Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database have been utilized for estimating glacier
contribution to streamﬂows worldwide [143].
5.3. Glacier Equipment
The energy balance method brieﬂy summarized in Sect. 5.2.2 above requires specialized
equipment and instrumentation to measure and estimate the various variables involved. The
equipment installed at a selected site includes a number of sensors to measure the incident and
diffuse solar radiation, both short- and long-wave radiation, air temperature at the glacier area,
humidity, and speed and direction of the wind. In the case of applying the “temperature-
index” methods, the equipment is simpler where the most important sensor is for air
temperature at the glacial area. In both cases, it is important measuring precipitation data
(at least of liquid precipitation) at the glacial area. Figure 1.15 shows a station located in the
tropical Andes Mountains at 5,180 m.a.s.l in Peru. This station has sensors for radiation, speed
and direction of the wind, temperature, pressure, humidity, an echo sounding (to measure
variations of snow height), and a gyroscope system that keeps the radiation sensors in a
vertical position on the ice surface.
6. WATERSHED AND RIVER BASIN MODELING
We have seen in previous sections a number of fundamental processes related to the
hydrologic cycle, such as precipitation, interception, depression storage, inﬁltration, evapo-
ration, soil moisture, and glacier melt/snowmelt. The main purpose of this section is to bring
together many of the underlying concepts and mathematical formulations of the referred

processes for ﬁnding the relationships of precipitation and streamﬂow at various time scales,
such as hours, days, weeks, seasons, and years. We will refer here to some of the foregoing
concepts, mathematical formulations, and models to describe and interrelate the underlying
physical processes so that one can estimate, for example, what fraction of the precipitation
that falls on the basin is transformed into streamﬂow at the outlet of the basin. We will start by
reviewing some needed concepts and then proceed with discussing some key features of such
as concepts and deﬁnitions, types of models, temporal and spatial scales, model building and
formulation, model calibration, and a brief example.
Hydrologic modeling of watersheds and river basins has a long history since the simple
rational method for relating precipitation and runoff was established in the nineteenth century
[144]. Thus, in about 160 years, a number of scientiﬁc and technological developments have
occurred, which has led to a variety of models with various degrees of sophistication.
Nowadays watershed models are increasingly adopted in the decision-making process to
address a wide range of water resources and environmental issues. Models can represent
the dynamic relationship between natural and human systems (Fig. 1.16) and have been
applied to describe not only the transport of water and sediment but sources, fate, and
transport of contaminants in watersheds and river basins. They can also help evaluate the
response of ﬂuxes of water, sediment, chemicals, and contaminants to the changing climate
and land use. Efﬁcient management of water and environmental systems requires integration
of hydrologic, physical, geological, and biogeochemical processes. This has led to the

development of complex models that can simulate an increasing number of state and output
variables at various locations within the watershed and river basin. On the other hand, data
availability and identiﬁability among other pragmatic considerations suggest adopting simple
model structures that can solve the problem at hand. The development and application of
watershed models must take into account the tradeoff between available data, model com-
plexity, performance, and identiﬁability of the model structure.
Over the years, a number of articles and books have been published on models for
representing the hydrologic cycle of watersheds and river basins. For instance, detailed
examples of a variety of models can be found in the books by Singh [145], Beven [146],
Bowles [147], and Singh and Frevert [148, 149], and journal articles have been published
describing critical issues involved in the modeling process such as parameter estimation,
uncertainty, sensitivity analysis, performance, scaling, and applications and experiences
thereof (e.g., [150–155]). Also literature abounds on classiﬁcation and types of models such
as deterministic or stochastic, conceptual or physically based (mechanistic), lumped or
distributed, event or continuous, and some other types such as black box and parametric
(e.g., [52, 60, 156–158], and other papers cited above).
6.1. Basic Concepts and Deﬁnitions
A model is a representation of a real system such as a watershed and a river basin. The
model structure is developed on the basis of our understanding of the physical principles/rules
that govern the system. A general distributed-parameter form of a model that can represent
spatial heterogeneities inherent in the real system, as well as nonlinear interactions between
system processes, can be expressed as [159]

where f is a functional representation of the internal system processes; x, u, and θ are vectors
of state variables, system inputs, and model parameters, respectively; t represents time; and
r is a three-dimensional vector specifying spatial locations. State variables (x) are quantities of
mass stored within the system boundary (B). Model inputs (u) and outputs (y) are ﬂuxes of
mass and energy into and out of the systems, respectively. Figure 1.17 illustrates a schematic
of model components from a system perspective [160]. In the context of watershed modeling,
examples of state variables may include mass of water, sediment, chemicals, organisms stored
within surface and subsurface system compartments, vegetation biomass on the ground
surface, and energy ﬂuxes. Precipitation ﬂux is a typical example of model input (u) (although
depending on the model input, variables may also include wind speed, air temperature,
humidity, and radiation as needed). Fluxes of ﬂow, sediment, and chemicals along the river
network are examples of model outputs. Model parameters (θ) are assumed to be time
invariant, but they may vary in space depending on the model; they are estimated by
appropriate methods for solving the partial differential equation of (1.54).
A simpler lumped-parameter model in the form of an ordinary differential equation can be
derived from (1.54) to describe changes in state variables as a function of time as

and model outputs are generated as

The vector functional relationships f and g constitute the model structure M and are
typically treated as deterministic components. In reality, however, a model is only a mere
approximation of the hydrologic system under study. Many important processes may be
unknown during the development of the model, while some other processes may be consid-
ered to be insigniﬁcant and may be ignored. Thus, the structure of any watershed model will
be generally incomplete and will contain uncertainty. Mathematical models are never perfect
because of the errors in model conceptualization, input and output observations, physical
characteristics of the system, temporal and spatial scales, and parameter estimation. In this
scenario, model parameters may be understood as being effective parameters that compensate
for these errors [161–163].
Depending on the physical basis of the model structure components f and g, watershed
models may be classiﬁed into two main categories: physically based models and empirical
models. Physically based models employ physical principles, i.e., conservation of mass,
energy, and momentum, to describe the nonlinear system dynamics that control the movement

of water, particles, chemicals, and organisms within various system compartments. Empirical
models describe the relationships between system inputs and outputs based on statistical
analysis of historical observations. Application of empirical models is limited to the condi-
tions over which the observations were acquired. Most watershed models, however, contain
both physically based equations and empirical relationships to represent the underlying
processes of the watershed and may be referred to as process-based models.
Often, physically based models are divided into conceptual models and pure physically
based models, where the latter ones presumably involve the proper equations for each process
according to the current state of the knowledge. Freeze and Harlam [164] established the
blueprint of this type of hydrologic models, proposing for the ﬁrst time a representation of the
underlying processes using the physical equations at the local scale. In principle, “pure”
physically based models do not need calibration, and parameters can be estimated directly
from the available information. However, the proper physical equations to be applied depend
on the spatial scale. For example, consider the modeling of an aquifer (Fig. 1.18): generally
applying the Darcy law at the local scale, one should use Boussinesq’s equations for solving
the groundwater ﬂow problem, but at pore scales, they must be substituted by the
Navier–Stokes equations. Furthermore, at the aquifer scale, linear reservoir and water balance
equations may give a good representation of the system.
Regardless of the degree of empiricism embedded in the model structure, the system of
functional relationships can be resolved on various spatial and temporal scales. These
equations may be solved for the entire watershed as a single unit where a unique set of
state variables are deﬁned and a single set of model parameters are estimated for the entire
system. Models that use this approach are referred to as lumped-parameter models. On the
other hand, the watershed may be divided into smaller rather homogeneous subunits or areas
(e.g., grids, sub-watersheds, hydrologic response units) in order to better represent the
heterogeneities of watershed characteristics such as soils, land use, land cover, and terrain
as well as the spatial variability of the inputs such as precipitation and potential evapotrans-
piration. Thus, these models are referred to as distributed-parameter models, where the state
variables and model parameters are different for each subunit. Then, as the number of subunits
increases, the computational burden for solving the system equations may substantially
increase.

In addition to the spatial scale, selection of appropriate temporal scales is an important
consideration for building the models and solving the system equations. Event-based models
are needed for analyzing the effect of design storms on the hydrologic system and usually
require small time steps such as hours or even smaller, depending on the size of the catchment.
Larger time steps (e.g., daily or even longer in some cases) may be sufﬁcient for continuous
models that are appropriate for long-term assessment of changes in the hydrologic system in
response to the changes in climate, land use, and management drivers. Even in the case of
distributed-parameter models with relatively small subunits for model computations, model
parameters are aggregate measures of spatially and temporally heterogeneous properties of
each unit. Thus, model parameters will always contain uncertainties that propagate forward
into model predictions of state and output variables. Even “pure” physically based models
involve effective parameters that must be also calibrated [165, 166].
6.2. Brief Example
For illustrative purposes, we describe some basic aspects of hydrologic modeling using a
relatively simple distributed model known as TETIS model and its application to the Goodwin
Creek basin for ﬂood event simulation.
6.2.1. The Basin
Goodwin Creek is a 21.3 km2 experimental basin located in Panola County (Mississippi,
USA). The watershed is fully instrumented with 14 ﬂow gauges and 32 rain gauges, in order to
continuously monitor precipitation, runoff, and sediment yield with a high spatial and
temporal resolution [167]. The original hydrometeorological data has been sampled for this
work at 5 min temporal resolution. Soils are mainly silt loams, and the topography is quite
smooth, with elevation ranging from 67 to 121 m.a.s.l. and slope from 0 to 22 % (for a 30-m
scale resolution). Major land uses are pasture, agriculture, and forest. The climate is humid,
warm in the summer and temperate in the winter. The average annual precipitation is
1,440 mm, and convective rainfall events are common, especially in the summer. The
watershed surface hydrology is largely Hortonian, with runoff almost entirely formed by
overland ﬂow and a little baseﬂow at the outlet (less than 0.05 m3/s). The main storm events of
years 1981, 1982, and 1983, with peak ﬂows at the outlet of 39.8, 37.8, and 106.3 m3/s,
respectively, will be used in this example.
6.2.2. The Distributed Model
The TETIS model is a distributed hydrologic model, with physically based formulations
and parameters, developed for continuous and event simulation of the hydrologic cycle at
basin scale. The model has been satisfactorily tested in different climatic scenarios with a
wide range of basin sizes, from a few hectares up to 60,000 km2 [163, 168–172].
Version 8 of TETIS (free download at http://lluvia.dihma.upv.es) represents the water
cycle in each cell of the spatial grid using up to six interconnected vertical tanks. The example
here (with no snow and no explicit representation of the vegetation interception) considers
50
J.D. Salas et al.

only four tanks as shown in Fig. 1.19. The relationships between tanks, representing the
different hydrologic processes, are described by linear reservoirs and ﬂow threshold schemes.
The ﬁrst tank (T1) represents the aggregation of vegetation interception, surface puddles, and
upper soil capillary retention; water can leave this tank only by evapotranspiration and, for
this reason, is called static tank (storage). The second tank (T2) corresponds to the surface
storage, i.e., the water that does not inﬁltrate and generates overland ﬂow. The third tank
(T3) represents the gravitational soil storage; the percolation process is modeled according to
both soil saturation conditions and vertical hydraulic conductivity, and the remaining water is
available for interﬂow. The fourth tank (T4) represents the aquifer, which generates the
baseﬂow and the groundwater outﬂow (underground losses in reference to the catchment
outlet). The groundwater outﬂows are the aquifer ﬂows that do not contribute to baseﬂow
within the basin (generally they contribute to baseﬂows downstream or to the sea). Eight
parameters are needed for the runoff production: static storage capacity, vegetation density,
soil surface inﬁltration capacity, horizontal saturated permeability and percolation capacity,
aquifer permeability, underground loses capacity, and overland ﬂow velocity.
Basin stream network can be considered as an additional ﬁfth tank, but it is not necessarily
included in all cells. Two different types of channel networks can be deﬁned: gullies (without

permanent ﬂow) and rivers (with permanent ﬂow). The starting cells of these networks are
deﬁned by two drainage area thresholds. Every cell receives inﬂows from upstream and drains
downstream following a 3D scheme generated from a digital elevation model (DEM), and the
ﬂow is routed towards the lowest of the eight contiguous cells. Figure 1.20 shows a 2D
simpliﬁcation of this scheme. The overland ﬂow and the interﬂow are routed to the respective
tanks (T2 and T3) of the downstream cell (Fig. 1.20); once both ﬂows reach a cell whose
drainage area is greater than the threshold drainage area corresponding to gullies, they move
into T5. In the same way, baseﬂow is routed to T4 of the downstream cell until it reaches a
second threshold drainage area (for river channels), and then it moves into T5. Therefore, this
couple of threshold drainage areas divides the watershed into three classes of cells: pure
hillslope cells (without the T5 tank), gully cells (with T5 tank and no connection between
aquifer and gully), and river cells (with the T5 tank and connection between aquifer and
channel). The ﬂow routing along the stream channel network is carried out using the
geomorphologic kinematic wave (GKW) methodology, where cross-section and roughness
characteristics of the stream channel network are estimated with power laws of drainage area
and slope for each cell [163].
The model effective parameters are organized following a split structure [163, 173].
Basically, each effective parameter i for cell j, (θij*), is the multiplication of a correction
factor Ri that depends only on the type of the parameter and the prior parameter estimation θij,
i.e., correction factors modify globally each parameter map, assuming the prior spatial
structure and thus reducing drastically the number of parameters to be calibrated. In the
referred TETIS conﬁguration, there are a total of nine correction factors: eight affecting the
runoff production parameter maps and one for the stream network velocity. Also, the split

6.2.3. Initial Parameter Estimation
Concerning the initial parameter estimation in the model calibration, the best advice is
to use all available information and experience. In this example, the basic information
used to estimate the model parameters was taken from Blackmarr [167]. This initial

parameter estimation is the prior parameter set in calibrating the effective parameters of
TETIS model.
The DEM for the basin included 30  30-m square cells which were used to derive ﬂow
direction, slope, and ﬂow accumulation maps (Fig. 1.21). The last one is needed for stream
channel routing with TETIS, because hydraulic characteristics in the GKW are extrapolated
using mainly the drainage area of each cell [163]. Drainage threshold areas were estimated as

0.01 km2 (to differentiate between hillslopes and gullies) and 15.3 km2 (for differentiating
between gullies and river channels). The parameters of the GKW power laws have been taken
from Molna´r and Ramı´rez [174]. The overland ﬂow velocity map was estimated from the
slope map, assuming a representative uniform ﬂow and a rough estimation of the roughness
coefﬁcient. Vegetation density was obtained from a simple reclassiﬁcation of the land cover
map. The static storage capacity and inﬁltration capacity were estimated using soil informa-
tion (texture, soil classiﬁcation, and soil proﬁles), the land cover map for effective root depth,
and proper pedotransfer functions. Percolation capacity was derived from a geological map of
the study area. These three important parameter maps are shown in Fig. 1.22. The estimated
values are in fact modal values for the union of the three original cartographic units

respectively) (color ﬁgure online).

(vegetation, soil, and lithology). No speciﬁc estimation was done for horizontal saturated soil
permeability, aquifer permeability, and underground loses capacity: for example, the inﬁltra-
tion capacity map was used also for the horizontal saturated soil permeability assuming a high
correlation between them.
6.3. Model Calibration and Testing
Application of simulation models in research or water management decision making
requires establishing credibility, i.e., “a sufﬁcient degree of belief in the validity of the
model” [175]. Beck et al. [176] describe attributes of a valid model as follows: (1) soundness
of mathematical representation of processes, (2) sufﬁcient correspondence between model
outputs and observations, and (3) fulﬁllment of the designated task. Literature review is
commonly practiced to deal with the ﬁrst attribute, which often includes model calibration.
Model calibration is the process of adjusting the model parameters (θ) manually or automat-
ically for the system of interest until model outputs adequately match the observed data. The
credibility of model simulations is further evaluated by investigating whether model pre-
dictions are satisfactory on different data sets, a procedure often referred to as validation,
veriﬁcation, or testing [177, 178].
One common calibration and testing strategy is to split observed data into two data sets:
one data set for calibration and another one for testing. It is desirable that the calibration and
testing data sets contain observed data of approximately the same lengths (although often this
requirement is not met where data sets are small). It is also important that both calibration and
testing data sets contain periods with high and low ﬂows in order to increase the robustness of
the model. Yapo et al. [179] demonstrated that approximately eight years of daily data were
needed to appropriately adjust model parameters for calibration of a rainfall-runoff model for
their watershed. Gan et al. [180] indicated that ideally, calibration of rainfall-runoff models
should use 3–5 years of daily data that include average, wet, and dry years so that the data
encompass a sufﬁcient range of hydrologic events to activate all the model components during
calibration. However, the required amount of calibration data is project speciﬁc. For example,
in the case study referred to in Sect. 6.2, only one single ﬂood event at the outlet of the basin
was used for model calibration.
The classical calibration procedure aims at identifying a unique “best parameter set,” (θ^),
that provides the closest match between model predictions and real-world observations of
system outputs (y). Several measures of information have been proposed for calibration of
hydrologic models (Gupta et al. [181]), including Nash-Sutcliffe efﬁciency coefﬁcient (E),
root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), maximum absolute deviation
(MAD), bias (BIAS), and lag-1 autocorrelation (r1). Some studies have identiﬁed ranges for
these measures that can be used to classify model simulations as poor, acceptable, good, and
very good (e.g., [182, 183]). But other factors must be also taken into consideration such as
the time step (i.e., more relaxed for smaller discretization), streamﬂow errors (especially
when outputs are sediment and water quality), and input and prior parameter information
uncertainties.

Per illustration, considering our example, the TETIS model includes an automatic calibra-
tion module based on the SCE-UA algorithm [184, 185], which was used to calibrate all the
correction factors (9) and the initial values of the state variables (4). The model calibration
results using the RMSE as objective function for a ﬂood event in October 1981 measured at
the outlet of the basin (station Q01) are shown in Fig. 1.23 (left). It is worth noting that the
referred basin shows a typical Hortonian behavior and the referred ﬂood event occurred with a
very dry initial condition. The resulting Nash-Sutcliffe efﬁciency coefﬁcient was E ¼ 0.98,
which can be considered a very good performance [183]. As stated above, the calibrated
model must be capable of reproducing properly the dominant process in the basin for events
other than those used for calibration (temporal validation) and events occurring at other sites
in the basin (spatial validation) or better both (temporal and spatial validation) for a more
robust model testing. For example, Fig. 1.23 (right) shows the ﬂood output estimated for an
upstream site corresponding to a storm event occurred in September 1983 for which the
efﬁciency coefﬁcient is E ¼ 0.87. As expected the value of E for validation is smaller than
that for calibration (0.98), but a decrease smaller than 0.2 is generally judged to be acceptable.
The literature abounds with optimization procedures for automatic calibration of hydro-
logic and water quality models by means of minimizing appropriate objective functions that
reﬂect the modeling error magnitude. While several studies have demonstrated the impor-
tance of choosing a formal and statistically correct objective function for proper calibration of
hydrologic models (e.g., [186–188]), others have argued that there may not exist such
measures (e.g., [151, 181, 189]). A major limitation of the classical calibration procedure is
that it may not be possible to identify a unique set of model parameters that simultaneously
minimize all objective functions corresponding to all model outputs. Thus, the use of multi-
objective optimization algorithms has gained wide acceptance in the past years (e.g.,
[190–193]). Multi-objective approaches are particularly suitable for multisite multivariable
calibration of watershed models, where minimization of all errors associated with estimated
ﬂuxes of water, sediments, and chemicals at multiple outlets within the watershed is desired.

6.4. Sensitivity Analysis
A model sensitivity analysis can be helpful in understanding which model inputs and
initial conditions are most important or inﬂuential for understanding potential limitations of
the model. Additional care must be taken when estimating model parameters that are the
most inﬂuential. Data collection efforts that support the modeling study may focus on
obtaining better data for these parameters. In order to eliminate the effect of an inﬂuential
initial condition, one can do three things: to simulate a sufﬁciently long “warming” period
(usually months for aquifer initial conditions, weeks for soil moisture, and days and hours
for river channel discharges, depending on the size and the particular watershed at hand),
use as initial state the state in a similar time within the simulated period, or calibrate the
initial condition.
The sensitivity analysis can also identify potential limitations of the model. If a model is
not sensitive to parameters that are to be varied in testing the project objectives or
hypotheses, a different model may need to be selected. Or alternatively, improve the
mathematical model by removing the non-inﬂuential parameters and the corresponding
processes. As stated above, models are abstractions of the systems they simulate and
therefore typically represent system components with varying levels of detail. For example,
the scientiﬁc literature may indicate that differences in tillage practices inﬂuence pesticide
losses in surface runoff. In such a case, the use of a model that is not sensitive to tillage to
examine the impact of switching from conventional tillage to conservation tillage on
pesticide losses in surface runoff would be inappropriate. Sensitivity analysis can be done
by local sensitivity analysis (i.e., without interactions between the analyzed inputs, param-
eters, and initial conditions) or better by a general sensitivity analysis (GSA) using Monte
Carlo simulations (see, e.g., [194]). Generally, it is worth selecting only the behavioral
simulations [146, 151, 195, 196].
The literature and model documentation are often excellent sources of information on
model sensitivity. For example, Muttiah and Wurbs [197] identiﬁed the sensitivity of SWAT
(Soil and Water Assessment Tool) to various parameters. However, it may be necessary to
conduct a sensitivity analysis for the study watershed if its conditions are signiﬁcantly
different than those for model sensitivity analyses reported in the literature, since model
sensitivity may be speciﬁc to the model setup. Thus, limited data for parameterizing the model
may need to be collected prior to conducting a sensitivity analysis. Generally, the sensitivity
analysis should be completed using an un-calibrated model setup, since the inﬂuential
parameters and those with the greatest uncertainty are typically used for model calibration.
For example, Spruill et al. [198] conducted a SWAT sensitivity analysis to evaluate param-
eters that were thought to inﬂuence stream discharge predictions. During calibration, the
average absolute deviation between observed and simulated streamﬂows was minimized and
used to identify optimum values or ranges for each parameter. In our case study (Sect. 6.2), a
GSA was made, and the most inﬂuential correction factors were detected using as behavioral
threshold the Nash-Sutcliffe efﬁciency coefﬁcient of 0.75. Figure 1.24 shows two extreme
cases: the correction factors of the static tank (storage) capacity and overland ﬂow velocity.
The static tank, which is the sink (during a ﬂood event) of the inﬁltration when soil moisture is

below ﬁeld capacity, is a very inﬂuential component; on the other hand, the discharge at the
basin outlet is not sensitive to the propagation of the overland ﬂow within the hillslopes, i.e.,
maximum attention must be made to the estimation of the static tank storage capacity,
whereas a rough estimation may be enough for the hillslope velocities.
6.5. Uncertainty Analysis
Any modeling process will necessarily entail a number of uncertainties arising from data,
model abstractions, and natural heterogeneity of the watersheds. To this, we can add the
uncertainty related to the decision-making process. The National Research Council report
“Assessing the TMDL approach to water quality management” emphasizes that modeling

uncertainty should be rigorously and explicitly addressed in development and application of
models for environmental management, especially when stakeholders are affected by the
decisions contingent upon model-supported analyses [199].
Uncertainties from the various model components illustrated in Fig. 1.17 can propagate
forward into model predictions for state and output variables. There are three primary types of
uncertainties in watershed modeling: parameter uncertainty, structural uncertainty, and data
uncertainty (e.g., [188, 200]). Parameter uncertainty arises from errors in estimating model
parameters (θ). Structural uncertainties result from incomplete representation of the real
system by the functional relationships f and g, or numerical schemes that are employed to
solve the system equations [(1.55) and (1.56)]. Data uncertainties are associated with errors in
the system inputs (u) and outputs (y) and may consist of random and systematic errors (e.g.,
instrumentation and human) and errors arising from the discrepancy between the scale of
modeling outputs and observations.
Uncertainties associated with watershed modeling can be addressed using three types of
methods: (1) behavioral, (2) analytic, and (3) sampling-based methods. Behavioral methods
are based on human judgment and experience and are carried out by asking experts in the
problem area to provide their best assessment of the probability of a particular outcome. This
method should be the last resort for addressing the problem of model uncertainty and should
only be used in the absence of statistical methods [201]. Unlike behavioral methods, analyt-
ical methods that are based on the method of moments provide a quantitative estimate of
model uncertainty [202]. The output function of the model is expanded by series expansions
(such as Taylor series), and ﬁrst-order, quadratic, or higher-order terms of the series are
selected for computation of the moments. For example, the ﬁrst-order variance propagation
method is based on the ﬁrst-order approximation of the Taylor series, and the ﬁrst two
moments are used to compute the variance of the model output. First-order reliability method
(FORM) and ﬁrst-order second moment (FOSM) are among the popular analytical methods
for determining model uncertainties (e.g., [203]). The prerequisite of analytical methods is
that the solution of the differential equation f (1.55) must be obtained analytically. In the
context of watershed modeling, this prerequisite is a formidable barrier for the wider use of
analytical methods because analytical solutions to highly nonlinear system of equations are
rarely available.
Sampling-based uncertainty analysis methods are commonly used in watershed model-
ing, where instead of analytical solutions a probability distribution function for the model
output is generated from multiple realizations of the parameter space (e.g., [203]). Sample
statistics are used to compute ﬁrst and second moments. Also, the relative importance of
model parameters with regard to variations of the model output can be determined. The
most common sampling technique for deriving distributions for model outputs is Monte
Carlo simulations [204], which has also been the basis for more sophisticated sampling
methods. In particular, various Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been
developed to deal with input, parameter, and model structural uncertainties in hydrologic
prediction (e.g., [188, 200, 205, 206]).

In addition, from a decision maker point of view, it is necessary to integrate all sources of
uncertainty in the context of model predictive uncertainty (PU). PU is the probability of any
actual value (observed or not) conditioned to all available information and knowledge
[207]. Figure 1.25 illustrates this important concept and shows the relationship between
observations (real output) and simulations for the implemented model (i.e., ﬁxed model and
parameters), and PU is the conditional probability given the simulated output. From the model
users’ perspective, what we want is to understand the position of the reality (real output) given
the simulations. Furthermore, additional PU algorithms have been developed such as the
hydrologic uncertainty processor [207], the Bayesian model averaging [208, 209], the model
conditional processor, MCP [210], and the quantile regression [211]. Moreover, all these
techniques can be used for uncertainty reduction by combining more than one model.
We have applied the MCP for obtaining the PU of the simulations in our case study based
on the TETIS model. MCP is a Bayesian method based on the estimation of the joint
distribution function of observations and simulations. To estimate the PU statistical model
parameters, a calibration period covering the maximum range of possible outcomes is needed,
to reduce the extrapolation of the estimated distributions and correlation functions. Figure 1.26
shows the estimated 90 % band (i.e., the 5 and 95 % quantiles) obtained with the referred
method for the simulations of two storm events that occurred in May 1983 (larger and a
smaller storm events compared to that used for calibration). In this case, it is clear that the no
ﬂow is predicted with high reliability, ﬂow peaks are predicted with acceptable reliability, and
the larger PU is located around the 50 m3/s discharge.

7. RISK AND UNCERTAINTY ANALYSES IN HYDROLOGY
Statistical concepts and methods are routinely utilized for approaching a number of
problems in hydrology and water resources. This is because most, if not all, hydrologic
processes have some degree of randomness and uncertainty. For example, annual precipita-
tion over a basin is a random occurrence that is generally described by probability laws.
Another example is the random occurrence of annual maximum ﬂoods at a given cross section
of a stream. Thus, concepts of risk and uncertainty are commonly utilized for planning and
management of hydraulic structures such as spillways and dikes. This section starts with an
elementary and brief review of some basic concepts of probability and statistics. Then
frequency analysis of hydrologic variables is presented by using nonparametric and paramet-
ric methods and models. The concepts of risk, vulnerability, uncertainty, and regional analysis
are discussed primarily in connection with ﬂood-related structures. In addition, the concepts
and applications of stochastic techniques, particularly streamﬂow simulation and forecasting,
are discussed. The section ends with a summary of what has been done with the issue of
nonstationarity.
7.1. Introduction
Many of the problems that we face in planning and management of water resources and
environmental systems involve some degree of uncertainty. For example, the occurrences of
multiyear droughts or the occurrences of yearly maximum ﬂoods are random events that must
be approached using probability theory, statistics, and stochastic methods. Often in charac-
terizing random events, the concept of random variables is utilized. For example, if X is a
random variable, it means that it is governed by a certain probability law (we will also call it a
model) which can be represented by a probability density function (PDF) f Xðx;θÞ or a

g is the parameter set
(population parameters) and where m is the number of parameters of the model. For brevity
we will also use the notation fX(x) and FX(x), but it will be understood that they include the
parameter setθ. It can be shown that the population moments of the random variable X, say the
expected value E(X) ¼ μX or the variance Var(X) ¼ σ2
X, are functions of the parameter set θ
and they are constant values (they are not random variables).
It is also convenient to remember the concept of a random sample. A random sample could
be represented by X1, . . ., XN where all the Xs have the same distribution fX(x) (i.e., the same
population mean μ and variance σ2). Sample moments are functions of the random sample, for
example, the sample mean ^μ X ¼ X ¼ 1=N

2 are the ﬁrst and the second sample moments. Since they are
functions of the random sample, they are also random variables, and as such they also have
moments. For instance, it may be shown that the expected values of ^μ X and ^σ 2
X are μ and σ2,
respectively. Likewise, the variance of ^μ X is equal to σ2/N. In addition, we could also refer to a
random sample as the set x1, . . ., xN where xi represents a particular value of the random
variable X. And we could also deﬁne the sample moments as above using the same equations
(e.g., ^μ x ¼ x ¼ 1=N
ð
Þ
XN
1 xi), but the big difference is that x is not a random variable but a
given quantity that depends on the values x1, . . ., xN (while X is a random variable as noted
above).
Furthermore, assuming that we have a random sample X1, . . ., XN from a known model
f X x, θ


but unknown parameter set θ, one can estimate θ by using various estimation methods
such as the method of moments, probability-weighted moments, and maximum likelihood
(e.g., [213]). Regardless of the estimation method, the estimator say ^θ will be a function of the
random sample say ^θ ¼ g1 X1; . . . ; XN
ð
Þ. And the qth-quantile estimator ^X q will be a function
of the parameter set, i.e., ^X q ¼ g2 ^θ1; . . . ; ^θm


. Then ^θ and consequently ^X q are random
variables. Therefore, often in applying these concepts for problems such as ﬂood frequency
analysis, one would like to estimate the conﬁdence limits of the population quantiles.
We can address some problems in engineering hydrology where probability laws and
models can be directly applied for making risk-based design decisions. That is the case, for
example, when we use probabilistic models for ﬁtting the frequency distribution of annual
ﬂoods and estimating the design ﬂood to be used for designing the capacity of a spillway. We
are able to do that because we assume that the sequence of annual ﬂoods is a random sample
X1, . . ., XN, i.e., there is no correlation among the Xs or they are uncorrelated. However,
many data that we use in hydrology and water resources are autocorrelated, i.e., temporally
dependent, and in such case, a direct application of a probability law f X x, θ


may not be
enough. For example, monthly and annual streamﬂow data (mean ﬂow or total volume) or
daily precipitation data are generally autocorrelated. In these cases, additional concepts and
different types of models are needed in order to represent the temporal and spatial variability
of the data. Such models incorporate one or more terms linking the underlying variable with
62
J.D. Salas et al.

its past plus a random term, as is the case of single site or univariate models, and also linking it
with other variables at other sites as is the case of multisite or multivariate models. These
models fall in the category of stochastic models or time series models.
7.2. Frequency Analysis of Hydrologic Data
7.2.1. Empirical Frequency Analysis
Hydrologic data can be analyzed by using nonparametric methods for determining the PDF
and CDF. Let us assume that we have a random sample denoted by x01, . . ., x0i, . . ., x0N where
N is the sample size. For instance, x0i, i ¼ 1, . . ., N may be a sequence of maximum annual
ﬂoods. The simplest procedure for estimating the empirical PDF is to arrange the data from
the smallest to the largest one, say x1, . . ., xi, . . ., xN such that x1 is the minimum and xN is the
maximum. Then the range of the data is subdivided into classes j ¼ 1, . . ., Nc with Nc ¼ the
number of classes. Next assume that the class width is Δx and the number of observations that
fall in class j is Nj. Then the relative frequency corresponding to class j is Nj/N. The plot of
Nj/N against the class mark (the midpoint of the class) is the typical histogram, and the
empirical PDF (estimate of the population PDF) is given by f( j) ¼ Nj/(NΔx). Additional
details regarding the criteria for selecting Nc and Δx can be found in standard books (e.g.,
[214–216]). In addition, Kernel density estimates (KDE) may be useful in cases where a
smooth density is needed across the range of the data set (rather than point estimates for
classes). For example, KDE has been useful for identifying bimodality in the frequency
distribution (e.g., [217]). Whether using f( j) or KDE, the empirical CDF F( j) can be found
by integration.
Also the empirical CDF may be determined based on the so-called plotting position
formulas as follows: (1) Arrange the data x01, . . ., x0i, . . ., x0N in either increasing or decreas-
ing order of magnitude (for simplicity we will assume throughout this section that the data are
arranged in increasing order of magnitude). As above denote the arranged sequence by
x1, . . ., xi, . . ., xN where x1 is the minimum and xN is the maximum. (2) Assign a probability
P(X  xi) to each value xi by using a plotting position formula. Several formulas have been
suggested for this purpose (Table 1.7 gives some examples). The most widely used formula in
practice is the Weibull plotting position formula, i.e., F(xi) ¼ P(X  xi) ¼ i/(N + 1). The
formula gives a non-exceedance probability or the probability that the random variable X is
less or equal to the value xi (value that corresponds to the order i in the arranged sample).
Then, the exceedance probability is P(xi) ¼ 1  F(xi) ¼ P(X > xi) ¼ 1  i/(N + 1).
In addition, the concept of return period or recurrence interval has been widely used for
many purposes in engineering practice. For events deﬁned in the upper probability scale
(generally events related to maximum quantities such as ﬂoods), the return period is equal
to one divided by the exceedance probability, i.e., the empirical estimate of the return period
is T(xi) ¼ 1/P(xi). On the other hand, in case that hydrologic events are deﬁned in the lower
probability scale (such as for minimum ﬂows), the return period is given by T(xi) ¼ 1/F(xi).
The empirical CDF is sometimes plotted on probability papers. A probability paper designed
for a given model has the probability scale distorted so that the CDF of the model plots as a
Introduction to Hydrology
63

straight line. The most popular and useful probability papers are the normal, lognormal, and
Gumbel probability papers. The example below further illustrates the method.
The empirical CDF for the maximum annual ﬂoods of the St. Mary’s River at Stillwater,
Canada, will be determined based on the ﬂood data available for the period 1916–1939 as
shown in the ﬁrst two columns of Table 1.8. The original data have been ordered from the
smallest (8,040) to the largest value (20,100) as shown in columns 4 and 5 of Table 1.8. Using
the Weibull plotting position formula, the non-exceedance and the exceedance probabilities
are calculated as shown in columns 6 and 7. And the return period is listed in column 8. The
empirical CDF is plotted in Fig. 1.27. Based on the empirical distribution, one can make
probability statements about the possible occurrences of certain ﬂood events. For example,
from Table 1.8 (columns 5 and 6), one can write P(X  17, 200) ¼ 80 % which is the
probability that annual ﬂoods at St. Mary’s River will be less or equal to 17,200. Conversely,
P(X > 17, 200) ¼ 20 % is the exceedance probability, and T (17,200) ¼ 5 years is the
corresponding return period. Obviously relevant probability information can be obtained
from the empirical CDF. However, such information is rather limited because many design
problems require estimating ﬂood quantiles for speciﬁed return periods or estimating the
return periods for given ﬂood magnitudes that are beyond the values that can be found from
the empirical frequency analysis such as that shown in Table 1.8. Section 7.3 below shows
how using probabilistic models can enhance the frequency analysis of hydrologic data.
7.2.2. Frequency Analysis Based on Probabilistic Models
Probability models such as the normal, lognormal, gamma (Pearson), log-gamma
(log-Pearson), and general extreme value (GEV) distributions have been widely used for
ﬁtting the distribution of hydrologic data. From experience the type of data may suggest
applying or discarding one or more candidate models that may be considered for the data at
hand. For example, extreme ﬂood or extreme precipitation data are generally skewed, and for
this reason, the normal distribution would not be a suitable distribution for such data.
Generally more than one distribution may ﬁt the empirical data reasonably well although,
often, signiﬁcant differences may result when extrapolating the ﬁtted distribution beyond the

range of the empirical data. While ﬁtting a particular model has become a simple task, the
difﬁculty lies in selecting the model to be used for making design or management decisions
[213]. However, in many countries and regions of the world, guidelines and manuals have
been developed, suggesting a particular distribution for a certain type of hydrologic data. For
example, Bulletin 17B [218] is a manual that suggests using the log-Pearson III distribution
for ﬂood frequency analysis in the United States of America.
In this section, we describe only four distributions, namely, the normal, lognormal,
log-Pearson III, and the Gumbel distribution (which is a particular case of the GEV distribu-
tion). The ﬁtting method, i.e., parameter estimation, will be illustrated using the method of

exist in literature, some of them more efﬁcient for certain distributions than the method of
moments. Likewise, statistical tests such as the Smirnov-Kolmogorov test are available that
help judging the goodness of ﬁt of a particular model. For additional information on
alternative probabilistic models, parameter estimation methods, testing techniques, and eval-
uating uncertainties, the reader is referred to well-known references (e.g., [213, 219]).

where μ and σ are the model parameters. The plot of the PDF f(x) vs. x is centered around μ
and has a bell shape symmetric form. Certain properties of the normal distribution are useful.
For instance, it may be shown that the population mean, variance, and skewness coefﬁcient of
the normal variable X are E(X) ¼ μ, Var(X) ¼ σ2, and γ(X) ¼ 0, respectively. The normal
random variable X can be standardized as

where Z is known as the standard normal and has mean 0 and variance 1. A typical problem
of practical interest is determining the value of the cumulative probability for a speciﬁed

Unfortunately one cannot integrate the normal density in close form so numerical integra-
tion or tables must be used to ﬁnd FX(x). Actually tables and numerical approximations are
available in reference to the standardized variable Z. Thus, the following relationship is useful
for practical applications of the normal distribution:
FX x
ð Þ ¼ FZ zð Þ ¼ Φ zð Þ,
ð1:59Þ
in which z ¼ (x  μ)/σ and Φ(z) denotes the CDF of the standard normal variable. In other
words, the CDF of X can be found from the CDF of Z. Tables relating Φ(z) versus z can be
found in any standard statistical book (e.g., [220]). Likewise, another problem of interest is,
given the value of the non-exceedance probability, i.e., given FX(xq) ¼ q, we would like to
ﬁnd the qth-quantile xq. It may be shown that xq can be obtained as a function of zq, the qth
quantile of the standard normal distribution as
xq ¼ μ þ σzq:

Also note that both the estimation of the CDF F(x) and the quantile xq can be made using
statistical software packages and Excel.

Lognormal Distribution
The lognormal distribution has been quite useful in the ﬁeld of hydrology because it is a
skewed distribution and is related to the normal distribution. Let us consider a lognormal
distributed random variable X with parameters x0, μY, and σY. It may be shown that if X is
lognormal distributed with parameters x0, μY, and σY, then Y ¼ log a(X  x0) (where x0 is a

For the same ﬂood data of Table 1.8 above, the normal and lognormal models are ﬁtted.
Table 1.8 gives the sample mean, standard deviation, and skewness coefﬁcient as
x ¼ 13, 172:9, sx ¼ 3, 569.3, and gx ¼ 0.271, respectively. Thus, from (1.61) and (1.62),
the parameters of the normal distribution are ^μ x ¼ x ¼ 13, 172:9and ^σ x ¼ sx ¼ 3, 569:3. The
PDF and CDF are obtained from (1.57) and (1.59) using the mathematical functions available
in Excel. Table 1.9 below shows a sample of the results obtained. In addition, Fig. 1.27 shows
the comparison of the ﬁtted normal and empirical CDFs, and Fig. 1.28 shows the ﬁtted normal
model PDF and CDF. Also a lognormal-2 model (i.e., with x0 ¼ 0) is ﬁtted. Table 1.8
(column 3) gives the base-10 logarithms of the data and the mean, standard deviation, and
skewness coefﬁcient of the logarithms as y ¼ 4:104, sy ¼ 0.121, and gy ¼  0.174, respec-
tively. Then, the lognormal-2 model parameters are estimated from (1.67a) and (1.68a); they
give ^μ Y ¼ y ¼ 4:104 and ^σ Y ¼ sy ¼ 0:121. The corresponding ﬁtted lognormal PDF is
obtained from (1.63a) in which k ¼ 0.4343 and x0 ¼ 0, and the ﬁtted CDF is obtained from
(1.64a) using the mathematical functions available in Excel. Table 1.9 shows the results
obtained for a range of x values varying from 0 to 26,000. Figure 1.27 compares the normal,
lognormal, and empirical CDFs. Because the skewness of the data is small, no major

differences are seen between the CDFs. Also, Fig. 1.28 compares the lognormal-2 model PDF
and CDF versus those of the normal model. One may observe that while the normal PDF is
symmetric, that of the lognormal model is slightly skewed to the right (because of the positive
skewness coefﬁcient).

Log-Pearson III Distribution
The log-Pearson type III distribution has been widely applied in hydrology, in particular for
ﬁtting the frequency distribution of extreme hydrologic data such as annual ﬂood data. The
US IACWD [218] recommended the use of the log-Pearson type III distribution as an attempt
to promote a uniform and consistent approach for ﬂood frequency studies. As a result, this
distribution has become quite popular in the United States.
The probability density function of the log-Pearson type III distribution may be written as
(e.g., [216, 221])
f X x
ð Þ ¼
k
αΓ β
ð Þx
loga x
ð Þ  y0
α

β1
exp  loga x
ð Þ  y0
α


,
ð1:69Þ
where α, β, and y0 are the parameters and Γ(β) denotes the complete gamma function. The
variable Y is a log-transform of X, i.e., Y ¼ log a(X), and it implies that if X is log-Pearson III
distributed with parameters α, β, and y0, then Y is gamma distributed with the same parameter
set. Thus, the parameters α and y0 are expressed in the log domain. Also β > 0 and α, and y0
may be either positive or negative. If α > 0, f(x) is positively skewed and varies in the range
exp a(y0)  x < 1. On the other hand, if α < 0, f(x) is either positively or negatively skewed
depending on the values of α and β, and f(x) varies in the range 1  x < exp a(y0). The
CDF and the quantile (for a given non-exceedance probability) cannot be represented
explicitly as is the case for the normal and lognormal models. Therefore, tables or numerical
approximations are necessary for their computations.
The following relationships are important for parameter estimation. It may be shown that if
X is log-Pearson III distributed with parameters α, β, and y0, the ﬁrst three population
moments of Y ¼ log a(X) are

Consider the random sample x1, . . ., xN where N ¼ sample size. For ﬁtting the log-Pearson
III distribution, the original data were log-transformed, i.e., y ¼ loga(x), and the new data set
in the log domain is denoted as y1, . . ., yN. Then, based on the moment (1.70)–(1.72), the
log-Pearson III parameters can be estimated as
^β ¼

^α ¼ sygy

ð1:74Þ
^y 0 ¼ y  ^α ^β ,
ð1:75Þ
where y , sy, and gy are, respectively, the sample mean, standard deviation, and skewness
coefﬁcient of the logarithms of the data (the logs of the x’s).
The quantile (value of x) for a return period of T years (or equivalently for an exceedance
probability p) can be obtained using the frequency factor of the gamma distribution as
loga xT
ð
Þ ¼ y þ KTsy,
ð1:76Þ
where KT is the frequency factor for the gamma distribution and is a function of the skewness
coefﬁcient γY and T. Appropriate tables that give KT for a range of values of γY and T can be
found in literature (e.g., [218]).
For the same ﬂood data used above, we ﬁt the log-Pearson III distribution. The mean,
standard deviation, and the skewness coefﬁcient of the base-10 logarithms of the sample ﬂood
data are given in Table 1.8 (3rd column). They arey ¼ 4:104, sy ¼ 0:121, and gy ¼ 0.174,
respectively. The parameters are estimated from (1.73) through (1.75) which give ^β ¼ 132:1,
^α ¼ 0:0105, and ^y 0 ¼ 5:491, respectively. The ﬂood quantiles are estimated from (1.76)
using y ¼ 4:104, sy ¼ 0:121, gy ¼ 0.174, and 10 values of the frequency factor KT that are
taken from tables [218]. The results are shown in columns 1–6 of Table 1.10. For example,

referring to the 8th row, we observe that KT ¼ 1.9592 for q ¼ 0.98 or T ¼ 50. The value of
KT is obtained by interpolating between 1.94499 and 1.99973, values that correspond to
T ¼ 50 and gy ¼ 0.20 and 0.10, respectively. Then (1.76) gives log(xT) ¼ 4.104 +
1.9592  0.121 ¼ 4.341 so that xT ¼ 21,931.4. The values of x and q from Table 1.10 are
plotted as shown in Fig. 1.29. Clearly the log-Pearson III model ﬁts the empirical CDF
reasonably well.
Gumbel Distribution
The Gumbel distribution is a particular case of the GEV distribution, i.e., the type I GEV. It
has been a popular model for ﬁtting the frequency distribution of extreme natural events such
as extreme ﬂoods and winds. The model has two parameters and a ﬁxed skewness coefﬁcient.
A nice feature of the Gumbel distribution is that both the CDF and the quantile can be written
in explicit mathematical forms; hence, its application is simple and does not require numerical
approximations or tables. Several parameter estimation techniques such as the method of
moments, probability-weighted moments, and maximum likelihood have been developed for
the Gumbel distribution (e.g., [213, 216]). In this section, we include only the moment
estimates.

For the same ﬂood data used above, we ﬁt the Gumbel model. The parameters are estimated
from (1.82) and (1.83) based on the sample statistics x ¼ 13, 172:9 and sx ¼ 3, 569.3. The
results are ^α ¼ 2, 784 and ^x 0 ¼ 11, 566. Then (1.77) and (1.78) are used to calculate the PDF
and CDF, respectively, for values of x ranging from 6,000 to 22,000 as shown in columns 1–3
in Table 1.11. Also ﬂood quantiles are estimated from (1.79) for speciﬁed values of the
non-exceedance probability q ranging from 0.1 to 0.9999 (i.e., p ranging from 0.9 to 0.0001 or
T ranging from 1.111 to 10,000 as shown in columns 4–7 in Table 1.11). The CDF is plotted in
Fig. 1.29 next to the CDF of the log-Pearson III model and the empirical CDF.

7.2.3. Risk and Reliability for Design
Design Flood and Design Life
We have seen in previous sections that annual ﬂoods are random variables that can be
described by probability laws or probability distribution functions. Once a probability model
is speciﬁed, one can determine a ﬂood quantile for any non-exceedance (or exceedance)
probability. Thus, for the models we have presented in Sect. 7.2.2 above, we have outlined the
equations and procedures for estimating ﬂood quantiles. For example, for the lognormal
model, (1.65) can be used to determine the ﬂood value x corresponding to a speciﬁed
non-exceedance probability F(x) ¼ q. Such ﬂood value (ﬂood quantile) was denoted as xq.
Also since T ¼ 1/(1  q) ¼ 1/p is the return period, such ﬂood quantile is commonly
denoted as xT and is called the T-year ﬂood (note that sometimes the notation xp is also
used which means the ﬂood with exceeding probability p ¼ 1  q). For instance, referring to
the lognormal model that was ﬁtted to the annual ﬂood data of the St. Mary’s River, the model
parameters were found to be ^μ Y ¼ 4:104 and ^σ Y ¼ 0:121. Then assuming q ¼ 0.99 (i.e.,
p ¼ 0.01 or T ¼ 100), (1.65) for x0 ¼ 0 gives
^x 0:99 ¼ exp10 4:104 þ 0:121z0:99
ð
Þ ¼ exp10 4:104 þ 0:121  2:326
ð
Þ ¼ 24, 291:
Thus, 24,291 cfs is the ﬂood with 99 % non-exceedance probability, or the ﬂood with 1 %
exceedance probability (i.e., there is 1 % of chance that ﬂoods in the referred river will exceed
24,291 in any given year), or is the 100-year ﬂood.
In the context of designing hydraulic structures such as drainage systems and spillways,
generally the return period T is speciﬁed depending on the type of structure to be designed

(e.g., [46]), and the design ﬂood is determined from the frequency analysis of ﬂood data as
referred to in Sect. 7.2.2. The design life of a hydraulic structure has an economic connotation.
For purposes of deﬁning the concept, a simple example follows. Suppose the designer of a
small bridge selects 25 years as the return period and after estimating the 25-year ﬂood from
frequency analysis, the estimated cost of the bridge is $ 50,000. To pay for the construction of
the bridge, the designer goes to the bank to borrow the money. The bank ofﬁcer tells her that
they can lend her the money if it is paid off in no more than 10 years. Then 10 years becomes
the design life. The banker in fact may ask some other technical questions or requirements
before processing the loan. For example, the bank may like to know “what is the risk that two
ﬂoods exceeding the design ﬂood may occur during the ﬁrst ﬁve years after the construction of
the bridge?” (perhaps the reasoning being that if one ﬂood exceeding the design ﬂood, say a
30-year ﬂood, occurs in the ﬁve year period, the bridge may be repaired and continue
functioning for the rest of the design life and that possibility may be acceptable to the bank,
but if two ﬂoods exceeding the design ﬂood occur within the ﬁrst ﬁve years, then that
possibility may not be acceptable to the bank especially if the risk of that event is beyond
an acceptable level). The answer to the foregoing question and similar others concerning the
risk of failure of a hydraulic structure are discussed in the sections below.
Probability of the Number of Floods Exceeding the Design Flood
in a Given Time Period
Once a tentative design ﬂood has been speciﬁed for a hydraulic structure, one of the ﬁrst
questions the designer may like to know is the probability that a certain number of ﬂoods
exceeding the design ﬂood may occur during a given number of years (e.g., during the design
life of the structure). We will answer this and other related questions using the binomial
probability law. For easy explanation in the following text, when referring to “ﬂoods that
exceed the design ﬂood,” we will use the term exceeding ﬂoods.
Firstly, let us consider a simple case. Assume that a T-year ﬂood is the design ﬂood, i.e.,
a ﬂood with p ¼ 1/T exceeding probability. This implies that p is the probability of exceeding
ﬂoods and q ¼ 1  p is the probability of non-exceeding ﬂoods. In fact, p is the probability of
exceeding ﬂoods in any given year, and we will assume that it remains constant throughout
the future years considered, and also we will assume that ﬂoods are independent events.
Figure 1.30 below illustrates this concept. Considering n ¼ 2, we would like to answer the
question: what is the probability that y exceeding ﬂoods will occur during the 2-year period?
Clearly the only possible values that Y can take on are y ¼ 0, 1, or 2. Thus, we would like to
ﬁnd P(Y ¼ 0), P(Y ¼ 1), and P(Y ¼ 2). Denoting by F the event of exceeding ﬂoods in any
1 year and by NF the opposite (non-exceeding ﬂoods), Table 1.12 summarizes the exceeding
ﬂood events that must occur in years 1 and 2 for the number of exceeding ﬂoods in the 2-year
period to be either 0, 1, or 2. The last column gives the probability P(Y ¼ y), y ¼ 0,1,2.
Following similar reasoning when n ¼ 3, one can ﬁnd that P(Y ¼ 0) ¼ (1  p)3, P(Y ¼ 1)
¼ 3 p (1  p)2, P(Y ¼ 2) ¼ 3 p2 (1  p), and P(Y ¼ 3) ¼ p3. In general, for any n, it may be
shown that

First Occurrence Probability of a Flood Exceeding the Design Flood
and Return Period
We have already stated above that return period T is equal to 1/p. However, it is useful
examining the fundamental concepts behind this deﬁnition. Let us consider again the same
ﬂood problem as before where we selected a given value of T and determine the
corresponding design ﬂood (i.e., ﬂood quantile) from frequency analysis. We would like to
answer the following question: what is the probability that an exceeding ﬂood (a ﬂood
exceeding the design ﬂood) will occur for the ﬁrst time in year w? Clearly that ﬁrst time

could be in year 1, or 2, or 3, etc., or perhaps it will never occur. Obviously the waiting time
for an exceeding ﬂood to occur for the ﬁrst time is a random variable that we will denote by W.
For an exceeding ﬂood to occur for the ﬁrst time at year W ¼ w, the following event must
occur:

which is the geometric probability law. It may be shown that E(W) ¼ 1/p, i.e., the expected
waiting time or the mean number of years that will take for an exceeding ﬂood to occur is 1/p
and that has become known as return period, i.e., T ¼ 1/p.
Risk of Failure and Reliability
Risk and reliability are important concepts for designing hydraulic structures. In the
previous examples on designing ﬂood-related structures such as a bridge, we assumed that
the return period T was selected from design tables or manuals and that the actual design ﬂood
magnitude is found from ﬂood frequency analysis. In this section, we are interested on the risk
of failure of the referred structure. However, we must specify a time frame such as one year
and two years where the possibility of failure of the referred structure may occur. Also we will
deﬁne as failure as that situation in which a ﬂood exceeding the design ﬂood occurs. Then we
can ask the question: “what is the risk of failure of the structure in a period of n years?” (The
value of n could be in fact the design life that we referred to in Sect. 7.2.3 above.) For instance,
for n ¼ 1, the reliability is Rl ¼ q ¼ 1  p and conversely the risk is R ¼ 1  Rl ¼ p. When
n ¼ 2 the reliability of the structure can be calculated by the event that no exceeding ﬂoods
will occur in the 2-year period, i.e., NF in the ﬁrst year and NF in the second year. Thus, the
probability of such 2-year event is (1  p) (1  p) ¼ (1  p)2 so that the reliability of the
structure is Rl ¼ 1  p
ð
Þ2 and consequently the risk of failure becomes R ¼ 1  (1  p)2.
Likewise, in general for an n-year period, the reliability is (1  p)n and the risk of failure
becomes R ¼ 1  (1  p)n.
Actually with the foregoing background, we can now deﬁne reliability and risk using the
binomial law previously described in Sect. 7.2.3. We deﬁne reliability as the probability that
no exceeding ﬂoods will occur in an n-year period, i.e., Rl ¼ P Y ¼ 0
ð
Þ where Y ¼ random
variable denoting the number of exceeding ﬂoods in an n-year period. Likewise, risk is
deﬁned as the probability that one or more exceeding ﬂoods will occur in an n-year period,
i.e., R ¼ P(Y > 0) ¼ 1  P(Y ¼ 0). These probabilities can be readily obtained from (1.84).

Consider the data and results of the log-Pearson III model which was ﬁtted to the annual
ﬂood data of the St. Mary’s River (Sect. 7.2.2). Assume that a large bridge will be designed
to cross the river. From design tables (e.g., [46]), the return period for designing a large
bridge is taken as 50 years, and the 50-year ﬂood using the log-Pearson III model gives

failure, one may have to increase the design ﬂood. For instance, if T ¼ 100 and p ¼ 0.01,
then the risk becomes 9.6 %.
Expected Damage, Vulnerability, and Risk
In the previous section, we deﬁned the term risk in the sense of hydrologic risk. However,
in actual practice, the term risk also has other connotations. For example, continuing with the
previous reference to ﬂood events, let us assume that for a given reach of a river, it is known
that the relationship between the ﬂood level H and the damage D, i.e., D ¼ g1(H) and D, can
be expressed in monetary terms. Likewise, we assume a relationship between the ﬂood level
H and the ﬂood discharge X, i.e., H ¼ g2(X). Because the probability distribution of X is
known (Sect. 7.3), then conceptually we can ﬁnd the distribution fH(h) of the ﬂood level H and
consequently the distribution fD(d) of the ﬂood damage D. Then the expected value of the
ﬂood damage E(D) can be found by integration, i.e., E D
ð Þ ¼
R 1
1dfD(d)dd. Such expected
damage (expected cost) has been also called risk, i.e., R ¼ E(D). A practical reference on this
subject is USACE [222].
However, an alternative way at looking at the problem may be ﬁnding a relationship
(function) linking directly the damage D and the ﬂood X, e.g., d(X). In this case, the expected
damage (risk) can be found as R ¼ E D
ð Þ ¼
R 1
1 d(x)fX(x)dx. More realistically, since the
damage begins to occur after the ﬂood has reached some threshold, say x0, and the damage after
the ﬂood reaches and exceeds some maximum threshold, xm is likely to be a total or maximum
damage dm (e.g., total loss of a farmhouse, thus the cost of replacing the property), then the
expected damage must be determined as R ¼ E D

where FX(xm) is the CDF of the ﬂood X evaluated at the value xm.
Furthermore, we may add the concept of vulnerability. Assume a simple case where a
ﬂood wall is built to protect the ﬂood plain so that d(x) ¼ 0 if x  xd and d(x) ¼ dm if
x > xd, where xd is the design ﬂood of the ﬂood wall. Then the risk is given by R ¼ P
(X > xd)dm. In addition, assume that the property owners in the ﬂoodplain have the option
of building additional protection for their property. For example, if they do nothing, then the
damage is dm when the ﬂood exceeds xd, and in that case, the vulnerability (V) of the
property is 100 %. While if property owners build say a wall surrounding their property, we

79

may estimate the vulnerability as say 75 %, and if, in addition, they protect the doors and
windows, then the estimated vulnerability may be reduced to 60 %. Thus, the risk is now
given by R ¼ P(X > xd)dmV. Therefore, in general assuming that vulnerability is also a
function of the ﬂood magnitude, V(x), the expected damage (risk) may be determined as
R ¼ E D

in connection to ﬂood analysis may be found in Platte [223].
7.2.4. Regional Frequency Analysis
In general, regional frequency analysis is a procedure for estimating quantiles of a
probability distribution of the variable of interest (e.g., ﬂoods, low ﬂows, or maximum
precipitation) which is applicable to a given region (or area). Commonly this is done where
the particular site (e.g., a stream cross section) lacks enough data so that a reliable estimate of
a given quantile (e.g., the 100-year ﬂood) can be made or the site is ungauged. Thus,
alternative methods have been developed in literature depending on the type of variable,
although some of the methods may be equally applicable regardless of the type of variable.
A widely used method for regional ﬂood frequency analysis is based on a multiple
regression model such as Y ¼ aXb1
1 Xb2
2 . . . Xbm
m , where the dependent variable Y may represent
a particular ﬂood quantile (e.g., the T-year ﬂood say QT) and the Xs are the independent
variables (predictors), which generally involve physiographic (e.g., area of the basin, slope,
and drainage density) and climatic (e.g., index of precipitation, temperature, and wind)
characteristics. Literature abounds on applying this technique (e.g., [213, 224–228]). For
example, Mc Cain and Jarrett [226] found the regression equation Q100 ¼ 1.88A0.787P0.932 for
the mountains of the State of Colorado, USA, where A and P represent the drainage area and
the mean annual precipitation, respectively. Selecting a particular quantile (say QT) as the
dependent variable has the disadvantage that multiple regression equations may be needed,
i.e., one for every T. Instead two alternatives may be (1) regionalizing the sample moments
such as Q , SQ, and gQ (i.e., the sample mean, standard deviation, and skewness coefﬁcient,
respectively) from which the estimates of the parameters θ of the ﬂood frequency distribution
f Q q, θ


can be determined based on the method of moments and (2) regionalizing the
parameters of a particular model. The two alternatives have the advantage that only two or
three regressions are needed (depending on the model) and any ﬂood quantile may be derived
from the regionalized parameters (e.g., [227, 229]).
Another alternative, which is applicable for regionalizing ﬂood quantiles and extreme
precipitation quantiles, is the so-called index-ﬂood method (IFM). This method, originally
suggested by Dalrymple [230], involves three key assumptions: (1) observations at any given
site are independent and identically distributed, (2) observations at different sites are inde-
pendent, and (3) frequency distributions at different sites are identical except for a scale
factor. The ﬁrst assumption is a basic assumption for most methods of frequency analysis of
extreme events, but the last two assumptions are unlikely to be met by hydrometeorological
data [231]. The third assumption may be mathematically characterized as yðiÞ
q ¼ μ(i)yR
q,
80
J.D. Salas et al.

i ¼ 1, . . ., n where yðiÞ
q ¼ qth quantile for site i, μ(i) ¼ index ﬂood for site i, yR
q ¼ regional qth
quantile, and n ¼ number of sites in the region. The index ﬂood μ(i) is usually taken to be the
at-site population mean for site i, which is estimated by the at-site sample mean, i.e.,
^μ ið Þ ¼ y ið Þ. To estimate the regional qth quantile, a model is assumed, and the parameter
estimation may be based on the method of moments, probability-weighted moments, or
maximum likelihood, depending on the selected model. Details on the applicability of this
method for ﬂood and extreme precipitation frequency analysis can be found in many
published papers and books (e.g., [231–236]). An apparent ﬂaw of the method resulting
from using the sample mean as the index ﬂood (as noted above) has been discussed by
Stedinger [237] and Sveinsson et al. [238], and an index-ﬂood method that avoids such a ﬂaw
(called the population index ﬂood) has been developed [238]. In addition, Burn et al. [239]
discussed approaches for regionalizing catchments for regional ﬂood frequency analysis,
Cunnane [240] reviewed the various methods and merits of regional ﬂood frequency analysis,
and also a worldwide comparison of regional ﬂood estimation methods has been done [241].
Furthermore, regionalization and estimation of low-ﬂow variables (e.g., [242–247]) and
droughts (e.g., [248–250]) have been suggested in literature.
7.2.5. Uncertainty Considerations in Frequency Analysis
In the examples in Sect. 7.2.2, we illustrated how one can estimate the parameters θ of a
speciﬁed distributionf X x; θ


given that we have observations x1, . . ., xN of say ﬂood, extreme
precipitation, or low ﬂows. However, since the parameters are estimated from a limited
sample, they are uncertain quantities, i.e., ^θ ¼ g1 x1; . . . ; xN
ð
Þ, and consequently since the
qth quantile xq is a function of the parameters, then it is also an uncertain quantity, i.e.,
^x q ¼ g2 ^θ
 
. Thus, for the common distributions that are generally applied in hydrology and
water resources and for the various estimation methods, procedures have been developed for
estimating the conﬁdence limits for the population parameters and conﬁdence limits for the
population quantiles (e.g., [213, 216, 218, 251]). Obviously those conﬁdence limits depend on
the sample size N, and as the sample size becomes larger, the conﬁdence interval becomes
narrower and conversely.
There is the additional uncertainty regarding the distribution model, although often the
model may be suggested by manuals or standards and they vary with the region or country.
For example, for ﬂood frequency analysis, the log-Pearson III is the preferred model in the
United States, while the logistic model is the recommended model in Great Britain. Regard-
less there are also statistical procedures for testing the goodness of ﬁt of the models although
often more than one candidate model may not be rejected by the tests [219]. Likewise,
simulation studies can be made for comparing the applicability of alternative models for
estimating quantiles that are beyond the length of the historical sample. Also when the sample
size for a given site is small, one may apply statistical models to extend the short records if
longer records are available at nearby basins, and in some cases, rainfall-runoff models may
be useful for record extension. And as indicated above, regional frequency analysis may be
Introduction to Hydrology
81

also applied particularly for ungauged basins, but also regional parameters or quantile
estimates can be combined with at-site estimates (e.g., [226]).
Furthermore, in designing ﬂood-related hydraulic structures, it is a common practice to
specify a return period and derive the corresponding design ﬂood of the structure from the
frequency distribution of the historical annual ﬂoods. Thus, the return period T ¼ 1/(1  q) is
speciﬁed and the design ﬂood xq obtained from the selected CDF Fðx; θÞ. Another case that
arises in practice relates to projects that have been operating for some time, and it may be
desirable reevaluating the capacity of the structure. This may be desirable because of several
reasons such as the occurrence of extreme ﬂoods, the additional years of ﬂood records, the
modiﬁcation of design manuals and procedures, and perhaps changes in the hydrologic
regime as a result of climate variability and change, or changes in the landscape and land
use, etc. [216]. In any case, reevaluating the capacity of the structure means that the ﬂood
magnitude is known and one may like to recalculate the structure’s performance, such as the
return period and the risk of failure. Thus, in this second situation, the design ﬂood magnitude
xq is known, and the problem is estimating the non-exceedance probability q. Thus, q is the
uncertain quantity (and consequently p, T, and R). A method that accounts for the uncertainty
in estimating the non-exceedance probability q, the return period T, and the risk of failure
R has been suggested by Salas and Heo [252], Salas et al., [253], and Salas et al. [254].
7.3. Stochastic Methods in Hydrology and Water Resources
7.3.1. Introduction
Generally stochastic (time series) models may be used for two main purposes, namely, for
stochastic simulation or data generation and for forecasting. In stochastic simulation, we use
a stochastic model to generate artiﬁcial records of the variable at hand, e.g., streamﬂows, for a
speciﬁed period of time, e.g., 50 years. Depending on the problem, one can simulate many
equally likely samples of streamﬂows, each 50 years long or simulate one very long sample
(e.g., 100,000 years long). On the other hand, in forecasting, we make the best estimate of the
value of streamﬂow that may occur say in the period April–July given the observed
streamﬂows in the past and many other predictors as needed. Typically, stochastic simulation
is used for planning purposes, e.g., for estimating the capacity of a reservoir to supply water
for an irrigation system, for testing operating rules and procedures under uncertain hydrologic
scenarios, for estimating the return period of severe droughts, and for many other purposes
(e.g., [255, 256]). On the other hand, short-term, medium-term, and long-range forecasting are
needed in practice for a number of applications such as operating water supply systems,
hydropower network systems, ﬂood warning systems, irrigation scheduling, water releases
from reservoirs, and tracking the dynamics of ongoing droughts.
The ﬁeld of stochastic hydrology has been developed since the early work of Hurst [257],
Thomas and Fiering [258], Yevjevich [259], Matalas [260], and Mandelbrot and Wallis [261]
in the 1950s and 1960s who inspired the work and contributions of many others along several
directions and books, chapters of books, papers, manuals, and software have been developed.
Perhaps a broad classiﬁcation of the various methods proposed may be as parametric and
82
J.D. Salas et al.

nonparametric methods, and in each (category) well-known models and approaches became
popular such as autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) for
parametric (e.g., [255, 256, 262–264]) and bootstrap, kernel density estimates (KDE),
K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and variations thereof for nonparametric (e.g., [217, 265–269]).
Also the methods and names of models depend on the type of hydrologic processes to be
analyzed, such as precipitation or streamﬂows, on the time scale, i.e., hourly, daily, seasonal,
and yearly, and the number of sites involved (single or multiple sites). For example, contem-
poraneous ARMA (CARMA) has been widely used for modeling multisite streamﬂows (e.g.,
[256, 264]). Also modeling and simulation of complex systems can be simpliﬁed using
temporal and spatial disaggregation and aggregation approaches (e.g., [256, 262,
270–276]). In this section, we introduce the subject with some concepts and deﬁnitions,
describe how to characterize a hydrologic time series at yearly and monthly time scales, and
apply a simple AR model along with an example to illustrate how to simulate streamﬂows.
Subsequently we brieﬂy discuss additional concepts regarding forecasting followed by a
section on uncertainty issues. The issue of nonstationarity is covered in Sect. 7.4.
7.3.2. Main Concepts and Deﬁnitions
Most hydrologic series of practical interest are discrete time series deﬁned on hourly, daily,
weekly, monthly, and annual time intervals. The term seasonal time series is often used for
series with time intervals that are fractions of a year (e.g., a month). Also seasonal time series
are often called periodic-stochastic series because although being stochastic, they evolve in
a periodic fashion from year to year. Hydrologic time series may be single or univariate
series (e.g., the monthly precipitation series at a given gauge) and multiple or multivariate
series (e.g., the monthly precipitation series obtained from several gauges). A time series is
said to be stationary if the statistical properties such as the mean, variance, and skewness do
not vary through time. Conversely if the statistical properties vary through time, then the time
series is nonstationary.
Hydrologic time series are generally autocorrelated. Autocorrelation in some series such
as streamﬂow usually arises from the effects of surface, soil, and groundwater storages
[256]. Conversely, annual precipitation and annual maximum ﬂows (ﬂood peaks) are usually
uncorrelated. Sometimes autocorrelation may be the result of trends and/or shifts in the series
[97, 277]. In addition, multiple hydrologic series may be cross-correlated. For example, the
streamﬂow series at two nearby gauging stations in a river basin are expected to be cross-
correlated because the sites are subject to similar climatic and hydrologic events, and as the
sites considered become farther apart, their cross-correlation decreases. However, because of
the effect of some large-scale atmospheric-oceanic phenomena such as ENSO (El Nin˜o
Southern Oscillation), signiﬁcant cross-correlation between SST (sea surface temperature)
and streamﬂow between sites that may be thousands of miles apart can be found [278]. Fur-
thermore, hydrologic time series may be intermittent when the variable under consideration
takes on nonzero and zero values throughout the length of the record. For instance, hourly and
daily rainfalls are typically intermittent series, while monthly and annual rainfalls are usually
Introduction to Hydrology
83

non-intermittent. However, in arid regions, even monthly and annual precipitation and runoff
may be intermittent as well.
Traditionally, certain annual hydrologic series have been considered to be stationary,
although this assumption may be incorrect because of the effect of large-scale climatic
variability, natural disruptions like a volcanic eruption, anthropogenic changes such as the
effect of reservoir construction on downstream ﬂow, and the effect of landscape changes on
some components of the hydrologic cycle [279]. Also, hydrologic series deﬁned at time
intervals smaller than a year such as months generally exhibit distinct seasonal (periodic)
patterns due to the annual revolution of the earth around the sun. Likewise, summer hourly
rainfall series or certain water quality constituents related to temperature may also exhibit
distinct diurnal patterns due to the daily rotation of the earth [280, 281]. Cyclic patterns of
hydrologic series translate into statistical characteristics that vary within the year or within a
week or a day as the case may be, such as seasonal or periodic variations in the mean,
variance, covariance, and skewness. Thus, series with periodic variations in their statistical
properties are nonstationary.
In addition of seasonality (periodicity), hydrologic time series may exhibit trends, shifts or
jumps, autocorrelation, and non-normality. In general, natural and human-induced factors
may produce gradual and instantaneous trends and shifts (jumps) in hydroclimatic series. For
example, a large forest ﬁre in a river basin can immediately affect the runoff, producing a shift
in the runoff series. A large volcanic explosion or a large landslide can produce sudden
changes in the sediment transport series of a stream. Trends in nonpoint source water quality
series may be the result of long-term changes in agricultural practices and agricultural land
development, and changes in land use and the development of reservoirs and diversion
structures may also cause trends and shifts in streamﬂow series. The concern about the effects
of global warming and those from low-frequency components in the atmospheric and ocean
system (e.g., the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) is
making hydrologists more aware of the occurrence of trends and shifts in hydrologic
time series and the ensuing effects on water resources, the environment, and society (e.g.,
[279, 282], and also refer to Sect. 7.4).
7.3.3. Stochastic Characteristics of Hydrologic Data
The stochastic characterization of the underlying hydrologic processes is important in
constructing stochastic models. In general, the stochastic characteristics of hydrologic series
depend on the type of data at hand, e.g., data of precipitation and streamﬂow, and the time
scale, e.g., yearly and monthly. The most commonly used statistical properties for analyzing
hydrologic time series are the sample mean y , variance s2, coefﬁcient of variation Cv,
skewness coefﬁcient g, and lag-k autocorrelation coefﬁcient rk. Coefﬁcients of variation of
annual ﬂows are typically smaller than one, although they may be close to one or greater in
streams in arid and semiarid regions. The coefﬁcients of skewness g of annual ﬂows are
typically greater than zero. In some streams, small values of g are found suggesting that
annual ﬂows may be approximately normally distributed. On the other hand, in streams of arid
and semiarid regions, g can be greater than one.

where N ¼ sample size and k ¼ time lag. The lag-1 autocorrelation coefﬁcient r1 (also called
serial correlation coefﬁcient) is a simple measure of the degree of time dependence of a series.
Generally r1 for annual ﬂows is small but positive, although negative r1s may occur because
of sample variability. Large values of r1 for annual ﬂows can be found for a number of reasons
including the effect of natural or man-made surface storage such as lakes, reservoirs, or
glaciers, the effect of groundwater storage, the effect of errors in naturalizing streamﬂow data,
and the effect of low-frequency components of the climate system. The estimators sy
2, gy, and
r1 are biased downward relative to the corresponding population statistics. Corrections for
bias for these estimators have been suggested (e.g., [283–285]). In addition, when analyzing
several time series jointly, cross-correlations may be important (e.g., [256]).
While the overall stochastic properties of hydrologic time series, such as those deﬁned
above, may be determined either from annual series or for seasonal series as a whole, speciﬁc
seasonal (periodic) properties may provide a better picture of the stochastic characteristics of
hydrologic time series that are deﬁned at time intervals smaller than a year such as monthly
streamﬂow data. Let the seasonal time series be represented by yν,τ, ν ¼ 1, . . ., N; τ ¼ 1,
. . ., ω in which ν ¼ year, τ ¼ season, N ¼ number of years of record, and ω ¼ the number
of seasons per year (e.g., ω ¼ 12 for monthly data). Then, for each season τ, one can
determine the mean y τ, variance s2
τ, coefﬁcient of variation Cvτ, and skewness coefﬁcient

For instance, for monthly streamﬂows, r1,4 represents the correlation between the ﬂows of
the fourth month with those of the third month. Note that for τ ¼ 1, c0,τ  1 in (1.95a) must be
replaced by c0,ω, and for τ ¼ 1 and k ¼ 1, yν,τ  1 and y τ1 in (1.95b) must be replaced by
yν  1,ω and y ω, respectively. Likewise, for multiple seasonal time series, the sample lag-1
seasonal cross-correlation coefﬁcient rij

ν;τ and yðjÞ
ν;τ1 for
sites i and j may be determined.
The statistics y τ, sτ, gτ, and r1,τ may be plotted versus time τ ¼ 1,. . .,ω to observe whether
they exhibit a seasonal pattern. Fitting these statistics by Fourier series is especially effective
for weekly and daily data [262]. Generally, for seasonal streamﬂow series, y τ > sτ although
for some streams y τ may be smaller than sτ especially during the “low-ﬂow” season.
Furthermore, for streamﬂow series in dry areas, the mean may be smaller than the standard
deviation, i.e., y τ < sτ throughout the year [279]. Likewise, values of the skewness coefﬁcient
gτ for the dry season are generally larger than those for the wet season indicating that data in
the dry season depart more from normality than data in the wet season. Values of the skewness
for intermittent hydrologic series are usually larger than skewness for similar non-intermittent
series. Seasonal correlations r1,τ for streamﬂow during the dry season are generally larger than
86
J.D. Salas et al.

those for the wet season, and they are signiﬁcantly different than zero for most of the months.
On the other hand, month-to-month correlations for monthly precipitation are generally low
or not signiﬁcantly different from zero for most of the months [286], while lag-1 correlations
are generally greater than zero for weekly, daily, and hourly precipitation.
For illustration consider the time series of annual streamﬂows for the Poudre River at
Mouth of the Canyon for the period 1971–1990 (as shown in Table 1.13, column 2). We
would like to calculate the main stochastic characteristics of the annual ﬂow data. We apply
(1.88)–(1.90) to get the mean, standard deviation, and skewness coefﬁcient, respectively, of
the original data denoted as xt. They are shown at the bottom of column 2 in Table 1.13. It
gives a coefﬁcient of variation of about 0.41. Note that the skewness coefﬁcient is about 1.4,
which suggests that the data are skewed to the right and departs from the normal distribution.

We apply the logarithmic transformation to try bringing the skewness down to zero (and close
to the normal distribution). The log-transformed ﬂows are shown in column 3, and the
resulting statistics are given at the bottom. In this case, the skewness coefﬁcient is 0.018,
i.e., near zero. Thus, we can assume that the log-transformed ﬂows are close to be normal
distributed. In addition, we calculate the lag-1 serial correlation coefﬁcient r1 of the
transformed ﬂows yt. For this purpose, we apply (1.91a) and (1.91b) and get r1 ¼ 0.107.
This low value is typical of small rivers (by the way, the r1 obtained for the same river based
on a 120-year data set gives a value of r1 of about 0.15).
7.3.4. Stochastic Modeling and Simulation of Hydrologic Data
A number of stochastic models have been developed for simulating hydrologic processes
such as streamﬂows. Some of the models are conceptually (physically) based, some others are
empirical or transformed or adapted from existing models developed in other ﬁelds, while
some others have arisen speciﬁcally to address some particular features of the process under
consideration. In general models for short time scales such as daily are more complex than
models for larger time scales such as monthly and annual. Also some of the models have been
developed speciﬁcally for precipitation while some others for streamﬂow. Yet many of them
are useful for both and for many other hydrologic processes. We will illustrate here a simple
model that may be useful for data generation of annual data at one site (single variable).
In some cases, the model may be also useful for data generation of monthly data after
standardizing the data seasonally (i.e., season by season) although periodic-stochastic models
may be better to apply for seasonal data. For further description of alternative models that are
available for annual and seasonal data for both single site and multisite systems including
models for intermittent data, the reader is referred to Salas et al. [262], Loucks et al. [255],
Salas [256], and Hipel and McLeod [264].
We will use the lag-1 autoregressive or AR(1) model, which is given by
yt ¼ μy þ ϕ yt1  μy


þ εt,
ð1:96Þ
where εt is a random noise term which is normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ2
ε
and is uncorrelated with yt  1. In addition it may be shown that because εt is normally
distributed, also yt is normal with mean μy and variance σ2
y ¼ σ2
ε/(1  ϕ2). To generate
synthetic records of the variable yt, one can use model (1.96) if the model parameters are
known or estimated. The parameters of the model may be estimated by using the method of
moments (although other methods are available). They are

where in this case, ξt is a normal random variable with mean zero and variance one. Thus, to
generate the variable yt, one needs to generate the normal random number ξt. The standard
normal random number ξt can be found from tables or from numerical algorithms available to
generate standard normal random numbers (e.g., [256, 287]). Also the function NORMINV of
Excel can be used to generate standard normal random numbers. One may observe from
(1.100a) that it is also necessary to know the previous value of y, i.e., yt  1. For example, to
generate the ﬁrst value y1, (1.100b) gives
y1 ¼ 1  r1
ð
Þy þ r1y0 þ

which says that in addition to ξ1, we need to know the initial value y0. The initial value y0 may
be taken to be equal to the mean y , but in order to remove the effect of such arbitrary initial
condition, one should warm up the generation as suggested by Fiering and Jackson [288]. For
example, if we want to generate a sample of 100 values of yt, one could generate 150 values,
drop the ﬁrst 50, and use the remaining 100 values. Alternatively, y0 can be taken randomly
from a normal distribution with mean y and standard deviation sy. This way there is no need
for a warm up generation. We will illustrate the approach by generating a few values of yt as
shown in the example below.
We use the data of the annual ﬂows of the Poudre River shown in Table 1.13 and the AR
(1) model (1.100) to generate synthetic annual ﬂows for the Poudre. Firstly, we will build a
model in the logarithmic domain because the data analysis in Sect. 7.3.3 showed that the
original data were skewed and that the logarithmic transformation was able to bring
the skewness down to nearly zero. Recall from Table 1.13 that the basic statistics of the
log-transformed ﬂows are y ¼ 5:46473, sy ¼ 0.1704, and r1 ¼ 0.107. To start the generation,
we must generate the initial value y0. For this purpose, we obtain the standard normal random
number 0.0898 so that
y0 ¼ y þ syξ0 ¼ 5:46473 þ 0:1704  0:0898
ð

Then values of yt are obtained by successively applying (1.101). For example, we get

y1 ¼ 4:88 þ 0:107y0 þ 0:169422ξ1 ¼ 4:88 þ 0:107  5:449428 þ 0:169422  0:4987

and so on. Furthermore, since the original ﬂow data xt has been transformed into a normal
variable yt by using the logarithmic transformation, we need to invert the data generated
(in the normal domain) back to the original ﬂow domain. Taking the antilog can do this, i.e.,
xt ¼ 10yt. Thus, inverting the generated values y1 ¼ 5.37860 and y2 ¼ 5.666799, we get
x1 ¼ 105.37860 ¼ 239, 111.3 acreft and x2 ¼ 105.666799 ¼ 464, 300.7 acre‐ft.
The rest of the example can be seen in Table 1.14 below where ten values of synthetic
streamﬂows have been generated.
Generally one must generate many samples (e.g., 100) each of length equal to the historical
sample to make comparisons and veriﬁcations in order to see whether the model is capable of
“reproducing” in the statistical sense the historical statistics that are relevant to the problem at
hand (e.g., basic statistics, storage capacity, drought duration, and magnitude). For this
purpose, one may use box plots and software packages such as SPIGOT [289] and SAMS-
2010 [290]. In general, the length of generation depends on the particular planning and
management problem at hand (e.g., [255, 256]).

7.3.5. Stochastic Forecasting
Stochastic forecasting techniques have been used in hydrology and water resources for a
long time. Some of the stochastic techniques that are applied for short-, medium-, and long-
term forecasting of hydrologic variables such as streamﬂows include regression models,
principal components-based regression models, autoregressive integrated moving average
(ARIMA) models, autoregressive moving average with exogenous variables (ARMAX), and
transfer function noise (TFN) models. The advantage of using well-structured models is that
model identiﬁcation and parameter estimation techniques are widely available in statistical
software packages. In addition, Kalman ﬁltering techniques can be included to allow for
model parameters to vary through time. Examples of applying many of these models
including nonparametric techniques and extended streamﬂow prediction can be found in a
number of papers and books published in literature (e.g., [264, 291–295]). In addition,
because short-term rainfall is an intermittent process, often Markov chains and point process
models are applied for forecasting rainfall (e.g., [296–298]).
Furthermore, since about 1990, artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) have become popular for
a number of applications such as streamﬂow and precipitation forecasting. The ASCE J.
Hydrol. Engr. Vol.5, No.2, 2000 is a dedicated issue on the subject, and the book Artiﬁcial
Neural Networks in Hydrology [299] includes some chapters speciﬁcally on streamﬂow
forecasting (e.g., [300, 301]). Also French et al. [302] used ANN to forecast rainfall intensity
ﬁelds, and ANN was applied for forecasting rainfall for 6-h lead time based on observations of
rainfall and wind at a number of gauges [303]. Other forecasting applications of ANN can be
found in [304] and [305].
Also since about the 1990s, a variety of stochastic forecasting approaches have been
developed based on hydrologic, oceanic, and atmospheric predictors. It has demonstrated
the signiﬁcant effects of climatic signals such as SST, ENSO, PDO, AMO, and NAO and
other atmospheric variables such as pressure and wind on precipitation and streamﬂow
variations (e.g., [14, 306–310]) and that seasonal and longer-term streamﬂow forecasts can
be improved using climatic factors (e.g., [307, 311–315]).
For example, Stone et al. [316] developed a probabilistic rainfall forecast using the
Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) as a predictor. Also Sharma [317] applied a nonparametric
model to forecast rainfall with 3–24 months of lead times. Another example is the forecasting
of the Blue Nile River seasonal streamﬂows based on sea surface temperature (SST) for lead
times of several months and up to 24 months based on multiple linear regression and principal
component analysis [312]. And Grantz et al. [313] developed a forecast model using SST,
GH, and SWE as predictors for forecasting April–July streamﬂows at the Truckee and Carson
rivers in Nevada. They found that forecast skills are signiﬁcant for up to 5-month lead time
based on SST and GH. Also Regonda et al. [318] reported April–July streamﬂow forecasts in
the Gunnison River using various climatic factors. And more recently, Salas et al. [315]
reported successful forecasting results of seasonal and yearly streamﬂows in several rivers
with headwaters in the State of Colorado based on hydrologic, oceanic, and atmospheric
predictors.

7.3.6. Uncertainty Issues in Stochastic Generation and Forecasting
Uncertainties in hydrologic stochastic simulation may arise from various sources which
include model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. Model uncertainty can be minimized by
applying well-known models, testing them with appropriate procedures, and relying on the
experience and judgment of the modeler. Thus, we will center our attention here on the
uncertainty that arises from the limited data that may be available for analysis. Stochastic
models are often applied for simulating possible hydrologic scenarios that may occur in the
future. But since the parameters of the underlying models are estimated using limited records,
the parameter estimates are uncertain quantities, and consequently the decision variables that
may be used for planning and management of water resources systems, such as the storage
capacity of a reservoir or the critical drought that may occur in a given number of years, are
also uncertain quantities.
The effect of parameter uncertainty using stochastic models can be quantiﬁed based on
asymptotic analysis and Bayesian inference. In the asymptotic analysis, the approximate
distributions of parameter estimators are derived based upon large sample theory. For
example, Box and Jenkins [319] derived the large sample variance-covariance matrix of
parameter estimators for univariate autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models, which
enables one deﬁning an approximate distribution of parameter estimators for sufﬁcient large
sample size. Also Camacho et al. [320] studied the large sample properties of parameter
estimators of the contemporaneous autoregressive moving average (CARMA) model. In the
Bayesian framework, the posterior distributions of parameter estimators describe the uncer-
tainty of the parameters. Vicens et al. [321] determined the Bayesian posterior distribution of
the parameters of the lag-1 autoregressive model, and Valdes et al. [322] expanded the
Bayesian approach to the multivariate AR(1) model. Their application with diffuse prior
distribution showed that the model produces synthetic ﬂows with higher standard deviations
than the historical sample when the historical records are short. Also McLeod and Hipel [323]
suggested simulation procedures for streamﬂow generation with parameter uncertainty based
on the ARMA model. In addition, Stedinger and Taylor [324] also applied the Bayesian
framework to examine the effect of parameter uncertainty of annual streamﬂow generation for
determining the reservoir system capacity and suggested that incorporating parameter uncer-
tainty into the streamﬂow generation would increase the variability of the generated storage
capacity.
Although the issue of parameter uncertainty based on parametric models such as ARMA
has been well recognized in the past and some procedures have been suggested (e.g., [262,
289, 321–323, 325–328]), unfortunately the conventional approaches, i.e., simulation with no
consideration of parameter uncertainty, are still being applied in practice generally leading to
underdesign of hydraulic structures. This issue has been reexamined by Lee et al. [329] and
suggests that neglecting parameter uncertainty in stochastic simulation may have serious
consequences for determining the storage capacity of reservoirs or estimating critical
droughts.
Furthermore, forecasts based on any type of ARMA, ARMAX, and TFN models can
include the estimation of conﬁdence limits (e.g., [264]). Also in conjunction with Kalman
92
J.D. Salas et al.

ﬁlter techniques, previous forecast errors can be used to improve forecasts for subsequent time
steps (e.g., [291]). Likewise, conﬁdence limits on forecasts based on multiple regression
models are also well known in literature (e.g., [215, 330]).
7.4. Nonstationarity
Over the past decades, there have been a number of studies documenting that hydrologic
records exhibit some type of nonstationarity in the form of increasing or decreasing trends
(e.g., [331–335]), upward and downward shifts (e.g., [277, 336–339]), or a combination of
trends and shifts. Perhaps the most obvious cases of human intervention leading to changes in
the ﬂow characteristics in part of the basin is the construction of diversion dams and dams for
water regulation (which cause signiﬁcant changes in the water regime downstream of the dam
site but also changes in sediment transport and water quality). Also, it has been argued that
streamﬂow records may be changing because of the effect of land use changes in the basin
such as increasing urbanization (e.g., [340]), the effect of deforestation, and the conversion of
arid and semiarid lands in large-scale irrigated ﬁelds (e.g., [279]).
The changes resulting from human intervention, some of which have been referred to
above, are quite clear, and water resources engineers have developed methods to quantify
them. In fact, a key step in many hydrologic studies is to “naturalize” the gauged ﬂow records
where upstream human intervention has taken place (although in complex systems, it is not an
easy problem). However, in the last few years, it has been apparent that some part of the
“changes” that we may be observing in hydrologic records may be due to the effect of climatic
variability, particularly resulting from low-frequency components such as ENSO (El Nin˜o
Southern Oscillation) but more importantly from large-scale decadal and multidecadal oscil-
lations such as the PDO and AMO. And these large-scale forcing factors have been shown to
exert in-phase and out-of-face oscillations in the magnitude of ﬂoods, mean ﬂows, and
droughts (e.g., [338, 339, 341–343]). To tackle the various types of nonstationarities, several
stochastic approaches have been proposed in the literature such as using ﬂood frequency
distributions with mixed components (e.g., [344–347]), ﬂood frequency models imbedded
with trend components (e.g., [333, 348–350]), ﬂood frequency modeling considering shifting
patterns (e.g., [351, 352]), and ﬂood frequency modeling considering covariates (e.g., [348,
349, 353, 354]).
In addition, stochastic approaches have been developed to deal with nonstationarities to
simulate, for example, monthly and yearly hydrologic processes such as streamﬂows (e.g., for
drought studies and design of reservoirs) using both short-memory models, such as shifting
mean models and regime switching models that have features of nonstationarity (e.g., [277,
339, 343, 355–357]), and long-memory models such as FARMA (e.g., [358–360]) and
fractional Gaussian noise models (e.g., [361, 362]). Thus, the ﬁeld of stochastic hydrology
has been enriched in the past decades to accommodate both stationary and nonstationary
features of hydrologic regimes. However, a word of caution is that as more features of the
hydroclimate regimes are involved and considered, it has become necessary to develop more
sophisticated models and procedures, some of which require a very good understanding of
stochastic processes and hydroclimatic variability. On the other hand, the availability of
Introduction to Hydrology
93

computational tools, databases, and software have made it possible to develop and, in some
cases, to apply some of the complex models referred to above in actual cases of planning and
management of water resources systems.
8. ADVANCES IN HYDROLOGIC DATA ACQUISITION
AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
In order to have a good understanding of the dynamics of the hydrologic cycle, it has been
necessary to make observations of the key variables involved such as precipitation, air
temperature, humidity, evaporation, inﬁltration, soil moisture, groundwater levels, and
streamﬂow. While ﬁeld measurements are still being made with traditional equipment and
devices, such as the conventional rain gauges and current ﬂow meters, over the years,
measurement equipment has become more sophisticated taking advantage of technological
developments in materials, electronics, software, hardware, remote sensing, image
processing, and computational algorithms. As a result, data have become more plentiful,
often accessible in real time depending on the case and needs. Automated data screening may
also make certain data sources more reliable.
Among the various developments, perhaps the most prominent ones are those obtained
from spaceborne sensors that help gather information useful for hydrologic investigations.
Thus, in this section, we summarize the main products that are being developed based on
remote sensing from space. Also we include advances made for hydrologic measurements in
large rivers and developing data information systems to make data gathering and applications
more efﬁcient.
8.1. Satellite Precipitation Estimation
Precipitation is one of the most important variables for studying the hydrologic cycle and
for basic hydrologic studies in river basins. However, in many parts of the world, particularly
in remote places such as the oceans and the arctic regions where the accessibility is difﬁcult,
surface precipitation measurements are lacking. Likewise, in developing countries, precipi-
tation measurements based on the conventional rain gauges are insufﬁcient, and weather-
related radars may not even be available mainly because of the high cost of establishing and
maintaining the monitoring stations (e.g., [363–365]). Furthermore, for a variety of reasons
also in the developed world, there has been a trend of decreasing some of the existing
measurement network (e.g., [366]).
On the other hand, over the past decades, several satellite precipitation products (SPP) with
high spatial resolution (e.g., 1, 0.5, 0.25) and temporal scales such as 1 h, 3 h, daily, and
monthly have been developed. These products enable estimating precipitation over much of
the world (e.g., [364]). The use of satellites for this purpose already has several decades of
history starting with the launch of the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite by the United States in
1960. In addition, another type of meteorological satellite, the geostationary earth orbit
satellite (GEOS), was launched in 1974 by the United States. Since then, several similar
LEO and GEOS satellites were launched by several countries.

The sensors aboard the LEO satellites are for detecting the visible and infrared (IR) bands
of the spectrum and over time have been developed to include advanced very high-resolution
radiometers (AVHRR) and passive microwave (PMW) radiometers. And the Tropical Rain-
fall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite launched in 1997 further increased the PMW
capabilities along with active microwave precipitation radar (PR) capable of capturing
information on horizontal and vertical variability of rainfall. The various radiometers aboard
the LEO satellites have provided spatial resolution of 1 km and 6-h temporal sampling
[363]. Likewise the GEOS meteorological satellites carry aboard visible and IR sensors,
and the various satellites are capable of detecting the visible and IR radiation at a ﬁner
temporal resolution (a minimum of 3 h) although at a coarser spatial resolution of 4 km. The
combined precipitation information from multiple sensors and algorithms produces estimates
of precipitation over almost the entire globe. Thus, the SPP provide additional precipitation
data beyond what may be available from conventional surface-based equipment such as rain
gauges and radars.
TRMM satellite uses both active and passive microwave instruments for measuring
primarily heavy to moderate rainfall over tropical and subtropical regions of the world.
Building on the success of TRMM a Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, an
international network of satellites has been planned to provide the next generation of global
observations of rain and snow (http://pmm.nasa.gov/GPM). The advantage of GPM over
TRMM will be its capability of measuring light rain and snow. GPM will give global
measurements of precipitation with improved accuracy and temporal and spatial resolutions.
The GPM core observatory is scheduled to be launched in 2014.
Several SPP exist that may be useful for hydrologic applications such as the TRMM, Multi-
satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA, 367), NOAA-CPC morphing technique (CMORPH,
368), and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artiﬁcial Neural
Network (PERSIANN, 369). These products are available at a minimum of 3-h temporal scale
and spatial resolution of 0.25 latitude/longitude. These SPP generally combine data from
PMW and thermal IR sensors, and some also include surface rain gauge observations. The
main differences among them are the manner in which the individual data inputs are
combined. These differences may affect the accuracy of precipitation estimates over different
regions of the world [370]. Thus, a number of studies have been undertaken to validate and
compare them against precipitation data observed at surface rain gauges in various regions of
the world such as the United States (e.g., [368, 369, 371]), Africa (e.g., [372–375]), South
America [370, 376], and worldwide [367, 377]. For example, Dinku et al. [370] evaluated the
TMPA, CMORPH, PERSIANN, NRLB, and the GSMaP products at daily and 10-daily
temporal scales and spatial resolution of 0.25 latitude/longitude against surface precipitation
observed at 600 rain gauges in Colombia. Based on a number of validation techniques, the
authors concluded that the performance of the tested SPP are reasonably good for detecting
the occurrence of precipitation but are poor in estimating the amount of daily precipitation.
But the products have good skill at the 10-day time frame. Although the performances varied
over the various geographical regions in Colombia, the best performance was found for the
eastern region and that CMORPH and GSMaP gave the best results. In addition, assessments

95

of some SPP have been made against estimated ﬂood hydrographs (e.g., [365, 378]). For
example, the TMPA precipitation estimates were used in conjunction with the variable
inﬁltration capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to estimate streamﬂow hydrographs for the La
Plata basin (Argentina) for the period 1998–2006 [365]. A good agreement of the TMPA-
driven simulated seasonal and interannual variability of streamﬂows was obtained. Also the
timing of the daily ﬂood events and low ﬂows were reproduced well although the peak ﬂows
were overestimated.
Furthermore, evaluations of the uncertainty of satellite-based precipitation estimates and
the associated surface-based data obtained from rain gauges and radars have been made (e.g.,
[379, 380]), and a global map of uncertainties in satellite-based precipitation estimates has
been developed [381]. They used CMORPH, GSMaP, PERSIANN, 3B42, 3B42RT, and NRL
satellite precipitation products and estimated the ensemble mean and coefﬁcient of variation
(uncertainty) of precipitation over the globe. The ensemble mean reproduced the major
features of precipitation consistent with surface observations. The uncertainty among the
various estimates varied in the range 40–60 % over the oceans (especially in the tropics) and
over the lower latitude of South America. However, the uncertainty varied in the range
100–140 % over high latitudes (>40 in both hemispheres) especially during the cold season.
As expected, large uncertainties across the year were found over complex geographic regions
such as the Rocky Mountains, the Andes Mountains, and the Tibetan Plateau [381].
The applicability of some of the SPP is currently being studied in Peru. Figure 1.31 shows a
comparison of the seasonal precipitation obtained from surface rain gauges (observed) versus
the precipitation estimates obtained from TRMM3B42, CMORPH, and PERSIANN products
for seasons December–February (DJF, top) and June–August (JJA, down). One may observe
the complex precipitation distribution across the country for the two selected seasons. It
appears that PERSIANN more closely resembles the spatial variability of precipitation for the
DJF (summer) season, but for the JJA (winter) season, none of the SPP gives good results
particularly for the mideastern region where the precipitation may reach about 1,200 mm. The
referred comparison is simply graphical, but validation statistics will be determined to
identify the speciﬁc strengths and weaknesses of the different SPP (Lavado, personal
communication).
8.2. Spaceborne Methods for Estimating Surface Waters:
Rivers, Wetlands, and Lakes
While conventional systems for measuring surface and subsurface waters in river systems
are well established (Sect. 8.4), unfortunately in some remote regions of the world and
particularly in developing countries, ground-based measurements and estimations of
streamﬂows are insufﬁcient especially because of the high cost of establishing and
maintaining the gauging stations. In addition, there are some quite large river basins having
complex geomorphology and hydrodynamics with meanders and not well-deﬁned channels
where the conventional gauging procedures are inappropriate (e.g., [382]). The applications
of spaceborne remote sensing methods have opened newer possibilities for expanding the
coverage of surface water in the world.
96
J.D. Salas et al.

For example, one of the most promising new methods is based on the radar altimetry, which
has been used since the 1990s for measuring surface elevations in the oceans. The various
satellites having such devices include the ERS1 launched in 1991, TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P)
launched in 1992, the ICESat launched in 2003, and the satellites launched by Japan and
Europe (refer to 382 for details of available satellites and websites for measuring surface
waters). The satellites include the radar altimeters that have become useful for measuring
river surfaces particularly for large rivers and wetlands (a radar altimeter emits microwave
pulses to the surface and registers the travel time between the emitted pulse and the received
echo, which allows estimating the distance between the altimeter antenna and the water
surface).
Among the ﬁrst studies to apply satellite altimetry for measuring river level variations were
those by Cudlip [383], Guzkowska et al. [384], and Koblisnky et al. [385] with applications to
the Amazon River. The latter study was based on the Geosat altimeter, and the results showed
the potential of using altimeter data, but the Geosat radar did not give sufﬁcient accuracy or
coverage. On the other hand, Birkett [386] used the NASA radar altimeter (NRA) on board of
the T/P satellite and investigated their application for measuring surface water at large rivers
and wetlands in various places of the world. And the results obtained were quite good in terms
of accuracy and the capability of tracking the seasonal and interannual variations of the

Amazon River water levels. This initial application of the T/P altimetry was followed by other
studies by Birkett et al. [387] for studying the surface water dynamics in the Amazon Basin
using data of 7.5 years of the T/P and on a wider spatial scale across the Amazon Basin. The
results obtained demonstrated not only the capability of monitoring the variations of the water
surface height but also the water surface gradient. Also Coe and Birkett [388] extended the
previous studies to investigate the variations of Lake Chad levels using T/P altimetry in
conjunction with ground-based data to estimate not only lake levels but also river discharges
at a major tributary of Lake Chad basin. Thus, they were able to predict Lake Chad level
changes by observations of the changes at a station more than 600 km upstream. Additional
studies with applications to the Amazon River and the Rio Negro (a major tributary of the
Amazon) can be found in Zakharova et al. [389], Leon et al. [390], and Getirana et al. [391].
Alsdorf et al. [382] in reviewing the various applications of spaceborne sensors for
estimating surface water suggested that the advances made in remote sensing using satellites
have demonstrated that the elevation of the water surface (h), its slope (∂h/∂x), and its
temporal change ∂h/∂t can be estimated using the technology from spaceborne sensors.
They also discussed the limitations and challenges ahead for measuring velocity, bathymetry,
and other hydraulic/hydrologic properties. In fact, recently Ka¨a¨b and Prowse [392] have been
able to estimate the two-dimensional surface water velocity ﬁeld for the St. Lawrance and
MaKenzie rivers. Also recent applications of T/P altimetry have been made to forecast
transboundary river water elevations [393].
8.3. Spaceborne Methods for Estimating Soil Moisture, Evaporation,
Vegetation, Snow, Glaciers, and Groundwater
Microwave radiometers have been used for estimating soil moisture for the past several
decades, and such experience has been extended to using satellite-borne sensors. The interest
on this technology has been energized in this century with the launch of the Soil Moisture and
Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite by the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2008 and the
expected launching of NASA’s satellite in 2014 that will carry aboard Soil Moisture Active
Passive (SMAP) instruments. SMOS satellite carries a microwave radiometer that captures
images of “brightness temperature” that correspond to microwave radiation emitted from the
soil and ocean surfaces, which are then related to soil moisture held in the surface layer and
ocean salinity. Estimates of surface soil moisture can be made with an accuracy of about 4 %
(ESA website Dec. 2011) which is approximately twice the error of in situ electronic sensors.
Recently SMOS has been used to keep track the soil moisture levels in Europe during the
autumn of 2011, which has been very warm and dry. Likewise, the new SMAP satellite is
expected to provide soil moisture information on a global scale and should be useful for a
variety of applications in agriculture, weather forecasting, drought monitoring, and watershed
modeling and should be also helpful in global circulation modeling. A number of studies have
been made in developing the scientiﬁc and technical bases of spaceborne soil moisture
estimation and its applications (e.g., [394–402]).
Evaporation cannot be measured directly from spaceborne sensors, but it can be estimated
using the remote sensing data based on mathematical relationships that represent the soil and
98
J.D. Salas et al.

air exchanges of water and energy ﬂuxes. Estimates based on remote sensing data can be made
with different approaches such as direct methods using thermal infrared (TIR) sensors and
indirect methods using assimilation procedures combining different wavelengths to get
various input parameters. Some methods are based on the spatial variability present in remote
sensed images and no additional meteorological data to estimate evapotranspiration for
routine applications (e.g., Courault et al. [403]). Detailed reviews of the various methods
available for estimating evaporation using remote sensing have been made by several
investigators [403–411]. A comprehensive summary table of the various methods and vali-
dation results and sources is included in Kalma et al. [411].
Also the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection (ASTER) radiometer has
enabled the estimation of a number of surface ﬂuxes such as heat and water vapor. For
example, Ma et al. [412] suggested a method for deriving surface temperature, normalized
difference vegetation index (NDVI), modiﬁed soil-adjusted vegetation index, net radiation
ﬂux, soil heat ﬂux, and latent heat ﬂux based on ASTER images and tested it on an
experimental site located on the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that the derived
evaporation estimates based on ASTER were within 10 % of the corresponding ground
measurements. However, the vegetation-derived estimates were not validated because of
the lack of data in the study site. While the proposed method is still in development, the
results obtained have been encouraging.
Forest degradation has become a major concern in the past decades because of the
deterioration of the ecosystem, sustainable biodiversity, disruption of its natural functioning,
and the effects on the water cycle. In addition to the regular ﬁeld observations, the application
of remote sensing technology has become attractive for detecting forest degradation by
measuring differences in the biophysical/biochemical attributes of the canopy surfaces
between healthy and degraded forests [413]. Several vegetation-related indices have been
proposed for monitoring the state of vegetation using remote sensing techniques such as
NDVI [414]; the photochemical reﬂectance index [415]; the normalized difference water
index, NDWI [416]; the water index, WI [417]; the land surface water index, LSWI [418]; and
the land surface temperature, LST [419, 420]. For example, the WI and NDWI indices
correlate well with vegetation water concentration [417], and sparse or short vegetation
shows a higher LST value than dense or tall vegetation [419]. Matsushita et al. [413]
investigated the degree of forest degradation in Kochi, Japan, using Terra/ASTER satellite
sensors and concluded that the use of water content based (e.g., LSWI) and the pigment
content based (e.g., NDVI) obtained from satellite data were not effective for detecting forest
degradation in the study area, but in contrast the thermal IR bands of the Terra/ASTER data
were effective. However, the coarse spatial resolution of the satellite images still limits their
application and suggests that the use of higher resolution may have large potential in mapping
forest degradation [413].
In addition, various modeling tools have been suggested for mapping soil moisture, evapo-
transpiration, and moisture stresses based on thermal remote sensing data. For example,
Anderson et al. [421, 422] investigated using TIR remote sensing to monitor evapotranspiration
and moisture stress ﬁelds at continental scales based on improvements of the Atmosphere-Land
Introduction to Hydrology
99

Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model [423]. Also, mapping of evapotranspiration, moisture
stresses, and drought identiﬁcation at continental, regional, and local scales can be accomplished
by properly utilizing a suite of TIR sensors available from the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellites (GOES) and the Landsat series of satellites [424, 425]. By combining
a number of TIR images retrieved from instruments such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectrometer (MODIS) on board the Terra and Aqua satellites, AVHRR, and ASTER, and
models such as ALEXI (for coarser spatial scales) and DisALEXI (a disaggregation algorithm to
obtain a ﬁner spatial resolution), useful products for mapping evapotranspiration at the ~100-m
scale have been developed [424, 425].
Snowmelt and glacier melt are important sources of water for many parts of the world.
Snow cover, depth, and density can be estimated by satellite remote sensing. For example,
optical remote sensing of snow cover has been made since the 1970s using Landsat series of
sensors, and more recently NASA’s instrument MODIS on Terra (since 1999) and Aqua
(since 2002) satellites and NOAA’s Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System
(IMS) provide 500-m resolution snow cover products that are available at National Snow and
Ice Data Center (NSIDC, http://nsidc.org). Although differencing between snow and clouds is
still a concern (e.g., [426]), some validation studies (e.g., [427, 428]) suggest a good potential
for hydrologic applications. Likewise, glacier dynamics have been widely studied by airborne
and spaceborne sensors. Table 1 in Gao and Liu [429] gives details of remote sensors that may
be useful in glaciology. Both aerial photography and satellite images are used to map the areal
extent of glaciers and monitor their temporal evolution [429]. For example, Ka¨a¨b [430] used
ASTER and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data to estimate the glacier dynam-
ics at East Himalaya. The use of SRTM and SPOT satellite images have been also used for
mass balance studies of some glaciers in India [431].
In addition, passive and active microwave radiation have been useful for determining snow
extent, depth and density, and consequently snow water equivalent (SWE) (e.g., [432]). For
example, the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR) launched in 1978 has
been used for retrieving SWE at the global scale [433]. Microwave radiation is related to
various properties of the snow such as the number of snow grains and the packing of the grains
[434], so is a function of snow depth and density. SWE algorithms (e.g., simple linear
regression equations) have been developed using spaceborne microwave radiometer data
for both open spaces and areas with forest cover. However, high-resolution (~100-m scales)
SWE data are not available from current space systems, and radar technologies are being
developed to ﬁll such gap so that data retrieval will be able to capture the effects of
topographic features and variations of wind [435]. Several uncertainties are involved in
estimating SWE from space sensors. Dong et al. [433] examined satellite-derived SWE errors
associated with several factors such as snow pack mass, distance to signiﬁcant open-water
bodies, forest cover, and topographical factors using SMMR data. Also the use of data
assimilation for estimating snowpack properties based on Kalman ﬁlter has been suggested
[436]. Furthermore, it has been reported that signals transmitted from global positioning
system (GPS) satellites can be utilized for retrieving SWE [437].

Furthermore, spaceborne technology has been developed aimed at measuring (estimating)
the total amount of water in the earth system particularly the surface water (soil moisture and
snow) and the subsurface water (groundwater) based on the Gravity Recovery and Climate
Experiment (GRACE) satellites (e.g., [438–440]). The joint use of Global Land Data Assim-
ilation System (GLDAS) that gives estimates of surface waters and GRACE enables the
estimation of groundwater storage (NASA website, 2011). For example, these techniques
have been applied to estimate the variations of the total water storage for Texas river
basins that drain to the Gulf of Mexico, the Rio Grande, Arkansas, and Red rivers, and
California’s Central Valley systems. Also this technology has been applied to quantify the
current rates of groundwater depletion in northwestern India, in the Middle East, and in Africa
(e.g., [441, 442]) and has been included as an additional input to identify drought severity
(Drought Monitor website). Green et al. [443] reviewed additional applications and the
history of GRACE.
8.4. Advances in Measuring Large River Systems
Conventional methods for measuring and estimating surface waters are well known (e.g.,
[52, 444]). For estimating surface waters in streams, for example, hydrometric stations are
located at an appropriate cross section to register water levels (H) using recording or
non-recording gauges, which are then converted into water discharge (Q) by using appropriate
relationships between Q and H (rating curves). Such relationships are developed by measuring
stream water velocities and depths at a number of points across the stream cross section,
which allows estimating the water discharge. Likewise, the hydrometric station can be used to
measure sediment concentrations and other water quality parameters as the case may
be. Thus, hydrologic services of the countries worldwide generally have a network of
hydrometric gauging stations to make systematic observations to quantify the streamﬂow
variations through time.
However, for measuring streamﬂows and other properties such as sediment transport in
large river systems such as the Amazon River, such conventional methods are quite limited.
Thus, for the past decades, the interest on developing especial equipment and methods for
measuring large rivers has grown (e.g., [445–449]). In the 1990s, a number of studies were
made to improve measuring discharges of the Amazon River, and a joint effort of Brazilians
and French hydrologists introduced the Doppler technology with good results (e.g.,
[450, 451]). The study by Filizola and Guyot [452] describes the use of the Acoustic Doppler
Current Proﬁler (ADCP) for streamﬂow measurement in the Amazon at a gauging station near
Obidos, Brazil (the ADCP uses the Doppler effect by transmitting sound at a ﬁxed frequency
and receiving the echoes returning from sound scatters in the water). For example, they
reported that the water discharge and suspended sediment in March 24, 1995 were
172,400 m3/s and 3.15  106 Ton/day, respectively. Details of the equipment and methods
used for measuring and estimating the river discharge and suspended sediment can be found in
Filizola and Guyot [452]. More recently Laraque et al. [453] reported additional studies of
mixing processes at the conﬂuence of a major tributary of the Amazon River (near Manaus)
using also ADCP. Also the ADCP technology is being used for measuring river discharges

and suspended sediment in major rivers in the Andean countries (Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia).
Per illustration Fig. 1.32 shows personal of SENAMHI (Peru) and IRD (France) with ADCP
equipment for streamﬂow measurements in the Huallaga River, Peru.
8.5. Using Dendrohydrology for Extending Hydrologic Data
Dendrohydrology is the analysis and application of tree-ring records for hydrologic studies
[454]. Trees are useful for reconstructing streamﬂows because they are sensitive recorders of
natural climate variability. Tree-ring growth is affected by the same set of climatic factors
(e.g., precipitation and evapotranspiration) that affect streamﬂows [455]. Dendrohydrology
started in western North America primarily using ring-width time series to extend gauge
records of streamﬂows [456]. Tree-ring records have been used to extend the short records of
a number of hydrologic processes such as streamﬂows [457], precipitation [458], soil mois-
ture [459], and SWE [460]. An extensive review of dendrohydrology was made by Loaiciga
et al. [461]. The reconstructed streamﬂow records enable one observing a wider range of ﬂow
scenarios that may be obtainable from the historical records alone. For example, Woodhouse
[462] observed that the reconstructed streamﬂows of the Middle Boulder Creek showed that

the low-ﬂow events that occurred in the past were more persistent than those found from the
analysis of the historical records. Similar other studies of tree-ring reconstructed ﬂows
indicate that droughts of more severe magnitude and longer durations had occurred in the
past compared to droughts occurred during the historical period (e.g., [455, 457, 463–465]).
Several record extension models have been employed in literature to extend streamﬂow
records using tree-ring indices data. Among them is the traditional multiple linear regression
model (e.g., [457, 462, 466, 467]), principal component analysis (e.g., [457, 463, 467]), and
transfer function models (e.g., [468]). For example, Woodhouse [462] used multiple linear
regression models and the stepwise regression technique to select the tree-ring indices to be
used for reconstructing the streamﬂows of the Middle Boulder Creek, Colorado. Furthermore,
Tarawneh and Salas [464] developed a record extension technique, which is based on multiple
linear regression with noise and spatial disaggregation to reconstruct the annual streamﬂows
of the Colorado River for the entire 29 ﬂow sites.
8.6. Developments in Hydrologic Information Systems
Hydrologic information has been collected by many entities and national and international
organizations worldwide for a variety of purposes such as for evaluating water resources
availability in various regions and countries, for water resources developments in river basins,
for geo-environmental investigations in river basins, for detecting the effect of human inter-
ventions on hydro-environmental systems, and for studying the impact of climate variability
and change on the water resources and the environment of river basins. Several years ago, the
US National Science Foundation supported the creation of the Consortium of Universities for
the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences (CUAHSI) and also funded the Hydrologic Infor-
mation System (HIS) project for sharing hydrologic data. It will consist of databases that will
be integrated and connected through the Internet and web services for data ﬁnding, accessi-
bility, and publication [469–471]. An example is HydroServer, a computer server that includes
a collection of databases, web services, tools, and software applications that allows data
producers to store, publish, and manage from a project site (Tarboton et al. [471]). Current
efforts in various directions have been summarized in a CUAHSI Conference on Hydrologic
Data and Information Systems convened at Utah State University on June 22–24, 2011. For
example, a framework is currently being developed through which hydrologic and atmospheric
science data can be shared, managed, discovered, and distributed (e.g., [472]).

Abstract As a subdiscipline of water resources engineering, open-channel hydraulics is of
critical importance to human history. This chapter starts with a brief history of open-channel
hydraulics. Then the fundamental concepts in open-channel hydraulics (speciﬁc energy,
momentum, and resistance) are introduced. The new development on the subject of open-
channel ﬂow modeling is discussed at some length. A general introduction on 1D, 2D, and 3D
computer modeling and examples will be given. Despite the tremendous progress made in the
past, modern and future challenges include revisiting past projects which were designed using
less than ideal standards, effect of climate variability, and natural open channels in the arid
environment. The chapter concludes with a discussion of potential future directions.

1. INTRODUCTION
Open-channel hydraulics is a critical subdiscipline in the area of water resources engineer-
ing that has been practiced successfully throughout the settled parts of the world long before
recorded history. Functional systems of open channels, of course, also predate modern theory
and those modern essentials for design and analysis such as the computer.

An appropriate beginning of this very brief review of the importance of open channels in
prehistory and history is to quote Hunter Rouse [1] who wrote in 1957, “A major task in
dealing with modern times is. . .to separate the vast amount of chaff from the essential grain.”
The advent of the information age has only added validity to this statement. However, it is
worth brieﬂy reﬂecting on the essential role water resources engineering, in general, and open
channels, in speciﬁc, have played in human development. In c. 4000 BC, the Egyptians
dammed the Nile in the vicinity of Memphis (a short distance south of Cairo) in part to divert
ﬂood waters to prehistoric Lake Moeris which could store vast quantities of water for
irrigation. In c. 2300 BC the canal connecting the Nile and Lake Moeris was deepened and
widened to form what is now known as Bahr Yussef. The purposes of this open-channel-
reservoir system were to control the ﬂooding of the Nile, regulate the water level of the Nile
during dry seasons, and irrigate the surrounding area [1]. In c. 1800 BC, Egyptians also built a
canal connecting the Nile River and Red Sea. The existence of this canal was quoted by
Aristotle, Strabo, and Pliny the Elder. It should be observed that apparently the Red Sea then
tended further north then than it does today. The history of what today is known as the Middle
East is replete with systems of dams and open-channel systems that sustained agriculture and
allowed the development and growth of urban areas. Similar major systems also were
undertaken in China, India, and Pakistan.
Certainly the best known contribution of the Romans, from the viewpoint of open-channel
hydraulics, was the aqueduct. Throughout the Roman world, water was collected at springs
and/or wells and transmitted by open channels to urban areas where it was distributed to
consumers often by pressurized pipes. The Roman consumer was charged for the use of the
resource so the system could be sustained. Although it cannot be known with certainty,
Roman water resources engineers and their equally skilled predecessors likely had very little
theoretical knowledge. However, they knew a slight slope was required for water to ﬂow and
that water will not rise above its initial elevation without the addition of energy.
After the fall of the Roman Empire, the “Dark Ages” descended in the west during which
there was minimal recorded scientiﬁc and engineering progress. The Dark Ages were
followed by the Renaissance and the rise of observational science. It was during this period
that individuals of the stature of Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) made direct and critical
contributions to hydraulic engineering. Regarding Leonardo’s discussion of continuity in the
riverine environment Hunter Rouse said,
. . .he did it with such originality and clarity that the principle might justiﬁably bear his name. ([1], p. 49)
Following the major contributions of Newton to mechanics in the seventeenth century, Daniel
Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, and Jean le Rond d’Alembert made notable theoretical contribu-
tions in the ﬁeld of hydrodynamics, which are well known. During the same period, Antoine
Chezy and Robert Manning, as discussed in a subsequent section, made critical and lasting
contributions to open-channel hydraulics.
In what was to become the United States, the planning of major water resources projects
involving open channels began in Colonial times. In the eighteenth century, waterways were
the most efﬁcient means of transport and, hence, essential to commerce. In 1763, George
Washington suggested draining the Great Dismal Swamp and connecting Chesapeake Bay in
128
X. Liu

Virginia with Albemarle Sound in North Carolina by a canal obviating the need to transport
goods along the dangerous Carolina coast. In 1784, the Dismal Swamp Canal Company was
formed and work on the canal began in 1793. The canal was dug completely by hand since this
was before the age of steam power, and most of labor force was slaves. The 22 mile (35 km)
long canal ﬁnally opened in 1805, and the canal, operated by the US Army Corps of
Engineers, is still used.
Construction of the Erie Canal began on July 4, 1817, and the men who planned and
oversaw its construction (James Geddes, Benjamin Wright, Canvass White, and Nathan
Roberts to name just a few) were talented novices rather than trained civil engineers. Yet
these individuals planned, designed, and constructed a project that contained hydraulic
engineering structures that remain notable today such as the structure carrying the canal
over the Niagara Escarpment at Lockport, New York. The canal, 363 miles (584 km) long,
was completed in October 1826 without the beneﬁt of power equipment. Many of the laborers
on this project were newly arrived Scots-Irish immigrants. The canal was enlarged between
1834 and 1865 and was replaced by the New York State Barge Canal in 1918. It is pertinent to
observe that the Erie Canal resulted in the building of competing transportation systems
including the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad to name
just two.
The Dismal Swamp and Erie Canals are only the best known of the many canals built in
the United States in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries as they were the
interstate highways of the time. Agricultural and urban development west of the Rocky
Mountains in semiarid and arid environments required canals convey water from the moun-
tains where water is abundant to where it was needed for crops and people. Certainly one of
the best known American water resources projects of the twentieth century is Los Angeles
Aqueduct that conveys water by gravity from the Owens Valley in the Sierra Nevada
Mountains to Los Angeles. This project led to what are known as the California water
wars. Conceptually, the project began in 1898 when Frederick Eaton appointed William
Mulholland as head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The Los Angeles
envisioned by Eaton and Mulholland bore no relationship to the small coastal community it
was at the turn of the twentieth century. In the early 1900s, the Owens Valley was a rich
agricultural region with the needed irrigation water being provided by a number of small
irrigation districts rather than a large district as had been recommended by John Wesley
Powell. Eaton, Mulholland, and other Los Angeles visionaries (or scoundrels depending on
your viewpoint) recognized the opportunity that was available for the taking. By 1905, Los
Angeles using bribery, intimidation, subterfuge, and political inﬂuence up as high as Pres-
ident Theodore Roosevelt owned sufﬁcient land and water rights in the Valley to justify the
construction of the aqueduct.
From 1905 through 1913 Mulholland directed the construction of the 233 mile (375 km)
aqueduct. By 1920s so much water was being exported from the Owens Valley that “the
Switzerland of California” was becoming a desert, and the Valley residents took up armed
rebellion. The rebellion was for naught because by 1928 Los Angeles owned most of the water
in the Valley and only minimal agriculture was left. The reader is encouraged to consult refs.

[2, 3] for more details of this critical and controversial water resources project which was part
of the plot in the Academy Award winning movie Chinatown.
In 1970, Los Angeles completed a second aqueduct to export even more water from the
Valley. In response to various lawsuits, Los Angeles has put forth various plans to “rewater”
the lower Owens River and bar all future development on its holding in the Owens Valley.
Thus, the controversy over a simple gravity-driven system of open channels and pipes has
spanned a full century and will continue into the future.
By the beginning of the twentieth century, most of the critical analytic tools required to
design and build effective and fully operational open-channel systems for transportation and
water supply were available. One of the best known and respected engineers involved in early
twentieth-century open-channel hydraulics was Boris A. Bakhmeteff. Bakhmeteff was a civil
engineering educator and consultant in St. Petersburg, Russia, before he became the Kerensky
government’s ambassador to the United States. After the fall of the Kerensky government, he
remained in the United States. Bakhmeteff in 1912 published in Russian a book on open
channels and subsequently published a much enlarged version in English.
Many mark the beginning of modern open-channel hydraulics with the publication of
Bakhmeteff’s Hydraulics of Open Channel Flow. In the following sections of this chapter, the
fundamentals (speciﬁc energy, momentum, and resistance) are brieﬂy discussed, and then the
subject of modeling of open-channel ﬂow is discussed at some length. The chapter concludes
with a discussion of potential future directions.
1.1. Speciﬁc Energy
If the longitudinal slope of the channel is small, energy in an open channel is given by
H ¼ z þ y þ u2
2g
ð2:1Þ
where H ¼ total energy, z ¼ elevation of the channel bottom above a datum, y ¼ depth of
ﬂow, and u ¼ cross-sectional average velocity. It is pertinent to note the modiﬁcations
required if the slope is not small and development and use of the energy correction factor
as the ﬂow departs from being adequately described as one-dimensional. If the channel
bottom slope is less than 1:10 (5.75o), the pressure in the ﬂow is hydrostatic and corrections
to the computed depths of ﬂow are not required [4]. Channels with longitudinal slopes greater
than 1:10 are rare, but the engineer needs to be aware that when modeling such channels the
estimated depth may require adjustment [4].
As ﬂow cross sections depart from simple geometric shapes such as rectangular and
trapezoidal to include overbank ﬂow areas, average velocity becomes less valid as a descrip-
tor of the kinetic energy of the ﬂow. The kinetic energy correction factor (also known as the
velocity weighting coefﬁcient) is intended to allow the one-dimensional energy equation to be
used in situations that depart from being one-dimensional. Setting the actual kinetic energy of
a ﬂow equal to the kinetic energy of the one-dimensional idealization

or

With regard to α and β, the following observations are pertinent. First, for uniform ﬂow,
α ¼ β ¼ 1. Second, for a given channel section and velocity distribution, α is more sensitive
to variations in velocity than β. Third, as noted previously, α and β are of importance when the
channel consists of a primary channel and sub-channels and/or berms and ﬂoodplains. In such
cases judgment must be used to decide if two-dimensional modeling should be used.
By deﬁnition, speciﬁc energy is
E ¼ y þ u2

And for a rectangular channel of width b and a ﬂow per unit width q, the speciﬁc energy
equation becomes

It is also noted the equation has valid solutions in the ﬁrst and third quadrants with only
those in the ﬁrst quadrant being of practical interest. Figure 2.1 is a plot of y vs. E for a ﬂow of
14 m3/s in a rectangular with a bottom width of 3 m. With regard to this ﬁgure, the following
observations are pertinent. First, Pt. B is the only point where for a given value of E, there is a
single depth of ﬂow. At Pt. B the depth of ﬂow is critical and the Froude number has a value of
1. Second, depths and velocities of ﬂow associated with branch “BA” are subcritical, Froude
number less than 1. Third, depths and velocities of ﬂow associated with branch “BC” are
supercritical, Froude number greater than 1. Fourth, for a given ﬂow rate, there is a different
E  y for each channel width, see Fig. 2.2. Fifth, from a design viewpoint, ﬂows that are
either strongly sub- or supercritical are desirable because near the critical point a change in
ﬂow regime can lead to a large change in depth.
Speciﬁc energy provides the basis for estimating the variation of channel shape and
longitudinal slope on the depth of ﬂow. Taking the derivative of (2.1) with respect to

1.2. Speciﬁc Momentum (Speciﬁc Force)
In considering the application of Newton’s second law of motion to steady open-channel
ﬂow, it is convenient to deﬁne speciﬁc momentum (speciﬁc force) or
Mi ¼ zi Ai þ Q2
gAi
where i ¼ section identiﬁcation, zi ¼ distance to the centroid of ﬂow area A, and Q ¼ ﬂow
rate. Then for a control volume where Station 1 is upstream and Station 2 downstream,
Newton’s second law can be written as

where F ¼ unknown force or forces acting in the control volume. At this point, three

For simplicity, the following discussion will be limited to results for rectangular channels.
The widest used results of speciﬁc momentum analysis are the results for hydraulic jumps.
The applications of hydraulic jumps in open-channel hydraulics are many and include:
Dissipation of energy in ﬂows over dams, weirs, and other hydraulic structures;
Maintenance of high water levels in channels for water distribution;
Increase the discharge of a sluice gate by repelling the downstream tailwater;
Reduction of the uplift pressure under a structure by raising the water depth on the apron;
Hydraulic mixing of chemicals for water puriﬁcation or treatment; and
Aeration and dechlorination of ﬂows.

where y1 and y2 ¼ depths of ﬂow at upstream Station 1 and downstream Station 2, respec-
tively, and F1 ¼ Froude number at Station 1. The sequent depth equation is often interpreted
in a much too simple fashion; that is, if the supercritical conditions of ﬂow at Station 1 are as
described by y1 and F1, then the depth of ﬂow after the hydraulic jump will be y2 tacitly
assuming a hydraulic jump occurs. In point of fact, a hydraulic jump will not occur unless the
engineer causes depth y2 to exist. Controlling the location of a hydraulic jump is a critical
engineering and often requires the use of hydraulic structures such as the US Bureau of
Reclamation Type III stilling basin shown in Fig. 2.3. Guidance regarding the design of
stilling basins is available in agency design manuals (e.g., [5]) and standard engineering
handbooks (e.g., [6]).
1.3. Resistance
From the viewpoint of water resources engineering and open-channel hydraulics, the latter
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were an age of achievement yielding fundamental

equations produced by men whose names are familiar to every hydraulic engineer—in
particular, Chezy and Manning.
Antoine Chezy was born in 1718 at Chalon-sur-Marne, France, and died in 1797. In 1760,
the City of Paris was experiencing a water supply problem apparently related to the poor
operation of its pumps. Seeking a solution, the City approached the Academie des Sciences
which recommended, among other alternatives, water be brought to the City by a gravity
canal from the nearby Yvette River. In 1768, the City moved forward, and Chezy was tasked
to design the cross section of the canal and determine its discharge. As would be today, this
was a critical engineering task since if the section was too small, the water required would not
be delivered, and if it was too large, the right of way required would be too large. Public works
projects then had critics, just as they do today. Chezy’s review of the literature apparently
found nothing that adequately addressed the issue; and therefore, he initiated his own
investigation. It is relevant to note that there had been discussions regarding the relationship
between the velocity and slope and the effect of the bed on velocity [1]. The report containing
his recommendations was lost, but the ﬁles of the agency, Ponts et Chaussees, contain the
original manuscript [1] and it is there that the Chezy Equation is put forward. The ﬁnal report
on the Yvette Project only contained the results of Chezy’s computations and made no
mention of the method used.
It is appropriate to mention that the French Revolution halted the Yvette River project.
Chezy’s simple, elegant approach to calculating uniform ﬂow went unrecognized by his peers,
and Chezy himself would have died in poverty except for the intercession of one of his
students, Baron Riche de Prony which led to Chezy’s appointment as the director of the Ecole
Ponts et Chaussees. According to refs. [1, 7], the Chezy Equation was not widely used until it
was published at the end of the nineteenth century by the well-known American hydraulic
engineer Clemens Herschel [8]. However, Herschel seems to contradict this stating “. . .called
the Chezy formula and well known in the engineering literature of Germany, France, England,
and the United States.”
Robert Manning was born in Normandy, France, the year following Waterloo, 1816, and
died in 1897. In 1889, Manning, a professor at the Royal College of Dublin (Ireland) and chief
engineer of the Ofﬁce of Public Works responsible for various drainage, inland navigation,
and harbor projects, presented a paper entitled “On the Flow of Water in Open Channels and
Pipes” to the Institution of Civil Engineers in Ireland; and in this paper, the Manning equation
was presented which Manning believed corrected defects in previous resistance models. It is
pertinent to note that Manning was a self-taught hydraulic engineer with no formal training in
engineering. Manning was apparently not aware that a French engineer, Philippe Gaspard
Gauckler, had put forward essentially the same model in c. 1868 [7]. The popularity and
widespread use of the Manning resistance formulation has been ascribed to its publication in a
popular late nineteenth-century textbook by Flamant [7, 9].
The Manning Equation has always had its detractors, but none was any more critical than
Robert Manning himself. According to [1], Manning had the following in his original paper:
. . .if modern formulae are empirical with scarcely an exception, and are not homogeneous, or even dimensional,
then it is obvious that the truth of any such equation must altogether depend on that of the observations themselves,
and it cannot in strictness be applied to a single case outside them.
136
X. Liu

Thus, Manning was quite aware of the limitations of his formulation which was in better
agreement with data available than any other approach. Manning’s second objection to his
formulation was the need to extract a cubic root which was not easily done before the
electronic age. In fact, Fischenich [10] pointed to the publication of King’s Handbook [11]
in 1918 with tabulation of the two-thirds power of numbers between 0.01 and 10 to ﬁrmly
establishing the Manning resistance model preferred approach in American engineering
practice.
It is pertinent to observe that Manning then abandoned the approach that bears his name
and developed a dimensionally homogeneous equation which was apparently never widely
used [1].
1.4. Rise of the Computer
The effort and time required to correctly plan, analyze, and design complex systems of
open channels prior to the advent and widespread availability of digital computers was
staggering. Given the scale, scope, and success of the projects discussed in the introduction,
the resourcefulness and ingenuity of those involved in those projects must be recognized.
Certainly, the most notable and signiﬁcant advances in open-channel hydraulics since the
1960s have been due to the widespread availability of relatively inexpensive and increasing
powerful computers and software. The models discussed in the next section, and the insights
they provide for effective analysis and design of open channels would not be possible without
the modern computer. However, these computational advances have also been accompanied
by concerns, and two of the most notable are the following. First, other than knowing the
effect of gravity on water, many modern hydraulic engineers have no inherent understanding
of ﬂow in open channels. That is, for these engineers, critical physical processes have been
reduced to abstract algorithms, and they have no basis for judging the reasonableness of the
digital output. Second, many modern engineers are unable to effectively function without
sophisticated calculators and computers. Thus, as is the case with any signiﬁcant technical
leap forward, there are unanticipated problems that must be addressed.
2. NUMERICAL MODELING OF OPEN-CHANNEL HYDRAULICS
2.1. Review of Numerical Modeling of Open-Channel Flows
With the widespread availability of powerful personal computers and the development of
high-performance computers (HPC), numerical models for hydraulic engineering have gained
popularity during the last several decades. This popularity is also propelled by the develop-
ment of new numerical methods and efﬁcient numerical schemes where hydraulic phenomena
and processes with more complexity can be modeled. Along with theoretical and experimen-
tal research, computational models have grown to an important branch of hydraulics.
Numerical modeling of open channels has progressed from the original one-dimensional
open-channel ﬂow equations to three-dimensional free surface ﬂows. The following is a brief
overview of the achievements in the computer modeling of open-channel ﬂow.

To perform numerical modeling for open-channel ﬂows, as well as in other areas of ﬂuid
mechanics, the basic process includes preprocessing, computation, and post-processing. At
the preprocessing stage, the majority of the work is to prepare the data in the format required
by the speciﬁc numerical code. In the case of three-dimensional modeling, the preprocessing
stage can be a major portion of the whole process. One of the difﬁculties during this stage is to
generate a reasonable mesh that represents the domain of interest and has a good quality. Most
of the commercial codes have their own preprocessing and mesh generation tools. There are
also some independent meshing tools available which specialize in making high-quality
meshes and are easy to use. Since there are many numerical models and each employs
different numerical schemes, they require different mesh formats and vary on the tolerance
on mesh quality; it is impossible to list each of them. Readers should refer to the documen-
tations of these codes. One general suggestion is to make a mesh with good quality and at
affordable resolution.
Depending on the dimensionality of the numerical models for open-channel ﬂows, they can
be classiﬁed into different categories, i.e., one-, two-, and three-dimensional models. Exam-
ples include the HEC series of pseudo-1D models, FESWMS-2DH from Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), and open-source HydroSed2D based on 2D depth-averaged shal-
low-water equations. The examples of fully three-dimensional computational ﬂuid dynamics
(CFD) models include commercial codes such as Fluent, Flow3D, Phoenics, CD-adapco, and
the popular OpenFOAM from the open-source community.
Despite the variety and availability of different computer codes, there still exist challenges,
as well as opportunities, for the numerical modeling of open-channel ﬂows: (1) uncertainties
in input data such as bathymetry, resistance law and roughness, vegetation, and ﬂow mea-
surement data; (2) computational domain and temporal span are large, which dictates that
computational demand is high, especially for 3D modeling; (3) multiple scales needs to be
resolved (in open-channel ﬂow, it is often required or at least desirable to capture the global
mean ﬂow and the local variations); and (4) model calibration needs extensive data which are
not always available.
In the following, numerical models (1D, 2D, and 3D) and their example applications are
introduced. Depending on the physical scales, each category of models has its applications.
For large-scale (such as river reach) modeling, 1D and 2D modes may be the right choice
since they are faster and require less data input and yet reveal the overall hydraulic behavior.
For localized, small-scale ﬂow phenomenon, such as open-channel ﬂow around hydraulic
structures, ﬂow over bedforms, and sediment elements, a fully 3D model is necessary and
affordable.
2.2. One-Dimensional Modeling of Open-Channel Flows
2.2.1. Governing Equations for One-Dimensional Open-Channel Flow
The general equations for unsteady nonuniform open-channel ﬂows are the Saint-Venant
equations or the dynamic wave equations. The derivation of the Saint-Venant equations is
based on the shallow-water approximation where the vertical pressure distribution is hydro-
static and the vertical acceleration is small. It is also assumed that the channel bottom slope is
138
X. Liu

small such that S ¼ sin θ, where θ is the angle of the channel bed relative to the horizontal. It
is also important to note that the resistance law used for the unsteady ﬂow is assumed to be the
same for steady ﬂow; and therefore, the Manning and Chezy equations can be used.
The continuity equation which describes the water mass balance has the form
∂A
∂t þ ∂Q
∂x  ql ¼ 0
ð2:13Þ
and the momentum equation which describes the force balance of a control volume has the
form
∂Q
∂t þ ∂
∂x QV
ð
Þ ¼ gA S0  Sf
ð
Þ
ð2:14Þ
where A is the cross-sectional area of the ﬂow which depends of the geometry of the channel
cross section and the ﬂow depth, V is the average velocity perpendicular to the cross section,
and Q ¼ AV is the ﬂow rate. q1 in the continuity equations is the lateral inﬂow rate per unit
channel length. In the momentum equations, S0 ¼  ∂z/∂x is the water surface slope and z is
the free surface elevation. Sf is the friction slope which is a function of ﬂow and stage. The
friction slope is determined by the resistance equation, such as Manning and Chezy equations.
In derivation of (2.14), it is assumed the momentum associated with the lateral inﬂow can be
neglected.
2.2.2. Numerical Solutions
Due to its simplicity and one dimensionality, the ﬁnite-difference method can be used to
approximate the derivatives (both spatial and temporal) in the Saint-Venant equations. The
spatial discretization for derivatives and source terms can be evaluated at the beginning of a
time step (explicit) or the end of a time step (implicit). Different temporal discretization
schemes can be used on different terms in the governing equations giving the mixed explicit-
implicit formulations. The second mostly used scheme for the derivatives is the so-called
method of characteristics (MOC) where the derivatives are calculated along the characteristic
grid lines. The governing equations, which are partial differential equations (PDEs), need to
be transformed along the characteristic curves [11]. The transformed equations are ordinary
differential equations (ODE) which are readily solved. Once the ODEs are solved, the
solution to the original PDEs for the 1D unsteady ﬂow equations can be obtained. MOC is
used in special cases where the transient is important, for example, dam-break ﬂows. Since the
governing equations are PDEs in general, other discretization schemes (such as ﬁnite element,
ﬁnite volume, and spectral methods) could also be used. However, they are not used as often
as the ﬁnite-difference method and MOC.
Instead of solving the full continuity and momentum equations, simpliﬁed versions can be
solved without losing the dominant mechanisms. In the simpliﬁed versions, some of the terms
have been omitted from the full equations or one of the equations is not used. When only the
continuity equation is used (with the momentum equation ignored), it is called hydrologic

139

routing. When both equations are solved, it is called hydraulic routing [12]. In hydraulic
routing, there are three sub-routing schemes, i.e., kinematic, diffusion, and dynamic routings.
The kinematic routing considers only the balance between gravity and ﬂow resistance, and
diffusion routing ignores the inertia terms (temporal and convective accelerations). The
dynamic routing includes all terms. When applying these different routing schemes, it is
important to keep in mind the assumption that the neglected terms are relatively small
comparing to others. If this assumption is not satisﬁed, the results will not capture the physical
process.
To fully describe the details of ﬁnite difference and the MOC that needs a lengthy
derivation, interested readers could consult references which are devoted to this topic.
There are many commercial and public domain codes available for the simulation of 1D
open-channel ﬂows which implement the various numerical schemes mentioned before. One
of the most widely used models is HEC-RAS [4], which uses the ﬁnite-difference method. It
has three basic hydraulic analysis components which comprise steady ﬂow computations,
unsteady ﬂow computations, and movable boundary sediment transport computations. The
software integrates the graphical user interface (GUI) with the three components as well as the
data management system to facilitate the ease of use.
2.2.3. Examples
Due to its simplicity and efﬁciency, 1D open-channel ﬂow models have been used widely
for engineering design and ﬂood risk analysis. The most popular 1D model, HEC-RAS, has
been used by the industry and government agencies for open-channel design. The typical
outputs of the model would be river stage, ﬂow, and resistance (Figs. 2.5 and 2.6).
In ﬂood prediction and mapping, it is very convenient to combine the hydraulic model
results with geographic information system (GIS). For example, in [14], HEC-RAS model
was integrated in GIS to predict the areal coverage of the ﬂood over real terrains. It used high-
resolution elevation data in the stream and the relatively low-resolution data in the ﬂoodplain.
The resulting model was used for the Waller Creek in Austin, Texas.
2.3. Two-Dimensional Modeling of Open-Channel Flows
Two-dimensional modeling of open-channel ﬂows usually uses the depth-averaged shal-
low-water equations (SWEs) where the vertical acceleration of the ﬂuid is ignored. The
governing equations for the one-dimensional modeling in the previous section can be viewed
as a special case of SWEs where one spatial derivative vanishes. Both 1D and 2D modeling
equations belong to the broad category of hyperbolic partial differential equations which has a
natural connection with conservation laws.
It is noted that there are also two-dimensional models with one dimension being the vertical
and the other one being along the river. This modeling methodology is applicable when the
variation across the river is small and the emphasis is to model the vertical motion and
transport. Although equaly important, this vertical 2D modeling will not be introduced and
this section will only treat two-dimensional depth-averaged modeling using shallow-water
equations.
140
X. Liu

As for general partial differential equations, numerical schemes (such as ﬁnite difference,
ﬁnite volume, ﬁnite element methods) have been used to discretize the governing equations
(e.g., [15–19]). Finite volume and ﬁnite element methods are more popular in solving SWEs
since they use unstructured mesh which is ideal for complex domains. On the other hand,
regular two-dimensional Cartesian grid can be used to model rectangular domains or the

governing equations can be transformed into curvilinear orthogonal coordinate systems for
irregular domains (e.g., [20]). Other noval techniques for the meshing and representation of
the computational domain have been proposed and successfully used. For example, an
adaptive quadtree meshing and modeling method was proposed in [21] where any
two-dimensional boundary topology can be approximated with the capability of enriching
and coarsening dynamically.
Available codes for two-dimensional depth-averaged modeling include TELEMAC [22],
TUFLOW [23], and HydroSed2D [18]. For the purpose of illustration, in the following, the
shallow-water equations will be introduced and the ﬁnite volume method used for
discretization will be elaborated. The scheme is exactly the one used in HydroSed2D and is
similar to the ones used by others.

2.3.2. Numerical Schemes
The Godunov scheme is used to solve the conservative variables as deﬁned in the previous
section [24]. The basic idea of Godunov scheme is to assume the piecewise constant
distribution of these conservative variables over each mesh cell and the time evolution is
achieved by solving the Riemann problem at the cell–cell interfaces [25]. To improve the
accuracy, the piecewise constant distribution can be replaced by high-order interpolations
leading to higher spatial accuracy. Higher order schemes are important to capture transcritical
ﬂows and discontinuities such as dam-break/levee-breach ﬂows.
Using Green’s theorem, the divergence term of (2.20) can be transformed into line integral
and the vector form of the governing equations becomes

This Jacobian matrix has three distinct real eigenvalues. The eigenvalues can be derived
analytically. The source term due to the bed slope is dealt with via a revised divergent form
method. It has been proved that this method will give physical results even for steady state
over complex terrain.
2.3.3. Examples
In this section, an example is shown to demonstrate the application of 2D models. This
example is the St. Clair River sediment mobility study [19]. Corresponding 3D modeling has
also been done to investigate the local ﬂow ﬁeld and will be introduced in the next section. In
the context of this section, only 2D simulation results will be shown.
The St. Clair River is the connecting channel between Lake Michigan-Huron and the
downstream Lake St. Clair (Fig. 2.7a, b). Despite the small recovery in year 2009, the head
difference between the Michigan-Huron system and Lake Erie has declined by about 0.6 m
between 1860 and 2006, with 0.23 m occurring between 1963 and 2006. The level of Lake
Erie has remained relatively constant. Among many other hypotheses, the erosion in the
St. Clair River and the increased conveyance have been postulated as one of the reasons for
the dropping of the water level in Lake Michigan-Huron.
An open-source numerical code, HydroSed2D, was applied to the St. Clair River through
the reach. HydroSed2D is a two-dimensional depth-averaged code that provided detailed
144
X. Liu

hydrodynamic predictions (i.e., ﬂow velocity and depth) within the channel [18]. These
predictions were then used to calculate sediment transport rates and analyze armoring effects
using surface-based gravel bed transport equations based upon the Acronym routine [27]. The
boundary conditions of the model were based upon detailed ﬁeld measurements that were
conducted on July 21–25, 2008, and combined a multi-beam echo sounder (MBES) bathy-
metric survey (Fig. 2.7c) and Acoustic Doppler Current Proﬁler (ADCP) ﬂow velocity
surveys [28]. The numerical ﬂow model was also calibrated and validated using these ﬁeld
measurements. The sediment characteristics within the reach (such as size and composition)
were obtained through underwater video/image analysis. The bottom shear stresses predicted
by HydroSed2D and these sediment size distributions were then subsequently used as an input

to Acronym. This section demonstrates the integrated modeling approach and presents the
results of the analysis, including the distribution of bed shear within the channel, and its
implications for the changing water conveyance and lake levels of Lake Michigan-Huron.
All numerical models need extensive calibration before being applied to produce creditable
results. In this example, the roughness along the river bottom was chosen as one of the
calibration parameters. Due to its importance of hydraulic resistance, many other studies have
also used it as the calibration parameter. Some researchers lump the hydraulic resistance into
one representative value for the whole domain. However, due to the change of the bed
material from upstream to downstream in the St. Clair River, the whole river reach was
divided into several subdomains and each of them with a different roughness. The initial
estimation of these roughness values are derived from the mean bed material sizes. Different
combination of the roughness values for each subdomain constitutes the roughness calibration
sets. To cover a wide range of hydraulic conditions, three representative discharges (low,
medium, and high) were chosen as the inﬂow into the river. The simulation results for river
stages were compared with the measured results and the best set of roughness were chosen as
the calibration result. In Fig. 2.8, the river stages along the St. Clair River with the calibrated
roughness are plotted against the measurement. It is clear that the calibrated model can
capture the overall hydraulics of the river.
The 2D simulation results were also compared with the ADCP measurement around the
ﬁrst two bends of the river inlet from Lake Huron. In Fig. 2.9, the depth-averaged velocity
vectors along several river cross sections are plotted against those from the measurement. The
ﬂow discharges during the ﬁeld measurement and for the simulation are similar. This
comparison reveals that the numerical model captured most of the important ﬂow features,

including the ﬂow constriction and acceleration near the Lake Huron inlet area into the upper
river channel and the subsequent large recirculation zone, which extends across approxi-
mately a third of the channel width, at the ﬁrst bend downstream of the constriction. Any
morphological change is probably most active within this region, particularly as the down-
stream ﬂow velocity is accelerated to its maximum within the channel by the inﬂuence of both
the width constriction and the recirculation zone.
For the purpose of this study, the shear stress exerted on the bed by the ﬂow is the driving
force of the sediment motion and is an important parameter to investigate the possible erosion
in the river. As a typical ﬂow condition, the case which corresponds to the 50 % exceedance
discharge in the ﬂow duration curve is shown in Fig. 2.10. Higher shear stresses are only
observed in the St. Clair River channel, with the velocity and shear stresses declining on entry
to Lake St. Clair. In the St. Clair River, the highest shear stresses are located in the upper river
channel close to Lake Huron outlet. In this area, the bed shear stresses are predicted at about
8–10 Pa. Based upon Shields diagram, this value of shear stress is not capable of moving
sediment coarser than 20 mm diameter. However, the shear stresses are high enough to
transport ﬁner sediment, with likely deposition in the lee of the ﬁrst bend of the upper
channel, where there are a large outer bank scour and two large lobate bars with shear stresses
below 5 Pa through this zone. At this lower value of shear stress, the ﬂow is only able to move
sediment ﬁner than 10 mm. The two bars might be historical features from initial water scour.
They could still be evolving because of the episodic high shear stresses events such as ship
passages and ice jam breakups.

The shear stress distributions corresponding to 0, 50, and 100 % exceedance discharges
along the center line of the river (Fig. 2.10c) show that the bed shear stresses decrease
downstream from peaks near the Lake Huron outlet, at the location of constriction. However,
it is notable that, in general, the bed shear stresses along most of the length of the river are
globally low, ranging in mean values from 1 to 3 Pa. It is concluded from the 2D numerical
simulation results that the St. Clair River itself can not cause enough erosion to dramatically
change the conveyance of the river. Other factors, such as navigation and dredging activities,
may play a more important role.
2.4. Three-Dimensional CFD Modeling of Open-Channel Flows
2.4.1. Governing Equations of 3D Navier–Stokes Equations
To do fully three-dimensional modeling of open-channel ﬂows, there are several questions
need to be answered regarding to the important physical processes involved.
The ﬁrst question is the turbulence. Since the Reynolds number, which is a dimensionless
number measuring the ratio between the inertial and viscous force, is usually very high due to
the large spatial scales in open channels, the ﬂow is dominated by inertial force and turbulent.
To directly resolve all the scales in the turbulent ﬂow without modeling is a tremendous
challenge and is only possible for relatively moderate Reynolds numbers and simple geom-
etries. Instead, the governing equations are usually averaged/ﬁltered over time and/or space.
Most numerical methods used to solve the averaged/ﬁltered equations can only resolve the
turbulence up to the scales comparable to the mesh size. Turbulence models are needed to
represent the scales which are not resolved. Interested readers could refer to the abundant
literatures on this topic, for example, [29–31], among many others.
The second question is the modeling of the free surface in the open channel. For open-
channel ﬂows, either the traditional river ﬂows, coastal ﬂows, or the ﬂows through hydraulic
structures, part of the ﬂow boundary directly contacts with the atmosphere and is free to move.
Under some circumstances, the whole domain occupied by the water and air could be conﬁned
in a limited space, for example, partially ﬁlled sewage pipe ﬂows where air, though com-
pressible, could retard the free motion of the water surface. In any case, the interface between
water and air evolves with time and is part of the solution. The resolution of the free surface
introduces extra computational complexity into the problem [32], although mature numerical
schemes are available to track or capture the free surface, such as volume of ﬂuid (VOF, [33])
and level set method (LSM, [34]). In practice, unless absolutely necessary, free water surface
is usually replaced by a rigid lid where the surface is replaced by a shear-free boundary. This
is a good approximation when the free surface does not change dramatically. For rapidly
changing water surface (e.g., waves and hydraulic jumps), the rigid lid approximation will
introduce errors and should not be used.
Based on the speciﬁc problem to be solved, the best strategy is to identify the most
important ﬂuid dynamics processes and choose the modeling approach accordingly. The
aim is to reduce the unnecessary computational demand while capturing the physical phe-
nomenon. In the following part of this section, the governing equations with the most
commonly used turbulence model will be introduced. And then the numerical methods and
Open-Channel Hydraulics: From Then to Now and Beyond
149

codes available will be brieﬂy described. At the end of this section, examples of 3D CFD
modeling of the open-channel ﬂows will be shown.
To be general, we assume the resolution of the free surface is important and use the VOF
method as an example. In the VOF method, a scalar transport equation is solved as an
indicator for the water and air where a value of 1 represents water and 0 represents air. If
the free surface is not as important, the VOF scheme could be easily turned off by not solving
the scalar transport equation and ﬁll the whole domain by a value of 1. The interface between
water and air could be replaced by a rigid lid. The governing equations for the ﬂuid are the
Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations:

where k is turbulence kinetic energy and ε is turbulence energy dissipation rate and σk and σε
are the Schmidt numbers. The constants appear in (2.20)–(2.22) take the values of Cμ ¼ 0.09,
C1 ¼ 1.44, and C2 ¼ 1.92 [35]. The Schmidt numbers have the values of σk ¼ 1.0 and
σε ¼ 1.0. More turbulence models can be found in the literature.
2.4.2. Numerical Solutions and Available Codes
The partial differential equations (PDEs) of the 3D CFD models can be solved using any
numerical schemes (e.g., ﬁnite-difference, ﬁnite element, and ﬁnite volume methods) intro-
duced in the previous sections. Whatever the schemes chosen, the PDEs are discretized and
the physical variables (velocity, pressure, etc.) are solved at ﬁnite number of grid points. As
mentioned in the introduction, in general, the process includes preprocessing, simulation, and
post-processing. A very important step in the preprocessing stage is to prepare a good quality
mesh which can determine the overall quality of simulation results and sometimes even the
success or failure of the simulation.
There are a number of commercially available programs such as Fluent, Flow3D, Phoenics,
and CD-adapco which are used widely in practice because of their ease of use and good
support. In recent years, with the growth of the open-source movement (from operating
systems to applications), several CFD codes are released under various open-source license
agreements. Instead of compiled binary executables as is the case with most of the commer-
cial codes, the whole source code is available. This is very appealing to people who wish to
have the freedom to modify the code according to his or her particular application. The
drawback of open-source CFD codes is that the learning curve is steep and it needs more
background and experience in computer programming.
One of the popular open-source CFD code is OpenFOAM [36], which has been used
extensively by the author for various applications. OpenFOAM is primarily designed for
problems in continuum mechanics. It uses the tensorial approach and object-oriented tech-
niques [37]. OpenFOAM provides a fundamental platform to write new solvers for different
problems as long as the problem can be written in tensorial partial differential equation form.
It comes with a large number of turbulence models for both incompressible and compressible
ﬂuids. The core of this code is the ﬁnite volume discretization of the governing equations.
Differential operators in a partial differential equation, such as temporal derivative, diver-
gence, Laplacian operator, and curl, can be discretized in the code. A numerical solver which
solves the partial differential equations can be written at high programming level with great
efﬁciency. Researchers and engineers can be liberated from the burden of tedious coding and
focus on the physical problem. In the next section, an example of 3D CFD simulation using
OpenFOAM will be introduced.
2.4.3. Examples
Three-dimensional computational models have been used in many applications involving
almost all aspects of traditional and emerging open-channel hydraulics problems. Some of the
examples include secondary ﬂows in meandering channels, turbulent coherent structures over
complex bed forms and rough elements such as gravels, and free surface ﬂow through/around

151

hydraulic structures such as spillways and ﬁsh passages. If the channel is built with a mobile
bed, sediment transport and channel evolution can also be modeled together with the ﬂuid
ﬂows. In this section, an example will be shown to demonstrate the application of three-
dimensional numerical modeling of open-channel ﬂows. This example is the 3D sediment
mobility analysis in the St. Clair River, whose 2D analysis has been introduced in the previous
section.
As we have seen in the previous section of 2D depth-averaged models, St. Clair River was
modeled using ﬁnite volume shallow-water equations. To further understand the hydraulics of
the river, especially at the river inlet from Lake Huron where it could be most active
morphologically, 3D CFD simulation was performed. The 3D simulation results could also
be used to cross-check the 2D model.
Due to the limitation of computational resource, only the Lake Huron inlet area and the ﬁrst
two bends are modeled in the 3D simulations. The bathymetry is from the multi-beam scan
and the 3D view of the 2008 bathymetry is show in Fig. 2.7. The domain is about 8 km long
and it has a mesh of about 1.5 million cells. The turbulence is modeled by the k-ε model.
Although surface waves in the lake inlet area present, the river surface elevations of the
majority of the domain only changes slightly. Thus, a rigid lid is placed on the top of domain.
It takes more than 24 h for the model to reach steady state in an eight nodes computer cluster.
The ﬂow pattern from the 3D model is shown in Fig. 2.11. The stream traces in Fig. 2.11a, b
help visualize the ﬂow ﬁeld. In the ﬁrst bend, the velocity vectors in several cross sections are
shown in Fig. 2.11c. The secondary ﬂow feature is evident. This may cause the further scour
of the deep hole on the outer bend and deposit sediment on the two sandbars in the inner bend.
The ﬂow ﬁeld from the numerical model with 3D ADCP measurement can be used to give a
clear picture of what is happening around the bend.
The comparison of the bed shear stress between the 2D and 3D models is shown in
Fig. 2.12. Although exact match of the shear stresses is not possible, the basic patterns of
the shear distribution from both models agree well. For both models, the maximum shear
stress is located at the Lake Huron inlet area, and in the second bend, low shear stress is

observed. The magnitude of the shear stress also agrees well indicating the roughness
coefﬁcient selected and the velocity magnitudes the model computed are in the right range.
With these, it is reasonable to conclude that the HydroSed2D model gives reasonable results.
3. MODERN AND FUTURE CHALLENGES
As has been the case with most engineering disciplines, the major advances in open-
channel hydraulics in the past ﬁve decades have been in areas digital computing and software
development. To assert there were no advances in theory and understanding of the governing
processes would be wrong; but those advancements have not had the impact that the advances
in computing have had. The advances in computing power and software are now permitting
water resource engineers to examine complex, multidisciplinary problems that could previ-
ously only be considered qualitatively. Among the problems involving open-channel

153

hydraulics problems are the following, and it is pertinent to observe that they require
multidisciplinary approaches which synthesize the skills and knowledge of professionals in
diverse ﬁelds to develop solutions. Or to paraphrase the old adage, the solution is greater than
the sum of its components.
3.1. Revisiting Past Projects
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s in the United States, many natural channels were
straightened and lined to increase their hydraulic efﬁciency in conveying ﬂood ﬂows.
While these improvements maximized conveyance, they often resulted in channels that are
by current standards less than ideal for a number of reasons and among them are the
following. Many improved channels are aesthetically unappealing; that is, they are usually
prismatic, straight, functionally lined with concrete or a similar artiﬁcial material, and
protected with chain-link fence. The channel pictured in Fig. 2.4 is an example of a functional
but is not aesthetically pleasing nor was it intended to be. In 1954, the US Army Corps of
Engineers undertook the San Antonio Channel Improvements Project, and during the early
stages of this project in the 1950s and 1960s, the San Antonio River below the downtown was
straitened to efﬁciently convey ﬂood ﬂows through densely populated areas. In the twenty-
ﬁrst century portions of that reach of the San Antonio River are being restored to achieve
better aesthetics, restore riparian areas, and provide for recreation while maintaining hydrau-
lic conveyance.
In discussing preserving natural channels while mitigating ﬂood ﬂows, Indian Bend Wash
in Scottsdale, AZ, must be mentioned. Indian Bend Wash is an ephemeral channel that
bisects the City of Scottsdale. Before 1960, Scottsdale was a rural agricultural community
that could not afford to bridge a channel that rarely conveyed ﬂow. However, during the
1960s, there were a series of severe ﬂoods and Federal tax dollars were allocated for US
Army Corps of Engineers to remedy the problem. The proposed remedy was to build a
prismatic concrete canal instead of a system of parks and golf courses the community
wanted. Grass was an untried lining for channels conveying episodic ﬂows and high
maintenance costs were anticipated. The City, in a controversial and bold move, voted for
ﬂood mitigation by the aesthetically attractive system of parks and golf courses which today
is known as Scottsdale Greenbelt. This project, built against the Corps of Engineers
judgment, has proved to be a success from the viewpoints of ﬂood mitigation, aesthetics,
and recreation.
Restoring or maintaining channels to mitigate ﬂood ﬂows and achieve other design
objectives is a challenging problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach. In restoring
a channel, a stable section must be designed and constructed that behaves under many ﬂow
regimes as a natural channel that took decades to form. It is pertinent to observe that the
approaches to this challenge can, generally, be divided into two groups: qualitative and
quantitative. The quantitative approaches derive from the theory of sediment transport and
river mechanics. This is the preferred approach of professionals who have backgrounds in
deterministic Newtonian mechanics. The qualitative approach is generally favored by people
whose background is not mechanics and views watershed management holistically; see, for
154
X. Liu

example, [38]. The proponents of the two approaches both dismiss the merits and validity of
other approach while asserting theirs is valid. Restoring a disturbed system to a “natural”
condition that is in equilibrium is a challenge for which there is not yet a sufﬁcient or adequate
understanding of the processes involved.
Managing a natural ﬂoodway in an urban environment is also a multidisciplinary chal-
lenge. That is, melding the needs to maintain conveyance and riparian habitat while enhanc-
ing recreation and preventing the spread of nonnative invasive species is a complex technical
and social issue. A technical issue that remains a challenge is estimating the Manning
resistance coefﬁcient for naturally vegetated areas with diverse ground cover and vegetation.
Although progress has been made in this area, see, for example, [39, 40], more work is
needed. A second and equally important issue is balancing the hydraulic conveyance needed
with maintaining health and diverse riparian areas; see, for example, [41]. Finally, other uses
of the channel and its ﬂoodplain must often be considered such as recreation, that is, hiking
and biking trails, parks, and playing ﬁelds.
3.2. Effects of Climate Variability
Without entering into a discussion of whether there will be signiﬁcant climate change in the
near future or not, the water resource engineers treat the variability of climate and weather in
designing and maintaining open-channel systems. One of the most important sources of year-
to-year climate variation throughout the world is the El Nin˜o/La Nin˜a phenomena of the
tropical Paciﬁc Ocean. Under normal conditions, the tropical trade winds blow from the east
to west resulting in the concentration of warm water in the western Paciﬁc Ocean. In the
eastern Paciﬁc Ocean, the effect of the trade winds is to upwell cold, deep nutrient waters
along the Equator from the coast of Ecuador to the Central Paciﬁc. During an El Nin˜o episode,
the trade winds weaken and the upwelling of the cool waters in the Eastern Paciﬁc is reduced.
In turn, this allows the warm water in the Western Paciﬁc to drift eastward towards South
America. As the central and eastern Paciﬁc warms, atmospheric pressure gradients along the
Equator weaken and the trade winds are further diminished. These changes are the deﬁning
factors of an El Nino episode and were ﬁrst noted by Gilbert Walker in the early decades of
the twentieth century who termed this the “Southern Oscillation.” From the viewpoint of
water resources engineering in the United States, the importance of this cycle is that during El
Nin˜o periods, the Southwest tends to be wet and the Northwest dry and vice versa for La Nin˜a
periods. The implications of the El Nin˜o/La Nin˜a phenomena on water supply are known and
have been studied; see, for example, [42]. However, the implications of these phenomena on
ﬂood mitigation projects, in general, and open channels, in particular, have not been studied in
any detail.
From the viewpoints of designing and maintaining open-channel systems, whether the
climate is changing on an engineering timescale is less important than whether climate and
weather variability have been properly taken into account. This is again an area where the
water resources engineer can form productive partnerships with professionals in the
geosciences, statistics, and atmospheric sciences to reduce both cost and risk.

3.3. Challenges of Natural Open Channels in the Arid Environment
Flow in open channels in the arid environment present a unique challenge since the ﬂows
are often episodic and ﬂood hazard is often less related to magnitude than to quickness and
ferocity. In addition, non-Newtonian ﬂows of mud and debris are common in some areas and
unconﬁned ﬂows are common. The dominant landform in semiarid and arid environments is
the alluvial fan. For example, in the southwestern United States, alluvial fans and bajadas
occupy approximately 31.3 % of the area [43]. From the viewpoint of water resources
engineering, an appropriate deﬁnition is that of the US Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) [44] or
Alluvial fans are geomorphic features characterized by cone-or fan shaped deposits of boulders, gravel, sand, and
ﬁne sediments that have been eroded from mountain watersheds, and then deposited on the adjacent valley ﬂoor. . .
Flooding that occurs on active alluvial fans is characterized by fast-moving debris and sediment laden shallow
ﬂows. The paths followed by these ﬂows are prone to lateral migration and sudden relocation to other portions of
the fan. In addition, these fast moving ﬂows present hazards associated with erosion, debris ﬂow, and sediment
transport.
The FEMA deﬁnition itemizes the hydraulic processes expected to occur on a generic,
regulatory alluvial fan from an engineering viewpoint; and this deﬁnition makes clear that
hazards on alluvial fans are due to a wide range of hydraulic processes that involve sediment
movement and transport; and many of these processes are not yet well understood.
While hydraulic processes on alluvial fans have interested those in the geosciences for many
years, the interest of the engineering community began when development on alluvial fans rose
to a level where the hazards of ﬂooding on these landforms could not be ignored. The seminal
paper treating open channels conveying ﬂoods on alluvial fans was [45] which proposed a
probabilistic approach to ﬂood hazard identiﬁcation and mitigation on alluvial fans. Since
1979, a vigorous debate, often acrimonious, over modeling open-channel ﬂow on alluvial fans
has taken place. Although sophisticated two-dimensional models, see [46] for example, a
consensus, either technical or regulatory, has been reached. Again this is a problem involving
both the engineering and geoscience communities and should be addressed jointly.
3.4. Discovering and Implementing New Synergies
The foregoing sections have suggested critical topics involving open channels where the
knowledge available is not sufﬁcient to address critical problems that require solutions. In
almost all cases these problems are at the interface between engineering and one or more of
the sciences: geology, geomorphology, ecology, or hydrometeorology to name just a few. The
advancements in modeling over the past several decades have reached the point that syner-
getic considerations covering multiple disciplines are possible and necessary. In this aspect,
model integration becomes important and inter-model communication should be standardize
to ensure smooth ﬂow of data and information. Future generations of computational hydrau-
lics modeling tools should also incorporate the emerging technologies such as cloud com-
puting and big data processing to improve efﬁciency and accuracy. The boundary between
model and data will probably be blurred furthermore which requires the adaptation of our
modeling philosophy.

Abstract Rivers have many service functions such as water supply, food production,
sightseeing, and shipping, hence playing an important role in people’s living and agricultural
production. During the last decades, intensive human activities have been threatening river
ecosystem. A better understanding of ecological stresses and assessments of river ecosystem
is of great signiﬁcance to river conservation and management. This chapter discusses river
ecology, disturbances to the ecology, and assessments of river ecosystem.

1. RIVER ECOSYSTEMS
1.1. Background Information of Rivers
Rivers are such an integral part of the land, and they are much more than merely water
ﬂowing to the sea. Rivers carry downhill not just water, but just as importantly sediments,
dissolved minerals, and the nutrient-rich detritus of plants and animals. The main functions of
rivers are draining ﬂoods, supplying drinking water, maintaining ecology, irrigating farmland,
transporting sediment, supplying power, providing habitat for ﬁshes, assimilating wastewater,
and providing navigation. Humans exploit the resources of rivers by constructing dams and
water-diverting channels, developing navigation channels, and harvesting ﬁshes, which result

in changes in the river hydrology, runoff, sediment transport, riparian and stream habitats, and
water quality.
Rivers can be recognized as mountain rivers, alluvial rivers, and estuaries. A mountain
river is the most upstream part of the river, including the river source and the upstream
tributaries of the river, where the river system ﬂows through mountainous areas and the ﬂow is
conﬁned by mountains. Erosion control and vegetation development over the watershed,
landslides and debris ﬂows, and control of channel bed incision are major topics of mountain
river studies. An alluvial river is deﬁned as a river with its boundary composed of the
sediment previously deposited in the valley, or a river with erodible boundaries ﬂowing in
self-formed channels. Sediment transportation, water resources development, and ﬂood
defense are the most important issues in the alluvial river management. The estuary is the
connection part of a river with the water body (lake, sea, or ocean) into which it ﬂows,
including the river mouth, a river section affected by the tide, and the water body area affected
by the river ﬂow. Delta and coastal processes, eutrophication, and algal blooms are the major
challenges for the management of estuaries.
River ecology is the science of studying the relations among different organisms and the
relations between organisms and their environment in rivers. In recent years, river ecosystems
have been facing the threat of eutrophication and the destruction of natural hydrologic regime.
The former is due to the discharge of sewage, while the latter mainly due to the construction of
hydraulic engineering. At present, in the world, over 40,000 large dams (>15 m high)
impound the rivers, and about 300 new large dams are currently built every year, particularly
in the developing countries [1, 2]. The construction of hydraulic engineering can affect water
temperature, water chemistry, sediment transport, and vegetation assemblages, thereby threat-
ening the ecological functions of the rivers. Therefore, it is vital to assess ecological status of
river systems and to put forward river strategies of conservation and restoration.
1.2. Spatial Elements of River Ecosystems
Ecosystems of rivers vary greatly in size. Taking a deeper look into these ecosystems can
help to explain the functions of landscapes, watersheds, ﬂoodplains, and streams, as shown in
Fig. 3.1. In ecosystems movement between internal and external environments is common.
This may involve movement of materials (e.g., sediment and storm water runoff), organisms
(e.g., mammals, ﬁsh, and insects), and also energy (e.g., heating and cooling of stream
waters).
Many sub-ecosystems form a river ecosystem which, in turn, can also be part of a larger-
scale landscape ecosystem. The structure and functions of the landscape ecosystem are in part
determined by the structure and functions of the river ecosystem. The river ecosystem may
have input or output relations with the landscape ecosystem; thus, the two are related. In order
to plan and design a river ecosystem restoration, it is vital to ﬁrst investigate the relations
between the ecosystems. Landscape ecologists use four basic terms to deﬁne spatial structure
at a particular scale:
1.
Matrix—the land cover that is dominant and interconnected over the majority of the land surface.
Theoretically the matrix can be any land cover type but often it is forest or agriculture.
160
Z.-Y. Wang and B.-Z. Pan

2.
Patch—a nonlinear area (polygon) that is less abundant than, and different from, the matrix.
3.
Corridor—a special type of patch that links other patches in the matrix. Usually, a corridor is linear
or elongated in shape, such as a stream corridor.
4.
Mosaic—a collection of patches, none of which are dominant enough to be interconnected
throughout the landscape.
Figure 3.2 shows examples of a forest matrix, a city patch, a stream corridor, and a mosaic
consisting of a lake, island, forest, and hills. One may see a matrix of mature forest, cropland,
pasture, clear-cuts, lakes, and wetlands on a landscape scale. However, on a river reach scale,
in a matrix of less desirable shallow waters, a trout may perceive pools and well-sheltered,
cool pockets of water as preferred patches, and in order to travel safely among these habitat
patches, the stream channel may be its only alternative. The matrix-patch-corridor-mosaic
model is a very useful, basic way of describing structure in the environment at all levels.
When planning and designing ecosystem restoration, it is very important to always consider
multiple scales.
The stream corridor is an ecosystem with an internal and external environment (its
surrounding landscape). Stream corridors often serve as a primary pathway for the aforemen-
tioned movement of energy, materials, and organisms in, through, and out of the system. This
may be accomplished by connecting patches and functioning as a conduit between ecosystems
and their external environment. Movement in, through, and out of the ecosystem may be
dictated by spatial structure, especially in corridors; conversely, this movement also serves to
change the structure over time. Thus, the end result of past movement is the spatial structure,
as it appears at any point in time. In order to work with ecosystems at any scale, it is
paramount to understand the feedback loop between movement and structure.
Many of the functions of the stream corridor are strongly interlinked with drainage
patterns. So, many people commonly use the term “watershed scale,” and it will also be

used in this chapter. A watershed is deﬁned as an area of land that drains water, sediment, and
dissolved materials to a common outlet at some point along a stream channel [3]. Watersheds,
therefore, occur at many different scales, ranging from the watersheds of very small streams
that measure only a few km2 in size to the largest river basins, such as the Yangtze River
watershed. The matrix, patch, corridor, and mosaic terms can still be used to describe the
ecological structure within watersheds. However, one could further describe the watershed
structure more meaningfully by also focusing on elements such as upper, middle, and lower
watershed zones; drainage divides; upper and lower hill slopes; terraces; ﬂoodplains; estuaries
and lagoons; and river mouths and deltas. Figure 3.3 displays examples of (a) the upper
watershed (the Yangtze River at the Shennongjia Mountain), (b) a mountain stream (the
Qingjiang River is a tributary of the Weihe River in the Yellow River basin), (c) an alluvial
river (the Blue Nile at the conﬂuence with the White Nile River), and (d) an estuary (the
Venice Lagoon at the Po River mouth).
The river corridor is a spatial element (a corridor) at the watershed and landscape scales.
Common matrices in stream corridors include riparian forest or shrub cover or alternatively
herbaceous vegetation. Examples of patches at the stream corridor scale are wetlands, forest,
shrub land, grassland patches, oxbow lakes, residential or commercial development, islands in

the channel, and passive recreation areas such as picnic grounds. Figure 3.4 shows a cross
section of a river corridor. The river corridor can be subdivided by structural features and
plant communities. Riparian areas have one or both of the following characteristics:
(a) vegetative species clearly different from nearby areas and (b) species similar to adjacent
areas but exhibiting more vigorous or robust growth forms. Riparian areas are usually
transitional between wetland and upland.
1.3. Ecological Conditions
1.3.1. Flow
Streams are distinguished from other ecosystems by a ﬂow of water from upstream to
downstream. The micro- and macro-distribution patterns of many stream species are affected
by the spatial and temporal characteristics of stream ﬂow, such as fast versus slow, deep
versus shallow, turbulent versus laminar, and ﬂooding versus low ﬂows [4–6]. Flow velocity
affects the deliverance of food and nutrients to organisms; however, it can also dislodge them

River in the Yellow River basin; (c) the Blue Nile at the conﬂuence with the White Nile in Sudan; and

and prevent them from remaining at a certain site. When a stream has a very slow ﬂow, the
fauna on the banks and the bed are similar in composition and conﬁguration to those present in
stagnant waters [7]. High ﬂows are cues for timing migration and spawning of some ﬁsh.
When ﬁsh detect high ﬂows, some will migrate and some will spawn.
1.3.2. Temperature
Water temperature can vary markedly in a stream system and between different stream
systems. It is a very important factor for cold-blooded aquatic organisms for it affects
many of their physiological and biochemical processes. Stream insects, for example, often
grow and develop more rapidly in warmer portions of a stream or during warmer seasons.
Some species may complete two or more generations per year at warmer sites yet only
one or fewer at cooler sites [6, 8]. This can also be applied to algae and ﬁsh for their
growth rates increase with increased water temperature [5, 9]. Some species are only
found in certain areas due to the correlation between temperature and growth, develop-
ment, and behavior.
1.3.3. Riparian Vegetation
Decreased light and temperature in steams can be a result of riparian vegetation
[10]. When the ﬂow of water is slow, direct sunlight can signiﬁcantly warm up the water,
especially in the summer. In Pennsylvania, the average daily stream temperatures increased
by 12 C when ﬂowing through an open area in direct sunlight but then decreased
signiﬁcantly during ﬂow through 500 m of forest [11]. However, during the winter, a
lack of cover has the opposite effect and causes a decrease in temperature. Sweeney (1992)
found that temperature changes of 2–6 C usually altered key life-history characteristics of
some species [12]. It has been observed that riparian forest buffers help to prevent changes
in natural temperature patterns and also to mitigate the increases in temperature following
deforestation.

1.3.4. Oxygen
Oxygen enters the water by absorption directly from the atmosphere and by plant
photosynthesis [13]. Mountain streams that do not receive a lot of waste discharges are
generally saturated with oxygen due to their shallow depth, constant motion, and large surface
area exposed to the air. Aquatic organisms only survive because of the dissolved oxygen
which, at appropriate concentrations, enables them to reproduce and develop and gives them
vigor. When oxygen levels are low, organisms experience stress and become less competitive
in sustaining the species [13]. Dissolved oxygen concentrations of 3 mg/L or less have been
shown to interfere with ﬁsh populations for a number of reasons [13]. When the oxygen
needed for chemical and biological processes exceeds the oxygen provided by reaeration and
photosynthesis, the ﬁsh will die. Dissolved oxygen concentrations will decrease and may even
be depleted by slow currents, high temperatures, extensive growth of rooted aquatic plants,
algal blooms, or high concentrations of aquatic matter [14].
Pollution that depletes the stream of oxygen has a marked effect on stream communities
[15]. Major factors determining the amount of oxygen found in water are temperature,
pressure, salinity, abundance of aquatic plants, and the amount of natural aeration from
contact with the atmosphere [14]. A level of 5 mg/L or higher of dissolved oxygen in water
is the level associated with normal activity of most ﬁsh [16]. In streams ﬁlled with trout, the
dissolved oxygen concentration has been shown, by analysis, to be between 4.5 and
9.5 mg/L [14].
1.3.5. pH Value
Aquatic biota survive best when the water has a pH of 7, i.e., nearly neutral hydrogen ion
activity. If the pH changes, either becoming more acidic or more alkaline, the stress levels
increase and eventually species diversity and abundance decrease. In streams under the
stresses of various human activities, the pH often becomes more acidic and many species
suffer, as shown in Table 3.1 (revised based on FISRWG 1997). One of the main causes for
changes in the pH of aquatic environments is the increase in the acidity of rainfall [17]. Some
soils have the ability to buffer pH changes; however, those which cannot neutralize acid
inputs cause environmental concerns.
1.3.6. Substrate
Substrate inﬂuences stream biota. Within one reach of a stream, different species and
different numbers of species can be seen among microinvertebrate aggregations found in
snags, sand, bedrock, and cobbles [18–20]. The hyporheic zone is the area of substrate which
is under the substrate-water boundary and is the main area for most benthic invertebrate
species to live and reproduce. It may be only one centimeter thick in some cases or one meter
thick in other cases. The hyporheic zone may form a large subsurface environment, as shown
in Fig. 3.5.
Stream substrates are composed of various materials, including clay, sand, gravel, cobbles,
boulders, organic matter, and woody debris. Substrates form solid structures that modify
surface and interstitial ﬂow patterns, inﬂuence the accumulation of organic materials, and

provide for production, decomposition, and other processes [21]. Sand and silt are considered
to be the least suitable substrates for supporting aquatic organisms and provide for the fewest
species and individuals. Rubble substrates have the highest densities and the most organisms
[15]. If woody debris, from nearby trees in forests and riparian areas, fall into the stream, the
quantity and diversity of aquatic habitats are increased [22, 23].
1.3.7. Nutrients and Eutrophication
Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, and silica are needed for plant growth. How-
ever, nitrogen and phosphorus, if found in surplus, may cause an increase in the rate of growth
of algae and aquatic ﬂora in a stream. This process is called eutrophication. Eutrophication
has been an environmental and ecological problem in China since the 1980s when the
economy began to rapidly grow. If the excess organic matter is decomposed, it can result in
oxygen depletion of the water; it also can have terrible aesthetic consequences, the worst of
which is the death of ﬁsh. Eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs is indirectly measured as
standing crops of phytoplankton biomass, usually represented by planktonic chlorophyll-a
concentration. However, phytoplankton biomass is not generally the main component of plant
biomass in smaller streams because the growth of periphyton and macrophytes, which live on
the streambed, is promoted by high substrate to volume ratios and periods of energetic ﬂow.
When there are decreased ﬂows and high temperatures, excessive algal mats develop and
oxygen is depleted due to eutrophication.
1.4. Biological Assemblages
Stream biota are often classiﬁed into seven groups—bacteria, algae, macrophytes (higher
plants), protists (amoebas, ﬂagellates, ciliates), microinvertebrates (invertebrates less than
0.5 mm in length, such as rotifers, copepods, ostracods, and nematodes), macroinvertebrates

(invertebrates greater than 0.5 mm in length, such as mayﬂies, stoneﬂies, caddis ﬂies, crayﬁsh,
worms, clams, and snails), and vertebrates (ﬁsh, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals) as
shown in Fig. 3.6. Undisturbed streams can contain a remarkable number of species. For
example, more than 1,300 species were found in a 2-km reach of a small German stream, the
Breitenbach, when a comprehensive inventory of stream biota was taken.
The most important elements of the aquatic ecosystem for river management are aquatic
plants, benthic invertebrates, and vertebrates (ﬁsh, reptiles, and amphibians). Aquatic plants
usually consist of mosses attached to permanent stream substrates and macrophytes including
ﬂoating plants,such as Eichoimia crassips; submerged plants, such as Potamogeton sp.; and
emergent plants, such as Phragmites communis Trin (reed). These plants provide primary
productivity for the faunal community and play an important role in decontaminating the river
water and providing multiple habitats for ﬁsh and invertebrates. Bedrock or boulders and
cobbles are often covered by mosses and algae. Figure 3.7 shows microhabitats with moss on
cobbles, submerged macrophytes species Potamogeton sp., ﬂoating plants species Lemna
minor, and emergent plants species Phragmites communis Trin (reed). Rooted aquatic veg-
etation may occur where substrates are suitable and high currents do not scour the stream
bottom. Luxuriant vascular plants may occur in some areas where water clarity, stable
substrates, high nutrients, and slow water velocities are present.
Benthic invertebrates collectively facilitate the breakdown of organic material, such as leaf
litter, that enters the stream from external sources. Larger leaf litter is broken down into
smaller particles by the feeding activities of invertebrates known as shredders (insect larvae

and amphipods). Other invertebrates ﬁlter smaller organic material from the water, known as
ﬁlterers (blackﬂy larvae, some mayﬂy nymphs, and some caddis ﬂy larvae); scrape material
off the surfaces of bedrock, boulders, and cobles, known as scrapers (snails, limpets, and some
caddis ﬂy and mayﬂy nymphs); or feed on material deposited on the substrate, known as
collectors (dipteran larvae and some mayﬂy nymphs) [24]. Some macroinvertebrates are
predatory, known as predators, such as dragonﬂy, which prey on small vertebrates. Figure 3.8
shows typical species of the ﬁve groups with different ecological functions.
Fish are the apex predator in the aquatic system. Many restoration projects aim at
restoration of ﬁsh habitat. From the headwaters to the estuaries, the composition of ﬁsh
species varies considerably due to changes in many hydrologic and geomorphic factors
which control temperature, dissolved oxygen, gradient, current velocity, and substrate. The
amount of different habitats in a given stream section is determined by a combination of these
factors. Fish species richness (diversity) tends to increase downstream as gradient decreases
and stream size increases. For small headwater streams, the gradient tends to be very steep and

the stream is small, and environmental ﬂuctuations occur with a greater intensity and
frequency; therefore, species richness is lowest [9].
Some ﬁsh species are migratory and travel long distances to return to a certain site to
spawn. They have to swim against currents and go up over waterfalls, thus, showing great
strength and endurance. When migrating they move between saltwater and freshwater,
therefore, need to be able to osmoregulate efﬁciently [25, 26]. According to their temperature
requirements, species may also generally be referred to as cold water or warm water and
gradations between. Salmonid ﬁsh prefer cold and highly oxygenated water and, therefore,
can generally be found at high altitudes or northern climes. Salmonid populations are very
sensitive to change or deterioration of their habitat, including alteration of ﬂows, temperature,
and substrate quality. They tolerate only very small ﬂuctuations in temperature and only
reproduce under certain conditions. Their reproductive behavior and movements are affected
by almost undetectable changes in temperature. Usually a salmonid spawns by depositing
eggs over or between clean gravel, which remain oxygenated and silt-free due to upwelling of
currents between the interstitial spaces. Salmonid populations, therefore, are highly suscep-
tible to many forms of habitat degradation, including alteration of ﬂows, temperature, and
substrate quality.

The general concern and interest in restoring habitats for ﬁsh by improving both quality and
quantity is due to the widespread decrease in numbers of native ﬁsh species. With ecological,
economic, and recreational considerations in mind, the importance given to the restoration of
ﬁsh communities is increasing. In 1996 approximately 35 million Americans went ﬁshing for
recreational purposes resulting in over $36 billion in expenditures [27].
Since most recreational ﬁshing is in streams, it is important to restore stream corridors.
Restoration activities have often been focused on improving local habitats, such as fencing or
removing livestock from streams, constructing ﬁsh passages, or installing instream physical
habitat. However, the success of these activities, demonstrated by research, has been very
small or questionable. Over its life span, a species needs many resources and has a great range
of habitat requirements which were not considered during the restoration.
Although the public are most interested in ﬁsh stocks, another goal of the stream restoration
is to preserve other aquatic biota. Of particular concern are freshwater mussels, many species
of which are threatened and endangered. Mussels are highly sensitive to habitat disturbances.
Some of the major threats faced by mussels are dams, which lead to direct habitat loss and
fragmentation of the remaining habitats, persistent sedimentation, pesticides, and exotic
species like ﬁsh and other mussel species which are introduced into the habitat.
1.5. Ecological Functions of Rivers
The main ecological functions of rivers are habitat, conduit, ﬁlter, barrier, source, and sink.
Ecological restoration is done in order to enable river corridor functions to be effectively
restored. However, the goals of restoration are not only to reestablish the structure or to
restore a particular physical or biological process. Ecological functions can be summarized as
a set of basic, common themes that reappear in an ongoing range of situations.
Two characteristics are particularly important to the operation of stream corridor functions:
1.
Connectivity—This is a measure of the dimensions of a stream corridor and how far it continues
[28]. This attribute is affected by breaks in the corridor and between the stream and adjacent land
uses. Transport of materials and energy and movement of ﬂora and fauna are valuable functions
promoted by a high degree of connectivity in a stream between its natural communities.
2.
Width—In stream corridors, this refers to the distance across the stream and its zone of adjacent
vegetation cover. Width is affected by edges, community composition, environmental gradients,
and disturbances/disruptions in adjacent ecosystems, including those with human activity. Aver-
age dimension and variance, number of narrows, and varying habitat requirements are some
example measures of width [29].
1.5.1. Habitat Function
Habitat is a term used to describe an area where plants or animals (including people)
normally live, grow, feed, reproduce, and otherwise exist for any portion of their life cycle.
The important factors needed for survival such as space, food, water, and shelter are provided
by the habitat. As long as the conditions are suitable, many species use river corridors to live,
ﬁnd food and water, reproduce, and establish viable populations. Population size, number of
species, and genetic variation are a few measures of a stable biological community, which
River Ecology
171

vary within known boundaries over time. Streams may positively affect these measures at
different levels. Since corridors are linked to small habitat patches, they have a great value as
habitats because they create large, more complex habitats with greater wildlife populations
and higher biodiversity. In general, stream corridors are habitats for plants, ﬁsh, invertebrates,
and amphibians. For instance, the Fazi River is an urban stream in Taichung City, as shown in
Fig. 3.9. The river has gravel bed with alternative lentic and lotic waters. Although the river is
seriously polluted in the upstream reaches, several tens of species of macroinvertebrates, ﬁsh,
and birds are found in the river.
Habitat functions differ at various scales, and an appreciation of the scales at which
different habitat functions occur will help a restoration initiative succeed. The evaluation of
a habitat at larger scales, for example, may make note of a biotic community’s size, compo-
sition, connectivity, and shape. To help describe habitat over large areas at the landscape
scale, the concepts of matrix, patches, mosaics, and corridors can be used. Migrating species
can be provided with their favorite resting and feeding habitats during migration stopovers by
stream corridors with naturally occurring vegetation. Some patches are too small for large
mammals like the black bear which need great, unbroken areas to live in. However, these
patches may be linked by wide stream corridors to create a large enough territory for bears.
Assessing habitat function at small scales can also be viewed in terms of patches and
corridors. It is also at local scales that transitions among the various habitats within the river
can become more important. Two basic types of habitat structure, interior and edge habitat,
can be found in stream corridors. Connectivity and width greatly inﬂuence the functions of
habitats at the corridor scale. A stream corridor provides a better habitat if it is wide and if it
has greater connectivity. Changes in plant and animal communities can be caused by river
valley morphology and environmental gradients, such as gradual changes in soil wetness,
solar radiation, and precipitation. Species usually ﬁnd ideal habitats in broad, unfractured, and
diverse streams, rather than narrow and homogenous ones.
Fig. 3.9. The Fazi River, an urban stream in Taichung City, provides habitats for benthic invertebrates,
ﬁsh and birds.
172
Z.-Y. Wang and B.-Z. Pan

Factors such as climate, microclimate, elevation, topography, soils, hydrology, vegetation,
and human uses cause the habitat conditions within a river to vary. When planning to restore a
stream, its width is of great importance to wildlife. The size and shape of a stream corridor
must be sufﬁciently wide for a species to populate. This must be considered when trying to
maintain a certain wildlife species. If the corridor is too narrow, from the point of view of the
species, it is as if there is a piece of the corridor missing.
Riparian forests provide diversity not only in their edge and interior habitats, but also offer
vertical habitat diversity in their canopy, sub-canopy, shrub, and herb layers. Within the
channel itself, rifﬂes, pools, glides, rapids, and backwaters all provide different habitat
conditions in both the water column and the streambed. These examples, all described in
terms of physical structure, yet again show that there is a strong correlation between structure
and habitat function.
1.5.2. Conduit Function
To act as a route for the ﬂow of energy, materials, and organisms is known as the conduit
function, as shown in Fig. 3.10. A stream is foremost a conduit that was formed by and for
collecting and transporting water and sediment. As well as water and sediment, aquatic fauna
and other materials use the stream corridor as a conduit. Since there is movement across as
well as along the stream and in many other directions, the corridor can be considered to have
lateral and longitudinal conduit functions. If the stream corridor is covered by a closed
canopy, then birds and mammals may cross over the stream through the vegetation. The
food supply for ﬁsh and invertebrates may be enriched or increased by the movement of
organic debris and nutrients from higher to lower ﬂoodplains.
Fig. 3.10. A stream is a ﬂow pathway for heat, water, and other materials, and organisms as shown for
a small tributary of the Songhua River in northeast China.
River Ecology
173

Corridors can act as pathways and habitats at the same time for migratory or highly mobile
wildlife. The migration of songbirds from their wintering habitat in the neotropics to a
summer habitat further north is made possible by rivers together with other, useful habitats.
After all, birds can only ﬂy a certain distance before they need to eat and rest. For rivers to
function effectively as conduits for these birds, they must be sufﬁciently connected and be
broad enough to provide the habitat required for migratory birds.
The migration of salmon upstream for spawning has been extensively investigated and is a
well-known example of the movement of aquatic organisms and interactions with the habitat.
A conduit to their upstream spawning grounds is very important to the salmon which mature
in a saltwater environment. In the case of the Paciﬁc salmon species, the stream corridor
depends on the nutrient input and biomass of dying ﬁsh and plentiful spawning in the
upstream reaches. So, not only are conduits important for the movement of aquatic biota,
but also for the transport of nutrients from ocean waters upstream.
Stream corridors are also conduits for the movement of energy, which occurs in many
forms. Heat is transported with ﬂowing water along a stream, as shown in Fig. 3.10. The
potential energy of the stream is provided by gravity, which alters and carves the landscape.
The corridor modiﬁes heat and energy from sunlight as it remains cooler in spring and
summer and warmer in the fall. Stream valleys move cool air from high to low altitudes in
the evening and, therefore, are effective airsheds. The energy built up by the productivity of
plants in a corridor is stored as living plant material, and it moves into other systems by leaf
fall and detritus.
Seeds may be carried for long distances by ﬂowing water and then deposited. Whole plants
may be uprooted, transported, and then deposited, still living, in a new area by strong ﬂoods.
Plants are also transported when animals eat and transport their seeds throughout different
parts of the river. Some riparian habitats depend on a continuous supply and transport of
sediment, although many ﬁsh and invertebrates can be harmed by excess ﬁne sediment.
1.5.3. Filter and Barrier Functions
Stream corridors may act as ﬁlters, allowing selective penetration of energy, materials, and
organisms; they may also act as a barrier to movement. In many ways, the entire stream
corridor serves beneﬁcially as a ﬁlter or barrier that reduces water pollution, minimizes
sediment transport, and often provides a natural boundary to land uses, plant communities,
and some less mobile wildlife species as shown in Fig. 3.11.
Movement of materials, energy, and organisms perpendicular to the ﬂow of the stream is
most effectively ﬁltered or barred; however, elements moving parallel to the stream corridor,
along the edge, may also be selectively ﬁltered. The movement of nutrients, sediment, and
water over land is ﬁltered by the riparian vegetation. Dissolved substances, such as nitrogen,
phosphorus, and other nutrients, entering a vegetated river valley, are restricted from entering
the channel by friction, root absorption, clay, and soil organic matter.
Edges at the boundaries of stream corridors begin the process of ﬁltering. Initial ﬁltering
functions are concentrated into a tight area by sudden edges. These edges tend to be caused by
disruptions and usually encourage movement along boundaries while opposing movement
174
Z.-Y. Wang and B.-Z. Pan

between ecosystems. On the other hand, gradual edges promote movement between ecosys-
tems and increase ﬁltering and spread it across a wider ecological gradient. Gradual edges are
found in natural settings and are more diverse [30].
1.5.4. Source and Sink Functions
Organisms, energy, and materials are supplied to the bordering area by rivers. Areas that
function as sinks absorb organisms, energy, or materials from the surrounding landscape.
A stream can act as both a source and a sink, as shown in Fig. 3.12. However, this is affected
by the location of the stream and the time of year. Although they may sometimes function as a
sink, when ﬂooding deposits new sediment there, stream banks tend to act as a source, for
example, of sediment to the stream. Genetic material throughout the landscape is supplied by
and moves through corridors, which at the landscape scale, act as conduits or connectors to
many different patches of habitats.
Surface water, groundwater, nutrients, energy, and sediment can be stored in stream
corridors, which then act as a sink and allow materials to be temporarily stored in the corridor.
Friction, root absorption, clay, and soil organic matter prevent the entry of dissolved sub-
stances such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients into a vegetated stream corridor.
Forman (1995) offers three sources and sink functions resulting from ﬂoodplain vegetation:
(a)

(b) containment of sediments and other materials during ﬂood stage, and (c) source of soil

2. ECOLOGICAL STRESSES TO RIVERS
Ecological stresses are deﬁned as the disturbances that bring changes to river ecosystems.
The ecological stresses are natural events or human-induced activities that occur separately or
simultaneously. The structure of a system and its capability of carrying out important
ecological functions may be changed by stresses, regardless of whether they act individually
or in combination. One or more characteristics of a stable system may be permanently
changed by a causal chain of events produced by a stress present in a river. For instance,
land-use change may cause changes of hydrologic and hydraulic features of the river, and
these changes may cause changes in sediment transportation, habitat, and ecology [32].
Disturbances are not all of equal frequency, duration, and intensity, and they may occur
anywhere within the stream corridor and associated ecosystems. A large number of distur-
bances of different frequency, duration, intensity, and location may be caused by one single
disturbance. Once people understand the evolution of what disturbances are stressing the
system, and how the system reacts to those stresses, people can decide which actions are
needed to restore the function and structure of the stream corridor.
Disturbance occurs within variations of scale and time. Changes brought about by land use,
for example, may occur within a single year at the stream or reach scale (crop rotation), a
decade within the stream scale (urbanization), and even over decades within the landscape
scale (long-term forest management). Despite the fact that wildlife populations, such as the
monarch butterﬂy, remain stable over long periods of time, they may ﬂuctuate greatly in short
periods of time in a certain area. Similarly, while weather ﬂuctuates daily, geomorphic or
climatic changes may occur over hundreds to thousands of years.

landscape and also as a sink absorbing organisms, energy, or materials from the surrounding landscape.

Although it is not observed by humans, tectonic motion changes the landscape over periods
of millions of years. The slope of the land and the elevation of the earth surface are affected by
tectonics, such as earthquakes and mountain-creating forces like folding and faulting. Streams
may alter their cross section or plan form in response to changes brought on by tectonics.
Great changes in the patterns of vegetation, soils, and runoff in a landscape are caused by the
quantity, timing, and distribution of precipitation. As runoff and sediment loads vary, the
stream corridor may change.
2.1. Natural Stresses
Climatic change, desertiﬁcation, ﬂoods, hurricanes, tornadoes, erosion and sedimentation,
ﬁre, lightning, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides, temperature extremes, and drought
are among the many natural events that have a negative impact on the structure and functions
of a river ecosystem. The relative stability, resistance, and resilience of an ecosystem
determine their response to a disturbance.
Climate change may be illustrated with climate diagrams at meteorological stations. The
climate diagram was suggested by Walter [33]. In the diagram, temperature is plotted on the
left vertical axis and average total monthly precipitation on the right vertical axis. Temper-
ature and precipitation are plotted on different scales. Walter (1985) used 20 mm/month as
equivalent to 10 C for the USA and Europe, but 100 mm/month is used as equivalent to 10 C
for a tropical rain forest [33]. In this book, 30 mm/month is equivalent to 10 C for China.
Very useful information, such as the seasonal ﬂuctuation of temperature and precipitation, the
duration and intensity of wet and dry seasons, and the percentage of the year in which the
average monthly temperature is above and below 0 C, is summarized in this climate diagram.
When the precipitation line lies above the temperature line, then, in theory, there should be
enough moisture for plants to grow. The potential evapotranspiration rate will exceed the
precipitation if the temperature line lies above the precipitation line. The more the temper-
ature line moves up and away from the precipitation line, the drier the climate will be.
A huge landslide may totally destroy the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem of a river.
Figure 3.13 shows the Wenjiagou Landslide in Mianzhu City, Sichuan, China, which was
induced by the Wenchuan Earthquake on May 12, 2008. The total volume of the sliding body
was 81 million m3. The stream and vegetation on slopes were buried underneath the 180-m-
thick landslide. Both faunal and ﬂoral communities have been totally destroyed and the
restoration needs a long period of time.
Erosion and sedimentation often are the direct cause of ecology impairment. Figure 3.14a
shows the high sediment concentration in a stream in Taiwan, southeast China, which causes a
strong stress on the aquatic bio-community. The sediment results from intensive soil erosion
caused by a rainstorm. The high concentration results in low transparency, low dissolved
oxygen, and sediment coating the substrate. Benthic animals and ﬁsh may be killed during the
high concentration event. Figure 3.14b shows the turbid seawater with a high concentration of
sediment on the east coast of Taiwan. The sediment is transported into the ocean by debris
ﬂows and hyperconcentrated ﬂows. Tidal current and waves bring the sediment onto the shore
and bays, which impacts on ﬁsh and invertebrate communities.

Stream ecology is inﬂuenced by certain animal activities. For example, beavers build dams
that cause ponds to form within a stream channel or in the ﬂoodplain. Figure 3.15a shows that
a couple of beavers skillfully use nature’s building materials and construct a wood dam with
tree branches on the Spring Pond in Pennsylvania, and Fig. 3.15b shows the 3-m-high beaver
dam forms a pond, which provides a good habitat for ﬁsh and birds. Without any machines the
beavers transported so much building materials and built the dam within several months. The
landlord of the Spring Pond, Mr. R. Devries, pronounced that there is no way for humans

“could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity, their dam
persistence, their dam determination, and their dam work ethic.”
Of course the dam construction by beavers disturbs the stream ecology. The pond kills
much of the existing vegetation. Moreover, if appropriate woody plants in the ﬂoodplain are
scarce, beavers extend their cutting activities into the uplands and can signiﬁcantly alter the
riparian and stream corridors. The sequence of beaver dams along a stream corridor may have
major effects on hydrology, sedimentation, and mineral nutrients. Silts and other ﬁne sedi-
ments accumulate in the pond rather than being washed downstream. On the other hand the
aquatic ecological conditions are improved by the beaver dams. Water from storm ﬂow is held
back, thereby affording some measure of ﬂood control. Wetland areas usually form, and the
water table rises upstream of the dam. The ponds combine slow ﬂow, near-constant water
levels, and low turbidity that support ﬁsh and other aquatic organisms. Birds may use beaver
ponds extensively.
Although the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Quality found that “dams of this
nature are inherently hazardous and cannot be permitted.” The Department therefore orders
“to restore the stream to a free-ﬂow condition by removing all wood and brush forming the
dams from the stream channel.” The beaver dam and the life of beavers on ﬁsh in their
“reservoir” are a part of the ecology, which increases the diversity of habitats. The landlord
Mr. R. Devries pronounced on behalf of the beavers that “the Spring Pond Beavers have a
right to build their unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green and water
ﬂows downstream. They have more dam rights than humans do to live and enjoy Spring Pond.
If the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection lives up to its name, it
should protect the natural resources (Beavers) and the environment (Beavers’ Dams).
Riparian vegetation, in general, tends to be resilient. Despite the fact that a ﬂood may
destroy a mature cottonwood forest, the conditions it leaves behind are usually those of a
nursery, so a new forest can be established, and, thus, the riparian ecosystem is increased

Pennsylvania, USA; (b) The 3-m-high beaver dam forms a pond, which provides a good habitat for ﬁsh

[34]. Having developed characteristics such as high biomass and deep established root
systems, the riparian forest systems have adapted to many types of natural stresses. Due to
this adaptation, small and frequent droughts, ﬂoods, and other natural disruptions are of little
consequence to the systems. When an unexpected serious stress occurs like ﬁre, then the effect
is only local and does not affect the community on a larger scale. However, the resilience of
the system can be disrupted by widespread effects such as acid rain and indiscriminate logging
and associated road building. Soil moisture, soil nutrients, and soil temperature can be
critically changed by these and other disturbances, as well as other factors. Several tens of
years are needed for the recovery of a system affected by widespread disturbance.
2.2. Human-Induced Stresses
Human-induced stresses undoubtedly have the greatest potential for introducing enduring
changes to the ecological structure and functions of stream corridors. Physical disturbance
effects occur at any scale from landscape and stream corridor to stream and reach, where they
can cause impacts locally or at locations far removed from the site of origin. Activities such as
ﬂood control, road building and maintenance, agricultural tillage, and irrigation, as well as
urban encroachment, can have dramatic effects on the geomorphology and hydrology of a
watershed and the stream corridor morphology within it. The modiﬁcation of stream hydrau-
lics directly affects the system, causing an increase in the intensity of disturbances caused by
ﬂoods. Chemically deﬁned disturbance effects, for example, can be introduced through many
activities including discharging sewage and wastewater (acid mine drainage and heavy
metals) into the stream. Ecological disturbance effects are mainly to the result of the
introduction of exotic species. The introduction of exotic species, whether intentional or
not, can cause disruptions such as predation, hybridization, and the introduction of diseases.
For instance, bullfrogs have been introduced into the western USA. They reproduce prodi-
giously and prey on numerous native amphibians, reptiles, ﬁsh, and small mammals and cause
biological problems in the ecosystem. Altering the structure of plant communities can affect
the inﬁltration and movement of water, thereby altering the timing and magnitude of runoff
events.
2.2.1. Dams
Ranging from small temporary structures to huge multipurpose structures, human-
constructed barriers can have profound and varying impacts on stream corridors. Barriers
affect resident and migratory organisms in stream channels. Power plants may kill ﬁsh when
they swim through the turbines. Figure 3.16a shows that many birds are searching for dead
ﬁsh at the outlets of a hydropower plant in Korea, which were killed when they swam through
the turbine; Fig. 3.16b shows that the Baozhusi Dam on the Bailong River in Sichuan
Province has cut off the river ﬂow. The stream ecology of the lower reaches has been greatly
affected. The dam blocks or slows the passage and migration of aquatic organisms, which in
turn affects food chains associated with stream ecological functions.
The Colorado River watershed is a 627,000-km2 mosaic of mountains, deserts, and
canyons. The watershed begins at over 4,000 m in the Rocky Mountains and ends at the
180

Sea of Cortez. Many native species require very speciﬁc environments and ecosystem
processes to survive. Under natural conditions, the basin’s rivers and streams were charac-
terized by a large stochastic variability in the annual and seasonal ﬂow levels. This hydrologic
variability was a key factor in the evolution of the basin’s ecosystems. Today over 40 dams
and diversion structures control the river system and result in extensive fragmentation of the
watershed and riverine ecosystem.
2.2.2. Channelization and Water Diversions
Like dams, channelization disturbs the stream ecology, by disrupting rifﬂe and pool
complexes needed at different times in the life cycle of certain aquatic organisms. The
ﬂood conveyance beneﬁts of channelization and diversions are often offset by ecological
losses resulting from increased stream velocities and reduced habitat diversity. Levees along
rivers and diversion channels tend to replace riparian vegetation. The reduction in trees and
other riparian vegetation along levees result in changes in shading, temperature, and nutrients.
Hardened banks result in decreased habitat for organisms that live in stream sediments, banks,
and riparian plants. Water diversion from rivers impacts the stream ecology, depending on the
timing and amount of water diverted, as well as the location, design, and operation of the
diversion structure.
2.2.3. Fragmentation of Habitat
Some river training works result in the fragmentation and isolation of habitats. Figure 3.17
shows the Yangtze River and numerous riparian lakes with different sizes. Naturally these
lakes connected with the Yangtze River and formed a huge habitat in the past. Humans cut the

connection for ﬂood defense and aquatic farming, thus, fragmenting the habitat. The frag-
mentation of habitat has resulted in deterioration of the ecology and extinction of some
species.
Cutoff of riparian lakes from the Yangtze River stressed the complex ecosystem in the
lakes and the river. Figure 3.18 shows a comparison of species richness of aquatic plants and
benthic invertebrates in isolated lakes and river-linked lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze
River basin [35]. The connection of the isolated lakes with the Yangtze River was cut off in

the past decades, which has resulted in continuous reduction of species. The cutoff also caused
reduction of ﬁsh species. There are 101 ﬁsh species in the river-linked Poyang Lake but only
57 and 47 ﬁsh species in the isolated Honghu Lake and Zhangdu Lake.
2.2.4. Mining
Gold placer mining in rivers has become an extreme intensive disturbance to the stream
ecology in southwest China. Figure 3.19a shows placer mining in the Bailong River, which
is a tributary of the Jialing River in Sichuan Province. People are removing bed gravel from
the river for placer mining. The benthic invertebrate community is completely disturbed.
Moreover, mercury is used in the process, which has also resulted in water pollution.
Compared with gold mining, gravel mining is much more widespread. Since the 1980s,
gravel mining has become a serious ecological stress in many rivers throughout China, as
shown in Fig. 3.19b. Gravel and coarse sand are mined for building materials. Gravel
mining causes loss of habitat for benthic bio-communities and loss of spawning ground for
many ﬁsh species. Lacking laws for controlling river sediment mining and attracted by
great economic beneﬁt, sediment mining has developed so quickly that almost all streams
are stressed.
Surface mining also causes stresses on the river ecosystem. Exploration, extraction,
processing, and transportation of coal, minerals, and other materials have had and continue
to have a profound effect on stream corridors. Many river ecosystems remain in a degraded
condition as a result of mining activities. Such mining activity frequently resulted in total
destruction of the stream corridor. In some cases today, mining operations still disturb most or
all of entire watersheds. Mercury was used to separate gold from the ore; therefore, mercury
was also lost into streams. Present-day miners using suction dredges often ﬁnd considerable
quantities of mercury still resident in streambeds. Current heap-leaching methods use cyanide
to extract gold from low-quality ores. This poses a special risk if operations are not carefully
managed.

2.2.5. Pollution
Point source pollution from industry and diffuse pollution from agriculture (pesticides and
nutrients) have the potential to disturb natural chemical cycles in streams and, thus, to degrade
water quality and impact the ecosystem. Toxic runoff or precipitates can kill streamside
vegetation or can cause a shift to species more tolerant of polluted conditions. Chemical
disturbances from agriculture are usually widespread, nonpoint sources. Municipal and
industrial waste contaminants are typically point sources and often chronic in duration.
Secondary effects, such as agricultural chemicals attached to sediments, frequently occur as
a result of physical activities (irrigation or heavy application of herbicides). In these cases, it is
better to control the physical activity at its source than to treat the symptoms within a stream
corridor.
Toxic runoff or precipitates can kill streamside vegetation or can cause a shift to species
more tolerant of polluted conditions. This affects habitat required by many species for cover,
food, and reproduction. Aquatic habitat suffers from several factors. Acid mine drainage can
coat stream bottoms with iron precipitates, thereby affecting the habitat for bottom-dwelling
and bottom-feeding organisms. Precipitates coating the stream bottom can eliminate places
for egg survival. Fish that do hatch may face hostile stream conditions due to poor water
quality.
Chemical disturbances from agriculture are usually widespread, nonpoint sources. Munic-
ipal and industrial waste contaminants are typically point sources and often chronic in
duration. Secondary effects, such as agricultural chemicals attached to sediments, frequently
occur as a result of physical activities (irrigation or heavy application of herbicides). In these
cases, it is better to control the physical activity at its source than to treat the symptoms within
a stream corridor.
2.2.6. Urbanization
Urbanization in watersheds poses special challenges for stream ecological management.
Recent research has shown that streams in urban watersheds have a character fundamentally
different from that of streams in forested, rural, or even agricultural watersheds. Impervious
cover directly inﬂuences urban streams by dramatically increasing surface runoff during
storm events by 2–16 times, with proportional reductions in groundwater recharge [36].
Figure 3.20 conceptually shows the effects of different amounts of impervious cover on the
water balance for a watershed.
2.2.7. Agriculture and Land-Use Change
Land-use change is the most common human-induced stress on the ecosystem. Agricultural
activities have generally resulted in encroachment on stream corridors. Producers often crop
as much productive land as possible to enhance economic returns; therefore, native vegetation
is sacriﬁced to increase arable areas. As the composition and distribution of vegetation are
altered, the interactions between ecosystem structure and function become fragmented.
Vegetation removal from stream banks, ﬂoodplains, and uplands often conﬂicts with the
hydrologic and geomorphic functions of stream corridors. These disturbances can result in
184
Z.-Y. Wang and B.-Z. Pan

sheet erosion, rill erosion, and gully erosion, reduced inﬁltration, increased upland surface
runoff and transport of contaminants, increased bank erosion, unstable stream channels, and
impaired habitat.
Tillage and soil compaction interfere with the soil’s capacity to partition and regulate the
ﬂow of water in the landscape, increase surface runoff, and decrease the water-holding
capacity of soils. Tillage also often aids in the development of a hard pan, a layer of increased
soil density and decreased permeability that restricts the movement of water into the subsur-
face. Disturbance of soil associated with agriculture generates runoff polluted with sediment,
a major nonpoint source pollutant in the world. Pesticides and nutrients (mainly nitrogen,
phosphorous, and potassium) applied during the growing season can leach into groundwater
or ﬂow in surface water to stream corridors, either dissolved or adsorbed to soil particles.
Improper storage and application of animal waste from concentrated animal production
facilities are potential sources of chemical and bacterial contaminants to stream corridors.
Tree removal decreases the quantity of nutrients in the watershed since approximately
one-half of the nutrients in trees are in the trunks. Nutrient levels can increase if large limbs
fall into streams during harvesting and decompose. Conversely, when tree cover is removed,
there is a short-term increase in nutrient release followed by long-term reduction in nutrient
levels. Removal of trees can affect the quality, quantity, and timing of stream ﬂows. If trees
are removed, from a large portion of a watershed, ﬂow quantity can increase accordingly, and
water temperature can increase during summer and decrease in winter.

Many of the potential effects of land-use change are cumulative or synergistic. Restoration
might not remove all disturbance factors; however, addressing one or two disturbance
activities can dramatically reduce the impact of those remaining. Simple changes in manage-
ment, such as the use of conservation buffer strips in cropland or managed livestock access to
riparian areas, can substantially overcome undesired cumulative effects or synergistic
interactions.
2.2.8. Domestic Livestock
Stream corridors are particularly attractive to livestock for many reasons. They are
generally highly productive and provide ample forage. Husbandry development in a water-
shed has applied a unique stress on the ecosystem. For instance, the riparian vegetation
succession from herbaceous to shrubs has been delayed or even stopped by grazing of
livestock along the Ake River on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, as shown in Fig. 3.21a. On the
other hand, the activities of livestock have become an important element of the river ecology.
Excrement of cattle provides the main nutrient for the grassland. The positive and negative
effects of grazing of domestic livestock must be considered in any restoration strategy. In
many cases livestock swimming in a stream can result in extensive physical disturbance and
bacteriological contamination, as shown in Fig. 3.21b.
2.2.9. Recreation and Tourism
The amount of impacts caused by the recreation and tourism industry depends on stream
hydrology, soil type, vegetation cover, topography, and intensity of use. Various forms of foot
and vehicular trafﬁc associated with recreational activities can damage riparian vegetation
and soil structure. All-terrain vehicles, for example, can cause increased erosion and habitat
reduction. At locations, reduced inﬁltration due to soil compaction and subsequent surface

Qinghai Plateau; (b) Livestock swimming in a stream can result in extensive physical disturbance and

186

runoff can result in increased sediment loading to the stream [37]. In areas where the stream
can support recreational boating, the system is vulnerable to additional impacts.
2.2.10. Forestry
In addition to the changes in water, sediment, and nutrient loads to streams because of
logging practices (i.e., land-use change), forestry may have other impacts of river ecosystems.
Forest roads are constructed to move loaded logs to higher-quality roads and then to a
manufacturing facility. Mechanical means to move logs to a loading area (landing) produce
“skid trails.” Stream crossings are necessary along some skid trails, and most forest road
systems are in especially sensitive areas. Removal of topsoil, soil compaction, and logging
equipment and log skidding can result in long-term loss of productivity, decreased porosity,
decreased soil inﬁltration, and increased runoff and erosion. Spills of petroleum products can
contaminate soils. Trails, roads, and landings can intercept groundwater ﬂow and cause it to
become surface runoff.
2.3. Introduction of Exotic Species
Biologically deﬁned disturbance effects occur within species (competition, cannibalism,
etc.) and among species (competition, predation, etc.). These are natural interactions that are
important determinants of population size and community organization in many ecosystems.
Biological disturbances due to improper grazing management or recreational activities are
frequently encountered. The introduction of exotic ﬂora and fauna species can introduce
widespread, intense, and continuous stress on native biological communities. There are
numerous examples worldwide of introduced species bringing about the extinction of native
organisms. The most dramatic have involved predators. An extreme example is the deliberate
introduction of the ﬁsh-eating Nile perch (Lates niloticus) to Lake Victoria, in East Africa,
causing the extinction of dozens of species of small endemic cichlid ﬁsh.
Exotic animals are a common problem in many areas in the USA and China. Species such
as Cambarus clarkaij have been introduced in many waters in south China. Without the
normal checks and balances found in their native habitat in North America and Japan,
Cambarus clarkaij reproduces prodigiously and causes disturbance to the ecosystem.
Figure 3.22 shows Cambarus clarkaij. The species burrow in river levees and have caused
many breaches and ﬂooding disasters. The rapid spreading of the species has caused rice
harvest reduction because the animals eat the rice paddies’ root. In some places Cambarus
clarkaij has also caused prevalence of a disease.
Similarly introduction of the zebra mussel and bullfrog has imposed an intense stress on
native biological communities in the western USA. Without the normal checks and balances
found in their native habitat in the eastern USA, bullfrogs reproduce prodigiously and prey on
numerous native amphibians, reptiles, ﬁsh, and small mammals.
Golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) is an invasive ﬁlterer species of macroinvertebrate.
Originally the species comes from south China, which has spread to various regions, including
Japan, Australia, Argentina, Thailand, India, Brazil, and Europe [38]. The species colonizes
habitats with water temperature between 8 and 35 C, ﬂow velocity less than 2 m/s, water
River Ecology
187

depth less than 10 m with or without sunlight, dissolved oxygen higher than 1.0 mg/L, and pH
higher than 6.4 [39–41]. Golden mussels have unprimitive byssus threads, which allow them
to attach onto solid walls, especially human-constructed water transfer tunnels and pipelines.
Dense attachment of golden mussels in drinking water transfer tunnels and pipelines results in
macro-fouling [42] and causes high resistance to water ﬂow and damage to pipeline walls.
This along with dead mussels decay harms the surrounding water quality [43, 44]. Figure 3.23
shows colonization of golden mussel in the water transfer tunnels in Shenzhen, southern
China, and attachment of golden mussel on the surface of a concrete fragment. The density of
golden mussel individuals is as high as to 20,000/m2. Golden mussel invasion causes a serious
challenge to water transfer projects that seek to solve issues such as the uneven distribution of
water resources and the problem of water shortages in northern China. The presence of golden
mussels results in quick and uncontrolled spread of the species.

Introduction of exotic species has inevitably occurred worldwide, and this is accelerating
following economic and ecological globalization. Compared with faunal species, introduction
of ﬂoral species is quicker and more intensive because humans pay less attention to the
negative impacts of the introduction. The introduction of exotic species, whether intentional
or not, can cause disruptions such as hybridization and the introduction of diseases. Nonnative
species compete with native species for moisture, nutrients, sunlight, and space and can
adversely inﬂuence establishment rates for new plantings, foods, and habitat. In some cases,
exotic plant species can even detract from the recreational value of streams by creating a
dense, impenetrable thicket along the stream bank.
Many exotic species have been introduced as consequences of human activities. For
instance, at least 708 ﬂoral species and about 40 faunal species have been successfully
introduced into China in the past century; among them several tens of species have caused
ecological problems. A lot of money has been spent to remove these species. The most
harmful species are Eupatorium adenophorum, Eichoimia crassips, Ambrosia artemisia L.,
and Spartina alterniﬂora.
Spartina alterniﬂora was introduced from the USA in 1980 to control coastal erosion and
accelerate land creation in estuaries. The species may grow in salt marsh, because they
tolerate periodical tidal inundation and resist wave erosion. The species colonize silt coasts
very quickly and stabilize the coast with its dense roots. Nevertheless, the species dominate
silt coasts and estuaries, resulting in a great reduction in biodiversity. Many invertebrates and
ﬁsh cannot live in the shallow waters with Spartina alterniﬂora. The species has over to
spread the neighboring coastal areas. Coastal areas and estuaries dominated by reed (Phrag-
mites communis Trin) have been colonized and occupied by Spartina alterniﬂora. The ﬁshery
harvest has been signiﬁcantly reduced. Figure 3.24a shows Spartina alterniﬂora in the
Yangtze River estuary.
Alien invasive species Eupatorium adenophorum originates from Mexico and was
introduced into south China from South Asia in the 1940s. The species has spread quickly
in southwest China and eliminated local species. The species is toxic and many cattle and
sheep have been killed. The area occupied by the species has increased to about 30 million
ha. To remove the species from grassland is very difﬁcult. Millions of dollars have been
lost due to husbandry loss and control of spreading of the species in Sichuan and Yunnan
Provinces. Figure 3.24b shows the Eupatorium adenophorum in Yunnan Province in
southwest China.
Eichoimia crassips was introduced to control eutrophication in streams and lakes. The
species adsorb pollutants and nutrients in the water and may enhance the puriﬁcation capacity
of the stream or lake. Nevertheless, the species spread too fast and ﬁshery and water surface
recreation have been affected. Humans have to remove them from waters, which has caused
economic losses up to several tens of millions of dollars. Figure 3.24c shows Eichoimia
crassips spreading quickly in a polluted stream in Beijing.
Ambrosia artemisia L. and Ambrosia triﬁda L. entered China in the 1930s and spread
quickly since the 1980s and 1990s. The species produce a lot of pollen. In Shenyang in
northeast China, the density of pollen in air in 1987 was 38 times of that in 1983 because of

189

introduction of the species. About 1.5 % of the local people suffer from pollinosis. Millions of
dollars have been lost due to introduction of the species. Figure 3.24d shows the Ambrosia
artemisia L. in northeast China.
Introduction of exotic species is not always bad for the ecosystem. Hong Kong has become
a paradise of exotic species and most of these species have been naturalized in the island.
Hong Kong and the island of Dominica, in the Caribbean, probably had no inland plant
species in common 500 years ago. Today they share more than a hundred weeds of human-
dominated open habitats. The term “alien” is used to refer to species that originated elsewhere
but have become established in Hong Kong. Although people have introduced many alien
species by accident, others have been brought to a location deliberately, as crops,

ornamentals, livestock, or pets. Not all introduced species are aliens. In fact, reintroduction of
species to parts of their former range is an important conservation tool. Hong Kong’s total
vascular plant ﬂora of approximately 2,100 species includes at least 150 naturalized aliens,
that is, species introduced from other parts of the world which have run wild in Hong Kong
[45]. For faunal species, most of these aliens were brought to Hong Kong by people, but some
have spread on their own. Some of these have established wild populations when they escaped
or were abandoned or released.
In Hong Kong the majority of introduced species are conﬁned to those areas where human
inﬂuence is strongest and most persistent. Indeed, in most residential and industrial areas, as
well as the few sites still used for intensive farming, alien species dominate the biota. In
contrast, recognizable aliens are rare or absent in most upland streams and hillside commu-
nities. Thus, the majority of aliens are found in those places where the native ﬂora and fauna
has already suffered most as a result of human activities. At present, the impact of the
numerous alien plant and animal species established in Hong Kong is, in most cases, hard
to distinguish from the direct impact of human activities on the habitats they occupy [45].
The introduction of alien species into Hong Kong has increased the biodiversity and has
resulted in no serious impacts on the local ecology. However, invasions by alien species are a
potential conservation management problem that has received almost no attention in Hong
Kong. Even if we ignore the risk posed by aliens to the ecology of Hong Kong, we have an
obligation to ensure that the territory does not become a stepping-stone for invasion
elsewhere.
3. ASSESSMENT OF RIVER ECOSYSTEMS
3.1. Indicator Species
Complete measurement of the state of a river ecosystem, or even a complete census of all of
the species present, is not feasible. Thus, good indicators of the system conditions are efﬁcient
in the sense that they summarize the health of the overall system. The current value of an
indicator for an impaired river ecosystem can be compared to a previously measured,
pre-impact value, a desired future value, an observed value at an “unimpaired” reference
site, or a normative value for that class of river ecosystems. For example, an index of species
composition based on the presence or absence of a set of sensitive species might be generally
correlated with water quality. If a river is polluted, some species may be absent and the
number of species may be less than that before the pollution. An index of indicator species
itself provides no information on how water quality should be improved. However, the
success of management actions in improving water quality could be tracked and evaluated
through iterative measurement of the index.
An indicator species group is deﬁned as a set of organisms whose characteristics (e.g.,
number of species, presence or absence, population density, dispersion, reproductive success)
are used as an index of attributes or environmental conditions of interest, which are too

peak interest period using aquatic and terrestrial indicator species for assessment of ecosys-
tems. During that time, Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) were developed by the US Fish
and Wildlife Service, and the use of management indicator species was mandated by law with
passage of the National Forest Management Act in 1976. Since that time, numerous authors
have expressed concern about the ability of indicator species to meet the expectations
expressed in the above deﬁnition. Landres et al. (1988) critically evaluated the use of
vertebrate species as ecological indicators and suggested that rigorous justiﬁcation and
evaluation are needed before the concept is used [46].
Indicator species have been used to predict environmental contamination, population
trends, and habitat quality. The assumptions implicit in using indicators are that if the habitat
is suitable for the indicator, it is also suitable for other species and that wildlife populations
reﬂect habitat conditions. However, because each species has unique life requisites, the
relationship between the indicator and its guild may not be completely reliable. It is also
difﬁcult to include all the factors that might limit a population when selecting a group of
species that an indicator is expected to represent.
3.1.1. Selection of Indicator Species
Several factors are important to consider in the selection process of indicator species [30]:
1.
Sensitivity of the species to the environmental attribute being evaluated. When possible, data that
suggest a cause-and-effect relation are preferred to mere correlation (to ensure the indicator
reﬂects the variable of interest).
2.
Indicator accurately and precisely responds to the measured effect. High variation statistically
limits the ability to detect effects. Generalist species do not reﬂect change as well as more sensitive
endemics. However, because specialists usually have lower populations, they might not be the best
for cost-effective sampling. When the goal of monitoring is to evaluate on-site conditions, using
indicators that occur only within the site makes sense. However, although permanent residents
may better reﬂect local conditions, the goal of many riparian restoration efforts is to provide
habitat for migratory birds. In this case, residents such as cardinals or woodpeckers might not serve
as good indicators for migrating warblers.
3.
Size of the species home range. If possible, the home range should be larger than that of other
species in the evaluation area. Game species are often poor indicators simply because their
populations are highly inﬂuenced by hunting mortality, which can mask environmental effects.
Species with low populations or restrictions on sampling methods, such as threatened and
endangered species, are also poor indicators because they are difﬁcult to sample adequately.
4.
Response uniformity in different geographic locations. Response of an indicator species to an
environmental stress cannot be expected to be consistent across varying geographic locations or
habitats. If possible, the response to a stress should be more uniform than that of other species in
different geographic locations.
In summary, a good indicator species should be in the middle on the food chain to respond
quickly and have relatively high stability, should have a narrow tolerance to stresses, and
should be a native species [47]. The selection of indicator species should be done through
corroborative research.

3.1.2. Aquatic Macroinvertebrates
Aquatic macroinvertebrates have been used as indicators of stream and riparian health
for many years. Perhaps more than other taxa, they are closely tied to both aquatic and
riparian habitat. Their life cycles usually include periods in and out of the water, with ties
to riparian vegetation for feeding, pupation, emergence, mating, and egg laying [47]. It is
often important to look at the entire assemblage of aquatic invertebrates as an indicator group.
Impacts of stresses to a stream often decrease biodiversity but might increase the abundance
of some species [48]. Using benthic macroinvertebrates is advantageous for the following
reasons: (a) they are good indicators of localized conditions, (b) they integrate the effects of
short-term environmental variables, (c) degraded conditions are easily detected, (d) sampling
is relatively easy, (e) they are in the middle of the food chain and provide food for many ﬁsh of
commercial or recreational importance, and (f) macroinvertebrates are generally abundant
[49–51].
Field sampling of macroinvertebrates usually requires a combination of quantitative and
qualitative collection methods. The sampling may be performed for one site in a 100-m stretch
with representative areas of ﬂow velocity, water depth, substrata composition, and hydrophyte
growth. For a segment of an investigated stream, collections were made in areas with different
current velocity, water depth, and different substrate sizes. At least three replicate samples
were collected at each sampling site at appropriate depths of 0.15 m of the substrate with a
kick-net (1 m  1 m area, 420-μm mesh) if the water depth is less than 0.7 m. A D-frame dip
net may be used to sample along stone surfaces and in plant clusters. If the water depth is
greater than 0.7 m, samples may be collected with a Peterson grab sampler with an open area
of 1/16 m2. Replicate samples for each site are combined to form a composite sample,
amounting to at least a minimum area of 1 m2 [52]. The cobbles sampled are generally
scrubbed by hand to remove invertebrates and then discarded. The debris and invertebrates are
rinsed vigorously through a ﬁne sieve with a 300-μm mesh. Then the macroinvertebrates are
taken from the debris and are placed in plastic sample containers and preserved in 10 %
formaldehyde in the ﬁeld.
Environmental parameters, including substrate composition, water depth, water tempera-
ture, average current velocity, and dissolved oxygen concentration, are usually measured and
recorded in situ. Growth and cover proportion of aquatic hydrophytes are also described. All
macroinvertebrates are picked out of the samples and then identiﬁed and counted under a
stereoscopic microscope in the laboratory. Macroinvertebrates are identiﬁed most to family or
genus level except early-instar insects [53], and each species is assigned to an FFG based on
the literature [49, 54].
3.1.3. Fish
Fish are also used as indicator species. Some management agencies use ﬁsh species as
indicators to track changes in habitat condition or to assess the inﬂuence of habitat alteration
on selected species. Habitat suitability indices and other habitat models are often used for this
purpose, though the metric chosen to measure a species’ response to its habitat can inﬂuence
the outcome of the investigation. As van Horne (1983) pointed out, density or number of ﬁsh
River Ecology
193

may be misleading indicators of habitat quality. Fish response guilds as indicators of resto-
ration success in riparian ecosystems may be a valuable monitoring tool [55].
Hocutt (1981) states “perhaps the most compelling ecological factor is that structurally and
functionally diverse ﬁsh communities both directly and indirectly provide evidence of water
quality in that they incorporate all the local environmental perturbations into the stability of
the communities themselves.” The advantages of using ﬁsh as indicators are as follows:
(a) they are good indicators of long-term effects and broad habitat conditions, (b) ﬁsh
communities represent a variety of trophic levels, (c) ﬁsh are at the top of the aquatic food
chain and are consumed by humans, (d) ﬁsh are relatively easy to identify, and (e) water
quality standards are often characterized in terms of ﬁsheries. However, using ﬁsh as
indicators is inconvenient because (a) the cost of collection is high, (b) long-term monitoring
and a large number of samplings are needed to have reliable results and statistical validity
may be hard to attain, and (c) the process of sampling may disturb the ﬁsh community [56].
Electroﬁshing is the most commonly used ﬁeld technique. Each collecting station should
be representative of the study reach and similar to other reaches sampled; effort between
reaches should be equal. All ﬁsh species, not just game species, should be collected for the ﬁsh
community assessment. Karr et al. (1986) used 12 biological metrics to assess biotic integrity
using taxonomic and trophic composition and condition and abundance of ﬁsh [57]. The
assessment method using ﬁsh as indicator has been studied and applied in many large
rivers [49].
3.1.4. Birds and Mammals
Birds and mammals are used as indicator species for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosys-
tems. Croonquist et al. (1991) evaluated the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on small
mammals and birds along Pennsylvania waterways [58]. They evaluated species in ﬁve
different response guilds, including wetland dependency, trophic level, species status (endan-
gered, recreational, native, exotic), habitat speciﬁcity, and seasonality. The habitat speciﬁcity
and seasonality response guilds for birds were best able to distinguish those species sensitive
to disturbance from those which were not affected or beneﬁted. Edge and exotic species were
greater in abundance in the disturbed habitats and might serve as good indicators there.
Seasonality analysis showed migrant breeders were more common in undisturbed areas,
which, as suggested by Verner (1984), indicate the ability of guild analysis to distinguish
local impacts [59].
In general the advantages of using birds and mammals as indicator species are that (a) they
are good indicators of long-term effects and broad habitat conditions, including terrestrial and
aquatic ecosystems; (b) they are at the top of the food chain; (c) they are relatively easy to
identify; and (d) some restoration projects aim at restoration of endangered birds and
mammals. The disadvantages are that (a) the cost of collection is high, (b) long-term
monitoring is needed to have reliable results, and (c) they are not sensitive to aquatic habitat
conditions (e.g., hydrologic changes or water pollution). Birds have been used as indicator
species for ecological assessment of wetlands.

3.1.5. Algae
Algae communities are also useful for bioassessment. Algae generally have short life spans
and rapid reproduction rates, making them useful for evaluating short-term impacts. Sampling
impacts are minimal to resident biota, and collection requires little effort. Primary produc-
tivity of algae is affected by physical and chemical impairments. Algal communities are
sensitive to some pollutants that might not visibly affect other aquatic communities. Algal
communities can be examined for species, diversity indices, species richness, community
respiration, and colonization rates. A variety of nontaxonomic evaluations, such as biomass
and chlorophyll, may be used and are summarized in Weitzel [60]. Rodgers et al. (1979)
describe functional measurements of algal communities, such as primary productivity and
community respiration, to evaluate the effects of nutrient enrichment [61].
Although collecting algae in streams requires little effort, identifying for metrics, such as
diversity indices and species richness, may require considerable effort. A great deal of effort
may be expended to document diurnal and seasonal variations in productivity.
3.2. Metrics of Biodiversity
3.2.1. Richness and Abundance
If an indicator species group is selected, the ecosystem can be assessed by monitoring some
variables of the indicator species group, including the species richness, S; the number density
(or abundance), N, which is the total number of individuals per area; the biomass (the total
weight of all individuals) per area; and the number of individuals per area for each species.
Many parameters representing biodiversity of river ecosystems have been proposed. The
species richness, S, is the most widely used index [62] and the most important characteristic of
biodiversity:
S ¼ total number of species in the samples from a sampling site:
ð3:1Þ
The ecological assessment and habitat conditions of streams may be mainly represented by
the species richness. In general, the samples should be identiﬁed to species level for all
species. Nevertheless, it is often not possible because to identify some species special
instruments and experienced biologists are needed. In this case these species may be identiﬁed
to genus level or family level. This does not affect the ecosystem assessment if the samples
before and after the disturbance are examined by the same biologist and to the same level.
A simple measure of richness is most often used in conservation biology studies because the
many rare species that characterize most systems are generally of greater interest than the
common species that dominate in diversity indices and because accurate population density
estimates are often not available [63].
In general there are more species within large areas than within small areas. The relation
between species richness, S, and habitat area, A, follows a power function formula [64]:
S ¼ cAz
ð3:2Þ
River Ecology
195

where c and z are constants ﬁtted to data. Analysis of species-area relations revealed that most
values of z fall within the range 0.20–0.35 for birds and ﬁsh and within the range 0.05–0.2 for
benthic macroinvertebrates. For example, for the land-bird fauna of the West Indies, species
richness increases from only 16 within an area of 10 km2 to about 100 within an area of about
100,000 km2. The relation between S and A is then [64]:
S ¼ 10A0:24
ð3:3Þ
The species richness increases with habitat area because habitat heterogeneity increases
with the size of the area (and resulting topographic heterogeneity) of islands in the west
Indies, and larger islands make better targets for potential immigrants from mainland sources
of colonization. In addition, the larger populations on larger islands probably persist longer,
being endowed with greater genetic diversity, broader distributions over area and habitat, and
numbers large enough to prevent chance extinction.
The ﬁsh community, like birds, also occurs in a large area of habitat, and the sampling area
must be large enough to a have reliable value of S. As a comparison, the macroinvertebrate
community is more localized and needs much less sampling area for assessment of local
ecosystems. If a river ecosystem with high heterogeneity of habitat is assessed with
macroinvertebrates as indicator species, numerous sampling sites should be selected to
represent different habitat conditions. For each sampling site the sampling area may be one
or several m2. The workload increases with the sampling area; therefore, ecologists prefer
small sampling areas as long as a sufﬁcient number of species can be sampled. Figure 3.25
shows the relation between the number of species in a sample and the sampling area at each
site [52]. The sampling area at each site should be at least 1 m2 for a relatively reliable value of
richness.
The number density of individuals (abundance), N, is generally dynamic. If a
bio-community colonizes a habitat at time t0, the number density increases with time t and
ﬁnally reaches equilibrium after a period of time. A differential equation describing the
dynamic process of the number density growth is suggested [64]:
dN
dt ¼ rN 1  N
K

in which r represents the intrinsic exponential growth rate of the population when its size is
very small (i.e., close to 0), and K is the carrying capacity of the environment, which
represents the number of individuals that the environment can support. This equation is called
the logistic equation. So long as N does not exceed the carrying capacity K, that is, N/K is less
than 1, the number density continues to increase, albeit at a slowing rate. When N exceeds the
value of K, the ratio N/K exceeds 1, dN/dt becomes negative, and the density decreases. K is
the eventual equilibrium size of number density growing according to the logistic equation.
Integration of the logistic equation yields
N ¼
K
1 þ KN0
N0 ert
ð3:5Þ
where N0 is the number density of individuals at time t ¼ 0. The logistic equation may be
used for a species, e.g., black carp in Dongting Lake, or for a bio-community, e.g., benthic
macroinvertebrates at a section of a stream.
The abundance (density number) of a particular species reﬂects the balance between a large
number of factors and processes, variations in each of which result in small increments or
decrements in abundance. Population distribution models account for the evenness (equita-
bility) of distribution of species, which ﬁt various distributions to known models, such as the
geometric series, log series, lognormal, or broken stick. In a large sample of individuals,
species often distribute themselves normally over the logarithmic abundance categories.
3.2.2. Diversity Indices
Not all species should contribute equally to the estimate of total diversity, because their
functional roles in the community vary, to some degree, in proportion to their overall abun-
dance. Ecologists have formulated several diversity indices in which the contribution of each
species is weighted by its relative abundance. Three such indices are widely used in ecology:
Simpson’s index, Margalef index, and the Shannon-Weaver index. Simpson’s index is
D ¼
X
S
i¼1
ni2
N2


"
#1
ð3:6Þ
in which ni is the number of individuals of the i-th species and N is the total number of
individuals in the sample.
For any particular number of species in a sample (S), the value of D can vary from 1 to S,
depending on the evenness of species abundances.
The Margalef index is deﬁned as the total number of species present and the abundance or
total number of individuals. The higher is the index, the greater the diversity. The Margalef
index M is given [65]:

species richness and evenness of the abundance distribution, is given [66]:

ð3:8Þ
The Shannon-Weaver index provides no information on the total abundance of the
bio-community. For instance, samples from two sites have the same number of species, the
distributions are also the same, but the density of individuals for site one is 10 ind/m2 and for
site two is 100 ind/m2. Equation (3.8) gives the same values of H. The difference in population
density for the two cases is large, but it is not reﬂected by the values of H. Considering both
the abundance and biodiversity, the following bio-community index is suggested [67]:
B ¼ H ln N ¼ lnN

Macroinvertebrates census data from nine sites along the East River in south China can be
used to illustrate these different methods of presentation, as listed in Table 3.2 [68]. The East
River is 562 km long and has a drainage area of 35,340 km2. The river is one of the three
major rivers of the Pearl River system—the largest system in south China. The Fenshuba Dam
is a hydropower project on the river dividing the upper and middle reaches of the river and is
382 km from the river mouth. Figure 3.26 shows the variation of the species richness, S;
number density of individual invertebrates, N; Shannon-Weaver index, H; and the
bio-community index, B, from upper to lower reaches along the course. In general the
richness, S; the density, N; Shannon-Weaver index, H; and the bio-community index, B, of
benthic invertebrates reduce from the upper to the lower reaches. The Fenshuba Dam causes
instantaneous ﬂuctuation in ﬂow discharge and velocity, which strongly impacts the inverte-
brates. Therefore, only one species, Palaemonidae, which may survive the ﬂuctuation, was
found at the site downstream of the dam. The impact of velocity ﬂuctuation becomes weak
further downstream from the dam and exhibits no inﬂuence on the benthic invertebrates at a
distance of 80 km from the dam.
In the lower reaches the channel has been regulated with relatively uniform width, and the
banks have been hardened with concrete and stones. Flow velocity in the channel is more
uniform than the upper reaches, and the substrate consists of only sand. The sand bed is
compact, which provides no space for benthic animals to live and no shelter for the animals to
escape current. The richness, number density, and biodiversity and bio-community indices in
the lower reaches are very low or zero. Humans have reclaimed river bays, riparian lakes and
wetlands, and sluggish and backwater zones, which caused loss of habitat and made formerly
diversiﬁed habitats very uniform and unitary. In general, the biodiversity and bio-community
indices are proportional to the diversity of habitats. The habitat loss and low diversity of
habitats result in low biodiversity and bio-community.

Biodiversity of macroinvertebrates in different types of abandoned channels was different,
which is also due to different riverbed habitats. There are four types of abandoned channels:
old river courses, oxbow lakes, oxtail lakes, and riparian wetlands, which result from
avulsions, meander cutoffs, ice-jam ﬂoods, and stem-channel shifts, respectively. These
posterior three types belong to freshwater ecosystems. Oxbow lakes result from the natural
cutoff of meanders. In meandering rivers, a continuing increase in the amplitude and
tightness of bends may result in a threshold sinuosity at which the river can no longer
maintain its shape and a cutoff develops. Oxbow lakes may also result from artiﬁcial cutoffs.
In general, artiﬁcial cutoffs cause intensive erosion in the new channel in the ﬁrst several
years of formation. The new channel is not stable during the intensive ﬂuvial process. Oxtail
lakes are generated from the ﬂuvial process of anastomosing rivers. In northeast China, some
rivers ﬂow from south to north. When the northern section of the river freezes, the water will

still ﬂow upstream to the north. This forms anastomosing rivers, which are not very stable. If
one of the parallel channels is scoured deeper than the others, all available water may ﬂow
into this channel and abandon the others. The lower part of the abandoned channel remains
connected with the main channel and becomes a channel-shaped lake. These lakes are
different from the oxbow lakes in shape and origin and are named as such because they
look like oxtails. Many riparian wetlands result from the shifting of channels. Sediment is
then deposited in wide river sections and forms bars. Under some circumstances, one channel
of braided river develops into the main channel, and the other channels and the bars become a
wetland.
Field investigations were carried out in the Yellow River, Songhua River basin, and East
River. The locations of the study areas and sampling sites are shown in Fig. 3.27. Environ-
mental conditions of the sampling sites and macroinvertebrate biodiversity are given in
Table 3.3. It can be found that East River that is freely connected with the mainstream was
characterized by the highest biodiversity. Species diversity can also be assessed using
K-dominant curves, which combines the two aspects of diversity-species richness and even-
ness. Using this method, dominance patterns can be represented by plotting the accumulative

abundance of each species (%) ranked in decreasing order of dominance. The lower curve
indicates even individual distribution and higher biodiversity. Figure 3.28 shows K-dominant
curves of macroinvertebrates in abandoned channels and their adjoining rivers. Figure 3.28
reports similar results as shown in Table 3.3. The different biodiversity of these channels was
ascribed to different habitat conditions.
As indicated in the previous section, biological diversity refers mainly to the number of
species in an area or region and includes a measure of the variety of species in a community
that takes into account the relative abundance of each species [69]. When measuring diversity,
it is important to clearly deﬁne the biological objectives, stating exactly what attributes of the
system are of concern and why [70]. Different measures of diversity can be applied at various
levels of complexity, to different taxonomic groups, and at distinct spatial scales.
Overall diversity within any given level of complexity may be of less concern than
diversity of a particular subset of species or habitats. Measures of overall diversity include
all of the elements of concern and do not provide information about the occurrence of speciﬁc
elements. For example, measures of overall species diversity do not provide information
about the presence of individual species, such as Chinese sturgeon, or species groups of
management concern. Thus, for a speciﬁc ecological restoration project, measurement of
diversity may be limited to a target group of special concern.

3.2.3. Alpha and Beta Diversities
Diversity can be measured within the bounds of a single community, across community
boundaries, or in large areas encompassing many communities. Diversity within a relatively
homogeneous community is known as alpha diversity, or local diversity. Usually the diversity
indices obtained by examining the samples taken from one site are referred to as alpha
diversity. Diversity between communities in a region, described as the amount of differenti-
ation along habitat gradients, is termed beta diversity, or regional diversity. For instance, the
total number of species from numerous sites along a stream is the regional diversity of the
stream. Beta diversity may be large in river-lake connected habitats with high heterogeneity,
because some species colonize stream habitat and very different species may live in the
riparian lakes.
Noss and Harris (1986) note that management for alpha diversity may increase local
species richness, while the regional landscape (gamma diversity) may become more

homogeneous and less diverse overall [71]. They recommend a goal of maintaining the
regional species pool in an approximately natural relative abundance pattern. The speciﬁc
size of the area of concern should be deﬁned when diversity objectives are established.
A beta diversity index is given by the following formula:
β ¼
M
1
S
X
S
i¼1
mi
ð3:10Þ
in which M is the number of sampled habitats in a region, e.g., the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River; mi is the number of habitats, in which the i-th species is found; and S is the
total number of species found at all sampling sites in the region. If the species in all sites are
the same, or mi ¼ M, the beta diversity index is 1. If all species occur at only one site, mi ¼ 1,
the beta diversity index equals M. The total number of species, S, in the region is then the
product of the average species richness by the beta diversity index.
The ecological implication of beta diversity may be seen from the example of preliminary
assessment of aquatic ecology of the source region of the Yellow River. The benthic
macroinvertebrates were sampled at 8 sites with different environmental conditions in the
source region of the Yellow River from Aug. 7 to Aug. 15, 2009. Figure 3.29 shows the
location of 8 sampling sites. Samples were taken from ﬁve sites from the Yellow River and
riparian waters. In addition, samples were taken from a small stream on the plateau, the Eling
Lake, and the Qinghai Lake. The sampling method is as follows: (1) in mountain streams with
gravel beds, the gravels were washed and sieved with a kick-net with holes of 0.5 mm and
organic and inorganic detritus with macroinvertebrates collected. The detritus was subse-
quently placed on a white tray, and the invertebrates were collected. Invertebrate species were
thereafter examined and identiﬁed to family or genus level under a microscope. The sampled
area was 1.5 m2 consists of three subsampling areas in order to reﬂect diversiﬁed ecological
conditions. After sampling, macroinvertebrates and associated material were immediately
preserved in ethanol and were subsequently processed and identiﬁed in the laboratory. There
is little pollution and the water quality is very good.
In general, the community of benthic invertebrates is different if the environmental
conditions are different. The main environmental factors for benthic invertebrates are stream
substrate, water depth, ﬂow velocity, and water quality [72]. At the site ①the Zequ River is a
tributary of the Yellow River with meandering channel. In its drainage area there are
numerous swamps and rivulets with small but stable ﬂow. The rivulets wriggle on vast
meadows with grass coverage almost 100 %. The site of streamlet represents the habitat
type. Near the Yellow River by Kesheng town (site ②), there is an oxbow lake (site ③),
which is an abandoned channel of the Yellow River and has been cut off from the river for a
very long period of time. The site ④is a riparian lake, which may connect with the Yellow
River during high ﬂoods. The Dari bay ⑤is a riparian wetland where the Yellow River ﬂows
from a normal channel to a very wide valley with shallow water. The main water ﬂow has a
deep channel, but plume of low sediment concentration drifts into the bay. The site ⑥is a
204
Z.-Y. Wang and B.-Z. Pan

wetland by the Yellow River. The Eling Lake ⑦is the source of the Yellow River with a
capacity of 10 billion m3. The pool level in the lake is not stable depending on the incoming
water and operation of a hydropower station just below it. The water level had been rising
since a month before the ﬁeld investigation. The Qinghai Lake has brackish water with low
concentration of salt. It is near by the source of the Yellow River and represents a type of
habitat in the region.
Table 3.4 lists the species of macroinvertebrates identiﬁed from the samples of each site
with the number density (ind/m2) of each species in the parentheses. The taxa richness, or the
number of species at each site, S, and the calculated biodiversity index B are listed in the table.
Altogether 48 species of macroinvertebrates belonging to 24 families and 44 genera were
identiﬁed. The average density and wet biomass of macroinvertebrates in the eight sampling
stations were 360 ind/m2 and 2.3934 g/m2, respectively. Insects were predominant group,
being 77.1 % of the total in taxa number, 82.7 % in density, and 88.6 % in wet biomass.
Figure 3.30 shows the representative species of macroinvertebrate in the sampling sites,
which are dominant species or typical species at each site.

The taxa richness S and the index B at each site are not high. In other words, the
biodiversity of the sampling sites is not high. The streamlet and Qinghai Lake have only
6 species and both dominated by Amphipoda. The oxbow lake has the highest biodiversity,
with 20 species and bio-community index about 12. In general, cobble, gravel, and aquatic
plants are the best substrates for benthic invertebrates. The oxbow lake, the isolated riparian
lake at Dari, and the Yellow River channel at meanders have relatively stable environment
and have multiple habitats with different substrates; therefore, they have high biodiversity.
The Dari bay is an open shallow water connecting the Yellow River, its substrate consists of
only ﬂuid mud, and the sediment from the river drifting into the bay may change the ﬂuid mud
surface layer; thus, it has relatively low biodiversity. Moreover, the species composition in the
oxbow lake and riparian lake is quite different from the river and bay. These riparian waters
are important in aquatic biodiversity.

The value of beta diversity was calculated for the source region of the Yellow River. The
total number of sampled habitats is 8, so the value of M is 8 in (3.10). Calculation with the
sampled species from the 8 habitats yields the beta diversity equal to 5.33, which is 66.7 % of
the maximum value. As a comparison, ﬁeld investigations were paid to the Juma River in the

suburbs of Beijing from Shidu to Yesanpo with a length of about 70 km. The river is a
mountain stream with beautiful landscapes and good aquatic ecology. The river reach from
Shidu to Yesanpo is a main tourist attraction for Beijing people. Samples of benthic inverte-
brates were taken from eight sites with different habitats, including gravel bed with turbulent
ﬂow, riparian wetland with lentic water, branch channel with low velocity ﬂow, and pool
behind weir. The substrates at the sampling sites were different, varying from gravel, cobbles,
sand, and macrophytes. The average taxa richness for the 8 different habitats was 19.4, and the
highest taxa richness was 28. The total number of species was 54. The average value of index
B for the 8 habitats was 10 and the highest value of B was 16. All the 8 habitats have high local
biodiversity (alpha biodiversity). Nevertheless, the species compositions at different sites
were rather similar. The beta diversity for the Juma River was only 2.7. The beta diversity for
the source region of the Yellow River is two times of the Juma River. Ecological management
or restoration in the region must base on an overall consideration of various habitats in the
region.
3.2.4. Indices of Biotic Integrity
Karr’s IBI
Fish represent the top of the aquatic food chain, and, thus, the quality and composition of
the ﬁsh community comprise the best measure of the overall health of the aquatic community.
This is because the ﬁsh community integrates the effects of the entire suite of physical,
chemical, and biological stresses on the ecosystem. A ﬁsh community index should include at
least one metric for each of the ﬁve attributes of ﬁsh assemblages [73]: species richness and
condition, indicator species, trophic function, reproduction function, and individual abun-
dance and condition.
Considering the foregoing considerations, Karr (1981) proposed and revised the Index of
Biotic Integrity (IBI) to evaluate stream quality at the ﬁsh community level [74]. The Karr’s
IBI is comprised of 12 metrics to deﬁne ﬁsh community structure. The index accounts for
changes in ﬁsh community richness and allows for comparison of ﬁsh community composi-
tion with values for similar-sized streams. The applicability of the IBI concept has been
demonstrated in a wide variety of stream types [75]. As recommended by Karr et al. [57], IBI
metrics require adjustment for the region to which the index is applied. The basic components
of Karr’s index are listed in Table 3.5. It is recognized that stream size is an important factor
when reﬁning the IBI to a geographic region.
The deﬁnitions of the 12 metrics are described as follows [57, 76]:
Total number of species—The total number of species collected at a site, excluding hybrids
and subspecies. The number of ﬁsh species supported by streams of a given size in a given
region decreases with environmental degradation, if other features are similar.
Number of darter species—The total number of darter species (family Percidae) collected,
excluding hybrids. Darters are small benthic species that tend to be intolerant of many types of
environmental degradation. They are mainly insectivorous, and for many of them rifﬂes or
runs are preferred habitats. These species are sensitive to degradation, particularly as a result
208
Z.-Y. Wang and B.-Z. Pan

of their need to reproduce and feed in benthic habitats. Such habitats are degraded by
channelization, siltation, and reduction in oxygen content.
Number of sunﬁsh species—The total of sunﬁsh species (family Centrarchidae), including
rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) and crappies (Pomoxis species), but excluding hybrids and
black basses (Micropterus salmoides). Sunﬁsh are medium sized, mid-water species, which
tend to occur in pools or other shallow-moving water. Most, but not all, are tolerant of
environmental degradation. All feed on a variety of invertebrates, although some larger adults
may eat ﬁsh. Sunﬁsh are included in the index because they are particularly responsive to the
degradation of pool habitats and to other aspects of habitat such as instream cover.
Number of sucker species—The total number of sucker species (family Catostomidae)
collected, excluding hybrids. Suckers are large benthic species that generally live in pools
or runs, although a few species are common in rifﬂes. Some species are intolerant of
environmental degradation, whereas others are tolerant. Most species feed on insects,
although a few also eat large quantities of detritus or plankton. Suckers are included in the
index because many of these species are intolerant to degradation of habitat or chemical
quality. Also, the longevity of suckers provides a multiyear integrative perspective.
Number of intolerant species—The total number of species, excluding hybrids, which are
intolerant of environmental degradation, particularly poor water quality, siltation and
increased turbidity, and reduced heterogeneity (e.g., channelization). Intolerant species are

among the ﬁrst to be decimated after perturbation to habitat or water quality, and the species
identiﬁed in metrics 2–4 may be included in this group.
Proportion of individuals as green sunﬁsh—In the Midwestern USA, the green sunﬁsh
(Lepomis cyanellus) increases in relative abundance in degraded streams and may increase
from an incidental to the dominant species. Thus, this metric evaluates the degree to which
typically tolerant species dominate the community. In many other IBIs, tolerant species in the
sample are listed and the proportion of tolerant individuals in the sample is computed and used
as the metric in place of green sunﬁsh.
Proportion of individuals as omnivores—The number of individuals that belong to species
with an adult diet consisting of at least 25 % (by volume) plant material or detritus and at least
25 % live animal matter, expressed as a percentage of the total number of ﬁsh captured. By
deﬁnition, omnivores can subsist on a broad range of food items, and they are relatively
insensitive to the change in the food base of a stream caused by environmental degradation.
Hybrids are included in this metric if both of the parental species are considered omnivores.
The dominance of omnivores occurs as speciﬁc components of the food base become less
reliable, and the opportunistic foraging habits of omnivores make them more successful than
specialized foragers.
Proportion of individuals as insectivorous cyprinids—Cyprinids that belong to species with
an adult diet normally dominated by aquatic or terrestrial insects, expressed as a percentage of
the total number of ﬁsh captured. Although insectivorous cyprinids are a dominant trophic
group in streams in the Midwestern USA, their relative abundance decreases with degrada-
tion, probably in response to variability in the insect supply, which in turn reﬂects alterations
of water quality, energy sources, or instream habitat. In other regions the proportion of total
insectivores to total individuals may provide better information for this metric with a resetting
of the scoring criteria.
Proportion of individuals as piscivores (top carnivores)—The number of individuals that
belong to species with an adult diet dominated by vertebrates (especially ﬁsh) or decapod
crustacea (e.g., crayﬁsh, shrimp), expressed as a percentage of the total number of ﬁsh
captured. Some species feed on invertebrates and ﬁsh as fry and juveniles. Hybrids are
included in this metric only if both of the parental species are carnivores. Viable and healthy
populations of top carnivores indicate a healthy, trophically diverse community.
Number of individuals in a sample—This metric evaluates populations and is expressed as
catch per unit of sampling effort. Effort may be expressed per unit area sampled, per length of
reach sampled, or per unit of time spent. In streams of a given size and with the same sampling
method and efﬁciency of effort, poorer sites are generally expected to yield fewer individuals
than sites of higher quality.
Proportion of individuals as hybrids—This metric is difﬁcult to determine from historic data
and is sometimes omitted for lack of data. Its primary purpose is to assess the extent to which
degradation has altered reproductive isolation among species. Hybridization may be common
among cyprinids after channelization, although difﬁculties in recognizing hybrids may
210
Z.-Y. Wang and B.-Z. Pan

preclude using this criterion with darters in addition to cyprinids. Sunﬁsh also hybridize quite
readily, and the frequency of their hybridization appears to increase with stream
modiﬁcations.
Proportion of individuals with disease, tumors, ﬁn damage, and skeletal anomalies (DELT)—
The number of individual ﬁsh with skeletal or scale deformities, heavily frayed or eroded ﬁns,
open skin lesions, or tumors that are apparent from external examination, expressed as a
percentage of the total number of ﬁsh captured. DELT ﬁsh are normally rare except at highly
degraded sites.
Sampling of ﬁsh to determine these metrics is done on a reach basis. In Wisconsin, for
example, a stream reach is deﬁned as a minimum of 35 times the mean stream width based on
at least 10 ﬁeld measurements per site [76]. The results of the reach sampling are combined to
deﬁne a sampling site.
IBI Examples
Karr’s IBI concept has been adapted and modiﬁed from its Midwestern USA beginnings
for application throughout the world. Some IBIs simply adjust the scoring criteria as appro-
priate for their region of application, whereas other IBIs have combined new metrics with
Karr’s metrics. More than 40 ﬁsh metrics have been utilized in the various IBIs used in the
USA [77].
The IBI developed for Taiwan [78] is an example, where the majority of Karr’s original
metrics (with slight modiﬁcations) were applied, but the scoring criteria were modiﬁed
(Table 3.6). Other than the scoring criteria modiﬁcations, the main differences in the Taiwan
IBI versus Karr’s IBI are the use of all insectivores and consideration of numbers of hybrids or
exotic species rather than the proportion of hybrids. Exotic species are species that are present
in a region through introduction by man or have recent invasions that would not have been

conditions categories: non-impaired ¼ 35–45, slightly impaired ¼ 23–34, moderately
impaired ¼ 15–22, and severely impaired ¼ 0–14.
Karr’s IBI and its many regional modiﬁcations for areas throughout the USA and around
the world have generally been well calibrated to small “wadable” streams, but applications in
larger rivers are less common [79]. Lyons et al. (2001) identiﬁed 7 IBIs developed for use in
large rivers and then developed IBIs for use in large rivers in Wisconsin. In this case large
rivers are deﬁned as having at least 3 km of contiguous river channel too deep to be effectively
sampled by wading. Lyons et al. (2001) used ﬁsh assemblage data from 155 main-channel-
border sites on 30 large warmwater rivers in Wisconsin (including 19 sites on the Mississippi
River) to construct, test, and apply large river IBIs. Fourteen sites were sampled more than
once for a total of 187 samples. Watershed drainage areas for these sites ranged from 349 to
218,890 km2. Lyons et al. (2001) used some of Karr’s original metrics while adding several
different metrics. A main difference is that instead of just considering the proportion of
individuals (i.e., numbers-based metrics), the large river IBI also considers the proportion of
ﬁsh by weight (i.e., biomass-based metrics). Such biomass-based metrics best reﬂect the
amount of energy ﬂow across trophic levels and functional groups, whereas number-based
metrics indicate the diversity of pathways that energy could follow and the potential for intra-
and interspeciﬁc interactions [79].
The large river IBI for southern Wisconsin is listed in Table 3.7. Deﬁnitions of some of the
“new” metrics are given as follows [76, 79]:
Weight per unit effort—Weight (biomass) to the nearest 0.1 kg of ﬁsh collected per 1,600 m of
shoreline, excluding tolerant species.

Total number of native species—The total number of species collected at a site, excluding
hybrids (which are common among sunﬁsh and certain minnow species) and exotic species.
Total number of riverine species—Number of species that are obligate stream or river
dwellers not normally found in lentic habitats.
Percent of individuals as simple lithophilous spawners—The number of individuals that
belong to species that lay their eggs on clean gravel or cobble and do not build a nest or
provide parental care, expressed as a percentage of the total number of ﬁsh captured. Simple
lithophilous species need clean substrates for spawning and are particularly sensitive to
sedimentation (embeddedness) of rocky substrates. Hybrids are included in this metric only
if both of the parental species are simple lithophilous species.
The total IBI scores then yield the following biological conditions categories: excellent ¼
>80, good ¼ 60–79, fair ¼ 40–69, poor ¼ 20–39, and very poor 20. Lyons et al. (2001)
found that the Wisconsin large river IBI was comparable to IBIs developed for use in large
rivers in Ohio (including data for the Ohio River) and Indiana [79]. The fact that the IBI
metrics in Table 3.7 reﬂect conditions on the Mississippi River and Ohio River indicates that
these metrics might be a good beginning point for developing IBIs for the other large rivers of
the world.
Uses of the IBI
IBIs provide a valuable framework for assessing the status and evaluating the restoration of
aquatic communities. IBIs encompass the structure, composition, and functional organization
of the biological community. IBIs can be viewed as quantitative empirical models for rating
the health of an aquatic ecosystem, providing a single, defensible, easily understood measure
of the overall health of a river reach in question [79]. For example, IBIs can be used to quickly
identify both high-quality reaches for protection and degraded sites for rehabilitation.
While total IBI scores can provide the user with an indication that a stream ﬁsh community
is potentially degraded by environmental stressors, the total score cannot provide the ability to
identify which individual stressors are causing the response. The same total IBI score can be
reached by an inﬁnite combination of individual metric scores, each with its own environ-
mental stressor. Thus, several researchers have focused not on the ﬁnal IBI score, but rather on
how the individual metrics can be used to describe the effects of anthropogenic stresses on the
ﬁsh community [80–83]. If relations between stresses and the ﬁsh community can be found,
ways to reduce these stresses and efﬁciently improve the ﬁsh community can be derived.
3.3. Bioassessment
3.3.1. Rapid Bioassessment
Rapid bioassessment techniques are most appropriate when restoration goals are
nonspeciﬁc and broad, such as improving the overall aquatic community or establishing a
more balanced and diverse community in the river ecosystem [30]. Bioassessment often refers
to use of biotic indices or composite analyses, such as those used by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency [84], and rapid bioassessment protocols (RBP), such as those documented
River Ecology
213

by Plafkin et al. [49]. The Ohio EPA evaluates biotic integrity by using an invertebrate
community index that emphasizes structural attributes of invertebrate communities and
compares the sample community with a reference or control community. The invertebrate
community index is based on 10 metrics that describe different taxonomic and pollution
tolerance relations within the macroinvertebrate community. The rapid bioassessment pro-
tocols established by the US Environmental Protection Agency were developed to provide
states with the technical information necessary for conducting cost-effective biological
assessments [49]. The RBP are divided into ﬁve sets of protocols, three for macroinvertebrates
and two for ﬁsh, as shown in Table 3.8.
The rapid bioassessment protocols RBP I to RBP III are for macroinvertebrates. RBP I is a
“screening” or reconnaissance-level analysis used to discriminate obviously impaired and
unimpaired sites from potentially affected areas requiring further investigation. RBP II and III
use a set of metrics based on taxon tolerance and community structure similar to the
invertebrate community index used by the State of Ohio. Both are more labor intensive
than RBP I and incorporate ﬁeld sampling. RBP II uses family-level taxonomy to determine
the following set of metrics used in describing the biotic integrity of a stream: (a) species
richness, (b) Hilsenhoff biotic index [85], (c) ratio of scrapers to ﬁltering collectors, (d) ratio
of Ephemeroptera/Plecoptera/Trichoptera (EPT) and chironomid abundances, (e) percent
contribution of dominant taxa, (f) EPT index, (g) community similarity index, and (h) ratio
of shredders to total number of individuals. RBP III further deﬁnes the level of biotic
impairment and is essentially an intensiﬁed version of RBP II that uses species-level taxon-
omy. As with the invertebrate community index, the RBP metrics for a site are compared to
metrics from a control or reference site.

3.3.2. Comparison Standard
With stream restoration activities, it is important to select a desired end condition for the
proposed management action. A predetermined standard of comparison provides a benchmark
against which to measure progress. For example, if the chosen diversity measure is native
species richness, the standard of comparison might be the maximum expected native species
richness for a deﬁned geographic area and time period. Historical conditions in the region
should be considered when establishing a standard of comparison. If current conditions in a
river are degraded, it may be best to establish the standard for a period in the past that
represented more natural or desired conditions. In some cases historical diversity might have
been less than current diversity due to changes in hydrology and encroachment of native and
exotic riparian vegetation in the ﬂoodplain [86]. Thus, it is important to agree on what
conditions are desired prior to establishing the standard of comparison.
For a hypothetical stream restoration initiative, the following biological diversity objective
might be developed. Assume that a primary concern in an area is conserving native amphibian
species and that 30 native species of amphibians have been known to occur historically in the
watershed. The objective could be to manage the river ecosystem to provide and maintain
suitable habitat for the 30 native amphibian species. River ecosystem restoration efforts must
be directed toward those factors that can be managed to increase diversity to the desired level.
Those factors might be the physical and structural features of the river ecosystem. Diversity
can be measured directly or predicted from other information. Direct measurement requires an
actual inventory of the element of diversity, such as counting the amphibian species in the
study area.
Direct measures of diversity are most helpful when baseline information is available for
comparing different sites. It is not possible, however, to directly measure certain attributes,
such as species richness or the population level of various species, for various future
conditions. Predicting diversity with a model is generally more rapid than directly measuring
diversity. In addition, predictive methods provide a means to analyze alternative future
conditions before implementing speciﬁc restoration plans. The reliability and accuracy of
diversity models should be established before their use.
3.3.3. Classiﬁcation Systems
The common goal of classiﬁcation systems is to organize variation. Classiﬁcation systems
include [30]:
1.
Geographic domain. The range of sites being classiﬁed varies from rivers of the world to local
differences in the composition and characteristics of patches within one reach of a single river.
2.
Variables considered. Some classiﬁcations are restricted to hydrology, geomorphology, and
aquatic chemistry. Other community classiﬁcations are restricted to biotic variables of species
composition and abundance of a limited number of taxa. Many classiﬁcations include both abiotic
and biotic variables. Even purely abiotic classiﬁcation systems are relevant to biological evalua-
tions because of the important correlations (e.g., the whole concept of physical habitat) between
abiotic structure and community composition.
3.
Incorporation of temporal relations. Some classiﬁcations focus on describing correlations and
similarities across sites at one, perhaps idealized, point in time. Other classiﬁcations identify
River Ecology
215

explicit temporal transitions among classes, for example, succession of biotic communities or
evolution of geomorphic landforms.
4.
Focus on structural variation or functional behavior. Some classiﬁcations emphasize a parsimo-
nious description of observed variation in the classiﬁcation variables. Others use classiﬁcation
variables to identify types with different behaviors. For example, a vegetation classiﬁcation can be
based primarily on patterns of species co-occurrence, or it can be based on similarities in
functional effect of vegetation on habitat value.
5.
The extent to which management alternatives or human actions are explicitly considered as
classiﬁcation variables. To the extent that these variables are part of the classiﬁcation itself, the
classiﬁcation system can directly predict the result of a management action. For example, a
vegetation classiﬁcation based on grazing intensity would predict a change from one class of
vegetation to another class based on a change in grazing management.
Comparison of the degraded system to an actual unimpacted reference site, to the ideal type in
a classiﬁcation system, or to a range of similar systems can provide a framework for
articulating the desired state of the degraded system. However, the desired state of the system
is a management objective that ultimately comes from outside the classiﬁcation of system
variability.
3.3.4. Analyses of Species Requirements
Analyses of species requirements involve explicit statements of how variables interact to
determine habitat or how well a system provides for the life requisites of ﬁsh and wildlife
species. Complete speciﬁcation of relations between all relevant variables and all species in a
river system is not possible. Thus, analyses based on species requirements focus on one or
more target species or groups of species. In a simple case, this type of analysis may be based
on an explicit statement of the physical factors that distinguish good habitat for a species
(places where it is most likely to be found or where it best reproduces) from poor
habitat (places where it is unlikely to be found or reproduces poorly). In more complicated
cases, such approaches incorporate variables beyond those of purely physical habitat, includ-
ing other species that provide food or biotic structure, other species as competitors or
predators, or spatial or temporal patterns of resource availability.
Analyses based on species requirements differ from synthetic measures of system condi-
tion in that they explicitly incorporate relations between “causal” variables and desired
biological attributes. Such analyses can be used directly to decide what restoration actions
will achieve a desired result and to evaluate the likely consequences of a proposed restoration
action. For example, an analysis using the habitat evaluation procedures might identify mast
production (the accumulation of nuts from a productive fruiting season which serves as a food
source for animals) as a factor limiting squirrel populations. If squirrels are a species of
concern, at least some parts of the stream restoration effort should be directed toward
increasing mast production. In practice, this logical power is often compromised by incom-
plete knowledge of the species habitat requirements.
The complexity of these methods varies along a number of important dimensions, includ-
ing prediction of habitat suitability versus population numbers, analysis for a single place and
single time versus a temporal sequence of spatially complex requirements, and analysis for a
216
Z.-Y. Wang and B.-Z. Pan

single target species versus a set of target species involving trade-offs. Each of these
dimensions must be carefully considered in selecting an analysis procedure appropriate to
the problem at hand.
3.4. Habitat Evaluation and Modeling
3.4.1. Habitat Diversity
Habitat evaluation is an important aspect of bioassessment. Habitat has a deﬁnable
carrying capacity, or suitability, to support or produce wildlife populations [87]. The
capacity depends, to a great extent, on the habitat diversity. A habitat diversity index is
needed to represent this characteristic. The physical conditions of stream habitat are mainly
(1) the substrate, (2) water depth, and (3) ﬂow velocity [88]. Different physical conditions
support different bio-communities and diversiﬁed physical conditions may support diversi-
ﬁed bio-communities. A habitat diversity index, HD, is proposed as follows [67]:
HD ¼ NhNv
X
i
αi
ð3:11Þ
where Nh and Nv are numbers for water depth diversity and velocity diversity, and α is the
substrate diversity, which is different for different substrates. For water depth less than 0.1 m,
the habitat is colonized by species that like high concentrations of dissolved oxygen and
plenty of light. For water depth larger than 0.5 m, the habitat is colonized by species that like
low light and dissolved oxygen. Many species may live in water with depths between 0.1 and
0.5 m. If a stream has three water areas, (a) shallow water, in which the water depth is in the
range of 0–0.1 m; (b) mid-depth water, in which the water depth is in the range of 0.1–0.5 m;
and (c) deep water, in which water depth is larger than 0.5 m, and each of the three areas is
larger than 10 % of the stream water surface area, Nh ¼ 3. If a stream has only shallow water
and mid-depth water, and each of them is larger than 10 % of the stream water surface area,
Nh ¼ 2. The value of Nh for other cases can be analogously obtained. For ﬂow velocity less
than 0.3 m/s, the habitat is colonized by species that swim slowly. For velocity higher than
1 m/s, the habitat is colonized by species that like high velocities. Many species live in the
current between 0.3 and 1 m/s. If a stream has three water areas, (a) lentic area, in which
the ﬂow velocity is smaller than 0.3 m/s; (b) mid-velocity area, in which the ﬂow velocity is in
the range of 0.3–1 m/s; and (c) lotic area, in which the velocity is larger than 1 m/s, and each
of the three areas is larger than 10 % of the stream water surface area, Nv ¼ 3. If a stream has
only lentic and mid-velocity areas, and each of them is larger than 10 % of stream water,
Nv ¼ 2. The value of Nv for other cases can be analogously obtained.
The selection of the critical values of water depth and velocity is determined by studying
the habits of species, mainly of macroinvertebrates. It is found from ﬁeld investigations that in
the Yangtze River basin some species in the water depth between 0.1 and 0.5 m are different
from those in shallower or deeper water. Similarly, some species living in the current range of
0.3–1 m/s are different from those in currents lower than 0.3 m/s or higher than 1 m/s. Beauger
et al. (2006) reported that the highest species richness and density were found in various
River Ecology
217

substrates where the velocity ranged between 0.3 and 1.2 m/s and depths ranged from 0.16 to
0.5 m. Below 0.3 m/s the riverbed tends to be ﬁlled and not very productive, whereas above
1.2 m/s the current velocity acts as a constraint for most living material. Undoubtedly, at
lower depths, vegetation and animals are disturbed by light; conversely at higher depths in
which the primary productivity decreases, the bio-community is disturbed due to light
attenuation. At lower and higher depths and velocities, only those species tolerant to the
constraints may colonize the habitat [89].
Streambeds consisting of cobbles and boulders are very stable and provide the benthic
macroinvertebrates diversiﬁed living spaces. Therefore, cobbles and boulders are associated
with high habitat diversity. Stream ﬂow over aquatic grasses has high velocity, but the aquatic
grasses generate a low velocity canopy; moreover, the aquatic grasses themselves are also
habitat for some species. Thus, streams with aquatic grasses exhibit high habitat diversity.
Some species may move and live within the ﬂuid mud layer and consume the organic
materials in the mud layer. The interstices in a ﬁne gravel bed are small but sufﬁcient for
some species. A sand bed is compact, and the interstices between sand particles are too small
for big benthic macroinvertebrates to move and live within them. If sand particles are moving
as bed load, the bed provides no stable habitat for animals. Therefore, moving sand is the
worst habitat for benthic macroinvertebrates. Based on this discussion and ﬁeld investigations
of 16 streams, the α -values for various substrates are listed in Table 3.9. It is well known that
large woody debris can substantially contribute to habitat quality in streams [90, 91], and,
thus, a more generally applicable listing of α -values should also include a value for stream
substrates with large woody debris. However, large woody debris does not often occur in
Chinese streams; therefore, a rating for large woody debris has not been determined and is not
listed in Table 3.9.
If a part of the streambed consists of one substrate and another part consists of another
substrate and both parts have areas larger than one-tenth of the stream surface, the two α
-values for the two kinds of substrates should be summed. However, if sand or silt ﬁlls the
interstices of gravel, the α -value should be taken as for the substrate of sand or silt. If a
streambed has three parts with different substrates, boulders and cobbles, aquatic grasses, and
ﬂuid clay mud, and each of the three parts is larger than one-tenth of the total stream area, the
sum of the α -values for the stream is
X
i
αi ¼ 6 þ 5 þ 3 ¼ 14. If the streambed is covered by
moving sand and gravel or the bed is very unstable,
X
i
αi ¼ 0.
Gorman and Karr (1978) also developed a habitat diversity index combining the effects of
substrate, velocity, and depth [88]. They showed that ﬁsh species diversity and richness were
strongly related to a combination of the effects of substrate, velocity, and depth. Their
substrate classiﬁcation is similar to that proposed here with the main differences being in
the divisions of sediment sizes into the various classes, but a similar ordinal ranking is applied
to the substrate material. They also developed class ranges for velocity and depth throughout a
reach determined by a weighting of point measurements. The index applied here takes a
simpler approach to considering the diversity of velocity and depth.

The biodiversity of streams depends not only on the physical conditions, but also is affected
by food availability and water quality. Food availability is very different for different species
and should be studied separately. Generally speaking, water pollution reduces the number of
species but may not reduce the density of pollution-tolerant species. Water quality is not an
inherent feature of a habitat and depends on human disturbances. Therefore, water quality is
not taken in the habitat diversity index. Water temperature also is an important factor for
stream ecology. However, the temperature does not vary much in a reach of a stream unless a
thermal discharge is present, and it is not necessary to consider it in the analysis of local
habitat diversity. When habitat across different zones with great temperature differences is
studied, then temperature difference has to be considered in the analysis.
High diversity of habitat supports high diversity of bio-community, which may be illus-
trated with the sampling results of macroinvertebrates in several mountain streams in the
Xiaojiang River basin in Yunnan Province in southwestern China. Figure 3.31 shows the
relations between the habitat diversity, HD, and the species richness, S; the Shannon Weaver
index, H; and the bio-community index, B, for these streams. In general, the higher the habitat
diversity, the higher are the species richness, the biodiversity, and the bio-community index.
However, the species richness, S, has the best relation with the habitat diversity clearly
showing an increasing trend with habitat diversity. The bio-community index, B, also linearly
increases with the habitat diversity. The Shannon-Weaver index, H, increases with the habitat
diversity, but the points around the HD-H curve are rather scattered. The results suggest that
the species richness, S, and bio-community index, B, are suitable ecological indicators for
good habitat in streams that are not impaired by poor water quality. Similar results also were
obtained from a study on the East River basin in Guangdong Province. Figure 3.32 shows the
relations of the habitat diversity, HD, with the Shannon-Weaver index, H, and bio-community
index, B, for the East River. The higher is the habitat diversity, the higher are the biodiversity
and bio-community indices. The bio-community index, B, increases with habitat diversity,
HD, and the points of B-HD relation are much closer to the curve than the relation of H-HD.
High habitat diversity means various habitat conditions. Certainly, inﬂuencing variables of
macroinvertebrate communities are different under different river habitat conditions. Three

latitudes were surveyed May–August of 2009 (high water level) and September–December of
2009 (low water level). Based on canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), water physico-
chemical variables (total phosphorus and conductivity) played a key role in structuring
macroinvertebrate assemblages in silt substrate, while hydrologic variables (median grain
size of substrate and water velocity) mainly affected macroinvertebrate assemblages in stone
substrate (Fig. 3.33).
3.4.2. Habitat Evaluation Procedure
The Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) can be used for several different types of habitat
studies, including impact assessment, mitigation, and habitat management. The HEP provides
information for two general types of habitat comparisons—the relative value of different
areas at the same point in time and the relative value of the same area at different points
in time.
The HEP is based on two fundamental ecological principles—habitat has a deﬁnable
carrying capacity to support wildlife populations, and the suitability of habitat for a given
wildlife species can be estimated using measurements of vegetative, physical, and chemical
characteristics of the habitat. The suitability of a habitat for a given species is described by a
Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) constrained between 0 (unsuitable habitat) and 1 (optimum
habitat). HSI models have been developed and published [92]; the US Fish and Wildlife
Service [93] also provides guidelines for use in developing HSI models for speciﬁc projects.
HSI models can be developed for many of the previously described metrics, including species,
guilds, and communities [94].
The fundamental unit of measure in the HEP is the Habitat Unit, computed as follows:

where HU is the number of habitat units (units of area), AREA is the areal extent of the habitat
being described (in km2), and HSI is the index of suitability of the habitat (dimensionless).
Conceptually, an HU integrates the quantity and quality of habitat into a single measure, and
one HU is equivalent to one unit of optimal habitat. The HEP provides an assessment of the
net change in the number of HUs attributable to a proposed future action, such as a stream
restoration initiative. A HEP application is essentially a two-step process—calculating future
HUs for a particular project alternative and calculating the net change as compared to a base
condition.
3.4.3. Habitat Modeling
Many habitat evaluation models have been developed. The Physical Habitat Simulation
Model was designed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service primarily for instream ﬂow analysis
[95]. The model allows evaluation of available habitat within a study reach for various life
stages of different ﬁsh species. The ﬁrst component of the model is hydraulic simulation for
predicting water surface elevations and velocities at unmeasured discharges (e.g., stage
vs. discharge relations, Manning’s equation, step-backwater computations). The second

component of the model-habitat simulation integrates species and life stage-speciﬁc habitat
suitability curves for water depth, velocity, and substrate with the hydraulic data. Output is a
plot of weighted usable area against discharge for the species and life stages of interest.
Riverine Community Habitat Assessment and Restoration Concept Model is based on the
assumption that aquatic habitat in a restored stream reach will best mimic natural conditions if
the frequency distribution of depth and velocity in the subject channel is similar to a reference
reach with good aquatic habitat. Study site and reference site data can be measured or
calculated using a computer model. The similarity of the proposed design and reference
reach is expressed with three-dimensional graphs and statistics [96, 97]. The model has been
used as the primary tool for environmental analysis on studies of ﬂow management for the
Missouri River and the Alabama basin.
SALMOD (Salmonid Population Model) is a conceptual and mathematical model for the
salmonid population for Chinook salmon in concert with a 12-year ﬂow evaluation study in
the Trinity River of California using experts on the local river system and ﬁsh species in
workshop settings [98, 99]. The structure of the model is a middle ground between a highly
aggregated classical population model that tracks cohorts/size groups for a generally large
area without spatial resolution and an individual-based model that tracks individuals at a great
level of detail for a generally small area. The conceptual model states that ﬁsh growth,
movement, and mortality are directly related to physical hydraulic habitat and water temper-
ature, which in turn relate to the timing and amount of regulated stream ﬂow. Habitat capacity
is characterized by the hydraulic and thermal properties, which are the model’s spatial
computational units. Model processes include spawning, growth (including maturation),
movement (freshet induced, habitat induced, and seasonal), and mortality (base, movement
related, and temperature related). The model is limited to freshwater habitat for the ﬁrst
9 months of life; estuarine and ocean habitats are not included.
3.4.4. Suitability Indices
Suitability Indices are the core for habitat modeling, which may be illustrated for the
Chinese sturgeon [100]. The life cycle of the Chinese sturgeon in the Yangtze River mainly
comprises spawning, hatching, and growth of 1-year juvenile sturgeon. Brood ﬁsh seek
suitable spawning sites; fertilized eggs adhere to stone and hatch after about 120–150 h.
Whelp sturgeons drift with the current and grow slowly in the lower reaches of the Yangtze
River and river mouth. Juvenile sturgeons swim to the East China Sea and stay there until they
reach maturity. Therefore, analysis for the habitat quality of the Chinese sturgeon is based on
basic requirements of spawning, hatching, and juvenile and adult sturgeon growth.
In habitat modeling variables which have been shown to affect growth, survival, abun-
dance, or other measures of well-being of the Chinese sturgeon are placed in the appropriate
component. Ten aquatic eco-factors, which mainly inﬂuence the habitat of the Chinese
sturgeon, are selected for the modeling as follows: (a) water temperatures for adults and
juveniles (V1, C), (b) water depth for adults (V2, m), (c) substrate for adults (V3), (d) water
temperature for spawning (V4, C), (e) water depth for spawning (V5, m), (f) substrate for
spawning and hatching (V6), (g) water temperature during hatching (V7, C), (h) ﬂow velocity

during spawning (V8, m/s), (i) suspended sediment concentration during spawning (V9, mg/l),
and (j) the amount of eggs-predating ﬁsh in the studied year in comparison to a standard year
(V10). The suitable ranges and the Suitability Index (SI) curves of the ten main eco-factors are
determined based on biological research. By analyzing these eco-factors, a habitat assessment
model is developed which combines these factors and can be used for assessing habitat
changes caused by human activities and hydraulic processes. The habitat suitability function
for the Chinese sturgeon mainly considered the suitability for juvenile and adult ﬁsh growth,
spawning, and hatching.

where V1–V10 are the ten factors. The SI curve quantiﬁes physical habitat such as water
temperature, ﬂow velocity, and suspended sediment concentration. The habitat suitability
ranges from unsuitable (0) to optimal habitat suitability (1). The intermediate values represent
the suitability range based on a speciﬁed hydraulic variable.
Biological studies discovered that adult sturgeon distribution, spawning time, and
spawning site selection by brood ﬁsh are mainly inﬂuenced by water temperature (V1, V4),
water depth (V2, V5), and substrate (V3, V6). The main eco-factors which inﬂuence hatching
are water temperature (V7), ﬂow velocity (V8), substrate (V6), suspended sediment concen-
tration (V9), and the amount of the eggs-predating ﬁsh (V10). Water temperature is an essential
factor for hatching; ﬂow velocity inﬂuences the distribution of eggs and their cohesiveness on
the riverbed. Excessive suspended sediment concentration may cause sturgeon eggs to
debond, which then affects fertilization and hatching. According to Chang [101], 90 % of
sturgeon eggs suffer predation. The data sources used to develop the SIS are listed in
Table 3.10, and the SI curves are shown in Fig. 3.34. The value of V10 (the ratio of estimated
brood sturgeon to eggs-predatory ﬁsh) is not shown in the ﬁgure, because it depends on the
physical conditions and the number of the eggs-predatory ﬁsh in the previous year. In the
modeling the value of V10 is assumed equal to 1.0, i.e., the amount of eggs-predatory ﬁsh is
the lowest in the record.

The Chinese sturgeon can survive temperatures between

growing when temperatures fall to 9–6 C [102]. Research

8 to 29.1 C [103]. Yan (2003) found that Chinese sturgeons
prefer tepid water; anorexia results and growth almost stops
when temperatures are <6 C and >28 C; growth rate
slows when temperatures are near 10 C. 18–25 C is an
optimum range for growth; sturgeon will die when temper-
ature is >35 C [104]. The optimum temperature for juve-
nile sturgeon is 22–25 C [105]
V2
Water depth (adults)
The Chinese sturgeon is distributed in areas with 9.3–40-m
water depth; 90 % of individuals are distributed at depths
from 11 to 30 m; 11 Chinese sturgeons detected in the
Yanzhiba to Gulaobei reach were distributed at depths from
9 to 19 m [105]
V3
Substrate (adults)
Juvenile and adult Chinese sturgeons have similar substrate
choices as with shortnose sturgeon in the USA. Experiments
show that juvenile shortnose sturgeons prefer habitat in
sand-mud substrate or gravel substrate [106]. Chinese stur-
geons prefer to cruise along river channels with deep
trenches and sandy dunes and are fond of resting in pools,
backwaters, and places varied terrain [103]
V4
Water temperature
(spawning)
The spawning temperature for sturgeon is 17.0–20.0 C;
spawning will stop when temperature <l6.5 C [107]. The
average temperature in the reaches downstream of the
Gezhouba Dam during the sturgeon spawning period is
15.8–20.7 C. About 79.31 % of ﬁsh are spread in the range
of 17.5–19.5 C; the average temperature of the original
spawning sites in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is
17.0–20.2 C. Therefore, the suitable spawning temperature
for Chinese sturgeon is 17.0–20.0 C [105]. Spawning
occurs when temperature is 15.3–20.5 C; the suitable range
is 17.0–20.0 C, and the optimum is 18.0–20.0 C [108]
V5
Water depth (spawning)
More than 20 years of monitoring indicates that the length of
new spawning sites is about 30 km from the tail water area
of Gezhouba Dam to Gulaobei, with 10–15-m water depth
[103]. The “stable spawning site of Chinese sturgeon”
determined by Deng et al. (1991) has a water depth in a
range from 4 to 10 m [109]

Substrate (spawning and
hatching)
Gravel and pebbles are present in Chinese sturgeon spawning
sites of [110]. The substrate of new spawning sites is com-
posed of sand, gravel with sand, gravel, and stone and
gradually coarsens from left to right bank [107]. The sub-
strate of the original centralized spawning sites of Chinese
sturgeon was mainly composed of stones and gravels [111]
V7
Water temperature
(hatching)
The suitable temperature for hatching is 16–22 C; the opti-
mum is 17–21 C. The hatching rate decreases when at
temperature <16 C; deformity rate increases at temperature
>23 C. The temperature should be stable when zoosperms
are hatching; abnormal fetation or death will occur with even
small ﬂuctuations in temperature of 3–5 C [112]. Water
temperature for cultivating fries should be between 12 and
29 C; the most suitable temperature is 16–24 C [113]
V8
Flow velocity (spawning)
Sturgeons prefer spawning areas with ﬂow velocity of
0.08–0.14 m/s at the bottom, 0.43–0.58 m/s in the middle,
and 1.15–1.70 m/s at the surface [114]. The surface ﬂow
velocity at spawning areas is 1.1–1.7 m/s [110]. The ﬂow
velocity of spawning areas during spawning season ranges
from 0.82 to 2.01 m/s; 57.69 % of ﬁsh are distributed
between 1.2 and 1.5 m/s. When spawning occurs during
periods when water levels are falling, the daily ﬂuctuation
range of ﬂow velocity is 0.82–1.86 m/s, with an average of
1.24 m/s. The daily maximum ﬂuctuation range is
1.20–2.33 m/s, with an average of 1.56 m/s. When spawning
activity occurs during periods when water levels are rising,
the daily ﬂuctuation range of ﬂow velocity is 1.17–2.01 m/s,
with an average of 1.55 m/s [105]. According to 31 records
from 1983 to 2000, the average ﬂow velocity on spawning
day was between 0.81 and 1.98 m/s, and 81 % took place in
the range of 1.00–1.66 m/s [108]
V9
Suspended sediment con-
centration (spawning)
The suspended sediment concentration in reaches down-
stream from the Gezhouba Dam is between 0.073 and
1.290 kg/m3, with an average of 0.508 kg/m3. About
66.67 % of ﬁsh are distributed between 0.3 and 0.7 kg/m3.
When spawning activity occurs during periods of falling
water level, the daily average suspended sediment concen-
tration varies between 0.17 and 1.29 kg/m3, with an average
of 0.52 kg/m3. When spawning activity occurs during
periods of rising water levels, the daily average suspended
sediment concentration varies between 0.41 and 1.02 kg/m3,
with an average of 0.61 kg/m3 [107]. The suitable range of
suspended sediment concentration for Chinese sturgeon is
0.10–1.32 kg/m3. From 1983 to 2000, 15 of 31 spawning
events were in the range of 0.2–0.3 kg/m3 [108]

3.4.5. Vegetation-Hydroperiod Modeling
Vegetation-hydroperiod modeling is a very useful tool for habitat evaluation. Hydro-
period is deﬁned as the depth, duration, and frequency of inundation and is a powerful
determinant of what plants are likely to be found in various positions in the riparian zone, as

shown in Fig. 3.35. In most cases, the dominant factor that makes the riparian zone distinct
from the surrounding uplands, and the most important gradient in structuring variation
within the riparian zone, is site moisture conditions or hydroperiod. Formalizing this relation
as a vegetation-hydroperiod model can provide a powerful tool for analyzing existing
distributions of riparian vegetation, casting forward or backward in time to alternative
distributions, and designing new distributions. The suitability of site conditions for various
species of plants can be described with the same conceptual approach used to model habitat
suitability for animals. The basic logic of a vegetation-hydroperiod model is straightforward.
It is possible to measure how wet a site is and, more importantly, to predict how wet a site will
be. From this, it is possible to estimate what vegetation is likely to occur on the site.
The two basic elements of the vegetation-hydroperiod relation are the physical conditions
of site moisture at various locations and the suitability of those sites for various plant species.
In the simplest case of describing existing patterns, site moisture and vegetation can be
directly measured at a number of locations. However, to use the vegetation-hydroperiod
model to predict or design new situations, it is necessary to predict new site moisture
conditions. The most useful vegetation-hydroperiod models have the following three compo-
nents [30]:
1.
Characterization of the hydrology or pattern of stream ﬂow—This can take the form of a speciﬁc
sequence of ﬂows, a summary of how often different ﬂows occur, such as a ﬂow duration or ﬂood
frequency curve, or a representative ﬂow value, such as bankfull discharge or mean annual
discharge.
2.
A relation between stream ﬂow and moisture conditions at sites in the riparian zone—This relation
can be measured as the water surface elevation at a variety of discharges and summarized as a
stage versus discharge curve. It can also be calculated by a number of hydraulic models that relate
water surface elevations to discharge, taking into account variables of channel geometry and
Fig. 3.35. Soil moisture conditions determine the plant communities in riparian areas of the Nile River
in Sudan.
228

roughness or resistance to ﬂow. In some cases, differences in simple elevation above the channel
bottom may serve as a reasonable approximation of differences in inundating discharge.
3.
A relation between site moisture conditions and the actual or potential vegetation distribution—
This relation expresses the suitability of a site for a plant species or cover type based on the
moisture conditions at the site. It can be determined by sampling the distribution of vegetation at a
variety of sites with known moisture conditions and then deriving probability distributions of the
likelihood of ﬁnding a plant on a site given the moisture conditions at the site. General relations are
also available from the literature for many species.
In altered or degraded stream systems, current moisture conditions in the riparian zone may be
dramatically unsuitable for the current, historical, or desired riparian vegetation. Several
conditions can be relatively easily identiﬁed by comparing the distribution of vegetation to
the distribution of vegetation suitabilities.
The hydrology of the stream has been altered, for example, if stream ﬂow has diminished
by diversion or ﬂood attenuation; sites in the riparian zone may be drier and no longer suitable
for the historic vegetation or for current long-lived vegetation that was established under a
previous hydrologic regime. The inundating discharges of plots in the riparian zone have been
altered so that stream ﬂow no longer has the same relation to site moisture conditions; for
example, levees, channel modiﬁcations, and bank treatments may have either increased or
decreased the discharge required to inundate plots in the riparian zone. The vegetation of the
riparian zone has been directly altered, for example, by clearing or planting so that the
vegetation on plots no longer corresponds to the natural vegetation for which the plots are
suitable.
Temporal variability is a particularly important characteristic of many stream ecosystems.
Regular seasonal differences in biological requirements are examples of temporal variability
that are often incorporated into biological analyses based on habitat suitability and time series
simulations. The need for episodic extreme events is easy to ignore because these are as
widely perceived as destructive both to biota and constructed river features. In reality,
however, these extreme events seem to be essential to physical channel maintenance and to
the long-term suitability of the riverine ecosystem for disturbance-dependent species.
Cottonwood in riparian systems in the western USA is one well-understood case of a
disturbance-dependent species. Cottonwood regeneration from seed is generally restricted to
bare, moist sites. Creating these sites depends heavily on channel movement (meandering,
narrowing, and avulsion) or new ﬂood deposits at high elevations. In some riparian systems,
channel movement and sediment deposition on ﬂood plains tend to occur infrequently in
association with ﬂoods. The same events are also responsible for destroying stands of trees.
Thus, maintaining good conditions for existing stands, or ﬁxing the location of a stream’s
banks with structural measures, tends to reduce the regeneration potential and the long-term
importance of this disturbance-dependent species in the system as a whole.
There is a large body of information on the ﬂooding tolerances of various plant species.
Summaries of this literature include Whitlow and Harris [115] and the multivolume Impact of
Water Level Changes on Woody Riparian and Wetland Communities [116, 117]. This type of
information can be coupled to site moisture conditions predicted by applying discharge
estimates or ﬂood frequency analyses to the inundating discharges of sites in the riparian
River Ecology
229

zone. The resulting relation can be used to describe the suitability of sites for various plant
species, e.g., relatively ﬂood-prone sites will likely have relatively ﬂood-tolerant plants.
Inundating discharge is strongly related to relative elevation within the ﬂoodplain. Other
things being equal (i.e., within a limited geographic area and with roughly equivalent
hydrologic regimes), elevation relative to a representative water surface line, such as bankfull
discharge or the stage at mean annual ﬂow, can, thus, provide a reasonable surrogate for site
moisture conditions. Locally determined vegetation suitability can then be used to determine
the likely vegetation in various elevation zones.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Scope
This chapter has the purpose and aims to describe the deﬁnition and basic concepts of
river restoration, followed by an overview of a river and disturbances affecting a river, river
restoration planning and design, and the implementation/monitoring/management of river
restoration projects.
Explained further, this chapter starts with an introductory part of the scope of this
handbook, the basic concepts, and deﬁnitions of river restoration including, among others,
the restoration and rehabilitation. Following, this chapter introduces an overview of a river such
as the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics in conjunction with river restoration
including, among others, the ecological structures and the functions of a river habitat. Also,
disturbances affecting the river and problems caused by such are brieﬂy explained. From the
next parts, the core contents of this chapter are then introduced, such as river restoration
planningand design. For riverrestoration planning,the goals and objectives ofriver restoration,
planning process, site assessment, and investigations are explained. For river restoration
design, channel design, in-stream habitat structures, riverbank restoration, channel–ﬂoodplain
connectivity, and riparian restoration are fully explained. Finally, the restoration implementa-
tion, monitoring, and adaptive management are then explained.
This chapter focuses on an ecological river restoration, excluding any enhancement of the
amenities or the aesthetic values of such a restoration, which may be practically important
especially to the urban rivers. Readers who are interested in such topics may refer to the
literature of URBEM [1].
This chapter also does not relate to the restoration of the river water quality, which is
equally as important as the restoration of river itself. That topic will be dealt with in a separate
chapter in the handbook. Readers who want to know the water quality restoration can refer to
the Volume 4, Water Resources and Natural Control Processes, of Handbook of Environ-
mental Engineering [2] or the corresponding chapter of this handbook.
This chapter focuses mainly on the technical aspects of a river restoration project, exclud-
ing the decision-making processes and public participation of such a restoration project,
which are especially important to the “watershed approach” [3]. Watershed usually covers
multiple land ownerships, and often complex patchworks of private and public lands latticed
with the transportation infrastructure networks and utility easements. Planning river restora-
tion, therefore, requires some level of participation by the many stakeholders in the water-
shed, leading to the general public consensus and support for the works, of which dramatically
increases the likelihood of the success and positive long-term outcomes. Readers who are
interested in the decision-making processes and the stakeholders’ participation in the planning
and design of a restoration project can refer to other documents on river restoration as such
listed in Appendix.
This chapter is based mainly on the existing manuals or texts for river restoration published
in the USA, including the Federal Interagency Stream Corridor Restoration Handbook [4],

Engineering of ASCE [6].
Appendix of this chapter lists some well-documented (in English) guidelines, manuals,
and handbooks for river restoration in the world and their relevant URL addresses.
1.2. Backgrounds and Basic Concepts
The Clean River Act of 1972, or the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as it is ofﬁcially
known, is for the restoration and maintenance of the chemical, physical, and biological
integrity of the nation’s waters in the USA. It may be a starting point of river restoration in
a broad sense. One of the two main goals of the law is to achieve water quality levels that
create a ﬁshable and swimmable habitat.
Since then, during the 1980s and 1990s, river restoration has been based generally on a
pre-disturbance state [7]. Here, the desired conditions are usually deﬁned as a pre-major
impacted state, for example, preindustrial or presettlement states in a long-term sense or
pre-dam or preﬂood control river works in a short-term sense. A similar deﬁnition for river
(or stream) restoration and the related terms are found in the manual of river restoration [4].
In that manual, the following three terms are deﬁned:
–
Restoration: a reestablishment of the structure and function of ecosystems. Ecological restoration is
the process of returning an ecosystem as closely as possible to pre-disturbance conditions and
functions.
–
Rehabilitation: making the land useful again after a disturbance, mainly involving the recovery of
the ecosystem functions and processes in a degraded habitat. It does not necessarily reestablish the
pre-disturbance condition, but does involve establishing geological and hydrologically stable
landscapes that support the natural ecosystem mosaic.
–
Reclamation: a series of activities intended to change the biophysical capacity of an ecosystem. It
has implied the process of adapting wild or natural resources to serve a utilitarian human purpose
such as the conversion of riparian or wetland ecosystems to agricultural, industrial, or urban uses.
Meanwhile, the ﬁrst two terms are used for the remaking of the land and ecosystem after a
disturbance, while the third one is used mainly for the changing of the land use for human
purposes regardless of the disturbance. This chapter, therefore, is concerned with only the ﬁrst
two categories.
On the other hand, an Australian manual for stream restoration [8] introduces remediation
in addition to restoration and rehabilitation, which is based on Bradshaw’s work on the
principle of restoration [9]. Also, that manual differentiates between restoration and rehabil-
itation differently from the literature [4]. According to that manual, restoration involves only
returning the stream to the original, for example, pre-European condition, while rehabilitation
involves ﬁxing only some aspects of the stream, but generally returning the degraded stream
closer to the original condition. Remediation, on the other hand, recognizes that the stream has
changed so much that the original condition is no longer relevant and aims for some entirely
new condition. Figure 4.1 shows the relative positions of the three deﬁnitions. A question can
arise from the Bradshaw’s deﬁnition of rehabilitation and restoration [9] as shown in Fig. 4.1.
Strictly speaking, in most cases of river restoration projects, there is no practical way of
River Restoration

measuring how close a restored stream is to their original states. The ecological closeness of
before and after the restoration works, unlike geomorphologic or hydrologic closeness, may
not be obtained due to the dynamic nature of ecosystems once an ecological system is disturbed
and changed for a long time. In this sense, differentiation between the two deﬁnitions is
hardly possible in most practical cases. Rather, the two deﬁnitions of restoration and rehabil-
itation in Fig. 4.1 can be combined into the deﬁnition of restoration by the literature
[4]. Then, remediation in Fig. 4.1 can be equivalent to rehabilitation by the literature [4].
Another question of the restoration to a pre-disturbance state had been raised in the 1990s
based on the fact that humans have interfered with the river and its ﬂoodplain since the dawn
of civilization, especially since the industrialization and urbanization in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries depending on the regions. Moreover, the ecological state is not usually
static but dynamic for the structure and functioning of the ecosystems are continuously
evolving. A pre-disturbance state may be hardly determined in this situation.
More plausible goals of river restoration may be to pursue the ecosystem goods and
services rather than to try to restore them to the completely original state, which may be
useless [10]. Therefore, a goal of river restoration should be to reestablish the ecological
integrity and the human well-being in the degraded rivers. In this sense, reference condition is
just the model, or a guiding image for the planning of an ecological restoration project [11].

Since goals of river restoration have progressed from a strict expression of the restoration
to a pre-disturbance state in a dynamic state of the ecosystem to a more practical way of
reestablishing the ecological integrity and human well-being, the deﬁnition of river restora-
tion also has been expressed in a wide variety. Table 4.1 shows a variety of concepts and
terminologies on river restoration.
Based on the backgrounds of the progress of concepts of river restoration, river restoration
can be deﬁned in this chapter, as WWF/IUCN [11] once did for a forest, as a planned process
that aims to regain the ecological integrity and enhance the human well-being in a degraded
river corridor. It does not necessarily reestablish the pre-disturbance conditions as indicated
by the literature [12], but still needs the reestablishment of natural hydrologic, geomorphic,
and ecological processes, and replacing lost, damaged, or compromised biological elements
as indicated by the literature [13].
On the other hand, river rehabilitation involves establishing geologically and hydrologi-
cally stable landscapes that supports the natural ecosystem mosaic. Although still useful to be
delineated separately from river restoration, it does not need to reestablish the natural
processes as close to as to a pre-disturbance state.
To summarize, river restoration is to regain the ecological integrity and enhance the human
well-being by reestablishing the natural hydrologic, geomorphic, and ecological processes, in
a self-sustainable manner by possibly referring to a pre-disturbance state. River restoration,

however, can be conducted without reference to a pre-disturbance state. Delineating the
concept of river restoration from other ones such as that of river rehabilitation may, therefore,
not be practically important.
2. OVERVIEW OF RIVER AND DISTURBANCES AFFECTING RIVER
2.1. Overview of River in Terms of Restoration
River restoration usually encompasses, in a spatial scale, the ﬂoodplain and transitional
upland fringe as well as the channel itself, which forms a river corridor. Understanding the
physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the components of the river corridor and
their scale and structure, therefore, is essential to river restoration planning and design.
In general, the landscape, including the river corridor, can be viewed as different space and
time scales. As for river restoration, the watershed scale, river corridor scale, and reach scale
are most relevant to the movement of material, energy, and organisms. The spatial structure of
the landscape and river corridor is viewed as shown in Fig. 4.2, which includes a matrix,
patch, corridor, and mosaic.
In Fig. 4.2, the matrix is deﬁned as the land cover that is dominant and interconnected over
the majority of the land surface (forest or agriculture). The patch is a polygon that is less
dominant than and smaller than that from the matrix. The corridor is a special type of patch
that links to other patches in the matrix. It is linear or elongated in shape. The mosaic is a
collection of patches, none of which is dominant enough to be interconnected throughout the
landscape [4].

literature [4]).
242
H. Woo

Examples of a patch in the river corridor scale are wetlands, shrubland patch in a grass
mosaic, oxbow lakes, and islands in the channel, while examples of a patch in the reach scale
are rifﬂes and pools, small islands and point bars, and woody debris.
River restoration works are usually done on the river corridor that is focused mostly on
channel and ﬂoodplain, but sometimes includes the upland fringe. The ecological functions of
a river corridor, however, are directly interconnected to the neighboring patch and matrix, and
it is essential to the planning and design of a river restoration to investigate the interconnec-
tivity of both landscape structures.
Focusing in detail on the physical structures in the river corridor itself, two views are
conceived: a cross-sectional view and a longitudinal view of a river corridor. Figure 4.3 shows
a cross-sectional view of a typical natural river corridor. Prominent features in this ﬁgure are
the river channels and ﬂows, main and sides, ﬂoodplain, transitional upland fringe, and ﬂora
and fauna which inhabit the river corridor.
Figure 4.4 shows a longitudinal view of a typical river corridor and variations in the
transport features as it travels from headwater to the mouth. Schumm [14] divided the
longitudinal proﬁle of a river into three parts: headwaters, transfer zone, and depositional
zone. According to his classiﬁcation, the headwaters often have the steepest gradient, where
the sediment erodes from slopes of the watershed and moves downstream. The transfer zone
receives sediment and then transfers it downstream. It is often characterized by a wide
ﬂoodplain and meander channels. The depositional zone is characterized by a ﬂattened
gradient with sediment deposits.
The river ecosystem also changes along the river corridor, which may be best viewed by the
River Continuum Concept [15] as shown in Fig. 4.5.
The River Continuum Concept lies on the dependence of energy and material coming
inside or outside of channel for the life of aquatic biota. Accordingly, the number of species in
the river corridor increases to the downstream direction, while it rather decreases slightly at
Fig. 4.3. A cross-sectional view of a river corridor (cited from Fig. 1.11 in the literature [4]).

243

the river mouth. This conceptual model not only helps to identify the connection between the
watershed, ﬂoodplain, and stream systems, but it also describes how biological communities
develop and change from the headwaters to the mouth.
2.1.1. River Corridor Processes: Hydrologic and Hydraulic Processes
In the spatial dimension of a watershed and channel, hydrologic and hydraulic processes
are considered in the three dimensions of watershed (land), ocean, and atmosphere, while they
are considered in the cross-sectional dimensions across the channel. They are also considered
in the longitudinal dimensions as water ﬂows downstream in the channel.
The hydrologic cycle, or water cycle, describes the continuous transfer of water from
precipitation to surface water, to storage and runoff, and to the eventual return to the
atmosphere by evapotranspiration. The various hydrologic terminologies related to the
hydrologic cycle are self-explained by the schematic picture of Fig. 4.6. They are precipita-
tion, transpiration, evaporation, interception, inﬁltration, soil moisture, and groundwater and
surface runoff, each of which are well understood from any standard hydrology textbook.
Among these various processes of water ﬂow in the atmosphere, on the land surface, and
underground, a concentrated ﬂow into the river corridor would be of the most importance.
Yearly-based variations in river water ﬂows are usually barely predictable, since they depend
heavily on variations in precipitation and other hydrologic processes. On the other hand,
seasonable variations in the river water ﬂow are more predictable. Several important formats
are especially useful for the planning and design of a river restoration as well as ordinary river
works and management. They are ﬂow duration, the probability that a given river ﬂow will

exceed or be equal over a period of time; ﬂow frequency, the probability a given river ﬂow
will be exceeded in a year; and the ﬂow duration curve, the percentage of time a given
river ﬂow is exceeded over a given period.
2.1.2. River Corridor Processes: Geomorphic Processes
The geomorphic processes are the primary mechanisms for the formation of the drainage
patterns, channel, ﬂoodplain, terraces, and other watershed and stream corridor features.
Erosion, sediment transport, and sediment deposition are the three primary processes that
are involved with ﬂowing waters.
Similar to the hydrologic and hydraulic processes, two aspects of considerations are
possible on the geomorphic processes in the watershed: the geomorphic processes across
the river corridor and along the river corridor. Soil erosion can occur gradually over long
periods, or it can be episodic, accelerating during a certain rainfall event.
Stream ﬂow dictates the erosion in a river corridor, transport, and deposition of sediment
and eventually forms channels, ﬂoodplains, terraces, and other features along the river
corridor. Stream competence describes the largest particle size that a stream can transport
under a given hydraulic condition. Various terminologies and relations that are related to
sediment transport in a river are easily found in any standard textbook of sedimentation
engineering.
River channels and their ﬂoodplains are constantly adjusting to the water and sediment
supplied by the watershed. Successful restoration of degraded rivers requires an understand-
ing of watershed history, including the adjustment processes that are active in channel
evolution. River channel responses to changes in ﬂow and sediment load have been described
Fig. 4.6. The water cycle [16].

qualitatively in a number of ways. One of the oldest and simplest relations is Lane’s relation
[17], which explains a relation of equilibrium between the ﬂow and sediment as follows:
QsD50  QS
ð4:1Þ
In which Qs is the sediment discharge, D50 is the median particle size, Q is the water
discharge, and S is the channel slope. When one or two variables in the relation are changed,
the other variables are changed to create a new equilibrium, accordingly.
Yang [18] proposed a quantitative equation to replace Lane’s qualitative relationship based
on Yang’s unit stream power concept to compute and predict river morphologic changes. His
equation is as follows:
QtD50
K
¼ Q2S
A
ð4:2Þ
In which Qt is the total bed load discharge, K is the parameter speciﬁc to site, and A is the
cross-sectional area of the channel. Readers who are interested in the above equation can
review the reference of [18].
2.1.3. River Corridor Processes: Physical/Chemical
Water quality issues are an essential part of understanding the characteristics and processes
of a river and a river corridor, if the restoration of water quality is not covered in this
handbook. This section, therefore, just brieﬂy surveys some of the key physical and chemical
characteristics of ﬂowing waters.
In a river, sediment moves as well as water ﬂows. The negative impacts of changes in
sediment characteristics from natural conditions are well known and explained in Sect. 2.2.
The water temperature is a crucial factor in the river corridor restoration for dissolved oxygen
solubility, biochemical and physiological processes, aquatic species’ tolerance of limited
temperature range, and the effect on the abiotic chemical processes. Other important constit-
uents include pH, alkalinity, and acidity, which affect the suitability for biota and inﬂuence
chemical reactions in the water. The characteristics of sediment, temperature, and other
constituents, either across the river corridor or along the river, are well documented in any
standard textbooks on this topic.
Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a basic requirement for a healthy aquatic ecosystem. Major
processes affecting the DO balance within a river are depicted in Fig. 4.7. Major components
in the processes are carbonaceous deoxygenation, nitrogenous deoxygenation, re-aeration,
sediment oxygen demand, and photosynthesis and respiration of plants.
Aquatic plants can produce organic matters, such as sugars, through photosynthesis using
sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. In addition, plants require a variety of elements to support
their bodily structures and metabolisms, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. These important
nutrients can be characterized both across the river and along the river.

River corridor processes are characterized by the physical, chemical, and biological
characteristics, and thus understanding of the interactions among these three processes at a
varying time scale is essential to a successful river restoration. Two ecosystems, terrestrial
and aquatic, are characterized by the physical, chemical, and biological processes, and
habitats formed inherently by those characteristics themselves.
Ecosystems, in corridor forms, have some inherent functions of which a river corridor
restoration project usually determines as goals of the project. They are the functions of the

habitat, barrier, conduit, ﬁlter, source, and sink, which are depicted in Fig. 4.8. The habitat
function means many species can use the corridor to live and to seek food and water. The
conduit function is the ability to serve as a ﬂow pathway for energy, materials, and organisms,
activating laterally as well as longitudinally. The other functions are self-depicted in Fig. 4.8.

2.2. Overview of Disturbances Affecting Rivers
A disturbance naturally induced or human induced, affecting a river corridor, usually
results in a chain of alterations to the river corridor structure and functions, which is obvious
in the aspect of the River Continuum Concept as well as the ﬂow and sediment continuity. The
literature [4] depicts a chain of events due to a disturbance in a river corridor, starting from
changes in the land and river corridor use, to changes in the geomorphology and hydrology; to
changes in functions of habitat, sediment transport and storage; and eventually to changes in
population, composition, and distribution in the system.
Any disturbances, natural or man-made, can be characterized by three factors, the intensity,
frequency, and extent of the disturbances. In order to plan and design a river restoration
project, therefore, it is essential to understand what the changes of which disturbances are
stressing the ecological system of a river corridor, and how the system responds to those
stresses. For the sake of convenience, two types of stresses are delineated, as natural
disturbance and man-induced disturbance, both of which can affect the river ecosystem as
well as the river hydraulics and morphology.
Among the various natural events affecting the system such as ﬂoods and droughts, ﬁre,
and storms, ﬂoods are the most frequently occurring and severely affecting ones. The
energy inherent in high ﬂows performs the work of shaping the channel and ﬂoodplain,
maintaining the channel capacity, and transporting and depositing of sediment. Flooding
serves as the principal mechanism for the creating, maintaining, and destroying of channels
and ﬂoodplain features, such as pools, islands, bars, oxbows, side channels, and off-channel
ponds [3].
The variation in channel response, such as river widening, straightening, and steepening
from ﬂoods, can be represented diagrammatically in Fig. 4.9 [19]: from no response at one
event to transient behavior at the other extreme, with various intermediate states involving
different styles of recovery and non-recovery. In spite of this dramatic variation of river
geomorphology, however, the river corridor ecosystem is basically resilient.
A range of human activities has the potential to alter the disturbance regimes of the river
systems. Alterations to the storage and delivery of water, sediment, or large wood from the
uplands tend to occur synergistically rather than independently and result in substantial
cumulative effects. For instance, widespread soil compaction and changes to the vegetative
community can affect the hydrologic process and thus the biological process in the
region [3].
Human-induced disturbances, such as dams, channelization and diversions, land use
agricultural activities, and mining activities all profoundly affect river ecosystems. For
example, dams ranging from a small temporary structure to a huge multipurpose dam can
have profound impacts both on upstream and downstream rivers. These disturbances,
however, cannot be eliminated or alleviated easily without a physical restoration of river,
i.e., a dam removal, which is plausible at present only for a small, out-functioned one. The
literature [4] depicts common disturbances such as dams, channelization and diversion,
introduction of alien species, and widespread disturbances, such as land use activities for
agriculture, forestry, mining, recreation, and urbanization. Dams also affect downstream
250

ﬂoodplain geomorphology and accelerate and decelerate the vegetation recruitment on the
ﬂoodplain. Since an investigation on this problem was ﬁrst reported in 1984 in the USA
[20], many similar results have been reported worldwide. Recently, restorations of ﬂood-
plain or sand/gravel bars, on which vegetation was established after dam construction, to
the original bare condition have been tried [21].
Finally, the disturbances of sediment load and particle size from a natural condition can
have negative impacts. Fine sediment can severely alter aquatic communities in the way that it
may clog and abrade ﬁsh gills, suffocate eggs and aquatic insect larvae on the bottom, and ﬁll
in the pore space between the bottom cobbles where ﬁsh lay eggs. Sediment may also carry
other pollutants into water bodies, such as nutrients and toxic chemicals attached to the
surfaces of sediment particles [4].

3. RIVER RESTORATION PLANNING AND DESIGN
3.1. River Restoration Planning
3.1.1. Planning Process
Basically, there are two major purposes of a restoration plan for any river restoration effort:
(1) problem-solving framework for addressing critical river corridor restoration issues and
requirements and (2) documentation for the results of the restoration process [4]. Figure 4.10
shows the process of a river restoration plan development starting from getting organized.
Similarly, NRCS [5] has proposed the nine-step planning process of river restoration as
shown in Table 4.2. Among the many steps in the table, the determination of goals and
objectives at Step 2 may be critically important to guide the restoration project to the right
direction. Three types of approaches for the determination of the goals for river restoration
design are suggested in NRCS [5], namely, the historical, geomorphic, and ecosystem
approaches.
A desire to recover the lost conditions in the river (Historical Approach) is frequently a
motivation for a river restoration. For example:
What did a river look like before the preindustrial or pre-European settlement state [22]?
What did a river look like before the land use became what it is today?
What did a river look like before the major river works was made?
What did a river look like before river was incised due to bad watershed management?

The reestablishment of an original state of a river, however, was criticized ([23, 24], and
recently [10]) by the reasoning that a river system follows complex trajectories, frequently
making it impossible to return it to a previous state. Instead, they suggest that an objective-
based strategy that reﬂects the practical limitations of the development of sustainable
landscapes and the emerging importance of accounting for human services of the target
ecosystem. Human services, here, represent the environmental functions of a river system,
such as physiological needs (fresh air, water, food, health) and psychological needs (oppor-
tunities for cognitive and spiritual development, recreation, and safety) [25].
NRCS [5] also explains the geomorphic approaches for determining the goals for a river
restoration design, which encompasses a number of different activities, such as the stabiliza-
tion of unstable stream banks and channels, reconﬁguring the channelized or aggraded/
degraded rivers, and restoration natural substrates and other habitat features.
An analog reach of a river, called a reference river, can also be used in establishing the
goals of a river restoration. A reach of the project river or a neighboring river, which is
considered to function in a desired manner, is identiﬁed. The reference reach is then inves-
tigated for physical and biological characteristics, which can be a goal for the restoration of
the project river.
The ecosystem approaches to river restoration include the remediation or compensations
of, among others, ﬁsh migration blockages, diversion of water ﬂow for irrigation or municipal
water supply, upstream migrating head cut, and streams conﬁned by concrete. These are
artiﬁcial disturbances which are detrimental to the ecosystem of the river concerned. There-
fore, this approach to river restoration starts ﬁrst by identifying the ecological problems on the
river or river reach concerned and the sources of disturbances and ﬁnally remediating them
with the removal or correction of the stressors.
Regardless of the approaches to be selected, there are some general ways to determine the
goals and objectives of a river restoration, which is explained in detail as follows:
3.1.2. Goals and Objectives
The goals and objectives of a river restoration are to identify, usually in a short but clear
sentence, the desired outcome or results of any action to restore the river. This is a critical step
in the overall planning process in order to avoid failed or poorly performing restoration as
well as to evaluate the restoration project after the completion of the project.
General and broad scopes and expressions of the objectives can make the project team lose
focus and how well to perform for the restoration. Narrowing the objectives reduces any
ambiguity for the project team. The objectives of river restoration should be [5]:
–
Speciﬁc
–
Realistic
–
Achievable
–
Measurable
Goals for river restoration focuses generally on the three major management targets of
the river: value of water and river use, management target of river ﬂooding, and the
River Restoration
255

environmental (or natural) function of river such as habitat, self-puriﬁcation of the water
quality, and aesthetics of the river.
Typical goals for river restoration that focuses on the management of river ﬂood are:
–
Preventing stream-bank erosion on residential properties and protect infrastructure
–
Protecting valuable agricultural land
–
Protecting municipal water supply
Typical goals for river restoration that focuses on the environmental function of river are:
–
Restoring ﬁsh habitat
–
Restoring water quality
–
Restoring overall environmental quality
Examples of goals and objectives for river restoration that focuses on the environmental
function of river are to maintain or rehabilitate the environmental quality by designing and
constructing river restoration projects that [5]:
–
Look natural
–
Function naturally with channels connected to ﬂoodplains
–
Provide desirable river and riparian habitat, including overhanging root cover and large woody
debris
–
Reduce bank erosion
–
Maintain water quality
–
Are economical to design and build
Meanwhile, the literature of WSAHGP [3] suggests several common restoration goals based
on the processes of a river and river corridor that determine abundance, diversity, form, and
quality of river habitat. Here the processes are the ﬂows of water, sediment, solutes, organic
matter, and energy. WSAHGP’s suggestions for common restoration goals include:
–
Restoring sediment supply
–
Restoring stream ﬂow regime
–
Restoring energy inputs to the stream
–
Restoring water quality
In addition, WSAHGP [3] suggests, for more site- and species-speciﬁc restoration goals:
–
Restoring incised channels
–
Restoring aggrading channels
–
Restoring salmonid-spawning habitat
–
Restoring salmonid-rearing habitat
3.1.3. Site Assessment and Investigation
Two useful references are available for the site assessment and investigation for a river
restoration: [4] and [5]. The literature of FISRWG [4] introduces the “analysis of corridor
condition” for the site investigation. It contains four major components: hydrologic and
geomorphic processes and chemical and biological characteristics. The hydrologic processes
256
H. Woo

include ﬂow analysis and stage–discharge relationships; the geomorphic processes include
stream classiﬁcation, proper functioning condition [26], hydraulic geometry, stream system
dynamic, and determining stream instability; the chemical characteristics include data col-
lection and sampling techniques; and the biological characteristics include synthetic measures
of a system condition and analysis of species requirements. Each subcomponent includes
relevant analysis methods and/or tools as follows:
–
Flow analysis: ﬂow duration and ﬂow frequency analysis
–
Stage–discharge relationships: continuity equation, Manning’s equation, energy equation, analyz-
ing composite and compound cross sections, reach selection, and ﬁeld procedures
–
Stream classiﬁcation: advantages and limitations of stream classiﬁcation, stream classiﬁcation
systems, channel evolution models, advantages and limitations of channel evolution models, and
application of geomorphic models
–
Hydraulic geometry: hydraulic geometry and stability assessment
–
Determining stream instability: system-wide instability, local instability, bed instability, sediment
transport processes, numerical analyses and models to protect aggradation and degradation, and
bank instability
–
Data collection: constituent selection, sampling frequency, and site selection
–
Sampling techniques: sampling protocol for water and sediment, ﬁeld analysis of water quality
samples, water quality sample preparation and handling for laboratory analysis, collecting and
handling water quality samples, data management, and quality assurance and quality control
–
Synthetic measures of system condition: indicator species, diversity and related indices, and
classiﬁcation system
–
Analysis of species requirement: Habitat Evaluation Procedure [27], physical habitat simulation,
riverine community assessment and restoration, time series simulation, vegetation–hydroperiod
modeling, and extreme events and disturbance requirements
NRCS [5] rather simply introduces on the site assessment and investigation for a river
restoration. It starts with an introductory for a stream system assessment, ﬂow duration, and
stream orders. Then, it introduces the preliminary investigation, reconnaissance, and detailed
ﬁeld investigations of geologic and biologic assessment. Finally, it introduces stream classi-
ﬁcation systems, starting with overview, a USDA guide, channel evolution model [28],

and

[29],
and

Among the many items described in the two references, the readers may select proper items
that are required for the speciﬁc sites concerned. For example, they may select models of
geomorphic evolution and stream stability to assess the site concerned that are incised and
degraded.
3.2. River Restoration Design
This section describes the design procedures to restore, or rehabilitate at least, the river
corridor and its habitat in a concerned river. Problems that are localized may be designed
relatively easily. Problems that are widely and diversely spread in a concerned reach or
watershed and involve multiple stakeholders require a systematic, integrated approach con-
sidering the environmental and ecological factors as well as the physical factors.
River Restoration
257

Various texts and guidelines are available for assistance on how to design a river
restoration after the goals and objectives are adequately formulated and relevant planning
processes are delineated. Readers who are interested in the design of a river restoration
focused on the sediment transport and channel morphology can refer to Chap. 9 Stream
Restoration in Sedimentation Engineering of ASCE [6]. Readers who are interested in
relatively small streams that ﬂow across farmlands, which have the problems of such as
accelerated erosion, sediment, and site instability; unsuited or insufﬁcient habitat and biodi-
versity; and unsuited or insufﬁcient production/land use, can refer to Chap. 4 Stream
Restoration Design Process, Part 654 Stream Restoration Design, National Engineering
Handbook of NRCS [5]. Readers who are interested especially in the aquatic and riparian
habitat restoration such as stream-bank protection, ﬁsh passage and ﬁshway, and “ecological”
in-stream structures can refer to the Stream Habitat Restoration Guidelines prepared for the
Washington State Aquatic Habitat Guidelines Program [3]. Readers who are interested in any
large-scale inﬂuences on stream corridor ecosystems and need design guidance primarily at
the stream corridor and stream scales can refer to Chap. 8 Restoration Design, Stream
Corridor Restoration [4].
This chapter brieﬂy introduces the methods and techniques for river restoration design in a
transverse direction from the main channel and bank to the ﬂoodplain and upland fringe,
including (1) channel design, (2) in-stream habitat structures, (3) riverbank restoration,
(4) channel–ﬂoodplain connectivity, (5) riparian restoration, and ﬁnally (6) “Room for the
River”—a Dutch practice. “Channel design and in-stream habitat structures” primarily follow
the literature of ASCE [6], “riverbank protection” follows the Stream Corridor Restoration
[4], and “channel–ﬂoodplain connectivity and riparian restoration” primarily follow Wash-
ington State’s Guidelines [3]. “Channel–ﬂoodplain connectivity” also includes a levee
removal and side-channel/off-channel restorations. “Room for the River,” which is a Dutch
river management practice mainly for ﬂood control along the rivers, is brieﬂy introduced in
this section that focuses on the aspect of ﬂoodplain restoration.
3.2.1. Channel Design
Channel design for restoration projects is required in the case that the concerned river is
unstable or channel modiﬁcation is needed in order to meet the overall project objectives, such
as restoring in-stream habitat structures. In many parts of the world, natural channels were
artiﬁcially straightened or modiﬁed mainly for ﬂood control or other river-use purposes.
Special concerns should be given to restoring this kind of artiﬁcially modiﬁed and channel-
ized rivers close to their original features.
Restoration projects often seek to enhance the dynamic behavior of ﬂuvial systems, often
by relaxing constraints when past activities have led to highly regulated ﬂows or uniform,
ﬁxed boundaries. System restoration may involve the restoration of processes such as
ﬂooding, meandering migration, channel avulsion, the formation and destruction of large
woody debris jams, and backwater sedimentation. Restoration of the natural ﬂuvial processes,
however, presents challenges to engineers because it requires changing rivers from an
understood present condition, to an uncertain, more dynamic future situation. Channel
258
H. Woo

stability analysis, such as bed and bank stability and sediment budgets, of each channel design
scenario, therefore, is essential to a successful river restoration.
Proper approaches should be used to select the channel width, depth, and slope required for
an acceptable level of stability given the water and sediment inﬂows that are anticipated for
the future conditions of the project. The present analytical approaches usually are for
perennial, moderate-to-low energy, single-thread, meandering channels. For the channels
beyond these limitations, therefore, empirical approaches obtained with data sets, similar to
the concerned river condition, or simply a reference reach, may be more plausible to estimate
the design channel geometry.
Proper channel design means a so-called channel in equilibrium, i.e., an incoming sediment
load would pass the designed channel without any signiﬁcant aggradation or degradation of
channel bed and bank scours. Channel design variables, such as the channel width, depth,
slope, hydraulic roughness, and layout of the channel plan form, are usually dependent upon
water discharge, sediment inﬂow, and the river bed and bank characteristics at least for the
engineering time span of about 100 years, not beyond the geologic time span of a thousand or
more years.
In the aspect of sedimentation engineering, two approaches are available: threshold
methods and active-bed methods, depending upon if a channel boundary is mobile or not at
the design discharge [6]. If not, the former method may be used, while if yes, the latter method
should be used. The followings are based on the reference of ASCE [6], pp. 486–491.
3.2.2. Threshold Method
This method is useful and relatively simple where sediment inﬂow is negligible and
the channel boundary is immobile at the design ﬂow. Often, these are the cases of a very
coarse-material bed channel. In these channels, silt/clay and even sand/gravel particles move
as a wash load over the immobile bed material [31]. Selection of the design bed material size,
therefore, is important. Refer to Sect. 9.3.2 Bed Material Size Distribution at Chap. 9 of
Sedimentation Engineering of ASCE [6] for the guidance for sampling bed material. The
problem of this method is that it does not provide unique solutions for the channel geometry
and geomorphic principles may be used for the selection of proper design variables. Two
slightly different methods are available for this approach, namely, “allowable velocity” and
“tractive force” approaches.
A commonly used method for the concept of the threshold method is the allowable velocity
approach of the NRCS [5]. This empirical approach is based on experience and ﬁeld
observations. Readers can refer to Fig. 9.9 at Chap. 9 of Stream Restoration, Sedimentation
Engineering of ASCE [6], for the estimation of allowable velocities for unprotected earth
channels.
A more scientiﬁc, but still empirical approach may be the tractive-force approach where
the channel cross sections and slopes are uniform, the beds are ﬂat, and bed material transport
is negligible, which may be not the usual case for a river restoration. An example of this
approach is shown in Table 4.3 where some values are surveyed and some are calculated using
the various empirical and semiempirical equations. In this table, the ﬁrst four quantities are
River Restoration
259

obtained directly from ﬁeld observations or maps. Design discharge for the tractive-force
approach is usually less than the effective discharge which transports most of the sediment
load over time, since the boundary is immobile under the design discharge condition. In this
example, a return period of 1.5 years is used for the estimation of the design discharge Q1.5yr
using the ﬂood-frequency curve. The width of the channel B is obtained from Hey and
Thorne’s formula. The Shields constant θ is the value for the dimensionless critical tractive
stress in the Shields diagram, which is obtained from an appropriate relationship. In this
example, the values of the Shields constant are suggested to be 10, 1.0, and 0.04 for the

where γs and γw are the unit weights of sediment particle and water, respectively, and Ds is the

in depth at a section can be obtained from a reference reach. Channel shape coefﬁcient a can
be obtained from the literature [32], while Darcy–Weisbach ﬂow resistance coefﬁcient f can
be obtained also from the same literature with a trial value for R. Now, the hydraulic radius
R can be obtained from the simultaneous solution of continuity and mean velocity equations.
The computed value for R is checked against the trial value assumed for the computation of
Darcy f. Now, the bed slope is calculated from RS/R, and the sinuosity of channel is calculated
from the valley slope/channel slope, and channel length is from downvalley distance.
3.2.3. Active-Bed Method
This method should be used for channels with beds that are mobile during high ﬂow events.
This method is more sensitive to the channel geometry relationships and sediment inﬂows
than the threshold method, and needs much attention for proper application. This method is
only applicable for the hydraulic design of channels for single-thread rivers. This method
requires a complicated hydraulic computation, which usually needs sophisticated hydraulic
models in order to simulate the 2- or 3-D nature of river ﬂows. So far, however, only 1-D
models such as SAM [33] or HEC-RAS 3.1 are frequently used for the hydraulic computation
for channel design.
In order to design a channel that ﬂows over a ﬂoodplain for river restoration, at least
the width, depth, and slope should be determined using any reasonable methods followed by
the design of channel alignment. Channel width can be determined using the average of the
measured channel widths from a reference reach, which must be in a state of dynamic
equilibrium and having the same channel-forming discharge. Hydraulic geometry formulas,
based preferably on the analyses of the ﬁeld data that were collected from the river reach with
similar geomorphic and hydraulic conditions, can be used for the determination of the channel
width. Finally, analytical methods using the hydraulic models can be used if a reliable
relationship between width and channel-forming discharge relationship is not available.
Table 4.4 is the example of an active-bed approach for preliminary channel design. The
ﬁrst four quantities are obtained from a ﬁeld survey, topographic map, samples, and sieve
analysis. The design discharge can be obtained using an effective discharge analysis. The
sediment load at design discharge can be obtained using a proper sediment transport equation
such as Brownlie [34] shown in this example and channel geometry at upstream reach.
Channel side slope can be assumed as 1V:1.5H. Manning’s n value for side slopes can be
estimated through actual experiences. The top width B may be obtained from hydraulic
River Restoration
261

geometry formulas based on the data collected from reference reaches. In this example, the
relation of B ¼ 3.6 Q05 is used. Depth and bed slope can be obtained from the simultaneous
solution of sediment transport and uniform ﬂow equations. Brownlie’s friction equation for
bed resistance can be used for the uniform ﬂow equation. Sinuosity can be obtained from a
valley slope/channel slope, and then the channel length is obtained from the calculated
sinuosity multiplied by the downvalley distance.
3.2.4. In-Stream Habitat Structures
In an ideal case of a river restoration, the natural ﬂuvial forms and processes such as ﬂow
dynamics and sediment transport would guide choices for actions, making any artiﬁcial
structural elements for in-channel habitats unnecessary. In many cases, however, river

restoration or making a close-to-nature (Naturnaher in a German word) river work is based
usually on two basic concepts: close-to-nature forms of river and the use of native material for
river works.
Designers of a river restoration should be careful when using the habitat structures of the
followings [4]:
–
Structures should never be viewed as a substitute for good riparian and upland management.
–
Deﬁning the ecological purposes of a structure and site selection is as important as the construction
technique.
–
Scour and deposition are natural stream processes necessary to create habitat. Over stabilization,
therefore, limits habitat potential, whereas properly designed and sited structures can speed
ecological recovery.
–
Use of native materials (stones and wood) is strongly encouraged.
–
Periodic maintenance of structures will be necessary and must be incorporated into project
planning.
Design of in-channel habitat structures may basically proceed following the steps below [35]:
–
Plan layout.
–
Select types of structures.
–
Size the structures.
–
Investigate hydraulic effects.
–
Consider effects on sediment transport.
–
Select materials and design structures.
A plan layout includes the location of each structure, the frequency of structures, spacing of
structures, and avoidance of certain places. As shown in Table 4.5, four major types of habitat
structures are basically available: sills (weirs), deﬂectors (dikes), random rocks (boulders),
and bank covers (lunkers). In addition, substrate reinstatement (artiﬁcial rifﬂe), ﬁsh passage,
and off-channel ponds and coves are widely employed. Fact sheets on several of these
structures are available in the Techniques Appendix of the literature [4]. The ﬂow duration
curves and information on extreme high and low ﬂows are needed for sizing the structures
ensuring the proper functioning of each structure installed. Hydraulic conditions at designed
ﬂow should provide the desired habitat. In many cases, the channel conveyance is important,
and the effect of the proposed structure on stages at high ﬂow should be investigated.
Conversely, the vulnerability of the proposed structure to high ﬂow, such as over-scours
and over-depositions around the structure and an eventual collapse and washout of the
structure, should be checked carefully with model tests or 2-D/3-D hydraulic computations,
if necessary. Also, efforts should be made to predict the locations and the magnitude of local
scours and depositions. Materials used for aquatic habitat structures include stones, fencing
wire, posts, and felled trees. Logs can provide a long service in the channel.
In some cases and places, reintroduction of a speciﬁc fauna to stream and restoration of
in-stream habitat structure for a speciﬁc fauna can be considered. One example for the former
case is beaver reintroduction to forested headwaters, and another example for the latter case is

the salmonid-spawning gravel cleaning and placement, both of which are especially important
in the Northwest region of the USA. Technical guidelines for those restoration are well
described in the literature of WSAHGP [3], and more information on the beaver
reintroduction can be found in recent literature [36, 37].
3.2.5. Riverbank Restoration
In natural rivers, riverbanks are usually ﬂexible and are frequently eroded by ﬂoods thus
river channels are changed, which is of a dynamic nature of rivers. In some cases, however,
riverbanks are required to be ﬁxed either temporarily or permanently [4], pp. 8–61. The ﬁrst
case corresponds to the so-called bondage effect, that is, riverbanks being protected against
erosion until the ﬂoodplain restoration is complete. In these situations, the initial bank
protection may be provided primarily with vegetation, wood, and rock as necessary.
The second case corresponds to ensuring permanent river stability for land development or
modiﬁed ﬂow, and vegetation is used primarily to address the speciﬁc ecological deﬁciencies
such as a lack of channel shading.
Soil bioengineering, a method that uses live plants and other natural material for the control
of soil slope and banks, is frequently used for both temporarily or permanently stabilizing
riverbanks. Any particular site must be evaluated to determine how vegetation can or cannot
be used. Soil cohesiveness, the presence of gravel lenses, ice accumulation patterns, the
amount of sunlight that reaches the bank, and the ability to ensure that grazing would be
precluded are all considerations in assessing the suitability of vegetation to achieve bank
stabilization.
Existing riverbank stabilization techniques can be categorized into three types: armor with
rocks and stones, armor combined with plants, and vegetative methods. Vegetative methods
alone are sufﬁcient on some rivers and streams or some bank zones, but as erosive forces
increase, they can be combined with other materials, such as rocks, logs or brush, and natural
fabrics. The literature [4] introduces, in its appendices, the various techniques for riverbank
stabilization, which can be categorized into the above three types. They are:
–
Type of armor: riprap, stone toe protection, and dead tree revetment
–
Type of vegetative methods: live stakes, live fascine, dormant and post plantings, and brush
mattresses
–
Type of mixed methods: coconut ﬁber roll, vegetated gabions, joint planting, live cribwalls,
log/rootward/boulder revetments, and vegetated geogrids
3.2.6. Channel–Floodplain Connectivity
Past river-engineering activities focused primarily on the protection of ﬂoodplains against
ﬂoods, which have caused degradation of the ecosystems of the ﬂoodplains. Hydrologic
interaction
between
a
ﬂoodplain
and
channel
is
ecologically
important,
and
the
reestablishment of the ﬂoodplain functions by frequent inundations is sometimes a goal of
river restoration works.
River Restoration
265

Several types of channel–ﬂoodplain connections can be identiﬁed: a levee breaching, a
levee setback, a levee removal, and a direct reconnection by side-/off-channel restorations.
Levee breaching allows pastures or gravel pits to ﬂood during high-water periods. It can be an
excellent option where a levee removal or setback is unfeasible because there is no large
equipment or well-established vegetation. Levee breaching still allows for some level of
inundation of the ﬂoodplain, ﬂoodwater storage, sediment deposition, and refuge areas for
terrestrial and aquatic species, although not to the same extent as a levee removal or setback.
A levee setback is a good option for areas where levee overtopping is common and where
signiﬁcant land uses are unlikely to occur. It requires the same construction components as
removal, in addition to rebuilding the levee itself. One of the greatest advantages of a levee
setback is that it allows for the seasonal use of land within the newly established ﬂoodway and
greater ﬂood protection.
Levee removal can be well adopted in the case of relatively low and/or short levees
denuded of vegetation, if the costs of removal and disposal of levee materials is given. The
cost usually includes those for the removal and disposal of the levee material (sediment).
A direct reconnection of a channel and a ﬂoodplain can be considered particularly where
major ﬂoodplain development occurs. It can provide two physical and biological effects: side-
and/or off-channel restoration as well as the ﬂoodplain restoration itself. Side- and/or
off-channel habitats are generally small watered remnants of major river meanders across
the ﬂoodplain. They are naturally abandoned river channels, oxbows, ﬂood swales, and
sometimes the lower ends of terrace tributaries ﬂowing out onto the ﬂoodplains. They also
include constructed channels and connecting ponds that could have been built speciﬁcally for
an aquatic habitat or indirectly for other purposes such as gravel mining. Side- and/or
off-channel restoration works usually include the construction, restoration, and reconnection
of side channels to the main channel and protection of these areas by controlling the river and
ﬂood ﬂow from the main river and capitalizing on the availability of ﬂoodplain groundwater.
There are two types of side-channel restoration [3]: a new side channel that focuses on the
creation of self-sustaining side channels, which are maintained through natural processes, and
the reconnection of an existing side-channel habitat that focuses on the restoration of ﬁsh
access and habitat-forming processes.
3.2.7. Riparian Restoration
Riparian zones are deﬁned as the land adjacent to streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and some
wetlands, whose soils and vegetation are inﬂuenced by the presence of the ponded or
channelized water. Riparian zones include both the active ﬂoodplain and the adjacent plant
communities that directly inﬂuence the stream system by providing shade, ﬁne or large woody
material, nutrients, organic and inorganic debris, terrestrial insects, and a habitat for riparian-
associated wildlife.
Riparian habitats may consist of side channels, off-channel ponds and wetlands, perennial
or intermittent streams and springs, and periodically ﬂooded grasslands and forests. These
habitats offer feeding, reproduction, and refuge habitats for invertebrates, ﬁsh, waterfowl,
amphibians, birds, and mammals.
266
H. Woo

Large-scale riparian restoration projects may require the acquisition and procurement of
large amounts of plant materials. Local stocks of native plants would be best suited to the site
conditions. Some of the required plant material can be transplanted or cut from an adjacent
healthy donor or sites near the project area.
Riparian restoration may be employed as a stand-alone technique or used in conjunction
with other stream restoration and enhancement efforts. Riparian restoration and management
may be undertaken on sites ranging from narrow stream fringes characterized by sharp
transitions to an upland habitat to wide riparian corridors with gradual transitions to adjacent
uplands.
In addition, a riparian buffer or corridor, a narrow, long patch along the stream, can buffer a
stream from adjacent land uses in the ecological as well as the physical aspects and promote
channel stability. As previously mentioned in Sect. 2.1, a natural riparian corridor has various
ecological functions of a habitat, barrier, conduit, ﬁlter, source, and sink. Removal of riparian
vegetation for agricultural or urban developmental purposes, therefore, decreases or
completely destroys those valuable ecological functions of a habitat of wildlife or ﬁltering
of nonpoint pollutants that are incoming to rivers.
Table 4.6 shows a general guideline of a riparian buffer strip width for the riparian
restoration and management [38]. Ranges of the widths shown in this table is a synopsis of
the values as reported in the literature. Figure 4.11 shows a sketch of a riparian buffer strip.
The width of the buffer to be restored or enhanced will be site speciﬁc, dictated by budget
constraints, land ownership, infrastructure, and valley width.
For river corridor restoration and management, the followings are recommended (cited
from the literature [38]):
–
Think at a watershed scale when planning for or managing corridors. Many species that primarily
use upland habitats may, at some stage of their life cycle, need to use corridors or a habitat,
movements, or dispersal.
–
Corridors that maintain or restore natural connectivity are better than those that link areas that were
historically unconnected.
–
Continuous corridors are better than fragmented corridors.
–
Wider corridors are better than narrow corridors.
–
Riparian corridors are more valuable than other types of corridors because of habitat heterogeneity
and the availability of food and water.
–
Several corridor connections are better than a single connection.
–
Structurally diverse corridors are better than structurally simple corridors.
–
Native vegetation in corridors is better than nonnative vegetation.
–
Practice ecological management of corridors, burn, ﬂood, open canopy, etc., if it mimics naturally
occurring historical disturbance processes.
–
Manage the matrix with wildlife in mind; apply principles relative to the native plant and animal
communities in the area.

government have built and reinforced numerous dikes along the rivers for ﬂood control
purposes. With the 1993 and 1995 ﬂoods, however, they have recognized that sea levels
rise and higher river discharges due to the forecast of climate change would nullify the present
measures of ﬂood control and therefore decided in 2007 to adopt a new paradigm of river
management, Room for the River. This means to provide more space to a river for increasing
the ﬂood conveyance capacity of the river.
Figure 4.12 shows the various types of measures, under the catchphrase of “Room for the
River,” to secure more spaces for the river. In this ﬁgure, no. 7 of “removing summer bank”
corresponds to a levee removal in the “channel–ﬂoodplain connectivity”; no. 8 of “digging
secondary channel” corresponds to the side-channel restoration; no. 9 of “lowering of the
embanked ﬂoodplain,” which may be done only at the silted and aggraded ﬂoodplains,
corresponds to a riparian restoration since the development of riparian plants such as Salix
and Populus are expected with the reestablishment of frequently ﬂooded areas; no. 10 of
“nature development” may correspond to a part of riparian restoration; and no. 13 of “dike
repositioning” corresponds to a levee setback in a “channel–ﬂoodplain connectivity.” With
these ﬂood control measures, the possibilities of successful ecological restoration of the river
can be high.
4. RESTORATION IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING,
AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT
This section describes how to implement a planned and designed restoration project for a
site-speciﬁc ﬁtting, how to monitor the outcome of the restoration effort, and how to activate
an adaptive management for the completion of a restoration project.

River Restoration
269

4.1. Restoration Implementation
In order to implement a restoration project, the technical aspects of site preparation, site
clearing, construction, inspection, and maintenance should all be considered. There are some
major elements of restoration implementation, starting from a review of the restoration
implementation plan, site preparation, site clearing, installation and construction, site recla-
mation/cleanup, inspection, and ﬁnally on to maintenance. The followings are based on the
literature [4], pp. 9–3 ~ 9–29.
Implementation of river restoration project can be preceded by careful planning such as:
–
Determining a schedule
–
Obtaining necessary permits
–
Conducting a pre-implementation meeting
–
Informing and involving property owners
–
Securing site access and easements
–
Locating existing facilities
–
Conﬁrming sources of materials and ensuring standards of materials
Site preparation requires several actions including, among others, the delineation of work
zones, preparation for access and staging areas, taking precautions to minimize any distur-
bances, and obtaining the appropriate equipment. Several methods for taking precautions to
minimize disturbance can be conceivable, such as protecting the existing vegetation and
sensitive habitats, soil erosion, water and air qualities, cultural resources, noise and solid
waste disposal, and worksite sanitation.
The next step is site clearing, involving the marking of geographic limits, removal of
undesirable plant species, addressing site drainage issues, and protecting and managing
desirable existing vegetation.
The third step regards the activities of the installation and construction such as earthmov-
ing, diversion of ﬂow, and the installation of plant materials. Earthmoving activities include
ﬁll placement and disposal, contouring, and ﬁnal grading. Installation of plant material is an
important part of most restoration initiatives that require active restoration. The timing of the
installation of plant material is most important, as it varies by species and regions. Transpor-
tation and storage also vary, according to the types of planting, such as seeds, live cutting, and
rooted stock. Planting should be based on some principles, which in general rely on the types
of soils and planting methods. Other considerations on the installation of plant material
include the treatment of competing plants, use of chemicals, use of mulches, irrigation,
and fencing.
The forth step is the inspection, periodic ones during implementation and a ﬁnal one after
installation, and thus is a critical process for the success of restoration works. Finally,
maintenance is the repairing work based on any problems noted in annual inspections. Two
types of maintenance are identiﬁed: remedial maintenance and scheduled maintenance. The
former is the results of the annual inspection, while the latter is performed at intervals that are
preestablished during the design phase or based on project-speciﬁc needs.

4.2. Monitoring Techniques
Appropriate monitoring techniques should be considered for the evaluation of restoration
efforts. The monitoring of restoration works may be conducted for a number of different
purposes including [4]:
–
Performance evaluation, which assesses in terms of project implementation and ecological
effectiveness
–
Trend assessment, which includes longer term sampling to evaluate changing ecological conditions
at various spatial and temporal scales
–
Risk assessment, which is used to identify causes and sources of impairment within an ecosystem
–
Baseline characterization, which is used to quantify ecological processes operating in a
particular area
Performance evaluation monitoring usually includes three different types of monitoring,
depending upon the purpose of monitoring, i.e., implementation monitoring, effectiveness
monitoring, and validation monitoring. The ﬁrst type concerns if the restoration works are
implemented correctly and properly according to the plan and design of the restoration
project. The second type concerns if the restoration works achieve the desired results or
goals of the project. This type of monitoring requires a systematic work of monitoring with
proper indicators, closely linked with the project goals, to measure the performance of the
project. The third type is to check if the assumptions and hypothesis used for the design of a
restoration project are correct. This type of monitoring is usually used when restoration work
are out of the intended scope or goals, even if implementation work was proven to have been
correctly performed by the implementation monitoring.
The monitoring program should be carefully planned along with the time when a restora-
tion project is planned. In New Zealand practice [41], appropriate indicators (or parameters)
are set for each project goal, such as the natural habitat, water quality, ecosystem functioning,
aquatic biodiversity, terrestrial biodiversity, downstream health, recreation, cultural, aes-
thetics, and ﬁsheries. The key step in designing a monitoring program begins with identifying
project goals and catchment constraints, understating the restoration site, and having a clear
image of the project goal or reference site. Appropriate indicators to measure goals of a
restoration project should be carefully chosen. Then, identiﬁcation of the criteria to judge
success for each indicator should be followed and, ﬁnally, the appropriate methods and time
scales, such as when to measure should be determined.
Various types of physical and biological parameters (or indicators) are considered for the
evaluation of restoration works. Table 4.7 shows physical parameters in the establishment of
evaluation criteria for the measurement of physical performance and stability.
When water quality is an important goal of a restoration project, chemical parameters
should be collected and monitored. Important chemical and physical parameters for that might
have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the aquatic habitat are as follows [4]:
–
Temperature
–
Turbidity
–
Dissolved oxygen

Biological monitoring can cover a broad range of organisms, riparian conditions, and sam-
pling techniques. Table 4.8 shows the biological attributes of a stream ecosystem that may be
related to restoration goals.
Chemical monitoring can be conducted in conjunction with biological monitoring. Impor-
tant chemical and physical parameters that may have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on biological
systems include the following [4]:
–
Temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH, natural toxics (mercury), and manufactured toxins
–
Flow, nutrients, organic loading (BOD, TOC), alkalinity/acidity, and hardness
–
Dissolved and suspended solids, channel characteristics, spawning gravel, stream cover, shade,
pool/rifﬂe ratio, springs and groundwater seeps, bed material load, and amount and size distribution
of large woody debris
4.3. Adaptive Management
Adaptive management is the process for establishing checkpoints to determine whether
proper actions have been taken and are effective in providing the desired results. It is not a
trial and error approach. It is the ﬂexibility to detect when changes are needed to achieve
success and to be able to make the necessary midcourse or short-term corrections. The
necessity of adaptive management can be determined through the implementation, effective-
ness, and validation components of the performance monitoring. Through these monitoring
processes, a restoration project can be tested if the hypothesis that the restoration planning and
design is based on a good understanding of the watershed processes and appropriately
addresses adverse changes in these processes and related ecological functions.

Adaptive management provides an alternative approach to traditional planning procedures
for the design and implementation of programs and projects that seek to manage and/or
restore natural systems [42]. It replaces the current dependencies on numerical models and
traditional planning guidelines by applying a focused “learning-by-doing” approach to
decision-making. The “learning-by-doing” approach is proactive—it is an iterative and
deliberate process of applying principles of scientiﬁc investigation to the design and imple-
mentation of restoration projects to better understand the ecosystem and to reduce the key
uncertainties, as a basis for continuously reﬁning the project design and operation. New
information that can guide a project plan can include results gained from scientiﬁc research
and monitoring, new or updated modeling information gleaned from iterative project imple-
mentation, and as an input from managers and the public.
A useful review and analysis of the applications of adaptive management in some river
restoration projects in the USA is available from the Water Resources Collections and
Archives, University of California [43], which focuses on (1) how adaptive management is
being applied in river restoration, (2) why practitioners are using adaptive management, and
(3) how well the adaptive management is working.
An idealized cycle of adaptive management includes the following sequence of steps,
which are continually repeated [43]:
1.
Establish a stakeholder adaptive management team.
2.
Deﬁne the problem(s) to be addressed.
3.
Establish goals and objectives.
4.
Specify a conceptual model that expresses the collective understanding of how the system in
question functions, highlighting any key uncertainties and acknowledging factors that are outside
of the system.
5.
Develop hypotheses about the effects of different management actions that address the
uncertainties.
6.
Design management experiments/interventions to test hypotheses while meeting management
goals.
7.
Design a monitoring plan to measure the impact(s) of management interventions.
8.
Implement management interventions.
9.
Monitor.
10.
Evaluate the impacts in terms of management goals and hypotheses.
11.
Reassess and adjust the problem statement, goals, conceptual model, interventions, and the
monitoring plan.
In the above, steps of 1 through 3 correspond to the planning stage, while steps 4 through
6 differ from the conventional way of designing a restoration project, since in the adaptive
management concept, uncertainties in the planning and design of a project are assessed and
different management actions are considered to compare their performances with each other.
Step 7 corresponds to designing the monitoring plan, while step 8 corresponds to the
implementing stage according to the plan and the design of the project. Finally, step
9 corresponds to the monitoring stage of the project after implementation, step 10 corresponds
to the evaluation stage of the performance of the project, and step 11 is to reassess, if
necessary, and adjust the project plan in the contexts of the project goals.

Abstract Reservoirs have traditionally been designed to operate for periods of 50–100 years
without impairment by sedimentation. However, aging reservoirs are now experiencing
sedimentation problems that were ignored by the original designers, and to sustain their
utilization, it is now necessary to redeﬁne operations and modify structures to manage
sediment. This chapter outlines the basic concepts and strategies to consider in predicting
and evaluating reservoir sedimentation, in determining the time frame and severity of the
problem, and in selecting an appropriate course of action. Strategies from the watershed to the
dam are described which can contribute to the achievement of long-term sustainable use.

1. INTRODUCTION
Dams and reservoirs interrupt the transport of sediment along a river, trapping sediment in
the low-velocity reach above the dam while the reach below the dam, which no longer
receives coarse suspended or bed material, tends to erode. The ﬂuvial system will eventually
restore the sediment balance across the impounded reach by completely ﬁlling the reservoir
and reestablishing sediment discharge below the dam. As an alternative, the impounded river
reach can be managed to improve the balance between sediment inﬂow and discharge to
sustain beneﬁcial storage. The ultimate objective of sediment management in reservoirs is to
retard storage loss and to achieve a sediment balance in an economical and environmentally
responsible manner while maximizing sustained long-term beneﬁts from the reservoir.
Ours is, above all, a hydraulic society, particularly from the standpoint of food production.
Of global consumptive water use, consisting of water evaporated, incorporated into products
or polluted, 86 % is appropriated by agriculture, with only 9 % and 5 % respectively attributed
to industrial and domestic use [1]. Flow regulation by reservoirs adds about 460 km3/year to
the world’s irrigation supply, a 40 % increase above naturally available supplies [2]. Addi-
tionally, about 20 % of the world’s electricity is produced by hydropower, a non-consumptive
use, but which also depends on reservoir storage to sustain hydropower production through
the dry season. Even run-of-river plants need to maintain a limited volume of storage to
supply power during daily periods of peak demand.
Reservoirs have traditionally been designed based on the “life of reservoir” concept. Under
this paradigm, the designer estimates the rate of sediment inﬂow and provides storage
capacity for 50–100 years of sediment accumulation, thus postponing the sedimentation
problem. Not only does this approach ignore the long-term problem of storage loss, but at
many sites sedimentation problems are occurring much earlier than anticipated because
sediment yield was underestimated or, due to increased sediment yield resulting from changed
land use. This traditional approach may also fail to anticipate rapid sedimentation in areas
which interfere with recreational uses, intake function, etc. In multipurpose reservoirs, the
normally empty ﬂood control pool may receive little sediment, while the conservation pool at
the bottom of the reservoir loses capacity rapidly. But most importantly, many reservoirs have
now seen more than 50 years of operation and are now beginning to experience sedimentation
problems that were “pushed into the future” by the original designers.
Reservoir operation is not sustainable unless sedimentation can be controlled, and in our
hydraulic society reservoirs may represent the most important class of non-sustainable
infrastructure. Yet, despite increased knowledge of sedimentation processes and control
methods, and the acknowledged need for sustainable design, most reservoirs continue to be
designed and operated based on the traditional concept of a ﬁnite reservoir life, giving little
consideration to maintaining long-term storage [3]. This chapter introduces strategies for
managing sediments to maintain long-term reservoir capacity. This is a complex topic and
only basic concepts are provided here. More comprehensive sources of information are listed
at the end of this chapter.

2. RESERVOIR CONSTRUCTION AND SEDIMENTATION
The history of ancient dams has been reported by Schnitter [4], who listed over 12 dams
which have seen over 2,000 years of service. The record for most years in operation appears
to be held by Egypt’s Mala’a reservoir constructed by King Amenemhet III (1842–1798/95
BCE) in the Faiyum depression about 90 km southwest of Cairo and reconstructed in the
third century BCE with a dam 8 km long and 7 m high. This 275 Mm3 off-channel
impoundment stored water diverted from the Nile and remained in operation until the
eighteenth century, a span of 3,600 years. The largest number of ancient structures was
built by the Romans, and other long-lived ancient structures are reported in Greece, Sri
Lanka, and China. If properly maintained, the life of a dam can be virtually unlimited. For
example, the Proserpina reservoir at Me´rida, Spain, constructed by the Romans in the second
century, continues in use today. Reservoirs are the longest lived of all functional engineering
works. Pyramids may be older, but they are monuments rather than functional engineering
infrastructure.
Most dam construction has been undertaken during the last half of the twentieth century,
which saw the worldwide increase in inventory of large dams (>15 m tall) from 5,000 to
40,000. During this same period in China, which is heavily dependent on irrigation supplies
from reservoirs, the number of large dams increased from under a dozen to 22,000 [5]. China
today has about half the world’s large dams. However, the rate of dam construction declined
dramatically worldwide toward the end of the twentieth century as many of the best available
reservoir sites in developed regions were consumed, and resistance to dam construction grew
from the increased competition for land resources inundated by reservoirs and in response to
adverse social and environmental impacts.
In contrast to the decline in the rate of new dam construction, the rate of storage loss from
sedimentation has been steadily increasing. Estimates of average global rate of storage loss
worldwide vary from Mahmood’s [6] estimate of 1 % to White’s [7] estimate of 0.5 %.
Sedimentation is now estimated to reduce global reservoir capacity at the rate of 40 km3/year,
or about 0.6 % annually based on the current global reservoir capacity of approximately
7,000 km3 [8]. Using the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD) database,
Basson [8] estimated that about 1,400 km3 of capacity has already been lost to sedimentation,
equivalent to 20 % of total original storage capacity (Table 5.1). Reservoir storage is now
being lost much faster than it is being created.
Rates of storage loss are highly variable, ranging from about 0.1 % per year in Great Britain
to 2.3 % per year in China [7]. Within a given country or region, there is also a wide variation
in the rates of storage loss; some reservoirs already have serious problems while centuries of
unimpaired operation remain at others. Average rates of storage loss in different regions of
South Africa, for example, range from <0.2 % to 3 % per year [9], and the variation in loss
rates for individual dams is far greater.
New reservoir construction to offset sedimentation is frequently not a viable option once
reservoirs have been developed within a region. There are relatively few locations both
topographically and geologically suitable for reservoir construction, lands both upstream
and downstream have often become occupied, and heightening of the dam to add storage

may not be viable due to both structural and upstream land use limitations. Development of
a new reservoir at a distant site may not be economically viable, and water is costly to
transport long distances, even if the political and environmental conditions allow such
development and water transfers.
Due to the lack of available undeveloped sites, the problem of storage loss by sedimen-
tation cannot be solved by new reservoir construction. This can be appreciated by viewing
the global data [10] summarized in Fig. 5.1. Storage volume increases rapidly during the
initial period of rapid dam construction. During this period, the rate of storage loss by
sedimentation increases slowly. However, once the new construction rate declines, storage

loss by sedimentation will exceed the rate that volume is added by new construction and
declining capacity becomes the predominate trend. Similar patterns also result from
plotting regional or national data. Two additional trends worsen the impact of the stagna-
tion and subsequent decline in reservoir capacity. First, population is increasing, which
means that the storage capacity on a per capita basis will decline much more rapidly than
total storage capacity. Because of population increase, the volume of storage on a per
capita basis began declining even before overall storage capacity began to decline. Second,
climate change is ushering a period of more extreme weather, particularly drought sever-
ity. This means that the yield available from reservoirs will decline, not only because of
storage loss, but also as a result of increased climatic variability. The developed world
cannot return to high rates of new reservoir construction because a large inventory of
undeveloped dam sites no longer exists. With new construction constrained, to sustain
long-term capacity requires that existing reservoirs be actively managed to reduce the rate
of storage loss.
Most dams are relatively young, and engineering experience to date has focused primarily
on structures not yet experiencing signiﬁcant sedimentation problems. However, this situation
is changing as sediment accumulates, and the twenty-ﬁrst century will see water resource
engineers increasingly focus on the management of existing dams and reservoirs to achieve
sustainable operation.
3. RESERVOIRS AND SUSTAINABILITY
3.1. Economic Analysis and Sustainable Use
Although economic analysis has long been the basis for decision-making in the water
resources sector, it has important well-known limitations in counting impacts to affected third
parties, including future generations, and to nonmarket values such as the environment.
Financial analysis discounts future cash ﬂows as compared to current income or expense,
logically representing our preference for immediate rather than future income by expressing
future value as a time-discounted present value. The present value (PV) for an income or
expense amount A, which occurs N years in the future, may be computed for an annual
discount rate, i, expressed as a decimal value (i.e., 7 % ¼ 0.07) by
PV ¼ A= 1 þ i
ð
ÞN
ð5:1Þ
Use of discounting helps focus development activity on projects with near-term beneﬁts as
opposed to projects with less-certain distant future beneﬁts. However, discounting removes
economic incentives to incur costs today for actions to sustain long-term operation. This will
be illustrated by an example.
Consider the two cash ﬂows shown in Fig. 5.2 which compares Project #1 with beneﬁts
initially at $100/year but declining to zero at year 30, against Project #2 with a sustainable
beneﬁt of $90/year which extends indeﬁnitely into the future. Using a 30-year horizon for
ﬁnancial planning and a 7 % discount rate, the present value of Project #1 is higher than
Sediment Management and Sustainable Use of Reservoirs
283

Project #2, and from a ﬁnancial standpoint Project #1 is preferred over the sustainable option.
This illustrates the effect that ﬁnancial analysis can have in directing investment toward
measures with near-term beneﬁts but lacking long-term sustainability.
3.2. Sustainability Criteria
Public policy in the form of legislation and regulations is used to protect third parties and
the environment from failings of the economic marketplace. The concept of sustainable
development attempts to establish a more holistic framework for project decision-making
and speciﬁcally includes issues of intergenerational equity, those long-term consequences of
today’s actions that will affect our children and grandchildren but which may be discounted
out of project ﬁnancing decisions.
The 1987 report to the United Nations by World Commission on Environment and
Development titled “Our Common Future” [11] explicitly brought the rights of and our
obligations to future generations, stating: “Humanity has the ability to make development
sustainable—to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability
of future generations to meet their own needs.” An international team of experts reviewed the
implications of sustainability to water resources projects, stating that “Most deﬁnitions of
sustainable development include three broad notions: justice to nature, justice to future
generations, justice within our generation” [12]. Economic performance is not excluded
from the sustainability equation, but is recognized as one of several complementary factors
which, together, result in sustainable activities. Despite widespread agreement on the general
form of sustainability goals, it has been most difﬁcult to establish speciﬁc project criteria. The
issue of sustainability associated with dam construction has been addressed by the World
Commission on Dams (WCD) [5] and the International Hydropower Association (IHA) in its
Fig. 5.2. Present values of two future income streams with a 7 % annual discount rate.
284
G.L. Morris

Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol [13]. While the WCD gives greater emphasis
to social and equity issues, the IHA’s approach is more closely aligned with achieving
economic performance and efﬁciency. However, neither the WCD nor IHA explicitly focuses
on long-term sustainable use. For example, the IHA deﬁnes “long term” as “the planned life of
the hydropower project.”
Reservoirs are expected to serve not only the present but the future as well, and cities and
societies are built using water from reservoirs based on this assumption. A sustainable
approach to reservoir design and management does not accept as inevitable obsolescence
by sedimentation, but rather seeks to design and actively manage reservoirs to sustain long-
term beneﬁcial use, even though the long-term beneﬁts may differ in both magnitude and
character from the original design purpose. Nevertheless, it is not always appropriate to
sustain the operation of every reservoir, as beneﬁts may not always justify the cost of sediment
management. Facility retirement and removal should always be considered as a management
option. Sediment management also plays a major role in the abandonment and removal of
dams, since dam removal can release large volumes of sediment with signiﬁcant downstream
consequences. For example, retirement of the small San Clemente dam on the Carmel River,
impounding less than 2 Mm3 of volume, is expected to cost over $75 M, with the largest cost
component associated with management of the 1.9 Mm3 of sediment that now occupies most
of the original reservoir storage volume [14].
4. SEDIMENTATION PROCESSES AND IMPACTS
4.1. Longitudinal Sedimentation Patterns
A deﬁnition diagram showing the idealized conﬁguration of sediment deposits in reservoirs
is presented as Fig. 5.3. Based on analysis of data from hundreds of reservoir surveys, Ferrari
[15] noted that most sediment inﬂow tends to deposit either in the delta or along the reservoir
thalweg. Deltaic deposits consisting of coarser sediment dominate in some reservoirs, while in
others delta deposits may be essentially absent and most volume loss will consist of ﬁner
sediment, often transported by turbid density currents. More typically reservoirs will exhibit
some combination of these two patterns. This general pattern can be complicated by the effect
of sediment inputs from multiple tributaries and the reworking of sediment as reservoir level
varies, plus the effect of extreme ﬂoods and reservoir drawdown which may carry coarser
sediment deeper into the reservoir. It is important to determine where sediment is being
deposited since even a small percentage of capacity loss can be problematic if deposited
in front of outlet works, in navigation channels, and in the delta creating backwater
ﬂooding. In multipurpose reservoirs sedimentation will affect different beneﬁcial pools to
varying degrees.
Longitudinal proﬁles characteristically show a rapid initial change in the bottom conﬁgu-
ration in the delta and also near the dam when turbidity currents are important. This initial
rapid change in the reservoir proﬁle corresponds to the deposition of material in zones of the
reservoir with only limited storage capacity. Thus, if 30 m of sediment depth has been

285

deposited in front of the dam in the ﬁrst 20 years of operation, the top of the sediment bed will
not rise an additional 30 m during the next 20 years; the rate of rise will decline over time
because each depth increment requires more volume to ﬁll. Compaction of ﬁne sediment can
also reduce the subsequent rate of volume loss.
4.2. Reservoir Deltas
When a river enters a reservoir the velocity rapidly diminishes. Bed material transport stops
and the coarsest fraction of the suspended load settles rapidly, creating a deltaic depositional
pattern which begins at the upstream end of the reservoir and advances downstream. Gravels
and cobbles may dominate delta deposits in steep mountain streams, but deltas may consist of
ﬁne sand and coarse silts in reservoirs impounding low-gradient streams. The downstream
limit of the delta deposit is delimited by a change in grain size and also by its geomorphic
expression as a slope change, although the characteristic delta shape is not always evident in
reservoirs with limited bed material transport or wide variations in water level [16]. Delta
deposits can be extensively reworked and coarse material moved further into the pool by
reservoir drawdown or large ﬂoods. The topset slope of reservoir deltas is frequently about
half the original channel slope [17]. Deltas can also advance upstream, raising backwater
levels and causing deposition to occur above the maximum pool level.
An example of deltaic type deposition is illustrated in the sedimentation study of Peligre
hydropower and irrigation reservoir in Haiti [18]. At this reservoir, the predominant grain size
outside of the river channel is classed as silt based on sedimentation velocity in native water
and without using a dispersant to deﬂocculate clays. Constructed in 1956, the reservoir had
lost 50 % of its total capacity by 2008. The longitudinal pattern of sediment deposition is

observed in Fig. 5.4, showing deposits advancing toward the dam, but the top of the delta
deposit is well below the maximum pool level. A photograph of the reservoir bed during a
seasonal drawdown (Fig. 5.5) shows the following: (1) seasonal utilization of exposed
sediment for agriculture, (2) river channel meandering across seasonally submerged sediment
deposits, and (3) focusing of sediment along the banks of the channel with less deposition
along the margins of the reservoir. The concentration of sediment deposits along the main
ﬂow path, with less deposition in the reservoir branches, may also be observed in other
heavily sedimented reservoirs.
4.3. Turbid Density Currents
In many reservoirs the coarse sediment which deposits into the delta comprises less than
10 % of the inﬂowing load, and most inﬂowing sediments consist of ﬁnes smaller than
0.062 mm (smaller than sand) which can be transported along the ﬂoor of the reservoir by
turbid density currents. Turbidity currents are created by the density difference between the
sediment-laden inﬂowing load and the clear water in the reservoir. Suspended sediment can
easily create density differences much greater than those resulting from temperature differ-
ences, and the resulting gravity-driven current can carry sediment long distances along the

bottom of the reservoir. For example, turbid density currents were documented to carry
sediment-laden water 129 km along the bottom of Lake Mead prior to construction of Glen
Canyon dam upstream [19]. Turbid density currents are particularly important in explaining
both the mode of transport and the observed deposition patterns for ﬁne sediment, and high-
velocity turbidity currents can also redistribute ﬁne sediment within reservoirs by scouring
submerged material and transporting it closer to the dam. For example, scouring of submerged
deposits by turbidity currents having velocities as high as 2.5 m/s has been documented at the
Luzzone reservoir in Switzerland [20].
Several characteristics and indicators of turbid density currents are illustrated in Fig. 5.6.
When turbid ﬂow enters a reservoir and plunges this underﬂow pulls along with it part of the
clear water impounded in the reservoir, thereby inducing a surface countercurrent of clear
water at the plunge point. The downstream river ﬂow and the induced upstream ﬂow converge
at the plunge point and ﬂoating debris carried into the reservoir will be trapped at this point of
ﬂow convergence. Floating material such as woody debris and logs can accumulate as
massive debris dams blocking the entire width of the reservoir at the plunge point. Muddy
surface water will be observed upstream of the plunge point, but surface water will be clear
downstream of this point. The release of turbid water from low-level outlets, such as deep
power intakes, while water on the surface of the reservoir at the dam remains clear, is a visual
indicator that turbid density currents are reaching the dam. Another indicator is given by
bathymetric data. If horizontal sediment beds extend upstream from the dam, this indicates
that turbid currents are transporting a signiﬁcant sediment load to the dam to create a

submerged muddy lake from which the sediments have settled to create horizontal deposits
(see Fig. 5.6). Turbid density currents can also be responsible for sedimentation near the dam
even when the deposition pattern does not create horizontal beds. Turbid may not form if the
reservoir is not deep enough or has insufﬁcient concentration of ﬁne sediment. In reservoirs
with cold deep water, turbid inﬂows may be much warmer and lack sufﬁcient suspended
sediment to plunge beneath the cold bottom water. In this case, the turbid water may stay on
the surface or may plunge only to the level of the thermocline separating warm surface water
from deeper cold water.
The gravity-driven forward motion of the turbidity current creates turbulence which
sustains sediment in suspension, but as sediment settles out the density difference and
gravitational force driving the current diminish causing it to slow down. This allows more
sediments to settle, further diminishing the density difference and the forces driving the
current forward. By this means, the current may dissipate before reaching the dam while
delivering sediment along the bottom of the reservoir. Sediment deposited by these currents as
they ﬂow along the reservoir thalweg inﬁlls the cross section from the bottom up to create ﬂat-
bottomed cross sections (Fig. 5.7). Flood discharge, suspended sediment grain size, and
concentration all vary over the duration of a ﬂood, and consequently turbid density currents
are unsteady with respect to discharge, sediment concentration, grain size distribution,
velocity, and thickness.
Turbidity current velocities vary with changes in both sediment concentration (density of
the turbid ﬂow) and bottom slope. The propagation of turbidity currents along the bottom of
the reservoir is dependent on the submerged geometry, and their behavior can be greatly
modiﬁed by changes in subsurface geometry through sedimentation or modiﬁcation of
sediment deposits by reservoir ﬂushing or dredging. When the reservoir is newly impounded,

mon for muddy water to pass through low-level outlets although the surface water in the reservoir is

the turbidity current can ﬂow along the original river channel, producing a thick and compact
current with a low wetted perimeter. However, as the original channel is ﬁlled, the reservoir
bottom becomes wide and ﬂat, and the turbidity current itself becomes wide and shallow,
greatly increasing the frictional effects on both the top and bottom of the current, retarding its
motion. This effect was noted as early as 1954 by Lane [22], who observed that turbidity
currents reached Elephant Butte dam on the Rı´o Grande in New Mexico during the initial
years of impounding but thereafter dissipated before reaching the dam. Turbidity currents can
also overﬂow submerged barriers such as a submerged cofferdam.
4.4. Reservoir Volume Loss and Reservoir Half-Life
The loss of reservoir volume by sedimentation can reduce water supply yield or ﬂood
control beneﬁts. Sediment accumulation can also cause coarse sediment to be delivered to or
clog intakes, obstruct navigational channels and access to marinas or other shoreside facili-
ties, reduce recreational value, and modify reservoir ecology including loss of ﬁsh habitat and
conversion of open water ﬁrst into wetlands and then to uplands. When the reservoir is drawn
down, ﬁne sediment deposits dried and exposed to wind can produce noxious dust storms.
Reservoirs with turbid density currents have experienced operational problems at intakes near
the dam due to sedimentation after losing only a few percentage of their capacity. Because the
original design purpose of the reservoir will become seriously affected once half the original

capacity is lost (if not much earlier), reservoir half-life (1/2 of original volume ﬁlled with
sediment) is a much better indicator of the period of operational utility than is “reservoir life”
based on 100 % storage loss.
Absent ﬂow regulation by reservoirs, ﬁrm yield is limited to the natural minimum
streamﬂow, which in arid regions may seasonally decline to zero. On a given stream, and at
a given level of water supply reliability, an increase in storage volume will produce an
increment in yield. The relationship between storage volume and water supply yield can be
expressed by a storage–yield relationship. These curves exhibit diminishing marginal yield
increments as reservoir volume increases, resulting in curves having the shape shown in
Fig. 5.8. Reliability may be expressed as the percentage of days that the water supply is
available at the stated yield. Different curves can be computed for different levels of
reliability. As illustrated in Fig. 5.8, loss of storage by sedimentation will result in a decline
in reliability if the normal withdrawal rate is sustained, or a reduction in ﬁrm yield if the
withdrawal rate is reduced to sustain a given level of reliability. Reliability will also decline as
climate variability increases, which adversely affects the ability of a given reservoir storage
volume to either provide a sustained water supply yield or to provide the design level of ﬂood
control. Increased climatic variability will produce a new lower curve in Fig. 5.8, with
diminished beneﬁts at all storage volumes.
The impact of storage loss on reservoir function will vary widely from one site to another.
High hydropower dams constructed primarily to produce hydraulic head may see little
impairment until much of the storage volume has been lost, whereas at other sites functional

tation has much less impact on ﬁrm yield than an equivalent volume loss when the reservoir capacity is
diminished. Volume loss by sedimentation results in either a reduction in reliability, ﬁrm yield, or some
combination of the two, depending on reservoir operation.
Sediment Management and Sustainable Use of Reservoirs

impairment will occur much earlier. For instance, data reported by the US Army Corps of
Engineers in 2010 revealed that in dams reporting operational impairment up to 10 % of the
time due to sedimentation, 80 % of these had experienced less than a 25 % capacity loss
[23]. In reservoirs with multiple uses, such as water supply, hydropower, and ﬂood control,
each use will be affected to a different degree by sedimentation. For example, because the
ﬂood control volume necessarily occupies the top portion of the reservoir pool which is
normally empty, it will typically experience a low sedimentation rate, while more sediments
will be deposited into the conservation pool. Pool reallocation will need to be performed at
regular intervals if the impact of volume loss is to be apportioned equally among the different
beneﬁcial pools.
4.5. Sedimentation Impacts Above Pool Elevation
Delta deposits will cause ﬂood levels to rise above the backwater proﬁle computed in the
absence of sedimentation, and sediment deposits can extend well upstream of the reservoir’s
normal pool level. This can produce upstream ﬂooding and waterlogging of adjacent agricul-
tural soils, bury upstream intakes and stream diversions beneath sediment, increase tailwater
elevation at upstream hydropower plants, reduce freeboard beneath bridges affecting both
ﬂood hazard and navigational clearance, and promote avulsion of the upstream channel.
Sedimentation of the main channel will also affect tributaries. In the case of Niobrara,
Nebraska, for example, aggradation of the delta created by the sand-laden Niobrara River
where it discharges into Lewis & Clark reservoir on the Missouri River increased ﬂood levels
to the extent that it became necessary to relocate the entire town to higher ground [24]. Rec-
reational facilities and marinas in areas affected by delta deposition may become seriously
affected very early in the sedimentation process.
4.6. Sedimentation Impacts Below the Dam
The river channel below the dam is impacted by elimination of the coarse suspended
and bed material sediment supply due to trapping in the reservoir, and also by the diminished
ﬂood peaks which reduces sediment transport capacity below the dam. These factors tend to
counteract one another. The ﬁrst factor usually predominates, resulting in downstream
channel incision and armoring. However, when a large reservoir greatly diminishes down-
stream transport capacity, and tributaries below the dam supply a heavy sediment load, the
downstream channel can aggrade, as occurs along the Rı´o Grande downstream of Elephant
Butte reservoir in New Mexico [25]. The remainder of this section describes the more
common situation, channel degradation.
Reservoirs trap virtually all coarse sediment, cutting off the supply of new bed material to
the channel below the dam. Because discharges from the dam will continue to transport bed
material downstream, and because smaller grains are transported at a higher rate than the
larger material, the channel bed below the dam will progressively coarsen, incise, and may
become armored. Armoring can reduce or eliminate habitat. Channel incision will accelerate
bank failure and streambank erosion, and downcutting of the main channel can trigger
292
G.L. Morris

incision of its tributaries due to the lowered base level. Hydropower peaking operations which
produce large ﬂuctuations in streamﬂow can further destabilize channel banks. These impacts
are lessened by the reduction in peak discharges caused by ﬂood detention in the impound-
ment, which occurs even in reservoirs not designed for ﬂood control. Downstream impacts
can extend from the dam to the sea and can affect coastal erosion. For example, a study in
California [26] estimated 10 Mm3/year of sand reached the coast prior to dam building, but
dams on coastal rivers have reduced this by 23 %. The impacts are greatest in southern
California where 50 % of the sand ﬂux is now trapped by dams.
4.7. Sedimentation Impact Thresholds
Sedimentation impacts do not occur in a linear manner. Impacts to intakes, navigation, and
recreational uses will typically have critical thresholds. While reservoir storage–yield rela-
tionships do not have speciﬁc thresholds, they are characterized by a nonlinear relationship as
illustrated in Fig. 5.8. As reservoir capacity declines, the ﬁrm yield (or reliability at a ﬁxed
yield) also declines, but in a nonlinear manner, and the yield reduction per unit of storage loss
(the yield elasticity) will increase as storage volume declines. When sedimentation is focused
in the bottom of the reservoir, without reducing surface area, the surface-to-volume ratio will
change thereby increasing the relative importance of evaporative losses, and in dry climates
this can further increase the impact of sedimentation on yield loss [27]. While exact threshold
values may be difﬁcult to deﬁne, it is important to realize that thresholds do exist and to
incorporate them into decision-making related to sediment management.
5. PREDICTING FUTURE CONDITIONS
Beneﬁcial uses of reservoirs become increasingly constrained as sedimentation progresses,
making it prudent to determine the time frame over which different beneﬁcial uses may be
impacted or when signiﬁcant impact thresholds may be encountered. Sedimentation rates and
future reservoir capacity may be predicted for individual reservoirs or at the regional or
national level based on aggregate data.
5.1. Reservoir Surveys to Measure Sedimentation
Successive bathymetric reservoir surveys provide information on the historical rate and
pattern of sediment accumulation at a reservoir, information needed to answer questions
concerning the timing, characteristics, and magnitude of sedimentation impacts. Data from
reservoir surveys are used to update the storage–elevation and storage–area relationships.
Changes in the storage–elevation relationship over time will indicate the extent to which
sedimentation affects different storage-dependent uses. These surveys also provide the data
required to calibrate models to predict future sedimentation patterns and analyze management
alternatives. Data on the volume of sediment trapped can also be used to estimate watershed
sediment yield following correction for sediment bulk density and reservoir trap efﬁciency.
Examples of bathymetric surveys and procedural guidelines can be downloaded from the US
Sediment Management and Sustainable Use of Reservoirs
293

Bureau of Reclamation website (http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/sediment/) and in Chap. 9 of the
bureau’s Erosion and Sedimentation Manual [28].
The interval between reservoir surveys should be established to track the rate and pattern of
deposition, and at sites where the annual rate of storage loss is low the survey interval will be
longer than at a reservoir with a high sedimentation rate or where deposition creates a
signiﬁcant problem. A survey interval corresponding to each 5–10 % increment in volume
loss may be adequate, but more frequent surveys may be appropriate at critical sites and in
smaller reservoirs following an extreme ﬂood that transports a large sediment volume.
Volume surveys are subject to errors, especially when measurement techniques change.
The pre-impoundment reservoir volume may have been computed from topographic mapping
or by a photogrammetric survey biased by errors in estimating vegetation height. Cross-
sectional surveys made during impounding may estimate volume from a very limited geo-
metric dataset. Survey errors become evident when a detailed post-impoundment survey
volume is larger than the initial volume, despite decades of impounding. Errors in the other
direction can also occur but their detection is not so obvious. To minimize these problems, a
detailed bathymetric survey should be performed soon after initial impounding to establish a
baseline volume to be compared against future surveys.
Reservoir capacity surveys are best performed with the reservoir full using sonar connected
to a GPS, mounted in a boat which then conducts multiple traverses to obtain the data density
required to construct a contour map and compute capacity. If the reservoir is drawn down, part
of the area may be traversed by vehicle or on foot or mapped by aerial methods such as
LIDAR. In delta areas sediment can be deposited above the pool elevation, and it is important
to survey the upstream delta growth to complement data from within the reservoir pool.
Large datasets can now be processed easily by computer, and the cost of the reservoir
survey is primarily determined by the ﬁeld data collection effort. Boat speed during bathy-
metric survey is normally limited to less than about 8 km/h, as higher velocities can induce
cavitation on the sonar transducer and also increase the spacing of data points. At this speed,
signiﬁcant ﬁeld effort will be required for complete mapping at large reservoirs, even when
multi-beam sonar is used. Because sediment tends to accumulate in two areas, in the delta or
along the submerged thalweg, once the depositional patterns are documented, the reconnais-
sance technique described by the US Bureau of Reclamation [15] can be used to remap large
reservoirs, limiting data collection to those areas where most sediment accumulates. This
technique requires prior survey data of the entire reservoir to conﬁrm sediment deposition
patterns and to plan the survey navigational tracks.
The range line method was used in older reservoir surveys, prior to the availability of
automated GPS survey techniques. It continues to be used today in larger reservoirs when the
budget does not allow the density of ﬁeld data required for a contour survey or as a cost-
effective method to monitor sedimentation rates at selected ranges. The range line method
involves measurement of a series of representative cross sections and computing the volume
change between adjacent range lines by formulas based on cross-sectional areas and surface
area. Range line techniques are described by Strand and Pemberton [17] and by Morris and
Fan [29]. As a word of caution, different survey methodologies and computational algorithms
294
G.L. Morris

(pre-impounding vs. post-impounding, range line vs. contour) will produce different results.
For example, a study of comparative measurement techniques at the Kremasta reservoir in
Greece [30] found that at this site the range line method underestimated the volume of
deposited sediment by 18–32 % as compared to a digital terrain model, depending on the
number of range lines used. Different algorithms used to compute range line data also affect
accuracy, and methods such as the surface area – average end area method [29] are expected
to be more accurate than the end area method. When changing computational algorithms,
or from range line to contour methods, computations from the same dataset should be made
by both methods to document the volume change attributed to changed methodology. Small
errors in volume estimate can produce very large errors in the estimated rate of volume loss by
sedimentation.
5.2. Future Sedimentation Rate and Pattern
Future reservoir volume can be estimated by extrapolating the trend of volume depletion
documented by successive reservoir surveys and incorporating any corrections as appropriate
for the future compaction of ﬁne sediment and change in trap efﬁciency as volume declines.
However, the rate of sediment delivery to the reservoir is often not constant over time, being
inﬂuenced by factors such as upstream dam construction plus changes in land use and climate.
For proposed reservoirs, or existing reservoirs without survey data, future sedimentation rate
must be predicted from secondary data. The rate of volume loss can be estimated from three
parameters: sediment yield, sediment-trapping efﬁciency, and dry bulk density of the trapped
sediment. These are each brieﬂy described in subsequent sections.
Information on the future sediment deposition pattern will indicate the timing and severity
of impacts to beneﬁcial uses and reservoir infrastructure such as intakes. Prediction of
depositional patterns is best performed by sediment transport modeling using tools such as
the Bureau of Reclamation’s SRH-1D model, the sediment transport component of the
HEC-RAS model available from the US Army Corps of Engineers, or others. A sediment
transport model requires, as a minimum, the following: initial pool geometry, a long-term
inﬂow hydrograph, inﬂow sediment rating curve, sediment grain size distribution (hydraulic
size of ﬁnes determined by sedimentation velocity), and the reservoir operating rule. When
determining the grain size distribution of sediment containing clays, it is important to
determine the sedimentation velocity using native water and without the aid of a deﬂocculant.
Use of standard geotechnical laboratory techniques (deﬂocculant and distilled water) will
determine the clay fraction of the sample, but not the true sedimentation velocity, since clays
frequently experience ﬂocculation in natural waters and may settle at velocities characteristic
of silts. However, differentiation between silt and clay must be known for the purpose of
evaluating cohesion in the sediment deposits and the potential for sediment compaction.
The empirical area-reduction method estimates the sedimentation pattern by predicting the
future form of the elevation-volume curve. It is an approximate method to estimate the
distribution of sediment within a reservoir based on the allocation of inﬂowing sediment at
different depth increments within the reservoir [17]. It does not take into account the grain
size distribution of the inﬂowing sediment and should not be used as the basis for design of a

new reservoir. It is best used at existing reservoirs to project future conditions once the
sediment distribution pattern has already been documented by bathymetric studies and when
resources do not allow the use of modeling techniques.
5.3. Sediment Yield
Sediment yield is the mass of sediment delivered to a particular point in the stream network
over a stated period of time and is always less than total erosion. Because there are relatively
few long-term suspended sediment gaging stations, the long-term mean daily suspended
sediment concentration or load is typically computed by a sediment rating equation which
correlates either concentration or load to discharge. This empirical rating equation is derived
from operation of a suspended sediment gage station for several years of representative ﬂows.
Given the importance of the rating equations in computing variations in suspended sediment
discharge over time, and given the many potential sources of error, several concepts relating
to collection and analysis of suspended sediment data are presented in this section.
Erosion refers to the process of soil detachment and initiation of particle motion. Erosion
rates are measured on small plots, and these data are used to calibrate erosion models such as
the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Water Erosion Prediction Project
(WEPP) model. These models are then used to estimate erosion rates on larger land areas
ranging from individual farms to entire catchments based on factors including soil type, soil
slope, slope length, rainfall intensity, and type of soil cover or management treatment. The
sediment delivery ratio expresses the ratio of sediment yield to erosion. Sediment yield is
typically an order of magnitude less than the erosion rate because most soil particles are
redeposited close to the point of dislodgement, at the base of the slope, in an aggrading
channel, or on a ﬂoodplain, before exiting the catchment [31]. In practice, sediment yield is
measured by gaging stations or reservoir surveys, but the erosion rate is estimated by
modeling, and the sediment delivery ratio compares the modeled erosion rate to measured
sediment yield. Erosion, sediment yield, and the sediment delivery ratio all vary greatly from
one runoff event to another, and long-term average values obscure the wide variability that
exits among the individual events. Floods are of primary interest in sedimentation manage-
ment as they are responsible for much of the sediment delivery to reservoirs. Erosion models
can be used to determine the erosion potential of different soil and land use combinations,
thereby identifying areas to focus erosion control practices to yield the greatest beneﬁt.
However, lacking reliable methods to determine the sediment delivery ratio, erosion rates
are of limited utility in estimating sediment yield [32, 33].
Sediment yield may be expressed in units of T/year, and the speciﬁc sediment yield per unit
area may be expressed as T/km2/year. Long-term sediment yield within a region may be best
quantiﬁed by bathymetric surveys of reservoirs to document the cumulative sediment volume
captured, following adjustment to account for trap efﬁciency and sediment bulk density.
Reservoir data are particularly useful because reservoirs capture sediment from all events
following dam closure, including extreme events which may be inadequately sampled or
absent from gage station records.
296
G.L. Morris

To document timewise variations in sediment yield requires suspended sediment gaging
and employing transport equations or empirical methods to correct for the unsampled bed
load. It is important to insure the dataset includes adequate sampling of large events which are
responsible for a disproportionate amount of sediment yield, since datasets lacking such
events can seriously underreport yield. The potential for error is particularly large in moun-
tainous watersheds and smaller watersheds where sediment delivery is dominated by large
events of short duration and extreme events (e.g., hurricanes) may be difﬁcult or impossible to
sample accurately.
Sediment yield data are usually sparse, particularly in less developed areas, making it
necessary to estimate yield by other techniques. In areas of low rainfall or Mediterranean-type
climates, the PSIAC and similar methods which evaluate the factors responsible for the
generation and delivery of sediment at the watershed scale (Table 5.2) have been found to
give good indicators of sediment yield when evaluated across an entire watershed within a
GIS framework. Application of this approach has been reported by several authors [34–38].
In analyzing sediment yield data it may be useful to prepare a plot of yield vs. drainage area
from multiple sources within the same physiographic environment to help provide a range of
reasonable sediment yield values (Fig. 5.9). Yield estimates which fall signiﬁcantly outside of
other regional values should be closely evaluated. Although it has been generally accepted
that speciﬁc yield declines as watershed area increases [17], this is not always true. In plotting
sediment yield data it should not be automatically assumed that speciﬁc yield will decrease as
watershed area increases, as in some regions there is no clear relationship between these two
parameters [38].
5.4. Climate Change and Sediment Yield
Long-term changes in sediment yield can occur due to construction of upstream dams;
modiﬁcation in soil cover resulting from land use changes; exhaustion of the supply of
available sediment by soil denudation; climate change which can modify temperature,

precipitation, and evaporation and promote glacial retreat; and changes in erosional power
from modiﬁcation in rainfall intensity and runoff volume. The overall effects of climate
change on sediment yield are complex, and it may be difﬁcult to separate out climate effect
from other factors. For example, increasing aridity of itself will reduce vegetative cover
and make the soil more susceptible to erosion, but the reduced precipitation reduces runoff
and thus sediment transport capacity, other factors remaining equal. However, a decrease in
vegetative cover due to increased temperatures, coupled with increased rainstorm intensity,
also related to climate warming, may signiﬁcantly increase sediment yield. Walling [40]
provides an overview of current knowledge on climate change and its potential impact on
erosion and sediment transport by rivers. Evidence from around the world indicates that the
principal factors affecting sediment yield have been land clearing, which increases sedi-
ment yield, and dam construction and ﬂow abstraction which decreases yield, all modiﬁed
by the impact of instream mining. Walling concluded that, “In most rivers, it is likely to
prove difﬁcult to disentangle the impacts of climate change or variability from changes
resulting from other human impacts and existing evidence suggests that, in most cases,
these human impacts are at present most likely to be more signiﬁcant.”
Erosion rates can change as a consequence of both climate and management techniques.
For example, studies of the Midwestern USA indicate that a combination of increased
precipitation coupled with a bias toward more intense storms, anticipated climatic trends
already being observed, will increase both runoff volume and soil erosion [41]. About half of
the increased precipitation is associated with the most intense 10 % of storms, causing both

rainfall erosivity and erosion rate to increase more rapidly than total precipitation [42].
However, farmers are expected to respond to climate modiﬁcation by changing cropping
patterns and management techniques, which will itself effect erosion rates. Modeling studies
for 11 regions within ﬁve Midwestern states of the USA by O’Neal and coworkers [43] took
these factors into consideration and concluded that soil loss might increase by a factor ranging
from 33 % to 274 % in ten of the regions and would decrease slightly in the eleventh.
However, as pointed out by Walling [40], a relatively small percentage of the erosion may
actually ﬁnd its way into downstream reservoirs due to redeposition near the point of erosion,
at the base of slopes, in upstream impoundments, in channels and wetlands, or on ﬂoodplains.
Although it will be difﬁcult to quantify future changes in sediment yield associated with
climate change, the combination of climate change plus land use impacts from continued
population increase is expected to sustain or increase sediment yields over time, especially in
regions undergoing development and deforestation. Finally, it is worth noting that climate
models generally agree that the climate will become more variable, with more intense ﬂoods
and droughts. Reservoir storage exists to smooth out this hydrologic variability. An increase
in hydrologic variability produces an impact on reservoir yield or ﬂood protection similar to
reducing storage volume and will further reduce reservoir beneﬁts beyond that due to
sedimentation alone.
5.5. Reservoir Trap Efﬁciency
Trap efﬁciency refers to the percentage of the inﬂowing sediment load retained within a
reservoir. Trap efﬁciency varies greatly from one event to another. All sediment from a small
inﬂow event may be captured, while a large inﬂow event producing a short hydraulic
residence time in the reservoir may transport much of the ﬁner sediment through the
impoundment and beyond the dam with a low trap efﬁciency. The average long-term trap
efﬁciency may be estimated from a reservoir’s hydrologic size, expressed as ratio of total
reservoir capacity to mean annual inﬂow (the capacity:inﬂow or C:I ratio), based on the
empirical Brune relationship shown in Fig. 5.10 [44]. The three curves represent an envelope
of conditions ranging from reservoirs having a lower average trap efﬁciency (reservoir
emptied annually, slowly settling sediment) to reservoirs having a higher average trap
efﬁciency (continuously impounding, coarser sediment inﬂow). A signiﬁcant decline in trap
efﬁciency does not occur until a reservoir’s C:I ratio becomes quite small. The following
equation can be used to plot the Brune curve for the case of “normal ponded reservoirs” [45]:
Te ¼ R
ð Þ= 0:012 þ 1:02  R
ð
Þ
ð5:2Þ
where Te ¼ trap efﬁciency and R ¼ capacity:inﬂow ratio. Brune’s curves should be used only
for normally ponded reservoirs, not for ﬂoodwater-retarding structures, debris basins, semidry
reservoirs, or reservoirs where sediment-release techniques are employed. Heinemann [46]
modiﬁed Brune’s relationship for smaller agricultural impoundments, using data for 20 nor-
mally ponded surface discharge reservoirs with catchment areas ranging from 0.8 to 36.3 km2

299

and volumes from 0.031 to 4.1 Mm3. The Heinemann curve can be expressed by the following
equation:
Te ¼ 22 þ 119:6 R
ð Þ= 0:012 þ 1:02  R
ð Þ
ð
Þ
ð5:3Þ
For this size range, his curve predicted a lower trap efﬁciency than the Brune relationship.
The Brune curve is widely used due to its limited data requirements. However, the best tool
for examining sedimentation history and predicting future sedimentation behavior is by
mathematical modeling. A properly validated model can simulate the contribution of each
discharge event to the sedimentation process, as well as the sediment management beneﬁts of
alternative operational measures such as routing of sediment-laden ﬂoods through the
reservoir.
5.6. Sediment Bulk Density
Dry weight per unit of submerged sediment volume may be termed either speciﬁc weight
or dry bulk density (g/cm3, T/m3). To determine sediment yield from reservoir surveys it is
necessary to convert sediment volume to sediment mass. This can be determined by
analysis of sediment cores, being careful not to compact soft sediment during the sampling.
Because sediment composition varies from one point to another in a reservoir, sampling
should be spaced so each core represents a known fraction of the total deposit volume, to
enable the volume-weighted dry bulk density to be computed. The volume-to-mass con-
version can also be estimated by empirical methods. Lara and Pemberton [47] presented a
method to compute initial bulk density, and the Lane and Koelzer [48] method adjusts for
compaction of ﬁne sediment over time. These methods are described in Morris and Fan [29]
and Strand and Pemberton [17]. Representative values of bulk density are summarized in
Table 5.3.

5.7. Preliminary Sedimentation Assessment for a Single Reservoir
A preliminary assessment of sedimentation rate and potential future impacts can be
undertaken by following the approach outlined below. This approach will help identify the
types and timing of possible impacts, help determine when sedimentation will become
problematic, and identify the appropriate data collection and management strategies.
1.
Compile available bathymetric data, plot reservoir storage volume over time, and estimate annual
rate of storage loss. Several surveys are required to reliably deﬁne the overall pattern of storage
loss. Comparison of the reported pre-impoundment volume against a single bathymetric survey
data point is not a reliable measure of sedimentation rate due to errors inherent in the use of two
measurement methodologies.
2.
Predict future rate of storage loss considering any variation in trap efﬁciency due to loss in
reservoir volume or any upstream reservoir construction which may affect sediment yield.
3.
Plot longitudinal thalweg proﬁles and superimpose the location of intakes or other critical
structures. Also plot representative cross sections giving particular attention to locations near
potentially affected infrastructure or properties.
4.
A preliminary estimate of the shift in the stage-storage curve can be made by the empirical area-
reduction method based on data from prior sedimentation surveys. Sediment transport modeling is
recommended to achieve more reliable results.
5.
Determine the extent to which beneﬁcial users may be affected in the future. In a storage reservoir,
for example, this would entail projecting future loss in ﬁrm yield based on storage–yield relation-
ship or by simulation modeling of supply reliability or power production under scenarios of
declining volume.
These data should provide the type of information needed to determine the nature and
timetable of beneﬁcial uses to be affected by sedimentation and form the basis for identifying
and scheduling the next actions to be taken. Next actions may range from a continuation of
reservoir surveys in the future to the execution of more detailed sustainability analysis to
better deﬁne and address any sedimentation issues revealed by the preliminary assessment

5.8. Regional Analysis
A national, regional, or institution-wide analysis of sedimentation at multiple reservoirs
can help determine the extent of existing problems and identify priority sites for sediment
management. However, regional analysis is often constrained by sparse sedimentation data,
and the available data may be geographically scattered and in inconsistent reporting formats.
Two strategies may be used to assess and prioritize regional sedimentation issues: data-call
and regional sediment balance model.
Data-call. The data-call method consists of querying each dam operator for information on
sedimentation data and to identify existing or anticipated sediment-related problems. This
approach was used by the US Army Corps of Engineers [23] to compile sedimentation
information on the 609 dams under corps jurisdiction nationwide. It revealed that less than
5 % of their reservoirs had lost more than 25 % of their capacity by sedimentation. Never-
theless, a signiﬁcant percentage of the sites reported one or more authorized purposes were
experiencing “moderate” restrictions due to sedimentation, deﬁned as “sedimentation limits a
speciﬁc purpose up to 10 % of the time” (see Table 5.4). Not all reservoirs are authorized for
all types of use, and some reservoirs report impacts in multiple authorized uses. Data collected
will feed into a larger national database hosted by the USGS which contains data on over
6,000 sites [50].
Data-call results may be biased by differences in data availability and by differing
interpretations and levels of interest by the respondents. The data-call approach can also
include questions about problems which may exist below the dam resulting from cutoff of
the sediment supply, although these may be of less concern to dam operators. A serious
deﬁciency in the data-call approach is the nonuniformity of response quality.
Regional reservoir sediment balances. Many watersheds have multiple dams, and sediment
accumulation is affected both by sediment trapping in upstream dams plus the change in trap
efﬁciency over time as each impoundment loses storage. To obtain an accurate regional

picture of long-term sedimentation impacts and trends requires evaluation of these parameters
for all reservoirs within the studied watersheds. For example, California’s state database lists
57 dams above Folsom Dam on the American River, and to predict future sedimentation at
Folsom requires that all of these upstream sites be considered.
A spreadsheet model for prediction of sedimentation rates at all reservoirs within a region
considering these factors was described by Minear and Kondolf [51], who analyzed 1,382
reservoirs in California. This methodology requires the following: (1) estimates of speciﬁc
sediment yield by physiographic region; (2) location of each reservoir and its watershed limits
overlain on the physiographic regions to estimate sediment load from the unregulated
watershed above each dam; (3) hierarchy of reservoirs within each watershed and construc-
tion dates and volume for each site to account for changes in sediment trapping over time; and
(4) a procedure to estimate sediment-trapping efﬁciency at each reservoir, since trap efﬁ-
ciency declines as reservoir capacity diminishes. A GIS database which locates each dam on a
digital elevation map with an overlay for physiographic regions was used to facilitate
computation of watershed areas and sediment loads. Brown’s equation was used to estimate
trap efﬁciency based on watershed area:
Ta,t ¼ 1  1= 1 þ 0:00021  Ka,t1=A
½

ð5:4Þ
where Ta,t ¼ decimal trap efﬁciency of reservoir a at time step t, A ¼ watershed area, and
Ka,t1 is capacity or reservoir a at time step t  1. The Brune relationship based on the
capacity:inﬂow ratio could not be used because data on mean annual inﬂow were not available
at about 80 % of the sites. The results of this analysis (Table 5.5) showed the critical
importance of accounting for both trap efﬁciency and upstream dams when assessing long-
term sedimentation impacts.
6. CLASSIFICATION OF SEDIMENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
Strategies for sediment management in reservoirs may be broadly classiﬁed as follows:
(1) methods to reduce sediment inﬂow from upstream, (2) methods to pass sediment through
or around the impoundment to minimize sediment trapping, and (3) methods to recover,
increase, or reallocate storage or to modify intakes or other structures, after sediment has been
deposited. Speciﬁc techniques available under each strategy are shown in Fig. 5.11 and

Table 5.6. These can be used as a preliminary checklist to conﬁrm that the gamut of control
strategies has been considered. Some authors have classiﬁed management techniques based
on management location rather than process [52, 53]. A combination of management strate-
gies will typically be employed, and the techniques suitable for implementation will change
over time. For example, the venting of turbidity currents may be the only feasible technique to
pass sediment through a hydrologically large reservoir, but this method may no longer work
and other routing approaches become feasible when reservoir volume has been diminished by
sedimentation. A long-term sediment management strategy may consist of a sequence of
different techniques to be applied sequentially as volume diminishes.
7. REDUCE SEDIMENT INFLOW FROM UPSTREAM
All watersheds export sediment, but the natural sediment yield can be greatly accelerated
by land use changes which remove vegetative cover, destroy soil structure, concentrate the
hydraulic energy of ﬂowing water, initiate stream incision, and accelerate streambank ero-
sion. For example, isotope analysis of sediment deposits in a Mississippi oxbow lake
documented a 50-fold increase in sediment yield initiated by land clearing in the late
nineteenth century and sustained to the present day [54]. In developing areas, land use
often changes after dam construction as extension of the road network enables farmers to

move into previously unpopulated areas above the dam, producing rates of erosion and
sediment yield much higher than originally anticipated. Two broad strategies can be used to
reduce the sediment load reaching a reservoir: reduce the erosion rate from the land surface or
stream channels, or provide upstream storage to trap eroded sediment.
7.1. Reduce Sediment Production
Soils are held in place primarily by vegetation and the associated soil ecosystem, and the
principal objective in the control of soil erosion is to maximize vegetation coverage. Vege-
tation and leaf litter physically protect soil from the direct impact of raindrops which can
dislodge particles from the soil matrix. Organic materials produced by fungi and bacteria in
the soil ecosystem act as a binding agent that causes ﬁne particles to agglomerate, thereby
resisting dislodgement and retaining soil structure which enhances inﬁltration. Roots, worms,

and burrowing insects all loosen the soil, enhancing inﬁltration and reducing erosive overland
ﬂow. Vegetation, soil litter such as leaves and twigs, and minor soil surface irregularities all
retard the velocity of surface ﬂow, reducing erosive energy and trapping sediment eroded
from upslope. Interventions which disrupt or destroy these natural processes at and beneath
the soil surface can accelerate soil erosion rates by two orders of magnitude, as illustrated by
the data in Table 5.7 from a 22 km2 moist mountainous tropical watershed. Modeling showed
that conversion of 5 % of the most-erosive land use to forest would produce a 20 % reduction
in erosion rate. The average sediment delivery ratio in this watershed was computed as
17 % [55].
Soil erosion control is typically recommended to control reservoir sedimentation. Erosion
control success depends on identifying the areas of accelerated soil loss, implementing
effective erosion control measures, and then sustaining these controls or land use changes
indeﬁnitely. Nevertheless, some areas have experienced sustained high rates of sediment yield
despite substantial reductions in soil erosion. In practice, a signiﬁcant reduction in sediment
yield may not be seen in a river system for years or decades following erosion control
treatment because much eroded sediment will become trapped at the base of slopes as
colluvial ﬁll or may accumulate in channel bars or on ﬂoodplains, creating a large reservoir
of sediment to be transported downstream for many years after soil erosion is reduced at the
source [56, 57]. This should not be interpreted to minimize the long-term beneﬁts of erosion
control, which also include enhanced soil fertility and moisture retention, environmental
recovery, and other beneﬁts which exist independent of reservoirs. Rather, it is to point out
that while erosion control is an excellent long-term strategy, it will not necessarily produce an
immediate and measurable reduction in sediment yield.
Erosion modeling in a GIS environment can be used to determine erosion rates for the
purpose of focusing erosion control efforts and to better understand the possible sources of
sediment entering a reservoir. For example, the European Environment Agency applied the
Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to the entire Alpine area, including parts of

6 different countries, to estimate soil erosion rates on a 100 m grid, mapping soil erosion rates
in eight classes from <50 to >5,000 T/km2/year [58]. Modeling can also be used to estimate
the beneﬁts of management measures.
In agricultural areas, erosion control strategies can include minimizing soil disturbance
(no-till), maximizing soil cover by vegetation and mulch, sediment trapping by vegetated
buffer strips, management of runoff water with grassed waterways, and construction of farm
ponds. In general, maximize vegetation and mulch coverage while keeping runoff ﬂows as
dispersed as possible, thereby maximizing the potential for inﬁltration and reducing the
erosive energy of concentrated ﬂows. Vegetated swales and hardened structures can be
used to carry concentrated ﬂows across slopes without gullying. In promoting the implemen-
tation of erosion control measures by farmers, it is essential that they see on-farm beneﬁts
from soil conservation activities; otherwise, these activities will not be self-sustaining.
On-farm beneﬁts may include enhanced inﬁltration and retention of water leading to higher
yield and income, reduced fertilizer inputs, etc. Effective erosion control typically requires
effective and sustained intervention with hundreds to thousands of landowners and users, an
undertaking not likely to be successful absent a strong organizational presence. For example,
in the USA, the Natural Resource Conservation Service and local soil and water conservation
districts provide both technical services and directed incentives to land users. There is an
abundance of literature and technical guidance concerning soil erosion and its mitigation on
agricultural soils available from the US Natural Resources Conservation Service website
(http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/), the Soil and Water Conservation Society (http://www.swcs.org),
and many other organizations.
In forested areas a dense network of roads and skid trails may be constructed for logging.
Erosion and slope failures associated with the construction and use of unpaved roads are
typically the most important long-term contributors of sediment from logged areas. After
logging ends these roads may fall into disrepair while simultaneously experiencing increased
trafﬁc for which they were not originally constructed. For example, the US Forest Service has
more kilometers of roads than the US Interstate Highway System and has seen use of its forest
roads increase 18-fold over 50 years, and timber harvest now accounts for only 0.5 % of forest
road use [59]. Whereas sediment yield from the forest ﬂoor can quickly diminish after logging,
road erosion will remain as a long-term source of sediment which can potentially increase over
time, especially if hydraulic structures fall into disrepair. The US Forest Service’s Treesearch
online library (http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/) has an extensive research library relating to
sediment yield and erosion control, and numerous region-speciﬁc best management practice
(BMP) guidelines for timber harvesting, logging roads, and related topics are available on the
Internet from local extension services and national forestry services.
Urban development will dramatically increase onsite erosion and sediment yield as vege-
tation is removed and earth movement destroys soil structure and exposes destabilized soils to
erosive energy. However, sediment yield declines dramatically after construction is com-
pleted, as soils become vegetated or covered with impervious surfaces, and drainage is routed
through hard structures. For example, Warrick and Rubin [60] analyzed 34 years of data from
the semiarid Santa Ana River watershed in California and found that conversion to urban land
use produced a 20-fold reduction in suspended sediment concentration with respect to
Sediment Management and Sustainable Use of Reservoirs

discharge and a sixfold increase in discharge. However, when the increased peak discharge
reaches a downstream natural channel, the increased erosive energy will accelerate channel
incision and bank erosion. Thus, urbanization moves the problem of accelerated erosion into
the channels downstream of the impervious areas. Urban erosion control typically focuses on
implementing best management practices (BMPs) for erosion control on construction sites
through combined local and federal regulatory frameworks.
Urban stormwater detention basins have been used to compensate for the increase in peak
discharge due to impervious surfaces, but these structures have traditionally focused on
treating only the larger and more infrequent “design storms,” while the smaller and frequent
events responsible for the great majority of runoff pass through the basins with little attenu-
ation. The current emphasis in the management of post-construction runoff from urban areas is
to mimic, insofar as possible, pre-construction hydrologic behavior. This strategy of Low
Impact Development (LID) focuses on maximizing opportunities for evaporating, detaining,
and inﬁltrating water, trapping sediment and other contaminants as far upstream as possible
within the catchment and before entering drainage structures with concentrated high-velocity
ﬂow. This is reminiscent of the 1930s motto of the Civilian Conservation Corps: “Stop the
water where it falls.” Online documentation and links are available from the Low Impact
Development Center (http://www.lowimpactdevelopment.org).
Alluvial stream channels naturally meander across their ﬂoodplain, eroding the exterior of
channel bends while simultaneously depositing sediment on point bars located opposite the
eroding banks. However, natural streambank erosion rates may be greatly accelerated as a
result of human intervention and become an important contributor to increased sediment
yield. Causes of accelerated channel erosion include increased peak runoff due to upstream
deforestation, overgrazing, and urbanization; removal of streambank vegetation; channel
straightening which increases channel slope and erosion rate; and channel incision induced
by activities such as upstream dam construction or removal of channel sediment by instream
aggregate mining. In built-up environments, even natural stream meandering is usually the
object of control since any lateral movement will quickly threaten property and infrastructure.
Traditional approaches for the treatment of bank erosion have focused on the extensive use of
rip rap. A more environmentally sustainable and potentially less costly channel management
approach focuses on developing an understanding of the geomorphically stable stream form,
and to establish this form along the stream channel, rather than using patch-in-place channel
bank hardening which can itself contribute to further stream destabilization [61]. More
comprehensive information is given in the Stream Restoration Design Handbook compiled
by the US Natural Resources Conservation Service which incorporates inputs from multiple
federal agencies and the private sector and is available on the Internet [62].
In summary, several factors are critical to successfully reduce sediment yield from an
impacted watershed.
l
High erosion areas. Identify priority areas or priority land uses to be treated. Determine the types of
soils and corresponding land use practices which create high rates of erosion over sufﬁcient land
surface to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence sediment yield and which can be expected to be amenable to
308

treatment. In unstable streams, identify treatment strategies which lead to long-term channel
stability.
l
High sediment delivery ratio. Focus treatments on areas which have the highest potential to deliver
sediment to the reservoir. While it is difﬁcult to assess the sediment delivery ratio, the following
factors will tend to increase the delivery ratio from a catchment: close proximity to the reservoir,
high soil and channel slopes, small alluvial ﬂoodplains or wetlands to trap sediment, mostly ﬁne
sediment, few farm ponds or other impoundments, high drainage density, and gullying.
l
Sustained community participation. Identify erosion control practices suitable to the local technical,
economic, and institutional environment, and which can be expected to be sustained because they
generate visible beneﬁts to the local community. Identify and partner with local grassroots
organizations or institutions having presence and credibility within the watershed. Reduction of
erosion and sediment production within a watershed can generate substantial and sustained beneﬁts
to many members of the community including farmers who retain their soil, recreational users who
have cleaner water, and environmentalists.
Although land use changes are not easy to achieve, the beneﬁts can be both broad based and
long lasting. The realization of tangible beneﬁt by the local community is essential for both
initiating and sustaining changed land use practices.
7.2. Sediment Trapping Above the Reservoir
Sediment inﬂow into a reservoir can be reduced by the construction of upstream sediment-
trapping storage facilities. It is relatively rare to construct an upstream reservoir for the sole
purpose of trapping sediment, other than the construction of debris basins designed to trap
coarse sediment that would otherwise collect in and impair the operation of a downstream
ﬂood channel. However, upstream impoundments of all sizes can act as efﬁcient sediment-
trapping structures, and the presence of upstream dams is one of the most important factors
modifying sediment loads downstream. In considering the effect of upstream dams, not only
are large dams important, but numerous small structures, including those as small as stock
watering ponds, can also act as efﬁcient sediment taps. For example, in the conterminous
USA, Renwick et al. [63] estimated that there are at least 2.6 million, and possibly as many as
8 or 9 million, small impoundments capturing runoff from about 21 % of the total drainage
area in the lower 48 states. Total sediment capture in these ponds was estimated to equal
between 25 % and 100 % of the total sedimentation in the 43,000 reservoirs listed in the U. S.
National Inventory of Dams.
8. ROUTE SEDIMENTS
Sediment discharge is highly concentrated in time, and sediment routing refers to a family
of techniques that take advantage of this timewise variation in sediment discharge, managing
ﬂows during periods of highest sediment yield to minimize sediment trapping in the reservoir.
These strategies include the following: (1) selectively diverting clear water to an offstream
impoundment and excluding sediment-laden ﬂood ﬂows, (2) sediment bypass around an
onstream reservoir, (3) reservoir drawdown to pass sediment-laden ﬂoods through the
Sediment Management and Sustainable Use of Reservoirs
309

impoundment at a high velocity to minimize deposition, and (4) release of turbid density
currents through a bottom outlet. In all cases, the objective is to release sediment-laden water
and impound clear water.
8.1. Timewise Variation in Sediment Yield
Sediment yield is highly variable over all time frames. It is necessary to understand this
variability to properly interpret sediment data and devise efﬁcient management strategies.
These strategies take advantage of the timewise variation in suspended sediment concentra-
tion to capture and impound ﬂows having relatively low suspended load while passing high-
concentration ﬂows through or around the impoundment.
Most sediment is transported by ﬂoods, and the intervening period of normal or low ﬂows
typically transports relatively little sediment. Using data from the USA, Meade and Parker
[64] showed that for many rivers in the USA about two percent of the days account for
about half the annual sediment load. In smaller watersheds and mountainous areas sediment
discharge can be even more concentrated in time. Because so much sediment can be
discharged by large ﬂoods, sediment yield can vary dramatically from year to year, reﬂecting
variation in hydrologic conditions and timewise variations in sediment availability within the
watershed. In mountainous areas landslides can contribute over half the sediment load during
extreme events, and the onset of widespread landslide activity may be associated with an
intensity-duration threshold [65]. In mountainous watersheds the role of extreme events can
be particularly important, and a single catastrophically large event can generate sediment
loads, including debris ﬂows, equivalent to many decades of “normal” events. Such events
may not be reﬂected even in decades of gage record [66].
The ﬁner fraction of the total sediment load, the wash load, consists of sediment smaller
than the smallest 10 % contained in the stream bed material. This ﬁner material is “washed”
through the system without appreciable interaction with the stream bed because the hydraulic
energy is large enough to transport all the ﬁne sediment delivered to the stream. It is delivered
to the stream primarily by soil erosion in the watershed, and delivery rate to the stream is
dependent on rainfall-runoff processes. However, transport of the coarser material that
composes the predominate fraction of the stream bed, the bed material load, is driven
primarily by stream hydraulics rather than the delivery rate from the watershed. Thus, in a
sand or gravel bed stream, a storm early in the ﬂood season may have a high total suspended
load with a high component of ﬁne wash load, while a late-season storm having the same
discharge may have a much lower suspended sediment concentration of ﬁnes, while the rate of
bed material transport remains unaltered. The late-season suspended sediment yield from
watershed erosion may be reduced by factors such as increased ground cover as vegetative
grows, plus the seasonal exhaustion of readily mobilized sediment. Where a consistent
timewise sediment delivery pattern exists, it may be possible to route sediment-laden water
through or around the reservoir at the start of the season and to ﬁll the reservoir with late-
season discharge having a lower sediment concentration.
Suspended sediment concentration will also typically exhibit a systematic variation within
the duration of a single runoff event, producing hysteresis effects in concentration–discharge
310
G.L. Morris

(C–Q) graphs. If multiple samples are collected over the duration of a ﬂood event, a graph of
sediment concentration vs. discharge rarely produces a straight line relationship [67]. The
more common pattern is for sediment concentration to peak before discharge peaks, produc-
ing a clockwise concentration–discharge (C–Q) hysteresis loop (Fig. 5.12). This can occur
when the ﬁrst part of the ﬂood washes out readily mobilized sediment, leaving the latter
portion of the hydrograph relatively deﬁcient in sediment. Counterclockwise loops can occur
when more distant areas of the watershed have more erodible soils or when landslides develop
as soils become oversaturated as the storm progresses. The hysteresis pattern is not necessar-
ily a ﬁxed watershed characteristic, and different storms can produce different timewise
patterns in the same watershed.
8.2. Sediment Rating Relationships
Sediment yield can be measured by suspended sediment gaging stations operated for a
sufﬁcient number of years to obtain suspended sediment concentration and discharge data
over a wide range of ﬂows. These data may be used to deﬁne a sediment rating curve which
correlates discharge to suspended sediment concentration, and by applying this rating curve to
a longer streamﬂow record, the sediment discharge may be estimated over the entire period of
stream gage record. It is critical that ﬂoods be adequately sampled because they have both
high sediment concentration and ﬂow rates, and thus discharge a disproportionate amount of
the total load. Bed load is infrequently measured and is instead computed by a transport
equation or estimated as a ﬁxed percentage of suspended load.

where SSC ¼ concentration (mg/L), Q ¼ discharge (m3/s), b ¼ coefﬁcient value, and c ¼
exponent which is often in the vicinity of 1.5. While this equation implies an intercept of zero
concentration at zero discharge, use of a nonzero intercept may be appropriate in some
datasets to better represent the ﬂow range of interest.
There is typically considerable scatter in a graph of sediment concentration vs. discharge
due to variations in watershed and sediment delivery processes over time, and it is quite
common for sediment concentration to vary by more than an order of magnitude at a given
discharge. Horowitz [68] noted that “The key to a good rating-curve-derived ﬂux estimate
appears to be how well the regression averages out the ‘scatter’ in the data, rather than how
well the curve actually ﬁts all the data points.” When a regression equation is used to ﬁt a
curve to the logged discharge and concentration data, the resulting regression can underesti-
mate the true rating curve by as much as 50 % [69, 70]. Comparative analysis of data from
Europe by Asselman [70] indicates that curve ﬁtting by nonlinear least squares produces the
best overall ﬁt. To check that the rating curve accurately averages out the scatter, perform a
period-of-record total load comparison in which the total sediment load computed by the
rating equation is compared to the measured total load in the original sediment dataset. The
rating equation should be adjusted if these two loads do not match closely. Considerations for
constructing rating curves are discussed by Glysson [71].
When analyzing reservoir management techniques such as sediment bypass, in which only
the lower-discharge events are diverted into the reservoir, it is critical that the rating curve
reﬂect as accurately as possible the concentration–discharge relationship for the range of
ﬂows to be diverted. An equation that reproduces the total load in the original dataset will not
necessarily produce an unbiased ﬁt over the range of ﬂows that contribute most of the diverted
water volume. To protect against this error, a total load comparison (computed vs. dataset
load) should be performed over discrete discharge intervals to insure against rating equation
bias in any critical ﬂow range (Fig. 5.13). Similarly, the rating curve may produce concen-
trations too high when extrapolated to large discharges beyond the range of the original
dataset. In these cases, it is appropriate to use a multisegment rating curve incorporating more
than one equation, as also shown in Fig. 5.13. Manual preparation and adjustment of rating
curves should be performed to achieve a good overall ﬁt to the data when mathematical
equations do not adequately represent the dataset.
8.3. Sediment Bypass by Offstream Reservoir
Sediment bypass may be accomplished by constructing an offstream or off-channel reser-
voir, diverting water having low sediment concentration into storage by either gravity or
pumping while allowing large sediment-laden ﬂoods to bypass the storage pool (Fig. 5.14).
Water supply reservoirs fed by gravity have been constructed speciﬁcally for sediment
management in Taiwan [72] and Puerto Rico [73]. Offstream reservoirs provide other beneﬁts
in addition to sediment control. Exclusion of ﬂoods greatly diminishes spillway size, offset-
ting the cost of the intake and diversion works. Offstream reservoirs also avoid environmental
problems associated with the construction of onstream dams by minimizing impacts to
aquatic species and riparian wetlands, by maintaining the transport of bed material along
312
G.L. Morris

the natural stream channel, and it also improves the quality of water delivered to users such
as hydropower and water ﬁltration plants. The ability to sustain bed material transport along
the stream is particularly important as it avoids the problem of channel incision, accelerated
bank erosion, and riverine habitat loss that plagues river reaches below instream dams.
Sediment enters an offstream reservoir either as suspended inﬂow from the diverted stream
or by erosion from the watershed tributary to the dam. Simulations for the gravity-fed Rı´o
Fajardo offstream reservoir in Puerto Rico showed that 26 % of the total streamﬂow can be
diverted into the reservoir with only 6 % of the suspended sediment load. Additionally,
the intake design excludes 100 % of the bed material load. However, sediment eroding
from the small watershed tributary to the dam will be trapped with essentially 100 %
efﬁciency, since the reservoir is operated to avoid spills. For this reason, in developing
Fig. 5.14. Schematic of offstream reservoir supplied by a diversion dam, which allows sediment-laden
ﬂoodwaters and bed material load to continue downstream without entering the impoundment.
Fig. 5.13. Conceptual diagram showing adjustments in a sediment rating curve to produce an unbiased
estimate of the discharge–concentration relationship for the ranges of ﬂows to be diverted into
off-channel storage. In computations for sediment bypass, it is critical to insure that the rating curve
accurately reﬂects sediment concentration in the ﬂow range “2” which contributes most of the diverted
water and sediment inﬂow into the impoundment.
Sediment Management and Sustainable Use of Reservoirs

offstream reservoir sites, it is important to minimize the catchment area above the dam and to
undertake strict land use controls or convert the catchment to permanent forest to minimize
long-term sediment yield. At both offstream reservoirs in Puerto Rico the entire catchment
area tributary to the dam was acquired and dedicated to natural forest, generating reservoir
half-lives in excess of 1,000 years [73] despite naturally high sediment yields. The ﬁrm yield
of an offstream reservoir is related to both storage volume and diversion capacity. In moist
areas of Puerto Rico where rainfall is rather well distributed throughout the year, it is possible
to achieve a ﬁrm yield almost equal to that possible from an onstream reservoir of the same
volume with a diversion capacity equal to 140 % of mean annual ﬂow [73]. Under other
hydrologic settings, with more episodic runoff events, the required diversion capacity may
become too large to make offstream storage economically attractive.
8.4. Sediment Bypass at Onstream Reservoirs
Under favorable conditions it is possible to divert sediment around an onstream reservoir,
bypassing sediment-laden ﬂows using a channel or tunnel which discharges below the dam.
Taking advantage of river meanders, the Nagle reservoir in South Africa (Fig. 5.15) was
designed to pass sediment-laden ﬂoods around the main pool using a ﬂood-diversion dam and
a ﬂood bypass channel upstream of the storage pool [74]. In mountainous areas of Japan,
several bypass tunnels have been constructed to pass gravel-sized bed material from the
upstream limit of the reservoir to below the dam with the objective of maintaining the
continuity of coarse bed material ﬂow along the river to prevent stream incision and maintain
gravel beds for environmental purposes. The Japanese systems have a small diversion dam at
the upstream limit of the pool which directs bed material into the bypass tunnel (Fig. 5.16). To
date, bypass tunnels have been used primarily on mountain reservoirs which allow for tunnel
slopes of at least 1 %, and the maximum tunnel length reported to date is 4.3 km. When the

tunnel entrance is located at the upstream limit of the reservoir pool, the tunnel’s entrance sill
is set slightly below the riverbed elevation, followed by a short steep entrance reach to
accelerate ﬂow before transitioning to a long reach at constant slope. If the tunnel is located
within the reservoir pool, the entrance may be set below the normal reservoir level and water
is diverted during a sediment-bypassing ﬂood event by opening a normally closed gate. These
tunnels are characteristically designed to achieve supercritical ﬂow to maximize the discharge
per unit area, but the resulting combination of coarse sediment and high velocity can produce
substantial scour damage to the ﬂoor of the tunnel [75]. At the Solis reservoir in Switzerland, a
physical model study was used to support the design of a 900 m bypass tunnel which included
a skimming barrier at the tunnel entrance to exclude ﬂoating logs [76].
8.5. Turbid Density Currents
A turbid density current occurs when sediment-laden water enters an impoundment,
plunges beneath the clear water, and travels downstream along the submerged thalweg toward
the dam. Figure 5.6 illustrates characteristics of a turbidity current passing through a reservoir
showing the plunging ﬂow, movement through the impoundment, accumulation as a sub-
merged “muddy lake,” and release through a low-level outlet at the dam. As the current travels
downstream it will deposit the coarser part of its sediment load, and if enough sediment is
deposited the current will dissipate before reaching the dam.
Turbidity current forward motion is facilitated where a thick current can ﬂow along a
deﬁned channel, but as the submerged channel is inﬁlled with sediment the geometry of the
Fig. 5.16. Upstream area of Asahi reservoir, Japan, showing entrance to gravel bypass tunnel on the
right and cofferdam which directs ﬂood ﬂows into the tunnel (photo G. Morris).

reservoir bottom becomes ﬂat and wide. This causes the turbidity current to spread out,
becoming wide and shallow, increasing frictional resistance along both the top and the bottom
of the current. This lowers the velocity and results in the deposition of transported sediment.
For this reason, turbidity currents which reach the dam after initial impoundment may
dissipate after the bottom conﬁguration is modiﬁed by sedimentation. Regular ﬂushing can
maintain a submerged channel conducive to the propagation of turbidity currents to the area of
the dam. The impact of turbidity current release on the sediment balance in a reservoir is
illustrated by data from the Cachi hydroelectric reservoir in Costa Rica (Table 5.8). This
reservoir was being ﬂushed each year, thereby maintaining a normally submerged channel
along the reservoir which facilitated the ﬂow of turbidity currents to the low-level power
intake at the dam where the turbid water was vented with the turbine ﬂow.
Under the most favorable conditions some reservoirs in China’s Yellow River basin have
reported that turbidity currents transporting silts have discharged more sediments than the
inﬂow, a result of scouring and then transporting unconsolidated bed sediments. For example,
at the narrow 40 km long Liujiaxia hydropower and ﬂood control reservoir on China’s upper
Yellow River, a major sediment-laden tributary named the Tao River (Taohe), discharges
only 1.5 km above the dam. This tributary contributes 30 % of the inﬂowing sediment load,
consisting primarily of silt, but provides only 2 % of the reservoir’s storage capacity. Partial
drawdown during ﬂoods allows inﬂow along the Taohe to scour sediment from the bed,
transporting it to the outlet at the dam in the form of a turbid density current. By entraining
additional sediment by scour, it was possible to release over 100 % of the inﬂowing sediment
load during 13 of 25 density current release events during 1995. Over a 10-year period, 37 %
of the inﬂowing Toahe sediment was released [78].
The release of turbidity currents is dependent on successfully predicting the arrival time at
the dam and operating outlets to minimize the settling period in the muddy lake. Hydropower
facilities with low-level power intakes may be well suited to release these currents if the
dispatch schedule adopts sediment managed operation to allow continuous power production
during sediment-laden inﬂow events when only ﬁne sediments reach the dam, since these will
not normally abrade hydraulic machinery.

8.6. Sediment Routing by Reservoir Drawdown
The strategy for drawdown pass-through (often termed sluicing) is to route sediment-laden
inﬂows through the impounded reach at the highest velocity possible, maintaining sediment in
suspension and minimizing deposition in the reservoir. High-velocity ﬂows are achieved by
reservoir drawdown, and the reservoir is reﬁlled with water having lower sediment concen-
tration toward the end of the inﬂow event. Because this strategy entails substantial drawdown
and reﬁlling of the reservoir, it is only suitable for reservoirs with a small storage capacity in
relation to annual streamﬂow. It also requires large-capacity low-level outlets.
Sediment pass-through was ﬁrst employed in a large reservoir at the Sanmenxia dam on
China’s Yellow River, where serious sedimentation problems required reconstruction of the
outlet works to permit seasonal emptying at the beginning of the ﬂood season to generate
riverine ﬂow along the length of the reservoir, not only passing inﬂowing sediment but also
scouring out sediment accumulated from the prior year’s impounding [29, 79]. The best-
known example of this strategy is the Three Gorges Reservoir in China, which also employs a
seasonal drawdown [29]. At smaller reservoirs the drawdown may be performed for individ-
ual ﬂood events, instead of seasonally, reﬁlling the reservoir’s storage pool at the end of each
pass-through event. A sediment routing operation of this type in a reservoir with a smaller
watershed is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5.17. The management system consists of real-
time rain and stream gage stations with attendant software to monitor and predict inﬂow rate
Fig. 5.17. Conceptual operation of a reservoir for sediment pass-through. (1) Normal operation,

and volume. This operation may be described in a sequence of four steps. (1) During periods
of normal weather the reservoir maintains storage for water supply and the hydrologic
forecast system continuously updates ﬂood forecast parameters such as antecedent soil
moisture. (2) At the onset of a large rainfall event, reservoir gates are opened to draw down
the storage pool at a rate not exceeding the accumulation of runoff volume in the watershed as
determined by hydrologic modeling based on received rainfall and corroborated by discharge
measurements at upper watershed stream gages. The total volume in the system, consisting of
the volume in the reservoir plus the predicted 24-h inﬂow volume from the watershed, is never
allowed to drop below the reservoir capacity, thereby ensuring the storage pool can always be
reﬁlled. (3) During a large volume ﬂood, reservoir gates are fully opened and high-velocity
riverine ﬂow occurs through the impoundment, transporting ﬂood-laden sediment beyond the
dam. (4) When the hydrologic model indicates that the runoff volume under the predicted
hydrograph has declined to that required to reﬁll the reservoir, gates are closed and the
reservoir is reﬁlled. While this method may mobilize and remove some of the previously
deposited sediment, its main focus is to minimize deposition, particularly since the velocity
required to maintain cohesive sediment in suspension is much less than that required to scour
sediments which have already been deposited. Maintaining sediment transport through the
impounded river reach during ﬂoods avoids the environmental impacts that accompany
strategies such as ﬂushing, which releases high-concentration ﬂows with limited discharge,
and thus requires particular attention to environmental mitigation. A key feature of sediment
pass-through is that it maintains the natural ﬂood hydrograph and its associated sediment
transport along the river system.
9. RECOVER, INCREASE, OR REALLOCATE STORAGE VOLUME
Sediment removal can be undertaken by opening a low-level outlet to produce hydraulic
scour and remove sediments, a process termed ﬂushing. There are two basic types of ﬂushing
operations: pressure ﬂushing occurs when a low-level outlet is opened while the reservoir
pool is held at a high level, and drawdown ﬂushing, empty ﬂushing, or more commonly simply
ﬂushing, occurs when the reservoir is completely emptied and riverine ﬂow runs along the
entire length of the reservoir and out the bottom outlet [79].
The term sluicing refers to any method which removes sediment through a low-level outlet
(a sluice gate), and the term sluicing has been used by different authors to refer to sluicing
(venting) of turbidity currents, sluicing by partial drawdown (sediment pass-through), sluic-
ing through a tunnel (sediment bypass), and sluicing by reservoir emptying (ﬂushing). Given
its multiple interpretations, use of this term is not recommended.
Sediment can also be removed mechanically from beneath the water while the reservoir is
inundated (dredging) or with the reservoir empty (dry excavation). Mechanical methods to
excavate sediment are well known and are invariably suggested to “solve” sedimentation
problems. However, to rely solely on mechanical equipment and fuel to sustain a sediment
balance across a reservoir can rarely be considered a sustainable strategy, and the mechanical
management of sediment should normally be evaluated as a complement to other measures
rather than as a stand-alone practice.

9.1. Pressure Flushing for Localized Sediment Removal
Pressure ﬂushing will release only a relatively small volume of sediment in the immediate
vicinity of the ﬂushing outlet. If an intake is located immediately above or adjacent to a
low-level outlet operated for pressure ﬂushing, it will be possible to maintain the intake area
free of sediment. With reference to the deﬁnition sketch in Fig. 5.18, in granular sediment, the
angle of repose of the scour cone under continuously submerged conditions will approximate
the submerged angle of repose of the sediment, on the order of approximately 30. In the case
of cohesive sediment this angle can be much steeper, and operators at some sites have found it
necessary to dredge cohesive sediment in front of the intake to reduce clogging despite
continuous hydropower releases. Based on laboratory experiments on scour cone formation
using cohensionless sediment [80], it was reported that the half cone created centered on the
outlet at the wall of the dam was nearly symmetrical and that the volume of the scour cone is
increased (angle of repose decreased) by increased discharge, increased outlet diameter, or
decreased water depth over the sediment deposit. When a reservoir is emptied, sediments will
normally slump and the dewatered angle of repose can be less than half of the submerged
value. When an outlet is buried in sediment it may be necessary to sink a small shaft (e.g., by
water jet) to create a piping channel to initiate ﬂow through the outlet.
9.2. Empty Flushing
Empty ﬂushing entails opening a low-level outlet to completely drain the reservoir and
scour out sediment. Flushing of this type inevitably occurs as a consequence of reservoir
emptying for any reason, such as emptying to repair a low-level intake. The removal of
sediment by ﬂushing is an old technique dating to Moorish Spain over 500 years ago
when emptying and ﬂushing of irrigation reservoirs was scheduled at intervals of 4 years
[81]. Today ﬂushing is frequently undertaken on an annual basis and the ﬂushing duration
may vary from a few days to a few weeks, but its utilization is limited due to adverse
downstream impacts. Empty ﬂushing has primarily been practiced in hydrologically small
Fig. 5.18. Deﬁnition sketch for pressure scouring.
Sediment Management and Sustainable Use of Reservoirs

reservoirs (low capacity:inﬂow ratio) on streams in mountainous areas. Maximum ﬂushing
effectiveness is achieved using the highest discharge that can be passed through the bottom
outlet without backwater.
When the river is allowed to run through the impoundment and exit through a low-level
outlet it will scour a channel across the deposits, typically following the original river channel.
The volume within the reservoir that can be sustained by ﬂushing can be deﬁned based on
the width of the ﬂushing channel and the side slope angle (Fig. 5.19). In narrow reservoirs
ﬂushing has been used to sustain most of the original reservoir capacity, but in wider
reservoirs sediments deposited on either side of the ﬂushing channel during impounding
will not be removed and will create a submerged ﬂoodplain that continues to accumulate
sediment and increase in elevation over time. Sediment removal during ﬂushing can be
increased by using mechanical equipment to push sediment into the ﬂushing channel or by
diverting smaller ﬂows laterally across erodible ﬂoodplain deposits. This lateral erosion
procedure has been used successfully in Chinese reservoirs where sediments are predomi-
nately erodible silts [82]. Where a signiﬁcant clay content is present, consolidation of the
cohesive sediment can impair erosion.
Regular ﬂushing which sustains a deﬁned channel along the length of the reservoir will
facilitate the passage of turbidity currents to the dam where they can be released through
low-level outlets. Also, turbidity currents will deposit their sediment into the submerged
ﬂushing channel from whence they can be readily removed during subsequent ﬂushing events.
The data previously presented for Cachı´ reservoir in Table 5.8 which showed high rates of
sediment removal reﬂects the beneﬁcial effects of the ﬂushing channel which conducts
turbidity currents to the power intake at the dam and which also focuses deposition of ﬁne
sediment from turbidity currents into the submerged ﬂushing channel from which it is easily
removed during the subsequent ﬂushing event.
Flushing is much less efﬁcient in removing coarse sediment from a reservoir. Bed material
sediment is transported and deposited on the reservoir delta by ﬂoods with high hydraulic
transport capacity, but ﬂushing ﬂows are typically limited by bottom outlet size and cannot
generate the transport capacity required to remove the volume of bed material delivered to the
delta area by natural inﬂows. Thus, while ﬂushing may achieve a sediment balance for the ﬁne

fraction of the inﬂowing load, the coarse fraction may continue to accumulate in the reservoir
(as occurs at Cachı´ reservoir per Table 5.8). For example, Sumi and Kantoush [83] reported
that ﬂushing at the Unazuki dam in Japan was effective in removing 73 % of the total sediment
inﬂow but removed only 10 % of the annual load of coarse sediment >2 mm in diameter.
Thus, the geometry of the ﬂushing channel deﬁned in Figure 5.19 may not be sustainable in
the very long term because it does not represent the behavior of the continuously accumulat-
ing coarse sediment.
9.3. Downstream Impacts of Flushing
Flushing releases high sediment loads with limited water volumes, potentially producing
downstream environmental impacts including reduced dissolved oxygen, high sediment
concentrations that interfere with the function of gills and smothers stream benthos, reduction
in visibility and light penetration, and channel morphological impacts such as inﬁlling of
pools and clogging of river gravels with ﬁne sediment, thereby eliminating spawning sites and
habitat. Social and economic impacts include the interference with water treatment processes
for municipal or other users, sedimentation within irrigation canals if not designed to transport
sediment, accumulation in heat exchangers which draw water from the river, reduction of
recreational quality, impacts to ﬁsheries of economic importance, accumulation in ﬂood
control and navigational channels, and impacts to coastal areas. While the total amount of
sediment released is not different from that which would have been transported downstream
absent the dam, the combination of high sediment concentrations during ﬂushing, changed
downstream hydrology due to the dam, and the potential to release sediment-laden water out
of sync with natural biological cycles, can produce large adverse impacts.
The downstream impacts associated with ﬂushing are related primarily to the release of
high-concentration ﬂows. Early in the process of reservoir drawdown for ﬂushing much of
the sediment scoured from the upper part of the impoundment will be redeposited before
reaching the dam. Sediment eroded from within the impoundment is discharged as a high-
concentration mud ﬂow only as the reservoir approaches full drawdown. This causes the
suspended sediment concentration in the released water to rapidly spike to a very high level,
often in the range of 100,000–400,000 mg/L, if not otherwise controlled by limiting the
release rate to match dilution ﬂows. Typical variations in hydraulic parameters and suspended
sediment concentration during ﬂushing are illustrated in Fig. 5.20. The highest concentrations
associated with ﬂushing events occur in reservoirs with annual maintenance ﬂushing because
recent poorly consolidated sediments in the ﬂushing channel can be readily mobilized as a
thick mud ﬂow as soon as free ﬂow is established along the bottom of the reservoir.
Based on the experience at alpine reservoirs in Europe which are ﬂushed to maintain
capacity, the following measures have been identiﬁed as minimizing the adverse environ-
mental impacts of reservoir ﬂushing [84, 85]:
l
Timing of release. The most important criterion for minimizing ﬂushing impacts is the proper
timing of the release. Flushing releases should be timed to coincide with natural high-ﬂow events
or releases from other reservoirs to provide dilution, and particularly ﬂows from tributaries
downstream of the dam. Also, if ﬂushing coincides with the beginning of the wet season, there is
Sediment Management and Sustainable Use of Reservoirs
321

the opportunity for subsequent ﬂoods to cleanse the river channel and gravel beds of ﬁne sediment
deposited by the ﬂushing release. If ﬂushing releases sediment when ﬁsh are using gravels for
spawning or the recently emerged weak-swimming larvae are using gravels for refuge, the juvenile
population may be decimated, making it important to use biological as well as hydrologic criteria in
selecting ﬂushing dates. Because natural populations of juvenile ﬁsh can experience signiﬁcant
cyclic ﬂuctuations, it is important to understand and document population ﬂuctuations due to
natural or other impacts and separate them from the impact of reservoir management.
l
Duration of release. At a number of sites, the volume required to ﬂush sediment from a reservoir is
signiﬁcantly less than the volume required to transport the released sediment downstream in a
manner which minimizes localized sediment accumulation [29]. The availability of tributary inﬂow
and the ability to release clear water downstream to further transport the released sediment soon
after the low-level outlet is closed are important mitigation factors.
l
Frequency of release. More frequent releases can result in smaller sediment releases during each
event, which would normally be considered favorable. For example, a review of data from ﬂushing
at the Dashidaira and Unazuki dams on the Kurobe River in Japan indicated that adverse
downstream impacts to the river channel were limited because of frequent ﬂushing, high stream
slope which facilitated transport of the released sediment, and the short distance (<30 km) to the
sea. To minimize water quality problems, the reservoirs were ﬂushed as frequently as possible
during periods of high ﬂow to provide high dilution volumes, thereby reducing the peak suspended
Fig. 5.20. Typical pattern of variation in suspended sediment concentration during ﬂushing events.
When a reservoir is ﬂushed for the ﬁrst time and a ﬂushing channel is gradually eroded, peak suspended
sediment concentrations are lower than when a reservoir ﬂushed on a regular basis. With regular
maintenance ﬂushing, suspended sediments that accumulate in the ﬂushing channel do not consolidate
between ﬂushing events and are discharged as highly concentrated mud.

G.L. Morris

sediment concentration and sustaining higher oxygen levels in the stream below the dam [83]. Stud-
ies of ﬂushing impacts in Italy [84] also emphasized the positive effect of frequent (annual) ﬂushing
which minimizes the amount of sediment release during any single event, in combination with the
adequate release of clear water for dilution and cleaning the bed after the sediment release. Fish
were impacted by both the high discharge and elevated sediment concentration, with juveniles
being particularly susceptible.
Flushing has not been feasible in many areas of the world due to downstream water quality
impacts, and only in recently years has signiﬁcant attention been directed at developing
ﬂushing strategies to minimize these impacts.
9.4. Flushing Equations
A rough preliminary idea of ﬂushing channel geometry can be deﬁned by two equations,
one to estimate the width of the ﬂushing channel and the other to estimate the slope angle
of channel banks [85], as previously deﬁned in Figure 5.19. Channel bottom width can be
estimated by
B ¼ 12:8Q0:5

ð5:6Þ
and the bank angle can be estimated by
tan α ¼ 31:5

The rate of sediment discharge during ﬂushing based on data from Chinese reservoirs can
be roughly estimated by the Tsinghua University equation [29]:
Qs ¼ Ψ
Q1:6
f S1:2
B0:6
ð5:8Þ
where Qs is sediment transporting capacity (T/s), Qf is ﬂushing discharge (m3/s), S is bed
slope, B is channel width (m), and Ψ is a constant determined by sediment type: 1,600 for
loess sediments, 650 for other sediments with median size <0.1 mm, 300 for sediments with
median size >0.1 mm, and 180 for ﬂushing with a “low” discharge. These equations provide
only a rough approximation of ﬂushing performance, but they do show the importance of
maximizing the discharge during ﬂushing events. A tenfold increase in discharge increases
the rate of sediment discharge by a factor of 20 and increases the channel width by a factor of
3, while cutting in half the volume of water needed to remove a ﬁxed sediment volume.
Reservoir ﬂushing in China is frequently performed annually, meaning that the ﬂushing
channel reﬁlls with sediments which do not have time to consolidate before the next ﬂushing
event and making ﬂushing very efﬁcient in terms of water use. Atkinson [85] suggests that
equation may overestimate the rate of sediment discharge by a factor of approximately three
when ﬂushing sediments that have had many years to consolidate or when ﬂushing from a
reservoir with sediments coarser than 0.1 mm diameter.

9.5. Dredging
Dredging refers to the excavation of material from beneath the water. There are broadly
two types of dredging: mechanical dredging in which the dredged material is removed by
buckets such as a clamshell, dragline, or bucket ladder dredge or hydraulic dredging in which
sediment is excavated and transported as a slurry. Mechanical dredging is generally used in
low-volume applications which focus on dredging of smaller areas and the removal of woody
debris, such as the area around an intake, or for the removal of gravels and cobbles from the
delta as this coarse material is inefﬁcient to dredge hydraulically. Mechanical dredging in
reservoirs typically entails haulage of the material to a disposal site by truck.
Volume-wise, most sediment is removed from reservoirs by hydraulic cutterhead dredges.
The principal components of a hydraulic dredging system are illustrated in Fig. 5.21. Hydrau-
lic dredges can achieve high rates of production, can handle a wide range of grain sizes, do not

324
G.L. Morris

interfere with normal reservoir operation, and the slurry pipeline is a clean and low-impact
means to convey dredged material to the disposal site.
A special type of hydraulic dredging developed only for reservoirs is the siphon or
hydrosuction dredge [86], which does not use a pump but instead uses the difference in
head between the reservoir water surface and a discharge point at the base of the dam as the
energy source for slurry transport, as illustrated in Fig. 5.22. Because the amount of hydraulic
energy available is ﬁxed by the reservoir level, which may vary, high friction losses in the
slurry pipeline typically limit the use of siphon dredges to the removal of sediment within
about 2 km of the dam. A slurry pipeline must be designed to transport the largest grain sizes
in the material to be dredged. The high velocity required to sustain sand or coarser material in
suspension generates high friction loss, making it infeasible to transport coarse material over
signiﬁcant distances without energy input by pumping. Longer transport distances are feasible
with uniformly ﬁne material because they can be transported at lower velocities without
sedimentation in the pipeline. The hydraulics of slurry pipeline transport of coarse materials
for siphon dredging in reservoirs has been outlined by Eftekharzadeh [87].
Dredging is expensive and is typically much more costly than creating storage volume by
dam construction. Dredging costs include engineering and permitting, costs associated with
acquisition, and management of the dredged material placement site, plus the cost of dredging
itself. Dredging costs vary widely, and 2013 reservoir dredging costs can be expected to
run in the general range of $5 to $15/m3, provided there are no unusual conditions such as
contaminated sediments. The unit cost of reservoir dredging is typically higher than naviga-
tional dredging because dredges must be transported to the reservoir by land and are typically
smaller than the equipment available for navigational dredging. Upland dredged material
containment area costs may also be higher than in navigational dredging.
The availability of land for the disposal of dredged material is an important impediment
to sustaining long-term reservoir capacity by dredging. Material removed by hydraulic
dredging is subject to bulking, and if ﬁnes are present the volume of containment area must
be proportionally larger than the in situ volume of the material to be dredged, as computed by
the dimensionless bulking factor:
Fig. 5.22. Siphon or hydrosuction dredging conﬁguration.
Sediment Management and Sustainable Use of Reservoirs
325

B ¼ Vc
Vi
¼ γc
γi
ð5:9Þ
where V ¼ volume, γ ¼ dry unit weight, and subscripts c and i refer, respectively, to
containment area and in situ values. The value of the bulking factors is 1.0 for pure sands,
in the range of 1.3 for silts, but can exceed 1.5 for clays. Their value depends on the amount of
consolidation in the area being dredged as well as the settling characteristic of the material.
Thus, the bulking factor for older consolidated clay deposits may be larger than for recent clay
deposits having a lower in situ dry unit weight. Column settling tests should be run for at least
15 days to better determine the anticipated settling characteristics of the material to be
dredged. Over time the dredged material will dewater and consolidate, particularly when
the material is dewatered and provided with good surface drainage and plant roots penetrate
the material [88].
In some instances, it is permissible to discharge dredged material to the river channel
downstream of the dam. Discharge below the dam is advantageous in that it sustains the ﬂow
of sediment along the channel, with the principal problem being that sediment is released
continuously rather than being timed to coincide with natural discharge events. Nevertheless,
at smaller dams in mountainous areas with frequent downstream releases, sediment discharge
to the river below the dam can represent a good alternative, especially when coarse bed
material can be placed below the dam to replenish the cutoff of sediment supply due to the
dam. Small-scale downstream sediment replenishment in the Isa River, Germany, is described
in Hartmann [90] and in the Nunome River, Japan, is described by Kantoush and Sumi
[89]. When downstream discharge is not feasible, dredging can be sustained only as long as
there is space available in containment areas which are sufﬁciently close to the reservoir to be
economically feasible.
9.6. Dry Excavation
Dry excavation has been used in some instances to remove sediment from reservoirs.
Unlike dredging, it requires that reservoir level be lowered or emptied to allow access to
deposits by earthmoving equipment. At some sites with predictable seasonal water-level
variation, dry excavation can be undertaken on a seasonal basis. Disposal area limitations
similar to those associated with dredging apply, the difference being that sediment transport is
typically by truck haulage with attendant damage to roads, public disturbance from trafﬁc and
dust, etc. Dry excavation can easily remove coarse material from the delta, but removal of
deep deposits of poorly consolidated ﬁne sediment presents signiﬁcant difﬁculties absent a
period for dewatering and consolidation.
9.7. Raise the Dam
Raising the dam to increase storage capacity can, in some cases, provide a volume increase
sufﬁcient to substantially delay sediment problems. Due to reservoir geometry, each height
increment provides more volume than the prior increment, making even relatively small
326
G.L. Morris

height increases potentially important. However, raising the dam is neither a simple nor
inexpensive undertaking. In addition to structural and hydraulic considerations, raising the
dam may entail additional land acquisition, upstream ﬂood levels will increase, delta depo-
sition will move further upstream, evaporative surface will be enlarged, etc. Raising the dam
in combination with improvements to gates to facilitate sediment release may improve the
long-term sediment balance. However, if the dam is raised to increase storage capacity
without other sediment management measures, it may not contribute to a long-term solution.
9.8. Structural Modiﬁcations
Sedimentation can interfere with intake operation and can result in the entrainment of
coarse sediment. For example, at the glacial-fed Gebidem hydropower reservoir in Switzer-
land, which maintains storage capacity by annual ﬂushing, ﬁne sands were being carried into
the area of the low-level outlet and causing turbine abrasion. In this case a new intake tower
was installed and provided with multiple-level inlets at higher elevations in the pool to avoid
the entrainment of sand (290). When ﬁne sediment accumulates in front of the dam that does
not practice sediment removal, the intake may be raised to avoid the accumulating sediment.
The disadvantage of this approach is that it will tend to maintain a high reservoir trap
efﬁciency. In general, turbid density currents should be released insofar as possible, and
passage of turbidity currents through turbines will typically not cause abrasion problems due
to the small grain size of the transported sediment.
To minimize interference by sedimentation, intakes should be placed above or adjacent to a
low-level outlet, so that operation of the outlet for either pressure or empty ﬂushing will clean
out the area in front of the intake. However, many reservoirs have intakes located at the side of
a reservoir, a signiﬁcant distance from either the low-level outlet or the channel which is
created by ﬂushing through a low-level outlet. In such cases it may be necessary to construct a
normally submerged pipe or other conveyance structure from the intake to an area of the dam
which can be maintained sediment-free by pressure ﬂushing or to the location of the ﬂushing
channel. This conveyance structure should be sized to generate the velocities required to
avoid sedimentation within the conveyance structure, based on the largest sediment size likely
to be entrained. Relocation of the intake entrance by this method may increase the frequency
with which turbid density currents are diverted into the intake.
9.9. Reuse of Reservoir Sediments
Reservoir sediments will reﬂect conditions in the upstream watershed, including the
contaminants generated by upstream activities. If there is extensive upstream agricultural
activity including the historical application of persistent pesticides, these may be found in the
reservoir sediments and should be evaluated when considering reuse options. Similarly,
upstream mining or industrial activity can result in sediment contamination. However, in
general reservoir sediments do not present special hazards and can be readily reused for
activities such as agriculture, ﬁll, or construction materials if sediments are sufﬁciently
coarse. Testing protocols to insure compatibility with intended uses will vary by jurisdiction
and by intended use.

10. TOWARD ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE USE
10.1. Modeling of Sediment Management Activities
Future sedimentation patterns and alternative sediment management activities can be best
examined by simulation modeling. Depending on the situation, the appropriate tool may be a
physical model, a numerical model, or both. Physical modeling is typically used to simulate
the detailed behavior of 3-dimensional ﬂow patterns, deposition, scour and the movement of
ﬂoating debris in the vicinity of structures such as intakes, gates, and spillways. Numerical
sediment transport models are currently used for both single-event and longer-term (e.g.,
100-year) simulations focusing on larger-scale scour and deposition phenomena. Fundamen-
tal aspects of sediment transport are covered by Yang [91], and the mathematical basis for
numerical models has been summarized by Simo¯es and Yang [92]; this section will focus on
several practical aspects of numerical modeling.
Numerical models may solve ﬂow problems in one, two, or three dimensions.
One-dimensional models have been in use for many years, and two-dimensional models are
increasingly being used as computational capacity expands. Three-dimensional models
remain, at this moment, more in the purview of academic research. Inasmuch as river-
reservoir systems can frequently be simulated as one-dimensional systems, 1-D models
have been employed in many situations to predict the timing and patterns of sediment
deposition and scour. One-dimensional models available from US government agencies
include SRH-1D available from the US Bureau of Reclamation and HEC-RAS (successor
to the HEC-6 sediment transport model) available from the US Army Corps of Engineers.
Both models can simulate the behavior of both coarse and cohesive sediment.
One-dimensional models are used to simulate the changes in bed proﬁles and the longitu-
dinal variation in grain size as a result of changes in discharge, sediment load, and the
inﬂuence of hydraulic structures which raise or lower water levels and sediment transport
capacity. They cannot simulate situations involving secondary currents and transverse sedi-
ment movement, changes in stream morphology such as meandering, point bar formation,
pool-rifﬂe formation, and many plan form changes. They also cannot simulate the details of
local deposition and erosion resulting from intakes, bridges, and other instream structures.
Several types of reservoir sedimentation questions are commonly addressed using
one-dimensional models. One question is to predict the future sedimentation pattern and
particularly the evolution of the reservoir delta into the pool as well as deltaic aggradation
upstream above the pool. A second question involves the extent to which the sedimentation
rate and patterns will be modiﬁed by changes in factors such as sediment input or reservoir
operation. A third question involves the effectiveness of sediment removal and the reservoir
proﬁles resulting from reservoir ﬂushing. A fourth question involves the response of the
channel below the dam as affected by reduced sediment inﬂow from reservoir construction or
from an increase in sediment inﬂow due to reservoir ﬂushing, dam removal, or other
management. Models may be run to examine the effects of a single ﬂood event, multiple
events, or long-term (>100 year) behavior, depending on the nature of the question to be
addressed. Because most sediment is transported by ﬂoods, simulations frequently focus on
these large events.

Input data required for numerical modeling include geometry, hydraulics, sediment, and
operating rules. Model geometry is established using cross sections of the river-reservoir
system. Hydraulic parameters include the inﬂow time series at the upstream boundary plus
any tributaries, the downstream water surface boundary (subcritical ﬂow), plus rating curves
for any internal boundaries such as gates or weirs. Sediment data includes speciﬁcation of the
bed material size distribution, depth to bedrock at each cross section, sediment deposit
density, and the inﬂowing load for each grain size as a function of discharge and density of
sediment deposits. It is also necessary to select the appropriate sediment transport equation
from the several that are available. Operating rules involve the management of water levels
during inﬂow events, which directly inﬂuences the ﬂow velocity and trap efﬁciency in the
reservoir and which may also entail periods of reservoir drawdown for sediment ﬂushing.
The simulation of sediment transport is usually undertaken with very limited data.
For example, many locations will not have a suspended sediment gage station to provide
data to construct a sediment rating curve, and bed material transport data are virtually never
available. Furthermore, selection of one or another transport equation can change the trans-
port rate by more than an order of magnitude. This makes model veriﬁcation essential.
When simulating sedimentation within an existing reservoir, the model can be exercised
over the historical period and parameters adjusted until a reasonable ﬁt is made to the
observed depositional pattern and grain size distribution within the reservoir.
Calibration of a sediment transport model should start with the hydraulic elements,
adjusting hydraulic roughness or other parameters until a reasonable match is achieved
against any available hydraulic proﬁle data. Calibration of a sediment transport model for
an existing reservoir requires bathymetric data from at least two points in time, plus data on
the grain size of deposited sediments as a function of location along the reservoir. Grain size
samples should be taken using a sediment core, since grab samples from the surface of the
sediment deposits will reﬂect only the most recent period of sedimentation rather than average
conditions. The model is calibrated by starting with the pre-impoundment condition, and then
run to simulate the documented post-impoundment geometry and grain size along the
reservoir, while insuring that the resulting value of reservoir trap efﬁciency is reasonable.
This may require adjustment of the amount and grain size in the inﬂowing sediment load and a
change in the transport function. If simulating sedimentation in a proposed reservoir, the
model may be run for a period of decades using the existing stream geometry to insure that it
properly simulates the existing proﬁle and grain size distribution along the river while
transporting anticipated amounts of sediment through the system. However, this will verify
only the coarse fraction of the load as represented in the bed material, but most reservoir
sediments consist of ﬁnes which behave as wash load. This makes it important to have a good
estimate of the suspended sediment rating curve, and lacking this the inﬂowing load will need
to be approximated from other suspended sediment gages which may exist in the area, or
based on volume of sediment trapped. Modeling cannot overcome errors in the estimate of
the inﬂowing suspended sediment load.
An important factor limiting the reliability of sediment transport models is the availability
of data for model calibration. Grain size will exhibit signiﬁcant variation within a reservoir
Sediment Management and Sustainable Use of Reservoirs

and may be locally inﬂuenced by the lateral inﬂows from minor tributaries. It is important that
the modeler understand the sampling procedures that were used, obtain samples at multiple
locations, and should ideally be personally involved in at least some sediment ﬁeld work.
It is also necessary to interpret results from transport models for overall reasonableness, since
sediment calibration data are not themselves always consistent. The future conditions which
are simulated should always be interpreted as a general guide rather than a precise prediction,
taking into consideration limitations that exist in the calibration data, the uncertainty of future
hydrologic conditions, and the limitations inherent in using a simpliﬁed model to study a
complex process.
An example of the use of the SRH-1D model was given by simulations performed at the
Peligre reservoir in Haiti [18], which had lost 50 % of its capacity after 50 years of operation.
This reservoir produces hydropower and also delivers water to irrigators downstream in the
Artibonite Valley. The conﬁguration of this reservoir was previously shown in Figures 5.4
and 5.5. A study was undertaken for the Inter-American Development Bank to determine
whether or not coarse sediments would enter the hydropower intake within the next 20 years.
To address this question, the reservoir was surveyed to determine the existing (2008)
conﬁguration of sediment deposits, and sediment samples were collected to determine the
longitudinal grain size distribution. The SRH-1D model was started with the 1980 bathymetry
(the original reservoir conﬁguration was not available) and calibrated against the 2008
bathymetry. Because there are no data on inﬂowing grain size data, the inﬂowing grain size
distribution was adjusted to produce the grain size distribution observed in the reservoir from
ﬁeld samples. The calibrated model was then run 100 years into the future under the existing
and alternative operating rules, including a rule which included periodic ﬂushing using the
existing outlets. Simulation results for the recommended operating rule are illustrated in
Fig. 5.23 showing the simulation of delta advancement toward the dam. These results
indicated that coarse sediment would not enter the intakes during the next 20 years. Further-
more, it was shown that by both raising the power intake level and using the recommended
operating rule, it would be possible to sustain hydropower operations during the next
100 years with no reduction in energy production, although the reduction in storage would
signiﬁcantly impair the reliability of irrigation supplies. It also showed that absent a large
low-level outlet to discharge large ﬂoods with signiﬁcant reservoir drawdown, it will not be
possible to ﬂush a signiﬁcant part of the delta sediment from the reservoir. However, when the
reservoir capacity is greatly reduced, and by operating at the lowest possible level during
ﬂood events (sediment pass-through), the trap efﬁciency is reduced from 95 % to 50 % over
the 100-year simulation period.
10.2. Implementation Steps
Reservoir operation becomes sustainable once a program is implemented to bring sediment
inﬂow and outﬂow into long-term balance in a manner that produces signiﬁcant net beneﬁts to
society while sustaining the integrity of ecological systems. Sustainable operation at a speciﬁc
reservoir site may be achieved through a sequence of actions such as those listed below:
330
G.L. Morris

1.
Data collection. Perform bathymetric studies at regular intervals to document the pattern and trend
of sediment accumulation and to identify those beneﬁcial uses most threatened by sedimentation.
Operate one or more sediment monitoring gage stations upstream of the reservoir to collect data
for construction of a sediment rating curve including grain size distribution of the inﬂowing load,
giving particular attention to monitoring ﬂood events. The sediment rating curve is an important
input for numerical modeling.
2.
Predict sedimentation patterns and impacts. Use sediment transport modeling to predict long-term
sedimentation patterns, identifying the beneﬁts to be impacted and approximate time frames when
sediment will interfere with speciﬁc operations.
3.
Adaptive measures. Identify and implement measures to adapt to sedimentation. This may include
measures at the reservoir such as pool reallocation, modiﬁcation, or optimization of operating rules
or offsite measures such as development of an alternative water supply and increased efﬁciency of
resource use through water conservation, reuse, or loss reduction.
4.
Select long-term sediment management strategy. Identify feasible strategies to manage sediment,
assign action priorities based on the urgency and consequences of sedimentation, and establish an
implementation timetable. The sedimentation impacts at some sites may be very large as loss of an
essential water supply or ﬂood protection may eliminate the livelihood of entire communities, and
large consequences can justify aggressive sediment management actions. If sedimentation will
lead to decommissioning of the dam, those implications and potential liabilities should also be
considered.
The most appropriate strategies may change over time as the reservoir loses capacity; manage-
ment measures such as sediment routing by drawdown may not be technically feasible early in the
reservoir life, but will become feasible as storage volume diminishes. Conversely, the ability to

dam, Haiti [18].
Sediment Management and Sustainable Use of Reservoirs
331

release turbid density currents may diminish over time. If heightening or a new dam is selected as
an alternative, land should be acquired or otherwise reserved for this eventual use.
5.
Implementation. Initiate those activities required to support the long-term strategy. At sites without
a signiﬁcant near-term problem or mitigation opportunities, implementation may be limited to the
data collection program. At sites with more proximate problems or immediate sediment manage-
ment opportunities, implementation may include detailed analysis, design, environmental permit-
ting, operational modiﬁcations, and construction activities. Even though some types of control
measures may be delayed until sedimentation is more advanced, these should be identiﬁed and
scheduled. The objective is to outline the path to sustainable operation and insure that all future
activities are coincident with this path.
6.
Monitoring. Monitor the impacts of implementation measures, and adjust sediment management
activities as needed to maximize long-term beneﬁts.
In summary, long-term stainable use requires that project design and operation look beyond
the traditional planning horizons associated with project ﬁnancing. It requires that owners and
engineers actively pursue measures to establish a sediment balance across the impounded
reach. In the same manner that dams are designed and managed to comply with dam safety
and environmental criteria, sustainability should also be considered an essential component of
the project, implementing to the greatest extent possible those elements that lead to a long-
term sediment balance.

1. INTRODUCTION
Thorough understandings of basic theories of sediment transport and surface erosion are
important to river erosion and sedimentation, river morphology, reservoir sedimentation and
operation, and river engineering studies. In spite of centuries of effort by river engineers, most
of the tools used by river engineers still rely heavily on engineering experiences and
judgments. Equations used by engineers are often based on simpliﬁed assumptions with
limited tests and veriﬁcations of the validity of their application to ﬁeld conditions. Different
and often conﬂicting assumptions are used in the derivation of equations. These conﬂicting
assumptions often become the source of inconsistence among the results using different
equations and theories.
This chapter will summarize the theory of unit stream power and formulas for sediment
transport and surface erosion derived from that theory. From theoretical point of view, river
hydraulics is indeterminate because there are more unknowns than independent equations
available for solving them. River engineers often use site-speciﬁc empirical relations to obtain
some ad hoc solutions. The theory of minimum energy dissipation rate and its simpliﬁed
minimum stream power and minimum unit stream power theories can provide river engineers
the needed theoretical basis changing river hydraulics from indeterminate to determinant.
The Generalized Sediment Transport model for Alluvial River Simulation (GSTARS)
computer model series have been used by engineers and geologists around the world for
solving river engineering and reservoir sedimentation problems based on unit stream power
and minimum stream power theories. The use of stream tube concept allows the GSTARS
models solving river engineering and reservoir sedimentation problems with a semi-two-
dimensional hydraulic computation and a semi-three-dimensional solution for river and
reservoir studies along each stream tube. Examples of application of GSTARS will be used
to illustrate the applicability of the computer model for solving a wide range of river
engineering and reservoir sedimentation problems.
2. SEDIMENT TRANSPORT
2.1. Basic Approaches
Sediment transport is a subject of interest to river engineers for centuries. More than
100 sediment transport formulas have been published in the literature. Most of the formulas
assumed that sediment transport rate or concentration can be determined by a dominant
parameter, such as water discharge, average ﬂow velocity, water surface or energy slope,
shear stress, stream power, or unit stream power. Yang [1–6] made detailed evaluation of the
validity of these assumptions.

C.T. Yang

The basic assumption in a deterministic approach is the existence of one-to-one relation-
ship between independent and dependent variables. Conventional dominant independent
variables used in sediment transport studies are water discharge, average ﬂow velocity,
shear stress, and energy or water surface slope. More recently, the use of stream power and
unit stream power has gained increasing acceptance as important parameters for the determi-
nation of sediment transport rate or concentration. Other independent parameters used in
sediment transport functions are sediment particle diameter or sediment fall velocity, water
temperature, or kinematic viscosity. The accuracy of a deterministic sediment transport
formula depends on the generality and validity of the assumption of whether a unique
relationship between dependent and independent variables exists. Deterministic sediment
transport formulas can be expressed by one of the following forms:

where qs ¼ sediment discharge per unit width of channel, Q ¼ water discharge, V ¼ average
ﬂow velocity, S ¼ energy or water surface slope, τ ¼ shear stress, τV ¼ stream power per
unit bed area, VS ¼ unit stream power or rate of potential energy expenditure per unit weight
of water, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6 ¼ parameters related to ﬂow and
sediment conditions, and c ¼ subscript denoting the critical condition at incipient motion.
Yang [1, 2] used laboratory data collected by Guy et al. [7] from a laboratory ﬂume with
0.93 mm sand, as shown in Fig. 6.1, as an example to examine the validity of these assumptions.
Figure 6.1 shows comparison among six parameters to determine which one has the best
one-to-one correlation between sediment discharge and the suggested dominant parameters.
Figure 6.1a shows that dual relationship exists between sediment discharge and water
discharge. Figure 6.1b shows that a good part of the cure between sediment discharge and
velocity can be approximated by a vertical line. This means that there is no strong correlation
between sediment discharge and average ﬂow velocity for a good portion of the data
compared. Figure 6.1c shows that a sediment discharge can be obtained at two different
water surface or energy slopes. Figure 6.1d shows that the relationship between sediment
discharge and shear stress can be approximated by two vertical lines with a transition between

the two vertical lines. Figure 6.1e shows that the relationship between sediment discharge and
stream power is better than other parameters just mentioned except two points. Figure 6.1f
shows that the correlation between sediment discharge and unit stream power is the strongest
one among all dominant parameters compared. Figure 6.2 shows that the strong correlation
between sediment concentration and unit stream power exists in spite of channel pattern
change from a straight to meandering and to a braided channel.
Some engineers believe that sediment transport rate or concentration can be determined by
the combined use of relative depth, Froude number, and bed form. Figure 6.3 shows an
example of the attempt to develop this type of equation [8, 9]. Figure 6.3 shows a family of
curves without any well-deﬁned pattern among relative depth, Froude number, and bed
form. When the same data are used in Fig. 6.4, there is a near-perfect correlation between
dimensionless unit stream power and sediment concentration regardless of the existence of
different ﬂow regimes and bed forms. The superiority of using dimensionless unit stream
power over other parameters for the determination of sediment concentration is apparent.
2.2. Unit Stream Power Formulas for Rivers and Reservoirs
Sediment transport mainly occurs in turbulent ﬂows. Yang and Molins [11] made detailed
step-by-step derivations of the relationship between sediment concentration and unit stream
power from the basic theories in turbulent ﬂows. They have shown that bed load, suspended
load, and total bed-material load of sediment can all be determined by unit stream power from
theoretical point of view. Their theoretical results have been conﬁrmed by laboratory data.
A summary of the theoretical derivation of the unit stream power formula is given below.
The rate of energy per unit weight of water available for transporting water and sediment in an
open channel with reach length x and total drop of Y is

where V ¼ average ﬂow velocity and S ¼ energy or water surface slope.
Yang [1] deﬁned unit stream power as the velocity-slope product shown in (6.7). The rate
of work being done by a unit weight of water in transporting sediment must be directly related
to the rate of work available to a unit weight of water. Thus, total sediment concentration or
total bed-material load must be directly related to unit stream power. While Bagnold [12]
emphasized the power applies to a unit bed area, Yang [1, 2] emphasized the power available
per unit weight of water to transport sediments.
To determine total sediment concentration, Yang [2] considered a relation among relevant
variables of the form:
Φ Ct; VS; U; υ; ω; d
ð
Þ ¼ 0
ð6:8Þ
where Ct ¼ total sediment concentration, with wash load excluded (in ppm by weight),
VS ¼ unit stream power, U* ¼ shear velocity, υ ¼ kinematic viscosity, ω ¼ fall velocity
of sediment, and d ¼ median particle diameter.
Using Buckingham’s π theorem and the analysis of laboratory data, Ct in (6.8) can be
expressed in the following dimensionless form:
logCt ¼ I þ Jlog VS

ð6:9Þ
where VcrS/ω ¼ critical dimensionless unit stream power at incipient motion.

istics, that is,
I ¼ a1 þ a2log ωd

J ¼ b1 þ b2log ωd

where a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3 ¼ coefﬁcients.
Yang [2] used 463 sets of laboratory data for the determination of coefﬁcients in
(6.10) and (6.11).
Yang and Molinas [11] made step-by-step derivations to show that sediment concentration
is directly related to unit stream power, based on basic theories in ﬂuid mechanics and
turbulence. They also showed that the vertical sediment concentration distribution is directly
related to the vertical distribution of turbulence energy production rate, that is,

It can be shown that the basic equation shown in (6.9) can be obtained by the integration of
sediment concentration shown in (6.12) (Fig. 6.5).

kinematic viscosity of water.
It should be noted that every term in the above equations is dimensionless and can be
applied to laboratory ﬂumes and natural rivers without any scale problem.
Yang and Wan [14] made detailed and systematic evaluation of the accuracy of Yang’s
1973 formula using reliable laboratory and ﬁeld data independently collected by other
researchers. These studies indicate that the accuracy of Yang’s 1973 formula is not sensitive
to the variation of Froude number and sediment concentration, while other formulas cannot be
applied to super critical ﬂows with accuracy.
A recent study on sediment transport using ANN technique [15] showed that Yang’s 1973
unit stream power formula for sediment transport [2] is more accurate than other commonly
used formulas based on 24 sets of river data collected in the United States. The US Department
of Agriculture National Sedimentation Laboratory [16] made detailed comparisons of the
accuracy of commonly used sediment transport formulas with laboratory and ﬁeld data. Alonso
[16] concluded that Yang’s 1973 sand transport formula is the most accurate one. The ASCE
Sedimentation Committee [17] also concluded that Yang’s 1973 formula can provide the “best
overall predictions” for sediment transport in laboratory ﬂumes and natural rivers. The ASCE
conclusions are shown in Table 6.1. Mengis of the US Geological Survey [18] and the German
Association for Water Resources and Land Improvement [19] made independent comparisons
of the accuracy of sediment transport formulas and reached similar conclusions.

Direct comparisons between measured and computed results from different sediment
transport equations indicate that, on the average, Yang’s 1973 dimensionless unit stream
power equation [2] is more accurate than others for sediment transport in the sand-size range.
Figure 6.6 shows a summary comparison between measured and computed bed-material
discharges from rivers.
Most sediment transport formulas do not consider the impact of wash load in rivers. Yang
et al. [22] developed the following unit stream power formula for the Yellow River with
hyper-concentrated sediment, including wash load:

kinematic viscosity of water and sediment mixture with wish-load, and γm, γs ¼ speciﬁc weight
of water and sediment mixture with wash load and speciﬁc weight of sediment, respectively.
It should be noted that all the coefﬁcients in (6.16) and (6.18) are identical to each other.
However, Yang et al. [22] changed the physical meaning of each parameter from sediment
transport in clear water in (6.16) to that in hyper-concentrated ﬂows with high concentration
of wash load in (6.18). The consistent pattern of all the dimensionless unit stream power
formulas is an indication of the robustness of the unit stream power theory and its applicability
to a wide range of ﬂow and sediment conditions.

2.3. Unit Stream Power Formula for Surface Erosion
Shih and Yang [23] proposed the following unit stream power formulas for surface erosion.
According to the unit stream power theory, unit stream power U ¼ VS is the most signif-
icant and dominant variable for erosion and sediment transport. The relationship between
sediment concentration due to surface erosion and unit stream power can be expressed as

increases linearly with increasing value of N. Hence, M and N can be expressed as

ð6:20Þ
N ¼ n1  S þ n2  V þ n3  Fr þ n4
ð6:21Þ
where mi and ni ¼ coefﬁcients and Fr ¼ Froude number.

Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine coefﬁcients M and N of the proposed
soil erosion formulas. The regression equations obtained by using surface ﬂow data excluding
those with rainfall data are
M ¼ 0:654  S  3:848  V þ 0:227  Fr þ 2:657
ð6:22Þ
N ¼ 1:692  S  1:170  V þ 0:071  Fr þ 1:532
ð6:23Þ
with a R2 ¼ 0.91 for sediment data excluding those with rainfall data and a R2 ¼ 0.88 for all
158 data sets used in this study. Flow velocity V is in m/s. The comparison between computed
values and observed data is shown in Fig. 6.7.
Rainfall events can complicate the relationship between surface erosion rate and unit
stream power. In Fig. 6.7, the comparison shows under estimations when the observed
concentration of simulation rainfall events is less than about 260,000 mgl. It is resulted
from the raindrop erosion enhancement. This shows a need to modify (6.19) to consider the
impact due to raindrops. Guy and Dickinson [25] and Julien and Simons [26] suggested to add
a rainfall enhancement term in the overland ﬂow erosion equation. An erosion enhancement
term l is used in this study to represent the rainfall impact on overland ﬂow erosion. The
regression equation is expressed as

Figures 6.7 and 6.8 show good agreements between computed and observed sediment

enhancement term l can represent the rainfall impact of overland ﬂow erosion very well.

where E ¼ thermal energy per unit mass and T ¼ absolute temperature used to measure the
variation of E. For a river system, the only available energy is potential energy per unit mass
of water H, and elevation Z is used to measure the variation of potential energy.
The entropy for a river system can then be deﬁned as
ψ ¼
ð dH
Z
ð6:29Þ
where H ¼ potential energy per unit mass of water in a river system and Z ¼ elevation. Both
T and Z are positive.
According to Prigogine [27], during the evolution toward a stationary state, the rate of
production of entropy per unit mass should be a minimum compatible with external con-
straints. Yang [28] has shown that this should lead to the conclusion that the potential energy
dissipation rate per unit mass or weight of water in a river system should be a minimum. The
minimum value depends on the constraints applied to the system.
Once the analogy between a thermo system and a river system is established, all thermo-
dynamic laws and theories can be applied directly to river systems without further derivation
and modiﬁcation. Yang [28] used this analogy to obtain the law of least rate of energy
expenditure, or the theory of minimum energy dissipation rate as more commonly referred
in the literature later.
The theory of minimum energy dissipation rate can also be derived from mathematical
argument without the use of thermodynamic laws and theories under equilibrium conditions.
For a reach of open channel or pipe, the only way to maintain an equilibrium condition is to
maintain a constant head between two end stations of the study reach. One can envision that
this condition can be reached if the study reach or pipe is connected with two reservoirs of
inﬁnite volumes such the ﬂow between the reservoirs will not change the head difference. In
other words, a seemly open system of open channel or pipe with inﬂow and outﬂow can be
approximated by a closed system including two large reservoirs with an open channel or pipe
connecting them to maintain a state of steady ﬂow under equilibrium condition.
Yang and Song [29] and Yang [30] used the following mathematical arguments to derivate
the theory of minimum energy and minimum energy dissipation rate theories.
For a closed dynamic system, energy will be dissipated during the process of evolution to
the ﬁnal state of static equilibrium. For a dissipative system, its energy E must decrease with
respective to time, i.e.,
dE
dt < 0
ð6:30Þ
When the system reaches its stable static equilibrium condition, the energy must be at its
minimum value subject to the constraint applied to the system. This is called the theory of
minimum energy. Let the energy dissipation rate P be deﬁned as
P ¼  dE
dt > 0
ð6:31Þ
352
C.T. Yang

Because static equilibrium is a state of minimum energy, a dynamic state that is not too far
from the static state should have
dP
dt ¼  d2E
dt2  0
ð6:32Þ
Equation (6.32) states that during the evaluation process of a dynamic system, its energy
dissipation rate should decrease with respective to time. When the system reaches its dynamic
equilibrium condition, its energy dissipation rate must be at a minimum value. The minimum
value depends on the constraints applied to the system. This is the theory of minimum energy
dissipation rate. Conventional ﬂuid mechanics using Newton’s equation of motion to solve a
system of equations based on a set of initial and boundary conditions. This approach is
effective and appropriate if the boundary conditions are constant and will not change with
respective to time. For river morphology and river engineering studies, the boundary condi-
tion varies with ﬂow and sediment conditions and should not be treated as constant. The
boundary conditions are the answers river engineers try to obtain. Consequently, it is not
appropriate to assume that the boundary conditions would not change.
The classical mechanics of the variational principle is based on the use of energy or energy
dissipation rate. The mathematical tools are the objective and constraint functions. This
approach, which is independent of the use of Newton’s law of motion, can give river
engineers the needed additional independent equation to change indeterminate hydraulics to
determinate hydraulics. This approach was used by Yang and Song [29] and Yang [30] to
solve a wide range of ﬂuid mechanics and river engineering problems. Yang [31, 32] also used
the theory of minimum energy dissipation rate to explain the basic reason of river meander
and the formation of rifﬂes and pools.
4. GENERALIZED SEDIMENT TRANSPORT MODEL FOR ALLUVIAL
RIVER SIMULATION (GSTARS)
GSTARS is a series of computer models developed by the US Bureau of Reclamation for
alluvial river and reservoir sedimentation studies. The original GSTARS was released in 1986
[33], and GSTARS2.0 and GSTARS2.1 were released in 1998 [34] and 2000 [35], respec-
tively. The most widely used version is GSTARS3 [36], and the most recent version is
GSTARS4 [37] for steady and unsteady ﬂow simulations. Common to all GSTARS models
is the use of stream tube concept as shown in Fig. 6.9. The total water discharge is divided
equally among stream tubes based on equal conveyance. By doing so, semi-two-dimensional
ﬂow problems can be solved with one-dimensional equations along each stream tube. The
change of channel geometry and longitudinal proﬁle is governed by the use of minimum
stream power theory. The change of channel width and depth at each time step of computation
depends on whether width or depth change can produce less stream power in accordance with
the theory of minimum stream power.

in a cross section is much smaller than the change of river bed, and if the parameters in the

are given in the GSTARS3 User’s Manual [36], and the papers by Yang and Ahn [37],
Yang and Simo˜es [38] and Simo˜es and Yang [39].
5. RIVER MORPHOLOGY AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING
River morphological changes of channel cross sections, longitudinal proﬁles, and patterns
have been studied by river morphologists and river engineers for centuries. River morpholo-
gists emphasize their studies on long-term dynamic adjustments of a long river reach. River
engineers emphasize their studies on a short river reach for a relatively short duration. The
interaction and exchange of ideas between river morphologists and river engineers are less than
desirable. It is highly desirable for them to work together and learn from each other. Due to the
differences of assumptions and approaches used by river morphologists and river engineers,
different and often conﬂicting results can be obtained. There is a need to have some common
theories and equations applicable to both disciplines. In view of the theoretical strength
and wide range of applications, the theory of minimum energy dissipation rate, or its simpliﬁed
minimum unit stream power or minimum stream power theory, can be a powerful and
independent tool for solving complicated river morphology and river engineering problems.
River Sediment Transport and Morphology
355

Some commonly observed phenomena in nature will be used to illustrate the application of
these theories.
River meandering and the formation of rifﬂes and pools are two commonly observed
phenomena in nature. Different hypotheses and theories have been used to explain these
phenomena. They include, but are not limited to, the rotation of the earth, maximization or
minimization of energy loss, local disturbances, and bank erosion. A detailed and systematic
review [31, 32] concluded that none of the above theories and hypotheses can explain the
basic reason for river meandering and the formation of the pool and rifﬂe sequence. The only
consistent reason for river meandering and formation of the pool and rifﬂe sequence is to
reduce a river’s energy dissipation rate in accordance with the theory of minimum energy
dissipation rate. Laboratory data by Friedkin [40] and ﬁeld data by Leopold and Wolman [41]
also conﬁrmed that river meandering and the formation of rifﬂes and pools are two sides of the
same coin to reduce a river’s energy dissipation rate.
As the water discharge increases in the downstream direction in a river system, the
longitudinal slope actually decreases. For a water distribution system, water discharge
decreases in the downstream direction, and the longitudinal or energy slope must increase.
This seemly paradox observation can be explained by the use of minimum stream power
theory expressed by the following equation:
d QS
ð
Þ
dx
¼ S dQ
dx þ Q dS
dx ¼ 0
ð6:40Þ
For a river system, dQ/dx is positive and dS/dx must be negative, and the longitudinal river
bed proﬁle is concave. For an irrigation or pipe water distribution system, dQ/dx is negative;
the energy gradient dS/dx must be positive so water can be delivered to the end of the
distribution system in accordance with (6.40). According to the Manning’s formula, an
increase of water discharge should have an increase of energy slope. This is due to the fact
that the use of Manning’s formula assumes that the roughness coefﬁcient is a constant
applicable to a very short reach of river. For a river system of a long reach, sediment size
and Manning’s roughness usually decrease in the downstream direction. Consequently,
Manning’s formula cannot be applied to a river system unless the variation of roughness is
given along the course of ﬂow.
River engineers have the temptation to shorten the length of a meandering reach with
cutoffs to straighten its course. This type of engineering action may reduce the navigation
distance and time between two stations and reduce the ﬂood stage for a give discharge for a
short duration. However, this action is against the theory of minimum energy dissipation rate
and often causing undesirable long-term results.
The US Army Corps of Engineers has made many cutoffs of the Lower Mississippi River to
shorten the navigation time and distance as shown in Fig. 6.10. The 1933 Greenville Reach of
the Mississippi River was a stable meandering reach with well-deﬁned location of rifﬂes or
crossings. After the cutoffs were completed, the river became highly unstable. Numerous
dikes and levees were constructed along the straightened reach to control the lateral move-
ment of the river. Long-term observations of the behavior of the river indicate that the water
356
C.T. Yang

stage for a given ﬂood is actually higher after some initial drop of water stage immediately
after the cutoffs. The theory of minimum energy dissipation rate states that a river will adjust
itself to minimize its energy dissipation rate or energy slope. The minimum value depends on
the constraints applied to the river. One important constraint is water discharge or its
associate water stage. Higher water discharge or higher water stage should be associated
with higher energy slope. Figure 6.11 shows that the relationship between water stage and
energy slope of meandering reaches follows the theory of minimum energy dissipation rate,
while straight reaches do not follow the theory. Figure 6.12 shows the relationship between

energy slope and water stage of the Kentucky Bend-Mayersville Reach. The 1966–1969
relationship was obtained right after the cutoffs, which is against the theory of minimum
energy dissipation rate. After the cutoffs, the US Army Corps of Engineers recognized that
the Lower Mississippi River became highly unstable and restored some of the meandering
reaches.
The
1975–1977
relationship
obtained
after
the
meandering
pattern
was
reestablished; the relationship between energy slope and water stage became consistent
with the theory of minimum energy dissipation rate and the reach became stable again.
River engineers should learn from this historical lesson to work with a river, not against a
river, in accordance with the theory of minimum energy dissipation rate. Yang [42] provided
more detailed explanations of the dynamic adjustment of rivers according to the theory of
minimum energy dissipation rate.
A meandering river has well-deﬁned thalweg connecting pools with a crossing between the
two. This type of river has a well-deﬁned course for navigation and requires minimum amount
of dredging. Once a meandering river is straightened, there is no well-deﬁned thalweg.
Irregularly distributed and shifting sand bars are formed due to the deposit of sediment
after a ﬂood. This can create navigation problems and causes higher river roughness and
higher water stage for a given water discharge.
6. HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING CASE STUDIES USING GSTARS
The following case studies are used to illustrate the application of GSTARS computer
models to hydraulic engineering.
6.1. Mississippi River Lock and Dam No. 26 Replacement Project
At the request of the US Army Corps of Engineers, GSTARS [33] was applied to simulate
and predict local scour at the Mississippi River Lock and Dam No. 26 Replacement Project
site near St. Louis, Missouri. Study results were published by Yang et al. [43]. Figure 6.13 is
an aerial view of the coffer dam at the construction site. The measured scour pattern is
shown in Fig. 6.14a. Because GSTARS cannot be used for the prediction of local scour due
to secondary current, the project site was simpliﬁed by cutting off the area of secondary
current as shown in Fig. 6.14b. Yang’s 1973 sand and 1984 gravel transport formulas were
used in the study.
In spite of this simpliﬁcation, the predicted scour pattern shown in Fig. 6.14b is very close
to the measure pattern shown in Fig. 6.14a. On the average, the predicted scour depths are
within 1 ft from the measurements. Figure 6.15 shows the three-dimensional plots of
the predicted channel geometry changes at 4, 36, and 72 days of simulation using only
three stream tubes. The ability for GSTARS to simulate and predict detailed channel geom-
etry changes is due to the fact that each stream tube can adjust its width, depth, and location
during the simulation process. In most cases, three tubes are adequate for river engineering
purpose. It should be noted that the minimization option was not applied in this study because
the width was ﬁxed by levee and cofferdam at the construction site.

6.2. Lake Mescalero Unlined Emergency Spillway
The US Bureau of Reclamation gave the University of Minnesota a contract to indepen-
dently test the ability of using GSTARS [33] to predict river morphological changes of an
alluvial channel based on the application of minimum stream power theory. During the
period of December 20 to 31, 1984, ﬂoodwater passed the concrete spillway crest of Lake
Mescalero in New Mexico and eroded the downstream unlined spillway as shown in
Fig. 6.16a. The spillway ﬂood hydrograph for the December 1984 ﬂood, shown in
Fig. 6.16b, and some cross-sectional surveys made prior to the ﬂood were given to the
University of Minnesota. In order to estimate the roughness and angle of repose of channel
bank materials, the contractor was allowed to take a ﬁeld trip and collect some bed-material
samples and measured the angle of repose of materials on the channel bank after the ﬂood.
The bed-material size varies from 0.06 mm to 20 mm with a mean size of 2.5 mm. An average
value of Manning’s roughness coefﬁcient of 0.06 was used for hydraulic routing. Yang’s 1973
formula for sand and 1984 formula for gravel transport were used for sediment routing.

tion site near St. Louis, Missouri.

The study result was ﬁrst published by Song et al. [44]. GSTARS 2.0, 2.1, and 3 were later
used to retest the predicted results.
Figure 6.17 shows the initial and measured cross sections after the ﬂood at Station 0 + 60
along the emergency spillway. The predicted results using GSTARS3 [36] with and without
using the stream power minimization are also shown in Fig. 6.17. It is apparent that the
result obtained by using the minimization option more realistically predicts channel

width and depth adjustments. Three stream tubes, Yang’s 1973 sand transport and 1984
gravel transport formulas, and a Manning’s roughness coefﬁcient of 0.06 were used by
Song et al. [44]. Same input data and formulas were also used in the GSTARS3 study
with the same results.
6.3. Tarbela Reservoir Sedimentation Study
Tarbela Dam and Reservoir is located in northern Pakistan along the Indus River. The
reservoir’s storage capacity has been continuously depleted since the dam has been built in
1974, with an annual inﬂow rate of 265 million tons of sediment. GSTARS3 was used by
Yang and Simo˜es [36] to simulate 22 years of reservoir sedimentation (from 1974 to 1996) for
a reach that spans nearly 58 miles upstream from the dam as shown in Fig. 6.18. The
hydrology and dam operation records for the Tarbela Reservoir in the period of 1974 and
1996 are shown in Fig. 6.19.

Sediments in the Tarbela Reservoir are mainly sand and silt, and Yang’s 1973 formula
and Han’s 1980 nonequilibrium transport function [45] were used in the simulation.
Only one stream tube was used without using the minimization option because the
emphasis of the study was to simulate the longitudinal proﬁle of the delta along the
thalweg, especially the location of the front set of the delta and its slope. Figure 6.20
shows that the simulated delta longitudinal proﬁle agrees with the 1996 survey result very
well, especially the front set of the delta. GSTARS3’s ability to simulate and predict
the reservoir delta formation process can be used to determine a reservoir’s loss of
capacity, the useful life of a reservoir, and the impact that dam operations have on the
reservoir’s deposition pattern.

6.4. Channel Degradation Downstream of the Mosul Dam in Iraq and Sediment
Deposition in the Upper Rhone River in Switzerland
Othman and Wang [46] applied GSTARS 2.1 [35] to simulate the degradation and
armoring processes of the Tigris River below the Mosul Dam in Iraq. Yang’s 1973 sand [2]
and 1984 gravel [4] formulas and Han’s 1980 nonequilibrium sediment transport function
[45] were used in the simulation. Four stream tubes were used, and stream power minimiza-
tion option was activated. Figure 6.21 shows that calculated scour depths agree with measured

results from three stations along the Tigris River very well. Figure 6.22 shows that the
calculated sediment grain size distributions obtained from GSTARS 2.1 agree with the
observations along the Tigris River very well.
GSTARS 2.0 [34] was applied by Cellino and Essyad [47] for the development of possible
engineering solutions to reduce sediment deposition in the Dranse River, which is a tributary
of the Upper Rhone River, near Martigny, Switzerland, after the October 10, 2000 ﬂood.
GSTARS 2.0 was ﬁrst used for the analysis of ﬂood. The same model was then used to test
several solutions focusing the attention on the erosion and deposition induced by the ﬂood.
The GSTARS 2.0 simulation results were used to guide physical model investigation.
Physical model of the study reach was constructed at the Polytechnique School of Lausanne
in Switzerland to test different engineering solutions.
The bed materials in the study reach are mainly gravels with nominal diameters between
149.7 mm and 349.9 mm. The computed and measured depth-averaged depositions at the
Bathiaz Bridge site are both 7 cm. The numerical computation was performed by using only
two stream tubes because of the simpliﬁed channel shape.
GSTARS 2.1 was more recently applied by Banchuen et al. [48] to simulate and predict the
longitudinal and lateral morphological processes downstream of the Pa Sak Jolasid Dam in
Thailand. Laursen’s [49] formula was use in the simulation. The predicted results from using
GSTARS 2.1 are in good agreement with ﬁeld observations.
6.5. Bed Sorting and Armoring Downstream from a Dam
Ashida and Michiue [50] conducted laboratory experiments in a small laboratory channel
with 0.8 m in width and 20 m in length. Figure 6.23 illustrates the test condition for their
Run#1. Figure 6.24 shows the comparisons between the computed results from GSTARS3
and the measurements at the initial and ﬁnal stage of the tests. The computed bed degradation
agrees with the measurements very well.

6.6. Reservoir Delta Formation
Swamee [51] conducted laboratory tests for the development of reservoir delta. Fig-
ure 6.25a shows comparisons between measured and computer proﬁles from GSTARS3
with three different values of roughness coefﬁcient. Figure 6.25b shows that predicted delta
development agrees with laboratory test results very well. The minor local differences
between the computed and measured results shown in Fig. 6.25b are due to the presence of
the movement of dune bed forms in the laboratory ﬂume.

Abstract Geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) concepts and
technologies are used extensively in modern water resources engineering planning, design,
and operations practice and are changing the way these activities are accomplished. GIS has
become an increasingly important means for understanding and dealing with the pressing
problems of water and related resources management in our world. GIS concepts and
technologies help us collect and organize the data about such problems and understand
their spatial relationships. GIS analysis capabilities provide ways for modeling and synthe-
sizing information that contribute to supporting decisions for resource management across a
large range of scales, from local to global. And GIS provides a means for visualizing resource
characteristics and thereby enhancing understanding in support of decision-making. This
chapter introduces GIS and RS and their application to water resources systems. A general
overview of GIS is presented which is followed by summary review of GIS applications for
modern water resources engineering.

1. INTRODUCTION
Information about water resources and the environment is inherently geographic. Maps,
whether on paper or in digital GIS formats, continue to be the medium for expression of
engineering plans and designs. We are concerned about the spatial distribution and character
of the land and its waters. Weather patterns, rainfall and other precipitation, and resultant
water runoff are primary driving forces for land development, water supplies, and environ-
mental impacts and pollution. Our water resources systems are comprised of dams and
reservoirs, irrigated lands and canals, water supply collection and distribution systems, sewers
and stormwater systems, and ﬂoodplains. These systems are tailored in response to a complex
mix of topography and drainage patterns, population and land use, sources of water, and
related environmental factors.
A geographic information system (GIS) presents information in the form of maps and
feature symbols and is integrated with databases containing attribute data on the features. A
GIS is a computer-based information system that supports capture, manipulation, retrieval,
modeling, analysis, and presentation of spatial data. This is a standard deﬁnition that does not
highlight the uses of GIS as an integrator of data management operations and decision support
in an organization. Looking at a GIS map gives knowledge of where things are, what they are,
and how they are related. A GIS can also provide tabular reports on the map features, create a
list of all things connected in a network, and support simulations of river ﬂows, travel time, or
dispersal of pollutants. A more expansive view is that the purpose of a GIS is to provide a
framework to support decisions for the intelligent use of earth’s resources and to manage the
built and natural environment. Purposes and concepts of GIS are a key to the understanding
and successful application of this technology.
A GIS provides an integrating data and modeling environment for the conduct of these
activities. A GIS provides a means to collect and archive data on the environment. Measure-
ments of location, distance, and ﬂow by various devices are typically handled in digital
formats and quickly integrated into a spatial database. Data processing, synthesis, and
modeling activities can draw on these data using the GIS, and analysis results can be archived
as well. The GIS spatial and attribute database can then be used to generate reports and maps,
often interactively, to support decision-making on which alternatives are best and the impacts
of these. Further, maps are a powerful communication medium; thus, this information can be
presented in public forums so that citizens concerned with planning and design choices can
better understand and be more involved.
Planning and design in water resources engineering typically involve the use of maps at
various scales and the development of documents in map formats. For example, in a river
basin study, the map scale often covers a portion of a state and includes several counties and
other jurisdictions. The river drains a certain geography having topographic, geologic and
soil, vegetation, and hydrological characteristics. Cities and human-built facilities are located
along the river and across the basin, and transportation and pipeline networks link these
together. It is required that all of these datasets be established in a common geo-reference
framework so that overlays of themes can be made and the coincidence of features identiﬁed
in the planning and design phase.
GIS and Remote Sensing
377

A GIS is applied to manage all of these data. It provides a comprehensive means for
handling the data that could not be accomplished manually. The large amount of data
involved requires a GIS—there may be many thousands of features having a location,
associated attributes, and relationships with other features. The GIS provides a means to
capture and archive these data and to browse and review the data in color-coded map formats.
This data review capability supports quality control as errors can be more readily identiﬁed.
Also, through visualization, the user can gain a better understanding of patterns and trends in
the data in a manner not possible if the data were only in tabular format. The GIS provides an
analysis capability as well; new information can be obtained by the wide variety of spatial
analysis functions and linked mathematical models. The database can be accessed by the
computer software and used as input to various modeling procedures to generate derived
products.
A comprehensive review of GIS for water resources engineering was presented by Johnson
[1]. That book addressed fundamental concepts of GIS database development and applica-
tions of GIS for surface and groundwater hydrology, ﬂood plains, water supply and waste-
water systems, water quality, and river basin decision support systems. This chapter presents a
summary review of GIS concepts and water resources engineering applications. It is intended
to inform the reader on the role that GIS plays in modern water resources engineering in
concert with the other topics presented in this book.
2. OVERVIEW OF GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AND REMOTE SENSING
2.1. GIS Basics
GIS concepts and technologies arise from a wide variety of ﬁelds, and GIS has become a
generic term referring to all automated systems used primarily for the management of maps
and geographic data. The development of GIS has relied on innovations made in many
disciplines: civil engineering, geography, photogrammetry, remote sensing, surveying, geod-
esy, statistics, computer science, operations research, demography, and many other branches
of engineering and the natural and social sciences. Indeed, an outstanding characteristic of
GIS is its interdisciplinary character in its development as a collection of tools as well as the
wide variety of applications.
GIS cartographic concepts originated with the maps created by early explorers and
extended by modern geographers to portray locations and characteristics of the earth’s
features. Engineering measurement theories and practices of surveyors and geodesists pro-
vided the means to describe property boundaries and locate features accurately. Civil engi-
neers have migrated to digital formats for land development plans which include parcel
boundaries as well as elements for water and sewer pipes, roads and streets, and other
infrastructure. Satellite and airborne remote sensing technologies have advanced to become
a primary data source for high-resolution mapping of land characteristics; these apply for base
mapping, in real time, and for assessing changes over time.

L.E. Johnson

It has become common to think of GIS databases as a collection of map layers that are
geographically referenced and registered to a common coordinate projection. Most GIS
organizes data by layers, each of which contains a theme of map information that is logically
related by its location (Fig. 7.1). Each of these separate thematic maps is referred to as a layer,
coverage, or feature dataset. And each layer has been precisely overlaid on the others so that
every location is matched to its corresponding locations on all the other maps. The geodetic
control layer of this diagram is quite important; it represents the coordinate location reference
system to which all the maps have been accurately registered. Once these maps have been
registered within a standardized reference system, information displayed on the different
layers can be compared and analyzed in combination.
2.2. GIS Data Development and Maintenance
Input or capture of data comes from a variety of sources. The data may be converted from
existing paper (or mylar) plans and records, as well as data residing in digital databases (e.g.,
property records). These conversions may involve tablet digitizing and scanning to images.
Over the past several decades, there has been a convergence of GIS with the technologies of
engineering measurement that record ﬁeld data in digital formats and can be ported directly
into a GIS spatial database (e.g., surveying total stations and global positioning systems
(GPS)). Data capture technologies include remote sensing by satellites and airborne platforms
(photogrammetry). Satellite imagery is received in various wavelengths so that particular
aspects of the land surface can be characterized through image processing procedures.
Imagery from airplane overﬂights is most often of the photographic type, particularly for
Fig. 7.1. Map layers address multiple themes.

development of high-resolution topographic maps of urban areas and identiﬁcation of urban
features such as building footprints, street centerlines, manholes, and water distribution
valves. Increasingly, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is being used to provide high-
resolution topographic mapping required for detailed site planning and ﬂoodplain hydraulic
studies. Regardless of the source, there is a requirement that spatial data be developed in some
coordinate reference system.
GIS functions for spatial data capture include the numerous technologies for data capture
as well as the many ways for conversion of source data into GIS compatible formats. These
functions include:
l
Tablet digitizing and scanning
l
Format conversion
l
Surveying and coordinate geometry (COGO)
l
Global positioning systems
l
Photogrammetric data development
l
Image processing
l
Geometric transformations and projection conversions
l
Attribute entry and editing
l
Metadata
2.3. Remote Sensing
Satellite remote sensing can provide various sources of data for water resources applica-
tions ranging from basic land use characteristics (and changes over time) to terrain and to
meteorological event tracking. Satellites using the visible and near-infrared regions of the
spectrum can provide detailed information of the land characteristics, and SPOT with its
stereo capability can even provide topographic information [2]. Side-Looking Airborne Radar
(SLAR) and satellite SLARs can produce vary detailed maps of basin characteristics, even in
traditionally cloudy areas and areas with heavy vegetation growth. Interferometric SLAR can
also provide quantitative measures of topography.
Image processing functions have been developed to extract information from satellite
imagery, although many of the procedures may be applied to other grid datasets as well.
Jensen [3] describes image processing functions and techniques in some detail. Image
classiﬁcation is accomplished using multispectral classiﬁcation methods that transform
raw reﬂectivity data into information on land cover classes. There are a variety of
classiﬁcation algorithms including (1) hard classiﬁcation using supervised or unsupervised
approaches, classiﬁcation using fuzzy logic, and/or (2) hybrid approaches using ancillary
(collateral) information. Supervised classiﬁcation involves a priori identiﬁcation and loca-
tion of land cover types, such as urban, agriculture, or wetland, through a combination of
ﬁeld work, aerial photography, and other mapping. Speciﬁc sites, called training sites,
having known spectral characteristics are located in the image and are used to train the
classiﬁcation algorithm for application to the remainder of the image. This is a hard
classiﬁcation scheme since each pixel is assigned to only one class. In unsupervised
classiﬁcation, the identities of land cover types are not known a priori, and training site
380

data are not collected or are unavailable. Figure 7.2 illustrates an example of image
classiﬁcation for wetland identiﬁcation.
2.4. GIS Data Models and Geodatabases
GIS databases incorporate two distinct branches: the spatial database and the associated
attribute database. Many GIS software maintain this distinction; the spatial data is character-
ized as having a “vector” structure comprised of features represented as points, lines, and
polygons. Other GIS spatial data are handled as images, or “rasters,” having simple row and
column formats. Figure 7.3 illustrates the difference between the raster and vector data
structures. Attribute data are handled in relational database software comprised of records
and ﬁelds, and the power of the relational model is applied for these data. These feature data
are “tagged” to the spatial database to facilitate tabular data retrievals.
Database management systems (DBMS) are computer programs for storing and managing
large amounts of data. Required functions of a DBMS include (1) consistency with little or no
redundancy, (2) maintenance of data quality including updating, (3) self-descriptive with
metadata, (4) a database language for query retrievals and report generation, (5) security
including access control, and (6) shareable between users. Most DBMS are designed to handle
attribute data. A special characteristic of a geodatabase is the join between spatial and
attribute data for water resources system features.

identiﬁes wetland areas in mixed agricultural landscape [4].

2.5. GIS Analysis Functions
GIS analysis capabilities are speciﬁcally keyed to the spatial realm. An analysis function
unique to GIS is the overlay operation whereby multiple data themes can be overlain and the
incidence of line and polygon intersections are derived. This graphical and logical procedure
is used in many ways to identify the correspondence between multiple data layers. Other GIS
functions include networks and connectivity operations, terrain analyses, statistical interpo-
lation, and other neighborhood procedures, as well as functions for spatial database develop-
ment and maintenance.
The nature of the data representation has a strong inﬂuence on the analysis that can be
applied. Spatial data in GIS are most often organized into vector and raster (or surface) data
structures (Fig. 7.3). In the vector structure, geographic features or objects are represented by
points, lines, and polygons that are precisely positioned in a continuous map space, similar to
traditional hard copy maps that identify landmarks, buildings, roads, streams, water bodies,
and other features by points, lines, and shaded areas. In addition, each object in the vector
structure includes topologic information that describes its spatial relation to neighboring
objects, in particular its connectivity and adjacency. This explicit and unambiguous deﬁnition
of and linkage between objects makes vector structures attractive and allows for the auto-
mated analysis and interpretation of spatial data in GIS environments [5].
On the other hand, surface, or raster (from display technology), data structures divide space
into a two-dimensional grid of cells where each cell contains a value representing the attribute
being mapped. A raster is an x, y matrix of spatially ordered numbers. Each grid cell is
referenced by a row and column number with the boundary of the grid being registered in
space to known coordinates. Raster structures arise from imaging sources such as satellite
imagery and assume that the geographical space can be treated as though it was a ﬂat
Cartesian surface [6]. A point is represented by a single grid cell, a line by a string of
Fig. 7.3. Raster (grid) and vector data structures provide complementary means for representing
location and character of map features.
382
L.E. Johnson

connected cells and an area by a group of adjacent cells. When different attributes are
considered such as soil and land use, each is represented by separate raster layers. Operations
on multiple layers involve the retrieval and processing of the data from corresponding cell
positions in the different layers. This overlay concept is like stacking layers (two-dimensional
grids) and then analyzing each cell location [5]. The simplicity of data processing in raster
structures has contributed to its popularity. Both vector and raster structures are valid
representations of spatial data. The complementary characteristics of both structures have
long been recognized, and modern GIS can process both structures, including conversion
between structures and overlays of both structures.
GIS provides a rich suite of intrinsic functions that perform analyses using attributes of
spatial data. In many respects, these intrinsic functions provide unprecedented capabilities (i.
e., no historical manual equivalent) that are difﬁcult and time consuming if performed
manually. Terrain processing for watershed delineation is but one example of GIS functions
that can be conducted much easier and better than can be done manually. As will be shown in
subsequent chapters, the range and sophistication of spatial analyses applied to water
resources problems are extensive. Moreover, integration of conventional water resources
analysis procedures into the GIS sphere has extended the realm of GIS to include advanced
surface modeling, simulation, and optimization functions heretofore not often recognized by
GIS practitioners. Also, the water resources ﬁeld now includes a wide range of decision
support systems for planning and operations that involve a dominant spatial dimension; these
are called spatial decision support systems (SDSS).
The art and science of using a GIS entails combining the available analysis functions with
the appropriate data to generate the desired information. GIS practice therefore requires some
schema of design to ensure that the effort is focused on answering the appropriate questions.
Here, the GIS database, modeling, and visualization tools provide enhancements to the
traditional engineering design process. The GIS provides a powerful means to manage data,
conduct analyses, and communicate planning and design outcomes to the various “publics”
concerned with these outcomes. This communication dimension of GIS is particularly
important in environmental and water resources engineering because much of our work
concerns public resources having signiﬁcant impacts over extensive areas on a large number
of interest groups.
General categories of analysis functions include the following:
1.
Data capture and maintenance
2.
Geometrics and measurements
3.
Spatial and aspatial queries; classiﬁcations
4.
Neighborhood operations
5.
Spatial arrangement, connectivity functions, and networks

Automated extraction of watersheds or surface drainage, channel networks, drainage divides,
and other hydrographic features from DEMs is a standard surface processing routine in
modern GIS (Fig. 7.4). The eight-direction, or D-8, method is the most common approach
to identifying the direction of ﬂow from a grid cell. Using an iterative approach similar to the
spread and seek functions, the D-8 deﬁnes the drainage network from raster DEMs based on
an overland ﬂow analogue. The method identiﬁes the steepest downslope ﬂow path between
each cell of a raster DEM and its eight neighbors and deﬁnes this path as the only ﬂow path
leaving the raster cell. The method also accumulates the catchment area downslope along the
ﬂow paths connecting adjacent cells. The drainage network is identiﬁed by selecting a
threshold catchment area at the bottom of which a source channel originates and classifying
all cells with a greater catchment area as part of the drainage network. This drainage network
identiﬁcation approach is simple and directly generates connected networks.
2.6. User Interfaces and Interaction Modes
A primary attraction of modern GIS is the user-friendliness of the computer system
interface provided by the various software vendors. Efﬁcient retrieval of data depends not
only on properly structured data in the database and speed of retrieval but also on well-
designed interfaces and query languages. The human–computer interface provides the envi-
ronment that enhances human interaction with the GIS. It makes it easy for the user to access

384

data and analysis results and to display these data in understandable formats. Most traditional
information systems provide limited presentation formats, usually as text, tables, and graphs.
While these formats are still useful, the spatial character of geodata allows additional
possibilities, including map formats and visualization techniques.
To achieve usability, GIS software has progressed from command entry modes to menu
and forms modes to graphical user interfaces (GUI) [7]. A GUI enables a user to interact with
the computer system by pointing to pictorial representations (icons) and lists of menu items on
the screen using the mouse. Using the icons provides a means for the primary functionality of
data selection, data presentation, and data manipulation.
Visualization is an extension of the traditional data retrieval and display concepts. It
includes techniques that aid in the interpretation of spatial datasets. Since GIS is concerned
with analysis and interpretation, it is the graphics-based nature of GIS that allows perception
of spatial patterns and features of the information, extraction of parameters, and discrimina-
tion of classes of objects [8].
2.7. GIS System Planning and Implementation
Consideration of organizational factors is important to successful GIS implementation and
management because of the critical role that information plays in an organization’s role and
purpose. In most cases, the design and implementation of a GIS and is a long-term effort that
involves changes in the way an organization does its work. Experience has shown that, as
important as technical issues of software, hardware, and database design are, it is the people
problems arising from access to the information and its use that determine whether a GIS will
succeed or fail [9].
During the planning of a major GIS acquisition and/or development, it is important to
consider certain organizational attributes that will impact the chosen approach. These attri-
butes, generally addressed in a Needs Assessment, should be evaluated in the broadest
possible sense. In this way, the goals, equipment, costs, etc., of all impacted departments
will be included in the implementation planning. Only after careful consideration of these
attributes can the best possible implementation strategy be chosen. Some attributes to
consider:
l
Overall organization function and goals.
l
Sources of data available as input to the GIS system.
l
GIS hardware/software/databases and products that are currently and planned to be utilized.
l
Management approaches that will guide and have guided the GIS program to date.
l
Costs of implementation, both historic and planned.
l
Beneﬁts of implementation, both tangible and intangible.
l
Procedure to be used in evaluating and comparing the costs and beneﬁts.
l
Review generation procedures: internal, external, current, and potential.
l
Quality Assurance/Quality Control Procedures (QA/QC) and any applicable data standards.
l
End-user interactions and training consider how the GIS group will communicate with its “clients.”
l
Evaluation/assessment procedures to be used to review the GIS implementation.
l
Legal issues pertaining to data distribution and ownership.
GIS and Remote Sensing
385

Although it is difﬁcult to quantify many of these attributes, it is a useful exercise to at least
estimate the worth of each one. For instance, many organizations consider a formal cost/
beneﬁt analysis to be based on highly speculative information, although it is possible to
measure the relative “goodness” of intangible beneﬁts on a relative scale. Further, as these
types of organizational issues are discussed during planning, a broader and more realistic
picture of the resulting GIS implementation becomes available.

There are a large number of GIS software options which are available as open source or
commercial products. A large listing of GIS software can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/

3. GIS FOR SURFACE WATER HYDROLOGY
3.1. GIS Data for Surface Water Hydrology
The watershed runoff processes are inherently spatial in character so there is a strong
motivation to use GIS tools to organize the data and formulate hydrologic models. Surface
water hydrology is perhaps the area for which GIS has been most applied in the water
resources and environmental ﬁeld. The advent of digital data products and software for
processing spatial data has prompted a change in the way we look at hydrologic systems
and made it possible to more precisely describe watershed characteristics and runoff response
to precipitation inputs. There is a movement away from the so-called “lumped parameter”
models to more spatially distinct or “distributed” modeling approaches that represent funda-
mental physical processes.
The general availability of DEMs, TINs, DLGs, digital soil and land use data, radar-rainfall
and satellite imagery, real-time gage reporting, and the GIS software to process these has
contributed to an increased awareness of the spatial distribution of hydrologic processes. Most
surface water hydrologic applications begin with raster data of the terrain due to the wide
availability of DEMs and intrinsic GIS software functions to conduct digital terrain
processing. For highly detailed terrain mapping, such as required to deﬁne ﬂoodplain details,
there is increasingly wide use of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data.
Hydrographic vector data of surface water systems are also common and may have been
developed as features in the original map making process or derived from DEM processing.
A primary dataset on stream vectors is the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD; Fig. 7.5).
The NHD is designed to combine spatial accuracy with detailed features, attributes, and
values to provide information on ﬂow paths, permanent reach IDs, and hydrologic ordering
for use in modeling [10].
Soil data are available from the soil-mapping agencies, typically those dealing with the
agriculture sector. In the USA, soil survey data are available in digital formats from
the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), including the State Soil Geographic
(STATSGO) and Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) databases. The mapping scale for
386
L.E. Johnson

STATSGO map is 1:250,000 and was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps.
The SSURGO digitizing duplicates the original soil survey maps at mapping scales ranging
from 1:12,000 to 1:63,360. SSURGO is linked to the National Soil Information System
(NASIS) attribute database. The attribute database gives the proportionate extent of the
component soils and their properties for each map unit. Recent advances in remote sensing
technology have shown that soil moisture can be quantitatively estimated using microwave
technology under a variety of topographic and vegetation cover conditions. A summary
assessment of the state of the art of remote sensing of soil moisture was presented by the
National Research Council [11].
Land use and land cover information is used in hydrologic modeling to estimate surface
roughness or friction values since it affects the velocity of the overland ﬂow of water. Sources
of land use data include the USGS-EPA National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) which has
been developed with time stamps for 1992 and 2001 and is appropriate for most watersheds
modeling (Fig. 7.6). The most recent release includes an impervious surface coverage.
Interpretation of land use information from satellite imagery or aerial photography is another
means of obtaining land use and land cover data. The techniques of supervised and
unsupervised classiﬁcation of satellite imagery yield clusters of different spectral classes
that are assigned into different land use types. The same technique can be used with aerial
photos that are digitally scanned. Research by Ragan and Jackson [12] and Bondelid et al. [13]
has shown that the degree of urban land use or various categories of agriculture or forest can

be determined accurately through remote sensing and used as variables in urban runoff
models or the SCS runoff curve number method.
Precipitation and climate data of various types are routinely collected by the National
Weather Service, other agencies, and citizen volunteers at speciﬁc locations. The primary data
archive for climate and other meteorological data is the National Climatic Data Center
(NCDC). Land-based observations archived by the NCDC contain various meteorological
elements that over time describe the climate of a location or region. These elements include
temperature, dew point, relative humidity, precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, wind speed,
wind
direction,
cloudiness,
visibility,
atmospheric
pressure,
evaporation,
and
soil
temperatures.
Weather radars have become a primary source of rainfall data (Fig. 7.7). Weather radar
data are available from the National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Surveillance Radar
Doppler units (WSR-88D) throughout the USA. The WSR-88D radar transmits horizontal
pulses, which give a measure of the horizontal dimension of the cloud (cloud water and cloud
ice) and precipitation (snow, ice pellets, hail and rain particles). Over a 5- to 10-min period,
successive scans are made with 0.5 increments in elevation. The reﬂectivity observations
from these scans are integrated over time and space to yield estimates of particle size and
density in an atmospheric column over a particular location. To simplify data management,
display, and analysis, the NWS digitizes and reports reﬂectivity for cells in a Hydrologic
Rainfall Analysis Project (HRAP) grid. Cells of the grid are approximately 4 km by 4 km.
Fig. 7.6. National Land Cover Dataset is available nationwide and is widely used for watershed
modeling studies.

Satellite imagery can provide useful information on rainfall distribution over large areas
and inaccessible regions. However, direct measurement of rainfall from satellites for opera-
tional purposes has not been generally feasible because the presence of clouds prevents
direct observation of precipitation with visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared sensors.
The visible and infrared images from the polar-orbiting satellites, including the NOAA N
series and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, and geostationary satellites such as
GOES, GMS, and Meteosat provide information only about the cloud tops rather than cloud
bases or interiors. These satellites provide frequent observations (even at night with thermal
sensors), and the characteristics of potentially precipitating clouds and the rates of changes in
Fig. 7.7. Radar-rainfall data are being collected nationwide by the WSR-88D system. Image displays
example of 3-h rainfall accumulation product [14].
GIS and Remote Sensing

cloud area and shape can be observed. From these observations, estimates of rainfall can be
made which relate cloud characteristics to instantaneous rainfall rates and cumulative rainfall
over time. Improved analysis of rainfall can be achieved by combining satellite and conven-
tional gage data.
Snow is another hydrologic variable that has been successfully measured for large regions
using aerial and satellite remote sensors. Ground-based snow surveys are also routinely
collected at sites by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The National
Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) ingests daily ground-based,
airborne, and satellite snow observations from all available electronic sources for the coter-
minous USA. These data are used along with estimates of snowpack characteristics generated
by a physically based snow model to generate the operational, daily NOAA National Snow
Analyses (NSA) for the coterminous USA. Extent of snow cover can be determined with
satellite visible and near-infrared (VIS/NIR) data and can be observed in remote regions that
are generally inaccessible during the winter months.
3.2. GIS for Surface Water Hydrology Modeling
GIS analysis and database functions provide extensive means for developing surface water
hydrologic models datasets and modeling operations. A primary area of application is
processing of digital terrain data to derive landscape features pertinent to hydrology such
stream paths and drainage divides. GIS databases are created to help organize the multitude of
spatial and nonspatial attribute data needed for surface water hydrologic studies. Intrinsic GIS
surface and network analysis functions provide fundamental capabilities for deriving surface
water modeling products.
Digital representations of landscape topography as digital elevation models (DEM) or
digital terrain models (DTM) incorporate arrays of elevation values so that terrain features can
be evaluated using specialized numerical algorithms and GIS visualizations rendered. Land-
scape features such as slope, aspect, ﬂow length, contributing areas, drainage divides, and
channel network can be rapidly and reliably determined from DEMs even for large water-
sheds [15]. A concise review of digital terrain processing methods was presented in DeBarry
[16]. Automated extraction of surface drainage, channel networks, drainage divides, drainage
networks and associated topologic information, and other hydrography data from DEMs has
advanced considerably over the past decade and is now routinely a part of most GIS software
packages.
The common problem of obtaining rainfall data for the watershed of interest using point
rain gages is addressed using spatial interpolation procedures. Interpolation methods are
appropriate when an attribute measured at sample points is a spatially continuous ﬁeld
variable. Usually, the interpolation process involves estimating the rainfall values onto a
regular grid. Alternately, contours may be ﬁtted to the grid and the data represented as vector
objects with labels or as polygon objects having the contours as boundaries. The interpolated
surface may also be represented as a TIN. There are a wide variety of procedures for
interpolation and supporting literature (e.g., [17, 18]). For this discussion, ﬁve methods are
described: (1) nearest neighbor, (2) isohyetal, (3) triangulation, (4) distance weighting, and
390
L.E. Johnson

(5) kriging. A concern with interpolation with sparse network data is that different interpo-
lation methods may yield differing results; an independent veriﬁcation dataset is commonly
used to determine the best method.
GIS procedures for computing evaporation and evapotranspiration (ET) include interpola-
tion of the input meteorological data from weather stations to the location of interest. These
spatial interpolations may be accomplished in a manner similar to those used for rain gage
data. Computations may be accomplished using map algebra techniques for regular grid
structures across the landscape taking account of differences in temperature, precipitation,
elevation, soils, vegetative cover, and other variables as required.
Runoff is generated from excess precipitation that has not inﬁltrated or been stored on the
land surface. This direct runoff is translated from its location on the ground to the nearest
steam channel (overland ﬂow) of to the watershed outlet. The unit hydrograph is a well-
known, commonly used empirical model of the relationship of direct runoff to excess
precipitation [18]. Various versions of the UH have been developed, including (1) user-
speciﬁed UH and (2) Clark’s UH, Snyder’s UH, the SCS UH, and ModClark UH. These are
options incorporated into the HEC-HMS software package (Fig. 7.8; [18]). The Geospatial
Hydrologic Modeling Extension (HEC-GeoHMS; [19]) is a software package for use with the
ArcView® GIS. GeoHMS uses ArcView and Spatial Analyst to develop a number of hydro-
logic modeling inputs. Analyzing digital terrain information, HEC-GeoHMS transforms the
drainage paths and watershed boundaries into a hydrologic data structure that represents the
watershed response to precipitation. In addition to the hydrologic data structure, capabilities
include the development of grid-based data for linear quasi-distributed runoff transformation
Fig. 7.8. HEC-GeoHMS provides an integrated GIS work environment for watershed modeling.
GIS and Remote Sensing
391

(ModClark), the HEC-HMS basin model, physical watershed and stream characteristics, and a
background map ﬁle.
Flow routing through the channel network is accomplished using a variety of mathematical
representations of the fundamental equations of channel ﬂow hydraulics. For example, The
HEC-RAS system contains four one-dimensional river analysis components for (1) steady
ﬂow water surface proﬁle computations, (2) unsteady ﬂow simulation, (3) movable boundary
sediment transport computations, and (4) water quality analysis. A key element is that all four
components use a common geometric data representation and common geometric and
hydraulic computation routines [18]. Regardless of the channel routing method, GIS repre-
sentations of the network as a binary tree collection of reaches and junctions are central to
coordinating the logical sequencing of computations from an upstream to downstream
direction. The network database includes the topological relations to identify upstream and
downstream nodes and junction characteristics. Sometimes the indexing code generated by
the stream network derivation (e.g., Pfasseter code) is used to schedule the sequencing of
computations (Fig. 7.9).
Increasing availability of high-resolution DEMs and land surface data provides a foundation
for distributed models of the watershed. The ModClark time-area method mentioned above is an
example of a semi-distributed model. Also, a large basin may be represented as a collection of
sub-basins; the overall system representation can be considered distributed. For fully distributed

models, the excess precipitation amounts computed for various locations in the watershed,
usually on a grid structure, are routed overland and through channels to the basin outlet. The
distributed approach allows ﬂow predictions at many points internal to the watershed.
The NWS Research Modeling System (HL-RMS) is an example of a fully distributed
approach [21]. The HL-RMS has been developed to support proof of concept research
comparing distributed modeling approaches with the more traditional lumped models based
on the UH. Some of the main features of the current HL-RMS are:
l
Ingests gridded NEXRAD-based products.
l
Basic modeling unit is the NEXRAD grid cell (~4 km).
l
Rainfall-runoff calculations are done independently for each grid cell.
l
Runoff is routed over hillslopes within a model cell.
l
Channel routing is done from cell to cell.
l
Rainfall-runoff calculations can be done using lumped or distributed rainfall and lumped or
distributed parameters.
l
Uses the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC-SMA).
l
Uses the kinematic method for both hillslope and channel routing.
l
Writes output parameter, state, or forcing grids that can be displayed in ArcView GIS.
In HL-RMS, the impervious, surface, and direct runoff components are routed over
conceptual hillslopes within each NEXRAD cell to a conceptual channel. Because of the
relatively large size of the 4-km model cells, the cells are subdivided into conceptual
hillslopes to make overland ﬂow distances physically realistic. A drainage density param-
eter in the model is used to subdivide a cell into equally sized overland ﬂow planes. These
hillslopes drain to a conceptual channel segment within the same cell. Cell-to-cell channel
routing is done using ﬂow direction networks like that illustrated in Fig. 7.10. Three
parameters are deﬁned in each cell for kinematic overland ﬂow routing: hillslope slope,
hillslope roughness, and drainage density. Representative hillslope slopes are estimated
using DEM data (initially with 30-m DEM data for basin-scale applications and 400-m
DEM data for regional-scale applications) by ﬁrst computing the local slope of each DEM
cell in the study domain using the Arc/Info slope function and then averaging all of the
DEM cell slopes in each 4-km model cell. A kinematic routing scheme is applied for the
channels; parameters are based on stage-discharge, channel cross section, and other geo-
morphic data.
There are a number of surface water hydrologic models having integrated GIS interfaces
and databases. A large listing of hydrologic models can be found at the Hydrologic Modeling
Inventory Website (http://hydrologicmodels.tamu.edu/).
The National Weather Service has developed various methods for assessing the threat of
ﬂash ﬂoods for local forecast regions. The AMBER algorithm was developed at the Pittsburgh
NWS Forecast Ofﬁce in the early 1990s. The AMBER program provides the ﬁeld forecaster
direct guidance for issuance of ﬂash ﬂood warnings. AMBER directly links WSR-88D radar-
rainfall estimates with all deﬁned watersheds, down to a 2-square mile area (3 sq. km).
AMBER computes average basin rainfall (ABR) in each watershed for direct comparison
with ﬂash ﬂood guidance or other thresholds set by the forecasters. AMBER also computes
GIS and Remote Sensing
393

the “rate” or intensity of each watershed ABR every 5–6 min. Scan-to-scan accumulation
for all bins in a basin is summed using area of bin as weighting factor to compute ABR.
The database saves the ABR for each basin for each scan-to-scan accumulation time period.
Also, the ABR from scan-to-scan periods is summed to produce accumulation over longer
time periods.
Basin delineations for AMBER were derived nationwide using GIS terrain processing
procedures. A basin was deﬁned for each segment of a stream network, and basins were
deﬁned for various thresholds of basin scale including (1) headwaters (e.g., less than
50 square miles); (2) streams (less than 200 square miles); (3) rivers (greater than
200 square miles); (4) urban areas, any area known to be prone to ﬂooding; and (5) rain
gages (single bin over rain gage location for gage) and radar comparison. Figure 7.11
shows an example AMBER display. As implemented for ﬂash ﬂood monitoring, the
interface provides access to the various levels of basin scale. It can be difﬁcult to monitor
5,000–10,000 small basins so only those basins which exceed rainfall and rainfall thresh-
olds can be displayed. Also, a database on results for all basins can be sorted and the ABR,
FFG, Alert Status, and Basin Rate of Accumulation (BRA) output for each basin for each
Alert Time Period.

4. GIS FOR FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
4.1. Floodplain Mapping Requirements
Extensions of surface water hydrologic modeling apply to ﬂoodplain mapping and GIS
tools play an important role in accomplishing these activities. Given the regulatory authority
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), it is their standards that establish
primary mapping requirements for ﬂoodplains [22]. FEMA deﬁnes technical requirements,
product speciﬁcations for Flood Hazard Maps and related National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) products, and associated coordination and documentation activities.
Data required for ﬂoodplain mapping and management purposes are comprised of three
general categories: (1) ﬂoodplain and watershed topography data to support hydrologic and
hydraulic modeling, (2) physical data on built facilities for drainage control and buildings, and
(3) administrative data on jurisdiction boundaries. These data are developed from a variety of
sources using various GIS procedures and technologies and are ultimately collected into a
comprehensive dataset supportive to project needs and longer-term multiple purpose man-
agement purposes. GIS tools for ﬂoodplain map updates have become standard practice.
Floodplain maps and information prepared using traditional methods during the 1970s and
1980s are the basis for most current regulatory programs. Programs for map modernization
are progressing, and GIS standards are promulgated for these.

ABR in inches for the basin.
GIS and Remote Sensing

A study by the USGS for the Nisqually River near Puget Sound, Washington [23],
demonstrated the effectiveness of modern elevation data and GIS for updating ﬂood maps.
Existing ﬂoodplain maps were shown to have a number of shortcomings as follows: (1) based
on out-of-date ﬂood probability estimates, (2) hand drawn and difﬁcult to manage, (3) have
limited vertical accuracy, and (4) are expensive and time consuming to update. The GIS
approach was shown to be (1) relatively inexpensive (10–20 % of traditional methods),
(2) equally accurate and more detailed, (3) provided depth-of-ﬂood details, (4) able to identify
areas of uncertainty, and (5) digital, so analyses could be extended to other themes (e.g., roads
and buildings) in support of risk assessments. GIS was used to create and manipulate digital
elevation models representing the land surface and the ﬂood surface. Determining the
inundated area is a simple calculation: the ﬂood surface elevation model is subtracted from
the land surface elevation model at each location, resulting in negative values wherever the
ﬂood elevation is greater than the land elevation. A by-product of this calculation is ﬂood
depth which is important for damage and insurance assessments when intersected with
building ﬂoor elevations (Fig. 7.12).
4.2. Floodplain Geodatabase
Given the extensive and disparate data sources required for ﬂoodplain mapping, there is
a strong motivation to integrate the data into a comprehensive geodatabase. Doing so would
provide advantages that a geodatabase provides in terms of standardization, removal of

396
L.E. Johnson

redundancy, concurrency control, and transferability, to name a few. FEMA has
developed various data collection and reporting standards for ﬂoodplain studies as part of
their nationwide program of map modernization. The two principle documents relevant to
the design of a geodatabase for FEMA ﬂood hazard mapping are (1) Appendix L of the
Guidelines and Speciﬁcations for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners: Guidance for
Preparing Draft Digital Data and DFIRM Database [24] and (2) Appendix N of the
Guidelines and Speciﬁcations for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners: Data Capture Standards
(DCS) [22]. These standards specify the current GIS databases used for archiving
ﬂood hazard models and results. Figure 7.13 presents the DCS relationship diagram
for hydraulics.
4.3. Floodplain Hydraulic Modeling with GIS
The technical core of ﬂoodplain studies is the hydrologic and hydraulic modeling activities
that lead to delineation of the ﬂoodplain boundary. GIS has become central to the conduct of
such modeling studies, providing the means for integration of the various data involved,
coordinating the various models, and providing high-resolution maps required for supporting
ﬂood management strategies.
There are a number of ﬂoodplain hydrologic and hydraulic (H&H) modeling packages
that have been developed by the public and private sectors. H&H software varies in their
capabilities for representing ﬂoodplain hydraulics and the level of GIS integration. In the
1-D approach, water ﬂow is assumed to occur in one dominant spatial dimension aligned
with the center line of the main river channel. The geometry of the problem is represented
in the model by channel and ﬂoodplain cross sections perpendicular to the channel
centerline. Two-dimensional approaches solve for water level and depth-averaged veloci-
ties in two spatial dimensions using ﬁnite difference, ﬁnite element, or ﬁnite volume
computational grid approaches [25]. The 2-D models are appropriate for situations where
there is opportunity for ﬂood waters to spill out primary channels and ﬂow overland, such
as alluvial fans.
A popular public domain ﬂoodplain software package is the HEC-RAS, HEC-GeoRAS
software package developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers. HEC-GeoRAS is a set of
procedures, tools, and utilities for processing geospatial data in ArcGIS® using a graphical
user interface (GUI) [19]. Figure 7.14 illustrates the type of display obtainable from HEC’s
GeoRAS [26].
An example of 2-D hydraulic modeling was demonstrated for the South Boulder Creek
ﬂoodplain study. The MIKE FLOOD® model used in the study combines the traditional
channelized one-dimensional (or 1-D) ﬂow analysis model with a more physically based
two-dimensional (or 2-D) model that analyzes distributed ﬂow patterns away from the
channel and across the ﬂoodplain. Due to the complexity of ﬂow paths, the city updated the
older 2-ft mapping with detailed 1-ft contour interval maps. These topographic data were
developed using LIDAR technology which provided a DEM having 1-m grid spacing and a
GIS and Remote Sensing
397

vertical resolution of 15 cm. This allowed representation of the ground and structures in
greater detail. Figure 7.15a shows the deﬁnition of one-dimensional channel and canal
segments on a high-resolution digital orthophoto. Figure 7.15b shows a segment of the
LIDAR DEM used as the land base for the two-dimensional model.

5. GIS FOR WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS
5.1. Overview
Water supply systems are fundamental infrastructure components sustaining community
public health and economic productivity. This paper reviews water supply distribution
systems and components, aspects of their design and operation, and GIS concepts and tools
which support these activities. GIS tools are applied for demand estimations, network design,
and system operations. GIS spatial data management and analysis tools enable these func-
tions. Without GIS, required system parameters are often generalized. Spatial details on pipe
connections are often reduced to a single value expressing average tendency over a group of
connections which may introduce signiﬁcant error. A GIS provides functions for development
and preparation of accurate spatial information for input to network design simulation models
and operations control.
5.2. GIS-Based Water Supply Demand Forecasting
Procedures for generating water demands for pipe network modeling using GIS were
described by Wu et al. [27] and Prins and Bodeaux [28]. In general, water demands are
based on land use maps augmented by a relational database, or geodatabase, which incorpo-
rates attribute data such as customer ID, land use category, water use records, and per unit
planning factors. Customer billing records can be used to determine water demands given
historic records. Geocoding, a standard GIS process to establish the location of customers
based on their address, can be used to assign customer demands to a model using (a) nearest
node, (b) nearest pipe, or (c) meter aggregation [27]. Figure 7.16 illustrates an example of
nodal demand assignments by land use.
5.3. Pipe Network Design with GIS
Water supply distribution system design is accomplished using pipe network hydraulic
models to simulate performance of the network under various design scenarios, typically for
forecast maximum hour and maximum day plus ﬁre ﬂow demands. The pipe network design
process is iterative in character involving speciﬁcation of a pipe network layout having pipes of
certain types and sizes. For reliability, it is desirable that the network be a looped system so that
water can be delivered to all services even if a certain pipe is shut off for repairs. Topography can
be a primary determinant of system layout to take advantage of gravity distribution that is more
reliable and cheaper than pumping. Distribution storage tanks may be placed at strategic
locations in the system to provide storage to meet ﬂuctuations in use, provide water for ﬁre-
ﬁghting use, and stabilize pressures in the distribution system. Also, pumps may be required to
move water to high storage areas. It is necessary to calibrate the hydraulic model to ensure an
accurate representation of the actual distribution system hydraulics.
Pipe network models are based on hydraulic ﬂow and network theory and use the principles
of conservation of mass and energy to represent ﬂows and friction losses throughout a
network. Pipe networks create relatively complex problems, particularly if the network
400
L.E. Johnson

consists of a large number of pipes, and solutions of these problems require sophisticated
computerized mathematical procedures. Jeppson [29] and Walski [30] provide reviews of
numerical solution procedures.
There are a number of modeling packages for simulating pipe networks that are integrated
with GIS. The most common is the public domain EPANET model [31]. Other commercial
pipe network software includes WaterCad® and InfoWater/H2Onet®.
GIS provides functions for development and preparation of accurate spatial information for
input into the network design modeling process, which include network layout, connectivity,
pipe characteristics, pressure gradients, demand patterns, cost analysis, network routing and
allocation, and effective color graphic display of results. The GIS accomplishes database
management operations for both spatial and attribute data, user-friendly dialog interfaces for
data manipulation and output display, and models subsystem including both simulation and
optimization.
An application of EPANET and InfoWater® GIS pipe network modeling capabilities was
conducted by Szana [32]. The process used to create an all-pipes hydraulic model from GIS

data included (a) processing of initial GIS datasets, (b) importing data into the GIS,
(c) formulating the initial hydraulic model based on the GIS pipe data, (d) error-checking
for network connectivity, (e) assignment of node elevations based on the digital elevation
model (DEM), (f) assignment of node demands (current and future), (g) calibration of the
model for current conditions, and (h) simulations of alternative scenarios.
Processing of initial GIS datasets involved importing the ArcInfo® data from the city GIS
department. The all-pipes model was created from the GIS pipes dataset which contained
ﬁelds for all information useful to perform hydraulic and system analysis. A digital elevation
model was imported and geo-registered to the other spatial datasets; elevation is a fundamen-
tal attribute of the hydraulic model, and all nodes, reservoirs, pumps, and tanks must have
assigned elevations. A parcels dataset was imported to support land use demand factors and
customer notiﬁcation for maintenance and emergency conditions. Other GIS data were added,
including the street network, parks, and other land features; these were for general map
identiﬁcation purposes and were not used for the hydraulic analyses. The ﬁnal pipe network
was completed and available for nodal demand assignments and simulations (Fig. 7.17).
Fig. 7.17. Pipe network model completed with assignments to pressure zones [32].

Water use data from the billing system was used to represent the minimum and maximum
demands. Demands were allocated to the model using a meter-closest pipe method. Demands
for future growth or rezoning were estimated from the zoning designations where the system
will serve in the future.
Model calibration was accomplished by adjusting parameters until model outputs matched
ﬁeld data collected with the utility’s Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
system. This procedure involved two main processes. First, model parameters and attributes
that can be physically tested and/or measured are adjusted to attain model results that more
closely match actual results in the ﬁeld. Secondly, pipe roughness, which changes over time
and is very difﬁcult to measure, can be optimized to minimize the difference between the
model and ﬁeld results. The initial model calibration was accomplished by trial and error,
running model simulations and then viewing pressures, ﬂow rates, tank levels, and water age.
The process is aided by the GIS-based visual displays of pressures, velocities, and differences
between monitored and simulated values.
6. GIS FOR GROUNDWATER HYDROLOGY
6.1. Overview
GIS has found extensive application for groundwater assessments as there are many types
and large amounts of data involved. Proper evaluation of groundwater resources requires
thorough hydrologic, geologic, and hydraulic investigations. The spatial scope may be quite
local for a speciﬁc pumping well or range in size from a few hundred hectares to entire basins
and even countries. Use of simulation and management models is widespread in such studies,
and GIS has become a primary technology for coordinating the data management and
providing the interface for groundwater model development.
6.2. GIS for Groundwater Modeling
Groundwater modeling tools are used to represent an approximation of the ﬁeld data and
to assess the behavior of the groundwater system under varying climatic conditions (drought
conditions) or changes in water consumption, population growth, or changes in land use.
The most popular computer model of the numerical type is the modular ﬁnite-difference
groundwater ﬂow model (MODFLOW) developed by the US Geological Survey [33].
MODFLOW simulates groundwater ﬂow in aquifer systems using the ﬁnite-difference
method. A variety of features and processes such as rivers, streams, drains, springs,
reservoirs, wells, evapotranspiration, and recharge from precipitation and irrigation also
can be simulated (Fig. 7.18a). In this method, an aquifer system is divided into rectangular
blocks by a grid (Fig. 7.18b). The grid of blocks is organized by rows, columns, and layers,
and each block is commonly called a “cell.” For each cell within the volume of the aquifer
system, the user must specify aquifer properties. Also, the user speciﬁes information relating
to wells, rivers, and other inﬂow and outﬂow features for cells corresponding to the location
of the features.
GIS and Remote Sensing
403

Groundwater models require a number of disparate and large datasets which are difﬁcult to
manage. GIS can help with the modeling process by coordinating data collection, providing
comprehensive database operations, supporting systematic model parameter assignments,
conducting spatial analysis (e.g., spatial statistics) functions, and displaying model results
in understandable color map formats. Groundwater systems are often represented using
gridded data; grids are used to efﬁciently create and visualize spatial distributions for pre-
and post-processing of the model [34]. Grid functions make it easy to compare and modify
input data. Identifying attribute values of concern in large data ﬁles is made easier with GIS
when they can be visualized in map formats. Most data is gathered at points, which are then
interpolated using geo-statistical techniques into surfaces of elevations (land surface, piezo-
metric). GIS grids, coverages, and shapeﬁles are used to create the majority of the input
datasets for MODFLOW, including hydrogeology and stratigraphy, hydrogeologic parame-
ters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Coverages and shapeﬁles are used to
represent rivers, drains, and wells. Geoprocessing is used to create polygons with unique
soils, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and land use, which can then combined to generate
recharge and evapotranspiration arrays.
In concert with the surface water domain, there has been a movement toward a geodatabase
approach for groundwater data and modeling support. Zeiler [35] described the ESRI
geodatabase data model as an object-oriented model introduced with the ArcGIS® software.

The basic form of the model contains a geodatabase, feature datasets, feature classes, and
object classes. An example of a feature dataset would be a group of monitoring stations, where
a feature class would be the observation well locations and the object class the water level data
collected at all the stations. The model is packaged in a geodatabase, which contains the
feature datasets. Feature datasets in turn contain all the feature classes in a model and the
relationships among them within a common coordinate system. An object class is a nonspatial
entity like a data table, and feature classes are objects plus spatial coordinates. Maidment
et al. [36] extended the ArcHydro geodatabase concepts to include groundwater. Groundwater
applications range from regional studies, which usually describe the ﬂow in aquifers as
two-dimensional, to site investigations that model the three-dimensional nature of the ﬂow
through the aquifer architecture. Figure 7.19 illustrates the classes and relationships of the
three-dimensional data model.

The Rio Grande basin within Colorado is located in south-central Colorado and encom-
passes approximately 7,500 square miles. The primary feature of the basin is an open, almost
treeless, relatively ﬂat valley ﬂoor (known as the San Luis Valley) surrounded by mountains.
Agricultural activities account for more than 85 % of basin water consumption with an

estimated 638,000 acres under irrigation. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, small
grains, and alfalfa.
The basin has been the focus of a major groundwater modeling effort directed to assessing
the amount of recoverable water [37]. The Rio Grande Decision Support System [38] program
has been developed to provide the tools and information appropriate for water management of
the region. The RGDSS was directed to addressing these groundwater issues by activities for
groundwater modeling, consumptive use modeling, new data collection, and DSS integration.
The groundwater simulation modeling effort required new data on streamﬂows, piezometric
pressures, consumptive uses, stratigraphy, topography, and wells. GIS databases and tools of
various types provided a primary means for accomplishing the project. The coverages
developed for the RGDSS groundwater model included rivers/streams, canals, drains, surface
irrigated lands, groundwater irrigated lands, wells, nonirrigated lands, soils, rim inﬂows,
diversion locations, and gage locations. All GIS coverages were developed on a common
datum and consistent units.
The groundwater computer modeling package MODFLOW was used as the primary
simulation tool to analyze the movement and impact of pumping wells on the surface water
system in the Rio Grande basin. Procedures for developing input ﬁles for MODFLOW were
described by Rindahl and Bennett [39]. The groundwater modeling interface system (GMS)
involved integration of GIS coverages, relational databases, and consumptive use model
results into a coordinated package for generating input ﬁles required by the following
MODFLOW packages: (1) basic package (2) block-centered ﬂow package, (3) general head
boundary package, (4) stream or river package, (5) output control, (6) solver package, and
(7) drain package. GMS also exports the model cell grid system so that it can be processed by
the ArcView® data analysis.
Calibration of the Rio Grande basin groundwater model was performed for steady-state
(1990–1998) and average monthly (1970–2002) study periods [38]. It was determined to be
adequate when the difference between observed and simulated ﬂow values and heads was
minimized while maintaining aquifer parameters within a reasonable range. Calibration
included evaluation of (1) groundwater budget, (2) change in storage, (3) streamﬂow, diver-
sions and gain-loss, (4) observation wells, (5) total evapotranspiration, and (6) other
non-numeric data (e.g., dry cells, ﬂooded cells). Figure 7.20 presents a residuals plot that
shows the difference between simulated head and observed head for the 903 wells where
observed data was compared to simulated values; the map display is for layer 1 of the model
(the top most layer of the four-layer model). The residual plots indicate the model reproduces
observation wells fairly accurately with better results in the center of the valley than the
boundaries.

Abstract Climate change challenges water managers to make decisions about future infra-
structure and the adequacy of current supplies before the uncertainties of the climate models
and their hydrological impacts are resolved. Water managers thus face the classic problem of
decision making under uncertainty (DMUU). The aim of DMUU is not to be paralyzed by
uncertainty, but to highlight and use it to better manage risk. Strategies for DMUU include
scenario planning, exploratory simulation modeling, robust decision making, and anticipatory
planning and governance. These tools imply a new role for social scientists in the ﬁelds of
water science and engineering and a new relationship between water science and the practi-
tioner community. Examples are drawn from Phoenix, Arizona, and the US Southwest for
DMUU support tools and strategies for science-policy engagement. Simulation experiments
for Phoenix reveal challenging, but feasible, strategies for climate adaptation in the water
sector for all but the most dire future climate conditions.

1. INTRODUCTION
The growing uncertainties of climate change present formidable challenges for water
engineering and planning, as presently practiced. Systems for managing water traditionally
have been designed and operated assuming the principle of stationarity—the notion that
natural systems function within a known envelope of variability [1]. This principle implies
that relevant hydrological variables such as stream ﬂow and annual ﬂood peak vary according
to probability-density functions based on the instrumented record. These functions are, in
turn, the basis for managing risk to water supplies and building infrastructure. Anthropogenic
changes in Earth’s climate are altering the means and extremes of temperature, precipitation,
evapotranspiration, and rates of river discharge [2]. These changes imply that the
instrumented historical record may no longer be a valid basis for predicting the future and
managing risk.
Climate change belongs to a class of problems characterized by “deep uncertainty.” These
are situations about which there is fundamental disagreement about the driving forces that will
shape the future, the probability distributions used to represent uncertainty, and how to value
alternative outcomes [3]. Water managers, facing long lead times to plan and implement new
water infrastructure, often are required to make decisions before the uncertainties about
climate models and their hydrological impacts will be resolved. They are prime candidates
for decision making under uncertainty (DMUU). DMUU approaches reframe the climate-
change question from how we can reduce uncertainty in the climate models and their
application to how we can better decisions in the face of inevitable uncertainty about the
climate. The idea is not to be paralyzed by uncertainty, but to draw attention to it and use it for
better decision making.
DMUU approaches move away from the idea that there is a single optimal or most likely
future and take into account multiple possible futures expressed as scenarios. They clarify
stakeholder priorities and goals and use them as the basis for presenting choices about the
future. These choices often involve critical tradeoffs, for example, between the risk of
shortage and the cost of redundant infrastructure, system efﬁciency and distributional fair-
ness, short-term economic growth and long-term sustainability, and water for farmers to grow
food and water for city dwellers to grow decorative lawns. Societal decisions about these
tradeoffs require us to ask: what is the risk, what is safe, is it fair, and who is responsible?
These questions inherently involve human values, social organization, governance, partici-
patory processes, and decision making and thus engage social scientists in research about the
water system.
This chapter will focus on climate models and water resource management from a DMUU
perspective. Tools for DMUU include scenario planning, exploratory simulation modeling,
robust decision making, and anticipatory governance. These tools imply a new role for social
scientists in the ﬁelds of water science and engineering and a new relationship between water
science and engineering and water policy. I use examples from Phoenix, Arizona, and the
southwestern US to show the growing risk of climate-induced water scarcity, new methods of
water planning and decision making, and the application of DMUU tools in the water sector.

The chapter concludes with a discussion of the newly emerging ﬁeld of sustainability science
and the insight it offers for the practice of integrated water management in an age of deep
uncertainty.
2. CLIMATE UNCERTAINTY AND VULNERABILITY
2.1. Sources of Climate Uncertainty
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report in
2007 expressed high to very high conﬁdence about climate-change impacts on freshwater
systems and their management via increasing temperatures (e.g., effects of increased evapo-
ration on water demand and decreased stream ﬂows), sea level rise (e.g., contamination of
freshwater estuaries and groundwater resources), and increasing precipitation variability (e.g.,
frequency and duration of droughts, ﬂoods, and severe climate events). Semiarid and arid
regions are particularly prone to a variety of climate-change impacts; a warmer planet means
more intense convection and precipitation at the equator which, in turn, reduces the amount of
rainfall available to arid and semiarid regions at ~30 north and south latitude. Changing
climate will create a host of water-related problems including droughts, ﬂoods, subsidence,
shrinking glaciers, and damage to aquatic ecosystems (Fig. 8.1).
Efforts to quantify the global and regional effects of climate change use atmosphere-ocean
general circulation models (AOGCMs) to simulate future (and past) climate conditions. These
Fig. 8.1. IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report shows the range of vulnerabilities that may be affected by
future climate change, superimposed on a map of water stress (Source: IPCC [4], Fig. 3.2).
Decision Making under Uncertainty

computer models are based on differential equations that describe basic laws of physics, ﬂuid
motion, and atmospheric chemistry; the equations are solved for three-dimensional grid cells
with the goal of accurately replicating atmospheric, oceanic, and land-surface processes
through time. They are the primary tools for estimating future changes in temperature,
precipitation, humidity, and solar radiation resulting from changes in atmospheric composi-
tion (e.g., increasing greenhouse gas emissions) and land-surface properties (e.g., increasing
urbanization).
Signiﬁcantuncertainties areassociated with forecasts from the most widely usedAOGCMs [2,
5]. These models have different resolutions in time and space, they are constructed with varying
emphases on different processes, and they contain different statistical parameterizations to
represent unresolved physical processes such as the formation of clouds and precipitation,
ocean mixing due to wave processes, sea–ice interactions, and land-surface processes. The
IPCC states “Uncertainty in parameterizations is the primary reason why climate projections
differ between different AOGCMs” [2]. The inherently chaotic nature of the climate system also
guarantees some level of uncertainty in model predictions.
Uncertainties about human activities further complicate modeling of the global atmo-
spheric system. Modelers struggle with how to address human behavior with respect to fossil
fuel use, development and adoption of renewable energy sources, population growth, eco-
nomic development, technological innovation, and human alteration of land cover. The IPCC
considers a range of storyline and scenario families and is careful to avoid statements about
the relative likelihood of scenarios. Instead, they pronounce scenarios as “equally sound,”
without explicitly deﬁning what this means [6].
Additional sources of uncertainty are introduced when moving from global and hemi-
spheric to regional and local scales where climate impacts are experienced by human
populations and where water decisions are made. Researchers have developed statistical
and dynamical modeling approaches to “downscale” AOGCM output to higher resolutions
at regional scales such as drainage basins. Uncertainties at these scales are particularly large
for precipitation, given the models’ problems with simulating clouds and other processes that
produce precipitation. Uncertainties in model predictions appear to increase in areas of
complex terrain, creating special problems in the mountainous western US [2, 7, 8].
The National Research Council reported that the US Southwest will become warmer and
drier in this century, reducing snowpack, Colorado River ﬂows, and urban water supplies
[9]. Results from 24 climate models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) point to drier conditions in the Southwest, but there is
substantial uncertainty about the extent, causal mechanisms, and geographic pattern of
increased aridity [10]. A set of downscaled model/scenario combinations from the AR4 for
the Salt/Verde River Basins, immediately upstream from Phoenix and major sources of
Phoenix’s surface water (Fig. 8.2), revealed that future (2030) stream ﬂow could range
from 19 to 123 % of historical averages [11]. Similar results from the AR3 model/scenario
combinations showed a range of 50–127 % [12]. Uncertainty about the physical systems that
deliver surface water to Phoenix actually increased from the AR3 (2001) to the AR4 (2007)
results as additional AOGCMs were developed and as climate models were linked to more
and new land-use and hydrological models.

2.2. Stationarity Assumption
Water systems throughout the world are designed and operated using the assumption of
stationarity—the idea that natural systems operate within a known envelope of variability
(Fig. 8.3). This envelope of variability is used to build and operate water infrastructure, such
as dams and reservoirs, storm-water runoff systems, and wastewater treatment plants. In a
seminal 2008 article in Science, Milly et al. declared that “stationarity is dead” [1]. There is
now solid evidence in support of structural change in Earth’s climate system, including a
poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zone. The hydroclimate appears to have exited the
known envelope of variability in some regions. And yet, records of historical variability

remain the primary basis for establishing the risk of shortage, ﬂooding, soil erosion, lake
sedimentation, and ecosystem damage in water systems.
Nonstationary conditions pose signiﬁcant challenges for reservoir construction and man-
agement. Reservoirs store water to account for natural variability (both seasonal and
interannual) in river ﬂows. Figure 8.4 shows the typical cumulative ﬂow over a 10-year
period in Line A. The maximum supply that the reservoir can provide in any given year is the
average slope of the cumulative curve. If the ﬂow becomes more variable, as it does in Line B,
the reservoir will have to be enlarged to guarantee a given yield. This is the case even if
average ﬂows remain constant. Long periods of low ﬂows, where the cumulative curve
ﬂattens (Line C), result in reduced yield no matter how large the reservoir. This example
demonstrates the sensitivity of physical infrastructure to assumptions about future climate and
the formidable challenge of infrastructure planning in an era of uncertainty. While it is
possible to optimize reservoir design based on projections from a single climate model, this
design will not account for all future possibilities. Rather than optimize on the basis of climate
models that are still improving, water resource managers alternatively can seek solutions such
as demand management that are less sensitive to any one or any one set of climate
predictions [13].
2.3. Extremes Matter!
Extreme events that fall outside the envelope of historical variability expose individuals
and communities to the risk of harm. Modern societies have adapted to the historical range of
climate extremes through engineering works, building codes and ﬂoodplain maps, warning

number of standard deviation units from the mean annual ﬂow.

systems, and ﬁnancial instruments such as insurance programs and contingency funds. The
problem is that these historical ranges are, in many cases, changing as a result of global
warming. Droughts and heat waves have, over the past 40–50 years, become more intense and
frequent in the US [14]. This means that many communities are experiencing climate
conditions that are outside their “coping range” (Fig. 8.5). The core of the coping range
contains beneﬁcial outcomes. Approaching the critical threshold, outcomes are negative but
tolerable to human societies because they have adapted to accommodate them. Beyond the
critical threshold, damages and losses can no longer be tolerated, raising the risk of harm to
individuals and communities. Theoretically, societies can extend coping ranges through
further adaptive behaviors, but building new infrastructures, remapping ﬂoodplains, and
changing human perceptions of risk take time and cost money. In an era of climate change,
society will be more vulnerable to environmental harm until these adaptive behaviors are
accomplished.
Ability to cope depends not only on the intensity of events but also on their frequencies
(Fig. 8.6). In the upper diagram, two events of similar magnitude take place, but after the ﬁrst
one, new adaptation measures, such as changes in building codes, are undertaken. The second
event thus has a lessened impact. In the bottom diagram, a second extreme event occurs before
an area has completely recovered from and adapted to the previous one. It has a total impact in
excess of what would have occurred in isolation. That is what happened during the 2003 heat
wave in Europe. Anomalous hot and dry conditions affected southern and central Europe
between June and mid-August 2003, raising temperatures by 3–5 C. The warm conditions in

June lasted throughout the month, but did not cause excess mortality until the second episode
between August 1 and 13 when temperatures were more than 7 C above normal (Fig. 8.7).
Extreme events are also the primary mechanism by which nonhuman biological species
will experience the impacts of climate change. Van Vliet and Leemans have documented that
“the unexpected rapid appearance of ecological responses through the world” can be
explained largely by observed changes in extremes for the past several decades [18]. These
climate-induced biological changes affect humanity indirectly through ecosystem services,
such as water provisioning, temperature regulation, nutrient cycling, recreation, and spiritual
beneﬁts.
2.4. Vulnerability to Extreme Events
Study of the vulnerability of complex human and social systems to extreme events has
evolved over the past several decades from one focused on physical hazards (ﬂoods, droughts,
ﬁres, earthquakes, etc.) to one that considers both physical exposure and the human ability
to cope with extreme events [19]. Social scientists became more active in this ﬁeld as
attention turned from the physical event itself to the structure of social systems and personal
characteristics that put people at risk to extreme events. A lack of coordination among public
agencies, conﬂicts in responsibilities and mandates, political and ﬁnancial priorities, and
awareness of, and conﬁdence in, available information affect the adaptive capacity of local
governments [20, 21]. On a personal level, coping capacity is affected by poverty, racial and

Empereur-Bissonnet [17], Fig. 2).

ethnic status, age (young children and the elderly are least able to cope), migration status
(newcomers have less understanding of the local environment and risk than long-term
residents), and housing tenure (owners have a greater stake in local outcomes than renters).
Populations lacking in economic assets and access to public support systems, with diminished
physical or cognitive capacities to respond to warnings, and missing strong and enduring
social support systems are least able to adapt to and thus more vulnerable to physical
hazards [16].
3. DECISION MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY
3.1. Problems of Deep Uncertainty
Standard methods of risk analysis from a variety of disciplines, including game theory,
economics, operations research, and statistical decision theory, have been successfully
applied to policy problems for many decades. These methods are adequate for problems in
which system behavior is predictable—situations in which probability functions are known
and widely used and accepted as the basis to assess risk. Increasingly, however, society is
confronted with problems such as climate change, sustainable development, and the intro-
duction of new technologies where inherent uncertainties can lead to surprising and cata-
strophic outcomes. Classical methods of uncertainty analysis using probabilities, statistics,
and statistical decision theory are inadequate for these types of problems [22].
Deep uncertainty characterizes situations (e.g., prospects of a particular business, intro-
duction of a new technology, water planning in the face of climate change) in which analysts
do not know or cannot agree upon the key drivers that will shape the future, probability
functions that represent uncertainty, and how to value who gains and who loses from key
outcomes [3]. When making their arguments about deep uncertainty, decision scientists use
the physical principle of nonstationarity to argue that the past is not an adequate guide for
predicting the future.
DMUU methods can be used in the water sector for planning and decision making. These
methods account for the fact that uncertainty will not be resolved before near-term
decisions must be made about whether to build water infrastructure, acquire backup
supplies, and alter urban growth patterns. They further acknowledge that water is but one
component in a complex system of supply and demand, and water managers thus face
multiple sources of uncertainty. Even without climate change, the Southwest would be
vulnerable to water shortage due to rapid population growth and urbanization, ﬁerce
competition between urban and agricultural interests, cultural practices that rely on
heavy water use to maintain oasis-type landscape treatments, and highly fragmented and
rigid institutions that were set up to manage interannual variability of the twentieth century
rather than twenty-ﬁrst-century climate change. When queried about other sources of
uncertainty, Phoenix-area water managers mention aspects of their policy setting, such as
the legal status of Indian water rights, endangered-species designations, and the environ-
mental permitting process [23].

3.2. Scenario Planning
Scenario planning is designed to cope with the uncertainty and unpredictability of the
future. Scenario planners conduct group exercises and create narratives or storylines about the
long-term future. These exercises often construct a small number of stories from qualitative
discussions. Even quantitative analyses that produce hundreds and thousands of computer
runs typically are reduced to a small number (three to four) of plausible and logically
consistent stories about the future. It is important that each scenario be theoretically possible,
even though some participants in the exercise believe it to be undesirable or unlikely
[3]. Avoiding these rare but sometimes catastrophic outcomes is often a major concern in
real-world policy situations.
Planning exercises involve a series of steps by which a set of scenarios are developed and
evaluated [24]. The ﬁrst step deﬁnes the decisions these scenarios are designed to inform. In
the water sector, long-term planning and policy decisions include the design and construction
of new water-supply infrastructure, agricultural planting patterns, water markets that allow
temporary transfers of water, allocations and rate structures, and reservoir operating rules.
The second step is to identify the most important and uncertain driving factors that will affect
these decisions. The scenario planning group is then asked to rank key driving forces and their
uncertainties. It is common for stakeholders to have differing views of the future; one goal of
scenario planning is to bring these differences into the open and for stakeholders to acknowl-
edge that a range of alternative futures is possible.
Table 8.1 lists the concerns or priorities of water stakeholders in Phoenix. Respondents to
an online survey included representatives from federal and state entities, Indian tribes, local
and regional water providers, private sector providers and users, and environmental organi-
zations. They were asked to apportion 100 points across categories to reﬂect their level of
concern about the following: (a) social and economic impacts, (b) ﬁnancial and technical
requirements, (c) health and safety, (d) natural and biophysical impacts, (e) political impacts
and governance, (f) supply sufﬁciency, and (g) other legal and institutional issues. The most
highly rated concern for managers in the desert city of Phoenix was the sufﬁciency of supply,
accounting for 32 % of the total points, followed by impacts on the natural environment
(16 %), health and safety (13 %), political impacts and governance (12 %), and ﬁnancial and
technical requirements (12 %). The overall results mask important differences across stake-
holder groups, however. Representatives from local water departments and regional agencies
expressed more concern for water sufﬁciency and safety than environmental groups who
emphasized impacts on the natural/biophysical environment [25]. These results expose a
critical tradeoff in urban water decisions—how to balance instream ﬂows and biodiversity
with the need to provide an adequate and reliable supply 24/7 for an ever-growing urban
population.
After bringing the priorities and views of divergent groups into the open, a third step
involves crafting three to four scenarios for in-depth discussion and analysis. The fourth step
investigates how alternative policies and decisions work across these scenarios. This testing
and evaluation process can be done qualitatively through discussion and consensus or
quantitatively through simulation experiments. Scenarios are examined to determine the

most critical outcomes and to identify “branching points” relating to the issues and policies
that have the greatest impact (potentially generating crisis) on the future. Planning from
scenarios involves searching for policies that are robust, that is, they will perform reasonably
well across a wide range of plausible future scenarios. The goal is to minimize downside risk,
given that we do not know what the future will hold.
Scenario planning processes have been criticized for their reluctance to explore rare events,
failure to consider a full range of future conditions, and tendency to focus too early on one
particular scenario for implementation purposes [26]. In principle, the goal of scenario
planning is to open discussion to a wide range of future conditions; in practice, the process
often limits community response to a single view of the future [26].
3.3. Simulation/Exploratory Modeling
Many, but not all, scenario planning processes use simulation models to represent complex
human-natural coupled systems and to anticipate how they respond to various biophysical
changes and policy decisions. Bankes makes a useful distinction between consolidative
modeling which uses known facts to replicate an actual system and exploratory modeling
which investigates the consequences of varying assumptions and hypotheses about the system
and its future dynamics [27]. The former is useful in optimization and prediction, while the
latter acknowledges that not all relevant and important information is available. Exploratory
modeling is appropriate for situations in which there is a high level of system complexity—
where nonlinear behaviors and feedbacks can result in unintended consequences and poten-
tially catastrophic events. The search for an optimum solution may not reveal the unlikely but
real possibility for catastrophic consequences nor will it necessarily reveal a path that would
avoid such consequences. There has been considerable development of agent-based modeling
as an exploratory simulation approach to deal with problems that are characterized by
complexity and deep uncertainty [22, 28].
Exploratory models can be both scientiﬁc tools to investigate system behavior and com-
munication devices to promote social learning about the system at hand. Ideally, they evolve
iteratively as new information is gained and integrated into modeling activities. Robust
decision making acknowledges that a range of long-term conditions are possible and that
near-term strategies will be revisited as our knowledge about complex systems improves.
3.4. Elements of Robust Decision Making
Robust adaptive strategies are “comprised of shaping actions intended to inﬂuence the
future, hedging actions intended to reduce vulnerability if adverse futures come to pass, and
signposts, which are observations that warn of the need to change strategies” [29]. Hedging
actions in the water sector have traditionally involved building redundancies into the water
system with additional infrastructure or supply sources. Shaping actions involve conservation
programs aimed at reducing demand or altering the built environment to reduce water use. In
Phoenix, there is a strong relationship between urban residential densities and per capita water
use (Fig. 8.8). Urban densities of 37–74 housing units per hectare require around 75 m3 of
water per person annually, compared to large-lot semirural developments where per capita
Decision Making under Uncertainty
423

water use is almost ten times higher. Adding compact residential developments would lower
per capita water requirements and shape demand. Signposts involve predetermined thresholds
that automatically trigger policy action. Policy change might involve an increase in price or use
of block pricing, implementation of a water education program, incentives to replace turf grass
with native plants, step-up in water reuse, or ﬁxing leaks and improving water efﬁciency.
3.5. Anticipatory Governance
The planning profession has developed the idea of anticipatory governance to address
problems of deep uncertainty. Guston distinguished between precaution and anticipation in
dealing with complex problems of deep uncertainty [31]. Precaution is a way of acting that
avoids predicted but uncertain risks; anticipation implies building capacity to respond to
unpredictable and uncertain risks. Anderson argued for the need to move from prediction and
prevention toward more anticipatory modes of practice [32]. Rather than trying to avoid the
unknown, he urges that we anticipate surprise and plan systems that are able to accommodate
a wide range of future conditions.
Feurth deﬁnes anticipatory governance as “a system of institutions, rules, and norms that
provide a way to use foresight for the purpose of reducing risk, and to increase capacity to
respond to events at early rather than later stages of their development” [33]. Employing the
principles of anticipatory governance, the City of Phoenix utilizes a range of scenarios in its
water planning process, including the possibility of moderate-to-severe water shortage, vary-
ing levels of conservation, and different development patterns (e.g., high versus low density).
Over the next 8–10 years, supplies are adequate to meet even the most dire drought conditions,
but action is needed to address the gap between projected demand and current supplies and thus
prevent shortage beyond 2025 (Fig. 8.9). As a result of this exercise, the City is now taking
steps to develop backup supplies in the form of recharged groundwater credits (excess supplies
can now be banked underground and credited for use later), additional surface water from the
Colorado River via the Central Arizona Project, and reclaimed water [34].
Anticipatory governance entails three steps: (a) anticipation and futures analysis,
(b) ﬂexible adaptation strategies, and (c) monitoring and action [26]. The anticipation and

and Kirkwood [30],

futures analysis phase is quite close to robust decision making in the sense that it uses advanced
computation methods to produce a large number of scenarios. Outcome spaces are then
examined for robust policies; worst-case or unacceptable outcomes are identiﬁed; and sensi-
tivity analyses of various factors are conducted. Using the range of possible futures identiﬁed
in the ﬁrst step, adaptive strategies are developed in the second step. Ideally, these strategies
are broken into modules so that they can be implemented separately as funding becomes
available and knowledge about the climate and other relevant systems increases. Critical to any
adaptive strategies is the monitoring and action required in the third step. Phoenix, Denver, and
New York were evaluated for their anticipatory governance procedures, but none had yet
developed a structured monitoring program for long-term water planning [26].
Camacho notes that effective climate adaptation “necessitates a fundamental reformation
of natural resource governance” [35]. This reformation would ask different questions about
the water system. Rather than focus on the physical aspects of water systems, relevant
questions would address why governance systems are unable to cope with uncertainty,
why they lack capacity for cooperative behavior, why they are unable to learn from mistakes,
and why information sharing is limited. More coordinated and adaptive governance systems
consist of:
1.
Proactive strategies that take effect before the impacts of climate change are felt rather than
reactive strategies that respond to a problem at hand or seek to prevent it from reoccurring,
2.
No-regret strategies that provide a net beneﬁt irrespective of the effects of climate change,
3.
Procedural strategies focused on the regulatory environment itself and how decisions about natural
resource management are made [35].
3.6. WaterSim: An Example of DMUU
We constructed WaterSim, an integrated simulation model, to investigate the long-term
consequences of climate change and policies to manage groundwater, growth, and urban
development in metropolitan Phoenix [36]. WaterSim represents water consumption and
Fig. 8.9. Current projections indicate that Phoenix will be unable to meet expected demands in 2020
under shortage conditions without augmenting current supplies. Adapted from Water Resources Plan

Decision Making under Uncertainty

availability in Central Arizona from the present until 2030 and uses the XLRM framework
which contains four types of components:
1.
Exogenous uncertainties (X) are factors that decision makers cannot control; these are primarily
associated with climate and water supply,
2.
Policy levers (L) are actions that decision makers could take, such as groundwater policy, land-use
planning, and population growth management,
3.
Relationships (R) are mathematical or algorithmic associations among variables,
4.
Outcome measures (M) summarize outcome metrics for decision- and policy-making purposes [3].
Model users can consider the consequences of policies related to population growth, while
assuming that consumption is restricted to available surface-water supply plus natural
recharge (Fig. 8.10). Groundwater is used sustainably in this set of model runs, assuming
that withdrawal equals natural recharge. This assumption does not account for instream ﬂows
and assumes that 40 % of indoor water use is recycled. The left diagram (Fig. 8.10a) shows the
effects of population-growth scenarios under varying climate-change conditions on the Salt/
Verde system. The right diagram (Fig. 8.10b) shows outcomes across climate-change condi-
tions on the Colorado River. Under the expected unconstrained growth conditions (“100 % of
projected growth”), liters per capita per day (LPCD) range from 371 to 587 for the Salt/Verde
system and from 269 to 606 for the Colorado system. Any of these outcomes would require
reductions from today’s consumption levels of 875 LPCD on a regional basis. The midpoint
for the Salt/Verde system would translate into consumption levels of 511 LPCD, while the
Colorado midpoint would mean consumption levels of 496 LPCD. These average conditions
impose challenging but feasible restrictions on current growth patterns and lifestyles, as
Tucson’s 2005 LPCD was 431 and, in Albuquerque, it was 416 [37]. Limited growth would
reduce the need for lifestyle sacriﬁces, and in the no-growth cases, modest reductions would
accommodate all but the worst-case climate-model results.

Central Arizona is especially sensitive to climate-change conditions on the Colorado River
system because of a 1968 agreement put into place when federal funding was secured for the
Central Arizona Project (CAP). In exchange for support from the California congressional
delegation for a federal loan to build the CAP, regional advocates agreed to give California
senior rights to Lower Colorado River allocations [38]. The consequences of this agreement
have appeared only recently with persistent drought on the Colorado River Basin. In 2010,
levels in Lake Mead sat at 1,082 ft above sea level [39]. These were dangerously close to the
1,075-foot mark at which the ﬁrst cutbacks in delivery to CAP would be triggered (Fig. 8.11).
Long-term drought would reduce Central Arizona’s allocation quickly and lead to the
steeply sloping lines in Fig. 8.10b. The region would more gradually lose its supply from
the Salt/Verde system as shown in Fig. 8.10a. These ﬁgures and these types of analyses allow
policy makers and stakeholders to explore best, worst, and mean-case climate-change condi-
tions and then explore the effects of managing growth on output metrics (in this case LPCD).
The process also highlights tradeoffs between continued growth and maintaining oasis-type
lifestyles and landscape treatments (reﬂected in LPCD).
We used WaterSim to examine water availability under all possible runoff conditions for
both systems. We considered the effect of policies related to population growth, assuming that
consumption is restricted to available surface-water supply plus recharge. Under the expected
unconstrained growth conditions (100 % of projected growth, Fig. 8.12a), there are future
climate conditions that would require substantial reductions in consumption below 425 LPCD
and many to below 250 LPCD, which is slightly below what is now used for indoor purposes.
Lowering the growth rate to 50 % of the projected unconstrained level would allow the region
to sustain current levels of indoor use under all but the most severe future climate conditions
(Fig. 8.12b). A no-growth policy would further reduce the risk that current levels of indoor use
could not be sustained (Fig. 8.12c).
We also investigated how groundwater drawdown would be affected by climate-change
conditions if we assume a policy with current levels of residential water demand.

Groundwater has been the historical bank account from which providers tap when surface
supplies are in deﬁcit. Under currently projected population growth conditions and
unconstrained water usage, it is not possible to achieve groundwater sustainability in 2030
under any climate scenario (Fig. 8.13a). At current consumption levels, drawdown would
become quite severe if the pessimistic climate scenarios were to occur. At current drawdown

rates of between 250 million m3/year and 600 million m3/year, cumulative drawdown ranges
from 6 billion to 14 billion m3 over the course of the simulation. Current growth patterns
produce more extreme drawdown situations; the more pessimistic the climate-change condi-
tions, the more severe drawdown levels are. Policy action of some kind is necessary to achieve
long-term groundwater sustainability, although it is possible to justify some overdraft while
society learns to cope with new climate conditions.
Figure 8.13b shows the impacts on cumulative groundwater drawdown of restricting
population growth to 50 % of projected levels and eliminating irrigated outdoor landscaping
and private backyard pools. These policies would achieve groundwater sustainability under
normal (100 %) surface ﬂows and would substantially reduce drawdown for all but the most
severe climate futures.
4. HUMAN FACTORS IN THE WATER SECTOR
4.1. Water Planning as a Social Process
The predict-and-plan model of water management in which well-deﬁned problems are
solved with technological solutions, such as wastewater treatment and water-supply augmen-
tation, has tended to treat human actors as separate from the environmental and technical
problem at hand [40]. The socioeconomic system is typically seen as an external boundary
condition—the number of people to be served, the nature of their land uses, rules that govern
reservoir management, etc. The complexities, feedbacks, and uncertainties in modern water
systems require that humans and their social organizations and political institutions be fully
integrated into water science. The use of DMUU strategies, the search for robust solutions in
water planning, and analysis of system vulnerabilities recognize that humans and nature are
elements of an inherently coupled system. Critical vulnerabilities often occur in the intersec-
tion points of the human and physical system, for example, when governance systems are
incapable of dealing with climate-induced changes in water supply.
While climate mitigation efforts such as emission standards, carbon markets, and incen-
tives for renewable energy are within the purview of federal authority, climate adaptation
often occurs at the local and regional level where climate impacts will be felt and relevant
decision making occurs. Adaptation efforts require participatory processes that reveal the
needs of diverse stakeholders for climate and hydrological information and decision support
and consensus building among these diverse stakeholders. Social scientists, particularly
decision scientists, have played a mediating role in translating the products of water science
into tools to support decision making in the water sector.
Jacobs et al. conducted an information-gathering workshop with water stakeholders and
found that the availability of more information is often not the major impediment of good
decisions [41]. The more relevant question is how much information is enough and how to
develop and sustain participatory networks that reveal the answer to this question. Workshop
participants noted that effective knowledge systems mine both practical experience and
scientiﬁc knowledge to focus on common solutions to reduce the risk from climate change.
Stakeholders emphasized robust solutions—those that reduce risk, no matter what the future
climate conditions.

4.2. Boundary Science
Scholars in the ﬁeld of science and technology policy studies have systematically examined
the process of science-policy engagement, now known as “boundary science,” for best
practices. Cash et al. have identiﬁed the attributes of knowledge systems that support decision
making in the environmental realm [42]. They note the emergence of boundary organizations
that sit at the interface of science and policy and are responsible to both. In-depth analysis
from case studies of boundary organizations reveals that efforts to use science to support
policy and decision making are more likely to be effective when they manage the boundary
between science and policy in ways that balance credibility, salience, and legitimacy.
Credibility embodies the adequacy of technical advice and scientiﬁc arguments. Salience
deals with the relevance of the assessment to the needs of decision makers, and legitimacy
speaks to the perception that scientiﬁc and technological experts have been respectful of
stakeholders’ divergent values and beliefs, unbiased, and fair in their treatment of opposing
views. Water managers in Central Arizona gave high marks to WaterSim for its legitimacy,
believing that it was produced from unbiased and objective data, modeling efforts, and
scientiﬁc relationships, but lower marks for credibility and salience. The model had not yet
included all relevant components of the regional water budget and thus was not yet deemed
useful for decision making [43].
Participatory environments for science-policy engagement are hampered by differing
perceptions of the relevant problem and its solutions. Scientists, water professionals, and
the public at large have fundamentally different views of the problem of potential water
shortage in Phoenix [44]. Survey results show that scientists viewed the possibility of climate-
induced water shortage as a demand management problem—the key issue is how water is
used, not supply constraints. The city can solve its water problems through conservation and
urban design. Water managers tended to emphasize supply-side constraints and focused on
how to obtain additional supplies from farmers, desalination, and infrastructure augmentation.
The general public saw potential shortage as someone else’s problem—why should today’s
households conserve water to protect the proﬁts from new development on the urban fringe?
These differing perceptions present profound challenges for participatory processes that
aspire to link science with decision making for climate adaptation in the water sector and
beyond.
4.3. Decision Theater
Visualization is increasingly used to facilitate social learning and decision making. Visu-
alization caves and decision theaters create an immersive experience in which participants
feel part of the model development and scientiﬁc process. Arizona State University’s 3-D,
immersive Decision Theater enables WaterSim to be seen, experienced, and manipulated by
water stakeholders and the public at large (Fig. 8.14). The model and its user interface have
evolved as an iterative process (WaterSim 5.0 is now in development) in response to user
criticism and suggestions. Users requested less emphasis on the climate conditions that are
outside of their control and more opportunity to manipulate policy conditions that are within
their purview (Fig. 8.15).

5. SUSTAINABLE WATER SYSTEMS
The seminal and enduring deﬁnition of sustainability comes from the Brundtland
Commission Report in 1987: “Sustainable development is development that meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
own needs” [45]. While it has been easier to deﬁne sustainability as an intellectual concept
than as an operational tool, there is growing agreement that a sustainability perspective
includes an awareness of complex systems thinking, foresight analysis, decision making
under uncertainty, stakeholder engagement, and interdisciplinary approaches to real-world
problem solving.
When these ideas are applied to the water sector, it is clear that the current practice of water
management and water science will need to evolve to meet the challenges of water sustain-
ability. Not only do we need to treat the water sector as a complex human-natural coupled
system, include water professionals in the coproduction of knowledge, and incorporate
DMUU support tools, but also consider the fact that water is not a stand-alone resource. It
is connected to land (low-density development encourages high per capita water use), food
production (virtual water is exported via food crops), and energy (the so-called energy-water
nexus). Water and energy, particularly in arid regions, are linked resources. Energy is used to
pump, move, and treat water. Water is used to turn turbines, wash inputs, and cool equipment.
It is anticipated that as climate changes, water resources will be altered; potentially reducing
their quality, quantity, and accessibility. This in turn will require increased energy inputs to
purify water of lower quality or pump water from greater depths or distances. Thus, the effects
of climate change for the water sector may appear indirectly in the amount of energy it will
take to deliver and treat water and keep the city cool.
The concept of sustainability challenges us to look at water holistically, to consider the
hidden vulnerabilities that occur because water is linked to other resources such as energy,
land, and food production. This new approach to water science is interdisciplinary; it requires
analysis of how complex human and biophysical systems function at a range of scales and
new tools for risk assessment and decision support that incorporate notions of decision
making under uncertainty.

Abstract Signiﬁcant advances in upland erosion modeling have been achieved in the past
decade. The TREX (Two-dimensional Runoff, Erosion, and Export) watershed model has
been developed at Colorado State University for the simulation of surface runoff from
spatially and temporally distributed rainstorms on watersheds. The model has been applied
in several countries with different climatic conditions. TREX can calculate surface inﬁltra-
tion, surface runoff, sediment transport, and the partition of metals in dissolved, adsorbed, and
particulate form. The focus of this chapter is on the calculation of surface ﬂows and total
suspended solids at the watershed scale. The chapter is comprised of three parts: (a) a
description of the main processes and governing equations, (b) a description of the model
components and algorithms, and (c) an application example on a large watershed. The
application example for Naesung Stream in South Korea provides powerful visual evidence
of upland erosion processes at the watershed scale during large rainstorms (300 mm of
rainfall). Model calibration was successful and overall model performance is acceptable.
Hydrologic simulation results were in good to very good agreement with measured ﬂow
volume, peak ﬂow, and time to peak at the watershed outlet as well as several stations within
the watershed. Sediment transport simulation results were also in reasonable agreement with
the measured suspended solids concentration.

1. UPLAND EROSION PROCESSES
A brief review of upland hydrologic and sediment transport processes is ﬁrst presented. The
main hydrologic processes include: (a) rainfall precipitation and interception, (b) snowmelt,
(c) inﬁltration and transmission losses, (d) depression storage, and (e) overland and channel
ﬂow. Rainfall precipitation is usually determined from a network of point rain gage measure-
ments or remotely sensed from radars. Rain gage measurements are usually more reliable, but
radars usually provide a better spatial distribution of the rainfall patterns which may change
with time as storms move through the watershed area. Snowmelt can be determined from
radiative energy balance formulations or from empirical formulas based on daily temperature.
Inﬁltration is the downward transport of water from the surface to the subsurface. The rate
at which inﬁltration occurs may be affected by several factors including hydraulic
Upland Erosion Modeling
439

conductivity, capillary action, and gravity (percolation) as the soil matrix reaches saturation.
Many relationships [1–4] have been used to describe inﬁltration. The Green and Ampt
relationship is often used because of its ease of application. For single storm events, the recovery
of inﬁltration capacity by evapotranspiration and percolation can be neglected. Similarly, the
loss to evaporation or other processes can also be neglected for single storm events.
Water may be stored in depressions on the land surface as small, discontinuous surface pools.
In effect, the depression storage depth represents a threshold limiting the occurrence of overland
ﬂow. Note that water in depression storage is still subject to inﬁltration and evaporation.
1.1. Surface Runoff
Overland ﬂow occurs when the water depth on the overland plane exceeds the depression
storage threshold. Overland ﬂow is governed by conservation of mass (continuity) and
conservation of momentum. The two-dimensional (vertically integrated) continuity equation
for gradually varied ﬂow [5, 6] over a plane in rectangular (x, y) coordinates is:
∂h
∂t þ ∂qx
∂x þ ∂qy
∂y ¼ in  f ¼ ie
ð9:1Þ
where h ¼ surface water depth [L]
qx, qy ¼ unit discharge in the x- or y-direction ¼ Qx/Bx, Qy/By [L2 T1]
Qx, Qy ¼ ﬂow in the x- or y-direction [L3 T1]
Bx, By ¼ ﬂow width in the x- or y-direction [L]
in ¼ net (effective) rainfall rate at the surface [L T1]
f ¼ inﬁltration rate [L T1]
ie ¼ excess precipitation rate [L T1]
Momentum equations for the x- and y-directions may be derived by relating the net forces
per unit mass to ﬂow acceleration [5, 6]. In full form, with all terms retained, these equations
can be expressed in dimensionless form as the friction slope and are known as the Saint-
Venant equations. The full dynamic wave formulation of the Saint-Venant equations can
normally be simpliﬁed to the diffusive wave approximation (of the friction slope) for the x-
and y-directions:
Sfx ¼ S0x  ∂h
∂x
ð9:2Þ
Sfy ¼ S0y  ∂h
∂y
ð9:3Þ
where
Sfx, Sfy ¼ friction slope (energy grade line) in the x- or y-direction [dimensionless]
S0x, S0y ¼ ground surface slope in the x- or y-direction [dimensionless]
440
P.Y. Julien et al.

To solve the overland ﬂow equations for continuity and momentum, the hydraulic variables
must be deﬁned in terms of a depth-discharge relationship to describe ﬂow resistance.
Assuming that ﬂow is turbulent and resistance can be described using the Manning formula-
tion (in S.I. units), the depth-discharge relationships are:
qx ¼ αxhβ
ð9:4Þ
qy ¼ αyhβ
ð9:5Þ
αx ¼ Sfx1=2
n
ð9:6Þ
αy ¼ Sfy1=2
n
ð9:7Þ
where
αx, αy ¼ resistance coefﬁcient for ﬂow in the x- or y-direction [L1/3 T1]
β ¼ resistance exponent ¼ 5/3 [dimensionless]
n ¼ Manning roughness coefﬁcient [T L1/3]
Similarly, channel ﬂow can occur when the water depth in the channel exceeds the dead
storage threshold. Channel ﬂow is also governed by conservation of mass (continuity) and
conservation of momentum. At the watershed scale, it is convenient to represent channel
ﬂows in a watershed as one-dimensional (along the channel in the down-gradient direction).
The one-dimensional (laterally and vertically integrated) continuity equation for gradually
varied ﬂow along a channel is
∂Ac
∂t þ ∂Q
∂x ¼ ql
ð9:8Þ
where
Ac ¼ cross-sectional area of ﬂow [L2]
Q ¼ total discharge [L3 T1]
ql ¼ lateral unit ﬂow (into or out of the channel) [L2 T1]
Based on the momentum equation for the down-gradient direction and again neglecting
terms for local and convective acceleration, the diffusive wave approximation may be used
for the friction slope (see (9.2)). To solve the channel ﬂow equations for continuity and
momentum [5, 6], the Manning relationship may be used to describe ﬂow resistance:
Q ¼ 1

2=3Sf

ð9:9Þ

where
Rh ¼ hydraulic radius of ﬂow ¼ Ac/Pc [L]
Pc ¼ wetted perimeter of channel ﬂow [L]
1.2. Upland Erosion
Erosion is the entrainment (gain) of material from a bottom boundary into surface ﬂow
by the action of water. The erosion ﬂux may be expressed as a mass rate of particle
removal from the boundary over time and the concentration (bulk density) of particles at
the boundary:
Je ¼ vrCsb
ð9:10Þ
where
Je ¼ erosion ﬂux [M L2 T1]
vr ¼ resuspension (erosion) velocity [L T1]
Csb ¼ concentration of sediment at the bottom boundary (in the bed) [M L3]
Entrained material may be transported as either bedload or suspended load. However, for
overland sheet and rill ﬂows, bedload transport by rolling and sliding may predominate as
the occurrence of saltation and full suspension may be limited [7]. Entrainment rates may be
estimated from site-speciﬁc erosion rate studies or, in general, from the difference between
sediment transport capacity and advective ﬂuxes:
vr ¼
Jc  vaCs
ρb

Jc > vaCs

ð9:11Þ
where
vr ¼ resuspension (erosion) velocity [L T1]
Jc ¼ sediment transport capacity areal ﬂux [M L2 T1]
va ¼ advective (ﬂow) velocity (in the x- or y-direction) [L T1]
Cs ¼ concentration of sediment entrained in the ﬂow [M L3]
ρb ¼ bulk density of bed sediments [M L3]
In the overland plane, particles can be detached from the bulk soil matrix by raindrop
(splash) impact and entrained into the ﬂow by hydraulic action when the exerted shear stress
exceeds the stress required to initiate particle motion [7, 8]. The overland erosion process is
inﬂuenced by many factors including precipitation (rainfall) intensity and duration, runoff
length, surface slope, soil characteristics, vegetative cover, exerted shear stress, and particle
size. Raindrop impact may generally be neglected when ﬂow depths are greater than three
times the average raindrop diameter [6].

1.3. Soil Erosion Relationships
Extensive review of hillslope and watershed-scale soil erosion models is presented by [9,
10]. Soil erosion relationships range in complexity from simple empirical equations to
physically based models that are applicable over different spatial and temporal scales.
Common soil erosion relationships include the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and
its variants. The USLE [11] is an empirical based on a large database of ﬁeld plot measure-
ments. It was developed to predict soil losses from agriculture and is designed to estimate
long-term average annual soil loss associated with sheet and rill erosion using six factors that
are associated with climate, soil, topography, vegetation, and land use management:
A ¼ R ^K LS ^C ^P
ð9:12Þ
where
A ¼ average annual soil loss due to sheet and rill erosion (tons/acre/year) [M L2 T1]
R ¼ rainfall erosivity factor [dimensionless]
^K ¼ soil erodibility factor (tons/acre) [dimensionless]
LS ¼ slope length-gradient factor normalized to a ﬁeld with a standard length of 23.2 m
(76.2 ft) and a slope of 9 % [dimensionless]
^C ¼ cropping-management factor normalized to a tilled area that is continuously fallow
[dimensionless]
^P ¼ conservation practice factor normalized to straight-row farming up and down the slope
[dimensionless]
The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and later versions of the RUSLE
framework [12–14] have the same basic form as the original USLE but use extended
methods to calculate how soil erosion factors are determined. In particular, a subfactor
approach to determine crop management factors enables RUSLE to be applied to crops and
management systems that were not examined in the original experiments used to develop the
USLE. RUSLE is applicable to one-dimensional hillslopes that do not produce deposition as
a result of changes in slope gradient. RUSLE2 [15] provides an approach that estimates
erosion on a daily basis and accounts for deposition resulting from slope gradient changes
on hillslopes.
The Modiﬁed Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) [16] estimates soil erosion loss
(yield) for a single storm event by replacing the rainfall erosivity factor with a runoff energy
factor determined by ﬂow:
Ye ¼ αc Qvqp

βe ^K LS ^C ^P
ð9:13Þ
where
Ye ¼ sediment yield from an individual storm (tons/acre) [M L2]
Qv ¼ storm runoff volume (m3) [L3]
qp ¼ peak runoff rate (m3/s) [L3 T1]
Upland Erosion Modeling
443

αc ¼ empirical soil erosion coefﬁcient ¼ 11.8
βe ¼ empirical soil erosion exponent ¼ 0.56 [dimensionless]
More detailed review of the USLE family of soil erosion relationships is presented by [17].
1.4. Overland Sediment Transport Capacity Relationships
Building on the initial work of [7], Prosser and Rustomji [18] summarized relationships to
describe the sediment transport capacity of overland ﬂow. A generalized overland ﬂow
sediment transport capacity equation is
qs ¼ kqβs Sf
γs
ð9:14Þ
where
qs ¼ total sediment transport capacity [M L1 T1]
k ¼ empirically or theoretically derived coefﬁcient for sediment transport capacity
[M L1 T1]
q ¼ unit ﬂow (discharge) of water [L2 T1]
βs ¼ empirically or theoretically derived exponent for discharge [dimensionless]
Sf ¼ friction slope (local energy gradient) [dimensionless]
γs ¼ empirical or theoretically derived exponent for local energy gradient [dimensionless]
The sediment transport capacity coefﬁcient (k) represents the combined inﬂuence that
rainfall intensity, overland ﬂow, and landscape and particle characteristics such as soil
erodibility, inﬁltration, surface roughness, and vegetative cover have on sediment transport.
Extending the review of discharge (βs) and local energy gradient (γs) exponent values
presented by [7], more recent research by [18] concluded that values of 1.0  βs  1.8 and
0.9  γs  1.8 are generally applicable for use in soil erosion modeling.
Julien [6, 19] recommends a modiﬁed form of the Kilinc and Richardson relationship [20]
that includes soil erodibility, cover, and management practice terms from the Universal Soil
Loss Equation (USLE) [21] to estimate the total overland sediment transport capacity (for
both the x- and y-directions):
qs ¼ 1:542  108q2:035Sf

ð9:15Þ
Jc ¼ qs
Be
ð9:16Þ
where
qs ¼ total sediment transport capacity (kg/m s) [M L1 T1]
q ¼ unit ﬂow rate of water ¼ va h [L2 T1]
Sf ¼ friction slope [dimensionless]
^K ¼ USLE soil erodibility factor [dimensionless]
444
P.Y. Julien et al.

^C ¼ USLE soil cover factor [dimensionless]
^P ¼ USLE soil management practice factor [dimensionless]
Be ¼ width of eroding surface in ﬂow direction [L]
1.5. Channel Transport Capacity Relationships
In channels, sediment particles can be entrained into the ﬂow when the exerted shear stress
exceeds the stress required to initiate particle motion. For non-cohesive particles, the channel
erosion process is inﬂuenced by factors such as particle size, particle density, and bed forms.
For cohesive particles, the erosion process is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by interparticle forces
(such as surface charges that hold grains together and form cohesive bonds) and consolida-
tion. Total (bed material) load transport capacity relationships account for the both bedload
and suspended load components of sediment transport. Yang and Julien [19, 22] provide
summaries of numerous total load transport relationships. The Engelund and Hansen rela-
tionship [23] is considered a reasonable estimator of the total load:

Sf ¼ friction slope [dimensionless]
Rh ¼ hydraulic radius of ﬂow [L]
g ¼ gravitation acceleration [L T2]
dp ¼ particle diameter [L]
Jc ¼ advection ﬂux [M L2 T1]
Ac ¼ cross-sectional area of ﬂow [L2]
Ct ¼ concentration of entrained sediment particles at the transport capacity ¼ 106GCw/[G +
(1  G)Cw] (g/m3) [M L3]
It is worth noting that one feature common to both (9.15) and (9.17) is that the implicit
threshold for incipient motion is zero. This means that the transport capacity of any particle
will always be greater than zero, regardless of particle size or the exerted shear stress, as long
as the unit ﬂow or ﬂow velocity and friction slope are nonzero. This can lead to inconsistent
results when erosion rates are computed from sediment transport capacities. The inferred
erosion rate will almost always be greater than zero because the difference between the
Upland Erosion Modeling
445

transport capacity and advective ﬂux will nearly always be greater than zero. Consequently, a
nonzero erosion rate can be computed even when the exerted shear stress is far less than the
incipient motion threshold for the material. To address this limitation, an incipient motion
threshold can be added to the modiﬁed relationships [20, 23]:

h ¼ surface water depth [L]
1.6. Deposition
Deposition is the sedimentation (loss) of material entrained in a ﬂow to a bottom boundary
by gravity. The deposition process is inﬂuenced by many factors including particle density,
diameter and shape, and ﬂuid turbulence. The deposition ﬂux may be expressed as a mass rate
of particle removal from the water column over time and the concentration of sediment
particles that are entrained in the ﬂow:
Jd ¼ vseCs
ð9:21Þ
where
Jd ¼ deposition ﬂux [M L2 T1]
vse ¼ effective settling (deposition) velocity [L T1]
Cs ¼ concentration of sediment particles in the ﬂow [M L3]
Coarse particles (>62 μm) are typically inorganic and non-cohesive and generally have
large settling velocities under quiescent conditions. Numerous empirical relationships to
describe the non-cohesive particle settling velocities are available. Summaries of relation-
ships and settling velocities are presented by [19, 22]. For non-cohesive (ﬁne sand) particles
with diameters from 62 to 500 μm, the settling velocity [24] can be computed as

P.Y. Julien et al.

where
vs ¼ quiescent settling velocity [L T1]
ν ¼ kinematic viscosity of water [L2 T1]
d* ¼ dimensionless particle diameter [dimensionless]
dp ¼ particle diameter [L]
Medium particles (10 μm < dp < 62 μm) can vary in character. Inorganic particles may
behave in a non-cohesive manner. In contrast, organic particles (potentially including parti-
cles with organic coatings) may behave in a cohesive manner. Fine particles (<10 μm) often
behave in a cohesive manner. If behavior is largely non-cohesive, settling velocities may be
estimated as described by Julien [19]. If the behavior is cohesive, ﬂocculation may occur. Floc
size and settling velocity depend on the conditions under which the ﬂoc was formed
[25–27]. When ﬂocculation occurs, settling velocities of cohesive particles can be approxi-
mated by relationship of the form [25]:
vsf ¼ adfm
ð9:24Þ
where
vsf ¼ ﬂoc settling velocity (cm/s) [L T1]
a ¼ experimentally determined constant ¼ 8.4  103
df ¼ median ﬂoc diameter (μm) [L]
m ¼ experimentally determined constant ¼ 0.024
However, depending on ﬂuid shear, particle surface charge, and other conditions, ﬁne
particles may not ﬂocculate. Under conditions that limit ﬂoc formation, ﬁne particles can have
very small, near zero settling velocities.
As a result of turbulence and other factors, not all particles settling through a column of
ﬂowing water will necessarily reach the sediment-water interface or be incorporated into the
sediment bed [28]. Beuselinck [29] suggests that this process also occurs for the overland
plane. As a result, effective settling velocities in ﬂowing water can be much less than
quiescent settling velocities. The effective settling velocity of a particle can be described as
a reduction in the quiescent settling velocity by the probability of deposition [28, 30]:
vse ¼ Pdepvs
ð9:25Þ
where
vse ¼ effective settling velocity [L T1]
vs ¼ quiescent settling velocity [L T1]
Pdep ¼ probability of deposition [dimensionless]

2. WATERSHED MODELING
A range of watershed modeling methods and frameworks exist. Methods include unit
hydrograph/lumped parameter, advanced lumped parameter/semi-distributed, and fully
distributed, physically based approaches. Singh [31] presents descriptions of numerous
watershed models. Each approach has characteristic strengths and limitations, and there are
trade-offs between the spatial and temporal detail used to represent physical processes and
model performance. Although methods used differ, all model frameworks reviewed have the
ability to simulate runoff. Some frameworks can simulate soil erosion. A few models can
also simulate stream sediment transport (erosion and deposition) processes. Even fewer have
the specialized capabilities to simulate chemical transport.
Key milestones in the development of fully distributed, physically based watershed models
include CASC2D (and CASC2D-SED) [5, 32–35], GSSHA [36], the SHE series of models
[37–40], and TREX [41, 42]. The starting point for TREX development was CASC2D. Like
CASC2D, the TREX framework is an event-based model that simulates overland ﬂow,
surface soil erosion and deposition, stream ﬂow, and sediment transport through streams.
As part of the TREX development, hydrologic and sediment transport components of
CASC2D were expanded to support chemical transport. A complete review of hydrologic,
sediment transport (and chemical transport) processes to describe the physics behind the
model is provided by [41] and [43]. Further descriptions of CASC2D and TREX follow.
2.1. CASC2D
CASC2D (including CASC2D-SED) is a fully distributed, physically based, event-oriented
model that simulates rainfall, interception, inﬁltration, overland ﬂow, channel ﬂow, as well
as sediment erosion and deposition [5, 32–35, 44]. For surface waters, ﬂow routing is
performed using the diffusive wave approximation and is two-dimensional overland and
one-dimensional in channels. CASC2D does not include groundwater ﬂow processes other
than inﬁltration and Hortonian overland ﬂow. However, it can be directly coupled with
GIS-based site characterization data obtained from remote sensing sources.
CASC2D has been applied at a wide variety of spatial scales from large river basins
(12,000 km2) to moderate watersheds (560 km2) [45] to small watersheds (20–30 km2)
[44]. Overland and channel erosion are computed using the modiﬁed form of the Kilinc-
Richardson [20, 23, 33]. Up to three solids classes can be simulated [44]. Chemical transport
and fate is not simulated. The CASC2D source code is publicly available.
2.2. TREX
A generalized conceptual framework for the TREX watershed model is presented in
Fig. 9.1. TREX (Two-dimensional Runoff, Erosion, and Export) is a spatially distributed,
physically based model that can be used to simulate precipitation, overland runoff, channel
ﬂow, soil erosion, stream sediment transport, and chemical transport and fate at the watershed
scale [41–43, 46]. TREX combines surface hydrology and sediment transport features from
448
P.Y. Julien et al.

the CASC2D watershed model [33, 35, 44] with chemical transport features from the WASP/
IPX series of water quality models [47, 48].
Hydrologic processes simulated are (a) rainfall and snowfall (precipitation), interception,
snowmelt, and surface storage; (b) inﬁltration and transmission loss; and (c) overland and
channel ﬂow. Model state variables are water depth in the overland plane and stream
channels. Precipitation can be uniform or distributed in both time and space and can also be
speciﬁed using several grid-based formats to facilitate radar precipitation data use. When
spatially distributed precipitation is simulated, areal estimates are interpolated from point
gage data using an inverse distance weighting approach. Interception and surface storage are
simulated as equivalent depths. Inﬁltration and transmission loss rates are simulated using the
Green and Ampt relationship [1]. Overland ﬂow is two-dimensional and simulated using the
diffusive wave approximation. Channel ﬂow is one-dimensional and is also simulated using
the diffusive wave approximation.
Sediment transport processes simulated are (a) advection-diffusion, (b) erosion and depo-
sition, and (c) bed elevation adjustment. All processes are simulated in the overland plane and
stream channels. Model state variables are solid concentrations in overland runoff, soil,
stream ﬂow, and stream bed sediment. Any number of particle size classes can be simulated.

In ﬂoodplain areas, water and transported constituents are transferred between the overland
plane and channel network based on the difference in water surface elevations. Floodplain
transfers are bidirectional. Water and transported sediments and chemicals move into stream
channels by overland ﬂow and can return to the overland plane when water levels in the
stream exceed bank height. Similarly, materials can be moved from the sediment bed and can
be delivered to the land surface by ﬂoodwaters. TREX source code, a user manual, reference
material, and example ﬁles are freely available on the web.
3. WATERSHED MODEL APPLICATION
To demonstrate watershed modeling concepts, a case study application using TREX
[41–43, 46] is presented. TREX was applied to the Naesung Stream watershed in Korea
and was used to simulate hydrology and sediment transport. Soil erosion results from the
model were used to identify erosion-prone areas.
3.1. Naesung Stream Site Description and Database
The
Naesung
Stream
watershed
is
located
in
North
Gyeongsang
Province
(Gyeongsangbuk-do), Korea, and drains an area of approximately 1,815 km2 within the
Nakdong River basin. Land surface elevations range from 54 to 1,420 m above mean sea

level. The average channel slope of the stream is 0.009 m/m. The database for this watershed
includes rainfall measurements reported at 22 monitoring stations, stream ﬂows reported
at 9 stations, suspended solids data at 11 stations, sediment discharges at 3 stations, and
sediment yields estimated at 4 stations. Rainfall and ﬂow data were reported on an hourly
basis and were available for 2008 and 2009 as well as other periods. Maps displaying
locations of the Naesung Stream watershed, stream network, and monitoring stations are
presented in Fig. 9.2. Stations at Hyangseok, Miho, Wolho, and Yecheon provide stream ﬂow
measurements for subbasins within the watershed as well as near the watershed outlet.
Stations at Hyangseok and Songriwon provide sediment discharge and yield estimates.
3.2. Naesung Stream Model Setup
The model requires data to describe watershed boundaries, the stream channel network,
land surface elevations, soils, land use, and related information describing physical processes
that control runoff and soil and sediment transport for any given rainfall event. All data were
detailed in the Naesung Stream Watershed Data Collection [49] and Naesung Stream Water-
shed Bank Erosion [50] reports. Data included geographic information system (GIS) ﬁles for
ArcGIS 9.3 [51], HEC-RAS hydraulic model ﬁles [52], as well as additional data such as
stage-discharge relationships and sediment-discharge information.

channel network (ﬂow path links) at the 150-m scale.

Watershed land surface elevations were deﬁned using digital elevation model (DEM)
data. Soil types, land uses, and their spatial distributions were deﬁned according to the
associations and classes that occur within the watershed. DEM, soil, and land use data were
provided at a 30-m resolution (1 arc s) and subsequently processed for model use at a 150-m
grid scale (i.e., where each model cell is 150 m by 150 m). The 150-m grid scale was
selected to improve model execution speed and reduce time required for simulations. Model
grid scale affects accuracy of hydrology and sediment transport simulations [53]. Compared
to higher resolution conﬁgurations (e.g., 30 or 90 m), use of a 150-m grid scale permits
reasonable simulation of both hydrology and soil erosion. At the 150-m scale, the Naesung
Stream watershed is comprised of 80,690 grid cells. The watershed DEM was also
smoothed using a custom computer program created to reduce effects of anomalous
elevations that resulted in deep pits in isolated areas of the watershed. Raster maps of
watershed elevations, soil types, land uses, and the stream channel network at the 150-m
scale are presented in Fig. 9.3.
Watershed boundaries and the stream channel network were delineated using TauDEM 4.0
[54]. For consistency with the Naesung Stream hydrography layer provided by Myongji
University, the hydrography layer was converted from polygons to polylines in ArcGIS and
then used to “burn” stream locations into the DEM prior to delineating the channel network.
Using this approach, the stream network was deﬁned as 53 links comprised of 2,135 nodes,
yielding a total stream length of approximately 34.8 km and a drainage density of 0.2 km of
stream length per square kilometer of watershed (0.2 km/km2). Physical dimensions of the
channel network (e.g., width, bank height, side slope) were determined from data contained in
HEC-RAS geometry ﬁles for Naesung Stream.
Soil types and land use classes were deﬁned based on major associations and classiﬁcations
present in the watershed as described in the GIS ﬁles. In the “simple” GIS ﬁles, soil types and
land use classes with similar characteristics were combined to simplify model setup. Soil
types in the model were also modiﬁed to include rice paddy ﬁelds as a distinct soil type.
Inclusion of paddy ﬁelds as a soil type was based on research indicating that paddy ﬁelds
are often underlain by soil layers with lower hydraulic conductivities and higher clay
contents [55].
Interception depths and depression storage depths for each land use class were assigned
based on expected land use characteristics described in the literature [56–58]. For simplicity,
depression storage depths for all land use classes other than paddy ﬁelds were set to zero. The
paddy ﬁelds land use was speciﬁed to have 6 cm of depression storage to account for berms
surrounding paddy ﬁelds [55]. Initial values for overland and channel ﬂow resistance (Man-
ning n) values were determined by land use and substrate [59, 60]. Manning n values for
stream channels were regularized by assigning values into two classes: (1) rocky substrate
streams (higher ﬂow resistance) and (2) wider, sand bed streams (lower ﬂow resistance). Final
ﬂow resistance values were determined by calibration.
Size distributions of particles comprising soils and sediments of the site vary with the strata
from which they originate. Surface soils are typically dominated by silts with considerable
fractions of sands and clays as well as gravel and other rock fragments. Bed sediments are
452
P.Y. Julien et al.

dominated by sands and ﬁner gravel. Overall, particles sizes range from coarse gravels and
cobbles to silts and clays. There is a trade-off between the number of particle state variables
(classes) used to represent solids and computational time needed for a simulation. Processing
time increases as the number of state variables increases. Given the range of particle types
present in the watershed, solids were simulated as four classes: (a) coarse gravels and coarser
(“gravel-cobble”); (b) ﬁne to coarse gravel (“gravel”); (c) coarse sands to ﬁne gravels
(“sands”); and (d) ﬁner sands, silts, and smaller particles (“silt/clay”).
Properties of each particle class, soils, and sediments were deﬁned from values tabulated in
the Myongji University database and supplemented by other literature as noted below.
Properties speciﬁed include (a) effective particle diameter dp, (b) particle speciﬁc gravity
G, (c) particle fall velocity vs, (d) soil and sediment porosity, (e) soil effective hydraulic
conductivity Kh, (f) soil capillary suction head Hc, (g) soil erodibility ^K , (h) erosion (incipient
motion) thresholds for soil and sediment expressed as critical velocities vc, and (i) grain size
distributions for soils and sediments. Summaries of these properties, including physical
characteristics of the channel network, are presented in Tables 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3.
Effective hydraulic conductivities and capillary suction heads were determined from soil
types [61]. Final effective hydraulic conductivity values were determined by calibration.
Soil erodibility ^K , cover factor ^C , and practice factor ^P values were estimated based on
literature values summarized by [11, 19]. Soil effective porosities were estimated from
maximum moisture content and ﬁeld moisture content values for each soil type. Sediment
porosity was assumed to be 0.5 uniformly in the riverbed.
In the overland plane, the soil column was deﬁned as two layers with a total thickness of
15 cm (a 5-cm surface layer and a 10-cm subsurface layer). This total soil thickness is
reasonable because a single event is not expected to completely denude the land surface of
erodible, unconsolidated soils. In the channel network, the sediment bed was also deﬁned as
two layers with a total thickness of 20 cm (two 10-cm layers) underlain by non-erodible
hardpan. This bed conﬁguration was selected to represent conditions where particles from the
streambed may have limited availability and that supply limited sediment transport occurs.
Representation of the bed as two relatively thin layers over hardpan is reasonable because it is
possible that large storm events could cause transport sufﬁcient to erode all unconsolidated

material from the bed in some locations. However, the maximum depth of bed scour
(degradation) that can occur will be limited by the total thickness of bed sediment at the
start of the simulation (i.e., 20 cm for this model setup).
It should be noted that several parameters summarized in Tables 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 were
subject to calibration (e.g., effective hydraulic conductivity, Manning n, soil moisture deﬁcit).
Values reported in these tables represent model setup from calibration to the July 24–26,
2008, and July 8–10, 2009, storm events. Model initial conditions that must be speciﬁed
include baseﬂow and initial water depths, initial soil moisture deﬁcit, depth of inﬁltrated water
(soil moisture conditions), and suspended solids concentrations for each particle class. Soil
moisture conditions were estimated based on review of rainfall records preceding the July
2008 and July 2009 storms. Conditions preceding the July 2008 storm were relatively wet as
there was appreciable rain (i.e., more than 100 mm) in the days before the event. Conditions
preceding the July 2009 storm were relatively dry as there was little rain (i.e., less than
10 mm) before the event. Soil moisture deﬁcit values were reﬁned by calibration. For
simplicity, the initial depth of inﬁltrated water was assumed to be zero. Initial water depths
on the overland plain were assumed to be zero except for rice paddy areas. For rice paddies,
the initial water depth was assumed to be 3 cm for the July 2008 storm and 1 cm for the July
2009 storm. Initial water depths for paddy ﬁelds were reﬁned by calibration. Initial suspended
solids concentrations for the “silt/clay” particle class ranged from 1 g/m3 (mg/L) to 10 g/m3
and were zero for the remaining three particle classes.
Baseﬂow (i.e., stream ﬂow for periods preceding storm events) was estimated by reviewing
ﬂow records at monitoring gages throughout the watershed. Flow conditions for the July
24–26, 2008, and July 8–10, 2009, storms appeared to be similar, so the same values were
used for both events. The channel network includes 21 headwater branches (i.e., branches that
are upstream of all other portions of the channel network). Baseﬂow was represented as a ﬂow
point source to the head of each headwater link in the channel network. Baseﬂow at
Hyangseok was estimated to be 40 m3/s based on ﬂow monitoring data at Hyangseok.

3.3. Model Calibration Results
3.3.1. Hydrology
The watershed model was calibrated by simulating rainfall, runoff, and sediment transport
for two storms: (a) July 24–26, 2008, and (b) July 8–10, 2009. Rainfall for these events was
deﬁned by hourly measurements at 22 gages across the watershed. All simulations were 96 h
in duration and included each storm’s rainfall period (up to 48 h) and an additional 48 h to
allow simulation of the recession limb of the hydrograph and return to baseﬂow conditions. As
part of calibration, model parameters were iteratively varied until simulation results were in
rough agreement with measured ﬂows and sediment concentrations. Agreement between
model results and measurements was assessed by graphical and statistical comparisons.
Fig. 9.4. Simulated and measured ﬂows at Hyangseok: July 24–26, 2008, storm.
Fig. 9.5. Simulated and measured ﬂows at Hyangseok: July 08–10, 2009, storm.
456
P.Y. Julien et al.

The hydrologic calibration was performed by varying the following parameters: effective
hydraulic conductivity Kh, channel and overland ﬂow resistance (Manning n), and initial soil
moisture deﬁcit θ. Effective hydraulic conductivity affects the total volume of runoff gener-
ated. Flow resistance inﬂuences the timing and magnitude of ﬂow. Soil moisture conditions
also affect runoff volume and the timing of ﬂow through the system. As part of hydrologic
calibration efforts, 12–18 individual model simulations were completed for each storm.
Calibrated hydrologic simulation results and measurements for the July 2008 and July 2009
storms are presented in Figs. 9.4 and 9.5 respectively. Statistical summaries comparing
simulated and measured values for total ﬂow volume, peak ﬂow, and time to peak ﬂow
metrics are presented in Table 9.4. Statistical analyses include relative percent difference
(RPD), Nash-Sutcliffe efﬁciency coefﬁcient (NSEC), and root mean square error (RMSE).
Model performance was generally good.
3.3.2. Sediment
Calibrated sediment transport simulation results and measurements for the July 2008 and
July 2009 storms are presented as functions of ﬂow in Figs. 9.6 and 9.7. Simulated and
estimated values are presented for the Hyangseok station. Estimated values presented on these
graphs represent values estimated from ﬂow using reported sediment-discharge relationships
at these stations. Tabular summaries comparing simulated, measured, and estimated values
for suspended solids concentration and sediment yield rates are presented in Tables 9.5
and 9.6, respectively.
Simulated suspended solids concentrations are roughly within a factor of 2 to 3 of values
estimated from ﬂow and sediment-discharge relationships at Hyangseok. However, simulated
suspended solids concentrations appear to be much smaller than estimated concentrations
across the ranges of ﬂows at Songriwon. Some of the differences between simulated values
and concentrations estimated from sediment-discharge relationships may be attributable to
uncertainty introduced by extrapolating discharge relationships beyond the ﬂow ranges for
which they were developed. Some differences between simulated and estimated concentra-
tions may also be attributable to hydrologic model overestimation and underestimation errors
at Songriwon as well as Hyangseok.
In Table 9.6, reported sediment yields and estimated yields represent values calculated using
ﬂow and sediment-discharge relationships for each station and normalized by drainage area.
Similarly, simulated sediment yields were calculated using simulated ﬂow and simulated
suspended solids concentrations and normalized by drainage area. As a broad generality, simu-
lated sediment yields are within the range of reported and estimated yields. However, differences
between reported and estimated sediment yield values are large, suggesting large uncertainties in
the underlying database used for model development. Given these potential uncertainties in
measurements, sediment transport model performance was considered to be reasonable.
3.4. Design Storm Application
The calibrated model was applied to design storm rainfall to simulate runoff and sediment
transport that would occur for a very large storm event. As speciﬁed by Myongji University,

this design storm delivers 300 mm of rain that is uniformly distributed over the entire

Visualizations of water depth and total suspended solids at Naesung Stream are presented
in Figs. 9.8 and 9.9. Surface runoff in the main channel can be observed at 4 h and is dominant
at 8 h after the beginning of the storm. Upland erosion losses are clearly visible from the
mountain areas 4 h after the beginning of the storm. High sediment concentrations then reach
the valleys after 8 h and sediment settling takes place after 8 h.

Abstract There has long existed a dichotomy in the ﬁeld of water resources systems
engineering between simulation and optimization modeling, with each approach having its
own advantages and disadvantages. Simulation models provide a means of accurately
representing the complex physiochemical, socioeconomic, and legal-administrative behavior
of complex water resources systems, but lack the capability of systematically determining
optimal water planning and management decisions. Optimization models, on the other hand,
excel at automatic determination of optima, while often sacriﬁcing the accurate representation
of the underlying water system behavior. Various means of effectively establishing a synergy
between simulation and optimization models that accentuates their advantages while mini-
mizing their shortcomings have evolved from the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence within the
province of computer science. Artiﬁcial intelligence was deﬁned by John McCarthy in 1955
as “the science and engineering of making intelligent decisions.” Machine learning, as a

1. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
The focus of water resources systems engineering is treating the natural environment, the
built infrastructure, and regulatory institutions associated with water resources planning and
management as an integrated, highly interactive system. The goals are to provide reliable,
clean, and inexpensive water supply for municipalities, industry, and irrigated agriculture
through conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources; mitigate the impacts of
extreme ﬂood and drought events, preserve and enhance aquatic ecosystems, and produce
clean, efﬁcient, and renewable energy through hydropower generation; enhance commerce
through maintenance of navigable waters; and provide important recreational opportunities
while preserving and maintaining natural habitats and the environment. The need for applying
systems engineering to structural and nonstructural measures for achievement of these goals
arises since water in its unregulated state is rarely available in the preferred quantity,
acceptable quality, at the appropriate place, and at the desired time.
Challenges arise when considering that these goals are often in competition and highly
conﬂicting, compounded by stochastic hydrology, long-term climate-change impacts, uncer-
tain future demands, and unpredictable economic and sociopolitical conditions. Further,
appropriate application of systems engineering greatly expands the scale and scope of water
planning and management to consider integrated modeling of entire river basins and even
interconnected multi-basin systems. The long-term sustainability of water resources devel-
opment projects and management plans is contingent on multidisciplinary consideration of all
the important physical, hydrologic, environmental, institutional, legal, sociopolitical, and
economic impacts. Decision support systems [1] and shared vision modeling approaches [2]

attempt to consider these multidimensional impacts and encourage stakeholder involvement
in model development as a means of establishing compromise and consensus.
As reviewed by Labadie [3], traditional water resources systems engineering has empha-
sized the application of simulation and optimization models in water resources planning and
management, but rarely with full integration of the two modeling approaches. Physically
based simulation models, also known as descriptive models, are able to accurately represent
complex spatially distributed, dynamic processes governing hydrologic and hydraulic surface
water ﬂows; hydroelectric energy production, groundwater and stream-aquifer interaction;
contaminant transport, aquatic habitat conditions, and ecosystem health, as long as an
adequate database for model calibration and veriﬁcation is available.
Simulation models help answer what if questions regarding performance of water resources
planning and management alternatives and are useful for examining the long-term reliability,
vulnerability, and resilience [4] of proposed strategies through Monte Carlo analysis. Simulation
models, however, are incapable of directly prescribing the best or optimum strategies, whereas
prescriptive optimization models systematically select optimal solutions, orfamilies ofsolutions,
under agreed-upon objectives and constraints. Unfortunately, traditional optimization methods
applied in water resources systems engineering often impose simplifying assumptions and
approximations regarding the intrinsic behavior of the modeled system, such as the requirement
of linear relations in the formulation of linear programming problems. Since these assumptions
may represent sizable departures from the real-world behavior, the ideal is to somehow combine
the best attributes of simulation with the prescriptive advantages of optimization.
Machine learning [5] is a branch of artiﬁcial intelligence with the capability of providing
the desired linkage of simulation and optimization in water resources systems engineering
so as to combine the most desirable characteristics of both modeling approaches. Although
there are many aspects of machine learning, the focus here is on agent-based modeling tools
for learning optimal decisions and management rule structures under conﬂicting goals
through interaction with a simulated, dynamically changing process environment.
Reinforcement learning [6] is a machine learning technique for solving sequential decision
problems that combines concepts from artiﬁcial intelligence, cognitive science, and opera-
tions research. With a mathematical foundation similar to dynamic programming and Markov
decision processes, reinforcement learning acquires knowledge of the optimal policies that
maximize the long-term reward or returns as conditioned on the state of the system environ-
ment and the immediate reward obtained from operational and management decisions. Unlike
traditional methods of stochastic dynamic programming, transition probabilities and rewards
are not assumed to be explicitly known a priori, but rather are learned through (simulated)
long-term interaction with the stochastic environment. The Q-Learning method of reinforce-
ment learning is applied to the Geum River basin located in South Korea through linkage with
a well-calibrated simulation model of the river basin network.
Artiﬁcial neural networks provide another means of applying machine learning for linking
realistic simulation and optimization models. Optimal real-time regulation of ﬂows and
in-line storage in combined sewer systems is challenging due to the need for complex
optimization models integrated with accurate urban stormwater runoff prediction and fully
dynamic hydraulic simulation of sewer ﬂows over a citywide extent. For real-time control of
in-system storage through regulation of control gates and pump stations, these models need to

be executed within short time increments as rainfall and sewer ﬂow measurements/forecasts
are updated during an ongoing storm event with the potential for surcharging combined
sewers and spilling untreated raw sewage to adjacent receiving waters. Unfortunately,
execution of the optimal control model as linked to a spatially distributed, fully dynamic
hydraulic sewer simulation model, exceeds the limited time constraint for real-time regula-
tion. An artiﬁcial neural network is therefore applied to learning optimal control strategies
from training data sets generated through numerous off-line executions of the realistic
optimization-simulation modeling system applied to a wide range of historical, overﬂow-
producing storm events. Online implementation of the resulting neural-optimal control model
provides rapid execution to facilitate adaptive real-time control through incorporation of
updated rainfall and sewer ﬂow conditions as provided by the SCADA system. The neural-
optimal control algorithm is demonstrated in a simulated real-time control experiment for the
King County combined sewer system, Seattle, Washington, USA.
A key element in water resources planning is the incorporation of simulated optimal
operations of planned facilities within the broader project selection, sizing, and design
problem. This effective linkage of planning and operations results in reduced facility sizing
and costs of achieving the desired goals by incorporating the simulation of spatially distrib-
uted, real-time operational policies for the planned system. Machine learning is applied in this
context by use of a genetic algorithm for optimizing the planned facilities, but which also
learns the imbedded optimal fuzzy operational rule structures by simulating the long-term,
risk-based performance of the planned system under stochastic hydrology.
Similar to many coastal ecosystems, the St. Lucie Estuary located on the east coast of South
Florida has been adversely impacted by magniﬁed stormwater runoff due to expanding
urbanization. A suite of models dealing with watershed hydrology, reservoir optimization,
and estuary salinity and ecology are applied for optimal sizing and operation of stormwater
reservoirs. The multipurpose stormwater control facilities provide for hydrologic restoration
to approximate natural hydrologic conditions for recovery of salinity-sensitive biota in the
Estuary, as well as provide supplemental irrigation water supply and pollution control through
connected stormwater treatment areas. Rather than simply attempting to control individual
storm events, the goal is to match the long-term frequency distribution of mean monthly

of the stormwater drainage network to minimize the sizing and learn the fuzzy operating rules

2. STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION OF MULTIRESERVOIR SYSTEMS
VIA REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
2.1. Introduction
According to the World Commission on Dams [7], many large-scale water storage
projects worldwide are failing to produce the expected beneﬁts that provided the economic
justiﬁcation for their development. This is often due to an inordinate focus on project
planning and construction, with inadequate attention placed on operational issues and

optimal coordinated management of new projects with existing reservoirs in the river basin.
Performance of the project is also undermined when new unplanned uses arise not originally
considered in the project authorization. Examples include retroﬁtting water supply reser-
voirs with hydropower generation plants to increase energy production, adding water supply
uses to projects initially designed for ﬂood control purposes only, and modifying reservoir
operations for augmentation of streamﬂows to maintain and enhance downstream aquatic
ecosystems.
The current moratorium on dam construction in the USA and many other countries has
shifted the emphasis from development of expensive new water projects to improving the
operational effectiveness and efﬁciency of existing systems for maximizing beneﬁcial use
[3]. In most cases, current reservoir operation policies fail to consider the need for integrated
water resources management over an entire river basin. Although a system-wide focus has the
potential for signiﬁcantly improving operational effectiveness, the development of adaptive
strategies for coordinated regulation of multiple reservoirs under complex stochastic hydrol-
ogy continues to be a challenging problem in water resources systems modeling. Further
complications arise from conﬂicting objectives, climate-change impacts, and uncertain
demand forecasts.
Most methods of stochastic optimization of multireservoir systems can be categorized as
implicit or explicit methods [3]. Implicit stochastic optimization (ISO) is essentially a Monte
Carlo analysis procedure whereby deterministic optimization is performed over long histor-
ical or stochastically generated inﬂow sequences in order to infer general feedback reservoir
operating rules. Although efﬁcient optimization algorithms abound for use in ISO, the
extraction of usable optimal policies from the results is not guaranteed. Explicit stochastic
optimization (ESO) methods overcome this problem by operating directly on stochastic
models of the hydrologic processes rather than historical sequences of hydrologic time series
data. A Markov decision problem is formulated and solved without the presumption of perfect
foreknowledge of future hydrologic events, and a posteriori regression analyses or inference
methods on the optimization results are not required.
Stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) is one of the most popular explicit stochastic
optimization methods for reservoir system analysis but suffers from several disadvantages.
Discretization of the state variables (i.e., reservoir storage and/or reservoir inﬂow forecasts)
and decision variables (i.e., reservoir releases) is generally required, and probability distribu-
tions of the underlying hydrologic processes must be known a priori or deﬁned by Bayesian
estimation methods. Because of this, the computational burden associated with SDP is
signiﬁcantly greater than the ISO approach, combined with the difﬁculty of explicitly
identifying the underlying probability distributions governing the spatially and temporally
correlated hydrologic inﬂows to multireservoir systems. In spite of these challenges, success-
ful applications of SDP are described in Wang and Adams [8], Braga et al. [9], and Tejada-
Guibert et al. [10].
Reinforcement learning (RL) from the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence represents a body of
methodologies with the potential for overcoming the computational challenges of stochastic
optimization of multireservoir systems. RL employs a depth-ﬁrst search strategy that
Advances in Water Resources Systems Engineering: Applications of Machine. . .
471

alleviates to some extent the curse of dimensionality problem that has long plagued applica-
tions of SDP, where visits to all reachable system states occur over many trials or episodes.
This is in contrast with the breadth-ﬁrst solution strategy of SDP requiring exhaustive
calculation of the DP optimal value or cost-to-go function for all discrete combinations of
system states, many of which may not be operationally attainable. In addition, a learning
process embodied within RL acquires implicit knowledge of the underlying stochastic
structure of river basin hydrologic inﬂows, rather than requiring known transition
probability matrices.
The advantages of reinforcement learning are demonstrated through application to the
Geum River basin in South Korea, as described in Lee and Labadie [11]. A well-calibrated
simulation model of the Geum River system is linked with a reinforcement learning algorithm
for the development of accurate and realistic reservoir operating rules. Performance of the
optimal operating rules developed by RL is compared with those developed through applica-
tion of alternative approaches including implicit stochastic dynamic programming [3] and
sampling stochastic dynamic programming [12]. The intense computational challenges of
applying SDP to a complex multireservoir system prevented its inclusion in the comparative
analysis.
2.2. Reinforcement Learning
Rather than presuming explicit knowledge of the stochastic processes governing hydro-
logic inﬂows, reinforcement learning attempts to implicitly learn the underlying stochastic
behavior, which may be gained in an actual online environment or through simulated
experience using a system dynamics model. Just as behavioral psychologists have attempted
to model the ability of animals to learn appropriate actions in response to particular stimuli
based on associated rewards or punishments, Kaelbling et al. [13] in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial
intelligence created a framework for a computational agent to learn the best behavior through
trial-and-error interactions with an environment. As stated by Sutton and Barto (6; p. 3–4),
reinforcement learning is “. . .learning how to map situations to actions so as to maximize a
numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which actions to take, as in most forms of
machine learning, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying
them. In the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate
reward, but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards. These two
characteristics—trial-and-error search and delayed reward—are the two most important
distinguishing features of reinforcement learning.”
A reinforcement learning system consists of an agent, the environment, and their interac-
tions (Fig. 10.1). In contrast with supervised learning, reinforcement learning requires the
agent to discover from experience those actions resulting in optimal long-term reward. And
unlike unsupervised learning, there is some feedback available as to the quality of the actions
or decisions in RL. The agent initially has no understanding of the environment and is usually
unable to observe all its aspects and intricacies. The agent therefore attempts to explore the
environment so as to both discover new actions and exploit actions that have been found to be
effective through past experience.

2.3. Bellman Equation
Stochastic optimization of multireservoir systems is achieved by determining optimal
feedback release policies a
t (st,qt) conditioned on the current storage and inﬂow states st, qt
that maximize the expected total current and discounted future beneﬁts under a stochastic
hydrologic regime:

where E{} is the statistical expectation operator; st ¼ (s1t,s2t, . . .,sNt) is the system state
vector representing discrete storage contents in N reservoirs at the beginning of period t;
at ¼ (a1t,a2t, . . .,aNt) is the action or decision vector of controlled reservoir releases during
period t; rt(st,st + 1,at) is the return or reward for period t from action at performed in state st
and resulting in state st + 1 based on random net inﬂow qt during period t, which is assumed to
include evaporation and other losses; γ is the factor (<1) for discounting future returns in
relation to immediate returns; and T is the total number of time periods in the operational
horizon. In this formulation, the immediate return rt(st,st + 1,at) in period t is shown as a
function of end-of-period storage st + 1 since criteria such as hydropower production should be
calculated based on average head over the period for accurate solution.
System state transitions are governed by a multidimensional state dynamics equation:

where C is the system connectivity matrix for routing upstream controlled releases and spills

cij ¼ 1 if reservoir i is directly upstream of reservoir j; otherwise, cij ¼ 0 for i, j ¼ 1, . . ., N);
spt is the vector of uncontrolled spills due to restrictions on reservoir storage space, discharge
outlet capacity, and downstream channel capacity; and dt are required demands, diversions, or
depletions from the system. In some formulations, demands can be treated as decision vari-
ables and included in the objective function as related to beneﬁts of supplying water. Initial
storage levels s1 are assumed known, and all ﬂow units in (10.2) are expressed in storage units
per time interval.

conditional distributions can be used that consider lag-n serial correlations of seasonal
inﬂows, but each lag requires the addition of a state variable in (10.5) representing previous
season inﬂows. Assuming T is sufﬁciently large, Ross [15] has proven that the value iteration
process results in convergence to optimal seasonal (e.g., calendar month) stationary release
policies, after a ﬁnite number of updates k for the discounted case, as feedback decision rules
that maximize the total expected discounted return over a long-term operational horizon:

2.4. Q-Learning Method
As stated previously, the primary computational challenges of SDP are the combinatorially
explosive number of evaluations of the dynamic programming optimal value function V(st) for
all possible discrete states st at each stage of the iterative updating process, as well as the
requirement for a priori speciﬁcation of the inﬂow probability distributions p(qt) which may not
be accurate representations of the complex underlying stochastic hydrologic processes.
Although there are several reinforcement learning methods for solving Markov decision prob-
lems, the most popular is the Q-Learning method [6]. Q-Learning uses the Q-function version of
the Bellman equation but updates the Q-function as a means of overcoming these problems:

ð10:9Þ
Rather than performing the exhaustive optimization of (10.7), Q-Learning attempts to learn
by experience what the best actions are based on a long sequence of historical or synthetically
generated monthly inﬂow data sets qt, t ¼ 1, . . ., K. Much like Monte Carlo analysis, this
avoids the need for a priori deﬁnition of the underlying probability distributions. The Q-
function is therefore updated according to:

ð10:10Þ
over many long sequences of the inﬂow data sets qt, t ¼ 1, . . ., K, rather than calculating the
expected value as in (10.7).
Most often, actions obtained from the current policy from (10.9) after k updates are used,
which is called exploitation. However, Q-Learning is an off-policy method, meaning that there
is a small probability of a random action being selected that is not deﬁned by (10.9), which is

referred to as exploration. This alleviates the need for evaluating the optimal value function
for all possible combinations of storage states st, many of which may not be physically
attainable during long-term operation of the system. In contrast with the breadth-ﬁrst search
procedure of stochastic dynamic programming, Q-Learning performs a depth-ﬁrst search
process which helps alleviate the so-called curse of dimensionality associated with dynamic
programming and Markov decision processes. After many updates, all possible reachable
states are eventually visited during the Q-Learning search process.
2.5. ε-Greedy Actions
Application of Q-Learning begins with initial policies that are assumed to be greedy. Using
the ﬁrst 12 months of the inﬂow data series qt, t ¼ 1, . . ., 12, greedy policies are restricted to
maximizing only the immediate returns and ignore future implications of those actions:

That is, greedy policies are restricted to maximizing only the expected immediate returns
and ignore future implications of those actions.
The associated optimal value functions based on the greedy policies are also initialized:

than greedy (i.e., deﬁned by the current policy) will be selected. Without allowing some
exploration of non-greedy policies, convergence to suboptimal policies may occur. In effect,
the exploitation characteristics of greedy policies are softened by the exploration capabilities
of ε-greedy policies. To encourage exploration of alternative actions in the early stages, ε is
often set to higher values initially and then decreased in subsequent episodes as learning is
strengthened.

The update process of (10.13) continues for K episodes, until optimal policies a
t (st)
become stationary, or Vk(st) (for t ¼ 1, . . ., T) has not improved after several episodes.
Watkins and Dayan [16] proved that “Q-Learning converges to the optimum action values
with probability 1 so long as all actions are repeatedly sampled in all states and the action
values are represented discretely.” Although a large number of episodes may be required for
convergence, computer CPU time only increases approximately linearly with the number
of episodes.
2.6. Temporal-Difference Learning
An alternative Q-Learning update uses temporal difference (TD) learning to perform an
incremental update, where (10.14) replaces (10.13):



ð10:14Þ
where Q(st,at) is the current Q-function value for state-action pair st, at and coefﬁcient
α 2 [0,1] is the learning rate parameter controlling the weight or importance given to the
reward or return just experienced. With TD learning, the Q-function value is incrementally
updated from its previous value, rather than performing a complete replacement, which has
been found to produce more stable convergence in stochastic environments. Notice that if
α ¼ 1, then (10.14) and (10.13) are equivalent. Generally, α should decrease with the
increasing number of episodes in order to slow the learning rate as the process converges.
Advances in Water Resources Systems Engineering: Applications of Machine. . .
477

In updating the Q-function of (10.14), a method of interpolating Qk  1(st + 1,at + 1) is
required since states calculated from (10.2) may not coincide with the discrete states over
which Qk  1(st + 1,at + 1) is stored. In this study, various function approximation techniques
were applied including linear, polynomial, and spline approximations [17, 18]. It was found
that the simple nearest neighbor methods provided more efﬁcient and stable convergence of
the Q-Learning algorithm since the optimal value function exhibited high degrees of discon-
tinuity over certain ranges of the state variables.
2.7. Discounting Scheme for Optimal Average Returns
One of the problems in solving Markov decision processes, especially over possibly many
thousands of stages as in Q-Learning, is the total expected discounted returns represented in
the DP optimal value function can become extremely large, depending on the number of times
a particular state is visited. Since this can lead to numerical instabilities, this problem is
overcome by discounting immediate returns by (1  γ) in relation to the discounted future
returns:

ð10:15Þ
Lee and Labadie [11] prove that under this modiﬁed discounting scheme, the optimal value
function converges to the optimal expected average return over all stages, instead of the
expected total discounted returns.
2.8. Case Study: Geum River Basin, South Korea
2.8.1. Description
The Geum River basin, South Korea, is selected as a case study to demonstrate the
applicability of the Q-Learning algorithm, as described by Lee and Labadie [11]. Figure 10.2
provides a location map and the major features of the network ﬂow simulation model of the
Geum River basin. Located in the southwestern portion of the Korean Peninsula, the Geum
River basin is one of the four major river basins in South Korea with a total basin area of
9,810 km2, which is subdivided into 12 subbasins. With a main stem length of 396 km, the
Geum River is impounded by the multipurpose Daechung and Yongdam Reservoirs, which
beneﬁt a population of almost ﬁve million in the region. Satisfaction of municipal, industrial,
and agricultural water demands are the primary purposes of these two reservoirs, but ﬂood
control, hydropower generation, and maintaining instream ﬂow requirements for water
quality and ecological maintenance are also important.

which has given rise to regional conﬂicts between users in the downstream region of the Geum
River basin and new users in the Jun-Ju region receiving transbasin water from Yongdam. Cities

in the river as a result of ﬂows diminished by the transbasin diversions. These concerns have
heightenedthe need forcoordinated,fully integrated watermanagementinthe GeumRiverbasin.
2.8.2. Operational Guidelines
In decreasing order of priority, the primary water uses in the 12 subbasins are instream ﬂow
maintenance and domestic, industrial, and agricultural water supply. In order to protect
preexisting water rights in the subbasins, these demands are distributed prior to any alloca-
tions to demands along the main stem of the river. The Korea Water Resources Corporation
(K-water) has deﬁned minimum streamﬂow requirements as ﬂows at the 95 % exceedence
percentile over the 19-year historical period for each subbasin [19].
Although hydropower generation in the Geum River system is assigned the lowest priority
in the basin, it is still considered an important objective by K-water. Yongdam Reservoir has
two power plants, with a low-head plant operating on releases to the Geum River up to a
discharge capacity of 22.6 cm and a high-head plant generating power at the Jun-Ju diversion
with a capacity of 6.2 cm. Both power plants at Yongdam Reservoir operate 24 h per day with
a combined annual generation of 207.8 GWh. The power plant at Daechung Reservoir
operates for only 5 h of daily peak time during the non-ﬂood season (October to June), with
an annual energy generation of 238 GWh. During the ﬂood season, generation hours vary
according to inﬂow conditions. Flood control at Yongdam Reservoir requires maintaining the
reservoir level at or below 261.5 m (672.84 MCM) during the ﬂood season. However, the
normal full storage level of 76.5 m (1242.7 MCM) at Daechung Reservoir is used as the ﬂood
control level since inﬂows to Daechung Reservoir were reduced following completion of the
Yongdam Reservoir upstream [19].
2.8.3. Multiobjective Optimization Model
Minimizing prioritized water demand deﬁcits and reservoir spills, while maximizing
hydropower generation, constitute the primary operational objectives in the Geum River
system. The weighting method of multiobjective optimization is applied to commensurating
these objectives into a single performance measure as the reward function:

from Yongdam Reservoir; spit is spill from reservoir i during month t; djt is demand at
diversion or instream ﬂow point j; and aj + 2,t is the actual ﬂow delivered to the demand.
Releases a1t from Daechung and Yongdam releases a2t and a3t constitute the primary decision
variables in the formulation. The remaining variables aj + 3,t for j ¼ 1, . . ., ND representing
ﬂows to demands j are independent decision variables but are directly based on reservoir
releases and simulation of the allocation to the various water use sectors based on the
aforementioned priority scheme. Constraints on the optimization include mass balance
equations for each reservoir, upper and lower bounds on reservoir storage, and simulation
of optimal downstream distribution of reservoir releases to multiple demand points, including
available return ﬂows.
2.8.4. Inﬂow and Demand Data Sets
Although the available data covers a 19-year period, only 15 years of monthly data from
October 1983 to September 1998 were used for generating stationary optimal operational
policies using Q-Learning. The remaining 4 years of data from October 1999 to October 2002
were applied to model veriﬁcation and policy performance evaluation (Fig. 10.3). Rainfall-
runoff simulation models were calibrated by K-water based on the US Army Corps
of Engineers SSARR (Streamﬂow Synthesis and Reservoir Regulation) model [19] for
estimating unregulated inﬂows in each of the subbasins where direct streamﬂow measure-
ments were missing.
Fig. 10.3. Time series and box and whisker plots for Daechung Reservoir inﬂows for performance
evaluation data set.
Advances in Water Resources Systems Engineering: Applications of Machine. . .
481

Historical estimated agricultural demands provided by K-water were based on the average
of 19 years of data from 1983 to 2002. K-water estimated agricultural water requirements
from a consumptive use model, with an assumed 0.35 return ﬂow fraction. Municipal and
industrial demands were derived by averaging demands for water years 2001 and 2002 to
reﬂect current conditions in the Geum River basin. Return ﬂows from domestic and industrial
water usage were assumed as 65 % of diversion amount. All of these assumptions were
incorporated by K-water into calibration of the SSARR model [19]. Instream ﬂow require-
ments for the subbasins were estimated as the 95 % exceedence percentile of the 19 years of
the historical monthly ﬂows for each subbasin.
2.8.5. Application of Q-Learning
For application of Q-Learning, reservoir storage states were discretized into 21 grid points
for Yongdam reservoir and 24 grid points for Daechung reservoir, representing 34 MCM
increments. Yongdam releases were evenly discretized into 10 MCM increments from 3 to
133 MCM (14 points), whereas Daechung releases were unevenly discretized into 27 points
from 17 to 707 million cubic meters per month. Since the water allocation procedure for the
deﬁcit sharing policy and priority system for water deliveries in the basin require considerable
computational time, it was decided to pre-calculate immediate beneﬁt (reward) over the ﬁnite
discretized grid points of state and decision spaces. This required substantial computer
memory for storage of the large-scale beneﬁt tables but saved considerable computational
time in the Q-Learning model by replacing function calculation with simple table lookup.
Figure 10.4 shows convergence of the Q-function updates relating the absolute deviation
between the current update value and the optimal value. Although over 3.5 million episodes
were required for convergence for this case study, each update required little CPU time since
only a single state transition is calculated at each episode. It can be seen that the discount
factor inﬂuences the number of episodes required for convergence. Several values of the
learning rate parameter α and rates of its reduction with episode were evaluated, but simply
setting α ¼ 1 provided the best convergence behavior for this study.
An example stationary optimal operational rule for Daechung Reservoir for August and a
discount factor of 0.95, conditioned on both Daechung and Yongdam storage levels, is shown
in Fig. 10.5. The inﬂuence of Yongdam Reservoir storage is clearly seen in the release rules
for Daechung reservoir. Optimal operational rules developed with different discount factors
exhibited similar patterns.
2.8.6. Comparative Evaluation of Optimal Operating Rules
Simulation analysis was used to evaluate and compare the optimal operating policies
developed by Q-Learning with implicit stochastic dynamic programming and sampling
stochastic dynamic programming (SSDP) [12]. As a variant of stochastic dynamic program-
ming, SSDP which uses streamﬂow scenarios as ensembles to represent the stochastic inﬂow
processes. Each of these methods is described in detail in Lee and Labadie [11]. The same
performance measure used in the optimization models was also applied in the performance
simulation.

The historical streamﬂow data set for the period October 1998 to September 2002 was used
for performance testing and evaluation for all methods, but not included in the development of
optimal operating rules for each method. This hydrologic period provides a valid basis for
performance analysis since the time series data for Daechung and Yongdam Reservoirs
includes average, high-ﬂow, and extensive low-ﬂow conditions. Initial storage conditions
for Daechung Reservoir were set to the historical storage levels at the end of September 1998
(1074.8 MCM, representing approximately 80 % of normal full storage). Since Yongdam
Reservoir was not yet completed at that time, the initial storage was assumed to be approx-
imately 80 % of normal full storage (606.75 MCM).
The model options selected for evaluation include Implicit (implicit stochastic optimiza-
tion), SSDP (sampling stochastic dynamic programming), Q-Learn (reinforcement learning
using the Q-Learning model), QLearn-K (a Q-Learning model described in Lee and Labadie
[11] that conditions the Q-function on hydrologic state forecasts based on K-means cluster-
ing), and Perfect (deterministic dynamic programming under perfect foreknowledge). The
latter does not provide useable operating rules, but provides the upper bound on the maximum
possible performance for comparison purposes. Alternative discount factors applied to SSDP
and Q-Learning ranged from 0.7 to 0.95, but with γ ¼ 0.95 providing the best performance.
Reservoir storage results for Daechung Reservoir are shown in Fig. 10.6 under operating
rules developed by each of the selected methods. It can be seen that operations under the
Implicit rules reduce Daechung Reservoir releases in order to recover normal full reservoir
storage at the end of the water year, resulting in higher releases during the dry season and
lower releases during the ﬂood season. These reduced releases during the ﬂood season likely
have little impact on the performance measures due to the abundant ﬂow conditions during the
Fig. 10.6. Simulated end-of-month storage levels for Daechung Reservoir under alternative operating
policies.

ﬂood season. More stable operations are evident under Perfect, QLearn, and QLearn-K during
the dry seasons. The poor performance of the SSDP rules is revealed in Fig. 10.6, as well as
with the operational results for Yongdam Reservoir, not shown here. It can be seen that all the
models attempt to reﬁll the reservoir by the end of the ﬂood season (September), reﬂecting the
realistic need in reservoir operations to prepare for the dry season. The ending reservoir
storage for May by the Perfect model is close to minimum storage for Daechung Reservoir,
which is only possible if there is perfect foresight of future streamﬂows.
Figure 10.7 compares the total performance measures, showing that the Q-Learning model
(QLearn) provides the best overall performance. The Q-Learning model conditioned on
hydrologic state (QLearn-K) is likely outperformed by QLearn since season-to-season inﬂow
correlations in the basin were not statistically signiﬁcant. It can be seen that QLearn and
QLearn-K provide the most consistent monthly beneﬁts, particularly during low-ﬂow months,
whereas SSDP exhibits the poorest performance.
3. MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO REAL-TIME CONTROL
OF COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOWS
3.1. Introduction
Combined sewer systems (CSS) for conveying both wet and dry weather ﬂows create
serious pollution problems in adjacent receiving waters when intense rainfall events produce
discharges exceeding interceptor sewer and treatment plant capacities. Although combined

sewers are no longer constructed, they still exist in many large metropolitan areas. Replace-
ment of combined sewers with separate conveyances for wastewater and stormwater is a
possible solution, but sewer separation can actually increase pollution to adjacent water
bodies since untreated stormwater discharges alone often carry high BOD loadings, heavy
metals from industrial areas, hydrocarbons from automobiles, organic chemicals, and patho-
gens from plumbing misconnections. According to the AMSA [20], stormwater is often
directly discharged into receiving waters in separated systems without requisite treatment.
The US federal and state regulations now require assurance that stormwater runoff does not
pollute adjacent rivers and streams [21].
Other options for reducing or eliminating combined sewer overﬂows is the construction
of large underground retention basins. Examples such as the Deep Tunnel and Reservoir
Project are yet to be completed “. . .after more than three decades and $5 billion in public
expense. . .” [22]. San Francisco’s shoreline underground storage/transport system for con-
trolling combined sewer overﬂows has been completed at costs exceeding $1.5 billion, and
yet “. . .during the storms that rained on the San Francisco Bay Area in January (2010), a total
of 630,000 gallons of raw sewage spewed into the bay at 47 spots. Even worse, 170 million
gallons of partially treated sewage was discharged from three East Bay Municipal Utility
District “wet weather” overﬂow plants” [23].
The high cost and disruption to residences and businesses of converting to separated
systems, or constructing large underground storage/transport facilities, has given impetus
to the search for cost-effective methods for controlling combined sewer overﬂows (CSOs).
Real-time regulation of in-sewer storage or off-line retention storage in both stormwater and
combined sewer systems through control of gates, pumps, and weirs is an approach to
reducing untreated overﬂows that has been successfully demonstrated in a few cities (e.g.,
Milwaukee, USA [24]; Quebec, Canada [25]; Saverne, France [26]; and Ense-Bremen,
Germany [27]). Unfortunately, potential implementations have not been sustained due to
concerns about the robustness and reliability of required computer control equipment, sensor,
and communication devices, as well as inadequate software and modeling capabilities.
Schutze et al. [28] claim, however, that incentives for consideration of real-time control
technology have been renewed by current advances in hardware and software technologies at
reasonable cost.
Relative to capital construction, the maximum utilization of spatially distributed in-line
storage in a combined sewer system is an inexpensive approach to reducing the polluting
effects of untreated stormwater and combined sewer spills to receiving waters [29]. The goal
is to provide optimal regulation of control structures in the sewer network such that CSOs are
minimized or even eliminated. The proper management over time and space of the aggregate
in-sewer storage capacity and available off-line retention storage in a sewer network can help
reduce pollution from untreated CSOs to adjacent water bodies. Even if elimination of CSOs
is not possible under ideal control strategies, incorporation of real-time control into plans for
constructing additional retention/detention storage facilities may reduce sizing requirements
and associated costs by making optimum use of available storage.

According to Pleau et al. [25], most current RTC implementations employ local reactive or
supervisory control. Although real-time control (RTC) is most effective if integrated over the
entire sewer network, the result is a large-scale and complex spatially distributed optimal control
problem. The optimization is highly nonlinear, requiring integration with models for accurately
simulating stormwater runoff and sewer hydraulics, including fully dynamic unsteady ﬂow
modeling in the sewer network. The dynamic optimization is further complicated by the
computational stress of repeatedly solving the optimal control problem within 5- to 15-min
time intervals as rainfall forecasts and measured levels and ﬂows are updated in real time.
The primary limitations in employing the accurate models necessary for effective real-time
control are computational time and complexity. The use of machine learning approaches
employing dynamic or recurrent artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) may provide the analysis
speed, generalization ability, and high fault tolerance needed for overcoming these limita-
tions. The potential usefulness of dynamic artiﬁcial neural networks for real-time control of
stormwater and combined sewer systems is explored, with a computationally time-
consuming, optimal control model utilized to provide the training data set for a recurrent
ANN under a wide range of sewer inﬂow conditions. Off-line performance evaluation of the
trained ANN is compared with the optimal control module using a test data set not included
in the ANN training. The neural-control algorithm is applied by Darsono and Labadie [30] to
real-time control of the combined sewer system of the King County Wastewater Treatment
Division, Washington, USA as a case study to demonstrate its viability.
3.2. Optimal Control Module
3.2.1. Formulation
Reducing the occurrence and magnitude of stormwater and combined sewer overﬂows
(CSOs), and thereby reducing pollution impacts on receiving waters, is the primary goal of the
real-time control system. The primary objectives are to minimize overﬂows while maximiz-
ing through-ﬂows to the wastewater treatment plant for a storm event occurring over T time
intervals:

where ut ¼ (u1t, . . .,umt,um + 1,t, . . .,um + n,t,um + n + 1,t, . . .,u2m + n)T is the vector of node dis-
charge rates (m3/s) at the end of time interval t throughout the sewer network (initial release
rates u0 are assumed to be given), with m representing the number of control structures such as
regulators, pump stations, weirs, and oriﬁces in the system. It is assumed that state vector
components (s1t, . . .,smt) represent temporary storage accumulated behind these structures
located in the interceptor and lateral or trunk sewers (m3).
The interceptor sewer is divided into n sections corresponding to the location of each regulator
controlling discharges from a lateral sewer. The portion of the state vector (sm + 1,t, . . .,sm + n,t) is
zero-storage nodes within the interceptor sewer for the convenience of ﬂow routing calculations.
Control vector components (u1t, . . .,umt) are controlled discharges from each regulator or pump
stationinto theinterceptorsewer or downstream trunksewer; theportion (um + 1,t, . . .,um + n,t) are
ﬂows at each section of the interceptor sewer; and (um + n + 1,t, . . .,u2m + n,t) represents untreated
overﬂows from the system at regulator stations and other control structures. A typical conﬁgu-
ration for a regulator station is shown in Fig. 10.8.
The current estimates at iteration k of routing coefﬁcients calculated from a fully dynamic
sewer hydraulics model are incorporated into routing matrices BðkÞ
t
in (10.18). Sewer dis-
charges q(k) and heads h(k), respectively, over each sewer section i and discrete time interval
t are also simulated by the hydraulic model. Temporary storage capacities smax(q(k),h(k)) and
node discharge umax(q(k),h(k)) are dynamic functions of q(k), h(k) due to dependence on
hydraulic ﬂows and heads throughout the sewer network. These iteratively adjusted restric-
tions on temporary in-line storage and discharges prevent the occurrence of upstream sur-
charge conditions in the lateral or trunk sewers sufﬁcient to produce street ﬂooding.
The objective function of (10.17) minimizes total weighted overﬂows (squared) from
the CSS, where the weighting coefﬁcients cit can vary both spatially and temporally.

These coefﬁcients allow consideration of receiving water impacts being more sensitive to
overﬂows at certain locations than others, as well as temporal inﬂuences such as tidal
conditions. In this formulation, the untreated spills are squared in the objective function,
which has a smoothing effect on the solution, thereby avoiding oscillations and surges in the
sewer system. This also ameliorates the impacts of the so-called ﬁrst-ﬂush shock on aquatic
biota of untreated spills that has been observed in overﬂow-producing storm events due to the
ﬂushing out of catch basin litter accumulations with high BOD loadings [31].
Residual storage of stormwater and combined sewer ﬂows in the sewer system at the
end of the storm is minimized through inclusion of the ﬁnal term in the objective function
Pm
i¼1 wis2
i,Tþ1, which also indirectly maximizes through-ﬂow to the wastewater treatment
plant. Weighting factors wi act to trade-off this objective with the primary objective of
minimizing untreated spills. If forecasts indicate that a storm event may be immediately
followed by another, it may be necessary to increase this weighting factor to provide sufﬁcient
capacity for the imminent event.
Equation (10.18) maintains mass balance in each sewer reach, where rt are spatially distrib-
uted stormwater inﬂows to the CSS as predicted from an urban stormwater runoff model such as
the RUNOFF module of the US EPA SWMM model [32]. As the storm event progresses and
new rainfall forecasts are generated, these predictions are assumed to be updated in real time.
Discharges ut are instantaneous ﬂow rates, requiring averaging over the time interval and
multiplication by conversion factor conv for conversion to storage units per time interval.
3.2.2. Discrete Time Optimal Control Algorithm (OPTCON)
The augmented Lagrangian algorithm, also called the method of multipliers [33], is applied
to solving the nonlinear, dynamic optimal control problem of (10.17)–(10.20) over discrete
time steps based on Pontryagin’s maximum principle. The Lagrangian function L(x,u,λ) is
formed by adding the state dynamics (10.18) to the objective function using Lagrange
multipliers λ and then augmenting the Lagrangian function with penalty terms on the state-
space constraints, or the constraints on the state variables (10.19), using estimated penalty
weights p1 and p2:

3.2.3. Solution of the Saint Venant Equations (UNSTDY)
The fully dynamic unsteady ﬂow module UNSTDY is applied to one-dimensional hydrau-
lic routing in a stormwater or combined sewer network, including ﬂows through junctions and
control structures [34]. A fully implicit numerical scheme is applied to solving the Saint
Venant equations of conservation of mass and momentum in UNSTDY:

where for each sewer section, A is ﬂow cross-sectional area, q is discharge, h is depth of ﬂow,
V is mean velocity, ql is lateral ﬂow per unit length of the sewer section, x is longitudinal
distance, t is time, S0 is bed slope, Sf friction slope, ρ is ﬂuid mass density, and g is
gravitational acceleration.
The fully implicit ﬁnite difference numerical scheme used in UNSTDY is unconditionally
stable up to the Courant condition for temporal discretization. Calculation of transitions
between subcritical and supercritical ﬂow conditions is included in UNSTDY, with the
kinematic wave equations applied to supercritical ﬂow routing. Evaluation of unsteady ﬂow
in a storm sewer network under submerged conditions is based on the hypothetical
Preissmann slot for attaining higher pressurized ﬂow wave celerity. This allows the same
set of unsteady ﬂow equations to be applied to surcharge ﬂow conditions, where the width of
the slot in UNSTDY is assumed to be 0.1 % of the maximum width of a conduit under
surcharge conditions. Stormwater inﬂow predictions from the RUNOFF module of the US
EPA SWMM model [32] deﬁne the upstream boundary conditions, whereas discharge
hydrographs, stage hydrographs, stage-discharge rating curves, or storage basins can be
applied to the downstream boundary conditions.
Branched sewer networks can be modeled in UNSTDY, allowing up to three inﬂow
branches and one outﬂow pipe in a dendritic structure. The hydraulic equations for sewer
ﬂows through conﬂuence junctions are modeled using the continuity and energy equations
490
J.W. Labadie

(10.22) and (10.23), respectively. UNSTDY allows speciﬁcation of internal boundary condi-
tions for inclusion of weirs, sluice gates, radial gates, siphons, in-line and side oriﬁces,
wet-well and dynamic head pump stations, and storage facilities for simulating real-time
control of ﬂow regulation facilities.
3.2.4. Iterative Calculation of Hydraulic Sewer Flows
The (m + n)  (2m + n) routing matrices BðkÞ
t
in (10.18) serve to account for attenuation
and lagging of upstream releases to downstream nodes and system spills. Superscript (k) is an
iteration index indicating that elements of BðkÞ
t
are updated through successive solution of
UNSTDY throughout the sewer network. Unver and Mays show that it is possible to directly
incorporate numerical approximations of the linearized Saint Venant equations as constraints
in a large-scale quadratic programming problem for application to an entire sewer network
over a dynamic time horizon. Unfortunately, this approach requires linearization of important
nonlinear terms in the full Saint Venant equations, thereby preventing accurate simulation of
complex sewer hydraulic conditions such as transitions between supercritical and subcritical
ﬂow regimes.
An iterative approach originally proposed by Labadie [29] involves successive solution of
the optimal control model OPTCON and the hydraulic sewer routing model UNSTDY
(Fig. 10.9). OPTCON is ﬁrst executed with current approximations of the routing coefﬁcients
(i.e., elements of matrix BðkÞ
t ), as well as initial estimates of bounds on temporary storage and
discharge (i.e., (10.19) and (10.20)). Optimal node discharge control solutions u
t are then
converted into gate or pump settings, which are then simulated using the UNSTDY hydraulic
model. Based on these results, coefﬁcients bij

used in the optimal control model
are updated, as shown in Fig. 10.10, where uðkþ1Þ
it
are the simulated ﬂows from the dynamic
hydraulic routing model under the current optimal gate or pump settings. For any iteration k,
the routing matrix elements {bij}ðkÞ
t
are positive if node i receives outﬂow from node j, or 0 if
the two nodes are unconnected. For spills and downstream releases from node i, {bij}ðkÞ
t
¼ 1.
Along with routing coefﬁcients, limits on sewer reach storage smax(q(k + 1),h(k + 1)) and
discharge limits umax(q(k + 1),h(k + 1)) are updated from the hydraulic sewer simulation model
in the next iteration to assure hydraulic feasibility of solutions from the optimal control model.
Interactive simulation using the complete Saint Venant equations allows bounds on ﬂows
through gates and regulators to be adjusted based on levels calculated by the hydraulic
simulation model that guarantee sufﬁcient head for downstream releases. It is assumed that
the iterative process has converged when successive calculations of routing coefﬁcients agree
to a desired error tolerance. The convergent routing coefﬁcients in (10.18) represent solution
of the complete Saint Venant equations without having to directly incorporate them into the
optimization model.

3.3. Neural Network Module
3.3.1. Machine Learning of Optimal Regulator Control
In spite of the computational efﬁciency of indirect incorporation of the Saint Venant
equations in the optimal control module through iterative calculation of routing coefﬁcients,
clock time limitations for real-time implementation may be exceeded due to required
RUNOFF model calculations and multiple executions of UNSTDY at each control time
step for large-scale stormwater or combined sewer networks. Several studies have shown that
artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) are an effective tool for controlling complex, nonlinear

lic sewer model UNSTDY.

systems [36]. The goal is to employ a machine learning approach whereby an ANN is applied
to learning how the optimal control module makes correct decisions in a real-time environ-
ment, but without perfect foreknowledge of stormwater inﬂows produced by the ongoing
storm event.
Although the optimal control module with incorporation of the RUNOFF and UNSTDY
simulation models may be limited by the need for calculations to be completed within the
desired real-time increments for adjustment of control settings, off-line calculations of
OPTCON for a wide range of historical storm events are under no such limitation. This
allows off-line OPTCON calculations to be performed with complete foreknowledge of future
inﬂows, thereby determining optimal strategies under a wide variety of inﬂow conditions.
Attempting to directly solve OPTCON in real time would require successive runs using error-
prone forecasts of future inﬂows, whereas a machine learning approach is applied here
whereby the ANN is trained using rainfall input and OPTCON-based optimal control output
exemplars. The trained and tested ANN neural-optimal control model can be efﬁciently
implemented in real time as a replacement of OPTCON, hypothesizing that forecast infor-
mation may not be required if the ANN is able to detect changing storm patterns as types of
events included in the training, and adapt accordingly.
3.3.2. Jordan Recurrent ANN Architecture
Adaptive control of combined sewer systems in real time requires a recurrent ANN to
model dynamic operational trajectories. Since the main purpose of the dynamic neural-control
module is to compute optimal real-time gate controls based on current and previous rainfall

Recognizing the likely correlation of successive rainfall inputs over time and space,
internal inputs to the recurrent ANN are current, lag-1, and lag-2 spatially distributed rainfall
data. Gate opening controls from the previous time period serve as internal inputs to the ANN
in order to facilitate smooth, dynamic operation of gates in the system. Since current period
gate openings are the output of the ANN, the number of output neurons is the same as the
number of gate controls in the system.
3.3.3. Training and Testing of Recurrent ANN
A supervised learning process is applied to determining the optimal connection weights wh

k from the input–output training data set. The input data are rain
gauge measurements for various historical storm events, and the output data set are the
optimal gate controls calculated off-line by the optimal control module. The standard gener-
alized delta rule [38] is applied to training the Jordan recurrent ANN, involving feed-forward
and error back-propagation calculations. Standard normal transformations of the input–output
training set data are applied since the activation function in the neural network can only
produce outputs in the range between 0 and 1. Following training, actual gate control settings
are then obtained by inverse transformation of neuron output values from neurons in the
output layer. Initialization of the weighting matrices is carried out using random number
generation, and the standard back-propagation, gradient-type optimization procedure is
applied to adjusting the connection weights until the sum-of-squares error deviation between
ANN outputs and training set outputs is minimized [37].

Optimal values of the learning parameter and momentum constant that are based on
experimental procedures are applied to determining learning rate and momentum parameters
that maximize convergence efﬁciency of the training algorithm. Training of recurrent neural
networks is often plagued by slow convergence to local minima and must be conducted with
great care [39]. An experimental procedure to evaluate the minimum square error (MSE) for
determining the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer is embedded in the learning
process. Validating the recurrent ANN involves testing the performance using input and
output data sets not included in the training data sets.
3.4. Case Study: West Point Combined Sewer System, Seattle,
Washington, USA
3.4.1. Description of Case Study
The capabilities of the neural-optimal control algorithm are demonstrated through appli-
cation to the West Point Treatment Plant collection system of the King County Wastewater
Treatment Division, Seattle, Washington, USA. The service area of the West Point Treatment
Plant that is included in this study covers an area of over 26,000 ha with 160 km of
gravity sewers with diameters up to 3.66 m, 11 pumping stations, and 17 regulator stations.
Figure 10.12 shows the extent of the West Point combined sewer system as modeled in this
study, but it should be noted that this conﬁguration does not reﬂect recent expansions,
upgrades, and improvements to the King County wastewater system designed to substantially
reduce the volume and frequency of combined sewer overﬂows [40]. Although not up-to-date,
this conﬁguration was deemed acceptable for demonstrating the viability of the neural-
optimal control algorithm. However, the recent expansion of the West Point Treatment
plant capacity to handle wet weather peak ﬂow rates up to 19.3 m3/s was included.
Metro Seattle, which merged with King County as a single agency in 1994, originally
developed the CATAD (Computer Augmented Treatment and Disposal) system in the early
1970s, one of the ﬁrst attempts to implement a supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) system for real-time regulation of in-line storage in a combined sewer system.
With the main control center located at the West Point Treatment Plant, CATAD is designed
to monitor and control pump and regulator stations, including telemetry of real-time data on
water levels, gate positions, tide levels, and pump speed data [40]. Recent attempts have been
made to upgrade CATAD to monitor rainfall and ﬂow conditions in the major trunk sewers
and interceptors for model prediction of sewer inﬂows and optimal control of selected
regulator station gates in real time. Unfortunately, problems at the Interbay Pump Station
and computer hardware limitations have prevented the use of the predictive control compo-
nents in CATAD.
3.4.2. RUNOFF Model Calibration and Validation
RUNOFF model calibration was conducted by the staff of the King County Department of
Natural Resources, Wastewater Treatment Division (formerly Metro Seattle). The West Point
service area was portioned into 400 drainage subbasins, with average slope, overland ﬂow
lengths, roughness coefﬁcients, percent imperviousness, and inﬁltration parameters evaluated

in the calibration. Further validation studies comparing simulated inlet hydrographs with
measured ﬂows were based on storm events not included in the calibration. For the
stormwater modeling, 10-min rainfall data were collected within the Seattle City limits at
17 locations, along with measurements at the National Weather Service station at Sea-Tac
Airport and Sand Point in North Seattle. Flow data for model calibration were measured
at more than 60 locations throughout the West Point service area using transportable
ﬂow meters.

3.4.3. UNSTDY Hydraulic Model Development
Storm water hydrographs generated from the RUNOFF model are routed into 22 inlet
locations serving as upstream boundary conditions and lateral inﬂows to the combined sewer
network (Fig. 10.12). UNSTDY modeling of the sewer network is restricted to only those
portions with 1.22 m diameter pipe sizes and higher, with kinematic wave approximations
applied to the smaller pipe sections. The sewer network was divided into 260 sections for
numerical modeling with UNSTDY, with distances between sections ranging from 18.3 m to
91.4 m based on desired numerical accuracy, changes in slope or existence of a weir or other
control structure. The hydraulic model was provided with pipe and gate sizes, slopes,
roughness coefﬁcients, and junction data, along with rating tables for downstream boundary
conditions based on the normal ﬂow approximation. Inlet stormwater hydrographs are
routed through the sewer network, with dry weather ﬂows provided as initial ﬂow condi-
tions. Optimal regulator station releases calculated by OPTCON are speciﬁed as interior
boundary conditions in UNSTDY, with the required gate openings then calculated that
produce those ﬂows.
3.4.4. Optimal Control Module
Figure 10.13 shows the layout of regulator stations along Elliott Bay for simulated real-
time control, with other uncontrollable regulator stations throughout the Seattle region
modeled in UNSTDY as ﬁxed weirs. Although the optimal control module is conﬁned to
optimization of the regulator stations along the Elliott Bay Interceptor, the UNSTDY hydrau-
lic model calculates ﬂows from the Duwamish pump station into the Elliott Bay Interceptor,
as well as ﬂows from the North Interceptor into the West Point Treatment Plant. These
hydraulic calculations allow speciﬁcation of treatment capacity available for ﬂows in the
Elliott Bay Interceptor.
For purposes of the modeling, storage variables in the interceptor sewer are deﬁned as zero-
storage dummy variables, which are necessary for the state-space formulation of the optimal
control problem, in spite of the fact that there are no gates or other control structures within
the interceptor since ﬂows in the interceptor are indirectly controlled by regulator station
gates. Weighting factors cit in the objective function (10.17) were uniformly set to 125, with
the penalty on ﬁnal storage wi set an order of magnitude smaller at 12.5. These weights are
easily modiﬁed for prioritization of overﬂows as to location and time of day, such as for
considering tidal inﬂuences on polluting impacts of combined sewer overﬂows.
Eleven diverse, spatially distributed storm events over the study area were deﬁned based on
10-min rain gauge data from National Weather Service stations in the Seattle area. Rainfall
data in 10-min time increments were obtained from National Weather Service stations in the
area, Sea-Tac airport south of the study area, and Sand Point located north of the study area.
The City of Seattle maintains other rain gauges in the Seattle area, but the NWS gauges
provided the most complete data set at the desired time increment of 10 min. The ﬁrst 10 events
were utilized as training data sets for the neural-optimal control model, with Storm #11
reserved for testing and validation purposes. Figure 10.14 shows the inﬂow hydrographs for
Storm #11 for the study area corresponding to the controllable regulators along the Elliott Bay

Interceptor, as depicted in Fig. 10.13. The RUNOFF model was applied to calculating
stormwater inﬂows in the Southern Service Area, which were then routed using UNSTDY to
the Duwamish Pump Station to provide inﬂows r5 entering the Elliott Bay Interceptor.
OPTCON was applied to computing optimal gate controls for each of the 11 storm events
in 10-min time increments. In Fig. 10.15, application of OPTCON in reducing combined
sewer overﬂows under fully integrated dynamic optimal control for Storm #11 is contrasted
with the standard uncontrolled solution where diversions from the trunk sewers are allowed to
enter the interceptor sewer until surcharging occurs at that location, resulting in spills or
overﬂows at that regulator station. The magnitude of Storm #11 results in overﬂows in spite of
the application of the optimal control strategy, but with substantially reduced total overﬂows
and peak discharge rates. Although the viability of optimal use of in-line storage in the
combined sewer system is clearly demonstrated, these controls are based on perfect fore-
knowledge of the storm event and therefore cannot be implemented for actual real-time
control. OPTCON solutions for Storms 1–10 are utilized as training data sets for the recurrent
neural network and then validated using results from Storm #11. This allows the demonstra-
tion of optimal real-time control without the presumption of perfect foreknowledge of the
storm event.
3.4.5. Training the Recurrent ANN with Optimal Gate Controls
The optimal gate controls for the training data set comprising Storms 1–10 are calculated
using the optimal control module, which then serve as desired outputs in the learning step of
the recurrent ANN. Ten-minute rainfall hyetographs provide the external inputs to the

module, with gate control outputs as feedback from the previous time step comprising the
internal inputs. Back-propagation is applied to optimal estimation of the synaptic weights wh

k. The gradient algorithm requires speciﬁcation of learning parameter η
and momentum constant α which govern the convergence rate and stability of the learning
process. Numerous experiments with these parameters resulted in speciﬁcation of the optimal
parameters η ¼ 0.10 and α ¼ 0.30 as providing the minimum root mean square error (RMSE)
in the learning process and requiring 100 epochs or iterations.

for networks with a single hidden layer, where
n is the number of input neurons and m the number of output neurons. For this study, the
optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined from an experimental
approach, with results indicating that 60 neurons gave the minimum value of RMSE.
3.4.6. Testing the Neural-Optimal Control Model
Data sets for testing and validating the trained ANN should differ from training data sets.
Since Storm #11 was excluded from the training data sets, it is selected for use in testing and
validation. Figure 10.16 compares the gate controls produced by the neural-control model with
OPTCON under perfect foreknowledge for the regulator gate at the Connecticut Street station
for Storm #11. The neural-control model does not beneﬁt from perfect foreknowledge, but
rather generates decisions based only on current measured rainfall, past rainfall, and previous
gate controls as inputs, and yet the gate controls are quite close to those produced by OPTCON.

regulator station.

Similar results are found in comparing the neural-control and OPTCON gate controls for the
other regulator stations in the study area. The neural-control model clearly displays a learning
capability that adapts to the ongoing storm event as rainfall data are being collected. Although
the event used for testing differs from all the storms used for training of the ANN, portions of
this event are similar to portions of the events used in the training, indicating that the neural-
control model exhibits a pattern-recognition capability that detects and exploits these
similarities.
Total direct overﬂows from the combined sewer system as hydraulically simulated using
gate controls from the neural-control model were 27, 224 m3 vs. 25, 390 m3 for the controls
produced by OPTCON under perfect foreknowledge. This represents only a 7 % increase in
total overﬂows using the neural-control algorithm without the beneﬁt of perfect foreknowl-
edge. Also, the neural-control gate operations exhibit a smoothness and stability that belies
the high variability of the rainfall inputs. It was originally hypothesized that providing direct
rainfall measurements as inputs to the ANN would be unsuccessful since rainfall data can be
noisy and sporadic. If this were the case, it would have been necessary to preprocess the
rainfall data through the RUNOFF model and provide the resulting sewer inﬂow predictions
as input data sets for training the ANN. In fact, it is clear that rainfall data can indeed be
provided as direct inputs, which is facilitated by the dynamic nature of the recurrent ANN and
the use of time-lagged inputs. For this application, execution of the recurrent ANN at each
time step required only 0.02 s. of CPU time on a 2 GHz Pentium 4 desktop workstation,
indicating that the neural-optimal control model can be easily implemented for adaptive, real-
time control of stormwater and combined sewer systems.
4. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR COASTAL ECOSYSTEM
RESTORATION: LEARNING OPTIMAL FUZZY RULES
BY GENETIC ALGORITHMS
4.1. Introduction
Increased stormwater discharges and pollutant loadings due to expanded urban and agri-
cultural development have adversely impacted shoreline ecosystems along many coastal
areas. An example is the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE) within the Indian River Lagoon on the
east coast of south Florida, where an elaborate drainage canal system constructed by the US
Army Corps of Engineers over the last century has greatly altered the natural drainage
patterns that historically maintained the important Everglades natural area. As shown in
Fig. 10.17, the canals intercept and divert stormwater drainage to the east coast, along with
emergency releases from Lake Okeechobee for protecting dykes surrounding the Lake.
Drainage of the swamps and so-called overﬂow areas stimulated land development and the
resulting population boom in Florida that continues today. These man-made alterations have
contributed to decline of the Everglades ecosystem, along with increased freshwater inﬂows
into coastal estuaries such as the SLE affecting the overall salinity regime supporting
estuarine ecosystems. As a result, sea grasses, oysters, and other species once abundant in
the SLE are virtually absent today [42].
502
J.W. Labadie

The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) undertaken by the South Florida
Water Management District (SFWMD) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USCOE)
includes restoration of the SLE ecosystem as a major component [43]. The proposed resto-
ration plan includes construction of stormwater detention/retention reservoirs for modifying
the long-term mean monthly frequency distribution of freshwater inﬂows into the SLE to be
more consistent with natural, predevelopment conditions for recovery and protection of
salinity-sensitive biota. In addition, constructed wetlands are attached to the reservoirs to
serve as multicell stormwater treatment areas (STAs) for pollutant removal. Unfortunately,
the relatively ﬂat terrain of South Florida affords few natural sites for construction of
reservoirs, requiring expensive land acquisition and excavation of diked containment areas
for development of detention storage capacity. Since these are primarily off-stream facilities,
pumping is required for diversion into the reservoirs and may also be needed for release back
to the canals or streams.
According to Haunert and Konyha [44], biota in the SLE is more sensitive to the long-term
frequency distribution of mean monthly inﬂows, rather than individual extreme hydrologic
events. Sizing of the stormwater detention facilities is a particularly challenging stochastic

optimization problem since the objective is to locate, size, and operate in a fully integrated
manner the constructed reservoir/STA systems such that mean monthly stormwater dis-
charges to the SLE reasonably match the desired natural or pre-drained probability distribu-
tion. It is hypothesized that the key to minimizing the cost of the constructed facilities for
achieving this goal is to fully incorporate real-time operational strategies within the design
and capacity sizing problem. The integrated design/operational problem is further compli-
cated by the need to consider stormwater as a multipurpose resource for augmenting water
supplies available to agricultural areas according to speciﬁed reliability measures for water
delivery. Further challenges arise in that the optimization procedure must be linked with
existing, well-calibrated hydrologic simulation models of the drainage basin for accurately
predicting system response to the stormwater management alternatives. The solution of this
problem is achieved by linking a genetic algorithm to a hydrologic simulation model for
learning the optimal fuzzy operational rules for real-time reservoir operation.
4.2. Integrated Reservoir Sizing and Operating Rule Optimization: OPTI6
4.2.1. Formulation
As presented by Wan et al. [45], the optimization model OPTI6 was developed to
determine the optimal sizing and real-time operating rules for constructed reservoir/STA
systems in the SLE watershed with the following objectives: (a) meet the target long-term
frequency distribution of stormwater discharges to the SLE for ecological remediation,
(b) provide supplemental irrigation water supply at acceptable risk levels, and (c) minimize
the capacities, and hence cost, of the reservoir/STA system for satisfying objectives (a) and
(b). The multiobjective optimization problem is formulated using the weighting method:

requirements for irrigation associated with reservoir i in any year; α is the acceptable risk level
for water supply, which is assumed as the 1-in-10-year drought in the SLE watershed;
wc(c ¼ 1, . . ., nc) are weighting factors providing a subjective ranking of the relative priority
of achieving each of the nc discrete ﬂow frequency classes targets Tc; wI is penalty factor
associated with risk target violation for irrigation water supply; wS is a weighting factor
associated with minimizing storage capacity requirements at each proposed reservoir/STA
site; nb is the number of stormwater detention/retention reservoirs; and si,cap is the maximum
storage capacity actually used in storage option i based on hydrologic simulation of the
system.
504
J.W. Labadie

Evaluation of (10.30) requires daily simulation of the watershed detention storage and
network for calculation of mean monthly probabilities Fc for all frequency classes c of
stormwater releases to the SLE. The drainage network simulation includes planned
off-stream reservoirs requiring pumping facilities for diversion into the basins, as well as
either gravity or pumped outﬂow, as depicted in Fig. 10.18. Pumping costs were excluded
from the objective function for this study, with preeminence given to the major criteria
represented in (10.30). It is also assumed that a multicell STA is connected to each
detention reservoir for reducing loads of nutrients, pesticides, and other pollutants from
stormwater runoff.
The mass balance equation for the reservoirs with connected STA is

rit is pumped release from the STA to the canal (103 m3/d); rainit and evapit are rainfall and
evaporation rates, respectively, for basin i on day t (m/d); seepi is the seepage fraction per unit
storage for basin i; and nd is the total number of days in the simulation. The simulation
assumes that a portion of the reservoir/STA seepage can return as lagged ﬂow to the canal and
is added to the stormwater release to the SLE.

Although the scheduling of diversions dit pumped into the reservoir/STA and discharges rit
pumped out are the designated decision variables, these are replaced by the net inﬂow to the
reservoir qit ¼ [dit  rit], where if qit < 0, rit ¼ |qit| and dit ¼ 0 and if qit  0, rit ¼ 0 and dit
¼ qit. Although minimization of pumping costs is not directly included in the formulation,
preventing both dit > 0 and rit > 0 to occur on any day t serves to indirectly minimizing
pumping costs.
Attempts are ﬁrst made to satisfy the water supply requirements for irrigation wsit
by removing water in storage in the reservoir at the beginning of each day. If there is
insufﬁcient basin storage to satisfy the irrigation demand, then the remainder is supplied
from basin inﬂows and transbasin diversions to satisfy the irrigation demand for that day.
Irrigation deliveries occur only if the demand can be entirely satisﬁed for that day. Insufﬁcient
available storage, inﬂows, and transbasin diversions for complete satisfaction of the daily
irrigation demand constitute a water supply failure, and no deliveries are made on that day.

A high priority is given to transbasin diversions qtransjit whereby if sufﬁcient inﬂow is
available, they can occur up to the pumping capacity after satisfaction of irrigation demands.
The ecological health of the Estuary is enhanced if stormwater releases are diverted from C-24
to the North Fork of the St. Lucie River, or south from C-23 to C-44, which enhances the salinity
balance in the SLE by reducing stormwater releases to the middle of the Estuary. The
hydrologic and drainage system simulation model allows any desired transbasin transfer
conﬁguration, with provision for transfers to be made to more than one basin. Transbasin
diversion amounts are limited by available pumping capacity, as well as restrictions imposed
if the potential exists for the transbasin diversion exacerbating ﬂooding in the receiving basin
during high-ﬂow conditions. Rules governing the scheduling of releases from Lake Okeechobee
for protection of the dykes surrounding the Lake are also incorporated, which prevents releases
from the C-44 reservoir/STA system during high water level conditions in the Lake.
4.2.2. Fuzzy Operating Rules
Optimal reservoir operating rules q
i (Iit,sit) are represented in OPTI6 as feedback policies
whereby reservoir operational guidelines are conditioned on current-day measurements of
inﬂows and reservoir storage, as well as the time of year. The optimal rules are deﬁned by a

fuzzy rule-based system with the advantage of not requiring any a priori mathematical
structure for the rules, such simpliﬁed linear decision rules.
The general structure of a fuzzy rule n is [46]
IF : a1 is An1 AND a2 is An2 AND  AND aK is AnK
THEN : Bn
ð10:40Þ
Arguments in the rule premises (IF portion) are assumed to belong to fuzzy sets, and the
consequence (THEN portion) also belongs to a fuzzy set. A fuzzy set assigns a membership
value or degree-of-truth to elements of the set, which is in contrast with Boolean logic
deﬁning crisp sets, which can be considered as a subset of fuzzy logic [47]. Membership
values of 0 indicate no truth to the assertion that an element is a member of the set, values of
1 represent complete conﬁdence in the assertion, and values between 0 and 1 signify partial
membership in the fuzzy set. Current measurements of inﬂows Iit and storage sit comprise
the facts provided to each fuzzy rule n, requiring calculation of the degree of fulﬁllment
(DOF) νin(Iit,sit) for basin i at time t. For this study, the product inference method of
calculating DOF is applied:
νin Iit; sit
ð
Þ ¼ Ain1 AND Ain2
ð
Þ ¼ μAin1 Iit
ð Þ  μAin2 sit

ð10:41Þ
where μAink ak
ð
Þ is the membership value (between 0 and 1) of argument ak (k ¼ 1: inﬂow Iit;
k ¼ 2: storage sit) in fuzzy set Aink of rule n for basin i. Fuzzy rule-based systems are
characterized by the potential for several rules with DOF values >0 for a given set of facts,
requiring the need for combining the fuzzy consequences of each of these rules. The normed
weighted sum combination method has the advantage of providing a convenient means of
defuzzifying the fuzzy consequences [46]:

This results in less weight being assigned to vague fuzzy consequences as characterized by
larger areas under the membership function.
508
J.W. Labadie

The next step is to defuzzify the fuzzy combinations, where the most popular method is
mean defuzziﬁcation:
qt Iit; Sit
ð
Þ ¼
X
Ni
n¼1
νin Iit; sit
ð

where q in is the mean of the fuzzy consequence of rule n and qt(Iit,Sit) is the defuzziﬁed
operating rule conditioned on the current inﬂow Iit and storage measurements sit provided as
facts to the fuzzy rule-based system. The combination of product inference for degree of
fulﬁllment of rule premises, normed weighted sum combination of fuzzy of consequences,
and mean defuzziﬁcation avoids the need to explicitly characterize the structure of the fuzzy
consequence membership function μBin x
ð Þ. Since only the means of the fuzzy consequences
q in for each basin i and rule n are needed, they are regarded as the decision variables that are
manipulated to determine the optimal fuzzy rules.
The fuzzy membership functions for the premises are assumed to be structured as sym-
metric, triangular fuzzy numbers, as depicted in Fig. 10.19. The Range for each type of
argument is determined using the maximum potential storage capacity for each basin and the
largest daily inﬂow occurring during simulation for the basin storage and expected inﬂow
arguments, respectively. With speciﬁcation of the desired number of arguments for each type
of premise (i.e., storage or inﬂow), the model then calculates the Support for each fuzzy
number based on the Range and the speciﬁed number of arguments. A desired degree of
Overlap of the triangular fuzzy numbers (e.g., 0.25 represents an Overlap of 25 % of the
calculated Support of each fuzzy number) can also be speciﬁed, where the recommended
degree of Overlap is usually a value between 0.20 and 0.333 [46].

The number of arguments for the storage and inﬂow premises divides these values into
discrete classes, with each class governed by a triangular membership function. As an
example, 6 argument classes speciﬁed for storage and 7 argument classes for inﬂow result in
a total of 6  7 ¼ 42 fuzzy rules generated by the model for each basin. Although increasing
the number of argument classes may provide a more accurate representation of the storage and
inﬂow amounts occurring in a basin, there is an increase in the number of rules and the
corresponding number of variables to be optimized. Each of the fuzzy rules produces means of
the fuzzy consequences q in n ¼ 1, . . . , Ni; i ¼ 1, . . . , nb
ð
Þ as the variables to be optimized.
The fuzzy means vary between 100 and 100, whereq in  0represents the percentage of total
available ﬂow actually diverted to the reservoir for that particular rule, whereas if q in < 0,
then q in
j
j is the percentage of available storage that is pumped out if. Based on the fuzzy
means, the feedback or conditional operating rules qi(Iit,sit) are calculated from (10.42) using
mean defuzziﬁcation, with daily diversion and release decisions calculated as follows:

Rainfall in South Florida varies by distinct wet and dry seasons, with the wet summer
season rainfall events primarily convective and tropical storms, whereas dry winter season
rainfall is governed by frontal systems. Distinct rules qw
i (Iit,sit) and qs
i(Iit,sit) are therefore
developed for each season by optimizing the means of the fuzzy consequences q w
in and q s
in for
the winter and summer seasons, respectively.
4.2.3. Genetic Algorithm
Each evaluation of the objective function (10.30) requires simulation of the performance of
the fuzzy operating rules using the daily hydrologic simulation model for the SLE watershed
and drainage network. Each simulation run results in a mean monthly frequency distribution
Fc for stormwater discharges to the SLE under the given sets of fuzzy operating rules. In
addition, mean annual probabilities Pi of failing to satisfy irrigation demands for basin i are
calculated from (10.39), as well as the highest daily storage requirement si,cap for each basin
i occurring during simulation. A genetic algorithm (GA) is ideal for solution of (10.30) since
no explicit analytical representation of the objective function and constraint sets is required,
which is critical for linkage with complex simulation models. Furthermore, since GAs are not
gradient-based techniques, they are capable of avoiding entrapment in local optima for highly
nonconvex and discontinuous objective functions. A GA is therefore selected as the machine
learning tool in OPTI6 for discovering the optimal fuzzy operating rules that solve (10.30).
510
J.W. Labadie

Genetic algorithms (GAs) were ﬁrst proposed by Holland [48] for modeling the evolution-
ary and adaptive processes of biological systems. Subsequently, Goldberg [49] was instru-
mental in introducing numerous researchers in wide-ranging ﬁelds to the learning capabilities
of GAs for solving np-hard optimization problems. Since then, numerous variants of genetic
and evolutionary algorithms have been applied for reliable and efﬁcient solution of complex
combinatorial problems, as well as serving as an ideal method of interfacing simulation and
optimization. As heuristic procedures, mathematical proofs of convergence to global or even
local optima are unavailable, although GAs have successfully solved numerous nonconvex
test problems with known global optima [50].
GAs differ from traditional methods of mathematical programming by operating on a
binary string coding of the variables (genotype) instead of direct manipulation of the real
number values (phenotype). The length of the string depends on the size and precision of the
real number being coded. The biological analogy is a chromosome, with each bit representing
a gene in the chromosome with a particular locus or position in the string. Whereas traditional
optimization methods perform sequential search over points in the solution space, GAs
generate populations of solutions at each step (generation). GAs attempt to maximize the
genetic ﬁtness of the individuals (i.e., variables) in the population (i.e., solution set),
corresponding to maximizing (or minimizing) the objective function, by combining survival
of the ﬁttest binary code representation with a structured yet randomized information
exchange. Because of this, GAs have been mistakenly categorized as random search methods,
but differ by utilizing historical information to probe regions of improved performance within
the search space.
As illustrated in Fig. 10.20, the basic components of a GA are populations of binary strings,
selection of the mating pool, genetic operators (i.e., crossover and mutation), replacement of
the old generation, and stopping criteria. The GA applies genetic operators that create
subsequent generations from the previous ones until the stopping criteria are satisﬁed, such
as terminating when best solution of the population fails to improve. Niching methods based
on ﬁtness sharing have been applied in GAs to avoid genetic drift or premature convergence
of the population to members with similar genetic structure. Fitness sharing involves
diminishing the ﬁtness of an individual proportion to the number of similar individuals in
the population based on a sharing function measuring the degree of similarity of the
individuals [51].

consequences q w

constructed by the fuzzy rule-based system. Performance of these fuzzy operating rules is
then evaluated through execution of the daily hydrologic and drainage network simulation
model, resulting in mean monthly frequency distributions Fc of stormwater discharges,
mean annual water supply failure probabilities Pi for each basin i, and simulated maximum
storage si,cap required in each basin i. These responses from the simulated environment
are returned to GA, allowing an interactive learning process culminating in discovery of the
best fuzzy operating rules that minimize the objective function in (10.30) (i.e., maximize
the ﬁtness).

4.3. Application of OPTI6 for Optimal Restoration Plan Development
in St. Lucie Estuary
4.3.1. Hydrologic Data and Irrigation Demands
The Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) [52] was applied to modeling
daily hydrologic responses in the SLE watershed over the historical period 1965–1995.
Enhancements to HSPF were incorporated prior to model calibration by Aqua Terra Consul-
tants [53] for simulating high water table and wetland conditions that prevail in South Florida.
The model was calibrated to the six major drainage basins within the SLE watershed, with
further subdivision into subbasins, with each in turn divided into six land use types: irrigated
agriculture (primarily citrus), nonirrigated pasture, forest, wetland, and urban lands. The 1995
land use coverage was used to represent current development conditions, with the resulting
simulation under these conditions referred to as the 1995 base. Land use projections to 2050
represent the future development condition, with the associated simulation designated as the
2050 base. Although substantial expansion of urban development is expected by 2050, it is
assumed that irrigated agriculture and wetlands will remain at current levels, but with
decreases in forest and pasture areas. HSPF was applied to predicting how these changes in
land use would impact the hydrology of the SLE watershed.

The Floridian Aquifer is an artesian aquifer that constitutes the major water supply source
for irrigated agriculture in the SLE watershed. Salinity concentrations in the aquifer have
steadily increased to the point where during extended periods of drought, signiﬁcant reduc-
tions in citrus yields can occur. Unfortunately, when the canals are dry during the winter
season, saline groundwater pumpage cannot be mixed with better quality surface water,
resulting in severe water shortages. Irrigation demands were estimated using the Agricultural
Field-Scale Irrigation Requirements Simulation (AFSIRS) model [54] based on water avail-
ability and Floridian Aquifer withdrawals within the SLE watershed.
4.3.2. Restoration Target: Flow Distribution
The target ﬂow distribution Tc as expressed in (10.30) is based on a favorable range of
stormwater discharges for salinity-sensitive biota in SLE called the salinity envelope.
Hu [55] found from salinity modeling in the SLE that mean monthly inﬂows exceeding

56.6 m3/s (2,000 ft3/s) to 85 m3/s (3,000 ft3/s) resulted in salinity levels that approached
zero in the upper SLE. These results, combined with a biological understanding of salinity
impacts on juvenile marine ﬁsh and shellﬁsh, oysters, and submerged aquatic vegetation in
the estuarine ecosystem, led to an estimated salinity envelope ranging from 10 m3/s
(350 ft3/s) to 56.6 m3/s (2,000 ft3/s).
Haunert and Konyha [44] determined acceptable frequencies of mean monthly inﬂows
within this range based on estimates of predevelopment drainage conditions in the SLE
watershed using the Natural System Model (NSM). Veriﬁcation of the NSM model results
was based on comparison with long-term measured ﬂow data from the Peace River basin
located in southwest Florida, with landscape characteristics similar to the natural,
predeveloped SLE watershed. Comparison of the cumulative probability distributions from
the NSM model, the Peace River measured ﬂow data, and post-development 1995 base
conditions is seen in Fig. 10.22. Plotted on the NSM-derived cumulative probability distri-
bution shown in Fig. 4.6 are selected discrete mean monthly inﬂow range classes c with
associated frequencies Tc calculated as the difference in cumulative probability between the
successive upper and lower limits of the ﬂow range.
4.3.3. GA for Multiobjective Optimization
The GA optimizer in OPTI6 is based on the freeware program gafortran written in
FORTRAN 90 as obtained from Dr. David Carroll (http://cuaerospace.com/carroll).
In order to maintain compatibility with other C/C++ software used in this study, gafortran
was translated into the ANSI C code gaopt.c, which is compiled with the Gnu gcc compiler

using standard C libraries. A population size of 100 was selected for application of gaopt.c,
with bounds on the fuzzy rule consequences maintained between 100 and +100, where
positive values indicate the percent of available ﬂow to be diverted to the reservoirs
(as constrained by available storage space) and negative values specify the percent (absolute
value) of storage for release from the reservoirs.
Since gaopt.c is a binary coded GA, discretization of the fuzzy rule consequences is
designed to maintain single decimal place precision of the fuzzy rule consequence variables,
which is considered sufﬁcient for this study. Selection of random pairs for mating was based
on tournament selection with shufﬂing, and niching was invoked to enhance the diversity of
successive generations. The recommended jump mutation rate of (1/npopsiz) was applied to
the genotype representation, where npopsiz is the number of individuals in the population,
with the creep mutation rate for the phenotype set at 0.02. Uniform crossover was found to
outperform single-point crossover with the recommended crossover probability of 0.5. Supe-
rior results were also produced with inclusion of elitism in the generational replacement
operation.
A multiobjective analysis was conducted with OPTI6 by varying the weighting factors in
(10.30) until a suitable compromise solution was obtained between the three speciﬁed criteria:
(a) matching the target frequency distribution of stormwater discharges to the SLE,
(b) maintaining an acceptable risk of violation of water supply requirements, and
(c) minimizing sizing requirements of the reservoir/STAs. In assigning penalty weighing
factors wc for monthly ﬂow ranges c in (10.30), ﬂows outside the favorable range
10 m3/s–56.6 m3/s (350–2,000 ft3/s) were assigned the most severe penalties, particularly
for high-ﬂow frequencies above 56.6 m3/s (2,000 ft3/s). Reduced penalties were given to ﬂows
in the range <10 m3/s (<350 ft3/s), with the lowest penalty weights applied to the interme-
diate ranges. Penalty weights wI on irrigation water supply failure and wS for minimizing
storage requirements were systematically manipulated until a desirable compromise solution
was obtained.
4.3.4. OPTI6 Results for Integrated Reservoir Sizing and Operations
Several alternatives were tested with locations and areal extents of stormwater detention/
retention reservoirs with connected STAs during development of the optimal restoration plan.
Figure 10.23 depicts the selected alternative consisting of four off-stream reservoir/STAs
located in the C-23, C-24, North Fork (NF), and C-44 basins, including associated water
control structures, pumps, levees, canals, and acquisition of approximately 4,937 ha (12,200
acres) of land. For this conﬁguration of the optimal restoration plan, it is seen from Fig. 10.24
that the OPTI6 results provide an excellent match to the NSM-based targets for the most
important high-ﬂow frequency classes, with the lower ﬂow frequency classes of less impor-
tance displaying acceptable agreement.
Although not shown here, comparison of the frequency distribution of ﬂows in C-23
between OPTI6 results and the current uncontrolled conditions provides further evidence of
the beneﬁts of the optimal restoration plan due to the added ﬂexibility of transfer of
stormwater discharges between basins. Signiﬁcant ecological improvement to the SLE is

provided since the optimal plan shows substantial reduction in stormwater discharges to the
middle SLE, which have the most direct impact on salinity imbalances in the SLE. In addition,
OPTI6 results indicate reductions in pollutant loadings to the SLE with approximately 20 % of
previously untreated stormwater inﬂows undergoing natural treatment in the STAs.

The multipurpose beneﬁts of the detention reservoirs under fully integrated, real-time
control policies as learned by OPTI6 are highlighted in Fig. 10.25 where, in stark contrast
with current uncontrolled conditions, the 10 % risk target of violating water supply require-
ments is maintained. Based on actual storage capacity requirements determined from OPTI6
as calculated by (10.37), sizing requirements of the detention reservoir/STA system are
reduced by 45,400 103 m3 (36,800 acre-ft), representing a 30 % reduction in the original
capacity estimates for restoration of the SLE, as shown in Fig. 10.26. According to USCOE

and SFWMD (2004), total expected cost of the original recommended plan was
$1,207,288,000 based on initial estimates of necessary reservoir/STA storage capacities.
Of this total, reservoir/STA construction and real estate acquisition costs were estimated as
$490,639,000. Assuming direct proportionality of these costs to capacity requirements, the
reduced sizing requirements based on OPTI6 results amount to cost savings of approxi-
mately $150,000,000, which are directly attributed to the machine learning approach of
spatial and temporal integration fuzzy optimal operating rules into the system capacity
planning and design.
Displayed in Fig. 10.27 are sample optimal fuzzy operating rules conditioned on current-
day measured inﬂows and basin storage during the summer season as derived by OPTI6 for

the C-23 basin. These optimal fuzzy operating rules specify the optimal percent of available
ﬂow that should be diverted into the reservoir on a given day, where available ﬂow is deﬁned
as the minimum of measured streamﬂows, unused capacity in the reservoir, and maximum
pump capacity for diversion. Also speciﬁed in these conditional rules are recommended
releases from the reservoir/STA as represented by the optimal percent of the smaller of
current storage in the basin and available pump capacity or hydraulic capacity of gated
outﬂow structures if pumping is not required for release.
The robustness of the fuzzy rule-based system is underscored by observing the highly
multimodal rule structure as seen in Fig. 10.27 for the C-23 basin as typical of the operating
rules derived for the other basins, suggesting that ﬂexibility of the fuzzy rules could not be
duplicated through the use of a priori deﬁned rule structures such as a piecewise linear
functions or even high-order polynomials. The high degree of nonlinearity of the fuzzy rule
structure is related to the complexity of the objective function and the underlying stochastic
hydrology of the SLE watershed. Unlike stochastic optimization approaches which attempt to
minimize the expected value of the objective, or utilize some other type of statistical measure,
the long-term frequency distribution of stormwater discharges to the St. Lucie Estuary is
directly optimized in OPTI6 based on fuzzy optimal release policies conditioned on daily
inﬂow and storage monitoring in the basin.
5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Machine learning methods within the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence are opening opportuni-
ties for signiﬁcant advances in water resources systems engineering. These powerful meth-
odologies are providing a new means of effectively linking dynamic simulation and
optimization models that fully exploits the beneﬁts of each modeling approach without
requiring adherence to simplifying assumptions and approximate mathematical structures
for modeling the environment. In addition, the difﬁcult problem of requiring explicit speci-
ﬁcation of underlying probabilistic models for solution of stochastic optimization problems is
overcome through application of machine learning. As an agent-based modeling tool,
machine learning provides a mechanism for interacting with the simulated environment as a
means of learning optimal decision strategies in complex, stochastic environments under
conﬂicting goals and objectives.
As a machine learning technique, reinforcement learning is applied to solving the chal-
lenging problem of stochastic optimization of multireservoir systems. The Q-Learning
method of reinforcement learning is a simulation-based technique rooted in dynamic pro-
gramming that circumvents the need for explicit knowledge of state transition probabilities.
Rather, the underlying stochastic behavior is learned implicitly through direct use of historical
hydrologic data and interaction with an accurate river basin simulation model. With
Q-Learning, optimal policies are developed through a forward-looking depth-ﬁrst procedure,
rather than requiring exhaustive breadth-ﬁrst evaluation of all possible combinations of
system states that gives rise to infamous curse of dimensionality in dynamic programming
and Markov decision processes. Reinforcement learning is applied to the Geum River basin,

South Korea, consisting of two major multipurpose reservoirs operated for water supply, ﬂood
control, hydropower generation, and instream ﬂow requirements. Simulation analysis com-
paring the performance of operating rules developed by Q-Learning with traditional implicit
stochastic optimization and sampling stochastic optimization methods clearly show the
superiority of the Q-Learning policies.
Real-time control of available in-line storage in combined sewer systems is a cost-effective
approach to reducing the adverse environmental impacts of sanitary sewage mixed with
stormwater from untreated overﬂows. Unfortunately, incorporation of hydraulic realism in
optimal control strategies requires computationally expensive iterative processes which
violate the severe time constraints on repeated execution of the models under rapidly
changing stormwater and sewer discharge conditions. A machine learning strategy is adopted
whereby the linked optimal control—sewer hydraulics modeling system—is executed off-line
for a wide range of spatially distributed historical storm events, with the resulting optimal gate
controls, along with the rainfall data sets as inputs, providing training data for a recurrent
artiﬁcial neural network (ANN). Once trained and tested, the recurrent ANN can be
implemented for real-time control of combined sewer systems with full consideration of
complex system hydraulics and integrated, spatially distributed system-wide control.
The neural-optimal control algorithm is demonstrated using the West Point Treatment
Plant collection system of the King County Wastewater Treatment Division, Seattle, Wash-
ington, USA. Validation results indicate that the neural-optimal control algorithm closely
tracks the optimal gate controls produced by the linked optimal control—sewer hydraulics
model—despite the fact that the latter calculations assume perfect foreknowledge of rainfall
amounts and distribution. This is signiﬁcant considering that this storm event was excluded
from the training data set for the recurrent ANN and that the neural-optimal control algorithm
requires only inputs of current and past rainfall measurements and previous gate controls. The
ability of the ANN to learn how to adapt the optimal controls to changes in rainfall intensity
and distribution in the ongoing event is clearly evident in this demonstration.
The ecosystem recovery plan for the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE), located on the southeast
coast of Florida, USA, has been developed based on coupling of a genetic algorithm with a
daily drainage network simulation model for optimal sizing and operation of the planned
reservoir-assisted stormwater treatment areas in the SLE watershed. Robust operating rules
are obtained through a machine learning approach connecting a genetic algorithm with a
simulation model of the stormwater drainage network. The genetic algorithm learns the
optimal structure of a fuzzy rule-based system through interaction with the simulated envi-
ronment to produce optimal real-time operating policies that achieve the target mean monthly
frequency distribution of stormwater inﬂows for restoration of the SLE ecosystem. In
addition, the multipurpose beneﬁts of the detention reservoirs are clearly evident by maxi-
mizing the use of the attached storage-treatment areas (STAs) for pollutant load reductions as
well as maintaining desirable risk targets for supplemental irrigation water supply from
stormwater. Signiﬁcant cost reductions were achieved under the optimal plan through reduc-
tion of total sizing requirements for the detentions basins by over 30 % from initial estimates
based on trial-and-error simulation studies. Results indicate that the optimal restoration plan
has the potential to restore and protect the mesohaline ecosystem in the SLE.

Abstract Recent years have witnessed an increase in global average air temperatures as well
as ocean temperatures, as documented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). The rise in temperature is considered irrefutable evidence of climate change, and this
has already started to have serious consequences for water resources and will have even more
dire consequences in the future. Compounding these consequences are population growth,
land-use changes and urbanization, increasing demands for water and energy, rising standards
of living, changing dietary habits, changing agricultural practices, increasing industrial
activities, increased pollution, and changing economic activities. All these will likely have
adverse effects on water resources. This article brieﬂy discusses climate change and its causes
and impacts on water resources.

1. INTRODUCTION
Water is vital for all forms of life and survival. Freshwater resources are limited, and
therefore their protection and management are of utmost importance. Sustainable manage-
ment of freshwater resources depends on an understanding of how climate, freshwater, and
biophysical and socioeconomic systems are interconnected at different spatial scales: at
watershed scales, at regional scales [1], and at a global scale [2]. Recently documented
activities contributing to climate change can be a major challenge to the availability of
freshwater quantity (too much or too less) or quality. These activities will play a critical
role in sectorial and regional vulnerability to water resource mismanagement. Examples of
vulnerabilities include multiyear drought in the USA and southern Canada, ﬂood disasters in
Bangladesh, ecosystem damage due to reduced stream ﬂow in the Murray-Darling basin in
Australia, and reduced water supply to reservoirs in northeastern Brazil. The use of water has
increased manifold over recent decades due to the increase in population, industrialization,
economic growth, energy production, changes in life style, and irrigation demand as global
irrigated land has increased approximately from 140 million ha in 1961–1963 to 270 million
ha in 1997–1999 [3]. On a global scale, basins are generally called water-stressed if they have
a per-capita water availability below 1,000 m3/year (based on long-term average runoff), and
such water-stressed basins are located in Northern Africa, the Mediterranean region, the
Middle East, the Near East, southern Asia, Northern China, Australia, the USA, Mexico,
northeastern Brazil, and the west coast of South America [4, 5], as shown in Fig. 11.1.

Therefore, the relationship between climate change and freshwater resources is of fundamen-
tal concern for the well-being of society.
Climate change leads to changes in the hydrologic cycle since different components of
the climatic system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, land surface, and
biosphere, are involved. Therefore, climate change affects water resources both directly and
indirectly. The objective of this chapter is to highlight the impact of climate change on water
resources. The chapter is organized as follows. Following a brief introduction to climate
change in Sect. 2, Sect. 3 presents an overview of the evidence for climate change, followed
by a discussion on the impact of climate change on different water resources sectors in
Sect. 4. Section 5 reviews continental-scale impacts of projected climate change on water
resources, and Sect. 6 discusses adaptation to climate change. The article is concluded
in Sect. 7.
2. CLIMATE CHANGE
2.1. What Is Climate Change?
Natural ecosystems are generally driven by climatic patterns of a region that can be
quantiﬁed by understanding the patterns in hydrometeorological variables, such as tempera-
ture, precipitation, humidity, and wind. Climate change is deﬁned by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as changes in the state of the climate that can be identiﬁed
by changes in its properties and that persist for an extended period, typically decades or
longer, due to natural internal processes or external forcing or to persistent anthropogenic
changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Another deﬁnition, this one by
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is as follows: “a
change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the
composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability
observed over comparable time periods.” The American Meteorological Society glossary
(AMS Glossary) deﬁnes climate change as “any systematic change in the long-term statistics
of climate elements (such as temperature, pressure, or winds) sustained over several decades
or longer. Climate change may be due to natural external forcings, such as changes in solar
emissions or slow changes in the Earth’s orbital elements; natural internal processes of the
climate system; or anthropogenic forcing.”
2.2. Causes of Climate Change
The causes of climate change can be regarded as a complex interaction between Earth,
atmosphere, ocean, and land systems; so the changes in any of these systems can be
both natural and anthropogenic, based on changes in atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases (GHG), aerosol levels, land use and land cover, and solar radiation
affecting the absorption, scattering, and emission of radiation within the atmosphere and
at the Earth’s surface. Some of the important factors responsible for climate change are
discussed in what follows.
Climate Change and Its Impact on Water Resources
527

2.2.1. Greenhouse Gases
One of the main causes of climate change are changes in Earth’s atmosphere due to
changes in the amounts of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and cloudiness. The anthropogenic
increase in greenhouse gas emissions, not natural variability, is responsible for most of the
warming in recent decades [6]. Since the start of the industrial era (ca. 1750), the overall effect
of human activities on climate has been one of warming. The major greenhouse gases, for
example, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and the halocarbons,
are the result of human activities, and they accumulate in the atmosphere, and the concentra-
tion increases with time, as shown in Fig. 11.2 [7]. The major causes of the increase in CO2 are
the increased use of fossil fuel use in transportation, building heating and cooling, and the
manufacture of cement and other goods. Human activities, such as agriculture, natural gas
distribution, and landﬁlls, result in increases in CH4, whereas the use of fertilizer and the
burning of fossil fuels leads to increases in N2O. The increasing use of the principal
halocarbons (chloroﬂuorocarbons) as refrigeration agents and in other industrial processes
has been found to cause stratospheric ozone depletion.
2.2.2. Radiative Forcing
The energy balance of the Earth-atmosphere system can be measured based on radiative
forcing, which is usually quantiﬁed as the rate of energy change per unit area of the globe as
measured at the top of the atmosphere. The Earth-atmosphere system gets warmer when
radiative forcing is positive; for negative radiative forcing, the energy will ultimately

years [7]. Concentration units are parts per million (ppm) and parts per billion (ppb).

decrease, leading to a cooling of the system. The major causes of forcing include increases in
greenhouse gases; tropospheric ozone increases contributing to warming; stratospheric ozone
decreases contributing to cooling; the inﬂuence of aerosol particles through reﬂection and
absorption processes; the nature of land cover around the globe principally through changes in
croplands, pastures, and forests; and persistent linear trails of condensation due to aircraft in
regions that have suitably low temperatures and high humidity [7].
2.2.3. Natural Processes
The human impact on climate during this era greatly exceeds that due to known changes in
natural processes, such as solar changes and volcanic eruptions. The original Milankovitch
theory [8] identiﬁes three types of orbital variation that could act as climate-forcing mecha-
nisms: the obliquity or tilt of the Earth’s axis (which affects the distribution of insolation in
space and time), the precession of the equinoxes, and the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit
around the Sun. The other natural processes are volcanic eruptions that release huge amounts
of gases by reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface, lower
temperatures, and change atmospheric circulation patterns, whereas tectonic movements
generate both atmospheric circulation changes and greenhouse feedback, directly or
indirectly.
2.3. Debate on Climate Change
The increase in the average surface temperature by the end of the twentieth century due to
emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) have already reached the critical
threshold for many elements of the climate system [9]. Current climate policy emphasizes
undertaking sustainable measures on long-term reductions of CO2, and even when CO2
emissions end, climate change is largely irreversible for 1,000 years [10]. A number of
forums and institutions have been established to develop actions for mitigating the adverse
impact of climate change. For example, the UNFCCC was created in 1992 to provide a
framework for policymaking to mitigate climate change by the stabilization of atmospheric
greenhouse gases at a sufﬁciently low level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic effects on the
climate. The countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol—excluding the countries of the
former Soviet Union whose economies are in transition—had increased their emissions by
9.9 % above the 1990 levels by 2006 [11].
The Kyoto Protocol, formed in 1997 and considered to be a milestone document in
international climate change policy, for the ﬁrst time established legally binding limits for
industrialized countries on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases [12]. For
example, national targets range from 8 % reductions for the European Union and some others
to 7 % for the USA, 6 % for Japan, and 0 % for Russia; it permits increases of 8 % for
Australia and 10 % for Iceland. International initiatives where the threat of climate change is
considered to be the greatest challenge facing humanity include the Montreal Protocol,
considered to be the most successful environmental treaty, which calls for reducing almost
100 ozone-depleting chemicals by 97 % [13], and recent forums, including the Bali Road Map
of 2007 and the 2009 Copenhagen Accord.

3. EVIDENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE
The following section discusses the changing patterns of temperature and precipitation
during the twentieth century as evidence of climate change.
3.1. Increases in Temperature
In its fourth assessment report, the IPCC unequivocally states that the Earth’s climate is
warming [14]. During the last century, the Earth warmed by roughly 0.6 C, with most of the
warming occurring during the period 1920–1940 and during the last 30 years. An increase has
been noted in the Earth’s surface and atmospheric temperature but this warming is not evenly
distributed across the globe. Land masses are warming faster than oceans. Higher northern
latitudes have seen larger increases, and the average temperature of the Arctic has risen by
almost twice the global average rate in the past 100 years [14]. Several places, including
mountaintops, have seen losses in ice cover. Expressed as a global average, surface temper-
atures have increased by approximately 0.74 C over the past 100 years (between 1906 and
2005), with an increase (0.35 C) occurring in the global average temperature from the 1910s
to the 1940s, followed by a slight cooling (0.1 C), and then a rapid warming (0.55 C) up to
the end of 2006 (Fig. 11.3) [15]. It is worth noting that for shorter recent periods, the slope is
greater, indicating accelerated warming.
A number of research groups around the world have produced estimates of global-scale
changes in surface temperature [16], for example, the retreat of mountain glaciers on every
continent [17], reductions in the extent of snow cover, earlier blooming of plants in spring,

and increased melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets [18]. Many studies are in
general agreement with long-term temperature variations [15], including the operational
version of the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), the National Climatic Data
Center (NCDC) [19], the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s)
Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) [20], and improved analysis of CRU/Hadley
Centre gridded land-surface air temperature version 3 (CRUTEM3) [21, 22].
The spatial pattern of changes in the annual surface temperature for 1901–2005 and
1979–2005 is shown in Fig. 11.4 [15], where differences in trends between locations can be
large, particularly for shorter time periods; based on the century-long period, warming is
statistically signiﬁcant over most of the Earth’s surface. Based on data compiled from
20 sources, including Global Historical Climatology Network, and two editions of world
weather records, from 1950 to 2004, the annual trends in minimum and maximum land-
surface air temperature averaged over regions were 0.20 C per decade and 0.14 C per
decade, respectively, with a trend in the diurnal temperature range of 0.07 C per decade
[23]. Based on the reconstructed annual Northern Hemisphere mean temperature series, the
warmth of the 1990s (3 years in particular: 1990, 1995, and 1997) was unprecedented in at
least the past 600 years [24], taking into account the self-consistently estimated uncertainties
in the reconstruction back to AD 1400.
3.2. Changes in Precipitation Patterns
The increase in evaporation due to the rise in temperature has led to more precipitation [7],
which generally increased over land located north of 30N from 1900 to 2005 but has mostly
declined over the tropics since the 1970s, and globally there has been no statistically
signiﬁcant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, with a wide variability in
patterns by region and over time. Spatial patterns of trends in annual precipitation (as a
percentage per century or per decade) during the periods 1901–2005 and 1979–2005 are
shown in Fig. 11.5 [15]; the observations include the following: (1) in most of North America,
Fig. 11.4. Linear trend of annual temperatures for 1901–2005 (left) (C per century) and 1979–2005
(right) (C per decade) [15].
Climate Change and Its Impact on Water Resources
531

and especially over high-latitude regions in Canada, annual precipitation has increased, and
the primary exception is over the southwestern parts of the USA, northwestern Mexico, and
the Baja Peninsula, where drought has prevailed in recent years; (2) across South America,
increasingly wet conditions were observed over the Amazon Basin and southeastern South
America, including Patagonia, while negative trends in annual precipitation were observed
over Chile and parts of the western coast of the continent; and (3) the largest negative trends in
annual precipitation were observed over West Africa and the Sahel.
Global annual mean precipitation is constrained by the energy budget of the troposphere,
and extreme precipitation is constrained by the atmospheric moisture content [25]; changes in
extreme precipitation are greater than those in mean precipitation. Similarly, based on the
physical mechanisms governing changes in the dynamic and thermodynamic components of
Fig. 11.5. Trend of annual land precipitation amounts for 1901–2005 (top) (percentage per century)
and 1979–2005 (bottom) (percentage per decade) [15].

V.P. Singh et al.

mean and extreme precipitation, a greater percentage increase in extreme precipitation versus
mean precipitation was observed in models [26]. Several other ﬁndings include the following:
a higher increase in tropical precipitation intensity due to an increase in water vapor, while
mid-latitude intensity increases are related to circulation changes that affect the distribution of
increased water vapor [27]; the most intense precipitation occurring in warm regions [28];
higher temperatures leading to a greater proportion of total precipitation in heavy and very
heavy precipitation events with no changes in total precipitation [29]; increases in total
precipitation, with a greater proportion falling in heavy and very heavy events if the frequency
remains constant, as demonstrated empirically [30] and theoretically [31]; rises in tempera-
ture that are likely to increase the moisture content faster than the total precipitation, which is
likely to lead to an increase in the intensity of storms [32]; increases in observed extreme
precipitation over the USA, where the increases are similar to changes expected under
greenhouse warming (e.g., [33, 34]).
4. IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON WATER RESOURCES
Water resources are sensitive to variations in climatic patterns. It is believed that there will
be changes in the water resources sector due to climate change, which is discussed in the
following section.
4.1. Runoff
Current observations and climate projections suggest that one of the most signiﬁcant
impacts of climate change will likely be on the hydrological system and, hence, on river
ﬂows and regional water resources [5, 35]. Variability in climate causes ﬂooding patterns in
space and time. During the twentieth century several studies examined potential trends in
measures of river discharge at different spatial scales, some detected signiﬁcant trends
in several indicators of ﬂow, and some demonstrated statistically signiﬁcant links with trends
in temperature or precipitation [5]. In addition, human interventions have affected ﬂow
regimes in many catchments at the global scale, and there is evidence of a broadly coherent
pattern of change in annual runoff, with some regions experiencing an increase in runoff (e.g.,
high latitudes and large parts of the USA) and others (such as parts of West Africa, southern
Europe and southernmost South America) experiencing a decrease in runoff [5, 36].
Some of the changes in runoff described in studies during the twentieth century include
widespread increases in runoff largely due to the suppression of evapotranspiration by
increasing CO2 concentrations [37]; in addition, based on a 30-year running averaged
streamﬂow, a linearly increasing pattern in four major river basins in southeastern South
America was observed after the mid-1960s, but not the same in all rivers [38]. Increasing
streamﬂow has been observed in the USA since 1940, though these increases have not been
uniform across the range of annual streamﬂows, nor have they been uniform geographically or
seasonally, as reported by the USGS using a variety of approaches [39–41]. Regions that have
experienced the most widespread increases are the Upper Mississippi, Ohio Valley, Texas-
Gulf, and the Mid-Atlantic. Fewer trends were observed in the South Atlantic Gulf region,
Climate Change and Its Impact on Water Resources
533

Missouri, and regions of the far West. The Paciﬁc Northwest and the South Atlantic Gulf
actually had a number of streamﬂow decreases, particularly in the lowest percentiles.
Long-term shifts in the timing of streamﬂow have been observed for snowmelt-dominated
basins throughout western North America since the late 1940s [42, 43]. These shifts represent
an advance to earlier streamﬂow timing by 1–4 weeks in recent decades relative to conditions
that prevailed in the 1950s through the mid-1970s, and the evidence for the shift includes
earlier snowmelt onsets and advances in the center of mass of the annual hydrograph, which is
called center timing [44]. Several researchers have highlighted an increasing runoff trend,
especially in winter and spring seasons, over the past several decades in most northern rivers,
including the largest arctic rivers in Siberia [45–47]. The causes of spring discharge increase
in Siberian regions are primarily due to earlier snowmelt associated with climate warming
during the snowmelt period [47, 48], reduction in permafrost area extent, and an increase in
active layer thickness under warming climatic conditions [48, 49].
Based on the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenario (SRES) A1B from an ensemble
of 24 climate model runs, the mean runoff change until 2050 is shown in Fig. 11.6 [36]. Major
observations include runoff change in the high latitudes of North America and Eurasia, with
increases of 10–40 % and of decreasing runoff (by 10–30 %), and in the Mediterranean,
southern Africa, and western USA/northern Mexico. In general, between the late twentieth
century and 2050, the areas of decreased runoff will expand [36].
4.2. Floods
Floods cause signiﬁcant damage to the economies of affected areas, and this is considered
to be one of the commonly occurring natural hazards around many parts of the world due to
the impact of climate change [50]. The causes of ﬂooding are many and include heavy rainfall,
torrential rain, and snowmelt; their spatial locations since 1985 are shown in Fig. 11.7. Severe
ﬂoods from high rainfall (of long or short duration) have occurred in almost all humid regions
of the world, as well as some semiarid zones. Tropical storms (known as hurricanes, cyclones,

or typhoons) are more concentrated in distribution, with hotspots around the western Paciﬁc
coasts, the Caribbean, southeastern USA, and the Bay of Bengal. The common cause of
ﬂooding in India is the tremendous impact of monsoonal rain, which causes levy breaks.
Intense rainfall of long duration induced extreme ﬂooding in ﬁve countries of central and
Eastern Europe in August 2002 [51].

Observatory since 1985. (a) Heavy rain (b) Brief torrential rain (c) Snowmelt (Source: http://www.
dartmouth.edu/~ﬂoods/archiveatlas/ﬂoodcauselocation.htm).
Climate Change and Its Impact on Water Resources
535

Detecting anthropogenically forced changes in ﬂooding is difﬁcult due to the substantial
natural variability; land-use changes on ﬂow regime further complicate the issue. For exam-
ple, changes in the risk of great ﬂoods, that is, ﬂoods with discharges exceeding a 100-year
return period from basins larger than 200,000 km2 using both streamﬂow measurements and
numerical simulations of anthropogenic climate change, and the frequency of great ﬂoods
increased substantially during the twentieth century [52]. On the global scale the number of
great inland ﬂood catastrophes during the last 10 years (between 1996 and 2005) is twice as
large, per decade, as between 1950 and 1980, while economic losses have increased by a
factor of 5 [53]. However, a warmer climate, with its increased climate variability, will
increase the risk of ﬂooding [54].
4.3. Drought
Of twentieth century natural hazards, droughts have had the greatest detrimental impact
[55, 56], and large-scale intensive droughts have been observed on all continents in recent
decades affecting large areas in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, South America, Central
America, and North America [57].
During the past two centuries, at least 40 long-duration droughts have occurred in Western
Canada. In southern regions of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, multiyear droughts
were observed in the 1890s, 1930s, and 1980s [58]. The drought situation in many European
regions has already become more severe [59]. It is observed that during the past 30 years,
Europe has been affected by a number of major drought events, most notably in 1976
(Northern and Western Europe), 1989 (most of Europe), 1991 (most of Europe), and, more
recently, the prolonged drought over large parts of Europe associated with the summer heat
wave in 2003 [60]. The impacts of droughts in the USA has increased signiﬁcantly with the
increased number of droughts or increase in their severity [61, 62]. Based on the data available
from the NCDC, USA (2002), nearly 10 % of the total land area of the United States
experienced either severe or extreme drought at any given time during the last century.
Frequent severe droughts during 1997, 1999, and 2002 in many areas of Northern China
caused signiﬁcant economic and societal losses [63]. The severe drought of 1997 in Northern
China resulted in a period of 226 days with no streamﬂow in the Yellow River, which is the
longest drying-up duration on record. There has also been an increased risk of droughts since
the late 1970s as global warming progresses and produces both higher temperatures and
increased drying [64]. In addition, drought is a recurring theme in Australia, with the most
recent, the so-called millennium drought, now having lasted for almost a decade [65].
Several investigators have highlighted more drought episodes in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
Using 15 coupled models from the IPCC AR4 simulations under the SRES A1B scenario, the
general drying over most of the planet’s land, except parts of the northern mid- and high-
latitude regions during the nongrowing season, points to a worldwide agricultural drought by
the late twenty-ﬁrst century [66]. All of the eight AR4 models show a decrease in soil
moisture for all scenarios, with a doubling of both the spatial extent of severe soil moisture
deﬁcits and frequency of short-term (4–6 months in duration) droughts from the
mid-twentieth century to the end of the twenty-ﬁrst century, while long-term (>12 months)
536
V.P. Singh et al.

droughts will become three times more common [67]. Based on the Palmer drought severity
index calculated using the Penman–Monteith potential evapotranspiration (PDSI-PM) as the
drought index, the spatial distribution of drought was obtained by calculating the trend in the
PDSI-PM per decade at each point using the A2 ensemble (Fig. 11.8) [68]. The observation
predicts drying over Amazonia, the United States, Northern Africa, Southern Europe, and
Western Eurasia and wetting over Central Africa, Eastern Asia, and high northern latitudes.
There is an overall drying trend with a decrease in the global average PDSI of 0.30/decade
projected for the ﬁrst half of the twenty-ﬁrst century, while the rate of drying over the second
half of the twenty-ﬁrst century increases, with the PDSI-PM decreasing by 0.56/decade. There
is a projected increase in the proportion of the land area under drought over the twenty-ﬁrst
century, and this increase continues throughout the twenty-ﬁrst century (Fig. 11.9) [68].
The reader may consult [56] to gain a better understanding of drought concepts and [69] for
drought under climate change scenarios.

emissions scenario [68].

4.4. Snowmelt and Glacier Melt
Many major river systems around the world are fed by snowpack and melting glaciers, and
global warming is likely to have an appreciable impact on snowmelt and associated runoff.
Glaciers are sensitive to every hydrological variable, including precipitation, humidity, and
wind speed, but mostly to temperature, and hence are a good indicator of global warming.
There is clear evidence of glacier retreat on every continent, with global warming having a
noticeable inﬂuence [70]. High-latitude and high-altitude rivers may experience an increase in
discharge despite a decrease in precipitation resulting from the melting of glaciers [71,
72]. The change in volume and timing of discharge may cause signiﬁcant ﬂuvial geomorpho-
logical changes in rivers, including channel enlargement and incision, higher sinuosity,
increased bank erosion, and faster channel migration [73].
The European Alps have lost between 30 and 40 % in surface area and around half of its
volume since the Little Ice Age, and this loss has accelerated in the late twentieth century
[70]. The Bolivian Andes lost two-thirds of their volume and 40 % in average thickness
between 1992 and 1998 and may disappear within 15 years if the current trend persists [74]. In
North America, varying gains and losses have been observed in three glaciers—South
Cascade Glacier in the Paciﬁc Northwest and Wolverine and Gulkana glaciers in Alaska
[75]. In the Himalayas, depending on the location and time period, glaciers have been
observed both retreating and advancing at varying rates. Nevertheless, the system has suffered
a net overall decrease in glacier area and thickness during the last century [76]. The Gangotri
Glacier, for example, which forms the headwaters of the Ganges River, has shrunk by 1.5 km
over 69 years but is currently retreating at a slower rate [77].
The Alaskan glacier has been shrinking by 52  15 km3/year, adding about 0.14  0.04
mm/year to sea level during the period from the mid-1950s to the mid-1990s [78]. For the
period from the mid-1990s to 2000–2001 the Alaskan glaciers have been thinning at a faster
rate, equating to a volume loss of 96  35 km3/year and a sea level rise of 0.27  0.10 mm/
year. Subpolar glaciers, for the period 1961–1997, have shrunk by 147 mm/year on average,
representing a total volume of 3.7  103 km3 [79]. Associated sea level rise has been
estimated at 0.51 mm/year for the period 1961–2003, with the rate for 1994–2003 being
0.93 mm/year, signifying faster melting [80].
In the alpine regions, studies based on scenarios project further glacier retreat [81] and loss
in thickness, while small glaciers may disappear in the near future [74]. A similar dreadful
future has been predicted for the Rockies [82], Himalayas [83, 84], Andes [85], and Australian
Alps [86]. A more recent study utilizing a global glacier model coupled with a land surface
and hydrological model showed large-scale glacier mass loss in Asia, Europe, Canadian Artic
islands, and Svalbard [87], and the mass loss has increased dramatically since 1990, resulting
in an increase in sea level by 0.76 mm/year.
The societal impacts of retreating glaciers are hard to quantify. Major rivers fed by glacial
melt sustain agriculture, domestic water needs, and water stored in dams for hydroelectric
production. If the appropriate infrastructure is not put in place, the additional water issuing
from melting glaciers may lead to devastating ﬂoods, or droughts as the timing of the runoff
changes. The costs for additional power capacity to cope with retreating glaciers in Peru are
estimated to be around US$1 billion per gigawatt [88].

4.5. Water Quality
There has been an increase in temperature as observed in the past century, and climate
change models also predict increasing temperatures. Warmer temperatures can affect water
quality in several ways, including decreased dissolved oxygen levels, increased contaminant
load to water bodies, reduced stream and river ﬂows, increased algal blooms, and an
increased likelihood of saltwater intrusion near coastal regions. Acid rain is one of the
primary reasons for degrading water quality, and the principal cause of this is sulfuric and
nitrogen compounds from human actions, and variations in streamﬂow characteristics will
alter the transport of chemical loads in rivers. Due to low ﬂows in rivers, the dilution process
between water and waste will be affected, which can increase the mineralization of organic
nitrogen in soil.
Warmer water holds less oxygen, so global warming would lead to lower dissolved oxygen
contents. An increase in runoff and erosion due to greater precipitation intensity will result in
increased pollutant transport. Several other factors inﬂuencing water quality include soil,
geological formations and terrain in catchment areas (river basins), surrounding vegetation,
human activities, precipitation and runoff from adjacent land, and biological, physical, and
chemical processes in water.
Studies reveal a rise in surface water temperature since the 1960s in Europe, North
America, and Asia of between 0.2 and 2 C, which is mainly due to atmospheric warming
in relation to solar radiation increases [5, 89]. For example, after the severe drought of
2003, there was an average increase in water temperature of around 2 C, in the Rhine
and Meuse Rivers causing a decrease in a decrease in dissolved oxygen (DO) [90].
The stratiﬁed period has lengthened by 2–3 weeks due to a rise in temperature of
0.2–1.5 C in several lakes in Europe and Northern America, which affects thermal stratiﬁ-
cation and lake hydrodynamics [89].
Many factors that are inﬂuenced by climate change, including air temperature, rainfall
intensity, atmospheric CO2 (increase) and acid deposition (decrease) levels, have shown
signiﬁcant dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increases in Northern Europe [91–93], Central
Europe [94], and North America [92].
Changes in weather patterns have a signiﬁcant impact on nutrient loading [95]. A warmer
climate affects water bodies, leading to increased nutrients loads in surface and groundwater
[90]. Rainfall patterns, including seasonality and intensity, along with increased air temper-
atures, are the main drivers for changing the fate and behaviors of pesticides [96].
Several studies investigated the impact of climate change on water quality in future
decades. An increase in water temperature of around 2 C by 2070 in European lakes,
depending on the lake characteristics and the season, would place shallow lakes at the highest
risk of being adversely affected by climate change [97, 98]. In addition, the residence time of
lakes would probably increase in summer by 92 % in 2050 for lakes with short residence times
[97]. The deepest lakes are most sensitive to climate warming over a long period of time due
to their greater heat storage capacity and will consequently show the highest winter temper-
atures [97]. An increase in water temperature would also affect lake chemical processes with

increases in pH and greater in-lake alkalinity generation [99]. Higher nitrate concentration in
rivers can occur due to an increase in summertime frequency, which might lead to a gradual
mobilization of nitrates in soils that would be ﬂushed into streams at the beginning of the wet
seasons [100]. Other studies have pointed to increases in nitrate concentration in the Seine
basin aquifer layers for the years 2050 and 2100 due to an increase in precipitation and,
consequently, in soil leaching [101] and a 40–50 % increase in nitrate ﬂux by 2070–2100 in a
Norwegian river basin due to an increase in precipitation and, consequently, in soil
leaching [102].
4.6. Groundwater
Global warming will likely affect groundwater resources by altering precipitation and
temperature patterns, which will likely be further aggravated by overexploitation. Based on
NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin satellites [103], the
groundwater in the states of Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana in India is declining at a rate
of 33 cm/year. Similar studies in the United States showed that groundwater in the San
Joaquin Valley in California has been dropping by 60–150 cm over the last 5 years
[104]. Groundwater recharge is affected by land-use and land-cover change, urbanization,
loss in forest cover, changes in cropping patterns and rotation, and changes in soil properties
occurring over a long period of time that may affect inﬁltration capacity.
The recharge dynamics of the Edwards Balcones Fault Zone Aquifer in Texas, USA, based
on climate change, coupled with water requirements for the year 2050, are such that climate
change would result in an increase in the springﬂow for that area, but growing demand will be
the major factor of concern for the aquifer [105]. A study on the effect and resulting change in
the hydrological cycle in Bie´vre-Valloire in Grenoble [106], due to a doubling in CO2 and its
ensuing effect on groundwater recharge, it was found that global warming would not cause a
major change in rainfall patterns but may result in a large increase in evaporation and a
decrease in recharge. Further, changes in land use land cover and changes in precipitation
regimes (ﬂash rainfall instead of drizzles) could alter runoff patterns and further reduce
recharge.
Based on the four climate scenarios, the computed groundwater recharge decreases dra-
matically by more than 70 % in northeastern Brazil, southwest Africa, and along the southern
rim of the Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 11.10) [54, 107]. Regions with groundwater recharge
increases of more than 30 % by the 2050s include the Sahel, the Near East, Northern China,
Siberia, and the western USA. Understanding the future concerns of groundwater resources,
UNESCO-IHP (International Hydrological Programme) has established the Groundwater
Resources Assessment under the Pressures of Humanity and Climate Changes (GRAPHIC)
project to study the interaction between groundwater and the global water cycle, how it
supports ecosystems and humankind, and the threats posed by a growing population and
climate change [108]. The study will be carried out on every continent and will make use of
various recent technologies in assessing and monitoring changes to groundwater, including
GRACE.

4.7. Transboundary Problems
A remote sensing study showed that 261 river basins, covering 45.3 % of the land surface
of the Earth (excluding Antarctica), extends beyond political boundaries and are shared by
two or more countries [109]. These basins carry around 60 % of the surface water ﬂows and
are home to 40 % of the world’s population. The sharing of a watercourse has, due to its
sensitive nature, given rise to several instances for concern and has created opportunities for
either conﬂict or cooperation. Several nations have conceded that it is not in their interest to
wage war over water and have, even in the event of hostility associated with other issues,
managed to successfully work toward agreements and treaties. There exist more than
300 treaties dealing with a wide array of nonnavigational uses of water in international basins
[109]. In the last 50 years alone, no less than 157 treaties have been negotiated [110].
Nevertheless, the potential for conﬂict has not yet been eliminated.
Four general theories have inspired legislators in debates around the nonnavigational
uses of international watercourses [111], namely, absolute territorial sovereignty, absolute
Fig. 11.10. Simulated impact of climate change on long-term average annual diffuse groundwater
recharge based on percentage changes of 30-year average groundwater recharge between present day
(1961–1990) and 2050s (2041–2070) based on four different climate change scenarios [54, 107].
Climate Change and Its Impact on Water Resources
541

territorial integrity, limited territorial sovereignty, and the concept of community of interests.
Global warming is perceived by many as a new threat to relations over transboundary basins
because it interferes with the hydrological cycle, inﬂuencing the timing, quantity, and even
quality of both surface and groundwater. The IPCC, in its Third Assessment Report [112],
states that
. . .where there are disputes, the threat of climate change is likely to exacerbate, rather than ameliorate, matters
because of uncertainty about the amount of future resources that it engenders. One major implication of climate
change for agreements between competing users (within a region or upstream versus downstream) is that
allocating rights in absolute terms may lead to further disputes in years to come when the total absolute amount
of water available may be different.
The following section highlights some examples of the impact of climate change on
transboundary rivers.
4.7.1. Nile River Basin
The Nile is the world’s longest river and is transboundary to 11 countries in Africa. It drains
approximately 3.3 million km2 and is home to 160 million people. The river has been subject to
a number of treaties, some dating back to colonial times [113]. The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI),
a relatively new effort among 9 of the 11 riparian countries, puts the concept of community
of interests into action. The basin has been the subject of a number of papers on the effect of
climate change. Based on a water balance model for 12 subcatchments of the Nile, the effect
of climate change for ﬁve different General Circulation Model (GCMs) [114] highlights
the higher ﬂows in equatorial Africa and the expansion of the Sudd swamps, and, depending
on the GCM used, the response on the Ethiopian highlands of the Blue Nile and Atbara
basins varied.
4.7.2. Danube River Basin
The Danube River Basin is the second longest river in Europe and is one of the most
international river basins. It is shared among ten countries and is home to 85 million people.
The basin is already threatened because it faces deteriorating water quality and ecological
problems due to its heavy use of electricity generation [116]. With global warming, the ﬂow in
the Danube may decrease by 16 % toward the end of the century [117]. A reduction in ﬂow
will exacerbate the water quality problem. A Danube River Basin Management Plan has been
formulated to address the impact of climate change and water quality issues in the river
to ensure satisfactory socioeconomic development without further threatening the ecology
of the river [118].
4.7.3. Rio Grande Basin
The Rio Grande or Rı´o Bravo del Norte is a transboundary river between three states within
the Unites States and between the United States and Mexico. The river is fed by snow melt
from the Rockies and runs through arid and semiarid areas. The water in the river is
overallocated, and on several instances it has not made it to the Gulf of Mexico. By the
542
V.P. Singh et al.

time the river reaches the Presidio, along the Texas Mexico border, the ﬂow is almost
negligible and is restored by water from the Rı´o Conchos, a Mexican tributary. Predictions
from climate models suggest that this region will become drier and droughts will be more
frequent. The effect of climate change using ﬁve GCMs and two emission scenarios (A2 and
A1B) on the Rı´o Conchos will be a decrease in precipitation, which will result in a reduction
in ﬂow at the basin outlet in Ojinaga by approximately 18 % [119]. Winter and summer ﬂows
are expected to decrease by 25 % toward the end of the century.
4.8. Agriculture
The agricultural sector is a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions due to land conversion,
including deforestation, tillage and burning practices, volatilization of organic and inorganic
fertilizers, and methane emission from ruminant livestock and paddy rice cultivation.
Globally, carbon dioxide emissions from land-use change (approximately 1,600 million
tons C/year), largely driven by agricultural expansion, grew most rapidly in the period
1950–1970. Also, agriculture is the major anthropogenic source of methane, a gas with
very high global warming potential [120, 121].
Approximately 70 % of the world’s freshwater use goes to agriculture, and already some
30 developing countries are facing water shortages; by 2050 this number will increase to some
55 countries, the majority in the developing world [122]. This water scarcity, together with the
degradation of arable land, could become the most serious obstacle to increasing food
production. The vulnerability of agricultural sectors to climate change is mainly due to
changes in precipitation and temperature, and, consequently, the likely impacts on the
agricultural sector have prompted concern over the magnitude of future global food produc-
tion [123]. Many countries are agriculture dependent; therefore, climate change could create a
linkage between the agricultural sector and poverty and is likely to affect many developing
countries. For example, in Africa, it is estimated that nearly 60–70 % of the population is
dependent on the agricultural sector for employment, and this sector contributes on average
nearly 34 % to the gross domestic product (GDP) per country, whereas in the case of the West
African Sahel alone, more than 80 % of the population is involved in agriculture and stock
farming in rural areas [124]. Findings of several investigations highlight that the degree of
vulnerability of the agricultural sector depends on local biological conditions, moisture
content, cropping patterns, extent of knowledge, and awareness of expected changes in the
climate, and the increased uncertainty of climate effects represents an additional problem that
farmers must address.
Human-induced climate change has the potential to substantially alter agricultural systems
[125–127]. Climate change will affect agricultural productivity characterized mainly by ﬁve
factors, including changes in precipitation, temperature, carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization,
climate variability, and surface water runoff [128]. However, precipitation and temperature
will have direct effects as these combinations are useful for determining the availability of
freshwater and the level of soil moisture, which are critical inputs for crop growth. Also,
higher precipitation leads to a reduction in yield variability [129], and higher precipitation
will reduce the yield gap between rainfed and irrigated agriculture, but it may also have a
Climate Change and Its Impact on Water Resources
543

negative impact if extreme precipitation causes ﬂooding [130]. The combination of temper-
ature and soil moisture determines the length of the growing season and controls crop
development and water requirements; however, in arid and semiarid areas, higher tempera-
tures will shorten the crop cycle and reduce crop yields [131].
Several studies have been carried out to assess crop yield based on climate change impacts.
Based on a statistical model using 22 climate models and three IPCC global emissions
scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1), temperature increases of 1–3 C would reduce yields of
three temperate-zone California perennials (almond, walnut, and table grapes) by 2050, even
without consideration of possible impacts on irrigation water availability [132]. Similarly,
climate-change-induced drought episodes affect agricultural productivity; for example, peri-
odic drought in the Yakima basin will lead to substantial reductions in crop yields and
increases in economic risk both in dry years under the current climate scenario and in a future
climate with 2 C warming and no change in annual precipitation [133].
Some studies have investigated crop productivity for Europe, where an overall increase in
crop productivity is anticipated as a result of climate change and increased atmospheric
carbon dioxide (CO2); however, because of technological developments, wheat yields will
increase by 37–101 % by the 2050s, depending on the scenario [134]. However, air pollution
could also reduce crop yields since tropospheric ozone has negative effects on biomass
productivity [135, 136]. Also, annual temperature increases may lead to a longer crop (and
grass) growing season and vegetative growth and cover, particularly in Northern Europe
[137]. Negative impacts in Northern Europe could include increased pest and disease pres-
sures and nutrient leaching and reduced soil organic matter (SOM) content [138]. There could
be an increasing demand for water for crop irrigation (up to 10 %, depending on the crop
type), especially in southern and Mediterranean regions [139], and for fruit and vegetable
production in Northern Europe [140].
4.9. Ecosystems
Physical processes and biological systems on many scales have been altered due to global
climate change caused by the sudden increase in the energy balance of the planet, which
affects ecosystems that support human society [7]. This may cause sudden, irreversible effects
that fundamentally change the function and structure of the ecosystem, with potentially huge
impacts on human society [141]. The global ecosystem is sensitive to many components
[142], including large variability and extremes of CO2 and climate throughout geological
history [143]; anthropogenic changes, such as land use, nitrogen deposition, pollution, and
invasive species [144]; natural disturbance regimes (e.g., wildﬁre); and subtle changes in
management practices within a given land-use type, e.g., intensiﬁcation of agricultural
practices [145]. Land-use changes, habitat loss, and fragmentation have long been recognized
as important causes of ecosystem change, particularly changes in biodiversity [146]. A regime
shift occurs in ecosystems, such that even small changes in physical conditions can provoke a
regime shift that may not be easily or symmetrically reversed [7, 147], and most initial
ecosystem responses appear to dampen change [148], although ecosystems are likely to
respond to increasing external forcing in a nonlinear manner.

V.P. Singh et al.

Deserts, one of the largest terrestrial biomes, are likely to experience more episodic climate
events, and interannual variability may increase in the future, although there is substantial
disagreement among GCM projections and across different regions [149]. Vulnerability to
desertiﬁcation will likely be exacerbated due to increases in the incidence of severe drought
globally [68]; for example, in the Americas, temperate deserts are projected to expand
substantially under doubled CO2 climate scenarios [150]. Further, desert biodiversity is likely
to be affected by climate change [144]; for example, 2,800 plant species in the Succulent Karoo
biome of South Africa as a bioclimatically suitable habitat could be reduced by 80 % with
global warming of 1.5–2.7 C above preindustrial levels [142]. Rainfall change and variability
are very likely to affect vegetation in tropical grassland and savanna systems [151]. Changing
amounts and variability of rainfall may also strongly control temperate grassland responses to
future climate change [152]. The Mediterranean Basin regions, however, could see increased
occurrence of ﬁres [153], and doubled CO2 climate scenarios could increase wildﬁre events by
40–50 % in California [154] and double the ﬁre risk in Cape Fynbos [155].
Inland aquatic ecosystems will be affected by climate change directly with rises in
temperature and CO2 concentrations and indirectly through alterations in the hydrology
resulting from changes in regional or global precipitation regimes [156]. Microorganisms,
benthic invertebrates, and many species of ﬁsh will be negatively affected by higher temper-
atures [157]; invertebrates, waterfowl, and tropical invasive biota are likely to shift poleward
[158] with some potentially going extinct [159]. Other major changes will likely occur in
species composition, seasonality, and the production of planktonic communities and their
food web interactions [160]. Enhanced UV-B radiation and increased summer precipitation
will signiﬁcantly increase dissolved organic carbon concentrations, altering major biogeo-
chemical cycles [161]. Wetland plants and animals at different stages of their life cycle are
affected by small increases in the variability of precipitation [162]. In monsoonal regions,
increased variability risks that diminish wetland biodiversity and prolonged dry periods
promote terrestrialization of wetlands, for example, in Keoladeo National Park, India
[163]. There is evidence of riparian ecosystems among many rivers around the world
experiencing additional pressure due to changes in climate and land-use practices [164],
whereas the pattern of freshwater ﬂows will affect coastal wetlands due to changes in salinity,
sediment inputs, and nutrient loadings [165].
5. CONTINENTAL-SCALE IMPACT OF PROJECTED CLIMATE
CHANGES ON WATER RESOURCES
Future climate projections are made based on four IPCC SRES [166] storylines considering
a range of plausible changes in population and economic activity over the twenty-ﬁrst century.
The scenarios include: A1 storyline and scenario family (a future world of very rapid
economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and
rapid introduction of new and more efﬁcient technologies); A2 storyline and scenario family
(a very heterogeneous world with continuously increasing global population and regionally
oriented economic growth that is more fragmented and slower than in other storylines);
Climate Change and Its Impact on Water Resources
545

B1 storyline and scenario family (a convergent world with the same global population as in
the A1 storyline but with rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and infor-
mation economy); B2 storyline and scenario family (a world in which the emphasis is on local
solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability, with continuously increasing
population but lower than A2 and intermediate economic development).
Due to advances in modeling as well as in our understanding of the physical processes
involved, it has been possible to make more reliable climate projections. The development of
Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) remains the foundation for pro-
jections, though they cannot provide information at scales ﬁner than their computational
grids. The climatic patterns are region-speciﬁc due to several reasons [167], which include an
uneven distribution of solar heating; individual responses of the atmosphere, oceans, and land
surface; interactions among these; and physical characteristics of the regions. Therefore, it
will be useful to study the projected climate for different regions. The following region-
speciﬁc discussions are based on the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007,
where the information is drawn from AOGCM simulations, downscaling of AOGCM-
simulated data using techniques to enhance regional detail, physical understanding of the
processes governing regional responses, and recent historical climate change [167].
5.1. Africa
During the twenty-ﬁrst century all of Africa is very likely to warm, and the warming is very
likely to be larger than the global, annual mean warming throughout the continent and in all
seasons, with drier subtropical regions warming more than the moister tropics. Annual rainfall
is likely to decrease in much of Mediterranean Africa, the northern Sahara, and southern
Africa during winter, whereas there is likely to be an increase in annual mean rainfall in
East Africa [167].
Climate change is expected to exacerbate critical water stress conditions before 2025 due to
rises in water demand and in population. Based on the full range of SRES scenarios, the
population to be affected is projected to be 75–250 million and 350–600 million people by the
2020s and 2050s, respectively [168]. Groundwater is the most common primary source of
drinking water in Africa, particularly in rural areas, and its recharge is projected to decrease
with decreased precipitation and runoff, resulting in increased water stress in those areas
[5]. Similarly, projections of hydroelectric power generation, conducted based on projections
of future runoff, indicate that hydropower generation would be negatively affected by climate
change, particularly in river basins situated in subhumid regions [169].
Several studies have linked climate change with health issues on the continent. For
example, results from the Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa project indicate changes in the
distribution of climate-suitable areas for malaria by 2020, 2050, and 2080 [170]. From an
agricultural perspective, the net crop revenues would likely fall by as much as 90 % based on
the three scenarios [171]. The changes in freshwater ﬂows and greater intrusion of saltwater
into lagoons would affect species that form the basis of inland ﬁsheries, which is considered to
be an important source of revenue [172]. The reduction in soil moisture could affect natural
systems in several ways [5], for example, signiﬁcant extinctions in both plant and animal
546
V.P. Singh et al.

species as over 5,000 plant species could be impacted by climate change, mainly due to the
loss of suitable habitats. In addition, the Fynbos biome is projected to lose 51–61 % of its
extent due to decreased winter precipitation.
5.2. Europe
Overall, the annual mean temperature is likely to increase more than the global mean.
Northern Europe is likely to experience the greatest warming during winter, whereas in
summer the most dramatic warming will likely occur in the Mediterranean area. In addition,
the increase is more likely in the lowest winter temperature in comparison to average
temperature in northern Europe, and in southern and central Europe, the highest summer
temperatures are likely to increase more than the average summer temperature. Annual
precipitation is very likely to increase in most of northern Europe and decrease in most of
the Mediterranean area. Based on seasons, precipitation will likely increase in winter and
decrease in summer in central Europe, whereas the annual number of precipitation days is
very likely to decrease in the Mediterranean area. The daily precipitation extremes are very
likely to increase in northern Europe, and summer drought is likely to affect central Europe
and the Mediterranean area more. The duration of the snow season and snow depth are likely
to decrease in most of Europe [167].
European countries will face a range of impacts on water resources due to climate change
[5]. These impacts are summarized in this section. Annual average runoff is projected to
increase in northern Europe (north of 47N) by approximately 5–15 % up to the 2020s and by
9–22 % up to the 2070s, under the A2 and B2 scenarios and climate scenarios from two
different climate models [173], whereas in southern Europe (south of 47N), runoff is
projected to decrease by 0–23 % up to the 2020s and by 6–36 % up to the 2070s (for the
same set of assumptions). There is a possibility of a reduction in groundwater recharge in
central and eastern Europe [174], with a larger reduction in valleys [175] and lowlands, e.g., in
the Hungarian steppes [176].
An increase in irrigation water demand will likely make regions more prone to the drought
risk in the Mediterranean and some parts of central and eastern Europe [177]. Also, irrigation
needs will substantially increase in countries where they hardly exist today [178]. The risk of
ﬂooding is projected to increase throughout the continent [5], and the regions most prone to
increases in ﬂood frequencies are eastern Europe, then northern Europe, the Atlantic coast,
and central Europe, while projections for southern and southeastern Europe show signiﬁcant
increases in drought frequency. In some regions, the risks of both ﬂoods and droughts are
projected to increase simultaneously. Increases in the intensity of daily precipitation events
are likely to be observed even in areas with a decrease in the mean precipitation, such as
central Europe and Mediterranean regions [179]. The Mediterranean regions and even much
of eastern Europe may experience an increase in dry periods by the late twenty-ﬁrst century
[180]. The hydropower potential for all of Europe is expected to decline by 6 %, which
translates into a 20–50 % decrease around the Mediterranean, a 15–30 % increase in northern
and eastern Europe, and a stable hydropower pattern for western and central Europe
[181]. Extreme rainfall and droughts can increase the total microbial loads in freshwater
Climate Change and Its Impact on Water Resources
547

and have implications for disease outbreaks and water-quality monitoring [5]. The predicted
increase in extreme weather events is projected to increase yield variability [182] and reduce
average yield [183].
5.3. Asia
It is very likely that Asia will warm during the twenty-ﬁrst century, and warming could
vary by region, for example, temperatures could be well above the global mean in central
Asia, the Tibetan Plateau, and northern Asia be above the global mean in East and South Asia,
and be similar to the global mean in Southeast Asia. Similarly, changes will likely be observed
in precipitation patterns; boreal winter precipitation is very likely to increase in northern Asia
and the Tibetan Plateau and likely to increase in eastern Asia and the southern parts of
Southeast Asia; summer precipitation is likely to increase in northern Asia, East and South
Asia, and most of Southeast Asia, but it is likely to decrease in central Asia.
Changes will likely be observed in extreme events, and the frequency of intense
precipitation events in parts of South Asia and in East Asia will likely increase; summer
heat waves/hot spells in East Asia will be of longer duration, more intense, and more frequent;
and tropical cyclones are likely to increase in East, Southeast, and South Asia.
Several impacts are likely to be observed in the water resources sector in Asian countries
[5]. One of the major changes is in seasonality and the amount of water ﬂows in river systems.
That could signiﬁcantly alter the variability of river runoff such that extremely low runoff
events might occur much more frequently in the crop-growing regions of the southwest parts
of Russia [184]. The availability of surface water from major rivers, such as the Euphrates and
Tigris, might be affected by the alteration in river ﬂow. In comparison to 1961–1990, the
maximum monthly ﬂow of the Mekong River is projected to increase more in the basin in
comparison to the delta, with a lower value estimated for the years 2010–2038 and a higher
value for the years 2070–2099 [5].
The central part of Asia is expected to witness an increased probability of events such as
mudﬂows and avalanches due to the rise in temperature [185]. There is likely to be a 27 %
decline in glacier extent, a 10–15 % decline in frozen soil area, an increase in ﬂood and debris
ﬂow, and more severe water shortages by 2050 compared with 1961–1990 in Northwest China
[186]. There is likely to be a reduction of 20–40 % in runoff per capita in Ningxia, Xinjiang,
and Qinghai Provinces by the end of the twenty-ﬁrst century [187]. Based on the SRES A1B
scenario, there is likely to be an increase of 1.1–1.2 times in ﬂood risk in Tokyo (Japan)
between 2050 and 2300 compared with present risk levels [188]. The gross per capita water
availability in India is projected to decline from approximately 1,820 m3/year in 2001 to as
little as 1,140 m3/year in 2050 as a result of population growth [189], which is likely to be
affected by spatiotemporal precipitation variability. Severe water stress will be one of the
most pressing environmental problems in South and Southeast Asia in the future. It is
estimated that under the full range of SRES scenarios, from 120 million to 1.2 billion and
from 185 to 981 million people will experience increased water stress by the 2020s and the
2050s, respectively [168]. The variability in runoff will have a signiﬁcant effect on
hydropower-generating countries, such as Tajikistan [190]. The increases in water demand
548
V.P. Singh et al.

and soil-moisture deﬁcit, along with a projected decline in precipitation, could lead to water-
related challenges in future rainfed crops in the plains of northern and northeastern China
[191]. In addition, in northern China, irrigation from surface water and groundwater sources is
projected to meet only 70 % of the water requirement for agricultural production due to the
effects of climate change and increasing demand [186].
5.4. North America
The annual mean warming of all of North America is very likely to exceed the global mean
warming in most areas, and the warming is likely to be greatest in winter in northern regions.
Based on the lowest winter temperature, northern North America is likely to witness an
increase in temperature that will be greater than the average winter temperature, whereas the
highest summer temperatures are likely to increase more than the average summer temper-
ature in the southwestern parts of the USA. The northeastern parts of the USA and Canada are
very likely to witness an increase in annual precipitation, whereas the American Southwest is
likely to witness a decrease in precipitation. Winter and spring precipitation is likely to
increase in southern Canada but decrease in summer. The snow depth in the northernmost
part of Canada will likely increase, whereas the snow season length and snow depth are very
likely to decrease in most of North America [192].
Annual mean precipitation is projected to decrease in the southwestern USA but increase
over most of the remainder of North America up to 2100, whereas increases in precipitation in
Canada are projected to be in the range of +20 % for the annual mean and +30 % for winter,
under the A1B scenario [5]. Some studies project widespread increases in extreme precipi-
tation but also droughts associated with greater temporal variability in precipitation.
The variability in runoff affects hydropower production signiﬁcantly; for example, the
impact of lengthy droughts on the Great Lakes in 1999 signiﬁcantly affected hydropower
production [193]. With an increase of 2–3 C in warming in the British Columbia Hydro
service areas, the hydroelectric supply under worst-case water conditions for winter peak
demand will likely increase; in addition, Colorado River hydropower yields will likely
decrease signiﬁcantly [194], as will Great Lakes hydropower [195].
Waterborne diseases and degraded water quality are very likely to increase with heavier
precipitation. Waterborne diseases are likely to be clustered in key watersheds due to many
factors, including heavy precipitation in the USA [196] and extreme precipitation and warmer
temperatures in Canada [197]. Moreover, heavy runoff following severe rainfall can also
contaminate recreational waters through higher bacterial count [198]. Several investigations
highlighted that moderate climate change will likely increase yields of North American
rainfed agriculture, but with smaller increases and more spatial variability than in earlier
estimates [199]; however, many climate projections indicate decreasing yields (currently
under climate threshold) in terms of quality, or both, with even modest warming [200]. In
another example, water availability will be the major factor limiting agriculture in southeast
Arizona [201]. The changes in rainfall patterns and drought regimes could lead to ecosystem
disturbances [202] and cause the areal extent of drought-limited ecosystems to increase 11 %
per 1 C warming in the continental USA [203].
Climate Change and Its Impact on Water Resources
549

5.5. Central and South America (Latin America)
Central and South America will likely be warmer during the twenty-ﬁrst century, and
annual mean warming will be larger than the global mean warming in most of parts, whereas
warming similar to that of the global mean is likely to be observed in southern South America.
Annual precipitation is likely to decrease in most of Central America, with the relatively dry
boreal spring becoming drier; in the southern Andes, relative precipitation changes will be
greatest in summer. Increasing precipitation is likely in Tierra del Fuego during winter and in
southeastern South America during summer.
According to different climate models, the projected mean temperature for Latin America
ranges from 1 to 4 C for the B2 emissions scenario and from 2 to 6 C for the A2 scenario for
2100 [5]. In the absence of climate change, the number of people living in already water-
stressed watersheds is estimated at 22.2 million (in 1995), whereas under the SRES scenarios,
this number is estimated to increase to between 12 and 81 million in the 2020s and to between
79 and 178 million in the 2050s [168]. The potential vulnerabilities in many regions of Latin
American countries are likely to increase as a result of rising populations and their concom-
itant increased demands on water supplies and irrigation and as a result of the expected drier
conditions in many basins. Glacial retreat is projected to impact the generation of hydroelec-
tricity in countries such as Colombia and Peru [204], whereas some small tropical glaciers
have already disappeared, which is likely to affect hydropower generation [74].
Approximately 31 % of the Latin American population lives in areas at risk of malaria
(i.e., tropical and subtropical regions) [205], and, based on SRES emissions scenarios and
socioeconomic scenarios, some projections indicate that additional numbers of people will
be at risk in areas around the southern limit of the disease distribution in South America
[206]. The reason for this is the decrease in the length of the transmission season of
malaria due to the reduction in precipitation, such as the Amazon and Central America.
There is also the possibility of a substantial increase in the number of people at risk of
dengue due to changes in the geographical limits of transmission in Mexico, Brazil, Peru,
and Ecuador [207].
Based on several studies using crop simulation models, under climate change, for com-
mercial crops, the number of people at risk of hunger under SRES emissions scenario A2 is
projected to increase by one million in 2020, while it is projected that there will be no change
for 2050 and that the number will decrease by four million in 2080 [5]. The biodiversity of the
region is likely to be affected due to a complex set of alterations comprising modiﬁcations in
rainfall and runoff, and a replacement of tropical forest by savannas is expected in eastern
Amazonia and in the tropical forests of central and southern Mexico, along with replacement
of semiarid by arid vegetation in parts of northeastern Brazil and most of central and northern
Mexico due to the synergistic effects of both land-use and climate changes [5].
5.6. Australia and New Zealand
All of Australia and New Zealand are very likely to warm during this century, comparable
overall to the global mean warming. Precipitation is likely to decrease in southern Australia in
winter and spring and in southwestern Australia in winter, whereas there is likely to be an
550
V.P. Singh et al.

increase in precipitation in the western part of the South Island of New Zealand. The extremes
based on daily precipitation are very likely to increase; increased risk of drought in southern
areas of Australia is also likely to occur.
Australia’s largest river basin, Murray-Darling, accounts for approximately 70 % of
irrigated crops and pastures [208], and according to the SRES A1 and B1 emissions
scenarios and a wide range of GCMs, annual streamﬂow in the basin is projected to fall
10–25 % by 2050 and 16–48 % by 2100, with salinity changes of 8 to +19 % and 25 to
+72 %, respectively [209]. Similarly, water security problems are very likely to increase by
2030 in southern and eastern Australia and in parts of eastern New Zealand that are far
from major rivers [5]. The runoff in 29 Victorian catchments is projected to decline
by 0–45 % [210].
Energy production is likely to be affected in Australia and New Zealand in regions
where climate-induced reductions in water supplies lead to reductions in feed water for
hydropower turbines and cooling water for thermal power plants. Cropping and other
agricultural industries are likely to be threatened where irrigation water availability is
reduced [211].
Heavier rainfall events are likely to affect mosquito breeding and increase the variability in
annual rates of Ross River disease, particularly in temperate and semiarid areas [212]. Aus-
tralia faces a threat from dengue, and outbreaks of dengue have occurred with increasing
frequency and magnitude in far northern Australia over the past decade. Possible changes are
likely to occur in a range of geographical regions and in the seasonality of some mosquito-
borne infectious diseases, e.g., Ross River disease, dengue, and malaria. The other major
problem in water quality is eutrophication [213], and toxic algal blooms could increase in
frequency and be present for a longer time due to climate change. They can pose a threat to
human health for both recreation and consumptive water use and can kill ﬁsh and livestock
[214]. Alterations in the composition of species of freshwater habitats, with consequent
impacts on estuarine and coastal ﬁsheries, are likely to occur due to multiple factors, including
saltwater intrusion as a result of sea-level rise, decreases in river ﬂows, and increased drought
frequency [215, 216].
6. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change poses a new threat to adaptation policies, even though human being are
known to adapt and survive and develop methodologies to overcome many water-related
problems. The major problem of adaptation to climate change might be related to the multiple
dimensions involved, which include [217], for example, various sectors (water resources,
agriculture, industrial); the spatial scale (local, regional, national); type of action (physical,
technological, investment, regulatory, market); and climatic zones (dryland, ﬂoodplains,
mountains, and arctic regions). The major focus on climate adaptation has emerged since
the third assessment report of IPCC highlighted several strategies, including adaptations to
observed climate changes, planned adaptations to climate change in infrastructure design and
coastal zone management, the variable nature of vulnerability, and adaptive capacity [218].
Climate Change and Its Impact on Water Resources
551

For several decades measures have been in place to reduce climate impacts by understanding
their variability on decadal, annual, and seasonal scales so as to develop climate forecasting
methods, risk analysis based on disasters, and crop and livelihood diversiﬁcation.
Various types of adaptations have been implemented around the world [217], and what
follows are some examples based on water-related sectors:
1.
Drought: enhancing the use of traditional rainwater harvesting and water-conserving techniques,
building of shelter belts and windbreaks to improve the resilience of rangelands and setting up of
revolving credit funds (e.g., for Sudan, Africa) [219]; inclusion of drought-resistant plants,
adjustment of planting dates and crop variety, accumulation of commodity stocks as economic
reserves, creation of local ﬁnancial pools (for Mexico and Argentina) [220]; creating employment
program options following drought in national government programs and assistance to small
subsistence farmers to increase crop production (e.g., in Botswana; [221]).
2.
Sea-level rise: acquisition of land with a view to climate change to acquire coastal lands damaged/
prone to damage by storms or buffering other lands (e.g., New Jersey Coastal Blue Acres land
acquisition program in the USA) [222]. Installation of hard structures in areas vulnerable to coastal
erosion and adoption of a national climate change action plan integrating climate change concerns
into national policies (e.g., in Egypt) [223]. Introduction of participatory risk assessment, capacity
building for shoreline defense system design, construction of cyclone-resistant housing units, and
review of building codes (e.g., in Philippines) [224]. Adoption of Flooding Defense Act and
Coastal Defense Policy as precautionary measures allowing for the incorporation of emerging
trends in climate and building of a storm surge barrier taking a 50-cm sea-level rise into account
(e.g., in the Netherlands) [225].
6.1. Assessment of Adaptation Costs and Beneﬁts
A few studies have investigated adaptation costs and beneﬁts in the context of climate
change [217] and some of the studies these issues as they pertain to Bangladesh [226], Fiji and
Kiribati [227], and Canada [228]. Based on individual issues, some studies address sea-level
rise [229], agriculture [129], and water resource management [230].
The greatest number of studies have been carried out for costs and beneﬁts related to
sea-level rise. Some of the important ﬁndings are as follows: (a) almost 100 % of coastal cities
and harbors in the countries that make up the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) should be protected, while the optimal protection for beaches and open
coasts would vary between 50 and 80 % [231]; (b) the total cost of sea-level rise could be
reduced by around 20–50 % for the US coastline if real estate market prices adjusted
efﬁciently as land became submerged [232]; (c) based on the IPCC SRES [166] the A1FI,
A2, B1, and B2 scenarios, with the exception of certain Paciﬁc Small Island States, coastal
protection investments comprise a very small percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for
the 15 most-affected countries by 2080 [217]; (d) based on a global-scale assessment,
uncertainties surrounding endowment values could lead to a 17 % difference in coastal
protection, a 36 % difference in the amount of land protected, and a 36 % difference in the
direct cost globally [233].
Adaptation studies for the agricultural sector may be based on increases in yield or on the
welfare of people at risk of hunger, which can be considered at the farm level or on the level of
552
V.P. Singh et al.

international trade [234, 235]. For many countries located in tropical regions, low-cost
adaptation measures, such as modifying crop mixes and changing planting dates, will likely
be insufﬁcient to offset the signiﬁcant damages that will result from climate change
[235, 236]. In another study, the beneﬁts to the American economy from adaptation
measures increased from US$3.29 billion (2000 values) to US$4.70 billion (2000 values)
[234, 237, 238]. Adaptation measures could reduce the variability in welfare by up to 84 % in
the case of Mali [235].
Only a few studies have investigated adaptation costs and beneﬁts in water resource
management; for example, the reliability of the water supply in the Boston metropolitan area
under climate change scenarios is estimated to be 93 % by 2100 on account of the expected
growth in water demand [230]. The costs of adaptation to climate change for storm water
management by water utilities in Canada, where the potential adaptation strategies include
building new treatment plants, improving the efﬁciency of existing plants, or increasing
retention tanks, were considered, and the results indicated that the adaptation costs for
Canadian cities could be as high as Canadian $9,400 million for a city like Toronto if
extreme events are considered [228]. The other major impact of climate change includes the
increase in energy demand due to increases in temperature. In one study, the global energy
costs related to heating and cooling would increase by US$2 billion to US$10 billion (1990
values) for a 2 C increase in temperature by 2100 and by US$51 billion to US$89 billion
(1990 values) for a 3.5 C increase [239]. The other major impact is sea-level rise, whose
associated global protection costs have been estimated at US$1,055 billion for a 1-m
sea-level rise [240].
6.2. Limitations in Adaptation to Climate Change
To overcome the impact of climate change, systems need to adapt or respond successfully
to climate variability and changes; therefore, the presence of an adaptive capacity has been
shown to be a necessary condition for the design and implementation of effective adaptation
strategies. Many factors that act as a limitation on adaptation to climate change [217] are
discussed in the following sections.
6.2.1. Threshold Level of Ecosystem
Several investigations lead to ﬁndings that the resilience of coupled socioecological
systems to climate change will depend on the rate and magnitude of climate change, and
when climate change persists beyond critical thresholds, some systems may not be able to
adapt to changing climate conditions without radically altering their functional state and
integrity [217]. The physical environment can change dramatically in response to changing
climatic patterns, for example, the resilience of kelp forest ecosystems, coral reefs,
rangelands, and lakes affected both by climate change and other pollutants beyond a
certain threshold level [241, 242]. Persistent below-average rainfall and recurrent droughts
in the late twentieth century in the Sudano-Sahel region of Africa, have led to constricted
physical and ecological limits by contributing to land degradation, diminished livelihood
opportunities, food insecurity, and internal displacement of people [243]. Loss of sea ice
Climate Change and Its Impact on Water Resources
553

in Arctic sea threatens the survival of polar bears [244]. Climate change also signiﬁcantly
affects the economy due to its impact on ecosystems, such as ﬁsheries and agricultural
systems. This leads to signiﬁcant challenges with respect to resource management
from ecosystem shifts, but such challenges are often outside the experience of
institutions [245].
6.2.2. Technological Limits
Adapting to new technologies serves as a potential means of adapting to climate variability
and changes, and the transfer of appropriate technologies to developing countries forms an
important component of the UNFCCC [246]. There are also potential limits to technology as
an adaptation response to climate change [217]; for example, technology is developed and
applied in a social context, and decision making under uncertainty may inhibit adaptation to
climate change [247], and although some adaptations may be technologically possible, they
may not be economically feasible or culturally desirable [248]. New technology is unlikely to
be equally transferable to all contexts and to all groups or individuals, regardless of the extent
of country-to-country technology transfer [249], and adaptations that are effective in one
location may be ineffective in other places.
6.2.3. Financial Barriers
The estimated total costs for the implementation of adaptation measures are quite high, and
they face a number of ﬁnancial barriers; for example, preliminary estimates are that climate
prooﬁng development could be as high as US$10 billion to US$40 billion/year [250]. Simi-
larly, institutions at the local level and individuals can be similarly constrained by the lack of
adequate ﬁnancial resources; for example, farmers often cite the lack of adequate ﬁnancial
resources as an important factor that constrains the use of adaptation measures, such as
irrigation systems, improved or new crop varieties, and diversiﬁcation of farm operations
[251]. The lack of resources is likely to reduce the ability of low-income groups to afford
proposed adaptation mechanisms by raising the actuarial uncertainty in catastrophe risk
assessment, placing upward pricing pressure on insurance premiums and possibly leading to
reductions in risk coverage [252].
6.2.4. Informational and Cognitive Barriers
Risks associated with climate change are context speciﬁc [253], and adaptation responses
to climate change can be limited by human cognition [254]. Therefore, knowledge of the
factors responsible and their impacts and possible solutions do not necessarily lead to
adaptation. Perceptions of climate change risks vary, and the psychological dimensions of
evaluating long-term risk focus on changes in relation to climate change mitigation policies.
Some studies have explored the behavioral foundations of adaptive responses [217, 255].
For example, thresholds of rapid climate change may induce different individual responses
inﬂuenced by trust in others, resulting in adaptive and nonadaptive behaviors [256]. In another
study [255] aimed at human cognition and adaptive capacity in populations living in
554
V.P. Singh et al.

ﬂood-prone areas in Germany and farmers struggling with drought in Zimbabwe, the authors
note that divergence between perceived and actual adaptive capacity is a real barrier to
adaptive actions.
6.2.5. Social and Cultural Barriers
There are social and cultural limits to climate change adaptation where people and groups
experience, interpret, and respond to impacts [217]. Differences in understanding and prior-
itizing climate change issues across different social and cultural groups can limit adaptive
responses [256]. In addition, societies are responsible for changes to their environments, and
they alter their own vulnerability to climate ﬂuctuations, as illustrated, for example, by the
development of the Colorado River Basin in the face of environmental uncertainty [257].
Several case studies have revealed that there exists a diversity of traditional practices for
ecosystem management under environmental uncertainty based on social regulation, mech-
anisms for cultural internalization of traditional practices, and the development of appropriate
worldviews and cultural values [258].
7. CONCLUSIONS
Various observations, including increases in global average air and ocean temperatures and
the melting of snow and ice, conﬁrm that the climatic system is getting warmer. Impacts of
this warming have been observed on global and local scales in different water resource
sectors. The following conclusions are drawn from this study:
1.
Overall changes in large-scale hydrologic cycles are observed based on spatiotemporal scales. The
noted observations include increased precipitation in high northern latitudes since the 1970s,
increased frequency in heavy precipitation events, runoff patterns, reductions in snow cover,
and shifts in the amplitude and timing of glacial runoff.
2.
Based on global climate models, precipitation is likely to increase in high latitudes and decrease in
lower mid-latitude regions during the twenty-ﬁrst century. The risks of ﬂooding and drought are
likely to increase in many parts due to increases in precipitation intensity and variability. Water
availability and annual river runoff are likely to increase at high latitudes by the middle of the
twenty-ﬁrst century, whereas many arid and semiarid areas are projected to suffer a decrease in
water resources.
3.
The basic food sector (i.e., availability, stability, and access), which will likely be affected by
changes in the quantity and quality of water resources, will be vulnerable in the arid and semiarid
tropics and Asian and African mega deltas.
4.
Water quality, which will likely be affected by climate change due to higher water temperatures,
precipitation extremes, ﬂood and drought events, and pollution, will decrease because of imbal-
ances in several factors, including sediments, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, pathogens,
pesticides, salt, and thermal pollution.
5.
The quantity and quality of water resources will have a severe impact on ecosystems and human
health, which will be further impacted by sea-level rise that will extend areas of salinization of
groundwater and estuaries, resulting in a decrease in freshwater availability for humans and
ecosystems in coastal areas.
Climate Change and Its Impact on Water Resources
555

6.
Climate change can aggravate freshwater systems, which are already stressed due to increases in
population and rising water demand in various sectors, changing economic activity, alterations in
land use, and urbanization. The global population rise will have repercussion on the global scale,
whereas demand in various affected sectors will impact regional water demand.
7.
To ensure proper management of water resources, various strategies should be adopted based on
water availability and water demand depending on the different needs at local, regional, and
continental levels. Some of the strategies include water conservation, improved water use efﬁ-
ciency by recycling water, development of water markets and implementation of virtual water
trade, and improved storage facilities to act as lifelines during drought periods. There is also a need
to improve decision making based on the efﬁcient modeling of climate change related to the
hydrologic cycle through a better understanding of the uncertainties likely to exacerbate the
impacts of climate change.

1. INTRODUCTION
Land application of biosolids is deﬁned as the spreading, spraying, injection, or incorpo-
ration of liquid, semiliquid, or solid organic by-product of the wastewater treatment process,
onto or below the surface of the land to take advantage of the nutrient-supplying and soil
property-enhancing qualities of the residuals. These organic by-products are land-applied to
improve the structure of the soil and to supply nutrients to crops and other vegetation grown in
the soil. These by-products are commonly applied to agricultural land (including pasture and
range land), forests, reclamation sites, and, if properly treated, public contact sites (e.g., parks,
turf farms, highway median strips, golf courses), lawns, and home gardens.
Biosolids contain signiﬁcant concentrations of essential plant nutrients. The availability of
these nutrients to vegetation at an application site depends on these materials’ composition,
processing, handling and method of application, as well as a number of soil and climatic
factors. Under most situations, the amount of these materials that can be applied to the soil is
based on satisfying a nutrient requirement of the vegetation. This quantity is called the
“agronomic” rate of application.
This chapter illustrates how nutrient management is achieved using the approach of the US
Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and how the agronomic rate of application on
agricultural land is determined. Although the emphasis of this chapter is placed on application
of biosolids on agricultural land, the same method of analysis can also be applied to livestock
manure and other organic by-products.
1.1. Biosolids
Sewage sludge means any solid, semisolid, or liquid residue removed during the treatment
of municipal wastewater or domestic sewage. Sewage sludge includes, but is not limited to,
solids removed during primary, secondary, or advanced wastewater treatment; scum; septage;
portable toilet pumpings; and sewage sludge products. Sewage sludge does not include grit or
screenings or ash generated during the incineration of sewage sludge. Septage means the
liquid and solid material pumped from a septic tank, cesspool, or similar domestic sewage
treatment system, or holding tank when the system is cleaned or maintained. Biosolids are
solid, semisolid or liquid materials, resulting from biological treatment of domestic sewage,
that have been sufﬁciently processed to permit these materials to be safely land-applied. The
term of biosolids was introduced by the wastewater treatment industry in the early 1990s and
has been recently adopted by the US EPA to distinguish high-quality treated sewage sludge
from raw sewage sludge and from sewage sludge containing large amounts of pollutants.
Although the “biosolids” term does not evoke the same negative connotation as does “sewage
sludge,” the use of the term is appropriate when it makes the distinction described above.
1.2. Biosolids Production and Pretreatment Before Land Application
Biosolids are produced primarily through biological treatment of domestic wastewater.
Biosolids comprise the solids that are removed from the wastewater and further processed
before the treated water is released into streams or rivers.
574
L.K. Wang et al.

Thickening, digestion, stabilization, conditioning, dewatering, composting, and heat dry-
ing processes are often employed additionally to improve the biosolids handling characteris-
tics, increase the economic viability of land application, and reduce the potential for public
health, environmental, and nuisance problems associated with land application practices.
These processes control disease-causing organisms and reduce characteristics that might
attract rodents, ﬂies, mosquitoes, or other organisms capable of transporting infectious
disease. Table 12.1 shows how various biosolids pretreatment processes will affect the
suitability of biosolids to be applied on land especially for agricultural use.
1.3. Biosolids Characteristics
The suitability of biosolids for land application can be determined by biological, chemical,
and physical analyses. Biosolids’ composition depends on wastewater constituents and
treatment processes. The resulting properties will determine application method and rate
and the degree of regulatory control required. Several of the more important properties of
biosolids are discussed below.
Total solids (TS) include suspended and dissolved solids and are usually expressed as the
concentration present in biosolids. TS depend on the type of wastewater process and bio-
solids’ treatment prior to land application. Typical solids contents of various biosolids are:
liquid (2–12 %), dewatered (12–30 %), and dried or composted (50 %). Volatile solids
(VS) provide an estimate of the readily decomposable organic matter in biosolids and are
usually expressed as a percentage of total solids. VS are an important determinant of potential
odor problems at land application sites. A number of biosolids treatment processes, including
anaerobic digestion, aerobic digestion, and composting, can be used to reduce VS content and,
thus, the potential for odor.
The degree of acidity or alkalinity of a substance is expressed as pH. The pH of biosolids is
often raised with alkaline materials to reduce pathogen content and attraction of disease-
spreading organisms (vectors). High pH (greater than 11) kills virtually all pathogens and
reduces the solubility, biological availability, and mobility of most metals. Lime also
increases the gaseous loss (volatilization) of the ammonia form of nitrogen (ammonia-N),
thus reducing the N-fertilizer value of biosolids.
Pathogens are disease-causing microorganisms that include bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and
parasitic worms. Pathogens can present a public health hazard if they are transferred to food
crops grown on land to which biosolids are applied; contained in runoff to surface waters from
land application sites; or transported away from the site by vectors such as insects, rodents,
and birds. For this reason, federal and state regulations specify pathogen and vector attraction
reduction requirements that must be met by biosolids applied to land. A list of pathogens that
can be found in untreated sewage sludge and the diseases or symptoms that they can cause
have been published [1–4].
Nutrients are elements required for plant growth that provide biosolids with most of
their economic value. These include nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium
(Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), sulfur (S), boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese
(Mn), molybdenum (Mo), and zinc (Zn). Concentrations in biosolids can vary signiﬁcantly

(see Table 12.2); thus, the actual material being considered for land application should
be analyzed.
Trace elements are found in low concentrations in biosolids. The trace elements of interest
in biosolids are those commonly referred to as “heavy metals.” Some of these trace elements
(e.g., copper, molybdenum, and zinc) are nutrients needed for plant growth in low concen-
trations, but all of these elements can be toxic to humans, animals, or plants at high
concentrations. Possible hazards associated with a buildup of trace elements in the soil
include their potential to cause phytotoxicity (i.e., injury to plants) or to increase the
concentration of potentially hazardous substances in the food chain. Federal and state
regulations have established standards for the following nine trace elements: arsenic (As),
cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni),
selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn).
Organic chemicals are complex compounds that include man-made chemicals from indus-
trial wastes, household products, and pesticides. Many of these compounds are toxic or
carcinogenic to organisms exposed to critical concentrations over certain periods of
time, but most are found at such low concentrations in biosolids that do not pose signiﬁcant
human health or environmental threats. Although no organic pollutants are included in
the current US federal biosolids regulations, further assessment of speciﬁc organic com-
pounds is continuing [6–8].
1.4. Agricultural Land Application for Beneﬁcial Use
As an alternative to disposal by landﬁlling or incineration, land application seeks to
beneﬁcially recycle the soil property-enhancing constituents in biosolids, which are ulti-
mately derived from crops grown on agricultural land. The US EPA [9] estimates that more
than seven million dry metric tons (DMTs) of sewage sludge are produced annually.
According to US EPA [9], over half the sludge produced (54 %) is “used beneﬁcially,” that
is, applied on agricultural, horticultural, forest, and reclamation land throughout the country.
Biosolids are about 50 % mineral and 50 % organic matter. The mineral matter includes
plant nutrients, and organic matter is a source of slow-release nutrients and soil conditioners.
Farmers can beneﬁt from biosolids application by reducing fertilizer costs. The main fertilizer
beneﬁts are through the supply of nitrogen, phosphorus, and lime (where lime-stabilized

biosolids are applied). Biosolids also ensure against unforeseen nutrient shortages by supply-
ing essential plant nutrients that are rarely purchased by farmers because crop responses to
their application are unpredictable. These include elements such as sulfur, manganese, zinc,
copper, iron, molybdenum, and boron. Land application replenishes valuable organic matter,
which occurs in less than optimum amounts in most soils. The addition of organic matter can
improve soil tilth, the physical condition of soil as related to its ease of tillage, ﬁtness as a
seedbed, and its impedance to seedling emergence and root penetration. Other beneﬁts
imparted by the addition of organic matter to soil include:
(a)
Increases water inﬁltration into the soil and soil moisture-holding capacity
(b)
Reduces soil compaction
(c)
Increases the ability of the soil to retain and provide nutrients
(d)
Reduces soil acidiﬁcation
(e)
Provides an energy source (carbon) for beneﬁcial microorganisms
(f)
Can contribute to soil carbon sequestration
The addition of organic matter in biosolids to a ﬁne-textured clay soil can help make the soil
more friable and can increase the amount of pore space available for root growth and entry of
water and air into the soil. In coarse-textured sandy soils, organic residues in biosolids can
increase the water-holding capacity of the soil and provide chemical sites for nutrient
exchange and adsorption.
Land application is usually less expensive than alternative methods of disposal. Conse-
quently, wastewater treatment facilities and the public they serve beneﬁt through cost savings.
The recycling of nutrients and organic matter can be attractive to citizens concerned with
environmental protection and resource conservation.
Land application of biosolids involves some risks, which are addressed through federal and
state regulatory programs. Pollutants and pathogens are added to soil with organic matter and
nutrients. Human and animal health, soil quality, plant growth, and water quality could be
adversely affected if land application is not conducted in an agronomically and environmen-
tally sound manner. In addition, nitrogen and phosphorus in biosolids, as in any fertilizer
source, can contaminate ground and surface water if the material is overapplied or improperly
applied. There are risks and beneﬁts to each method of biosolids disposal and reuse.
1.5. US Federal and State Regulations
The US EPA has developed the regulations and the standards for the use or disposal of
sewage sludge (Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations [CFR], Part 503). The Part
503 Rule establishes minimum requirements when biosolids are applied to land to condition
the soil or fertilize crops or other vegetation grown in the soil. The Clean Water Act
(http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/cwa.html) required that this regulation protect public
health and the environment from any reasonably anticipated adverse effects of pollutants
and pathogens in biosolids. Determination of biosolids quality is based on trace element
(pollutant) concentrations and pathogen and vector attraction reduction. Federal regulations
require that state regulations be at least as stringent as the Part 503 Rule [10–12]. Many state
regulations prohibit land application of low-quality sewage sludge and encourage the
578

application of biosolids that are of sufﬁcient quality that they will not adversely affect human
health or the environment [9, 13].
1.5.1. Trace Element Limits
The Part 503 Rule prohibits land application of sewage sludge that exceeds the ceiling
concentration limits (see Table 12.3) for nine trace elements, including arsenic, cadmium,
copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and zinc. Sewage sludge exceeding the
ceiling concentration limit for even one of the regulated pollutants is not classiﬁed as
biosolids and, hence, cannot be land-applied.
Pollutant concentration limits are the most stringent pollutant limits included in Part 503 for
land application. Biosolids meeting pollutant concentration limits are subject to fewer
requirements than biosolids meeting ceiling concentration limits. Results of the US EPA’s
1990 National Sewage Sludge Survey (NSSS) [14] demonstrated that the mean concentrations
of the nine regulated pollutants are considerably lower than the most stringent Part 503 pol-
lutant limits (Table 12.3).

The cumulative pollutant loading rate (Table 12.3) is the total amount of a pollutant that can
be applied to a site in its lifetime by all bulk biosolids applications meeting ceiling concen-
tration limits. No additional biosolids meeting ceiling concentration limits can be applied to a
site after the maximum cumulative pollutant loading rate is reached at that site for any one of
the nine regulated trace elements. Only biosolids that meet the more stringent pollutant
concentration limits may be applied to a site once a cumulative pollutant loading rate is
reached at that site.
General Pretreatment Regulations [40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 403] were
developed to control the introduction of nondomestic wastes to publicly owned treatment
works (POTWs). The purpose of the program is to protect POTWs from pollutant pass
through and interference, to protect receiving waters, and to improve opportunities to recycle
biosolids. The program relies on national categorical standards, prohibited discharge stan-
dards, and local limits. Control authorities are required to develop and enforce local limits as
mandated by 40 CFR 403.5 and 40 CFR 403.8. In December 1987, the US Environmental
Protection Agency (US EPA) published a technical document entitled Guidance Manual on
the Development and Implementation of Local Discharge Limitations (http://www.epa.gov/
npdes/pubs/owm0275.pdf). That guidance addressed the key elements in developing local
limits such as identifying all industrial users, determining the character and volume of
pollutants in industrial user discharges, collecting data for local limits development, identi-
fying pollutants of concern, calculating removal efﬁciencies, determining the allowable
headworks loading, and implementing appropriate local limits to ensure that the maximum
allowable headworks loadings are not exceeded. Supplements to the 1987 manual intended to
build
on
the
initial
information
have
been
published
(http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/
pretreatment/pstandards.cfm). An improvement in the quality of biosolids over the years
has largely been due to pretreatment and pollution prevention programs [15]. Such improve-
ments in biosolids quality can be seen in the reduction in concentrations of metals measured in
biosolids from the National Sewage Sludge Survey and a survey of 12 Pennsylvania POTWs
between 1993 and 1997 (Table 12.3).
1.5.2. Organic Chemicals
Part 503 does not regulate organic chemicals in biosolids because the chemicals of
potential concern have been banned or restricted for use in the USA, are no longer
manufactured in the USA, are present at low concentrations based on data from US EPA’s
1990 NSSS [14], or because the limit for an organic pollutant identiﬁed in the Part 503 risk
assessment is not expected to be exceeded in biosolids that are land-applied [16]. Restrictions
will be imposed for agricultural use if testing of certain toxic organic compounds veriﬁes that
biosolids contain levels that could cause harm to human health or the environment.
1.5.3. Pathogen Reduction
The US federal and state regulations require the reduction of potential disease-causing
microorganisms, called pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, and parasitic worms) and vector
(e.g., rodents, birds, insects that can transport pathogens away from the land application site)
580

attraction properties. Biosolids intended for land application are normally treated by chemical
or biological processes that greatly reduce the number of pathogens and odor potential in
sewage sludge. Two levels of pathogen reduction, Class A and Class B, are speciﬁed in the
regulations [10].
The goal of Class A requirements is to reduce the pathogens (including Salmonella sp.,
bacteria, enteric viruses, and viable helminth ova) to below detectable levels. Class A
biosolids can be land-applied without any pathogen-related site restrictions. Processes to
further reduce pathogens (PFRP) treatment, such as those involving high temperature, high
pH with alkaline addition, drying, and composting, or their equivalent are most commonly
used to demonstrate that biosolids meet Class A requirements.
The goal of Class B requirements is to ensure that pathogens have been reduced to levels
that are unlikely to cause a threat to public health and the environment under speciﬁed use
conditions. Processes to signiﬁcantly reduce pathogens (PSRP), such as digestion, drying,
heating, and high pH, or their equivalent are most commonly used to demonstrate that
biosolids meet Class B requirements. Because Class B biosolids contain some pathogens,
certain site restrictions are required. These are imposed to minimize the potential for human
and animal contact with the biosolids until environmental factors (temperature, moisture,
light, microbial competition) reduce the pathogens to below detectable levels. As an example
of waiting periods after land application, Table 12.4 summarizes the Class B biosolids
application land use restrictions imposed by the Virginia Department of Environmental
Quality [13]. The site restriction requirements in combination with Class B treatment are
expected to provide a level of protection equivalent to Class A treatment. All biosolids that are
land-applied must, at a minimum, meet Class B pathogen reduction standards [10].

1.5.4. Vector Attraction Reduction
The objective of vector attraction reduction is to prevent disease vectors such as rodents,
birds, and insects from transporting pathogens away from the land application site. There are
ten options available to demonstrate that land-applied biosolids meet vector attraction reduc-
tion requirements. These options fall into either of the following two general approaches:
(a) reducing the attractiveness of the biosolids to vectors with speciﬁed organic matter
decomposition processes (e.g., digestion, alkaline addition) and (b) preventing vectors from
coming into contact with the biosolids (e.g., biosolids injection or incorporation below the soil
surface within speciﬁed time periods).
1.5.5. Categories of Biosolids Quality
The quality of biosolids (i.e., pollutant concentrations, pathogen levels, and vector attrac-
tion reduction control) determines which land application requirements must be met. There
are three categories of biosolids quality that are discussed below and described in Table 12.5.
Biosolids that meet the Part 503 PCLs, Class A pathogen reduction, and a vector attraction
reduction option that reduces organic matter are classiﬁed as Exceptional Quality, or EQ,
biosolids. In general, EQ biosolids can be applied as freely as any other fertilizer or soil
amendment to any type of land.
Pollutant concentration (PC) biosolids meet the same low pollutant limits (PCLs) as EQ bio-
solids,butPCbiosolidsusuallymeetClassBratherthanClassApathogenreductionrequirements.
Biosolids meeting Class A pathogen reduction requirements plus one of the practices designed to
prevent vectors from coming into contact with biosolids also are PC biosolids.
Cumulative pollutant loading rate (CPLR) biosolids, unlike EQ or PC biosolids, require
tracking of the cumulative metal loadings to ensure adequate protection of public health and
the environment. Additional land application terminologies can be found from the “Glossary”
section of this chapter and the literature.
1.5.6. Nutrients
The US federal regulations specify that biosolids may only be applied to agricultural land at
or less than the rate required to supply the nutrient (primarily N, P) needs of the crops to be
grown. This “agronomic rate” was initially “designed: (a) to provide the amount of N needed
by the food crop, feed crop, ﬁber crop, or vegetation grown on the land; and (b) to minimize the
amount of N in the biosolids that passes below the root zone of the crop or vegetation grown on
the land to the ground water (40 CFR 503.11 (B)).” Agronomic rate may also be based on
crop phosphorus (P) needs if it is determined that excessive soil P poses a threat to water
quality. The application rate of lime-stabilized biosolids can further be limited by soil pH.
1.5.7. Site Suitability and Location
Site physical characteristics that inﬂuence the land application management practices
include topography; soil permeability, inﬁltration, and drainage patterns; depth to groundwa-
ter; and proximity to surface water. Federal, state, and local regulations, ordinances, or

guidelines place limits on land application based on these physical characteristics. Potentially
unsuitable areas for biosolids application include (a) areas bordered by ponds, lakes, rivers,
and streams without appropriate buffer areas; (b) wetlands and marshes; (c) steep areas with
sharp relief; (d) undesirable geology (fractured bedrock) if not covered by a sufﬁciently thick
layer of soil; (e) undesirable soil conditions (rocky, shallow); (f) areas of historical or
archeological signiﬁcance; and (g) other environmentally sensitive areas, such as ﬂoodplains.
Many states have enacted regulations establishing site-speciﬁc management practice stan-
dards more demanding than the Part 503 Rule. Such regulations deﬁne standards of practice to
ensure that biosolids use does not compromise the public health or the environment. An example
of regulations promulgated by a state that are more stringent than the federal regulations is the
Virginia Biosolids Use Regulations [17], which specify minimum distances to land application
areas from occupied dwellings, water supply wells or springs, property lines, perennial streams
and other surface waters, intermittent streams/drainage ditches, improved roadways, rock out-
crops and sinkholes, and agricultural drainage ditches (see Table 12.6).
2. AGRICULTURAL LAND APPLICATION
2.1. Land Application Process
The land application operation and maintenance information in this chapter applies to
controlled application of biosolids to cropland. The most appropriate application method for
agricultural land depends on the chemical and physical characteristics of the biosolids and the
soil, as well as the types of crops grown. Biosolids are generally land-applied using one of the
following methods: (a) sprayed or spread on the soil surface and left on the surface for

pastures, range, and forest land; (b) incorporated into the soil after being surface-applied; or
(c) injected directly below the surface for producing row crops or other vegetation. Biosolids
application methods such as incorporation and injection can be used to meet Part 503 vector
attraction reduction requirements. Alternatively, both liquid and dewatered biosolids may be
applied to land without subsequent soil incorporation. Although there are many ﬁeld varia-
tions to the land application operation, certain process requirements, limitations, design
criteria, operating procedures, and monitoring methods must be established to optimize the
process performance [1, 10–12, 17–29].
The most common form of biosolids applied to agricultural land is that which has undergone
conditioning and dewatering. Dewatering typically increases the solids content of liquid
biosolids from less than 5 % to 25–30 %, thus precluding the need to transport considerable
quantities of water in liquid biosolids to the application site. Dewatered biosolids can be
applied to cropland by equipment similar to that used for applying limestone, animal manures,
or commercial fertilizer. Typically, dewatered biosolids will be surface-applied and incorpo-
rated by chisel plowing, disking, or another form of tillage. Incorporation is not used when
applying dewatered biosolids to forages or to the increasing amount of no-till land.
Liquid biosolids can be applied by surface spreading or subsurface injection. Surface
methods include spreading by tractor-drawn tank wagons, special applicator vehicles
equipped with ﬂotation tires, or irrigation systems. Surface application with incorporation is
normally limited to soils with less than a 7 % slope. Biosolids are commonly incorporated by
chisel plowing or disking after the liquid has been applied to the soil surface and allowed to
partially dry, unless minimum or no-till systems are being used.
Spray irrigation systems generally should not be used to apply biosolids to forages or row
crops during the growing season, although a light application to the stubble of a forage crop
following a harvest is acceptable. The adherence of biosolids to plant vegetation can have a
detrimental effect on crop yields by reducing photosynthesis. In addition, spray irrigation
increases the potential for odor problems and reduces the aesthetics at the application site.
Liquid biosolids can also be injected below the soil surface using tractor-drawn tank wagons
with injection shanks and tank trucks ﬁtted with ﬂotation tires and injection shanks. Both types
of equipment minimize odor problems and reduce ammonia volatilization by immediate
mixing of soil and biosolids. Injection can be used either before planting or after harvesting
crops, but it is likely to be unacceptable for forages and sod production. Some injection shanks
can damage the sod or forage stand and leave deep injection furrows in the ﬁeld. Subsurface
injection will minimize runoff from all soils and can be used on slopes up to 15 %. Injection
should be made perpendicular to slopes to avoid having liquid biosolids run downhill along
injection slits and pond at the bottom of the slopes. As with surface application, drier soil will
be able to absorb more liquid, thereby minimizing downslope movement. Despite the advan-
tages with regard to odor and maintaining soil vegetative cover with injecting liquid biosolids,
such practice is much less common than surface application of dewatered biosolids.
Typical sludge injector trucks are shown in Fig. 12.1. Liquid application of biosolids from a
sludge application truck is shown in Fig. 12.2. Figure 12.3 shows the application of liquid
biosolids to a forest land.

2.2. Agricultural Land Application Concepts and Terminologies
To understand when and where to apply biosolids and/or manure on agricultural land,
certain common terms must be understood [22].
The farm ﬁeld is the basic management unit used for all farm nutrient management, as
deﬁned as “the fundamental unit used for cropping agricultural products.” An area of
cropland that has been subdivided into several strips is not a single ﬁeld. Rather, each strip
represents an individual ﬁeld unit. Individual ﬁelds that are managed in the same manner, with
the similar yield goals, are called a crop group.

L.K. Wang et al.

The cycle of crop planting and harvesting periods, not the calendar year, dictates the
timing of biosolids land application activities. Winter wheat and perennial forage grasses are
examples of crops that may be established and harvested in different calendar years. In many
regions, biosolids are commonly applied in the fall or early winter, in anticipation of a crop
that will be planted the following spring. Crop nutrient management practices are linked to
crop nutrient uptake (crop growth) and nutrient removal at harvest time. Agricultural land
application programs must be coordinated with the cropping cycle.
The basic time management unit is often called the crop year or planting season. The
crop year is deﬁned as the year in which a crop receiving the biosolids treatment is
harvested. For example, fall applications of biosolids in 2012 intended to provide nutrients
for a crop to be harvested in 2013 are earmarked for crop year 2013. Likewise, biosolids
applied immediately prior to planting winter wheat in October 2012 should be identiﬁed as
fertilizer intended for crop year 2013 because the wheat will be harvested in the summer of
2013. Similarly, if instead of wheat, the ﬁeld is planted with corn in the spring of 2013 that
will be harvested in the fall of 2013, applications of biosolids made in the fall of 2012 should
be credited to crop year 2013. Typically, biosolids applied January through June would be
intended for a crop harvested in the same calendar year. Biosolids applied in the last
6 months of the calendar year usually fertilize crops harvested the next calendar year.
This generalization does not always hold true. For example, biosolids may be applied in
July on a grass forage crop or in preparation for a buckwheat crop that will be harvested
before winter. Other common exceptions are likely in hot, humid sections of the USA
[22]. The ﬁrst step in computing the agronomic rate is to establish the amount of nitrogen
needed for a desired crop yield. The crop yield consists of crop removal rates and nutrient

recommendations for proposed crops. This is also a good time to evaluate other primary
nutrient crop removal amounts (phosphate and potash), though these elements are not
normally regulated at the state or federal level.
Realistic yield goals can be obtained from agronomy guidelines (or equivalent) published
by state land-grant universities, cooperative extension, or state nutrient management planning
certifying agencies. Yield goals are commonly based on soil productivity categorization of
soils that take into account soil-moisture holding capacity, soil depth, drainage characteristics,
and other soil features that affect plant-available water. Table 12.7 demonstrates how Virginia
soils having diverse properties can inﬂuence crop yields differently. Biosolids and fertilizer
nutrients recommended for such soils are based on residual soil nutrients as determined by
soil
testing
(http://www.mawaterquality.org/capacity_building/mid-atlantic%20nutrient%
20management%20handbook/chapter7.pdf) and crop nutrient uptake needs (http://www.
mawaterquality.org/capacity_building/mid-atlantic%20nutrient%20management%20handbook/
chapter4.pdf; tables 4.3a–c). Fertilizer recommendations, regardless of the nutrient source,
based on residual soil nutrients and supplemental crop needs have been published for Virginia
by the state’s nutrient management certifying agency—the Virginia Department of Conser-
vation and Recreation—at http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/documents/StandardsandCriteria.pdf.
Only a portion of the total nitrogen present in biosolids is available for plant uptake. This
plant-available nitrogen (PAN) is the actual amount of N in the biosolids that is available to
crops during a speciﬁed period. The biosolids application rate is a ﬁeld measurement
determined for the particular application equipment.
Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) is the summation of ammonium nitrogen (NH4

is found in negligible amounts in biosolids and is usually ignored in the calculation of N rates.
Crops directly utilize nitrogen in its inorganic forms, principally nitrate-N and ammonium-N.
Biosolids nitrate-N concentrations, however, are typically less than 0.05 %. This translates to
less than one pound per dry ton of biosolids. Hence, this fraction is usually insigniﬁcant and is
not included in most agronomic rate calculations. However, it is advisable to test the biosolids
nitrate-N content before eliminating this factor.
Most nitrogen exists in biosolids as organic-N, principally contained in proteins, nucleic
acids, amines, and other cellular material. These complex molecules must be broken apart
through biological degradation for nitrogen to become available to crops. The conversion of
organic-N to inorganic ammonium-N is called mineralization.
The mineralization rate depends on soil factors such as temperature, moisture, pH, and
availability of oxygen, as well as the inherent biodegradability of organic materials. Biosolids
that are digested undergo some mineralization before ever reaching the farm ﬁeld. Hence,
the method and degree of biosolids treatment prior to application inﬂuence the amount of
nitrogen easily released for plant uptake. Further microbial conversion of ammonium-N to
nitrate-N occurs under aerobic conditions and is termed nitriﬁcation. Nitriﬁcation occurs
rapidly in well-drained agricultural soils and results in a predominance of nitrate rather than
ammonium-N by early summer in most humid, temperate climatic regions of the USA.
Organic-N in biosolids becomes available to crops (i.e., mineralized) over a period of
several years. Because of the many inﬂuencing factors, we rely on estimates of mineraliza-
tion. The mineralization factors for Virginia (Table 12.8) illustrate how time after ﬁeld
application affects the amount of biosolids PAN. The amounts of mineral-N formed percent
organic-N is 6–7 lbs/dry ton for lime-stabilized or digested biosolids and 2 lbs/dry ton for
composted biosolids.
Ammonium-N in biosolids can be signiﬁcant, making up as much as half the initial PAN of
biosolids. The ammonium-N in biosolids can vary widely depending on treatment and
storage. Since ammonium-N is prone to volatilization (as ammonia gas, NH3), the application
method affects PAN. For instance, surface-applied and unincorporated biosolids are expected

to lose half of their ammonium-N. Conversely, direct subsurface injection or soil incorpora-
tion of biosolids within 24 h minimizes volatilization losses [22]. Table 12.9 presents the
factors used to calculate biosolids ammonium-N that does not volatize and, thus, can be
counted as plant available in Virginia. Additional terminologies for agricultural land appli-
cation process can be found in this chapter’s “Glossary and Land Application Terms” section.
3. PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL
LAND APPLICATION
3.1. Planning
Biosolids nutrient management controls should be planned for activities before, during, and
after land application, according to National Biosolids Partnership [22].
3.1.1. Planning Before Land Application
The following are the planning activities before land application of biosolids: (a) conﬁrm
that the biosolids meet all pollutant, pathogen reduction, and vector attraction reduction
requirements at the time proposed for application. Do not just rely on past history; a
responsible representative must personally review the data to assure that all is in order;
(b) conﬁrm the N, P, and K content of the biosolids. If the material has been stored for greater
than 6 weeks, nutrient content should be reevaluated; (c) review the farm nutrient manage-
ment plan for the crop(s) being planted in order to calculate the biosolids agronomic rate;
(d) access information on past biosolids applications in order to consider residual-N when
calculating the biosolids agronomic rate; (e) calculate the “target” biosolids agronomic rate
based on the nitrogen content of the biosolids, crop nitrogen need, and residual-N from past
biosolids applications; (f) discuss the proposed biosolids application with the farm operator to
conﬁrm that the recycling program is consistent with the farm operator’s intentions. Address
any last minute changes on the farm operator’s part; and (g) check that all regulatory
approvals, notices, etc. have been completed.

3.1.2. Planning During Land Application
The following are the planning activities during land application of biosolids: (a) check the
area applied versus the volume (or mass) of biosolids applied to conﬁrm that the actual
application rate is consistent with the target agronomic rate. This exercise should be
performed daily. In addition, (b) record the location (ﬁeld, portion of ﬁeld) where each load
of biosolids is applied, the current weather conditions, responsible parties involved, visits by
regulators, and any unusual observations or complaints by neighbors.
3.1.3. Planning After Land Application
The following are the planning activities after land application of biosolids: (a) assemble
and ﬁle all records documenting the application event, (b) submit any required regulatory
reports, (c) provide pertinent information to the farm operator, particularly the biosolids
nutrients applied, and (d) notify the farm operator (and speciﬁed regulatory ofﬁcials as
required) that land application activities have been completed.
3.2. Nutrient Management
3.2.1. Nutrient Management Goal
The goal of nutrient management is to develop environmentally responsible strategies for
ﬁeld application of agricultural fertilizers. A sound nutrient management plan (NMP) will
provide a site-speciﬁc strategy for supplying necessary nutrients for crop growth while at the
same time protecting local water quality. The Part 503 Rule limits land application of
biosolids-N to only the amount used by growing crops [22]. The practice of limiting biosolids
applications to supply only as much N as will be consumed by the crop and removed during
harvest, “termed agronomic rate,” is not a new concept. Most state biosolids regulations have
recognized this practice for decades.
Biosolids are not balanced fertilizers. The primary nutrients, N, P, and potassium (K),
required to achieve target crop yields are not supplied by biosolids in the proportions needed
by crops. For example, when biosolids are applied to meet crop-N needs, P is typically
overapplied and K is often under-applied. The degree to which P and K are mismatched to
crop needs depends on the particular biosolids, soil residual P and K concentrations, and the
crop. Experience has shown that repeat applications of nutrients to the same farm ﬁeld may
eventually result in elevated levels of soil test P. When elevated soil test P is found, terms
such as high or excessive are used in soil test reports to indicate that further addition of
phosphate fertilizer will not increase crop yields. Such interpretations of soil fertility tests are
based on agronomic/economic considerations, not on potential environmental risk posed by
high soil test P levels. Current standard practice bases biosolids application on plant-
available nitrogen (PAN) content. The approach strives to assure that at least two of the
three primary nutrients, N and P, are present in the soil in sufﬁcient quantities to achieve the
desired crop yield.

3.2.2. Farm Identiﬁcation Elements for Nutrient Management
Biosolids application can substantially offset or even completely eliminate the need for
chemical fertilizers when careful and deliberate nutrient management is employed. There are
four basic components to a voluntary biosolids nutrient management plan: (a) farm identiﬁ-
cation, (b) nutrient management plan summary, (c) nutrient allocation and use, and
(d) restrictions [11].
The following is a list of required information in order to develop the ﬁrst component, farm
identiﬁcation: (a) operator’s name, address, telephone no., and signature (including a land-
owner consent); (b) county(ies) where operation is located; (c) name(s) of adjacent streams;
(d) indication of any special protection waters; (e) total acres of operation; (f) total cropland
acres available for nutrient application; (g) total cropland acres planned for manure recycling,
excluding biosolids and other organic-N nutrient sources; (h) total cropland acres planned for
biosolids recycling, excluding manure and other organic-N nutrient sources; (i) total cropland
acres to which biosolids and manure both will be applied; (j) number of animal equivalent
units (AEUs) per acre receiving manure, if applicable; (k) name and certiﬁcation number of
nutrient management specialist, if applicable; (l) location maps showing outline of farm site
and soil survey maps containing soil types and slopes with outline of farm site; and (m) farm
maps of sufﬁcient scale to show the ﬁeld and operation boundaries and the areas where
biosolids application is limited or restricted.
3.2.3. Nutrient Management Plan Summary Elements
A nutrient management plan summary should include the following elements: (a) manure
management summary table, if applicable; (b) total manure generated on the farm site
annually; (c) total manure used on the farm site annually; (d) total manure exported from
the farm site annually; (e) biosolids management summary table; (f) total biosolids generated
by contributing sources; (f) total amount of biosolids which could be recycled in accordance
with the computed agronomic rate; (g) nutrient application rates by ﬁeld or crop group;
(h) general summary of excess manure utilization procedures; and (h) implementation
schedule [22].
3.2.4. Nutrient Allocation and Use Elements
The following items/information are needed for development of the nutrient management
plan: (a) amounts and various nutrient sources used on the operation; (b) the number of
animals of each animal type, if applicable; (c) acreage and expected crop yields for each crop
group; (d) the amount of nutrients necessary to meet expected crop yields; (e) residual-N from
legumes; (f) the nutrient content of the manure(s), if applicable; (g) the amount of PAN
originating from manure(s), considering the application method and planned manure incor-
poration time (volatilization losses), if applicable; (h) the amount of PAN originating from
past manure applications, if applicable; (i) the nutrient content of conventional fertilizers that
will be used regardless of other N sources (e.g., starter fertilizer and herbicide carrier
solutions); (j) the amount of PAN originating from conventional fertilizers; (j) the nutrient
content of the biosolids; (k) the amount of PAN originating from biosolids, considering the
592
L.K. Wang et al.

biosolids treatment method, biosolids-N forms, and planned application method; (l) the
amount of PAN originating from past biosolids applications; (m) planned manure application
rate(s), if applicable; (n) target spreading periods for manure application, if applicable;
(o) nitrogen balance calculation showing the biosolids agronomic rate for each management
unit; and (p) winter manure-spreading procedures, if applicable.
The types and properties of conventional fertilizers that are commonly used by farmers for
which biosolids may substitute are discussed at http://www.mawaterquality.org/capacity_
building/mid-atlantic%20nutrient%20management%20handbook/chapter8.pdf. The amount
of plant-available nitrogen contributed by legumes that can be subtracted from the needed
biosolids PAN can be estimated from the information in Table 4.4 at http://www.
mawaterquality.org/capacity_building/mid-atlantic%20nutrient%20management%20hand
book/chapter4.pdf. State-speciﬁc guidance should be used when available [22].
3.2.5. Restrictions Elements
Land application of biosolids may be restricted by nutrient management plans under the
following conditions: (a) frozen, snow-covered, and saturated soil conditions; (b) slope
constraints; (c) manure application isolation distances; and (d) biosolids application isolation
distances and harvest waiting periods. In addition, biosolids application to “environmentally
sensitive sites” (i.e., any ﬁeld which is particularly susceptible to nutrient loss to groundwater
or surface water) may be further restricted. In Virginia, such sites include those characterized
by (a) soils with high potential for leaching based on soil texture or excessive drainage;
(b) shallow soils less than 41 in. deep likely to be located over fractured or limestone bedrock;
(c) subsurface tile drains; (d) soils with high potential for subsurface lateral ﬂow based on soil
texture and poor drainage; (e) ﬂoodplains, as identiﬁed as soils prone to frequent ﬂooding in
county soil surveys; or (f) lands with slopes >15 % (http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/documents/
StandardsandCriteria.pdf).
4. DESIGN OF LAND APPLICATION PROCESS
4.1. Biosolids Application Rate Scenario
Design criteria for land application programs address issues related to application rates and
suitable sites. Biosolids, site, and vegetative characteristics are the most important design
factors to consider. Biosolids must meet regulatory requirements for stabilization and pollut-
ant content. In addition, nutrient content and physical characteristics, such as percent solids,
are used to determine the appropriate application rate for the crop that will be grown and the
soil in which the crops will be grown. Site suitability is determined based on such factors as
soil characteristics, slope, depth to groundwater, and proximity to surface water. In addition,
many states have established site requirements to further protect water quality. Some exam-
ples from various states include (a) sufﬁcient land to provide areas of non-application
(setbacks) around surface water bodies, wells, and wetlands; (b) depth from the soil surface
to groundwater equal to at least 1 m; (c) soil pH in the range of 5.5–7.0 to optimize crop
Land Application for Watershed Protection
593

growing conditions; and (d) site suitability is also inﬂuenced by the character of the surround-
ing area. While odors and truck trafﬁc may not be objectionable in an agricultural area, both
will adversely impact residential developments and community centers close to ﬁelds where
biosolids are applied.
The type of vegetation to be grown is also a design consideration. Vegetation, like soil
characteristics, will generally not exclude biosolids application since most vegetation will
beneﬁt from the practice. However, the type of vegetation will impact the choice of applica-
tion equipment, the amount of biosolids to be applied, and the timing of applications. The
amount of biosolids that may be applied to a site is a function of the amount of nutrients
required by the vegetation.
Application frequency is typically state regulations speciﬁc. For instance, Virginia permits
biosolids to be applied at agronomic-N rates only once every 3 years to reduce the risk of
surface water impairment due to P runoff from soil that has accrued excessive amounts of the
nutrient. Biosolids application timing is recommended for immediately prior to crop estab-
lishment to ensure most efﬁcient use of the mobile forms of nitrogen. Timing can be
determined by knowing the typical planting and harvesting times for crops, which are listed
at the following website for the mid-Atlantic, USA: http://www.mawaterquality.org/capac
ity_building/mid-atlantic%20nutrient%20management%20handbook/chapter5.pdf.
Other
factors to be considered in the timing of applications are soil conditions. Long periods of
saturated or frozen ground limit opportunities for application. This is an important consider-
ation in programs using agricultural lands; applications must be performed at times conve-
nient to the farmer and must not interfere with the planting of crops. Most application of
biosolids to agricultural land occurs in the early spring or late fall. As a result, storage or an
alternate biosolids management option must be available to handle biosolids when application
is not possible. Forest lands and reclamation sites allow more leeway in the timing of
applications. In some areas of the USA, application can proceed year round. Application is
most beneﬁcial on agricultural land in late fall or early spring before the crop is planted.
Timing is less critical in forest applications when nutrients can be incorporated into the soil
throughout the growing period or where no incorporation is required. Winter application is less
desirable, even prohibited, in many locales. Rangelands and pasturelands also are more adapt-
able to applications during various seasons. Applications can be made as long as ground is not
saturated or snow covered and whenever livestock can be grazed on alternate lands for at least
30 days after the application. The timing of single applications in land reclamation programs is
less critical and may be dictated by factors such as regulatory compliance schedules.
The concentrations of certain trace elements in the biosolids determine whether biosolids
can be applied and under what monitoring requirements. Table 12.3 presents the US EPA [1]
ceiling concentration limits, pollutant concentration limits, cumulative pollutant loading
rates, mean concentrations from the National Sewage Sludge Survey (NSSS [14]), and a
Penn State University [5] survey of heavy metals. Table 12.10 presents possible trace
elements concentration in typical unamended and biosolids-amended soils and the time
required to reach cumulative loading limits for the regulated trace elements when
biosolids containing metals at the concentrations found in the NSSS are applied annually at
agronomic-N rates.

4.2. Step-by-Step Procedures for Sludge Application Rate Determination
The application rate is a function of biosolids characteristics, soil characteristics, and crop
nutrient requirements. The estimated biosolids plant-available nitrogen content and the
nitrogen requirements of the crop for the speciﬁc soil type are necessary to calculate the
application rate. Nitrogen is present in aerobically digested biosolids in the organic, ammo-
nium, and nitrate forms. Nitrate nitrogen is not present in anaerobically digested or lime-
stabilized biosolids. Nitrogen is available for immediate plant use in the ammonium (NH4
+) or
nitrate (NO3
) forms. The availability of organic nitrogen to the crop depends on the
mineralization rate and will normally be available over a period of several years.
Usually, the biosolids application rate is ﬁrst determined based on nitrogen requirements.
This rate is then used to calculate phosphorus supply and compared to soil and crop P needs.
There are four basic steps involved in determining the biosolids agronomic rate (AR): (a) crop
nitrogen fertilizer rate (CNFR) determination, (b) crop nitrogen deﬁcit (CND) determination,
(c) biosolids plant-available nitrogen (PAN) determination, and (d) agronomic rate
(AR) calculation.
The following subsections provide detailed step-by-step procedures for calculation of
sludge application rate (AR) using all of the separate components listed above. In practice,
this analysis must be repeated for each farm ﬁeld contained in a land application
program [22].

4.2.1. Determining Crop Nitrogen Fertilizer Rate (CNFR)
Table 12.7 provides mean expected yields of selected Virginia soils, and supplemental
fertilizer-N, P and K rates are calculated from a combination of soil test recommendations and

needs
for
a
speciﬁc
soil
(http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/documents/
StandardsandCriteria.pdf). The biosolids agronomic rate is based on meeting crop needs
without overapplication of nitrogen. The total CNFR has been determined for various soil
productivity group and has been tabulated at http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/documents/
StandardsandCriteria.pdf.
Equation (12.1) is used for calculating CNFR:

UNFR ¼ unit nitrogen fertilizer rate, lbs N, per unit crop yield (as show in Table 12.17)
4.2.2. Determining Crop Nitrogen Deﬁcit (CND)
Crop nitrogen deﬁcit (CND) equals anticipated crop nitrogen fertilizer rate (CNFR) minus
all past biosolids PAN (PANA) and non-biosolids sources (PANS), in the unit of lb N/acre, as
shown in Equations (12.2) and (12.2a). Previous biosolids carryover nitrogen is included in
this calculation:
CND ¼ CNFR  PANA
ð
Þ  PANS
ð
Þ
ð12:2Þ
CND ¼ CNFR  PANT
ð
Þ
ð12:2aÞ
where
CND ¼ crop nitrogen deﬁcit, lb N/acre
CNFR ¼ crop nitrogen fertilizer rate, lb N/acre
PANA ¼ crop year biosolids PAN applied in previous years, lb N/acre
PANS ¼ crop year non-biosolids PAN applied in previous years, lb N/acre
PANT ¼ crop year total PAN applied in previous years, lb N/acre
Speciﬁcally, PAN contributions from all past and current planned non-biosolids sources
must be subtracted from the calculated CNFR to determine the CND that may be supplied by
biosolids applications for a particular ﬁeld crop. Nitrogen from all past sources (PANT) that
must be considered include (a) manure-N, if applicable, including current and historical
applications; (b) residual legume-N, if applicable, carryover from previous legume crops;
(c) starter fertilizer-N, if applicable; (d) conventional N-containing chemical fertilizers;
(e) biosolids organic-N carryover including nitrogen originating from the previous 3-year
applications; and (f) other nitrogen sources, such as land-applied crop or food-processing
residuals, irrigation water, nitrogen-solution pesticide carriers, and other nonconventional
fertilizer materials.
596
L.K. Wang et al.

The PANA (i.e., mainly organic-N application per acre) carryover from past biosolids
applications can be calculated using (12.3), Tables 12.8 and 12.11:
PANA ¼ A Km
ð
Þ Organic-Nr
ð

where
PANA ¼ crop year biosolids PAN applied in previous years, lb N/acre
A ¼ biosolids application per acre in previous years, dry ton/acre
Organic-Nr ¼ biosolids organic nitrogen remaining from previous years, lbs/dry ton (this is
calculated by subtracting the organic-N that has mineralized in previous years)
Km ¼ biosolids crop year organic-N mineralization factor based on the method of biosolids
treatment, lb/ton/% (see Tables 12.8 and 12.11)
4.2.3. Determining First-Year Plant-Available Nitrogen (PAN01)
Computing biosolids plant-available nitrogen (PAN) should account for (a) the type of
biosolids, (b) the method of biosolids application, (c) organic-N mineralization in subsequent
growing seasons, and (d) both inorganic and organic contributions to PAN. Total nitrogen is
the sum of nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, organic nitrogen, and ammonia (all expressed as
N). Note that for laboratory analysis purposes, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) is made up of
both organic nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen.
The ﬁrst-year plant-available nitrogen (PAN01) in biosolids may be summarized by
Equations (12.4) and (12.4a), in which all biosolids mass is based on dry solids:

4.2.4. Determining Biosolids Application Rate or Agronomic Rate
Determination of agronomic rate (AR) involves ﬁve basics: (a) selecting a realistic crop
yield goal, (b) determining N needs of this crop, (c) estimating residual-N in the soil from past
manures/legumes/biosolids, (d) determining the amount of supplemental-N needed to meet
the crop need, and (e) calculating the amount of biosolids necessary to supply this amount.
All of the above-listed crop-N sources have been discussed in previous sections of this
chapter. Note that the principal source for historical data is the farm operator. The agronomic
rate is calculated using the ﬁrst-year PAN content of the biosolids intended to be recycled and
the CND. Any change in either of these factors will impact the computed AR. Equation (12.5)
describes the calculation of agronomic rate (AR):

4.2.5. Determining Allowable Lifetime Biosolids Application
The determination of the lifetime allowable biosolids application rate (Rmax, maximum
agronomic rate) is based on the total accumulated heavy metals for application of biosolids
not meeting PCL. It should be noted that very few biosolids produced today fail to meet
PCL for the nine regulated trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn). The
total metals that can be applied are shown in Table 12.3. Using the information from

5. PERFORMANCE OF LAND APPLICATION
The land application system should provide safe biosolids use as well as providing
nutrients for crop growth. The majority of land application programs use agricultural land,
with the balance applied to forest lands, rangelands, or land in need of reclamation. The use of
land application has increased steadily due to including decreasing availability and increasing
costs associated with landﬁll disposal and incineration and increasingly expensive fertilizers.
Implementation of the Nationwide Pretreatment Program resulted in signiﬁcant improve-
ments in biosolids quality. The 1993 adoption of the Part 503 Rule created a structure for
consistent application procedures across the nation. The regulations were developed with
input from the US Department of Agriculture, the US Food and Drug Administration,
biosolids generators, environmental groups, the public, state regulators, and academic
researchers. Conservative assumptions were used to create regulations to “protect public
health and the environment from all reasonably anticipated adverse effects.”
The most appropriate application method for agricultural land depends on the physical
characteristics of the biosolids and the soil, as well as the types of crops grown. Biosolids are
generally land-applied using one of the following methods: (a) sprayed or spread on the soil
surface and left on the surface for pastures, range, and forest land and (b) incorporated into the
soil after being surface-applied or injected directly below the surface for producing row crops
or other vegetation. Both liquid and dewatered (or “cake”) biosolids may be applied to land
with or without subsequent soil incorporation.
Liquid biosolids can be applied by surface spreading or subsurface injection. Surface
methods include spreading by tractor-drawn tank wagons, special applicator vehicles
600
L.K. Wang et al.

equipped with ﬂotation tires, or irrigation systems. Surface application with incorporation is
normally limited to soils with less than a 7 % slope. Biosolids are commonly incorporated by
plowing or disking after the liquid has been applied to the soil surface and allowed to partially
dry, unless minimum or no-till systems are being used.
Spray irrigation systems generally should not be used to apply biosolids to forage or row
crops during the growing season, although a light application to the stubble of a forage crop
following a harvest is acceptable. The adherence of biosolids to plant vegetation can have a
detrimental effect on crop yields by reducing photosynthesis and provides a more direct
pathway for pollutant consumption by grazing animals. In addition, spray irrigation increases
the potential for odor problems and reduces the aesthetics at the application site.
Liquid biosolids can also be injected below the soil surface using tractor-drawn tank wagons
with injection shanks and tank trucks ﬁtted with ﬂotation tires and injection shanks. Both types
of equipment minimize odor problems and reduce ammonia volatilization by immediate
mixing of soil and biosolids. Injection can be used either before planting or after harvesting
crops, but it is likely to be unacceptable for forages and sod production. Some injection
shanks can damage the sod or forage stand and leave deep injection furrows in the ﬁeld.
Subsurface injection will minimize runoff from all soils and can be used on slopes up to
15 %. Injection should be made perpendicular to slopes to avoid having liquid biosolids run
downhill along injection slits and pond at the bottom of the slopes. As with surface applica-
tion, drier soil will be able to absorb more liquid, thereby minimizing downslope movement.
Dewatered biosolids can be applied to cropland by equipment similar to that used for
applying limestone, animal manures, or commercial fertilizer. Typically, dewatered biosolids
will be surface-applied and incorporated by plowing or another form of tillage. Incorporation
is not used following the application of biosolids to forages. Incorporation and injection of
biosolids can be used to meet Part 503 vector attraction reduction requirements.
Land application is a reliable biosolids management option as long as the system is
designed to address such issues as storage or alternate management for biosolids during
periods when application cannot take place due to unfavorable weather or ﬁeld conditions.
Public opposition rather than technical constraints is the most common reason for
discontinuing land application programs.
6. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
6.1. Process Monitoring
The monitoring program consists of the analyses shown in Table 12.12. Sampling and
monitoring must be performed by qualiﬁed personnel or outside certiﬁed laboratories.
Sensory observations can detect many problems before environmental monitoring tests.
When injecting liquid biosolids, the application rate should prevent biosolids from moving to
the soil surface. To remedy such an environmentally deleterious occurrence, the injector
speed should be increased or the biosolids ﬂow decreased in order to reduce the quantity of
biosolids injected per unit area. Excessive injector travel speed may cause soil to be thrown
away from the shank and create an open trench.
Land Application for Watershed Protection
601

If liquid biosolids are spread on the surface, the rate should be low enough to prevent
excessive ponding or runoff. Excessive ponding is when the liquid is still above the surface
several hours after biosolids application. Either excessive ponding or runoff indicates exces-
sive application rates for the soil. This will vary widely from soil to soil.
6.2. Process O&M Considerations
Land application systems generally use uncomplicated, reliable equipment. Operations
include pathogen reduction processing, dewatering, loading of transport vehicles,
transfer to application equipment, and the actual application. Operations and maintenance
considerations associated with pathogen reduction processing are discussed in another
chapter. The other operations require labor skills of heavy equipment operators, equipment
maintenance personnel, and ﬁeld technicians for sampling, all normally associated with
wastewater treatment facilities. In addition, the biosolids generator is responsible for
complying with state and local requirements as well as federal regulations. The biosolids
manager must be able to calculate agronomic rates and comply with record keeping and
recording requirements. In fact, the generator and land applier must sign certiﬁcation
statements verifying accuracy and compliance. The generator should also allocate time to
communicate with farmers, landowners, and neighbors about the beneﬁts of biosolids
recycling. Control of odors, along with a viable monitoring program, is most important
for public acceptance [21].
6.3. Process Control Considerations
Control of biosolids land application involves determination of application rate by close
monitoring of biosolids and soil conditions and determination of crop nutrient requirements.
The operation may change substantially after each year of operation. For example, biosolids
application rates may be lower each year due to residual nitrogen. The rate may be reduced

after several years of application due to phosphorus or heavy metal buildup. Added to this
variability is crop rotation which the farmer may practice periodically.
Process control steps required are proper rate setting, as described previously, and daily
control of actual biosolids quantities applied. The actual biosolids application rate is varied by
changing the number of passes made by the truck over the site. The ﬁeld should be marked
with numbered stakes to aid the equipment operators in proper application.
6.4. Maintenance Requirements and Safety Issues
Maintenance requirements are mainly cleaning and equipment service. The cleaning
operation includes daily ﬂushing of the injectors and periodic ﬂushing of the tanks.

Safety is related to vehicle and equipment operation. Generally, the highest potential for
accidents is when equipment is being backed or trailers are being connected or disconnected
from tractors. All drivers should be given a thorough drivers’ training course including
classroom and practice operation. All should be required to pass a drivers’ test specially
designed for this operation.
The only safety measure necessary beyond the usual common sense is to require a spotter to
assist drivers when backing trailers at the plant and to ensure that truck tires are at adequate
pressure and not excessively worn.
7. NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES
7.1. Startup Procedures
The start-up procedures include a daily check of trucks for oil level, fuel level, battery
condition, radiator water level, lights, and turn signals. The injector(s) should be checked for
ﬂushing and lubrication after the previous use. Solids content of the biosolids should be
determined in order to set the biosolids application rate. The total biosolids application rate
should be determined and provided to operating personnel along with an application plan. If
the biosolids have very high moisture content, the site may have to be covered more than once
with rest periods between applications to prevent ponding.
7.2. Routine Land Application Procedures
Biosolids are transferred to the site(s) and applied according to the predetermined plan. The
operator should be alert for ponding or other signs of problems. A record of the biosolids
application should be prepared and updated daily. These records will enable the farmer to
determine additional fertilizer requirements, future sludge application rates, and provide plant
personnel with a record of the biosolids application.
Land Application for Watershed Protection
603

7.3. Shutdown Procedures
At the end of the day, the truck and applicator should be washed to remove any remaining
solids and serviced. Tillage may be required if the biosolids were surface-applied rather than
injected; however, sites permitted for pasture and hayland, no-till crop production, or forest-
land do not require incorporation.
8. EMERGENCY OPERATING PROCEDURES
8.1. Loss of Power and/or Fuel
Loss of electrical power will not affect the ﬁeld or transport operations for biosolids
application, but there may be an impact on the characteristics of the biosolids. The nature
of this impact depends on the type of processes involved. Most likely the solids content will
decrease. Under these circumstances the solids concentration should be determined for each
load of biosolids. Nitrogen content and forms will change so the organic nitrogen, ammonia
nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen should be checked for each load.
Adequate provisions must be made to pump biosolids from the holding tank to the transport
truck at the sewage treatment plant. If the trucks are equipped with diesel engines and the fuel
runs out, the entire fuel system must be bled to remove air prior to starting the engine.
8.2. Loss of Other Biosolids Treatment Units
Other treatment units which will directly impact the land application operation are those
required for stabilization and concentration or dewatering. If the stabilization process is not
operating properly, biosolids characteristics will change. If the concentration or dewatering
process is not operating properly the biosolids moisture, content will be high and a greater
volume must be handled. In either case, the biosolids application rate must be changed to
account for the change in the biosolids characteristics.
9. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
Despite many positive impacts to the environment, land application can have negative
impacts on water, soil, and air if not practiced correctly [10–12, 21]. Negative impacts to
water result from the application of biosolids at rates that exceed the nutrient requirements of
the vegetation. Excess nutrients in the biosolids (primarily nitrogen compounds) can leach
from the soil and reach groundwater. Runoff from rainfall may also carry excess nutrients to
surface water. However, because biosolids are a slow-release fertilizer, the potential for
nitrogen compounds to leach from biosolids-amended soil is less than that posed by the use
of chemical fertilizers. In areas fertilized by either biosolids or chemicals, these potential
impacts are mitigated by proper management practices, including the application of biosolids
at agronomic rates. Maintenance of buffer zones between application areas and surface water
bodies and soil conservation practices will minimize impacts to surface water.
604
L.K. Wang et al.

Negative impacts to soil can result from mismanagement of a biosolids land application.
Federal regulations contain standards related to all metals of concern and application of
biosolids, which meet these standards, should not result in the accumulation of metals to
harmful levels. Stringent record keeping and reporting requirements on both the federal and
state level are imposed to prevent mismanagement.
Odors from biosolids applications are the primary negative impact to the air. Most odors
associated with land application are a greater nuisance than threat to human health or the
environment. Odor controls focus on reducing the odor potential of the biosolids or incorpo-
rating them into the soil. Stabilization processes such as digestion can decrease the potential
for odor generation. Biosolids that have been disinfected through the addition of lime may
emit ammonia odors, but they are generally localized and dissipate rapidly. Biosolids stabi-
lization reduces odors and usually results in an operation that is less offensive than manure
application.
Overall, a properly managed biosolids land application program is preferable to the use of
conventional fertilizers for the following reasons:
(a)
Biosolids are a recycled product, use of which does not deplete nonrenewable resources such as
phosphorus.
(b)
The nutrients in biosolids are not as soluble as those in chemical fertilizers and are, therefore,
released more slowly.
(c)
Biosolids’ appliers are required to maintain setbacks from water resources and are often subject to
more stringent soil conservation and erosion control practices, nutrient management, and record
keeping and reporting requirements than farmers who use only chemical fertilizers or manures.
(d)
Biosolids composition and application programs are closely monitored.
(e)
The organic matter in biosolids improves soil properties for optimum plant growth, including
tilth, friability, fertility, and water holding capacity.
A joint policy statement of the US Department of Agriculture, the US Food and Drug
Administration, and the US EPA states, “. . .the use of high quality biosolids coupled with
proper management procedures, should safeguard the consumer from contaminated crops and
minimize any potential adverse effect on the environment” [21].
10. LAND APPLICATION COSTS
It is difﬁcult to estimate the cost of land application of biosolids without speciﬁc program
details. For example, there is some economy of scale due to large equipment purchases. The
same size machine might be needed for a program that manages 10 dry tons of biosolids/day
as one managing 50 dry tons/day; the cost of that machine can be spread over the 10 or 50 dry
tons, greatly affecting average costs per dry ton. One source identiﬁed costs for land
application varying from USD 60 to USD 290/dry ton (M.S. Byerly, Georgia Tech; personal
communication). This range reﬂects the wide variety in land application methods as well as
varying methods to prepare biosolids for land application. For example, costs for programs
using dewatered biosolids include an additional step, whereas costs for programs using liquid
Land Application for Watershed Protection
605

biosolids do not reﬂect the cost of dewatering. They do, however, include generally higher
transportation costs.
Despite the wide range of costs for land application programs, several elements must be
considered in estimating the cost of any biosolids land application program: (a) purchase of
application equipment or contracting for application services; (b) transportation; (c) equipment
maintenance and fuel; (d) loading facilities; (e) labor; (f) capital, operation, and maintenance
of stabilization facilities; (g) ability to manage and control odors; (h) dewatering
(optional); (i) storage or alternate management option for periods when application is not
possible due to weather or climate; (j) regulatory compliance, such as permit applications, site
monitoring, and biosolids analyses; and (k) public education and outreach efforts.
Land must also be secured. Some municipalities have purchased farms for land application;
others apply biosolids to privately held land. Some operating costs can be offset through the
sale of the biosolids material. Since the biosolids reduce the need for fertilizers and pH
adjustment, farmers sometimes pay to have biosolids applied to their lands.
11. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS AND DESIGN EXAMPLES
11.1. Biosolids Treatment Before Agricultural Land Application
Discuss the necessity of having sludge stabilization before application of biosolids on
agricultural land.
11.1.1. Solution
The US Environmental Protection Agency’s 40 CFR Part 503, Standards for the Use and
Disposal of Sewage Sludge (the Part 503 Rule), requires that wastewater solids be processed
before they are land-applied. This processing is referred to as “stabilization” and helps
minimize odor generation, destroys pathogens (disease-causing organisms), and reduces
vector attraction potential. There are several methods to stabilize wastewater solids,
including (a) adjustment of pH, or alkaline stabilization; (b) digestion; (c) composting; and
(d) heat drying.
The Part 503 Rule deﬁnes two types of biosolids with respect to pathogen reduction: Class
A and Class B, depending on the degree of treatment the solids have received. Both types are
safe for land application, but additional requirements are imposed on Class B materials, which
are products of sewage sludge treated by a Process to Signiﬁcantly Reduce Pathogens (PSRP).
These are detailed in the Part 503 Rule and include restricting public access to the application
site, limiting livestock grazing, and controlling crop harvesting schedules. Class A biosolids, a
product of sewage sludge treated by a Process to Further Reduce Pathogens (PFRP) to
eliminate detectable pathogens, are not subject to these restrictions.
In addition to stabilization, the Part 503 Rule sets maximum concentrations of trace
elements which cannot be exceeded in biosolids that will be land-applied. These are termed
ceiling concentration limits (CCLs). Part 503 also establishes cumulative pollutant loading
rates (CPLRs) for eight trace elements which may not be exceeded by the application of
606
L.K. Wang et al.

biosolids meeting CCLs at land application sites. A third set of trace element criteria, termed
pollutant concentration limits (PCLs), is also included in Part 503. If these concentrations are
not exceeded in the biosolids to be land-applied, the cumulative pollutant loading rates do not
need to be tracked.
The term Exceptional Quality, or EQ, is often used to describe a biosolids product which
meets Class A pathogen reduction requirements, the most stringent trace element limits
(PCLs), and vector attraction reduction standards speciﬁed in the Part 503 Rule. Vectors
such as ﬂies, mosquitoes, rodents, and birds can transmit diseases directly to humans or play a
speciﬁc role in the life cycle of a pathogen as a host. Vector attraction reduction refers to
processing which makes the biosolids less attractive to vectors, thereby reducing the potential
for transmitting diseases. Exceptional Quality biosolids products are as safe as other agricul-
tural and horticultural products and may be used without site restrictions [20].
11.2. Advantages and Disadvantages of Biosolids Land Application
Discuss the applicability, advantages, and disadvantages of applying biosolids on agricul-
tural land based on real case histories.
11.2.1. Solution
Land application is well suited for managing solids from any size wastewater treatment
facility. As the method of choice for small facilities, it offers cost advantages, beneﬁts to the
environment, and value to the agricultural community. However, biosolids produced by many
major metropolitan areas across the country are also land-applied. For example, biosolids
from the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Facility serving the District of Columbia and
surrounding communities in Virginia and Maryland have been land-applied since the plant
began operation in 1930. The cities of Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, New York, Seattle, and
Los Angeles all land-apply at least part of their biosolids production. Land application is most
easily implemented where agricultural land is available near the site of biosolids production,
but advances in transportation have made land application viable even where hauling dis-
tances are greater than 1,000 miles. For example, Philadelphia has shipped dewatered bio-
solids to reclaim strip mines in western Pennsylvania and, even, southwestern Virginia, and
New York City ships some of its biosolids over 2,000 miles to Texas and Colorado.
Land application offers several advantages as well as some disadvantages that must be
considered before selecting this option for managing biosolids. Land application is an
excellent way to recycle wastewater solids as long as the material is quality-controlled. It
returns valuable nutrients to the soil and enhances conditions for vegetative growth. Land
application is a relatively inexpensive option, and capital investments are generally lower
than other biosolids management technologies. Contractors can provide the necessary hauling
and land application equipment. In addition, on-site spatial needs can be relatively minor
depending on the method of stabilization selected.
Although land application requires relatively less capital, the process can be labor intensive.
Even if contractors are used for application, management oversight is essential for program
success. Land application is also limited to certain times of theyear, especially in colder climates.
Land Application for Watershed Protection
607

Biosolids should not be applied to frozen or snow-covered grounds, while farm ﬁelds are
sometimes not accessible during the growing season. Therefore, it is often necessary to provide
a storage capacity in conjunction with land application programs. Precipitation can preclude the
use of application equipment on farm ﬁelds, necessitating biosolids storage until soil conditions
improve. Another disadvantage of land application is potential public opposition, which is
encountered most often when the beneﬁcial use site is close to residential areas. Objectionable
odor elicits strong emotional response, but the primary reasons for public concern are human
health and environmental quality. In worst-case situations, local governments may pass ordi-
nances which ban or restrict the use of biosolids. However, many successful programs have
gained public support through effective communications, an absolutely essential component in
the beneﬁcial use of biosolids.
11.3. Design Worksheet for Determining the Agronomic Rate
A design worksheet for determining the agronomic rate has been prepared by US EPA
[1]. Introduce the worksheet.
11.3.1. Solution
The US EPA worksheet for determining the agronomic rate is presented in Table 12.13.
11.4. Calculation for Available Mineralized Organic Nitrogen
Assume that anaerobically digested biosolids with a 3 % organic nitrogen content (dry
weight basis) was applied to the site at a rate of 5 mt/ha in 2006. The following year (2007),
3 mt/ha of biosolids (same organic nitrogen content as in 2006) was applied to the same site.
It is now 2008, and you want to calculate the plant-available nitrogen (PAN) from previous
biosolids applications.
11.4.1. Solution
The worksheet and the calculations are both presented in Table 12.14 [1]. Here 1 hectare
¼ 1 ha ¼ 2.471 acres. 1 US ton ¼ 2000 lbs ¼ 0.908 mt. 1 metric ton ¼ 1 mt ¼ 1,000 kg.
Note: The calculations employ 0.20-0.10-0.05 as the mineralization factors for anaerobically
digested biosolids for years 0–1, 1–2, and 2–3 years after application, respectively. More
recent research has resulted in some states adopting slightly different mineralization factors
(Table 12.8).

11.5.1. Solution
Risk Assessment Approach
The risk assessment process was the most comprehensive analysis of its kind ever under-
taken by the US EPA. The resultant US Federal Regulations Part 503 was designed to provide
“reasonable worst-case,” not absolute, protection to human health and the environment. The
initial task of the 10-year risk assessment process was to establish a range of concentrations
for trace elements and organic compounds that had the greatest potential for harm based on
known human, animal, and plant toxicities. Maximum safe accumulations for the chemical
constituents in soil were established from the most limiting of 14 pathways of exposure
(Table 12.15), which included risks posed to human health, plant toxicity and uptake, effects
on livestock or wildlife, and water quality impacts. A total of 200 chemical constituents were

screened by the US EPA [14, 16], and 50 of these were selected for further evaluation, using
the criteria above and the availability of data for a preliminary risk assessment. Twenty-three
of the 50 constituents were identiﬁed as warranting consideration for regulation based on the
risk assessment. No regulatory limits were set for the 13 trace organic compounds in this
group because the US EPA risk assessment showed that the safe levels were considerably
higher than the observed concentrations in biosolids. The 503 Rule was then limited to ten
trace elements (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead mercury, molybdenum, nickel,
selenium, and zinc). Chromium was subsequently dropped on a court challenge because the
risk assessment had shown a very low risk level for this metal.
The most limiting pathway for each of the nine regulated trace elements was used to develop
pollutant concentration limits and lifetime loading rate standards. For example, the greatest
risk to a target organism from lead (Pb) is a child directly ingesting biosolids that have been
applied to soil. The pollutant limits are therefore based on estimates of childhood soil
consumption that US EPA considered conservative (i.e., they predict a greater impact on
human health than is likely to occur). Ingestion of biosolids is the most limiting pathway for
ﬁve of the trace elements (As, Cd, Pb, Hg, and Se), phytotoxicity was most limiting for three
trace elements (Cu, Ni, and Zn), and feed consumption by animal was the most limiting for Mo.
Under Part 503, the cumulative pollutant loading rate (CPLR) limits established by US
EPA for eight trace elements would allow the concentrations of these elements to increase to
levels that are 10–100 times the normal background concentrations in soil (Table 12.10). The
time that it would take for each of the eight elements to reach its cumulative loading limit
when biosolids with typical trace element concentrations are applied annually at a rate of
5 dry tons/acre is also presented in Table 12.10. These are conservative estimates where
agronomic loading rates are normally applied once every 3 years, not annually. The cumu-
lative pollutant loading rate (CPLR) limits were developed to ensure that soil metals never
reach harmful levels. Future applications of biosolids to the site would be prohibited if the
cumulative loading limit for any of the nine trace elements is reached [20].
Alternative Regulatory Approach: Best Available Technology
An alternative to the risk assessment approach, termed best available technology (BAT)
approach, limits contaminants in biosolids to concentrations attained by the best current
technology (e.g., industrial pretreatment and separation of sanitary, storm, and industrial
sewerage). BAT is more restrictive of land application than risk assessment (i.e., lower
pollutant concentrations can be attained using the best available technology than are permitted
under the risk assessment approach). Biosolids are more likely to be landﬁlled or incinerated
under this approach than under risk assessment [20].
Alternative Regulatory Approach: Non-contamination Approach
The US EPA Part 503 Federal Regulations take the position that all biosolids management
options incur some risk and that these risks can be evaluated so that regulations governing use
and management options can be developed to reduce risk to acceptable (safe) levels. There are
some who believe that the application of any biosolids that would cause an increase in the soil
612
L.K. Wang et al.

concentration of any pollutant is unacceptable. This is called the “non-contamination”
approach. According to this approach, any addition of a pollutant to the soil must be matched
by removal of that pollutant so that no long-term buildup occurs in the soil. This is the most
restrictive of approaches to the land application of biosolids and is favored by those who
believe that any increase in pollutant concentration in the soil is undesirable, regardless of
what risk assessment demonstrates. Although this approach reduces to zero any environmen-
tal risks from land application of biosolids, it diverts more biosolids to landﬁlls or incinera-
tors, thereby increasing the environmental risks associated with disposal and reducing
recycling of nutrients and organic matter [20]. Each approach for regulating contaminants
in biosolids has its technical and scientiﬁc foundation, but the approach selected is based
primarily on legislative mandates and policy decisions [20].
11.6. Tracking Cumulative Pollutant Loading Rates on Land Application Sites
Introduce the worksheet which has been prepared by US EPA.
11.6.1. Solution
The deﬁnition and environmental engineering signiﬁcance of cumulative pollutant loading
rate (CPLR) can be found from Table 12.3.
The US EPA worksheet for tracking CPLR is presented in Table 12.16 [1].
11.7. Management of Nitrogen in the Soils and Biosolids
Study the US EPA report [1], and discuss the managerial strategy for controlling nitrogen
in the soils and sewage sludge.
11.7.1. Solution
Nitrogen exists in the soils and biosolids in three basic forms:
(a)
Organic nitrogen: This refers mainly to carbon-based compounds such as proteins and amino
acids. Little of this form is available to plants and must largely be converted to inorganic nitrogen
by soil microorganisms. Mineralization is the conversion of organic-N to inorganic-N in the form
of ammonium. Mineralization rates of organic-N in biosolids vary for different climatic regimes
and soils. The rate of N mineralization decreases with time and is typically not calculated as for
longer than 3 years after biosolids application.
(b)
Inorganic nitrogen (ammonium-N, nitrite-N, and nitrate-N): Plants readily assimilate nitrate and
ammonium ions. The soil microbes and plants compete for this inorganic-N. Rapidly growing soil
microbes can immobilize or “tie up” the ammonium and nitrate in the soil by converting it to the
organic form and may temporarily deplete the available N in the soil for plant uptake when the
C/N ratio of a soil amendment is wide (i.e., >25:1). The positively charged ammonium ions are
adsorbed by clay and organic matter so that little of this form is leached. Nitriﬁcation is the
process whereby soil microbes convert ammonium to nitrate. Nitrate is very mobile and readily
leached. Nitrite is usually not present in signiﬁcant concentrations.
(c)
Gaseous nitrogen (nitrogen gas, ammonia gas): Nitrogen gas is present in the soil atmosphere (air)
and is a source of N for legumes, which can convert this to plant usable ammonium ion (NH4
+).

Under anaerobic conditions and readily available carbon source, microorganisms can convert
nitrate to nitrogen gas and nitrous oxide (N2O) in a process termed denitriﬁcation. Under alkaline
conditions, ammonium ions lose a hydrogen ion and become ammonia, which readily volatilizes
as ammonia gas (NH3).
Plants use only a portion of the total nitrogen in biosolids. Some of the nitrate and ammonium
is lost to the atmosphere by denitriﬁcation and volatilization, and some of the organic nitrogen
becomes available over time as the mineralization process converts the organic forms to
ammonium and nitrate. Some of the nitrate is lost through leaching. The goal when designing
the agronomic rate for an application site is to supply the necessary amount of nitrogen needed
for the crops or vegetation to produce the desired harvest yield while minimizing leaching of
the nitrogen below the root zone. The rates of mineralization, plant uptake, volatilization, and
denitriﬁcation are dependent on many factors and will vary from site to site and at the
same site.
Predicting how much biosolids are needed to provide the nitrogen sufﬁcient to meet crop
yield goals and minimize leaching of nitrogen below the root zone requires consideration of
numerous factors. The following are some factors that inﬂuence the amount of sewage sludge
that can be applied:
1.
Total nitrogen content in biosolids and the concentrations (or percentage of the total nitrogen) of
the various nitrogen forms in the biosolids are inﬂuenced by the types of processing operations.
Anaerobic digestion (30 days or longer) produces biosolids that have high concentrations of
organic-N and ammonium but little nitrate (oxygen is required to proceed from ammonia to
nitrate). Aerobically digested biosolids have higher levels of nitrate than anaerobically digested
sewage sludge, but are still comprised largely of organic and ammonium forms of N. Dewatering
reduces the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium-N, which are soluble in biosolids liquid
fraction.
2.
The mineralization rate at the application site is affected by how well the sewage sludge was
stabilized in the digester. Poor stabilization results in more organic nitrogen for mineralization.
Good stabilization converts most of the organic nitrogen into readily available inorganic-N,
leaving only that which is relatively inert and resistant to further mineralization (this sewage
sludge may have a low mineralization rate).
3.
The mineralization rate is also inﬂuenced by soil temperature and texture. Higher temperature
increases the metabolic rate of microorganisms; thus, mineralization rates are typically higher in
warmer than in colder periods and regions. Mineralization and nitriﬁcation are increased by
aeration; thus, coarser textured soils, which facilitate gas exchange and are more likely than
ﬁne-textured soils to be well drained, have higher rates of N mineralization and nitriﬁcation.
4.
The amount of ammonium lost through volatilization to the atmosphere is affected by soil/
biosolids pH: The fraction of NH4/NH3 in the gaseous ammonia phase increases with
pH. Volatilization losses of ammonia are reduced as biosolids are more thoroughly mixed with
soil after application. Volatilization occurs rapidly, with the greatest loss occurring within the ﬁrst
week, if biosolids are left on the soil surface. Incorporation of surface-applied biosolids immedi-
ately after application or injection of liquid biosolids can greatly reduce the loss.
5.
The amount of ammonia lost through volatilization is decreased when biosolids are incorporated
into moist soils or when rainfall occurring immediately after surface application transports the
soluble ammonia into the soil.

6.
The amount of nitrate that is lost to the atmosphere by denitriﬁcation is affected by factors that
contribute to anaerobic conditions and by the metabolic rate of the denitrifying microorganisms.
The factors are the following:
(a)
Soil moisture—Saturated soils have fewer pore spaces occupied by oxygen, thus creating
anaerobic conditions that favor the growth of denitrifying microorganisms.
(b)
Soil type—Fine-textured soils are more likely to become anaerobic than coarse-textured
soils, thus increasing the potential for denitriﬁcation even when soil is not saturated.
(c)
Carbon source—An abundant source of readily oxidizable carbon will increase the
denitriﬁcation rate.
(d)
Nitrate levels—Denitriﬁcation will occur rapidly where nitrate levels provide a sufﬁcient
source of nitrogen for the microorganisms.
11.8. Converting Wet Weight Pollutant Concentrations to Dry Weight Basis
Laboratory results for biosolids are typically reported in one of two forms: (a) wet weight
(i.e., mg/L) for liquid biosolids or dry weight (i.e., mg/kg) for biosolids containing greater
than ~12 % solids. The concentration limits for pollutants and pathogens in the regulation are
expressed as dry weight concentrations. Therefore, if laboratory results are reported on a wet
weight basis, the percent solids content of the sewage sludge must be determined to verify
compliance with sewage sludge requirements [30]. The percent solids value is used to convert
analytical results expressed as wet weight basis to a dry weight basis, as demonstrated in this
example [1]. If an engineer assumes that the speciﬁc gravity of the solids is equivalent to the
speciﬁc gravity of water, a simpliﬁed equation can be used to express the concentration of
pollutant on a dry weight basis:
W
PCs=100 ¼ D
ð12:18Þ
where
W ¼ the concentration of the pollutant in the sewage sludge on a wet basis in mg/L
D ¼ the concentration of the pollutant in the sewage sludge on a dry weight basis, in mg/kg
PCs ¼ percentage of solids, %
For example, if the concentration of zinc in the sewage sludge is reported as 200 mg/L and
the percent solids content of the sewage sludge is 24 %, determine the concentration on dry
weight basis using Equation (12.18).

11.12. Calculating the Components of Plant-Available Nitrogen
(PAN) in Biosolids
For all practical purposes, total nitrogen (TN) in soil or nutrient-containing materials is the
summation of ammonium nitrogen (NH4
+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3
-N), and organic nitro-
gen because nitrite nitrogen occurs in negligible amount. Crops directly utilize nitrogen in its
inorganic forms, principally nitrate-N and ammonium-N.
Analytical methods [38] determine only total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonium nitro-
gen (NH4
+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3
-N), and nitrite nitrogen (NO2
-N). Organic nitrogen
(organic-N) can be calculated by subtracting ammonium-N from TKN as in (12.31c) below.

The units of Ntotal, NTKN, Nammonium, Nnitrate, and Norganic are all “lb N/ton of biosolids.”
The following is an example to illustrate how the components of PAN in biosolids can be
calculated using the above equations. Lime-stabilized biosolids have a nitrate nitrogen
concentration of 1,000 mg/kg, an ammonium nitrogen concentration of 2,000 mg/kg, and a
total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentration of 27,000 mg/kg, all on a dry weight basis. The biosolids
contain 17.6 % dry solids. Determine the components of plant-available nitrogen (PAN) in
“lb N/ton of dry biosolids.”
11.12.1. Solution
Since nitrate nitrogen concentration, ammonium nitrogen concentration, nitrite nitrogen
concentration, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentration are 1,000, 2,000, 0, and
27,000 mg/kg, respectively, then PCnitrate, PCammonium, and PCTKN equal 0.1, 0.2, and 2.7 %,

Lime-stabilized sludge (i.e., biosolids) has a nitrate nitrogen concentration of 1,000 mg/kg,
an ammonium nitrogen concentration of 2,000 mg/kg, a nitrite nitrogen concentration of
0 mg/kg, and a total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentration of 27,000 mg/kg, all on a dry
weight basis. The calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) and pH of the lime-stabilized biosolids
are 40 % and >10, respectively. The biosolids contain 17.6 % dry solids. The biosolids will be
surface-applied and disked into the soil within 24 h in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA.
Determine the ﬁrst-year PAN01 from the lime-stabilized biosolids.

calculated using Equation (12.4) when the ammonium nitrogen volatilization factor (KV)
and the biosolids ﬁrst-year organic nitrogen mineralization factor (F01) are also known. Here,

management of biosolids and septage can be scientiﬁcally achieved using the US EPA method
[1, 10]. It is suggested by NBP that the US EPA method be adopted and tailored for local
cropping practices, and the regulatory requirements in each state ([16, 18, 22], http://www.
mawaterquality.org/capacity_building/mid-atlantic%20nutrient%20management%20hand
book/chapter10.pdf). The following are the four steps of tabulated calculations.
Step 1. Calculating CNFR (Table 12.19)
Step 2. Calculating CND (Table 12.19)
Step 3. Calculating biosolids PAN (Table 12.20)
Step 4. Calculating agronomic rate (AR) (Table 12.20)
In Step 4, the calculated AR is 2 dry tons/acre (equivalent to 10 wet tons/acre), as
demonstrated in the AR calculation in Table 12.20. The AR in dry tons per acre is converted
to wet tons per acre by dividing dry ton/acre by the solids content (in decimal form). In this
case, 2 dry tons/acre is equivalent to 10 wet tons/acre when the solids given content is 20 %.
11.16. Calculating the Required Land for Biosolids Application
The recommended amount of nitrogen needed by a corn crop to be grown on a Cecil soil in
Virginia is 120 lbs/acre/year. Biosolids containing 3 % nitrogen could be applied at up to 5.4

11.17. Calculating the Nitrogen-Based and the Phosphorus-Based Agronomic
Rates for Agricultural Land Application
Applying biosolids to meet the phosphorus, rather than the nitrogen, needs of the crop is a
conservative approach for determining annual biosolids application rates ([1, 17, 19]; http://
www.mawaterquality.org/capacity_building/mid-atlantic%20nutrient%20management%20hand
book/chapter10.pdf). Supplemental nitrogen fertilization will be needed to optimize crop
yields (except for nitrogen-ﬁxing legumes) if biosolids application rates are based on a
crop’s phosphorus needs. The phosphorus in biosolids is estimated to be about half as
available for plant uptake as the phosphorus normally applied to soils in commercial inorganic
fertilizers. The phosphorus balance and the phosphorus-based agronomic rate of biosolids for
land application can be determined by Equation (12.16) and Equation (12.33), respectively:
ARP
ð
Þ ¼ Prequired


= Pcontent
ð
ÞF
½

ð12:33Þ
where
ARP ¼ Phosphorus-based agronomic rate, dry ton/acre
Pcontent ¼ phosphorus content in biosolids, lb P/ton biosolids (or lb P2O5/ton biosolids)
Prequired ¼ phosphorus requirement for the land, lb P/acre (or lb P2O5/acre)
F ¼ a factor of availability ¼ 0.5 (assuming 50 % will be available)
It should be noted that Equation (12.33) is another version of Equation (12.16) assuming
Pbalance ¼ 0, and F ¼ 0.5 for practical applications. The units of Pcontent and Prequired in the
above equation must be compatible (i.e., both based on P, or both based on P2O5).
Prequired is the phosphorus fertilizer recommendation for the harvested crop or the quantity
of phosphorus removed by the crop. The US EPA assumes that only 50 % of Pcontent will be
available as the plant-available phosphorus (PAP); however, this availability factor varies
among states/regions. For example, the states bordering the Chesapeake Bay typically assume
100 % P availability unless a P index is employed to account for availability and transport
factors
(http://www.mawaterquality.org/publications/pubs/PSIWhitePaper03-29-05.pdf).
Two conversion factors are used in determining the phosphorus-based agronomic rate:
1 % on dry basis ¼ 20 lbs/ton ¼ 10 kg/T (where 1 T ¼ 1 mt ¼ 1 metric ton ¼ 1,000 kg)
1 lb P ¼ 2.3 lbs P2O5
1 kg P ¼ 2.3 kg P2O5
An example prepared by G.K. Evanylo of Virginia Tech [19] is presented here for showing
how the phosphorus-based agronomic rate (AR) can be calculated for agricultural land
application.

Lime-stabilized biosolids have a pH > 10, a calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) of 40 %,
a nitrate nitrogen concentration of 1,000 mg/kg (0.1 %), an ammonium nitrogen concentration
of 2,000 mg/kg (0.2 %), a total nitrogen concentration of 27,000 mg/kg (2.7 %), and a total
phosphorus concentration of 21,000 mg/kg (2.1 %), all on a dry weight basis (percent dry
solids is 17.6 %). Corn for grain is to be grown on a Kempsville sandy loam soil that has a pH
of 6.2; “high” Ca, Mg, and K soil test ratings; and a “low” P soil test rating. The biosolids will
be surface-applied and disked into the soil within 24 h.
What should be the nitrogen-based agronomic rate and the phosphorus-based agronomic
rate of the lime-stabilized biosolids?
11.17.1. Solution
Step 1. Nitrogen-based agronomic rate
The estimated yield potential of corn grown on a Kempsville soil is 140 bu/acre
(Table 12.7), and the N rate permitted is 140 lbs/acre according to the Virginia Biosolids
Use Regulations [13].
The nitrogen components of PAN in the biosolids have been calculated in Sect. 11.13.1 as

11.18. Calculating the Lime-Based Agronomic Rate for Agricultural
Land Application
Application rates for lime-stabilized or lime-conditioned biosolids may be computed by
determining the biosolids calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) [18]. The CCE provides a
direct comparison of the liming value of the biosolids with calcium carbonate limestone,
which is the basis for soil testing liming requirements. Biosolids conditioned or stabilized
with lime may have a CCE of between 10 and 50 % on a dry weight basis. The agronomic lime
rate for biosolids is determined from Equation (12.34):
ARL
ð
Þ ¼ Lrequired


= Lcontent
ð
Þ
ð12:34Þ
where
ARL ¼ lime-based agronomic rate, dry ton/acre
Lcontent ¼ lime content in sludge in terms of CCE, % (in decimal form; for instance, 40 % ¼ 0.4)
Lrequired ¼ lime requirement for the land in terms of CCE, ton CCE/acre
Determine the lime-based agronomic rate for the same lime-stabilized biosolids introduced
in Sect. 11.17.
11.18.1. Solution
It is known that CCE of the lime-stabilized biosolids is 40 %. The coarse-textured
Kempsville soil is permitted 0.75 tons limestone/acre according to Virginia Biosolids Use
Regulations [13]. Thus, the rate of lime-stabilized biosolids to provide 0.75 tons CCE/acre can
be calculated by Equation (12.34) as follows;
Lcontent ¼ lime content in biosolids in terms of CCE ¼ 40 % ¼ 0.4
Lrequired ¼ lime requirement for the land in terms of CCE ¼ 0.75 ton CCE/acre
ARL
ð
Þ ¼ lime-based agronomic rate, dry ton=acre





Lcontent

¼ 0:75
ð
Þ=

0:4

¼ 1:9 tons biosolids=acre
In summary, the N-based, P-based, and lime-based agronomic rates for the examples
presented in this section are 7, 2.5, and 1.9 dry tons/acre, respectively. The most limiting is
the lime-based agronomic rate; thus, 1.9 dry tons or 10.8 wet tons (1.9 dry tons/acre divided
by 0.176 dry tons/wet ton) should be the appropriate agronomic rate.
11.19. Calculating Potassium Fertilizer Needs
The amounts of plant-available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and other nutrients
added by biosolids should be calculated once the design application rate (ARdesign) has been
determined. Supplemental fertilizers should be applied if the amount of any nutrients in the
biosolids is less than that recommended [1, 10, 19].
628
L.K. Wang et al.

The amount of potassium applied in biosolids can be calculated from biosolids composition
data (as done earlier for P) according to Equation (12.17):
Kbalance ¼ ARdesign


 Kcontent
ð
ÞF  Krequired
ð12:17Þ
All of the potassium in biosolids can be assumed to be readily plant available because
potassium is a soluble element. The availability factor F is assumed to be 100 % or 1.0 for
potassium in biosolids.
In case the nitrogen-based agronomic rate (AR) has been chosen for agricultural land
application of biosolids, then ARdesign ¼ AR. Kbalance will be a negative value showing the
needed lb K/acre (or lb K2O/acre).
It has been known that the nitrogen-based agronomic rate (AR ¼ 7 dry tons/acre) is to be
chosen to be for actual operation of land application. A biosolid containing 0.52 % K is to be
applied to a wheat ﬁeld, which has a potassium fertilizer recommendation of 135 lbs K2O/
acre. Determine the additional K2O needed (i.e., a negative Kbalance value) for the wheat ﬁeld.
11.19.1. Solution
ARdesign ¼ biosolids application rate selected for design ¼ nitrogen-based AR ¼ 7 dry
tons biosolids/acre
Kcontent ¼ potassium content in sludge

11.20. Land Application Inspection, Monitoring, Testing and Documentation
Discuss the needs of inspection, sampling, testing, recording, and laboratory equipment for
biosolids land application.
11.20.1. Solution
Pollutant concentrations and pathogen densities must be monitored regularly to ensure
that the biosolids permitted for land application meet the standards necessary to protect health
and environment [1, 10, 17]. The monitoring program includes the analyses shown in
Table 12.12. Sampling and monitoring must be performed by qualiﬁed personnel or outside
Land Application for Watershed Protection
629

laboratories. Sensory observations can detect many problems before environmental monitor-
ing examinations.
When injecting biosolids, the application rate should be such that biosolids do not surface.
If biosolids do surface, the injector speed should be increased or the biosolids ﬂow decreased
so that the quantity injected per unit area decreases. If the injector travel speed is excessive,
soil may be thrown away from the shank creating an open trench. If the biosolids are spread on
the surface, the rate should be low enough to prevent the excessive ponding or runoff.
Excessive ponding is when the liquid is still above the surface several hours after application.
Either excessive ponding or runoff indicates excessive application rates for the soil.
Both cleaning operation and equipment service are important. The cleaning operation
includes daily ﬂushing of the injectors (if used) and periodic ﬂushing of the tanks. Truck,
tractor, and equipment preventative maintenance schedules are usually speciﬁed in manufac-
turer’s manuals. In addition to the normal record kept for monitoring and process control, the
ﬁeld operator(s) must keep a daily log or site map record to show where, when, and how much
sludge has been applied.
Soil sampling and testing is a critical foundation of nutrient management plan development
required to ensure that biosolids are applied appropriately. A detailed discussion of soil testing
and analysis has been published (http://www.mawaterquality.org/capacity_building/mid-
atlantic%20nutrient%20management%20handbook/chapter7.pdf).
12. LAND APPLICATION, CROP MANAGEMENT AND WATERSHED
MANAGEMENT
12.1. Nonpoint Source Pollution from Land Application
Runoff and/or leaching from a land application system may become a nonpoint source of
pollution to streams, lakes, or groundwater. A coordinated effort is needed for implementation
of the best management practices (BMP) that minimize nonpoint source pollution from a land
application site. Such land application facilities require licensed operators to oversee the
facility operation and management [1, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 22]. Pollutants include nutrients
(nitrogen, phosphorus), BOD, COD, heavy metals, pathogenic microorganisms, and hor-
mones [1, 4, 6–8, 20, 29].
12.2. Land Application Operation, Crop Management,
and Watershed Protection
An optimized land application system may ensure its sustainable operation, adequate crop
and forage management, public acceptance, and long-term watershed protection [32–41]. For
environmental conservation and watershed protection, North Carolina State University [34]
recommends the following knowledge and skills for a land application manager or operator:
(a) irrigation and waste application system calibration and troubleshooting; (b) crop, forage,
and nutrient management and crop problem identiﬁcation; (c) soil, plant tissue, and waste
testing and sampling; (d) winterization and maintenance of wasteland application equipment;
630
L.K. Wang et al.

(e) sludge management and solids separation; (f) waste application scheduling; (g) record
keeping and ﬂow measurement; and (h) irrigation system design.
Some of the best management practices (BMP) concerning land application of manure and
biosolids have been recommended by the University of Delaware [35] for both land applica-
tion optimization and watershed protection: (a) operator should ask for assistance from state
ofﬁces in planning to meet runoff requirements; (b) bioengineering (i.e., buffer streams with
native, durable, non-crop vegetation) should be practiced; (c) nutrient management plans
should be developed and implemented to guide the storage and land application of manure;
(d) for better crop management, crop rotation and contour planting when appropriate should
be established; (e) where possible, animal diets and feed should be modiﬁed to reduce the
amounts of nutrients and hormones in manure; (f) land application system should be operated
according to the comprehensive nutrient management plan in order to minimize water quality
and public health risk; (g) tillage, crop residue management, grazing management, and other
conservation practices should be used to minimize the movement of soil, organic materials,
nutrients and pathogens to surface and groundwater from lands where manure is applied;
(h) manure and biosolids need to be handled and stored properly to prevent water pollution
from runoff and to reduce the potential for nutrient release into the air; (i) in vulnerable
watersheds, where the potential for environmentally sound land application is limited,
alternative uses of manure, such as the sale of manure to other farmers, composting, and
sales of compost to home owners, and using manure for power generation may need to be
considered; (j) operators should keep records that indicate the quantity of manure produced
and ultimate application on land, including where, when, and amount of nutrients applied.
12.3. Watershed Protection Act and Distressed Watershed Rules
Watershed protection rules and regulations vary among states and regions in the USA,
although their goals and requirements are similar. The authors of this chapter introduce The
Watershed Protection Act (WPA) and Distressed Watershed Rules (DWR) of the Common-
wealth of Massachusetts, USA, as typical examples. Only the portions of the WPA and DWR
concerning land applications are emphasized. The Massachusetts Department of Conserva-
tion and Recreation (Massachusetts DCR) published its “Watershed Protection Act Guidance
Document” in March 2006 [36, 37]. The WPA regulates land use and activities with certain
designated areas in Massachusetts, for watershed protection.
WPA protects the quality of these drinking water sources by establishing two buffer zones
around hydrologic water resources: (a) primary protection zone (within 400 ft of the reser-
voirs and 200 ft of tributaries and surface waters) in which any alteration is prohibited, and
generation, storage, disposal, or discharge of pollutants is also prohibited and (b) secondary
protection zone (between 200 and 400 ft of tributaries and surface waters, and on land within
ﬂood plains, over some aquifers, and within bordering vegetated wetlands) in which certain
activities are speciﬁcally prohibited. These include storage/disposal/use of toxic, hazardous
and other toxic materials, and the alteration of bordering vegetated wetlands as examples.
The Massachusetts DCR has identiﬁed numerical levels of each factor that give some
indication of whether there will be substantial detriment or impairment of water quality. The
Land Application for Watershed Protection
631

numerical levels fall into three categories [37]: (a) low likelihood of substantial detriment to
the public good or impairment of water quality, (b) potential for substantial detriment to the
public good or impairment of water quality, and (c) high likelihood of substantial detriment to
the public good or impairment of water quality.

to reservoir, fecal coliform level, turbidity, phosphorus, and impervious surface on the
likelihood of signiﬁcant risk to water quality.
A “distressed watershed” is a watershed which has its aquatic life and health that is
impaired by nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from agricultural land uses, including land
application [32, 33]. Threats to public health, drinking water supplies, recreation, and
public safety are also taken into consideration when and if a watershed is designated as a
distressed watershed.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has developed the following designation criteria for
a distressed watershed: (a) nutrient impacts from agricultural sources, (b) threats to public
health, (c) periodic evidence of algal or cyano-bacterial blooms capable of producing toxins,
(d) contaminants in public or private water supplies; (e) contaminants in recreational water,
(e) contaminants in recreational water, and (f) nuisances impacting aquatic life.
Under the Massachusetts Distressed Watershed Rules, the land application operations and
other concerned operators must prepare their nutrient management plans and submit them to
the Massachusetts government (SWCD or ODNR) for review and approval. The plans must
include soil and residuals analysis, be updated minimum of every 3 years, and validate
120 days of storage. Any new operation (including land application) must have plan approval
prior to construction.
In summation, both the Watershed Protection Act and the Distressed Watershed Rules of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are important to protection of the state’s watershed from
contamination by land application of manure and other similar operations. The state govern-
ment may thereby set speciﬁc requirements for the storage, handling and land application of
manure, and also require nutrient management plans for land and operations within the
designated watershed boundaries.
GLOSSARY OF LAND APPLICATION AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION TERMS
Agricultural land Land on which a food, feed, or ﬁber crop is grown. This includes range land or land
used as pasture.
Agronomic rate The whole sludge application rate designed to (a) provide the amount of nitrogen
needed by a crop or vegetation grown on the land and (b) minimize the amount of nitrogen in the
sewage sludge that passes below the root zone of the crop or vegetation grown on the land to
the ground water.
Annual pollutant loading rate (APLR) The maximum amount of a pollutant that can be applied to a
unit area of land during a 365-day period. This term describes pollutant limits for sewage sludge that
is given away or sold in a bag or other container for application to the land.
Annual whole sludge application rate The maximum amount of sewage sludge on a dry weight basis
that can be applied to a land application site during a 365-day (1-year) period.
Area of cropland An area of cropland that has been subdivided into several strips is not a single ﬁeld.
Rather, each strip represents an individual ﬁeld unit.
Bagged sewage sludge Sewage sludge that is sold or given away in a bag or other container
(i.e., either an open or closed receptacle containing 1 mT or less of sewage sludge).
634
L.K. Wang et al.

Best management practice (BMP) A method that has been determined to be the most effective,
practical means of preventing or reducing pollution from nonpoint and point sources.
Biosolids Biosolids are solids, semisolids or liquid materials, resulting from biological treatment of
domestic sewage that has been sufﬁciently processed to permit these materials to be safely land-
applied. The term of biosolids was introduced by the wastewater treatment industry in the early
1990s and has been recently adopted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to
distinguish high-quality, treated sewage sludge from raw sewage sludge and from sewage sludge
containing large amounts of pollutants.
Bulk sewage sludge Sewage sludge that is not sold or given away in a bag or other container for
application to the land.
Ceiling concentration limits (CCL) The ceiling concentration limits are the maximum concentra-
tions of the nine trace elements allowed in biosolids to be land-applied. Sewage sludge exceeding
the ceiling concentration limit for even one of the regulated pollutants is not classiﬁed as biosolids
and, hence, cannot be land-applied.
Class I sludge management facility Publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) required to have an
approved pretreatment program under 40 CFR 403.8(a), including any POTW located in a state that
has elected to assume local pretreatment program responsibilities under 40 CFR 403.10(e). In
addition, the Regional Administrator or, in the case of approved state programs, the Regional
Administrator in conjunction with the state director, has the discretion to designate any treatment
works treating domestic sewage (TWTDS) as a Class I sludge management facility.
Crop group Individual farm ﬁelds that are managed in the same manner, with the similar yield goals,
are called a crop group.
Crop management The management involves crop group identiﬁcation, crop nitrogen deﬁcit deter-
mination, crop nitrogen fertilizer rate calculation, and crop yield optimization.
Crop nitrogen deﬁcit (CND) Crop nitrogen deﬁcit (CND) equals to anticipated crop nitrogen
fertilizer rate (CNFR) minus all past PAN sources (PAN-past) and current planned non-biosolids
PAN sources (PAN-plan), in the unit of lb N/acre. Previous biosolids carryover nitrogen is included
in this calculation.
Crop nitrogen fertilizer rate (CNFR) CNFR is a rate (lb N/acre) ¼ (yield) (UNFR), where UNFR is
the unit nitrogen fertilizer rate (lb N/unit crop yield) and yield is the crop harvested, or crop yield
(bu/acre or ton/acre).
Crop year The basic time management unit is often called the crop year or planting season. The crop
year is deﬁned as the year in which a crop receiving the biosolids treatment is harvested. For
example, fall applications of biosolids in 2000 intended to provide nutrients for a crop to be
harvested in 2001 are earmarked for crop year 2001. Likewise, biosolids applied immediately
prior to planting winter wheat in October 2000 should be identiﬁed as fertilizer intended for crop
year 2001 because the wheat will be harvested in the summer of 2001.
Crop yield It is the crop harvested in the unit of bu/acre or ton/acre.
Cumulative pollutant loading rate (CPLR) CPLR equals to the total amount of pollutant that can be
applied to a site in its lifetime by all bulk biosolids applications meeting CCL. It is the maximum
amount of an inorganic pollutant that can be applied to an area of land. This term applies to bulk
sewage sludge that is land-applied.
Designated use Simple narrative description of water quality expectations or water quality goals. A
designated use is a legally recognized description of a desired use of the waterbody, such as
(a) support of communities of aquatic life, (b) body contact recreation, (c) ﬁsh consumption, and
(d) public drinking water supply. These are uses that the state or authorized tribe wants the
Land Application for Watershed Protection

waterbody to be healthy enough to fully support. The US Clean Water Act requires that waterbodies
attain or maintain the water quality needed to support designated uses.
Distressed watershed It is a watershed which has aquatic life and health that is impaired by nutrients
(nitrogen and phosphorus) from agricultural land uses, such as land application. Threats to public
health, drinking water supplies, recreation, and public safety are also taken into consideration if a
watershed is designated as a distressed watershed.
Domestic septage Either a liquid or solid material removed from a septic tank, cesspool, portable
toilet, type III marine sanitation device, or similar treatment works that receives only domestic
sewage. This does not include septage resulting from treatment of wastewater with a commercial or
industrial component.
Eutrophication Enrichment of an aquatic ecosystem with nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) that
accelerate biological productivity (growth of algae and weeds) and an undesirable accumulation
of algal biomass.
Exceptional quality sewage sludge Sewage sludge that meets the most stringent limits for the three
sludge quality parameters. In gauging sewage sludge quality, US EPA determined that three main
parameters of concern should be considered as the following: (a) pollutant levels, (b) the relative
presence or absence of pathogenic organisms, such as Salmonella and E. coli bacteria, enteric
viruses, or viable helminth ova, and (c) the degree of attractiveness of the sewage sludge to vectors,
such as ﬂies, rats, and mosquitoes, that could potentially come in contact with pathogenic organisms
and spread disease. Given these three variables, there can be a number of possible sewage sludge
qualities. The term Exceptional Quality (EQ), which does not appear in the Part 503 regulation, is
used to describe sewage sludge that meets the highest quality for all three of these sewage sludge
quality parameters (i.e., ceiling concentrations and pollutant concentrations in 503.13 for metals,
one of the Class A pathogen reduction alternatives, and one of the sewage sludge processing vector
attraction reduction options 1 through 8).
Farm ﬁeld The farm ﬁeld is the basic management unit used for all farm nutrient management, as
deﬁned as “the fundamental unit used for cropping agricultural products.”
Feed crop Crops produced primarily for consumption by animals. These include, but are not limited
to, corn and grass. For a crop to be considered a feed crop, it has to be produced for consumption by
animals (e.g., grass grown to prevent erosion or to stabilize an area is not considered a feed crop).
Fiber crop Crops, such as ﬂax and cotton, that were included in Part 503 because products from these
crops (e.g., cotton seed oil) may be consumed by humans.
Food crop Crops consumed by humans. These include, but are not limited to, fruits, grains, vegeta-
bles, and tobacco.
Forest land Tract of land thick with trees and underbrush.
Heavy metals Trace elements are found in low concentrations in biosolids. The trace elements of
interest in biosolids are those commonly referred to as “heavy metals.” Some of these trace
elements (e.g., copper, molybdenum, and zinc) are nutrients needed for plant growth in low
concentrations, but all of these elements can be toxic to humans, animals, or plants at high
concentrations. Possible hazards associated with a buildup of trace elements in the soil include
their potential to cause phytotoxicity (i.e., injury to plants) or to increase the concentration of
potentially hazardous substances in the food chain. Federal and state regulations have established
standards for the following eight heavy metals: arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead
(Pb), mercury (Hg), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn), plus selenium (Se), which is
not legally listed as a heavy metal.

L.K. Wang et al.

Impaired waterbody A waterbody that does not meet the criteria that support its designated use.
Indicator organism An indicator organism (e.g. fecal coliform) is a nonpathogenic organism whose
presence implies the presence of pathogenic organisms. Indicator organisms are selected to be
conservative estimates of the potential for pathogenicity.
Individual ﬁeld unit An area of cropland that has been subdivided into several strips is not a single
ﬁeld. Rather, each strip represents an individual ﬁeld unit.
Impaired waterbody A waterbody that does not meet the criteria that support its designated use.
Land application Land application is deﬁned as the spreading, spraying, injection, or incorporation
of liquid or semiliquid organic substances, such as sewage sludge, biosolids, livestock manure,
compost, septage, legumes, and other types of liquid organic waste, onto or below the surface of the
land to take advantage of the soil-enhancing qualities of the organic substances. These organic
substances are land-applied to improve the structure of the soil. It is also applied as a fertilizer to
supply nutrients to crops and other vegetation grown in the soil. The liquid or semiliquid organic
substances are commonly applied to agricultural land (including pasture and range land), forests,
reclamation sites, public contact sites (e.g., parks, turf farms, highway median strips, golf courses),
lawns, and home gardens.
Land application site An area of land on which sewage sludge is applied to condition the soil or to
fertilize crops or vegetation grown in the soil.
Manure Any wastes discharged from livestock.
Mesotrophic The term describes reservoirs and lakes that contain moderate quantities of nutrients and
are moderately productive in terms of aquatic animal and plant life.
Mineralization Most nitrogen exists in biosolids as organic-N, principally contained in proteins,
nucleic acids, amines, and other cellular material. These complex molecules must be broken apart
through biological degradation for nitrogen to become available to crops. The conversion of
organic-N to inorganic-N forms is called mineralization.
Narrative criteria Nonnumeric descriptions of desirable or undesirable water quality conditions.
Nonpoint source Diffuse pollution source; a source without a single point of origin or not introduced
into a receiving stream from a speciﬁc outlet. The pollutants are generally carried off the land by
storm water. Common nonpoint sources are agriculture, forestry, urban areas, mining, construction,
dams, channels, land disposal, saltwater intrusion, and city streets.
Numeric criteria Numeric descriptions of desirable or undesirable water quality conditions.
Nutrients Nutrients are elements required for plant growth that provide biosolids with most of their
economic value. These include nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), mag-
nesium (Mg), sodium (Na), sulfur (S), boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn),
molybdenum (Mo), and zinc (Zn).
Pasture Land on which animals feed directly on feed crops such as legumes, grasses, or grain stubble.
Pathogens Pathogens are disease-causing microorganisms that include bacteria, viruses, protozoa,
and parasitic worms. Pathogens can present a public health hazard if they are transferred to food
crops grown on land to which biosolids are applied; contained in runoff to surface waters from land
application sites; or transported away from the site by vectors such as insects, rodents, and birds.
pH pH is a measure of the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a substance. The pH of biosolids is often
raised with alkaline materials to reduce pathogen content and attraction of disease-spreading
organisms (vectors). High pH (greater than 11) kills virtually all pathogens and reduces the
solubility, biological availability, and mobility of most metals. Lime also increases the gaseous
loss (volatilization) of the ammonia form of nitrogen (ammonia-N), thus reducing the N-fertilizer
value of biosolids.
Land Application for Watershed Protection
637

Plant-available nitrogen (PAN) Only a portion of the total nitrogen present in biosolids is available
for plant uptake. This plant-available nitrogen (PAN) is the actual amount of N in the biosolids/
manure that is available to crops during a speciﬁed period.
Planting and harvesting periods The cycle of crop planting and harvesting periods, not the calendar
year, dictates the timing of biosolids and manure land application activities. Winter wheat and
perennial forage grasses are examples of crops that may be established and harvested in different
calendar years.
Planting season The basic time management unit is often called the crop year or planting season. The
crop year is deﬁned as the year in which a crop receiving the biosolids treatment is harvested.
Point source A stationary location or ﬁxed facility from which pollutants are discharged; any single
identiﬁable source of pollution, such as a pipe, ditch, ship, ore pit, or factory smokestack.
Pollutant A contaminant in a concentration or amount that adversely alters the physical, chemical, or
biological properties of the natural environment.
Pollutant concentration limits (PCL) Pollutant concentration limits are the maximum concentra-
tions of heavy metals for biosolids whose trace element pollutant additions do not require tracking
(i.e., calculation of CPLR (cumulative pollutant loading rate). PCL are the most stringent pollutant
limits included in US Federal Regulation Part 503 for land application. Biosolids meeting pollutant
concentration limits are subject to fewer requirements than biosolids meeting ceiling concentration
limits.
Preparer Either the person who generates sewage sludge during the treatment of domestic sewage in
a treatment works or the person who derives a material from sewage sludge.
Public contact site Land with a high potential for contact by the public, including public parks, ball
ﬁelds, cemeteries, nurseries, turf farms, and golf courses.
Range land Open land with indigenous vegetation.
Reclamation site Drastically disturbed lands, such as strip mines and construction sites, that can be
reclaimed using biosolids.
Septage Septage means the liquid and solid material pumped from a septic tank, cesspool, or similar
domestic sewage treatment system, or holding tank when the system is cleaned or maintained.
Sewage sludge The solid, semisolid, or liquid residue generated during the treatment of domestic
sewage in a treatment works. Sewage sludge includes, but is not limited to, domestic septage, scum,
and solids removed during primary, secondary, or advanced wastewater treatment processes. The
deﬁnition of sewage sludge also includes a material derived from sewage sludge (i.e., sewage sludge
whose quality is changed either through further treatment or through mixing with other materials).
Stakeholder Individual or organization that has a stake in the outcome of the watershed plan.
Threatened waterbody A waterbody that is meeting standards, but exhibits a declining trend in water
quality such that it will likely exceed standards.
Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) TKN is the summation of ammonium nitrogen (NH4
+-N) and
organic nitrogen (organic-N).
Total maximum daily load (TMDL) The amount, or load, of a speciﬁc pollutant that a waterbody
can assimilate and still meet the water quality standard for its designated use. For impaired
waterbodies the TMDL reduces the overall load by allocating the load among current pollutant
loads (from point and nonpoint sources), background or natural loads, a margin of safety, and
sometimes an allocation for future growth.
Total nitrogen It is the summation of ammonium nitrogen (NH4
+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3
-N),
nitrite nitrogen (NO2
-N), and organic nitrogen (organic-N). Usually nitrite nitrogen is in negligi-
ble amount. Crops directly utilize nitrogen in its inorganic forms, principally nitrate-N and ammo-
nium-N.
638
L.K. Wang et al.

Total solids (TS) Total solids (TS) include suspended and dissolved solids and are usually expressed
as the concentration present in biosolids. TS depend on the type of wastewater process and
biosolids’ treatment prior to land application. Typical solids contents of various biosolids are:
liquid (2–12 %), dewatered (12–30 %), and dried or composted (50 %).
Trace elements Trace elements are found in low concentrations in biosolids. The trace elements of
interest in biosolids are nearly all “heavy metals.”
Treatment works Federally owned, publicly owned, or privately owned device or system used to
treat (including recycle or reclaim) either domestic sewage or a combination of domestic sewage
and industrial waste of a liquid nature.
Treatment works treating domestic sewage A POTW or other sewage sludge or wastewater
treatment system or device, regardless of ownership used in the storage, treatment, recycling, and
reclamation of municipal or domestic sewage, including land dedicated for the disposal of sewage
sludge.
Unit nitrogen fertilizer rate (UNFR) UNFR is a rate in lb-N per unit crop yield, where the unit can
either bushel or ton. (Note: 1 bu (US bushel) ¼ 1.2444 ft3; 1 British bushel ¼ 1.2843 ft3; 1 t
(British ton) ¼ 2,000 lbs; and 1 T (metric ton) ¼ 1,000 kg).
Vectors Vectors include rodents, birds, insects that can transport pathogens away from the land
application site.
Vector attraction Characteristics (e. g., odor) that attract birds, insects, and other animals that are
capable of transmitting infectious agents.
Volatilization Ammonium-N in biosolids can be signiﬁcant, making up even half the initial PAN of
biosolids. The ammonium-N of biosolids can vary widely depending on treatment and storage.
Since ammonium-N is prone to volatilization (as ammonia gas, NH3), the application method
affects PAN. For instance, surface-applied biosolids are expected to lose half of their ammonium-
N. Conversely, direct subsurface injection or soil incorporation of biosolids within 24 h minimizes
volatilization losses. The conversion of ammonium-N to ammonia gas form (NH3) is called
volatilization.
Volatile solids (VS) Volatile solids (VS) provide an estimate of the readily decomposable organic
matter in biosolids and are usually expressed as a percentage of total solids. VS are an important
determinant of potential odor problems at land application sites.
Water quality standards Standards that set the goals, pollution limits, and protection requirements
for each waterbody. These standards are composed of designated (beneﬁcial) uses, numeric and
narrative criteria, and anti-degradation policies and procedures.
Watershed A watershed is the area of land where all of the water that is under it or drains off of it goes
into the same place, land area that drains to a common waterway, such as a stream, lake, estuary,
wetland, or ultimately the ocean.
Watershed approach A ﬂexible framework for managing water resource quality and quantity within
speciﬁed drainage area, or watershed. This approach includes stakeholder involvement and man-
agement actions supported by sound science and appropriate technology.
Watershed plan A document that provides assessment and management information for a geograph-
ically deﬁned watershed, including the analyses, actions, participants, and resources related to
development and implementation of the plan.
Yield It is the crop harvested in the unit of bu/acre or ton/acre.

1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the selection of treatment methods for wastewater discharge from both
municipalities and industrial sources has opened for wider options to include natural and
constructed wetlands. The increasing capital and operation costs associated with modern
mechanical treatment processes is a major driving force that calls for rethinking of using
natural system to solve river pollution problems. Constructed wetlands are “designed and
man-made complex of saturated substrates, emergent and submergent vegetation, animal life,
and water that simulates natural wetlands for human use and beneﬁts” [1]. Constructed
wetlands are considered to be a low-cost system for treating wastewater discharged from
municipal, agricultural, and industrial sources. A schematic process ﬂow for a constructed
wetland system is shown in Fig. 13.1 below.
Constructed wetlands represent an emerging eco-technological treatment system, in which
are designed to overcome the disadvantages of natural wetlands. They have the qualities of
reliability, cost-effectiveness, and versatility on top of the conventional engineering mea-
sures. Constructed wetlands have a great potential in treating wastewater as they can tolerate
higher organic loading rate and shorter hydraulic retention time. In addition, they also have
the capability of treating more than one type of pollutants simultaneously to some satisfactory
levels as compared to other conventional treatment systems. Constructed wetlands can be
created from existing marshlands or built at any land with limited alternative uses.

2. WHAT ARE WETLANDS?
2.1. Wetland Deﬁnition
Wetlands are deﬁned by the Convention of wetland of International Importance (the
Ramsar Convention 1971) as: “areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or
artiﬁcial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or ﬂowing, fresh, brackish or salt,
including areas of marine water, the depth of which at low tide does not exceed 6 m. Wetlands
include marshes, swamps, vleis, pans, bogs, ponds, reed beds and estuaries” [2]. Broadly
deﬁned, wetlands are land areas that have a prolonged high water or at least that are covered
with shallow water. As a transition habitat between dry land and a deep water environment,
they support plants that are adapted to grow in wet conditions.
Wetlands are transitional areas between land and water. The boundaries between wetlands
and uplands or deep water are therefore not always distinct. The term “wetlands” encompasses a
broad range of wet environments, including marshes, bogs, swamps, wet meadows, tidal
wetlands, ﬂoodplains, and ribbon (riparian) wetlands along stream channels. All wetlands
(natural or constructed) have one characteristic in common, i.e., the presence of surface or
near-surface water, at least periodically. In most wetlands, hydrological conditions are such that
the substrate is saturated long enough during the growing season to create oxygen-poor condi-
tions in the substrate. The lack of oxygen creates reducing (oxygen-poor) conditions within the
substrate and limits the vegetation to those species that are adapted to low-oxygen environments.
The hydrology of wetlands is generally one of slow ﬂows and either shallow waters or
saturated substrates. The slow ﬂows and shallow water depths allow sediments to settle as the
water passes through the wetland. The slow ﬂows also provide prolonged contact times
between the water, substrates, and the surfaces within the wetland. The complex mass of
organic and inorganic materials and the diverse opportunities for gas/water interchanges
foster a diverse community of microbes that break down or transform a wide variety of
substances. Most wetlands support a dense growth of vascular plants adapted to saturated
conditions. This vegetation slows the water, creates microenvironments within the water
column, and provides attachment sites for the microbial community. The litter that
accumulates as a result of dead plants in the wetland creates additional material and exchange
sites and provides a source of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous to fuel microbial processes.
2.2. Wetland Functions and Values
Wetland functions are the inherent processes occurring in wetlands; wetland values are the
attributes of wetlands that society perceives as beneﬁcial. The many values that wetlands provide
result from their functions (hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological). Hydrological func-
tions may include ﬂoodwater retention, groundwater recharge and discharge, and sediment
retention. Biogeochemical functions may include nutrient retention/removal and in situ carbon
retention. Ecological functions may also include ecosystem maintenance and food web support.
Here a function can be deﬁned as an activity that results from the interactions that occur
between natural processes (physical, chemical, and biological) and the structural components
such as geomorphology, hydrology, soil, ﬂora, fauna, and microbes of the ecosystems.

Under appropriate circumstances, constructed wetlands can provide extremely effective
water quality improvement, ﬂood storage, and the desynchronization of storm; rainfall and
surface runoff; cycling of nutrients and other materials; habitat for ﬁsh and wildlife; passive
recreation, such as bird watching and photography; and active recreation, such as hunting,
education and research, aesthetics, and landscape enhancement [3]. Figure 13.2 shows the
interrelationship between wetland functions and values.
3. NATURAL WETLANDS
Natural wetlands are sometimes called swamps, marshes, bogs, fens, wet meadows, or
sloughs. Natural wetland deﬁnitions are not necessarily the same. Plant types and species,
water, and geographic conditions vary, creating different kinds of wetlands in many
different countries.
The 1977 Clean Water Act Amendments provide a broad deﬁnition of wetlands: “The term
‘wetlands’ means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a

frequency and duration sufﬁcient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support,
a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands
generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.”
Wetlands are natural receptacles. Occurring in low-lying areas, wetlands receive runoff
water and overﬂow from rivers and streams. In response, various wetland biological mech-
anisms or processes evolved over geological time to treat inﬂows. These mechanisms trap
sediments and break down a wide range of pollutants into elemental compounds. Wetlands
have a natural, innate ability to treat wastewater. Water moves slowly through wetlands, as
shallow ﬂows, saturated substrates, or both. Slow ﬂows and shallow waters cause sediments
to settle. The slow ﬂows also act to prolong contact times between the water and surfaces
within the wetland.
The organic and inorganic materials within a wetland form a complex mass. This mass
along with the occurrence of gas/water interchanges promotes a varied community of
microorganisms to break down or transform a wide variety of substances. Dense growths of
vascular plants adapted to saturated conditions often thrive in wetlands and contribute to its
treatment capacity. Along with slowing the ﬂow of water, the vegetation creates microenvi-
ronments and provides the microbial community enormous attachment sites. Furthermore,
plants die in some seasons and tend to accumulate as litter. This phenomena creates additional
material and exchange sites as well as providing a source of carbon, nitrogen, and phospho-
rous to fuel microbial processes.
4. CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS
The role of wetland in water resource management is fast gaining ground resulting in the
construction wetland in most developed countries. This trend has evolved because wetlands
have been added to wastewater facilities that provide only basic levels of primary or
secondary treatment. Because of the potential for creating nuisance conditions in wetlands
that receive poor quality wastewater, the European design preference has been to use
subsurface ﬂow through soil or sand planted with common reed.
Constructed wetlands are man-made system that involves altering the existing terrain to
simulate wetland conditions. They primarily attempt to replicate the treatment that has been
observed to occur when polluted water enters the natural wetland. These wetlands have been
seen to purify water by removing organic compounds and oxidizing ammonia, reducing
nitrates, and removing phosphorus. The mechanisms are complex and involve bacterial
oxidation, ﬁltration, sedimentation, and chemical precipitation.
Most constructed wetlands attempt to imitate the ecosystem’s biochemical function as
ﬁltration and cleansing agents, followed closely by the hydrological function that is centered
on ﬂood mitigation. These constructed wastewater treatments may include swamps and
marshes. Most of the constructed wetland systems are marshes. Marshes are shallow water
regions dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation including cattails, bulrush, reeds,
rushes, and sedges.

4.1. Components of Constructed Wetlands
A constructed wetland consists of a properly designed basin that contains water, a sub-
strate, and, most commonly, macrophyte vegetation. These components can be manipulated
in constructing a wetland. Other important components of wetlands, such as the communities
of microbes and aquatic invertebrates, develop naturally. The essential components of both a
natural wetland and a constructed wetland are shown in Fig. 13.3.
4.2. Advantages of Constructed Wetlands for Wastewater Treatment
Constructed wetland is a cheaper alternative for wastewater treatment using locally
available resources. Aesthetically, it is a presentable, scenic, and more landscaped looking
wetland site compared to the conventional wastewater treatment plants. This promotes
sustainable use of local aquatic plants, which is a more environment friendly biological
wastewater treatment system.
Constructed wetlands can be created at lower costs than other treatment options, with
low-technology methods where no new or complex technological tools are needed (essen-
tially grading, dike construction, and vegetation planting). Properly designed and construction
systems do not require chemical additions and other procedures used in the conventional
treatment systems [5]. The system relies on renewable energy sources such as solar and
kinetic energy and wetland plants and microorganisms, which are the active agents in the
treatment processes.
The system can tolerate both large and small volumes of water with varying contaminant
levels. These include municipal and domestic wastewater, urban storm runoff, agricultural
wastewater, industrial efﬂuents, and polluted surface waters in rivers and lakes. The system
could be promoted to various potential users for water quality improvement and pollutant
removal. These potential users include the tourism industry, governmental departments,
private entrepreneurs, private residences, aquaculture industries, and agro-industries.
Utilization of local products and labor helps to reduce the operation and maintenance costs
of a treatment system. Less energy and raw materials are needed, with periodic on-site labor,
rather than continuous full-time attention. This system indirectly will contribute greatly in the
reduction of use of natural resources in conventional treatment plants, and wastewater

discharges to natural waterways are also reduced. The constructed wetland system also could
be used to clean polluted rivers and other water bodies. This derived technology can
eventually be used to rehabilitate grossly polluted rivers in the country. The constructed
wetland treatment system is widely applied for various functions. These functions include
primary settled and secondary treated sewage treatment, tertiary efﬂuent polishing and
disinfecting, urban and rural runoff management, toxicant management, landﬁll and mining
leachate treatment, sludge management, industrial efﬂuent treatment, enhancement of
in-stream nutrient assimilation, nutrient removal via biomass production and export, and
groundwater recharge.
The primary purpose of constructed wetland treatment systems is to treat various kinds of
wastewater (municipal, industrial, agricultural, and stormwater). However, the system usually
serves other purposes as well. A wetland can serve as a wildlife sanctuary and provide a
habitat for wetland animals. The wetland system can also be aesthetically pleasing and serve
as an attractive destination for tourists and local urban dwellers. It can also serve as a public
attraction sanctuary for visitors to explore its environmental and educational possibilities. It
appeals to different groups varying from engineers to those involved in wastewater facilities
as well as environmentalists and people concerned with recreation. This constructed wetland
treatment system also provides a research and training ground for young scientists in this new
research and education arena.
4.3. Types of Constructed Wetlands
Constructed wetland systems are classiﬁed into two general types: the horizontal ﬂow
system (HFS) and the vertical ﬂow system (VFS). HFS has two general types: surface ﬂow
(SF) and subsurface ﬂow (SSF) systems. It is called HFS because wastewater is fed at the inlet
and ﬂows horizontally through the bed to the outlet. VFS are fed intermittently and drains
vertically through the bed via a network of drainage pipes.
4.3.1. Surface Flow (SF) System
The use of SF systems is extensive in North America, whereby more than 200 constructed
wetlands are in operation. These systems are used mainly for municipal wastewater treatment
with large wastewater ﬂows for nutrient polishing. The SF system tends to be rather large in
size with only a few smaller systems in use. The majority of constructed wetland treatment
systems are surface ﬂow (SF) or free water surface (FWS) systems. These types utilize
inﬂuent waters that ﬂow across a basin or a channel that supports a variety of vegetation,
and water is visible at a relatively shallow depth above the surface of the substrate materials.
Substrates are generally native soils or other suitable medium to support emergent vegetation
and clay or impervious geotechnical materials that prevent seepage. Typical emergent plants
that are found in surface ﬂow wetlands are cattails (Typha spp.), bulrushes (Scirpus spp.), and
various sedges (Carex spp.). The shallow water depth with low ﬂow velocity of water and
presence of plants help to regulate ﬂow, especially in a long narrow channel to ensure plug-
ﬂow conditions are met. Typically, bed depth of wetland is about 0.3–0.4 m. Figure 13.4
below shows a proﬁle of a three-zone SF constructed wetland cell.
650
A. Idris et al.

4.3.2. Subsurface Flow (SSF) System
The SSF system includes soil-based technology which is predominantly used in Europe,
with more than 500 wetlands that are operational, and the vegetated gravel beds are found in
Europe, Australia, South Africa, and almost all over the world. In a vegetated subsurface ﬂow
(SSF) system, water ﬂows from one end to the other end through permeable substrates which
are made of mixture of soil and gravel or crusher rock. The substrate will support the growth
of rooted emergent vegetation. It is also called “root-zone method” (RZM) or “rock-reed
ﬁlter” (RRF) or “emergent vegetation bed system” or “vegetated submerged bed” (VSB). The
media depth is about 0.6 m deep and the bottom is a clay layer to prevent seepage. Media size
for most gravel substrate ranged from 5 to 230 mm with 13–76 mm being typical. The bottom
of the bed is sloped to minimize water that ﬂows overland. Wastewater ﬂows by gravity
horizontally through the root zone of the vegetation about 100–150 mm below the gravel
surface. Many macro and microorganisms inhabit the substrates. Free water is not visible. The
inlet zone has a buried perforated pipe to distribute maximum ﬂow horizontally through the
treatment zone. Treated water is collected at outlets at the base of the media, typically
0.3–0.6 m below bed surface. In both systems, the ﬂow of wastewater is maintained approx-
imately 0.15–0.3 m below the bed surface [2]. Figure 13.5 shows a typical subsurface ﬂow
wetland system.

5. MECHANISMS OF TREATMENT PROCESSES
FOR CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS
An understanding of the treatment mechanisms is necessary to ensure that constructed
wetlands are designed effectively with improved treatment performances. Wetlands have
been found to be effective in treating BOD, SS, N, and P as well as for reducing metals,
organic pollutants, and pathogens. The principal pollutant removal mechanisms in
constructed wetlands include biological processes such as microbial metabolic activity and
plant uptake as well as physicochemical processes such as sedimentation, adsorption, and
precipitation at the water-sediment, root-sediment, and plant–water interfaces [8]. Table 13.1
shows the summary of removal mechanisms in a constructed wetland.
5.1. Biodegradable Organic Matter Removal Mechanism
Microbial degradationplays a dominant role in theremoval ofsoluble/colloidal biodegradable
organic matter (BOD) in wastewater. Biodegradation occurs when dissolved organic matter is
carried into the bioﬁlms that attached on submerged plant stems, root systems, and surrounding
soil or media by diffusion process. Wetland plants provide support medium for microbial
degradation to take place and convey oxygen to the rhizosphere for aerobic degradation to occur.

Organic matter contains approximately 45–50 % carbon (C), which is utilized by a wide
array of microorganisms as a source of energy. A large number of these microorganisms
consume oxygen (O2) to break down organic C to carbon dioxide (CO2), a process that
provides energy for growth. Therefore, the release of excessive amounts of organic C to
surface waters can result in a signiﬁcant depletion of O2 and subsequent mortality of ﬁsh and
other O2-dependent aquatic organisms.
Wetlands contain vast numbers of organic C-utilizing microorganisms adapted to the
aerobic (O2-rich) surface waters and anaerobic (O2-depleted) soils at the bottom. Thus,
wetlands are capable of highly effective removal of organic compounds from a variety of
wastewaters. Organic C in wetlands is broken down to CO2 and methane (CH4), both of which
are lost to the atmosphere. Wetlands also store and recycle copious amounts of organic C,
contained in plants and animals, dead plant material (litter), microorganisms, and peat.
Therefore, wetlands tend to be natural exporters of organic C as a result of decomposition
of organic matter into ﬁne particulate matter and dissolved compounds.
The more readily degradable organic C compounds typically found in municipal wastewater
can be rapidly removed in wetlands. Biological removal of a variety of recalcitrant (not readily
decomposed) organic C compounds, including lignin-based compounds and petroleum prod-
ucts, can also be achieved in wetlands, although removal rates may be substantially lower.
5.2. Suspended Solids Removal Mechanism
Settleable solids are removed easily by gravitational settlement since wetlands system
generally have long hydraulic retention times. On the other hand, non-settling or colloidal
solids are removed via processes such as ﬁltration, adsorption on plants and wetlands media,
and biodegradation. The types of removal mechanism at work are very dependent on the size
and nature of solids present in the wastewater and type of ﬁlter media being used. In most
cases, wetland plants have insigniﬁcant impact on the removal of suspended solids.
5.3. Nitrogen Removal Mechanism
Nitrogen (N) can exist in various forms, namely, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3 and NH4
+),
organic nitrogen, and oxidized nitrogen (NO2
 and NO3
). The removal of nitrogen is achieved
through three main mechanisms: nitriﬁcation/denitriﬁcation, volatilization of ammonia (NH3),
and uptake by wetland plants. A majority of nitrogen removal occurs through either plant uptake
or denitriﬁcation. Nitrogen uptake is signiﬁcant if plants are harvested and biomass is removed
from the system. At the root–soil interface, atmospheric oxygen diffuses into the rhizosphere
through the leaves, stems, rhizomes, and roots of the wetland plants, thus creating an aerobic
layer similar to those that exist in the media-water or media-air interface. Nitrogen transforma-
tion takes place in the oxidized and reduced layers of media, the root media interface, and
belowground portion of the emergent plants. Ammoniﬁcation takes place where organic
nitrogen is mineralized to NH4
+-N in both oxidized and reduced layers. The oxidized layer
and the submerged portions of plants are important sites for nitriﬁcation in which ammoniacal
nitrogen (AN) is converted to nitrites N (NO2
) by the Nitrosomonas bacteria and eventually to
nitrates N (NO3
) by the Nitrobacter bacteria. At higher pH of 10, some AN, which exist in
form of NH3, will be lost to the atmosphere by volatilization process.
Wetlands for Wastewater Treatment
653

Nitrate in the reduced zone is removed through denitriﬁcation, leaching, and some plant
uptake. However, it is replenished by NO3
 from the oxidized zone by diffusion. At the
root–soil interface, atmospheric oxygen diffuses into rhizosphere through the leaves, stems,
rhizomes, and roots of the wetland plants thus creating an aerobic layer that is similar to that
existed at the media–water or media–air interface. Nitriﬁcation process occurs in the aerobic
rhizosphere where AN is oxidized to NO3
 which is either taken up by the plants or diffuses
into the reduced zone where it is converted to N2 and N2O by the denitriﬁcation process.
Nitrate removal efﬁciency typically is extremely high in wetlands. The biological process
of denitriﬁcation, i.e., conversion of nitrate to nitrogen gas, provides a means for complete
removal of inorganic N from wetlands, as opposed to storage within the vegetation or soil.
Denitriﬁcation usually accounts for the bulk of the inorganic N removal in wetlands.
5.4. Heavy Metals Removal Mechanism
Wetlands soils are potentially effective traps, or sinks for metals, due to the relative
immobility of most metals in wetland soils. Aquatic macrophytes remove heavy metals by
absorption into living tissue. Decomposing plant litter also contributes to heavy metals
removal by adsorption. Precipitation as metal hydroxides in the aerobic zones and as metal
sulﬁdes in the anaerobic zones. Cation exchange may involve binding of positively charged
metal ions in solution to negatively charged sites on the surface of the particulates.
A signiﬁcant clay content may also enhance the potential for metal removal. Heavy metals
are removed as insoluble sulﬁdes formed during the anaerobic decomposition of dead
vegetation. Complexation or chelation with organic materials and media material is also a
possible pathway. Heavy metals are also reduced through direct uptake by wetland plants.
However, overaccumulation may kill the plants.
Data on wetland performance for metals removal are relatively sparse. Based on a limited
data set for treatment wetlands, metals removal efﬁciency is potentially very high, but also
highly variable among sites.
5.5. Pathogenic Bacteria and Viruses Removal Mechanism
Pathogenic bacteria and viruses are removed mainly by sedimentation, ﬁltration, and absorp-
tion by biomass and by natural die-off due to prolonged exposure to unfavorable environmental
conditions such as temperature, pH, solar radiation, nutrient starvation, and predation.
5.6. Other Pollutants Removal Mechanism
Evapotranspiration is one of the mechanisms for pollutant removal. Atmospheric water
losses from a wetland that occur from the water and soil are termed as evaporation and from
emergent portions of plants are termed as transpiration. The combination of both processes is
termed as evapotranspiration. Daily transpiration is positively related to mineral adsorption,
and daily transpiration could be used as an index of the water puriﬁcation capability of plants.
Precipitation and evapotranspiration inﬂuence the water ﬂow through a wetland system.
Evapotranspiration slows water ﬂow and increases contact times, whereas rainfall, which
has the opposite effect, will cause dilution and increased ﬂow. Precipitation and evaporation
654
A. Idris et al.

are likely to have minimal effects on constructed wetlands in most areas. If the wetland type is
primarily shallow open water, precipitation/evaporation ratios fairly approximate water
balances. However, in large, dense stands of tall plants, transpiration losses from photosyn-
thetically active plants become signiﬁcant.
6. SELECTION OF WETLAND PLANT
6.1. Function of Wetland Plants
In general, the most signiﬁcant functions of wetland plants (emergents) in relation to water
puriﬁcation are the physical effects brought by the presence of the plants. The plants provide a
huge surface area for attachment and growth of microbes. The physical components of the
plants stabilize the surface of the beds and slow down the water ﬂow, thus assisting in
sediment settling and trapping process and ﬁnally increasing water transparency. Wetland
plants play a vital role in the removal and retention of nutrients and help in preventing the
eutrophication of wetlands. A range of wetland plants has shown their ability to assist in
the breakdown of wastewater. The common reed (Phragmites spp.) and cattail (Typha spp.)
are good examples of marsh species that can effectively uptake nutrients. These plants have a
large biomass both above (leaves) and below (underground stem and roots) the surface of the
substrate. The subsurface plant tissues grow horizontally and vertically and create an exten-
sive matrix, which binds the soil.
This accumulation of particles enables the creation of a large surface area for the uptake of
nutrients and ions. Hollow vessels in the plant tissues enable oxygen to be transported from
the leaves to the root zone and to the surrounding soil [9, 10]. This enables the active
microbial aerobic decomposition process and the uptake of pollutants from the water system
to take place. Some speciﬁc functions of wetland plants are summarized in Table 13.2.
6.2. Roles of Wetland Plants
The roles of wetland plants in constructed wetland systems can be classiﬁed into six
categories as follows:
Table 13.2
Functions of wetland plants [7]

of plants
Wetlands for Wastewater Treatment
655

6.2.1. Physical
Macrophytes stabilize the surface of plant beds, provide good conditions for physical
ﬁltration, and provide a large surface area for attached microbial growth. Growth of macro-
phytes reduces current velocity, allowing for sedimentation and increase in contact time
between efﬂuent and plant surface area, thus to an increase in the removal of nitrogen.
6.2.2. Soil Hydraulic Conductivity
Soil hydraulic conductivity is improved in an emergent plant bed system. Turnover of root
mass creates macropores in a constructed wetland soil system allowing for greater percolation
of water, thus increasing efﬂuent/plant interactions.
6.2.3. Organic Compound Release
Plants have been shown to release a wide variety of organic compounds through their root
systems, at rates up to 25 % of the total photosynthetically ﬁxed carbon. This carbon release
may act as a source of food for denitrifying microbes [11]. Decomposing plant biomass also
provides a durable, readily available carbon source for the microbial populations.
6.2.4. Microbial Growth
Macrophytes have above- and belowground biomass to provide a large surface area for
growth of microbial bioﬁlms. These bioﬁlms are responsible for a majority of the microbial
processes in a constructed wetland system, including nitrogen reduction [11].
6.2.5. Creation of Aerobic Soils
Macrophytes mediate transfer of oxygen through the hollow plant tissue and leakage from
root systems to the rhizosphere where aerobic degradation of organic matter and nitriﬁcation
will take place. Wetland plants have adaptations with suberized and ligniﬁed layers in the
hypodermis and outer cortex to minimize the rate of oxygen leakage.
6.2.6. Aesthetic Values
The macrophytes have additional site-speciﬁc values by providing habitat for wildlife and
making wastewater treatment systems aesthetically pleasing.
6.3. Types of Wetland Plants
Wetland plants can be classiﬁed into three broad types. These broad types are:
Floating—these are plants that are free ﬂoating and not attached to any substrate.
Submerged—these are plants that are attached to the substrate or free ﬂoating but whose leaves and
stems are permanently submerged. It includes plants whose ﬂowers may be emergent.
Emergent—these are plants that are attached to the substrate and whose leaves and stems either ﬂoat on
the surface or protrude above the surface. It includes plants that are periodically or seasonally as
well as permanently inundated.
Each of these types of plants has a different role to play in constructed wetlands and will
produce different micro habitats. Use of the different types of plants leads to diversity within
656
A. Idris et al.

the wetland which results in a more biodiversity, better functioning, and a more stable
wetland. Figure 13.6 illustrates the different types of wetland plants.
6.4. Selection of Wetland Plants
In selecting plants for use in a constructed wetland, it is necessary to consider the factors
that affect their natural distribution both within the state and locally, as these will have a major
impact on the success of the plants that are used for wetland planting. Table 13.3 shows the
characteristics of plants for constructed wetlands.
When selecting plants for constructed wetlands, it is necessary to consider the following
factors:
The species available or suitable for the proposed wetland site
The substrate on which the plants will prefer to grow (e.g., sand, mud, clay, peat)
Aerobic versus anaerobic conditions and when and where this is likely to occur within the wetland
The depth of water where the plants normally grow, e.g., shallow or deep water
The frequency and depth of inundation
Periods of drying and the ability of the plants to withstand drying
The pH of the water and its likely variance over time
The local climate including the length and nature of the growing season
Other important factors that need to be taken into consideration may include:
Containment, especially for free-ﬂoating species
Potential interaction with animals and their likely destruction by animals, e.g., as nest sites
Potential weediness of the species selected both within and also outside the wetland
Another factor to consider is the nature of the plants and their growth habits, e.g., free ﬂoating,
bottom anchored, upright, spreading, or creeping. These different plant types can have an
impact on the amount of shading of the wetland, and this can be important in algal control.
In addition, the different sorts of plants provide different habitats for the various microﬂora

and microfauna that will live in the wetlands. Not all wetland species are suitable for
wastewater treatment since plants for treatment wetlands must be able to tolerate the combi-
nation of continuous ﬂooding and exposure to wastewater or stormwater containing relatively
high and often variable concentrations of pollutants.
Floating and submerged plants are used in an aquatic plant treatment system. A range of
aquatic plants have shown their ability to assist in the breakdown of wastewater. The water
hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and duckweed (Lemna) are common ﬂoating aquatic plants
which have shown their ability to reduce concentrations of BOD, TSS, and total phosphorus
and total nitrogen. Figure 13.7 shows some examples of common ﬂoating plants.
The common reed (Phragmites spp.) and cattail (Typha spp.) are good examples of
emergent species used in constructed wetland treatment systems. Plant selection is quite
similar for SF and SSF constructed wetlands. Emergent wetland plants grow best in both
systems. These emergent plants play a vital role in the removal and retention of nutrients in a
constructed wetland. Although emergent macrophytes are less efﬁcient at lowering nitrogen
and phosphorus contents by direct uptake due to their lower growth rates (compared to
ﬂoating and submerged plants), their ability to uptake nitrogen and phosphorus from sediment
sources through rhizomes is higher than from the water. Figure 13.8 shows some examples of
common emergent plants.

Only selected species of wetland plants are chosen by wetland designers; the species must
have a rapid and relatively constant growth rate. In a tropical system, wetland plants have a
higher growth rate. These wetland plants are easily propagated by means of runners and by
bits of mats breaking off and drifting to new areas. This will help in increasing the capacity of
pollutant absorption by the plants. The plants should also be able to tolerate waterlogged-
anoxic and hyper-eutrophic conditions. The plant species should be local species and widely
available in the country. Use of exotic plants in constructed wetland systems should be
avoided as they are highly invasive and difﬁcult to control. The plant should be a perennial
with a life cycle of more than 1 year or two growing seasons to ensure the sustainability of the
constructed wetland system. Wetland plants with aesthetic appeal will provide a landscape-
pleasing environment.
To assist in plant selection, a number of species that have been used successfully in the
northeastern United States are listed in Table 13.4.

7. DESIGN OF CONSTRUCTED WETLAND SYSTEMS
7.1. Design Principles
Characteristics of wastewater to be treated, as well as desired and/or required discharge
limits, need to be taken into consideration in designing a constructed wetland treatment
system. Main characteristics of the wastewater include both soluble and solid organic
compounds, i.e., biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), nitrogen com-
pounds, phosphorus compounds, heavy metals, pathogenic bacteria, and/or viruses.
Constructed wetlands could be designed to remove these characteristics. Design consider-
ations in constructed wetland system may include hydraulic capacity, loading rate, retention
time, plant type, and species. These in turn, are constrained by regulations and efﬂuent
discharge limits. Constructed wetlands are dynamic systems inﬂuenced by a wide suite of
factors ranging from the regional climatic conditions and geological characteristics to the
local vegetation to land-use patterns.

7.2. Hydraulics
The hydraulic capacity of a wetland can be deﬁned as the ability of the wetland to process a
given volume of wastewater in a given time. This period of time is known as hydraulic
retention time (HRT), which is the expected average time in which a molecule of water will
ﬂow from one end to the other of the wetland. Requirements vary depending on the pollutant
and the desired level of treatment. Typical detention times are 2–5 days for BOD removal
and 7–14 days for nitrogen removal [13].
The hydraulic retention time in the wetland can be calculated using equation (13.1) below:
t ¼ V
Q ¼ LW dmn þ dw
ð
Þ
Q
¼ A dmn þ dw
ð

ð13:1Þ
where
t ¼ hydraulic retention time, days
L ¼ length of the wetland cell, m (ft)
W ¼ width of the wetland cell, m (ft)
dm ¼ depth of media, m (ft)
dw ¼ depth of water from media surface, m (ft)
n ¼ porosity or the space available for water to ﬂow through the wetland; porosity is percent
expressed in decimal. Typically in a mature wetlands are in the range of 0.65–0.75.
Q ¼ the average ﬂow through the wetland, m3/day (ft3/day)
V ¼ volume of water in the system, m3 (ft3)
As ¼ surface area of wetland, m2 (ft2)
The hydraulic loading rate (HLR) is a term that provides a measure of the volumetric
application of wastewater into the wetland. It is often used to make comparisons between
wetland systems and indicates their potential to be overloaded by wastewater.
Hydraulic loading rate is calculated using the following expression:
HLR ¼ Q
As
ð13:2Þ
where
HLR ¼ hydraulic loading rate, m/day (ft/day)
Q ¼ the average ﬂow through the wetland, m3/day (ft3/day)

7.3. General Design Procedures [14]
A constructed wetland system can be considered to be attached growth biological reactors
system, and their performance can also be estimated using ﬁrst-order plug-ﬂow kinetics for
BOD and nitrogen removal.

Nitrogen removal is a temperature-dependent process and is highly sensitive to cold
temperature. In winter time, once the temperature falls below 5 C, nitrogen removal will
be difﬁcult. It is much easier for wetlands to remove nitrates than ammonia; hence, if nitrogen
removal is a goal, then the treatment process should provide for nitriﬁcation, with subsequent
discharge into wetlands for denitriﬁcation.
For nitriﬁcation process, the following assumptions are being made:
All the organic nitrogen entering the system will be converted to ammonia nitrogen (AN).
AN removal is due entirely to nitriﬁcation.
Nitriﬁcation process is described by a plug-ﬂow ﬁrst-order model the same as equation
(13.3) or equation (13.5) with Ce ¼ efﬂuent ammonia (NH4) concentration and Co ¼ inﬂuent
TKN concentration as follows:

ð
Þ ¼ AskT  dmn þ dw
ð
Þ=Q
ð13:7Þ
where
TKN ¼ inﬂuent Kjeldahl nitrogen, mg/L
NH4eff ¼ efﬂuent ammonia, mg/L
The following are temperature-dependent functions to compute the rate constant for
nitrogen removal:

kT ¼ 0.1367(1.15)(T  10) day 1
where T ¼ (1–10 C)
kT ¼ 0.2187(1.048)(T  20) day 1

Nitrate removal via denitriﬁcation process can be estimated using equation (13.6) with

The basic mechanisms for BOD removal in SSF wetlands are similar to SF/FWS wetlands
as described above. However, for SSF wetlands, the dw ¼ 0. Therefore, equations (13.4) and
(13.5) will be as follows:

Nitrogen removal formulas are the same as for surface ﬂow (SF) system, except that the
reaction rate constants are different. For the nitriﬁcation process, this type of system is very
dependent on the emergent plants to supply oxygen to the root zone for nitriﬁcation process to
occur. Therefore, the nitriﬁcation rate constant should be a function of the root zone as
follows:
k20 ¼ 0:01854 þ 0:3922 rz
ð Þ2:6077 day1
ð13:12Þ
where
k20 ¼ nitriﬁcation rate constant at 20 C, day1

For denitriﬁcation process, the design model is described by (13.10), with Ce and Co
deﬁned as efﬂuent nitrate (NO3) and inﬂuent nitrate (NO3) concentrations, respectively.
The temperature-dependent kT is the same as that for SF wetland.

8. WETLAND MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE
Monitoring the water quality and maintenance of the wetland areas are essential compo-
nents of a wetland operation. Wetland monitoring is required to obtain sufﬁcient data to assess
the wetland performance in fulﬁlling the objectives. Wetland maintenance is required to
manage macrophytes and desirable species to remove invading weeds, to remove sediment
from the wetlands, and to remove litter from the wetlands [15].
Effective wetland performance depends on adequate pretreatment, conservative constitu-
ent and hydraulic loading rates, collection of monitoring information to assess system
performance, and knowledge of successful operation strategies. Sustaining a dense stand of
desirable vegetation within the wetland is crucial to ensure treatment efﬁciency. Aggressive
species will out-compete less competitive ones and cause gradual changes in wetland vege-
tation. Certain undesirable plant species or weeds may be introduced to the wetland from the
catchment. Natural succession of wetland plants will take place. However, some aquatic
weeds may require maintenance by periodic removal. Weed invasion can dramatically reduce
the ability of wetlands to meet its design objectives. For example, pondweed (Azolla),
duckweed (Lemna), water fern (Salvinia molesta), and water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)
Wetlands for Wastewater Treatment
669

can form dense mats, exclude light, and reduce dissolved oxygen in the water. Manual
removal of noxious and undesirable weeds column is necessary and eventually leads to an
increase in the movement of nutrients through the system.
Water level management is crucial to control weed growth. Floods will cause plants to be
scoured from the wetland and/or drowned. If a large area of plants is lost, reestablishment will
need to be carried out. Small areas will generally recover naturally while larger areas above
5 m2 may require replanting. Plant viability is vital to water quality improvement in wetlands.
Visible signs of plant distress or pest attack should be investigated promptly. Severe infesta-
tion could lead to severe stunting and death of plants. Biopesticides or narrow spectrum pest-
speciﬁc insecticides could be used if pest population exceeds a certain threshold value.
Water levels are important in wetlands which may have signiﬁcant effects on hydrology
and hydraulics and impact on wetland biota. Water level should be monitored using water
level control structures to ensure successful plant growth. A recirculation system should be in
place to allow water from outlet points to be fed back to the wetlands to supplement catchment
ﬂows during dry periods. Suspended solids from efﬂuents and litter fall from plants will
accumulate in time and gradually reduce the pore space which has to be ﬂushed to prevent
short-circuiting. In terms of health consideration, monitoring of mosquito populations should
be undertaken to avoid diseases, which can result in a local health-related problem. Selected
ﬁsh population can be introduced into wetland as a mean to kill mosquito larvae.
8.1. Water Quality Monitoring
When constructed wetlands are used to treat wastewater, the main objective of measuring
performance is to assess if the regulatory discharge limits are being met. Therefore, water
quality data are a good indication of wetland performance. Water quality should be monitored
through assessment of inﬂow and outﬂow water quality parameters.
Some important water quality parameters which could be monitored may include dissolved
oxygen, redox potential, water temperature, pH value, and turbidity, which are the in situ
parameters, while laboratory analysis parameters include total suspended solids (TSS),
chemical conductivity, ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), nitrate-nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
magnesium, soluble Fe, mercury, lead, zinc, iron, cyanide, arsenic, phenols, chemical oxygen
demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), fecal coliforms, and oil and grease.
9. CASE STUDY
9.1. Putrajaya Wetlands, Malaysia
Constructed wetland is a new area of research in Malaysia. The use of constructed wetlands
started in Malaysia in 1999 with the introduction of 200 ha of Putrajaya Wetlands which
is one of the largest constructed freshwater wetlands in the tropics. Putrajaya Wetlands is
a pioneer venture in constructed wetland system. It functions as a ﬂood control system and a
natural treatment system that ﬁlters most of the pollutants in river water and inﬂows to the

wetlands before ﬁnally discharging to the lake. Apart from providing an expansive area for
recreation and education, it forms an essential part of the ecosystem.
Table 13.6 shows the components that form the Putrajaya Wetlands [16].
The salient features of Putrajaya Wetland are as follows [17]:
Putrajaya Wetlands are the ﬁrst man-made wetlands in Malaysia.
It is also one of the largest fully constructed freshwater wetlands in the tropics.
It is one of the largest man-made lakes in an urban setting.
At a level of 21 m, the resulting surface area is some 400 ha.
Average depth is 6.6 m.
Deepest depth of some parts is in the range of 12–13 m.
The Wetlands were constructed in March 1997 and was completed in August 1998. The
water levels in the cells varies from level 32 m to level 23.5 m with water from each cell
cascading down over each cell weir. The 400 ha lake was created by construction of a dam on
the lower reaches of the Chuau River. Construction was undertaken in two phases. The ﬁrst
phase of approximately 110 ha involved the construction of a temporary dam across Chuau
River. This allowed inundation of the upper half of the lake.
The dam was completed in May 1998 and the impoundment of the ﬁrst phase of the lake
commenced in September 1998 and was fully inundated in January 1999. The second phase of
the lake begun thereafter, with the construction of the permanent dam in 2000. Two years later
after the dam was completed, the lake was completely inundated by March 2003 reaching to
level 21 m.
It is the intention of Perbadanan Putrajaya (local authority) that the lake will be utilized for
various purposes, not only as an aesthetic one. The many uses envisaged included both
primary and secondary contact recreation. To that end, guidelines were developed to manage
the lake by Perbadanan Putrajaya and to regulate and manage lake activities.
The Putrajaya Wetlands are the ﬁrst man-made wetlands in Malaysia. The lake is recog-
nized as the most important feature of the city—providing the focal point for the development.
At a water level of 21 m, the resulting surface area of the lake measures some 400 ha. The
average depth of the wetland is 6.6 m and storage volume stands at 265 million cubic meters.
It is one of the largest man-made lakes in an urban setting. It is expected to provide focus for
many watersport activities as well being used for relaxation. Figure 13.9 shows the overall
layout of Putrajaya Wetland system.

Kingdom (UK) in 1985, which is owned by Anglian Water, to treat tertiary treatment of
domestic sewage. It has the area of 3,500 m2 with layout consisting of two beds of 50 m
(length)  35 m (width). The wetland was designed for population equivalent (p.e.) of 1,300
(1 p. e. 	 150 L day 1 	 0.15 m3 day 1).
The support medium used was 0.60 m soil from sugar beet washing, and the vegetation was
Phragmites australis. The ﬂoor slope was in the ratio of 1:50. The wastewater ﬂow through a
slotted pipe buried in gravel and the treated efﬂuent was discharged using a height-adjustable
bellmouth.
The wetland has an average ﬂow of 240 m3 day1, average hydraulic load of
0.07 m3 m2 day1, and plan surface area of 2.92 m2 pe1. The performance of the wetland
can be seen in Table 13.7.
9.3. Arcata, California [6]
Arcata is located on the northern coast of California about 240 miles north of San
Francisco. The population of Arcata is about 15,000. The major local industries are logging,
wood products, ﬁshing, and Humboldt State University. The surface ﬂow (SF) constructed
wetland located in Arcata is one of the most famous in the United States.
The community was originally served, starting in 1949, with a primary treatment plant that
discharged undisinfected efﬂuent to Arcata Bay. In 1957, oxidation ponds were constructed,
and chlorine disinfection was added in 1966. In 1974, the State of California prohibited
discharge to bays and estuaries unless “enhancement” could be proven, and the construction
of a regional treatment plant was recommended. In response, the city of Arcata formed a Task
Force of interested participants, and this group began research on lower-cost alternative
treatment processes using natural systems. From 1979 to 1982, research conducted at pilot-
scale wetland units conﬁrmed their capability to meet the proposed discharge limits. In 1983,
the city was authorized by the state to proceed with development, design, and construction of
a full-scale wetland system.
Construction was completed in 1986, and the system has been in continuous service
since that time. The wetland system proposed by the city was unique in that it included
densely vegetated cells dedicated for treatment followed by “enhancement” marsh cells with
a large percentage of open water for ﬁnal polishing and habitat and recreational beneﬁts.

This combined system has been successful since start-up and has become the model for many
wetland systems elsewhere.
Two NPDES permits are required for system operation: one for discharge to the enhance-
ment wetlands for protection of public access and one for discharge to the bay. The NPDES
limits for both discharges are BOD 30 mg/l and TSS 30 mg/l, pH 6.5–9.5, and fecal coliforms
of 200 CFU/100 ml. Since public access is allowed to the enhancement marshes, the state
required disinfection prior to transfer of the pond/treatment marsh efﬂuent. The state then
required ﬁnal disinfection/dechlorination prior to ﬁnal discharge to Arcata Bay. The efﬂuent
from the ﬁnal enhancement marsh is pumped back to the treatment plant for this ﬁnal
disinfection step.
The basic system design for the treatment and enhancement marshes was prepared by
researchers at Humboldt State University. The design was based on experience with a pilot
wetland system that was studied from 1979 through 1982. The pilot wetland system included
12 parallel wetland cells, each 20 ft wide and 200 ft long (L:W 10:1), with a maximum
possible depth of 4 ft. These were operated at variable hydraulic loadings, variable water
depths, and variable initial plant types during the initial phase of the study. Hardstem bulrush
(Scirpus validus) was used as the sole type of vegetation on all cells. The inlet structure for
each cell was a 60o V-notch weir, and the outlet used an adjustable 90o V-notch weir,
permitting control of the water depth. Heavy clay soils were used for construction of these
cells, so a liner was not necessary and seepage was minimal. The second phase of the pilot
study focused on the inﬂuence of open water zones, plant harvesting, and kinetics optimiza-
tion for BOD, TSS, and nutrient removal. Some of the cells, for example, were subdivided
into smaller compartments with bafﬂes and weirs along the ﬂow path. The results from these
pilot studies not only provided the basis for full-scale system design but have contributed
signiﬁcantly to the state of the art for design of all wetland systems.
The full-scale treatment wetlands, with a design ﬂow of 2.9 mgd, utilize three cells
operated in parallel. Cells 1 and 2 have surface areas of about 2.75 acres each (L  600 ft,
W  200 ft), and cell 3 is about 2.0 acres (L  510 ft, W  170 ft). The original design water
depth was 2 ft, but at the time of the 1997 site visit for this report, they were being operated
with a 4-ft depth. Hardstem bulrush was again used as the only plant species on these
treatment marshes. Clumps of plant shoots and rhizomes were hand planted on about 1 m
centers. Since nutrient removal is not a requirement for the full-scale system, the treatment
marshes could be designed for a relatively short detention time primarily for removal of BOD
and TSS. The HRT in these three cells is 1.9 days at design ﬂow and a 2-ft water depth. These
treatment marshes were designed to produce an efﬂuent meeting the NPDES limits for BOD
and TSS (30/30 mg/L) on an average basis. These wetland cells utilized the bottom area of
former lagoon cells. A schematic diagram of the operating system is shown in Fig. 13.10.
The ﬁnal “enhancement” marshes were intended to provide for further efﬂuent polishing
and to provide signiﬁcant habitat and recreational beneﬁts for the community. These three
cells are operated in series at an average depth of 2.0 ft and have a total area of about 31 acres.
Retention time is about 9 days at average ﬂow rates. The ﬁrst cell (Allen Marsh), completed
in 1981, was constructed on former log storage area and contains about 50 % open water.
674
A. Idris et al.

The second cell (Gearheart Marsh), completed in 1981, was constructed on former pasture
land and contains about 80 % open water. The third cell (Hauser Marsh) was constructed in a
former borrow pit and contains about 60 % open water. These 31 acres of constructed
freshwater (efﬂuent) marshes have been supplemented with an additional 70 acres of saltwater
marshes, freshwater wetlands, brackish ponds, and estuaries to form the Arcata Marsh and
Wildlife Sanctuary, all of which has been developed with trails, an interpretive center, and
other recreational features. The shallow water zones in these marshes contain a variety of
emergent vegetation. The deeper zones contain submerged plants (sago pondweed) that
provide food sources for ducks and other birds and release oxygen to the water to further
enhance treatment.
The construction costs for the entire system, including modiﬁcations to the primary
treatment plant, disinfection/ dechlorination, pumping stations, and so forth were USD
5,300,000 (1985). Construction costs for the treatment wetlands are only estimated to be
about USD 225,000, or USD 30,000 per acre, or USD 78 per 1,000 gpd of design capacity
(including removal of sludge from this site, which was previously a sedimentation pond for an
aerated lagoon). This does not include pumping costs to transfer ﬁnal efﬂuent back to the
chlorination contact basin, disinfection facilities, or the pumping and piping costs to reach the
enhancement marshes. Land costs also are not included since the treatment wetlands were
located on city-owned property.
Performance data were collected for a 2-year period during the Phase 1 pilot testing
program. This program varied the ﬂow rate and water depth in each of the two cells to
compare BOD removal performance at different detention times and loading rates that would
represent the potential range for full-scale application at Arcata. These data are summarized in
Table 8.1. The BOD and TSS in the pond efﬂuent varied considerably during this period, and
not all of the cells were uniformly vegetated. Seasonal variations in performance were
observed, but Table 13.8 presents only the average efﬂuent characteristics for each of the
cells over the entire study period. It is apparent from the data that the wetlands were able to
produce excellent efﬂuent quality over the full range of loadings and detention times used.

The long-term average performance of the Arcata system is summarized in Table 13.9. It is
clear that both the treatment and enhancement marshes provide signiﬁcant treatment for
BOD and TSS. The long-term removals follow the pilot project results. Most of the nitrogen is
removed during the ﬁnal stage in the enhancement marshes. This is because of the long hydraulic
detention time (HRT ¼ 9 days), the availability of oxygen and nitrifying organisms in the open
water zones, and anoxic conditions for denitriﬁcation in the areas with emergent vegetation.
The treatment wetlands (7.5 acres), with nominal HRTs of 3 days, met weekly limits of
30 mg/l BOD and TSS 90 % of the time. The enhancement wetlands (28 acres), with a
nominal HRT of 11 days, met weekly limits of less than 5 mg/l BOD/TSS 90 % of the time.
Performance of both wetlands results primarily from proper operation and appropriate design
that involves a combination of emergent vegetation and open water zones. TSS levels are
higher in cell efﬂuents where outlets are located in open water zones. Recent advances in
wetland treatment can be found from the literature [18–32].

10. WETLAND: IDENTIFICATION, CREATION, UTILIZATION,
RESTORATION, AND PROTECTION FOR POLLUTION CONTROL
AND WATER CONSERVATION
According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), wetlands are areas
where water covers the soil or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for
varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season. Water satura-
tion largely determines how the soil develops and the types of plant and animal communities
living in and on the soil. Wetlands may support both aquatic and terrestrial species. The
prolonged presence of water creates conditions that favor the growth of specially adapted
plants and promote the development of characteristic wetlands soils. Wetlands generally
include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas [25, 26]. There are many natural wetlands
and constructed wetlands. Both can be used for pollution control, ﬂood control, water
conservation, and ecological protection. Therefore, both natural wetlands and constructed
wetlands should be properly managed and protected in accordance with the government-
speciﬁed wetland water quality standards [31].
A watershed, also called a drainage basin, is the area in which all water, sediments, and
dissolved materials ﬂow or drain from the land into a common river, lake, ocean, or other
body of water. Wetlands are important elements of a watershed because they serve as the link
between land and water resources. Wetlands protection programs are most effective when
coordinated with other surface and groundwater protection programs and with other resource
management programs, such as ﬂood control, water supply, protection of ﬁsh and wildlife,
recreation, control of stormwater, and nonpoint source pollution [26].
The quality of the wetlands and other water resources is directly linked to the quality of the
environment surrounding these waters. A watershed-based approach to water and wetlands
protection considers the whole system, including other resource management programs that
address land, air, and water to successfully manage problems for a given water resource. The
watershed approach thus includes not only the water resource but also the surrounding land
from which the water drains [25–32].
Wetlands are important elements of a watershed because they serve as the link between
land and water resources. Oceans, coasts, and estuaries provide critical natural habitat and
recreational areas for our planet of earth. In case our wetlands and watersheds are
contaminated, they must be properly restored [26, 28–30, 32]. Innovative use of compost
has been found to be one of the good methods for wetlands restoration and habitat
revitalization [29].
GLOSSARY OF WETLAND
Ambient monitoring Monitoring within natural systems (e.g., lakes, rivers, estuaries, wetlands) to
determine existing conditions.
Constructed wetland or created wetland A wetland at a site where it did not formerly occur.
Constructed/created wetlands are designed to meet a variety of human beneﬁts including, but not
limited to, the treatment of water pollution discharges (e.g., municipal wastewater, stormwater) and
the mitigation of wetland losses permitted under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
Wetlands for Wastewater Treatment
677

Enhancement An activity increasing one or more natural or artiﬁcial wetland functions. For example,
the removal of a point source discharge impacting a wetland.
Functions The role wetlands serve which are of value to society or the environment.
Habitat The environment occupied by individuals of a particular species, population, or community.
Hydrology The science dealing with the properties, distribution, and circulation of water both on the
surface and under the earth.
Restoration An activity returning a wetland from a disturbed or altered condition with lesser acreage
or functions to a previous condition with greater wetland acreage or functions. For example,
restoration might involve the plugging of a drainage ditch to restore the hydrology to an area that
was a wetland before the installation of the drainage ditch.
Riparian Areas next to or substantially inﬂuenced by water. These may include areas adjacent to
rivers, lakes, or estuaries. These areas often include wetlands.
Upland Any area that does not qualify as wetland because the associated hydrological regime is not
sufﬁciently wet to elicit development of vegetation, soils, and/or hydrological characteristics
associated with wetlands or is deﬁned as open waters.
Wetlands Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and
duration sufﬁcient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of
vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetland generally includes
swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

Abstract This chapter describes the application of Living Machines, which are advanced
ecologically engineered systems (AEES), which use natural abilities of living organisms to
break down macromolecules and metabolize organic nutrients typically found in wastewater
and polluted water bodies. The choice of any natural bioremediation strategy depends upon
the nature and characteristics of the environment polluted, the nature of the pollutants, and the
availability of the biological agents. This chapter focuses on the application of bioremediation
approaches in the remediation of polluted water ecosystems, i.e., rivers, lakes, and estuaries.
Fourteen case histories are presented for introduction of practical applications of Living
Machine in bioremediation, wastewater treatment, and water reuse. The technology provides
opportunities for environmental and water resources education, showcasing its water reuse
advantages with broad applications in water shortage areas, such as California, Nevada,
and New Mexico.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Ecological Pollution
Ecosystems comprising estuarine environments, marine shorelines, terrestrial environ-
ments, freshwater, groundwater, and wetlands are heavily polluted directly or indirectly by
human activities such as mining operations, discharge of industrial wastes, agrochemical
usage, and long-term applications of urban sewage sludge in agricultural soils, oil spills,
682
Y.-T. Hung et al.

vehicles exhausts, and bilge oil as well as anthropogenic organic pollutants. These activities
introduce into the various ecosystems a diverse array of pollutants including heavy metals,
volatile organic compounds, nitro-aromatic compounds, phenolic compounds, xenobiotic
chemicals (such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), and pesticides), and high nutrient-loaded wastewater [1-7]. In the environment
these pollutants pose great health risks to both human and wildlife. The adverse effects of
various pollutants depend on their chemical nature and characteristics. For instance, PCBs,
PAHs, and pesticide residues owe their toxicity to being recalcitrant, which means they persist
in the environment for many years. Organophosphate-based pesticides have been demon-
strated to exhibit neurotoxicological properties as well as being associated with the pathology
and chromosomal damages associated with bladder cancer [8]. Heavy metals, on the other
hand, pose the greatest health risk because of the difﬁculty associated with removal from the
environment, which arises from the fact that they cannot be chemically or biologically
degraded, making them (heavy metals) ultimately indestructible [2].
When it comes to water, the situation becomes more serious since both the quantity and the
quality of freshwater present major problems over much of the world’s continents. Freshwater
lakes and rivers are polluted by oil spills as well as less satisfactorily treated efﬂuents that
come from various processing industries [9]. In addition, groundwater pollution is increas-
ingly becoming widespread because of uncontrolled waste deposits, leakages from petro-
chemical tanks, and continued percolation of untreated sewage, agrochemicals, and other
pollutants in the aquifers. Notably, over the last several hundred years, humans have begun
living in higher and higher densities, leading to high volumes of sewage output in small
geographic areas. This high density of sewage has led to the need to treat the wastewater in
order to protect both humans and ecosystem health. Besides, fruits, vegetables, olive oil
processing, and fermentation industries also generate solid waste and wastewater which is
nutrient rich. Such wastewater has high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), (which is a
measure of oxygen consumption required by microbial oxidation or readily degradable
organic and ammonia), chemical oxygen demand (COD) [9], and is usually acidic (low
pH). These wastes often ﬁnd their way into freshwater bodies (rivers and lakes) where they
cause eutrophication (the process of becoming rich in nutrients), which triggers explosive
algal blooms. Owing to exhaustion of micronutrients, toxic products or disease, the algal
population eventually crashes. The decomposition of the dead algal biomass by heterotrophic
microorganisms exhausts the dissolved oxygen in the water, precipitating extensive ﬁsh skills
and septic conditions. Even though eutrophication does not go to this extreme, algal mats,
turbidity, discoloration, and shifts of ﬁsh population from valuable species to more tolerant
but less value forms represent undesirable eutrophication changes [10]. Besides, it is esti-
mated that between 1.7 and 8.8 million metric tons of oil are released into the world’s water
every year, of which more than 90% is directly related to human activities including
deliberate waste disposal [11, 12]. For example, marine oil spills emanating from large-
scale spill accidents have received great attention due to their catastrophic damage to the
environment: (a) the spill of 37,000 metric tons (11 million gallons) of North Slope crude oil
into Prince William Sound, Alaska, from the Exxon Valdez in 1989 led to mortality of

683

thousands of seabirds and marine mammals, a signiﬁcant reduction in population of many
intertidal and subtidal organisms, and many long-term environmental impacts; (b) minor oil
spills and oil contaminations from nonpoint source discharges (e.g., urban runoff and boat
lodge) pollute rivers, lakes, and estuaries. As a matter of fact, the US Environmental
Protection Agency National Water Quality Inventory reports nonpoint source pollution as
the nation’s largest source of water quality problem [13, 14], with approximately 40% of
surveyed rivers, lakes, and estuaries not clean enough to meet basic uses such as ﬁshing and
swimming [12].
1.2. Bioremediation Strategies and Advanced Ecologically
Engineered Systems (AEES)
In order to address these environmental/ecological pollution concerns, several bioremedi-
ation (natural or biological remediation approaches) strategies have been devised. For exam-
ple, to address pollution of the environment by sewage and wastewater, an assortment of
technologies including septic systems in rural areas and sewage treatment plants in urban have
been developed. The purpose of these systems is to remove pathogens, solid waste, and
organic carbon from the water. Some also remove nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus
which normally cause eutrophication in aquatic systems [15]. There are, however, some
problems with the current systems for sewage treatment. Septic tanks in particular do not
effectively remove nutrients and many larger treatment plants generally rely on chemical
treatment to remove some nutrients. Notably, phosphorus removal has largely relied on
chemical precipitation. Although nitrogen removal primarily relies on microbiological pro-
cesses, methanol is often added to stimulate the removal of nitrate. Treatment plants also
typically use chemicals such as chlorine or ozone to remove pathogens. Another difﬁculty of
conventional wastewater treatment is the large energy input required. A more fundamental
problem with conventional wastewater treatment is its failure to take advantage of the
potential resources embodied in wastewater. The nutrients in wastewater are an important
resource that is currently going unused. By changing the way wastewater is processed, it is
possible to take advantage of these resources [15].
Several biologically based technological systems, which are currently being developed as
alternatives to conventional systems include, (a) the widely studied use of natural or
constructed wetlands to treat wastes (discussed in Sect. 3.4) and (b) the use of a hybrid
between sewage plants and wetlands. The use of a technology based on biological systems,
microorganisms and plants (bioremediation/phytoremediation), known as advanced ecolog-
ically engineered systems (AEES), is beginning to emerge as promising technology, partic-
ularly as a secondary treatment option [12]. Speciﬁcally, these advanced ecologically
engineered systems (AEES) use natural abilities of living organisms to break down macro-
molecules and metabolize organic nutrients typically found in wastewater and polluted water
bodies. The major advantages of using AEES technology include the following: (a) it is less
costly, (b) it is less intrusive to the contaminated site, and (c) it is more environmentally
benign in terms of its end products [12]. However, the choice of any natural bioremediation
strategy goes hand in hand with the nature and characteristics of the environment polluted, the
684

nature of the pollutant(s), and the availability of the biological agent(s). It is not the aim of this
chapter to exhaust all aspects of application of bioremediation technology. However, this
chapter dwells on the application of bioremediation approaches in the remediation of polluted
water ecosystems, i.e., rivers, lakes, and estuaries.
2. LIVING MACHINES: AS CONCEPT IN BIOREMEDIATION
As already pointed out above (Sect. 1), water bodies are on a daily basis being contami-
nated with waste and therefore the availability of clean and safe drinking water on Earth is
continually reducing. Besides, the chemical methods aimed at mitigating the problem intro-
duce other residual pollutant as a result. On the other hand, bioremediation, which uses
biological systems to mitigate the problem, has proven to be a more effective and safe way
of restoring the ecosystem to its natural state. Ecological studies have, for long, revealed that
nature has an inbuilt system to restore itself and thereby sustaining its continuity. It is the
tilting of the balance in nature that always leads to undesirable consequences. In a typical
ecosystem, different populations interact, whereby some of them beneﬁt positively from the
interactions while others may be negatively affected by the interactions [10]. For example,
possible interaction between micro- and macropopulations can be recognized as negative
interactions (competition and amensalism), positive interactions (commensalisms, synergism,
and mutualism), or interactions that are positive for one but negative for the other population
(parasitism and predation).
In simple communities, one or more of the above interactions can be observed. However, in
a complex natural biological community, all of these possible interactions will probably occur
between different populations concurrently [10]. Another important aspect emerging from
ecological studies is the observation that positive interactions (cooperation) predominate at
low population densities and negative ones (competition) at high population densities. As a
result, there is an optimal population density for maximal growth rate [10]. In a natural
ecosystem a balance always exists whereby different populations interact either positively or
negatively until equilibrium is established. In other words, natural population can act as
“Living Machines” in keeping the ecosystems habitable by every community member
population. Living Machines as concept evolves around the utilization of different biological
(microbial, plants, and animals) systems to decontaminate the environment of pollutants that
are, on a daily basis, released as a result of various human activities. Carefully studied
biological systems are selected and their metabolic and growth requirements evaluated.
Then different community populations that cooperate in their interaction are given particular
tasks, after which the product is used by yet another set of cooperative community
populations. As the pollutant gets depleted, the populations likewise reduce in sizes. How-
ever, the engineered ecosystems (Living Machines) should have systems that reduce the
population via the natural food chain. Therefore, instead of population downsizing through
death, prey–predator relations/interactions are introduced. These keep the sizes of the various
populations at optimal and thus maintain the performance of the systems. In other words,
these systems differ from a typical natural ecosystem in as far combining a variety of natural
Living Machines
685

processes in a structured manner, which artiﬁcially accelerate wastewater puriﬁcation
[16]. The term Living Machines describes technologies that employ living organisms of all
types and usually housed within a casing or structure made of extremely lightweight materials
and powered primarily by sunlight. A typical Living Machine comprises a series of tanks or
constructed ponds teeming with live plants, trees, grasses, and algae, koi and gold ﬁsh, tiny
freshwater shrimps, snails, and a diversity of zooplanktons as well as bacteria [16]. In North
America, the brothers Eugene Odum and Howard T. Odum laid out the conceptual framework
for the practical concepts of ecological designs, and over the last three decades, these concepts
have been transformed into part of the science called “ecological engineering” [17].
Ecological engineering is deﬁned as the design of sustainable ecosystems that integrate
human society with its natural environment for mutual beneﬁt. It involves creating and
restoring sustainable ecosystems that have value to both humans and nature. In so doing,
ecological engineering combines basic and applied science for the restoration, design, and
construction of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Two major goals are achieved, namely,
(a) the restoration of ecosystems that have been substantially disturbed by human activities
such as environmental pollution or land disturbances and (b) the development of new
sustainable ecosystems (Living Machines) that have both human and ecological value
[18]. It is engineering in the sense that it involves the design of the natural environment
through quantitative approaches, which rely on basic science, a technology whose primary
tool is the self-designing ecosystem, and it is biology and ecology in the sense that the
components are all of the biological species of the world [18].
The designing of Living Machines explores the chieﬂy two of nature’s attributes, namely,
self-organization and self-designing capacities of ecosystems. Self-design and the related
attribute of self-organization are important properties of ecosystems that require clear under-
standing in the context of creation and restoration of ecosystems. Self-organization, deﬁned as
the property of systems in general to reorganize themselves given an environment that is
inherently unstable and nonhomogeneous, is a property that applies very well to ecosystems.
This is so because in any ecosystem species are continually being introduced and deleted,
while species interactions, e.g., predation, mutualism, etc., bring about change in dominance,
as well as changes in the environment itself. Since ecological engineering often involves the
development of new ecosystems as well as the use of pilot-scale models such as mesocosms to
test ecosystem behavior, the self-organizing capacity of ecosystems remains an important
concept for ecological engineering. Besides, self-organization develops ﬂexible networks
with a much higher potential for adaptation to new situations. It is for this reason that it is
desirable for solving many of the ecological problems. Therefore, in the construction of
Living Machines whereby biological systems are involved, the ability of the ecosystems to
change, adapt, and grow according to forcing functions and internal feedbacks is most
important [18].
On the other hand, self-design, which is deﬁned as the application of self-organization in
the design of ecosystems, ensures the continual presence and survival of species in ecosystems
after their introduction by nature or humans. As a matter of fact, self-design is an ecosystem’s
function in which the chance introduction of species ensures continuous sustainability of the
system. The ecologically engineered system may be further augmented by multiple seeding of
686
Y.-T. Hung et al.

species, which would speed the selection process during the process of self-organization
[19]. In the context of ecosystem development, self-design means that if an ecosystem is open
to allow “seeding” of enough species and their propagation through human or natural means,
the system itself will optimize its design by selecting for the assemblage of plants, microbes,
and animals that is best adapted for existing conditions. The ecosystem then “designs a mix of
man-made and ecological components in a pattern that maximizes performance, owing to its
ability to reinforce the strongest of alternative pathways that are provided by the variety of
species and human initiatives” [19].
By applying these biological systems as the driving force, several living technological
innovations have been designed [17]. Living Machines or AEES are primarily designed as
either tank-based systems for treatment of point-source waste or ﬂoating systems placed on
existing bodies of water that receive nonpoint source pollution [17]. Besides, ecological
technologies are also useful in food production through waste conversions, architecture and
landscape design, and environmental protection and restoration. It is thus clear that this
technology is very advantageous to the conventional pollution management technologies.
2.1. Advantages of Living Machines
Living Machine technology offers a number of advantages over conventional treatment
processes:
(a)
Living Machines use no chemicals and are thus less costly than conventional treatment plants. For
example, in northern climates, some lagoon systems freeze over, making it necessary to ﬁnd
extensive storage space for wastewater until the warm discharge season. However, Living
Machines can be small enough to be placed in a greenhouse near the source of the pollutant
(sewage, wastewater from processing industries, agro-wastewater, etc.) for year-round treatment.
Besides, the constant supply of treated efﬂuent water is of such a high standard that it can be used
for horticulture and aquaculture production in addition to being recycled to non-potable use such
as toilets [16].
(b)
Living Machines have sensitive response systems. As such, a sudden inﬂux of toxic pollutants, for
example, is quickly obvious when snails move out of the water onto branches of leaves. In a
conventional system it can take days to chemically measure toxicity. The levels of other
indicators such as acidity can be determined by the color of the tails of certain species of ﬁsh.
If these are integral part of the system, it saves both time and money [16].
(c)
Owing to their cleanliness and lack of odor, Living Machines may be integrated into buildings,
providing an aesthetic dimension while at the same time reducing energy requirements. Conse-
quently, they are amenable to various designs that not only provide a quality-working environ-
ment but are also an attraction to visitors [16]. Such systems serve as direct examples of human
processes that are harmonious and symbiotic with natural systems.
(d)
They are easy to operate and maintain, i.e., the caring for a Living Machine such as a Restorer is
less labor intensive since the operator works with living and growing ecologies, rather than with
bags or tones of chemicals (15; 19).
(e)
Living Machines are capable of absorbing or resisting “shock loads” in the waste stream. They
owe this capacity to the fact that they are natural and biologically diverse systems, yet they are
also mechanically simple. Typical examples are the Lake Restorers. Restorer Technology is
borrowed from an analogous component in nature called the ﬂoating island. Like the ﬂoating
Living Machines
687

islands, Restorers are an assembly of engineered ecologies incorporated into ﬂoating rafts. As the
storm blows on the lake, the “Island” or Restorer migrates around with the changing wind. As this
is done, the diverse ecologies of plant micro- and macroorganisms decontaminate the lake,
thereby restoring the water back to acceptable health standards. In doing all this, any shock
load is being resisted [16].
(f)
These systems are modular and can be made in various designs to meet the needs of a growing
business or community. This means that the operations and efﬁciency of the Living Machines can
be easily enhanced and improved without excessive costs involved. New Living Machines are
already a third smaller than earlier. As the systems are reﬁned and in some cases miniaturized, it
will be possible to integrate them in different ways to support human population without
destroying the rest of nature [16].
(g)
Since most ecosystems are primarily solar-powered systems, they are self-sustaining. Therefore,
once an ecosystem (Living Machine) is constructed, it is able to sustain itself indeﬁnitely through
self-design with only a modest amount of intervention.
(h)
Living Machines have the ability to self-design. The engineer provides the containment vessels that
enclose the Living Machine and then seed them with diverse organisms from speciﬁc environments.
Within the Living Machine the organisms self-design the internal ecology in relation to their
prescribed tasks and the energy and nutrient streams to which they are exposed [20].
(i)
Living Machines have the ability to self-replicate through reproduction by the vast majority of the
organisms within the system. This means that, in theory at least, Living Machines can be designed
to operate for centuries or even millennia. In Living Machines the intelligence of nature is
reapplied to human ends. They are both garden and machines [20].
2.2. Limitations of Living Machines
In as much as Living Machines offer such versatile advantages, they are not without
limitations:
(a)
The reliance of Living Machines on solar power means that a large part of land or water is needed.
Therefore, if property purchase (which is, in a way, the purchase of solar energy) is involved in
regions where land prices are high, then ecological engineering approaches may not be
feasible [19].
(b)
Sometimes the species available may not be efﬁcient in degrading very toxic and persistent,
recalcitrant wastes. This may result in the persistence of such waste, and as a result pollution of
such habitats and accompanying health impacts to ﬂora and fauna persist.
(c)
Inasmuch as the natural system is desirable, in some instances the rate of inﬂow is so high that it
overshoots the natural rates of removal of the pollutants. This means that a longer residence time
may be required to give nature ample time to do the task. Accordingly, a large piece of land may
be required to set up the Living Machine, which may not always be available.
3. COMPONENTS OF THE LIVING MACHINES
3.1. Microbial Communities
The notion that microbial communities are the foundation of Living Machines is obvious.
What is less obvious is the diversity in communities of microorganisms required, if the
potential of ecological engineering is to be optimized. On the one hand, bacteria are consid-
ered as ubiquitous organisms that organize life on the planet. This is suggested to be through
688
Y.-T. Hung et al.

organization, not as distinct species as is conventionally understood in biology, but as unitary
society of organisms with no analogous counterparts among other living organisms [21]. On
the other hand, microbiology maintains that bacteria species have highly speciﬁc nutritional
and environmental requirements and the ubiquity principle, which may work over long-term
time frames, is inappropriate to the design of Living Technologies [21, 22]. In waste or
intensive aquaculture, for example, if conditions are not right for nitrifying bacteria, e.g., not
enough calcium carbonate as a carbon source, then Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter will
functionally disappear from the system. The only quick way to reestablish nitriﬁcation is
through correcting the calcium carbonate deﬁciency and reinoculating the system with culture
of appropriate bacteria. For their application in the design of Living Technologies, bacterial
communities remain a vital component, but unfortunately they largely remained unexplored.
Although some 10,000 species have been named and described and many important reactions
characterized, the natural history and ecology of these bacterial species have been little
studied and therefore their distribution and numbers remain obscure [21, 23]. Despite this
limitation, the use of microorganisms in designing Living Technologies has proceeded in
earnest. In their work with the system to degrade coal tar derivatives (PAHs), Margulis and
Schwartz [23] inoculated the treatment systems with microbial communities from such
diverse locations as salt marshes, sewage plants and rotting railroad ties, nucleated algae,
water molds, slime molds, slime nets, and protozoa. While the bacterial communities provide
a diverse array of metabolic pathways for the degradation of the pollutants, nucleated algae,
water molds, slime molds, slime nets, and protozoa, which are less diverse metabolically than
bacteria, are important for the efﬁciency of the system owing to their exceptionally diverse
life histories and nutritional habits. For example, it has been shown that protozoans are
important in removing coliform bacteria and pathogens from sewage as well as moribund
bacteria thus improving the systems’ efﬁciencies, while fungi are key decomposers in
ecological systems [21]. Currently, the microbial communities are estimated to comprise
about 100,000 species, many capable of excreting powerful enzymes from various metabolic
pathways. Such heterogeneous microbial communities are efﬁcient in the removal of organic
matter from wastewater [21]. Fungi, however, tend to dominate in low pH and terrestrial soils
than in aquatic environments. It may, therefore, be important that Living Technologies should
incorporate soil-based acid sites linked to the main process cycles into their design.
3.2. Macro-bio Communities (Animal Diversity)
The macro-bio communities comprising various animal species are the regulators, control
agents, and internal designers of ecosystems. Unfortunately, they are often little appreciated
organisms. It has long been recognized that organisms from every phylogenetic level have a
role in the design of Living Technologies and in the reversal of pollution and environmental
destruction. For this reason, a search of the vast repository of life forms for species useful to
ecological engineers is needed. Odum [24] empathized the need to ﬁnd control species,
meaning those organisms capable of directing living processes towards such useful end points
including foods, fuels, waste recovery, and environmental repair. The potential contributions
of animals to Living Technologies are therefore remarkable, yet their study has been badly
Living Machines
689

neglected in Biology of Wastewater Treatment. For example, mollusks are not mentioned
[25], and in the two-volume Ecological Aspects of Used Water Treatment, snails are men-
tioned only once and referred to as nuisance organisms [26, 27]. It has now been found that
snails play a central to the functioning of Living Technologies. As a matter of fact, pulmonate
snails, including members of the families Physidae, Lymnaeidae, and Planorbidae, feed on
the slime and sludge communities. Snails also play a dominant role in sludge reduction, tank
maintenance, and ecological ﬂuidized bed and marsh cleaning. Ram’s horn snails of the
family Planorbidae, for example, graze and control ﬁlamentous algae mats that would
otherwise clog and reduce the effectiveness of the diverse ﬂuidized bed communities.
Needless to say, some snails digest recalcitrant compounds. The salt marsh periwinkle,
Littorina irrorata, produces enzymes that attack cellulose, pectin, xylan, bean gum, major
polysaccharide classes, algae, fungi, and animal tissues as well as 19 other enzymes interac-
tive with carbohydrates, lipids, and peptides [28]. Besides, snails can function as alarms in the
Living Machines treating sewage. When a toxic load enters the Providence Sewage Treatment
System, for example, the snails quickly leave the water column and move into the moist lower
leaves of the ﬂoating plants above the water. Observing this behavior the operator then
increases the rate of recycling clean water back upstream into the ﬁrst cells. Consequently,
performance losses are minimized due to the rapid behavioral response of these animals [21].
Virtually all phyla of animals in aquatic environments feed through some ﬁltration
mechanism. Bivalves, algivorous ﬁsh, zooplankton, protists, rotifers, insect larvae, sponges,
and others are in this functional category [21]. They remove particles of approximately
0.1–50 μm from the water column. Bivalves are signiﬁcant ﬁlterers. For example, mussels
can retain suspended bacteria smaller than 1 μm. Efﬁciencies may reach 100% for particles
larger than 4 μm [29]. Individual freshwater clams of the genera Unio and Anodonta ﬁlter up
to 40 L/day of water, extracting colloidal materials and other suspended organic and inorganic
particles. Removal rates of 99.5 % may be achieved [30]. Zooplankton such a
microcrustaceans, on the other hand, can be employed to good effect in applied mesocosms.
They feed upon particles 25 μm and smaller and their juvenile stages graze on sub-
micrometer-sized particles. Since they can exchange the volume of a natural body of water
several times per day, it is difﬁcult to overstate their importance in ecological engineering
[21]. In cells within the Living Machines, where ﬁsh predators are absent, their numbers are
prodigious. Insects play pivotal roles in Living Technologies. Removed from predators in
ecologically engineered systems, they proliferate and impact signiﬁcantly on the water. For
instance, chironomid larvae, which feed on sewage, may in turn be fed to ﬁsh with water
quality improvement as an additional beneﬁt [21].
Vertebrates play key roles in the functioning of Living Technologies. With an estimated
22,000 species, ﬁshes are the most numerous and diverse of the vertebrates. In diet, behavior,
habitat, and function, ﬁsh are extraordinarily diverse. Filter- and detritus-feeding ﬁsh are
common to all the continents. The ﬁltration rate of algivorous ﬁsh may be ﬁve orders of
magnitude greater than their volume every day [21]. In theory it is possible for the total
volume of a ﬁshpond to pass through algae-ﬁltering ﬁsh on a daily basis. There are edible ﬁsh
species like the Central American characin, Brycon guatemalensis, which are capable of
shredding and ingesting tough and woody materials. Members of the South American
690
Y.-T. Hung et al.

armored catﬁsh family Plecostomidae may be used to control sludge buildup in waste
treatment and as food in culture Living Technologies as well. Tilapia, Oreochromis spp.,
may be used to harvest small plants like duckweed and aquatic ferns. In several Living
Machines minnows, including the golden shiner, Notemigonus crysoleucas, and fathead
minnow, Pimephales promelas, feed on organic debris and rotting aquatic vegetation. They
breed among rafted higher plants grown on the surface of the water. Excess minnows may be
sold as bait ﬁsh. Therefore, research into the aquarium and ichthyologic literature will be
valuable to ecological engineers [21].
3.3. Photosynthetic Communities
Ecological engineering was founded on recognition of the role of sunlight and photosyn-
thesis. By way of contrast, algae and higher plants are seen in civil engineering as nuisance
organisms to be eliminated physically and chemically from the treatment process. Contem-
porary intensive aquaculture takes a similar view. The ecosystem-based solar aquaculture
developed at the New Alchemy Institute in the 1970s and its successors constitute an
exception to this trend [21]. Algae-based waste treatment systems were pioneered by Oswald
(1988) and Lincoln and Earle (1990) in the USA, Fallowﬁeld and Garrett (1985) in the UK,
Shelef et al. (1980) in Israel, and a host of scientists in China and India (Ghosh, 1991). In these
systems ﬂoating higher aquatic plants are used in a variety of waste treatment approaches. For
instance, the use of emergent marsh plants and engineered marsh-based systems for waste
treatment has gained prominence and technical sophistication over the last few decades.
Notably, employing plant diversity can produce Living Technologies that require less energy,
aeration, and chemical management. Root zones are superb micro-sites for bacterial commu-
nities. There has been, for instance, observed enhanced nitriﬁcation in treatment cells covered
with pennywort, Hydrocotyle umbellata, and water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes, as com-
pared with comparable cells devoid of higher plants. Some plants sequester heavy metals. One
such species of mustard, Brassica juncea, has been found to remove metals from ﬂowing
waste streams and accumulating up to 60 % of its dry weight as lead. Metals can subsequently
be recovered from harvested, dried, and burned plants. Apart from metal sequestering, certain
species of higher plants such as Mentha aquatica produce antimicrobial compounds or
antibiotics that may kill certain human pathogens. Such plants are vital as components of
the Living Technology design. Besides pollution reductions or mitigations, there is economic
potential of plants from Living Machines. Flowers, medical herbs, and trees used in
rhizoﬁltration in a waste treatment facility may subsequently be sold as by-products. For
example, the Frederick, Maryland, Living Machine sewage treatment facility produces
horticultural crops for the water gardening industry [21].
3.4. Nutrient and Micronutrient Reservoirs
Carbon/nitrogen/phosphorus ratios need to be regulated and maintained. A full comple-
ment of macro and trace elements needs to be in the system so that complex food matrices can
be established and allowed to “explore” a variety of successive strategies over time. This will
support biological diversity. In designing Living Machines, mineral diversity should include
Living Machines
691

igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. With a rich mineral base, they should support a
wide variety of biological combinations and give the systems greater capacity to self-design
and optimize. While mineral diversity provides the long-term foundation for nutrient diver-
sity, in the near term microorganisms and plants require nutrients in an available form. If
carbon is recalcitrant, or phosphorus in n insoluble state, or the NPK ratios are out of balance,
or trace elements are missing, the ecosystems can become impoverished. There should,
therefore, be a system to replenish the Living Machine of its vital nutrients. As a general
rule, it is preferable that use is made of organic and rock-based amendments to correct
imbalances and kelp meal for trace minerals and potassium [21].
4. TYPES OF LIVING MACHINES OR RESTORERS
4.1. Constructed Wetlands
Natural wetland systems have often been described as the “earth’s kidneys” because they
ﬁlter pollutants from water that ﬂows through on its way to receiving lakes, streams, and
oceans. For the reason that these systems can improve water quality, engineers and scientists
construct systems that replicate the functions of natural wetlands. Constructed wetlands are
accordingly deﬁned as treatment systems or Living Machines that use natural processes
involving wetland vegetation, soils, and their associated microbial assemblages to improve
water quality [31]. The concept of using constructed wetlands for the treatment of wastewater
has evolved from years of observing the high water quality inherent to natural wetlands,
despite contaminated efﬂuent. This natural process has been simulated in constructed wet-
lands, which are designed to take advantage of many of the same processes that occur in
natural wetlands, but accomplish them within a more controlled environment. Some of these
systems have been designed and operated with the sole purpose of treating wastewater, while
others have been implemented with multiple-use objectives in mind, such as using treated
wastewater efﬂuent as a water source for the creation and restoration of wetland habitat for
wildlife use and environmental enhancement. Moreover, constructed wetlands also control
pollutants in surface runoff, create wildlife habitat, and add aesthetic value [31, 32].
In general, these systems should be engineered and constructed in uplands and outside
ﬂoodplains in order to avoid damage to natural wetlands and other aquatic resources, unless
the source water can be used to restore a degraded or former wetland. The degree of wildlife
habitat provided by constructed treatment wetlands, or sections of these wetlands, varies
broadly across a spectrum. At one end of the spectrum are those systems that are intended only
to provide treatment for an efﬂuent or other water source, in order to meet the requirements of
the Clean Water Act (CWA), and these provide little or no wildlife habitat. At the other end
are those systems that are intended to provide water reuse, wildlife habitat, and public use,
while also providing a ﬁnal polishing function for a pretreated efﬂuent or other water source.
By harnessing and encouraging the complex ecologies present in these natural treatment
systems, constructed wetlands can provide basic or advanced treatment for organic nutrient
loads [31, 33]. There are many advantages of using constructed wetlands in treatment of water
pollution. (a) Constructed wetlands provide simple, low energy, low-maintenance alternatives
692
Y.-T. Hung et al.

to conventional treatment methods. Accordingly, constructed wetlands can be integrated into
a complete system including pretreatment, disinfection, and reuse. Options for reuse include
subsurface irrigation, washdown water, toilet ﬂushing, and industrial use. Besides,
constructed wetlands can stand alone or function as an upgrade to conventional systems.
(b) Constructed wetlands reduce residual wastewater sludges that typically require disposal
and they are passive and exhibit reliable performance with minimal maintenance and oper-
ational costs, (c) they are simple to operate and simple to construct, (d) they can be operated
year-round except in the coldest climates, and e) they can provide wildlife habitat, sites for
wildlife observation, and environmental education.
There are two types of constructed wetlands [32]: subsurface ﬂow system (SFS) and free
water surface (FWS). Subsurface ﬂow systems are designed to create subsurface ﬂow through
a permeable medium, keeping the water being treated below the surface, thereby helping to
avoid the development of odors and other nuisance problems. Such systems have also been
referred to as “root-zone systems,” “rock-reed ﬁlters,” and “vegetated submerged bed sys-
tems.” The media used (typically soil, sand, gravel, or crushed rock) greatly affect the
hydraulics of the system. Free water surface systems, on the other hand, are designed to
simulate natural wetlands, with the water ﬂowing over the soil surface at shallow depths. Both
types of wetlands treatment systems typically are constructed in basins or channels with a
natural or constructed subsurface barrier to limit seepage. Constructed wetland treatment
systems have diverse applications and are found across the USA and around the world. While
they can be designed to accomplish a variety of treatment objectives, for the most part,
subsurface ﬂow systems are designed and operated in a manner that provides limited
opportunity for beneﬁts other than water quality improvement. On the other hand, free
water surface systems are frequently designed to maximize wetland habitat values and
reuse opportunities while providing water quality improvement [32].
The operations of constructed wetlands follow the same principle as other Living Tech-
nologies. Treatment of dissolved biodegradable material in wastewater is achieved through
the synergistic work involving decomposing microorganisms, which are living on the exposed
surfaces of the aquatic plants and soils, plants species, as well as various animal species.
Decomposers such as bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes are active in any wetland, breaking
down dissolved and particulate organic material to carbon dioxide and water. This active
decomposition in the wetland produces ﬁnal efﬂuents with a characteristic low dissolved
oxygen level with low pH [32]. The efﬂuent from a constructed wetland usually has a low
BOD as a result of this high level of decomposition. Aquatic plants, on the other hand, play an
important part in supporting these removal processes through such mechanisms as pumping
atmospheric oxygen into their submerged stems, roots, and tubers. The oxygen is then utilized
by the microbial decomposers attached to the aquatic plants below the level of the water.
Plants also play an active role in taking up nitrogen, phosphorus, and other compounds from
the wastewater. This active incorporation of nitrogen and phosphorus can be one mechanism
for nutrient removal in a wetland. Some of the nitrogen and phosphorus is released back into
the water as the plants die and decompose. In the case of nitrogen, much of the nitrate nitrogen
can be converted to nitrogen gas through denitriﬁcation processes in the wetland [32]. While
the use of wetlands is a promising idea, there are several potential obstacles. To be effective
Living Machines
693

these wetlands require a large land area. In addition, wastewater added to wetlands must be
pretreated to remove solids, reducing the energetic saving. Another problem is that in
temperate climates these marshes exhibit reduced functionality for much of the year [32].
4.2. Lake Restorers
Restorers are an assembly of engineered ecologies incorporated into ﬂoating rafts. Restorer
Technology is borrowed from an analogous component in nature known as the ﬂoating island,
which is formed as dense mats of vegetation. Typically they are made up of cattails, bulrush,
sedge, and reeds, which normally extend outward from shoreline wetlands. As the water gets
deeper and the roots no longer reach the bottom, this vegetation uses the oxygen in their root
mass for buoyancy, while the surrounding vegetation provides support that is crucial for
retaining their top-side-up orientation. Moreover, the area beneath these ﬂoating mats is
exceptionally rich in aquatic biota. Eventually, storm events may tear whole sections free
from the shore. These resultant ﬂoating islands migrate around a lake with changing winds,
occasionally reattaching to a new area of the shoreline, or breaking up in heavy weather [34].
Unlike the natural ﬂoating islands, Lake Restorers are construction that involves making
rafts or wire cages that can ﬂoat on water. They are then planted with different species of
plants, which later provide habitats to various micro- and macroorganisms. Efﬁcient airlift
pumps and ﬁne-bubble air diffusion systems incorporated in the design of Restorers add
oxygen to the water as well as circulate water and nutrients over the Restorer’s biological
surfaces to stimulate the natural healing process. It is the complete body of water that treats
itself. The resultant rafted ﬂoating ecologies can treat wastewater, assist in the upgrade of
outdated and overloaded facultative lagoons, suppress algal growth, or help maintain the
health of ponds and lakes. These diverse “ﬂoating islands” are installed in new or existing
lagoons and ponds to provide a simple, robust, and beautiful method of treating waste and
cleaning up polluted waters. The robustness of Restorers lies on the utilization of the widely
recognized beneﬁts of ﬁxed bioﬁlms to accelerate the natural processes found in a river, lake,
pond, or constructed lagoon by:
(a)
Introducing oxygen and circulation to the stressed environment that often lacks sufﬁcient oxygen-
rich surface areas necessary to maintain a balanced ecology
(b)
Utilizing native higher plants and artiﬁcial media as bioﬁlm substrate to support rich microbial,
algae, and animal communities

4.3. Eco-Restorers
Eco-Restorers, unlike Lake Restorers, are more expensive to construct yet less energy
efﬁcient to operate. These systems, many of which were originally built under the name
“Living Machines,” are ideal for situations either where there is very little land available or
where a signiﬁcant element of visitor interest and interpretation is required [34]. In 1995
694
Y.-T. Hung et al.

Jonathon Porritt opened Europe’s ﬁrst Eco-Restorer System—a Living Machine*—at the
Findhorn Foundation. This ecologically engineered plant is designed to treat sewage from the
population of up to 300 people living at the Findhorn Foundation and provides a research and
educational facility to promote this technology throughout Europe. Diverse communities of
bacteria, algae, microorganisms, numerous species of plants and trees, snails, ﬁsh, and other
living creatures interact as whole ecologies in tanks and bioﬁlters. In this Living Machine
system, anaerobically treated sewage ﬂows into a greenhouse containing a series of tanks.
These tanks contain species which breakdown the sewage naturally as it moves through. In
many systems there are by-products of ﬁsh and plants being produced that can then be sold.
Living Machines mirror processes that occur in the natural world but more intensively. At the
end of the series of tanks, the resulting water is pure enough to be recycled. The technology
not only is capable of meeting tough new sewage outﬂow standards but uses no chemicals and
has a relatively inexpensive capital cost attached.
A typical design of an Eco-Restorer, using the Findhorn example, has ﬁve major compo-
nents, which are housed in a single-span greenhouse, approximately 10 m wide by 30 m long.
They comprise the anaerobic septic tanks, closed aerobic reactor, open aerobic reactors, the
clariﬁers, and the ecological ﬂuidized beds (EFBs). This Living Machine at Findhorn receives
about 60 m3 wastewater per day for treatment. The raw wastewater is received in the ﬁrst
component of the system: the anaerobic septic tanks. Typically, three [3] anaerobic bio-
reactors are buried outside the greenhouse, and their function is to reduce signiﬁcantly the
organic material and inorganic solids in the wastewater. The absence of oxygen in the
wastewater promotes the growth of anaerobic and facultative bacterial populations. After
the anaerobic digestion, the efﬂuent from the anaerobic tanks ﬂows into a closed aerobic tank
in the greenhouse. Air is introduced through ﬁne-bubble diffusers to convert the wastewater
from an anaerobic to an aerobic state. Gases from the closed aerobic tank pass through an air
ﬁlter system to eliminate odors. After this treatment, the efﬂuent moves the open aerobic
reactors. The Living Machine at Findhorn has four aerobic tanks containing diaphragm
aerators, and each is planted with plant species with large root masses on ﬂoating plant
racks. The BOD and TSS are reduced at this stage and ammonia is nitriﬁed. The primary
function of the plants is to provide favorable environments for enhanced microbial activity.
Bacteria and other microorganisms attach themselves to the large surface area of submerged
plant roots. These attached bioﬁlms contribute signiﬁcantly to the treatment process. The
secondary plant functions include nutrient removal, metal sequestering, pathogen destruction,
and some control of gas exchanges. The main objective is to have a healthy and diverse
sequence of ecosystems present. The wide variety of plant species ﬁlling ecological niches in
the system is a key to the robust nature of natural treatment systems. The ecological network
of species creates internal biological redundancies compared with a purely microbial system
or a monoculture duckweed system. This gives the potential for improved efﬁciency and
greater resilience. Despite the efﬁciency of both microorganisms and plants, the efﬂuent from
the open aerobic tanks still contains some un-degraded suspended solids. The solids kept in
suspension in the aerobic tanks are removed in the clariﬁer. The clariﬁer is a settling tank with
cone-shaped bottom. The suspended solids settle at the bottom of the tank and are returned to
the anaerobic primary tanks. In the clariﬁer tanks you may see tiny water creatures such as
Living Machines
695

Cyclops living in the water. They perform an important part in both treatment and in creating
a complex food chain. The clariﬁed efﬂuent now is set to enter a ﬁnal phase of treatment by
the ecological ﬂuidized beds (EFBs).
The ecological ﬂuidized beds in each train are ﬁlled with light rock media. For aerobic
operation, airlift pumps raise the water from the bottom of the ﬂuidized bed to the surface,
where the water ﬂows down through the bed. Recycle rates can be varied up to 100 times the
ﬂow rate through the component. The aerobic operation provides reductions in BOD and TSS
and nitriﬁcation. For the anaerobic operation of the ﬂuidized beds for denitriﬁcation, mechan-
ical pumps circulate water up through the bed. The ﬂuidized beds are planted and benthic
animals graze the surface. The ﬁrst ﬂuidized bed is usually run aerobically to nitrify any
remaining ammonia in the waste stream. The second ﬂuidized bed can be run anaerobically to
denitrify. The third and ﬁnal ﬂuidized bed is run for ﬁnal denitriﬁcation and polishing. The
underlying concept behind the design involves rapid ﬂows of water by recycling through the
media-ﬁlled zones. The key attributes of an ecological ﬂuidized bed are stable high surface
area microenvironment sites for bacteria, ultrarapid exchanges across biological surfaces,
directNHþ
4 /NO
3 uptake, nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation cycles, the support of higher plant life
and root systems within the media and in the aquatic environments, and self-cleaning. The
biology is managed as a balanced ecosystem. The levels of dissolved oxygen, and carbon to
nitrogen ratios, as well as recycle rates and bioaugmentation, are adjusted with the overall
objective of reducing levels of BOD, ammonia (NH3), total nitrogen (TN), fecal coliform, and
solids. Information on the efﬁciency of the Restorer system/Living Machine at Findhorn
showed that the system treats sewage to advanced wastewater treatment (tertiary) standard.
Speciﬁcally, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), total Kjeldahl
nitrogen in water (TKN), ammonium (NHþ
4 ), nitrate (NO
3 ), and total phosphorous (TP)
which were 250, 160, 40, 50, 10, and 7 mg/L, respectively, before treatment. After treatment,
the efﬂuent quality become 10 mg/L for BOD, TSS, and TKN, 2 mg/L for NHþ
4 , 5 mg/L for
NO
3 and 5 mg/L for TP [34].
4.4. Reedbeds
Reedbeds are natural systems, which are ideal for treatments on small scale or where there
are no land restrictions. They are cost-effective to install and simple and inexpensive to run.
They do however take up larger areas of land than Restorers. Currently there are several
different alternative designs: (a) horizontal ﬂow reedbeds (HFR)—in this design the waste-
water is fed in and ﬂows slowly through the bed in a horizontal path below the surface until it
reaches the outlet zone. Here, it is collected before leaving via the level control arrangement at
the outlet. As it ﬂows, the wastewater comes into contact with a network of aerobic, anoxic,
and anaerobic zones. The reed rhizomes open up the bed to provide new hydraulic pathways.
(b) Vertical ﬂow reedbeds (VFR)—these systems are often used to reduce on-site sludge
production. The sludge is added to the reedbed and is degraded in the oxygen-rich environ-
ment by the plant roots. (c) Pond and reedbed systems (PRS)—the pond and reedbed systems
are individually designed, robust, and self-maintaining and can treat domestic, municipal,
agricultural, and industrial wastewater to very high standards. They consist of a series of
696
Y.-T. Hung et al.

shallow outdoor ponds, fringed with various species of emergent plants, and are linked by
areas of aggregate-ﬁlled constructed wetland. These systems can be built for as few as 5 and
as many as 3,000 people. Land requirements are approximately 10 m2 per person equivalent,
depending on conditions [34].
5. PRINCIPLE UNDERLYING THE CONSTRUCTION
OF LIVING MACHINES
As has been pointed out above (Sect. 2), Living Machines construction relies on the
principles of ecology, and the resultant technological innovations, deﬁned broadly as
advanced ecologically engineered systems (AEES), are being considered for application to
number of problem areas. Potential applications include a) the replacement of or provision of
designs of ecological systems (ecotechnology) as alternatives to man-made/energy-intensive
systems to meet various human needs (e.g., constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment);
b) the restoration of damaged ecosystems and the mitigation of development activities; c) the
management, utilization, and conservation of natural resources; and d) the integration of
society and ecosystems in built environments (e.g., in landscape architecture, urban planning,
and urban horticulture applications). These potential applications govern or offer a basis for
the underlying principles for the construction of Living Technologies. Bergen and coworkers
summarize these principles into ﬁve general principles to guide those practicing ecological
engineering in any context or ecosystem [35]. There are speciﬁcally ﬁve principles governing
the construction of Living Machines which are here below brieﬂy explored.
5.1. Living Machine Design to Be Consistent with Ecological Principles
This principle emphasizes the importance of understanding the characteristics and behav-
iors of the natural systems. The designs accordingly produced with regard to, and taking
advantage of, the characteristic behavior of natural systems shall be most successful. Also
notable is the fact that when natural structures and processes are included and mimicked, then
nature is treated as a partner in design and not as an obstacle to be overcome and dominated.
This is because the capacity of ecosystems to self-organize is recognized and put into use.
Mitsch and Jørgensen state that it is this “capability of ecosystems that allows nature to do
some of the “engineering” and that ecological engineers participate as choice generators and
as a facilitator of matching environments with ecosystems, but nature does the rest.” The key
attributes of an ecosystem that allow for self-organization are complexity and diversity.
Ecosystems can be complex structurally and in the temporal and spatial scales of processes.
Signiﬁcant ecological changes are often episodic, and critical processes, which occur at rates
spread over several orders of magnitude, but clustered around a few dominant. Ecosystems
are also heterogeneous, displaying patchy and discontinuous textures at all scales and do not
function around a single stable equilibrium. They are rather deﬁned by the functionally
different states, which are created from the “destabilizing forces far from equilibria, multiple
equilibria, and/or absence of equilibria deﬁne, and movement between states. These maintain
structure and diversity of the ecosystems.” The structure and diversity produced by the large
Living Machines
697

functional space occupied by ecosystems is what allows them to remain healthy or to persist.
The large functional space required for sustainable ecosystems is directly at odds with
traditional engineering design practices that create systems that operate close to a single,
chosen equilibrium point. Another important characteristic of ecosystems is that the outputs
of one process serve as the inputs to others. No waste is generated and nutrients are cycled
from one trophic level to the next. In constructing Living Machines, this concept should be
well understood. A ﬁnal characteristic of natural systems is that they tend to function near the
edge of chaos or instability. Designing systems to include ecological characteristics would,
therefore, depart from common engineering practice. Designing for ecological rather than
engineering resilience would mean encouraging diversity and complexity, while allowing
systems to self-organize, mature, and evolve. How to design systems to perform like ecosys-
tems and still function as desired is explored in the remaining principles [35].
5.2. Living Machine Design to Deal with Site-Speciﬁc Situation
The complexity and diversity of natural systems cause a high degree of spatial variability.
While the ecological characteristics discussed above are generally applicable, every system
and location is different. The second principle suggests that one has to gain as much
information as possible about the environment in which a design solution ought to function.
Furthermore, the spatial variability rules out standardized designs, which means that the
solutions should be site speciﬁc and small scale. Standardized designs imposed on the
landscape without consideration for the ecology of a place will take more energy to sustain.
In addition, knowledge of the place also allows for more holistic designs. Such design takes
into account both the upstream and downstream effects of design decisions. For upstream
issues such as what resources must be imported and appropriated to create and maintain a
solution are considered while for downstream the site-speciﬁc and off-site impacts of the
design on the environment are considered. In addition to the physical context of a design,
knowledge of the cultural context is important. Designs are more likely to succeed and to be
accepted by the local community when the people who live in a place are included in the
design process. They bring knowledge of the particularities of a place and are empowered
through direct participation in shaping their environment. Attention to group dynamics and
conﬂict mediation is important for successful stakeholder participation [35].
5.3. Living Machine Design to Maintain the Independence
of Its Functional Requirements
Ecological complexity adds high and often irreducible levels of uncertainty to the design
process. Even under conditions of certainty, the amount of relevant information in possession
may be overwhelming and often unmanageable, yet it is desirous that the solutions are kept
simple and workable. Under these circumstances a strategy for dealing with such uncertainty
would be to set the tolerances on the design functional requirements as wide as possible. The
third principle, which is a restatement of the ﬁrst design axiom of Suh (1990), entails that the
“functional requirements (FRs),” which are the speciﬁc functions that a design solution is
required to provide, are satisﬁed, individually, by the “design parameters (DPs).” This means
698
Y.-T. Hung et al.

that the design parameters are the physical elements of the solution chosen to satisfy FRs.
Therefore, best designs are those that have independent (not coupled) FRs and one and only
one DP to satisfy each FR. Consequently, when modifying one DP affects more than one FR,
then a design is described as being coupled. In these circumstances, wide tolerances on FRs
can make the design essentially uncoupled. This is so because wide design tolerances allow a
larger functional range for a system while the outputs remain within acceptable ranges.
However, when interacting with ecological systems, the concept of functional independence
becomes a lot less clear. This is so because ecosystems are complex with many levels of
interconnection between components, which means that many elements of the system may be
involved in more than one process. Since ecosystems can function and provide beneﬁts to
society without human intervention, the design FRs are incorporated or considered in any
undertaking of Living Technology designs to satisfy unmet human needs. Therefore, the FRs
for design follow from the statement of these needs, while the ecosystem processes that are in
existence and their preservation needed while designing for unmet needs, act as constraints on
design. Although the independence principle predicts that successful designs may be obtained
when the FRs are kept uncoupled in the solution, in reality, however, it would be foolish not to
take advantage of the multiple, coupled services an ecosystem can provide [35].
5.4. Living Machine Design to Enhance Efﬁciency in Energy and Information
The fourth principle follows from taking advantage of the self-organizing property of
ecosystems. To let nature do some of the engineering means that the free ﬂow of energy into
the system from natural sources, primarily the Sun, should be put to maximum use. At the
same time the energy expended to create and maintain the system directed, by design, from
off-site sources, such as fossil fuels and large-scale hydroelectric sources, should be mini-
mized. While utilizing free-ﬂowing energy, however, it is important to follow where the
energy would go without intervention, to make sure that it is not more critically needed
downstream and that there is minimal adverse impact. This could be achieved by keeping the
information content of the design to the minimum or simply stated making designs simple yet
successful. For example, the energy input needed to restrict a stream channel to a conﬁned
space tends to be high and ultimately fails when a large ﬂood occurs. A better design would
recognize the expected variability in stream ﬂows, and the system would be designed to
withstand large variations in ﬂow (wide tolerance) yet still maintain its ecological and
engineering functions, i.e., minimizing information content. In this way the extra information
required would be balanced by utilizing self-organization and wide tolerances. In other words,
this can be considered as an up-front capital investment in diversity that would gain overall
efﬁciency later through reduced energy requirements and a reduced risk of failure. Therefore,
diversity provides insurance against uncertainty in addition to contributing to ecological
resilience. In the case of an engineered wetland, for example, a wide range of species may
be included in the initial construction, but natural processes are allowed to select those best
suited for the imposed environment. Similarly, the ﬁrst and second principles advocate an
up-front investment in knowledge of the design context to minimize uncertainty and to allow
less information to be transferred during design implementation [35].

5.5. Living Machine Design to Acknowledge and Retain Its Values
and Purposes
The major goal of Living Technologies is the provision of ecologically oriented designs
that would beneﬁt both society and the natural environment. Moreover, most engineering
codes of ethics state at least that engineers have a responsibility to serve and protect society.
From an ecological engineering perspective, this code has been explicitly broadened to
include the responsibility of sustaining the natural systems that support life. Regardless of
speciﬁc ideology, however, design practices that acknowledge the motivating values and
purposes would be more successful. Recall that the third principle recommends using wide
tolerances under conditions of uncertainty. Consequently, it follows that a precautionary
approach for ecological engineering is ought to be adopted at all times. A precautionary
approach should act as a form of insurance against unpleasant surprises in the future. In Living
Technologies innovations, classical engineering should be applied sparingly, and complex
solutions avoided where possible. Furthermore, design solutions that are both fail-safe and
safe-fail should be pursued to avoid catastrophic failures. As opposed to traditional fail-safe
approaches, safe-fail solutions acknowledge that our original functional requirements for a
design may not be met or that there may be unexpected results. Failure in this case is not
catastrophic. Therefore, in selecting the design, alternatives that have the best worst-case
outcome should be advocated for [35].
6. OPERATION OF LIVING MACHINES
The operationalization of the Living Machine technology relies on the incorporation of
plants and animals in many of the same basic processes (e.g., sedimentation, ﬁltration,
clariﬁcation, adsorption, nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation, volatilization, and anaerobic and
aerobic decomposition) that are used in conventional biological treatment systems. A typical
Living Machine comprises six principle treatment components: (1) an anaerobic reactor,
(2) an anoxic tank, (3) a closed aerobic reactor, (4) aerobic reactors, (5) a clariﬁer, and
(6) “ecological ﬂuidized beds” (EFBs) (Fig. 14.1a). While the open aerobic reactors and EFBs
are found in almost all Living Machines, the other components are not always utilized in the
treatment process. The speciﬁc components used are selected by the designers depending
upon the characteristics of the wastewater to be treated and the treatment objectives. Some-
times additional process components may be added if considered necessary by the
designers [36].
Anaerobic Reactor (Step 1)
In case it is incorporated into the treatment process, the anaerobic reactor serves as the
initial step of the process. The reactor, which is similar in appearance and operation to a septic
tank, reduces the concentrations of BOD5 and solids in the wastewater prior to treatment by
the other components of the process. Raw inﬂuent enters the reactor, which acts as a primary
sedimentation basin. Some of the anaerobic reactors used have an initial sludge blanket zone,
followed by a second zone for clariﬁcation. Additionally, strips of plastic mesh netting are
700
Y.-T. Hung et al.

sometimes used in the clariﬁcation zone to assist with the trapping and settling of solids, and
to provide surface area for the colonization of anaerobic bacteria, which help to digest the
solids. Sludge is typically removed periodically via perforated pipes on the bottom of the
reactor and wasted to a reedbed or other biosolids treatment processes. Gases produced are
passed through an activated carbon ﬁlter or bioﬁlter for odor control [36].
Anoxic Reactor (Step 2)
The primary purpose of the anoxic reactor is to promote growth of ﬂoc-forming microor-
ganisms, which will remove a signiﬁcant portion of the incoming BOD5. The anoxic reactor is
mixed and has controlled aeration to prevent anaerobic conditions and to encourage ﬂoc-
forming and denitrifying microorganisms. Mixing is accomplished through aeration by a
coarse bubble diffuser. These diffusers are typically operated so that dissolved oxygen is
Fig. 14.1. (a) This illustrates the operational setup and components of the Living Machine®:
(1) anaerobic reactor, (2) anoxic reactor, (3) closed aerobic reactor, (4) open aerobic reactors,
(5) clariﬁer, and (6) “ecological ﬂuid bed”. (b) This illustrates the operational setup of the open
aerobic tanks of the Living Machine in South Burlington, VT. A series of tanks in a greenhouse are
shown (Adapted from US Environment Protection Agency Fact Sheet, 2002).

701

maintained below 0.4 mg/L. The space over the reactor is vented through an odor control
device, which is usually a planted bioﬁlter. In addition, an attached growth medium may be
placed in the compartment to facilitate growth of bacteria and other microorganisms. Settled
biosolids from the clariﬁer (Step 5) and nitriﬁed process water from the ﬁnal open aerobic
reactor (Step 4) are recycled back into this reactor. The purpose of these recycles is to provide
sufﬁcient carbon sources to the anoxic reactor to support denitriﬁcation without using
supplemental chemicals, such as methanol [36].
Closed Aerobic Reactor (Step 3)
The purpose of the closed aerobic reactor is to reduce the dissolved wastewater BOD5 to
low levels, to remove further odorous gases, and to stimulate nitriﬁcation. Aeration and
mixing in this reactor are provided by ﬁne-bubble diffusers. Odor control is again achieved
by using a planted bioﬁlter. This bioﬁlter typically sits directly over the reactor and is planted
with vegetation intended to control moisture levels in the ﬁlter material.
Open Aerobic Reactors (Step 4)
Next in the process train are the open aerobic reactors or aerated tanks. They are similar to
the closed aerobic reactor in design and mechanics (i.e., aeration is provided by ﬁne-bubble
diffusers); however, instead of being covered with a bioﬁlter, the surfaces of these reactors are
covered with vegetation supported by racks. These plants serve to provide surface area for
microbial growth, perform nutrient uptake, and can serve as a habitat for beneﬁcial insects and
microorganisms. With the variety of vegetation present in these reactors, these units (along
with the ecological ﬂuidized beds—Step 6) set the Living Machine apart from other treatment
systems in terms of their unique appearance and aesthetic appeal (Fig. 14.1b). The aerobic
reactors are designed to reduce BOD5 to better than secondary levels and to complete the
process of nitriﬁcation. The size and number of these reactors used in a Living Machine
design are determined by inﬂuent characteristics, efﬂuent requirements, ﬂow conditions, and
the design water and air temperatures [36].
Clariﬁer (Step 5)
The clariﬁer is basically a settling tank that allows remaining solids to separate from the
treated wastewater. The settled solids are pumped back to the closed aerobic reactor (Step 3),
or they are transferred to a holding tank and then removed for disposal. The surface of the
clariﬁer is often covered with duckweed, which prevents algae from growing in the reactor.
Ecological Fluidized Beds (Step 6)
The ﬁnal step in the typical Living Machine process is the “ecological ﬂuidized beds”
(EFBs). These are polishing ﬁlters that perform ﬁnal treatment of the wastewater, and one to
three are used in series to reduce BOD5, TSS, and nutrients to meet ﬁnal efﬂuent require-
ments. An EFB consists of both an inner and outer tank. The inner tank contains an attached
growth medium, such as crushed rock, lava rock, or shaped plastic pieces. The wastewater
ﬂows into the EFB in the annular space between the inner and outer tanks and is raised by air
lift pipes to the top of the inner ring that contains the media. The bottom of the inner tank is
not sealed, so the wastewater percolates through the gravel media and returns to the outer
annular space, from where it is again moved back to the top of the gravel bed. The air lifts also
702
Y.-T. Hung et al.

serve to aerate the water and maintain aerobic conditions. The unit serves as a ﬁxed bed,
downﬂow, granular media ﬁlter and separates particulate matter from the water. Additionally,
the microorganisms that occupy the granular media surfaces provide any ﬁnal nitriﬁcation
reactions. As sludge collects on the EFB, it reduces its ability to ﬁlter. This would eventually
clog the bed completely. Therefore, additional aeration diffusers beneath the gravel bed are
periodically turned on to create an upﬂow airlift, reversing the ﬂow direction. This aeration is
intended to “ﬂuidize” the bed and release the trapped sludge (hence the name of this unit).
This sludge is washed over and accumulated at the bottom of the outer annular space where it
can be collected manually and wasted along with the biosolids from the anaerobic reactor.
Consequently, the name “ecological ﬂuidized bed” is somewhat misleading for this unit since,
in its treatment mode, it acts like a typical, conventional, downﬂow coarse media contact ﬁlter
unit. Only during backwash cleaning does the bed become partially ﬂuidized. After this last
step, the wastewater should be suitable for discharge to surface waters or a subsurface disposal
system or reused for landscape irrigation, toilet ﬂushing, vehicle washing, etc. [36].
7. CASE STUDIES OF CONSTRUCTED LIVING MACHINE
SYSTEMS FOR BIOREMEDIATION, WASTEWATER TREATMENT,
AND WATER REUSE
7.1. Sewage Treatment in Cold Climates: South Burlington,
Vermont AEES, USA
Ocean Arks International, which is a not-for-proﬁt organization dedicated to the develop-
ment of ecological design and its implementation into society, in 1995 constructed a tank-
based “advanced ecologically engineered system” (AEES) or Living Machine in South
Burlington, Vermont, to determine if the technology is capable of treating sewage to high
standards in a northern New England climate, particularly during the cold and short
day-length seasons [17]. The AEES facility, housed within a 725 m2 (7,800 ft2) greenhouse,
contained two parallel treatment systems designed to treat 300 m3 per day (80,000 gal per
day) of sewage from the city of South Burlington to advanced tertiary wastewater standards
for 5-day carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5), total suspended solids (TSS),
total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia (NH3), nitrate (NO-
3), and total nitrogen (TN). The
performance target for removal of fecal coliforms in the system was 2,000 cfu/100 mL
without disinfection. The Vermont Living Machine was biologically diverse. Over 200 species
of vascular and woody plants were evaluated for their effectiveness and suitability for waste
treatment between 1995 and 2000. Plants were evaluated for (a) their ability to tolerate
sewage, (b) the extent of the root zones, (c) disease and pest resistance, (d) ease of manage-
ment, and (e) secondary economic value. The plants were physically supported on the surface
of the water by rigid plant racks designed to provide gentle ﬂow over the roots in a highly
aerated and turbulent surrounding environment. The system was designed to utilize microbial
communities attached to plant roots, as well as ﬂocculating bacteria in the open water to affect
treatment. Invertebrates including microcrustaceans and freshwater clams provided biological
ﬁltration, while snails and ﬁsh were incorporated into the design to digest residual biosolids.
Living Machines
703

The ﬂow was split between two 150 m3 per day (40,000 gal per day) treatment trains with a
hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2.9 days. The facility was started in December 1995,
operated at its design ﬂow capacity by May 1996, and was maintained at this steady state until
the end of 1999. Each treatment train comprised nine tanks connected in series and each tank
was 4.6 m wide  4.6 m deep (15 ft  15 ft). Raw efﬂuent entered and was mixed in an
anoxic reactor. To control odors normally associated with raw sewage, an ecological gas
scrubber, employing higher plants and a soil/bark/compost media, was mounted over the
anoxic reactor tank. The wastewater ﬂowed from the anoxic reactor into four aerobic reactors.
Dense plantings were maintained on surface racks. The waste then ﬂowed to a clariﬁer
covered with ﬂoating aquatic plants. Biosolids from the clariﬁer were recycled to the anoxic
reactor or wasted [17].
Downstream of the clariﬁer were three tanks containing ecological ﬂuidized beds (EFBs) in
series. The EFB in essence serves as a submerged trickling ﬁlter capable of supporting plants
mounted over an outer ring of open water. The media that comprises the inner part of the EFB
physically supports benthic organisms, including mollusks. Depending upon water quality
and their position in the series, the EFBs could be operated anoxically to aid denitriﬁcation or
aerobically for polishing and ﬁnal ﬁltration. The facility met and exceeded its design
parameters for CBOD5, TSS, TKN, NH3, NO3
-, and TN as well as fecal coliform bacteria.
A high level of performance was maintained even during the coldest months. In addition,
phosphorus design standards were also met, but the AEES technology has yet to demonstrate
phosphorus removal beyond what would be expected in a nitrifying activated sludge process.
One of the goals of the project was to grow organisms that not only provided treatment but
also had potential economic beneﬁts. Botanicals with economic value included young trees
such as Taxodium distichum L. (bald cypress), Zantedeschia aethiopica L. (calla lily), and
plants used for environmental remediation or wetland mitigation. Fish grown and harvested
from the system included Notemigonus crysoleucas M. (golden shiners) and other bait ﬁsh,
Pimephales promelas R. (fathead minnows), and ornamental ﬁsh including Carassius auratus
L. (goldﬁsh) and Japanese koi. All of the ﬁsh species fed upon organic material and plankton
produced internally within the facility. One of the most striking aspects of the Vermont
facility was its beauty. It remains a frequently visited educational facility and is currently
operated as a test facility for the treatment of different types of high-strength organic wastes
including brewery wastes. It is also a site where new economic by-products from both liquid
and solid waste conversion processes are being developed [17].
7.2. Environmental Restoration: Flax Pond, Harwich, Massachusetts, USA
The Flax Pond, which is a 15 acre (6 ha) pond in Harwich, Massachusetts, has for decades
been heavily impacted by leachates from an adjacent landﬁll and unlined septage holding
lagoons. By 1989, the pond was closed to recreation and ﬁshing because of contamination
caused by the daily intrusion of 295 m3 (78,000 gal) of leachate from the landﬁll [17, 37]. The
pond had low oxygen levels, high coliform counts, excessive sediment buildup, and organic
pollutants in the water column including volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Macrobenthic
organisms were absent from many of the bottom sampling stations. Flax Pond had unusually
704
Y.-T. Hung et al.

high sediment concentrations of total phosphorus (300 times greater) and iron (80 times
greater) compared with other Cape Cod ponds [17, 38]. Ammonia levels in the sediments
were found to be as high as 8000 mg/kg. The pond is delineated into an eastern zone and a
western zone, the cloudier eastern zone being the predominant zone of impact from the
landﬁll. The pond also had a maximum depth of 6 m and stratiﬁes in its western end. In the
autumn of 1992, construction of the ﬁrst ﬂoating Pond Restorer was completed and anchored
at the eastern end. It employed a windmill and solar panels for electrical generation and was
capable of circulating through its nine cells up to 380 m3 per day (100,000 gal per day) of
water drawn from the bottom of the pond. The ﬁrst three cells were ﬁlled with semi-buoyant
pumice rock that supported diverse benthic life including freshwater clams of the genera Unio
and Anodonta. Since phosphorus was limiting in the pond’s water column, a slow release form
of a clay-based soft phosphate was added to the EFB cells in the Restorer. Moreover, bacterial
augmentation and mineral enrichment in the ﬁrst three cells was routinely done. The ﬁnal six
cells supported over two-dozen species of terrestrial plants on racks. The Restorer was not
operated during the winter months to allow the pond to freeze completely.
The ﬁrst noticeable effect of the Restorer on the pond was the return of a positive oxygen
regime to the bottom. By 1995, the sediment depth throughout the pond had been reduced by an
average of 64 cm representing a total of 38,000 m3 of digested sediments. Between the years
1999 and 2001, dramatic changes in the sediments took place, including large reductions
(exceeding 50 %) in total phosphorus, ammonia, and TKN. However, total iron increased in the
western end and decreased slightly in the eastern end of the pond. Alkalinity followed a similar
pattern. The investigators could not establish which internal mechanisms were involved in the
changes in sediment phosphorus, although TKN reduction was with certainty associated with
nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation in the sediments (i.e., nitrates were below detectable limits in
all sediment samples in both 1999 and 2001). Water clarity and the overall health of the pond
have improved over the past decade, and biodiversity has increased [17].
7.3. Organic Industrial Wastewater Treatment from a Poultry-Processing
Waste in Coastal Maryland: Using Floating AEES Restorer
In the late 1990s, the design of the Pond Restorer used in Flax Pond evolved into a linear
AEES Restorer design for use on new and existing wastewater treatment lagoons. This
technology combines the beneﬁts of the small footprint AEES tank-based technology (Sect.
6.1) with the simplicity and efﬁciency of constructed wetlands. The ﬁrst large-scale waste-
water application of the ﬂoating AEES Restorer technology was installed in June 2001 on a
wastewater treatment lagoon that treats 3,785 m3 (1 million gallons per day) of high-strength
poultry-processing waste in coastal Maryland. The Restorers were installed in a 34,100 m3
(9 million gallon) storage lagoon downstream of a lagoon that had been run as a sequencing
batch reactor (SBR) for over 15 years [17].
Twelve Restorers run 43 m (140 ft) each across the lagoon and are secured from the banks
in multiple cells, creating a serpentine ﬂow pattern with ﬂoating bafﬂes. Twenty-ﬁve species
of native plants (25,000 individuals) were installed in plant racks on the outside edges of the
Restorers. The plants are a critical element in the technology. Their root system provides

surface areas and nutrient support for microbial communities, some nutrient uptake and they
shade/inhibit suspended algae in the lagoons. Water is treated in the open areas on each side of
the Restorers with ﬁne-bubble linear aerators installed at the bottom of the lagoon. The center
zones of the Restorers, with suspended fabric media, provide surface area for attachment and
growth of microbial communities and as such are submerged, aerobic, ﬁxed ﬁlm reactors. The
transition between the old SBR system and the new Restorer lagoon took place in October
2001. Although deﬁnitive quantitative data is not yet available, qualitative successes of the
project in these early stages are worth noting.
Since start-up of the Restorer system, efﬂuent standards have not exceeded state permit
levels. The electrical energy use in the lagoons has been reduced by approximately 74 %
compared to the former sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system [39, 40]. Energy reduction is
the result of higher biological reaction rates in the Restorer lagoon and the efﬁciency of the
new aeration design. Sludge has been trucked for 20 years from the poultry-processing plant
for land application at nearby farms. The sludge comes from a variety of locations within the
wastewater system, including the lagoons. Since installation of the Restorers the average
truckloads of sludge leaving the processing facility have decreased signiﬁcantly. This overall
sludge reduction is the direct result of reduced sludge coming from the Restorer lagoon.
Operation of the former SBR system required wasting of sludge for 8 h every day from the
lagoons. Following installation of the new Restorer system, sludge is wasted for approxi-
mately 1 h every few weeks. In addition, 45 Sludge Judge samples have been taken monthly
within the Restorer lagoon. Since August 2001 total sludge levels have decreased by approx-
imately 10 cm (4 in.). This decrease indicates that sludge degradation is faster than sludge
accumulation, even as the lagoon treats waste [17, 34].
7.4. Architectural Integration: Oberlin College, Ohio, USA
In recent decades architecture has begun to include ecologically designed systems within
structures for air puriﬁcation, humidity control, water reuse, waste treatment, and food
production. The bio-shelters developed by the Todds are being integrated in ecologically
designed systems for living and life support [41]. A number of new buildings are employing
ecologically engineered technologies for waste treatment, water reuse, and education includ-
ing the Ontario, Canada, Boyne River School, and the Kitchener/Waterloo YMCA rural
campus. The most recent of these is the Lewis Environmental Studies Center at Oberlin
College in Ohio. The building includes renewable energy, natural daylighting, and nontoxic
and recyclable materials. Within the structure is an AEES system or Living Machine for
sewage treatment and biological research. This system, similar to the Vermont AEES,
includes tanks connected in series and a constructed wetland within the building. The tanks
support a diverse community of tropical and temperate plants. The puriﬁed wastewater is
sterilized with UV before reuse in the toilets in the building. There is a growing interest in
redeﬁning the functioning of buildings in ecological terms. This is driving some architects
towards conceptualizing buildings as “organisms.” New light-transmitting designs and self-
regulating technologies optimize internal climates and support a diversity of ecological
elements within the buildings. Nature is increasingly being brought indoors for practical
and aesthetic reasons [17].

7.5. Tyson Foods at Berlin, Maryland, USA
The poultry-processing facility acquired by Tyson Foods at Berlin, Maryland, came with a
wastewater treatment system that was known to be the worst in the state. The major problem
with this system was that it discharged its contents to Chincoteague Bay, which is a protected
bay used for ﬁshing and harvesting crabs and scallops. Owing to its inability to comply with the
State of Maryland discharge standards, the downstream aquatic ecosystems could not be
protected. This one million gallon per day poultry-processing waste treatment system required
a wastewater treatment upgrade to meet efﬂuent treatment standards and to reduce energy costs
and the use of chemical treatment [34]. Ocean Arks International (OAI) installed such
Restorers. Adding Restorers to existing waste treatment lagoons provided a robust and ﬂexible
treatment option. In the modiﬁed treatment system, an existing aerated lagoon is maintained
with subsurface aeration only. At the beginning of this lagoon is an anoxic denitrifying cell.
Wastewater is polished in a 9 million gallon lagoon using 12 linear Restorers. The nitriﬁed
efﬂuent can be recycled back to the anoxic zone. This treatment method has reduced energy
input by 70–80 %. Twelve ﬂoating Restorers (2,100 ft2 each) were installed in the lagoon and
secured from the banks in four separate cells, created with suspended fabric bafﬂes. Water
ﬂows through the Restorer lagoon in a serpentine path to maximize treatment, gently aerated
and circulated by subsurface, ﬁne-bubble aeration. The wastewater is treated both beneath the
Restorers and in the open channels between them. The plant roots and the curtains of suspended
fabric media act as submerged, aerobic, ﬁxed ﬁlm reactors.
The biological design of the Restorers and their placement within the lagoon provides
diverse habitat (in the water column, sediments, and the Restorers) for a variety of microbial
communities, each of which performs an important function in the treatment process.
Approximately 25,000 plants of 25 species were planted on the Restorers, only a handful of
the 500 species that Ocean Arks has researched for use in wastewater treatment. Aquatic and
water-loving species native to the region were chosen for their treatment properties, their ease
of maintenance, and root mass area. The operation and maintenance of the Restorers is simple
and low in cost. Walkways provide access to the plants. In addition to the newly planted
diversity, several local plants as well as turtles have migrated into the system, creating a
unique self-organizing ecosystem.
7.6. Old Trail School, Bath, Ohio, USA
Old Trail School is an independent, coeducational day school for students aged toddler
through grade eight. The Living Machine system at the school is an advanced on-site wetland
system, composed of 3 different wetland processes which treat 5,000 gpd of wastewater. The
alternating anaerobic and aerobic cycles are effective to treat the school’s high-strength
sewage in a safe, attractive, and cost-effective manner [42, 43].
7.7. US-Mexico Border, San Diego, California, USA
The alternating anaerobic and aerobic Living Machine system treats 1,500 gpd of waste-
water at the busiest commercial Otay Mesa Land Port of Entry. The system provides not only
on-site wastewater treatment but also water reuse for the major facility [44].

7.8. US Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, California, USA
The US Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) in San Diego provides basic training for
over 21,000 recruits per year and has been recognized as one of the leading Department of
Defense facilities for implementing clean green technology. The on-site Living Machine
system recycles 10,000 gpd of wastewater for subsurface irrigation, minimizing its water
usage in drought-prone San Diego area [45].
7.9. San Francisco Public Utilities Commission Administration Building,
California, USA
A 13-story, 277,500 ft2 building generates its own energy through integrated solar panels
and wind turbines, treats 5,000 gpd wastewater using a Living Machine system, and recycles
all treated water for reuse. It can be seen that even in a dense urban area, it is possible to create
buildings, communities, and regions that are resilient, sustainable, and able to produce and
reuse valuable water resources on-site. The footprint of the San Francisco Living Machine
system is about 1,000 ft2 [46].
7.10. Esalen Institute, Big Sur, California, USA
Many educational institutions around the world are trying to conserve the water and protect
the environment [47-50]. For instance, the Esalen Institute, Big Sur, California, applies the
Tidal Flow Wetland Living Machine technology to treat its laundry and lodging facility
wastewaters and reuses the treated efﬂuent for subsurface irrigation. Alternatively, the treated
efﬂuent is discharged to its existing leach ﬁelds for recharging the groundwater [49].
7.11. Guilford County School District, California, USA
The Guilford County School District uses plant-based strategies to cleanse 30,600 gpd of
wastewater and produces enough clean water to irrigate 3 athletic ﬁelds. This environmentally
sound, on-site Living Machine system costs less than other pretreatment strategies and helps
to reduce the amount of nitrogen entering the watershed [50].
7.12. Las Vegas Regional Animal Campus, Nevada, USA
The Las Vegas Regional Animal Campus (RAC) serves the animal sheltering and adoption
needs in the region. The 5,000–10,000 gpd of wastewater is treated by a Tidal Flow Wetland
Living Machine system and reused for kennel washdown and other appropriate water
uses [51].
7.13. Port of Portland, Oregon, USA
The new headquarters ofﬁce facility for the Port of Portland has adopted the Living
Machine system as its showcase feature. The system includes a tiered series of wetland
cells supporting the growth of indoor landscaping and ornamental ﬂowers. It is designed to
treat all of the facility wastewater to a quality for reuse, including toilet ﬂushing and makeup
water for cooling towers [52, 53].

7.14. El Monte Sagrado Resort, Taos, New Mexico, USA
El Monte Sagrado Resort’s Living Machine system is designed to treat 4,000 gpd of
wastewater for producing a comprehensive design solution for a high desert resort. Waste-
water from kitchens and bathrooms is treated by the Living Machine system, is ﬁltered further
by a set of constructed wetlands, and ﬁnally ﬂows into the pond and waterfall. In addition,
storm water on the site is collected through an extensive system of roof gutters and under-
ground drainage pipes. Collected water is utilized to offset evaporative losses in a series of
four cascading trout ponds and small waterfalls that utilize physical and biological ﬁltration to
promote ﬂourishing and productive pond ecosystems. Rainwater is circulated in the irrigation
channels to support agricultural practices downstream [54].
8. FUTURE PROSPECTS OF LIVING MACHINES
8.1. Integration of Industrial and Agricultural Sectors: Proposed
Eco-Park in Burlington, Vermont, USA
Ecological design concepts are starting to be applied to the development of integrated
economic systems in an industrial context. A good example of one such system is the
development or construction of eco-industrial parks. An eco-industrial park has been deﬁned
as “a community of businesses that cooperate with each other, and with the local community, to
efﬁciently share resources (information, materials, water, energy, infrastructure and natural
habitat) leading to economic gains, improved environmental quality, and equitable enhance-
ment of human resources for business and local community” [55]. This idea is clearly
illustrated by the work pioneered by the city of Burlington and the Intervale Foundation
established the Intervale Community Enterprise Center (ICEC). The ICEC undertook to
develop a year-round, agriculturally based eco-park in a 280 ha ﬂood plain within Burlington’s
city limits. The eco-park would derive most of its energy from the utilization of waste heat
from the 53 MW McNeil power station. The project has brought together a number of allied
businesses including a brewery, several food processors, a restaurant, and a host of Intervale
growers and suppliers to the eco-park. The University of Vermont’s ecological design studio
would also be housed in the complex [17]. The structure that will support the project combines
greenhouses with a conventional light-manufacturing facility in a 3,800 m2 (40,900 ft2)
structure. The food culture team at Ocean Arks International (OAI) has been developing
some of the agricultural components for the eco-park. Their approach has been to start with
readily available organic wastes and through ecological processes convert the wastes to high-
value products. The main goal is ecological and economic ampliﬁcation of organic materials in
an integrated manner similar to that developed by Yan and Ma [56]. On a pilot scale the
materials being used include spent grain from a local brewery, straw, and bedding from an
organic poultry operation. There are several stages in the conversion of materials.
Stage 1: The organic materials are blended, pasteurized, and inoculated with oyster
mushroom spawn (Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq: Fr.)). The substrate is placed in plastic bags
punched with holes and placed in a mushroom incubator room. When the bags are fully
Living Machines
709

colonized by the mushroom mycelium, they are transferred to a grow room for fruiting and
harvest. Biological efﬁciency of conversion, the ratio of wet weight of harvested mushrooms
to the dry weight of the substrate, has exceeded 60 %. After harvest the remaining substrate
has the potential to be used as a high-quality animal feed for livestock. In the process of
mushroom production, the vegetative forms of fungi colonize the straw and spent grains and
produce essential amino acids such as lysine. Tests with cattle and the ﬁsh tilapia have
demonstrated a ready acceptance of the material.
Stage 2: The spent mushroom substrate is placed in earthworm or vermiculture chambers.
The earthworms rapidly convert the materials to enriched compost. The earthworms, a
product of the process, are then blended with aquatic plants, Azolla sp. (water fern) and
Lemna spp. (duckweeds), to produce protein-rich ﬁsh feeds.
Stage 3: The mushroom/earthworm-based compost is then utilized in the growing of
tropical plants in pots and the culture of salad greens. No additional fertilization to the
compost is required for the production of greens. After several harvests of salad greens, the
medium is then utilized as a soil amendment or as a potting soil.
8.2. Aquaculture
Another key component in the design of integrated food systems for urban settings is
aquaculture. The food team at OAI has designed recirculating systems based upon four tank
modules for the culture of aquatic animals. To date, OAI has successfully cultured
Oreochromis sp. (tilapia) and Perca ﬂavescens M. (yellow perch) in these systems. The
system is designed to produce feeds for the ﬁsh internally, including attached algae turfs
and their associated communities, ﬂoating aquatic plants including Lemna and Azolla,
zooplankton, and snails. External feeds to the system include earthworms and commercial
feeds. These ecosystem-based ﬁsh culture systems have proven to be efﬁcient. The multi-
plicity of pathways for nutrients and materials to ﬂow in the production of a diversity of crops
is an integral part of ecological design. If such an approach proves to be economically viable
in an urban setting, the larger issue of food security can be addressed through the application
of applied ecological concepts [17, 39, 40].

1. INTRODUCTION
Aquaculture is the cultivation process of aquatic organisms. Unlike ﬁshing, aquaculture,
also referred as aquafarming, implies the cultivation of aquatic populations under controlled
environments. Mariculture refers to aquaculture practices in marine environments. Particular
kinds of aquaculture include algaculture (the production of kelp/seaweed and other algae),
ﬁsh farming, growing of cultured pearls, shellﬁsh farming, and shrimp farming. Referring to
the National Aquaculture Act of 1980, 16 U.S.C. 2801, the name “aquaculture” stands for the
propagation and rearing of aquatic species in controlled or selected environments. According
to the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) [14], aquaculture is deﬁned as the
active cultivation of marine and freshwater aquatic organisms under controlled conditions.
Buck [3] describes aquaculture to consist of both the farming and the husbandry of ﬁsh,
shellﬁsh, and other aquatic plants and animals.
Another deﬁnition is given by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United
Nations. The aquaculture term is deﬁned as “the farming of aquatic organisms, including ﬁsh,
molluscs, crustaceans, and aquatic plants”. Farming implies some sort of intervention in the
716
Y.-T. Hung et al.

rearing process to enhance production, such as feeding, protection from predators, regular
stocking, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being
cultivated [7]. Some states in the United States have classiﬁed aquaculture as an agricultural
activity.
1.1. Environmental Issues
Environmental declination is the consequence of improper aquaculture practices. Aqua-
culture activities can have a signiﬁcant impact on the health and quality of receiving waters.
Changes in oxygen, pH, temperature, and the addition of ammonia, drugs, metals, organic
nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended solids are often measurable downstream from hatcher-
ies. The impact of farm discharges on the receiving waters depends on the level of nutrients
already present. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in farm wastes mainly originate from feeds
and are of greatest concern as they can cause nutrient enrichment. According to Miller and
Semmens [8], wastes from a ﬁsh farm come in three general forms: chemical, metabolic, and
pathogenic. Wastewater efﬂuent consists mainly of uneaten food and excretory wastes from
cultivated organisms. Aquaculture wastewater efﬂuent can also include a variety of
chemicals, feed additives, and pesticides that are added to systems to condition the water,
control pests, or cultivate organisms.
The latest issue regarding aquaculture and the environment which will not be focused in
this chapter is the health issue. For a more precise statement, the food sourced from
aquaculture industry is the concern of the public. In China, where seafood is the most common
diet, 64 % of seafood is coming from aquaculture. Some environmental impacts causing
concern domestically and internationally include eutrophication and algae blooms; antibi-
otics, pesticides, and fungicides; habitat destruction; depletion of wild ﬁsh stocks for feed; and
monoculture and invasive species. There are also cases of contaminated aquaculture product
such as poisonous melamine (synthetic nitrogen enhancer) in China, antibiotic contamination
in the United States, malachite green in Hong Kong, and carcinogens (chloramphenicol,
malachite green, and furazolidone) in China which are found in aquaculture products [6].
Carcinogenic contaminants in farmed ﬁsh are also found in Canada and the United States
include polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), which is a synthetic, organic chemical, and various
dietary additives, pesticides, antibiotics, and fungicides [2]. So, a good and responsible
management of aquaculture operation is essential to provide the source of ﬁsh and other
aquaculture products which, according to the feeding operation, follow the ﬁxed regulations.
2. REGULATIONS
2.1. Agencies Regulating Aquaculture
The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) issues the National Pollutant Dis-
charge Elimination System (NPDES) permit which establishes regulations for the discharge
of various pollutants from point sources to waters of the United States [13]. NPDES permits
Aquaculture
717

are obliged for ﬁsh farms, ﬁsh hatcheries, or other facilities that cultivate aquatic animals
under the following conditions:
l
Cold-water ﬁsh species or other cold-water aquatic animals in ponds, raceways, or similar
structures that discharge at least 30 days per year, produce more than 9,071 kg (20,000 lb) of
aquatic animals per year, or receive more than 2,268 kg (5,000 lb) of food during the month of
maximum feeding.
l
Warm-water ﬁsh species or other warm-water aquatic animals in ponds, raceways, or similar
structures that discharge at least 30 days per year. This does not include closed ponds which
discharge only during periods of excess runoff or warm-water facilities which produce less than
45,360 kg (100,000 lb) of aquatic animals per year.
l
Facilities determined on a case-by-case basis by the permitting authority to be signiﬁcant contrib-
utors of pollution to waters of the United States.
In addition, the US EPA also provides limits on the discharge of compounds, including
some commonly used water treatments. Discharge of pollutants to waters of the United States
from aquaculture production facilities, except as provided in the permit, is a violation of the
Clean Water Act (CWA) and may be subject to enforcement action by the US EPA.
2.2. The Federal Clean Water Act
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (PL 92-500) has been approved by Congress in
1972 and is commonly called the Clean Water Act (CWA). The objective of the CWA, as
revised by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-4), was to restore and maintain the
chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters.
2.3. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Requirements
The NPDES program has been administrated by states in the United States by the
authorization of the US EPA. Any facility that determines to discharge into the nation’s
waters must obtain a permit before they can be discharged. When the US EPA receives a
hatchery permit application, it issues an initial draft permit. Finalization of the permit is done
by the US EPA. The CWA, Section 401, requires any applicant for a federal discharge license
or permit, who conducts any activity which may result in any discharge into navigable waters,
to provide the licensing or permitting agency a certiﬁcate from the state that any such
discharge will comply with applicable provisions of Sections 122.1 through 122.7, 122.24,
and 122.25 of the CWA. Most states in the United States follow the US EPA guidelines that
propose aquatic life and human health criteria for many of the 126 priority pollutants.
2.3.1. Aquaculture Projects
Discharges into an aquaculture project require an NPDES permit. An aquaculture project
means a “deﬁned managed water area which uses discharges of pollutants into that designated
area for the maintenance or production of harvestable freshwater estuarine or marine plants
or animals” [11].

2.3.2. Concentrated Aquatic Animal Production Facilities
Concentrated aquatic feeding operations are direct dischargers and require an NPDES
permit if they annually meet the following general conditions [11]: (a) produce more than
9,090 harvest weight kilograms (about 20,000 lb) of cold-water ﬁsh (e.g., trout, salmon) or
(b) produce more than 45,454 harvest weight kilograms (about 100,000 lb) of warm-water ﬁsh
(e.g., catﬁsh, sunﬁsh, minnows).

2.5.1. Primary Contact Recreation Waters
Recreation waters are surface waters which are proper or intended to be made proper for
continuous and intimate contact by humans. Furthermore, they are also used for recreational
activities when the ingestion of small quantities is likely to occur. They include also location
of nonrestriction for those used for skin diving, swimming, or water skiing.

populations of salmonid ﬁshes. Waters designated for salmonid spawning must maintain
the following characteristics during the spawning and incubation periods for the particular
species inhabiting those waters [5]:
1.
A 1-h concentration of un-ionized ammonia is not to exceed 0.14 mg/L or total ammonia of
5.73 mg/L at 14 C at a pH of 8.0.

saturation, whichever is greater.
4.
Water temperature of 13 C or less with a maximum daily average no greater than 9 C.
3. WASTE MANAGEMENT OF AQUACULTURE OPERATION
3.1. Aquaculture Waste Management
The management of aquaculture waste depends on the suitability and effectiveness of the
system that is applied to the aquaculture operation. Recirculation systems in closed systems
where some or all of the water is ﬁltered and reused and single-pass systems which use troughs
or channels with water ﬂowing from one end to the other are required to manage the supply and
condition of water in the system, including the management and removal of wastes. Aquacul-
ture waste parameters depend on the types of aquaculture systems in operation.
Many aquaculture systems employ a constant through-ﬂow of water. These systems
typically generate wastewater at a relatively constant and high rate, with relatively low
contamination levels [15]. Systems that ﬁlter, reoxygenate, and recycle water typically
generate higher concentrated wastewater and sludges (from the ﬁltration process) but at
lower or intermittent rates [15]. Most tank-based aquaculture systems also generally have
intermittent discharges of concentrated wastewater during cleaning and harvesting operations.
According to Miller and Semmens [8], Idaho’s Division of Environmental Quality had
published useful information on aquaculture waste management namely Idaho Waste
720
Y.-T. Hung et al.

Management Guidelines for Aquaculture Operations. A waste management plan is compiled
of a diversity of best management practices (BMPs). It is an effective method to reduce or
prevent pollution generated from aquaculture production facilities. The objectives of aqua-
culture waste management are to:
l
Design, build, and maintain aquaculture facilities in a manner that works towards the elimination of
the discharge of solids and nutrients to surface or groundwater.
l
Operate aquaculture facilities in a manner that minimizes the creation of solids and nutrients while
providing optimal ﬁsh-rearing conditions.
l
Promote management of the collected biosolids as a resource, preferably in a manner that utilizes
the available nutrients while minimizing the potential of the nutrients impacting surface or
groundwaters.
Appropriate planning and maintenance are the means to excellent waste management and
efﬂuent water quality. Combinations of factors are considered in order to determine the
optimum waste management system. These factors are available capital, site location and
water supply, handling options and waste collection, operational practices, and additional
regulations and permit requirements [5].
3.2. Water Supply
Water supplies generally are classiﬁed as groundwater or surface water, for example, the
river, stream, irrigation return, and source well or spring. Aquaculture production is using
both types of water supply. Surface waters frequently bring sediment and nutrient loads which
are considered in addition to the wastes generated by the aquaculture facility. The settling
areas can be well designed with the determination of total solids loads. Cyclic arrangement of
waste production and removal also will be affected. A large enough area is normally needed to
accommodate ﬁsh production and adequate waste management areas. Closeness to agricul-
tural land available is an important criterion for the application of collected wastes. In
summary, the quality and quantity of available water determines the type of aquaculture
facility which can be operated, as well as the most suitable methods for managing wastes.
3.3. Options in Waste Management
Development of waste management options also depends on the volume of water ﬂow.
Aquaculture facilities with small ﬂow volumes can consider options for solids removal, such
as collecting solids in the quiescent areas at the end of the rearing areas and removing this
waste to separate off-line basin(s), settling and removing solids from a separate basin that
receives the full ﬂow from the facility (full-ﬂow settling (FFS)), settling of solids in the
rearing area (in-pond settling), and use of constructed wetlands or alternative treatments.
Operations with large ﬂows may have fewer options. The common option is to remove
wastes collected in quiescent areas below production areas to off-line settling (OLS) basin(s).
In order to maintain better efﬂuent quality, it is important to remove biosolids from rearing
areas as efﬁciently as possible. Settled waste products can be collected in designated zones at
the ends of ponds for easy removal. Selection of one of the three basic methods of waste
Aquaculture
721

collection relying on solids settling (full ﬂow, in-pond, and quiescent/off-line) is facility
dependent. It is based on several interrelated factors which are depth of the settling area,
overﬂow rate (Vo) in the settling area, waste particle size and density (sink rate), water
retention time (Rt), water velocity, and ﬂow distribution [5].
3.4. Operational Practices
The amount and composition of biosolids are related to the cropping method; the facility
loading, or biomass, feed type, and practices; and the ﬁsh size. It is essential to maintain a
schedule for biosolids cleaning or harvesting. Eventually, biosolids which have not been
harvested will begin to biodegrade and create problems in removing and solubilizing nutrients
into the receiving stream. In general, regularly settled biosolids harvesting is necessary to
maintain efﬁcient waste management system.
3.5. Waste Management Plan
A waste management plan is important to minimize, collect, and dispose of pollutants
generated in the operations. A good waste management plan normally involves effective best
management practices (BMPs) to control the release of pollutants and helps to comply with
waste management requirements and the maintenance of optimum efﬂuent water quality.
According to the US EPA [15], best management practices (BMPs) designed to minimize
potential detrimental health and environmental effects that may result from aquaculture oper-
ations are primarily focused on adopting alternative waste disposal options, reducing pollutant
levels in efﬂuent, or reducing the volume of waste injected. At least the plan shall include:
l
A description of procedures governing quality assurance and quality control for the information
collected.
l
A description of the solids handling and removal system components.
l
A monitoring plan that evaluates the effectiveness of the overall system.
l
A plan for a solids disposal or other approved uses of the harvested waste material, including
seasonal options.
l
Schedules for cleaning the various waste collection components.
3.6. Characterization of Waste, Waste Management Issues,
and Quality of Water
Waste produced in aquaculture is mainly related to the type, amount, and composition of
feed fed. These wastes are composed of biosolids and soluble nutrients. Biosolids and
nutrients discharged into surface waters may result in violations of water quality standards
and unfavorably affecting designated beneﬁcial uses of water.
3.6.1. Biosolids
Uneaten feed and feces are the main source of biosolids. Inﬂuent water, depending upon the
quality and source, also can contribute to the total loading of solids (inorganic sediments).
Particularly where surface waters are used, these solids can signiﬁcantly contribute to the
722
Y.-T. Hung et al.

burden of sludge removal and disposal. The major components of biosolids are amino acids,
carbohydrates, fats, nondigestible ﬁber, phosphorous, proteins, and inert material. The
amount of biosolids generated is highly variable and depends upon digestibility of feed
ingredients, feed conversion efﬁciency, management practices, ﬁsh health, and quality of
diet. It is very difﬁcult to accurately estimate the total amount of biosolids generated, and even
more difﬁcult to separately calculate the amount of different waste components generated.
Total biosolids are calculated on a dry basis. An individual fecal pellet is covered by a mucous
sheath. The mucous sheath will remain intact if the pellet is removed soon after deposition. If
left where deposited for an extended period of time, the scouring or swimming motion of the
ﬁsh will cause the feces to break into smaller particles. These particles can become
resuspended and contribute to the suspended solids (SS) and total suspended solids (TSS)
in the efﬂuent if not completely settled and removed prior to discharge. This phenomenon also
occurs to the uneaten feed particles. Additionally, leaching of nutrients and decomposition
will accelerate because of the smaller particles. Hence, the biosolids should be removed as
rapidly as possible and ideally without unnecessary disturbance to the structure of the
biosolids. Intact fecal pellets have a rapid settling velocity (Vs) but, when broken into smaller
particles, take much longer to settle out. The smaller particles require lower water velocities to
settle out; thus, a larger settling area is required to provide an adequate area to reduce the
water velocity [5].
3.6.2. Soluble Nutrients
The nutrients originate from nutrient leaching and ﬁsh excretion from the biosolids.
Inﬂuent water, depending upon the quality and source, also can contribute to the nutrients
on the farm. Chemical monitoring of the efﬂuent is necessary. The biological and nutritional
approach is based on measurements of nutrient retention efﬁciencies (NRE), apparent
digestibility coefﬁcients (ADC), and the quantity of uneaten feed [5]. Total soluble
nutrients are calculated on a dry basis. The soluble nutrients include forms of nitrogen
and phosphorus.
Feed is the main source of nitrogen, which speciﬁcally comes from dietary protein. Fish
excrete nearly all waste nitrogen as ammonia and urea. Only a small amount is excreted with
the feces [5]. As with nitrogen, feed is the main source of phosphorus, which is excreted in
soluble and particulate forms. The form of phosphorus consumed by the ﬁsh will affect the
amount of soluble and particulate phosphorus excreted. Phosphorus is available from the plant
and animal ingredients used to formulate the diet. Feedstuffs of animal origin (bone meal, ﬁsh
meal, and meat) contain the highest concentrations of phosphorus. Phosphorus from animal
feedstuffs is most commonly used than from plant materials. From 60 to 70 % of phosphorus
in plant material is unavailable to the ﬁsh and is passed out with the feces. Any surplus dietary
phosphorus is largely excreted by the kidneys [5].
Castledine [4] provides factors which can be used to estimate the waste generated from
salmonid culture based upon feed consumption (Table 15.1).
These factors assume a dry feed with 10 % moisture, with a digestibility of 80 %, and a feed
conversion of 1.2.

If a trout farmer fed 45,359 kg (100,000 lb) of feed in a year, the estimated amount of waste produced

Knowledge of waste characteristics is essential in the design of a waste management
system. A properly designed waste management system will not only be more efﬁcient but
also more cost-effective for the operator.
3.6.3. Chemical or Physical Parameters
Groundwater contamination is one of the impacts of bad disposal of aquaculture wastes.
Good waste management and water stewardship are necessary in order to ensure the quality of
water in receiving streams. While water quality on the farm affects the health and productivity
of an aquaculture facility, the efﬂuent water quality affects the health and productivity of the
receiving waters. Table 15.2 below shows the minimum and maximum values for common
water quality parameters in an aquaculture operation [5].
Some of the chemical or physical parameters having the greatest potential effect are
dissolved gases, nitrogen, pH, phosphorus, sediment, and water temperature.

Dissolved Gases
The dissolved gases that are normally found in highest concentrations in water are nitrogen
and oxygen. This is mainly due to their relative abundance in the atmosphere. At equilibrium,
freshwater contains approximately twice the amount of nitrogen as oxygen because of their
differing atmospheric partial pressures and solubilities. Higher dissolved gases in an aqua-
cultural environment require removal through very costly additional water treatment. Aquatic
animals need oxygen to live therefore oxygen is absolutely the most important dissolved gas
in an aquatic environment. Dissolved oxygen (DO) is produced through photosynthesis by
aquatic plants and used during respiration by aquatic animals and plants. Aquatic animals
require sufﬁcient levels of DO in rearing areas to maintain health and growth. Table 15.3
shows DO concentrations, at equilibrium, for various temperatures and elevations in
freshwater [5].
Dissolved oxygen concentrations in an aquaculture operation are depleted by aquatic
animal respiration and chemical reactions with organic materials such as dead ﬁsh or plant
matter, feces, and wasted feed. Limited replenishment of depleted oxygen is attained by

occasionally breaking up the water column and exposing the water to the atmosphere.
Common techniques used for this purpose in an aquaculture facility are gas-powered
mechanical aerators in pond system boards or screens in a ﬂow-through pond system or
splash electric. Other factors may also inﬂuence DO levels in an aquaculture facility.
Aquatic plants can reduce DO levels during respiration at night. Aquaculture facilities
with surface water sources can be adversely affected during these periods by the reduced
available DO levels. This is in particular happening for warm-water aquaculture facilities,
where water temperature limits the amount of oxygen present. Biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD) and nitriﬁcation from bacteria and other microorganisms acting on organic matter
also reduce oxygen levels, particularly if solid wastes are permitted to gather in rearing
areas. Nearly all aquatic organisms can live on short periods at low oxygen levels, but
prolonged exposure to low oxygen levels can harm organisms not adapted for such condi-
tions. Furthermore, low oxygen levels can result in the release of nutrients stored in
sediments. Continual periods of depletion can cause indigenous aquatic organisms to die
and/or be replaced by a few specialized organisms tolerant of low oxygen levels, such as an
anaerobic microorganism.
Dissolved nitrogen does not generally cause problem in aquaculture as normal concentra-
tions lie at or below 100 % of saturation. However, at supersaturation levels exceeding 102 %,
dissolved nitrogen can induce gas bubble disturbance in ﬁsh [5].

Nitrogen
Nitrogen usually presents in several forms in the aquatic environment. Nitrite and ammonia
are the biggest concern to aquaculturists. Ammonia is a direct by-product of aquatic animal
metabolism and in the biodegradation of organic matter. Ammonia is a gas which dissolves in
water to form ammonium ion (NHþ
4 ) and un-ionized ammonia (NH3) which is lethal or
harmful to aquatic organisms. This toxicity is greater at higher pH and temperature. When
un-ionized ammonia levels exceed 0.0125–0.025 mg/L, growth rates of rainbow trout are
reduced, and damage to liver, kidney, and gill tissue may occur [5]. The proportion of total
ammonia in un-ionized form is shown in Table 15.4 at varying temperatures and pH levels,
along with sample calculations for estimating un-ionized ammonia fractions [5].
Example of calculation: Find the concentration of un-ionized ammonia if total ammonia was
measured at 1.0 mg/L at 14 C and a pH of 8.0.
% un-ionized at 14, pH 8.0 ¼ 2.48
TAN 1.0 mg/L  0.0248 un-ionized ¼ 0.0248 mg/L un-ionized ammonia
Nitrite (NO2
) is an intermediate result in nitriﬁcation process, i.e., conversion of ammonia
to nitrate (NO3
). It is highly toxic to freshwater ﬁsh. However, nitrite is not considered to be
a problem in most ﬂow-through rearing systems as nitriﬁcation usually will not occur in the
amount of time water is retained [5]. Nitrate can also be present in source water and is
generally harmless to aquatic animals.

pH
pH is deﬁned as the negative logarithm of hydrogen ion concentration in water. pH shows
alkalinity and acidity level of a given water sample. The ability of water to resist changes in pH
(buffering), generally resulting from the presence of dissolved salts of carbonic acid. Aquatic
organisms may be harmed when pH values lie beyond the normal range in the environment.
Photosynthetic activity of aquatic plants in inadequately buffered waters may cause wide
diurnal variations of pH in natural surface waters. pH rises when these plants use free carbon
dioxide and some bicarbonate ions during daylight hours. Vice versa, pH decreases at night
during aquatic respiration, because the respired carbon dioxide becomes a weak acid in water.
Phosphorus
Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for the growth of aquatic plants. However, excessive
amounts of phosphorus can unhinder growth of aquatic plants. In nature, available phosphorus
in aquaculture can contribute to the growth of annoyance levels of aquatic plants in receiving
waters and enhance the natural eutrophication processes. Phosphorus in aquatic animal feeds
at levels above nutritional requirements will be discharged in urine and solid fecal wastes. The
main part of this excreted phosphorus is found in the solids. Systems designed to facilitate
frequent solids removal from the rearing environment, along with good management practices
optimizing feed utilization while minimizing feed waste, should help reduce phosphorus
contribution to receiving waters. Alternate methods of phosphorus treatment may be suitable
under certain sets of conditions. Percent availability of phosphorus in common feedstuffs is as
shown in Table 15.5 [9].
Sediment
Fecal and feed solids (biosolids) and inorganic and organic sediments are the main form of
sediments found in an aquaculture operation from source waters. Sediments discharged into
receiving waters can unfavorably affect habitat and can change the abundance and types of

species of that habitat. The main concern is the biosolids generated during the production of
aquatic animals. The oxidation of this organic solid reduces DO levels and results in the
emission of dissolved nutrients. In addition, solids suspended in rearing areas can affect ﬁsh
health and may lead to conditions such as environmental gill disease [5]. Solids are much
easier to remove from the aquaculture operation prior to efﬂuent discharge compared to the
dissolved components of waste, such as ammonia and phosphorus. Good aquaculture waste
management program emphasizes the prompt attention to a regular program of solids
removal, facility design that maximizes solids removal efﬁciency, and feeding practices
that minimize wasted feed and solids accumulation.
Temperature
The types of organisms that can live in aquatic habitats are also inﬂuenced by temperature
variations. Salmonids and other cold-water biota need speciﬁc temperatures for maintenance
and reproduction; water temperatures which vary radically or move beyond optimal range can
affect the production, changing waste generation and spreading of disease. Catﬁsh, tilapia,
and tropical ﬁsh are produced using warm-water wells or hot springs [5]. If the warm water is
not cooled before being discharged, it could increase temperatures in the stream or any
receiving waters.
3.6.4. General Characteristics of Aquaculture Efﬂuent by the US EPA
According to the US EPA [15], the primary components in waste from aquaculture
operations are suspended and dissolved solids, phosphorus-based nutrients, and nitrogen-
based nutrients. The factors that inﬂuence the concentration of these components in the
efﬂuent are feeding efﬁciency, the practice of low-intensity or high-intensity aquaculture,
type and size of organisms involved, the water management systems, wastewater manage-
ment systems, etc. Another additional constituent in the efﬂuent is human pathogens or
bacteria. Pathogenic bacteria in ﬁsh and wastewater from aquaculture operations are listed
in Table 15.6 [15]. These bacteria are inﬂuenced by the type of operation and organism
cultivated.
Samples from Sea Life Park, Hawaii, were taken to show the presence of microbial content
in aquaculture operations. Tables 15.7 and 15.8 exhibit the list of the content [15]. However,
different aquaculture operation has different content of microbial presence.
The concentration of additives, chemicals, and pesticides used in aquaculture operation is
different depending on culture intensity (e.g., organism density), operation type, species
raised, and water quality. The levels of these constituents in wastewaters are expected to be
different.
3.6.5. Additives, Chemicals, and Pesticides
There are guidelines on the use of drugs in aquaculture operations. The common antibiotics
approved by the US EPA are sulfamerazine, sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim, and oxytetracy-
cline, but other antibiotics also can be used under the new regulation of the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) [15]. Fish hormones are common components used to increase the

production of ﬁsh. Products such as FDA-approved color additives, carotenoids, are used on
farmed salmon and trout to produce a pink/orange ﬂesh [15]. In addition, vitamins and
minerals are also used in the dietary of the ﬁsh. Drugs approved by the FDA for use in
aquaculture, as well as drugs of low regulatory priority at FDA, are listed in Attachment [15].
The use of numerous algaecides, ﬁsh toxins, and herbicides and also biologics is common
in aquaculture operations to maintain the health of the ﬁsh and other organisms cultivated.
The lists of these components are given in Attachment which is in accordance to US EPA
regulations [15]. Some of the chemicals are not used in closed systems and only some are
prevented from being in wastewater. Furthermore, herbicides are usually used in large water
bodies that support open aquaculture operations. Pesticides and drugs regulated by the FDA
and the US EPA that are likely to be present in the efﬂuent of some aquaculture operations and
could conceivably be present in current and future aquaculture operation are summarized in
Table 15.9 below [15].

4. DESIGN CRITERIA OF AQUACULTURE SYSTEM
The combination of different system components and design criteria is needed in order to
develop efﬁcient facilities which could comply with the efﬂuent standards. The compliance to
the NPDES permitted discharge limits depends on many factors such as the design, water
source, species raised, water use, equipment, and ﬁsh diet and with conscientious operation of
the aquaculture facilities when properly managed. Good system components and design
criteria will minimize solids and nutrients in the efﬂuent. An effective operation and

maintenance of a waste management system is able to capture nutrients and solids, record
solids removal, remove solids frequently, and meet applicable regulations and standards. An
example of a common cross section raceway design is shown in Fig. 15.1 [8].
4.1. Criteria of Solids Removal
As much as possible solids have to be removed due to their signiﬁcant impact to the
environment. Removal of solids will inﬂuence phosphorus and, to a lesser extent, nitrogen
control. Solids which are not removed may cause turbid waters and streambed drops instantly
below the aquaculture facility. Removal of waste solids from the settling areas is the key to
efﬁcient solids management. Devastation of the particles speeds up leaching of nutrients and
reduces particle settling [5].
4.1.1. Settling Velocity, Vs
The settling velocity (Vs) of a particle is expressed as meters per day (m/d), feet per second
(ft/s), or centimeters per second (cm/s). Aquaculture biosolids are discrete particles [5]. Their
speciﬁc gravity and size affects the variation of Vs values. Fecal casts are heavy and will have
a Vs of 0.02–0.05 m/s (0.066–0.164 ft/s), but ﬁne, lighter particles will range from 0.000457 to
0.000914 m/s (0.0015–0.0030 ft/s) [5]. Different aquaculture feeds produce biosolids with

Aquaculture

variable Vs values. Particles in ponds are larger and will settle to the bottom rapidly
[5]. However, particles that are passed through vacuum heads, pumps, and pipes become
smaller and require larger areas for settling.
4.1.2. Overﬂow Rate, Vo
Determination of the size or surface area necessary for discrete particle settling can be
determined by comparing Vs values to overﬂow rate (Vo). Overﬂow rate or hydraulic load is
expressed as Q/A, where Q ¼ volume of ﬂow per unit of time and A ¼ surface area. Overﬂow
rate is expressed as centimeters per second (cm/s), feet per second (ft/s), feet per minute
(ft/m), feet per day (ft/d), or meters per day (m/d). The surface area of the settling zone is
sufﬁcient for settling of the discrete particles if Vs is greater than Vo. The use of the Vs and Vo
relationship to determine the surface area required for a settling zone is as shown in Example 1.
Rectangular-shaped settling zones encourage laminar ﬂow. Irregular shapes do not, nor are
they efﬁcient for particle settling (Fig. 15.2) [5]. Oversized settling zones help ensure solids
removal fulﬁllment.
Fig. 15.2. Flow characteristics of non-rectangular ponds. Source: DEQ [5].
734
Y.-T. Hung et al.

Example 1: Settling zone size. What size of settling zone would be required given the
following?
Given Vs ¼ 0.000457 m/s (0.0015 ft/s) and Q ¼ 0.028 m3/s (1.0 ft3/s), then Vo must be
<0.000457 m/s.
Since A ¼ Q/V, A ¼ 0.028 m3/s  0.000457 m/s, and A ¼ 60 m2.
Double this to compensate for real-world conditions, 2A ¼ 120 m2.
Therefore the minimum size needed for this settling zone is 6 m wide by 20 m long.
(Note that dimensions may vary as long as the total area is at least 120 m2).
4.1.3. Retention Time and Storage Volume
Retention time is expressed as the volume of the settling zone divided by the rate of ﬂow. It
is not directly related to solids settling but is essential in determining the capacity of a settling
zone. Normally a depth of 0.91–1.82 m (3–6 ft) provides adequate storage volume for solids
from most aquaculture operations after the determination of the desired surface area relative
to the Vs and Vo ratios [5]. By applying frequent harvest of the solids, deep ponds which are
more difﬁcult to build, maintain, and harvest are usually not needed. The amount of solids
produced depends primarily on the amount of feed used and the feed conversion efﬁciency.
Dry weight is used in the calculations for conversions, by-products, and weight gain.
By-product and settling zone volume calculations representative of values for trout culture
is as shown in Examples 2 and 3 [5].
Example 2: How much by-product solids will 453 kg (1,000 lb) of feed generate?. Fish feed is
typically 92 % dry, so 453 kg  0.92 ¼ 416.76 kg dry weight.
(At a 1.3 conversion rate, this amounts to a ﬁsh weight gain of 416.76 kg/1.3 or 320 kg.)
Fish are typically 26.15 % dry weight, so 320 kg  0.2615 ¼ 83.83 kg ﬁsh dry weight.
At 70–80 % feed digestibility, the amount used for maintenance of heat and energy is
142:88  183kg maint:
Of the dry feed weight, excreted solubles account for approximately 40.82 kg dry feed
weight.
Assuming no feed waste, the total solids by dry feed weight generated from 453 kg of feed is
416:76kg83:91kg142:88 to 183kg40:82kg¼108:86 to 149:68kg of solids by dry
feed weight:
Example 3: How much settling zone volume is required to accommodate 149.68 kg (330 lb)
dry weight of by-product?. Solids in the settling zones are typically with 82 % moisture, so
149.68 kg/0.18 ¼ 831.55 kg wet weight.
One liter weighs 1 kg, so 831.55 kg/1 kg/L ¼ 831.55 L.
One cubic meter contains 1,000 L, so the amount of settling volume required to hold the
equivalent of 149.68 kg of dry weight is 831.55 L/1,000 L/m3 ¼ 0.831 m3.

4.1.4. Laminar Flow
Laminar ﬂow is referred as the ﬂow distributed evenly over the entire surface area
(Fig. 15.3). It is required for the better performance of a settling zone. Larger settling zones
are required if scouring or short-circuiting takes place due to uneven current patterns. Laminar
ﬂow can be achieved when appropriate ways for water inﬂuent and efﬂuent are designed.
Figure 15.4 demonstrates an ideal weir design. The objective is to allow water to enter and
leave the settling pond in ideal condition with as little turbulence and as slow a current as
possible. The height of the inﬂuent weir is normally 85 % of the water depth. Turbulence,
scouring, and updraft currents will reduce the effectiveness of the settling zone (Fig. 15.5).
Water entering or leaving on the side of a pond will short-circuit laminar ﬂow or cause a

736
Y.-T. Hung et al.

crosscurrent and reduce the effectiveness of the settling zone. Short-circuiting is also caused
by irregular pond shapes.
Weir rate is Q/L, where Q ¼ the volume of ﬂow per unit of time and L ¼ the length of the
weir. Weir rate is expressed as meter cube per day per meter of length (m3/day/m). Overﬂow
weir rate should be less than 121 m3/day/m for ﬁne particulate solids (Vs of
0.000457–0.000914 m/s) [5]. Weir rates much greater than this will cause the velocity of
the discharged water to speed up dramatically, increasing updraft and scouring. For larger
solids with Vs values from 0.02 to 0.05 m/s, weir rate can be much higher at 916–1,703 m3/
day/m [5]. A long weir is desirable as it creates slowest water velocity across the weir. The
most common efﬁcient design is a rectangular settling pond with the weirs on the long sides of
the pond. However, longer weir must be balanced due to their reduced water depth. If water
depth across a weir is too shallow, moss growth on the weir, debris, or wind may occur which
will prevent ﬂow across some of the weir length. Wind also can cause serious short-circuiting
which is speed of only 1.78 m/s can induce a surface current with a speed of 0.0365 m/s,
greater magnitude than desired pond velocities or Vo values [5]. Screens which separate the
ﬁsh in the rearing area from the quiescent zones (QZs) will create turbulence as water passes
through the screen, diminishing the efﬁciency of the QZ.
4.1.5. Oversizing Settling Zones
There are some additional reasons to build oversized settling zones besides turbulence from
weirs, screens, and wind. Fish that may escape into the settling area results resuspension of
biosolid particles. Scour may be caused by the surging of ﬂow and should be minimized.
Vacuuming and other work activities can cause resuspension of particles. Release of gases
from microbial action may ﬂoat the particles together with the gas bubbles. Doubling the
surface area provides an adequate buffer to compensate for most of the effects which can
reduce settling efﬁciency once the surface area requirement for a settling zone has been
established relative to Vs and Vo values. Determination of the settling zone area is through the
use of the following Vs values [5]:

0.000457 m/s for OLS ponds
l
0.003962 m/s for FFS ponds
l
0.009449 m/s for QZs

737

4.2. System Components of Solids Removal
The solids collection system is the most important physical component for minimizing the
solids and nutrients escaping in efﬂuent.
4.2.1. Quiescent Zones
Quiescent zones (QZ) are the main areas where solids are collected and located on
downstream of the rearing area and are devoid of ﬁsh. It is depicted in Fig. 15.6. It allows
biosolids to settle unhindered while intact and large in size. This facilitates biosolids removal
from the hatchery ﬂow. It is necessary that each last-use rearing unit contain a QZ so biosolids
can be settled before efﬂuent water from the facility is discharged.
The dimension of quiescent zones must be adequate to ensure that Vo values are smaller
than the Vs values of the particles to be collected. The accepted range of Vs values for
biosolids in raceways is 0.00945 m/s to 0.05 m/s, so the dimensions of QZs should provide
a Vo value smaller than 0.00945 m/s [5]. A large amount of settling occurs in the rearing area
as solids slowly move downstream and resettle in the QZ. The opportunity for particles to start
settling prior to the QZs makes these zones very efﬁcient for settling particles found in the
ﬁsh-rearing area. The most common depth for a raceway rearing area and QZ is 0.91 m,
although depth is not critical to the efﬁcient operation of the QZ [5].
4.2.2. Solids Harvest from Quiescent Zones
Figures 15.6 and 15.10 show the typical QZs. Once the solids are settled in the QZs, they
are removed and transported to off-line settling (OLS) ponds. Vacuuming is the most common
method of solids removal from QZs, as shown in Fig. 15.7. Typically, stand pipes in each QZ
connect to a common 150–200-mm PVC pipe which carries the slurry of water and solids to
the off-line destination [5]. Suction is provided by head pressure from pond water depth and
by gravity or by pumps. Flexible hose and a swivel joint are used to connect the vacuum head
Fig. 15.6. A constricted weir causes turbulence and scouring of settled biosolids. Quiescent zone length
should be increased to compensate for the reduced efﬁciency of the settling zone. Source: DEQ [5].

to the PVC standpipes to clean the QZ. Slurry transport pipes and pumps should be adequate
in size to carry the required ﬂow and provide adequate suction at the vacuum head. Insufﬁ-
cient vacuuming will resuspend solids and will increase the time required to clean a QZ. One
hundred gpm is desirable to operate a 300–450-mm-wide vacuum head [5]. Generally, the
operating labor investment in solids removal can exceed 25 % of the total farm labor [5].
Sufﬁcient slope of the pipes is necessary in order to offer cleaning velocities and remove
stagnant areas. Sloping the QZ ﬂoor towards the stand pipe or suction port adds to the cost of
construction but enhances the efﬁciency of solids collection and removal. The standpipe to the
off-line destination may be removed and the solids can be pushed with a broom or squeegee
device to the suction. Solids removal is more rapid when high water ﬂows through the solids
suction port. Larger QZs can be divided into several smaller QZs which can be harvested
individually as shown in Fig. 15.8. Quiescent zones should be cleaned as frequently as possible.
When left too long in QZs, removing the solids may be difﬁcult. Anaerobic conditions may
develop and cause resuspension of solids by anaerobic gases. Frequent harvest is preferable
and beneﬁts ﬁsh health in downstream rearing units. Frequent cleaning of QZs will protect
receiving waters.
4.2.3. Alternate Quiescent Zone Designs
There are many alternatives in QZ designs for frequent solids removal [5]. Some QZs
which have ﬂoors 0.6–1.2 m (1–2 ft) lower than the rearing unit ﬂoor were originally designed
to provide storage capacity for solids. However, due to frequent harvest of QZ nowadays, the

storage capacity is no longer needed. While they may increase storage capacity, enhance
solids removal, and save labor. The advantages they offer in collection or in separating solids
from outﬂow weir entrainment may not be great if Vo values and the frequency of solids
removal are already adequate. If adequate suction, ﬂoor slope, and proper dimensions are
available, quiescent zones with recessed ﬂoors or those sloped to a center off-line exhaust port
work very well and are labor efﬁcient (Fig. 15.9).

Y.-T. Hung et al.

Cones, v-shaped troughs, and perforated false ﬂoors and pipes were designed so that a
valve could be opened. A strong suction is required to move the heavy, sticky solids, and only
those very close (within 12 in.) to the suction port. A 450-mm-wide by 2.54-cm-high vacuum
head requires at least 6.3 L/s to pick up solids with which it has direct contact [5]. This type of
design reacts much differently than a QZ ﬂoor sloped 45 to a 150-mm stand pipe, a system
which will pull 25.23 L/s of ﬂow with 1.2 m (4 ft) of head pressure (Fig. 15.9) [5]. Separator
plates are the closely spaced, thin, vertical, or inclined plates which span QZs from side to side
and from a few inches below water level to several inches above the ﬂoor. Various designs are
under consideration to improve solids collection in QZs, but because QZs in most ponds for
ﬁsh larger than ﬁngerlings are from 3.048 to 5.48 m wide, the plates tend to be expensive and
require some structural integrity [5].
4.2.4. Off-Line Settling Ponds
Off-line settling (OLS) ponds are settling zones that obtain the water and solids slurry
removed from QZs and rearing areas. These zones are depicted in Fig. 15.10. These ponds are
the second settling zone in the solids collection system. Quiescent zones in combination with
OLS ponds include the most commonly used solids collection and removal system. Water
leaving OLS ponds is considered to be treated efﬂuent. Flow to OLS ponds is normally very
small in comparison to the total facility ﬂow. OLS pond efﬂuent is usually less than 1.5 % of
the total ﬂow during daytime working hours and less than 0.75 % against 24-h averages.
The turbulence caused by the pipes and pumps that carry the solids from the QZs has made
the solids particles become smaller before entering OLS ponds. The accepted Vs values for

these smaller particles are 0.000460–0.000920 m/s. The Vo value for OLS ponds must
therefore be less than 0.00460 m/s [5]. Example 4 exhibits the Vo calculation for a typical
OLS pond on a large farm. Depth of a typical OLS pond is 1.066 m, but many are even deeper
to provide storage for solids. Minimum harvest frequency for OLS ponds is done in every
6 months. Frequent solids removal is desirable to avoid solids to break down and release
dissolved nutrients into receiving waters. Normally, if TSS levels can be maintained below
100 mg/L, then the other parameters will also comply with the standard discharge limit
[5]. Some OLS ponds need monthly solids removal to maintain compliance with the TSS.

The ideal Vs for OLS ponds is 0.000460 m/s. The Vo value of 0.000101 m/s is 4.57 times
less than the ideal Vs and 2.28 times less than the ﬁnal design value, so the dimensions of
this OLS pond are more than adequate to handle 50.68 L/s (1.79 cfs) of inﬂow from
quiescent zones.
In order to provide better solids collection, many facilities provide multiple OLS ponds
connected in series. Each individual pond in the series usually has a Vo value smaller than
0.000460 m/s. Some operations may have two OLS ponds next to the other, each within the
recommended Vo value. When one is undergoing solids harvest, the other is receiving solids
from the QZs. Vice versa, in order to improve solids collection, the common practice is to
operate both OLS ponds simultaneously, either in series or in parallel. However, linking the
ponds in parallel is advantageous as it splits the ﬂow and improving Vo and weir rate. This
results in reduction in water velocity and entrainment which makes the parallel application
superior. Periodic ﬂow to OLS ponds from QZs occurs primarily during regular working
hours when personnel are cleaning the QZs. Periodic ﬂow improves the settling of solids
because the average ﬂow would be less than the peak inﬂow, and the design Vo values of
existing OLS ponds are based on the peak inﬂow rate.
Average TSS levels do become higher as an OLS pond ﬁlls with solids. This is particular
when scouring and short-circuiting of laminar ﬂow become more signiﬁcant factors as the
pond ﬁlls, entrainment, signifying the role of pond depth, solids resuspended by gas bubbles,
and wind shear, especially if harvest frequency is not done on time. The inﬂuence of OLS
ponds is where the majority of solids quickly settle.
Algae blooms are common in OLS ponds and some of the TSS is released in efﬂuent
making compliance difﬁcult. Covering the OLS ponds from sunlight is one of the solutions,
but this is costly and may hinder solids removal and other activities. Furthermore, ventilation
has to be maintained to prevent serious condensation and possible gas increase inside the area.
Odor can also be a problem in OLS ponds mainly due to odor stems from anaerobic
conditions. Odor is normally emitted when solids build up at the inﬂuent of the pond above the
water surface. Efﬂuent weirs will drip water gradually during the night lowering the surface
level and revealing solids at the inﬂuent of the pond. In addition, solids exposure will occur in
the absence of overnight decanting if the inﬂow weir is not well designed and maintained. In
742
Y.-T. Hung et al.

order to prevent outﬂow weir leakage, inﬂow weir needs to be designed properly with frequent
harvesting of solids. It is necessary to run water through the waste treatment system to prevent
odor or prevent pipes and settling areas from freezing during nonworking hours. This practice
will release nutrients and solids from the settling pond.
Earthen ponds are cheaper but they can be more difﬁcult to harvest. Laminar ﬂow is more
difﬁcult to maintain in earthen ponds with irregularly shaped bottoms and sides. The inﬂuent
needs to bypass to another OLS pond in order to remove the solids from an OLS pond.
Concrete OLS ponds can be harvested by the same method. In addition, most have a ramp at
one end where a front-end loader can enter the pond. Concrete OLS ponds are usually
harvested by vacuuming the solids through slurry onto a tank truck. Some concrete OLS
ponds have a sump with a ﬂoor that is lower than the OLS pond ﬂoor which is included at the
deep end of the pond by an access point for truck and equipment.
4.2.5. Full-Flow Settling Ponds
The full-ﬂow solids collection system may not have QZs or OLS ponds as shown in
Fig. 15.11. In order to collect the solids for the entire facility water ﬂow, this system is
built with one or two large settling zones. The individual rearing units may not have solids
removal facilities but rather the water from all the rearing units combines and enters the FFS
pond or ponds where the solids are collected. Solids particles in this type of system will be
larger than solids in OLS ponds as there is no exposure to the turbulence of small pipes or
pumps. However, there are still solids that are exposed to some turbulence as they pass
through the fall from one rearing unit to the other or as they pass through the common
collection channel to enter the FFS ponds, so the solids will be smaller than QZ solids. The
ideal Vo value recommended for FFS ponds is 0.004 m/s (0.013 ft/s) or less [5].
Example 5.5 exhibits the FFS pond dimensions required for a given ﬂow. FFS ponds are
used mainly on smaller aquaculture facilities with low ﬂow volumes [5]. Design must
Fig. 15.11. Full-ﬂow settling ponds treat 100 % of the ﬂow from the ﬁsh farm before it is discharged.

Aquaculture

comprise a bypass channel for the FFS pond for solids removal. FFS pond systems normally
consist of two ponds operating in parallel for maintenance. One pond would remain opera-
tional during solids removal. Solids removal for FFS ponds is normally done at least every
6 months. Some operators batch collect their ﬁsh at the same time. Thus, the FFS pond can be
harvested when the facility is empty and water is being bypassed.
Example 5.5: FFS pond sizing. If total ﬂow ¼ 1,415 L/s (50 cfs) and minimum Vo
¼ 0.003962 m/s,
then the required surface area is 1,415 L/s  0.003962 m/s ¼ 357 m2.
If 15.24 m (50 ft.) is the desired pond width, then length is 357 m2  15.24 m ¼ 23.42 m.
Doubling the surface area would give ﬁnal dimensions of
15.24 m wide  46.82 m long or 30.48 m wide  23.42 m long.
4.2.6. In-Pond Settling
In-pond settling is an efﬂuent treatment system used in farm ponds, where waste is allowed
to settle inside the rearing area. In-pond settling occurs in earthen ponds where the rearing
area is also used for solids settling. In order to minimize the solids leaving the pond, ﬁsh are
harvested at the upstream end of these ponds. Once ﬁsh is harvested, water is diverted around
the pond to allow removal of solids. These ponds are always small in size with a low ﬂow.
They are often positioned on water supplies that receive some irrigation water and can supply
a net reduction in solids and nutrients from incoming ﬂow. Nearly all farm pond systems
allow the operator to direct water around any pond while keeping other ponds in production.
Hence, solids can be collected while there is no efﬂuent from the pond.
4.2.7. Rearing Area
The rearing area is the part that is used for ﬁsh production. Circular tank efﬂuent water is
collected and passed through a downstream settling zone since the tanks are equipped with
self-cleaning facilities. Rearing area design, equipment, and management affect both ﬁsh
health and feed conversion, inﬂuencing the amount of nutrients and solids produced. The most
common rearing unit is a concrete raceway as shown in Fig. 15.12 [5]. Typical dimensions are
3.048–5.48 m in width, 24.38–45.72 m in length, and 0.76–1.066 m in water depth, creating
ideal conditions for personnel and facilitating ﬁsh production and solids collection [5]. Water
ﬂow in these raceways will range from 84.95 to 169.9 L/s. A typical earthen pond will be
6.096 m wide (20 ft), 45.72 m (150 ft) long, and 1.219 m (4 ft) deep with 99.1 L/s (3.5 cfs) of
ﬂow [5]. Best dimensions and water ﬂow for any raceway depends on the amount of total
water, harvest strategy, numbers of ﬁsh routinely available, and size of ﬁsh.
4.2.8. Bafﬂes
Bafﬂes are linked to the side walls of a raceway and extend from side to side and from the
water surface to 25–100 mm (1–4 in.) above the pond ﬂoor. Bafﬂes are as shown in Fig. 15.13.
Flow velocity along the bottom of the pond is increased by the water ﬂow underneath the bafﬂes,
moving solids gently downstream to QZs for collection and efﬁcient removal. However, bafﬂes
744
Y.-T. Hung et al.

may become a place for moss growth in the summer and this is problematic. Bafﬂes are
normally made of lightweight materials (aluminum, ﬁberglass, or synthetic lagoon pond
liner) for ease of use. Placement of bafﬂes at the right location provides continuous cleaning
of the rearing area. Placement of bafﬂes will differ with ﬁsh size, ﬂow, and pond dimensions.
4.2.9. Flow Control
It is important for the ﬂow rate to be varied according to stocking density and ﬁsh size. In
order to manage the ﬂow rate, the water inlets to rearing ponds need to be adjustable. Laminar
ﬂow in rearing areas is preferable to avoid dead zones in ponds where solids will deposit and
cause ﬁsh health problems. Laminar ﬂows in rearing areas will provide the required laminar ﬂow
in QZs and keep solids close to the bottom as they approach the QZ. Consideration of laminar
ﬂow requirements is essential in designing water inﬂow and outﬂow for rearing areas in QZs.
4.2.10. Dissolved Oxygen
One of the measures of water quality is the DO levels at the rearing areas and the efﬂuent. By
fully utilizing the across of the facility, DO can be maximized for aquaculture process control.

745

4.2.11. Fish Barriers and Predator Control
Fish barriers are very important to be designed correctly in rearing areas in order to keep
ﬁsh in the pond at both the inﬂuent and efﬂuent. Consideration of access and safety of
personnel is also essential. Finally, elimination of predators, especially birds, has to be
considered in the design. Predators can spread disease among ﬁsh populations resulting in
higher efﬂuent solids due to bad feed conversions.
5. APPLICATION OF AQUACULTURE SYSTEM FOR WASTEWATER
TREATMENT AND WATER CONSERVATION
Aquaculture or aquafarming is the cultivation of aquatic populations, including both
aquatic animals and plants, under controlled environments [1–21]. If the products are foods,
aquaculture is a food production process. The wastewater generated from the aquaculture
system during food production needs to be properly treated for environmental conservation.
Aquaculture systems introduced in previous sections of this chapter are for harvesting aquatic
animals (such as ﬁsh), therefore are aquafarming processes. Proper wastewater treatment
aiming at water reuse has been discussed.
The aquaculture systems with the same theory, principles, operating procedures, and manage-
ment methods can be used for wastewater treatment [22–24]. Under this condition, the aquatic
animals and plants are used as means for wastewater treatment, the main product is the treated
efﬂuent which is either reused as non-potable water or recharged to the underground becoming
the groundwater. The aquatic plants or animals harvested from aquaculture are the by-products.
This section introduces wastewater treatment applications of various aquaculture systems.
5.1. Aquaculture Wastewater Treatment: Water Hyacinth System
Aquaculture or the production of aquatic organisms (both ﬂora and fauna) under controlled
conditions has been practiced for centuries, primarily for the generation of food, ﬁber, and
fertilizer. The water hyacinth (Eichhorina crassipes) appears to be the most promising
organism for wastewater treatment and has received the most attention. However, other
organisms are being studied. Among them are duckweed, seaweed, midge larvae, alligator
weeds, and a host of other organisms. Water hyacinths are large fast-growing ﬂoating aquatic
plants with broad, glossy green leaves and light lavender ﬂowers. A native of South America,
water hyacinths are found naturally in waterways, bayous, and other backwaters throughout
the South. Insects and disease have little effect on the hyacinth and they thrive in raw, as well
as partially treated, wastewater. Wastewater treatment by water hyacinths is accomplished by
passing the wastewater through a hyacinth-covered basin where the plants remove nutrients,
BOD/COD/TOC, suspended solids, heavy metals, etc. Batch treatment and ﬂow-through
systems, using single and multiple cell units, are all possible. The treated wastewater is
reused in a natural environment or recharged to the underground becoming the groundwater.
Hyacinths harvested from these systems have been investigated as a fertilizer/soil conditioner
after composting, animal feed, and a source of methane when anaerobically digested. The
practical applications, design criteria, process performance, and water conservation efﬁcien-
cies of the process can be found in the literature [22].

5.2. Aquaculture Wastewater Treatment: Natural Wetland System
Aquaculture-wetland systems for wastewater treatment include natural and artiﬁcial wet-
lands as well as other aquatic systems involving the production of algae and higher plants
(both submerged and emergent), invertebrates, and ﬁsh. Natural wetlands, both marine and
freshwater, have inadvertently served as natural waste treatment systems for centuries;
however, in recent years, marshes, swamps, bogs, and other wetland areas have been
successfully utilized as managed natural “nutrient sinks” for polishing partially treated
efﬂuents under relatively controlled conditions. Constructed wetlands can be designed to
meet speciﬁc project conditions while providing new wetland areas that also improve
available wildlife wetland habitats and other numerous beneﬁts of wetland areas. Managed
planting of reeds (e.g., Phragmites sp.) and rushes (e.g., Scirpus spp. and Schoenoplectus spp.)
as well as managed natural and constructed marshes, swamps, and bogs have been demon-
strated to reliably provide pH neutralization and reduction of nutrients, heavy metals,
organics, BOD/COD/TOC, suspended solids, fecal coliforms, and pathogenic bacteria.
Wastewater treatment by natural and constructed wetland systems is generally accom-
plished by sprinkling or ﬂood irrigating the wastewater into the wetland area or by passing the
wastewater through a system of shallow ponds, channels, basins, or other constructed areas
where the emergent aquatic vegetation has been planted or naturally occurs and is actively
growing. The treated wastewater is totally reused in a natural environment achieving almost
100 % water conservation. The vegetation produced as a result of the system’s operation may
or may not be removed and can be utilized for various purposes: (a) composted for use as
source of fertilizer/soil conditioner and (b) dried or otherwise processed for use as animal feed
supplements or digested to produce methane. The practical applications, design criteria,
process performance, and water conservation efﬁciencies of the process can be found from
the literature [22].
5.3. Aquaculture Wastewater Treatment: Man-Made Living Machine System
The natural wetland aquaculture system described in Sect. 5.2 adopts the natural environ-
ment as much as possible, and the entire process system except the inlet is controlled by
gravity ﬂow. The Living Machine system is also a man-made, patented wetland aquaculture
wastewater treatment system which adapts and enhances the ecological processes in a series
of tidal wetland cells or basins. Each cell or basin is ﬁlled with special gravel that promotes
the development of micro-ecosystems. A computer controls ﬁll and drain cycles, alternating
anoxic (without oxygen) and aerobic (with oxygen) conditions. As wastewater moves through
the system, the cells are alternately ﬂooded and drained to create multiple tidal cycles each
day, much like one ﬁnds in nature, resulting in high-quality reusable water. The cells/basins
may be located inside and outside a greenhouse (depending on the region), wastewater ﬂow
always is below the surface of watertight cells in the pore spaces between rock particles so
there is no smell, mosquitoes, or potential of contamination for people or wildlife. This tidal
cycling helps make the Living Machine technology an efﬁcient wastewater treatment and
water reuse system [24].

Abstract Technical and legal terms commonly used by water resources engineers are
introduced in this chapter. With the current trend toward metrication, the question of using
a consistent system of units has been a problem. Wherever possible, the authors of this
Handbook of Environmental Engineering series have used the US customary system (fps)
along with the metric equivalent (SIU) or vice versa. For the convenience of the readers
around the world, this book provides detailed conversion factors and glossary terms for water
resources engineers. In addition, the basic and supplementary units, the derived units and
quantities, important physical constants, the properties of water, and the periodic table of the
elements are also presented in this chapter [1–3].

A kelvin (K) is the degree interval of the thermodynamic scale on which the temperature of the triple
point of water is 273.16 degrees.
A candle is such that the luminance of a full radiator at the temperature of solidiﬁcation of platinum is
60 units of luminous intensity per square centimeter.
A mole (mol) is the amount of substance which contains as many elementary units as there are atoms in
0.012 kg of carbon-12. The elementary unit must be speciﬁed and may be an atom, an ion, an
electron, a photon, etc., or a given group of such entities.
A radian is the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc of the circle equal in length to the
radius of the circle.
A steradian is the solid angle that, having its vertex at the center of a sphere, cuts off an area of the
surface of the sphere equal to that of a square with sides of length equal to the radius of the sphere.
3. DERIVED UNITS AND QUANTITIES
The liter was deﬁned in 1901 as the volume of 1 kilogram of pure water at normal atmospheric pressure
and maximum density equal therefore to 1.000028 dm3. This 1901 deﬁnition applied for the purpose
of the 1963 Weights and Measures Acts.
By a resolution of the 12th Conference General des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) in 1964 the word liter is
now recognized as a special name for the dm3, but is not used to express high precision measure-
ments. It is used widely in engineering and the retail business, where the discrepancy of 28 parts in 1
million is of negligible signiﬁcance.
A newton (N) is the force that, when applied to a body of mass of one kilogram, gives it an acceleration
of one meter per second per second.
Stress is deﬁned as the resultant internal force per unit area resisting change in the shape or size of a
body acted on by external forces, and is therefore measured in newtons per square meter (N/m2).
A bar is a pressure equivalent to 100,000 newtons acting on an area of one square metor.
A joule (J) is the work done when the point of application of a force of one newton is displaced through
a distance of one meter in the direction of the force.
A watt is equal to one joule per second.
Dynamic viscosity is the property of a ﬂuid whereby it tends to resist relative motion within itself. It is
the shear stress, i.e., the tangential force on unit area, between two inﬁnite horizontal planes at unit
distance apart, one of which is ﬁxed while the other moves with unit velocity. In other words, it is
the shear stress divided by the velocity gradient, i.e., (N/m2)  (m/sec/m) = N sec/m2.
Kinematic viscosity is the dynamic viscosity of a ﬂuid divided by its density, i.e., (N sec/m2)/(kg/m3) =
m2/sec.
Density of heat ﬂow rate (or heat ﬂux) is the heat ﬂow rate (W) per unit area, i.e., W/m2.
Coefﬁcient of heat transfer is the heat ﬂow rate (W) per unit area per unit temperature difference, i.e.,
W/m2 C.
Thermal conductivity is the quantity of heat that will be conducted in unit time through unit area of a
slab of material of unit thickness with a unit difference of temperature between the faces; in other
words, the heat ﬂow rate (W) per unit area per unit temperature gradient, i.e., W/[m2( C/m)] = W/
m C.
The heat capacity of a substance is the quantity of heat gained or lost by the substance per unit
temperature change, i.e., J/ C.
804
M.-H.S. Wang and L.K. Wang

Speciﬁc heat capacity is the heat capacity per unit mass of the substance, i.e., J/kg C.
Internal energy is the kinetic energy possessed by the molecules of a substance due to temperature and
is measured in joules (J).
Speciﬁc internal energy (u) is the internal energy per unit mass of the substance, i.e., J/kg. When a
small amount of heat is added at constant volume the increase in speciﬁc internal energy is given by:
du = cv dT, where cv is the speciﬁc heat capacity at constant volume, and dT is the increase in
absolute temperature.
Speciﬁc enthalpy (h) is deﬁned by the equation: h = u + pv, where p is the pressure and v is the speciﬁc
volume. Speciﬁc enthalpy is measured in J/kg. When a small amount of heat is added to a substance
at constant pressure, the increase in speciﬁc enthalpy is given by: dh = cp dT, where cp is the
speciﬁc heat capacity at constant pressure.
The speciﬁc latent heat of a substance is the heat gained per unit mass without an accompanying rise in
temperature during a change of state at constant pressure. It is measured in J/kg.
The entropy (S) of a substance is such that when a small amount of heat is added, the increase in
entropy is equal to the quantity of heat added (dQ) divided by the absolute temperature (T) at which
the heat is absorbed; i.e., dS = dQ/T, measured in J/K.
The speciﬁc entropy (s) of a substance is the entropy per unit mass, i.e., J/kgK.
A volt is the difference of electric potential between two points of a conductor carrying a constant
current of one ampere when the power dissipated is one watt.
A weber (Wb) is the magnetic ﬂux through a conductor with a resistance of one ohm when reversal of
the direction of the magnetic ﬂux causes the transfer of one coulomb in the conductor loop.
Tesla: The magnetic ﬂux density is the normal magnetic ﬂux per unit area and is measured in teslas.
A lumen, the unit of luminous ﬂux, is the ﬂux emitted within unit solid angle of one steradian by a point
source having a uniform intensity of one candle.
A lux is an illumination of one lumen per square meter.
Luminance is the luminous intensity per unit area of a source of light or of an illumination. It is
measured in candles per square meter.

7. GLOSSARY FOR WATER RESOURCES ENGINEERS
Ablation The process by which ice and snow waste away, owing to melting and evaporation.
Absorption The entrance of water into the soil or rocks by all natural processes. It includes the
inﬁltration of precipitation or snowmelt, gravity ﬂow of streams into the valley alluvium (see Bank
storage) into sinkholes or other large openings, and the movement of atmospheric moisture.
Acequia Acequias are gravity-driven waterways, similar in concept to a ﬂume. Most are simple
ditches with dirt banks, but they can be lined with concrete. They were important forms of irrigation
in the development of agriculture in the American Southwest. The proliferation of cotton, pecans,
and green chile as major agricultural staples owes their progress to the acequia system.
Acid A substance that has a pH of less than 7, which is neutral. Speciﬁcally, an acid has more free
hydrogen ions (H+) than hydroxyl ions (OH).
Acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) The equivalent capacity of a solution to neutralize strong acids.
Acid rain or acid precipitation Precipitation having a pH lower than the pH range commonly found
in natural waters, caused by absorption from the atmosphere of sulfur dioxide gas and nitrogen
oxides gas, which then forms sulfuric acid and nitric acid, respectively, in solution.
Action level The level of toxic substances (such as lead or copper) which, if exceeded, triggers
treatment or other requirements that a water system must follow.
Acute health effect An immediate (i.e., within hours or days) effect that may result from exposure to
certain drinking water contaminants (e.g., pathogens).
Advisory A nonregulatory document that communicates risk information to those who may have to
make risk management decisions. For example, a ﬁsh consumption advisory may recommend that
people limit or avoid eating certain species of ﬁsh caught from certain lakes, rivers, or coastal
waters. In some cases, advisories may include recommendations for speciﬁc groups (such as infants,
children, the elderly, or women who are pregnant or may become pregnant).
Agricultural and animal waste Waste generated by the production and harvest of crops or trees or
the rearing of animals. Animal waste is a subset of agricultural waste and includes waste (e.g., feed
waste, bedding and litter, and feedlot and paddock runoff) from livestock, dairy, and other animal-
related agricultural and farming practices.
Agricultural land Land on which a food, feed, or ﬁber crop is grown. This includes rangeland or land
used as pasture.
Agronomic rate The whole sludge application rate designed to (1) provide the amount of nitrogen
needed by a crop or vegetation grown on the land and (2) minimize the amount of nitrogen in the
sewage sludge that passes below the root zone of the crop or vegetation grown on the land to the
groundwater.
Air pollutant Any substance in air that could, in high enough concentration, harm humans, animals,
vegetation, or material. Air pollutants can include almost any natural or artiﬁcial composition of
matter capable of being airborne—solid particles, liquid droplets, gases, or a combination thereof.
Air pollutants are often grouped in categories for ease in classiﬁcation; some of the categories are
sulfur compounds, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, nitrogen compounds, and radio-
active compounds.
Air quality index (AQI) An index for reporting daily air quality that characterizes air pollution levels
and associated health effects that might be of concern. The US EPA calculates the AQI for ﬁve
criteria pollutants. AQI values range from 0 to 500; the higher the AQI value, the greater the level of
air pollution and the greater the health concern. AQI values below 100 are generally thought of as
Glossary and Conversion factors
809

satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air quality is considered to be unhealthy—at ﬁrst for
certain sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values get higher.
Air quality system (AQS) US EPA’s electronic repository of ambient air monitoring data collected
by US EPA and state, local, and tribal air pollution control agencies from thousands of monitoring
stations. The AQS contains monitoring data, descriptive information about monitoring stations, and
data quality assurance and quality control information.
Air toxics Air pollutants that cause or may cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as
reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental and ecological effects. Examples of
toxic air pollutants include benzene (found in gasoline), perchloroethylene (emitted from some dry
cleaning facilities), and methylene chloride (used as a solvent by a number of industries). Air toxics
are also known as hazardous air pollutants.
Algal bloom A sudden, excessive growth of algae in a waterbody.
Alkaline Sometimes water or soils contain an amount of alkali (strongly basic) substances sufﬁcient
to raise the pH value above 7.0 and be harmful to the growth of crops.
Alkalinity The capacity of water for neutralizing an acid solution.
Alluvium Deposits of clay, silt, sand, gravel, or other particulate material that have been deposited by
a stream or other bodies of running water in a streambed, on a ﬂood plain, on a delta, or at the base of
a mountain.
Ambient monitoring Monitoring within natural systems (e.g., lakes, rivers, estuaries, wetlands) to
determine existing conditions.
Anabranch A diverging branch of a river which reenters the mainstream.
Anaerobic Without oxygen; water and sediment environments without oxygen produce, for example,
chemical conditions that precipitate and permanently store many metals from water and that release
dissolved phosphorus to the water.
Anchor ice Ice in the bed of a stream or upon a submerged body or structure.
Annual ﬂood The highest peak discharge in a water year.
Annual ﬂood series A list of annual ﬂoods.
Annual pollutant loading rate (APLR) The maximum amount of a pollutant that can be applied to a
unit area of land during a 365-day period. This term describes pollutant limits for sewage sludge that
is given away or sold in a bag or other container for application to the land.
Annual whole sludge application rate The maximum amount of sewage sludge on a dry weight basis
that can be applied to a land application site during a 365-day (1-year) period.
Antecedent precipitation index An index of moisture stored within a drainage basin before a storm.
Anthropogenic Originating from humans; not naturally occurring.
Appropriation doctrine The system for allocating water to private individuals used in most Western
states. The doctrine of prior appropriation was in common use throughout the arid West as early
settlers and miners began to develop the land. The prior appropriation doctrine is based on the
concept of “First in Time, First in Right.” The ﬁrst person to take a quantity of water and put it to
beneﬁcial use has a higher priority of right than a subsequent user. Under drought conditions,
higher-priority users are satisﬁed before junior users receive water. Appropriative rights can be lost
through nonuse; they can also be sold or transferred apart from the land. Contrasts with riparian
water rights.
Aquaculture (1) Farming of plants and animals that live in water, such as ﬁsh, shellﬁsh, and algae;
(2) a process for removing pollutants from water through the use of aquatic plants (such as water
hyacinths) in pond contaminants. The contaminants are either synthesized by, or bioaccumulated in,
the aquatic plants, which ultimately are harvested for disposal.

Aquaculture, living machine system A man-made wastewater-treatment system which adapts and
enhances the ecological processes in a series of tidal wetland cells or basins. Each cell or basin is
ﬁlled with special gravel that promotes the development of micro-ecosystems. A computer controls
ﬁll and drain cycles, alternating anoxic (without oxygen) and aerobic (with oxygen) conditions. As
wastewater moves through the system, the cells are alternately ﬂooded and drained to create multiple
tidal cycles each day, much like one ﬁnds in nature, resulting in high-quality reusable water.
Aquaculture, natural and constructed wetland systems The aquatic wastewater-treatment systems
involve in the production of algae and higher plants (both submerged and emergent), invertebrates,
and ﬁsh for wastewater treatment and water conservation. Wastewater treatment by natural and
constructed wetland systems is generally accomplished by sprinkling or ﬂood irrigating the waste-
water into the wetland area or by passing the wastewater through a system of shallow ponds,
channels, basins, or other constructed areas where the emergent aquatic vegetation has been planted
or naturally occurs and is actively growing. The treated wastewater is totally reused in a natural
environment, achieving almost 100 % water conservation. The vegetation produced as a result of the
system’s operation may or may not be removed and can be utilized for various purposes:
(a) composted for use as source of fertilizer/soil conditioner and (b) dried or otherwise processed
for use as animal feed supplements, or digested to produce methane.
Aquaculture, water hyacinth system Wastewater treatment by aquaculture water hyacinth system is
accomplished by passing the wastewater through a hyacinth-covered basin where the plants remove
nutrients, BOD/COD/TOC, suspended solids, heavy metals, etc. Batch treatment and ﬂow-through
systems, using single and multiple cell units, are all possible. The treated wastewater is reused in a
natural environment or recharged to the underground, becoming new groundwater. Hyacinths
harvested from these systems can be used as a fertilizer/soil conditioner after composting, an animal
feed, and a source of methane when anaerobically digested.
Aqueduct A pipe, conduit, or channel designed to transport water from a remote source, usually by
gravity.
Aquifer A natural underground geological formation, often of sand or gravel, that is water bearing. A
geological formation or structure that stores and/or transmits water, such as to wells and springs.
Use of the term is usually restricted to those water-bearing formations capable of yielding water in
sufﬁcient quantity to constitute a usable supply for people’s uses.
Aquifer (conﬁned) Soil or rock below the land surface that is saturated with water. There are layers of
impermeable material both above and below it, and it is under pressure so that when the aquifer is
penetrated by a well, the water will rise above the top of the aquifer.
Aquifer (unconﬁned) An aquifer whose upper water surface (water table) is at atmospheric pressure
and thus is able to rise and fall.
Area of cropland An area of cropland that has been subdivided into several strips is not a single ﬁeld.
Rather, each strip represents an individual ﬁeld unit.
Area source A source of air pollution that is released over an area that cannot be classiﬁed as a point
source. Area sources can include vehicles and other small engines, small businesses and household
activities, or biogenic sources such as a forest that releases hydrocarbons.
Area-capacity curve A graph showing the relation between the surface area of the water in a
reservoir and the corresponding volume.
Arid Pertaining to climatic conditions or a soil that lacks humidity.
Arid climate A climate characterized by less than 10 in. (25.4 cm) of annual rainfall.
Artesian water Groundwater that is under pressure when tapped by a well and is able to rise above the
level at which it is ﬁrst encountered. It may or may not ﬂow out at ground level. The pressure in such
Glossary and Conversion factors
811

an aquifer commonly is called artesian pressure, and the formation containing artesian water is an
artesian aquifer or conﬁned aquifer. See Flowing well.
Artiﬁcial recharge A process where water is put back into groundwater storage from surface-water
supplies such as irrigation or induced inﬁltration from streams or wells.
Average discharge In the annual series of the US Geological Survey’s reports on surface-water
supply, average discharge is the arithmetic average of all complete water years of record whether or
not they are consecutive. Average discharge is not published for less than 5 years of record. The
term “average” is generally reserved for average of record, and “mean” is used for averages of
shorter periods, namely, daily mean discharge.
Backwater (1) Water backed up or retarded in its course as compared with its normal or natural
condition of ﬂow. (2) The increased depth of water upstream from an obstruction (such as dam, ice,
weed, etc.) in a stream channel caused by the existence of such obstruction. (3) a water reserve
obtained at high tide, and discharged at low tide.
Bagged sewage sludge Sewage sludge that is sold or given away in a bag or another container (i.e.,
either an open or a closed receptacle containing 1 metric ton or less of sewage sludge).
Bank The margins of a channel. Banks are called right or left as viewed facing in the direction of
the ﬂow.
Bank storage The water absorbed into the banks of a stream channel, when the stages rise above the
water table in the bank formations, then returns to the channel as efﬂuent seepage when the stages
fall below the water table.
Bankfull stage Stage at which a stream ﬁrst overﬂows its natural banks.
Base A substance that has a pH of more than 7, which is neutral. A base has less free hydrogen ions
(H+) than hydroxyl ions (OH).
Base discharge (for peak discharge) In the US Geological Survey’s annual reports on surface-water
supply, this is the discharge above which peak discharge data are published. The base discharge at
each station is selected so that an average of about three peaks a year will be presented. (See also
Partial-duration ﬂood series.)
Base ﬂow Sustained ﬂow of a stream in the absence of direct runoff. It includes natural and human-
induced streamﬂows. Natural base ﬂow is sustained largely by groundwater discharges. (Also see
Base runoff.)
Base runoff Sustained or fair weather runoff. In most streams, base runoff is composed largely of
groundwater efﬂuent. The term base ﬂow is often used in the same sense as base runoff. However,
the distinction is the same as that between streamﬂow and runoff. When the concept in the terms
base ﬂow and base runoff is that of the natural ﬂow in a stream, base runoff is the logical term.
Baseline A reference condition against which changes or trends are judged—usually a set of condi-
tions that exist at a particular point in time.
Basic hydrologic data Includes inventories of features of land and water that vary only from place to
place (topographic and geological maps are examples) and records of processes that vary with both
place and time. (Records of precipitation, streamﬂow, groundwater, and quality-of-water analyses
are examples.)
Basic hydrologic information It is a broader term that includes surveys of the water resources of
particular areas and a study of their physical and related economic processes, interrelations, and
mechanisms.
Basic-stage ﬂood series See Partial-duration ﬂood series.
Bedrock The solid rock beneath the soil and superﬁcial rock. A general term for solid rock that lies
beneath soil, loose sediments, or other unconsolidated material.

Benchmark A concentration or other accepted measures against which environmental conditions are
compared.
Beneﬁt maximization The process of increasing beneﬁts to the greatest extent possible within
constraints such as limitation on ﬁnancial resources.
Beneﬁts A good, service, or attribute of a good or service that promotes or enhances the well-being of
an individual, an organization, or a natural system.
Best available technology (1) A method that has been determined to be the most effective, practical
means of preventing or reducing pollution from nonpoint and point sources. (2) The water treatment
(s) that the government (such as the US Environmental Protection Agency) certiﬁes to be the most
effective for removing a contaminant.
Bioaccumulative compound A compound that tends to accumulate in tissues and build up in food
webs. Some bioaccumulative compounds can potentially have adverse effects on ecosystems or
human health.
Bioavailable The state of a toxicant such that there is increased physicochemical access to the
toxicant by an organism. The less the bioavailability of a toxicant, the less its toxic effect on an
organism.
Biogenic source An air emission source created by some sort of biological activity. Examples include
emissions resulting from microbial activity in soils and emissions from trees and other vegetation.
Emissions from biogenic sources are a subset of emissions from natural sources (see Natural source).
Biological balance The interrelationships among organisms, including the structure of food webs and
the ability of ecological systems to maintain themselves over time. Balance is a dynamic charac-
teristic, rather than a ﬁxed state.
Biological diversity The variety and variability among living organisms and the ecological com-
plexes in which they occur. Though it most often refers to the numbers of species, the term can
apply to levels of organization ranging from genes to ecosystems.
Biomarker A molecular or cellular indicator (or “marker”) of an event or condition (exposure, effect,
susceptibility) in a biological system or sample. It is the product of an interaction between a
contaminant and some target molecule or cell.
Biomarker of effect A measure of disease progression, representing a measurable alteration at the
molecular, cellular, or some other structural level in the body that can be recognized as a potential or
established adverse health effect. Such a biomarker can indicate a biological response or health
effect related to a chemical or other stressor; however, it is not always possible to link a biomarker
with exposure to a single substance.
Biomarker of exposure The level of a contaminant or its metabolite collected from the body or from
substances produced or excreted within biological systems. In humans, this measurement can reﬂect
the amount of the contaminant that is stored in the body, and is sometimes referred to as the body
burden. It indicates the level of exposure.
Biomarker of susceptibility A measurement of individual factors that can affect response to envi-
ronmental agents. Examples include enzymes whose presence or absence may reﬂect a particular
genetic condition.
Biomonitoring The measurement of human tissues or excreta from biological systems for direct or
indirect evidence of exposure to chemical, biological, or radiological substances.
Biosolids Biosolids are solids, semisolids, or liquid materials, resulting from biological treatment of
domestic sewage that has been sufﬁciently processed to permit these materials to be safely land
applied. The term of biosolids was introduced by the wastewater-treatment industry in the early
1990s and has been recently adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency

(US EPA) to distinguish high-quality, treated sewage sludge from raw sewage sludge and from
sewage sludge containing large amounts of pollutants.
Biotic environment The biological component of an ecosystem, including plants and animals.
Braiding of river channels Successive division and rejoining (of riverﬂow) with accompanying
islands is the important characteristic denoted by the synonymous terms, braided or anastomosing
stream. A braided stream is composed of anabranches.
Bulk sewage sludge Sewage sludge that is not sold or given away in a bag or other container for
application to the land.
Capillary action The means by which liquid moves through the porous spaces in a solid, such as soil,
plant roots, and the capillary blood vessels in our bodies, due to the forces of adhesion, cohesion,
and surface tension. Capillary action is essential in carrying substances and nutrients from one place
to another in plants and animals.
Catchment area See Drainage basin.
Ceiling concentration limits (CCL) The ceiling concentration limits are the maximum concentra-
tions of the nine trace elements allowed in biosolids to be land applied. Sewage sludge exceeding
the ceiling concentration limit for even one of the regulated pollutants is not classiﬁed as biosolids
and, hence, cannot be land applied.
Channel A conduit formed by the ﬂow of water and debris. The time and volume characteristics of
water or debris can be altered by man, by climate change, or by alterations in protective vegetal
cover on the land of the watershed. The stream channel adjusts to the new set of conditions.
Channel (watercourse) An open conduit either naturally or artiﬁcially created which periodically or
continuously contains moving water or which forms a connecting link between two bodies of water.
River, creek, run, branch, anabranch, and tributary are some of the terms used to describe natural
channels. Natural channels may be single or braided (see Braiding of river channels). Canal and
ﬂoodway are some of the terms used to describe artiﬁcial channels.
Channel storage The volume of water at a given time in the channel or over the ﬂood plain of the
streams in a drainage basin or river reach. Channel storage is great during the progress of a ﬂood
event.
Channelization The practice of straightening a waterway to remove meanders and make water ﬂow
faster. Sometimes concrete is used to line the sides and bottom of the channel.
Chronic health effect The possible result of exposure over many years to a drinking water contam-
inant at levels above its maximum contaminant level (MCL).
Clarity A measure of the amount of particles suspended in water, determined by using a disk or
turbidity test.
Class I sludge management facility Publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) required to have an
approved pretreatment program under 40 CFR 403.8(a), including any POTW located in a state that
has elected to assume local pretreatment program responsibilities under 40 CFR 403.10(e). In
addition, the Regional Administrator or, in the case of approved state programs, the Regional
Administrator in conjunction with the State Director has the discretion to designate any treatment
works treating domestic sewage (TWTDS) as a Class I sludge management facility.
Clean Water Act (CWA) The US law, codiﬁed generally as 33 USC 1251–1387, that establishes a
regulatory and enforcement program administered by the US EPA to control pollutant discharges
into US waters.
Cleanup Action taken to deal with a release (or threat of release) of a hazardous substance that could
affect humans and/or the environment. This term is sometimes used interchangeably with the terms
“remedial action,” “removal action,” “response action,” and “corrective action.”

Climate The sum total of the meteorologic elements that characterize the average and extreme
condition of the atmosphere over a long period of time at any one place or region of the Earth’s
surface. The collective state of the atmosphere at a given place or over a given area within a
speciﬁed period of time.
Climate change A term sometimes used to refer to all forms of climatic inconsistency; because the
Earth’s climate is never static, the term is more properly used to imply a signiﬁcant change from one
climatic condition to another. In some cases, “climate change” has been used synonymously with
“global warming.” Scientists, however, tend to use “climate change” in the wider sense to also
include natural changes in climate.
Climatic year A continuous 12-month period during which a complete annual cycle occurs, arbi-
trarily selected for the presentation of data relative to hydrologic or meteorologic phenomena. The
climatic year is usually designated by the calendar year during which most of the 12 months occur.
(See Water year.)
Cloudburst A torrential downpour of rain, which by its spottiness and relatively high intensity
suggests the bursting and discharge of a whole cloud at once.
Coastal waters Waters at the interface between terrestrial environments and the open ocean. Many
unique habitats lie in coastal waters—for example, estuaries, coastal wetlands, sea grass meadows,
coral reefs, mangrove and kelp forests, and upwelling areas.
Coliform A group of related bacteria whose presence in drinking water may indicate contamination
by disease-causing, pathogenic microorganisms.
Combined sewers and combined sewer overﬂow (CSO) Pipes that carry both storm water and
household sewage to sewage treatment plants. During a big storm, they may overﬂow and dump
untreated sewage into streams, lakes, and coastal waters. These overﬂows are called combined
sewer overﬂows or CSOs.
Commercial water use Water used for motels, hotels, restaurants, ofﬁce buildings, other commercial
facilities, and institutions. Water for commercial uses comes both from public-supplied sources,
such as a county water department, and self-supplied sources, such as local wells.
Community In ecology, an assemblage of populations of different species within a speciﬁed location
in space and time. Sometimes, a particular subgrouping may be speciﬁed, such as the ﬁsh commu-
nity in a lake or the soil arthropod community in a forest.
Community water system A water system which supplies drinking water to 25 or more of the same
people year-round in their residences.
Compliance The act of meeting all state and federal drinking water regulations.
Concentration time See Time of concentration.
Concordant ﬂows Flows at different points in a river system that have the same recurrence interval or
the same frequency of occurrence. It is most often applied to ﬂood ﬂows.
Condensation The process by which water vapor changes from the vapor state into the liquid or solid
state. Water drops on the outside of a cold glass of water are condensed water. It is the reverse of
evaporation.
Condition of ecology The state of a resource, generally reﬂecting a combination of physical,
chemical, and biological characteristics such as temperature, water clarity, chemical composition,
or the status of biological communities. The condition of fresh surface waters, groundwater,
wetlands, coastal waters, recreational waters, and consumable ﬁsh and shellﬁsh. (Also see Ecolog-
ical condition.)
Conservation storage Storage of water for later release for useful purposes such as municipal water
supply, power, or irrigation in contrast with storage capacity used for ﬂood control.

Constructed wetland or created wetland A wetland at a site where it did not formerly occur.
Constructed/created wetlands are designed to meet a variety of human beneﬁts including, but not
limited to, the treatment of water pollution discharges (e.g., municipal wastewater, storm water) and
the mitigation of wetland losses permitted under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
Construction and demolition debris Waste materials generated during the construction, renovation,
and demolition of buildings, roads, and bridges. Construction and demolition debris often contains
bulky, heavy materials such as concrete, wood (from buildings), asphalt (from roads and rooﬁng
shingles), gypsum (from drywall), metals, bricks, glass, plastics, building components (doors,
windows, plumbing ﬁxtures), and trees, stumps, earth, and rock from clearing sites.
Consumptive use (1) The quantity of water absorbed by the crop and transpired or used directly in the
building of plant tissue together with that evaporated from the cropped area. (2) The quantity of
water transpired and evaporated from a cropped area or the normal loss of water from the soil by
evaporation and plant transpiration. (3) The quantity of water discharged to the atmosphere or
incorporated in the products of the process in connection with vegetative growth, food processing,
or an industrial process. (4) The part of water withdrawn that is evaporated, transpired by plants,
incorporated into products or crops, consumed by humans or livestock, or otherwise removed from
the immediate water environment. Also referred to as water consumed.
Consumptive use, net (1) The consumptive use decreased by the estimated contribution by rainfall
toward the production of irrigated crops. (2) Net consumptive use is sometimes called crop
irrigation requirement.
Consumptive waste The water that returns to the atmosphere without beneﬁting man.
Contaminant (1) Anything found in the environment (including microorganisms, minerals,
chemicals, radionuclides) which may be harmful to human health. (2) Any physical, chemical,
biological, or radiological substance or matter that has an adverse effect on air, water, or soil.
Contaminated land Land that has been polluted with hazardous materials and requires cleanup or
remediation. Contaminated lands include sites contaminated as a result of improper handling or disposal
of toxic and hazardous wastes, sites where improper handling or accidents released toxic or hazardous
materials that are not wastes, and sites where toxics may have been deposited by wind or ﬂooding.
Contents The volume of water in a reservoir. Unless otherwise indicated reservoir content is
computed on the basis of a level pool and does not include bank storage.
Control A natural constriction of the channel, a long reach of the channel, a stretch of rapids, or an
artiﬁcial structure downstream from a gaging station that determines the stage-discharge relation at
the gage. A control may be complete or partial. A complete control exists where the stage-discharge
relation at a gaging station is entirely independent of ﬂuctuations in stage downstream from the
control. A partial control exists where downstream ﬂuctuations have some effect upon the stage-
discharge relation at a gaging station. A control, either partial or complete, may also be shifting.
Most natural controls are shifting to a degree, but a shifting control exists where the stage-discharge
relation experiences frequent changes owing to impermanent bed or banks.
Conveyance loss Water that is lost in transit from a pipe, canal, or ditch by leakage or evaporation.
Generally, the water is not available for further use; however, leakage from an irrigation ditch, for
example, may percolate to a groundwater source and be available for further use.
Correlation The process of establishing a relation between a variable and one or more related
variables. Correlation is simple if there is only one independent variable; multiple, if there is
more than one independent variable. For gaging-station records, the usual variables are the short-
term gaging-station record and one or more long-term gaging-station records.

Correlative estimate A discharge determined by correlation. A correlative estimate represents a
likely value of the discharge for any particular period—commonly a month—according to a
speciﬁed method of analysis.
Cost minimization The process of reducing costs to the lowest possible amount given constraints
such as requirements that a speciﬁed level of beneﬁts or other resources be attained or provided.
Criteria pollutants A group of six widespread and common air pollutants that US EPA regulates on
the basis of standards set to protect public health or the environment (see National Ambient Air
Quality Standards). The six criteria pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone,
particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide.
Crop group Individual farm ﬁelds that are managed in the same manner, with the similar yield goals,
are called a crop group.
Crop management The management involves crop group identiﬁcation, crop nitrogen deﬁcit deter-
mination, crop nitrogen fertilizer rate calculation, and crop yield optimization.
Crop nitrogen deﬁcit (CND) Crop nitrogen deﬁcit (CND) equals to anticipated crop nitrogen
fertilizer rate (CNFR) minus all past PAN sources (PAN-past) and current planned non-biosolids
PAN sources (PAN-plan) in the unit of lb N/acre. Previous biosolid carry-over nitrogen is included
in this calculation.
Crop nitrogen fertilizer rate (CNFR) CNFR is a rate (lb N/acre) ¼ (yield) (UNFR), where UNFR is
the unit nitrogen fertilizer rate (lb N/unit crop yield) and yield is the crop harvested or crop yield
(bu/acre or ton/acre).
Crop year The basic time management unit is often called the crop year or planting season. The crop
year is deﬁned as the year in which a crop receiving the biosolids/manure treatment is harvested. For
example, fall applications of biosolids/manure in 2000 intended to provide nutrients for a crop to be
harvested in 2001 are earmarked for crop year 2001. Likewise, biosolids/manure applied immedi-
ately prior to planting winter wheat in October 2000 should be identiﬁed as fertilizer intended for
crop year 2001 because the wheat will be harvested in the summer of 2001.
Crop yield It is the crop harvested in the unit of bu/acre or ton/acre.
Cryology Science of ice and snow.
Cryptosporidium A microorganism commonly found in lakes and rivers, which is highly resistant to
disinfection and has caused several large outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness, with symptoms that
include diarrhea, nausea, and/or stomach cramps.
Cumulative pollutant loading rate (CPLR) CPLR equals to the total amount of pollutant that can be
applied to a site in its lifetime by all bulk biosolid applications meeting CCL. It is the maximum
amount of an inorganic pollutant that can be applied to an area of land. This term applies to bulk
sewage sludge that is land applied.
Current meter An instrument for measuring the speed of ﬂowing water. The Geological Survey uses
a rotating cup meter.
CWA §101 The objective of the Clean Water Act (CWA) is to restore and maintain the chemical,
physical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters.
CWA §303d This section of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires states to identify waters that do not
or are not expected to meet applicable water quality standards with technology-based controls
alone. Waters impacted by thermal discharges are also to be identiﬁed. After the identiﬁcation and
priority ranking of water quality-limited waters are completed, states are to develop TMDLs at a
level necessary to achieve the applicable state water quality standards.

CWA §314 This section of the Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes the Clean Lakes Program, which
supports activities from initial identiﬁcation of potential water quality problems through post-
restoration monitoring. Cooperative grants provide funding for these activities.
CWA §319 This section of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires states to develop nonpoint-source
control programs. The US EPA awards grants to implement approved programs that include, as
appropriate, nonregulatory and regulatory programs for enforcement, technical assistance, ﬁnancial
assistance, education, training, technology transfer, and demonstration projects.
CWA §320 This section of the Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes the National Estuary Program
(NEP), a demonstration program designed to show how estuaries and their living resources can be
protected through comprehensive, action-oriented management. Participation in the NEP is limited
to estuaries determined by the US EPA Administrator to be of “national signiﬁcance” after
nomination by the Governors of the states in which the estuaries are located.
CWA §402 This section of the Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES), which provides for the issuance of point-source permits to discharge
any pollutant or combination of pollutants, after opportunity for public hearing.
CWA §404 The discharges of dredged or ﬁll material into wetlands is regulated under this section of
the CWA. Permits may be issued after notice and opportunity for public hearings.
Cycle A regularly recurring succession of events such as the cycle of the seasons. Use of cycle to
describe a group of wet years followed or preceded by a group of dry years is to be avoided.
Dead storage The volume in a reservoir below the lowest controllable level.
Deleted NPL site A site that has been deleted from the Superfund National Priorities List because its
cleanup goals have been met and there is no further need for federal action. (See Superfund and
National Priorities List.)
Dependable yield, n-years The minimum supply of a given water development that is available on
demand, with the understanding that lower yields will occur once in n-years, on the average.
Depletion The progressive withdrawal of water from surface- or groundwater reservoirs at a rate
greater than that of replenishment. (See Recession curve and Streamﬂow depletion.)
Depression storage The volume of water contained in natural depressions in the land surface, such as
puddles.
Desalination The removal of salts from saline water to provide freshwater. This method is becoming
a more popular way of providing freshwater to populations.
Designated use Simple narrative description of water quality expectations or water quality goals. A
designated use is a legally recognized description of a desired use of the waterbody, such as
(1) support of communities of aquatic life, (2) body contact recreation, (3) ﬁsh consumption, and
(4) public drinking water supply. These are uses that the state or authorized tribe wants the
waterbody to be healthy enough to fully support. The US Clean Water Act requires that waterbodies
attain or maintain the water quality needed to support designated uses.
Direct runoff The runoff entering stream channels promptly after rainfall or snowmelt. Superposed
on base runoff, it forms the bulk of the hydrograph of a ﬂood.
Discharge In its simplest concept discharge means outﬂow; therefore, the use of this term is not
restricted as to course or location, and it can be applied to describe the ﬂow of water from a pipe or
from a drainage basin. If the discharge occurs in some course or channel, it is correct to speak of the
discharge of a canal or of a river. It is also correct to speak of the discharge of a canal or stream into a
lake, a stream, or an ocean. (See also Streamﬂow and Runoff.) The data in the reports of the
Geological Survey on surface water represent the total ﬂuids measured. Thus, the terms discharge,
streamﬂow, and runoff represent water with the solids dissolved in it and the sediment mixed with

it. Of these terms, discharge is the most comprehensive. The discharge of drainage basins is
distinguished as follows: (1) yield, total water runout or crop, includes runoff plus underﬂow;
(2) runoff, that part of water yield that appears in streams; and (3) streamﬂow, the actual ﬂow in
streams, whether or not subject to regulation, or underﬂow. Each of these terms can be reported in
total volumes (such as acre-feet) or time rates (such as cubic feet per second or acre-feet per year).
The differentiation between runoff as a volume and streamﬂow as a rate is not accepted.
Discharge The volume of water that passes a given location within a given period of time. Usually
expressed in cubic feet per second.
Discharge rating curve See Stage-discharge relation.
Disinfectant A chemical (commonly chlorine, chloramine, or ozone) or physical process (e.g.,
ultraviolet light) that kills microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa.
Dissolved oxygen (DO) The amount of oxygen dissolved in water. The amount is usually expressed in

Drawdown A lowering of the groundwater surface caused by pumping.
Drinking water quality Refers to whether contaminants are present in water that people drink,
including water from the tap, private wells, hauled water, untreated surface-water sources, and
bottled water, at levels that could affect human health.
Drinking water standards Regulations that the government, such as the US EPA, sets to control the
level of contaminants in the nation’s drinking water. Enforceable standards include maximum
contaminant levels (MCLs) and treatment techniques (TTs) (see separate entries for each). Drinking
water standards apply to all public water systems (see Public water system).
Drip irrigation A common irrigation method where pipes or tubes ﬁlled with water slowly drip onto
crops. Drip irrigation is a low-pressure method of irrigation and less water is lost to evaporation than
high-pressure spray irrigation.
Drop structure A natural or man-placed structure that disrupts the continuous surface ﬂow pattern in
a river or stream by producing a pooling of water behind the structure and a rapid drop in the surface
gradient for water ﬂowing over the structure; used to improve habitat conditions for aquatic life and
to increase the air (especially oxygen) content of water.
Drought A period of deﬁcient precipitation or runoff extending over an indeﬁnite number of days, but
with no set standard by which to determine the amount of deﬁciency needed to constitute a drought.
Thus, there is no universally accepted quantitative deﬁnition of drought; generally, each investiga-
tor establishes his/her own deﬁnition. When in an area that is ordinarily classed as humid, natural
vegetation becomes desiccated or defoliates unseasonably and crops fail to mature owing to lack of
precipitation, or when precipitation is insufﬁcient to meet the needs of established human activities,
drought conditions may be said to prevail. Although water for irrigation or other uses in arid areas is
always limited, special shortages in such areas are also regarded as droughts. Unsatisfactory
distribution of precipitation throughout the year may be as effective a factor in causing a drought
as a shortage in the total amount. Temperature and wind may also play an important part, especially
in relation to the damage done.

during the course of observation is maintained between 2 and 3 in. (5.08 and 7.53 cm) below the rim.
Evaporation, total The sum of water lost from a given land area during any speciﬁc time by
transpiration from vegetation and building of plant tissue; by evaporation from water surfaces,
moist soil, and snow; and by interception. It has been variously termed “evaporation,” “evaporation
from land areas,” “evapotranspiration,” “total loss,” “water losses,” and “ﬂy-off.”

conversion of water to water vapor and loss resulting from both evaporation and transpiration.
Evapotranspiration, potential See Potential evapotranspiration.
Exceptional quality sewage sludge Sewage sludge that meets the most stringent limits for the three
sludge quality parameters. In gaging sewage sludge quality, US EPA determined that three main
parameters of concern should be considered: (1) pollutant levels; (2) the relative presence or
absence of pathogenic organisms, such as salmonella and E. coli bacteria, enteric viruses, or viable
helminth ova; and (3) the degree of attractiveness of the sewage sludge to vectors, such as ﬂies, rats,
and mosquitoes, that could potentially come in contact with pathogenic organisms and spread
disease. Given these three variables, there can be a number of possible sewage sludge qualities.
The term exceptional quality (EQ), which does not appear in the Part 503 regulation, is used to
describe sewage sludge that meets the highest quality for all three of these sewage sludge quality
parameters.
Excessive rainfall See Rainfall, excessive.
Exemption State or US EPA permission for a water system not to meet a certain drinking water
standard. An exemption allows a system additional time to obtain ﬁnancial assistance or make
improvements in order to come into compliance with the standard. The system must prove that
(1) there are compelling reasons (including economic factors) why it cannot meet an MCL or
treatment technique, (2) it was in operation on the effective date of the requirement, and (3) the
exemption will not create an unreasonable risk to public health. The state must set a schedule under
which the water system will comply with the standard for which it received an exemption.

the land is adjacent to and inundated by overﬂow from a river, stream, lake, or ocean.
Flood crest See Flood peak.
Flood event See Flood wave.
Flood peak The highest value of the stage or discharge attained by a ﬂood, thus peak stage or peak

Flood routing The process of determining progressively the timing and shape of a ﬂood wave at
successive points along a river.
Flood stage (1) The elevation at which overﬂow of the natural banks of a stream or body of water
begins in the reach or area in which the elevation is measured; (2) the gage height of the lowest bank
of the reach in which the gage is situated. The term “lowest bank” is, however, not to be taken to
mean an unusually low place or break in the natural bank through which the water inundates an
unimportant and small area. The stage at which overﬂow of the natural banks of a stream begins to
cause damage in the reach in which the elevation is measured. See also Bankfull stage.

during ﬂoods. A part of the ﬂood plain which, to facilitate the passage of ﬂoodwater, is kept clear of
encumbrances. The channel of a river or stream and those parts of the ﬂood plains adjoining the
channel, which are reasonably required to carry and discharge the ﬂoodwater or ﬂood ﬂow of any
river or stream.
Flow-duration curve A cumulative frequency curve that shows the percentage of time that speciﬁed
discharges are equaled or exceeded.

composed of ﬁne particles which, when ﬁrst formed, are colloidal and not seen in the water in which
they are ﬂoating.
Freshwater Water that contains less than 1,000 mg/L of dissolved solids; generally, more than
500 mg/L of dissolved solids is undesirable for drinking and many industrial uses.
Functions of wetland The roles wetlands serve which are of value to society or the environment.
Gage height (1) The water-surface elevation referred to some arbitrary gage datum. Gage height is

and wells. The upper surface of the saturate zone is called the water table; (2) water stored
underground in rock crevices and in the pores of geological materials that make up the Earth’s
crust; (3) the supply of freshwater that is found under the Earth’s surface in underground rock
formations or soil; (4) water in the ground that is in the zone of saturation, from which wells,
springs, and groundwater runoff are supplied; (5) the water that systems pump and treat from
aquifers (natural reservoirs below the Earth’s surface).
Groundwater outﬂow That part of the discharge from a drainage basin that occurs through the
groundwater. The term “underﬂow” is often used to describe the groundwater outﬂow that takes
place in valley alluvium (instead of the surface channel) and thus is not measured at a gaging station.

concentrations, but all of these elements can be toxic to humans, animals, or plants at high
concentrations. Possible hazards associated with a buildup of trace elements in the soil include
their potential to cause phytotoxicity (i.e., injury to plants) or to increase the concentration of
potentially hazardous substances in the food chain. Federal and state regulations have established

typically contain water for weeks or months, while “ephemeral” streams and wetlands contain water
for briefer periods, but in some cases, these terms are used interchangeably (see Ephemeral waters).

health, or the economy.
Irrigated area The gross farm area upon which water is artiﬁcially applied for the production of
crops, with no reduction for access roads, canals, or farm buildings.
Irrigation The controlled application of water to arable lands to supply water requirements not
satisﬁed by rainfall.
Irrigation The controlled application of water for agricultural purposes through man-made systems to
supply water requirements not satisﬁed by rainfall. Here’s a quick look at some types of irrigation
systems.
Irrigation efﬁciency The percentage of water applied that can be accounted for in soil-moisture
increase.
Irrigation requirement The quantity of water, exclusive of precipitation, that is required for crop
production. It includes surface evaporation and other economically unavoidable wastes.

Irrigation water use Water application on lands to assist in the growing of crops and pastures or to
maintain vegetative growth in recreational lands, such as parks and golf courses.
Irrigation, supplemental See Supplemental irrigation.
Isohyet See Isohyetal line.
Isohyetal line (isohyet) A line drawn on a map or chart joining points that receive the same amount of
precipitation.
Lag Variously deﬁned as time from beginning (or center of mass) of rainfall to peak (or center of
mass) of runoff.
Land application Land application is deﬁned as the spreading, spraying, injection, or incorporation
of liquid or semiliquid organic substances, such as sewage sludge, biosolids, livestock manure,
compost, septage, legumes, and other types of liquid organic waste, onto or below the surface of the
land to take advantage of the soil-enhancing qualities of the organic substances. These organic
substances are land applied to improve the structure of the soil. It is also applied as a fertilizer to
supply nutrients to crops and other vegetation grown in the soil. The liquid or semiliquid organic
substances are commonly applied to agricultural land (including pasture and rangeland), forests,
reclamation sites, public contact sites (e.g., parks, turf farms, highway median strips, golf courses),
lawns, and home gardens. (See Spray irrigation for land application of wastewater.)
Land application site An area of land on which sewage sludge is applied to condition the soil or to
fertilize crops or vegetation grown in the soil.
Land treatment unit A site where physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring in the
topsoil layers (e.g., naturally occurring soil microbes and sunlight) are used to treat and contain
waste. Hazardous waste is applied directly to the soil surface or incorporated into the upper layers of
the soil, where its constituents are degraded, transformed, or immobilized. Liner systems or leachate
collection and removal systems are not required for land treatment units. Closure consists primarily
of placing a vegetative cover over the unit and certifying that hazardous constituent levels in the
treatment zone do not exceed background levels.
Landﬁll A disposal site for solid wastes spread in layers, compacted to the smallest practical volume
and covered by material (e.g., soil). Landﬁlls are designed to isolate waste from the surrounding
environment (e.g., groundwater, rain, air). Landﬁlls are subject to requirements that include
installing and maintaining a ﬁnal cover, operating leachate collection and removal systems,
maintaining and monitoring the leak detection system, groundwater monitoring, preventing storm
water run-on and runoff, and installing and protecting surveyed benchmarks.
Leaching The process by which soluble materials in the soil, such as salts, nutrients, pesticide
chemicals, or contaminants, are washed into a lower layer of soil or are dissolved and carried
away by water.
Lentic waters Ponds or lakes (standing water).
Levee A natural or man-made earthen barrier along the edge of a stream, lake, or river. Land
alongside rivers can be protected from ﬂooding by levees.

bacteria are present in livestock waste.
Livestock water use Water used for livestock watering, feedlots, dairy operations, ﬁsh farming, and
other on-farm needs.
Living machine system A patented, man-made aquaculture wetland waste treatment system which
adapts and enhances the ecological processes in a series of tidal wetland cells or basins. Each cell or
basin is ﬁlled with special gravel that promotes the development of micro-ecosystems. A computer

climatic when the period of change runs through centuries or a few millennia, and geological when
the period runs into geological time.
Lotic waters Flowing waters, as in streams and rivers.
Low-ﬂow frequency curve A graph showing the magnitude and frequency of minimum ﬂows for a
period of given length. Frequency is usually expressed as the average interval, in years, between
recurrences of an annual minimum ﬂow equal to or less than that shown by the magnitude scale.
Lysimeter Structure containing a mass of soil and designed to permit the measurement of water
draining through the soil.
Macroinvertebrate Organism that lacks a backbone and is large enough to be seen with the
naked eye.

Mass curve A graph of the cumulative values of a hydrologic quantity (such as precipitation or
runoff), generally as ordinate, plotted against time or date as abscissa. (See Double-mass curve and
Residual-mass curve.)
Maximum contaminant level (MCL) The highest level of a contaminant that the US EPA allows in
drinking water. MCLs ensure that drinking water does not pose either a short-term or long-term
health risk. The US EPA sets MCLs at levels that are economically and technologically feasible.
MCLs are enforceable standards. Some states set MCLs which are more strict than the US EPA’s.
Maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) The level of a contaminant at which there would be no
risk to human health. This goal is not always economically or technologically feasible, and the goal
is not legally enforceable.
Maximum probable ﬂood See Flood, maximum probable.

deﬁned in 40 CFR Subsection 261.4(b)(1).
Meromictic lake A lake in which some water remains partly or wholly unmixed with the main water
mass at circulation periods is said to be meromictic. The process leading to a meromictic state is
termed meromixis. The perennially stagnant deep layer of a meromictic lake is called the
monimolimnion. The part of a meromictic lake in which free circulation can occur is called the

mixolimnion. The boundary between the monimolimnion and the mixolimnion is called the
chemocline.
Mesotrophic The term describes reservoirs and lakes that contain moderate quantities of nutrients and
are moderately productive in terms of aquatic animal and plant life.
Metal mining sector Metal mining facilities that fall within Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation Code
10 and must report to the Toxics Release Inventory in accordance with Section 313 of the
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.
Microorganisms Tiny living organisms that can be seen only with the aid of a microscope. Some
microorganisms can cause acute health problems when consumed in drinking water. Also known as
microbes.
Mineralization Most nitrogen exists in biosolids/manure as organic-N, principally contained in
proteins, nucleic acids, amines, and other cellular material. These complex molecules must be
broken apart through biological degradation for nitrogen to become available to crops. The
conversion of organic-N to inorganic-N forms is called mineralization.
Mining water use Water use during quarrying rocks and extracting minerals from the land.
Mobile source A term used to describe a wide variety of vehicles, engines, and equipment that
generate air pollution and that move, or can be moved, from place to place. “On-road” sources are
vehicles used on roads to transport passengers or freight. “Nonroad” sources include vehicles,
engines, and equipment used for construction, agriculture, transportation, recreation, and many
other purposes.
Moisture Water diffused in the atmosphere or the ground.
Moisture equivalent The ratio of (1) the weight of water which the soil, after saturation, will retain
against a centrifugal force 1,000 times the force of gravity to (2) the weight of the soil when dry. The
ratio is stated as a percentage.
Monitoring Testing that water systems must perform to detect and measure contaminants. A water
system that does not follow the US EPA’s monitoring methodology or schedule is in violation and
may be subject to legal action.
Mudﬂow A well-mixed mass of water and alluvium which, because of its high viscosity and low
ﬂuidity as compared with water, moves at a much slower rate, usually piling up and spreading over
the fan like a sheet of wet mortar or concrete.
Municipal solid waste Waste from homes, institutions, and commercial sources consisting of every-
day items such as product packaging, grass clippings, furniture, clothing, bottles and cans, food
scraps, newspapers, appliances, consumer electronics, and batteries. (Excluded from this category
are municipal wastewater-treatment sludge, industrial process wastes, automobile bodies, combus-
tion ash, and construction and demolition debris.)
Municipal water system A water system that has at least ﬁve service connections or which regularly
serves 25 individuals for 60 days, also called a public water system.
Narrative criteria Nonnumeric descriptions of desirable or undesirable water quality conditions.
National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) Standards established by the US EPA that apply
to outdoor air throughout the country. The Clean Air Act established two types of national air
quality standards. Primary standards set limits to protect public health, including the health of
“sensitive” populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standards set limits
to protect public welfare, including protection against decreased visibility and damage to animals,
crops, vegetation, and buildings. The US EPA has set NAAQS for the six criteria pollutants.

ment issued by either a federal or state agency that is designed to control all discharges of pollutants
from point sources into US waterways. The NPDES permits regulate discharges into navigable
waters from all point sources of pollution, including industries, municipal water and wastewater-
treatment plants, power plants, sanitary landﬁlls, large agricultural feedlots, and return irrigation
ﬂows.

information from states about the quality of the nation’s waters.
Natural source A term used in this report to describe any air emission source of natural origin.
Examples include volcanoes, wild ﬁres, windblown dust, and releases due to biological processes
(see Biogenic source).
Nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) Unit of measure for the turbidity of water. Essentially, a
measure of the cloudiness of water as measured by a nephelometer. Turbidity is based on the
amount of light that is reﬂected off particles in the water.
NGVD National Geodetic Vertical Datum. (1) As corrected in 1929, a vertical control measure used
as a reference for establishing varying elevations. (2) Elevation datum plane previously used by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the determination of ﬂood elevations. FEMA
currently uses the North American Vertical Datum Plane.
NGVD of 1929 National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929. A geodetic datum derived from a general
adjustment of the ﬁrst-order level nets of the United States and Canada. It was formerly called “Sea
Level Datum of 1929” or “mean sea level” in the USGS series of reports. Although the datum was
derived from the average sea level over a period of many years at 26 tide stations along the Atlantic,
Gulf of Mexico, and Paciﬁc Coasts, it does not necessarily represent local mean sea level at any
particular place.
Nitrogen Nutrient that is essential to plants and animals.
Nonindigenous species A species that has been introduced by human action, either intentionally or by
accident, into an area outside its natural geographic range, also called an alien, exotic, introduced, or
nonnative species. Certain nonindigenous species are considered “invasive.” (See Invasive species.)
Nonpoint source Diffuse pollution source; a source without a single point of origin or not introduced
into a receiving stream from a speciﬁc outlet. The pollutants are generally carried off the land by
rainfall or snowmelt moving over and through the ground and carrying natural and human-made
contaminants into lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands, estuaries, other coastal waters, and groundwater.
Common nonpoint sources are agriculture, forestry, urban areas, mining, construction, dams,
channels, land disposal, saltwater intrusion, and city streets.
Nonpoint-source (NPS) pollution Pollution discharged over a wide land area, not from one speciﬁc
location. These are forms of diffuse pollution caused by sediments, nutrients, and organic and toxic
substances originating from land-use activities, which are carried to lakes and streams by surface
runoff. Nonpoint-source pollution is contamination that occurs when rainwater, snowmelt, or
irrigation washes off plowed ﬁelds, city streets, or suburban backyards. As this runoff moves across
the land surface, it picks up soil particles and pollutants, such as nutrients and pesticides.
832
M.-H.S. Wang and L.K. Wang

Nonproduction-related waste Waste that is not production related, for example, waste associated
with catastrophic events and cleanup actions. Toxic chemicals in nonproduction-related waste must
be reported to the Toxics Release Inventory (see Toxics Release Inventory).
Nonpublic water system A water system that does not provide water for human consumption through
at least 15 service connections, or regularly serve at least 25 individuals, for at least 60 days
per year.
Non-transient noncommunity water system A type of public water system that supplies water to
25 or more of the same people at least 6 months per year in places other than their residences. Some
examples are schools, factories, ofﬁce buildings, and hospitals that have their own water systems.
(See Public water system.)
Normal A central value (such as arithmetic average or median) of annual quantities for a 30-year
period ending with an even 10-year, thus 1921–1950, 1931–1960, and so forth. This deﬁnition
accords with that recommended by the Subcommittee on Hydrology of the Federal Interagency
Committee on Water Resources.

molybdenum (Mo), and zinc (Zn). (2) Any substance assimilated by living things that promotes
growth. (3) Substances necessary for the growth of all living things, such as nitrogen, carbon,
potassium, and phosphorus. Too many nutrients in waterbodies can contribute to algal blooms. The
term is generally applied to nitrogen and phosphorus but is also applied to other essential and trace
elements.
Oil and gas production waste Gas and oil drilling mud, oil production brines, and other wastes
associated with exploration for, or development and production of, crude oil or natural gas.

water through runoff from cropland or discharge from factories. The US EPA has set legal limits on
56 organic contaminants.
Organic matter Plant and animal residues or substances made by living organisms. All are based
upon carbon compounds.
Osmosis The movement of water molecules through a thin membrane. The osmosis process occurs in
our bodies and is also one method of desalinating saline water.
Outfall The place where a sewer, drain, or stream discharges; the outlet or structure through which
reclaimed water or treated efﬂuent is ﬁnally discharged to a receiving waterbody.
Overland ﬂow The ﬂow of rainwater or snowmelt over the land surface toward stream channels. After
it enters a stream, it becomes runoff.
Oxygen demand The need for molecular oxygen to meet the needs of biological and chemical
processes in water. Even though very little oxygen will dissolve in water, it is extremely important
in biological and chemical processes.
Ozone depletion Destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer, which shields the Earth from ultraviolet
radiation harmful to life. This destruction of ozone is caused by the breakdown of certain chlorine-
and/or bromine-containing compounds (chloroﬂuorocarbons or halons). These compounds break
down when they reach the stratosphere and then catalytically destroy ozone molecules.
Glossary and Conversion factors
833

Ozone-depleting substance Any compound that contributes to stratospheric ozone depletion (see
Ozone depletion).

classiﬁcations are (1) clay ¼ 0.00024–0.004 mm, (2) silt ¼ 0.004–0.062 mm, (3) sand ¼ 0.062–2.0
mm, and (4) gravel ¼ 2.0–64.0 mm.
Particulates Small pieces of material (such as sand) ﬂoating in the water.
Pasture Land on which animals feed directly on feed crops such as legumes, grasses, or grain stubble.
Pathogen (1) A disease-causing organism or (2) a disease-producing agent, usually applied to a living
organism. Generally, any viruses, bacteria, or fungi that cause disease.
Peak ﬂow The maximum instantaneous discharge of a stream or river at a given location. It usually
occurs at or near the time of maximum stage.
Per capita use The average amount of water used per person during a standard time period, generally
per day.
Percolation (1) The movement of water through the openings in rock or soil; (2) the entrance of a
portion of the streamﬂow into the channel materials to contribute to groundwater replenishment;
(3) the movement, under hydrostatic pressure, of water through the interstices of a rock or soil,
except the movement through large openings such as caves.
Percolation, deep In irrigation or farming practice, the amount of water that passes below the root
zone of the crop or vegetation.
Permeability The ability of a material to allow the passage of a liquid, such as water through rocks.
Permeable materials, such as gravel and sand, allow water to move quickly through them, whereas
unpermeable material, such as clay, don’t allow water to ﬂow freely.
Pervious surface A surface which allows water to soak into it.
pH (1) A measure of the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a substance. (2) A symbol for expressing the
degree to which a solution is acidic or basic. It is based on a scale from 0 (very acid) to 14 (very
basic). Water with a pH of 7 is neutral; lower pH levels indicate increasing acidity, while pH levels
higher than 7 indicate increasingly basic solutions. The pH of biosolids is often raised with alkaline
materials to reduce pathogen content and attraction of disease-spreading organisms (vectors). High
pH (greater than 11) kills virtually all pathogens and reduces the solubility, biological availability,
and mobility of most metals. Lime also increases the gaseous loss (volatilization) of the ammonia
form of nitrogen (ammonia-N), thus reducing the N-fertilizer value of biosolids.
Phosphorus A nutrient that is essential to plants and animals.
Photosynthesis The conversion of light energy to chemical energy. At night, this process reverses:
plants and algae suck oxygen out of the water.
Plant available nitrogen (PAN) Only a portion of the total nitrogen present in biosolids/manure is
available for plant uptake. This plant available nitrogen (PAN) is the actual amount of N in the
biosolids/manure that is available to crops during a speciﬁed period.
Planting and harvesting periods The cycle of crop planting and harvesting periods, not the calendar
year, dictates the timing of biosolids and manure land application activities. Winter wheat and
perennial forage grasses are examples of crops that may be established and harvested in different
calendar years.
834
M.-H.S. Wang and L.K. Wang

Planting season The basic time management unit is often called the crop year or planting season. The
crop year is deﬁned as the year in which a crop receiving the biosolids/manure treatment is
harvested.
Point source A stationary location or ﬁxed facility from which pollutants are discharged; any single
identiﬁable source of pollution, such as a pipe, ditch, ship, ore pit, or factory smokestack.
Point-source pollution Water pollution coming from a single point, such as a sewage-outﬂow pipe.
Pollutant (1) A contaminant in a concentration or amount that adversely alters the physical, chemical,
or biological properties of the natural environment. (2) Any substance introduced into the environ-
ment that may adversely affect the usefulness of a resource or the health of humans, animals, or
ecosystems. For most environmental media, this term is commonly understood to refer to substances
introduced by human activities. In the case of air, the convention is to include substances emitted
from natural sources as well (see Air pollutant).
Pollutant concentration limits (PCL) Pollutant concentration limits are the maximum concentra-
tions of heavy metals for biosolids whose trace element pollutant additions do not require tracking
(i.e., calculation of CPLR (cumulative pollutant loading rate)). PCL are the most stringent pollutant
limits included in US Federal Regulation Part 503 for land application. Biosolids meeting pollutant
concentration limits are subject to fewer requirements than biosolids meeting ceiling concentration
limits.
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) A group of synthetic, toxic industrial chemical compounds once
used in making paint and electrical transformers, which are chemically inert and not biodegradable.
PCBs were frequently found in industrial wastes, and subsequently found their way into surface and
groundwaters. As a result of their persistence, they tend to accumulate in the environment. In terms
of streams and rivers, PCBs are drawn to sediment, to which they attach and can remain virtually
indeﬁnitely. Although virtually banned in 1979 with the passage of the Toxic Substances Control
Act, they continue to appear in the ﬂesh of ﬁsh and other animals.
Pondage Small-scale storage at a waterpower plant to equalize daily or weekly ﬂuctuations in
riverﬂow or to permit irregular hourly use of the water for power generation to accord with
ﬂuctuations in load.
Pool (1) A deep reach of a stream. (2) In streams, a relatively deep area with low velocity; in
ecological systems, the supply of an element or compound, such as exchangeable or weatherable
cations or adsorbed sulfate, in a deﬁned component of the ecosystem. The reach of a stream between
two rifﬂes. Natural streams often consist of a succession of pools and rifﬂes.
Pool-rifﬂe ratio The ratio of stream surface area covering pools to stream surface area covering rifﬂes
in a given segment of stream.
Population In ecology, a group of interbreeding organisms occupying a particular space. In other
contexts, including human health, this term generally refers to the number of humans living in a
designated area.
Porosity A measure of the water-bearing capacity of subsurface rock. With respect to water move-
ment, it is not just the total magnitude of porosity that is important, but the size of the voids and the
extent to which they are interconnected, as the pores in a formation may be open, or interconnected,
or closed and isolated. For example, clay may have a very high porosity with respect to potential
water content, but it constitutes a poor medium as an aquifer because the pores are usually so small.
Potable water Water of a quality suitable for drinking.
Potential evapotranspiration Water loss that will occur if at no time there is a deﬁciency of water in
the soil for use of vegetation.
Glossary and Conversion factors
835

Potential natural water loss The water loss during years when the annual precipitation greatly
exceeds the average water loss. It represents the approximate upper limit to water loss under the
type and density of vegetation native to a basin, actual conditions of moisture supply, and other
basin characteristics, whereas potential evapotranspiration represents the hypothetical condition of
no deﬁciency of water in the soil at any time for use of the type and density of vegetation that would
develop.
Potential rate of evaporation See Evaporativity.
Precipitation (1) Precipitation includes rain, snow, hail, sleet, dew, and frost. (2) As used in
hydrology, precipitation is the discharge of water, in liquid or solid state, out of the atmosphere,
generally upon a land or water surface. It is the common process by which atmospheric water
becomes surface or subsurface water. The term “precipitation” is also commonly used to designate
the quantity of water that is precipitated. Precipitation includes rainfall, snow, hail, and sleet and is
therefore a more general term than rainfall.
Precursor In photochemistry, any compound antecedent to a pollutant. For example, volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides react in sunlight to form ozone or other photochemical
oxidants. As such, VOCs and nitrogen oxides are precursors.
Preparer Either the person who generates sewage sludge during the treatment of domestic sewage in
a treatment work or the person who derives a material from sewage sludge.
Primacy state A state that has the responsibility and authority to administer the US EPA’s drinking
water regulations within its borders. The state must have rules at least as stringent as the US EPA’s.
Primary pollutant Any pollutant that is emitted into the atmosphere directly from its source and that
retains the same chemical form. An example of a primary pollutant is dust that blows into the air
from a landﬁll.
Primary wastewater treatment The ﬁrst stage of the wastewater-treatment process where mechan-
ical methods, such as ﬁlters and scrapers, are used to remove pollutants. Solid material in sewage
also settles out in this process.
Prior appropriation doctrine The system for allocating water to private individuals used in most
Western states. The doctrine of prior appropriation was in common use throughout the arid West as
early settlers and miners began to develop the land. The prior appropriation doctrine is based on the
concept of “First in Time, First in Right.” The ﬁrst person to take a quantity of water and put it to
beneﬁcial use has a higher priority of right than a subsequent user. The rights can be lost through
nonuse; they can also be sold or transferred apart from the land. Contrasts with riparian water rights.
Priority chemicals A set of chemicals, found in the nation’s products and wastes, that US EPA targets
for voluntary reduction (or recovery and recycling if they cannot be eliminated or reduced at the
source).
Production-related waste The sum of a facility’s production-related on-site waste releases, on-site
waste management (recycling, treatment, and combustion for energy recovery), and off-site trans-
fers for disposal, treatment, recycling, or energy recovery. Toxic chemicals in production-related
waste must be reported to the Toxics Release Inventory (see Toxics Release Inventory).
Public contact site Land with a high potential for contact by the public, including public parks, ball
ﬁelds, cemeteries, nurseries, turf farms, and golf courses.
Public notiﬁcation An advisory that the US EPA requires a water system to distribute to affected
consumers when the system has violated MCLs or other regulations. The notice advises consumers
what precautions, if any, they should take to protect their health.
Public supply Water withdrawn by public governments and agencies, such as a county water
department, and by private companies that is then delivered to users. Public suppliers provide
836

water for domestic, commercial, thermoelectric power, industrial, and public water users. Most
people’s household water is delivered by a public water supplier. The systems have at least
15 service connections (such as households, businesses, or schools) or regularly serve at least
25 individuals daily for at least 60 days out of the year.
Public water system (PWS) A system that provides water for human consumption through at least
15 service connections, or regularly serves at least 25 individuals, for at least 60 days per year.
Public water systems are divided into three categories (see Community water system, Non-transient
noncommunity water system, and Transient noncommunity water system). Examples of public
water systems include municipal water companies, homeowner associations, schools, businesses,
campgrounds, and shopping malls. There are more than 170,000 PWSs providing water from wells,
rivers and other sources to about 250 million Americans.
Public water use Water supplied from a public water supply and used for such purposes as
ﬁreﬁghting, street washing, and municipal parks and swimming pools.
Radioactive waste Waste containing substances that emit ionizing radiation. Radioactive waste is
classiﬁed by regulation according to its source and/or content. The types of waste that are typically
considered “radioactive waste” include high-level waste, low-level waste, mixed low-level waste,
transuranic waste (i.e., elements heavier than uranium), and certain wastes from the extraction and
processing of uranium or thorium ore. Spent nuclear fuel, which is produced as a result of the
controlled nuclear ﬁssion process in nuclear reactors, is considered a nuclear material rather than
radioactive waste.
Radionuclides Any man-made or natural element that emits radiation and that may cause cancer after
many years of exposure through drinking water.
Rain Liquid precipitation.
Rainfall The quantity of water that falls as rain only. Not synonymous with precipitation.
Rainfall excess The volume of rainfall available for direct runoff. It is equal to the total rainfall minus
interception, depression storage, and absorption.
Rainfall, excessive Rainfall in which the rate of fall is greater than certain adopted limits, chosen with
regard to the normal precipitation (excluding snow) of a given place or area. In the US Weather
Bureau, it is deﬁned, for states along the southern Atlantic coast and the Gulf coast, as rainfall in
which the depth of precipitation is 0.90 in. at the end of 30 min and 1.50 in. at the end of an hour and,
for the rest of the country, as rainfall in which the depth of precipitation at the end of each of the
same periods is 0.50 in. and 0.80 in., respectively.
Rangeland Open land with indigenous vegetation.
Rating curve A drawn curve showing the relation between gage height and discharge of a stream at a
given gaging station.
Raw water Water in its natural state, prior to any treatment for drinking.
RCRA cleanup baseline A priority subset of the universe of facilities that are subject to cleanup
under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) due to past or current treatment,
storage, or disposal of hazardous wastes and that have historical releases of contamination.
RCRA hazardous waste A national regulatory designation for certain wastes under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Some wastes are given this designation because they are
speciﬁcally listed on one of four RCRA hazardous waste lists (see http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/
osw/hazwaste.htm). Other wastes receive this designation because they exhibit at least one of four
characteristics which are ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity.

Reaeration The rate at which oxygen is absorbed back into water. This is dependent, among other
things, upon turbulence intensity and the water depth.
Receiving waters A river, lake, ocean, stream, or other bodies of water into which wastewater or
treated efﬂuent is discharged.
Recession curve A hydrograph showing the decreasing rate of runoff following a period of rain or
snowmelt. Since direct runoff and base runoff recede at different rates, separate curves, called direct
runoff recession curves or base runoff recession curves, are generally drawn. The term “depletion
curve” in the sense of base runoff recession is not recommended.

hydrologic system.
Regime “Regime theory” is a theory of the forming of channels in material carried by the streams. As
used in this sense, the word “regime” applies only to streams that make at least part of their
boundaries from their transported load and part of their transported load from their boundaries,
carrying out the process at different places and times in any one stream in a balanced or alternating
manner that prevents unlimited growth or removal of boundaries. A stream, river, or canal of this
type is called a “regime stream, river, or canal.” A regime channel is said to be “in regime” when it
has achieved average equilibrium; that is, the average values of the quantities that constitute regime
do not show a deﬁnite trend over a considerable period—generally of the order of a decade. In
unspecialized use “regime” and “regimen” are synonyms. Regimen of a stream. The system or order
characteristic of a stream; in other words, its habits with respect to velocity and volume, form of and
changes in channel, capacity to transport sediment, and amount of material supplied for transpor-
tation. The term is also applied to a stream which has reached an equilibrium between corrosion and
deposition or, in other words, to a graded stream.
Regional indicator An ROE indicator that helps to answer an ROE question on a smaller-than-
national geographic scale. A regional indicator may cover a topic for which nationally consistent
data are unavailable, or it may present an issue that is of particular concern within a certain
geographic area. (See ROE indicator.)
Regulation The artiﬁcial manipulation of the ﬂow of a stream.
Remedial action The actual construction or cleanup phase of a site cleanup.
Remote sensing (1) The analysis and interpretation of images gathered through techniques that do not

Restoration An activity returning a wetland from a disturbed or altered condition with lesser acreage
or functions to a previous condition with greater wetland acreage or functions. For example,
restoration might involve the plugging of a drainage ditch to restore the hydrology to an area that
was a wetland before the installation of the drainage ditch.
Retarding reservoir Ungated reservoir for temporary storage of ﬂoodwater. Sometimes called
detention reservoir.
Return ﬂow (1) That part of a diverted ﬂow that is not consumptively used and returned to its original
source or another body of water. (2) (Irrigation) Drainage water from irrigated farmlands that
reenters the water system to be used further downstream.
Return ﬂow (irrigation) (1) Irrigation water that is applied to an area and which is not consumed in
evaporation or transpiration and returns to a surface stream or aquifer; (2) that part of irrigation
water that is not consumed by evapotranspiration and that returns to its source or another body of
water. The term is also applied to the water that is discharged from industrial plants. Also called
return water.
Reverse osmosis (1) (Desalination) The process of removing salts from water using a membrane.
With reverse osmosis, the product water passes through a ﬁne membrane that the salts are unable to
pass through, while the salt waste (brine) is removed and disposed. This process differs from
electrodialysis, where the salts are extracted from the feedwater by using a membrane with an
electrical current to separate the ions. The positive ions go through one membrane, while the
negative ions ﬂow through a different membrane, leaving the end product of freshwater.
(2) (Water quality) An advanced method of water or wastewater treatment that relies on a
semipermeable membrane to separate waters from pollutants. An external force is used to reverse
the normal osmotic process resulting in the solvent moving from a solution of higher concentration
to one of lower concentration.
Rifﬂe (1) A rapid in a stream; (2) a shallow section in a stream where water is breaking over rocks or
other partially submerged organic debris and producing surface agitation.

stream. These may include areas adjacent to rivers, lakes, or estuaries. These areas often include
wetlands.
Riparian water rights The rights of an owner whose land abuts water. They differ from state to state
and often depend on whether the water is a river, lake, or ocean. The doctrine of riparian rights is an
old one, having its origins in English common law. Speciﬁcally, persons who own land adjacent to a
stream have the right to make reasonable use of the stream. Riparian users of a stream share the
Glossary and Conversion factors
839

streamﬂow among themselves, and the concept of priority of use (prior appropriation doctrine) is
not applicable. Riparian rights cannot be sold or transferred for use on non-riparian land.
Risk A measure of the chance that damage to life, health, property, or the environment will occur.
Risk assessment A methodology used to examine all possible risks involved with a particular product
or organism. Risk assessment can be divided into four parts: identiﬁcation of hazards, dose response
(how much exposure causes particular problems such as cancer, convulsions, and death), exposure
assessment (determining how much exposure will be received by people during particular activi-
ties), and risk characterization (determining a probability that a risk will occur).
Risk factor A characteristic (e.g., race, sex, age, obesity) or variable (e.g., smoking, occupational
exposure level) associated with increased probability of an adverse effect.
River A natural stream of water of considerable volume, larger than a brook or creek.
River morphology Study of the evolution and conﬁguration of river.
ROE See Report on the Environment.

Runoff That part of the precipitation, such as snowmelt, or irrigation water that appears in
uncontrolled surface streams, drains, or sewers. It is the same as streamﬂow unaffected by artiﬁcial
diversions, storage, or other works of man in or on the stream channels. Runoff may be classiﬁed as
follows: (1) classiﬁcation as to speed of appearance after rainfall or snowmelting, direct runoff or
base runoff, and (2) classiﬁcation as to source, surface runoff (see Overland ﬂow), storm seepage
(storm inter), or groundwater runoff (see Stream, gaining). It can collect pollutants from air or land
and carry them to streams and other waterbodies. Also deﬁned as the depth to which a drainage area
would be covered if all of the runoff for a given period of time were uniformly distributed over it.

Demand (BOD) and suspended matter. Secondary wastewater treatment may be accomplished by
840
M.-H.S. Wang and L.K. Wang

biological or chemical-physical methods. Activated sludge and trickling ﬁlters are two of the most
common means of secondary treatment. It is accomplished by bringing together waste, bacteria, and
oxygen in trickling ﬁlters or in the activated sludge process. This treatment removes ﬂoating and
settleable solids and about 90 % of the oxygen-demanding substances and suspended solids.
Disinfection is the ﬁnal stage of secondary treatment.

from a canal, ditches, laterals, watercourse, reservoir, storage facilities, or other bodies of water or
from a ﬁeld.
Seiche The free oscillation of the bulk of water in a lake and the motion caused by it on the surface of
the lake.
Self-supplied water Water withdrawn from a surface- or groundwater source by a user rather than
being obtained from a public supply. An example would be homeowners getting their water from
their own well.

domestic sewage treatment system or holding tank when the system is cleaned or maintained.
Septic system A system that treats and disposes of household wastewater under the ground.
Septic tank A tank used to detain domestic wastes to allow the settling of solids prior to distribution to
a leach ﬁeld for soil absorption. Septic tanks are used when a sewer line is not available to carry
them to a treatment plant. A settling tank in which settled sludge is in immediate contact with
sewage ﬂowing through the tank, and wherein solids are decomposed by anaerobic bacterial action.
Settling pond (water quality) An open lagoon into which wastewater contaminated with solid
pollutants is placed and allowed to stand. The solid pollutants suspended in the water sink to the
bottom of the lagoon and the liquid is allowed to overﬂow out of the enclosure.
Sewage sludge The solid, semisolid, or liquid residue generated during the treatment of domestic
sewage in a treatment works. Sewage sludge includes, but is not limited to, domestic septage, scum,
and solids removed during primary, secondary, or advanced wastewater-treatment processes. The
deﬁnition of sewage sludge also includes a material derived from sewage sludge (i.e., sewage sludge
whose quality is changed either through further treatment or through mixing with other materials).
Sewage sludge A semisolid residue from any of a number of air- or water-treatment processes. When
treated and processed, sewage sludge becomes a nutrient-rich organic material called biosolids.
Glossary and Conversion factors
841

Sewage treatment plant A facility designed to receive the wastewater from domestic sources and to
remove materials that damage water quality and threaten public health and safety when discharged
into receiving streams or bodies of water. The substances removed are classiﬁed into four basic
areas: (1) greases and fats, (2) solids from human waste and other sources, (3) dissolved pollutants
from human waste and decomposition products, and (4) dangerous microorganisms. Most facilities
employ a combination of mechanical removal steps and bacterial decomposition to achieve the
desired results. Chlorine is often added to discharges from the plants to reduce the danger of
spreading disease by the release of pathogenic bacteria.
Sewer A system of underground pipes that collect and deliver wastewater to treatment facilities or
streams.

substances than any other and is known as the “universal solvent.”
Source water Water in its natural state, prior to any treatment for drinking.
Speciﬁc conductance A measure of the ability of water to conduct an electrical current as measured
using a 1 cm cell and expressed in units of electrical conductance, i.e., Siemens per centimeter at 25 C.
842
M.-H.S. Wang and L.K. Wang

Speciﬁc conductance can be used for approximating the total dissolved solids content of water by
testing its capacity to carry an electrical current. In water quality, speciﬁc conductance is used in
groundwater monitoring as an indication of the presence of ions of chemical substances that may
have been released by a leaking landﬁll or other waste storage or disposal facility. A higher speciﬁc
conductance in water drawn from downgradient wells when compared to upgradient wells indicates
possible contamination from the facility.
Spray irrigation (1) A method of land application by which wastewater is sprayed from nozzles onto
land. (2) A common irrigation method where water is shot from high-pressure sprayers onto crops.
Because water is shot high into the air onto crops, some water is lost to evaporation.
Spring A waterbody formed when the side of a hill, a valley bottom, or another excavation intersects a
ﬂowing body of groundwater at or below the local water table, below which the subsurface material
is saturated with water.

qualiﬁed, may include any or all meteorologic disturbances, such as wind, rain, snow, hail, or
thunder.
Storm seepage That part of precipitation which inﬁltrates the surface soil and moves toward the
streams as ephemeral, shallow, perched groundwater above the main groundwater level. Storm
seepage is usually part of the direct runoff.
Storm sewer A sewer that carries only surface runoff, street wash, and snowmelt from the land. In a
separate sewer system, storm sewers are completely separate from those that carry domestic and
commercial wastewater (sanitary sewers).

Stormﬂow See Direct runoff.
Stratosphere The layer of the atmosphere that starts about 6–9 miles above the Earth’s surface at
midlatitudes and lies atop the troposphere. The stratosphere contains small amounts of gaseous
ozone, which ﬁlters out about 99 % of the incoming ultraviolet radiation.
Stream A general term for a body of ﬂowing water and natural water course containing water at least
part of the year. In hydrology the term is generally applied to the water ﬂowing in a natural channel
as distinct from a canal. More generally as in the term stream gaging, it is applied to the water
ﬂowing in any channel, natural or artiﬁcial. Streams in natural channels may be classiﬁed as follows
in relation to time: (1) perennial stream, one which ﬂows continuously; (2) intermittent or seasonal
stream, one which ﬂows only at certain times of the year when it receives water from springs or from
some surface source such as melting snow in mountainous areas; and (3) ephemeral stream, one that
ﬂows only in direct response to precipitation and whose channel is at all times above the water table.
Streams in natural channels may be classiﬁed as follows in relation to space: (1) continuous stream,
one that does not have interruptions in space and (2) interrupted stream, one which contains
alternating reaches that are either perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral. Streams in natural channels
may also be classiﬁed as follows in relation to groundwater: (1) gaining stream, a stream or reach of
a stream that receives water from the zone of saturation; (2) losing stream, a stream or reach of a
stream that contributes water to the zone of saturation; (3) insulated stream, a stream or reach of a
stream that neither contributes water to the zone of saturation nor receives water from it—it is
separated from the zones of saturation by an impermeable bed; and (4) perched stream, a perched
stream is either a losing stream or an insulated stream that is separated from the underlying
groundwater by a zone of aeration.
Stream gaging The process and art of measuring the depths, areas, velocities, and rates of ﬂow in
natural or artiﬁcial channels.
Stream meander The length of a stream channel from an upstream point to a downstream point
divided by the straight line distance between the same two points.
Stream order A method of numbering streams as part of a drainage basin network. The smallest
unbranched mapped tributary is called ﬁrst order, the stream receiving the tributary is called second
order, and so on. It is usually necessary to specify the scale of the map used. A ﬁrst-order stream on a
1:62,500 map may be a third-order stream on a 1:12,000 map. Tributaries which have no branches
are designated as the ﬁrst order, streams which receive only ﬁrst-order tributaries are of the second
order, larger branches which receive only ﬁrst-order and second-order tributaries are designated
third order, and so on, the main stream being always of the highest order.
Streamﬂow (1) The water discharge that occurs in a natural channel. (2) A more general term than
runoff, streamﬂow may be applied to discharge whether or not it is affected by diversion or
regulation. The discharge that occurs in a natural channel. Although the term discharge can be
applied to the ﬂow of a canal, the word streamﬂow uniquely describes the discharge in a surface
stream course.
Streamﬂow depletion The amount of water that ﬂows into a valley or onto a particular land area
minus the water that ﬂows out the valley or off from the particular land area.
Stream-gaging station A gaging station where a record of discharge of a stream is obtained. Within
the Geological Survey, this term is used only for those gaging stations where a continuous record of
discharge is obtained.

ﬁssures can appear in the land. Subsidence is virtually an irreversible process.
Subsurface runoff See Storm seepage.
Superfund A program, operated under the legislative authority of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act, that funds and carries out the US EPA solid waste emergency and long-term removal and
remedial activities. These activities include establishing the National Priorities List, investigating
sites for inclusion on the list, determining their priority, and conducting and/or supervising cleanup
and other remedial actions. (See National Priorities List.)
Supplemental irrigation Commonly, irrigation as carried on in humid areas. The term means that the
irrigation water is supplementary to the natural rainfall rather than being the primary source of
moisture as in the arid and semiarid West. Supplementary irrigation is used generally to prevent
retardation of growth during periods of drought.
Supplemental sources When irrigation water supplies are obtained from more than one source, the
source furnishing the principal supply is commonly designated the primary source, and the sources
furnishing the additional supplies, the supplemental sources.
Surface runoff That part of the runoff which travels over the soil surface to the nearest stream
channel. It is also deﬁned as that part of the runoff of a drainage basin that has not passed beneath the
surface since precipitation. The terms groundwater runoff and surface runoff are classiﬁcations
according to source. The terms base runoff and direct runoff are time classiﬁcations of runoff.
Surface tension The attraction of molecules to each other on a liquid’s surface. Thus, a barrier is
created between the air and the liquid.
Surface water (1) Water on the surface of the Earth such as in a stream, river, lake, or reservoir.
(2) The water that systems pump and treat from sources open to the atmosphere, such as rivers,

Suspended sediment Very ﬁne soil particles that remain in suspension in water for a considerable
period of time without contact with the bottom. Such material remains in suspension due to the
upward components of turbulence and currents and/or by suspension.
Suspended solids Solids that are not in true solution and that can be removed by ﬁltration. Such
suspended solids usually contribute directly to turbidity. Deﬁned in waste management, these are
small particles of solid pollutants that resist separation by conventional methods.
Suspended-sediment concentration The ratio of the mass of dry sediment in a water-sediment
mixture to the mass of the water-sediment mixture. Typically expressed in milligrams of dry
sediment per liter of water-sediment mixture.
Suspended-sediment discharge The quantity of suspended sediment passing a point in a stream over
a speciﬁed period of time. When expressed in tons per day, it is computed by multiplying water
discharge (in cubic feet per second) by the suspended-sediment concentration (in milligrams per
liter) and by the factor 0.0027.
Terrace A berm or discontinuous segments of a berm, in a valley at some height above the ﬂood plain,
representing a former abandoned ﬂood plain of the stream.
Tertiary wastewater treatment Selected biological, physical, and chemical separation processes to
remove organic and inorganic substances that resist conventional treatment practices; the additional
treatment of efﬂuent beyond that of primary and secondary treatment methods to obtain a very high
quality of efﬂuent. The complete wastewater-treatment process typically involves a three-phase
Glossary and Conversion factors
845

process: (1) First, in the primary wastewater-treatment process, which incorporates physical
aspects, untreated water is passed through a series of screens to remove solid wastes; (2) second,
in the secondary wastewater-treatment process, typically involving biological and chemical pro-
cesses, screened wastewater is then passed a series of holding and aeration tanks and ponds; and
(3) third, the tertiary wastewater-treatment process consists of ﬂocculation basins, clariﬁers, ﬁlters,
and chlorine basins or ozone or ultraviolet radiation processes.
Thermal pollution A reduction in water quality caused by increasing its temperature often due to
disposal of waste heat from industrial or power generation processes. Thermally polluted water can
harm the environment because plants and animals can have a hard time adapting to it.
Thermal stratiﬁcation (of a lake) Vertical temperature stratiﬁcation that shows the following: the
upper layer of the lake, known as the epilimnion, in which the water temperature is virtually
uniform; a stratum next below, known as the thermocline, in which there is a marked drop in
temperature per unit of depth; and the lowermost region or stratum, known as the hypolimnion, in
which the temperature from its upper limit to the bottom is nearly uniform.
Thermocline See Thermal stratiﬁcation.
Thermoelectric power water use Water used in the process of the generation of thermoelectric
power. Power plants that burn coal and oil are examples of thermoelectric-power facilities.
Threatened waterbody A waterbody that is meeting standards but exhibits a declining trend in water
quality such that it will likely exceed standards.
Throughfall In a vegetated area, the precipitation that falls directly to the ground or the rainwater or
snowmelt that drops from twigs or leaves.
Time of concentration The time required for water to ﬂow from the farthest point on the watershed to
the gaging station.
TMDL process The approach normally used to develop a TMDL for a particular waterbody or
watershed. This process consists of ﬁve activities, including selection of the pollutant to consider,
estimation of the waterbody’s assimilative capacity, estimation of the pollution from all sources to
the waterbody, predictive analysis of pollution in the waterbody and determination of total allow-
able pollution load, and allocation of the allowable pollution among the different pollution sources
in a manner that water quality standards are achieved.
Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) TKN is the summation of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and
organic nitrogen (organic-N).
Total maximum daily load (TMDL) (1) The amount, or load, of a speciﬁc pollutant that a waterbody
can assimilate and still meet the water quality standard for its designated use. (2) An estimate of the
pollutant concentrations resulting from the pollutant loadings from all sources to a waterbody. The
TMDL is used to determine the allowable loads and provides the basis for establishing or modifying
controls on pollutant sources. For impaired waterbodies the TMDL reduces the overall load by
allocating the load among current pollutant loads (from point and nonpoint sources), background or
natural loads, a margin of safety, and sometimes an allocation for future growth.
Total nitrogen It is the summation of ammonium nitrogen (NH4
+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3
-N),
nitrite nitrogen (NO2
-N), and organic nitrogen (organic-N). Usually nitrite nitrogen is in negligible
amount. Crops directly utilize nitrogen in its inorganic forms, principally nitrate-N and
ammonium-N.
Total solids (TS) Total solids (TS) include suspended and dissolved solids and are usually expressed
as the concentration present in biosolids. TS depend on the type of wastewater process and
biosolids’ treatment prior to land application. Typical solids contents of various biosolids are liquid
(2–12 %), dewatered (12–30 %), and dried or composted (50 %).

Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act to report to the TRI. In the 2005 reporting
year, approximately 23,500 facilities reported to the TRI.
Trace elements Trace elements are found in low concentrations in biosolids. The trace elements of
interest in biosolids are those commonly referred to as “heavy metals.”
Transient noncommunity water system A water system which provides water in a place such as a
gas station or campground where people do not remain for long periods of time. These systems do
not have to test or treat their water for contaminants which pose long-term health risks because
fewer than 25 people drink the water over a long period. They still must test their water for microbes
and several chemicals.
Transmissibility (groundwater) The capacity of a rock to transmit water under pressure. The
coefﬁcient of transmissibility is the rate of ﬂow of water, at the prevailing water temperature, in
gallons per day, through a vertical strip of the aquifer 1 ft wide, extending the full saturated height of
the aquifer under a hydraulic gradient of 100 %. A hydraulic gradient of 100 % means a 1 ft
(0.3048 m) drop in head in 1 ft (0.3048 m) of ﬂow distance.
Transpiration (1) The quantity of water absorbed and transpired and used directly in the building of
plant tissue, in a speciﬁed time. (2) Process by which water that is absorbed by plants, usually
through the roots, is evaporated into the atmosphere from the plant surface, such as leaf pores. (See
Evapotranspiration). It does not include soil evaporation. The process by which water vapor escapes
from the living plant, principally the leaves, and enters the atmosphere. As considered practically,
transpiration also includes guttation.
Treatment Any process that changes the physical, chemical, or biological character of a waste to
make it less of an environmental threat. Treatment can neutralize the waste, recover energy or
material resources from it, render it less hazardous, or make it safer to transport, store, or dispose of.
Treatment technique (TT) A required process intended to reduce the level of a contaminant in
drinking water.
Treatment works Federally owned, publicly owned, or privately owned device or system used to
treat (including recycle or reclaim) either domestic sewage or a combination of domestic sewage
and industrial waste of a liquid nature.
Treatment works treating domestic sewage A POTW (publicly owned treatment works) or other
sewage sludge or wastewater-treatment system or device, regardless of ownership used in the
storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation of municipal or domestic sewage, including land
dedicated for the disposal of sewage sludge.

Trend A statistical term referring to the direction or rate of increase or decrease in magnitude of the
individual members of a time series of data when random ﬂuctuations of individual members are
disregarded.
Tributary A smaller river or stream that ﬂows into a larger river or stream. Usually, a number of
smaller tributaries merge to form a river.
Trophic state The state of nutrition (e.g., amount of nutrients) in a body of water.
Troposphere The layer of the atmosphere closest to the Earth’s surface. The troposphere extends
from the surface up to about 6–9 miles.
Turbidity (1) The cloudy appearance of water caused by the presence of tiny particles. High levels of
turbidity may interfere with proper water treatment and monitoring. (2) The amount of solid
particles that are suspended in water and that cause light rays shining through the water to scatter.
Thus, turbidity makes the water cloudy or even opaque in extreme cases. Turbidity is measured in
nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). (3) A measure of the degree of clarity of a solution. For cloudy
water, turbidity would be high; for clear water, turbidity would be low.
Underﬂow The downstream ﬂow of water through the permeable deposits that underlie a stream and
that are more or less limited by rocks of low permeability.
Underground injection or well injection The technology of placing ﬂuids underground in porous
formations of rocks, through wells or other conveyance systems. The ﬂuids may be water, waste-
water, or water mixed with chemicals. Regulations for disposing of waste this way vary depending
on type of waste. RCRA hazardous waste is placed in highly regulated (Class 1) wells.
Unit hydrograph The hydrograph of direct runoff from a storm uniformly distributed over the
drainage basin during a speciﬁed unit of time; the hydrograph is reduced in vertical scale to
correspond to a volume of runoff of 1 in. from the drainage basin.
Unit nitrogen fertilizer rate (UNFR) UNFR is a rate in lb-N per unit crop yield, where the unit can
be either bushel or ton. [Note: 1 bu (US bushel) ¼ 1.2444 ft3, 1 British bushel ¼ 1.2843 ft3, 1 t
(British ton) ¼ 2,000 lb, 1 T (metric ton or mt) ¼ 1,000 kg].
Unsaturated zone The zone immediately below the land surface where the pores contain both water
and air, but are not totally saturated with water. These zones differ from an aquifer, where the pores
are saturated with water.
Upland Any area that does not qualify as wetland because the associated hydrologic regime is not
sufﬁciently wet to elicit development of vegetation, soil, and/or hydrologic characteristics associ-
ated with wetlands or is deﬁned as open waters.
Urbanization The concentration of development in relatively small areas (cities and suburbs). The
US Census Bureau deﬁnes “urban” as referring to areas with more than 1.5 people per acre.
Usable storage The volume normally available for release from a reservoir below the stage of the
maximum controllable level.
Variance State or the US EPA permission not to meet a certain drinking water standard. The water
system must prove that (1) it cannot meet a MCL, even while using the best available treatment
method, because of the characteristics of the raw water, and (2) the variance will not create an
unreasonable risk to public health. The state or the US EPA must review, and allow public comment
on, a variance every 3 years. States can also grant variances to water systems that serve small
populations and which prove that they are unable to afford the required treatment, an alternative
water source, or otherwise comply with the standard.
Vector attraction Characteristics (e.g., odor) that attract birds, insects, and other animals that are
capable of transmitting infectious agents.
848
M.-H.S. Wang and L.K. Wang

Vectors Vectors include rodents, birds, insects that can transport pathogens away from the land
application site.
Violation A failure to meet any state or federal drinking water regulation.
Volatile solids (VS) Volatile solids (VS) provide an estimate of the readily decomposable organic
matter in biosolids and are usually expressed as a percentage of total solids. VS are an important
determinant of potential odor problems at land application sites.
Volatilization Ammonium-N in biosolids/manure can be signiﬁcant, making up even half the initial
PAN of biosolids/manure. The ammonium-N of biosolids/manure can vary widely depending on
treatment and storage. Since ammonium-N is prone to volatilization (as ammonia gas, NH3), the
application method affects PAN. For instance, surface applied biosolids are expected to lose half of
their ammonium-N. Conversely, direct subsurface injection or soil incorporation of biosolids within
24 h minimizes volatilization losses. The conversion of ammonium-N to ammonia gas form (NH3)
is called volatilization.
Vulnerability assessment An evaluation of drinking water source quality and its vulnerability to
contamination by pathogens and toxic chemicals.
Wadeable stream A stream, creek, or small river that is shallow enough to be sampled using methods
that involve wading into the water. Wadeable streams typically include waters classiﬁed as ﬁrst
through fourth order in the Strahler Stream Order Classiﬁcation system.
Wastewater Water that has been used in homes, industries, and businesses that is not for reuse unless
it is treated.
Wastewater-treatment return ﬂow Water returned to the environment by wastewater-treatment
facilities.
Water balance See Hydrologic budget.
Water conservation Promotion of the efﬁcient use of water through the economically or socially
beneﬁcial lessening of water withdrawals, water use, or wastewater reduction. Conservation can
forestall future water supply capacity needs and can be implemented on water supply as well as on
water demand. It can consist of both temporary and permanent measures for improvement of both
water quantity and water quality.
Water content of snow See Water equivalent of snow.
Water crop See Water yield.
Water cycle The circuit of water movement from the oceans to the atmosphere and to the Earth and
return to the atmosphere through various stages or processes such as precipitation, interception,
runoff, inﬁltration, percolation, storage, evaporation, and transportation.
Water equivalent of snow Amount of water that would be obtained if the snow should be completely
melted. Water content may be merely the amount of liquid water in the snow at the time of
observation.
Water loss The difference between the average precipitation over a drainage basin and the water yield
from the basin for a given period. The basic concept is that water loss is equal to evapotranspiration,
that is, water that returns to the atmosphere and thus is no longer available for use. However, the
term is also applied to differences between measured inﬂow and outﬂow even where part of the
difference may be seepage.
Water quality A term used to describe the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water,
usually in respect to its suitability for a particular purpose.
Water quality standard (WQS) The combination of a designated use and the maximum concentra-
tion of a pollutant which will protect that use for any given body of water. For example, in a trout
stream, the concentration of iron should not exceed 1 mg/L.
Glossary and Conversion factors

Water quality standards Standards that set the goals, pollution limits, and protection requirements
for each waterbody. These standards are composed of designated (beneﬁcial) uses, numeric and
narrative criteria, and anti-degradation policies and procedures.
Water requirement The quantity of water, regardless of its source, required by a crop in a given
period of time, for its normal growth under ﬁeld conditions. It includes surface evaporation and
other economically unavoidable wastes.
Water table (1) The top of the water surface in the saturated part of an aquifer; (2) the upper surface
of a zone of saturation; (3) the boundary between the saturated and unsaturated zones. Generally, the
level to which water will rise in a well (except artesian wells).
Water use Water that is used for a speciﬁc purpose, such as for domestic use, irrigation, or industrial
processing. Water use pertains to human’s interaction with and inﬂuence on the hydrologic cycle
and includes elements, such as water withdrawal from surface- and groundwater sources, water
delivery to homes and businesses, consumptive use of water, water released from wastewater-
treatment plants, water returned to the environment, and instream uses, such as using water to
produce hydroelectric power.
Water year In the US Geological Survey reports dealing with surface-water supply, it is the 12-month
period, October 1 through September 30. The water year is designated by the calendar year in which
it ends and includes 9 of the 12 months. Thus, the year that ended last September 30, 1959, is called
the “1959 water year.”
Water yield (water crop or runout) The runoff from the drainage basin, including groundwater
outﬂow that appears in the stream plus groundwater outﬂow that bypasses the gaging station and
leaves the basin underground. Water yield is the precipitation minus the evapotranspiration.
Watershed (1) A watershed is the area of land where all of the water that is under it or drains off of it
goes into the same place at a lower elevation. (2) The land area from which water drains into a
stream, river, or reservoir. (3) Land area that drains to a common waterway, such as a stream, lake,
estuary, wetland, or ultimately the ocean. (4) The land area that drains water to a particular stream,
river, or lake. It is a land feature that can be identiﬁed by tracing a line along the highest elevations
between two areas on a map, often a ridge. Large watersheds, like the Mississippi River basin,
contain thousands of smaller watersheds. (5) The divide separating one drainage basin from another
and in the past has been generally used to convey this meaning. However, over the years, the use of
the term to signify drainage basin or catchment area has come to predominate, although drainage
basin is preferred. Drainage divide, or just divide, is used to denote the boundary between one
drainage area and another.
Watershed approach A ﬂexible framework for managing water resource quality and quantity within
a speciﬁed drainage area or watershed. This approach includes stakeholder involvement and
management actions supported by sound science and appropriate technology.
Watershed plan A document that provides assessment and management information for a geograph-
ically deﬁned watershed, including the analyses, actions, participants, and resources related to
development and implementation of the plan.
Watershed protection approach (WPA) The US EPA’s comprehensive approach to managing water
resource areas, such as river basins, watersheds, and aquifers. WPA contains four major features:
targeting priority problems, stakeholder involvement, integrated solutions, and measuring success.
Water-treatment plant A facility designed to receive and treat the raw surface water, raw ground-
water, or rainwater for production of drinking water meeting the government’s drinking water
standards or for production of industrial water meeting the speciﬁc industrial water quality
standards.

Watt-hour (Wh) An electrical energy unit of measure equal to 1 W of power supplied to, or taken
from, an electrical circuit steadily for 1 h.
Well (water) An artiﬁcial excavation put down by any method for the purposes of withdrawing water
from the underground aquifers. A bored, drilled, or driven shaft or a dug hole whose depth is greater
than the largest surface dimension and whose purpose is to reach underground water supplies or oil
or to store or bury ﬂuids below ground.
Wellhead protection area The area surrounding a drinking water well or well ﬁeld which is protected
to prevent contamination of the well(s).
Wetland (1) An area that is inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and
duration sufﬁcient to support, and that under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of
vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include
swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. (2) An area where water covers the soil or is present
either at or near the surface of the soil all year (or at least for periods of time during the year).
(3) Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and
duration sufﬁcient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of
vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetland generally includes
swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
Width/depth ratio The width to depth ratio describes a dimension of bankfull channel width to
bankfull mean depth. Bankfull discharge is deﬁned as the momentary maximum peak ﬂow which
occurs several days a year and is related to the concept of channel-forming ﬂow.
Width/meander length ratio The ratio of the average width of a stream or river over a reach divided
by the average length over successive cycles of left and right bends of the stream or river.
Wildlife refuge An area designated for the protection of wild animals, within which hunting and
ﬁshing are either prohibited or strictly controlled.
Withdrawal Water removed from a ground- or surface-water source for use.
Withdrawal use of water The water removed from the ground or diverted from a stream or lake
for use.
Xeriscaping A method of landscaping that uses plants that are well adapted to the local area and are
drought resistant. Xeriscaping is becoming more popular as a way of saving water at home.
Yield (1) It is the crop harvested in the unit of bu/acre or ton/acre. (2) Mass per unit time per unit area.
Zone of aeration The zone above the water table. Water in the zone of aeration does not ﬂow into
a well.
Zone of saturation The zone in which the functional permeable rocks are saturated with water under
hydrostatic pressure. Water in the zone of saturation will ﬂow into a well and is called groundwater.
