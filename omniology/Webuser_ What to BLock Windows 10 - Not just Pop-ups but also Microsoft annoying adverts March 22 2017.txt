Pop-up goes the Windows
D
eep down, I think we all knew that there
would be a trade-off for Microsoft
offering Windows 10 for free for a year.
First came the realisation that we’d surrendered
our privacy, then the various problems caused
by forced updates and finally – and most
annoying of all – the gradual appearance of
more and more pop-ups, adverts and other
nags throughout the operating system. ‘Try
Office 365 for one month’, ‘Microsoft Edge is
faster than Chrome’ ‘Upgrade now to Microsoft
Solitaire Collection Premium Edition’ –
Windows 10 has more shameless cross-
promotion than BBC Breakfast.

F
acebook’s new Messenger Day feature takes
inspiration from Snapchat Stories by letting
you share pictures and videos with friends for
24 hours, after which they disappear.
To use Messenger Day, you need the latest
version of the app. Tap the camera or the Add To
Your Day button and take a photo or record
a video of up to 15 seconds. Use the smiley face,
Aa and squiggly line icons to add art or text, then
tap the arrow in the bottom-right corner and
select My Day from the menu screen. When a
friend opens Messenger, they will see your Day
thumbnail at the top of the screen, which they
can then tap to see what you’ve posted. If you
use a photo or video in a Messenger
conversation, you can add that to your day, too.
There’s plenty of scope for interaction, with
custom messages that pop up in Day threads
and an Active Now green dot to show you’re
available. Profile icons that appear below your
Day profile show who’s viewing your content.

This quiz dishes out snippets of Wikipedia articles that
describe a city and invites you to guess which (and where)
it is. The quiz is spread over five rounds and you can read
the description to look for key clues, move around a 3D
globe, zoom in and place a pin in the spot you think is
correct. Be warned, though, it’s extra tough because you
need to know both the correct answer and the city’s location
on a map. You get a couple of hints if you’re stuck, and you
still earn points for guessing the correct country.

various levels of “toxicity” that exist. The second lets you
write your own comment on anything and gauge its potential
impact. You’re given
a score based on how

Need to Know
Photo: Premier League
8 22 March - 4 April 2017
What happened?
A court has ruled in favour of blocking
football matches from being streamed
on Kodi set-top boxes. Under the order,
the Premier League will be able to
prevent third-party Kodi add-ons from
illegally streaming its games.
Kodi is a popular media centre that
allows users to stream TV shows,
movies and even sports matches for
free, which the rights holders of such
content understandably aren’t keen
on. As explained in our cover feature
in Issue 416 (bit.ly/webuser416), the
Kodi software itself isn’t illegal, but
using it to knowingly access pirated
material could get you in trouble,
although so far industry authorities
have only targeted those selling the
boxes and providing the streams.
The Premier League applied for and
won a court order that forces ISPs to
block the source of the streaming
games. The ISPs in question – Sky, BT,
Virgin Media and TalkTalk – didn’t
dispute the order, and already exercise
similar blocks against peer-to-peer
sharing sites such as The Pirate Bay,
also under court order. It’s no surprise
that ISPs are willing to help block such
piracy. Sky and BT have between them
paid £5bn for the rights to air the
games live via their television networks.
The Premier League said it would
target suppliers of the pirated streams
at the source in a “proportionate
and precise manner”. It won’t
be targeting every individual
streaming add-on or website,
but will instead block the server
where the stream originates.
The move follows news that a
Scottish man has pleaded guilty
to “card sharing” – pirating
content by sharing subscriptions
to premium TV. Gavin Gray
provided premium content by
selling dodgy access codes – a
technique that earned him tens
of thousands of pounds and,
after he was caught, 300 hours
of community service.
How will it affect you?
If you’ve been using a Kodi box to watch
Premier League games, those streams
will soon become much more difficult to
find and may disappear entirely –
although it’s worth remembering that
pirates are very good at finding ways
around such blocks. The court order
gives the Premier League the ability to
block streams mid-game, so if you do
find a source, it may disappear while
you’re watching the match.
The Premier League is specifically
targeting the people who are making
the streams available, so there’s no need
to panic that the authorities will come
knocking on your door, but do
remember that such
content is pirated.
You can, of course,
shell out for a Sky or
BT Sports
subscription to watch
live games or head to
a local pub that’s
screening the match.
What do we
think?
It’s no surprise that
people are looking
for ways around
paying for live
football matches –
subscriptions to Sky Sports and BT
Sports aren’t cheap. But while there’s
certainly appeal in dodging monthly
fees topping £27 a month, there’s no
avoiding the fact that it’s piracy.
Indeed, while Kodi software wasn’t
designed for piracy, the fact that it’s
largely used for the practice could see it
banned by the Intellectual Property
Office (IPO). The watchdog is currently
consulting on the issue, and considering
how best to deal with the use of set-top
boxes for piracy. That consultation ends
in April, and could see tougher action
taken against Kodi box sellers.
Many Brits have spent their hard-
earned cash on a Kodi box in the hopes
of dodging streaming fees, but if the
IPO decides to ban the software, they
may stop working soon. With the wide
variety of streaming services available,
there’s little excuse not to pay for films
and TV shows, though it is frustrating to
have to switch between providers or
wait for shows to arrive knowing they’re
already available online.
Simply put, Kodi boxes are popular
because they’re easy to use and cheap.
The industry should do all it can to make
watching streaming content as easy as
it is on Kodi boxes, offering new movies
as quickly as possible and keeping costs
down. Convenience and fair prices
remain the best ways to beat piracy.

What we think of this fortnight’s top tech news stories and rumours,
and how they affect you
22 March - 4 April 2017 9
Discuss web news at forum.webuser.co.uk
Need to Know
What happened?
Google has developed a
new system for checking
that web users are humans
and not robots, which
ditches CAPTCHA puzzles
in favour of behavioural
analysis.
CAPTCHAs are difficult
for automated systems to
solve, but easy for humans,
so they’re used by sites
such as ticket vendors to
stop bots buying in bulk.
They show skewed words,
or a series of pictures that,
for example, ask you to
type the words or numbers
that appear, or click all the
images containing tea or
some other theme.
Instead, the new system
observes how you interact
with a site, looking for
‘imperfect’ human
behaviour, such as the
length of time taken to
perform actions and how
a mouse is moved, which
will differ from the
movements of an efficient,
automated robot.
Google moves on
from CAPTCHA
How will it affect you?
Most of us find CAPTCHAs
annoying because they
add an extra step to
processes such as online
purchases and registering
with a site, and some
people – particularly those
with sight problems –
struggle to make out the
wobbly text or small,
poor-quality images,
although including an
audio aspect can make
this easier.
That said, CAPTCHA
systems have a side
benefit: they’ve been used
to help digitise books and
to teach artificial
intelligence. Words that
computers couldn’t
automatically read were
fed through CAPTCHA,
letting us humans type the
text, while AI systems were
trained using picture
CAPTCHAs. Simplifying
the system will sacrifice
those benefits.
What do we think?
Tackling the automated
abuse of online systems
is a constant battle, so
it’s no surprise that
CAPTCHA is the latest
casualty in the search
for a simpler, better
system. That said, it’s
hard to believe bot
makers won’t simply
programme their
scripts to interact with
websites in a way that
mimics human
behaviour. Most likely,
this is just the next
stage in a system that
evolves by two sides
constantly trying to
outwit each other.
What happened?
BT and telecoms regulator
Ofcom have finally reached
a deal to make the ISP’s
Openreach division more
independent, after months
of negotiations.
Openreach is BT’s
infrastructure arm, and one
if its jobs is to roll out and
manage broadband lines.
Rivals have long
complained that
Openreach is anti-
competitive because it
gives BT preferential
treatment. In response to
this pressure, Ofcom and
BT have worked out a plan
to legally separate
Openreach, although BT
will still own the company
and set its budget.
Under the plans,
Openreach will ditch all BT
branding, have its own
staff and management, and
control its own spending. It
will be able to have deals
with BT rivals such as Sky
and TalkTalk that are held
confidentially and not
disclosed to BT. The deal
avoids a full split between
the two companies, but
Ofcom could still order this.
The agreement won’t
come into power until later
this year because
BT splits from
Openreach network
Parliament first needs to
pass legislation protecting
the pensions of the 32,000
Openreach workers, as BT
pensions are underwritten
by a crown guarantee.
How will it affect you?
If you’re a BT Retail
customer, don’t panic
– Openreach will still
supply services to BT. The
main difference is how it
will deal with other
broadband companies.
The hope is that by
spinning out Openreach,
we’ll see increased
competition. Additionally,
rival ISPs will now have to
be consulted on rollout
work, so it could affect
where fibre spreads next.
What do we think?
This battle is far from over.
Ofcom and rival ISPs will
keep close watch on how
BT and Openreach behave,
particularly on how the
latter invests in fibre
broadband. That should
lead to a bump in
investment in fibre – and
faster broadband for more
people – as analysts
predict that Openreach will
want to prove it’s no longer
at BT’s beck and call.

BeatsX
bit.ly/beatsx419
Beats headphones receive a lot of
stick from audio experts, and the first
time we tried BeatsX, we were with
the sceptics: the sound was muddy,
slightly distorted and generally bad.
However, over time, we adjusted to
the audio, although this depended
on the type of music we played –
heavy rock was limp and slightly
distorted, but electronic music
sounded excellent.
It’s not ideal that a pair of £119
headphones should limit what kind of
music you can best listen to, but there
are other features of BeatsX that
lifted them further in our estimation.
First, there’s the inclusion of Apple’s
W1 chip, which makes the pairing and
Bluetooth management incredibly
over each ear piece to help secure
them in place. They are also the first
Beats headphones to include a
Lightning port, which means you can
charge them using the same cable as
your iPhone.
Battery life is acceptable, but not
stellar (Apple claims around eight
hours on a full charge), and the buds
are also magnetised, so when they
sit around your neck they make a
satisfying ‘click’ and attach to each
other, which means you’re less likely
to lose them.
It may seem crazy to recommend
a pair of £119 headphones that
produce below-par sound quality, but
we think the design and convenience
of BeatsX makes up for the shortfall.
Not a purchase for audio experts,
then, but in every other way they are
a step up for on-the-go listening.
What happened?
Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the
web, has expressed concern about the
way the internet is being used. In an
exclusive article in the Guardian, he
outlined how the web can fulfil its “true
potential” as a tool that can help
everyone, not just organisations that
want to harvest and exploit information
about the world’s citizens.
Berners-Lee highlighted three trends
he thinks are having a detrimental effect
on the web. The first involves companies
gathering personal data in return for
very little that benefits the end user.
Although people are happy to share
their data in return for a freebie, that
doesn’t make it right for businesses to
own the public’s data and keep it out of
sight in “proprietary silos”.
Governments are also increasingly
watching our every move online and
using that surveillance to pass extreme
laws that trample on our rights to
privacy, Berners-Lee said. This creates
a “chilling” effect on free speech, which
means the web is no longer a place
where people can safely explore
important topics such as sensitive
health issues, sexuality or religion.
Berners-Lee also referred to the
dangers of misinformation – or
“fake news” – which spreads rapidly
across the web via social networks
and search engines.
Tim Berners-Lee explains how to save the web
How will it affect you?
Berners-Lee said the solution to these
problems is for web users to work with
online companies to ensure we control
our own data, and fight against data-
surveillance laws. It’s also everyone’s
responsibility to hold search engines
and social networks accountable and
make sure they come up with ways to
stop the spread of misinformation,
including a call to make online political
advertising more ethical. “It has taken
all of us to build the web we have, and
now it is up to all of us to build the web
we want – for everyone”, said Sir Tim.
What do we think?
As ever, Tim Berners-Lee has hit the nail
on the head by identifying the biggest
problems web users are currently facing
and what can be done to solve them.
Indeed, the topics he touched on –
relentless data collection, widespread
government surveillance and the spread
of fake news – are issues we have
regularly addressed in Web User over
the last year. As the inventor of the web,
Sir Tim must be horrified at how it is
being abused, but at least he has
constructive ideas about how to tackle
these concerns.
smooth. Turn on BeatsX, hold them
close to your iPhone and a dialogue
appears on screen asking if you want to
pair them. After tapping Yes, the
headphones are paired with all the
Apple devices associated with your
iCloud account.
For anyone who struggles with
wearing in-ear headphones, BeatsX

celebrate the device’s 10th
anniversary, according
to Japanese website
Macotakara (bit.ly/mac419),
The site claims the iPhone
Edition will be a special
celebration device launched
alongside the iPhone 7S and
iPhone 7S Plus, which will
only constitute a small
update to the current iPhone
7, as is normal for an ‘S’
series iPhone.
Apple already has a product branded
with the ‘Edition’ suffix – the Apple
Watch Edition, which was a special
18-karat gold version of its smart watch.
It cost $10,000 (£8,200), so it won’t be
much of a surprise if a smartphone
Edition model has a price tag of $1,000
(£822), as was previously rumoured.
Don’t expect a solid gold phone,
though – Apple is reportedly looking to
test various versions of the iPhone
Edition using glass, ceramic and
aluminium chassis finishes, rather than
the rather more weighty gold.
Last year, Macotokara published an
article about additional iPhone 7S and
iPhone 7S Plus models, along with
predictions of a 5in model equipped
with the iSight Duo camera. The site
announced, “This 5in model would
highly possibly be the ‘iPhone Edition’
Is Apple set to release a
special-edition iPhone?
What’s new on Kickstarter
Our favourite new project on the crowdfunding site
which is the premium model”.
Because Apple is still testing these
versions, it’s likely that while details of
the iPhone Edition will be revealed at
the same time as the 7S and 7S Plus,
it won’t be commercially available
until much later.

LIKELIHOOD RATING
✓✓✓✓✓
The iPhone’s 10th anniversary
seems like the ideal excuse
to release a special premium
edition of the ground-breaking
smartphone, especially since
Apple devotees are likely to buy
it in addition to the 7S or 7S Plus.
We won’t be surprised if it carries
a premium price tag, too.

The faster your site loads, the better the experience is for your visitors. Even little things can make a surprising
difference. Here’s how to cut the bloat out of your site’s CSS and JavaScript files.
THIS ISSUE’S EXPERT:

Google DataStudio is now free
Google offers a variety of
analytical tools for measuring the
performance of your website –
from how many visitors you get
to which pages they’re looking at.
The constant flow of data
generated by these services can
be confusing, so Google provides
a tool – DataStudio (datastudio
.google.com) – to capture
snapshots from Analytics and
other data sources. This was
previously a freemium service,
with a limit on the number of
reports you could create, but you
can now use it as much as you
like, free of charge.
You could also export this data
from Analytics to load into a
spreadsheet, but if you sign into
DataStudio with your Google
account, your Analytics data is
ready and waiting to be
converted into graphs and tables,
making site analysis even easier.
DMOZ is deceased
Back in the early days of SEO
(search engine optimisation) you
could get a boost from Google by
getting your site listed in hand-
crafted databases of websites.
The king of them was DMOZ
(www.dmoz.org), launched in 1998
and hand-moderated by a huge
team of volunteers. Moderation
was strict, so inclusion in the
database was a clear indication to
Google that a site was good.
However, after 18 years, the site
has been shut down by current
owner AOL. You should still be
able to view it, for old time’s sake,
at the Internet Archive’s Wayback
Machine (archive.org/web).

Q
Is there any benefit to building
a basic site from scratch using
HTML?
Anthony Fallon, via email
A
There are only a few situations in
which I would recommend building
a website from scratch. One is for
educational purposes, because working in
HTML can provide a deep understanding of
how the web works. But the minute you
want to add features, such as mobile
responsiveness, or change layouts, you’ll
need to quickly graduate to a more
advanced language. If you just want to build
a website for personal use or for your small
business, I would suggest using a website
builder such as the next-gen GoDaddy
Website Builder; or for more advanced
users, try a managed WordPress account.

Logobook
www.logobook.com
Logos provide companies with a brand
identity but they’re also little works of art
in their own right, as this website
demonstrates. Packed with logos dating
back to the Fifties, the site was created
primarily as a reference tool for
designers, but anyone can admire the
designs on show within the five main
categories. There’s much fun to be had in
spotting familiar logos and learning more
about them. We like the way logos are
arranged neatly over four columns, and
that each is black and white to allow its
originality, simplicity and charm to shine
through. You could easily spend many
hours browsing this fascinating site.

Many of us still aren’t quite sure what home automation has to offer, aside from
controlling a thermostat and a few light bulbs remotely. To remedy this, Apple has
relaunched its Home site with a smart new design to promote the automative
capabilities of iOS and TvOS, starting with a brief video showing how Siri and Apple’s
Home app can assist you in rolling up the blinds, brewing the coffee and locking your
house. You can explore 50 HomeKit-compatible product brands, view examples of
Home-based Siri commands and learn how to use Apple TV as a home hub. If you like

This government site explains what you

a video, what happens when you contact
the police. It provides the number to call

Baker Days
www.bakerdays.com
Baker Days offers delicious personalised
cakes that fit through your letter box.
The revamped website speeds up the
ordering process, replaces the unwieldy
navigation bar with swish drop-down
menus and uses larger thumbnail images
instead of the tiny, badly cut-out versions
of old. Personalising cakes is also more
straightforward. As well as choosing the
size of the cake and its ingredients, you
can upload images, edit the wording and
change the text style, and the site shows
you the results of your changes in real
time. There’s also a photo-upload guide
to ensure your cake looks its best. Yum!
Nightly Travel
www.nightly.travel
As if booking a hotel wasn’t difficult
enough, Nightly Travel adds a further
complication by suggesting that you
switch hotels mid-trip to save money.
The site works on the principle that some
nights cost more than others. Enter your
dates and destination and it finds you
low-cost combos. The results are clear
and the hotel pages comprehensive, but
you have to register to use the site and
the hotels can be many miles apart.
What’s more, some of the prices quoted
are much too high: it claimed five nights
at The New York Edition would cost
£3,850, while Expedia stated £2,704.

Spammers leak database
of 1.4 billion users
One of the world’s
largest spam-
email operations
has reportedly
had its entire
archive of
1.37 billion user
records leaked
online, after the
spammers failed to password protect
the database. In what is being
described as a “tangible threat to
online privacy and security”, the
massive data hoard apparently
includes email addresses, real names,
IP addresses and, in some cases,
home addresses and postcodes.
The discovery was made when
Chris Vickery, security researcher at
MacKeeper Security Research Centre,
stumbled upon the publicly exposed
database that was lacking password
protection. Since then, a research
cooperative made up of investigators
from MacKeeper, CSOOnline and
Spamhaus has been trawling through
the leaked files and identified that
a group known as River City Media
was responsible.
“The leaky files, it turns out,
represent the backbone operations
of a group calling themselves River
City Media (RCM),” said Chris Vickery,
in a blog post describing the
News about the latest threats and advice from security experts

Alvin Slocombe and Matt Ferris, RCM
masquerades as a legitimate marketing
firm while, per their own documentation,
being responsible for up to a billion daily
email sends.”

WikiLeaks exposes CIA
hacking tools
WikiLeaks has claimed the CIA can hack
into almost any device using hacking
tools that are specifically designed to lift
data from electronic devices.
WikiLeaks announced in a statement
that it had obtained “the largest ever
publication of confidential documents
on the agency”, a cache codenamed
‘Vault 7’. The first batch to be leaked
consists of 8,761 documents and files
detailing that authorities have worked
out how to access data on Android
devices, iPhones, Microsoft Windows
and even Samsung smart TVs. More
specifically, the documents reveal that
in 2016 the CIA “had 24 ‘weaponized’
Android ‘zero days’”, enabling it
to bypass the encryption in highly
secure messaging platforms such as
WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. The
files were accessed via an internal
network inside the CIA’s Center for
Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia.
bit.ly/wikileaks419
iOS protected against CIA
attacks
Most iOS devices are protected against
the CIA attacks revealed by WikiLeaks,
Apple has claimed. In a statement sent
to Web User’s sister site IT Pro, the
Cupertino company said: “The
technology built into today’s iPhone
represents the best data security
available to consumers, and we’re
constantly working to keep it that way.
While our initial analysis indicates that
many of the issues leaked were already
patched in the latest iOS, we will
continue work to rapidly address any
identified vulnerabilities. We always
urge customers to make sure they have
the most recent security updates.”
What proportion of the issues
“many” represents is unclear. Microsoft
and Samsung both said they are
currently “looking into” the matter,
but gave no further information on
the current scope or validity of the
attacks detailed in the so-called
‘Vault 7’ documents.

B
T’s Whole Home Wi-Fi
is the latest product
in a wave of multi-box
wireless ‘mesh’ routers that
aim to banish deadspots
by blanketing your home
with strong, solid Wi-Fi.
It’s cheaper than Netgear’s
Orbi (reviewed in Issue 415 –
bit.ly/issue415) but more
expensive than Devolo’s
GigaGate (reviewed in Issue
417 – bit.ly/webuser417),
and comes with an extra box
(three instead of two),
promising to push its Wi-Fi
signal further still.
The concept is a simple
one. By using several routers
to spread the wireless signal
around your home, you get
a strong signal everywhere.
While it’s possible (and much
cheaper) to use wireless
repeaters to extend the reach
of your network, they can
BT Whole
Home Wi-Fi
be tricky to set up and don’t
perform as well as the
multi-box systems, which are
designed with ease-of-use
in mind and are simple to
set up and maintain.
Setup and positioning
BT’s system works in a very
similar way to the Orbi and
the GigaGate, and is also
designed to be completely
plug-and-play. Download the
app, run through the step-by-
step instructions and you’ll be
up and running in minutes.
When you connect the first
disc-shaped wireless unit to
enter the preconfigured
security key (from the plastic
tab in the rear of the router
discs) into all your devices.
Connecting to the
network
BT Whole Home Wi-Fi offers
dual-band connectivity and
each disc is effectively
a 4x4 MIMO 802.11ac router
offering speeds of up to
1,733Mbps over 5GHz
and 800Mbps over 2.4GHz.
However, it doesn’t show two
separate networks as a normal
wireless router would. Instead,
the system uses a technique
known as band-steering to
assess each connected device
and hook it up to the most
appropriate frequency on the
disc offering the strongest
connection. It sounds like
magic but it seems to work.
The one misstep is that
BT’s multipoint wireless
system is fast and reliable,
but it’s not cheap.
Jonathan Bray reckons
it’s worth the money
your existing router via its
single Gigabit Ethernet port,
it automatically configures
itself. You’re then ready to
plug in your second and third
discs, which automatically
pair with the first to establish
a simple mesh network.
You can place the discs
wherever you like, but the
app offers to improve your
coverage and speeds by
monitoring the signal strength
and letting you know if the
second and third satellite
discs would be better
positioned closer to the hub.

BT Whole Home Wi-Fi Product Test
22 March - 4 April 2017 21
Discuss this review at forum.webuser.co.uk
BT Whole Home Wi-Fi is
the third device of this type
we’ve reviewed in Web
User and they all have their
strengths and weaknesses.
Netgear’s Orbi is the most
expensive but its devices
are the most advanced –
each one is a full-featured
router in its own right.
Devolo’s GigaGate is
cheaper but doesn’t have all
the hardware features of its
rivals. Both do an excellent
job of improving your Wi-Fi.
BT’s system falls midway
between the two in price,
but it benefits greatly
from the extra unit in its
starter pack. Having three
units, rather than two,
creates a stronger signal
across your house,
especially if you want
broader coverage rather
than a point-to-point
solution. It’s remarkably
easy to set up and provides
strong wireless coverage
across a whole property.
Netgear Orbi, £369
bit.ly/orbi419
Devolo GigaGate, £219.99
bit.ly/giga419
the system creates its own
separate wireless network,
leaving your original wireless
router’s active. If you want to
make sure your devices are
connecting automatically to
the new network and not your
old, inferior one, you’ll either
have to disable wireless
completely on that router or
go around deleting the old
network from your devices.
The app is very easy to use
and we particularly like the
Pause button, which lets you
temporarily shut down Wi-Fi
across the entire household.
This is a handy tool for
parents who find it a
challenge to get their children
to put down their devices.
Performance
The BT system’s performance
is stellar across the board. We
tested it in a home previously
serviced by a Sky Q wireless
mesh network and there was
no contest – the Whole Home
Wi-Fi outclassed it both in
range and throughput speed.
Our test house has its
broadband connection
coming in on the first floor
at the front of the property,
which is where we carried out
our first, close-range test.
Using an Apple MacBook
Pro 15 equipped with a
3x3 stream Broadcom Wi-Fi
adapter, we saw an average
throughput of 89MB/s.
That’s up there with the
best standalone routers we’ve
tested, faster than the BT
Smart Hub and more than
twice as speedy as the Sky Q
Hub, which itself is no slouch.
Next, we moved down one
flight of stairs to the kitchen
at the rear of the house. In
setting up the system, we
tried to replicate as closely
as possible the positions of
the various Sky Q access
points and booster boxes in
the original network. We only
tweaked the positions slightly
on the advice of the BT
Whole Home Wi-Fi app.
We would normally see
throughput speeds of around
8MB/s on the Sky Q network
in the kitchen, but the BT
Whole Home Wi-Fi system
flew past it with an average
throughput of 36MB/s.
That’s easily strong enough
to stream 4K Netflix via
a Chromecast Ultra, and is
double the speed mustered
by a BT Smart Hub in the
same position.
Moving to a second-floor
bedroom immediately above
the primary Whole Home disc
provided even more
impressive results. Here, we
saw an average throughput
of 67MB/s. The slowest
throughput speeds were in
the study at the rear of the
house (25MB/s) and the living
room at the front of the
house, immediately below
the primary Whole Home
Wi-Fi disc (22MB/s).
Your numbers won’t be the
same as ours, of course –
every house is different – but
what’s promising about the
performance of the BT system
is that even in the trickiest
spots in our test house, we
were getting a strong signal
and decent throughput.

battery into the P2’s metal
body (most current phone
batteries are around
3,000mAh), but this doesn’t
make it bulky. It feels a little
fatter than super-svelte
models such as the Galaxy S7
Edge, but at 8.5mm thick
and 177g it’s only 0.6mm
thicker and 20g heavier than
the Samsung.
A fingerprint reader sits
below the screen, with
a volume rocker and power
button on the right-hand
edge, and a dual SIM slot and
battery-saving switch on the
left. Flick the switch up and
your P2 enters Ultimate
Power Saver mode, turning
off data and disabling apps. It
could be a handy last-minute
option but given the already
impressive battery life, it’s
unlikely to see much use.
The full-HD, 5.5in AMOLED
screen is capable of
displaying an impressive
99.9% of the sRGB colour
standard. As with all AMOLED
displays, the contrast ratio
is near-perfect. The screen’s
only sticking point is its peak
brightness, which sits at a
lowly 326cd/m2 (candles per
square metre). While that’s
fine for gloomier winter days,
you’ll be squinting at it if the
sun comes out.
For its £200 price, the P2
is a surprisingly nippy
performer. In Geekbench
tests, it’s faster than the Moto
G4 and almost as fast as the
Honor 6X. It also performed
well in our gaming tests.

requiring you to navigate
through menus. The plus side
to this is that there are lots
of options to configure,
including ISO and white

The final and relatively
minor drawback is that there’s
no Android 7 Nougat here;
the phone is currently stuck
on Android 6 Marshmallow,
which feels a little dated in
comparison. We’ve been told
that an over-the-air update
is coming in the very near
future, though.

That’s a full five hours longer
than our previous winner,
Motorola’s Moto Z Play.
Anecdotally, after a heavy
weekend’s sightseeing filled
with Google Maps, selfies
and the odd game of Mini
Metro, the P2 never dipped
below 70%.

Like the latest versions of AVG and
Avast, Adaware will detect if you
already have an antivirus program on
your PC and install itself in Compatible
mode if you do. This will provide you
with a reliable second line of defence
that won’t clash with your existing
security software.
Adaware has been protecting
computers from spyware and other
threats since 1999 and, over the years,
it’s developed into a full-blown anti-
malware solution. The latest version has
undergone a comprehensive redesign,
with a brand-new look and feel that
could win back many former users.
The first thing you’ll notice is the
streamlined installer, which is only
a couple of megabytes to download.
The full installation still takes quite
a long time to complete, but you can
just run it in the background and get on
with other tasks in the meantime.
The new interface sports a smarter
white, green and orange colour scheme,
with a grey strip down the left-hand side
that provides access to all the software’s

Artweaver Free can be used to create works

including magic wand, lasso, text tool,
gradient and clone stamp. There’s also a
massive selection of art brushes sorted into
various categories including acrylics,
airbrushes, chalk, charcoal, crayons, oils,
pastels and pencils. The latest version of
Artweaver adds support for high-resolution
screens and has a new toolbar that provides
quick access to common commands.
Selecting the brush you want has been made

Windows 10 Creators Update, Iris intelligently

will use your location and time of day to adjust
the settings accordingly.
You can also switch to manual mode, which
uses the night-time settings exclusively;
or pause Iris, which is useful if you want to
carry out colour-sensitive work such as editing
photos. You can also switch between various
pre-set colour types, including Health, Sleep,
Reading and Movie.
Windows comes with a built-in partitioning tool
for dividing a hard drive into separate sections,
but Partition Wizard Free is a more powerful
alternative that lets you create, delete, wipe,
copy, resize and move partitions; clone disks;
convert disk types and file systems; recover
partitions and master boot records; and more.
The latest version improves how it works on
high-resolution screens and introduces more
options for different drive formats. It can copy
an entire system drive, or just a required system
partition, and convert a system drive from MBR
to GPT and vice versa. If you require additional
features, you can upgrade to a paid-for version
from $39 (about £32).

Pressing F11 to switch Chrome
to full-screen mode gives you
a much clearer view of a web

lose access to the tab bar
along the top of the browser.
This makes it trickier to move

which web pages are open.
Happily, help is at hand from a new
Chrome extension called Tab Revolution

you just click the ‘Add to’ button below the title of a clip

However, the process is time-consuming and requires
a fair amount of clicking, and you can only use the playlist
function if you’re signed into YouTube.
TubeLister (bit.ly/tube419) saves you time, hassle and
memory by streamlining the process. When you click the
add-on’s toolbar button, it automatically generates
a playlist from all your open tabs that contain YouTube
videos and combines them into a single tab. This means
you can right-click anything you want to watch and choose
‘Open in new tab’, then let TubeLister take care of the
playlist creation.
The order in which the videos are compiled follows the
order of tabs from left to right, but you can shuffle the clips
to suit your preference.

or are exploiting it. However, it would be wise to change your password on sites

Try two new Firefox
experiments
Last summer, Mozilla relaunched its
Firefox Test Pilot site (testpilot.firefox
.com) to let users try experimental new
features without having to install
the less stable developer build of the
browser. It has now added two new
experiments to gauge users’ feedback
and decide whether to include them
in future versions of Firefox.
The first of these, Snooze Tabs,
prevents idle tabs from distracting you
and wasting
memory. Instead,
you can put tabs
‘to sleep’ until
later, by clicking
the snooze icon
and setting an
‘alarm’ to reopen
them when you
need them. This
could be later
today, at the weekend, next month
or the precise date and time of your
choice. Snooze Tabs is very easy to use
and you can restore tabs early or cancel
their alarms in a couple of clicks.
The second new experiment, Pulse,
is mainly of benefit to Mozilla. It lets
you rate your experience on different
websites so that Firefox developers can
see which sites work well in the browser
and which don’t. You can also leave
Load pages faster
in Opera 43
Opera is constantly
being tweaked to make it
speedier and smarter, and a new
feature in version 43 of the
browser takes this a step further.
Called ‘instant page loading’,
it predicts which website you’re
typing the address for and loads
it in the background before
you’ve even pressed Enter.
Additionally, when you search
for something via Opera’s
address bar, it will load the
results you’re likely to click in the
background. The downside is
that if Opera guesses wrong,
it wastes
memory
loading
pages
you
won’t
visit. You
can turn
off the feature by going to
Settings, ‘Privacy & security’
and deselecting the options
‘Use a prediction service...’ and
‘Predict network actions to
improve performance’.
Block more adverts
in Edge
Considering the paucity
of extensions for Microsoft Edge,
there are a lot of ad blockers for
the browser. Along with Adblock
Plus, uBlock Origin and AdBlock,
there’s now Adguard AdBlocker
(bit.ly/adguard419). As with its
versions for
Chrome and
Firefox, this
provides
impressive
control over
what you
block online, be it every ad, only
ads on certain sites, irritating
elements other than ads,
social-media buttons and even
ads within software. Turn to our
cover feature on page 38 to find
out how to block Microsoft’s own
annoying ads in Windows 10.
OTHER BROWSERS
This fortnight’s most useful tips and add-ons to help you get the
most from Chrome, Firefox, Opera and more
comments
and report
a site as
being
particularly
fast or not displaying correctly.
Both experiments can be installed
alongside the Test Pilot add-on (if you
don’t already have it) and disabled
via the Add-ons Manager, if you
decide you don’t like them.
Browse the web in the
dark
Whether you want to protect your
eyes when browsing at night or you’re
trying to stop nosy parkers gawking
at your screen, there are many
advantages to applying a dark theme
in Firefox. Dark Mode (bit.ly/dark419)
is a new WebExtension (as opposed
to old-fashioned add-on), which does
just that, letting you darken white
backgrounds and lighten black text
at the click of a button. You can
whitelist specific sites to stop them
going dark, try special dark themes
for your favourite sites and choose
from various styles.

App of the Fortnight
CUSTOMISATION
Evie Launcher
evie.com
4.4
Your Android launcher is
your most visible app of
all, but you’d be forgiven
for not even knowing it’s
there. It’s your device’s
front door, responsible
for getting you to your
installed apps quickly
and easily. Android’s
default launcher is
currently Google Now
(about to be replaced by
Google Assistant), but
you’re free to switch to
a third-party launcher
if you want, and Evie
is an excellent choice.
Evie 2.0 is faster and
less data-hungry than any other launcher we’ve used,
and its appearance is streamlined to suit. The new version
doesn’t have an All Apps button at all – just swipe up to see
all your installed apps, with new additions at the top.
Evie’s biggest advantage over Google Now is its universal
search tool. It looks for anything – on your device, in
Google Play and in your local area, as well as on the web.
We typed ‘doc’ and got results that included Google Docs,
our doctor’s phone number and directions to Docklands.
Broader results open a screen of ‘cards’ offering further
actions. Cards for our ‘documentary movies’ result, for
example, included IMDb pages and YouTube videos. It’s not
perfect – Evie can’t find
individual albums in Gallery
– but it’s quick and seamless.
Potentially, you needn’t pin
apps to your home screen
at all – just search for them.
But if you’re wedded to your
shortcuts, Evie can do
wonders with those, too,
with the new version adding
support for a Google
Now-style dock, iOS-style
folders and app icon badges.
Evie also now lets you save
your home-screen settings
to the cloud,
which is very
handy if you’re
about to buy
a new phone.

edit videos, play games, run antivirus scans and
much more, and the latest version adds powerful
file-transfer tools. You can connect
using Wi-Fi or mobile internet,
with bank-level encryption to keep

You will need to install the

on chosen routes and dates – and even
predicting when the best prices will
appear. However, it previously didn’t

so a fare could quickly look like less

selecting seats, checking baggage and
so on. That oversight has now been
fixed and Hopper’s new

exactly how much you’ll

Cipher Chat

4.1
You can send anonymous messages
using this new app from the maker
of file-hiding tool Hide It Pro
(hideitpro.com). Unlike the best-
known private messaging app, Signal
(whispersystems.org), Cipher lets
you sign up and send messages
without handing over any personal
information at all – you can be Basil
Brush if you want. You then message people by searching
for their username. Notifications are disguised as device error
messages, and you can share photos and other
files privately. The catch is that messages aren’t

but you may not mind, given that you’re

inspired to visit Scotland (or explore it, if you already live
there) after your virtual trip. If you don’t have

360-degree videos, which also include tours
of Edinburgh Castle and the glory of the

This running game – a spin-off from
the Cartoon Network series Justice

thrilling thing to hit your phone this
year. Handpick your team of heroes

in its name, which makes it feel more

game blends fiendish puzzles with
gory graphics and a scary soundtrack
to create a suitably foreboding and
claustrophobic atmosphere. It’s not
for the squeamish, with eyeballs in
jars, blood on the walls and nasty-
looking implements, but it’s only a
game and if you die you
can just start again. Be
warned that the file size
is so large it requires
Wi-Fi to download.

Best New Mobile Games

36 22 March - 4 April 2017
This year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona showcases nostalgic
reinvention, cutting-edge 5G technology and more. David Crookes
rounds up the best new gadgets from the event
MWC 2017’s best devices
Nokia 3310
bit.ly/nokia419
Why is it interesting?
Before the advent of the smartphone, the
Nokia 3310 was king of the candybars.
Although it had a monochrome display,
hard keys and no online access or apps,
it was near-indestructible and its battery
lasted ages between charges. Little
wonder, then, that Nokia is attempting
to revive its ailing fortunes by bringing
out a new version which,
perhaps confusingly,
retains the same name.
This time around, the
slimmer handset has
a 2.4in curved, colour
screen and the design
has been tweaked to
accentuate the
rounded body. It
comes in four colours –
glossy red or yellow
and matte dark blue
or grey – and uses
a familiar, albeit
updated, user interface
along with (wait for it!)
the classic game Snake.
It is, in some respects,
a trade-off phone. What you lose in its
rather basic 2-megapixel camera and 2G
rather than 3G technology, you gain in
microUSB charging and a standby time
of an entire month (or 22 hours of talk
time if you’re feeling chatty). There’s also
an FM radio and MP3 player, and up to
32GB of storage via the microSD slot.
When’s it out?
Around April (Nokia says the second
quarter of 2017).
How much will it cost?
Nokia is advertising it at ¤49 (around
£41), and Carphone Warehouse is taking
pre-orders at bit.ly/carphone419). Nokia
has also launched three other phones –
the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 – the
latter at the top end of the range. All
three run Android but offer different
display quality, memory and cameras.
Do I really need it?
Nokia says the new 3310 is aimed at
anyone heading to a festival or wanting
a second phone with a long-lasting
battery charge. Our main complaint is
that there’s no messaging tool, such as
WhatsApp, included on the device.
BlackBerry KEYone
www.blackberrymobile.com
Why is it interesting?
BlackBerry is another once-popular
mobile manufacturer that’s trying to turn
back the clock to a time before it became
overshadowed by Apple and Samsung.
KEYone runs Android 7 Nougat, grants
access to Google Play and has a 4.5in
touchscreen and an auto-focusing
12-megapixel camera. But its main
attraction is a physical Qwerty keyboard
for people who don’t like using
touchscreens. The keys
double as a touchpad and
there’s a fingerprint sensor
on the Spacebar, too.
When’s it out?
Deliveries are expected
from April.
How much will it cost?
It’s yours for £499.
Do I really need it?
As well as a keyboard,
BlackBerry offers top-
security encryption.
It also has a large
3,505mAh battery that
should last all day without
needing to be charged.

technology. As such, it’s the world’s
fastest phone, capable of download
speeds of 1Gbps. This allows it to stream
virtual reality in ultra-HD and have
a movie ready
to watch in next
to no time. The
catch is that
this handset,
despite packing
a Qualcomm
Snapdragon
835 processor,
is still only
a prototype
at the moment.
When’s it
out?
Not any time
soon, so don’t hold your breath.
How much will it cost?
There’s no info on this yet.
Do I really need it?
Yes, in time, but you’ll have to wait.
Journalists attending the MWC weren’t
even allowed to touch the device!
Sony Xperia Ear
Open-style Concept
bit.ly/sony419
Why is it interesting?
Just as Apple has tried to reinvent the
earphone with its Earpods, Sony is after
your aural attention with its updated
Xperia Ear. By inserting these new buds,
you can listen to music or interact with
Sony’s personal digital assistant, Xperia
Agent, while still allowing exterior noise
to penetrate your lugholes. So, for
example, you can get directions but still
interact with the outside world. Rather
handy when crossing a road, we think.
How much will it cost?
The earphones are still being worked on
so price details are yet to be announced.
When’s it out?
They have to work themselves out of the
concept stage first.
Do I really need it?
You may want to try the existing Xperia
Ear first. If you like the idea of having
something like Siri or Alexa whispering
in your ear when you need information,
there’s a good chance you’ll love it.
LG G6
www.lg.com
Why is it interesting?
Displays on conventional mobile phones
offer a 16:9 aspect ratio but LG’s new
5.7in device not only has a screen that
takes up most of the phone’s front
(FullVision, as it calls it), but also uses the
18:9 format, which grants it more viewing
space. Despite the larger size of the
2,800 x 1,400 pixel display, the phone
can still be held
in one hand. It is
also the first
phone to have
Dolby Vision and
it supports
HDR 10, too.
When’s it out?
There’s no
confirmation for
the UK as yet but
it’s out now in
South Korea.
How much will
it cost?
Again, LG hasn’t
yet revealed a price for the UK.
Do I really need it?
It’s certainly worth considering because
this unique and feature-packed Android
phone is also water- and dust-resistant.
Plus, you get Google Assistant built in.
Alcatel A5 LED
www.alcatel-mobile.com
Why is it interesting?
Alcatel certainly caught everyone’s
attention at MWC by creating the first
phone with an interactive removable
LED cover. As well as performing a light
show to accompany your music,
it illuminates whenever you get
a notification, using different colours for
incoming calls, messages, alarms and
social-media alerts. It also uses a feature
called Color Catcher 2.0, which cleverly
absorbs as many as five colours from
an object or image to produce
a unique cover pattern and theme.
When’s it out?
It is due to be released in May.
How much will it cost?
Alcatel says it will sell
for ¤199 (around
£170).
Do I really
need it?
The A5 has
a 1,280 x 720
HD display
but it uses
an Octa-Core
1.5GHz
processor,
only has an
8-megapixel
rear camera
with dual-tone
flash and runs Android
6.0 Marshmallow. That
said, no mid-priced phone
we’ve seen is this eye-catching.
Oppo 5X
www.oppo.com/en
Why is it interesting?
When you take photos on your phone,
the camera’s zoom tends to degrade the
image if you go in too far. Oppo’s new
5X Dual Camera Zoom technology solves
this problem by letting you get five times
closer without distortion. As the name
of the feature suggests, there are two
lenses – with the telephoto lens angled
by 90 degrees. The patented idea was
apparently inspired by a submarine’s
periscope, allowing enough space for
a deep zoom while still keeping the
phone’s slim design.
When’s it out?
It’s still in the prototype stage and it may
not even make our shores.
How much will it cost?
It’s too early to say.
Do I really need it?
If you love to take photos on your phone,
then yes. Amateur photographers have
been hankering after this kind of lossless
zooming for years.

Tired of Microsoft’s constant nags and notifications?
Wayne Williams reveals how to remove annoying
adverts and pop-ups from Windows 10, so you can
use your PC in peace
W
indows 10 is more than just an operating system
– it’s also an advertising platform. Ever since the
software was released, Microsoft has found more
and more ways to sneak ‘suggestions’, tips, promotions,
nags and other adverts onto your screen, whether you like
it or not. With the forthcoming Creators Update set to
bring even more ads to Windows 10, we’ve decided
enough is enough. In this cover feature, we explain how
to banish these annoyances from the operating system
and prevent them from reappearing.
Over the following six pages, we explain how you can
remove ads from the Start menu, Lock screen and
Windows 10 apps, and do away with pop-up promotions
for Microsoft products. We also reveal how to block
the next generation of unwanted advertising, which is
heading your way in the Windows 10 Creators Update,
and show you how to stop pop-up ads from third-party
security software.
It’s important to note that Windows 10 is undergoing
continual development, so new adverts we haven’t
covered here might appear in the future, while existing
adverts might be dropped (we can but hope!).

Ads for Microsoft’s
Chrome extensions
At the beginning of the year,
Microsoft tested pop-up ads in
Windows 10 for its Personal
Shopping Assistant extension
for Chrome (bit.ly/
personal419). Anyone with
Chrome installed was greeted
with a message above the
browser’s taskbar icon stating:
‘Quickly compare prices online.
Get Microsoft’s Personal Shopping
Assistant for Chrome’.
As you can imagine, Windows 10
users weren’t overjoyed about this
intrusion and Personal Shopping
Assistant received a slew of one-star
reviews in the Chrome web store.
Not for the quality of the extension,
which is perfectly fine, but in protest of
Microsoft foisting it on them in this way.
In response to the negativity
surrounding the ad, Microsoft stated:
“We are always testing new features
and information that can help people
enhance their Windows 10 experience”,
but gave no indication that it would
drop adverts for Chrome
extensions in future.
To kill this particular type of
ad, go to Settings, System,
‘Notifications & actions’ and
disable the ‘Get tips, tricks and
suggestions’ option.
Anti-Chrome
ads promoting Edge
If you use Google’s browser on
your laptop, you may have seen
pop-ups extolling the benefits
of Microsoft Edge over Chrome
HIDE ADS FOR MICROSOFT PRODUCTS
appearing just above your taskbar.
In particular, Microsoft informs you that
Chrome will (allegedly) drain the battery
of a Windows laptop or tablet much
faster than if you were using Edge.
These annoying promotional
messages, which appear when you
launch Chrome on your device, are part
of Microsoft’s ‘tips’ feature. As explained
in our opening tip, you can stop them
appearing by disabling the option to
‘Get tips, tricks, and suggestions as you
use Windows’.
Stop Cortana nagging you
Microsoft really – and we mean really
– wants you to use Cortana, and to
make sure you don’t forget that the
feature exists, the personal assistant
occasionally springs to life to dispense
thoughts, greetings and notifications
through the Search box.
Microsoft’s deceptive
Windows 10 ‘tips’
You might think that Microsoft’s offer to
serve up ‘tips, tricks and suggestions’ as
you use Windows 10 would result in
plenty of helpful advice about getting
the most from the operating system.
In fact, that feature is just a way for
Microsoft to bombard you with
advertising for its apps and services.
If we say so ourselves, you’ll learn
way more about how to master
Windows 10 from reading Web User
than you will from any of Microsoft’s
‘tips’. Thankfully, it’s easy enough to
disable them. Go to Settings, System,
‘Notifications & Actions’ and disable
the ‘Get tips, tricks, and suggestions
as you use Windows’ option.
Lock-screen promotions
The Windows 10 Lock screen is
a prime place for Microsoft to display
advertising because it appears
automatically when your PC is idle.
In the past, it has used this canvas to
push promotions for Windows Store
games including ‘Rise of the Tomb
Raider’ and Quantum Break.
To disable these ads, go to
Personalisation, Lock Screen and make
sure you have either Picture or
Slideshow selected, rather than
Windows Spotlight. Set ‘Get fun facts,
tips, and more from Windows and
Cortana on your lock screen’ to Off.
Microsoft’s ‘Get
Office’ nag
Windows 10 will nag you to
get Office 365, even if you
already have it installed –
which makes the pop-up ad
even more annoying.
To silence this irritation.
go to Settings, System,
‘Notifications & actions’.
Under ‘Show notifications
from these apps’, locate
Get Office in the list and
toggle its button to Off.
An even more decisive
option is to uninstall the
offending Get Office app completely.
Click Start and scroll down the All
Apps list to the letter G, where you

If you don’t use Cortana, and don’t want
to be bothered by it, you can disable
this annoyance. Select Cortana in the
search bar and click the Settings cog on
the left. Scroll down to ‘Taskbar Titbits’
and disable that option. Once you’ve
done that, you won’t hear from Cortana
again until you want to.
Avoid ads in Minesweeper
and Solitaire
The classic games Minesweeper and
Solitaire have been included in Windows
for many years but in Windows 10,
Microsoft controversially inserted ads
into both apps. You’re now forced to
tolerate banner ads and watch
30-second full-screen ads to keep
playing the games, or else upgrade to a
paid-for subscription to get rid of them.
Each game charges a subscription of
£1.49 per month, or £11.59 for the year,
so if you want both Minesweeper (which
you’ll need to install as it doesn’t come
with Windows 10) and Solitaire, you’ll be
expected to pay £23.18 a year for two
games that used to be entirely free –
which is a bit of a cheek!
The best way to enjoy these games
without ads, and without paying a
penny, is to install the original Windows
7 versions. You can find instructions and
links to both games on Winaero (bit.ly/
wingames419).
If you’d rather not install anything,
you can play web-based versions of the
games, such as Play Solitaire (www
.playsolitaire.org) and Free Minesweeper
(www.freeminesweeper.org).
REMOVE ADS FROM MICROSOFT PARTNERS
Remove suggestions
in the Start menu
Windows users are more likely to install
traditional programs from the web than
download apps, which means there are
far fewer quality apps and games in the
Windows Store than offered by the
Apple App Store and Google Play.
Microsoft is trying to change this
behaviour so it can increase its user
base and encourage more developers to
write apps for its operating system.
One ways it’s hoping to achieve this is
by promoting apps in various areas of
the OS, such as in the Start menu.
Microsoft is keen to stress that these
aren’t really advertisements because no
money has changed hands – it’s simply
trying to help you find good apps based
on your interests and Windows Store
history. If you find these suggestions
useful, that’s great, but if you feel like
this is an underhand way for Microsoft
to push its wares, then it’s easy enough
to remove them.
There are two types of suggestions in
the Start menu. The first appear in the
‘All apps’ list on the left, under a
Suggested heading. They often have a
star rating, which makes them easier to
spot. Right-click one and you’ll be
presented with two options – ‘Don’t
show this suggestion’, which hides that
particular app; and ‘Turn off all
suggestions’, which also removes all
future suggested apps. Alternatively,
you can go to Settings, Personalisation,
Start and toggle off the option
‘Occasionally show suggestions in Start’.
The other area of the Start menu that
Microsoft uses to promote apps is in the
tiled section. When Windows 10 first
launched, it included five ‘suggested
apps’ tiles by default; in the Anniversary
Update, this was increased to 10.
Tiles for unwanted pre-installed apps,
such as Get Office, can be right-clicked
and uninstalled. There’s no uninstall
option for promoted apps because they
simply point to the Windows Store, so
just select the option to ‘Unpin from
Start’ to banish them for good (or until
the next big Windows update, at least).
Another way to stop promoted apps
appearing in the Start menu is to
replace Windows 10’s built-in menu
with a third party one, such as the
excellent (and free) Classic Shell (www
.classicshell.net). This offers a choice of
three different menu styles – Classic,
Two Columns and Windows 7 – all of
which can be customised to suit your
tastes and needs. Replacing the current
menu with a different one just to avoid
adverts is a little over the top, but if you
prefer the Windows 7 Start-menu style
to the tiled Windows 10 version, then it’s
definitely worth considering. The
program is updated regularly so it will
always be compatible with the latest
version of Windows 10, including the
Creators Update.
Uninstall promotional apps
Windows 10 comes with a selection of
pre-installed promotional apps. These
include Get Office, Phone Companion
and Candy Crush. We’ve already looked
at how to uninstall these unwanted apps
directly through the Start menu, but if
Stop Microsoft displaying app suggestions
in your Start menu

Microsoft isn’t alone in bombarding users with adverts in
Windows 10 – security companies do it, too (and also in
Windows 7 and 8). For example, Avast now has a habit of
displaying pop-up notifications to encourage you to buy
its other products or address ‘problems’ it’s detected on
your PC. You can block these pop-ups by going to
Settings, General and ticking
the box for Silent Mode. With
Silent Mode switched on, no
messages or alerts will be
displayed. You can also alter
the duration of Info, Update,
Warning and Alert messages
under Popups (including
setting some or all to
0 seconds), although you
can’t disable the feature
entirely in the free version.
AVG was recently acquired
by Avast, so its settings are
now much the same in the
latest version of the software.
You can enable Silent Mode in the Settings screen or
change the length of pop-ups as described previously.
Some Avast users have reported seeing ‘upgrade’
pop-up ads for the antivirus program, even after
uninstalling it (in some cases, months after removing it).
If this is a problem you’ve encountered, go to:
C:\Program Files\Common
Files\AV\avast! Antivirus
and delete the Upgrade.exe
file. When uninstalling an
antivirus program, it’s worth
using a dedicated tool like IObit
Uninstaller (bit.ly/uninst419),
rather than the Windows
uninstaller, to remove any junk
that’s been left behind. You can
also find official uninstallers for
the main security tools that
perform a more thorough
cleanup. These can often be
found in the support section of
the publisher’s website.

this setting at the very bottom of
the Windows Ink Workspace.
Annoying ads within apps
Lots of free apps (and, it must be
said, even some paid-for apps)
display ads. Advertising is used to
help fund the continuing
development of the software, so
sometimes you just have to accept
them as a necessary evil.
If an app you like is scarred by
horrible, intrusive adverts, you may
be able to banish them by
upgrading to a paid-for version.
If that option isn’t available, you
could consider using Adguard
(adguard.com). This powerful
program not only blocks ads on the
web, but can also filter them out of
applications. When you install
Adguard, you’ll be able to choose
which blocking features you want
to include. It’s free for 14 days, after
which it costs $19.95 (£16.42)
per year. You can use it for free
indefinitely by signing up to be
an Asguard tester (bit.ly/
asguardbeta419).
See our Mini Workshop on the left
to find out how to use Adguard.

1
Run Adguard (adguard.com) and hover
your mouse over the Ad Blocker tile in the
menu. Click Settings, then select Filtered
Apps from the sidebar on the left. 1 The
main panel will display a list of browsers and
other apps that can be filtered. 2 Some, such
as Edge, 3 can’t be blocked by default.
2
If the app you want to remove ads from
isn’t listed, scroll down to the bottom and
select ‘Add Application’. 1 Browse the list of
installed apps to find the one you’re after,
then click ‘Add selected’. You can also choose
to ‘Browse for executable’ 2 if you use the

Apps are usually filtered using the TDI
(Transport Driver Interface) driver but this
won’t work with some apps, such as Edge.
To filter ads from these stubborn apps, click
General Settings 1 and tick ‘Use WFP
network driver’, 2 then reboot your PC. WFP
(Windows Filtering Platform) allows Adguard
to strip ads from Windows apps.
Ads on Edge’s new-tab page
Microsoft Edge’s new-tab page
includes a couple of different types
of ads. At the top, under the search/
address bar, you’ll find a list of ‘Top
sites’. Most of these aren’t websites
at all and, by default, of the eight
tiles listed, only three will take you
to a site when clicked. The others
include a sponsored link to the
Windows Store and four apps that
you can open or install. To clear
unwanted entries, right-click a tile
and select Remove. Repeat the
process for the others.
Next, scroll down to ‘My feed’
where you’ll see lots of stories from
other sites, powered by MSN.
Sponsored content is scattered
throughout, including links to apps
in the Windows Store and regular
ads for junk such as PPI claims. You
can’t remove each one individually,
but you can turn off the page. Click
the ellipses (…) and open Settings.
Under ‘Open Microsoft Edge with’,
change ‘Start page’ to something
else. Also change ‘Open new tabs
with’ from ‘Top sites and suggested
content’ to ‘A blank page’.
Of course, the best way to avoid
ads in your browser is to switch
from Edge to an ad-free browser
such as Chrome or Firefox, but we’ll
leave that decision in your hands!

Promoted apps in Share
The Creators Update will introduce a
wealth of new features to Windows 10,
and this unfortunately includes yet more
advertising annoyances. Microsoft is
planning to promote apps in even more
locations around the OS, such as in the
updated Share tool. This works like the
Share feature found in mobile operating
systems such as Android and iOS, and
lets you easily share media with friends
and followers. In some earlier Insider

were offered as a download in the list of
sharing options, while more widely used
services, such as Google Drive and
Dropbox, weren’t listed. The newest

with promoting Box and Line in this way,
but Share is now pushing Facebook

Cortana’s new pop-up
reminders
Microsoft is adding more features
and functionality to its personal
assistant Cortana in the Creators
Update, and one in particular –
pop-up alerts – is likely to get on
some people’s nerves. These alerts
are designed to remind you about
things you’ve said you’ll do, but –
rather creepily – Cortana doesn’t
require you to select anything to set
them. Instead, the nosy assistant
monitors your email looking for
potential tasks: if there’s a deadline
mentioned, it will ping you nearer
the time and store the reminder in
the Action Centre. Other reminders
are stored in Cortana’s home.
Fortunately, the feature is currently
only available in the US, and currently
only supports Outlook.com and Office
365 work and school email addresses,
but Microsoft has plans to bring the
feature to the UK and introduce
support for all major email services.
You can disable this feature (when
it arrives) by opening Cortana and
clicking the Notebook icon on the

‘Contacts, email, calendar, &
communication history’. Also, make
sure your email service isn’t included

What we liked:
In most respects,
oCam’s free
screen-capture
software is the
bee’s knees. The
interface provides
a simple bank of buttons,
which makes activating the various
tasks straightforward. Just click
the Record button to start
the software
capturing whatever
is happening on
your PC’s screen.
By default, this will
be a rectangular
space, marked out
by a green box,
which you can
resize using the
square handles.
Alternatively, you
can click the Resize
button to choose from a range of
alternative presets. While you’re at it,
click the Codecs button to choose how
you would like the video saved – most
of the other programs we tested only
output a single type, but oCam offers a
range of alternatives.
So far, so straightforward: but it’s
deep in the settings that the magic
appears. Here,
you’ll uncover
gems such as
the ability to
record sound
from both
Windows and
your microphone
simultaneously;
and superimpose your webcam video
over the video you’re recording, so you
can enhance your ‘how-to’ videos with
some personality.
The best thing is that it all comes for
free, with unlimited recording time and
no annoyances (such as watermarks),
as long as you’re not using the software
for commercial purposes.
How it can be improved:
The panel of buttons
containing oCam’s tools
only takes up a few
centimetres of screen space,
but it is attached to an
annoying browser window
which makes the interface
ugly, oversized and intrusive.
It also has the worst
documentation we’ve seen
for a long time although
thankfully, you won’t need
it because the software
is surprisingly easy to use
without it. Finally, a pair of nag screens
appear when you close the software,
which seems pointless when you’re
legitimately using it for free.
OUR VERDICT
There are some annoying and
intrusive elements to oCam’s
interface, but the benefits far
outweigh these niggles. Most of the
other programs we tested have
restrictions but oCam has none,
so you can record for as long as you
like, in any format. It also has some
great extras, including multi-channel
audio and picture-in-picture video.

TAB MANAGER
If you open the Task Manager and sort
your PC’s processes by the amount of
memory they’re using, Google Chrome
is likely to be at the top of the list – even
when it’s not open! The easiest way to
keep the browser from using too much
memory and slowing your PC to a crawl
is to ensure you don’t leave too many
tabs open, and the excellent tab-
management extension Toby (gettoby
.com) makes this easier than ever.
Toby opens in Chrome every time
you open a new tab, displaying a clear
overview of your current tabs, which
is very useful when you have so many
open that they’re difficult to see. It also
lets you close tabs and save them for
viewing later, allowing you to manage
your saved tabs as ‘lists’, so that they’re
easy to find.
If you find you still leave too many
tabs open, try Tabs Limiter with Queue
(bit.ly/tablimiter419). As its name
suggests, this handy add-on only lets
you have a set number of tabs open
(you set this number) at one time. If you
try to open more, it queues them in
a simple list until you close some.
See our Workshop in issue 401 (bit.ly/
webuser401) for more information
on using this extension.
Firefox’s Tab Groups was a built-in
feature that helped with managing open
tabs, but it was discontinued last year
in version 45 of the browser. You can
reinstate it by installing the Tab Groups
add-on (bit.ly/tabgroups419), which
uses the same source code as the
original feature, so it should work
in exactly the same way.
If you want to add more options to
your tabs, try the ever-impressive Tab
Mix Plus (bit.ly/tabmix419), which has
a range of invaluable features including
letting you duplicate a tab (along with
its Back and Forward history) and

try Norwell (bit.ly/norwell419), which
offers a similar solution to this problem.
EXTENSIONS MANAGER
If you find Chrome’s extensions
manager too simplistic, try NooBoss
(bit.ly/noob419) instead. It displays all
your installed add-ons in a pop-up
panel, so you don’t need to navigate
to chrome://extensions every time you
want to disable or re-enable an add-on,
and lets you quickly filter entries by
typing a letter or two. It also provides
an at-a-glance display showing which
of your extensions are active. You can
choose to receive Desktop notifications
when your extensions are updated,
and quickly enable or disable all of them
with a single click.
Best of all, NooBoss lets you create
rules so that specific add-ons become
active only when you visit certain
websites – for example, you could set
your ad blocker to kick in on sites that
are particularly bloated with ads – which
reduces the amount of memory Chrome
uses. Note that NooBoss automatically
adds you to its community, but you can
easily opt out via its Options.
BOOKMARK MANAGER
Thanks to excellent extensions such as
Pocket (getpocket.com), which won our
round-up of read-it-later tools in issue
412 (bit.ly/webuser412), you may find
you no longer need to bookmark web
pages. But if you still rely on your
bookmarks to save interesting pages,
there are better tools for managing
them than those built into your browser.
The lightweight Firefox add-on
QuickMark (bit.ly/quickmark419),
for example, lets you bookmark and
organise sites by clicking the star icon
on the toolbar and choosing a folder (or
creating a new one). Alternatively,
there’s Auto-Sort Bookmarks (bit.ly/
autosort419), which lets you sort your
bookmarks by name, URL, last visited
and most visited; and Bookmark Tab
(bit.ly/booktab419), which lists all your
bookmarks when you open a new tab.
Chrome’s basic bookmark manager
can be replaced with Neater Bookmarks
(bit.ly/neater419), which organises all
your saved sites into one searchable
toolbar menu. If you share your browser,
you could also install Secure Bookmarks
(bit.ly/secure419) to protect your
private pages with a password.
READING VIEW
Firefox’s Reader View offers to
declutter your browsing experience,
but it has a very limited set of
customisation options. By installing
the add-on Reader (bit.ly/reader419),
you can assign any font and choose a
page theme and layout for articles you
read on the web. Another option is
to install Evernote’s Web Clipper for
Firefox (bit.ly/evernotef419), which
offers a simplified reading mode and
lets you save these versions of articles
for viewing later. It’s available for
Chrome (bit.ly/evernotec419), too –
which doesn’t have its own built-in
reading view – as is the brilliant Mercury
Reader (bit.ly/mercury419), which
removes all the unwanted clutter from
web pages with a single click, leaving
you with just the main text and images.
Edge doesn’t have the
same wide array of add-ons as
Chrome and Firefox, but that
doesn’t mean you can’t improve on
the browser’s default tools.
For starters, you can replace the
browser’s bookmarking system
by installing an add-on for our
favourite read-it-later tool, Pocket
(bit.ly/pockete419). For superior
tab management, try Microsoft’s
excellent Mouse Gestures
extension (bit.ly/mouse419), which
lets you switch to the next tab,
open a new tab and close all tabs
apart from your current one using
only movements of your mouse.

Stop Windows requiring you to run a
program as administrator
RunAsDate tricks trial software by
pretending it’s an earlier date
IObit Unlocker frees locked files from the
administrator’s grasp
48 22 March - 4 April 2017
Take back control of your downloads by unshackling
them from unreasonable constraints. Here, we explain
how to free your files forever
Remove administrator
permissions
Have you ever tried to run a program in
Windows, only to be told that you don’t
have permission to do so because you’re
not an administrator? This can be very
annoying if you’re the main user of your
PC and therefore are the administrator.
You can bypass the problem by
right-clicking a program file and
choosing ‘Run as administrator’, but to
fix the problem permanently, right-click
the program’s shortcut or EXE file and
click the Compatibility tab. In the
Privilege Level section, untick the option
‘Run this program as an administrator’
then click Apply. Now click ‘Change
settings for all users’ and deselect the
administrator option there to
completely remove the restriction.
A similar obstruction occurs when
Windows prevents you from deleting a
file or folder because the action requires
Remove unfair

TIME
LIMITS
permission from the poxy administrator.
You can beat this restriction using the
free tool IObit Unlocker (bit.ly/
unlocker419), which terminates all
related processes that prevent you from
deleting or accessing files and folders.
Simply right-click the stubborn item,
choose IObit Unlocker (or drag it to the
program window) and click Unlock, then
Unlock & Delete.
Make free software trials
last longer
When a premium program you’ve
downloaded nears the end of its trial
period, you have three options: buy a
licence to continue using it indefinitely;
uninstall it; or – if you’re feeling devious
– trick the software into letting you use
it for longer – maybe forever!
A free tool called RunAsDate
(www.nirsoft.net/utils) can help with the
latter, although its developer – the
prolific NirSoft – stresses that it’s not
guaranteed to work. To use RunAsDate,
browse to the trial program, choose
‘Relative to the current date/time’ from
the Date/Time menu and set back the
clock an appropriate number of days to
fool the software that the trial period
hasn’t expired. Click Run to open the
program with its time limit expanded –
if you run it separately, the original
restriction will apply.
Usefully, RunAsDate lets you create a
Desktop shortcut to launch the software
with the date adjusted, and has an
Immediate Mode that changes the date
automatically when the program starts.

Read ebooks on any device
You might think the ebooks you’ve
bought for your Kindle, Kobo or other
e-reader are yours to keep, but thanks
to DRM protection they can be
identified and deleted at any time by the
ebook store. There are also restrictions
on which devices you can read ebooks
on – for example, an EPUB file can’t be
read on a Kindle unless it’s converted to
MOBI or PDF format.
You can remove format and DRM
restrictions using the fantastic free
software Calibre (calibre-ebook.com),
which is available for Windows, Mac OS
and Linux, and a plugin called DeDRM
(bit.ly/dedrm419). Download the
plugin’s ZIP file and extract its contents,
then open Calibre, select Preferences,
Plug-ins and click ‘Load plug-in from
file’. Find and install the plugin file
‘DeDRM_calibre_plugin’ (ignore the
security warning), then restart Calibre.
To remove DRM from an ebook, simply
drag it to Calibre’s main window to
import and convert the file.
If you own a Kindle, there is another
step to perform: go to Preferences,
Plug-ins, File Type Plug-ins and double-
click DeDRM. Click ‘eInk Kindle Books’
and enter the serial number for your
device (without spaces), which you can
usually find on the Settings screen. You
may also need to go to Preferences,
Behaviour to set Calibre to read ebooks
in AZW and AZW3 format.
DRM can only be removed from books
you add to your Calibre library, not ones
already stored there, and can’t be
removed at all from Amazon’s new KFX
format. Also note that this advice is only
for your personal use and for books you
have purchased – sharing DRM-removed
files is illegal (see box, below).
Amazon’s free Kindle app (bit.ly/
kindle419) remains the best way to read
Kindle books on different devices.
Keep BBC programmes
forever
The BBC has generally done a great job
of making its TV and radio shows
available on as many devices as
possible, both online and offline,
through its iPlayer service. However,
many licence-paying viewers still feel
aggrieved that programmes disappear
from iPlayer 30 days after broadcast
and 30 days after you download them.
The best – in fact, only – way around
this DRM restriction is to use the
popular free tool Get iPlayer (bit.ly/
getiplayer419), which lets you download
and keep BBC shows for as long as you
want. Launch the program by choosing
Web PRV Manager in Get iPlayer’s Start
menu folder (the command-line
interface is baffling), then either browse
the list of recent programmes or search
for one to download. Select it and click
Record to begin recording in a new tab.
Once this is complete, either return to
the Web PRV Manager and click
Recordings or open the iPlayer
Recordings folder in your Start menu.
Videos are recorded in DRM-free
MP4 format.
Another way to bypass time
restrictions set by video-on-demand
services is to use a screen recorder to
capture and save what’s playing on your
screen. See our feature on page 44 to
find the best free tools for this.
IS IT LEGAL TO REMOVE DRM?
encouraging you to engage in copyright
infringement. This is about removing the
digital-rights management (DRM)
copy-protection from music that you’ve
already paid for (and therefore own) so
you can play the tracks on any device.
Apple actually stopped using DRM in
iTunes in 2009, but if you still have
songs you bought from its store in AAC
format, which can only be played on
Apple devices, it’s easy to set the music
free. Simply open iTunes, select
Preferences, then Store and ensure the
option ‘Show iTunes in the Cloud
purchases’ is ticked. Click the cloud icon
in List view and make sure all your
purchases are present and correct.
Now, sort the list of songs by Kind
(if the Kind column isn’t there, go to
View, Show View Options and select it
there), and delete every old track listed
as ‘Protected AAC audio file’. When you
download the songs again from the
cloud, you’ll get DRM-free versions that
can be played anywhere.
Back in 2013, publishing houses Penguin and Simon & Schuster filed a lawsuit
against a distributor called Abbey House Media, which advised customers of
its soon-to-close bookstore that they could remove the DRM from their
purchases by using Calibre (see above), as a means of backing up their
ebooks and transferring them to new devices. “Many of our customers argue
that this is a legitimate use as long as this is being done for personal use of
ebooks purchased, not for piracy,” said Abbey House. But Penguin and Simon
& Schuster claimed the company was deliberately encouraging copyright
infringement. The judge in the case ruled in Abbey House’s favour because
there was no evidence of customers copying
and distributing ebooks to other people after
the DRM protection was removed, and therefore
no copyright infringement (bit.ly/copy419).
This ruling was made in the US, where
copyright laws differ but the points regarding
personal use and not sharing copyrighted
content are equally valid in the UK. The
terms of use for Amazon’s Kindle
Store specifically forbid attempts
to bypass DRM (bit.ly/terms419),
so do so at your own risk!

liqz is a privacy-focused browser
that lets you visit websites without
worrying about being tracked or
having your search history passed to
advertisers. It comes with built-in
anti-tracking and anti-phishing tools,
an ad blocker and HTTPS Everywhere,
which automatically directs you to the
secure version of any site you visit.
The company behind Cliqz recently
acquired Ghostery (www.ghostery.com),
a fantastic add-on that identifies and
blocks tracking elements such as web
bugs. It’s now bundled with Cliqz to
further safeguard your privacy on the
web. You need to install Ghostery before
you can use it, but the process is easy and
you’ll have it up and running in seconds.
Use Cliqz browser to stop snoopers
following you around the web
5
Eventually, Ghostery will be
integrated with Cliqz by default, but
for now you need to enable it. Click the
menu button 1 and select Options. Click
the Security tab 2 in the sidebar and
click the Install button for Ghostery. 3
You can also install the LastPass
password manager 4 if you like.
1
As with any browser, you use the
Cliqz address bar 1 to enter the URL
of a site you want to visit. If you enter
a search term here, possible matches
appear as you type. 2 However, we
found that this feature was biased toward
German content, so you may prefer
to disable it 3 for the time being.
2
When you visit a site that contains
trackers, Cliqz will record and block
them by default. Click the Cliqz button 1
on the right of the address bar to see
what it’s found. 2 From the panel that
opens, you can also manage the
Anti-Phishing and Prefer HTTPS tools, 3
and enable the ad blocker. 4
3
Click the Anti-Tracking tile to see a
list of the tracking tools it’s found. 1
Clicking one takes you to a screen with
more information but this is currently in
German. You can opt to make the tool
stricter (so it blocks more trackers) 2
and also clear the tracking cache. 3
Cliqz won’t share your search or browsing
history, and now comes bundled with Ghostery
4
The Cliqz panel also provides access
to the Safe Quick-Search settings, 1
where you can choose whether adult
content should be included in search
results. You can also configure the search
options 2 (including the country,
supplementary search engine and more)
and manage your browsing history. 3

Rather than replacing the Cliqz
button, Ghostery appears as a new

configure the tracker options. 2 Add any
sites you trust (to unblock their trackers)
3 and tweak any you want to increase
restrictions for. 4 You can create an
account 5 but it’s not compulsory.
7
Use Cliqz to browse the web as
usual, and Ghostery will spot any
trackers as you go. Click the ghost
icon to display details of any trackers
the add-on has found. 1 Hover your
mouse over a tracker to bring up
options to trust it on that site, block it
on that site or block it on all sites. 2
8
You can also block all trackers, 1
trust a site, restrict a site or pause
Ghostery 2 (which stops it looking for
trackers as you browse). Click the Map

ree Windows Admin Tools (FWAT) is an excellent new
program that lets you control any PC on your network
remotely. It includes Remote Task Manager, which
shows all the processes running and lets you kill them if
necessary; Software Inventory, to check the versions of
all programs installed on a PC; Remote Device Manager,
for uninstalling problematic drivers; and a Shutdown/Restart
tool to power off the remote PC when you’re finished.
There’s also a range of other handy tools for checking
startup items, Window Updates, battery level (for laptops)
and other important system information.
The tool is aimed at domain administrators but in this
Workshop, we show you how to set it up on your home
network and enjoy the program’s best features.

In order to use FWAT, we had to
disable Windows Firewall and User
Account Control, as described in
steps 2 to 5. You can test the
program with these features
enabled to see if it works for you.
Beware that using the remote PC
without these security measures in
place could leave you vulnerable,
so you should try to re-enable
them whenever possible.

Some online players, including the BBC’s, open in a
separate browser window 1 that doesn’t let you access
add-ons. You can get round this by selecting the player’s
URL from the address bar, then copying and pasting it into a
new browser tab 2 so you can see the Ears button. 3
2
For a quick and simple fix, try clicking the Bass Boost
button. 1 This increases the lower frequency levels, which
you can see represented by the purple line on the
left-hand side of the graph. 2 If you’re listening through
earbuds, this setting can give you a significantly richer sound.
3
To adjust the overall volume, click and drag the
centre line, 1 but avoid clicking the dots. 2 Move
this up to increase the volume or down to decrease
it. Be careful when doing this, though, because the
volume increases sharply and can get very loud.
4
For more sophisticated equalising, try dragging the
purple dots at each end toward the centre. 1 This moves
the entire upper and lower range. You can then adjust the
mid-range sound by dragging the individual dots to new
positions. 2
5
Once you’ve found a setting you like, you can save it.
Type a name into the Preset Name box, 1 then click the
Save Preset button. 2 The setting will appear as a button
of its own 3 to the right of the Bass Boost button. Click it to
select the settings.
6
If you open a new tab and press the Ears button, it will
apply the settings automatically. You can turn it off by
clicking Stop EQing This Tab 1 or deactivate it on any
other tab by clicking the relevant Stop EQing button – look for
the icon of the service you want. 2
Boost the sound quality of any website
J
ust because you’re listening to music over the internet,
that’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able to enjoy the
best possible sound. Ears is a Chrome add-on that brings
all the power of a sophisticated graphic equaliser to your web
browser, so you can adjust the sound settings
of anything, from YouTube to iPlayer. Ears lets
you boost the bass and volume and perform
myriad fine adjustments. Here’s how to use it.

How to...
Keep your PC perfectly
safe with sandboxing

from malicious programs, snoops and more
SANDBOXING
SOFTWARE
There are several decent sandboxing
programs to choose from:
Sandboxie

Sandboxie is the best-known
sandboxing application. It was launched
in 2004 and has been continually
updated ever since.
Sophos announced the acquisition of
Sandboxie’s parent company, Invincea,

andboxing is a method used to
prevent software from taking
control of your operating system
or making any changes to it. It works
by containing the program in a secure
and disposable section of your
computer’s hard drive or memory.
Software running in this ‘sandbox’
is allowed to read data from the hard
drive as normal, but it can’t write data
outside of the sandbox or make any
changes to Windows.
There are several benefits to
sandboxing software in this way,
such as keeping your system safe
from potential malware and
letting you try as many
programs as you like without
worrying about cluttering up
Windows or causing problems.
It’s also useful for privacy reasons:
if you sandbox your web browser,
nothing you do will be recorded on your
computer, and bookmarks, cookies,
cached pages and browsing history will
vanish when you empty or exit the
sandbox.

Time Freeze
bit.ly/tf419
Instead of cordoning off a separate area,
Toolwiz Time Freeze turns your entire
operating system into a sandbox. It
works by creating a restore point of your
system. You can then run any software
and make whatever changes you want.
When you’re finished, Time Freeze uses
the restore point to revert your system
to how it was before you started.
BitBox
bit.ly/bbox419
BitBox (Browser in the Box) is essentially
a sandboxed web browser. You can
choose from ‘Browser in the Box Firefox’
or ‘Browser in the Box Chrome’, which is
then installed in a VirtualBox virtual
machine (if you already have VirtualBox
on your PC, you’ll need to uninstall it
before you can use BitBox). You can
browse anywhere you like without
worry, because everything gets wiped
when you close the browser.
1
When you install Sandboxie, it will
scan your PC and highlight any
potentially incompatible software you
have installed. Clicking OK 1 will apply
special configuration settings to them.
You can add and remove programs
from here. 2 If you have conflicting
software installed (such as an antivirus
program), click Known Conflicts to
view potential problems.
2
If the Sandboxie window isn’t visible,
right-click the icon in the notification
area and select Show Window. Right-
click Sandbox DefaultBox 1 and open
the Run Sandboxed menu. 2 This gives
you options to launch a sandboxed
version of your default web browser,
email reader, any program, any item
from the Start menu or Windows
Explorer. 3
3
You can tell if a program is
sandboxed because the title bar
shows a hash (#) sign. 1 Also, if you
move your mouse to the top of the
program’s window, a yellow border
appears. 2 When you’ve finished
running your program, right-click the
sandbox and select Delete Contents
to clear out everything in it, including
any accrued junk.
Run Any Program and then browse
for the installer. The entire installation
process will run inside the sandbox,
so no files will be written to your PC and
no changes will be made to the Registry.
Avoid malware
If you download programs, games
or archived files containing movies
or music from dubious sites, you should
always check them with antivirus
software the moment the download
completes. To be completely safe,
you could download and run these
files within a sandbox.
If you regularly download items using
BitTorrent, you can launch your favourite
client in the sandbox, then check that
your downloads are safe before moving
them to your hard drive. Should the file
you download contain malware, it won’t
matter because it can’t harm the rest
of your computer in any way, and you
can quickly dispose of it by emptying
the sandbox.

WHY USE
SANDBOXING?
No need to uninstall software
Not every program you download and
install will be a keeper. Some you might
try and hate, or have no long-term use
for. Once you’re done with a program,
you’ll need to uninstall it, and there’s
no guarantee that all its files will be
successfully removed.
Try this experiment: go to C:\Program
Files to see all the files on your PC’s hard
drive. If you’ve been using Windows
for a while, you’ll likely see folders for
software you uninstalled ages ago, many
of which will be empty. This is why it’s
a good idea to sandbox a new program
and try it out before installing it ‘for real’
in Windows. When you’re done trying it,
you can simply empty the sandbox and
all trace of the program will be removed.
To install something inside a sandbox,
first right-click the Sandbox name in
Sandboxie, then select Run Sandboxed,

Sandboxing your browser means
you can go anywhere and download
anything on the web, without leaving
a trace on your computer. Launch
Sandboxie, then right-click the
sandbox. Select Run Sandboxed 1
and choose Run Web Browser. 2
It will load your default browser

mouse to the edge of the browser
window and check for the yellow border.
2 You can now browse the internet
as usual, and any files you download
will also be sandboxed.
3
The sandboxed items you
download will be deleted when
you empty the sandbox. If you want
to keep any, select the downloads
you want to save, 1 then select a
destination folder 2 and click Recover.
3 You can tell Sandboxie to only offer
the chance to recover items when
you empty the sandbox 4
MINI WORKSHOP | Sandbox your web browser with Sandboxie
Browse more securely
All modern browsers, including Chrome
and Firefox, come with a private
browsing mode that stops the browser
recording your web history and saving
cookies. It’s a great solution if you want
to visit certain websites without leaving
a trace on your computer.
Sandboxing your browser goes a step
further because not only will your
browsing history and anything else
you do go unrecorded, any files you
download and sites you bookmark will
also leave no trace. When you close
the browser and empty the sandbox,
everything you did will be wiped out.
You can, however, easily transfer
downloads from inside the sandbox
to your Desktop if you’re sure they’re
safe, so they don’t disappear along
with everything else.
A sandbox offers a further layer of
protection in that it can also shield you
from drive-by downloads initiated on
malicious websites, and prevent sites
from hacking into your webcam
and gaining access to files stored
on your computer.
Open any email attachment
Most of us are aware of the dangers
of opening email attachments from
people we don’t know, no matter how
convincing the accompanying message
is. However, if you sandbox your email
client (or your browser, if you use
webmail), you don’t need to worry
about opening any attachment because
a malicious program won’t be able to
infect your system. This won’t protect
you against phishing scams, though,
so you’ll still need your wits about you.
What’s already sandboxed?
A lot of popular programs and devices
already use sandboxing to keep you
safe. Browsers, for example, often
sandbox web pages you visit, preventing
any malicious code from gaining access
to your system files. Browser plugins
such as Flash are similarly constrained.
PDF readers will open PDFs in a
sandbox, and apps on iOS and Android
are only granted limited permissions –
if an app needs to do something like
access your photos or use your camera,
it has to ask for your permission first.
This automatic sandboxing also
prevents one app from interfering
with another.
Sandboxie’s settings let you customise the software’s appearance, restrict web access for
programs and choose what (if any) changes programs can make outside the sandbox

Loop from the menu. It will play over
and over until you stop it.
Watch it later
If you’re browsing YouTube and come
across a video that you don’t have time
to watch right now, you can save it to
play later. Hover your mouse over the
video and click the clock icon that
appears in the bottom-right corner.
To view a list of all the videos you’ve
saved to watch later,
select Watch Later in
the sidebar near the
top. If you’ve got a
YouTube app on your
TV or set-top box, you
can sign in and see
them from here, too.
Copy video URLs
If you want to share
a video – on your
blog, perhaps, or on
social media – right-
click the video and
select Copy URL.
If there’s a specific moment in the
video that you want to draw attention
to, you can simply quote the time by
saying, for example: “Watch what
happens at 12:52” (12 minutes and
52 seconds from the start). Or you
can get really clever and make the
video start at that point. When the
video is playing or paused, right-click
it and select ‘Copy video URL at
current time’. Share this URL and the
video will start from this point.
Y
ouTube’s comprehensive music
collection is the site’s most popular
resource but you can do more than
just watch videos from your favourite
artists. Install the brilliant Musixmatch
add-on for Chrome (bit.ly/musix419)
and you can turn YouTube into a karaoke
machine, with the song lyrics appearing
as subtitles along the bottom of the
screen. If you use a Chromecast, you
can even send the content to your TV.
Install the add-on, then head over to
YouTube and find your favourite music.
Click the cog icon in the toolbar at the
bottom of the video and make sure that
Subtitles/CC is turned on. Now play the
video and the lyrics will be displayed
in time to the music.
Sing-along videos
Turn off Autoplay
When you select and watch a video,
a panel down the right-hand side of the
page lists related videos or the next
in the series. When the video that’s
currently playing finishes, the next one
starts automatically. To stop this
happening and stay on the current
page, click the Autoplay switch at the
top of the video playlist. Click it again
to switch it back on.
Loop videos
If a song is stuck in your head and you
just can’t get enough of it, you can
satisfy your cravings by looping the
video on YouTube. Start the video
playing, then right click it and choose
Add lyrics to the music and sing

reveal what it does because it would
spoil the surprise, but you can move the
mouse around the page and create an
even queasier effect!
For similar silliness, type doge meme
in the search box to add some Comic
Sans colour to the YouTube interface.
Create GIFs from videos
If you’ve found a snippet of a video you
want to share, you could convert it into
an animated GIF – a small image that
plays as a short video. Go to YouTube
and, when you find a video you want to
share, right-click it and copy the URL.
Now go to bit.ly/giph419 and paste it
into the box on the page. A few seconds
of the video begins to play in a loop.
Drag the sliders to choose the start time
and the duration for the GIF, add a
caption if you want, then click Create
GIF. Use the links to share it or right-
click the image and save it.
YouTube TV
The YouTube interface works well on
a computer, where you sit close to
your screen and can use a mouse and
a keyboard, but it’s not so good on
your TV. An alternative interface that’s
designed to work better with
television screens can be found at
youtube.com/tv or youtube.com/
leanback. Press the F11 key to hide
the browser and go full screen.
You now have a great interface but
it’s still stuck on your computer. To
view it on your big-screen television, a
Chromecast is perfect. Go to youtube.
com/tv in Chrome, open the browser
menu and click Cast. Select your
Chromecast and YouTube will now
play on your television.
Chromecast works over your home
Wi-Fi network, so your casting
computer does not have to be in
the same room. You’ll now be
able to enjoy watching longer
videos and movies on your TV.
This method is also great for
watching playlists – just set them
playing and relax on the sofa to
watch them on the big screen.
Save the audio
You can save the audio track
from videos on YouTube using
the SaveFrom website
(en.savefrom.net). Start by
browsing YouTube and finding
a video that you want the audio track
from. Right-click the thumbnail image
and select ‘Copy link address’.
Now go to SaveFrom, click in the box
at the top of the page and press
Ctrl+V to paste in the URL. A few
seconds later, you’ll see a download
link for the video.
Bear in mind that most of the videos
and music on YouTube are subject to
copyright so any content you copy
should be for personal use only.
Remove age
restrictions
Some people like to browse
the web anonymously,
without being tracked and
spied on. That’s fine, but if
you go to YouTube in
an incognito or private
browsing window, you will
not be allowed to watch
age-restricted videos
because YouTube cannot
tell if you are over 18.
To see the restricted content,
you either have to log into YouTube
and browse in a normal window or
hack the URL to get around the age
restriction. To do the latter, you just
tweak the URL by changing
‘/watch?v=’ to ‘/v/’. So, if your original
URL is: www.youtube.com/watch?v=
Q9EaLjayx6U&list=PLPIbT_X3O_

Change it to: www.youtube.com/v/

View troubleshooting stats
Right-click a video and select
‘Stats for nerds’. A panel opens
in the top-left corner containing
statistics and video information, some
of which may be helpful if you are
having problems with playing videos.
For example, the panel shows
the dropped frames, where high
numbers indicate a poor internet
connection or problem with the PC
running too slowly. Videos download
a little to get ahead before they try
to play, and the Buffer Health shows
whether this is working normally.
The connection speed shows the
strength of your internet connection,
where low numbers would cause
problems with video playback.

Solve SSL certificate issues
Q
I received a notification on my
Windows 10 PC telling me that
Kaspersky can’t guarantee the
authenticity of a particular domain with
an encrypted connection. It says:
“Application: Google Chrome. URL:
www.instair.net. Reason: This certificate
or one of the certificates in the
certificate chain is not up to date.”
Clicking ‘View Cert’ showed the
message: “This certificate has expired or
is not yet valid. Issued to www.instair.net.
Issued by: Positive SSL CA2. Valid from
15/04/13 to 15/of/14.”
Kaspersky’s notification says: “Your
confirmation is required to perform the
selected action. This action will reduce
the level of protection of your computer.”
What should I do to update this
certificate?
James Andrews, via email
A
Unfortunately, it’s not within your
power to fix this problem. If a
website wants to offer a secure HTTPS
connection, it needs a valid SSL security
certificate. Only the website’s owner can
buy and install this.
Some SSL certificates are weak, and
all certificates have an expiry date.
Kaspersky is simply warning you that
there is a problem with this website’s
SSL certificate. This doesn’t mean
you should avoid using the site, but
you shouldn’t enter any credit card
details, usernames, passwords or
anything else you consider private.
Otherwise, it’s okay to browse.
HARDWARE
Fix a Chromebook trackpad
Q
My Acer Chromebook R11’s
touchpad is almost impossible to
use because it keeps freezing. I tried a
factory reset and adjusted the settings,
but neither made any difference. Using
an external mouse works fine but this
isn’t always an option if I’m on the move.
B Moore, via email
A
You’ve tried the correct things,
though Google’s support site
(bit.ly/goog419 also suggests tapping
the Esc key a few times and
‘drumrolling’ your fingers on the
touchpad for 10 seconds. You’ve already
tried a factory reset, so the next step is
to try re-installing ChromeOS. Find out
how to do this at bit.ly/recov419.
If none of this works, it’s likely to be
a hardware problem. The touchpad
on the R11 is designed to disable
itself when the screen is flipped
over and used as a tablet, because
you wouldn’t want the touchpad to
kick-in every time you brushed it
with a finger. Your Chromebook may
have got stuck in this non-operable
mode even when the keyboard is
returned to its laptop position.
If the Chromebook is still under
warranty, contact Acer support (bit
.ly/acer419) and they should be able to
sort the problem out for you. Even if the
device is no longer under warranty, they
may still be able to help, though you
may be charged for parts and labour.
Q
I enjoyed your recent Weekend
Project on changing your DNS
server (Issue 416, bit.ly/webuser416).
My Asus RT-N66U router lets me set
a DNS server in WAN DNS settings.
However, my operating system, Linux
Kodachi (bit.ly/kod419), also lets me
switch between seven DNS servers,
including DNS Crypt and Comodo
DNS. In this situation, which DNS
setting will the computer use? Does
the router’s DNS setting override the
operating system’s or vice versa?
Ted Sloan, via email
A
When you type a URL, such as
‘google.com’, your DNS server
creates a corresponding IP address,
such as ‘216.58.212.110’. Think of the
URL as human language, the IP
address as computer language, and
the DNS server as the translator.
If you configure a DNS server in
your OS (in your case, Linux Kodachi),
your computer will use this; otherwise
it will use your router’s. If you have no
DNS set in either your OS or your
router, your PC will use the one
provided by your ISP. In other words,
setting a DNS server in the router
overrides the ISP’s server, and setting
one on your computer overrides the
router’s server.
The advantage of setting a DNS
server in your router rather than your
OS is that every computer, phone and
tablet in your home will use the same
setting, which saves having to
configure each one individually.
Use the correct DNS
server settings
SECURITY
If you don’t specify a DNS server, your
PC will use one from your router or ISP

Remove annoying pop-ups
Q
I keep getting pop-up ads in my
browser. How can I get rid of them?
Melissa Arthur, via email
A
There are several possible causes
for pop-up ads. Your browser may
be configured to show a specific page
or set of pages when you start it up. If
you use Chrome, go to the menu and
click Settings. Under ‘On startup’, select
‘Open a specific page or set of pages’,
then click ‘Set pages’. If the set startup
page is not the one you want, move the
mouse over it and click the delete
button, then enter the address of the
startup page you want, such as www
.google.co.uk. The same process can be
used in Internet Explorer, Edge and
Firefox – just go to their settings and set
the homepage.
Extensions can also cause pop-ups
and adverts to appear, and change your
homepage. In Chrome, go to the menu
and click ‘More tools’, Extensions, then
disable all your extensions. If that solves
the problem, delete any you don’t need
or suspect may be causing the problem.
In Firefox, go to the menu and select
Add-ons. In Internet Explorer, go to the
menu and select ‘Manage add-ons,
Toolbars and Extensions’.
You should also check your startup
items for adware. Press Windows+R,
type msconfig and press Enter. Select
the Startup tab and, if you are running
Windows 10, click Open Task Manager.
Select and disable anything you suspect
may be causing the pop-up. We can’t be
more specific because it could have any
name. See our cover feature on page 38
for more about blocking pop-ups and
ads in Windows 10.

After upgrading to Windows 10,
I started experiencing problems
with Kaspersky and was advised to
remove certain programs, including
Comodo Antivirus. However, I am
having trouble deleting it from my PC.
When I searched Google for ways to
remove it, I found others had the same
problem. I’ve tried using Advanced
System Care 10, which has a powerful
uninstaller, but even if I try to remove
Comodo line by line, it returns as soon
as I reboot. I’ve also tried Revo
Uninstaller but it can’t find Comodo.
Eddie Turner, via email
A
Comodo Antivirus is bundled with
Dragon, GeekBuddy and Internet
Security Essentials. Make sure you
uninstall these other programs as well
as Comodo Antivirus.
When you use the Comodo
uninstaller, it is set by default to
download and install Comodo Cloud
Antivirus after removing the software.
If you leave this default option
selected, you’re simply swapping one
Comodo program for another. Look
for the tick box in the uninstaller and
clear it. This could be why it returns
after rebooting.
When we used IObit Uninstaller
(www.iobit.com) to remove Comodo
Antivirus, we found no trace of the
software afterwards. It sounds
counter-intuitive, but you may need to
reinstall Comodo Antivirus again to
create a clean installation that you can
then uninstall correctly.

Emma Abercrombie, via email

A handful of recognisable words in
the files you sent indicate that the
documents were created with the word
processor component of OpenOffice
(www.openoffice.org) or LibreOffice
(www.libreoffice.org). LibreOffice won’t
open your files and simply reports them
as corrupt. Opening and saving them in
another application may have corrupted
the files, so if you still have the originals,
try opening those in LibreOffice.

see which one is best for checking the
safety of shortened links, and the one
that I liked the most was Unshorten.link
(bit.ly/unshorten419). Whenever you
click a shortened link, Unshorten.link
automatically displays a link-expansion
page showing the original unshortened
URL and whether it is safe or not.
Unshorten.link was the only extension
I tested that worked automatically, and it
comes highly recommended.

Improve your writing
I am writing an ebook using Google Docs,
and I thought I would share a superb
add-on I’ve discovered that is a great
help for writers. It is called ProWritingAid
(bit.ly/prowriting419) and it analyses
your writing and produces a report
pointing out problems and indicating
where it needs improving. It has a
mixture of free and paid-for features,
but I find it works fine in free mode.
After entering some text into Google
Docs (you need at least a couple of
hundred words), go to Add-ons,
ProWritingAid, Summary Report. It takes
a few seconds to analyse the text and
produce a report. There is a lot of
information, such as unique words and
word families, the most used words,
the Flesch reading score, overused
words, sentence structure, writing style,
grammar, spelling, sticky sentences
and more. The report provides a huge
amount of information about your
writing style and quality. By using it,
you can improve your writing by fixing
the flaws.
To install it, go to Google Drive in
a browser, click New, then Google Docs.
Go to the Add-ons menu and click
‘Get add-ons’. Search for ProWritingAid
and click the install button.

Scan old photos
Like a lot of people, I haven’t used my
camera in years. My phone is now my
camera and Google Photos is my photo
album. However, I have hundreds of
photos from years back, taken before
digital cameras became popular.
I have been using Google PhotoScan
(bit.ly/photo419) to snap pictures of my
old photos and I can recommend it.
It saves the pictures then places them
in your Google Photos library.
The quality is pretty good. A lot of my
old prints aren’t that sharp anyway –
not like the 13 megapixel images my
phone takes now – so the results are
probably as good as if I’d scanned them.

TOP TIP
When I recently switched
from Microsoft Word to
Google Docs, the one thing
I really missed was the
option to open my files
quickly from File Explorer.
You can do this in Google
Drive if you sync to your
hard drive, but this isn’t
a viable option for me on my work
laptop. As a result, opening an existing
file from Chrome would typically
involve launching the browser, clicking
the Apps shortcut, selecting Google
Drive and then browsing my folders
to find the file I wanted.
I found this very long-winded, so
I eventually came up with a solution
that seems very obvious when you
think about it – I simply added
bookmarks to my most used folders
in Chrome’s ‘Bookmarks bar’. If you
need a lot of bookmarks for your
folders, you can just create a subfolder
Faster access to important Docs
GOOGLE DRIVE
on the ‘Bookmarks bar’ and order
them according to your preference.
Another advantage with this method
is that it makes it much quicker and
easier to save new files where you
want them. Ordinarily, when creating
a new file, I would open Google Drive,
then click New and Google Docs, but
these files would later need to be
moved to the location where I want
them saved. If I use one of my
shortcuts to open a folder and click
New and Google Docs, the new file
is already saved where I want it.

Enlarge the mouse pointer
Sometimes, particularly when using a

I have to shake the mouse or wiggle
a finger on the touchpad to find it. If you
suffer the same problem, open the
Settings app in Windows 10, then click
‘Ease of Access’ and the Mouse tab.
There are three point sizes, from small

Opera Neon doesn’t include DuckDuckGo

Click the three-bar menu button at the
bottom-left of the browser, then click
Settings, Search and ‘Manage search

below it. Type the following into these
three boxes, respectively: DuckDuckGo;
duckduckgo.com; and https://

Protect your online accounts
from hackers
LogDog (bit.ly/logdog419) is a handy
Android app that monitors your online
accounts and
identifies any
unusual
activity, so you
can take the
necessary
precautions.
It works with
services
including
Gmail,
Dropbox,
Evernote,
Facebook and
Twitter, and
sends you an
email as soon as any suspicious logins
take place. The app also includes an
impressive credit-card protection tool,
which searches black markets online to
make sure that your card details aren’t
being sold by hackers. Importantly, the
app doesn’t keep your passwords or any
other private details on its servers.
The one small catch is that the free
version of the scan is manual-only, and
the app only lets you add two online
accounts. Credit card details must also
be added manually.

Enable accents in SwiftKey
Last week, I was typing something in
French with Swiftkey (swiftkey.com)
when I realised there was no easy way to
add accents or other special characters.
After looking around the settings menus,
I discovered this option does exist, but it
needs to be
manually
enabled. First,
tap SwiftKey’s
main menu,
then tap the
Keys option.
From this
page, enable
the option for
‘Accented
characters’.
After doing this, you can long-press any
letter to display the accented variants of
that character.
Amy Price, via email
Web User says: If you often type in a
foreign language, SwiftKey is an excellent
choice because it lets you seamlessly
switch between them. To add a language,
open the main menu and tap More, then

the list, then select those you want to
download. Once the downloads are
ﬁnished, you can toggle your languages

If so, please send your story to webuser@dennis.co.uk
I recently misplaced my phone and
didn’t worry at first, but after a few
hours, I still hadn’t tracked it down so
I decided to take action. I’d read about
Android Device Manager in Web User,
as a way of locating your phone. You
can access Device Manager at bit.ly/
dman419, but there’s also an Android
app (bit.ly/device419).
My wife installed this and we picked
the Guest option from its drop-down
menu before entering my Google email
address and password. Within
moments, the app showed my phone’s
current location and it became clear
that I’d left it at a friend’s house the
day before. After phoning him, I used
the Ring function to make it ring loudly

so he could track it down. The app
obviously only works when your phone
is on and has an internet connection,
so it’s best to try it sooner rather than
later, in case your battery runs out.
You can check if the option is
enabled on your device by opening
Settings, choosing Google, Security
and making sure ‘Remotely locate this
device’ is switched on.

NikoBold, Web User Forums

There’s an article on Guiding Tech at
bit.ly/password419 that might offer
a solution. Scroll down to the heading
‘View Passwords of Networks You Were
Previously Connected to’ to find out how
to reveal all previous Wi-Fi networks
using the Command Prompt. Simply run
the console as an administrator, then
type the command netsh wlan show
profiles and it should show a list of all
networks. Next, type: netsh wlan
show profile name=Profile Name
key=clear, where ‘Profile Name’ (the
one after the ‘=’ sign) is the name of the
network whose password you want to
reveal. You’ll find the key under the
‘Security settings’ header.
It’s worth noting that to save you from
doing this for every network, you can
save the Registry keys for previous SSIDs
and import them into your fresh
installation of Windows. To do this, click
Start, type regedit, press Enter and
accept the UAC. Navigate to:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/
Microsoft/WindowsNT/CurrentVersion/
NetworkList
You’ll see folders for Profiles and
Signatures. Click Profiles and select File,
then Export. Do the same for Signatures.
Running these REG files in your new

saved networks automatically.
Just remember to back up your Registry
before you make any changes.

Fake news is nothing new
I see that ‘fake news’, as featured in your
FAQ in Issue 417, is causing much concern
in the establishment, with MPs poised to
investigate it. Why now? There has been
fake news for goodness knows how long
– it’s called the tabloid press and it’s
there every day. Take, for example, the
lies printed about Jeremy Corbyn.
Tabloids have said he wants to abolish
the army, that he’s a paciﬁst, a friend of
terrorists (paciﬁst terrorists, presumably)
and more that’s equally daft.
Any suggestion that newspapers
should be prevented from spreading lies
is always rebutted by the claim that it’s
impossible to do so without restricting
freedom of the press, which is vital for
democracy. Yet fake news online, we’re
told, must be stopped, because it’s
a threat to democracy. Why the
contrasting attitudes?
My guess is that papers are owned by
large corporations headed by people like
Rupert Murdoch and Lord Rothermere,
who have friends in high, political places.
Whereas
website
owners
don’t.

Can I trust Have I Been
Pwned?
In Issue 417 of Web User, you had a story
in your Security Alert section about Xbox
and PlayStation logins being stolen,
which mentioned the hack-monitoring
website Have I Been Pwned
(haveibeenpwned.com).
I checked a couple of my email
addresses on this site and, sure enough,
it found one for Adobe and one for
the PSP ISO forum. I’ve now changed
these passwords.
I passed the website on to friends so
they could also check their passwords,
and I heard back from one saying he
thought this was a phishing site because
after he checked his Hotmail address, he
received spam. I have now checked this

your advice 100%!

our Star Email in Issue 416,
‘Illegal streaming has overtaken
downloading’, only confirmed
to me the hypocrisy surrounding
downloading. I don’t mean from you or
my fellow Web User readers, I mean
the online organisations that sell films.
A couple of months ago, I purchased
a movie from Amazon that I thought
I could simply download in the same
manner I use with my music from the
same source. How wrong was I? After
trying various methods, I can stream
the movie but I still cannot download
it to watch on my device of choice.
Why not? I paid for it, I bought it and
I therefore own it.
Apparently, I would have no problem
if I was an Amazon Prime subscriber,
but I have no desire to be. In the end,
Download restrictions encourage piracy
I bought a physical DVD of the movie
and some DVD-ripping software, and
‘ripped’ the movie to a USB drive.
Why the fuss? Because it’s my favourite
movie of all time and I want to share it
with my teenage children.
When I read about illegal downloading
and streaming – particularly with recent
developments in media players such as
Kodi – I am no longer surprised about
the increase in such activity. Illegal
downloading is not to be advocated and
I ﬁrmly believe that we should continue
to pay for our movies and music, just as
we did when we could only obtain them
on DVD and CD. But, equally, the large
ﬁrms selling them in ‘downloadable’
format must be able to ensure that we
can do so easily – as easily as buying
a DVD. They need to stop being so
hypocritical about it and help to solve
a fairly simple
problem.
This solution
would reduce
the illegal
downloading
of movies.

Netgear’s speedy solution to
my router bug
Further to my email published in Inbox
Issue 417, ‘Netgear routers won’t accept
dollars’, I thought you would like an
update on the situation.
Netgear seemed to take my problem
with appropriate concern and, having
established that their latest ﬁrmware
(V1.0.1.16) did not cure the problem,
passed the fault to their ﬁrmware
engineers. I received a beta release of
updated ﬁrmware which resolved the
problem on 9 February – just three
weeks after I drew their attention to the
bug. Although it is disappointing that the
bug existed in the ﬁrst place, three weeks
seems a very reasonable period in which
to be provided with a ﬁx.
Considering all the concerns about
internet security, I would have expected
a company like Netgear to ensure we can
use all the special characters we are
advised to make use of. I expect many
users who have problems with their login
caused by using a special character
would not have the time or patience
to test each one, and would instead take
the easy option and choose a weaker
password that uses no special characters.

I had a brief look at OpenToonz (bit.ly/

your ‘Download paid-for software that’s

ﬁnd were located at bit.ly/toonz419a

Parents are right to be worried about

he cannot be stupid so he must have

However, I have been

How can we trust intelligent
robots?
I was interested to read your FAQ in
Issue 418 about Amazon’s Alexa voice
assistant. I certainly won’t be inviting one
of these things into my home because
I don’t trust technology that knows more
than we humans do. It’s all very well
having a device that can tell you the time
or record a TV show, but when you have
a robot in your living room
that listens to everything
you say and understands
your emotions, how can
you possibly relax? I am
not saying that all artiﬁcial
intelligence is evil, but
you have to admit that
there is potential for the
technology to be misused
or even to develop its own
dangerous capabilities.
People say that robots
are programmed not to
hurt humans, but that ‘law’
is taken from the work of Isaac Asimov
and is therefore science ﬁction, not
reality. I prefer to perform menial tasks
myself than to put my life in the hands
of a potentially dangerous machine.
I realise my concerns sound paranoid
but Professor Stephen Hawking himself
has warned of the dangers of AI.

Total anonymity is
impossible online
Your 10-page special in Issue 418 about
staying anonymous online was very
interesting. However, there are obviously
some ways in which you can’t be
“completely invisible” online, no matter
how much you’d like to be. For example,
Facebook and Google require you to
sign up using your real name and you
can’t use a paid-for service without
providing personal details.
Of course, there are valid reasons
for this – you
wouldn’t be able
to buy anything
from Amazon if it
didn’t know where
you live or what
your card details
are, particularly
as you can’t pay
by cheques and
postal orders.
All the same,
it means that
it’s impossible
to use the web totally anonymously,
unless you just do so ‘passively’ without
ever registering with a website or service.

I normally agree with Barry Collins’ views

My advice to Barry would be to install

if you don’t feel
comfortable
blocking adverts
on every website,
you can customise
the likes of Adblock

ads from speciﬁc networks. This means
Barry could stop seeing the offending
Brit Method ads from Adf.ly without
having to block everything else or
contact the Advertising Standards
Authority. You even recommend good ad
blockers on page 43 of the same issue.

Do you agree? Let us know at webuser@dennis.co.uk
18-year-olds employed by these
companies to ensure any social-media
backlash is immediately quelled. These
minimum-wage
script monkeys
have several tactics
to prevent you from
trashing the good
name of their
employer online.
The first is to try
and drag you off
into a side-room to
prevent the company’s name from being
further blackened in public, much like a
shop assistant will offer to take you into
the manager’s office to stop you making
a scene at the checkout.
“@BloodPressureGeoff Soz to hear the
XD300 blew up on only its second use.
DM us so we can sort this 4 you. Thx.”
To which the only correct response is
to take out a full-page ad describing the
problem in tomorrow’s Times.
Next, there’s the support accounts,
who think they can solve your technical
problems with the world’s least plausible
Barry Collins is tired of the patronising twits
that ‘help’ customers via social media
Page 404
solutions before waving the white flag.
“@AngryJan Sorry that turning PC on/
off didn’t fix your cracked iPhone
screen. Fill out this
192-page
questionnaire so we
can help U further.”
Then there’s the
very worst kind of
support – the
‘comedian’. There’s
a time and a place
for poorly scripted
jokes that are about as funny as a tax
return, and that’s Saturday evenings
on BBC1 with Mrs Brown’s Boys.
However, some overpaid social-media
strategist called Quentin has decided
that the best way to defuse a situation
with an irate customer on Twitter is to
engage in ‘banter’.
“@AneurismAndy Relax, big man. Your
phone’s not over-heating. You’ve just
been reading your Hotmail!!! #Bantz”
“@MaidstoneMoaner Sorry your email
is being plagued by spam. We aim to
MEAT your needs.”
Waterboarding is too good for these
people.
Twitter is a universally terrible place
for customer support. Companies spend
stupid sums on the social-media hit
squads, but all they seem to do is
antagonise customers further. Quentin
may be able to plot a graph in Excel that
shows the company’s ‘social-media
sentiment’ has increased by 152% over
the past 18 months because of the fine
work of his team, but if that money was
actually spent on improving products
and providing better tech support in the
first place, fewer customers would be
bursting their spleens on Twitter.
Don’t agree with me? Fine. Abuse me
at @webusermagazine. I’ll get one of the
teenagers to send you a witty reply.

here’s a reason why you don’t
see those squidgy stress balls
sold in the shops anymore –
instead of pounding a piece of
rubber-coated plasticine every time our
frustration reaches tipping point,
we instead pound our keyboards by
making our grievance public on Twitter.
Twitter has become the world’s
punchbag. Every time something goes
wrong, our first instinct is to fire off a
micro-stream of invective at whatever’s
got under our collars. Barely an hour
passes without someone in your timeline
going into a tech-related tantrum.
“Bloomin’ hell @BT. 16 hours without
broadband! Have your engineers got
narcolepsy?”
“Hey @HP. Are your ink cartridges
homeopathic? Only the last one ran out
after six sheets of A4!”
“Oi @AmazonUK. Your courier legged
it so fast after ringing my doorbell, he’s
set a new Commonwealth record.”
This kind of venting is invariably a
mistake, because you will awaken the
thousand-strong army of barely literate
