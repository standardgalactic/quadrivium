Living the Country Lifestyle All-in-One For Dummies

Introduction
M
odern technology and technological processes are great. Take, for 
example, the sewing machine. Before its invention, people made cloth-
ing by hand. After its invention, the sewing machine enabled women every-
where to make a garment in a fraction of the time it took previously. Now 
consider the additional advancement of the assembly line and the precision 
and speed with which thousands of garments can be made in a single day.
What was gained? Speed, efficiency, consistency of outcome. And what was 
lost? Tedious, eye-straining, finger-pricking labor. And a connection to a tra-
ditional, and in many ways, simpler and more meaningful way of doing things. 
The pricked fingers are gone, but so is the feeling of satisfaction that comes 
with self-sufficiency and accomplishment. This is just one example, but the 
lesson — that traditional ways of doing things have value, even if it can’t be 
tallied on a ledger or articulated as time saved — is applicable to many other 
areas as well.
Living the Country Lifestyle All-in-One For Dummies helps you rediscover the 
joy and satisfaction that come when you get back to the basics. Whether you 
long to rediscover what mealtimes can be like when the food you prepare is 
that which you’ve grown or preserved yourself; or seek to reawaken the joy 
of spending time outdoors; or have decided that a natural approach to caring 
for your health is the best approach, this book can put you on the right track.
About This Book
In a world that seems to grow more fast-paced every day, what do you do if 
you want to slow life down and get back to the basics — beyond turning back 
the clocks and tossing out the Cuisinart, that is? You find a resource that’s 
chock-full of information on how to apply traditional, down-home approaches 
to the activities you have to do or want to do. Lucky you, that’s just the kind 
of information that Living the Country Lifestyle All-in-One For Dummies pro-
vides. In this book, you can find out how to
 
 Prepare traditional meals, using traditional cookware, indoors or out.
 
 Put up (read preserve) fresh fruits and vegetables.
 
 Spin your own wool and knit it up into gorgeous apparel.
 
 Make quilts and other hand-sewn favorites.
 
 Plant and harvest your own fruits, vegetables, and herbs.

2
Living the Country Lifestyle All-in-One For Dummies 
 
 Raise your own farm animals.
 
 Experience the great outdoors.
 
 Incorporate the healing power of foods and herbs into your health 
regimen.
That’s a lot of information for one book, but like all For Dummies books, the 
info here is easy to find so you can focus your attention only on the topics 
that interest you. After reading this book, you may not be an expert, but 
you’ll have a new confidence that may spur you on to discovering even more 
ways to embrace a country lifestyle.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate through the text and easily identify different compo-
nents, this book uses the following conventions:
 
 Web addresses appear in a special font (which looks like this: 
www.wiley.com) so you can easily pick them out.
 
 New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 
 Bold highlights the action parts of numbered steps or keywords in 
bulleted lists.
A special note about the recipes in this book: As is true of most traditional 
cooking, the recipes have been handed down from one generation to the next 
and passed from cook to cook. Many recipes have made it to this book in just 
that way. A typical characteristic of these types of recipes is that they often 
don’t use precise measurements or give specific time guidelines. Instead, 
they tell you to “Add just a smidgeon of salt,” or “Simmer the sauce until it’s 
nice and thick.” So that anyone from the culinary novice to the seasoned 
cook can have success with the recipes in this book, the impreciseness is 
kept to a minimum. All temperatures are Fahrenheit.
 
 Measurements: The recipes largely give precise measurements (a half 
teaspoon of this or 11/2 tablespoons of that, for example) or indicate a 
range (1/2 to 1 teaspoon, for example).
 
 Times: The recipes also indicate approximate prep and cooking times, 
as well as times for the tasks within individual recipe steps.
But, at the end of the day, to be true to the heritage of traditional cooking, some 
ingredient amounts are occasionally left to your cooking judgment. Continuing 

3
 Introduction
a long-standing kitchen tradition, as soon as you make a recipe, that recipe 
becomes yours to do with as you please. Take advantage of this flexibility and 
feel free to adjust any of these recipes to suit your own tastes and cooking style.
And now just a few more quick words about the ingredients. Unless other-
wise noted,
 
 Butter is unsalted.
 
 Milk is whole.
 
 Eggs are large.
 
 Salt is common table salt, and pepper is freshly ground black pepper.
 
 Fruits and vegetables are washed under cold running water before using.
Finally, when you see T before a recipe title, that’s an indication that the 
recipe doesn’t contain any meat.
What You’re Not to Read
Like all For Dummies books, this one makes it easy for you to recognize non-
essential information. Feel free to skip these bits without worrying about 
impairing your understanding of the topic at hand:
 
 Paragraphs beside the Technical Stuff icons: These paragraphs con-
tain interesting, albeit tangential, info — think background information 
or technical details that go beyond what the average person would be 
interested in.
 
 Sidebars: These are entertaining or informative asides that add to the

Foolish Assumptions
Not every book is for every person. In fact, most books are written for a very 
specific person — obviously one who would be interested in the info the book 
contains. So here are the assumptions we made about you, our reader:

Living the Country Lifestyle All-in-One For Dummies 
 
 You want easy-to-understand information about how to get back to 
doing and enjoying the simpler things in life.
 
 Although you may have an interest in particular topics already and know 
something about them, you’re not an expert and you don’t want to be. 
You just want to know how to get started and how to make a successful 
go of your attempts — whatever the task at hand is.
 
 You may not buy into a romanticized “everything was better back then, 
and we all need to sell our cars and unplug our appliances” mindset, 
but you do believe there’s value in working with your hands and getting 
back to nature.
If these statements sound like you, then you’ve got the right book.
How This Book Is Organized
Living the Country Lifestyle All-in-One For Dummies is divided into six books, 
each one focusing on a particular topic or activity related to living a country 
lifestyle. Each book is further divided into chapters that relate to that book’s 
topic. So, for example, the book that covers country kitchen skills includes 
chapters on country cooking, canning and pickling, and so on. This structure 
allows you to find info whether you’re looking for a general area of interest or 
something more specific.
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills
Want to know how to cook a down-home meal? Book I includes indoor and 
outdoor cooking techniques and a collection of recipes that will have you 
hankerin’ to ring the dinner bell. Another traditional skill that’s coming back 
into vogue (for a variety of reasons, including money savings, healthy living, 
and the desire to support local farmers) is “putting up” produce. To help 
you do that, this book includes chapters covering how to can, pickle, or dry 
fruits, vegetables, and herbs.
Book II: Traditional Crafts
Many of the skills required to run a home of yesteryear — candle-making, 
knitting, spinning, hand-sewing, quilting, and more — have turned into

 Introduction
today’s crafts. You do them not because you have to, but because you want 
to. (Believe us, the “wanting to” part is what makes the difference between a 
chore and a hobby.) Book II gets you started.
Book III: Edible Gardening
Become a gardener and not only do you end up, literally, with the fruits (and 
veggies) of your labor but also with a connection to the land that goes back 
to the days when humankind first began cultivating the soil for sustenance. 
By following the advice and instructions in Book III, you’ll end up with a 
garden that’s both beautiful and bountiful.
Book IV: Getting Outdoors
Everyone needs to get outside more. Why? Because life outdoors is simplified 
and pure. Among the mountains, rivers, woods, and open spaces, city-bound 
inhibitions and lifestyle complications slip away like excess baggage. The key 
to truly enjoying nature, rather than just passing through it, is to do so with-
out being insulated by a barrier of technology. Book IV shares basic camping 
and survival skills, as well as activity ideas that the whole family can enjoy.
Book V: Raising Farm Animals
So many people dream of moving into the country and away from the hustle 
and bustle of city life — the traffic and smog and long lines and crowds. A key 
draw of country living? Being able to raise your own farm animals. Whether 
as pets, food sources, laborers, or sources of fun, animals are a farm institu-
tion. In Book V, you discover types of animals available, where you can buy 
your livestock, how to provide for critters’ basic needs, and what to do when 
an animal gets sick or injured.
Book VI: Natural Health
Long before there was any such thing as an urgent care clinic or a prescrip-
tion pad, there were natural remedies, many of which have been proven to 
have actual health benefits. Book VI tells you what these healing foods and 
herbs are and how to make your own tinctures, salves, infusions, and more.

efore the twentieth century, food packaging as we 
know it today didn’t exist. There were no straight-
from-the-microwave-to-the-table meals in a minute. No 
snack packs separated into compartmented plastic trays 
to be thrown in a book bag or briefcase and called lunch. 
No ready-made pouches of vegetables with “gourmet” 
sauces. No TVs and no TV dinners.
If your primary criteria for food prep is that it take the 
least amount of effort and time, these culinary “advance-
ments” are great. But if you long to get back to basics, to 
reconnect with simpler and, as many would argue, more 
wholesome foods, then this book is for you. It helps you 
say good-bye to overprocessed, overpriced foodstuffs and 
hello to natural foods you put up and prepare yourself.

ast iron has a nostalgic appeal. Watch reruns of old TV Westerns or pick 
up any book chronicling America’s past, from colonial times and the set-
tling of the West to more modern portrayals of cowboy roundups, and you’re 
bound to find at least one domestic scene that features a cook, a fire, and a 
cast-iron pot. If you’re trying to get back to basics, the idea of cooking the 
same way that your ancestors did may persuade you that cast iron is for you.
In addition to its rough-around-the-edges charm, cast iron is also conducive 
to healthy eating, easy to use and care for, suitable for a wide range of cook-
ing methods, and able to withstand the use and abuse that occurs in a busy 
kitchen. More importantly, many who use cast iron vouch that food cooked 
in it tastes better than food cooked in anything else.
This chapter explains what you need to know to become a cast-iron cook yourself.
Selecting Cast-Iron Cookware
Cast iron is easy to find and relatively inexpensive. It also comes in all sorts 
of shapes and sizes, from the traditional cast-iron skillets and camp ovens 
to specialty items, such as Bundt pans, loaf pans, and specially shaped corn-
bread or muffin pans. Fortunately, you don’t need a variety of pans to enjoy 
all the pleasures of cast-iron cooking.
 
One or two pans are really all you need to begin as a cast-iron cook, and you 
can’t go wrong with a skillet and a lid. With a plain old 10-inch skillet, which

is big enough for main-dish meals for most families, you can perform just 
about any cooking task your heart desires. If your family is a little larger (say 
six or more), a 10-inch skillet may not be big enough for main dishes, such as 
casseroles or roasted meats with vegetables. In that case, you may want to 
add a 12-inch skillet, a fryer (which is like a skillet but with deeper sides), or 
a Dutch oven to your collection. But go ahead and keep the 10-inch skillet for 
other dishes, such as cakes, breads, biscuits, and cobblers.
Identifying the cast of characters
You can find both new and used cast-iron cookware in a variety of shapes 
and sizes. The most popular pieces are skillets and Dutch ovens, but you can 
find all sorts of other basic pans and pots, too, as well as specialty items.
 
When you talk about cast iron, you have to talk about versatility. Although 
some items are designed with a special purpose in mind (the camp oven, for 
example, is designed for use outside), you can use cast-iron cookware in a 
variety of ways and for several different purposes. Use it indoors or out. Put 
it on the stove or in the stove. Bake a pie in a Dutch oven or roast a chicken 
in a fry pan. The following sections explain what these pans are generally 
used for. How you use them depends on your own cooking style and needs.
Skillets
Cast-iron skillets (shown in Figure 1-1) come in a variety of sizes, from very 
small (approximately 6 inches in diameter or less) to very large (more than 
15 inches in diameter). With average depths between 11/4 inches and 21/2 
inches (depending on the size of the pan), cast-iron skillets are great for a 
number of cooking tasks, on the stove or in the oven.

Fry pans
Fry pans are similar to skillets except that the sides of fry pans are deeper 
(usually 3 inches or more) so that the grease doesn’t splatter as much when 
you’re frying (see Figure 1-2). You can perform many of the same cooking 
tasks in these pans that you can in skillets. However, because of the depth 
of the pan, you can also use fry pans for deep-frying, simmering stews and 
soups, and slow-cooking on the stovetop or in the oven.

sides of

Dutch ovens
Dutch ovens are deep-sided pots with lids that you can use on the stovetop 
or inside the oven. They’re the original slow cookers. Put in the food, slap 
on a lid, set the oven to a low or medium temperature, and then come back a 
few hours later to a tender, delicious meal. But you can also use your versa-
tile Dutch oven for more cooking activities, such as baking, deep-frying, pan-
frying, and simmering. You name it — a Dutch oven can probably do it.
 
If you go looking for a Dutch oven, keep in mind that this piece of cast-iron 
cookware falls into two categories: Dutch ovens designed primarily for indoor 
cooking and Dutch ovens designed for outdoor cooking (see Figure 1-3). The 
differences between the two are as follows:
 
 The lid: An indoor Dutch oven has a domed lid. The lid of an outdoor 
Dutch oven is generally flatter and flanged (meaning it has a lip around 
the rim) so that you can put coals on the top.
 
 The bottom: Indoor Dutch ovens have flat bottoms; outdoor Dutch 
ovens have three short legs to keep the oven above the heat source.

12
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
 What they’re called: Indoor Dutch ovens are typically called Dutch 
ovens, but some people call them bean pots. Outdoor Dutch ovens are 
called camp ovens or, less frequently, cowboy ovens. You, however, may 
call yours anything you want.
For more information about cooking in the great outdoors (including camp 
oven info) and some recipes to go with it, head to Book I, Chapter 5.

Just because camp ovens are for outdoor use, don’t assume your regular old 
Dutch oven can’t be used for outdoor cooking. It can. The outdoor ovens just 
have a few little amenities built right in to make outdoor cooking that much 
easier.
Griddles and grill pans
Griddles can be round, square, or rectangular (long enough to fit across 
two burners on your stovetop), and they come in various sizes, as shown 
in Figure 1-4. The smooth surface and shallow sides (usually 1/2 inch or less) 
are perfect for making pancakes and hot sandwiches; frying eggs, bacon, and 
anything else; roasting vegetables; and making foods of the hand-held variety, 
such as quesadillas, fajitas, and pizza.

you use to grill food (vegetables, seafood, poultry, meat, and so on), either on

the stovetop or over a campfire. The ribbed bottom keeps the food out of the 
drippings and leaves nice sear marks, much like you’d get from cooking on an 
outdoor grill.

Because of the ribbed bottom, grill pans aren’t suitable for anything other 
than grilling. If you don’t believe it, try stirring a stew in one or getting corn-
bread to pop out of one!
Evaluating quality
Whether new or used, cast-iron pans are made from iron and steel formed in 
sand casts (or molds) — hence the name cast iron. The process itself and the 
materials used give cast iron its texture. If you’re used to shiny, smooth alu-
minum or stainless steel, you may not realize that new cast iron is supposed 
to feel rough and be a dull, gray color like, well, metal.
The quality of a cast-iron pan directly impacts how well the pan takes season-
ing, how efficiently it heats, how long it lasts, and how safe it is to use. When 
you shop for cast iron, take a close look at the following:
 
 Surface texture: The cast iron should be uniformly rough (like a cat’s 
tongue) and even. It shouldn’t be jagged, pitted, chipped, cracked, or 
obviously scratched. When you run your hand along the interior, you 
shouldn’t feel waves or dips.
 
 Width of sides: The thickness of the sides of the cast iron should be the 
same all the way around. Uneven width causes hot spots and makes the 
pan more prone to breaking.

14
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
 Metallurgy: The metals that go into a cast-iron pan must be mixed and 
heated appropriately. Unfortunately, you can’t tell how sound the metal-
lurgy is just by looking. Occasionally, however, you may notice some-
thing is obviously wrong, like discolorations or blotchiness in the metal. 
Avoid cast iron with these flaws, which can result in breaks, hot spots, 
or uneven heating.
 
 Where it’s made: American manufacturers must meet government-man-
dated safety requirements regarding the product itself, the materials 
that go into it, and the manufacturing process. These safeguards protect 
both consumers and employees. Manufacturers in other countries may 
or may not have to abide by similar requirements.
Used cast iron — especially when it comes free from Grandma and includes 
a bunch of recipes to boot — is great. In fact, if you have a choice between 
a new cast-iron pan and an old one that’s been well used and cared for, go 
for an old one. Still, as wonderful as an old pan is, you need to evaluate its 
quality as well. In addition to looking for the characteristics mentioned in the 
preceding list, pay attention to
 
 How well it has been cared for: Although you can refurbish many abused 
pieces of cast iron, some pieces aren’t worth salvaging. Avoid those that 
are warped, cracked, pitted, or chipped. Although fine for hanging as a 
wall decoration, these pans are no longer suitable for cooking.
 
 Whether the item has any paint spots on it: Dishonest dealers often 
repair holes and cracks with epoxy resin (an adhesive that hobbyists use 
in abundance when they build model airplanes and cars) and then paint 
over the repair to hide it.
 
 Epoxy resin is a great adhesive: strong, durable, long-lasting . . . but it’s 
poisonous if swallowed. It can also damage skin on contact and irritate 
eyes, and must be used in a well-ventilated area.
Prepping Your Cast Iron for Use
Getting your cast iron in ready-to-use shape is essential because new cast 
iron is porous. It has a slightly rough texture and microscopic pores that you 
have to fill before you can use the pan. Seasoning (which is also called curing) 
is the process of filling these pores and smoothing the rough texture with oil, 
thus creating a smooth, nonstick surface and protecting your iron pan from 
rust. The next two sections show you how to season cast iron and keep your 
efforts from disappearing too quickly.
 
If you try to cook in cast iron that hasn’t been seasoned, you’re going to end 
up with a burned, sticky mess. The pores in your hot pan (which expand 
slightly when you cook) will absorb whatever you put in it.

15
 Chapter 1: Cast-Iron Cooking
Book I

Seasoning your cast iron
Seasoning a pan requires little more than an oven, a bit of vegetable oil or 
melted shortening, and a little time. With these supplies in hand, just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
 
2. While your oven’s preheating, wash and dry the pan thoroughly.
 
 New cast-iron pans come from the factory with a protective coating that 
you must remove before you can season them. Simply scrub the pan 
using the hottest water you can stand, a mild dish detergent or soap, 
and a stiff-bristled (not wire) brush or a scouring pad (not steel wool).
 
 This is the only time you’ll ever use soap or a scouring pad on your cast 
iron — unless, that is, you’re reseasoning it because of some disaster, 
culinary or otherwise. (Want to know why soap is a major no-no? Check 
out the “Rub-a-dub-dub, removing the grub” section later in this chapter.)
 
3. Oil all surfaces of the cast iron.
 
 Using about a tablespoon of melted shortening or vegetable oil and a paper 
towel or sponge, wipe the oil over the pan’s entire surface — tops, bottoms, 
handles, legs, and so on. (If you’re using shortening, don’t dirty another 
pan just to melt it; instead, melt it in the cast iron you’re seasoning.)
 
 Don’t try seasoning your cast iron with lard, bacon grease, butter, or 
other animal products. If you don’t use your cast iron regularly, these 
seasonings can turn rancid; then you’re left with the job of cleaning the 
seasoning off yourself and reapplying it. Fun, fun, fun.
 
4. Place the cookware upside down in the oven and bake for 1 hour.
 
 You place the pan upside down so that any excess shortening or oil 
drips off instead of pooling inside the pan and carbonizing.
 
 Cover the area underneath your cast iron. Spread aluminum foil on the 
rack beneath the one your cast iron will be on, or place your cast iron 
on a baking sheet. Either method serves to catch any excess shortening 
or oil that may drip off.
 
 While the cast iron cooks, you may notice a slight smell and perhaps 
some smoke. That’s normal, so don’t rush to call the fire department. 
Just know that the more shortening or oil you use, the more pronounced 
the smoke and the smell.
 
5. When the hour’s up, turn the oven off and leave the cookware in there 
until the oven cools down.
 
 Now you can pat yourself on the back for a job well done.

16
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
Didn’t get the shiny black surface you were expecting? Don’t worry. It comes 
as you use your pan. What you’ve just done in this process is the initial sea-
soning. Every time you cook with your cast iron, the cure deepens, and in a 
few months time, you’ll have the deep black, satiny finish that you want.
 
To save time, season multiple pieces in one fell swoop. If your pan has a lid, 
season the lid when you season the pan. Your only limit is the amount of cast 
iron you can fit into your oven.
Protecting your seasoning
Now that your pan is seasoned, you can protect and deepen the seasoning and 
create the nonstick surface you’re aiming for by following these suggestions:
 
 Use your cast iron frequently. Every time you cook with your cast iron, 
you’re essentially reseasoning it, deepening its cure.
 
 The first six or seven times you cook in your cast iron, use it to cook 
foods that have plenty of fat. Fry hamburgers, fry chicken, make bacon, 
bake pies, and so on.
 
 The first few times that you use the pan, avoid cooking acidic foods 
(such as tomato-based dishes) and alkaline foods (such as beans). The 
acid and alkali react with the iron and mess up the seasoning.
 
 After cleaning your cast iron, wipe a small amount of vegetable oil 
around the pan. Doing so puts back any seasoning that was lost during 
cleaning. For cleaning instructions, head to the next section.
Occasionally, your seasoning may break down. If you don’t use your pan for 
a long period of time, if you cook food with liquid (steaming vegetables or 
deglazing the pan with wine, for example), or if you cook acidic foods, such 
as tomatoes, in it, you may have to reseason your pan. How do you know that 
you need to reseason your cast iron? The signs are pretty easy to recognize.
 
 Rust forms.
 
 Food begins to stick to the pan.
 
 Your food tastes like metal — not exactly your intended culinary 
objective.
If you notice these signs, first get rid of any rust (by using a rust eraser) and 
whatever’s burned on. Then follow the seasoning steps outlined in the pre-
ceding section.

Cleaning and Storing Cast Iron
It never fails — the joy of cooking inevitably meets up with the chore of 
caring for your cookware. Fortunately, cast iron is easy to clean and store. 
You just need to know what to use (and not use — hint: soap) and where to 
put it to keep moisture or humidity from wreaking havoc.
Rub-a-dub-dub, removing the grub
When you clean cast iron, your aim is two-fold: Clean off whatever remains 
of dinner and do so without destroying your pan’s seasoning. Contrary to 
what you may expect, you can do that with nothing more than hot water and 
elbow grease.
 
Never ever wash cast iron in an electric dishwasher. Dishwasher detergent 
strips the seasoning you’ve lovingly applied, the rinse cycle throws water 
on the newly stripped pans, and then the pans are left to essentially drip dry 
during the dry cycle.
Here’s how to clean your cast iron properly:
 
1. Remove any stuck-on bits of food.
 
 Scrape the sides and bottom with a spoon — the same task that you do 
to get the last bit out for leftovers. If your stuck-on bits are a bit more 
stuck on, try these suggestions:
 
• Heat the pan to a temperature that’s still safe to touch in order to 
open the pores and make it easier to clean.
 
• Scrub the problem spots with table salt moistened with either oil 
or water.
 
• Use really hot, almost boiling, water and scrub the spot with crum-
pled-up aluminum foil.
 
2. Using hot water and a nonwire scrub brush, scrub the cooking surface.
 
 Let the hot water flow over the pan as you scrub with a natural-bristled 
or stiff plastic brush. (You want the bristles to be about as stiff as the 
bristles on a medium or hard toothbrush.)
 
 Don’t use soap to wash your cast iron. Soap effectively cuts through oil 
and grease, and if you consider that that’s what your seasoning is — oil 
and grease baked into your pan through possibly years of cooking — you 

18
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
can understand why soap is forbidden. If not using soap makes you 
worry about what sort of germs may be lingering, pour boiling water 
into and over the pan after you’re done brushing it.
 
3. Immediately and thoroughly dry the cast iron with a towel.
 
 Put the cast iron on a burner or in a heated oven for a few minutes to 
make sure that all the moisture is gone.
 
 Never ever let cast iron air-dry. And don’t leave it sitting on top of any-
thing or touching anything — like the towel you dried it with — that has 
moisture. Any remaining moisture — whether it’s on your pan or on the 
item that your pan is sitting on — will cause your cast iron to rust.
 
4. Coat the cast iron with a thin layer of vegetable oil while it’s still 
warm and wipe it dry with a paper towel.
 
 Doing so helps preserve the seasoning and replaces any that was 
removed during the cleaning process.
 
When you use your cast iron to cook bakery-type foods — such as breads, 
biscuits, and cakes — you don’t really need to clean it at all. Simply turn the 
bread or cake out of the pan to cool, wipe the surface with a clean paper 
towel, and apply a light layer of vegetable oil. Your pan is then good to go for 
your next round of cooking.
Storing your cast iron
You have two options for storing your cast iron: stack it in a cabinet or hang 
it from a hook or pan rack. If you only use your cast iron on camping trips, 
leave it in the box that it came in. Wherever you plan to keep (or arrange) 
your cast iron, follow these suggestions:
 
 Make sure that you store your cast iron in a cool, dry place. 
Remember, moisture is the enemy.
 
 Store your cast iron with the lid off or ajar. Cast-iron lids fit fairly 
tightly, and if any moisture is in the pan, a closed lid won’t let it escape, 
and you’ll end up with a rusty pan. If you want to leave the lid on, place 
a folded-up paper towel between the lid and the pan and place a crum-
pled-up paper towel inside the pan to absorb any moisture.
 
 If you hang your cast iron from the wall, be sure that the hook or nail 
is anchored in a stud and can bear the weight of your pan(s). The 
same goes if you’re hanging your cast iron from the ceiling. And never 
hang it — even purely decorative cast iron — over a doorway unless 
you’re really, really sure it won’t fall.

Getting Familiar with Cast-Iron 
Cooking Techniques
Making good food in a cast-iron skillet or pot isn’t rocket science. All you 
need is a well-seasoned pan (explained in the earlier section “Seasoning 
your cast iron”) and a few simple cooking techniques. The following sec-
tions describe everything you need to know. Of course, having a few recipes 
doesn’t hurt either. You can find those later in this chapter.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire: 
Heat and temperature control
Cast iron is a great heat conductor because it absorbs heat quickly and dis-
tributes it evenly. Still, if you’re not used to cooking with cast iron, the heat-
ing properties that make it such good cookware may be exactly what trip you 
up. The next couple sections give tips on overcoming some of the issues you 
may face as a new cast-iron user.
 
When you cook outdoors over an open fire or hot coals, the rules for con-
trolling your cooking temperatures are quite different than those for indoor 
cooking. For outdoor cooking, you basically control your temperatures 
Hitting the road with your cast iron
Many people never take their cast iron any-
where other than potluck dinners, family 
reunions, or Thanksgiving get-togethers. They 
then have a tendency to transport it on their 
lap, between their feet, or safely surrounded by 
towels in the trunk of their car. Not to protect 
the cast iron, mind you, but to protect whatever 
delectable dish is inside it. Many other people, 
those who take their kitchens outdoors, con-
sider their cast iron a transportable tool, some-
thing that they pack with the rest of their gear.
If you belong to the latter group and plan to take 
your cast iron with you when you head out for 
an adventure in the great outdoors, the trick 
is to keep the pan from bouncing and banging 
around too much. Put it in the box it came in, 
wrap it in a towel or burlap sack, or wedge it 
securely against your mountain-climbing gear 
or other paraphernalia. If you’re feeling par-
ticularly protective, you can always cradle the 
cast iron in your lap — but you don’t need to. If 
cast iron could survive being carted thousands 
of miles west in covered wagons, it can prob-
ably survive your trip into the next county for 
a cook-off.

by the placement and number of coals. More coals closer to the pan mean 
higher temperatures; fewer coals farther from the pan mean lower tempera-
tures. Still, getting and maintaining the right temperature when you cook 
outside is a little more complicated than simply counting coals. You also 
have to adjust for the weather: air temperature, humidity level, wind speed, 
and so on. Book I, Chapter 5 explains all about outdoor cast-iron cooking and 
includes several easy and delicious recipes for the outdoor cook.
Getting the temperature and cooking time right
Cast iron absorbs and retains heat so well that your temperature setting 
may need to be lower than what’s specified in recipes not geared toward 
cast-iron cookware. Simply set the temperature as the recipe indicates and 
then adjust it downward as needed. If you notice, for example, that your 
stew’s soft simmer is actually more of a preboil, simply turn the heat setting 
down until you get the result you want. Eventually, you’ll know what setting 
to use to get the appropriate cooking temperature.
As far as cooking times go, the actual cooking times on many recipes may be 
slightly less when you cook in cast iron. (Note: The recipes in this chapter are 
based on cast-iron cooking, so you don’t need to worry about this issue here.)
Warming up to the advantages of preheating
Cast iron works best when the heat source is the same size as the bottom of 
the pan, but burners on modern electric and gas ranges are usually smaller 
than that. To eliminate this problem, simply preheat the pan when you’re 
going to cook on top of the stove. You can preheat your cast iron on the 
stovetop or in the oven. If you choose to preheat
 
 On the stovetop: Set your burner on low and let the cast iron warm up 
slowly. After the entire pan is warm, turn the heat up to the temperature 
you want.
 
 In the oven: Set your cast iron in a warm oven set to low (225–250 
degrees). When the pot or pan is heated, take it out of the oven, put it on 
the stovetop, and turn the burner to the appropriate temperature.
 
Unless the recipe indicates otherwise, you don’t need to preheat your cast 
iron when roasting in the oven, because the oven heats the cast iron evenly. 
If you do need to preheat the cast iron, simply put the cool iron in the cool 
oven and let it warm up as your oven does.
 
Many cast-iron recipes include preheating instructions. Recipes that aren’t 
specific to cast iron may or may not include such instructions. If you’re using 
a recipe that doesn’t include preheating instructions for your cookware, 
use this rule as your guide: You almost always preheat your cast iron when 
you’re making foods — like cornbreads, pancakes, muffins, quick breads, and 
any seared dishes — that you want to be crispy or browned on the outside 
and tender or moist on the inside.

Ending the exile of your metal utensils
Although cast iron does require some care, it isn’t particularly persnickety 
about the type of utensils you use. You can use wooden utensils, plastic 
utensils, or (believe it or not) the frequently banned pariah of a Teflon-coated 
kitchen — metal utensils! That’s right: Dust off your wire whisk and polish up 
that metal spoon. They’re back in business, baby.
In fact, if you find yourself facing a chunk of food that seems to have perma-
nently attached itself to your cast-iron cookware, you can even scrape it with 
a putty knife (preferably a clean one, of course). If you’re so inclined — or 
so desperate — just remember that you may need to reseason the spot you 
scratched at.
Other tips for successful cast-iron cooking
Seasoning and temperature control, more than anything else, can determine 
whether you become a fan or a foe of cast iron. To nudge you farther over to 
the fan side, read on for some other cooking tips to keep in mind.
 
 Never put a cold pan on a hot burner, pour cold liquid into a hot pan, 
and so forth. If you do, you run the risk of shocking your cast iron to 
the breaking point — literally. Let your pan heat up as the burner heats 
up, and if you have to add water to a hot pan, make sure that the water 
is warm or hot. (The same rule applies when you clean cast iron, as 
explained in the earlier section “Rub-a-dub-dub, removing the grub.”)
 
 All metal cookware is susceptible to thermal shock, a drastic and quick 
change in temperature. Cast iron, being the most brittle of all metal 
cookware, is more likely to break; aluminum cookware is more likely to 
warp. Whether the result of thermal shock is a broken or warped pan, 
the outcome is the same — a pan that’s no good for cooking anymore.
 
 Don’t store food in cast iron. The acid in the food breaks down the sea-
soning, and the food takes on a metallic taste. When you’re done serving 
the food, transfer what’s left to another container.
 
 Although you shouldn’t use your cast iron to store your food, you can 
use it to serve food. Follow these suggestions:
 
• Keep the food simmering until you’re ready to eat.
 
• Be sure to put a hot pad or trivet under the pan. Cast iron stays 
hot for a long time, and it can burn or mar your tabletop.
 
• To keep food warm for second helpings, cover the pan while you eat.
 
 Move your cast iron off an electric burner after you turn the burner 
off if you want the dish to stop cooking. Unlike a gas flame, which goes 
out as soon as you turn the burner off, an electric burner takes a while 

22
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
to cool off. Because cast iron retains heat in proportion to that emitted 
by the heat source, a dish left on a cooling burner continues to cook. 
This fact may not present a problem when you’re fixing a stew (where 
a little extra simmer time isn’t an issue), but it can be a problem when 
you’re thickening a sauce and don’t want it to caramelize.
 
 Before you cook with cast-iron cake pans, cornstick pans, muffin 
pans, and other bakeware, oil them or spray them with nonstick cook-
ing spray. Even the fat-free kind can do the trick. Although these pans 
should be nonstick if they’re properly seasoned, why take a chance if 
you’re going for presentation in addition to taste?
Cooking Up Cast-Iron Classics
The Pilgrims brought cast iron from the Old World to the New, and the pio-
neers took it westward. Heavy, dark, and rustic, cast iron has a nostalgic 
appeal that modern-day cookware lacks. It’s the cookware of choice for 
countless outdoor enthusiasts, and no cattle drive would be complete — 
even today — without a cook, a cast-iron pot, and a campfire.
Although you can cook just about any highbrow dish in cast iron, down-home 
favorites and comfort foods are what cast iron built its reputation on. These 
are also the foods that many modern cast-iron cooks still like to prepare in 
their black iron pans. The following sections contain several of the old 
standards — the foods that your ancestors may have once been inclined to 
make but that you and your family can enjoy just as much today.
Main dishes and sides
Of all the many entrees and sides you can create in cast-iron cookware, this 
section highlights those that, for whatever reason, just aren’t the same pre-
pared in anything other than cast iron. Each specific recipe indicates what 
type of cast-iron cookware it calls for.

Southern Fried Chicken
This recipe is simple, delicious, and easy to prepare. Just be sure to make enough for 
dinner and still have a few pieces leftover.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: About 35 minutes
Yield: 4 servings (2 pieces each)
3 pounds chicken pieces
11/2 cups buttermilk or milk
Salt and pepper
Paprika
About 1 cup all-purpose flour for dredging
Peanut oil or shortening to fill skillet 1-inch 
deep
 1 Wash the chicken pieces and pat dry.
 2 Dip the chicken pieces in milk and then lay them on wax paper. Sprinkle both sides of 
the pieces with salt, pepper, and paprika and then dredge them in the flour. Let the 
chicken stand for 20 minutes and dredge in flour again.
 3 While the chicken is resting, heat the oil or shortening in a deep cast-iron skillet or a 
Dutch oven on medium-high heat to 375 degrees. (The oil will be hot but not smoking.) 
Use an instant-read thermometer to test the temperature now and throughout cooking.
 4 Add 4 to 5 pieces of chicken to the skillet, browning both sides. Be careful not to add so 
much chicken at one time that the oil temperature drops significantly. Turn and move 
the chicken as necessary to ensure even browning. (Use tongs so that you don’t pierce 
the meat.)
 5 Move the chicken to a platter to allow room for the next 4 to 5 pieces. Add the next 4 to 
5 pieces of chicken and cook until all are brown.
 6 When the second batch of chicken is about brown, return all chicken to the skillet, 
reduce the heat to low or medium-low, and cover. At this point, it may be necessary to 
stack the chicken in the skillet. Cook slowly and gently for about 20 minutes, or until 
fork tender. Check several times and turn or move the pieces as necessary to keep all 
the chicken browned evenly.
 7 Remove the cover and return the heat to medium-high to recrisp the chicken, about 5 
minutes after the skillet is hot again. While recrisping, watch the chicken carefully and 
turn the pieces so that all sides are crisp, taking care not to burn the bottom pieces of 
chicken.
 8 Drain and move to a serving platter, or place on a rack in the oven to keep warm.

Country Captain
This recipe came from the late Mrs. W. L. Bullard of Columbus, Georgia. She once 
served it to a distinguished guest, Franklin Roosevelt, and it soon became a specialty of 
the house.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes per piece of chicken; 45 minutes in oven
Yield: 8 to 10 servings
4 pounds of your favorite chicken pieces, 
skinned
Salt and pepper
2 cups all-purpose flour
Shortening or peanut oil to fill skillet 1-inch 
deep
2 medium onions, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped
2 teaspoons curry powder
11/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 can (28 ounces) whole tomatoes with liquid
1 can (14 ounces) diced tomatoes with liquid
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
8 cups hot cooked rice
1/4 cup currants
1/2 pound sliced almonds, toasted
 1 Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Wash the chicken and pat dry. Lay the pieces on wax 
paper; salt and pepper both sides of the chicken. Dredge the pieces in flour until all 
sides are well coated with flour.
 2 Meanwhile, heat 1 inch of shortening or peanut oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over 
medium-high heat.
 3 Fry the chicken pieces a few at a time in the skillet, turning over until golden brown on 
both sides. You may need to reduce the heat as the chicken cooks, but also raise it 
when adding uncooked chicken pieces. As the chicken pieces are cooked (about 10 to 
12 minutes per piece), remove them to a 5-quart cast-iron Dutch oven.
 4 Drain most of the oil from the skillet, leaving 2 tablespoons behind. Add the onions, 
garlic, and bell pepper to the skillet. Cook until tender. Add the curry powder, salt, 
pepper, tomatoes, 1 tablespoon parsley, and thyme, and bring to a boil. Pour the mix-
ture over the chicken in the Dutch oven. Bake in the oven for about 45 minutes.
 5 Place the chicken pieces around the rim of a large serving platter and mound rice in the 
center. Stir the currants and half of the almonds into the sauce and immediately pour 
the sauce over the rice. Garnish with remaining almonds and parsley.

Pan-Fried Catfish
Once considered a “junk” fish, catfish has gained popularity recently. You can now find 
it served in many restaurants. When you prepare your catfish fillets, remove any skin 
and the dark fatty tissue that’s directly underneath it. This tissue has a strong fishy 
taste.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 catfish fillets (about 11/2 pounds)
1 cup buttermilk, or enough to cover the fillets
Salt and pepper
Cajun seasoning
1 cup cornmeal
Canola oil to fill skillet 1/4-inch deep
 1 In a flat dish, soak the fish fillets in the buttermilk for about 20 minutes.
 2 Lay the fish on wax paper. Discard the buttermilk. Season both sides of the fish with the 
salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning. Dredge in the cornmeal.
 3 Heat the oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over slightly higher than medium-heat. Place fil-
lets in the skillet and brown on both sides, about 2 minutes on each side, turning care-
fully with a spatula.
 4 After the fish browns, reduce the heat to medium or lower to finish cooking if your fil-
lets are thick. Serve with tartar sauce.

Tartar sauce
I suggest serving tartar sauce in this chapter. 
You can easily whip up a batch with this recipe. 
Mix all of the following ingredients together and 
refrigerate until you’re ready to serve:
  1 cup mayonnaise
  11/2 tablespoon finely chopped cornichons, 
plus 1 teaspoon cornichon juice
  1 tablespoon finely chopped green onions — 
only the green part
  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
  1/2 to 1 teaspoon minced garlic
Note: Cornichons are tart pickles made from tiny 
little gherkin cucumbers. If you can’t find cor-
nichons, you can substitute the same amount 
of any other pickle you like.

Fried Frog Legs
You can find fresh frog legs in the fish section in gourmet food markets, where they’re 
usually sold in connected pairs. Look for legs that are plump and slightly pink. Fresh 
frog legs are available from spring through summer; you can buy frozen frog legs year-
round. To store fresh frog legs, wrap them loosely and place them in the refrigerator for 
up to two days. You can also freeze frog legs so long as you thaw them in the refrigera-
tor overnight before trying to cook them. Either way, be sure not to overcook your frog 
legs — doing so makes them tough.
Preparation time: 2 hours
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 3 servings
12 small frog legs
1 egg
1 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 to 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
Vegetable oil for deep-frying
1/2 cup self-rising flour
1/2 cup self-rising cornmeal mix
 1 Rinse the frog legs and pat dry.
 2 In a large bowl, beat the egg, buttermilk, salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning together. 
Add the frog legs and soak for up to 2 hours.
 3 Heat 5 inches of the oil in a Dutch oven (or cast-iron deep fryer, if you have one) to 375 
degrees.
 4 In a medium bowl, combine flour and cornmeal. Dredge the frog legs in the flour mix-
ture. Drop into the hot oil without crowding. Fry until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. 
Serve with tartar sauce.

T Skillet-Fried Potatoes
The secrets to perfect fried potatoes are a heavy skillet (cast iron is perfect), even heat, 
and self-control. You have to let the potatoes cook long enough to brown and become 
crispy before you turn them. Also, use a spatula rather than a spoon to turn the pota-
toes so the slices retain their shape and don’t get all mushed together.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 30 to 35 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
6 small Yukon gold potatoes, or 3 russets 
(about 2 pounds)
1 medium onion
2 tablespoons vegetable shortening
2 tablespoons butter
Salt and pepper
 1 Wash, peel, and slice the potatoes. Chop the onion.
 2 Heat the shortening in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet until a drop of water skips and sizzles 
in the pan.
 3 Arrange 1/3 of the potatoes in a layer in the bottom of the pan, sprinkle 1/3 of the onion 
over the potatoes, and then sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Dot with 1/3 of the butter. 
Repeat this step two more times, forming three potato layers.
 4 Cover and cook for 20 minutes over medium heat. Don’t lift the lid and don’t turn the 
potatoes.
 5 Remove the lid and continue to cook, turning the potatoes once or twice, until crispy 
and done, about 10 to 15 minutes.
Vary It! For a complete meal, include smoked sausage or cubed ham in the layers and 
reduce the amount of salt that you use.

Cornbread and biscuits
Cornbread and biscuits are easy to make. They don’t require you to assemble 
a long list of ingredients, spend much time preparing them, or master hard-
to-learn cooking methods. In fact, from start to finish, you can get a version of 
either to the table in less than 30 minutes.
 
Generally, southern folks prefer unsweetened cornbread with a crisp crust. 
They like white cornmeal. Northerners prefer sweeter cornbread with a more 
cakelike consistency. They go with yellow cornmeal. Whatever kind of corn-
meal you use, always preheat your skillet or pan with shortening in it. The 
hot skillet and melted shortening give your cornbread a crispier, tastier crust.
 
T Real Southern Cornbread
Real southern cornbread isn’t sweet. In fact, it uses little or no sugar. The tang in the 
buttermilk and the bacon grease give this cornbread its flavor.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 30 to 40 minutes
Yield: 8 slices
3 tablespoons bacon grease or vegetable oil
2 cups white self-rising cornmeal mix
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups buttermilk
 1 Preheat your oven to 450 degrees.
 2 Put the bacon grease into a 9-inch cast-iron skillet and place it in the oven to get 
really hot.
 3 Blend the cornmeal mix, baking soda, eggs, and buttermilk in a bowl, using a spoon 
or fork.
 4 When the skillet and bacon grease are really hot, carefully remove the skillet from the 
oven and pour the hot bacon grease into the batter. Quickly stir the bacon grease into 
the batter.
 5 Pour the batter into the hot skillet. It should sizzle and may splatter. Bake for 30 to 
40 minutes, or until golden brown.
 6 Remove from the oven and let cool 5 to 10 minutes. Invert onto a plate, revealing a 
crispy brown crust. Cut into wedges and serve hot (with plenty of butter).

Yield: 8 slices
21/2 cups yellow self-rising cornmeal mix
1/4 cup sugar
1 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil

T Hoecakes (Johnnycakes)
The precursor to pancakes, hoecakes, which are sometimes called Johnnycakes, go back 
to colonial times. These tasty cakes resemble thin-ish cornmeal pancakes. Not as 
common as they once were, hoecakes are still a hit with outdoor enthusiasts because 
they don’t require an oven. Indoors, you can serve them as bread for dinner just like 
you would cornbread. And you can serve them for breakfast with honey or jam in place 
of pancakes, toast, or biscuits.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 3 minutes
Yield: 24 cakes
1 cup white cornmeal
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
11/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
About 11/3 cups buttermilk
 1 Heat your cast-iron griddle to medium-high heat on your stovetop.
 2 In a medium bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and 
sugar. Add buttermilk to the desired consistency — think of a thin, cornmeal pancake 
batter.
 3 Grease a hot griddle with solid vegetable shortening. Test the griddle for correct tem-
perature by splashing a few drops of water onto the surface. If the water dances in 
beads, the griddle is hot enough.
 4 Pour 1/4 cup of the batter onto the hot griddle. Turn when the surface is full of bubbles. 
Fry until the second side is golden brown as well. Keep griddle well greased and hot 
with each batch. Serve hot with butter.

Canning and Preserving
In This Chapter
 Knowing the proper processing procedures for both water- and pressure-canning
 Looking at recipes for canning common fruits and vegetables
 Taking food safety into consideration
O
ver the years, because of our busy lifestyles and the convenience of 
refrigeration and supermarkets, the art of canning and preserving has 
declined and almost been forgotten. But today, many people have a renewed 
interest in taking up these arts. Producing canned and preserved food in 
your kitchen is fun and easy. This chapter gives you an overview of water-
bath canning and pressure canning, as well as easy step-by-step instructions 
for each technique. If you’re new to canning and preserving, don’t be over-
whelmed or scared off by the rules. After you understand the basic proce-
dures for a method, like water-bath canning, you can focus your attention on 
preparing your recipe.
Before You Begin
Home-canning is a safe and economical way to preserve large or small quanti-
ties of high-quality food. Taking the time to select your recipe, choosing and 
preparing your food, and packaging and processing it for safety are fulfilling 
and a source of pride for you, the home-canner. Before you begin, though, 
you need to know a few things about how to make your canning experience 
successful and safe.
Knowing the acidity levels in foods
Knowing the acidity level of the food you’re processing is important because 
the pH factor, the measure of acidity, determines which method you’ll use: 
water-bath or pressure canning. For canning purposes, food is divided into 
two categories based on the amount of acid the food registers.

34
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
 High-acid foods: These are naturally high in acid, with a pH factor of 4.6 
or lower. These foods include fruits, tomatoes, and pickled vegetables, 
which are actually low-acid foods that have had an acid added to them, 
converting them to high-acid foods and making them safe for water-bath 
canning. Processing these foods in a water-bath canner destroys harmful 
microorganisms.
 
 You can change the acid level in low-acid foods by adding an acid, such 
as vinegar, lemon juice, or citric acid — a white powder extracted from 
the juice of acidic fruits such as lemons, limes, or pineapples. Some 
examples of altered low-acid foods are pickles made from cucumbers, 
relish made from zucchini or summer squash, and green beans flavored 
with dill.
 
 Low-acid foods: Foods in this group contain little natural acid. Their pH 
level is higher than 4.6. Process these foods in a pressure canner, which 
superheats your food and destroys the more heat-resistant bacteria, 
such as botulism.
 
Water-bath canning and pressure-canning methods aren’t interchangeable 
because the temperature of a water bath only reaches 212 degrees, whereas 
the temperature of a pressure canner reaches 240 degrees. So always use the 
canning method called for in a given recipe.
 
If your recipe doesn’t tell you which processing method (water-bath can-
ning or pressure canning) is appropriate for your food, don’t guess. Instead, 
use litmus paper to test the pH level of your food: Simply insert a strip of 
litmus paper into your prepared food and compare the color to the pH chart 
of colors that accompanies the litmus paper. If your food has a pH of 4.6 or 
lower, use the water-bath canning method; if it has a pH of 4.7 or higher, use 
the pressure-canning method. You can buy litmus paper at teacher- or scien-
tific-supply stores.
Eyeing the all-important headspace
Headspace is the air space between the inside of the lid and the top of the 
food or liquid in your jar or container (see Figure 2-1). Because proper 
headspace is important to the safety of your preserved food, always use the 
headspace stated in your recipe. If your recipe doesn’t give you a headspace 
allowance, use these guidelines:
 
 For high-acid foods (fruits and tomatoes), leave a headspace of 1/2 inch.
 
 For low-acid foods (such as vegetables), leave a headspace of 1 inch.

35
 Chapter 2: Canning and Preserving
Book I
Country 
Kitchen 
Skills
 
Too little headspace in your canning jars restricts your food from expanding 
as it boils and can result in some of the food being forced out of the jar and 
under the lid, leaving particles of food between the seal and the jar rim. If this 
scenario occurs, your jar won’t produce a vacuum seal. Leaving too much 
headspace may cause discoloration in the top portion of your food. It can 
also keep your jar from producing a vacuum seal if the processing time isn’t 
long enough to exhaust the excess air in the jar.
 
Figure 2-1:

jar.
 
Canning Fruits via the 
Water-Bath Method
Water-bath canning, sometimes referred to as the boiling-water method, is the 
simplest and easiest method for preserving high-acid foods, primarily fruit, 
tomatoes, and pickled vegetables. Water-bath canning destroys any active 
bacteria and microorganisms in your food, making it safe for consumption at 
a later time. It’s accomplished by using boiling water to raise the temperature 
of the food in the jars and creating a vacuum seal.
Your water-bath canning equipment list
The equipment for water-bath canning is fairly inexpensive. Water-bath can-
ning kettles cost anywhere from $25 to $45. In some instances, you may pur-
chase a starter kit that includes the canning kettle, the jar rack, a jar lifter, a 
wide-mouth funnel, and jars for about $50 to $60. The following sections out-
line the basic water-bath canning supplies.
A water-bath canner
The water-bath canner consists of a large kettle, usually made of porcelain-
coated steel or aluminum. It holds a maximum of 21 to 22 quarts of water, has 
a fitted lid, and uses a rack to hold the jars (see Figure 2-2).

The jar rack
The jar rack for a water-bath canner is usually made of stainless steel and 
rests on the bottom of your canning kettle. It keeps your jars from touching 
the bottom of the kettle or each other, while holding the filled jars upright 
during the water-bath processing period. The rack has lifting handles for 
hanging it on the inside edge of your canning kettle (refer to Figure 2-2), 
allowing you to safely transfer your filled jars into and out of your kettle.
Home-canning jars
To ensure safe home-canning, use only jars approved for home-canning 
and made from tempered glass. Tempering is a treatment process for glass 
that allows the jars to withstand the high heat (212 degrees) of a water-bath 
canner, as well as the high temperature (240 degrees) of a pressure canner, 
without breaking.
Home-canning jars come in many sizes — 4-ounce, half-pint, 12-ounce, 1-pint, 
and 1-quart — and with two different width openings: regular-mouth (about 
21/2 inches in diameter) and wide-mouth (about 31/8 inches in diameter). Use 
the jar size recommended in your recipe.
Two-piece caps
Two-piece caps consist of a lid and a metal screw band and are made specifi-
cally for use with modern-day home-canning jars. These lids and screw bands 
create a vacuum seal after the water-bath processing period, preserving the 
contents of the jar for use at a later time and protecting your food from the 
reentry of microorganisms.

Jar lifter
This odd-looking, rubberized tonglike item (shown in Figure 2-3), grabs the 
jar around the neck (the area just below the threaded portion at the top of 
the jar) without disturbing the screw band. This is one tool you don’t want to 
be without.
 
Figure 2-3: 
Jar lifters.
 
Foam skimmer
A foam skimmer is a slightly curved, not-quite-flat, large disk with small holes 
in it attached to a long handle. Its angle makes foam removal from the top of 
hot jelly, jam, or marmalade easy, while leaving any pieces of fruit or rind in 
the hot liquid.
Lid wand
A lid wand has a magnet on one end of a heat-resistant stick, enabling you to 
take a lid from the hot water and place it on the filled-jar rim without touch-
ing the lid or disturbing the sealing compound.
Wide-mouth canning funnel
A canning funnel is just like a regular funnel except that the wide mouth fits 
into the inside edge of a regular- or wide-mouth canning jar. Use this tool for 
quickly and neatly filling your jars.

Preparing your fruit, glorious fruit
When selecting your fruit, think fresh, fresh, fresh! The best fruit for this can-
ning method is freshly picked, ripe fruit. If you grow your own fruit or have a 
friend who shares hers with you, great! If not, consider going to a “pick your 
own” farm. If these aren’t options for you, buy your fruit at a farmers’ market 
or at a grocery store that sells quality produce.
 
The sooner you process your fresh fruit, the better the texture and flavor of 
your final product. Your fruit can wait a few hours or overnight before you 
process it, but be sure to refrigerate it until you’re ready.
Determining ripeness
To determine the ripeness of fruit, hold it in the palm of your hand and apply 
gentle pressure with your thumb and fingers. The fruit should be firm to 
the touch. If there’s an impression in the fruit that doesn’t bounce back, it’s 
over-ripe and shouldn’t be canned. If the fruit is as hard as a rock, leave it. 
Then smell it. Ripe fruit has a rich, full fruit aroma. A peach should smell like 
a peach; an apple should smell like an apple. The fragrance should be strong 
enough to entice you to devour the fruit on the spot.
 
If you’re picking your fruit, always use fruit picked directly from the bush or 
tree. Fruit collected from the ground (referred to as dropped fruit or ground 
fruit) is over-ripe. Don’t use it.
Skin on or skin off?
Sometimes leaving the skin on your fruit is optional. Other times, the peel 
must be removed. Always follow your recipe for specific guidelines.
Whole or sliced?
The fruit you select dictates using it whole or cutting it into pieces. For exam-
ple, fitting whole apples into a canning jar is difficult, but peeled apples cut 
into slices easily pack into a jar. Leave small fruit, like berries, whole.
Avoiding discoloration
There’s probably nothing less attractive than a piece of perfectly ripe, cut 
fruit that’s oxidized or discolored, turned dark or brown. Protect your fruit 
from oxidation by slicing it directly into one of the following antioxidant solu-
tions, a liquid to keep your fruit from darkening. Rinse and drain your fruit 
before packing it into your prepared jars.

 An ascorbic or citric acid solution: Make a solution with 1 teaspoon of 
lemon or lime juice in 1 cup of cold water, or use a commercial product, 
like Ever-Fresh or Fruit-Fresh, available in most supermarkets. When 
using one of these products, follow the instructions on the container.
 
 Vinegar, salt, and water: Make this solution with 2 tablespoons of vin-
egar (5 percent acidity), 2 tablespoons of salt (pickling or kosher), and 
1 gallon of cold water. Don’t leave your fruit in this solution longer than 
20 minutes, because the solution extracts nutrients from your fruit and 
changes its flavor.
Packing: Hot versus raw
With a few exceptions, most fresh fruits may be packed raw or hot. Always 
start with clean, ripe fruit, and follow your recipe’s instructions.
 
 Raw pack: A raw pack is the preferred method for fruits that become 
delicate after cooking, such as peaches and nectarines. This method is 
what it says: packing raw fruit into hot jars.
 
 Hot pack: Hot packing heats your fruit in a hot liquid before packing it 
into your prepared jars.
Lining your jars with liquid
You always add liquid when canning fresh fruit. Your options are boiling 
water, sugar syrup, or fruit juice.
 
 Sugar syrup: Sugar syrup, which comes in five concentrations (see 
Table 2-1), is simply a mixture of sugar and water. It adds flavor to your 
canned fruit, preserves its color, and produces a smooth, firm texture. 
Other sweeteners, such as honey, may be added in addition to or in 
place of the sugar. To make sugar syrup, bring your syrup ingredients to 
a boil in a saucepan over high heat; stir to dissolve the sugar.
 
 Water or fruit juice: Packing fresh fruit in boiling water or fruit juice 
produces fruit with a soft texture. Two good choices for fruit juices are 
unsweetened pineapple juice or white grape juice. Use water you like to 
drink, without minerals (don’t use the sparkling variety). Always use the 
hot-pack method (see the preceding section for more on this method) 
when using water or unsweetened fruit juice for your canning liquid.
 
Determining which liquid to use is up to you, but consider the final use for 
your canned fruit. For instance, if you’re using your canned berries in a fruit 
cobbler, boiling water may be the better choice because you’ll add sugar to 
the cobbler. If you’ll be eating your canned fruit out of the jar, use a sugar 
syrup or fruit juice.

should be waiting for you; you shouldn’t be waiting for your liquid to boil.
Canning fruit, step by step
Every aspect of the canning procedure is important, so don’t skip anything, 
no matter how trivial it seems. When your food and canning techniques are 
in perfect harmony and balance, you’ll have a safely processed product for 
use at a later time. This section guides you through the step-by-step process 
for creating delicious, high-quality, homemade treats for your family and 
friends. See the next section for recipes for different fruits.
 
1. Check and wash all of your equipment and utensils in warm, soapy 
water, rinsing well to remove any soap residue.
 
 Check the jar edges for any nicks, chips, or cracks in the glass, discard-
ing any jars with these defects. If you’re reusing jars, clean any stains or 
food residue from them.

41
 Chapter 2: Canning and Preserving
Book I

Kitchen 
Skills
 
 Make sure your screw bands aren’t warped, corroded, rusted, or out 
of round (bent or not completely round). Discard any bands that are 
defective.
 
 Examine new lids (lids aren’t reusable) for imperfections, scratches, 
and dents and check the sealant on the underside of each lid for even-
ness. Discard lids with imperfections (defective lids don’t produce a 
vacuum seal).
 
2. Fill your canning kettle one-half to two-thirds full of water and fill a 
saucepan one-half full of water. Begin heating the water.
 
 Heat extra water in a teakettle or a second saucepan as a reserve (see 
Step 10).
 
3. Submerge your clean jars and lids in hot, not boiling, water for a 
minimum of 10 minutes.
 
 Use your canning kettle for the jars and a saucepan for the lids. You 
don’t need to keep your screw bands hot, but they do need to be clean. 
Place them where you’ll be filling your jars.
 
4. Prepare your food exactly as instructed in your recipe.
 
 Always use food of the highest quality when you’re canning. If you settle 
for less than the best, your final product won’t have the quality you’re 
looking for. Carefully sort through your food, discarding any bruised 
pieces or pieces you wouldn’t eat raw. Follow the instructions in your 
recipe for preparing your food, like removing the skin or peel or cutting 
it into pieces.
 
 Don’t make any adjustments in ingredients or quantities of ingredients. 
If you don’t follow the recipe instructions to the letter, your final results 
won’t be what the recipe intended. Worse, any alteration may change 
the acidity of the product, requiring pressure canning rather than water-
bath canning to kill microorganisms.
 
5. Transfer your prepared food into the hot jars, adding hot liquid or 
syrup as dictated by your recipe. Be sure to leave the proper headspace.
 
 Use a wide-mouth funnel and a ladle to quickly fill your jars. You’ll elim-
inate a lot of spilling and have less to clean from your jar rims.
 
6. Release any air bubbles with a nonmetallic spatula or a tool made for 
freeing air bubbles.
 
 Add more prepared food or liquid to the jar after releasing the air bub-
bles to maintain the recommended headspace.
 
7. Wipe the jar rims with a clean, damp cloth.
 
 If there’s even one speck of food on a jar rim, the sealant on the lid edge 
won’t make contact with the jar rim, meaning your jar won’t seal.

42
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
8. Place a hot lid onto each jar rim, sealant side touching the jar rim, and 
hand-tighten the screw band.
 
9. Place the jar rack in your canning kettle, suspending it with the han-
dles on the inside edge of the kettle.
 
10. Place the filled jars in the jar rack, making sure they’re standing 
upright and not touching each other. Then unhook the jar rack from 
the edge of the kettle, carefully lowering it into the hot water.
 
 Air bubbles coming from the jars are normal. If your jars aren’t covered 
by at least 1 inch of water, add boiling water from your reserve (see 
Step 2).
 
 Unless your recipe calls for the same processing times for half-pint and 
pint jars, never process half-pint or pint jars with quart jars because the 
larger amount of food in quart jars requires a longer processing time to 
kill any bacteria and microorganisms.
 
11. Cover the kettle and heat the water to a full rolling boil, reducing the 
heat and maintaining a gentle rolling boil.
 
 Start your processing time after the water boils. Maintain a boil for the 
entire processing period.
 
12. Upon completion of the processing time, remove your jars from the 
kettle with a jar lifter, placing them on a clean towel or paper towels, 
away from drafts, with 1 or 2 inches of space around them.
 
 Don’t attempt to adjust the bands or check the seals.
 
13. Completely cool the jars.
 
 The cooling period may take 12 to 24 hours.
 
14. Test the seals on the cooled jars by pushing on the center of the lid.
 
 If the lid feels solid and doesn’t indent, you have a successful vacuum 
seal. If the lid depresses in the center and makes a popping noise 
when you apply pressure, the jar isn’t sealed. Immediately refrigerate 
unsealed jars, using the contents within two weeks, or as stated in your 
recipe.
 
15. Remove the screw bands from your sealed jars.
 
16. Wash the sealed jars and the screw bands in hot, soapy water.
 
 Doing so removes any residue from the jars and screw bands.
 
17. Label your filled jars, including the date processed.
 
18. Store your jars, without the screw bands, in a cool, dark, dry place.

Fresh fruit canning recipes
Almost all fresh fruits can well with these exceptions: bananas, lemons, limes, 
melons, persimmons, and strawberries. In the following sections, the quan-
tity guide for each fruit fills a one-quart jar. If you’re using pint jars, cut the 
quantity in half.
 
Always prepare whatever type of hot liquid your recipe calls for before you 
prepare your fruit. The liquid should be waiting for you; you shouldn’t be 
waiting for your liquid to boil.
Apples
Choose apples suitable for eating or making pies. Peel the skin with a vegeta-
ble peeler and remove the core from your apples. Cut the apples into slices 
or quarters. Treat the fruit with an antioxidant to prevent discoloring (see 
the earlier section on “Avoiding discoloration”).
 
 Quantity guide: 21/2 to 3 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Add your rinsed fruit to your hot syrup or other hot 
liquid and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the fruit to your prepared 
jars and fill the jars with the hot liquid. Allow headspace of 1/2 inch.
 Processing time: Pints and quarts (20 minutes).
Adjusting your processing times at high altitudes
When you’re canning at an altitude higher 
than 1,000 feet above sea level, you need to 
adjust your processing time. Because the air is 
thinner at higher altitudes, water boils below 
212 degrees. As a result, you need to process 
your food for a longer period of time to kill 
any microorganisms that can make your food 
unsafe.

Apricots, nectarines, and peaches
Peel the fruit, cut it in half, and remove the pits. Treat the fruit with an anti-
oxidant to prevent discoloring (refer to the earlier section on “Avoiding dis-
coloration”).
 
 Quantity guide: 2 to 21/2 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Raw pack: Pack your fruit into your prepared jars, cut side down. Add 
your hot liquid. Allow headspace of 1/2 inch.
 
 Hot pack: Add your fruit to your hot syrup or other hot liquid and bring 
the liquid to a boil. Pack the fruit into your prepared jars, cut side down. 
Fill the jars with the hot liquid. Allow headspace of 1/2 inch.
 
 Processing time: Raw pack: pints, 25 minutes; quarts, 30 minutes. Hot 
pack: pints, 20 minutes; quarts, 25 minutes.
Berries (except strawberries)
Select perfect, not soft or mushy, berries. Leave them whole. Wash and drain 
the berries (handling them as little as possible); remove any stems or hulls.
 
 Quantity guide: 11/2 to 3 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Raw pack (preferred for soft berries, like blackberries, boysenberries, 
and raspberries): Fill the prepared jars with the berries, gently shaking 
the jar to compact the fruit. Fill the jars with the hot liquid. Allow head-
space of 1/2 inch.
 
 Hot pack (preferred for firmer berries, such as blueberries, cranber-
ries, and huckleberries): Measure the berries into a saucepan, adding 
1/2 cup of sugar for each quart of berries. Bring the mixture to a boil 
over medium-high heat; stir to prevent sticking. Ladle the hot berries 
and liquid into your prepared jars, adding boiling water if there isn’t 
adequate liquid to fill the jars. Allow headspace of 1/2 inch.
 
 Processing time: Raw pack: pints, 15 minutes; quarts, 20 minutes. Hot 
pack: pints and quarts, 15 minutes.
Figs
Ripe figs have a short shelf life — about two or three days. Pick fruit that’s 
firm to the touch. Use canned figs as an ice-cream topper or a sweet-roll filling.
 
 Quantity guide: 21/2 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Cover washed, whole figs with water. Bring to a boil 
and cook for 2 minutes; drain. Place the figs in a boiling syrup and cook 
for 5 minutes longer. Add bottled lemon juice to your prepared jars, 1 
tablespoon per 1-pint jar and 2 tablespoons per 1-quart jar. Fill the jars 
with the hot figs and the hot syrup. Allow headspace of 1/2 inch.
 
 Processing time: Pints, 45 minutes; quarts, 50 minutes.

Grapefruit and oranges
Mix grapefruit and oranges for a sweet and tart flavor. Use white grape juice 
for your filling liquid in place of sugar syrup.
 
 Quantity guide: 2 to 21/2 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Raw pack preferred: Remove the peel from the fruit. Use a paring knife 
and carefully remove each fruit section from the membrane. Fill the jars 
with your fruit and add the hot liquid. Allow headspace of 1/2 inch.
 
 Processing time: Pints and quarts, 10 minutes.
Pears
All varieties of pears can well. After cutting and peeling the pears, treat your 
fruit with an antioxidant to prevent discoloring (see the earlier section on 
“Avoiding discoloration”).
 
 Quantity guide: 2 to 3 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Cut the peeled and cored pears into halves or 
slices. Cook them in boiling syrup for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the pears 
are hot. Transfer the fruit and the hot syrup to the prepared jars. Allow 
headspace of 1/2 inch.
 
 Processing time: Pints, 20 minutes; quarts, 25 minutes.
Rhubarb
Rhubarb, usually mixed with strawberries for a pie filling, is delectable when 
combined with tart apples. Although rhubarb is a vegetable, it’s treated as a 
fruit because its acid level makes the rhubarb safe for water-bath canning.
 
 Quantity guide: 11/2 to 2 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Remove and discard any leaves, which are toxic. 
Wash the rhubarb. Cut the stalks into 1-inch pieces and measure them 
into a bowl, adding 1/2 cup of granulated sugar for each quart of rhubarb. 
Stir to coat the pieces with the sugar. Let the mixture stand in a cool 
place until juice appears, about 3 to 4 hours. Transfer the rhubarb and 
the juice to a saucepan; bring the mixture to a boil over low heat. Stir 
once and fill the prepared jars with rhubarb and liquid. Allow headspace 
of 1/2 inch.
 
 Processing time: Pints and quarts, 15 minutes.
Tomatoes
A ripe tomato is red all the way to the stem with no soft spots and a strong 
tomato aroma. Each tomato variety has its own flavor and texture. Ensure 
the proper acidity level (4.6 or lower) for water-bath canning your variety by 
adding an acid, like bottled lemon juice or powdered citric acid.

46
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
 Quantity guide: 21/2 to 31/2 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Peel your tomatoes. Leave whole or cut into halves 
or quarters. Place them in a 5- to 8-quart pot and cover them with water. 
Bring to a boil; gently boil for 5 minutes.
 
 Add 2 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice to each quart jar, or 1 table-
spoon to each pint jar. (Note: For citric acid, add 1/2 teaspoon to each 
quart jar and 1/4 teaspoon to each pint jar.) Add your hot tomatoes and 
the hot cooking liquid to the jars; release any air bubbles, adjusting the 
liquid level to maintain headspace of 1/2 inch.
 
 Processing time: Pints, 40 minutes; quarts, 45 minutes.
Pressure Canning Your Veggies
Pressure canning is a process for preserving food with a low acid content by 
exposing the food to a high temperature (240 degrees) under a specific pres-
sure for a specific period of time in a pressure canner. Vegetables fall into the 
low-acid category. And only one form of canning — pressure canning — and 
only one piece of equipment — a pressure canner — are approved for safely 
processing these foods.
 
To reach a temperature of 240 degrees and superheat your filled jars of low-
acid food, use a pressure canner that’s approved for pressure canning by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
 
Not all vegetables are suitable for pressure canning. The following should be 
taken off your pressure-canning list: broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cau-
liflower, cucumbers, eggplant, onions, parsnips, rutabagas, and turnips. Many 
of these veggies are suitable for pickling, though. Go to Book I, Chapter 3 for 
pickling instructions.
The lowdown on pressure canners
In addition to canning jars, two-piece caps, a jar lifter, and a wide-mouth 
funnel (see the section “Your water-bath canning equipment list” earlier in 
this chapter for more on these tools), pressure canning requires a specific 
piece of equipment for safe food preservation — namely, a pressure canner 
with an accurate gauge, shown in Figure 2-4. These heavy kettles are made 
for processing home-canned food. They include a locking, tight-fitting cover 
that makes the kettle airtight, and they come in many sizes and prices.

47
 Chapter 2: Canning and Preserving
Book I
Country 
Kitchen 
Skills
No matter which type or size of pressure canner you choose, the goal is 
always the same: to superheat and process low-acid food at a high tempera-
ture (240 degrees) that destroys hard-to-kill microorganisms, especially the 
bacteria that cause botulism.
Figure 2-4:
A pressure 
canner.
 
Each pressure canner has a locking cover, a pressure gauge, and an over-
pressure plug. Manufacturers of pressure canners, however, slightly vary the 
same features and add accessories in much the same way car manufacturers 
add extras to a basic car model. All pressure canners — regardless of extra 
features or the lack thereof — safely process your filled jars of low-acid food 
in the same manner.
 
Don’t confuse pressure canners with pressure cookers; they are not inter-
changeable. You use a pressure canner to process and sterilize home-canned, 
low-acid foods. You use a pressure cooker to cook food fast. Check out 
Pressure Cookers For Dummies, by Tom Lacalamita (Wiley), for information on 
pressure cooking.
Picking and preparing your vegetables
Whether harvesting your vegetables from the garden or shopping at a farm-
ers’ market or your local supermarket, follow these guidelines when selecting 
your vegetables:
 
 Select vegetables that are free of bruises and imperfections. These 
marks could encourage the growth of bacteria in your food.
 
 Process the vegetables the day of harvesting or purchasing — the 
sooner the better. If you need to wait a day, store the items in your 
refrigerator to preserve the quality and prevent deterioration of your 
food. Don’t make your vegetables wait longer than one day!

48
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
Properly cleaning your vegetables is important to your finished product. 
Vegetables growing above the ground usually have a thinner, tenderer skin 
than vegetables grown in the ground. Remove any stems and leaves. Run 
water over them; gently rub the skin with your fingers and remove any dirt. 
Shake off the excess water and place your food on clean kitchen or paper 
towels. Root vegetables, those that grow in the ground (think carrots and 
beets), may require soaking to loosen any clinging soil. After first rinsing the 
vegetables, immerse them in a basin of cool water. Using a stiff brush (a new 
toothbrush works well), scrub the surface of the vegetables, removing any 
clinging soil. Rinse thoroughly with running water, placing the vegetables on 
clean kitchen or paper towels to drain.
You can prepare your clean vegetables for filling your jars in two ways: raw 
or hot, as the following sections explain. Keep in mind, though, that not all 
vegetables are suited for both methods. Follow your recipe instructions or 
check out the “Vegetable canning recipes” section later in this chapter.
Raw (cold) packing
The raw packing method uses raw, unheated vegetables for filling your 
prepared jars. Filling the jars with raw vegetables keeps them firm without 
being crushed during processing. Refer to your recipe instructions to decide 
whether to remove the skin or cut the vegetables into pieces. To fill your jars 
using a raw packing method, you simply prepare the hot liquid according to 
your recipe, fill the prepared jars with the raw vegetables, and then add the 
hot liquid, being sure to leave the required headspace.
Hot packing
Hot packing is precooking or heating your vegetables prior to placing them in 
your prepared canning jars. It’s the preferred method for the majority of veg-
etables, particularly firm ones, such as carrots and beets. Using precooked 
vegetables improves the shelf life of the processed food by increasing the 
vacuum created in the jar during the pressure-canning period. To prepare 
your vegetables for hot packing and add them to your canning jars, simply 
precook the vegetables as directed in your recipe and then immediately fill 
the prepared jars with the hot vegetables, pouring the hot cooking liquid in 
and leaving the required headspace.
Pressure-canning instructions
In this section, you find out how to pressure-can low-acid foods. Avoid any 
temptation to omit any portion of any step in the process. Each step is impor-
tant to produce safe, home-canned foods.

1. Check and wash your equipment and utensils in warm, soapy water, 
rinsing well to remove any soap residue.
 
 Make sure your pressure canner is in good working order and examine 
your jars for nicks or chips, the screw bands for proper fit and corro-
sion, and the new lids for imperfections and scratches. Discard any dam-
aged items immediately.
 
2. Place your clean jars and lids in a kettle of hot — not boiling — water 
until you’re ready to fill them.
 
 Never boil the lids because the sealant material may be damaged and 
won’t produce a safe vacuum seal.
 
3. Ready your canner by filling it with 2 to 3 inches of water and heating 
the water.
 
 Refer to your owner’s manual for specific instructions.
 
4. Prepare the food, following your recipe precisely.
 
5. Fill the jars, packing the food into one jar at a time so that the food 
is snug, yet loose enough for liquid to circulate into the open spaces; 
then ladle boiling water (or the liquid from precooking the vegeta-
bles) into the jars.
 
 Refer to your recipe for instructions or head back to the sections “Raw 
(cold) packing” and “Hot packing” for guidance. Be sure to leave the 
amount of headspace specified in your recipe.
 
 Use only one size jar (pint or quart) for each batch of food. Doing so 
allows you to complete the correct processing time required to evenly 
heat the jars and destroy microorganisms.
 
6. Release any air bubbles with a nonmetallic spatula or a tool to free 
bubbles.
 
 If the headspace drops, add additional food and liquid to the jar.
 
7. Wipe the jar rims with a clean, damp cloth; then place a lid on the jar 
(seal side down) and secure the lid in place with a screw band.
 
 Hand-tighten the band without overly tightening it.
 
8. Place the jars on the rack in the bottom of the canner, making sure 
you have the recommended amount of simmering water in the bottom 
of the canner.
 
 Don’t crowd the jars or place more jars in the canner than is recom-
mended for your size of pressure canner. Place them so that they’re 
stable, won’t tip, and don’t touch each other or the side of the canner.

 Unlike water-bath canning (refer to the earlier section “Canning Fruits 
via the Water-Bath Method”), you can process a second layer of pint or 
half-pint jars at the same time as long as your canner accommodates the 
height of the two layers. To build the second layer, place a second rack 
on top of the first layer of jars. Stagger the second layer of jars so they 
aren’t directly above the bottom layer. Doing so permits proper air cir-
culation for achieving the correct pressure and temperature.
 
9. Following the instructions in the owner’s manual, lock the cover.
 
10. Allow a steady stream of steam to escape from the pressure canner for 
10 minutes, or the time recommended in your manual; then close the 
vent, bringing the pressure to the amount specified in your recipe.
 
 Processing time starts when your canner reaches the required pressure. 
The pressure must remain constant for the entire processing time.
 
 If the pressure drops at any time during processing, so will the tem-
perature. To remedy this problem, return the pressure to the specified 
amount by increasing the heat. After the pressure has been regained, 
start your processing time from the beginning.
 
11. After the processing time has passed, turn the heat off and allow the 
pressure to return to zero.
 
 Allowing the pressure to return to zero may take as long as 30 minutes. 
Don’t disturb the canner; jars that are upset may not seal properly.
 
 Running water over your pressure canner to reduce the pressure is a 
definite no-no. The sudden change in temperature can cause the jars to 
burst.
 
12. Approximately 15 minutes after the pressure returns to zero, or at the 
time stated in the manual, remove the lid, opening the cover away 
from you and allowing the steam to flow away from you.
 
13. After 10 minutes, remove the jars from the pressure canner with a 
jar lifter, placing them on a clean towel, away from drafts, with 1 to 2 
inches of space around the jars.
 
 Don’t adjust the bands or attempt to check the seals.
 
14. Completely cool the jars.
 
 Cooling the jars may take 12 to 24 hours.
 
 As your jars cool, you’ll hear a popping noise coming from them, indicat-
ing a vacuum seal. This is a good thing. Consider it canning music.
 
15. Test the seals on completely cooled jars by pushing on the center of 
the lid.
 
 If the lid feels solid and doesn’t indent, you’ve produced a successful 
seal. If the lid depresses when you apply pressure, the jar isn’t sealed. 
Refrigerate any unsealed jars immediately, using the contents within two 
weeks, or the period stated in your recipe.

16. Remove the screw bands of the sealed jars.
 
 Storing your sealed jars without the bands allows you to see any signs of 
food seepage, which indicates a potentially spoiled product.
 
17. Remove any residue by washing the jars, lids, and bands in hot, soapy 
water.
 
18. Label your jars, including the date processed. Then store them, with-
out the screw bands, in a cool, dark, dry place.
Vegetable canning recipes
This section provides instructions and guidelines for pressure-canning some 
of the more common fresh vegetables. It also includes tips for selecting your 
vegetables and determining the approximate amount of fresh vegetables 
needed to yield 1 quart of finished product.
Asparagus
Select firm, bright-green stalks with tightly closed tips. Stalks with small 
diameters indicate a young, tender vegetable. Cut stalks into 1-inch pieces or 
can them whole, placing the tips of the stalks toward the top of the jar.
 
 Quantity guide: 3 to 4 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Submerge asparagus in boiling water for 2 to 3 
minutes. When the food is cool enough to handle, pack the food into the 
prepared jars.
 
 Headspace: 1 inch for asparagus and liquid.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 30 minutes (pints), 40 minutes (quarts).
Beans, dried (kidney, navy, pinto, split peas, and so on)
Rinse the beans before you soak them to remove any dust or dirt particles. 
You can easily accomplish this by placing the beans in a colander and run-
ning cold water over them while stirring them with your hands or a spoon.
 
 Quantity guide: 1 to 11/4 pounds dried beans for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Place the beans in a large pot. Fill the pot with 
enough cold water to cover the beans. Place a cover on the beans, 
allowing them to soak, undisturbed, for 12 to 18 hours. Drain the beans, 
adding fresh cold water to the pot to cover the beans by 2 inches. Bring 
the liquid to a boil and continue boiling for 30 minutes. Pack the hot 
beans into your prepared jars, adding the boiling cooking liquid.
 
 Headspace: 1 inch for beans and liquid.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 1 hour and 15 minutes (pints), 1 hour 
and 30 minutes (quarts).

52
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
Beans, green (pole or bush), string, Italian, or wax
Choose tender, small beans. Remove the ends and strings from the beans. 
Can them whole or cut them into 1- to 2-inch pieces.
 
 Quantity guide: 11/2 to 2 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Raw pack: Place the washed beans into your prepared jars, packing 
them tightly and covering them with boiling water.
 
• Headspace: 1/2 inch for beans and liquid.
 
• Processing time: At 10 pounds for 20 minutes (pints), 25 minutes 
(quarts).
 
 Hot pack: Add the beans to boiling water; continue boiling for 5 minutes. 
Pack the beans into the prepared jars, adding the boiling cooking liquid.
 
• Headspace: 1/2 inch for beans and liquid.
 
• Processing time: At 10 pounds for 20 minutes (pints), 25 minutes 
(quarts).
Beans, lima or butter
Purchase beans in the shell to ensure freshness, discarding any beans show-
ing signs of rust or mushiness.
 
 Quantity guide: 4 to 5 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Shell the beans by popping open the casing and 
placing the loose beans in a colander for washing. Add the beans 
to boiling water, removing them after 3 minutes. Pack the hot beans 
into the prepared jars, filling with boiling cooking liquid.
Pressure canning at high altitudes
If you’re canning at an elevation higher than 
1,000 feet above sea level, adjust the pounds of 
pressure used during processing according to 
the following table. Your pressure-canner pro-
cessing time will remain the same.

 Headspace: 1 inch for beans and liquid.
 
 Use a wire or bamboo strainer to quickly remove the beans from the 
boiling water.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 40 minutes (pints), 50 minutes 
(quarts). Increase the processing time for beans over 3/4 of an inch in 
diameter by 10 minutes for pints and quarts.
Beets
Select beets with a deep red color. A beet with a diameter of 1 to 2 inches is 
the most desirable size for pressure canning. Larger-size beets are best pick-
led (see Book I, Chapter 3 for pickling instructions).
 
You can preserve the bright, red color of the beet by adding 1 tablespoon of 
vinegar (with an acidity of 5 percent) to each quart of liquid.
 
 Quantity guide: 21/2 to 31/2 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Remove all but 2 inches of the stem, leaving the tap-
root (the main root growing downward into the ground from the bottom 
of the beet) intact. Scrub any clinging dirt from the beet with a stiff 
brush. Add the beets to boiling water, cooking them until they’re easily 
pierced with a fork (about 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of the 
beet) and the skins peel off easily. Slice, dice, or leave the beets whole 
before filling your prepared jars. Add clean, boiling water.
 
 Headspace: 1 inch for beets and liquid.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 30 minutes (pints), 35 minutes 
(quarts).
Bell peppers (green, red, orange, yellow)
Sweet, firm bell peppers produce the best results. Because of the extremely 
low acid level in this vegetable, you must adjust the acidity level of the bell 
peppers by adding bottled lemon juice. Use only pint or half-pint jars for this 
extremely low-acid vegetable.
 
 Quantity guide: 1 pound for a 1-pint jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Remove the bell pepper stem, core, and seeds. Cut 
the bell peppers into large (about 2- to 3-inch), uniform pieces. Boil the 
bell peppers for 3 minutes, draining and packing them immediately after 
cooking. (You can remove the skin by plunging the cooked bell peppers 
into cold water and peeling off the loose skins, but you don’t have to.) 
Pack the bell peppers into your prepared jars. Add 1 tablespoon of bot-
tled lemon juice to each jar and then fill with the boiling cooking liquid.

54
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
 Headspace: 1 inch for bell peppers; 1/2 inch for liquid.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 35 minutes (pints).
Carrots
Use carrots with a diameter of 1 to 11/2 inches. Remove clinging dirt from 
carrots with thin, tender skins by rinsing and scrubbing with a brush. If you 
prefer carrots without the skin, remove the outer layer with a vegetable 
peeler. Always remove the tops.
 
 Quantity guide: 21/2 to 3 pounds (cleaned and peeled, if desired, with 
tops removed) for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Slice, dice, or keep the carrots whole. Simmer the 
carrots in boiling water for 5 minutes. Pack the hot carrots into your 
prepared jars, using the cooking liquid to fill the jars.
 
 Headspace: 1 inch for carrots and liquid.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 25 minutes (pints), 30 minutes 
(quarts).
Corn, whole kernel
Starting with corn that has the husks on and the silk attached allows you to 
assess the freshness of the corn. Choose ears with brightly colored husks 
that are free of spots and moisture; silks should be golden, not matted or 
brown.
 
If you want to have better luck selecting corn that’s always sweet and tender, 
try this method: Slightly peel back the husk to check for any pests. If all 
is clear (no bugs or mold), use your thumbnail to depress a kernel about 
an inch below the top of the corn. If the ear has adequate moisture, liquid 
will squirt out, sometimes hitting you in the eye. Buy this ear! If no spitting 
occurs, select another ear and repeat the test.
 
 Quantity guide: 4 to 5 pounds (weighed with husks on) for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Remove and discard the husks and silk. Using a 
sharp knife, cut the kernels from each ear. Measure the corn to calculate 
water for cooking: For each pint of corn, add 1 cup of boiling water; for 
each quart of corn, add 2 cups of boiling water. Bring the measured corn 
and water to a boil, cooking for 5 minutes. Transfer the corn to your pre-
pared jars, adding the boiling cooking liquid.
 
 Headspace: 1 inch for corn and liquid.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 55 minutes (pints), 1 hour and 25 
minutes (quarts).

Greens (beet, collard, kale, mustard, spinach, Swiss chard, turnip)
Select tender stems and leaves to produce a superior product after cook-
ing and pressure canning. Large, older stems and leaves tend to produce a 
strong-tasting or stringy product.
 
 Quantity guide: 3 to 4 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: After washing, wilt the greens in batches by 
immersing them in just enough boiling water in a pot to prevent stick-
ing. Wilting times vary from 2 to 5 minutes because of the size of the leaf 
and the quantity in each batch. Turn the leaves to cook evenly. Slice the 
wilted leaves before filling the prepared jars for a tight pack — doing 
so eliminates trapped air bubbles. Add boiling water, including any left 
from the wilting process.
 
 Headspace: 1 inch for greens and liquid.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 1 hour and 10 minutes (pints), 1 hour 
and 30 minutes (quarts).
Okra
Fresh okra is a pod that’s best used when under 4 inches in length.
 
 Quantity guide: About 11/2 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Remove the stems, leaving the caps on for precook-
ing and packing whole. Cover the okra with boiling water, cook for 1 
minute, and drain. If you’re cutting the pods into 1-inch pieces, remove 
the caps before packing. Fill your prepared jars, adding the boiling cook-
ing liquid.
 
 Headspace: 1 inch for okra and liquid.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 25 minutes (pints), 40 minutes (quarts).
Peas
Use peas with a diameter smaller than 1/3 inch. If you use peas larger than 1/3 
inch, add an additional 10 minutes of processing time for pints or quarts.
 
 Quantity guide: 4 to 5 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: After removing the peas from the pods, add them 
to boiling water, cooking as follows: small peas (diameter smaller than 
1/4 inch) for 3 minutes, medium peas (with a diameter of 1/4 to 1/3 inch) for 
5 minutes. Remove the peas from the boiling water and place them in a 
colander, rinsing them with hot water. Pack the peas in your prepared 
jars, adding the boiling cooking liquid.
 
 Headspace: 1 inch for peas and liquid.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 40 minutes (pints and quarts).

56
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
Potatoes
These potatoes are round and white with a thin skin. Peel the potatoes prior 
to precooking. Small potatoes (2 to 3 inches in diameter) may be left whole; 
cut larger potatoes into quarters before precooking.
 
 Quantity guide: About 5 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Cover the potatoes with water in a large pot, bring 
the contents to a boil, and boil for 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes, 
reserving the cooking liquid. Pack the cooked potatoes into your pre-
pared jars, adding the reserved boiling cooking liquid.
 
 Headspace: 1 inch for potatoes and liquid.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 35 minutes (pints), 40 minutes 
(quarts).
Summer squash
Summer squash include crookneck, zucchini, and patty pan, to name a few. 
The skins are thin and edible, eliminating the need to peel them.
 
 Quantity guide: 2 to 21/2 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Cut the squash into even-sized slices or cubes. 
Steam or boil the squash for 2 to 3 minutes. Pack the hot pieces into 
your prepared jars, filling the jars with boiling water, including any left-
over from precooking.
 
 Headspace: 1/2 inch for squash and liquid.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 30 minutes (pints), 40 minutes 
(quarts).
Winter squash and pumpkins
Other types of squash that are good for canning include banana, butternut, 
Hubbard, spaghetti, and turban squash. Because pumpkins are similar in 
texture, you can use these instructions for them, too. This process is a bit 
labor intensive, but the rewards are oh so good!
 
 Quantity guide: 2 to 3 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Cut the squash into pieces (about 1 inch by 3 
inches), scraping out the fiber and the seeds. Place the pieces in a large 
pot, adding just enough water to cover the pieces. Boil the squash until 
it’s soft and easily pierced with a fork, about 10 to 30 minutes depending 
on the variety you’re using. Scrape the pulp from the softened skin and 
mash it or run it through a food mill. Return the squash to the pot and 
bring the contents to a boil, stirring constantly to keep it from sticking. 
Upon boiling, transfer the squash to your prepared jars.

Yams and sweet potatoes
Yams are tubers, and sweet potatoes are roots — so they’re actually from 
two different plant species. Even though sweet potatoes and yams are 
unrelated, they’re suitable for the same uses.
Small potatoes may be left whole; cut larger ones into quarters before remov-
ing the skins.
 
 Quantity guide: 21/2 to 3 pounds for a 1-quart jar.
 
 Hot pack preferred: Precook vegetables in boiling water until the peels 
can be rubbed off, about 5 to 15 minutes. Pack hot food into your pre-
pared jars, adding clean boiling water or a boiling sweet syrup (21/2 cups 
granulated sugar and 51/4 cups water brought to a boil, yielding about 61/2
cups of liquid).
 
 Headspace: 1 inch for potatoes and liquid.
 
 Processing time: At 10 pounds for 1 hour and 5 minutes (pints), 1 hour 
and 30 minutes (quarts).
Making Sure Your Food 
Is Still Good to Eat
Although you may follow all the proper steps and procedures for canning 
foods, you still have a chance for spoilage. The following sections show you 
how to ensure your food is safe to eat, recognize spoiled food, and dispose of 
it properly.
Ensuring food safety
There’s no guarantee that your home-canned foods will always be free from 
spoilage, but your chances for spoiled food are greatly reduced when you 
follow the precise guidelines for each preserving method. In addition to 
your specific canning procedures, follow these guidelines to guard against 
food spoilage:

58
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
 Don’t experiment or take shortcuts. Use only tested, approved methods.
 
 Use fresh, firm (not over-ripe) food. Wash it thoroughly. Can fruit and 
vegetables as soon as possible after they’re picked.
 
 Use jars and two-piece caps made for home-canning. Discard any jars 
that are cracked or nicked.
 
 Don’t over-pack foods. Trying to cram too much food into a jar may result 
in under-processing because the heat can’t evenly penetrate the food.
 
 Never use sealing lids a second time. Always use new lids. The sealant 
on the underside of the lid is good for only one processing.
 
 Test your pressure canner before you use it. Have your dial gauge 
tested annually to verify its accuracy. (Weighted gauges don’t require 
testing.)
 
 Process your food for the full amount of time stated in your recipe. 
Make adjustments to your processing time and pressure for altitudes 
over 1,000 feet above sea level. (See the sidebars, “Adjusting your pro-
cessing times at high altitudes” and “Pressure canning at high altitudes” 
for more details.)
 
 Test each jar’s seal and remove the screw band before storing your 
food. Removing the screw bands from your cooled, sealed jars before 
storing them allows you to easily detect any broken seals or food oozing 
out from under the lid, which indicates spoilage.
 
 Never use or taste any canned food that exhibits signs of spoilage. 
Discard it immediately.
Identifying food gone bad
 
The best way to detect food spoilage is by visually examining your jars. 
Review the following checklist. If you can answer “true” for each of the follow-
ing statements, your food should be safe for eating:
 
 The food in the jar is covered with liquid and fully packed, and proper 
headspace has been maintained.
 
 The food in the jar is free from moving air bubbles.
 
 The jars have good, tight seals. When you rotate the jar, you don’t see 
any seepage or oozing from under the lid.
 
 The food has maintained a uniform color and isn’t broken or mushy.
 
 The liquid in the jar is clear, not cloudy, and free of sediment.
 
 When you open the jar, no liquid spurts out, you notice no unnatural or 
unusual odors, and you see no cottonlike growths on top of the food’s 
surface or on the underside of the lid.

59

Botulism poisoning can be fatal. Because botulism spores have no odor and 
can’t be seen, you can’t always tell which jars are tainted. If you suspect that 
a jar of food is spoiled, never, never, never taste it.
Disposing of spoiled food safely
 
What you never want to do with spoiled food is pour it into a water source, 
a sink or garbage disposal, or down the toilet, because it may come into con-
tact with humans or animals through a water-reclamation process. Instead, 
follow the guidelines in the next sections.
If your jar is still sealed
If the jar has the seal intact, you can simply discard the unopened container 
in the trash or bury it deeply in the soil. Doing so keeps the product from 
coming in contact with any human or animal and eliminates the transfer of 
bacteria.
If your jar has a broken seal
If your jar has a broken seal, you need to take extra precautions to make sure 
you don’t contaminate any other food or surface. Follow these steps:
 
1. Boil the jar, lid, screw band, and contents in a covered pot for 30 
minutes.
 
 Place everything in a deep cooking pot and cover the items with 1 to 2 
inches of water, taking care not to splash any of the contents outside of 
the pot.
 
2. Turn off the heat and let the contents cool while remaining covered.
 
3. Discard the contents in a sealed container in the trash, or bury them 
deeply in the soil.
 
4. Using a solution made up of one part household chlorine bleach to 
four parts lukewarm water, thoroughly wash everything that came 
into contact with the jar or spoiled food.
 
 This includes all equipment, work surfaces, clothing, and body parts.
 
5. Dispose of the jar, the lid and screw band, and any sponges or 
dishcloths used in any phase of this process by wrapping the items 
in a trash bag, sealing the bag, and placing it in the trash.

Preserving by Way of Pickling
In This Chapter
 Outlining the pickling process
 Soaking in brining solutions
 Trying some pickling recipes
P
ickling is used for a wide range of foods, including fruits and vegetables. 
Although pickling isn’t practiced much today, don’t overlook this reward-
ing process. This chapter gives you an overview of pickling, describing the 
ingredients, the utensils, and the methods used. In no time, you’ll be making 
easy-to-prepare pickled food and condiments to wow your taste buds.
The Art of Pickling
Pickling preserves food in a brine solution, a strong mixture of water, salt, 
vinegar, herbs and spices, and sometimes sugar or another sweetener, such 
as corn syrup. The perfect balance of these ingredients safely preserves 
your pickled food. You can achieve this balance by precisely measuring your 
ingredients and following each step in your recipe.
The ingredients
The four basic ingredients for pickling are salt, vinegar, water, and herbs and 
spices. Use high-quality ingredients for the best results.

Salt
Salt is used as a preservative. It adds flavor and crispness to your food, 
especially pickles. Use a pure, additive-free, granulated salt. (Additives in 
salt cause cloudy liquid. Always read the ingredient label on your salt con-
tainer to ensure it’s additive-free.) The following table lists which salts are 
acceptable for pickling and which ones aren’t.
Acceptable salts 
Unacceptable salts
Pickling and canning salt 
Table and iodized salt
Most kosher salt 
Rock salt
Sea salt 
Salt substitutes
Vinegar
Vinegar is a tart liquid that prevents the growth of bacteria. The preferred 
vinegar for pickling is distilled white vinegar with a sharp, tart flavor. It main-
tains the color of your food and is relatively inexpensive. Use apple cider 
vinegar for a milder flavor.
Always use a vinegar with an acidity level of 5 percent. If the level of acidity 
isn’t on the label, don’t use the vinegar — the strength of the acid may not be 
adequate for safe food preservation.
 
Never dilute or reduce the amount of vinegar in a recipe. If the flavor’s too 
tart, add 1/4 cup of granulated sugar for every 4 cups of vinegar. Treating fla-
vors in this manner won’t upset the balance of your vinegar. If you don’t like 
the flavor when you make the recipe a second time, try another recipe.
Water
Soft water is the best water for your brine solution. Distilled water, water with 
all minerals and other impurities removed, is also a good choice. If you use 
tap water, make sure it’s of drinking quality; if it doesn’t taste good straight 
from the tap, it won’t taste better in your food. Also, avoid sparkling water.
 
To soften tap water, boil it in a large kettle for 15 minutes. Cool the water and 
allow it to stand for 24 hours. Remove any scum on the surface with a foam 
skimmer. Ladle the water into a measuring cup without disturbing the sedi-
ment on the bottom of the kettle. Add 1 tablespoon of vinegar to each gallon 
of water.

 Chapter 3: Preserving by Way of Pickling
Book I
Country 
Kitchen 
Skills
Herbs and spices
Use the exact amount of herbs or spices called for in your recipe. If your 
recipe calls for a fresh herb, use the fresh herb. If your recipe calls for a 
dried spice, use one with a strong aroma. Sometimes recipes call for pickling 
spices. These are blends of many spices, including allspice, bay leaves, carda-
mom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, ginger, mustard seeds, and peppercorns. 
They’re mixed by the manufacturer and vary in flavor.
The equipment and the utensils
In addition to the basic equipment for water-bath canning (refer to Book I, 
Chapter 2), you need nonreactive utensils and equipment for handling, cook-
ing, and brining your food. Nonreactive items are usually made of stainless 
steel, enamelware, or glass.
 
Stoneware crocks are excellent choices for brining food. You can find them at 
specialty cookware stores or where canning supplies are sold.
 
Items made from — or containing — zinc, iron, brass, copper, or galvanized 
metal and enamelware with chips or cracks in the enamel react with the 
acids and salt during the pickling process. This reaction alters the color 
of your food — copper turns your pickles a funny green; iron makes the 
food black — and produces a finished product that tastes bad. More impor-
tantly, galvanized items produce a poison when the acid and the salt touch 
the zinc. This poison is transferred to your food, causing serious illness (or 
worse).
Getting an Education in Brining
Brining is part of the pickling process and requires the use of an acid, usu-
ally vinegar, to safely convert your low-acid foods (those with a pH level 
over 4.6) to high-acid foods (with a pH level of 4.6 or less). The brining 
solution extracts juice and sugar from your food, forming lactic acid, a 
bitter-tasting, tart acid. Lactic acid is the preservative in your pickled food. 
Preparing your recipe as it’s written makes processing your food in a water-
bath canner safe.

64
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
Preparation methods for your pickled food include the following:
 
 Long brine: This process is primarily used for making pickles from 
cucumbers. The brine solution is quite heavy with salt and may contain 
some vinegar and spices. In a long brine, you submerge the food in the 
brine solution where it ferments (stays in the solution) for anywhere 
from five days to six weeks. (Your recipe gives you the details.) After 
fermenting, follow your recipe and make a fresh brine solution for filling 
your jars.
 
 Short brine: The soaking period for this method is 24 hours or less. 
Follow your recipe for the correct proportions in your brine solution. 
Prepare a fresh solution for filling your jars.
 
 Complete precooking: In this method, you cook your food completely 
before filling your jars.
 
 A fresh (or raw) pack: In this method, fresh raw vegetables are placed 
in prepared jars and then covered with hot, flavored liquid — usually a 
spicy vinegar — and processed in your water-bath canner.
 
Old-time canning recipes may instruct you to “soak your pickles in salt brine 
strong enough to float an egg.” This equates to a 10-percent brine mixture of 
1 pound (about 11/2 cups) of salt dissolved in 1 gallon of water.
When you’re brining, keep these pointers in mind:
 
 Keep your food completely submerged in the brine solution, whether it’s 
for a few hours or longer, by placing a sealed, water-filled glass jar on 
top of your food. The jar applies pressure to keep the foods submerged 
when you cover your brining container.
 
 To maintain crispness, crunchiness, and firmness in your vegetables, 
add ice, preferably crushed ice, to your soaking solution during the 
soaking period. This technique works best for short brine soaking. Note: 
In older pickling recipes, you may see the addition of alum or pickling 
(slaked) lime. The recipes in this chapter don’t add either of these prod-
ucts because they aren’t necessary when you’re using modern canning 
methods.
 
 After the soaking period, drain your vegetables in a colander, following 
your recipe instructions for any rinsing. Some recipes instruct you to 
roll the drained food in clean kitchen towels to dry it. Doing so works 
well for larger pieces of food, but it doesn’t work with finely chopped 
relishes.

Packing and Filling Your Jars
The most important thing to do when you’re filling your jars is to release 
air bubbles that are trapped between the food pieces. Using a nonmetallic 
spatula, press back gently on the contents, going all the way around the jar 
(see Figure 3-1).
Releasing air bubbles may seem unimportant, but they can play havoc with 
your final product.
 
 Jar seals: Too much air in the jar from trapped air produces excessive 
pressure in the jar during processing, which interferes with sealing.
 
 Liquid levels: When air is trapped between your food pieces before seal-
ing the jars, the liquid level in the jars drops as the food is heated, leav-
ing too much headspace (the air space between the inside of the lid and 
the top of the food or liquid in your jar). Without the proper amount of 
liquid in the jars, the food floats and becomes discolored.
 
Never skip the step of releasing air bubbles. No matter how carefully you 
pack and fill your jars, you’ll always have some hidden bubbles.

T Sweet Pickle Relish
One advantage of homemade relish is mixing flavors you don’t find in commercially 
produced relishes. You may even wind up with a treat that your family prefers to the 
store-bought kind.
Preparation time: 25 minutes (not including soaking time)
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Processing time: 10 minutes
Yield: 7 half-pints or 3 pints
5 to 6 medium cucumbers
3 to 4 green and/or red bell peppers
3 to 4 medium onions
1/4 cup kosher or pickling salt
Cold water, about 4 to 6 quarts
3 cups granulated sugar
2 cups apple cider vinegar
21/2 teaspoons celery seeds
21/2 teaspoons mustard seeds
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
 1 Peel the cucumbers and remove the seeds. Finely chop them in a food processor ﬁ tted 
with a metal blade to measure 6 cups.
 2 Remove the stems and seeds from the bell peppers. Finely chop them in a food 
processor ﬁ tted with a metal blade to measure 3 cups.
 3 Remove the skin of the onions. Finely chop them in a food processor ﬁ tted with a metal 
blade to measure 3 cups.
 4 Combine the vegetables in a 5- to 6-quart bowl. Sprinkle them with salt and add cold 
water to cover the veggies. Cover the bowl; let the veggies stand at room temperature 
for 2 hours. Rinse the veggies with running water in batches in a colander. Drain well.
 5 Combine the sugar, vinegar, celery seeds, mustard seeds, and turmeric in a 5- to 
6-quart pot. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve 
the sugar. Add the drained vegetables and return the mixture to a boil. Reduce the 
heat to medium-high and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30 
minutes, or until most of the excess liquid has evaporated.
Making a Pickled Topper
Use this pickled treat anytime you’d use a relish: on a hamburger or hot dog, 
in tuna salad, or anytime you want to add flavor to a sandwich.

Pickled Cucumbers Are Just Pickles
Not all cucumbers are the same or can be pickled in the same way. The 
common salad cucumber, for example, has a dark-green, waxy skin that’s so 
thick the brine solution can’t penetrate the waxy coating. Use this cucumber 
when your recipe doesn’t specify “pickling cucumbers,” like the recipe for 
Mixed Pickled Veggies in this chapter. When you want pickles, use a pickling 
cucumber. The skin of a pickling cucumber is thin, not waxy, and is left on 
the cucumber. Pickling cucumbers are about 4 inches in length — smaller 
than salad cucumbers. Don’t eat pickling cucumbers raw; their flavor is 
extremely bitter.
 
For a few of these recipes, you need to seed a cucumber. To do so, peel the 
cucumber, cut it in half lengthwise, and then scoop out the seeds with a small 
spoon. Easy enough, huh?
 6 While your relish is cooking, prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and 
screw bands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. 
(For the full scoop on water-bath canning and detailed instructions on preparing and 
ﬁ lling your jars and testing the seals, see Book I, Chapter 2.)
 7 Spoon and lightly compact the hot relish into the prepared jars. Release any air 
bubbles (refer to Figure 3-1); then add more relish and liquid to maintain a headspace 
of 1/2 inch.
 8 Wipe the jar rims; then seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening 
the bands. Process your ﬁ lled jars in a water bath for 10 minutes from the point 
of boiling. Remove the jars from the boiling water with a jar lifter. Place them 
on a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, away from drafts. After the jars cool 
completely, test the seals. If you ﬁ nd jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and 
use them within 2 months.

Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 1 Wash your cucumbers. Leave them whole if they’re smaller than 4 inches in diameter. For 
larger cucumbers, cut them into slices or cut them lengthwise, in halves or quarters.
 2 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on water-bath 
canning and detailed instructions on preparing and fi lling your jars and testing the 
seals, see Book I, Chapter 2.)
 3 Combine the salt, water, and vinegar in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan. Bring the liquid to a 
boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Keep the liquid hot.
 4 Snuggly pack the cucumbers into your prepared jars. To each quart jar, add 1 teaspoon 
of pickling spices, 6 peppercorns, and 1 tablespoon of dill seed. To each pint jar, add 
1/2 teaspoon of pickling spices, 3 peppercorns, and 11/2 teaspoons of dill seed. If you’re 
using fresh dill, add a sprig or two to each quart or pint jar in between the inside edge 
of the jar and the cucumbers.
 5 Ladle the hot liquid into your fi lled jars, leaving a headspace of 1/2 inch in the quart jars 
and a headspace of 1/4 inch in the pint jars. Completely submerge the cucumbers in the 
liquid. If they protrude from the jar, adjust them until you have the proper headspace; 
otherwise, internal pressure may prevent the lids from properly sealing. Release any 
air bubbles with a nonreactive tool (refer to Figure 3-1). Add more liquid to the jar if 
the level drops after releasing the air bubbles.
 6 Wipe the jar rims; then seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
Process your fi lled jars in a water bath — 15 minutes for quart jars; 10 minutes for pint 
jars — both from the point of boiling. Remove the jars with a jar lifter. Place them on a 
clean kitchen or paper towel, away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the 
seals. If you fi nd ones that haven’t sealed, refrigerate and use within 2 months.
Vary It! For kosher-style dill pickles, add 2 cloves of peeled, halved garlic to each jar of 
pickles.
4 pounds pickling cucumbers
6 tablespoons kosher or pickling salt
3 cups distilled white vinegar
3 cups water
1 tablespoon whole mixed pickling spices
18 black peppercorns
3 tablespoons dill seed
Fresh dill sprigs (optional)

T Bread and Butter Pickles
Wait until you try these tartly sweet pickles. The onion pieces are an added bonus of 
flavor. These pickles certainly aren’t what you find at your supermarket.
Preparation time: 30 minutes (not including the soaking time)
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Processing time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 to 5 pints
4 pounds pickling cucumbers
4 small to medium onions
1/2 cup kosher or pickling salt
Ice water, about 4 to 6 quarts
5 cups granulated sugar
4 cups distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons mustard seed
21/2 teaspoons celery seed
11/2 teaspoons turmeric
 1 Slice the cucumbers into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Peel the onions and cut them in half 
lengthwise from the tip to the bottom core. Lay them on a cutting board, cut side down, 
and slice them, starting at the top of the onion, to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Place the 
cucumber and onion slices in a pickling crock or two 5- to 6-quart bowls. Sprinkle them 
with salt. Add ice water to cover the vegetables. Stir them once; then cover the bowl and 
let the veggies stand at room temperature for 3 hours. Transfer the veggies to a colander 
and rinse them thoroughly with running water (you may need to do this in more than 
one batch). Drain well. Roll the pieces in a clean, dry kitchen towel to partially dry them.
 2 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For the full scoop on water-
bath canning and detailed instructions on preparing and fi lling your jars and testing 
the seals, see Book I, Chapter 2.)
 3 Combine the sugar, vinegar, mustard and celery seed, and turmeric in an 8- to 10-quart 
pot. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar 
and mix the spices. Add the vegetables and return the mixture to a boil. Reduce the 
heat to medium-high and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes.
 4 Pack the hot pickles into the prepared jars, leaving a headspace of 1/4 inch. Add the 
hot liquid, leaving a headspace of 1/4 inch. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive 
tool (refer to Figure 3-1). Add more pickles and liquid to the jar, maintaining 1/4 inch of 
headspace for both the pickles and the liquid.
 5 Wipe the jar rims; then seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the 
bands. Process your fi lled jars in a water bath for 15 minutes from the point of boiling. 
Remove the jars with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen or paper towel, away 
from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals. If you fi nd jars that haven’t 
sealed, refrigerate them and use them within 2 months.

T Spiced Pickled Beets
Use beets that are small and tender, not larger than 2 inches in diameter. Purchase beets 
with the top leaves attached. If the leaves are wilted and quite dark, the beets aren’t 
fresh; continue your search for fresher beets.
Preparation time: 1 hour and 10 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Processing time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 to 5 pints
4 pounds beets
3 cups thinly sliced white or yellow onions 
(about 3 medium)
21/2 cups apple cider vinegar
11/2 cups water
2 cups granulated sugar
1 tablespoon mustard seeds
1 teaspoon kosher or pickling salt
1 teaspoon whole allspice
1 teaspoon whole cloves
3 cinnamon sticks, broken into pieces
 1 Trim your beets, leaving the taproots and 2 inches of the stems. Wash and drain the 
beets, using a stiff brush to remove any clinging soil. Cover the beets with water in a 
5- to 6-quart pot. Bring the water to a boil over high heat and cook the beets until they 
pierce easily with a fork, about 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the beets. Run cold water over 
them and remove the skin. Remove the stem and taproot. Slice the beets into 1/4-inch-
thick slices. Place the beets in a bowl; set them aside.
 2 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on water-bath 
canning and detailed instructions on preparing and fi lling your jars and testing the 
seals, see Book I, Chapter 2.)
 3 Place the onions, vinegar, water, sugar, salt, mustard seeds, allspice, cloves, and 
cinnamon sticks in a 5- to 6-quart pot. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat; reduce 
the heat and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes. Add your beet slices and simmer the 
mixture to heat the beets, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the cinnamon stick pieces.

rying — a preserving method that dates back to ancient times — is 
the oldest method known for preserving food. This process removes 
moisture from food by exposing it to a low temperature. Good air circulation 
assists in evenly drying the food.
Although you can use an electric dehydrator for dehydrating food, this chapter 
focuses on oven drying or sun-drying — methods everyone has access to.
Drying Fruit
Dried fruit has many uses — from snacks to sauces, dessert toppings to 
baked-good fillings. Many of the best fruits for this method oxidize and brown 
easily when their flesh is exposed to air, but you have some options for pre-
venting any color change in your fruit.
 
Using the best, perfectly ripened fruit for drying is important for a dried fruit 
that’s worthy of high marks and rave reviews. Most fruit is suited for drying. 
Fruits not recommended for drying include avocados, citrus fruits (except for 
the peel), crab apples, guavas, melons, olives, pomegranates, and quinces.
The time required for drying fruit ranges from a few hours to many days. 
As you may expect, an electric dehydrator gives you the shortest drying 
time, whereas sun-drying gives you the lengthiest (and it requires a lot of 
your attention and perfect weather conditions to boot). Oven-drying falls in 
between the two.
Drying time is determined by the moisture in your fruit, the size of your fruit 
pieces, the moisture in the air (even if you’re using an oven), and the pre-
treating method you choose. Larger pieces of fruit take longer to dry than

smaller pieces of the same fruit. Consequently, the smaller you cut your 
peaches or the thinner you slice your bananas, the less time you’ll need to 
produce a safely preserved dried product.
Pre-treating fruit
Pre-treating, which retards the enzyme activity in the fruit that causes it to 
ripen, makes your fruit look good by preventing oxidation and discoloration, 
the darkening of the fruit flesh after it’s exposed to air. Using a pre-treating 
method before drying your fruit isn’t as important as when you’re canning 
fresh fruit. In fact, it’s not necessary at all, but it does shorten the drying time.
Your pre-treating choices are as follows:
 
 Water blanching: This method is the best for maintaining a fruit’s bright 
color. Immerse the fruit in boiling water for a short period of time and 
then immediately plunge it into ice water to stop the cooking process. 
Drain the fruit well.
 
 Steam blanching: This method, which is the most common for fruit, 
helps the fruit retain more of its water-soluble vitamins and minerals 
than the water-blanching method does. The steam quickly heats the 
fruit, shortens the drying and rehydrating times, sets the color and 
flavor, and slows down the enzyme activity, in some cases killing micro-
organisms.
 
 Hang a colander on the inside edge of a pot of boiling water, making sure 
the colander doesn’t touch the water. Place your fruit in the colander 
and heat it as directed in your recipe. Cool your fruit quickly in a bowl of 
ice water; then drain the fruit well.
 
 Dipping: In this process, you immerse your fruit into a liquid or a solu-
tion to control the darkening. Dipping helps the fruit retain vitamins A 
and C, which are lost during the oxidation process. You can use any of 
these liquids:
 
• Lemon or lime juice: Fresh citrus juice is the most natural of the 
dipping solutions. Mix 1 cup of juice with 1 quart of water. Soak the 
fruit no longer than 10 minutes; drain thoroughly before drying.
 
• Ascorbic acid: This white, powdery substance is available in 
drugstores. Its common name is vitamin C. Dissolve 1 tablespoon 
of powder in 1 quart of water. Don’t soak your fruit longer than 1 
hour; drain it well before drying.
 
• Commercial antioxidants: You can find these products in super-
markets or wherever canning supplies are sold. Some common 
brand names are Fruit-Fresh and Ever-Fresh. Follow the directions 
on the product package for making your solution and determining 
the soaking time.

At one time, sulfuring fruit was popular for preserving fruit color and vita-
mins in dried fruit. Sulfur is unsafe for any drying method other than sun-
drying because the sulfur produces dangerous fumes of sulfur dioxide when 
it’s heated, as it would be if you used an oven. People with asthma or other 
allergies should avoid this product.
Evaluating dryness
Knowing when your fruit is properly dried is important. Normally, touching 
and tasting a cooled piece of fruit gives you the answer, but when you’re in 
doubt and you positively, absolutely need to know the moisture in your fruit 
has reduced enough, follow these basic steps:
 
1. Prepare your fruit and weigh the portion you’ll be drying.
 
 Suppose, for example, that you have 20 pounds of prepared peaches.
 
2. Look up the amount of moisture (water content) in your fruit from the 
fruit list in this chapter.
 
 According to the fruit list, you know that the water content of peaches is 
89 percent.
 
3. Determine the total water weight of your fruit.
 
 Multiply the weight of your prepared fruit before drying by the water 
content percentage from the fruit list in the section “Drying recipes, fruit 
by fruit.” For the peach example that’s
 
 20 pounds of peaches × 0.89 water content = 17.8 pounds of water.
 
4. Calculate the amount of water (by weight) that needs to be removed 
from the fruit during the drying process.
 
 Multiply your total water weight (your answer from Step 3) by 0.8 (the 
minimum amount of water you want to remove from your fruit during 
the drying process). Continuing with the example, that’s
 
 Total water weight of 17.8 × 0.8 = 14.24 pounds of water to remove.
 
5. Weigh your fruit when you think it’s done; then subtract the amount 
of the water you want removed (your answer from Step 4) from the 
total weight of the fruit you prepared for drying (your answer from 
Step 1).
 
 If your fruit weighs this amount or less, your processing is successful. If 
your fruit weighs more than this amount, return it for more drying. For 
the peach example:
 
 20 pounds of prepared fruit – 14.24 pounds of water to remove = 5.76 
pounds of dried fruit as your goal.

76
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
Properly dried fruit has 80 to 95 percent of its moisture removed.
Oven-drying fruit
If you have an oven — gas or electric — that maintains a temperature 
between 130 and 150 degrees with the door propped open, you’re ready to 
start drying.
 
To test your oven’s temperature, put an oven thermometer in the center of your 
oven with the door propped open. Your oven must maintain a temperature of 
130 to 150 degrees for one hour to safely dry food. Higher temperatures cook — 
rather than dry — the food.
This procedure for oven-drying is simple. Here’s a summary for drying fruit in 
an oven:
 
1. Preheat your oven to the temperature setting in your recipe.
 
2. Wash and prepare your food as directed in your recipe.
 
3. Place your food on the tray.
 
 Leave spaces between the pieces of food so that they’re not touching 
each other or the edge of the tray.
 
4. Place your filled trays in the oven.
 
 Leave the door propped open to allow moisture to escape from the oven.
 
5. If you’re using baking sheets or other trays without holes or openings 
in the bottom, turn your drying fruit.
 
 Turning your fruit ensures that it dries evenly. After the first side of the 
fruit has absorbed all the liquid on the top of the food, turn it over and 
repeat for the other side. After you’ve done so on both sides, turn the 
food occasionally until it’s done.
 
6. When your fruit appears to be done, completely cool one piece and 
test it for the level of doneness stated in your recipe.
 
7. Store your cooled food in plastic bags, glass containers, or rigid plas-
tic containers with airtight seals.
 
8. Label your bags or containers.
 
Don’t add fresh fruit to partially dried trays of fruit. The fresh fruit increases 
the humidity in the drying chamber and adds moisture back to your drying 
fruit. This adjustment in the humidity level affects drying and increases the 
drying time for both fruits.

Sun-drying fruit
Sun-drying lets you dry large quantities of food at one time but can take 
days — compared to hours in a conventional oven. In addition, you need 
perfect weather conditions — 85 degrees or warmer and low to moderate 
humidity for many consecutive days — which means that only a few 
climates are suitable for this method. You also need good air circulation, 
a minimum of air pollution, and insect control around the food.
If you’re willing to deal with the variances in weather conditions and the 
lengthy drying time, follow these steps:
 
1. Wash and prepare your food as specified in your recipe.
 
2. Line your drying trays (or racks) with a double layer of cheesecloth or 
nylon netting.
 
3. Place your food on the trays.
 
 Leave space between your pieces of food so they’re not touching 
another piece or the edge of the tray.
 
4. Cover your trays with a single layer of cheesecloth or nylon netting to 
protect your food from insects and dust.
 
 Stretch the cover tightly over the trays, not touching the food.
 
5. Place your filled trays on benches or tables in full sunlight.
 
 Check your trays at different times of the day, keeping them in full sun 
at all times. If your nighttime temperature varies more than 20 degrees 
from the temperature at the hottest part of the day, move your trays to a 
warmer area (indoors or an enclosed patio area) for the evening, return-
ing them outside when they can be in full sunlight. Relocate the trays if 
it rains, regardless of the temperature.
 
 If you use baking sheets or other trays without holes or openings in the 
bottom, you must turn your fruit to achieve an evenly dried product. 
After the first side of the fruit has absorbed all the liquid on the top of 
the food, turn it over and repeat for the other side. After you’ve done so 
on both sides, turn the food daily until it’s done.
 
6. Check your fruit daily for evidence of mold.
 
7. When your fruit appears to be done, completely cool one piece and 
test it for the level of doneness listed in your recipe.
 
8. Store your cooled food in plastic bags, glass containers, or rigid plas-
tic containers with airtight seals.
 
9. Label your bags or containers.

Drying recipes, fruit by fruit
Properly dried fruit produces a superior product for use at a later time. After 
your fruit is dried, properly labeled, and stored, you’ll find it hard to believe 
that 10 pounds of fresh apples produces only 11/2 pounds of dried apples!
Apples
 
 Varieties: Apples with tart flavors and firm texture dry best. Some good 
choices are Pippin, Granny Smith, Jonathan, and Rome Beauty.
 
 Preparation: Wash, peel, and core your apples. Slice into rings, 1/4- to 
1/2-inch thick.
 
 Pre-treating: Dipping (refer to “Pre-treating fruit,” earlier in this chapter).
 
 Drying time: Dehydrator or conventional oven: 130 to 135 degrees for 6 
to 8 hours. Sun-drying: 2 to 3 days.
 
 Testing for doneness: Soft, pliable, and leathery. Water content: 84 
percent.
Rehydrating your dried fruit
Most dried fruit is used just as it’s stored after 
the drying process. It’s great when added to 
hot or cold cereal or baking batters. It’s also 
perfect if you’re always on the go, because it 
travels well and can be eaten right out of the 
container.
If you prefer your dried fruit a bit chewier, 
soften or rehydrate it. Rehydrating is the 
process of adding moisture back to the fruit. 
Use rehydrated fruit right away because it’s 
not dry enough to go back on the shelf without 
spoiling.
Your rehydrating options are as follows:
  Boiling water: Place the desired amount of 
fruit in a bowl. Cover the fruit with boiling 
water, allowing it to stand for 5 to 10 min-
utes to plump, or add moisture, to your fruit. 
Use this method when adding fruit to jams, 
chutney, or baked goods. Substitute fruit 
juice or wine for water.
  Steaming: Place your fruit in a steamer or a 
colander over a pot of boiling water (refer 
to steam blanching earlier in this chapter). 
Steam your fruit for 3 to 5 minutes, or until 
the fruit plumps.
  Sprinkling: Put your fruit in a shallow bowl. 
Sprinkle the fruit with water or fruit juice. 
Allow it to soak in the moisture. Repeat the 
process until the fruit reaches the level of 
moistness you desire.

T Fruit Leather
Fruit leather is dried pureed fruit, rolled up in plastic. The result is a chewy, fruity, 
taffylike treat. Some good choices for fruit leathers are apples, apricots, berries, 
cherries, nectarines, peaches, pears, pineapple, and plums.
Preparation time: 20 minutes or longer (determined by the amount of fruit you’re 
pureeing and the preparation involved preparing the fruit for pureeing)
Drying time: Depends on the amount of moisture in your fruit; allow up to 18 hours in a 
conventional oven.
Yield: 1 cup of fruit puree makes 2 to 3 servings; 21/2 cups covers an 18-x-14-inch area, 
1/4-inch thick (see Tip at the end of this recipe)
Fresh fruit of your choice
Water or fruit juice (optional)
Corn syrup or honey (optional)
Ground spices (optional), choose from allspice, 
cinnamon, cloves, ginger, mace, nutmeg, or 
pumpkin pie spice (Use 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon for 4 
cups of puree.)
Pure extract ﬂ avors (optional), choose from 
almond, lemon, orange, or vanilla (Use 1/4 to 1/2 
teaspoon for 4 cups of puree.)
 1 Cover your drying trays or baking sheets with a heavy-duty, food-grade plastic wrap. 
If your dehydrator comes with special sheets for your trays, use those.
 2 Wash your fruit and remove any blemishes. Prepare your fruit as directed in the 
guidelines for preparing your fruit in this chapter.
 3 Puree the fruit in a blender until smooth. Strain out any small seeds, if desired, with 
a mesh strainer or a food mill. If your puree is too thick, add water or fruit juice, 1 
tablespoon or less at a time. If your puree is too tart, add corn syrup or honey, 1 
teaspoon at a time. If you’re adding spices or other ﬂ avorings, add them now.
 4 Spread the puree evenly onto the prepared trays to a thickness of 1/8-inch in the 
center and 1/4-inch around the edges. If you use cooked fruit, it must be completely 
cool before spreading it on the trays.
 5 Dry your fruit leather at a temperature of 135 degrees in a dehydrator or 140 degrees 
in a conventional oven. Dry the fruit until it’s pliable and leathery, with no stickiness 
in the center.
 6 Roll the warm fruit leather, still attached to the plastic, into a roll. Leave the rolls 
whole, or cut them into pieces with scissors. Store the rolls in a plastic bag or an 
airtight container.
Tip: Here’s an idea of how much fresh fruit you’ll need for one cup of puree: apples, 1/2 to 
3/4 pounds (about 2 to 3) for 1 cup; apricots or peaches, 3/4 to 1 pound (about 6 apricots 
or 2 to 3 peaches) for 1 cup; strawberries, 1 pint of strawberries for 1 cup.

Drying Herbs
If you grow your own herbs or love strolling through local farmers’markets 
and smelling the lingering aromas of rosemary, basil, parsley, lemon verbena, 
and whatever else was brought to market, you’ve probably found yourself 
having more herbs than you’ve known what to do with. Air-drying herbs is 
easy and the perfect solution for saving your fresh herbs.
Presenting your step-by-step guide
 
If you’re harvesting herbs from a garden, do so in the morning after the mois-
ture on the leaves has dried. Also, cut the stems — don’t pick them — leaving 
an extra inch or two for tying them in bunches.
Follow these steps for drying herbs:
 
1. Rinse your herbs and pat them dry with a paper towel.
 
 Dip them quickly in a bowl of cool water and shake off the excess water. 
Be sure to get them completely dry to prevent mildew.
 
2. Using cotton string or thread, tie the herb stalks near the cut part of 
the stem in small bunches (no more than five or six stems).
 
 Don’t mix your herb bunches, because flavors transfer during the 
drying process.
 
 If you want to protect the herbs from sunlight and catch loose seeds for 
planting, put the tied herb bundle in a paper bag with holes or slits cut 
in it for air circulation. Place the herb bundle upside down in the bag 
with the stems toward the top opening of the bag. Tie the top of the bag 
closed.
 
3. Hang the herbs (or the herb bag) upside down in a warm room — the 
kitchen works well — near a south-facing window and out of direct 
sunlight.
 
 Your herbs will dry in two to three weeks with good air circulation. You 
know your herbs are dry when they crumble easily.
 
4. When your herbs are dry, remove the leaves from the stems.
 
 Crush soft leaves (like basil, sage, and oregano) by hand. Leave harder 
leaves (like rosemary, tarragon, and thyme) whole, crushing them with a 
rolling pin before using them.
 
5. Store your dried herbs in small containers.
 
 Glass jars with tight-fitting lids work best. For your herbs to maintain the 
best flavor during storage, keep them away from heat, light, and your 
refrigerator.

Using your dried herbs
 
When adding dried herbs to your food, remember that less is best. Dried 
herbs are stronger than fresh herbs. You can always add flavor, but it’s dif-
ficult to remove too much of a flavor. Following are two recipes:
 
 Herb butter: Combine your favorite herbs and roll a stick of butter in 
them to coat the stick, or soften the butter to room temperature and mix 
the dried herbs directly into the butter. Chill the butter; cut it into slices, 
or make rounds with a melon baller for serving.
 
 Rice mix: Package ready-to-make mixes with your freshly dried herbs. 
Combine the following in a bowl: 1 cup of long-grain rice, 2 teaspoons 
bouillon granules (chicken, beef, or vegetable), 2 to 3 teaspoons of one 
or more dried herbs, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Transfer the mix to a 
glass container or clear, food-safe bag. Seal the jar or tie the bag closed. 
Add a card with the following instructions:
 
 “Add the rice mix to 2 cups of water in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan. Bring the 
rice to a boil over high heat, stir, cover, and reduce the heat to medium-
low. Cook for about 30 minutes without peeking. Remove the rice from 
the heat (don’t lift that lid to peek) and let it stand for 30 minutes. Fluff 
the rice with a fork and serve immediately.”
Making Jerky
Beef or turkey jerky is a wonderful taste treat. Homemade jerky is superior in 
quality and flavor to most commercial brands, and it’s easy to make. A favorite 
cut of meat to slice for jerky preparation is flank steak. Whatever your personal 
preference, figure that 3 pounds of meat yields approximately 1 pound of jerky.
To make your own beef or turkey jerky, follow these steps:
 
1. Firm up the cut of meat in the freezer before you begin slicing.
 
 Your goal isn’t to freeze the meat completely, just enough to help you 
make the cuts more even.
 
2. Remove any excess fat; then slice the meat across the grain to a thick-
ness between 1/8 and 1/4 inches.
 
3. Marinate the sliced meat overnight in a refrigerator in a tightly sealed 
container.
 
 Teriyaki marinade tastes yummy, and you can make it easily enough by 
combining 1 cup of soy sauce, 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar, 2 teaspoons 
of ginger, 4 to 6 cloves of crushed garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon of freshly 
ground black pepper.

86
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
4. Spray your oven racks with a vegetable spray and then spread the 
strips of meat across the racks.
 
 Be sure to place a sheet of aluminum foil over the bottom of the oven to 
catch the drippings — unless of course you particularly enjoy creating 
an awful mess.
 
5. Set your oven temperature to 140 degrees, the ideal temperature for 
drying meat.
 
 You’ll need an internal oven thermometer because on most ovens, 140 
degrees is toward the middle setting of the warm label on the knob — 
not particularly precise.
 
6. Prop the oven door open a few inches so that the moisture can 
escape easily.
 
7. Let the meat dry for approximately 8 hours.
 
 When it’s done, the jerky should be dry, but not brittle, to the touch.

over a fire.
Although you can fix dinner outside using a two-tiered gas grill with an electric 
side range, in this chapter, outdoor cooking means something a bit different. 
Namely, it means getting back to basics and enjoying the great outdoors, 
whether you’re cooking in your own backyard or at a campsite.
Anyone can cook in the great outdoors, preparing everything from simple 
one-dish entrees and desserts to complete multicourse meals. Doing so suc-
cessfully isn’t rocket science. It just takes some hot coals, the right tools, and 
a few tricks up your sleeve. This chapter tells you what you need to know 
and includes easy recipes for the beginning camp cook.

Outdoor Cooking Techniques
Cooking outdoors can be as authentic or as convenient as you want it to be. 
After all, technically speaking, you can place your cookware inside a covered 
barbecue grill, set the temperature to whatever you want, and call yourself 
an outdoor cook. Most people, however, use one of the following techniques:
 
 Cooking a single dish over hot embers or coals: This is the easiest 
cooking technique for the beginning outdoor cook, because you only 
have to manage a single dish at a time.
 
 Stacking pans over hot embers or coals to cook more than one dish 
at a time: This technique lets you cook plenty of food without taking up 
any more ground space than single-dish cooking requires (see Figure 
5-1). You actually stack your Dutch ovens on top of each other over a 
heat source. The food that requires the most heat goes on the bottom 
of the stack, and the food that requires the least goes on top. As you 
gain more experience with outdoor cooking and want to broaden your 
repertoire, you may find yourself stacking pans.

 Chapter 5: Outdoor Cooking
Book I
Country 
Kitchen 
Skills
 
 This technique works best for foods that require an even distribution 
of heat rather than foods that require the heat source to come primar-
ily from the top or the bottom of the pan. (Refer to the section “Heat 
sources and cooking methods,” later in this chapter, for information.)
 
 A challenge in stacked cooking is that if you want to check or stir a dish 
that isn’t on the top of the heap, you have to move all the pans above it. 
Of course, some would argue that this is part of the fun.
 
 Cooking in a pit: If you’re so inclined, you can actually bury a Dutch 
oven in a pit of coals. In this method, you build a fire in a hole that 
you’ve dug and lined with aluminum foil or stone and, when the coals 
are ready, place your covered dish inside, cover it with dirt and more 
coals, and let it cook. This cooking technique is slow. Most dishes 
cooked by this method take 4 to 6 hours. It’s best reserved for dishes 
that don’t need to be tended and that (for obvious reasons) are covered.
Rounding Up the Hardware
When you cook outdoors, chances are you’re cooking over an open fire or in 
coals. If that’s the case, use cast iron. Cast-iron cookware travels well, cooks 
evenly, and cleans up easily — just what you need when you’re cooking out-
doors. It can also tolerate direct contact with the heat source, which, given 
the outdoor cooking methods outlined in the preceding section, is a good 
thing. (Note: If you plan to cook on a camp stove, you can use aluminum pans 
rather than cast iron, if you prefer.) The following sections outline the cook-
ware and accessories you need for outdoor cooking.
 
Although you can use any kind of cast-iron cookware you have for cooking 
outdoors, most people rely on one or two pieces: Dutch ovens (called camp 
ovens when they’re designed for outdoor use) and skillets with lids. With 
either of these pieces, you can cook any dish. (Note: All the recipes in this 
chapter use a skillet or a Dutch oven.)
A camp oven
Although you can use any Dutch oven outside, the type that has legs and a 
flanged lid, called a camp oven, makes outdoor cooking a little easier. The 
legs let you keep the Dutch oven itself off the coals (and thus avoid getting 
the cookware too hot), and the flanged lid lets you put coals on top without 
worrying about them rolling off onto the ground or, when you lift the lid, into 
your food. The recipes in this chapter are intended for outdoor cooking, so 
many of them recommend that you use a camp oven.

90
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
If you’re shopping for a camp oven, look for one that has a reversible lid. These 
lids function as both a lid and, when flipped over, a griddle. The griddle side 
is usually slightly concave, which keeps anything you cook in it — pancakes, 
eggs, bacon, and so on — from spilling or dripping over into the coals.
A skillet with legs and a lid
Like Dutch ovens, you can also find skillets with flanged lids and legs that 
keep the bottoms of the pans off the hot coals.
 
If you don’t want to spring for skillets and ovens designed specifically for 
outdoor use, you can use a spyder (essentially a cast-iron trivet) to turn any 
stovetop cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven into an outdoor cooking machine. 
See the next section, “Going for convenience and comfort,” for more info on 
spyders.
Going for convenience and comfort
Although the following items aren’t absolutely necessary when you cook 
outside, they can make your task a little easier and safer:
 
 Brush: You use a brush to remove ashes and coals around your pan and 
on top of the pan’s lid. Any plain old ash brush will do.
 
 Oven gloves: These gloves are essentially extra-long, extra-thick, fire-
resistant oven mitts that are sometimes made of leather.
 
 Long utensils: You want utensils that are as long as possible but still 
comfortable and safe to wield. The longer the utensil, the farther from 
the fire you are. You need the standards — spoon, spatula, meat fork, 
and anything else you need to stir, turn, or prod your food. You may 
also want to invest in a pair of tongs or a poker that lets you move 
charcoal coals around safely.
 
 Heavy-duty aluminum foil or metal trash can lid: Although not a neces-
sity, using aluminum foil or an upside-down aluminum trash can lid 
(placed in such a way that it doesn’t wobble) can help you control the 
temperature of the coals, especially if the ground is damp or cool. See 
the section “Making adjustments for weather conditions” later in this 
chapter for more information.
 
 Lid hook: Also called a lid lifter, this tool, shown in Figure 5-2, lets you 
remove the lid from your camp oven or skillet without spilling coals and 
ashes into your dish. Because it’s generally long (around 18 inches), it 
also keeps you away from the heat (not to mention keeping the hair on 
your arms intact!). Lid hooks come in a variety of lengths. Choose the 
longest one you can that still lets you comfortably lift the lid.

 Spyder: Shown in Figure 5-3, a spyder (also known as a trivet or lid 
stand) is a three- or four-legged stand that can hold your pans over 
the fire as the food cooks. A spyder functions as the “legs” for any flat-
bottomed cast-iron cookware you may have, essentially turning it into 
outdoor cookware. Just place the spyder over the coals and your pan 
on top of the spyder. Instant legs! A spyder can also serve as a place 
to set a hot lid when you’re checking on the food. Spyders come in 
varying heights.

 You may want to have two or three spyders of different heights so that 
you can adjust how close your pan is to the coals.

92
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
 Charcoal chimney starter: A charcoal chimney starter (see Figure 5-4) 
is beneficial for starting hot coals. It also serves the purpose of keeping 
extra coals ready and nearby as you cook, because you may need to 
replenish the hot coals that you use, especially for dishes that cook for a 
long time.

Temperature Control
In principal, outdoor cooking is just like indoor cooking: Using the right cook-
ware and the right temperature, you can make any dish your heart — or your 
hungry brood — desires. The main difference between the two is how you 
control the temperature. Your stove has control dials; the rocks or grassy hill 
that you build your campfire on — even the fire pit in your own backyard — 
probably doesn’t.
When you’re cooking outside, your heat source is either wood or charcoal 
briquettes. Although some people prefer wood embers, most prefer charcoal 
because it lasts longer and gives you more even heat. For that reason, the 
recipes in this chapter refer only to charcoal.
 
Charcoal coals generally give you between 45 minutes and an hour’s worth of 
cooking time, provided that the day isn’t windy, which can make the coals burn 
faster. Avoid charcoal that comes presoaked in lighter fluid: It burns faster.

93
 Chapter 5: Outdoor Cooking
Book I
Country 
Kitchen 
Skills
 
When you cook outside, you generally don’t put your cookware over an 
open flame. With an open flame, the only way that you can control the cook-
ing temperature is to lift and lower the pan, a task that, although possible, 
isn’t easy. (To make raising and lowering the vessel manageable, you need a 
tripod or cooking rig.)
The heat source isn’t the only added variable when you move from the cozy 
confines of your kitchen to the great outdoors (or the great backyard). You 
also have to contend with air temperature, wind, humidity, and the other 
climactic conditions that Mother Nature doles out. Temperature control in 
outdoor cooking is as much an art as it is a science. You control cooking 
temps via the following:
 
 The number of coals
 
 The location of the heat source
 
 Adjustments for weather conditions
 
 Your cooking techniques
The following sections go into much greater detail about each of these 
variables.
 
The best way to figure out how to control your cooking temperatures is 
simply to practice and experiment. Before you know it, you’ll be cooking up a 
storm — maybe even in a storm.
Number and placement of coals
The number of coals you use and where you put them are key factors in con-
trolling the temperature when you cook in a camp oven. For some cooking 
techniques (boiling, frying, and sautéing, for example), you put all of your 
coals under the pan. For these techniques, obviously, you don’t need a lid. 
For other techniques (such as baking and simmering), you arrange some 
coals on top (hence, you need a lid) and some coals underneath, as shown in 
Figure 5-5. Simple enough.
Well, almost. Keep reading for explanations of the finer points.

Counting coals
All the recipes in this chapter, and many recipes in other outdoor cooking 
books, tell you how many coals to place on the lid and how many to place 
underneath your camp oven or skillet to get the appropriate temperature.
Converting old recipes
Many old recipes don’t specify temperature set-
tings. Instead, they offer vague descriptions — 
to the modern cook’s thinking, anyway. If you 
find old recipes — a common occurrence 
when you go hunting specifically for cast-iron 
or outdoor recipes — don’t be surprised if the 
only temperature guide is “Cook (whatever) in a 
slow oven until done.” The following table pro-
vides modern equivalents for some of the vague 
terms you may encounter.
Description 
Temperature Equivalent
Slow 
250–350 degrees
Moderate 
350–400 degrees
Hot 
400–450 degrees
Very hot

The trick is figuring out how many coals you need when the recipe doesn’t 
specify. Fortunately, cooking temperatures are about the same for indoor 
conventional ovens as they are for outdoor cooking. So if you’d roast a 
chicken indoors in a 325-degree oven, you’d use the same temperature when 
you roast a chicken outdoors. Table 5-1 shows you how many coals you need 
to attain certain temperatures. The next section, “Heat sources and cooking 
methods,” tells you where to put these coals for different cooking techniques. 
With this info, you can convert indoor oven recipes (baking, roasting, and so

To increase the temp, you simply add coals; to decrease the temp, you 
remove them. Although not precise, assume that every coal adds between 10 
and 20 degrees of heat. When you just want to keep your food warm, remove 
all the coals except for a few under and over the dish.
 
These guidelines are just that — guidelines. If no other factor impacts the 
actual heat of the coals, the conversions in Table 5-1 are pretty accurate. But 
add in the factors that often affect cooking temperatures outdoors (wind, air 
temperature, and so on), and you’re going to have to make adjustments. To 
find out how to do so, see the section “Making adjustments for weather con-
ditions” later in this chapter.
Heat sources and cooking methods
After you know how many coals you need total (see the preceding section, 
“Counting coals,” for tips), you need to figure out where they should go: on 
the lid of your pan, underneath it, or both. How you divide the coals and 
where you place them depend on your cooking method. If you’re baking, for 
example, you need the heat to surround your pan; if you’re frying, all the heat 
should come from underneath. Table 5-2 outlines where to place your coals 
for various cooking methods.

Spacing out: Oooh, pretty patterns!
When you know how many coals you need and where they should go (as 
explained in Tables 5-1 and 5-2), you need to arrange them properly. You 
can’t just lump a bunch of coals under the pan and slap another bunch of 
coals on top. If you do, you create hot spots that can either burn your food or 
make it cook unevenly. Here’s how to arrange your coals:
 
 For coals under the pan: Space the coals evenly in a circular pattern, 
starting at least 1/2-inch within the outer edge of the pan’s bottom.
 
 For coals on the lid: Space the coals evenly in a checkerboard pattern.
Making adjustments for 
weather conditions
In addition to figuring out how many coals to place where (see Tables 5-1 and 
5-2), you have to take the weather into account. The air temperature, wind 
speed, humidity levels, ground temperature, and so on can affect the tem-
perature of your coals. With this information, you can add or subtract coals 
as necessary to get the temperature that you want.
Your coals will burn hotter if
 
 You have warm breezes or wind.
 
 You’re cooking in direct sunlight.
 
 The air temperature is high.

97
 Chapter 5: Outdoor Cooking

Skills
Your coals will be cooler if
 
 The humidity is high.
 
 You’re cooking in the shade.
 
 You’re cooking at high altitudes.
 
 The ground temperature is cool, or the ground is damp.
 
To take ground temperature out of the mix, consider not putting your coals 
directly on the ground. Instead, use heavy-duty aluminum foil, an old char-
coal grill pan, or an overturned aluminum trash can lid as a base for your 
fire. If you find that you cook outdoors a lot, you may want to use a metal 
table specifically designed for outdoor cooking. The table has a lip around 
the edge that keeps your coals from falling off and a metal wall on three sides 
that keeps the wind away. Such a table accomplishes what the other bases 
do; plus, because you’re cooking on a table, you don’t have to bend over all 
the time.
More Tips for the Outdoor Cook
Cooking outdoors isn’t rocket science, but it does take a little special know-
how. With the basic knowledge outlined in this chapter and the following 
tips, chances are, your outdoor cooking experience will be a positive one:
 
 When you estimate outdoor cooking times, don’t forget to figure in how 
long it takes to get your coals ready. For charcoal, start your coals 15 to 
20 minutes before you need them.
 
 If a dish takes a long time to cook, have hot coals available to replenish 
the ones you use up. (A charcoal chimney starter is good for this; see 
the section “Going for convenience and comfort” earlier in this chapter 
for more on this product.) Add new coals when the old coals start to 
break up. When you add new coals, increase the amount proportionally 
on both the top and bottom. Don’t add only to the top, for example, or 
your food will cook unevenly.
 
 To keep the cooking temperature even within the pan or Dutch oven, 
rotate the lid and the pan in opposite directions regularly. Every 10 to 
15 minutes, give the lid a quarter turn in one direction and the pan or 
Dutch oven a quarter turn in the other direction.
 
 If you have to move coals around (and chances are you will, either to 
replenish the coals you’ve used up or to increase or decrease the tem-
perature by adding and removing coals), use long-handled tongs and 
wear thick oven mitts. After all, you’re playing with fire, and what fun is 
cooking outdoors if you spend all of your time indoors rubbing salve on 
your burns?

98
Book I: Country Kitchen Skills 
 
 When you rotate the lid or remove it to check on your dish, be careful 
not to let ashes from the lid drop into your food. When the dish is done, 
go ahead and brush the ashes away entirely.
 
When you’re first starting out, start simple. Although you can cook anything 
in a Dutch oven, try your hand at easy dishes (stew, chili, cobbler, and 
roasted chicken, for example) first. The recipes in this chapter are all great 
beginner recipes: easy to assemble, easy to make, and delicious.
Experimenting with Some 
Favorite Recipes
Favorite outdoor recipes share two key characteristics:
 
 They tend to use ordinary ingredients — nothing fancy or hard to find. 
In fact, most ingredients in typical outdoor fare are those that the major-
ity of cooks already have on hand.
 
 They generally use cooking methods that don’t require a lot of attention. 
It’s safe to say you’ll never have to stir a sauce over low heat to avoid 
curdling; typically, in outdoor cooking you dump or layer everything in a 
skillet or Dutch oven and let it go.
You may suspect that such inauspicious beginnings can only lead to unin-
spired dishes. Au contraire. Maybe it’s the environment: velvety skies, whis-
pering leaves, air filled with the scent of pine, and a fire to warm yourself by. 
Maybe it’s the company: friends and family simply enjoying nature together. 
But many outdoor cooks swear up and down that nothing tastes better than a 
meal cooked in the great outdoors.
The recipes in this section give you a sampling of some great outdoor 
dishes — entrees, sides, a couple of desserts, and a breakfast that will get 
even the pokiest riser up bright and early.

Pork Chops ’n’ Potato Sauce
Pork chops come from the loin portion of a hog, and where they’re located on the loin 
determines both the quality of the meat and its price. So when you go shopping for 
pork chops, keep in mind these differences: Loin chops have meat on both sides of the 
bone and are the least fatty and the most expensive. A center cut chop has little to no 
meat on one side of the bone, but the meat on the other side of the bone is nice and 
lean. End chops are fattier and don’t have the nice, lean meat portion that the other 
chops offer; they’re the least expensive.
Briquettes: 28
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 45 to 60 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Vegetable oil
4 pork chops, about 1/4-inch thick
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
2 potatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick
1 can (11 ounces) condensed cream of mushroom 
soup
 1 Add the oil to a 14-inch cast-iron camp oven, over 28 hot (gray) coals. Brown the pork 
chops on both sides. Remove the chops.
 2 Sauté the onions. Pull out the onions, lay the chops back in, and spread the onions 
over the chops. Lay the potato slices evenly over the onions.
 3 In a bowl, mix the condensed soup with 1/2 can of water and pour the mixture over the 
ingredients.
 4 Reduce the briquettes to about half and simmer until the chops and potatoes are fork 
tender.

Campsite Beef Stroganoff
When you make traditional beef stroganoff, you prepare everything in stages, cooking 
the meat first, adding the sauce mixture next, and adding the sour cream last. You cook 
the noodles separately, and then you combine everything just before serving. In this 
recipe, after you brown the meat, you cook everything (including the noodles) together. 
The result is stroganoff that’s as yummy and delicious as the original — without the 
work or attention.
Briquettes: 25
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 50 to 60 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
2 pounds extra-lean ground beef
1 medium onion, chopped
1/4 teaspoon celery salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
Salt and pepper
3 cans (8 ounces each) tomato sauce
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup sour cream
1 bag (12 ounces) egg noodles
 1 Brown together the meat, onion, celery salt, garlic salt, salt, and pepper in a 12-inch 
cast-iron camp oven over 25 hot (gray) coals.
 2 While the meat is browning, mix together 11/2 cups of water, the tomato sauce, the 
Worcestershire sauce, and the sour cream in a medium bowl. (The sour cream won’t 
be completely blended, and the mixture will have a few lumps.)
 3 When the meat and onion are browned, spread the uncooked noodles evenly over the 
meat and onion. Pour the liquid mixture evenly over the noodles to moisten all the 
noodles well.
 4 Cover the oven with the lid and place 15 of the briquettes on top, leaving 10 
briquettes on the bottom.
 5 Cook for approximately 30 to 45 minutes, or until the noodles are fully cooked.

T Dutch Oven Veggies
Many people cook their vegetables first and add any seasoning or butter afterward. The 
result? Bland vegetables that get perked up as an afterthought. This recipe adds the 
seasoning and butter during the cooking process. Even without the cheese (which is a 
favorite of grown-ups and kids alike), the vegetables can stand on their own merits. Also, 
keep in mind that, in a pinch, you can substitute pregrated Parmesan cheese, but if you 
do, you’ll sacrifice flavor. Freshly grated Parmesan beats pregrated Parmesan hands 
down. Also, you can use virtually any vegetables you want with this recipe; simply make 
sure that you use 8 cups of veggies total and that you cut them into bite-size pieces.
Briquettes: 24
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 20 to 30 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
1 cup broccoli ﬂ orets
1 cup cauliﬂ ower ﬂ orets
1 cup baby carrots
1 cup mushrooms
1 cup onions, cut into bite-size pieces
1 cup bite-size bell pepper pieces
1 cup bite-size zucchini pieces
1 cup bite-size butternut squash pieces
Salt and pepper
1/4 pound butter
2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
2 cups grated fresh Parmesan cheese
 1 Put 1/4-inch water into the 12-inch cast-iron camp oven and add the veggies. Season 
generously with the salt and pepper — more than seems enough. Slice the butter on 
top of the veggies.
 2 Put the camp oven over 24 hot (gray) coals until the vegetable mixture is steaming; 
then pull out at least half of the coals. Steam the veggies until the carrots are tender.
 3 Take the oven off the coals, remove the water with a baster, cover the veggies with 
the grated cheeses, and put the lid on the oven. Serve when the cheese is melted.
Vary It! To make a lighter version of this recipe, use light butter and cheese that’s made 
with part skim rather than whole milk. To make it lighter yet, take away the cheese 
entirely.

T Baked Pears
Unlike many fruits, pears should ripen off the tree. The only time that you want a tree-
ripened pear is if the tree is in your front yard, and you’re picking the pear yourself. 
A tree-ripened pear that has been boxed and shipped across the country will be 
unpleasantly mushy by the time it hits your grocer’s produce section. When you’re 
buying pears, select the ones that feel firm but give slightly at the stem. You can leave 
them at room temperature to ripen the rest of the way. You’ll know they’re ready when 
the skin lightens and the aroma becomes noticeable.
Briquettes: 20 to 24
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 to 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
3 tablespoons butter
6 tablespoons light brown sugar
1 tablespoon cinnamon
6 crumbled butter cookies
1/2 cup pecan pieces
6 ﬁ rm Bartlett pears
Ground cloves
12 pecan halves
 1 Place 2 tablespoons of the butter in a 12-inch cast-iron camp oven and preheat using 
8 to 10 hot (gray) coals under the oven.
 2 In a bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, crumbled cookies, and pecan pieces.
 3 Cut the pears in half and gently scoop out the seeds, core, and stem. Sprinkle a pinch 
of ground cloves onto each pear half, being careful not to use too much (a little goes a 
long way!). Stuff each pear half with the brown sugar mixture.
 4 Place pear halves cut side up in the camp oven. Dot with remaining 1 tablespoon of 
butter and place a pecan half on each pear.
 5 Cover the oven with the lid and place the remaining 12 to 14 briquettes on top of the 
oven. Cook until hot, about 20 to 30 minutes. Serve while hot.

T Apple Crisp
This is a great recipe for fall, when apples are in season and at local produce stands. 
Of course, it’s (almost) equally appetizing any time of year with store-bought apples. 
The key is the apple. Good cooking apples, which don’t turn mushy or gritty, are Rome, 
Golden Delicious, and Winesap— varieties that are widely available.
Briquettes: 24
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 8 to 10 servings
10 cups peeled and sliced apples
1/4 cup lemon juice
3 tablespoons lemon zest
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup golden raisins
3/4 cup butter
11/2 cups brown sugar
11/4 cups all-purpose ﬂ our
11/2 cups oats
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon cardamom
 1 Combine the apples, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon lemon zest, sugar, and raisins in a 
bowl. Spread the apple mixture in the bottom of a 12-inch cast-iron camp oven and 
place over hot (gray) coals.
 2 In a medium bowl, combine the butter and brown sugar. Place the ﬂ our in a larger 
bowl and then cut the butter mixture into the ﬂ our. Stir in the oats, cinnamon, 
nutmeg, cardamom, and the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon zest. Top the apple 
mixture with this topping mixture.
 3 Cover the oven with the lid and place 16 coals on top, leaving 8 coals underneath. 
Continue cooking until the apples are cooked and the topping is brown, about 1 hour. 
Serve warm.

Traditional Crafts

“C
raft” is an interesting word, the meaning of which 
has, quite frankly, diminished over the centuries. 
Today it connotes little more than kitschy art made by 
people who have a little too much time (and construction 
paper) on their hands. But once it referred to products 
made by artisans and skilled tradesmen. These people — 
and the services and products they provided — were so 
important that during the Middle Ages, craft guilds were 
established for the sole purpose of protecting them.
And just who belonged to those craft guilds? Candle mak-
ers (called chandlers back then), embroiderers (broder-
ers), clothing makers (girdlers), and woolworkers 
(winders). Other traditional crafts, like knitting and quilt-
ing, served not only a utilitarian purpose but also an artis-
tic one. This book reintroduces you to the skills that many 
earlier craftspeople found both useful and inspiring.

he fleeces from fiber animals, such as sheep, goats, and alpacas, can 
yield some beautiful and unique garments or other knit items. Creating a 
beautiful sweater to wear is rewarding in and of itself. It’s even more satisfy-
ing when you can say not only that you knit it yourself, but you can add, “I 
even made the yarn, and this is from my llama Oggie!”
This chapter takes the fiber-animal owner through the process of getting 
the fiber off the critter and then getting the fiber into a form you can use in 
various applications, such as spinning, knitting, or felting. This chapter also 
includes a section on using the leftover bits to make fun and useful products. 
After all, one of the main tenets of country living is to avoid the waste of any 
resource.
Shear Brilliance: Collecting 
and Processing Fiber
If you have fiber animals (alpacas, some breeds of sheep and goats, llamas, 
and so on), you’re probably in it for the fiber. Of course, you may be raising 
the critters just because you like them, but why not use that fiber for some-
thing unique and truly homegrown? Read on for info on collecting an animal’s 
fleece and getting those fibers in top shape.

108
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
After you process the fiber, as explained in this section, you can do a number 
of things with it. You can spin it into yarn that can then be crocheted or knit-
ted into something yummy, you can weave it into something useful and beau-
tiful, or you can felt it into something wearable or otherwise functional. The 
later sections of this chapter explore your options.
Shave and a haircut: Getting 
the fiber off your critters
The first step toward attaining fiber you can use is getting the fleece off 
your animal, which you do by shearing. Not only does shearing allow you to 
collect an animal’s fleece, but it also makes the animal more comfortable in 
hot weather. This section runs through the basics of shearing your fleece-
producers. Note: You harvest the fiber from other, more exotic animals 
such as the yak or Angora rabbit, by combing the animal, but the focus here 
is on the more-common practice of shearing.
Choosing the tools
You can use electric or hand shears to shear (or cut) the fleece off your 
animals. Many people prefer hand shears because the experience is more of 
a bonding one. You’re with your animal for a longer time, and each minute 
makes the critter more accustomed to your being close. Also, there’s no 
whine of electrical shears to frighten the animal. Of course, using hand 
shears also makes the job go more slowly. (With electric shears, you can 
remove the fleece much more quickly, which may be a consideration if you 
have a large herd — or even if you have more than two or three and can’t 
afford the time hand shearing requires.)
Shearing can be challenging in that you have to subdue the animal, get the 
fiber off in a useable condition, and avoid cutting the animal’s skin. The fol-
lowing sections tell you what you need to know.
 
If you prefer not to do the shearing yourself, you can hire a professional. 
Each pro has his or her own unique tricks, and because the shearer does 
it so often, the shearer can be in and out in no time. Costs vary widely. For 
instance, a goat shearer may charge $7 per goat, and a llama/alpaca shearer 
may charge $25 per animal. However, the efficiency may be worth the cost.
Knowing when to shear
To get good quality fiber, you need to shear alpacas, llamas, and sheep once 
a year, usually in late spring or early summer, depending on your location. 
Fiber goats (such as the Angora) need to be shorn twice a year, usually in

late winter and late summer. Table 1-1 has some notes on fiber collection and 
also describes the official names of various types of fiber. (Technically, the 
term wool means fiber from a sheep.)

Here are some tips on choosing the shearing time:
 
 Shear the animal before the weather gets too hot. Being under all that 
heavy wool can get really hot in the summertime!
 
 Be consistent. If you decide May is the time to shear, you should shear 
in May every year so the fiber grows to its maximum length. If you sched-
ule a shearing for May after doing it in June the preceding year, the 
animals’ fleeces may not be quite long enough to be top quality because 
they’ll have grown for only 11 months.
 
 Shear a pregnant animal just prior to her giving birth. The birthing 
process is stressful on the animal, and stress reduces the quality of the 
fiber. For those animals that are pregnant in the springtime, have them 
shorn before the birth day.
 
 Wait for a dry spell. Wet fleece is too heavy and unworkable and can 
clog the shears. (Of course, weather quirks aside, the shearing season 
is a short one. If you’re hiring a professional, you’ll most likely need to 
make an appointment ahead of time.)
 
Shear on time! If you let the animals go too long without shearing or comb-
ing, you’re likely to end up with a fleece that’s all matted and isn’t useable for 
spinning into yarn.

Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Preparing for shearing day: Getting critters a little cleaner
Animals live outside. They lie in dirt or hay or worse. That means their beautiful 
coats get dirty. Before you can process the fleece into something you can felt or 
spin with a spinning wheel, all that dirt and other stuff need to be cleaned out. 
Cleaning the coat before shearing is easiest (but don’t despair; there are ways 
to do it after the shearing as well). Following are some suggestions:
 
 Let the animals stay in a clean, grassy pasture. If you have a pasture 
with some good grass cover, bring the animals into that pasture and let 
them hang out in the grass (instead of the dirt) for a few days to a week 
before shearing day.
 
 Hand-pick the dirt and debris out of the fleece. This is an option if you 
don’t have a clean pasture to place your animals in, but this method is a 
lot of work.
 
 Blow air through the fleece: Sheep’s fleece is in a tight crimp, but the 
fleeces of some animals, such as the llama or alpaca, benefit from being 
gently blown. This air helps get some of the bigger, looser foreign matter 
out of the fleece. Use something like a leaf blower or Shop-Vac on a low 
setting.
Tips for raising fiber animals
Depending on where in the country you live, 
several animals in the fiber category can give 
you some very fine and fancy fleeces. The won-
derful part about raising these animals is that 
you get to grow old with them (no need to go 
through the process of slaughtering) and still 
get something back for all those years of care 
and feeding. Here are just a few tips on raising 
fiber animals:
  Sicknesses can drastically reduce the qual-
ity of the fiber an animal produces. The fiber 
may not even be usable at the next shear-
ing. Attention to health is of utmost impor-
tance, especially with alpacas, which are 
quite expensive.
  A baby’s first shearing produces the soft-
est fiber. Males generally produce bigger 
fleeces than females, and those fleeces 
take longer to become coarse. Birthing has 
a lot to do with fiber quality, but that doesn’t 
mean the female fleeces aren’t good. 
Pregnant females should be shorn just prior 
to giving birth because this blessed event 
is a big stress-producer and thus a fiber-
destroyer.
  Stress equals not-so-good fiber, so if you 
just want the fiber and not babies, castrating 
the males is best because this procedure 
makes their coats softer due to reduced 
stress levels. (Competing for females and 
fighting with other males is hard work!)

111

Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
 
 Bathe your animals: Some people bathe their animals before shearing. 
Bathing critters can definitely help you end up with a cleaner fiber — 
provided, of course, they don’t go and roll in the mud immediately 
afterwards.
 
 Coat your animals: That is, put a little coat or sweater on the critters’ 
backs to protect the fleece.
A good, honest fleecing: Shearing day logistics
On shearing day, everybody has to be rounded up and individually brought 
into the shearing area. Smaller animals such as sheep and goats are easier 
to round up, and because they’re pretty small, shaving the fleece off doesn’t 
take that long. Larger animals like llamas take a bit longer, due to the surface 
area to shear as well as their trademark unwillingness to cooperate.
The shearing logistics are easy:
 
1. Delay the morning feeding.
 
 Don’t feed the animal on the morning of shearing day. Wait until the 
shearing is all over. Shearing is a little uncomfortable anyway, and if the 
critter has a full stomach, that only adds to the discomfort.
 
2. Catch one animal and bring the critter to the shearing area.
 
 A flat, clean surface such as a concrete driveway is a good place to 
shear. This surface easily allows you to pick up the shorn fleeces and 
clean up the leftovers.
 
 For llamas that aren’t handled regularly, shearing day may be the only 
time they get haltered and roped, so this can be traumatic for them. 
Unwilling llamas can spit, so stay out of the line of fire or be resigned to 
the fact that you’re going to get hit.
 
3. Shear off the heavy fleece (see Figure 1-1) and bag it.
 
 You want to take the blanket — the best part of the fleece, which goes 
over the animal’s back. Start at the neck and make cuts close to the 
skin (to get the longest fiber possible), radiating out across the sides 
and down to the tail. The idea is to try to take this blanket off in one big 
piece. Put it in a plastic garbage bag.
 
 The stuff you shear off the legs and neck may or may not be useable, but 
you can bag that separately. Label each bag according to its contents 
(for example, llama blanket, llama other, or alpaca blanket).
 
4. Take the newly shorn critter back to its pasture.
 
5. Sweep out the area after each animal has been shorn so you’re ready 
for the next one.

6. Clean and oil your shears so they’re ready for the next time you need 
to use them.
 
 If you are shearing the sheep for show or the sheep are very young, 
clean and sharpen the shears after every shearing. If the sheep are 
older and you are just shearing them for the product, you can clean and 
sharpen the shears every other shearing.
 
Figure 1-1: 
Shearing a 
sheep.
 
Most raw fleece can be stored forever, provided moths don’t chew it up and 
other animals don’t get into it. If you’re going to wait awhile before you clean 
and process the stuff (explained in the next section), you can leave it in the 
barn. However, the best way to treat fiber is to process it right away and then 
bring it in the house.
 
Sheep have a lot of lanolin in their fleece, giving it a greasy feel. Lanolin can 
affect the color of the fleece and can even show up as staining where differ-
ent levels of it have collected. It can also harden on shorn fleeces, making 
them difficult to clean. For these reasons, clean sheep fleeces right away.
Processing the fiber
Now that you have some potentially beautiful fiber materials in bags, what 
are you going to do with them? Why, get the fiber in useable shape, of course. 
That means picking through the fleece to select only the best stuff for pro-
cessing, and then cleaning it and turning it into something you can spin or 
felt from.

113
 Chapter 1: Making Fabrics from Animal Fibers
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
Processing fleeces involves three general tasks: preparing, cleaning, and 
carding. One option is to let somebody else do the work. Just hand over the 
bag of freshly shorn fleece and go back later to pick up the finished product. 
But if you want the sense of satisfaction that comes from doing it on your 
own, you can do the preliminary cleaning yourself.
Skirting: Separating the best from the not-so-good
After the animal has been shorn, you have to go through the fleece and pick 
out the not-so-great stuff. Skirting is the removal of the undesirable pieces 
from your raw fleece. Lay the fleece out on a clean surface and hand-pick out 
the following:
 
 Contamination: These particles includes veg (vegetable matter — all 
that dried-up hay stuck in the fleece), dung tags, and bits of wood, wire, 
and assorted junk that farmers leave lying about the farm that gets 
caught in the fleece when animals lie in it or rub up against it.
 
 You can also rig up a spinner, which is kind of like a giant salad spinner, 
to clean off veg.
 
 Kemp: These are fibers that don’t have the barbs that make spinning 
into yarn possible. They’re distinguishable because they’re brittle and 
straight with no crimp — more like stiff hair than soft wool.
 
 Second cuts: These are fibers that didn’t get cut all the way on the first 
try and are thus shorter, as well as other fibers of inconsistent length. 
You want the majority of the fibers to be the same length and the same 
diameter to get the best product. The best yarns are made from fleeces 
in which most of the individual fibers are the same length. Extra long 
fibers aren’t really an issue, but the short ones are because they can 
poke out of the yarn, giving it a fuzzy look and a prickly feel. Also, short 
fibers are often coarser.
  
 Even if all the fibers have the same length and fineness, they need to be 
a certain minimum length so the fibers stay together. Longer fibers have 
more surface area for contact, and thus form a stronger bond.
 
 Anything that’s matted or felted or parts that are very coarse: Part of 
the skirting process is to remove fiber that’s inconsistent with the char-
acteristics of the fleece.
 
White fleeces are very valuable because they can be dyed any color. If the 
tips of the hairs are a darker color, snip them off so you’re left with just pure 
white.

Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Scouring: Washing the fleece
Scouring means washing the fleece to remove dirt, suint (natural grease 
formed from dried perspiration in sheep fleeces), lanolin (a waxy substance), 
and other substances that may have become embedded in the animal’s fleece.
Let the washing machine or your bathtub help with this step:
 
1. Fill the washing machine (or bathtub) with hot water and liquid dish 
soap, about 1/2 cup per full tub.
 
 Dawn dishwashing liquid is a good choice because it chemically inter-
acts with the grease but isn’t alkaline like soap. (Dawn is what they use 
to wash birds that have been caught up in an oil slick, so it’s presumably 
gentle enough to use on fleeces.)
 
 Don’t use normal soap for scouring; it causes the fleece to felt.
 
2. Put the fleeces in light net bags.
 
 Bags that are designed for washing delicate lingerie in the washing 
machine work well. Fill the bags loosely. If you pack the stuff too tightly, 
there won’t be enough room for the water to circulate.
 
3. Lay the net bags in the water and let them soak for 20 minutes.
 
 Be sure to push the bags gently into the water until the fleeces are 
fully wet.
 
4. Remove the bags, let them drain, and put them into the sink to drain 
further.
 
 If you’re using a washing machine, you can return the fleeces to the 
machine for the spin cycle. This cycle, although it spins violently, 
doesn’t introduce agitation, so it’s a good way to remove a lot of the 
moisture in a short time.
 
 Agitation (along with heat) causes the fleece to felt, rendering it unus-
able for spinning.
 
5. Give the fleeces a second bath.
 
 I find that one bath isn’t quite enough, so repeat the process.
 
6. Rinse the fleeces.
 
 Repeat Steps 3 through 5 using clear water (do not use soap in this pro-
cess), for a total of two rinse cycles.
 
7. Gently lay the fleeces out to dry.
 
 If you have a nice, dry, sunny day, you may attempt to do this outside, 
but wind or curious animals can introduce some dirt back into the 
fleece, so indoor drying is recommended. A mesh, sweater-drying rack is 
ideal for this. Be careful if you have cats, because a fresh fleece may look 
like a wonderful new bed to them! Drying takes a few hours.

Carding and such: Brushing and combing
Carding means organizing a jumble of fibers so they’re more or less 
parallel. Carding can also remove some, but not all, the veg that thus far 
has eluded you. You can card by hand by using what looks sort of like a 
pair of big dog brushes (see Figure 1-2). Or, if you have a lot of fiber to 
process, you can send it off to the pros.
 
Figure 1-2: 
Carding by 
hand aligns 
individual 
fibers.
 
Depending on the quality and length of the fibers, you can get several distinct 
end products from carding:
 
 Clouds: If the fibers are short and form a weak fiber-to-fiber bond, the 
structure collapses because it can’t support its own weight. The result is 
a cloud. Spinning from a cloud is hard, so the best use for these fibers is 
probably needle felting (or some of the suggestions in the later section 
“Using Up All the Fiber Leftovers”).
 
 Batts: A carder collects the fiber on a special roller, laying down layer 
after layer of fibers, to create a batt. When the roller is full (or the batt 
has reached the desired loft), the batt’s broken, pulled off the roller, and 
left flat. People often roll batts in tissue paper to transport them.
 
 You can spin from batts, but it’s not as easy as spinning from rovings. 
Batts also work as stuffing; they look a lot like the quilt batts you buy 
in the store. They’re also great for wet felting. (See the later section 
“Locking the Fibers with Felting.”)
 
 Roving: A roving is a loose, rope-like preparation in which the fibers 
from the carder are gathered and then lightly drafted (pulled apart). You 
often find roving wound into balls or in center-pull bumps. This prepara-
tion requires the least amount of additional work before being spun by a 
hand spinner.

116
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
 The primary criterion for roving is that the roving has to be strong 
enough to survive the rigors of the bump-winder and stay intact when 
tugged at during the spinning process. Due to texture, the length of 
sheep’s wool that’s long enough to make roving may be much shorter 
than the length needed to make a good alpaca roving.
 
 Sliver: A sliver is similar to a roving, and the two terms are often used 
interchangeably. Some camps say that if you add a bit of a twist to a 
sliver, it becomes roving. Other camps say there isn’t a twist to the 
roving.
 
 Rolag: A rolag is made by using a pair of hand carders (as opposed to a 
commercial carder) to organize the fibers. You lay tufts of fiber across the 
teeth of one of the carders and brush them out with the other. When the 
fibers are nice and straight, you peel and roll them lengthwise from the 
bed of the carder. All the fiber comes out of the carder, and you end up 
with a roll of fiber.
 
Cuticle fibers are what make fibers cling to each other. Wool has a lot of 
rather prominent scales. Huacaya alpaca doesn’t have as many scales, and 
the scales aren’t as prominent as sheep’s wool scales. Suri alpaca and mohair 
have even fewer scales. The interlocking of these scales — fiber to fiber — is 
the mechanism that holds roving, batts, and, ultimately, yarn together.
 
The best way to store processed fiber is to put it in clear plastic garbage 
bags. Moths like darkness, and the clear bags let in too much light for their 
taste. Store the bags in an area where mice won’t chew through and cats or 
dogs won’t think it’s some other animal’s territory and thus want to pee on 
the fiber.
Dyeing in the Wool
Natural fibers such as wool can be easily dyed (well, easily in that the fibers 
permanently take the dye — it’s not always so easy to do procedurally). You 
can end up with fibers that are any number of colors from the rainbow, espe-
cially if you start out with a light color, such as white or light grey.
You can buy one of the tons of dyes available, or you can buy books that 
are full of recipes for making your own natural dyes from herbs or flowers. 
Making natural dyes can get complicated because you need a mordant (a 
substance that sets the dye on the wool and makes it permanent), glass pots, 
rubber gloves, and so on.
One fantastic dye is nontoxic, extremely easy to use, and can be found on 
the shelves of the local grocery store: Kool-Aid. Yep, wool and Kool-Aid were 

117
 Chapter 1: Making Fabrics from Animal Fibers
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
made for each other. And because Kool-Aid is a food item, you can use your 
regular kitchen pots and utensils to do the dyeing. Note: Kool-Aid works only 
on animal fibers, so don’t try to dye cotton with it.
You can dye unprocessed fleece, processed rovings, spun yarn, or even a fin-
ished knitted sweater. In the instructions that follow, the thing you’re dyeing 
is referred to as the wool:
 
1. Pre-wet your wool by soaking it in a huge pot of warm water for about 
20 minutes.
 
 Wet wool absorbs the dye more evenly.
 
 If you’re going to dye a skein of yarn that has already been wound into 
a ball, unwind it and rewind it into a twisted skein (a big loop). If it 
remains in a ball, the yarn in the center of the ball won’t get enough of 
the dye, and the finished product won’t be a uniform color.
 
2. Prepare the Kool-Aid dye bath.
 
 Fill a 4-quart pot about 2/3 of the way with water and pour in a package 
or two of powdered drink mix, depending on how rich you want the 
color to be (it’s hard to determine what the exact outcome will be unless 
you do the same thing over and over, so have fun playing with different 
colors). Stir until it’s dissolved.
 
3. Add the wool, and heat on the stove.
 
 Add the wool to the pot, turn on the heat, and heat to a gentle boil for 
5 to 10 minutes, keeping the yarn under the water by pressing it down 
with a big spoon.
 
4. Remove, rinse, and dry the wool.
 
 Allow the bath to cool before taking the wool out. Rinse until the color 
runs clear. Squeeze out any extra water, and then wrap the wool in a 
towel to absorb excess moisture. Let the wool dry on a sweater rack, or, 
if it’s already in yarn form, you can hang it.
 
If you have a particular use in mind for the dyed wool, dye enough for the 
entire project at the same time, so the color is uniform.
Spinning and Using Yarn
If you want yarn from your own fiber, the easiest way to get it is to give the 
fiber to an expert who has a spinning machine. Some of the bigger operations 
that card fiber can also spin it, giving you a finished product of yarn. However, 
many people prefer to do their own spinning. In this section, you discover 
some spinning tools and read about where you can pick up this craft.

Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Taking the wheel: Spinning implements
Processed fiber can be spun into yarn using a number of styles of spinning 
implements. The simplest style is a drop spindle. You don’t need anything 
fancy to make one yourself — a dowel, a hook, and a small round disk or 
wooden wheel will do. A drop spindle works with the same concept as a spin-
ning wheel — making yarn by putting a twist into the fiber — but on a much 
slower scale. It takes about seven times as long to make the same amount of 
yarn on a spindle as it does on a wheel. But the spindles are completely por-
table and can be used where wheels can’t, such as in the car, on a plane, or 
around the campfire. You can even spin while wandering around.
If you opt for a spinning wheel, you can find fold-up styles that you can pack 
in the car and take to spinning parties or even on camping trips, but they’re 
not as portable and campfire friendly as the drop spindle. Some styles are 
not only functioning yarn-makers but also beautiful pieces of furniture to 
grace your living room (see Figure 1-3).
 
Figure 1-3: 
A traditional 
spinning 
wheel.
 
You can even get small, consumer-sized electric wheels (see Figure 1-4).
Try out a few different styles of wheels before you decide on one, because 
you may find you prefer one style over another. If you really get into this 
craft, you may even find the need for multiple wheels. Find a local store that 
sells wheels, visit fiber festivals (these typically have people who are show-
ing off and answering questions about all things fiber), or find a spinning 
group in your area where somebody will let you take a spin.

Joining classes and clubs to develop 
your spinning technique
The concept of spinning seems simple enough — one hand holds the fiber as 
the other hand pulls the fibers out slowly to twist as the wheel turns. But get-
ting all the components of the process to come together to give you what you 
want takes a little while. Factors that come into play include the amount of 
twist you put into the fibers, the spinning speed, the blending of fibers, and 
much more. Take a class, have a friend show you, or at least get a video to 
see how spinning is done.
A bunch of spinning clubs are around, and chances are good you can find 
a group near you. Ask at the local yarn shop and join up. Not only is spin-
ning with a group of others a fun get-together, but you can also get tips from 
people who really know what they’re doing.
 
If you sign up for a spinning class, make sure it actually has to do with fibers. 
Otherwise, you may be in store for an aerobic workout on a stationary bike!
A good place to start perusing all the intricacies of the craft is at the Joy of 
Handspinning Web site (www.joyofhandspinning.com).
Getting hooked on knitting and crocheting
Knitting or crocheting is a great way to put all that spun wool to good use. 
Using knitting needles or a crochet hook, you can make your own fabrics. 
Knitting and crocheting are great outlets for creativity, because the possibil-
ities for what you end up with are endless. You can play with stitch patterns, 

120
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
colors, and textures and turn out a truly unique garment, purse or fashion 
accessory, or something else entirely, such as kitchen curtains or teapot 
covers. Visit your local yarn shop or craft store and sign up for lessons, or 
check out a book such as Crocheting For Dummies, by Susan Brittain and 
Karen Manthey, or Knitting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Pam Allen, Tracy 
Barr, and Shannon Okey (Wiley). For a quick primer on knitting basics, hop to 
Chapter 2 of this book.
Fruit of the loom: Weaving fabrics
As in knitting and crocheting, weaving lets you make your own fabric. In this 
case, you pass threads under and over each other in patterns. You decide the 
patterns, the colors, and the thickness. Using a loom, you make fabric that 
you can then use in clothing, rugs, tapestries, blankets, baskets, or virtually 
any other fabric application.
To weave, you need a loom. A loom can be as simple as a couple of two-by-
fours and some dowels, or as complex as an electronic floor model that takes 
up the good part of a small room and needs weeks of lessons to master.
Check at the local yarn store for a group to join, or visit the Handweavers Guild 
of America (www.weavespindye.org) for a national list of local guilds.
Locking the Fibers with Felting
You can make felt in a couple of ways. One method is to spin the fleece into 
yarn, knit or crochet it, and then shrink it. Another is to take the unspun 
fiber and subject it to agitation. Whatever the method, the end product is the 
same: The agitation causes the individual fibers to hook onto one another, 
move closer together, and form a dense matt, eliminating any holes that were 
there before felting. Felting is a very cool thing to watch happen. This section 
introduces you to a few techniques.
Creating pieces of felt: 
Wet felting by hand
Wet felting uses hot, soapy water to achieve the effect of felting. For basic felt-
ing, gather the following supplies:
 
 A plastic tablecloth or similar covering to protect your work surface
 
 The wool to be felted
 
 A piece of netting that’s a little bigger than the surface of the 
pre-felted wool

121
 Chapter 1: Making Fabrics from Animal Fibers
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
 
 Hot, soapy water
 
 A sponge
 
 A ridged washboard
Find a smooth, clean surface to work on, such as a countertop or table, and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Layer the fiber you want to felt on top of the plastic tablecloth.
 
 If you’re working with a batt, simply pull off the amount you want and 
lay it down. If working with roving, add the smaller pieces side by side 
and then add the next row so the sides overlap slightly. You want the 
surface to be solidly covered with the wool, with no big gaps.
 
 Lay out another layer on top of and across the first layer, at a 90-degree 
angle. Continue adding layers (four to six in total) so you provide many 
opportunities for the fibers to adhere to each other across layers, 
making a sturdy end product.
 
2. Cover the wool with the piece of netting.
 
3. Dip the sponge in hot, soapy water and squeeze out the sponge so it’s 
just damp (no water drips off); starting in the center of the wool, press 
the sponge into the wool, wetting it and pushing out the air.
 
 Move out from the center, pressing and being sure to keep the netting in 
place, until all the wool is wet and soapy. Remember the following:
 
• Don’t sop it. If water comes up when you press down, it’s too wet. 
With too much water, the fibers just float in the water instead of 
adhering to each other. Use a towel to soak up the excess.
 
• Keep the wool flat. If it isn’t flat — if bubbles are in the surface — 
press a little more water into the bubbly spot.
 
 At this point, you can add strips of another color for accent.
 
4. Using your hands, gently rub in a circular motion, covering the entire 
surface of the wool.
 
 Start with the netting still in place. To make sure the fibers don’t try to 
hook to the netting, lift the netting up periodically, keeping a palm on 
the wool to prevent it from unhooking from its neighboring fibers.
 
 After you’ve worked the top side for a while, take the netting off and flip 
the fabric over. Put the netting back on top of the piece and work on the 
other side.
 
5. When the wool is in soft felt stage, take the fabric in both hands and 
rub it back and forth.
 
 To determine when it’s in the soft felt stage, pinch a section and lift. If the 
fibers separate, it needs more rubbing (see Step 4). If it comes up as a 
solid piece of fabric, it’s ready.

122
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
6. Re-wet the fabric with hot water and rub it across the washboard, 
turning it every now and then to get it uniform.
 
 Rub on all sides and at all angles. The fabric shrinks in the direction in 
which you rub it. The felt is done when the fabric is firm and doesn’t 
stretch when pulled.
 
7. When the fabric is done, rinse out all the soap with warm water and 
let the felt dry.
 
 Rinse the fabric until the water runs clear. Blot out any excess water by 
rolling the fabric in a towel and letting it sit for a few minutes. Unroll it 
and lay it out again, shaping if necessary. Let it dry for around 24 hours.
Now you have a piece of fabric that you can use to make something else. For 
instance, you can lay out a pattern and cut it out to make a jacket or purse, or 
use the felt as a background for a needle-felting project (see the later section 
“Entering the art gallery: Needle felting”).
Soap’s up! Making a felted bar
When made properly, felted bars are like a 
washcloth and a bar of soap all in one. Because 
the soap doesn’t just wash down the drain (more 
of it stays inside its casing), the soap lasts as 
much as three times as long as a regular bar of 
soap. As you use the felted bar, the wool shrinks 
around the bar and becomes tighter. When the 
soap is all gone, you can wash and dry the felt 
bag and fill it with catnip; pets love to play with 
it after a good washing.
Here’s what you need:
  One bar of soap
  Enough wool to cover the soap bar 
completely
  A large bowl of hot water
Wrap some unfelted wool around the bar of 
soap (both lengthwise and widthwise) until 
it’s completely covered. Work near a sink and 
have a large bowl handy. Working over the 
bowl, dribble some hot water on the bar while 
patting it lightly. Don’t add too much water at 
first, or the wool will just fall off. Keep adding 
a little soapy water and patting and squeezing 
it lightly, shifting it around in your hands as it 
starts to lather up.
When the wool is completely wet, squeeze the 
wool-covered bar in both hands and lightly rub, 
dribbling on more water periodically to keep the 
bar nice and soapy wet. It first gets wrinkly and 
then foams up; then you see it starting to felt, 
or matt up. Keep squeezing and rubbing (don’t 
forget to get the sides, too) until it looks like a 
nice, matted fabric. This process takes around 
15 to 20 minutes.
Dunk the bar in the bowl of water and see 
whether the felt casing is snug around the 
soap. If not, rub a little longer. If it’s snug, run 
some cold water on it to rinse off the suds. (Cold 
water also serves to temporarily stop the felting 
process.)

Felting knitted or crocheted projects: 
Wet felting in the washing machine
The mechanics of wet felting in the washing machine are essentially the 
same as they are for hand felting (see the preceding section), but you use the 
washing machine to do the agitation. You also have to start out with a fabric 
that’s already sturdy, such as a knitted piece, because if you just toss some 
loose fleece into the machine, you’ll end up with a matted glob.
The fun thing about felting is you can felt your project just a little or you can 
felt the snot out of it. Start out with a knitted or crocheted piece that’s about 
one-and-a-half to three times bigger than you want it to be (it will shrink 
during the felting process). Then follow these steps:
 
1. Put the piece you want to felt into some sort of bag, such as a pillow-
case or a lingerie washing bag.
 
 During the felting process, some of the fibers come off. Keeping every-
thing in a bag makes cleanup easier and is kinder to the machine.
 
2. Set your washing machine to the lowest water level and the hottest 
water temperature, with a cold water rinse.
 
3. Add about 1/2 teaspoon of detergent, and add the bag with the fabric 
to the water.
 
4. Let it go through the wash cycle; stop the machine before it goes into 
the rinse cycle.
 
 Take the piece out and check it. Most yarns take 20 to 30 minutes to felt, 
but your piece may be done earlier or later. If it needs more time, set the 
machine back to the wash cycle and let it go longer. Repeat until you’ve 
achieved the right size and density.
 
5. Let the wash finish, allowing the piece to go through the rinse and 
spin cycles.
 
6. Take the piece out and shape it if necessary; let it dry.
Entering the art gallery: Needle felting
With needle felting, you repeatedly poke a special, barbed needle through the 
wool to cause the wool’s natural barbs to hook together. You can find felting 
needles at www.mielkesfarm.com or purchase them from other fiber craft 
retailers.

124
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Besides the barbed needle, you also need a piece of foam to lay your felting 
material on top of so that, as you poke, poke, poke, the needle doesn’t go 
down into a table (which breaks the needle) or your fingers (which really 
hurts).
You can use needle felting to do a sort of “painting” on a background. Starting 
out with an already-felted piece as a background is a good idea. (You can use 
needle felting to decorate felted hats.) Although the background doesn’t have 
to be a felted piece, it’s the easiest background to use because it acts as just 
another layer of felt for the new dry-felted portion to dig in to. Here’s how the 
process works:
 
1. Lay your background fabric over a piece of soft foam padding.
 
2. Pick a thin piece of wool you want to add to the picture and place it 
on the background.
 
3. Take the needle and poke several times.
 
 You see the fibers joining immediately. Keep poking until the new wool 
piece is attached to the background.
 
4. Continue until you’re happy with your design.
Your local yarn store may offer classes on needle felting, or you can see it in 
pictures in the online tutorial at http://backtobackknits.com/HowTo/
NeedleFelt. If you don’t have your own fiber to use, you can find needle-
felting kits online that include a little bit of fiber as well as the needles, felting 
pad, and instructions.
You can also use needle felting to make some pretty spectacular dolls and 
3-D soft sculptures. I’ve made some felted sheep and goats this way. You 
start out with a cylindrical shape as the body by rolling a few tufts of fiber 
and punching them with the needle so the fibers form a solid mass. For the 
legs, you may want to put some sort of stabilizer inside (like a piece of cord-
ing) and felt around that. Place the legs on the body and jab until they’re 
attached. Do the same for the head and a tail.
Using Up All the Fiber Leftovers
Some fiber, after cleaning, is too matted to be processed and spun. You may 
be tempted to just toss these bits. But you can use them as stuffing for crafts 
(dolls, teddy bears, and so on), pillows, or even mattresses. You can also use 
leftover fleece as insulation in outbuildings.

As for the fiber that’s still good enough to spin but isn’t good enough quality 
or soft enough to use in garments, you can use it to make animal blankets or 
household items:

make, and the end product is light and fluffy compared to its heavier 
shredded-rubber pillow counterpart. Making a full-sized mattress for 
your own bed is probably more involved than you want to deal with, but 
smaller pillows or even animal beds are great candidates for wool stuff-
ing. Simply make a pillow or pet mattress form, decorate it, and then 
stuff it with wool. A truly, completely done-by-yourself project!
 
 Here are some tips for using fiber to fill pillows or anything else:
 
• Put several layers of fabric around the fiber filler. Some of the 
wool fibers can work their way through to the surface, giving the 
item a bearded look. Alternatively, felt the pillow form — this 
opens up a whole new avenue of creativity! For example, you could 
decorate the felted cover using the technique explained in the ear-
lier section “Entering the art gallery: Needle felting.”
 
• To clean wool pillows and mattresses, wash them gently by hand 
and don’t agitate. Squeeze out excess water and use a towel to 
blot the rest of the water. Let them air dry.
 
 Wool is sort of a magic kind of mattress material because it wicks 
moisture away from the body and helps you sleep a little cooler in the 
summer and warmer in the winter. It maintains its loft longer than any 
cotton fiber. Dust mites can’t live in it, and it’s pretty hypoallergenic. 
Sounds like a miracle material to me!
 
 Animal bedding for shorn critters: After shearing, put the loose, unspin-
nable fibers in the barn as bedding to help the animals’ transition to 
life without hair. The leftover fiber can come in especially handy when 
babies arrive and you need extra bedding.
 
 Household items: Sometimes the fiber may not be soft enough to use 
next to the skin. A sweater, scarf, or hat would be too itchy, and all the 
hard work you’d go to in order to knit it would be in vain because you 
wouldn’t ever wear it. So why not make something out of it that won’t 
irritate the skin? Knitting isn’t just for clothing, after all. Make a rug. Or a 
horse blanket. Or a wall hanging. Or a collection of stuffed animals. The 
possibilities are endless.

K
nitting is a relatively simple process requiring minimal tools — two nee-
dles and some yarn. Its basic structure of interlocking loops couldn’t be 
less complicated. Yet the possibilities for design and pattern innovation are 
endless. Knitting has more than cozy socks and colorful sweaters to offer; 
it’s also an excellent way to mitigate some of the stresses and frustrations of 
day-to-day life.
This chapter introduces you to knitting — what it is, what it takes, and how 
you do it. It also includes a few simple yet attractive and fun projects. Pretty 
soon you’ll be able to explore with confidence the myriad items you can 
create with two needles and some yarn!
Yarn: The (Quick) Consumer’s Guide
Whether you’re buying your yarn from a yarn shop, discount retailer, or craft 
store, or you’re using yarn you’ve spun yourself (flip back to the first chapter 
in this book for instructions), you need to know a little bit about the different 
types of yarn and their general characteristics.
Yarn is made from short fibers that are either natural (from animals or 
plants) or synthetic. The fibers are combed, or carded, to align them into a 
soft untwisted rope (called roving). Then they’re spun (twisted) into a strand 
or ply of yarn. This single ply is usually combined with other plies to form the 
final yarn. The following sections explain the two main factors — fiber and 
weight — that account for the wide variety of yarns available.

128
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Weighing yarn for project purposes
Yarns come in different weights, or thicknesses. The weight of your yarn 
(among other factors) has a huge impact on the look of your final product 
and the amount of time it takes to knit it up. A yarn’s weight determines 
how many stitches it takes to knit 1 inch. A medium-weight yarn that knits 
up 5 stitches and 7 rows to the inch takes 35 stitches to make a square inch 
of knitted fabric. A bulky yarn at 3 stitches and 5 rows to the inch needs 15 
stitches to make a square inch. You can see the difference in Figure 2-1.

Although there are no official categories for yarn weights, many knitting 
books and yarn manufacturers use common terms to indicate a yarn’s thick-
ness and the size needle the yarn is usually worked on. Table 2-1 lists these 
categories for you.

The thickness of a given yarn is determined by the individual thickness of the 
plies, not by the number of plies. If the plies are thin, a 4-ply yarn can be finer 
than a heavy single-ply yarn.
Identifying fiber fundamentals
All yarn is made from natural or synthetic fibers. Different fibers have dif-
ferent qualities — some good, some not so good. Often yarn manufacturers 
combine different fibers to offset an undesirable characteristic. A blend is a 
yarn made from fibers of different origins — for example, wool/cotton, wool/
silk, alpaca/cotton. More than anything else, the combination of fibers in 
your yarn determines its ultimate look, feel, and wearable comfort. The fol-
lowing sections delve into the various types of yarns out there.
Wool and other fleece yarns
Wool (made from the fleece of sheep) is the queen of yarns, and it remains a 
popular choice for knitters for a number of excellent reasons. It’s a good insu-
lator — warm in winter, cool in summer. Wool can absorb lots of moisture 
without feeling wet, and it soaks up dye beautifully. It’s also resilient — the 
fibers can stretch and bend repeatedly but always return to their original 
shape. Wool is soft, relatively lightweight, beautiful to look at, and — key to 
beginning knitters — easy to knit with because it has just enough give. It also 
can be pulled out and reknit easily, a bonus when you’re just learning the 
basic stitches.

130
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Following are some of your wool yarn options:
 
 Lamb’s wool: This wool comes from a young lamb’s first shearing. It’s 
softer and finer than wool from an older sheep’s fleece.
 
 Merino wool: Merino wool is considered the finest of the fine wool 
yarns. Long, lustrous fibers make a soft and exceptionally lovely knitted 
fabric.
 
 Pure new wool/virgin wool: Pure new and virgin refer to wool that’s 
made directly from animal fleece and not recycled from existing wool 
garments.
 
 Shetland wool: Real Shetland wool is a traditional 2-ply heathery yarn 
made from the small and hardy native sheep of Scotland’s Shetland 
Islands. It’s used in traditional Fair Isle sweaters and is typically avail-
able in sport or fingering weight (see “Weighing yarn for project pur-
poses” earlier in this chapter for an explanation of weights). This wool 
originally came in sheep’s colors, including all shades of charcoal and 
deep brown to white. Shetland wool is now also available in an extraor-
dinary range of beautiful, dyed colors.
 
 Icelandic wool: This rustic, soft, single-ply, medium-weight to heavy-
weight yarn was traditionally available only in natural sheep’s colors 
(black, charcoal, light gray, and white). Today, you can also find it dyed 
in bright jewel and heathered colors, as well as in a lighter weight appro-
priate for thinner, indoor sweaters.
 
 Washable or “superwash” wool: This wool is treated chemically or elec-
tronically to destroy the outer fuzzy layer of fibers that would otherwise 
felt or bond with each other and shrink.
Sheep aren’t the only animals to provide fibers for yarns. Fuzzy mohair and 
luxurious cashmere come from Angora and Kashmir goats, respectively. 
Warm, soft alpaca comes from members of the llama family; alpacas are 
small, South American cousins of the camel. The belly of the musk ox pro-
vides the lush and exceptionally warm and light qiviut. Lighter than air and 
fuzziest of all, angora comes from the hair of Angora rabbits.
Silk, cotton, linen, and rayon yarns
Silk, cotton, linen, and rayon yarns are the slippery yarns. Unlike rough yarns 
from the hairy fibers of animals, the smooth and often shiny surfaces of these 
materials cause them to unravel quickly if you drop a stitch. These yarns are 
inelastic and may stretch lengthwise over time. They’re often blended with 
other fibers (natural and synthetic) to counteract their disadvantages. But 
silk and cotton, even in their pure state, are so lovely to look at and comfort-
able to wear that they’re well worth knitting.

Synthetic yarns
Originally, synthetics (nylon, acrylic, and polyester) were made to mimic 
the look and feel of natural materials. Just as wool yarn is spun from short 
lengths of carded fibers from a sheep’s fleece, synthetic yarns begin as a long 
filament made from artificial (usually petroleum-based) ingredients cut into 
short lengths and processed to look like wool yarn.
On the plus side, all-synthetic yarns are inexpensive and hold up well in the 
washing machine. For people who are allergic to wool, synthetics make for a 
look-alike substitute (at least from a distance). On the downside, all-synthetic 
yarns don’t have the wonderful insulating and moisture-absorbing qualities 
of natural yarns and therefore can be uncomfortable to wear. They pill more 
readily than wool or other fibers, and after exposure to heat (a hot iron is 
deadly), they lose all resilience and become flat.
Because of the problems associated with all-synthetic yarns, manufacturers 
have come up with new and better applications for synthetics — namely, 
combining synthetic yarns with other fibers. For example, nylon is extremely 
strong and light. Blended in small amounts with more fragile fibers such 
as mohair, nylon adds durability. A little nylon blended with wool makes a 
superb sock yarn. A bit of acrylic in cotton makes the yarn lighter and pro-
motes memory so that the knitted fabric doesn’t stretch out of shape.
Straddling the border between natural and synthetic are soy, bamboo, corn, 
and other unusual yarns made from plant-based materials. Spun into micro-
filaments that are extruded using a process similar to that employed for 
acrylic and other synthetic yarns, these fibers have become increasingly 
popular in the past few years, particularly in yarn blends such as soy/wool, 
bamboo/silk, and even tree-, corn-, and seaweed-derived fibers.
Novelty yarns
Novelty, or specialty, yarns are easy to recognize because their appearance 
is so different from traditional yarns. Their jewel colors and whimsical tex-
tures can be hard to resist. Eyelash yarns, for example, feature tiny spikes of 
fiber that stick up, resembling eyelashes. Here are some of the more common 
novelty yarns you may come across:
 
 Boucle: This highly bumpy, textured yarn is comprised of loops.
 
 Chenille: Although tricky to knit with, the attractive appearance and vel-
vety texture of this yarn make your perseverance worthwhile. Chenille is 
usually available in rayon (for sheen) or cotton.
 
 Faux fur: Fluffy fiber strands on a strong base thread of nylon resemble 
faux fur when knitted. This novelty yarn is available in many different 
colors.

132
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
 Railroad ribbon: This ribbon-style yarn has tiny “tracks” of fiber strung 
between two parallel strands of thread.
 
 Ribbon: This is usually a knitted ribbon in rayon or a rayon blend with 
wonderful drape.
 
 Thick-thin: Often handspun, these yarns alternate between very thick 
and thin sections, which lends a charmingly bumpy look to knitted fabric.
 
Some novelty yarns can be tricky to work with. Others — like those with no 
give, complex textures, or threadlike strands that are easy to lose when you 
knit from one needle to the other — can be downright difficult. Identifying 
individual stitches in highly textured yarns is difficult if not impossible, 
making it hard to fix mistakes or rip out stitches.
Eyeing standard yarn packaging
Yarn is packaged (sometimes called “put up”) in different ways — balls, 
skeins (which rhymes with “canes”), and hanks. Each comes wrapped with a 
label that you should read carefully because it gives you useful information 
and lets you know whether the yarn is a good candidate for the project you 
have in mind. If the yarn begs to be purchased before you know what you 
want to make with it, the info on the label will guide you as to what kind of 
project would best suit it.
Label talk
A yarn label offers tons of vital information (Figure 2-2 shows a typical label). 
Pay particular attention to
 
 Gauge (how many stitches and rows per inch) and suggested needle 
size: These details give you an idea of what the final knitted fabric will 
look like. A size 11 needle and a gauge of low numbers (3 stitches and 
5 rows to the inch), for example, yield a heavy, chunky fabric. On the 
other hand, a size 5 needle and a gauge of 5 stitches and 7 rows to the 
inch yield a finer, more traditional fabric.
 
 Fiber content: This info lets you know whether the yarn is wool, cotton, 
acrylic, a blend, or something else.
 
 Dye lot number and/or color number: This detail indicates the batch of 
dye that this yarn comes from. When you buy multiple skeins of yarn, com-
pare these numbers to ensure that they’re all the same (meaning all your 
yarn comes from the same dye batch). Even if you can’t detect a difference 
in color between two balls of different dye lots, chances are the difference 
will become apparent when you knit them up one after the other.
 
 To avoid unwanted color variations, buy enough yarn from the same dye 
lot at one time to complete your project. If you have to buy more later, 
you may not be able to find yarn from the right dye lot.

Ball, skein, or hank?
Yarn is packaged in different forms: balls, skeins, and hanks, as shown in 
Figure 2-3. Balls and skeins come ready to knit. When you find the end, you 
can cast on and go. Hanks need to be wound into a ball before you can use 
them. If you try to knit with the yarn in hank form, you’ll quickly end up with 
a tangled mess.
 
Figure 2-3:

skeins, and

Skein

Ball
To wind a hank into a ball, follow these steps:
 
1. Carefully unfold the hank (it’s formed into a large circle) and drape it 
over a chair back, a friend’s outstretched arms, or your bent knees (if 
you’re sitting, that is).
 
2. Locate the ends of the yarn, and if they’re tied, cut or unknot them.

134
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
3. With either end, begin by making a butterfly (see Figure 2-4).
 
 Wrap the yarn in a figure eight around the thumb and little finger of your 
hand. Make about 20 passes if you’re winding a medium-weight yarn; 
make more passes for a finer yarn, or less for a thicker yarn.
 
Figure 2-4:

butterfly.
 
 
4. Take the “wings” off your finger and thumb and fold the butterfly in 
half, holding it between your thumb and fingers.
 
5. Continue wrapping yarn loosely around the folded butterfly (and your 
fingers), as shown in Figure 2-5.

6. When the package gets bulky, slip it off your fingers, turn it, and con-
tinue to wrap the yarn into a ball.
 
 Neatness isn’t important; looseness is. Always wrap the yarn around as 
many fingers as you can, slipping them out when you change position. 
The space they take up ensures that the yarn isn’t stretched as it waits 
to be knitted. If you knit with stretched yarn, you can guess what hap-
pens to your knitted piece when the yarn springs back to size.
Getting to the Point with 
Knitting Needles
You have three options when it comes to knitting needles: straight, circular, 
and double-pointed (see Figure 2-6):
 
 Straight needles: Straight needles are generally used for flat knitting — 
knitting on the right side, and then turning and knitting on the wrong 
side. Straight needles come in many standard lengths ranging from 
7-inch “scarf needles” to those that are 10, 13, and 14 inches. The larger 
your project, the longer the needle you’ll need.
 
 Circular needles: Circular needles are simply a pair of straight knitting 
needle tips joined by a flexible cable. You can use circular needles to 
knit in the round — knitting in a continuous, spiral-like fashion without 
turning your work. This technique creates a seamless tube large enough 
for a sweater body or small enough for a neckband. You can also use cir-
cular needles as you would straight needles, to work back and forth — a 
particularly handy approach for lengthwise-knit scarves, blankets, and 
other very wide pieces. Circular needles are available in many different 
sizes and lengths (most frequently 16, 24, 29, and 36 inches, although 
you can also find them in sizes as long as 60 inches).
 
 Double-pointed needles: Double-pointed needles (dpns) have a point at 
each end and are sold in sets of four or five needles. They work the same 
way as circular needles — in rounds. You use them to make small tubes 
when there are too few stitches to stretch around the circumference of a 
circular needle — for items like sleeve cuffs, tops of hats, socks, mittens, 
and so on. They come in 7- and 10-inch lengths and recently have shown 
up in 5-inch lengths — a great boon to knitters who enjoy making socks 
and mittens.
A needle’s size is determined by its diameter. The smaller the size, the nar-
rower the needle and the smaller the stitch it makes. Figure 2-7 shows needle 
sizes and their US and metric equivalents.

Casting On
Creating the first row of stitches is called casting on. Various ways of casting 
on exist, and different knitters have their favorites. The following sections 
outline two common cast-on methods. Whichever you use, be sure to cast 
on your stitches evenly. They make up the bottom edge of your knitting, and 
neatness counts.
 
Here are a couple of tips about casting on:
 
 Don’t cast on too tightly. Doing so makes the first row hard to work 
because you have to force your needle tip through the loop. If you find 
yourself doing this, you may want to start over and cast on with a needle 
one size larger to counteract the tension. Then switch to the requested 
size for the actual knitting.
 
 When you’re casting on a lot of stitches, place a stitch marker at par-
ticular intervals — like every 50 stitches. That way, if you get inter-
rupted or distracted while you’re counting (and you will, sometimes 
multiple times), you don’t have to begin counting again at the first 
stitch. As you work the first row, just drop the markers off the needle.
Two-strand (or long-tail) cast-on
The two-strand method (sometimes called the long-tail method) is a great all-
around cast-on. It’s elastic, attractive, and easy to knit from. For this cast-on 
method, you need only one needle: the right-hand (RH) needle.
Here’s how to cast on using the two-strand method:
 
1. Measure off enough yarn for the bottom part of your piece and make a 
slipknot on your needle.
 
 To figure how long the “tail” should be, you need approximately 1 inch 
for every stitch you cast on plus a little extra. Alternatively, you can 
measure the bottom of the knitted piece and multiply this number by 4.
 
 To make the slipknot, form a pretzel-shaped loop and place your needle 
into the loop, as shown in Figure 2-8a. Then gently pull on both ends of 
yarn until the stitch is firmly on the needle but still slides easily back 
and forth, as shown in Figure 2-8b.
 
2. Holding the needle in your right hand with the tip pointing away from 
your hand, insert your left hand’s thumb and index finger into the “tent” 
formed by the two yarn ends falling from the slipknot on your needle.
 
3. With your left hand’s ring and pinkie fingers, catch the yarn ends and 
hold them to your palm so they don’t flap around underneath (see 
Figure 2-9a).

4. With your right hand, pull the needle between your left thumb and 
index finger so that the “tent” sides aren’t droopy.
 
5. With the RH needle tip, go around the yarn on your thumb from the 
left (see Figure 2-9b), then around the yarn on your index finger from 
the right (Figure 2-9c), and pull the new loop through (Figure 2-9d).
 
 Figure 2-9e shows the path your needle takes to catch the loop from 
your thumb and index finger.

6. Tighten this new loop (your first cast-on stitch) onto the needle — but 
not too tight!
 
 You’ll quickly find that if you don’t let go of the yarn after creating the 
stitch, you can use your thumb to tighten the stitch onto your needle.
 
 Although this is your first cast-on stitch, it’s also your second stitch on 
the RH needle, because you also have the initial slipknot.
 
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 until you have the number of stitches you need.
 
 If you need to put your work down, or if you lose your place, you may 
have to pull the stitches off the needle and start from Step 2 instead.
 
Although casting on may feel awkward at first and you have to pay attention 
to each movement, with time and practice, you’ll no longer have to think 
about what your hands are doing. You’ll be surprised at how quickly you’ll 
learn the movements and make them smoothly and effortlessly while you 
think about something entirely unknitterish.
Cable cast-on (cable co)
The cable cast-on, or knitting on, is less elastic than the two-strand cast-on. 
Use it when you need a sturdy, not-too-stretchy edge. (It’s also good for but-
tonholes). To cast on with this method, follow these steps:
 
1. Make a slipknot on your needle, leaving a short tail.
 
 Refer to the preceding section for help making a slipknot.
 
2. Knit into the first stitch (see Figure 2-10a), but instead of slipping the 
old loop off the left hand (LH) needle, bring the new loop to the right 
(see Figure 2-10b) and slip it onto the LH needle (see Figure 2-10c).
 
 If you don’t know how to make this first stitch, see the later “Knitting 
know-how” section for instructions.
 
3. Insert the RH needle between the 2 stitches on the LH needle (see 
Figure 2-10d and 2-10e).
 
4. Wrap the yarn around the RH needle as you do when you knit and 
then bring a new loop through to the front (see Figure 2-10f).
 
5. Bring this loop around to the right and place it on the LH needle (see 
Figure 2-10g).
 
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 until you have the number of cast-on stitches 
you need.

Now You’re Knitting and Purling
Knitted (and purled) stitches are made by using a continuous strand of yarn 
and two needles to pull new loops through old loops. That’s it. The next two 
sections explain how to create both stitches.
Knitting know-how
To knit, with the yarn in your right hand, hold the needle with the cast-on 
stitches in your left hand, pointing to the right. Make sure that the first stitch 
is no more than 1 inch from the tip of the needle. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Insert the tip of the empty (RH) needle into the first stitch on the LH 
needle from left to right and front to back, forming a T with the tips of 
the needles.
 
 The RH needle will be behind the LH needle (see Figure 2-11).
 
Figure 2-11: 
Inserting the 
RH needle 
into the first 
stitch on the 
LH needle.
 
 
2. With your right hand, bring the yarn to the front from the left side 
of the RH needle and then over the RH needle to the right and down 
between the needles.
 
 You can try to maneuver the yarn with your right forefinger, as shown in 
Figure 2-12a, or just hold it between your thumb and forefinger for now.

142
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
3. Keeping a slight tension on the wrapped yarn, bring the tip of the RH 
needle with its wrap of yarn through the loop on the LH needle to the 
front.
 
 The RH needle is now in front of the LH needle (see Figure 2-12b). Keep the 
tip of your left forefinger on the point of the RH needle to help guide the 
needle through the old stitch and prevent losing the wrap of yarn.
 
Figure 2-12: 
Completing 
a knit stitch.
 a.
b.
 
 When you bring the new loop through the old, bring the RH needle up far 
enough that the new stitch forms on the large part of the needle, not just 
on the tip. If you work too close to the tips, your new stitches form on the 
narrowest part of your needles, making them too tight to knit with ease.
 
 Note that when you’ve finished making a knit stitch, the yarn is behind 
the needle facing away from you. Be sure that the yarn hasn’t ended up in 
front of your work or over the needle before you start your next stitch.
For left-handed knitters
For better or worse, knitting patterns are writ-
ten for right-handed knitters (folks who work 
from the LH [ left-hand] needle to the RH [right-
hand] needle). If you can master the knitting 
method instructions presented in this chapter, 
you won’t have to reinterpret patterns in order 
to work them in reverse. Chances are, like most 
right-handed knitters, sooner or later you’ll 
work out a series of movements that feels natu-
ral and easy, and your stitches will be smooth 
and even.
What if the initial awkward feeling isn’t going 
away? Try to work in reverse, moving the 
stitches from the RH needle to the LH one. In the 
knitting instructions, substitute the word right 
for left and vice versa. To make the illustrations 
work for you, hold a mirror up to the side of the 
relevant illustration and mimic the hand and 
yarn positions visible in the mirror image.
If you find that working in reverse is the most 
comfortable method, be aware that some direc-
tions in knitting patterns, such as decreases, 
look different when worked in the opposite 
direction. This quirk will be most problematic 
for lace patterns, but it’s a small price to pay 
for comfortable knitting. If you decide to work in 
reverse, Left-Handed Knitting by Regina Hurlbert 
(Van Nostrand Reinhold) may be helpful.

4. Slide the RH needle to the right until the old loop on the LH needle 
drops off.
 
 You now have a new stitch/loop on the RH needle — the old stitch hangs 
below it (see Figure 2-13). Congratulations! You’ve just made your first 
knitted stitch!
 
Figure 2-13: 
Your first 
knitted 
stitch!
 
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 until you’ve knitted all the stitches from 
your LH needle.
 
 Your LH needle is now empty, and your RH needle is full of beautiful, 
new stitches.
 
6. Turn your work (that is, switch hands so that the needle with stitches 
is in your left hand) and knit the new row.
 
 When you turn your work, the yarn strand coming out of the first stitch 
to knit is hanging down in the front. Also notice that the stitch just 
below the first stitch on your LH needle is larger than the rest and can 
obscure your view of where your needle should go.
 
 You may be tempted to pull the yarn strand over the needle to the back 
to tighten up the stitch. If you do this, it’ll look like you have 2 stitches 
on your needle rather than 1. Keep the strand in front and gently pull 
down on it, and the big loop if necessary, to better see the opening of 
the first stitch. Be sure to insert the point of the RH needle in the loop 
on the LH needle and not into the stitch below.
Repeat these steps for several more rows (or all afternoon) until you’re com-
fortable with the movements. Aim to make these steps one continuous move-
ment, to make even stitches, and to stay relaxed! After you’ve knitted a few 
rows, take a look at what you’ve created: It’s the garter stitch, one of the most 
common — and easiest — stitch patterns. You can find it and another common 
stitch pattern in the later section “Stitches Every Knitter Should Know.”

Perfect purling
Purling is working a knit stitch backwards: Instead of going into the stitch from 
front to back, you enter it from back to front. Combining knit stitches with purl 
stitches enables you to make a wide variety of textured stitch patterns.
Here’s your step-by-step guide on how to purl:
 
1. Hold the needle with the cast-on or existing stitches in your left hand, 
pointing to the right. Insert the tip of the RH needle into the first loop 
on the LH needle from right to left and back to front, forming a T with 
the needle tips.
 
 The RH needle is in front of the LH needle, and the working yarn is in front 
of your needles (see Figure 2-14a). This process is the reverse of what you 
do when you form a knit stitch (described in the preceding section).
 
2. With your right hand, wrap the yarn around the back of the RH 
needle from right to left and down (see Figure 2-14b).
 
Figure 2-14: 
Purling.
 
a.

3. Keeping a slight tension on the wrap of yarn, bring the tip of the RH 
needle with its wrap of yarn down and through the loop on the LH 
needle to the back side of the LH needle (see Figure 2-15a).
 
4. Slide the old loop off the tip of the LH needle.
 
 A new loop/stitch is made on the RH needle. You can see how it should 
look in Figure 2-15b.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 until you’re comfortable with the movements.

When you purl, the yarn strand comes out of the new stitches on the side 
of the knitting facing you. When you knit, the yarn comes out of the new 
stitches on the side facing away from you.
A purled swatch looks just like a knitted swatch. Why? Because purling is 
simply the reverse of knitting. Whether you knit all the rows or purl all the 
rows, you’re working a garter stitch.
Stitches Every Knitter Should Know
Knitting and purling, covered in the preceding sections, open the door to 
all sorts of patterns that involve alternating between knit and purl stitches. 
But as a beginning knitter, you only really need to know two: the garter stitch, 
which you create simply by knitting (or purling) every row, and the stocki-
nette stitch, which you create by alternating a knit row with a purl row.
 
When knitting a stitch, the loose tail of yarn is in back of your work. When 
purling a stitch, the yarn is in front of your work. As you switch back and 
forth between knitting and purling within a row, you need to move your yarn 
to the front or to the back as appropriate. Unfortunately for novice knitters 
who often forget to move the yarn accordingly, instructions don’t explicitly 
tell you to bring your yarn to the front or back of your work. They assume 
that you know where the yarn should be. As you practice the patterns that 
combine both knit and purl stitches, make sure your yarn is in the proper 
position for each stitch before you start it and refer to the earlier section 
“Now You’re Knitting and Purling” for a quick review if necessary.
 
Knits and purls have a quirky but predictable relationship to each other. 
When lined up horizontally, the purled rows stand out from the knitted rows. 
Arranged in vertical patterns, like ribbing, the purl stitches recede, and the 
knit stitches come forward, creating an elastic fabric. When worked in a bal-
anced manner (meaning the same number of knits and purls appear on each 
side of the fabric), as in seed stitch and its variations, the fabric is stable — it 
lies flat and doesn’t have the tendency to roll in on the edges.
Garter stitch
Garter stitch is the most basic of all knitted fabrics. It’s made by knitting 
every row. (You can create garter stitch by purling every row, too.) You can 
recognize garter stitch by the horizontal ridges formed by the tops of the 
knitted loops on every other row (see Figure 2-16). Garter stitch has a lot 
going for it in addition to being easy to create: It’s reversible, lies flat, and has 
a pleasant rustic look.

Garter

Stockinette stitch
When you alternate a knit row with a purl row (knit the first row, purl the 
second, knit the third, purl the fourth, and so on), you create stockinette stitch 
(abbreviated St st); see Figure 2-17. You see stockinette stitch everywhere: in 
scarves, socks, sweaters, blankets, hats — you name it. In fact, most begin-
ning and intermediate designs incorporate stockinette stitch.
 
Figure 2-17: 
Stockinette 
stitch.
 

147
 Chapter 2: Knitting Basics
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
In written knitting instructions, stockinette stitch appears like this:
Row 1 (RS): Knit.
Row 2 (WS): Purl.
Repeat Rows 1 and 2 for desired length.
Stockinette fabric looks and behaves in a particular way. To successfully 
incorporate this stitch into your knitting repertoire, pay attention to the 
following:
 
 Stockinette stitch has a right and a wrong side (though, of course, 
either side may be the “right” side depending on the intended design). 
The right side is typically the smooth side, called stockinette or knit. 
On this side, the stitches look like small Vs (refer to Figure 2-17). The 
bumpy side of stockinette-stitch fabric, shown in Figure 2-18, is called 
reverse stockinette or purl.
 
 Stockinette fabric curls on the edges. The top and bottom (horizontal) 
edges curl toward the front or smooth side. The side (vertical) edges 
roll toward the bumpy side. Sweater designers frequently use this roll-
ing feature deliberately to create rolled hems or cuffs, and you can 
create easy cords or straps simply by knitting a very narrow (say, 4 or 
6 stitches across) band in stockinette stitch. But when you want the 
piece to lie flat, you need to counteract this tendency by working the 3 
or 4 stitches on the edge in some stitch that lies flat (like garter stitch, 
described in the preceding section).

bumpy) side.

Binding (Or Casting) Off
To finish your knitted piece, you have to bind off, meaning you need to secure 
the stitches in the last row worked so that they don’t unravel. Binding off is 
easy to do if you follow these basic steps:
 
1. Knit the first 2 stitches from the LH needle. These become the first 2 
stitches on your RH needle (see Figure 2-19a).
 
2. With your LH needle in front of your RH needle, insert the LH needle 
into the first stitch worked on the RH needle (the one on the right, as 
shown in Figure 2-19b).
 
3. Bring this loop over the second stitch and off the tip of the RH needle, 
as shown in Figure 2-19c.
 
Figure 2-19: 
Binding off 
a stitch.
 
a.
b.
c.
 
 At this point, you have 1 stitch bound off and 1 stitch remaining on your 
RH needle.
 
4. Knit the next stitch on the LH needle so that you again have 2 stitches 
on your RH needle.

149
 Chapter 2: Knitting Basics
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
 
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 until you have 1 stitch remaining on your 
RH needle.
 
 Don’t bind off too tightly (which, unfortunately, is easy to do). Knitting 
should be elastic, especially around neck edges if you want to be able to 
get a sweater on and off comfortably (and who doesn’t want that?). To 
avoid a tight and inelastic bound-off edge, try working the bind-off row 
on a needle one or more sizes larger than what you’ve been using.
 
6. Cut the yarn a few inches from the needle and pull the tail through 
the last stitch to lock it.
 
 If the piece you’ve just bound off is to be sewn to another piece, leave a 
tail that’s 12 inches long or longer for a built-in strand to sew up a seam.
Practice Projects
The projects in this section give you practice on working the basic knit 
stitches and reading and understanding patterns for knitted garments. As a 
bonus, you end up with a scarf, a bag, or a hat that you can wear yourself or 
give to friends and family.
Everywhere Bag in Garter Stitch
This basic bag is handy for carrying your wallet, keys, and some lip balm. 
Make it larger and throw in your glasses case and a notebook. Make it even 
bigger, add a pocket, and use it for a knitting bag. So cast on and get started!
Materials and vital statistics
 
 Measurements: 8 inches x 9 inches, with a 4-inch flap
 
 Yarn: Tahki Donegal Tweed (100% wool); 3.5 ounces; 1 skein; any color
 
 Needles: One pair of size US 7 (41/2 mm) needles
 
 Other materials: One button, any size
 
 Gauge: 18 stitches per 4 inches in garter stitch (41/2 stitches per 1 inch)
Directions
All you need to do to make this versatile bag is knit a rectangle, sew up the 
sides, make and attach a cord for the strap, make a button loop, and attach a 
button. Voilà!

150
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Knitting the bag
Cast on 38 stitches (abbreviated sts) and work in garter stitch until the piece 
measures 22 inches in length.
Bind off and steam lightly.
Sewing the side seams
Measure down 9 inches from one edge and fold your piece with wrong sides 
together. Sew the sides closed. You should have 4 inches left over for the 
flap. How you sew the sides closed doesn’t really matter, but to make a neat 
seam, use a tapestry needle and a strand of the same yarn.
Making and attaching the cord strap
You can make cords in a variety of ways. Here’s a good method to get you 
started:
Cast on 189 sts (about 42 inches of stitches).
Work in garter stitch for 3 rows.
Bind off.
Using the same yarn you used for the bag, sew the ends of the strap to either 
side of the top of the bag.
Forming the button loop and attaching the button
You can make a small button loop just as you would make the cord strap — 
just make it shorter.
Cast on 8 sts.
Knit 1 row.
Bind off.
To attach the button loop to the bag, center the loop on the bag flap with 
the ends 1 inch or so apart and attach it with yarn. Using embroidery floss 
or sewing thread, sew your button on the bag, making sure it’s opposite the 
loop on the flap.
Garter Ridge Scarf
This scarf is quick to knit up and cozy when finished — and you don’t have 
to worry about sewing any seams! Make it in a soft yarn in a color of your 
choice, and you’ll end up with a subtly textured striped scarf.

Materials and vital statistics
 
 Measurements: 12 inches x 60 inches
 
 Yarn: Heavy worsted-weight yarn; approximately 300 yards
 
 Needles: One pair of size US 10 (6 mm) needles; tapestry needle for 
weaving in the ends
 
 Gauge: Not crucial to this project
Directions
Note: Because this scarf takes more than one skein of yarn, you must know 
how to join a new skein when the first one runs out. For instructions, see the 
sidebar “Joining yarn.”)
Cast on 38 sts.
Rows 1, 3, 5–11, 13, 15, and 16: Knit.
Rows 2, 4, 12, and 14: Purl.
 
To discourage the edges from rolling in, work a selvedge stitch on the edges 
by knitting the first and last stitch of every row.
Repeat these 16 rows until your scarf reaches the desired length. End the 
scarf by working Rows 1–5.
With the WS facing, bind off by knitting every stitch for the final garter stitch 
ridge.
Weave in the loose ends.
Joining yarn
When you run out of yarn as you’re knitting, you 
need to join a new ball of yarn to the end of the 
old ball. When possible, start a new ball of yarn 
on an edge that will be enclosed in a seam (try 
not to start a new ball of yarn on an edge that 
will be exposed). To join yarn at an edge, knit 
the first stitch of the next row with both ends 
held together, drop the old strand, and carry on. 
Or knit the first few stitches with the new yarn 
only, stop, and tie the two ends together tempo-
rarily in a bow to secure them. Either way, leave 
the ends at least 4 or 5 inches long so you can 
weave them in later.
If you run out of yarn in the middle of a row, your 
options are the same: Tie a temporary knot with 
both yarns, leaving 4- or 5-inch ends; or knit the 
next stitch with both strands, drop the old one, 
and continue knitting from the new ball.

152
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Finishing
Gently steam or wet block the scarf (that is, get it wet, gently press out the 
excess moisture, and then lay it out to dry).
Variations
You can express your creativity — and practice new skills at the same time — 
by altering the basic Garter Ridge Scarf in either of the following ways:
 
 Work the scarf in a yarn of a different weight and with the appropriate 
needles.
 
 Make the scarf multicolored by using different colors of yarns.
Two-Way Hat
The hats in this section are based on the same basic principle: Adult human 
heads are about the same size (give or take a little), and these hats will fit no 
matter what yarn you use so long as they’re knitted in the round with some 
decreases at the top. A good way to make sure a hat will fit is to try it on after 
you’ve knit 1 or 2 inches; rip out the existing stitches and move up or down a 
needle size if the hat’s a little too small or too big.
Plain Hat with Rolled Brim
This most basic of hats is nicely shaped for just about every head size. Add 
any stitch pattern you like after knitting the first 5 rounds. If you stop the 
stitch pattern just before the decreases, you don’t have to worry about 
adjusting the decreases to the pattern.
Materials and vital statistics
 
 Measurements: 21 inches in diameter x 71/2 inches
 
 Yarn: Worsted-weight wool; 100 yards
 
 Needles: One 16-inch size US 7 (41/2 mm) and size US 8 (5 mm) circular 
needle; four or five size US 8 (5 mm) dpns; yarn needle to weave in ends
 
 Other materials: Stitch marker
 
 Gauge: 4 stitches and 6 rows per 1 inch
Directions
Using a size US 7 circular needle, cast on 80 sts. Join round, being careful not 
to twist the stitches, and place marker to denote beginning of round.

153
 Chapter 2: Knitting Basics
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
Knit 5 rounds.
Switch to size US 8 needles and knit 5 inches.
Begin decreases:
Note: Decreases (and increases) are essential in patterns that require shap-
ing. The notation k2tog means “knit two stitches together.” To perform this 
maneuver, you knit the next two stitches at the same time (instead of insert-
ing the RH needle into one stitch on the LH needle, you insert it into two 
stitches and then knit as you normally would by wrapping your yarn around 
the needle and pulling the loop through both stitches at the same time). In 
this pattern, the decreases create the hat’s shaped crown.
Round 1: * K8, k2tog; rep from * to end of round.
Round 2 and all even rounds: Knit without decreasing.
Round 3: * K7, k2tog; rep from * to end of round.
Round 5: * K6, k2tog; rep from * to end of round.
Round 7: * K5, k2tog; rep from * to end of round.
Note: At this point, you may want to switch to double-pointed needles (dpns) 
because the diameter of the round is much smaller than the circular needle’s 
length. Simply distribute the remaining stitches evenly over three or four 
dpns and knit with the remaining needle (the fourth or fifth, depending on 
how many you’re using).
Round 9: * K4, k2tog; rep from * to end of round.
Round 11: * K3, k2tog; rep from * to end of round.
Round 13: * K2, k2tog; rep from * to end of round.
Round 15 to end: Continue knitting (* k2, k2tog *) until fewer than 10 
stitches remain.
Cut yarn, leaving at least a 12-inch tail.
Finishing
Thread tail onto yarn needle and slip remaining stitches onto yarn needle. Pull 
opening closed, push yarn tail to reverse side of fabric, and weave in ends.

Ribbed Watchman’s Cap
This classically masculine hat looks great on women, too — just choose a 
bright color. Patterned yarn such as a handpainted, multishade colorway will 
be broken up by the 3-stitch rib, which is an interesting visual effect.
Materials and vital statistics
 
 Measurements: 21 inches in diameter x 71/2 inches
 
 Yarn: Worsted-weight wool; 125 yards
 
 Needles: One 16-inch size US 9 (51/2 mm) circular needle; four or five size 
US 9 dpns; yarn or tapestry needle
 
 Gauge: 4 stitches and 6 rows per 1 inch
Directions
Cast on 84 sts.
* K3, p3; rep from * until piece measures 6 inches.
Begin decreases (Note: if you don’t know how to decrease, refer to the direc-
tions for the Plain Hat with Rolled Brim):
Round 1: * P1, p2tog, k3; rep from * to end of round (70 sts).
Round 2: * P2, k3; rep from * to end of round.
Round 3: * P2, k1, k2tog; rep from * to end of round (56 sts).
Round 4: * P2, k2; rep from * to end of round.
Round 5: * P2tog, k2; rep from * to end of round (42 sts).
Round 6: * P1, k2; rep from * to end of round.
Round 7: * P1, k2tog; rep from * to end of round (28 sts). Switch to dpns, 
dividing stitches evenly.
Round 8: * P1, k1; rep from * to end of round.
Round 9: * K2tog; rep from * to end of round (14 sts).
Round 10: * K2tog; rep from * to end of round (7 sts).
Cut yarn, leaving at least a 12-inch tail.
Finishing
Thread tail onto yarn needle and slip remaining stitches onto yarn needle. Pull 
opening closed, push yarn tail to reverse side of fabric, and weave in ends.

Hand-Sewing Basics
In This Chapter
 Getting your sewing supplies together
 Finding out about fabric
 Becoming familiar with basic hand-sewing stitches
 Trying out practice projects
G
etting to admire a project you’ve completed using beautiful fabrics and 
hand-stitching is very gratifying, and you’re likely to hear praise from 
friends and family, too. On top of that, you can save money sewing. Wow, 
what a hobby!
This chapter lists the tools you need to hand-sew and explains basic hand-
sewing techniques and how to read a sewing pattern — info that can come 
in handy if you extend your repertoire into more complex sewing projects. 
It also includes basic hand-sewing tasks, like hemming, and a few simple but 
great-looking projects. After you have a couple of projects under your belt, 
chances are you’ll love to sew.
This chapter focuses on hand-sewing. Machine-sewing is the preferred 
method for garment construction and complex projects. For the details on 
everything you need to know about machine-sewing, check out Sewing For 
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Janice Saunders Maresh (Wiley).
Assembling Your Sewing Kit
Like most hobbies, successful sewing projects begin with a few good tools, 
a few basic supplies, and a little know-how. The first section details hand-
sewing tools that any hand-sewer needs. The second section explains notions 
that you’re likely to need or encounter in the patterns you buy. The rest of 
the chapter is dedicated to know-how.

156
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Common hand-sewing tools
Sure, you can collect some of these tools from your household — those old 
scissors from the garage, the ruler from your desk drawer, and pins scav-
enged from freshly opened dress shirts — but you’ll have a better sewing 
experience if you use tools intended for the job.
On pins and needles
Needles come in many shapes, sizes, and types. The needle you select 
depends on the fabric you use and the project you want to sew. Generally, 
the finer the fabric you work with, the finer the needle, and the heavier the 
fabric, the heavier the needle. When selecting needles for hand-sewing, 
choose a variety pack, which gives you from five to ten needles of various 
lengths and thicknesses. Some even have different-sized eyes. In a pinch, you 
can use any hand needle as long as the point can easily penetrate the fabric 
and the eye doesn’t shred the thread.
You need pins to sew. I recommend using long, fine, glass-head pins. The 
glass head fits comfortably in your fingers when you pin through multiple 
layers of fabric, and the extra length makes pinning more secure. Plus, if 
you accidentally press or iron over the glass heads, they don’t melt like the 
plastic ones may.
Thimbles
Thimbles are essential for hand-sewing. Although your fingers are fabulous 
tools, they leave a little to be desired when it comes to pushing a needle 
through heavy thicknesses of fabric. Thimbles, which are like little hard hats 
for fingers, protect the soft pads of your fingers from potential pain. They 
come in a variety of sizes; choose one that comfortably fits the middle finger 
on your dominant hand.
Scissors and seam rippers
Although you can buy a variety of sewing scissors, I recommend 8-inch bent 
dressmaker’s shears and 5-inch trimming shears. The bent dressmaker’s 
shears are the best tool for cutting fabric. The bent-angle blade gives your 
index finger a place to rest when you have a long cutting job, and it prevents 
you from lifting the fabric off the table, ensuring a more accurate cut. The 
trimming scissors come in handy for trimming smaller areas on a project and 
for clipping threads.
 
When shopping for shears or scissors, make sure you test them on a variety 
of fabrics. They should cut all the way to the tips of the blades.
When you make mistakes (which you will), you need a seam ripper to rip out 
(or unsew) the stitches. A seam ripper is a little tool with a point that lifts 
the stitch off the fabric as the blade cuts the thread. Note: You can’t sharpen 
seam rippers; so when one becomes dull, buy another.

157
 Chapter 3: Hand-Sewing Basics
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
Tape measure
All kinds of tape measures are available. A plastic-coated fabric tape measure is 
a good choice. This tape doesn’t stretch, so you always get accurate measure-
ments. Most tapes are 5/8-inch wide, the width of a standard seam allowance, 
and 60 inches long. Many tapes come with both metric and U.S. measurements 
and are two-toned, so you can readily see when the tape is twisted.
 
Keep your tape measure handy by draping it around your neck, but remem-
ber to take if off when you leave the house — no one is likely to see it as a 
fashion statement.
Fabric markers
To help you match up your fabric pattern pieces exactly the right way, the 
pattern for a project includes match points, called notches and dots, which 
are printed right on the pattern tissue. To use these match points, you have 
to transfer them from the pattern to the fabric, using fabric markers. You can 
choose from a variety: disappearing dressmaker’s chalk, wash-out pencil, 
vanishing marker, and so on. The one you choose depends primarily on the 
fabric you want to mark. Some are better for light-colored fabrics; others are 
better for dark-colored fabrics. If you’re not sure which to select, the clerk at 
the fabric store can guide you.
Irons
When you sew, you need a good iron. Choose one that has a variety of heat 
settings and can make steam. Also, choose an iron that has a smooth, non-
stick soleplate (the part that heats up); these are easy to clean.
You also need a press cloth to place between the iron and the fabric to pre-
vent shine and over-pressing. Use a clean, white or off-white, 100-percent 
cotton or linen tea towel or napkin, or purchase a press cloth.
Keeping your shears and scissors sharp
Dull scissors can make cutting a real drag: You 
have to work twice as hard to use them, and the 
results aren’t nearly as good. Keep your shears 
and scissors sharp so they’re a pleasure to use.
If you want to keep your scissors sharp, the first 
rule is to not use them to cut anything you don’t 
normally cut when sewing: that means no cut-
ting plastic, cardboard, wire, and the like. The 
blades become rough and dull and not only will 
they chew or snag your fabric, but they’ll also 
wear out your hand when you try to use them. 
The second rule? Have them sharpened peri-
odically. Most sewing machine dealers sharpen 
scissors and shears. In addition, many fabric 
stores have a scissors-sharpener who visits the 
store periodically. After the pro finishes sharp-
ening your shears or scissors, check to see that 
they cut to the point.

158
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Threads and notions
Obviously, you can’t sew without thread. All-purpose sewing thread is the 
type and weight of thread that works well for most fabrics. You can find sev-
eral all-purpose brands at your local fabric store. When choosing a thread, 
unwrap a strand and place it on your fabric. You want the thread color to be 
slightly darker than your fabric for a good match.
But you often need other things too: tapes, trimmings, ribbons, piping, laces, 
elastics, zippers, and so on, all of which are lumped together under the cat-
egory of sewing notions or findings. If you’re using a pattern, the back of the 
pattern envelope tells you exactly which notions you need for a particular 
project. Common notions include
 
 Bias tape: Bias tape is a long, continuous strip of woven cotton/polyester-
blend fabric. Bias tape conforms to a straight edge, such as a seam allow-
ance, and can be easily shaped to fit a curve or hem edge. Bias tape comes 
in several configurations, including single-fold, extra-wide, double-fold, 
hem facing, and hem tape.
 
 Elastic: Elastic comes in many different configurations and widths to 
accommodate various uses. For example, drawstring elastic has a drawstring 
running through the center of it — perfect for use in drawstring shorts 
and sweat pants — and elastic braid is used in waist or wrist casings.
 
 Ribbons: Ribbons come in hundreds, if not thousands, of configurations, 
fiber contents, widths, colors, finishes, and textures. Grosgrain ribbon, 
for example, has a ribbed texture and is very easy to sew. You can 
use ribbons for everything from trimming apparel to decorating floral 
arrangements.
 
 Zippers: Zippers come in a variety of types and configurations, such 
as conventional nylon coil zippers, invisible zippers (those that, when 
sewn in properly, end up looking like a seam), and molded-tooth zippers 
(which have zipper teeth made either of metal or nylon).
 
 Fasteners: This category includes things like buttons, snaps, hooks and 
eyes, and so on — basically, the things that keep your blouse from pop-
ping open and your pants from falling down. These come in a variety of 
sizes, shapes, and colors.
Choosing the Right Fabric
You can often find a list of recommended fabrics on the back of your pat-
tern envelope. If you’re new to sewing, don’t stray from the advice on the 
envelope concerning the choice of fabric, or the final product may not look 

159
 Chapter 3: Hand-Sewing Basics
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
as good or fit as well as you intended, even if you achieve the color you 
want. When you make something from a pattern you create yourself, it helps 
to know the characteristics and advantages and disadvantages of common 
fabric types. This information not only comes in handy when selecting fabric 
but also when buying clothes off the rack.
Becoming familiar with fabric types
Although you can sew any fabric by hand with the right needle and thread, 
doing so can be very challenging. Heavier and thicker fabrics are more dif-
ficult to hand-sew, as are very sheer, slippery fabrics. In addition, the result-
ing seam may not be strong enough to tolerate much wear and tear. For that 
reason, the following list sticks with fabrics that are practically guaranteed to 
give you hand-sewing success and nice, strong seams. These fabrics are avail-
able by the yard:
 
 Broadcloth: A light- to mid-weight, evenly woven cotton or silk fabric used 
in men’s shirts. Broadcloth is also made in wool for fine wool suiting.
 
 Chambray: A light- to mid-weight, evenly woven cotton or cotton blend 
you find in work clothes, shirts, and pajamas. Chambray is usually made 
with a colored warp yarn and a white filler yarn. This fabric resembles 
denim but is lighter in weight.
 
 Denim: A strong, mid- to heavy-weight, twill weave fabric in which the 
warp yarn is a color (usually blue) and the filler yarn is white. Denim is 
available in many weights, depending on the end use, and is great for 
jeans, jackets, skirts, and home decor projects.
 
 Flannel: A light- to mid-weight, plain or twill weave cotton or wool 
fabric. Cotton flannel that’s brushed has a soft, fluffy surface and is used 
for work shirts and pajamas. Wool flannel isn’t usually brushed and is 
used as a suiting.
 
 Fleece: A light- to heavy-weight, hydrophobic (water-hating), double-
sided, polyester knit used in pullovers, jackets, mittens, booties, blan-
kets, slippers, and scarves. A common trade name for this type of fleece 
is Polarfleece. You can also find sweatshirts in fleece made with cotton 
and cotton/polyester blends.
Reading fabric labels
In the fabric store, you see the fabric wrapped around bolts — cardboard 
flats or round tubes. Flat bolts of fabric stand at attention on tables, and 
tube-type bolts are stored upright in a rack or threaded with a wooden dowel 

160
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
and hung horizontally for easy viewing. At the end of flat bolts, you find a 
label that tells you many important things about the fabric, including the 
fiber content, care instructions, price per yard, and, often, the manufacturer. 
Tube bolts often have a hangtag that contains the same information as the 
bolt-end label.
The fabric’s width determines how much fabric to purchase for a particular 
project. Reading the back of your project’s pattern envelope helps deter-
mine how much fabric to buy based on the fabric width. (See the section 
“Understanding the pattern and its parts” for more information on reading 
pattern envelopes.) The most common fabric widths are as follows:
 
 42 to 48 inches wide: Most woven cotton, cotton blend, novelty print, 
dressmaking, and quilting fabrics come in this width.
 
 54 to 60 inches wide: Many knits, woolens, and home decor fabrics 
come in this width.
Occasionally, you find a fabric that is 72 inches wide, and sheer fabrics, such 
as bridal tulle, come up to 120 inches wide.
Getting to know your fabric
Before you do any sewing with any piece of fabric, you need to understand 
some basic fabric terminology. Why? Understanding the parts of the fabric 
and cutting your pattern pieces on-grain means that seams stay pressed 
and straight, pant legs and sleeves don’t twist when you wear them, and the 
creases in your pants stay perpendicular to the ground. Take a look at Figure 3-1
to get acquainted with fabric’s four key facets:
 
 Selvages: The finished edges where the fabric comes off the looms; the 
selvages are parallel to the lengthwise grain.
 
 Lengthwise grain or grainline: The grainline runs the length of the 
fabric, parallel to the selvages. On knit fabrics, the lengthwise grain is 
usually more stable and less stretchy than the crosswise grain.
 
 Crosswise grain: This grain runs across the width of the fabric, from sel-
vage to selvage, perpendicular to the lengthwise grain. On knit fabrics, 
most of the stretch is usually across this grain.
 
 Bias: 45 degrees between the lengthwise and crosswise grains.

Fundamentals of Hand-Sewing
Used to be most people (yes, men too) knew how to thread a needle and per-
form basic stitches. Then along came the sewing machine and manufactured 
clothing, and hand-sewing (except for the occasional mending job) and the 
skills that went with it fell by the wayside. Well, this section reintroduces you 
to these fundamental skills.
Threading a needle
To begin threading a hand needle, reel off a strand of thread about 18 to 24 
inches long. Longer threads tend to tangle and wear out before you use them 
up. Starting with the end of the thread that comes off the spool first, cut the 
thread cleanly and at an angle with a sharp pair of scissors. Cutting at an 

162
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
angle puts a little point on the thread so that it slips easily through the eye. 
Here’s a little pointer: The cheapest sewing notion you can find is your own 
saliva. Moisten the thread end to help it glide right through the needle’s eye.
 
Some needles have very small eyes; some people have very poor eyesight. 
A needle threader, which you can find at your local sewing supply store, can 
help with tight threading situations. To use a needle threader, poke the fine 
wire through the eye of the needle, push the thread end through the wire 
loop, and then pull. The wire grabs the thread and pulls it through the nee-
dle’s eye, as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
Figure 3-2: 
Threading a 
needle with 
a needle 
threader.
 
Self-threading hand needles make threading even easier. To use a self-
threading needle, hold the needle and a length of thread in one hand. Pull the 
thread end across the self-threading eye so that the thread lies in the notch. 
Snap the thread into the notch until it clips into place, as shown in Figure 3-3. 
If the thread keeps coming unthreaded after many uses, you’ve worn out the 
self-threading eye, so throw away the needle and use a new one.

Tying the knot
To stop the thread from pulling completely through the fabric when you sew, 
you need a knot at the thread’s end. The following steps tell both lefties and 
righties how to tie a sewing knot:
 
1. Hold the thread between your thumb and index fingers and wrap a 
loop of thread around the tip of your opposite index finger, as shown 
in Figure 3-4.
 
Figure 3-4: 
Make 
a loop.
 
 
2. Roll the loop between your finger and against your thumb so that the 
loop twists, as shown in Figure 3-5.

164

Figure 3-5: 
Twist 
the loop.
 
 
3. Slide your index finger back while rolling the thread until the loop is 
almost off your finger, as shown in Figure 3-6.
 
4. Bring your middle finger to the twisted end of the loop, remove your 
index finger, and firmly place the middle finger in front of the twisted 
thread against the thumb, as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
5. Pull on the thread with the opposite hand to close the loop and form 
the knot.

to the end of 
your finger.

Common hand-sewn stitches
Any given sewing job may entail one of several types of stitches, and you 
definitely need the right stitch for the job. For example, you shouldn’t use 
a hand-basting stitch to permanently sew together a pair of overalls; the 
stitches are too far apart, and your overalls fall apart the first time you 
attempt to lift that bale or tote that barge. In this section, I familiarize you 
with the basic hand stitches and their uses.
The securing stitch
In hand-sewing, you secure the end of a stitch by sewing a knot — regardless 
of the type of stitch. To sew a knot, take a small backstitch and form a loop 
over the point of the needle. When you pull the thread through the loop, it 
cinches the thread and secures a knot at the base of the fabric (see Figure 3-8). 
When securing a high-stress area, sew two knots.
The hand-basting stitch
You use hand-basting stitches to temporarily hold two or more layers of 
fabric together. Each basting stitch should be about 1/4-inch long with less 
than 1/4 inch between stitches.
 
For hand-basting, choose a color of thread that contrasts with the fabric. 
This makes the stitches easier to find and pull out after you sew in the perma-
nent stitches.
Working from right to left (for right-handers) or from left to right (for left-
handers), weave the point of the needle in and out of the fabric, working it 
through the fabric (see Figure 3-9).
The running stitch
You use this very short, even stitch for fine seaming, mending, and gather-
ing. The stitch is short and tight and, as a result, is usually permanent. Use it 
for quickly closing a torn seam. To make a running stitch, weave the point of 
the needle in and out of the fabric making very short (1/16-inch), even stitches 
before pulling the needle through the fabric (see Figure 3-10).
 
Figure 3-8: 
Use this 
technique 
to securely 
fasten a 
hand-sewn 
stitch.

The even backstitch
The even backstitch is the strongest hand stitch. Because of its durability, this 
stitch is useful for repairing seams on fabrics that are denser or heavier than 
those you would repair with the running stitch. To create the even backstitch, 
pull the needle up through the fabric and poke the needle back into the fabric 
half a stitch behind where the thread first emerged. Bring the needle up half a 
stitch in front of where the thread first emerged (see Figure 3-11). Repeat for 
the length of the seam.

strong.

The blind hemming stitch
You take these stitches inside the hem allowance between the hem and the 
garment. With a little practice, a fine needle, and fine thread, good blind hem-
ming stitches don’t show on the right side — hence the name blind.
You need to turn up the hem allowance and press it into place before you use 
the blind hemming stitch. You should also finish the edge of the hem by pink-
ing the edge (cutting it with pinking shears).
Fold the hem allowance back 3/8 inch and take the first short stitch 1/4 inch 
from the hem edge. Take the next short stitch by catching only a thread of 
the fabric. Continue with stitches spaced about 1/2 inch apart, catching the 
hem allowance in a stitch and taking as fine a stitch as possible into the gar-
ment. Stitch back and forth between the hem allowance and the garment 
around the hemline until you complete the blind hemming (see Figure 3-12).
 
Figure 3-12: 
Blind hems 
require fine 
stitches 
about 
1/2 inch apart.
 
The slant hemming stitch
This stitch is the fastest — but least durable — of the hemming stitches 
because so much thread is on the surface of the hem edge. (If you’ve ever 
caught your heel in your hem and pulled it out, you may be the victim of a 
slant hemming stitch.) So use the slant hemming stitch only if you’re in a 
hurry and you’re hemming the bottom of a blouse that you tuck in. Take a 
stitch around the hem edge and then up through the garment, catching only 
a thread of the garment fabric (see Figure 3-13).
The hemming slipstitch
You use the hemming slipstitch when working with (guess what?) a folded 
hem edge. This stitch is very durable and almost invisible. Fasten the thread 
to the hem allowance by poking the needle through the fold of the hem edge 
and bringing it up through the fabric. With the point of the needle, pick up 
one thread from the garment and work the needle back into the fold of the 
hem edge (see Figure 3-14). Then repeat the process.

The even slipstitch
You can join two folded edges by using the even slipstitch. Most often, this 
stitch comes into play when you want to repair a seam from the right side 
because the seam is difficult to reach from the wrong side of the project.
Fasten the thread and bring it out at the edge of the fold. Taking fine stitches, 
work the needle, slipping it through the fold on one edge and drawing the 
thread taut. Take another stitch, slipping the needle through the opposite, 
folded edge (see Figure 3-15).

stitch to join

Working with Patterns
Most hand-sewing projects, like those included in this chapter, don’t require 
sewing patterns. But if the project you’re working on is particularly complex, 
or if you’ve decided to hand-sew (or machine-sew) a garment, you’ll need to 
know how to decipher a standard sewing pattern.
Patterns are marketed in several ways:
 
 Through pattern magazines: Most bookstores and grocery stores carry 
a selection of these on their newsstands.
 
 In pattern catalogs at fabric stores: These catalogs are organized into 
categories ranging from dresses and children’s clothing to crafts and 
home decor projects. Within these sections, you often find patterns cat-
egorized by degree of difficulty, with emphasis placed on projects that 
are easy to sew.
 
 On display or spinner racks at fabric stores: Specially priced and pro-
motional patterns are often featured this way.
 
 Through online pattern vendors: You can check out Simplicity pat-
terns at www.simplicity.com and Butterick, McCall’s, and Vogue 
patterns at www.mccall.com. Or for more options, enter the type of 
pattern you’re looking for into your search engine’s browser.
Regional and national fabric chain stores often carry fabrics and patterns 
for both clothing and home decorating, plus everything else you need to 
complete clothing, home decor, crafting, and quilting projects, and more. 
Stores that specialize in home decorating fabrics usually don’t carry clothing 
patterns.
 
Even a pattern labeled easy or quick may be difficult and time-consuming for 
a rookie. Many pattern instruction writers assume that you have a certain 
amount of general sewing knowledge. If you’re a real beginner, look for pat-
terns with few seams and simple lines.
 
The Sewing For Dummies patterns, published by Simplicity Pattern Company, 
are a perfect choice. They have the latest projects and the easiest-to-follow 
sewing directions you can find. If you’re in a quandary about a particular pat-
tern, have a sales associate at the fabric store help you.
Understanding the pattern and its parts
Few things are more intimidating than trying to figure out all the hieroglyphics 
on the various parts of a pattern, as shown in Figure 3-16.

170
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
Figure 3-16: 
Front and 
back of 
a pattern 
envelope.
 
Info on the outside of the pattern
On the front of the pattern envelope, you often see several style variations 
of the same project. In the world of sewing, people call these style variations 
views. One view may have a collar, long sleeves, and cuffs. Another view may 
have a V-neck and short sleeves. In home decor patterns, you may have sev-
eral views in one pattern for a basic window treatment. Another pattern may 
have several pillow views. Views simply give you style options for creating 
the same basic project.

171
 Chapter 3: Hand-Sewing Basics
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
The back of a pattern envelope contains the following information about your 
project:
 
 The back of the project in detail: The front of the pattern usually just 
shows the front of your project. The back of the pattern shows you the 
back of the project. You see details like kick pleats or a back zipper — 
information you may want to know before buying the pattern.
 
 A description of the project by view: Always read the description of a 
project on the back of the pattern envelope. Drawings and photographs 
can deceive, but this written description tells you exactly what you’re 
getting.
 
 How much fabric to buy: This information is based on the width of 
the fabric you choose, the view you make, your size, and whether your 
fabric has nap or not. If your fabric has nap, the pattern requires you to 
buy a little more fabric.
 
 A list of notions needed for specific views: These notions include 
items such as the number and size of buttons, the zipper length and 
type, elastic width and length, shoulder pad style and size, hooks and 
eyes, and so on.
Info on the inside of the pattern
Inside your pattern envelope, you find the following items necessary for your 
project:
 
 Pattern pieces: Some pattern pieces are printed on large pieces of tissue 
paper. Others are printed on sturdy pieces of white paper and are called 
master patterns.
 
 Key and glossary: These references help you decipher the markings on 
the pattern pieces.
 
 Pattern layout: This guide shows you how to lay out the pattern pieces 
on the fabric for each view.
 
 Step-by-step instructions for putting the project together: The proj-
ect instructions may run more than one page. If so, staple the pages 
together in the upper-left corner and post them in front of you as you 
sew. You can easily check off each step as you finish it.
 
Some home decor projects, such as pillow patterns, include tissue or paper 
pattern pieces. Others, such as sofa slipcovers and some window treatments, 
don’t include a paper pattern because there’s no standard size or style of 
sofa or window. In these patterns, you find printed, step-by-step instructions 
that look like the pattern guide sheet that comes with a typical pattern.

172
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Decoding the pattern pieces
Look at your pattern pieces. You have only one sleeve, half of a front top, 
half of a back top, half of a facing, half of a collar, and so on. Did the company 
forget to print the whole pattern? No. You fold the fabric in half the long way 
(usually with the right side of the fabric to the inside), and then you lay the 
pattern pieces out and cut them on a double fabric layer. So most of the time, 
you need only half of the pattern to make a complete garment.
In addition to identifying information (the pattern number, name of the pat-
tern piece, and letter or number of the pattern piece), all pattern pieces have 
the following information (Figure 3-17 shows the full gambit of markings you 
may find on a pattern piece):
 
 Grainline: The most important pattern marking, the grainline symbol 
is a straight line that usually has arrowheads at each end. The grainline 
parallels the selvages (finished edges) of the fabric.
 
 Size: Many pattern pieces show several sizes. Each size is marked 
clearly, so you shouldn’t have too much trouble keeping them straight.
 
 Number of pieces you need to cut: Often, you need to cut more than 
one of each pattern piece.
 
 Cutting line: This heavy, outer line on the pattern piece lets you know 
where to cut. Sometimes you see scissors symbols on this line.
 
 Seam line or stitching line: You usually find this broken line 1/4 to 5/8 
inch inside the cutting line. Multiple-sized patterns may not have a seam 
line printed on the pattern. Read the pattern guide sheet to determine 
the width of the seam allowance.
 
 Notches: You use these diamond-shaped match points on the cutting 
line for accurately joining pattern pieces together. You may find single 
notches, double notches, and triple notches all on one pattern.
 
 Circles, dots, triangles, or squares: These shapes indicate additional 
match points that aid in the construction, fit, and ease in putting the 
project together. For example, large dots on the pattern may indicate 
where you gather a waistline.
 
 Place-on-fold brackets or symbols: Use these symbols to lay out the 
pattern piece exactly on the fold, which is also the lengthwise grain of 
the fabric. When you cut out the pattern piece and remove the paper 
pattern, the fabric opens into a full piece.

173
 Chapter 3: Hand-Sewing Basics
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
 
 Directional stitching symbols: These symbols, which often look like 
small arrows or presser feet symbols, indicate the direction you sew 
when sewing the seam.
 
 The hemline: This direction on the pattern shows the recommended 
finished length of the project, which varies from person to person. But, 
even though the hemline may vary, the hem allowance (the recom-
mended distance from the hemline to the cut edge) doesn’t.

Preparing your fabric
Using fabric straight off the bolt is a little like eating an unbaked apple pie: 
You can do it, but the results aren’t going to be good. Before laying and cut-
ting out your project and before sewing a stitch, do the following:

174
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
1. Preshrink your fabric to see how it behaves (how much it shrinks, 
whether the colors run, and so on).
 
 For washable fabrics, preshrink your fabric as you would the finished 
project. For example, if you plan to wash your finished garment in the 
washing machine with regular-strength detergent and then dry it in the 
dryer, wash and dry your fabric in the same way to preshrink it.
 
2. Press your fabric smooth and flat, and refold it to the original bolt 
fold so that the selvages are even.
 
3. Examine the refolded fabric and, if necessary, pull the fabric back on 
grain.
 
 When you fold it in half so the selvages are together, are the raw edges 
perpendicular to the selvages and the selvages parallel to one another? 
If so, the fabric is ready for the layout and cutting process. If not, the 
fabric may have been cut off the bolt unevenly, or the fabric needs to be 
pulled back on grain. To do so, unfold the fabric again, pull it on the bias 
(refer to Figure 3-1 for the bias), and straighten it. If you have a large 
piece of fabric, get a helper to pull the yardage from one corner while 
you pull on the yardage from the opposite corner.
 
You also want to preshrink any trims, tapes, and piping you plan to use with 
your project: Wrap them around your hand and remove your hand from the 
trim, creating a hank. Put a rubber band around the hank and wash it along 
with the project’s fabric. Note that upholstery fabrics, which are often dry 
clean only, do not need to be preshrunk.
Laying out the pattern
Once your fabric is preshrunk and pressed (explained in the preceding sec-
tion), you’re ready to lay out your pattern. Follow these steps to lay the pat-
tern pieces on the fabric:
 
1. Find and cut apart the paper pattern pieces you need to make your 
project view; set them aside.
 
 When you cut the paper pattern pieces apart, don’t cut them out right 
on the cutting line; leave a little of the paper past the cutting line. 
Leaving the extra paper makes cutting out the paper pieces faster and 
easier.
 
2. Locate the lengthwise grain or place-on-fold symbols on the paper 
pattern pieces.
 
 Before laying the pattern on the fabric, mark these symbols with a high-
lighter for easy reference.

175
 Chapter 3: Hand-Sewing Basics
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
 
3. Fold and lay the fabric on a table or cutting board, as shown in the 
pattern guide sheet instructions.
 
 The right side of the fabric is the pretty side that everyone sees. The 
wrong side of the fabric is the inside that nobody sees when you wear 
the project. When you lay out the pattern for cutting, be sure that you 
lay out all the pattern pieces as shown in your pattern guide sheet 
instructions. The pattern guide sheet shows the right side of the fabric 
shaded in a darker color than the wrong side of the fabric, so you can 
see what’s going on in the step-by-step illustrations.
 
 If the fabric is longer than your table or cutting board, prevent the 
excess fabric weight from stretching and pulling on your fabric by fold-
ing it and laying it on the end of the table.
 
4. Following the layout the pattern guide sheet suggests, lay out the pat-
tern on-grain, making sure that the grainline is parallel to the selvages 
as shown in Figure 3-18.
 
Figure 3-18: 
The grain-
line of your 
pattern 
should be 
parallel to 
the selvages 
when you 
lay out a 
pattern. 
Off grain
 
 Check that each pattern piece is placed precisely on-grain by poking a 
pin straight down into one end of the grainline, measuring the distance 
from the grainline to the selvage, and then pivoting the paper pattern 
until the opposite end of the grainline measures exactly the same dis-
tance from the selvage. However, use this technique only if a cutting 
board or table pad protects your tabletop.
Now you’re ready for pinning and cutting, explained in the next section.
Pinning and cutting out your pieces
Pin the pattern piece to the doubled layer of fabric so that the pins go 
through both fabric layers and are perpendicular to and on the inside of the 
cutting line. This prevents the fabric from shifting during the cutting process. 

176
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
(You don’t need to pin every inch. Just pin at the notches and everywhere 
the pattern changes direction. On long, straight edges, such as pant legs and 
sleeve seams, place pins every 4 inches or so.)
Cut out your pattern pieces using a pair of sharp dressmaker’s shears. For 
accuracy, cut in the middle of the solid cutting line marked on the pattern 
tissue, trying not to lift the fabric off the table too much when cutting.
 
Rather than cutting around each individual notch, save time by cutting 
straight across the notches on the cutting line. After you completely cut 
out the pattern piece, go back and, with the tip of your sharp scissors, snip 
into the notch about 1/4 inch. A single notch gets one snip in the center of 
the notch; a double notch gets two snips, one in the center of each notch; a 
triple notch gets three snips. When you go to match up the pattern pieces at 
the notches, just match up the snips — a fast and accurate task.
Making marks that matter
After you cut out the pattern pieces, you’re ready for marking. Marking is 
important because you don’t want to get halfway through a project, notice 
that the pattern guide sheet tells you to sew from this mark to that mark, and 
realize that you forgot to mark something (or thought it wasn’t important). 
So dutifully mark all dots, circles, triangles, squares, darts, pleats, and tucks.
Projects You Can Sew by Hand
If you consider that folks have been sewing since humankind moved out 
of draped animal skins, you realize that anything you can sew by machine 
today — garments, home decor, and more — you can sew by hand as well. 
The projects in this section are designed to give you practice mastering the 
small, even stitches that are the hallmark of all skillful hand-sewing.

To make this project, you need the following materials in addition to the 
usual sewing implements (see the earlier section “Common hand-sewing 
tools”):
 
 One 18-inch pillow form
 
 1/2 yard of 48- or 54-inch-wide home decor fabric
 
 Thread that matches the fabric
 
 One-yard bullion fringe to coordinate with the fabric
Follow these steps to create the pillow:
 
1. Cut the fabric into an 18-x-46-inch rectangle, as shown in Figure 3-19.

4. Place the trim on the right side of the fabric, centering it on the sides 
of the fabric so that the lip edge of the fringe is even with the raw 
edges.
 
5. Fold the short ends toward the center, right sides together, so that the 
pillow cover measures 18 inches square, as shown in Figure 3-21.
 
 The short ends overlap each other about 41/2 inches and sandwich the 
bullion fringe in the seam line.

6. On both sides of the pillow cover, sew a 1/2-inch seam, using the even 
backstitch for the entire seam and the securing stitch at both ends of 
each seam.
 
7. Press the seams flat and together.
 
8. Turn the pillow cover right side out, and pop the pillow form into the 
cover through the opening in the back.
Trimming sheets and towels
Want to get the most bang for your sewing buck? Buy towels and sheets on 
sale and add your own trim. It takes just minutes and about 4 yards of lace 
to turn the ordinary into Wow! You can use a similar technique to coordinate 
your towels and shower curtain. You can even personalize towels for your 
family members by using a different trim for each person. It just takes a little 
know-how.

Decorating sheets
Mail-order catalogs are a great source of decorating ideas. Catalogs like these 
have been known to feature lace-trimmed sheet and pillowcase sets that 
retail for hundreds of dollars. You can knock off these linens for a fraction of 
that price by adding a little lace trim to the hems of plain sheets you buy on 
sale. In this section, you find out how to add lace to your linens.
To make this project, you need the following materials in addition to the 
usual sewing implements (see the earlier section “Common hand-sewing 
tools”):
 
 One flat sheet
 
 Two pillowcases
 
 Four yards of lace or trim for a full or queen sheet and pillowcases; five 
yards of lace for a king sheet and pillowcases
 
 Thread to match the lace or trim
Follow these steps to add new life to your sheets:
 
1. Preshrink the sheets and lace the way you plan to care for the sheets 
(refer to the earlier section “Preparing your fabric” for info on pre-
shrinking).
 
 If you’re using polyester lace on cotton/poly-blend sheets, preshrink 
only the sheets. Polyester doesn’t shrink, but cotton does.
 
2. Cut a length of lace long enough to go around the hem of one pillow-
case plus 1 inch for seam allowances. Repeat for the second pillowcase.
 
3. Using a 1/2-inch seam allowance, sew the short ends of the pillowcase 
lace together using the even backstitch for the entire seam. Make one 
lace circle for each pillowcase.
 
4. Press the seams open and then turn the lace circles right side out.
 
5. Pin the lace onto each pillowcase, on the right side, so that the 
straight edge of the trim is just below the ready-made stitching on the 
pillowcase hem edge, as shown in Figure 3-22.
 
6. Stitch the lace to the pillowcase using the running stitch, sewing it on 
just below the ready-made stitching at the hem.
 
7. Cut the lace the length needed to span across the hem of the flat sheet 
plus 1 inch for seam allowance.
 
8. Turn back the two short ends of the lace 1/2 inch and press.

Trimming towels
Want to add a custom look to your bathroom? Trim your towels to match 
your shower curtain. This project is easy, looks great, and costs a fraction of 
the price you’d pay for a similar designer towel.
 
Because only one side of a towel shows when you hang it from a towel rack, 
you may as well save yourself some trouble and decorate just one side. The 
instructions in this section show you how to decorate one side of two towels, 
but you can also decorate both sides of one towel or double the materials 
and repeat the steps to have two super-fancy, fully decorated towels.

Crafts
To make this project, you need the following materials in addition to the usual 
sewing implements (see the earlier section “Common hand-sewing tools”):
 
 Two bath towels
 
 1/4 yard of fabric of a width that’s at least 2 inches more than twice the 
width of your towels (If you make a shower curtain, use the leftover 
fabric to trim towels to match.)
 
 21/2 yards of 5/8-inch-wide grosgrain ribbon (the kind with ribs).
 
 All-purpose thread to match the ribbon
Follow these steps to trim a towel at both ends:
 
1. Preshrink the towels, ribbon, and fabric (used for banding the towel) 
the way you plan to care for the towels.
 
 Preshrinking makes your towels last longer and wear better, and the 
decorative bands don’t shrink as much when you dry them on the per-
manent-press setting of your dryer.
 
2. Cutting on the crosswise grain (see “Getting to know your fabric” ear-
lier in this chapter), cut a fabric band 3 inches wide and twice as long 
as your towel is wide, plus 2 inches for seam allowances.
 
 For example, if your towel is 24 inches wide, your fabric band should be 
50 inches long.
 
3. Cut two lengths of the grosgrain ribbon the same length as the 
fabric band.
 
4. Pin one length of ribbon along the top edge, and one length of ribbon 
along the bottom edge of the fabric band, overlapping the fabric with 
the ribbon by 1/2 inch, as shown in Figure 3-23.
 
Figure 3-23:

5. Stitch both lengths of ribbon to the fabric band using the running 
stitch, sewing just inside and right next to the straight edge of the 
ribbon (refer to Figure 3-23).
 
6. Press the band smooth and flat.
 
7. Cut the long band in half so that you have two shorter strips the same 
length.
 
8. Center one fabric band over the woven decorative part of the towel 
and pin it in place.
 
9. Turn under the short ends of the fabric band 1/2 inch, making them 
even with the edges of the towel, and then press and pin them.
 
10. Stitch the fabric band in place using the even backstitch or the run-
ning stitch, sewing around all four edges of the band.
 
11. Repeat Steps 8 through 10 with the other fabric band, placing it on 
another towel or on the opposite end of the towel you’ve already 
decorated.
Now hang up your newly decorated towels, stand back, and admire your 
work. Pretty easy, huh?
Reversible table runner
Try your hand at sewing tassels by making this easy table runner. You can 
create this pretty runner to run either the width or the length of a table — 
use it in place of placemats or a tablecloth.
To make the runner, you need the following supplies in addition to the usual 
sewing implements (see the earlier section “Common hand-sewing tools”):
 
 1/2 yard of 60-inch-wide home decor fabric
 
 1/2 yard of 60-inch-wide complementary home decor fabric
 
 Thread that matches the fabric
 
 Two decorator tassels (optional)
 
 One yardstick
Follow these steps to make your runner:
 
1. Take one piece of the 18-x-60-inch fabric and, using your dressmaker’s 
chalk, mark the midpoint of the short ends.

3. Cut your table runner along each of the fold lines on both ends of the 
fabric.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for the other piece of fabric to create the 
reversible side of the runner.
 
5. If you want to use tassels, pin them to the right side of the tapestry 
fabric so that the loop is in the seam allowance and the top of the 
tassel is as close to the seam line as possible.
 
6. Pin the contrasting fabric to the tapestry fabric, right sides together 
(see Figure 3-25).

8. Trim excess fabric and tassel cord from around the points of the 
runner. Don’t trim closer than 1/8 inch.
 
9. Press the seam flat and together.
 
 At the opening, press the seam back toward the center of the runner on 
both edges (as if it were turned right side out). This technique makes 
the opening almost invisible and easier to close by hand.
 
10. From the wrong side, press the seam allowance open over a seam roll or 
seam stick (if you have one), pressing as close to the points as possible.
 
 If you don’t have a seam roll, press the seam open as well as possible by 
using your iron and ironing board.
 
11. Turn the runner right side out and press the edges.
 
12. Close the opening using the even slipstitch.

Patchwork and Quilting Basics
In This Chapter
 Getting familiar with basic patchwork and quilting terms
 Gathering the necessary supplies
 Reviewing basic patchwork and quilting techniques
 Making simple projects
Joining pieces of fabric together to form a larger unit of fabric is the 
basic technique of patchwork. Most patchwork projects involve stitching 
together square, triangular, or rectangular pieces of fabric. In this chapter, 
you gain exposure to the wide world of fabrics, and you gather quick and 
easy techniques for making patchwork projects to enhance your home with 
warmth and personality — and to give as treasured gifts.
Quilting refers to sewing lines or patterns through layers of cloth, sometimes 
with padding between them. Put the two together, and you have more than 
patchwork quilts; you have a singularly unique craft that more than almost 
any other harkens back to simpler days.
Making the patchwork potholder, patchwork pillow, and patchwork quilt 
from the patterns and steps in this chapter gives you the experience you 
need to make many patchwork projects, including many kinds of quilts. The 
same principles for creating a potholder apply to creating a quilt — the only 
difference between the two is size.
Patchwork and Quilting Lingo
Knowing what’s involved before you begin patchwork helps you decide 
which projects you want to make. With that in mind, get ready to familiarize 
yourself with several key terms. (Note: Some of the following terms relate 
only to quilting, a project that most fabric crafters make after they master the 
basics of patchwork.)

186
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
 Backing: The piece of fabric used on the underside of the patchwork 
(front) piece of fabric.
 
 Basting: Long, loose stitches used to hold the top, batting, and backing 
of a quilt together before quilting. You remove these stitches after you 
quilt each section.
 
 Batting: Soft lining used between two layers of fabric that you quilt. 
Batting makes quilts puffy and gives them warmth. You can also use bat-
ting for potholder padding.
 
 Most quilts are made with a thin layer of cotton or synthetic batting, but 
you can purchase batting in varying degrees of thickness, each appro-
priate for different kinds of projects. Batting also comes in small, fluffy 
pieces that you can use for stuffing projects, such as sachets, pin cush-
ions, pillows, and ornaments.
 
 Binding: A method of finishing the raw edges of fabric. You can use 
strips of contrasting fabric or packaged bias binding.
 
 Instead of using separate binding, many quilters cut the project’s back-
ing slightly larger than the top piece so they can bring the extra fabric 
forward to finish the edges of the top piece of fabric. Alternately, you 
can cut the backing the same size as the front and turn the front (patch-
work top) to the back.
 
 Blocks: Small pieces of fabric sewn together in a specified design to 
create a square or rectangular block. Use an individual block to make a 
patchwork pillow, or sew several blocks together to create a quilt top.
 
 Borders: Fabric strips that frame a pieced design. A border is usually 
narrow or wide and can be made from one of your patchwork fabrics or 
from a contrasting fabric. Use borders to frame quilt blocks or to enlarge 
a quilt top so that it extends over the sides of a mattress. You can also 
use more than one border around a patchwork project.
 
 Piecing: The act of joining fabric patchwork pieces together in a design 
or pattern to form a block.
 
 Quilting patterns: Lines or markings on fabric that make up a design 
for quilting. A quilting pattern can be straight, curved, elaborately curli-
cued, gridlike, or diamond-shaped. You can also follow the seam lines 
where pieces of fabric are joined with small quilting stitches. When quilt-
ing, you make small hand or machine stitches along these lines.
 
 Sashes or strips: Narrow pieces of fabric used to frame individual blocks 
and join them together. Sashes or strips often appear in contrasting 
colors.

187
 Chapter 4: Patchwork and Quilting Basics 
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
 
 Seam allowance: The specified measurement of fabric found between 
the stitch or seam line and the fabric edge. When directions state that 
you must sew two pieces of fabric together, begin stitching 1/4 inch in 
from the fabric’s raw edge, unless otherwise indicated.
 
 Setting: The act of sewing together quilt blocks to form a finished quilt top.
 
 Top: The front layer of a quilting project that shows the right side of the 
fabric. Patchwork or appliquéd pieces create the project’s top fabric.
Fabric (And Other Stuff) You Need
If you’re interested in doing patchwork, the material you’re probably most 
interested in (and inspired — or intimidated — by) is the fabric. Fabric is the 
main concern of any patchwork project; what kind, how much to buy, and 
what colors or prints work together.
 
 Fabric type: Most fabric crafters prefer 100-percent cotton fabric. 
Whatever your preference, make sure all the fabric used in your patch-
work project is of the same weight.
 
 Fabric quantity: You can never have too many different fabric patterns 
to choose from when you design a patchwork project. Chances are you’ll 
often need ten times more variety to choose from than what you origi-
nally think you will.
 
 Fabric colors and prints: Gathering a varied selection of both light and 
dark prints for your patchwork projects is always a good idea, because 
the colors and patterns of your chosen fabric greatly affect a project’s 
design.
 
 Calico, a printed cotton fabric with a small, all-over pattern, often floral, 
works well with patchwork projects because you can use the small 
prints effectively together, and it comes in a wide variety of colors to 
choose from. Pretty floral prints work well with alternating solid colors 
that match the calico print colors.
You also need to decide on your backing material. You can use a sheet, 
muslin, or one of the fabrics that you used for the patchwork on the top of 
your project. (Unlike fabric that you buy in a store, which is generally only 
45 inches wide, a bed sheet can cover the back of any size quilt without piec-
ing.) Most crafters prefer 100-percent-cotton backing. Regardless of your 
preference, a light backing color is usually better than a dark backing color 
because the latter may show through projects with thin batting and light 
fabric.

188
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
In addition to fabric, you also need the following items to make patchwork 
projects:
 
 Cutting board: Use this handy tool for quick measuring and cutting 
when making patchworks. You can obtain cutting boards from fabric 
stores or mail-order sources.
 
 Iron: Working on any patchwork project without having an iron on a 
padded stool or chair next to the sewing machine isn’t practical. Why? 
Because after each stitching step, you need to press the fabric and 
seams using the steam setting.
 
 Marking pen: If you need to trace a pattern or design from a book and 
transfer it to your fabric, use a marking pen. You can find water-soluble 
marking pens, made specifically for marking quilting lines on fabric, in 
fabric shops. After you finish quilting, you can remove the pen marks 
by spraying them with a plant mister or by patting over the lines with a 
damp sponge.
 
 Needles: Crafters sew most patchwork piecing with a sewing machine 
but do most of the quilting by hand. To hand quilt, you need #7 and #8 
sharp needles (often called betweens).
 
 Rotary cutter: This tool, which resembles a pizza cutter, allows you to 
cut several layers of fabric at once, more accurately than you could with 
scissors.
 
 Ruler and yardstick: You can’t work without these two tools. Use a 
metal ruler as a straightedge to accurately cut fabric. Use a yardstick to 
cut lengths of fabric on which you must mark and cut at least 36 inches 
at one time.
 
 Shears and scissors: You need a good pair of shears to cut your fabric. 
Shears have one straight and one bent-angle blade to make accurate 
cutting easier. Also, invest in a pair of small, pointed scissors (known 
as snipping scissors) to snip threads as you stitch and quilt. (See Book II, 
Chapter 3 for tips on keeping your shears and scissors sharp.)
 
 Straight pins: Use special quilting pins — extra-long 13/4-inch sharp 
pins — if you can. Regular straight pins are fine, but the extra-long 
steel pins made especially for quilting work best for holding three 
layers of material together.
 
 Template: A template is a rigid, full-size pattern that you use to trace 
design elements. You can cut templates out of cardboard, manila paper, 
plastic, acetate, or sandpaper. When your project requires a repeat 
design, use acetate because it’s transparent and produces clean, crisp 
edges. Sandpaper’s main advantage is that it doesn’t slip when you place 
it facedown on fabric. If you cut one paper design, pin the pattern to the 
fabric to use as a cutting guide for more efficiency.

189

Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
 
 Thimble: If you quilt by hand, use a thimble. Without one, you run the 
risk of bleeding on your fabric if you poke yourself with your needle.
 
 Thread: Cotton-blend thread works best for all piecing and quilting 
projects.
Basic Know-How for Patchwork 
and Quilting
Although quilting projects vary in their specific instructions, you generally 
do things in the following order:
 
1. Gauge how much fabric you need and select the fabrics you want to use.
 
2. Cut your fabrics.
 
3. Piece the patchwork together, following the pattern, and then attach 
any fabrics to frame the quilt.
 
4. Piece your backing together.
 
5. Layer your patchwork top, batting, and backing together, and then 
baste the layers together.
 
6. Trace your quilt pattern, and then quilt the project.
 
7. Finish the outer edges by adding binding.
Sounds simple enough, but how do you calculate the amount of fabric to buy 
for your project? If the back of a patchwork pillow isn’t patchwork, what is 
it? How do you enlarge or reduce a pattern that isn’t the right size for your 
project? How do you make a template? Check out the following sections for 
an easy-to-understand breakdown of these technical basics.
Estimating fabric yardage
If you follow project directions, the amount of each kind of fabric that you 
need is listed. However, when you make projects without directions, such 
as quilts, determining the amount of fabric that you need can be tricky. To 
estimate yardage for a bed quilt, for example, follow these steps:
 
1. Measure your bed when it’s fully made, noting the length, width, and 
depth of your bed, including the box spring.
 
 A fully made bed means with the bed pad, sheets, and blankets over the 
mattress.

190
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
2. Decide how low you want the quilt to hang.
 
 That is, decide whether you want your quilt to overhang slightly, over-
hang to the top of the dust ruffle, or drop to the floor, and whether you 
want your quilt to extend up and over the pillows.
 
3. Add the number of inches determined in Step 2 to the measurements 
you took in Step 1 to make the quilt large enough to hang where you 
want it to.
 
Have a quilt pattern that you like but the quilt size doesn’t fit your bed? You 
can add or subtract from the border measurements to make it fit. Changing 
the pattern’s measurements usually doesn’t change the quilt’s basic design.
Making and assembling 
your patchwork pieces
Patchwork quilts are constructed of blocks of fabrics sewn together. The 
blocks themselves are pieced together with patches, and the overall look of 
the quilt is determined by how many — four, five, nine, and so on — are used 
to create each block and how the patches are put together. Although you can 
get as creative as you want with piecing together the patches and the blocks, 
there are many popular patterns to choose from: log cabin, flying geese, 
piano keys, and so on. How the specific piecing is done depends on the pat-
tern you choose.
There’s nothing illicit about strip piecing
Strip piecing consists of sewing strips of different fabrics together and then 
cutting them into units that you arrange to create a patchwork top. The 
strip-piecing method works well when you make a quilt with a pattern that 
requires many fabric pieces. Instead of repeatedly cutting and sewing indi-
vidual squares together, you can sew two or more strips of fabric together 
and then cut those strips into equal pieces called units by using the strip-
piecing method. You can then arrange the equal pieces (units) and stitch 
them together in different positions (as in the project directions) to form 
your patchwork pattern.
Follow these instructions (and keep an eye on Figure 4-1) to get in on the 
strip-piecing act:
Row 1: With right sides facing together and long edges aligned, sew equal-
width strips of fabric together and mark off units (with a light pencil and 
ruler) equal to the width of the strips.
Row 2: Cut out each unit along the marked lines.

191
 Chapter 4: Patchwork and Quilting Basics 
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
Row 3: Sew another group of strips (with three different fabrics) together in 
the same manner as Row 1 and cut out the units as in Row 2.
Row 4: By joining a unit from Row 2 to each side edge of a unit from Row 3, 
you can create a multicolored quilt block quickly and easily.

Now you’re joining triangles to create squares
Follow these steps (illustrated in Figure 4-2) for a quick and easy way to join 
light and dark triangles to create squares of any size.
 
1. Determine the size of the patchwork squares that you want.
 
2. Add 1 inch to your determined patchwork-square size and then mark 
that size off on the wrong side of the light fabric.
 
 For example, if you want to create 2-inch squares, mark off 3-inch 
squares.
 
3. Draw diagonal lines through each square, as shown in Figure 4-2a.
 
4. With the light and dark fabrics’ right sides facing and raw edges 
aligned, pin the marked light fabric to the dark fabric of the same size.
 
5. Stitch 1/4 inch away from the diagonal lines, on each side of the lines, 
as shown in Figure 4-2b.

6. Cut all the solid lines of the squares to make individual squares of 
light and dark triangles.
 
7. Open the seams of the squares you cut out and press.
 
8. Repeat these steps 11 more times.
 
 You now have 24 squares, each made up of a dark and a light triangle 
patch, as shown in Figure 4-2c.

So you want to sew small squares together
When you need to make patchwork pieces from small squares of fabric 
(approximately 1 to 11/2 inches), use the easy method shown in Figure 4-3 to 
stitch them together.
 
1. With their right sides facing, pin together individual sets of two small 
fabric squares each.
 
2. With your sewing machine, stitch along one side of the pinned fabric 
edges of one set, but don’t cut the thread when you finish stitching.
 
3. Run the sewing machine for two or three more stitches and then feed 
the next set of squares through.
 
4. Continue to stitch all the square sets with this method so that you end 
up with a string of patches connected by threads.
 
5. After you make enough pieces of patchwork for your project, cut the 
threads between the squares and separate them.
 
6. Open each set of squares and press with your iron.
 
Figure 4-3: 
Sew small 
squares in 
multiples to 
save time.
 
Piecing the backing
If you make a quilt, tablecloth, wall hanging, or other large patchwork proj-
ect, you may have to piece panels together to make the correct backing size. 
Use the following steps to piece your project’s backing:
 
1. Cut two pieces of fabric to the appropriate length for your project.
 
 Most fabric is 45 inches wide, so you now have two 45-inch-wide lengths 
of fabric.

194
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
2. Cut one of the pieces of fabric in half lengthwise to produce two 
narrow strips of the same size.
 
3. Stitch one of these two matching panels to each long-sided edge of the 
second piece of fabric.
 
 Now you have a piece of fabric wide enough for your backing that 
doesn’t have a seam down the middle. Two seams make the back of a 
quilt look neater than a seam down the middle of the back of the quilt; a 
tablecloth lays flatter on a tabletop with two seams than with one down 
the middle. Also, working with three smaller pieces of fabric is more 
manageable than working with two larger pieces of fabric.
 
4. Press the seams open.
 
If you use a bed sheet the same size as the patchwork top, good news! You 
have a solid backing that doesn’t require piecing.
Transferring designs
You can find many interesting designs in quilting magazines, in-store book-
lets, quilting books, and so on. Once you find a design you like, you need to 
transfer it to your fabric. Keep these things in mind:
 
 If the design is already the right size, great. Otherwise, use a copy 
machine to make it larger or smaller for your purposes.
 
 You can combine designs — putting a smaller design within a larger one, 
for example. When you do, transfer the larger design first; then fill in 
with the smaller one. (Here’s a little tip: If the small design doesn’t quite 
fit into the space, you can easily leave off part of it or adapt it to fit.)
To transfer a design to your fabric, follow these steps:
 
1. Trace the pattern pieces or a quilting design onto tracing paper.
 
2. Pin together a piece of dressmaker’s (carbon) paper, the tracing paper 
with the pattern, and the fabric.
 
 Place the dressmaker’s paper on the right side of the fabric with the 
carbon side down. Lay the tracing paper on top and pin the tracing, the 
carbon, and the fabric together.
 
3. Trace all the pattern lines.
 
 Use an erasable fabric marker, erasable pen, or a fine-line disappearing 
marking pen to transfer the design to the fabric.
 
4. Remove the dressmaker’s paper and tracing paper.
 
 The transfer lines appear on the fabric so you can use these lines as a 
guide for cutting out the pattern from the fabric.

Making a template
Templates enable you to trace design elements onto your fabric. You can 
buy ready-made quilt templates or just make your own. If you use cardboard, 
manila paper, or acetate as template material, you need to first trace your 
design so you can transfer the pattern to the template.
Use these steps to make a cardboard or manila paper template:
 
1. Trace the design onto carbon paper.
 
2. Place the tracing facedown on the template material and use a pen or 
pencil to rub over each traced line.
 
 The outline transfers to the cardboard.
 
3. Remove the tracing paper and go over the lines again with a ballpoint 
pen to make them more legible, if needed.
 
4. Cut the design outline from the cardboard.
 
 Retractable craft knives work well for cutting templates.
If you prefer to use acetate rather than cardboard or manila paper, trace the 
design onto tracing paper (as in Step 1), but then place the acetate over the 
tracing and cut out the design shape.
 
Using acetate for template material has several advantages. You can use it 
many times without it losing its sharp edges, and because it’s clear, you can 
trace a pattern directly onto it. Further, you can see through acetate, which 
allows you to position it exactly where you want it when you place it on the 
fabric. For example, if you’re using a floral print, you may want to center a 
flower in the middle of the template.
Quilting your patchwork: 
Hand quilting 101
Quilting consists of sewing layers of fabric and batting together to produce 
a padded structure held together by straight, even, small stitches. Generally 
the final step in a patchwork project, the quilting process makes the project 
interesting and gives it a textured look.
 
When you need to fill large areas of a background (such as a border or large 
plain blocks between patchwork blocks) with quilting, choose a simple 
design. Background quilting should never interfere with patchwork or appli-
qué elements.

196
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Follow these steps to hand quilt:
 
1. Using a workable length of thread, thread your needle and knot one end.
 
 Cut a piece of thread approximately 18 to 20 inches long. Thread the 
needle so that roughly 8 inches of thread goes through it. Make a small 
knot in the long end of the thread, leaving a 1-inch tail below the knot. 
Make the knot in only one end of the thread so that you quilt with a 
single strand of thread.
 
2. Bring the needle up through the back of the patchwork to the top 
front (where you start the first line of quilting), give the knotted end a 
good tug, and pull it through the backing fabric into the batting.
 
 You make all subsequent quilting stitches through all three layers of 
fabric. Each time you rethread the needle though, be sure to pull the 
first stitch into the batting to avoid knots on the underside of your 
quilted project.
 
3. Make small running stitches (refer to Book II, Chapter 3), following 
your premarked quilting pattern.
 
 Alternatively, make a line of stitches 1/4 inch on each side of all the 
patchwork seam lines.
 
 Make sure you don’t stitch into the 1/4-inch seam allowance that resides 
around the outside edge of the patchwork top.
 
4. When you come to the last 3 inches of thread, take one last stitch 
into the patchwork fabric, but not out through the backing. Instead, 
push the needle up again an inch from where you put it in; then pull 
it through the patchwork top and away from the remaining thread. 
Snip the end of the thread (if a tiny end shows) close to the top of the 
fabric.
 
 The thread is now secure inside the batting.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4.
 
How do you keep your pattern lines straight? That’s easy! Just make grids 
that you can follow as you sew along. For a simple way to make quilting grid 
patterns of squares or diamond shapes, use a yardstick or masking tape.
To make a square grid, follow these instructions:
 
1. Place a yardstick across the top edge of your fabric and use a marking 
pen to mark the material along the edge of the yardstick.
 
 Don’t worry about using the marking pen; it washes out of fabric easily.

197
 Chapter 4: Patchwork and Quilting Basics 
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
 
2. Without lifting the edge of the yardstick from the fabric, turn it over 
sideways and, once again, mark along its edge.
 
3. Continue across the fabric to the bottom edge.
 
 This method creates perfect, 1-inch spaces between each yardstick line.
 
4. Lay the yardstick along one side edge of the fabric and repeat the line-
marking process to create a 1-inch grid across the fabric.
 
5. Quilt stitch along the marked lines.
 
You can use various sizes of masking tape rather than a yardstick to increase 
or decrease line spacing.
Follow these steps to make a diamond grid:
 
1. Place the yardstick diagonally across one corner of the patchwork 
fabric and mark the material with a marking pen.
 
2. Without lifting the yardstick from the material, turn the yardstick over 
and mark the new line. Continue to turn the yardstick over and mark 
each line until you reach the opposite corner.
 
3. Repeat this process in the opposite direction.
Country Potholders
Potholders make excellent patchwork projects for beginners because they 
teach you the basic fundamentals of patchwork and quilting and because 
making a potholder produces a useful kitchen tool. You can stitch these 
small patchwork projects by hand or with a sewing machine.
Tools and materials
1/4 yard of green plaid homespun fabric
1/4 yard of dark solid coral homespun fabric
1/4 yard of light coral plaid homespun fabric
l6-x-l6-inch piece of quilt batting for each potholder
Note: All measurements for each project include 1/4-inch seam allowances.

Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Crafting the potholders
The potholders in this project consist of pink and green plaid homespun 
fabric. Homespun fabric is heavy woven cotton that looks and feels like linen. 
You can find this fabric in any fabric store. Homespun comes in many colors, 
so you can make these projects in colors that match your kitchen. Whatever 
colors you choose, you can piece together each of these 8-x-8-inch pothold-
ers in a different patchwork pattern. You can make one pattern or all four 
patterns (see Figure 4-4).

Head to the following “Finishing the potholders” section for guidance on com-
pleting your potholder.
Finishing the potholders
To finish your potholder, follow these steps:
 
1. Cut a ll/2-x-6-inch strip from any piece of remaining fabric to make a 
hanging loop for your potholder.
 
2. With wrong sides facing, fold the strip in half lengthwise and press 
with the iron. Turn the raw edges in l/4 inch, press with your iron, and 
stitch along the long edge of the fabric.
 
3. Fold the strip into a loop and overlap the raw ends. Pin the raw ends 
of the loop to one corner of the top of the potholder.
 
 The loop should be lying on the front of the patchwork top.
 
4. Cut the batting in half so you have two 8-inch square pieces.
 
5. Cut an 8 l/2-x-8 l/2-inch backing piece from either the green or the coral 
fabric.
 
6. Pin one piece of batting to the back of the potholder top and quilt 
along all the seam lines of the potholder’s design.
 
7. Pin the second piece of batting to the wrong side of the backing fabric.
 
8. With the fabric’s right sides facing and all the edges aligned, stitch 
around three sides and four corners of the potholder, leaving about a 
3-inch opening on one side for turning.
 
 Make sure the hanging loop is between the two fabric sides and that you 
catch the raw ends of the loop as you stitch.

9. Turn the potholder right-side out and push the corners out with a 
pencil eraser or a crochet needle. Press the potholder with your iron.
 
10. Turn the potholder’s raw edges to the inside and stitch the opening 
closed.
Patchwork Pillow
Making an oversized pillow requires patchwork and quilting techniques. The 
generous 24-inch-square size of this pillow project makes it ideal for your 
sofa, bed, or for lounging on the floor. The pillow’s patchwork border frames 
a center panel of fabric that you quilt in a pattern of circles.
 
When you stitch any two pieces of fabric together, always begin stitching at 
the seam allowance — 1/4 inch in from the fabric’s edge.
Tools and materials
1/2 yard of 45-inch-wide blue calico (or color of your choice)
3/4 yard of 45-inch-wide muslin
Needle and white thread
24-inch-square piece of quilt batting
Compass
24-inch-square pillow form (sold in fabric shops) or stuffing, such as 
Poly-Fil
Crafting the pillow
The steps for this project are divided into distinct tasks to help you keep 
track of your progress: creating the patchwork top, marking and quilting your 
top, and assembling your pillow.
Creating the patchwork top
 
1. Cut the following shapes from the printed blue fabric:
 
• 1 square, 121/2 x 121/2 inches
 
• 20 squares, 21/2 x 21/2 inches each
 
• 4 strips, 21/2 x 121/2 inches each

202
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
2. Cut the following pieces of muslin:
 
• 8 strips, 21/2 x 12 inches each
 
• 16 squares, 21/2 x 21/2 inches each
 
3. Cut 1 backing piece of fabric (either muslin or printed), 241/2-inches 
square.
 
4. With the fabrics’ right sides together and raw edges aligned, pin one 
21/2-inch muslin square to one 21/2-inch blue calico square.
 
5. Stitch along one side edge of the fabric. Open the seams and press 
with your iron from the wrong side.
 
6. Join the two squares you’ve already stitched with another blue calico 
square on the opposite side of the muslin square in the same way as in 
Step 5. Open the seams and press with your iron.
 
 Stitching these three squares of fabric together creates a row of two 
printed blue square patches with a muslin square in between (see Row 1 
in Figure 4-5).
 
Figure 4-5: 
Joining 
squares to 
make rows.
 
Row 1
Row 2
Row 3
 
7. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 to make a row of one muslin square, one 
printed blue square, and a muslin square (see Row 2 in Figure 4-5).
 
8. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 to make a row of one printed blue square, one 
muslin square, and one printed blue square (see Row 3 in Figure 4-5).
 
9. Repeat Steps 4 through 8 until you have 12 rows of fabric — 8 rows 
like Row 1 and 4 rows like Row 2.
 
10. With the fabrics’ right sides together and raw edges aligned, pin Rows 
1 and 2 together and stitch across the long edge on top. Open the 
seams and press the fabric’s wrong side with your iron.
 
11. With the right sides together and the bottom raw edge of Row 2 
aligned with the long edge of Row 3, pin Rows 2 and 3 together. Stitch 
along the long edges of the fabric to join Rows 2 and 3. Open the 
seams and press with your iron.
 
 Congratulations! You’ve just created a patchwork block. (See Figure 4-6.)

12. Repeat Steps 10 and 11 to make three more patchwork blocks. The 
patchwork blocks make up each corner piece of the pillow.
 
13. With the fabrics’ right sides facing and raw edges aligned, pin one of 
the 12-inch-long muslin strips to one of the 12-inch-long blue strips 
and then stitch along one long edge of the fabric. Open the seams and 
press with your iron.
 
14. Pin another 12-inch-long muslin strip to the long edge of the blue strip 
(right sides facing) and stitch together. Open the seams and press with 
your iron.
 
15. Repeat Steps 13 and 14 to make three more borders.
 
16. With the fabrics’ right sides facing, pin one border to one edge of the 
printed blue 121/2-inch center fabric square and then stitch the edges 
together (see Figure 4-7). Open the seams on the fabric’s wrong side 
and press with your iron.
 
17. Repeat Step 16 on the opposite edge of the center square.
 
18. With the fabrics’ right sides facing and raw edges aligned, pin and 
then stitch one patchwork block to each short edge of the two remain-
ing borders (see Figure 4-8). Open the seams and press with your iron.

Marking the pattern and quilting the top
When your patchwork top is complete, it’s time to mark and stitch your quilt 
pattern. Follow these steps and refer to Figure 4-10 to see what the finished 
product should look like:
 
1. Place the pillow top on a hard surface. Use a compass and a light 
pencil to draw overlapping, 5-inch circles in the center square on the 
right side of the fabric (see Figure 4-10).
 
2. Use a ruler to make diagonal lines across the borders with 1/2-inch 
spaces between the lines.
 
3. With the front of the fabric facing up, pin the pillow top to a piece of 
quilt batting and a piece of muslin.
 
4. Sew running stitches (see Book II, Chapter 3) along the lines you drew 
in Steps 19 and 20 to quilt the pillow.

Assembling the pillow
With your pillow top quilted, you’re ready to put everything together:
 
1. With right sides together, pin the quilted pillow top and backing 
together.
 
2. Stitch around three sides and four corners of the pillow, leaving a 
1/4-inch seam allowance.
 
3. Turn the fabric right-side out and press with your iron. Turn in the 
open edges 1/4 inch and press with your iron.
 
4. Insert the pillow form, or stuff with the stuffing until the pillow is full 
to your satisfaction.
 
5. Slip stitch the opening closed, as shown in Figure 4-11.

Stuffed Patchwork Cat
You can use this stuffed patchwork cat, shown in Figure 4-12, as a pillow, a 
child’s toy, or a doorstop. (To use it as a doorstop, fill the finished cat with 
sand or weigh down the bottom with a brick.) You make this 13-inch-high cat 
from 1-inch squares of light and dark and solid and printed fabrics that you 
stitch together. The patchwork cat’s backing fabric is a solid piece of fabric 
that you cut from one of the fabrics you use on the front of the cat. You quilt 
the grid pattern of this cat by hand.
 
You can make this project to use up scraps from other projects.
Tools and materials
52 11/2-x-11/2-inch squares, made of assorted calico scraps
52 muslin squares, each 11/2-x-11/2 inches
Calico fabric, 8 x 131/2 inches (for the project’s backing)

Crafting the cat
 
1. With the fabrics’ right sides facing and raw edges aligned, stitch a 
calico square to a muslin square along one edge. Open the seams and 
press with your iron.
 
2. Continue to join squares in this way, alternating a calico square with 
a muslin square, until you have 13 rows with 8 squares each. Press all 
the seams to the same side.

208
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
3. With the fabrics’ right sides facing and raw edges aligned, join all 
the rows so that the light and dark squares lie above and below each 
other.
 
 This step creates a patchwork piece of fabric that’s approximately 81/2 x 
l31/2 inches.
 
4. Enlarge the cat pattern shown in Figure 4-13 by 210 percent (to 
131/2 inches high) and transfer the enlargement to tracing paper. 
Make a separate enlargement of the cat’s tail.
 
 To enlarge your design, use a copy machine. See the earlier section 
“Transferring designs” for more info on transferring patterns.
 
5. Pin the enlarged pattern to the right side of the patchwork fabric and 
cut out the pattern of the cat only.
 
6. Pin the pattern of the tail to the remaining piece of patchwork fabric 
and then cut it out.
 
7. Cut the cat and tail pattern pieces from the 8-x-131/2-inch calico back-
ing fabric.
 
8. With the right sides facing and raw edges aligned, stitch the tail pieces 
together, but leave the straight edge open so you can fill it with stuffing.
 
9. Turn the tail fabric right-side out and use a pencil eraser or crochet 
hook to stuff the tail tightly with stuffing.
 
10. Pin the raw edges of the tail in position on the wrong side of the 
patchwork cat’s front.
 
11. With the fabric’s right sides facing and raw edges aligned, pin the 
backing to the front of the cat, with the tail between the two pieces of 
fabric. Stitch all around, leaving the bottom end open.
 
12. Use snipping scissors to make small, evenly spaced snips into the 
excess fabric of the seam allowance (but not into your stitches) 
around all the cat’s curves, including all the corners.
 
13. Turn the cat right-side out. Press with your iron.
 
14. Stuff the cat tightly with stuffing. Turn the raw edges of the fabric’s 
opening to the inside and slip stitch the opening closed (refer to 
Figure 4-11).

Pinwheel Baby Quilt
Quilts make great gifts for newborn babies and are easy to take care of. The 
more you wash a quilt, the softer it gets and the better it looks. The 24-x-32-inch 
baby quilt (shown in Figure 4-14) is the perfect size for a bassinet, carriage, or 
stroller and is an easy sewing-machine project. Finish the edge of the quilt with 
eyelet trim, satin binding, or bias binding, which are available by the yard in 
fabric shops.

two eyelet fabrics.
 
2. With the right sides of the eyelet facing the front of the quilt, pin the 
raw edges of the eyelet all around the quilt top. Overlap the eyelet 
ends where they meet.
 
3. Stitch the eyelet all around the quilt top, 1/4 inch from the edge of the 
patchwork top.
Assembling and quilting the pieces
 
1. With right sides facing, pin the backing fabric and the quilt top 
together.
 
2. Center the pinned fabric over the quilt batting and re-pin all three 
layers together.
 
3. Use fabric shears to trim the excess batting to the quilt’s size.
 
4. Stitch around three sides and four corners of the quilt, leaving one 
edge of the quilt open. Turn the quilt right-side out.
 
5. Turn the raw edges of the fabric’s opening to the inside 1/4 inch and 
press the quilt with your iron.
 
6. Slip stitch the quilt’s open edge closed.
 
7. Using approximately 6 inches of embroidery floss for each bow, tie 
the center of each block.
 
 Cut a 12-inch piece of embroidery floss and thread your needle with it. 
(Don’t make a knot at the end of the floss.) Insert the needle through the 
top of the quilt in the center of the first block (the intersection of the 
four triangles), without pulling the thread all the way through, and then 
bring the needle back up through the quilt in the same spot so that both 
ends of floss are on the front side of the quilt. Pull the needle off the 
thread. Make a knot and then a bow, and cut the ends of the floss. (You 
need approximately 6 inches of floss for each bow.)

reating candles can be a relaxing and rewarding hobby. Because today’s 
supplies and materials make fashioning attractive candles easy, you 
don’t need to purchase them. And because candle-making isn’t an expensive 
hobby, you can decorate your home with candles and even give them as gifts.
Nothing quite compares to the feelings of pride and pleasure that come from 
looking at a beautiful, burning candle and knowing that you created it with 
your own two hands. Like any hobby, candle-making requires a few supplies, 
a little know-how, and a bit of practice — all of which you can find here.
 
This chapter explains how to make candles using paraffin and beeswax. 
Important differences exist if you use other waxes, such as gel wax and 
vegetable-based waxes. Before you make candles with these substances, 
make sure you understand their requirements and know how to do so 
safely. To find out more about how to use these waxes, or to take your 
candle-making skills to new heights, check out Making Candles and Soaps 
For Dummies by Kelly Ewing (Wiley).
Equipment and Supplies
To get started on the right foot with candle-making, you need some standard 
equipment and a few basic supplies. Fortunately, many of the items you need 
(with the exception of wax and wicks) are items you likely already own. What 
you don’t have, you can probably find at reasonable prices.

216
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Basic equipment
Making candles doesn’t have to be expensive. You can use many items that 
you already have at home, or you can buy them cheaply at garage sales. If 
you do need to buy necessary equipment at a store, you can almost always 
find coupons for it in your Sunday newspaper. If you don’t have what you 
need on hand and don’t want to drive to stores, you can also order what you 
need via the Internet.
So now that you know how to get your supplies, you need to be familiar with 
them and what they do when it comes to candle-making. The following list 
walks you through the basic equipment required to make candles:
 
 Heat source: What you’re basically doing in candle-making is melting 
solid wax over a heat source. Your stove, of course, is perfect for this 
function, but some people like to use a small camping stove. Regardless, 
it doesn’t matter whether your stove is gas or electric. What you don’t 
want to use is a microwave oven: The temperature is too hard to con-
trol, and you can easily overheat the wax.
 
 A double-boiler-type pot for melting your wax: A double boiler, shown 
in Figure 5-1, is basically a large pot with a smaller pot inside. If you 
don’t own a double boiler, you can use a small pot placed inside a larger 
pot to get the same effect. Use a trivet or small tin cans to prop the small 
pot up so that it doesn’t rest on the bottom of the larger pot and make 
sure the top of the smaller pot is at least 1/2 inch above the rim of the 
larger pot. (No matter what kind of melting vessel you choose, remem-
ber that you’re going to pour the wax from the container directly into 
your mold. Consequently, a melting pot with a spout is helpful.)
 
 Wax heats up quickly and can explode if it gets too hot, which is why 
you almost always must use an indirect method of melting it. Do not melt 
your wax in a pot directly on your burner.
 
 Thermometer: You can either purchase a specialized wax thermom-
eter or use a candy or cooking thermometer, as long as it can register 
temperatures ranging from 100 degrees Fahrenheit to 300 degrees 
Fahrenheit. You can find thermometers that attach to the side of your 
melting pot by checking your local craft store, cooking store, or online 
candle-making resource.
 
 Mold(s): Your first candles will probably be made in a mold, a hollow 
object into which you pour your melted wax. As the wax cools, it hard-
ens and takes on the shape of the mold. The type of material your mold 
is made of doesn’t matter. In fact, you have many mold options, from 
store-bought ones, to molds you recycle from household items, to molds 
you make yourself.

Figure 5-1: 
You need 
a double 
boiler (or 
some varia-
tion thereof) 
to melt 
your wax.
 
 
 A thermometer is one of the absolute most important pieces of candle-
making equipment. Don’t even try to make candles without one because 
it’s too dangerous! Wax gets hot quickly, and unlike items you cook, you 
can’t eyeball it and know by sight that you’ve overdone it. The only way to 
properly guarantee the temperature of your wax is with a thermometer.
 
 Dipping can: If you’re going to be dipping taper candles (see the section 
“The basic taper candle” for the technique), then you want some type 
of metal container that’s wide enough and tall enough to dip your wicks 
into (like the one shown in Figure 5-2). Of course, you can purchase 
these cans, but you can also use something from home. If you’re lucky 
and your melting pot is at least 12 inches wide, save some cash and 
searching and just use it to dip your candles in.
 
 Ladle or large metal spoon: As the wax melts, you need to stir it occa-
sionally. A ladle or large metal spoon works well for this purpose. As 
long as you don’t leave the spoon in the wax mixture, you can even get 
by with a long-handled plastic spoon, which is easy to clean and doesn’t 
absorb wax or scent.
 
 Mold sealer and releasing agent: Mold sealer (also called wick sealer) 
is a special putty that you use to close up the hole where you thread 
in your wick so that the wax doesn’t leak out. A releasing agent (also 
referred to as mold release), which you spray inside your mold, makes 
your finished candle less likely to stick to its mold.
 
 Vegetable oil works just as well as any releasing agent out there. Just 
apply a thin amount of oil to the inside of your mold and voilà!

218
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
 Wick tabs: Thin metal bases that attach to the bottom of untabbed 
wicks are called wick tabs. (Some wicks come with the tabs already 
attached.) You often use wick tabs for votives and container candles, 
because they help your wick stand up straight. If you use molds that 
don’t have a hole in the bottom for your wick, you can also use these 
tabs to help your wick stay at the bottom of your candle when you pour 
the wax.
 
 Objects that let you color, scent, and otherwise decorate your candles: 
Wax dye, which you use to color your wax, comes in a variety of forms, 
including powder, liquid, and solid chips. You can also add fragrance by 
using essential oils, synthetic scents specially formulated for candles, 
and herbs.
 
Figure 5-2: 
For dipping 
tapers, 
you need 
some type 
of a dipping 
can that’s 
at least 12 
inches wide.
 
Wax
Wax is the wick’s fuel. Without it, your candle won’t burn. When making 
candles, you can choose from several different types of waxes. As mentioned 
previously, this chapter focuses on paraffin and beeswax — the waxes that 
most candles are made out of and that are easiest to find.

Paraffin wax: The winner and still champion!
Paraffin, an inexpensive, petroleum-based wax, is the most popular wax for 
making candles. If you’re new to candle-making, paraffin wax makes a great 
starting point. Because of its colorless and odorless nature, it’s also a good 
choice if you want to add color and scent.
 
Paraffin wax comes in different melting points, ranging from 104 degrees 
Fahrenheit to 160 degrees Fahrenheit. The melting point you choose depends 
on the type of candle you want to make. When you’re buying paraffin, check 
the wax’s label for both its melting point and the type of candle it’s best used 
to create.
 
Don’t be tempted to do one-stop shopping and buy your paraffin wax at the 
grocery store. This wax isn’t the type for candle-making. Instead, it’s used for 
sealing food that you’ve jarred.
Beeswax: The benefits of honey, with no stings attached
Beeswax is an all-natural product that, when burned, gives off a pleasant 
honey aroma. In addition to its natural golden shade, beeswax is available 
in white and other colors. You can buy beeswax in honeycomb sheets, 
blocks, or beads. Beeswax’s low melting point (approximately 140 degrees 
Fahrenheit) and strength (if you drop it, it dents, but doesn’t shatter) make 
beeswax a great wax to use when you’re making container candles with chil-
dren. On the downside, beeswax can be a little bit pricier than paraffin.
Wicks
Although you can use almost any wick to make a candle, the best wick allows 
your candle to burn longer and cleaner. In general, wicks come in three main 
types:
 
 Flat-braided wicks vary in the number of plies used. In general, the 
more plies in the wick, the thicker it is, which makes it more suitable for 
larger candles. Flat-braided wicks are best for tapers.
 
 Square-braided wicks are (as you can imagine) square. Unlike flat-
braided wicks, the number of plies used isn’t indicated in the wick’s 
thickness, so knowing the right size to use is a little more difficult. The 
solution? Follow the manufacturer’s recommendation or eyeball the size. 
Square-braided wicks are best for beeswax candles, pillars, and other 
large candles.

220
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
 Cored wicks consist of plies braided around a metal, cotton, or paper 
core. The core helps the wick stand up straight when the candle is 
poured and while it burns. Cored wicks are usually attached to a wick 
tab, or flat metal piece at the bottom of a candle. Metal cored wicks can 
be used for any type of candle, but they’re especially good for container 
candles, votives, and tealights. Paper cored wicks are best for votives, 
tealights, and container candles.
 
Some cored wicks contain lead. Make sure that the candles you have burning 
in your home aren’t releasing this dangerous toxin. To test for lead, simply 
rub the tip of an unburned wick on a piece of plain white paper. If you see a 
light gray mark on the paper, the wick contains a lead core. Note: Lead cored 
wicks haven’t been available in the United States for many years; that’s not 
necessarily true of candles or wicks manufactured elsewhere. So carry a bit 
of paper in your purse or wallet when you go candle shopping so that you 
can perform the same quick lead test before you buy.
Additives
Wax additives change the crystalline structure of wax, which then affects 
attributes such as the candle’s appearance or burning time. If you’re having 
problems with your candles (particularly mottling, cracking, or burning 
issues), wax additives may be just what you need to fine-tune them. The most 
common additives are
 
 Stearin: Almost always added to paraffin candles, stearin lengthens a 
candle’s burning time, shrinks the wax so that you can remove it easily 
from molds, gives your candle a glossy finish, hardens your candle so 
that it’s less likely to bend or tilt, and more. To add stearin to wax, you 
simply add it to the wax while the wax is melting.
 
 Don’t use stearin when you’re pouring your wax into a flexible rubber 
mold (it rots the mold; use vybar instead) or when you’re making con-
tainer candles (you don’t want the wax to shrink; use microcrystalline 
instead).
 
 Vybar: A great replacement for stearin when you’re pouring your wax 
into flexible molds, vybar comes in two types. Simply choose the one 
that best matches your wax’s melting point. Vybar helps eliminate bub-
bles, increases the strength of your candles, gives you a smooth surface, 
and enables you to add more fragrance. As with stearin, you can simply 
melt it along with your candle wax.

221
 Chapter 5: Making Candles
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
 
 Microcrystalline: Used to help candles stay softer longer and prolong 
their burning time, microcrystalline is found in two basic types:
 
• Hard microcrystalline: This type lengthens a candle’s burning time, 
improves its finish, and makes it stronger. Hard microcrystalline 
has a high melting point, and you use it only in minute quantities — 
1 teaspoon of melted microcrystalline per 1 pound of wax. Be sure 
to melt the hard microcrystalline first and then add it directly to 
your wax.
 
• Soft microcrystalline: This type has a low melting point and is 
what you use when you make container candles because it enables 
the wax to stick to the sides of containers better. Use approxi-
mately 10 percent soft microcrystalline for your container candles.
 
 Most of the time, microcrystalline is already included in your wax, so 
you don’t need to add it. Always read your package’s label. If the wax 
already includes microcrystalline, don’t add any more of this additive.
 
Use an additive only after you’ve determined that other factors — type of 
wax, wick, and temperature — aren’t the problem.
Candle-Making Know-How
Not sure what type of candle you want to create? Well, you have a variety of 
options, as the following list and Figure 5-3 show:
 
 Container: Container candles burn in the actual container that you pour 
them into. In essence, the container is your mold. (The later section 
“The container candle” shows you how to make a container candle.) One 
perk of container candles is that the container keeps the wax from drip-
ping onto your carpet, counters, or tables.
 
 Floating: Floating candles do just as they’re named and float in water. 
They’re often used in centerpieces.
 
 Pillar: Pillar candles are sturdy and thick. They can be short or tall and 
square or round. Some pillar candles are huge and contain multiple 
wicks. These candles are usually referred to by their diameter and 
height, as in a 3-x-5-inch pillar candle.
 
 Taper: Taper candles are long and slim and look elegant as centerpieces 
on your dining room table or on your fireplace mantel. Although taper 
molds are available, if you want to make these elegant creations, you can 
simply dip your wicks into melted wax. Go to “The basic taper candle” 
for instructions on creating taper candles.

222
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
 Tealights: Tealight candles are the same diameter as votives, but are just 
1 inch high. You can place them in a tealight holder or place them under 
something, such as a pot of simmering potpourri or a lampshade.
 
 Votives: Votive candles are short, small candles that are only 2 to 3 
inches high and 1/2 inch in diameter. Unlike pillar candles, votive candles 
are classified according to how long they burn. Most votives are 10-hour 
or 15-hour candles.

No matter what type of candle you make, you perform the same general 
tasks: You get yourself and your workspace ready; you prepare your molds 
and/or wicks; you heat and pour your wax; and so on. The following sections 
explain all the key components essential to candle-making, including how to 
stay safe while you do it.
Prepping your workspace and yourself
If you’ve ever had a burning candle drip on your carpet, then you know how 
difficult removing wax can be. That’s why you need to take time to prepare 
your workspace — unless, of course, you enjoy scraping wax off your 
countertops and removing stains from your clothes.

223
 Chapter 5: Making Candles
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
The kitchen’s the best place to make your candles simply because that’s the 
most likely place for your heat source, the stove. Follow these steps to get 
your workspace ready:
 
1. Choose an area near the stove where you have enough counter space 
to work.
 
 You need to be able to arrange all your supplies nearby, as well as have 
enough room to work. The closer you are to your heat source, the better 
off you are.
 
2. Line your countertop with aluminum foil, wax paper, or even an old 
dropcloth or sheet.
 
 Someone may have suggested that you use newspaper to line your 
countertop when making candles. Don’t! Although newspaper is indeed 
an inexpensive alternative — especially if you subscribe to a daily one 
and you’re going to toss it or recycle it anyway — the heat from the 
wax may cause the newsprint to get on your countertop.
 
 If you’re using aluminum foil or wax paper, turn up the edges at least an 
inch to prevent runoffs from leaky wax.
 
3. Tear off a few extra sheets of foil or paper.
 
 You can always use extra foil or paper, so have it ready now, before you 
need it. For example, after you pour your wax into the mold, you can use 
these extra sheets to place your mold on for extra coverage.
 
4. Get out anything else you may need, based on the project you’re 
making.
 
 Just as you would when making a recipe, make sure that you read 
through the project you’re making and get those supplies ready now as 
well. Good all-purpose items to have on hand include potholders and 
paper towels.
 
 Having a fire extinguisher on hand is a good idea, too. After all, it can 
never hurt to be overly prepared!
 
5. Shoo kids and pets from the room.
 
 When you’re making candles, your kitchen is no place for your kids or 
pets. Find a sitter, have your partner entertain your children, or make 
candles while the kids nap. Let your dog outside for a potty break or 
move your cat to a different room.
Believe it or not, you also want to dress for the occasion. (Didn’t know 
candle-making had a dress code, did you?) Although you don’t have to 
wear a specific candle-making uniform, you do need to put a little thought 
into what you’re wearing. Put on something that you don’t mind getting a 
little wax on and avoid wearing clothes that shed — unless you want your 
candles to have some fur.

224
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
Don’t overlook eye protection. Safety goggles can go a long way in protecting 
your eyes from splashes. And if you find yourself making lots of splashes, you 
may even want to consider wearing long sleeves and pants the next time.
Getting your wick ready
When you light a candle, the wick allows heat to travel down to the wax, 
melting it along the way. The wick then sucks up the melted wax to keep the 
candle burning. If the melted wax isn’t being used up at the right pace, the 
problem centers on the wick. So in order for a wick to do its job efficiently, it 
needs a little care from you during the candle-making process.
Choosing the right wick size
For your candle to burn nicely, you need the right-sized wick. The size of 
wick you require depends mainly on your candle’s diameter. Table 5-1 gives 
you a general guide for choosing your wicks.
Table 5-1 
Sizing Your Wick
If Your Diameter Is . . .
You Probably Want a Wick That’s . . .
0–1 inch
Extra small, 20 ply
1–2 inches
Small, 24 ply
2–3 inches
Medium, 30 ply
3–4 inches
Large, 36 ply
4 inches or more
Extra large, 40-plus ply
 
If your candle is large — say, more than 5 inches — use multiple wicks. 
Simply divide your diameter by three to come up with how many wicks you 
need for candles larger than 5 inches. For example, if your candle has a diam-
eter of 9 inches, you want to use three medium or large wicks. Never use 
more than five wicks in a candle, however.
Figuring out the right wick length for your candle is a lot more cut and dried 
than sizing your wick: Just take your candle’s height and add 4 to 6 inches 
extra for a pillar candle or 1/2 to 1 inch extra for a votive candle. The extra 
length gives you ample room to knot the wick on the bottom and secure it at 
the top of the mold.

Priming your wick
A primed wick is a wick soaked thoroughly with wax (something that’s usu-
ally done by you or the wick manufacturer). Priming does several things for 
your wick. It
 
 Jump-starts the combustion process by getting wax into the wick before 
you even light the candle
 
 Helps keep water droplets or additives from clogging the wick
 
 Makes the wick stronger so that you have an easier time threading it 
inside the candle
 
 Eliminates air inside the wick so you don’t have unsightly bubbles
 
 Makes the wick more likely to stand on its own so that, when you thread 
it through the top of the candle, it actually protrudes upright and not all 
drooped over
To prime your wicks, follow these steps:
 
1. Place your wax for priming in your double boiler and melt it until it 
reaches 190 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
2. Dip your wick into the melted wax for approximately 5 minutes (see 
Figure 5-4).
 
 You may see bubbles escaping from the wick. Don’t remove the wick 
from the wax until the bubbles have disappeared.
 
3. Place the wick somewhere (on aluminum foil, wax paper, or a candle 
rack) to dry.
 
 The wick will stiffen as it cools.
 
 Running the wick between your thumb and index finger as it cools 
makes it smoother and easier to thread into your mold. This optional 
step also makes the wick look better in your container or votive candle.
 
Most of the time, you use a primed wick in candle-making, but when you’re 
making tapers by dipping them in wax, you use an unprimed wick. The dip-
ping process itself primes the wick for you.
Attaching a tab to your wick
A tabbed wick is a wick that has a metal base (or wick tab) attached at the 
bottom of it, as shown in Figure 5-5. Tabs help your wicks stand upright and 
remain on the bottom of your container candles when you’re pouring wax. 
Just as you can prime your wicks (described in the preceding section), you 
can also tab them.

To tab your wick, you need only a pair of pliers: Simply thread your wick into 
the open part of the tab (see Figure 5-6a) and then use the pliers to close the 
tab around the wick (see Figure 5-6b).

Getting your mold ready and adding the wick
Before you can pour wax into a mold, you need to get it ready. That means 
spraying it with a releasing agent or wiping it with a thin film of vegetable 
oil before adding the wick. Most one-piece molds have a hole at the bottom 
that allows you to thread your wick into your candle. To add the wick, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Thread your wick through the bottom of the mold (as shown in 
Figure 5-7a).
 
2. Pull the wick to the top of the mold and tie it to a wick rod.
 
 The rod lies across the top of your mold, as you can see in Figure 5-7b.
 
3. From the bottom of the mold, pull the wick taut (see Figure 5-7c).
 
4. Place mold sealer around the wick hole so that your wax doesn’t leak 
out of your mold (as shown in Figure 5-7d).
 
 If you’re finished product looks like Figure 5-7e, you’re now ready to add 
your wax. See the next section for instructions on how to heat and pour 
your wax.
Working with wax
Making candles isn’t as simple as heading to your local craft store to buy 
“candle wax” and then returning home to melt and mold it into a candle. Not 
only do you have to know what kind of wax you need but you also need to 
know how to handle it. In the following sections, you discover the ins and 
outs of working with wax.

Figuring out how much wax you need
The easiest way to come up with your magic wax number is to simply fill 
your mold with water and measure how much liquid you used. (Be sure to 
block the mold’s wick hole first.) Then do a quick calculation: For every 3.5 
fluid ounces of water, you need 3 ounces of unmelted wax.
 
Don’t forget to melt a little extra wax so you have enough to repour into the 
mold to make up for the wax shrinking as it cools.
Melting wax
Follow these steps to melt your wax:
 
1. Determine the amount of wax you need.
 
 If you’re unsure about the amount, see the preceding section.
 
2. Place your wax in the top part of your double boiler.
 
 If you’re using a slab of wax, break it into smaller pieces so that it melts 
more quickly and evenly. Forget your hands; use stronger tools, such as 
a screwdriver.
 
 Choose your burner carefully. You don’t want to heat your wax too close 
to the wall, or you may run into smoke damage if you overheat it. Also, 
make sure that your double boiler is centered over the burner.
 
3. Add water to the bottom section of the double boiler.
 
 If you’re using two pots rather than an actual double boiler, the water 
should reach about two-thirds up the smaller pot’s sides.
 
4. Over medium heat, bring the water to a rolling boil.
 
 High heat will cause the water to boil too hard, and it may splash into 
your wax.
 
5. Heat your wax until it’s melted.
 
 Boil your water for a while (the candle projects in this chapter give you 
approximate times), but don’t forget to recheck the bottom pot occa-
sionally to make sure that it still has enough water to cover at least two-
thirds of the sides of the smaller pot.
 
 If wax gets on your burner, clean it up after the wax cools.

230
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
6. Check your wax’s temperature with your thermometer; when it 
reaches the correct temp, you’re done.
 
 You need to constantly check your wax’s temperature. Place your ther-
mometer directly in the wax and then immediately wipe off the wax after 
reading the temp. If your thermometer has a clip on it, you can actually 
attach it to the side of the pot and leave it there. That way you don’t 
have to keep inserting and cleaning it to monitor the wax’s temperature.
Pouring — and repouring — melted wax
If you’re like the majority of candle makers, you pour your melted wax into 
a prepared mold (refer to the earlier section “Getting your mold ready and 
adding the wick” for details). To pour your wax, be sure to do the following:
 
1. Carefully grab your melting container and begin pouring your wax 
smoothly into your mold.
 
 Stop about 1/2 inch before you reach the top of the mold. If you drip any 
wax down the side of the container, simply use a towel to wipe it up. 
Likewise, if water drips down the container’s side, wipe it off. (You don’t 
want to get water into your wax.)
 
 Don’t forget that you’re working with hot items: Obviously your pots 
and wax are hot, but so are the molds you just poured hot wax into. 
Aluminum molds in particular heat up more than others. Be careful and 
use potholders!
 
2. Very gently tap the side of your mold to remove any air bubbles.
 
 The type of wax you’re using determines what you do after you pour 
your wax. For example, if you’re making a paraffin mold candle and want 
a smooth, shiny finish, or simply want the candle to cool faster, you may 
want to place your mold into a cold water bath for a while. For details on 
making a paraffin mold candle, see the later section “The basic molded 
candle.”
 
3. Let the wax inside the mold cool for a while before pouring your extra 
wax (you’ll have to reheat it) to fill in any holes that have occurred as 
the wax cools.
 
 Wax shrinks as it cools. The act of adding more hot wax to a nearly 
cooled candle is called a repour.
 
4. Let your wax cool again, and then do a second repour.
 
5. Allow the wax to cool completely before removing your candle from 
the mold.
 
 Don’t forget to admire your handiwork!

Dealing with leftover wax
If you have any leftover wax, you can either store it for later use or discard it. 
To discard the leftover wax, just put it into a half-gallon, cardboard milk con-
tainer and let it cool. After the wax hardens, take it out and throw it away.
 
Never throw melted wax down the drain. After wax returns to a cool, hard-
ened state, it clogs up your drain. Along those same lines, don’t throw your 
boiling water down the drain, either. More than likely, it contains wax pieces 
as well. Pour the boiling water outside or let it cool so that you can remove 
the wax first.
If you want to reuse the wax, place it in a flexible container. After it hardens, 
remove the wax and place it in plastic bags for later use. Be sure to label the 
bags with the types of waxes you used.
 
Don’t think that you can save time by leaving the wax in your melting vessel 
and then remelting it later. Some candle makers out there remelt this way 
regularly, but doing so involves a huge potential risk: The top wax layer 
doesn’t melt as quickly as the bottom, and the liquid wax underneath causes 
an unexpected explosion of hot wax.
Playing it safe
Working with hot substances means you need to take the proper precau-
tions. Wear thick potholders whenever you’re removing your double boiler 
from the stove, as well as when you’re pouring or repouring your wax. The 
following sections provide additional, valuable safety information for when 
you’re heating wax, treating spills, or putting out a fire.
Heating wax
Unless you’re rolling beeswax candles, you must melt your solid wax into 
liquid wax. You don’t want to get your wax too hot, though, or it may com-
bust, causing a fire. Here are the key points to melting wax safely:
 
 Never leave your wax unattended as it melts. If you see smoke, you 
know you’re in danger of a fire. Immediately turn off the heat.
 
 Don’t melt your wax over direct heat or in a microwave. Using a 
double boiler slows the heating process and helps ensure your safety.
 
 Make sure you have enough water in your double boiler. Use enough 
to cover about two-thirds of the sides of the top pot.

Book II: Traditional Crafts 
Treating spills and burns
Alas, despite your best intentions, wax is bound to appear somewhere you 
don’t want it to — either while you’re making your candles or while you’re 
burning them. Perhaps the wax is on your floor, your carpet, your clothes, 
or yourself. Regardless, the next two sections show you how to handle such 
situations.
Hot wax on you
No matter what type of hot wax you spill on yourself, the basic treatment is 
the same.
 
1. Immediately place your injured body part in cool water.
 
 Don’t use cold water because extreme temperature shocks your skin.
 
2. When the wax cools and hardens, gently peel it off.
 
3. Treat your wax burn like any other burn.
 
 If your skin isn’t blistered, use calamine lotion or aloe vera (not butter). 
If your skin is blistered, definitely call your doctor or visit your local 
immediate care center.
Hot wax on something other than you
If the hot wax gets on something other than your body, follow these steps:
 
1. Wait until it hardens before you try to clean it up.
 
 Otherwise, you’re just spreading the goo and making a bigger mess. If 
you want to speed along the hardening process, try rubbing an ice cube 
on the wax to help cool it. If the item is movable, such as clothing, you 
can even place it in the freezer.
 
2. After the wax hardens, try to scrape up what you can.
 
 A wooden spatula works particularly well for scraping up hardened wax. 
Watch out if the wax is on something hard though, such as flooring or 
countertops, because you can scratch the object’s surface if you’re not 
careful.
 
3. If your spill is on your carpet or clothing, and scraping didn’t get all the 
wax off, cover the area with paper towels or newspaper and iron over it.
 
 Keep replacing the paper towels or newspapers and ironing the spot 
until the wax disappears.
 
 If this method doesn’t remove the wax from your clothes, try taking 
them to a dry cleaner because dry cleaning chemicals can often remove 
wax from fabric. Just let the shop know what it’s dealing with when you 
drop off the garments.

You may not be able to remove wax from porous material, such as unfinished 
wood, unglazed tile, or concrete.
Extinguishing a fire
Unfortunately, mishaps occur. Although a fire shouldn’t be in your future if 
you’re checking your temperature regularly during the melting process, you 
need to be prepared to deal with one just in case.
 
Turn off your heat source immediately if any of the following occurs:
 
 You check your wax’s temperature, and it’s dangerously high (anything 
over boiling point, which is 212 degrees Fahrenheit).
 
 Your wax begins to smoke.
 
 You smell something burning.
 
 Your wax ignites and catches fire.
Be aware that you may have no signs of an impending fire. Unlike water, wax 
doesn’t bubble when it reaches 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
If you think you’re in danger of a fire, don’t try to move your pan. A fire may 
occur at any minute, and you don’t want to take the chance of spreading it or 
spilling dangerously hot wax everywhere.
 
Wax is actually oil, so never pour water on it in an attempt to put it out if 
it’s on fire. If a fire occurs, smother the flames instead by using a metal lid, a 
damp cloth, a fire blanket, some baking soda, or an extinguisher — just not 
water!
After you’ve eliminated the fire, don’t touch the pan right away because it’s 
hot. When it’s cooled down, you can clean up just as you would any other 
fire — air out the area, throw away the pan after it cools, and call a fire repair 
company if the damage is severe.
Candle Projects
Whether you’re digging through the trash can in search of your empty yogurt 
cup from lunch (wash it, please!) or holding a freshly purchased pillar mold, 
this chapter is for you. Here, you get to try your hand at some basic projects: 
a molded candle, two dipped tapers, a rolled beeswax candle, and a con-
tainer candle.

234
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
Always read through a project before you begin so that you can properly pre-
pare your workspace and make sure that you have the necessary supplies. 
(For more on preparing your workspace and gathering the appropriate equip-
ment, see the earlier section “Prepping your workspace and yourself.”)
The basic molded candle
The type of candle you’ll probably make the most is a basic molded candle. 
You can use the technique described in this section to make many different 
types of candles. The type of mold you use doesn’t matter; the steps are still 
pretty much the same. And if you’re using a store-bought mold, professional-
looking results are almost guaranteed.
After you choose your mold, determine the amount and type of wax you 
need, and pick your wick (refer to the earlier “Choosing the right wick size” 
section for details), follow these steps:
 
1. Melt your wax to the package’s specified temperature.
 
 Aim for 190 degrees Fahrenheit — the temperature at which you pour 
the wax — if you’re recycling wax or you’re unsure of the right tempera-
ture. Maintain that temperature for half an hour.
 
 If you’re not certain how to melt wax, see the detailed steps in the ear-
lier section, “Melting wax.”
 
2. Spray your mold with a mold release, such as silicone or vegetable 
spray.
 
 Using a releasing agent helps you remove your candle from the mold.
 
3. Cut your primed wick so that it’s 2 inches longer than your finished 
candle’s height and then insert it into your mold.
 
 For instructions on inserting your wick, see the earlier section “Getting 
your mold ready and adding the wick.”
 
 You can do Steps 2 and 3 prior to melting your wax if you’re worried 
about time or if you prefer not to multitask.
 
4. When your wax reaches the required temperature, add any additives, 
color, or scent.
 
 Unless you’re using a flexible mold, add stearin in proportion to 10 per-
cent of your wax; if you’re using a flexible mold, use vybar. (Refer to the 
section titled “Additives” for info about these products.)

235
 Chapter 5: Making Candles
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
 
 After you add these ingredients, your wax’s temperature will probably 
drop, so continue heating your wax a little longer until it reaches the 
proper temperature again.
 
5. Remove your wax from the heat and slowly and smoothly pour it into 
your mold.
 
 Be careful not to get any water into your wax. The section “Pouring — 
and repouring — melted wax” offers tips on pouring your wax.
 
6. Wait a few minutes and then gently tap the side of your mold to 
remove any air bubbles.
 
7. As your wax cools, poke holes in the wax around the wick to release 
tension.
 
 If you don’t, the wax pulls the wick off-center and may create a concave 
section on the outside of the candle.
 
8. After your wax has cooled quite a while, reheat the extra wax you 
saved and pour it into any holes that have occurred as the wax cools.
 
9. Let your wax cool almost completely and then do a second repour.
 
 Don’t rush this step. If you repour the wax while the candle is still hot 
and liquid, you’re just adding more hot wax that has to shrink.
 
10. After your candle has cooled completely, remove it from the mold by 
taking away any mold sealer that you used.
 
 The bottom of the mold now becomes the top of your candle.
 
 If your candle isn’t coming out of your mold, you may not have let it cool 
long enough. Wait a few hours and try again later.
 
11. Clean up the candle.
 
 Use a craft knife or other sharp object to level off the bottom of the 
candle and trim the wick. Use a paper towel or cloth to wipe around 
your candle and remove any extra wax.
 
 Congratulations! Your candle is now ready to burn.
The basic taper candle
You can make basic taper candles (refer to Figure 5-8) in two ways: You can 
dip them (the ways pioneers did), or you can buy a taper mold and follow the 
steps in the preceding section. This section focuses solely on how to dip a 
candle.

236
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
The dipping process is pretty straightforward: You basically melt the wax, dip 
both ends of a wick in it, let it cool, and repeat 20 to 30 times or more until your 
candle is the desired width. You don’t have to do anything special to create the 
tapered look — it just happens naturally. Here’s how the process works:
 
1. Figure out how tall you want each taper to be, add a couple extra 
inches so that your wick protrudes, double that amount, and then add 
4 inches for space.
 
 When you make tapers, you usually dip in pairs, but you use only one 
wick. If you want to create 6-inch tapers, for example, then you take 6 
inches plus 2 inches to get 8 inches. You multiply that number by 2 to 
get 16 inches (enough wick for two candles) and then add 4 inches to 
the total so that you have space in between the candles. (You don’t want 
the ends of your wick to touch each other when you dip.) So to make 
two 6-inch tapers, you need to cut your wick to 20 inches.
 
2. Tie a weight to each end of the wick so that it stays submerged and 
straight while you dip.
 
 Rocks work just fine as weights. You remove these weights later when 
the wick is strong enough to stay straight.
 
3. Melt twice the wax (plus 10-percent stearin) you think you need at 170 
degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature at which dipping works best.
 
 When you dip candles, you usually use paraffin wax or a mixture 
of beeswax and paraffin. Either way, you probably need to add the 
usual 10-percent stearin. (For more on stearin, see the earlier section 
“Additives.”) You need to have plenty left over so that you have enough 
wax to dip in.
 
4. Fill your dipping can with wax.
 
 Make sure that your dipping can is tall enough to accommodate the 
size of the candle you want to make. Also, fill the dipping can fairly full 
so that you can dip almost all the way up the wick. You have to keep 
adding wax to the dipping can throughout the process to keep it full.
 
5. Dip your wick into your melted wax.
 
 You want to dip your wick deep enough so that you have only a couple 
inches of undipped wick remaining. Don’t linger too long on this dip, 
though. You want your wick in the wax for only a second. Plunge it in 
and then remove it smoothly so that the wax doesn’t blob. Meanwhile, 
keep these tidbits in mind:
 
• If your taper looks bumpy, your wax isn’t warm enough.
 
• If your wax isn’t building up on your wick, your wax is too hot.

237
 Chapter 5: Making Candles
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
 
• If the wax isn’t firming up enough between dips, you need to let it 
cool longer in between dips.
 
 Make sure that the ends of your wick don’t touch each other, or you end 
up with a wax glob. You can use your hands to keep the ends apart, or 
you may want to use a straw, dowel rod, or piece of cardboard (refer to 
Figures 5-8a and 5-8b).
 
6. Place your wicks over a rack or dowel rod until they cool.
 
 The cooling process takes approximately 3 minutes. Basically, the wax 
should feel cool to the touch.
 
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 until your candle is the diameter you want.
 
 You may have to dip your candles 20 or 30 times, or even more. Every 
time you dip, more wax builds up on your wick. Eventually, your wick 
becomes two tapers.

 If you want your taper surfaces to be glossy, dip your tapers immedi-
ately into cool water after your last dip into the wax.
 
8. Let your tapers cool a few hours before handling them and trimming 
your wick to 1/4 inch.

238
Book II: Traditional Crafts 
 
9. Size the base, if necessary.
 
 In general, taper candles are 7/8 inch in diameter at the bottom so that 
they can fit into most candleholders. If you’re not using a mold, you 
probably need to cut the base of the candle down to that size. To cut the 
taper’s base to the size of the candleholder you plan to use, use a craft 
knife and score around the base of your cooled candle. Then remove the 
strips of wax until your taper fits perfectly into the desired holder.
 
As you can see, dipping candles is a fairly easy process. The most difficult 
part is often simply waiting for the wax to cool between each dip. If you’re 
impatient, you may want to create several tapers at once so that you’re con-
stantly dipping in rotation and don’t have to wait.
The rolled beeswax candle
A simple beeswax candle can create quite a buzz and may just be the perfect 
first candle for beginners. In fact, this project is particularly ideal for young 
children. Why? Because you don’t need to melt any wax or use a lot of fancy 
equipment. You simply roll sheets of beeswax into a round candle. (You can 
easily make other shapes as well.)
The only downside is that beeswax is sticky at any temperature, and it gets 
even stickier when it’s warm. (So don’t let your child touch her hair when 
messing with this stuff!) But it’s not so sticky that you and your youngster 
can’t work with it. (In fact, that stickiness can actually work in your favor 
because the beeswax sheets adhere to each other as you roll them.) You just 
need to make sure that you don’t pick up any extra fuzz.
 
When you roll your candle, you want your beeswax sheet to be at room tem-
perature. Ideally, it has been at this temp for at least a few days.
To roll a beeswax candle, you need two sheets of beeswax and a primed wick. 
Here’s what you want to do:
 
1. Cut your primed wick so that it’s 3/4 inch longer than the height of 
your finished candle.
 
 If you’re using a normal beeswax sheet, which measures 8 inches x 16 
inches, your candle will be about 8 inches tall, so you want your wick 
to be approximately 8 3/4 inches. If you want to make two 8-inch tapers 
instead, just cut the sheet in half long ways and roll two candles.
 
 When working with beeswax, use a wick that’s one size larger than you’d 
normally use. See the earlier sections “Wicks” and “Getting your wick 
ready” for details on choosing the correct wick type and size and for info 
about what to do if your wick isn’t already primed.

239

2. Lay your beeswax sheet on a hard surface and place your wick along 
the edge, as shown in Figure 5-9a.
 
3. Apply pressure, smoothly but firmly rolling the edge of the sheet 
around the wick, and continue rolling the beeswax into a cylindrical 
shape.
 
 As shown in Figure 5-9b, you want to make sure you’re rolling straight. 
Otherwise, your edges won’t align. You also want to roll tightly enough 
so that you don’t trap air between the layers, which can affect how well 
your candle burns.
 
 If you want to make a square candle, just flatten each side with a hard 
object as you roll. If you want to make a shorter candle, cut the short 
side of the beeswax sheet in half prior to rolling it.

Making a 
beeswax 
candle is

as adding 
a wick and

ing it into a

4. When you reach the end of the first sheet, attach your second sheet of 
beeswax by firmly pinching the edges of each sheet together and then 
continue rolling.
 
 For a larger candle, you can use as many sheets of beeswax consecu-
tively as you need to reach your desired diameter.
 
5. Trim your wick.
 
 Wait at least a day, preferably longer, before lighting your new 
masterpiece.
 
You want your beeswax to be at least room temperature or warmer, or it will 
break. If you’re having trouble, try using a hairdryer to heat the sheets. But 
don’t go too warm, or the wax may begin to melt and become a sticky mess.

Book II: Traditional Crafts 
The container candle
If you’re the creative type, you may find yourself gravitating toward con-
tainer candles. The technique for making a container candle is very similar 
to making a molded candle. The container, in essence, acts as your mold. 
The only difference is that you don’t use the additive stearin because you 
want the wax to adhere to the sides of your container. Instead, you may want 
to opt for 2-percent soft microcrystalline, which has the opposite effect of 
stearin. (See the earlier section “Additives” for details.)
After you choose your container, determine the amount of wax you need, and 
select the best wick, follow these steps:
 
1. Melt your wax to the package’s specified pouring temperature.
 
 If you’re recycling wax, or you’re unsure about the temperature you 
want, heat the wax to 190 degrees Fahrenheit. (See the earlier section 
“Melting wax” for directions if you’re not sure how to melt wax.)
 
2. Cut your primed, tabbed wick so that it’s 1 inch longer than your 
container.
 
 You want your wick primed so that it’s strong enough to stand up when 
you pour the wax. The wick tab helps your wick stay in place at the 
bottom of your container.
 
3. When your wax reaches the required temperature, add any additives, 
color, or scent you want.
 
 If you add anything to your wax, your wax’s temperature will probably 
drop, so heat it a little longer until it reaches the proper temperature 
again.
 
4. Remove your wax from the heat and slowly and smoothly add a 
1/2-inch layer of wax to your container.
 
5. Rest your tabbed wick in the center of your candle.
 
 You want the wick to rest on the bottom of the container, so it needs 
to be tabbed. If your wick isn’t tabbed, you can easily tab it yourself, as 
long as you have the supplies. (See the earlier section “Attaching a tab 
to your wick” for a quick how-to.)
 
6. After the wax cools, add another 1/2-inch layer of wax.
 
 You want only about an inch at the top of your container that’s uncov-
ered by wax.
 
7. As the wax begins to harden, poke holes around the wick.

241
 Chapter 5: Making Candles
Book II
Traditional 
Crafts
 
8. Pour another 1/2-inch layer of wax to fill in the holes you pricked.
 
 This step reduces the temperature of the wax so that your candle 
doesn’t shrink as much. It also helps you avoid the nasty center hole 
that sometimes develops as the wax burns.
 
9. Repeat Steps 7 and 8 until the container is full and the surface 
remains level.
 
10. Allow the candle to cool completely.
 
11. Trim your wick to 1/4 inch.
 
Glass tends to break if it comes into contact with a flame for a long time, so 
trimming your wick is especially important when working with this type of 
container. If you’re using glass and you think that the length of the wick may 
cause the wick to touch the sides of your container or candleholder, by all 
means, shorten the wick’s length. Other ways to help avoid this problem 
include making sure that your wick is centered when you pour your wax and 
that you’re using a good-quality glass container that can withstand heat.

F
or many gardeners, growing food is the real reason for gardening. There 
really isn’t anything quite like the feeling of satisfaction a gardener gets 
from nurturing and encouraging a tomato plant to put forth the most gor-
geous and delicious tomatoes imaginable, or harvesting a healthy and tasty 
bunch of berries from a tree planted right in your front yard.
While the other chapters in Book III tell you everything you need to know 
about growing vegetables (Chapter 2), herbs (Chapter 3), and fruits, nuts, 
and berries (Chapter 4) — as well as how to maintain your garden so that 
you can produce the produce you want — this chapter is devoted to getting 
you started. And that means helping you put together a plan that details not 
only what you want to grow, but where and how you want to grow it.
Planting Plots with Personality
A lot of planning goes into your edible garden, but that doesn’t mean it has to 
resemble a miniature farm, with perfectly-spaced rows of typical vegetables 
or fruit trees lined up like soldiers. Here are some suggestions for distinctive 
gardens to get your mouth watering and your creative juices flowing.

246
Book III: Edible Gardening 
Ornamental edible gardens
Just because you plan to use the produce from the plants you grow doesn’t 
mean your garden has to look utilitarian. If you treat your edible plants like 
ornamental plants — and arrange them for looks as well as for growing char-
acteristics — you can end up with a garden that not only produces delicious, 
healthful food but also looks darn good while doing it.
Figure 1-1 shows a plan for a summer vegetable-flower garden that could be 
tucked into any sunny corner of a front or back yard. The garden in Figure 1-1 
includes a variety of vegetables, herbs, and flowers, arranged along a central 
path.
To make this kind of planting work, consider these suggestions:
 
 Match the bloom seasons of flowers with the growth cycles of veg-
etables and other edible plants. In other words, mix flowers that grow 
in cool weather with vegetables that like similar conditions. Chapter 2 
gives you all the information about vegetable planting times. (You can 
find out more about planting flowers in Gardening Basics For Dummies, 
by Steven A. Frowine and the editors of the National Gardening 
Association [Wiley].)
 
 Mix in herbs — like parsley, chives, and thyme (described in Chapter 
3). Most of these are great ornamentals in their own right.
 
 Match cultural needs of the plants. Most vegetables need a constant 
supply of water. Don’t combine these with flowers that like it on the dry 
side.
 
 Give your plants enough room to grow; don’t crowd them. If the flow-
ers have a spreading habit, you may even plant things farther apart.
 
 Put short plants in front, tall plants in back. The idea is to create a 
smooth transition in sizes from the front of the bed to the back. That 
way, you’ll be able to see everything — smaller plants won’t be blocked 
or shaded by taller ones.
 
 Leave room to harvest. Use stepping stones or paths so that you can 
harvest vegetables, herbs, and fruits without damaging your flowers.
 
 Have a color theme. Cluster colors that blend well: pink pansies planted 
at the base of ruby-colored rhubarb, white alyssum planted with green 
chard, red leaf lettuce planted with purple Johnny-jump ups, or red 
petunias planted at the base of pepper plants.
 
 Plant foliage vegetables and herbs. Vegetables and herbs with colorful 
or bold textures combine well with flowers. Use a lot of basil, chard, 
kale, lettuce, cabbage, chives, parsley, and other leafy vegetables.

Themed edible gardens
Why limit yourself to growing only carrots, corn, and beans — the staples 
of many vegetable plots and home gardens? Get creative! Group vegetables 
by their special uses. Grow a historic garden. Grow a garden based on food 
themes. This is where gardening gets really fun, and you’re limited only by 
your imagination (and the length of your growing season). The following list 
describes several popular garden themes:
 
 Greens Garden: Do you love lettuce and other salad greens? Grow a 
colorful greens garden filled with different colors and textures of lettuce, 
endive, corn salad, radicchio, spinach, Swiss chard, and parsley.
 
 Mexican Salsa Garden: Are you addicted to salsa? Create a special nook 
for your own salsa garden, complete with different varieties of tomatoes, 
tomatillos, cilantro, peppers, and onions.
 
 Oriental Stir Fry Garden: Do you love to wok it up? Grow all the ingredi-
ents you need for a stir fry by planting pac choi, Chinese cabbage, snow 
peas, garlic, and scallions.

248
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
 Pizza Garden: This one’s for the kids. Design a circular garden and, in 
triangular sections (like pizza slices), grow favorite pizza toppings such 
as peppers, onions, and tomatoes.
 
 Three Sisters Garden: Add a historic flair to your vegetable garden by 
growing corn, pole beans, and squash in a traditional Native American 
garden. 
 
Theme gardens don’t have to take over your entire garden. All that’s required 
is a corner or one raised bed. Just remember the spacing requirements for 
your plants.
You can also create a small-space block garden. Often called the “square-foot 
garden,” this square bed is only 3 feet wide but still packs a lot of punch for 
a petite plot: The bed is divided into nine 1-foot squares, each planted with a 
different vegetable. Containerized vegetable gardens are a good idea if all you 
have is a small patio or rooftop.
Growing up — on a trellis or a teepee — saves space, too. Consider train-
ing pole beans, peas, Malabar spinach, cucumber vines, small melons like 
Charentais, and mini pumpkins to grow skyward.
Mapping Out Your Garden
Designing an edible garden is both a practical and a creative process. 
Practically speaking, you have to arrange your plants so that they have room 
to grow and so that taller vegetables don’t shade lower-growing ones. Different 
planting techniques fit the growth habits of different kinds of vegetables. And 
you should also think about access: How will you get to your plants to harvest, 
weed, or water them? Despite these practical considerations, creativity is also 
important to the design process. After all, vegetables can be good-looking as 
well as practical, as the preceding sections suggest.
In the following sections, I give you the basics so that you can start to sketch 
out a garden plan of what to plant and where to put it. I also provide a sample 
garden design to get your juices flowing. Before you know it, you’ll be a gar-
dening wizard!
Deciding on rows, hills, or raised beds
Before you sketch a garden plan, you need to decide how to arrange the 
plants in your garden and how you’ll water them. You can use three basic 
planting arrangements: rows, hills, or raised beds.

249
 Chapter 1: Planning Your Edible Garden
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
Planting in rows for roominess
Any vegetable can be planted in rows, but this arrangement works best with 
types that need quite a bit of room, such as tomatoes, beans, cabbages, corn, 
potatoes, peppers, and summer squash.
Growing vining plants in hills
Hills are best for vining crops such as cucumbers, melons, and winter 
squash. You can create a 1-foot-wide, flat-topped mound for heavy soil, or 
you can create a circle at ground level for sandy soil. You then surround the 
soil with a moat-like ring for watering. Two or three evenly spaced plants are 
grown on each hill. Space the hills the recommended distance between rows 
of the vegetable you’re planting.
Planting small veggies in raised beds
Raised beds are kind of like wide, flat-topped rows. They’re usually at least 2 
feet wide and raised at least 6 inches high. Raised beds are best for smaller 
vegetables that can be planted close together, such as lettuce, carrots, 
onions, spinach, radishes, and turnips. Vegetables in raised beds can be 
planted in random patterns or in closely spaced rows.
 
Any planting area that’s raised above the surrounding ground level is a raised 
bed. It can simply be a normal bed with the soil piled 5 or 6 inches high, or it 
can be a bed located in a large container with wood, stone, or masonry sides.
Raised beds have several advantages:
 
 They rise above soil problems. If you have bad soil or poor drainage, 
raised beds are for you. You can amend the garden soil in the raised bed 
with the same sterile potting soil you use for containers. And because 
you don’t step on the beds as you work, the soil is more likely to stay 
light and fluffy — providing the perfect conditions for root growth.
 
 They warm up early. Because more of the soil in raised beds is exposed 
to the sun, the soil warms early, allowing for early planting and extended 
harvest seasons.
 
 They consolidate your work. By growing your vegetables in raised 
beds, you can maximize your fertilizing and watering so that more nutri-
ents and water are actually used by the plants rather than being wasted 
in the pathways.
 
 They’re easy on your back. If you design the beds properly (about 24 to 
36 inches high and no wider than 4 feet), raised beds can make vegeta-
ble gardening a lot more comfortable. You can sit on the edge (cap the 
edge to make it more bench-like) and easily reach into the bed to weed 
or harvest.

250
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
 They’re attractive. Raised beds add a wonderful organized formality to 
the vegetable garden. They can be made from materials that match your 
house, patio, or deck. A series of raised beds can create an attractive 
focal point in your yard.
The one downside of permanent raised beds is that it’s difficult to get a tiller 
inside the bed to work the soil. However, with some of the newer lightweight 
tillers, maneuvering a tiller inside a raised bed is getting easier. You can also 
turn the soil by hand with an iron fork; it’s more work than using a tiller, but 
it’s effective.
 
In dry areas such as the desert Southwest, the traditional bed is not raised — it’s 
sunken. Dig into the soil about 6 inches and make a small wall of soil around 
the outside of the bed. This design allows the bed to catch any summer rains, 
protects young plants from drying winds, and concentrates water where the 
vegetables grow.
Planning your planting
As you plan your garden, you need to know how far apart to space your 
plants, how many plants you need to purchase for a particular size plot, and 
how much yield to expect.
 
Vegetable spacings are just guidelines, derived from agricultural recommen-
dations for maximum yield per acre. With close attention to soil preparation, 
watering, and fertilizing, you can plant closer and still get a good harvest. 
You can also find compact, space-saving varieties of many vegetables, fruits, 
and herbs.
 
Although closer planting is possible, if you plant so close that plants have 
to compete with each other for food, water, and light, you’ll eventually get 
smaller harvests or lower-quality vegetables.
Penciling it in
Drawing a garden plan doesn’t require any landscaping expertise. Once you 
determine the location and dimensions of your garden, you just need a piece 
of graph paper and a pencil, a list of vegetables, fruits, and herbs you want 
to grow, and maybe a seed catalog or two. With these things in hand, you 
can start drawing. Fill in spaces for your favorite crops, taking into account 
the space requirements of the crops you want to grow; whether you want to 
plant in rows, beds, or hills; and how much of each vegetable you want to 
harvest. Garden design has any number of possibilities. Just keep in mind a 
few things:

251
 Chapter 1: Planning Your Edible Garden
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
 
 You can’t plant everything. Choose your crops carefully.
 
 Not all plants have it made in the shade. Tall crops, such as corn and 
tomatoes, should be placed where they won’t shade other vegetables. 
The north end of the garden is usually best.
 
 These roots aren’t made for walking. Plan your garden with walkways 
(at least 2- to 3-feet wide, wider if you need to use a wheelbarrow or 
garden cart) so you can get to plants easily without damaging roots.
Planning on paper helps you purchase the right amount of seeds or trans-
plants and use space more efficiently. It’s a good way to see the possibilities 
for succession planting (following one crop with another) and interplanting 
(planting a quick-maturing crop next to a slower-maturing one and harvesting 
the former before it competes for space). For example, you may see that you 
can follow your late peas with a crop of late broccoli, and you can be ready 
with transplants in July. Or you may see that you have room to tuck a few 
lettuce plants among your tomatoes while the vines are still small. Figure 1-2 
shows a sample of what your garden plan might look like.

Frost Dates and the Length 
of the Growing Season
You should know two very important dates for your area if you want to grow 
anything successfully: the average date of the last frost in spring and the 
average date of the first frost in fall. The number of days between the aver-
age date of the last frost in spring and the average date of the first frost in fall 
tells you the length of your growing season, which can range from less than 
100 days in northern or cold winter climates to 365 days in frost-free south-
ern climates. This info is important because it tells you
 
 What to plant: Many warm-season vegetables need long, warm growing 
seasons to properly mature and are difficult, if not impossible, to grow 
where growing seasons are short. So how do you know whether your 
growing season is long enough? Just check the mail-order seed catalogs or 
individual seed packets. Each variety has the number of days to harvest 
or days to maturity (usually posted in parentheses next to the variety 
name). This is the number of days it takes for that vegetable to grow from 
seed (or transplant) to harvest. If your growing season is only 100 days 
long and you want to grow a melon or other warm-season vegetable that 
takes 120 frost-free days to mature, you have a problem. The plant will 
probably be killed by frost before the fruit is mature.
 
 In areas with short growing seasons, it’s usually best to go with early rip-
ening varieties (those with the shortest number of days to harvest). You 
can also find many effective ways to extend your growing season, such 
as starting seeds indoors or planting under floating row covers (blanket-
like materials that drape over plants, creating warm, greenhouse-like 
conditions underneath).
 
 When to plant: Cool-season vegetables are generally planted 4 to 6 
weeks before the last spring frost. (Fall planting of cool-season vegeta-
bles is less dependent on frost dates, but is usually done 8 to 12 weeks 
before the first fall frost.) Warm-season vegetables are planted after the 
last spring frost or in late summer in warm areas for a fall harvest.
 
 When to protect warm-season vegetables: Frosts kill warm-season 
vegetables. The closer you plant to the last frost of spring, the more 
important it is to protect plants. And as the fall frost gets closer, so 
does the end of your summer vegetable season — unless, of course, 
you protect your plants.
To find out frost dates for your area, ask at your local nursery or contact 
your local cooperative extension office (look in the phone book under 
“county government”).

253
 Chapter 1: Planning Your Edible Garden
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
 
Frost dates are averages, meaning that half the time the frost will actu-
ally come earlier than the average date and half the time it will occur later. 
They’re also usually given for large areas. If you live in a cold spot in the 
bottom of a valley, frosts may come days earlier in fall and days later in 
spring. If you live in a warm spot, your frost may come later in fall and stop 
earlier in spring. Listening to your evening weather forecast is one of the best 
ways to find out whether frosts are expected in your area.
 
Don’t trust the weathercasters? Do a little prognosticating yourself: Go out-
side late in the evening and check conditions. If the fall or early spring sky is 
clear and full of stars, and the wind is still, conditions are right for a frost. If 
you need to protect plants, do so at that time.

F
or the cost of a packet of seeds, you can have your own, homegrown 
produce. The requirements are simple: good soil, moisture, and full sun. 
This type of gardening is usually called vegetable gardening, even though it 
also involves growing items that are technically fruit, such as tomatoes and 
melons (Chapter 4 can fill you in on growing traditional fruits and berries). 
Growing your own produce — or vegetables, as it were — can be fun and 
fairly easy for the beginning gardener. This chapter gives you the basics. If 
you want even more information, check out Gardening Basics For Dummies by 
Steven A. Frowine and The National Gardening Association (Wiley).
 
Growing your own veggies really isn’t and shouldn’t be about saving money — 
though you may, even after factoring in your labor. It’s about freshness (and 
thus nutrition; freshly harvested vegetables are always nutritionally superior 
to anything you buy at a supermarket — even at your local farmers’ market). 
It’s about flavor — oh boy, is it about flavor! And it’s about reconnecting with 
the land.
Vegetable Basics: Hybrids, Heirlooms, 
and Growing Seasons
Lots of wonderful and worthwhile types of vegetables are available — too 
many to list, in fact. You could garden all your life and still not get around 
to growing all the tempting choices that would prosper in your particular 
region! But that’s what makes vegetable gardening possible for everyone and 
keeps it so interesting.

256
Book III: Edible Gardening 
What this section does share is information about hybrids and heirlooms so 
that you can decide whether one type or another suits your needs. It also 
explains the growing season and days to maturity: two factors you need to 
consider before you pick any vegetable to grow in your garden.
 
Because of the wide variety of vegetables available, don’t limit yourself to 
the same old, same old. Instead, favor vegetables that are too expensive at 
the store or never available locally, or treat yourself to new foods or enticing 
variations on old standbys.
Factoring in growing season 
and days to maturity
To figure out whether the growing season in your area is conducive to the 
type of vegetable you want to grow, you need to know two things: the grow-
ing season in your area (obviously) and the number of days it takes a veg-
etable variety to mature (called days to maturity).
First, get an idea of the growing season that you have to contend with. 
Typically, the vegetable-gardening season is summer, bookended by late 
spring and early fall. Gardeners mark the start by the last spring frost date 
and the finish by the first fall frost date (although some crops, like parsnips 
and kale, can stay out in the cold a bit longer and even gain improved flavor). 
Then determine the days to maturity of the vegetable variety you’re inter-
ested in planting. The preceding chapter explains how.
With this info, you can match your vegetables to the length of your growing 
season. If your growing season is approximately 90 days, growing anything 
billed as maturing in that amount of time or less ought to be easy. If you push 
the envelope, be prepared to help that variety with an early start indoors or 
some extra coddling in the fall. With experience, you’ll find out what you can 
and are willing to do.
Table 2-1 gives an overview of which vegetables tend to do better during 
which seasons.

Cool-season 
vegetables
These plants tolerate some 
frost and temperatures 
between 55 and 70°F. As 
such, they’re fine choices 
for gardeners in northern 
areas or, in milder climates, 
for growing in a cool spring 
or fall.

vegetables
These plants are readily 
harmed by frost; they also 
fare poorly in cold soil. Grow 
these plants in temperatures 
ranging from 65 to 80°F. 
They’re good in the South 
and West year-round and 
elsewhere during the height 
of summer.

Perennials
These edible plants live from 
one year to the next, typically 
producing good crops their 
second or third seasons and 
thereafter. You can grow 
them in most climates, pro-
viding a protective winter 
mulch if warranted.
Asparagus and rhubarb
The following sections offer advice on how to get the most of your growing 
season, whether it’s long or short — or even in the winter!
Long growing seasons
If your growing season is long and warm, you can get started earlier and 
maybe even plant two or three rounds of crops. You may, however, have to 
contend with hot, dry weather at the height of summer, which is stressful for 
some vegetable crops (so mulch them and supply extra water).
Short growing seasons
You can have a very bountiful vegetable garden. Choose vegetables that 
mature faster, and try some season-extending tricks. Here are two favorites:

258
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
 Start seeds early indoors or in a cold frame. A cold frame is basically 
a box made of such materials as wood or concrete blocks covered with 
a glass or plastic sash that protects smaller plants from extreme cold 
and wind. Raise your plants to seedling-size until putting them out in 
the ground is safe. (See the upcoming section “Starting your own seeds 
indoors.”)
 
 Use plastic coverings to keep a plant and its immediate soil nice and 
warm. You can get plastic from row-cover sheeting or tunnels, cones, 
recycled milk jugs, or water-wall wraps, shown in Figure 2-1.

sisting of

Growing vegetables in winter
You can grow some vegetables during the winter. Really! In mild climates, 
you can enjoy kale, carrots, leeks, and root vegetables all winter long. You 
may have to mulch them and then poke underneath the mulch to harvest, 
but, hey, it’s worth it! You can even sow salad greens in October and harvest 
extra-early in spring. Mmm.

 Chapter 2: Vegetables, Glorious Vegetables
Book III

Defining hybrids
You may see the term hybrid on seed packets and in seed catalogs. All it 
means is that the vegetable variety in question is a result of a cross (through 
pollination) between two parent plants of the same species but different sub-
species or varieties.
Uniformity, predictability, and disease resistance are the results of combin-
ing the genetic traits of two good parents. In fact, hybrid offspring are often 
more robust and productive than either parent. Something called hybrid 
vigor often appears, a healthy exuberance that seems to result from the good 
qualities of one parent canceling out the bad of the other. It takes quite a bit 
to produce a hybrid — at least one that has the desirable traits you want. 
But don’t fret. Seed companies do all the work, winnowing out the duds and 
making sure the plants can replicate desirable results with precision. All you 
have to do is buy the good seeds.
Favorite hybrid vegetables include “Big Boy” beefsteak tomatoes, “Blushing 
Beauty” bell peppers, “Nantes” carrots, “Salad Bowl” leaf lettuce, “Silver 
Queen” sweet corn, and “Crenshaw” cantaloupe melon.
What’s the catch? Actually, there are two.
 
 Hybrids are more expensive. Producing hybrid seed requires the seed 
company to maintain the two parent lines and often to laboriously hand-
pollinate, so hybrid seeds are more expensive than the alternative.
 
 You can’t save and replant the seeds. The resulting plant won’t “come 
true” — that is, it won’t be the same, and, indeed, it may exhibit various 
mongrel qualities from either of its parents. So you’re bound to pur-
chase fresh, new hybrid seeds each year if you want to grow a hybrid 
variety that you like.
Appreciating heirlooms
Heirloom vegetables are vegetable varieties that people save and pass on 
for such home-gardening virtues as excellent flavor and a prolonged harvest 
period. Commercial seed companies, on the other hand, breed for uniformity, 
the ability to withstand shipping (thicker, tougher skins on tomatoes and 
squash, for instance), and all-at-once ripening (for harvesting convenience). 
You may prefer heirlooms. The older ones that are still in circulation have 
obviously stood the test of time and should be worthwhile.

260
Book III: Edible Gardening 
Favorite heirloom vegetable varieties include “Moon and Stars” watermelons,
“Tom Thumb” baby butterhead lettuce, “Gold Nugget” winter squash, 
“Ragged Jack” kale, “Super Italian Paste” tomatoes, “Henderson’s Bush” lima 
beans, and “French Breakfast” spring radishes.
What’s the catch with heirlooms? Well, they’re not as perfect or uniform-
looking. Because heirlooms aren’t commercially bred, they may be more 
colorful and more variable in size and shape than their hybrid counter-
parts. Also, their skins may be thinner, so you get great flavor, but they 
don’t travel well and may be vulnerable to bruising — or they may have lots 
of seeds inside (as in certain squashes and pumpkins), causing you a bit of 
extra work to separate out the edible parts.
For details on techniques, as well as much more fascinating and useful 
information on heirloom vegetables, check out Seed Savers Exchange 
(www.seedsavers.org).
Getting Your Vegetable Garden Ready
Most produce is, of course, grown in a vegetable garden, and it’s always best 
to get your garden started before acquiring your plants. Before you even 
begin to dig into the soil, the first step is to design your garden.
Saving your own seeds
Whether it’s a nice tradition, a survival skill, or 
a way to honor gardeners of the past, saving 
seeds from your favorite vegetable varieties 
is a fun and rewarding skill. At season’s end, 
you have to harvest ripe seed, extract it from 
its fruit, dry it, and store it in a cool, dry place 
until you need it next year. If you’d like to give 
seed-saving a try, try starting with squash or 
pumpkins — they’re easy.
If you plan to save seeds, keep this little caveat 
in mind: Depending on what else you grow in 
your garden, cross-pollination can interfere and 
must be prevented, either by covering flowering 
crops (to keep insects and bees from tampering 
with them or the wind from contaminating them) 
or staggering planting dates.

Sketching out your plan
The best planning advice is simple: Start small. Just be sure you locate your 
garden in a spot where expansion is possible, in case you want to make your 
garden bigger in the coming years. As for the actual size of your garden, that 
depends on what you want to grow. Just to give you a general idea, here’s 
what you can put in the following standard-size gardens:
 
 A 6-x-8-foot plot can support a couple tomato plants, maybe some bush 
beans, and some lettuce.
 
 A 10-x-18-foot plot can hold all that, plus a couple space-consuming 
squash plants and cucumbers, and maybe some carrots or beets.
 
 A 20-x-24-foot plot can hold all that, plus peppers, leeks, broccoli, 
turnips, and maybe some herbs as well.
 
 A 40-x-60-foot plot allows you more of everything, plus some bigger 
items, such as asparagus, rhubarb, or corn. (Corn isn’t worth growing 
unless you can have a dozen or more plants. Otherwise, they don’t 
pollinate or pollinate completely, and you end up harvesting gap-
toothed ears.)
Sketch out your vegetable garden plan on paper ahead of time. Figure out 
how much space to allot to individual plants — and don’t forget to allow for 
space between the rows, or paths, so you can tend the plants. (Mature sizes 
of various vegetable varieties are noted on seed packets and often in catalog 
descriptions.) The following sections give you a couple ideas about how to 
arrange your plants.
Succession planting
Allow for succession planting: If something is harvested early in the 
summer — lettuce, say, or peas — you can then free up that space for 
another crop, such as carrots. Succession planting is a good trick, but to 
pull it off, you may need to do some research and be willing to invest some 
time and effort. See Figure 2-2 for a succession planting plan that may work 
for you.

Interplanting
Intercropping, also called interplanting, is really very simple. It means having 
two different plants share the same part of the garden in an alternating or 
checkerboard pattern. This setup can look rather nifty, and it has practical 
advantages too. Smaller, faster-maturing plants can grow with larger, slower-
growing ones, so you always have something to harvest. And plants that 
appreciate a little shade can grow in the shelter of taller ones (grow pole 
beans next to lettuce or spinach, for example). See Figure 2-3 for an example.

Working with the sun: Where 
to plant vegetables
Most fruiting vegetables like the environment sunny and open — the soil is 
warm, and light is plentiful. Examples of sun-loving vegetables include toma-
toes, peppers, squash, beans, okra, eggplant, and corn. If your veggies get the 
sunlight they need, they grow easily, developing and ripening their fruit with 
minimal stress or impediments. If conditions are not ideal, they make less 
fruit and take longer to ripen. They may also lean or grow toward the light 
source in a bid to get as much as they can.

264
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
To maximize needed sun, site your vegetable garden in a south-facing spot; 
plant taller plants to the north end so they don’t cast shade over their 
shorter fellows.
Some vegetables are less dependent on full sun, which can fade or dry 
out their foliage or slow their growth. Some just like cooler temperatures. 
Vegetables that gardeners grow for their leaves fall into this group, as do 
ones with edible roots. Examples include lettuce, mixed greens (mesclun), 
chard, potatoes, carrots, and turnips.
To maximize sheltering shade, grow these vegetables in an east- or west-
facing garden; site taller plants and objects (including trellises, teepees, and 
caged or staked tomatoes) in front of and to the south of these shade-lovers. 
Or grow these plants earlier in spring or in the fall. when the sun is lower 
in the sky — assuming you have enough time to ripen them before winter 
comes, that is.
Making your bed
As much as you may be tempted to toss a packet of seeds into a pile of dirt 
and let the plants grow where they fall, you’re likely to be better off working 
with some kind of system. The following sections provide info on how you 
can design around a natural garden, raised beds, or existing landscaping.
 
More ambitious vegetable gardens need plenty of paths and rows to allow 
access — for you, for a hose, for a wheelbarrow. Ideally, you want access 
from all four sides of a particular bed. Build pathways into your master 
plan when you’re first sketching out the layout (refer to the earlier section 
“Sketching out your plan” for instructions). Then, to clarify where the paths 
are and also to prevent weeds from seizing the open space, “pave” the paths 
with a layer of straw (not hay), dried grass clippings, or gravel.
Natural garden beds
Natural garden beds can be in-ground or mounded up, with no need for 
wooden edges. Either way, work the soil between 8 and 12 inches deep to 
accommodate the roots of most vegetables. To prepare a natural garden bed, 
you need to first remove as many weeds as you can and then rototill the area. 
When new weeds sprout, remove them as soon as possible — while they’re 
young and before they go to seed (and produce more weeds!)

265
 Chapter 2: Vegetables, Glorious Vegetables
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
If you’re turning part of the lawn into a garden, you first need to remove the 
sod. Use a sod knife (a special tool that can be rented) or a spade. For larger 
jobs, you can rent a sod cutter, which is a machine that penetrates the soil 
about three inches deep and cuts off the roots of the sod so that it can then 
be rolled up and removed. Once the sod’s gone, rototill.
 
Don’t try to rototill over the grass. First of all, only larger rototillers are 
capable of doing this, and secondly, if you till in the grass, it will be impossible 
to completely remove the grass and it will constantly re-sprout — a real pain!
Raised garden beds
Using raised garden beds is a very practical way to construct a good vegeta-
ble garden. Raised beds have good drainage, the soil warms up quickly in the 
spring, they’re easy to weed (high off the ground), and you’re less likely to 
step on and compact the soil, enabling roots to grow better (roots like looser, 
well-aerated ground). You can create raised garden beds in two ways:
 
 Building a box and filling it in: You can make bottomless wooden 
boxes between 8 and 12 inches deep; set them in a sunny, flat area; fill 
with good soil; and away you go. You can establish the walls of the box 
using wood, plastic, cinder blocks, or even bales of hay. Just be sure the 
walls are securely in place before adding soil to the interior. You can use 
native soil if its quality is good; otherwise, use a mixture of half native 
soil and half purchased soil.
 
 Building up the earth and boxing it in: You can build up the earth for 
planting, plant your garden, and then put up wood walls to support the 
raised soil, as shown in Figure 2-4. (Construction tip: Brace each corner 
with a corner post for extra stability.) If you use more than one raised 
bed, space them so you can walk between them or bring a wheelbarrow 
down the row.
 
If you’re using wood for the walls of your raised bed, use untreated lumber. 
Treated wood may leach harmful preservatives, which is not a risk you want 
to take when raising edibles. Rot-resistant redwood or cedar is great; other 
softwoods, including pine, tamarack, and cypress, can also do but tend to rot 
away and need replacing after a few years.
 
If tunneling rodents are an issue where you garden, keep them out of your 
raised bed by lining the bottom with a layer of chicken wire. Use a slightly-
too-big piece so you can pull it partway up the sides and tack or staple it in 
place.

Prepping your soil
The biggest mistake beginning vegetable gardeners make is using lousy or 
too-thin soil. Gardening is not rocket science, folks (even if NASA is working 
on growing vegetables in space). Please, before a single vegetable begins 
its potential-filled life in your yard, prepare a good home for it! This prep 
work can save you untold disappointment and, perhaps more than any other 
factor, assure a bountiful and delicious harvest.
If you’re working with a brand-new vegetable garden (or bringing back to life 
one that fell fallow), I suggest you stake it out and get it ready the autumn 
before you plan to plant. This act gives the soil and the things you’ve added 
time to settle and meld. It also means you have less work to do next spring.
If a fall start isn’t possible or practical, go ahead and prepare the ground in 
spring — but don’t start too early. If the ground is still semi-frozen or soggy, 
digging in the soil can compact it and harm its structure. How do you tell 
whether it’s ready to be worked in? Grab a handful and squeeze — it should 
fall apart, not form a mud ball.
Follow these steps when preparing your soil:
 
1. Dig deep — 6 to 8 inches minimum.
 
 Most vegetables are content with 6 to 8 inches of good ground for 
their roots to grow in. If you’re planning to grow substantial root crops 
(potatoes, say, or carrots), go deeper still — up to a foot or more (yes, 
you can use a technique called hilling, where you mound up good soil 
around crops like potatoes, but this method doesn’t excuse your making 
a shallow vegetable garden).
 
2. Fill ’er up with organic matter.
 
 Add lots and lots of organic matter! Try compost (make your own — see 
“Composting for Vegetable Gardens” later on), dehydrated cow manure, 
shredded leaves, well-rotted horse manure (call nearby stables), or a 
mixture thereof. If your yard happens to be blessed with fertile soil, 
adding organic matter is less crucial, but most soils can stand the 
improvement. Mix it 50-50 with the native soil.
 
Whether your area’s soil is notoriously acidic, very sandy, or quite obviously 
lousy for plant growth, adding organic matter can improve whatever you’ve 
got. Just remember to replenish the organic matter at the start of every grow-
ing season or maybe even more often. (If the soil stubbornly resists improve-
ment, resort to setting raised beds atop it and filling these bottomless boxes 
with excellent, organically rich soil.)

268
Book III: Edible Gardening 
Choosing among Seeds, Seedlings, 
and Transplants
Generally, most gardeners buy their vegetables as seed packets or as young 
transplants or container plants. People often purchase plants and seeds in 
the spring from a variety of places, including markets, home stores, and 
nurseries. Racks of veggies sprout up everywhere in the springtime! You’ll 
notice different brands and companies but, quite frankly, not huge differences 
in price.
Whether you choose to grow plants from seed or buy started plants may 
depend on cost, the kind of selection you want, when you want to begin, and 
the type of plant. Read on for the basics of how these beginnings vary. You 
can even combine the options and grow your own transplants from seeds.
Buying seeds
Seed packets are popular because they help save money and provide a 
broader, more interesting selection. When you open a new seed packet, you 
quickly notice an awful lot of little seeds in there! Why so many? For a couple 
reasons: The company wants to make you feel as though you’re getting some-
thing substantial for your money. Plus, you’ll sow more than you’ll actually 
end up growing, because some won’t sprout or will be thinned out later. The 
packet includes enough seeds for successive sowings or to save for next 
year.
 
Little seeds, like lettuce seeds, tend to dry out if stored for a year, whereas 
big seeds like beans can keep for several years.
The packet will give you guidance on when (and where) to start your seeds. 
Certain seeds, for example, should be started indoors, well before the garden 
outside is awake yet. So read the labels to see whether indoor starting or 
direct-sowing (sowing outside, when the soil and weather are warm enough) 
is recommended for the area where you live. (See “Getting Your Veggies into 
Your Garden: Planting and Sowing” for more information.)
Make sure you keep your seeds in a dry, cool (non-freezing) place until you’re 
ready to sow them.
Buying nursery transplants
You can purchase transplants, container plants, or seedlings locally — at 
a garden center, home store, farmers’ market, spring fair, or from roadside 

269
 Chapter 2: Vegetables, Glorious Vegetables
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
entrepreneurs — or from mail-order companies. Someone else has done the 
seed-starting work for you; all you have to do is choose, take ’em home, and 
care for them. Transplants are the way to go if you can’t or don’t want to 
bother with seed-starting, or if you wait till the last minute to decide what 
you’re growing this year. They cost more, but they’re more convenient.
 
If you buy transplants and can’t get them into the ground right away, set 
them in a sheltered spot out of the hot sun and the wind, and water them 
often (small pots dry out alarmingly fast, and young plants can’t tolerate 
neglect).
You can shop for different varieties (buy three different kinds of tomatoes, 
for example), but the selection may not be too exciting, comparatively 
speaking.
Vegetables to buy pre-started include tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. 
Other vegetables, like corn, carrots, and potatoes, don’t transplant well from 
a wee pot to the garden. Direct-sow these plants.
Starting your own seeds indoors
A sure way to banish the winter blues, as well as get a jumpstart on your 
vegetable garden, is to start some seeds indoors early. To find out how early, 
consult the back of the seed packet; you want to time it so you have several-
inch-high seedlings in late spring, after the danger of frost in your area has 
passed.
Here’s a general list to get you started; you can tinker as you get more 
experience raising various sorts of seeds. Yep, get out your calendar — 
some counting backwards is in order:
 
 Onions: Start seedlings 12 to 14 weeks before the safe planting-out day 
(which, in the case of onions, is 4 to 6 weeks before the last frost)
 
 Broccoli, collards, and cabbage: Start seedlings 5 to 6 weeks before the 
safe planting-out date (which is after the danger of snow and ice is past 
but while nights are still chilly)
 
 Lettuce: Start seedlings 5 to 6 weeks before the safe planting-out day 
(which is 4 to 5 weeks before the last frost)
 
 Peppers: Start seedlings 8 to 12 weeks before the last frost
 
 Tomatoes and eggplant: Start seedlings 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost
 
 Cucumbers and melons: Start seedlings 2 to 4 weeks before the last frost
 
If you start too early, your seedlings may be too big too early, making them a 
little hard to accommodate and care for — you may even have to start over.

270
Book III: Edible Gardening 
Getting your seeds started
Once you know when to begin, you’re ready to get your seedlings started. 
Follow these steps, and refer to Figure 2-5:
 
1. Select a good spot.
 
 In milder climates, gardeners can sow seeds early in a cold frame or 
greenhouse, if they have one. Everyone else has to make do indoors. 
The best spot is an area out of the path of household traffic. You don’t 
want people bumping into your tender sprouts or curious pets coming 
around. The spot should also be warm and out of drafts. A basement, 
sun porch, or spare room are all good options. Some people even raise 
seeds on the tops of dressers, cabinets, or refrigerators!
 
2. Provide light.
 
 Some seeds germinate under a thin layer of soil mix and some are 
pressed lightly on top, but in all cases, the seedlings that sprout need 
between 12 and 16 hours of light per day — that’s a lot.
 
 Sunlight from a window is not at all ideal. It’s pale and limited in late 
winter and early spring. To make your seedlings grow, you need artificial 
light. Fluorescent is best, and a timer at the outlet can help you regulate 
the hours it shines on your baby plants. Figure 2-6 shows a good light 
setup.
 
3. Prepare pots or flats (which need drainage holes).
 
 Begin with sterile seed-starting mix. (This mix is available in bags wher-
ever gardening supplies are sold. It looks like very fine potting mix.) Fill 
the containers about three-quarters full with dampened, not drenched, 
mix (Figure 2-5a). Tamp the surface flat and level with the flat of your 
hand or a small piece of wood before sowing.
 
4. Sow the seeds.
 
 The back of the seed packet can tell you how deep to sow the seeds and 
whether you should cover them with mix. The packet can also tell you 
how far apart to place the seeds. Sow carefully by hand — a pencil tip is 
a useful tool when placing small seeds (Figure 2-5b).
 
 Don’t sow too many seeds! Overplanting can lead to a forest of seed-
lings, growing too thickly for you to thin them without damaging some.
 
 If you’re sowing into a flat, make little furrows with the pencil tip or a 
finger and space the seeds up to an inch apart (Figure 2-5c).
 
5. Cover the container with plastic.
 
 Cover the container the very day you plant. Plastic wrap is great, but 
depending on the size of your starting containers, you can also use a 
plastic bag (Figure 2-5d). This covering holds in warmth and humidity, 
giving the seeds the best chance to absorb moisture and get going. Don’t 
seal too tightly, though. A tight seal causes condensed water to drip 
back down into the mix, making things too soggy.

271
 Chapter 2: Vegetables, Glorious Vegetables
Book III

Gardening
 
6. Check back daily to add water and let the plants breathe.
 
 Don’t let the planting mix dry out, or the seeds’ growth will come to a 
halt. The best way to keep developing seedlings evenly, consistently 
moist is with bottom watering. Just set the container into a few inches of 
water (in the sink or a tray) and let it wick up the water it needs before 
returning the container to its spot. Also be sure to open the bag a couple 
hours every few days to let the soil breathe some fresh air. Then close it 
back up.

Book III: Edible Gardening 
Taking care of the seedlings when they sprout
The first little seeds usually take a week or two to poke up their heads. But 
what a thrill! Here’s what to do now to ensure that they survive and thrive:
 
 Snip away extras. Use tiny scissors (fingernail or beard-clipping ones 
work well) to gently cut weaker seedlings away at soil level. Pulling, 
rather than cutting off, can damage the roots of the surrounding seed-
lings. The properly spaced survivors gain better air circulation, which is 
important for their health, and their developing roots don’t have to com-
pete for precious resources.
 
 Water from above with a fine spray. As the seedlings grow bigger, 
bottom watering may no longer be practical.
 
 Shift the flat’s plastic covering on and off for ventilation. When the 
young plants become too tall, remove the plastic covering completely.
 
 Start fertilizing. A diluted, half-strength flowering-houseplant fertilizer 
delivered with a regular watering is just fine. Fertilize about every two 
weeks.
 
 Check that the seedlings are well-rooted when they’re several inches 
high. Never tug on the stem! Gently tug on the true leaves (not the first, 
or cotyledon, leaves that come up). If the seedlings hang on and other-
wise look husky, they’re ready to get hardened off (see the next section).
Hardening off your seedlings
The hardening-off process is the interim step between life in a pot (or seedling 
container) and life in the ground. Its purpose is to ease the seedlings from 
their plush life indoors to the realities of life in the real world — outdoors in 
your garden.
To harden off your seedlings, take these measures (the process takes about 
two weeks):
 
 After the threat of frost has passed, move your seedlings outside to a 
place that’s sheltered from sun and wind. Start with an hour a day, and 
gradually work up to 24 hours over a two-week period. (Bring the seed-
lings indoors or cover them on chilly nights or if frost threatens.)
 
 Stop fertilizing them.
 
You need to harden off any plant that you’re transplanting, whether it’s one 
you started or bought at a nursery. If you bought your transplants from 
somewhere else, you may be able to shorten the hardening-off time by asking 
the seller whether the plants have been hardened off. (If they were displayed 
for sale outdoors, you can pretty well assume that they were.)
Once your seedling has been hardened off, it’s ready to be planted in your 
garden. Head to the next section.

Getting Your Veggies into Your 
Garden: Planting and Sowing
How you plant vegetables really depends on the form in which you’ve 
acquired them. Are you direct-sowing seeds? Or are you planting transplants 
that you’ve either purchased or grown on your own indoors? The following 
sections tell you what to do in either case.
 
Before you put anything in the ground, make sure you know when your grow-
ing season begins as well as whether your veggies are cool-season or warm-
season (see the earlier section “Factoring in growing season and days to 
maturity”). Cool-season vegetables are more tolerant of cooler temperatures 
(some can even go outdoors before the last frost), so you can start these and 
put them in the ground earlier. Warm-season vegetables, however, should be 
put out or sown only after all danger of frost is past.
Planting transplants and seedlings
You can plant your seedlings and transplants after they’ve been hardened 
off (refer to the earlier section “Hardening off your seedlings”) and the soil 
is ready and sufficiently warmed up. When all of these conditions are met, 
you’re ready to go.
Ideally, work on an overcast day (or plant late in the day), when the hot sun 
won’t stress them or you. Here’s what to do:
 
1. Water the seedlings well the morning you plan to plant.
 
2. Dig individual holes.
 
 Make the holes at least as deep and wide as the pot the seedling comes 
in. How far apart to dig depends on the plant. The tag that came with 
the seedling or the seed packet should have this information, but when 
in doubt, allow more elbow room rather than less. Seedlings may look 
puny, but if you give them a good home, they’ll soon take off like gang-
busters.
 
3. Pop each plant out of its pot carefully, handling the seedlings by 
gently gripping the leaves.
 
 Tease apart the roots on the sides and bottom so they’ll be more 
inclined to enter the surrounding soil in their new home. Place the roots 
gently in their hole and tamp the soil in around them firmly to eliminate 
air pockets.

274
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
 You can plant tomato seedlings deeper than they were growing in their 
pots. In other words, you can bury much of the stem with no harm done; 
just keep one or two sets of leaves above ground and gently remove the 
lower ones. Not only does this planting depth lead to better stability in 
the hole, but the stem also responds by making more roots along the 
buried part.
 
4. Water; then mulch.
 
 Gently soak each seedling, using a wand attachment on your hose or a 
watering can. Then lay down an inch or two of mulch an inch out from 
the base of each seedling and outward to conserve soil moisture as well 
as to thwart sprouting weeds. Don’t let the mulch touch the stem, or you 
risk insect and pest problems later on.
 
Offer a little protection. Sudden exposure to sun and wind can stress out little 
plants. Get them through the first few days by setting some boxes or boards 
nearby to create a barrier — or set a few lawn chairs out in the garden over 
the seedlings. It helps.
Sowing seeds directly
Gardeners generally sow seeds directly in the garden after the last frost, 
when the soil has warmed up and the weather seems to have settled into an 
early-summer groove. Vegetables that you can direct-sow include lettuce, 
onions, peas, radishes, turnips, beets, cabbage, carrots, beans, corn, pars-
nips, cucumbers, lettuce, and tomatoes (in warm climates).
 
Don’t sow seeds too early! Direct-sowing in cold and/or soggy soil is a bad 
idea — it’s muddy work for you, and the seeds usually sprout poorly or rot; 
then you have to start over. Best to wait for the right time.
Assuming that the garden area is prepared and ready to go, head outdoors 
one fine day with seed packets, a trowel, a planting dibble or hoe (depend-
ing on the size of the project), and something to sit on. Be prepared to get a 
bit dirty and sweaty and to feel the warm sun beam down on your head and 
shoulders as you work. Don’t rush — putting seeds in this good Earth is a 
wonderful, soothing, productive feeling!
Follow these steps:
 
1. Make planting holes or furrows.
 
 Recommended planting distances are noted on the seed packets.
 
2. Follow the “three friends” rule — plant three seeds per hole.

275
 Chapter 2: Vegetables, Glorious Vegetables
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
 
 At least one will likely sprout well. If all three do, you can thin out two of 
them later to favor the most robust one.
 
3. Cover each hole as you go, tamping down the soil to eliminate air 
pockets.
 
4. Label.
 
 The now-empty seed packet, stapled to a small stick, is a long-time label-
ing favorite, but you can simply use a marker to write the name of the 
vegetable (and variety if you’re growing more than one of the same kind) 
as well as the date on a stick and plunge it in at the head of the row.
 
5. Water well with a soft spray so you don’t dislodge the seeds.
 
 A wand hose attachment is good, as is a watering can with a rose head. If 
your vegetable garden is fairly big, use a sprinkler.
 
6. Mulch.
 
 Lay down an inch or two of mulch after watering the entire bed; keep the 
mulch an inch away from your new planting so that the seeds don’t have 
to try to get through the barrier. Mulching conserves soil moisture and 
discourages sprouting weeds.
Caring for Your Growing Veggie Garden
Your job isn’t done after you plant or sow your seeds. A growing garden 
needs quite a bit of tender, loving — and ongoing — care. Your prime duties 
now are to make sure that your vegetables are properly fed, have the neces-
sary support, and are protected from pests. Sounds a lot like raising a teen, 
without the attitude or drama.
For more detailed information on how to keep your garden healthy, turn to 
Chapter 5.
Watering your vegetable plants
In general, most vegetables use about 1 inch of water per week (1 to 2 inches 
in hot, dry climates). If you don’t get water from rainfall, you have to supply 
it. With that info in mind, be aware that each vegetable has a critical period 
when you need to be especially careful about watering or your crop may be 
ruined. Table 2-2 shows the important watering periods for different types of 
vegetables.

Fertilizing your vegetable garden
Fertilizer is anything, organic or inorganic, that provides nutrients for 
growing vegetable plants. If your vegetable garden has fertile soil enhanced 
by compost and other organic materials, fertilizing may not be urgently 
necessary. Still, vegetables are a hungry group, and feeding them can 
certainly speed growth and improve your harvest.
The main nutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). 
They offer the following benefits:
 
 Nitrogen: Enhances the growth of leaves and stems
 
 Phosphorus: Helps flower, fruit, seed, and root production
 
 Potassium: Ensures general vigor and increases your plants’ resistance 
to disease

277
 Chapter 2: Vegetables, Glorious Vegetables
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
The three numbers that appear on the labels of general-purpose fertilizers 
represent these three main nutrients. A fertilizer such as 10-10-10 is a balanced 
fertilizer because it contains equal proportions of all three nutrients, whereas 
a 15-0-0 is obviously nitrogen-heavy. For most vegetable crops, your best bet 
is a balanced fertilizer.
Other elements are necessary for plant growth in addition to the big three, 
but plants need them in much smaller amounts, and they’re often already 
present in the soil. Also, many commercial fertilizers include them.
There are three different ways to fertilize your crops:
 
 Side-dressing: This term means sprinkling some fertilizer beside the 
plant, rather than on the plant itself, or scratching dry fertilizer into the 
soil with your fingers or a trowel or fork. See Figure 2-7.
 
 Dry fertilizer that remains dry never does any plant any good. Dampen 
the garden before and after fertilizing so the fertilizer can get into the 
soil and down to the roots, where it’s needed.
 
 Foliar feeding: You add foliar fertilizer to water (diluted according to 
label directions, of course) and then spray it right onto the leaves — the 
plant foliage.
 
 Liquid fertilizers are concentrated, so you have to dilute them with 
water according to label directions; you’re allowed to do two half-
strength doses rather than one full-strength, if you like.
 
 Top-dressing: Top-dressing is applying fertilizer over the surface of the 
garden.
 
Figure 2-7: 
Side-
dressing 
fertilizers.
 

278
Book III: Edible Gardening 
Always follow label directions regarding how much fertilizer to apply. Too 
much is not good — you can overdose or burn your plants. Good timing is 
also important. Usually, you’re advised to feed the plants at planting time 
to get them off to an early and vigorous start. A second, midseason applica-
tion is worthwhile if you’re growing a succession of crops in the same row or 
intercropping (see “Sketching out your plan,” earlier in this chapter, for info 
on these growing methods).
Using frames and supports for veggies
Oh, those little seedlings — how fast and tall some of them grow! Midway 
through the summer, they’re big; by August, they’re out of control. You 
compromise the health as well as the manageability of certain crops, not to 
mention their productivity, if you don’t step in with some kind of support. 
(Support is also important if your vegetable garden is out in the open and is 
occasionally subject to blustery winds.) Vegetables that need or benefit from 
support include peas, pole beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, small squash and 
zucchini, mini pumpkins, and melons.
Add support well before the plant becomes unwieldy. The time to get started 
is when a plant is a few inches high. You can position the support much 
more easily then, and, more importantly, when you plunge a support into the 
ground near a seedling, you don’t harm it or its root system. Procrastinate, 
and you may.
Your support options include:
 
 A wooden, metal, or plastic stake: Plunge this support deep (a foot or 
more) into the ground near the plant so the support will be stable when 
it’s weighted down with foliage and fruit. Site the stake near the main 
stem (not right on top of it! — a few inches away) and secure the plant 
loosely with soft ties as it grows; as the plant fills out, it’ll eventually 
hide these ties from view.
 
 A trellis: Don’t use the sort of trellis you train a climbing rose or clema-
tis on but rather something broader and less decorative, something with 
plentiful horizontal wires or slats for tying onto.
 
 A teepee: A teepee is a good choice for climbing plants that can get 
rather tall, such as pole beans or miniature pumpkins and squash. You 
can buy a wooden, plastic, or metal teepee, or rig one out of branches 
and twigs pruned from your yard.
 
 The fence: A climber or tall-growing veggie can lean on the fence if you 
site the plant nearby, but you may have to help guide it and anchor it 
with string and/or the occasional tie.

279
 Chapter 2: Vegetables, Glorious Vegetables
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
 
 Cages: Wire cages are sold specifically for supporting tomatoes, but 
they’re useful for other vegetable crops as well, such as sugar-snap 
peas, cucumbers, and smaller melons. Get the tallest cages you can 
or put one atop another, because many tomatoes easily grow 6 feet or 
taller, easily toppling shorter cages. See Figure 2-8.
 
To secure the veggies to the support, don’t use material that abrades or 
cuts into a plant, such as wire or twist ties. Instead, use something soft, like 
lengths of cloth (rip up old T-shirts or pillowcases) or plastic tape. Also, 
when you tie, loop one end around the support first, and then pull the tie 
over to the plant and make a loop there as well — like a figure eight (see 
Figure 2-9). Do this tying loosely. This way, the plant won’t be harmed, and it 
can also move a bit, safely, in a breeze.
Adding covers
Row covers (see Figure 2-10) are usually made of plastic or spun synthetic 
fabric. They serve as miniature greenhouses. They hold in heat, protect the 
plants against wind, and, in some cases, shade the plants and reduce their 
exposure to insects.

Dealing with vegetable pests
If you build it, they will come, sorry to say. Because you’re growing edible 
plants, you should be very reluctant to throw chemical remedies at pest 

281
 Chapter 2: Vegetables, Glorious Vegetables

problems in your vegetable garden. Fortunately, you can choose from plenty 
of proactive, less-risky strategies and deterrents.
Of course, as with so much of gardening, a plot with good soil, ample fertil-
izer and water, and elbow room for good air circulation resists such prob-
lems better than an unkempt or crowded one. Also, always
 
 Select disease-resistant varieties.
 
 Clean up garden debris promptly.
 
 Keep after and yank out all weeds, which harbor and feed various pests.
 
 Rotate crops.
If you find that your crop is under attack, figure out who or what the cul-
prit is. Watch at odd hours, such as in the morning or evening, set a trap, 
or creep in close to the affected plants and look under leaves and in nodes 
(where leaf stalks meet the stem). Telltale signs of an invader include nibbled 
leaves and collapsing stems — here again, a little poking around should 
reveal the culprit. If it’s an icky bug, capture a few, stick ’em in a small plastic 
storage bag, and show them to someone who can help you identify them. If 
you can’t find the pest, a sample of typical damage should help your expert 
identify the culprit.
Fungal diseases
If you’re battling a fungal disease, you can try using a garden duster (shown 
in Figure 2-11) to apply a very fine coat of powdered fungicide to the surfaces 
of leaves. This is most effective when done early in the morning — there’s no 
breeze, and the leaves have dew on them so the dust adheres better to the 
plants.
Keep in mind, though, that there’s not much that home gardeners can safely 
do if the vegetables have fungal disease. If disease is suspected, your best bet 
is to uproot the plant and discard it in the trash, not the compost pile.
Rodents, rabbits, and other miscreants
Mice, shrews, moles, voles, gophers, and other little rodents often burrow in 
mulch, either to nest or to root around for seeds to eat. Replace the mulch 
with gravel. Or reduce it, or at least scrape it away from the bases of your 
plants. A cage or barrier of chicken wire or poultry netting under or around 
the perimeter of the garden can also discourage the rodents, provided the 
holes are too small for them to squeeze through. You can also try trap-
ping them or flooding their holes/tunnels with the hose. A cat that’s a good 
mouser is the best bet.

Rabbits, woodchucks, raccoons? These brazen marauders may make you 
homicidal enough to reach for a gun, hand grenade, or poison-baited trap, 
but you can choose from some less drastic (and more humane) tacks. The 
best defense, quite honestly, is a good garden fence (include a gate, of 
course, so you can get in and out). Select one that’s tall enough to discourage 
climbing over, but also sink it several inches into the ground to discourage 
digging under. Other remedies that are said to work include hot sauce, com-
mercial repellents, bags of human hair (collected from a salon), a noisy radio, 
water-gun repellents, and leaving an alert dog nearby.
Deer
First of all, let’s be completely frank here: Gardening in deer country is a 
challenge. The combined effects of fewer natural predators and shrinking 
habitats mean that the deer population is exploding while its natural food 
supplies are falling. And when deer are hungry, they’ll eat almost anything, 
including the contents of your vegetable garden.
The best defense is a good garden fence. But because deer are good leapers, 
it needs to be quite tall — 8 feet or so. A lower fence may work if you set it at 
a 45-degree angle or even lay it on the ground on the theory that deer don’t 
like to get their hooves snagged. For extra insurance or if the deer are really 
hungry and persistent, you need an electric fence (hardware, home, and 
farm-supply stores sell this) or a double fence — two 10-foot fences, 6 feet 
apart.

Birds
Birds are mainly a threat to newly planted seeds and ripening fruit (espe-
cially berries — see Chapter 4). Cover the seeds with soil and/or netting to 
discourage them; cover plants with netting until the fruit is ripe and you’re 
able to pick the harvest.
Bugs
Identifying the invading insect is key. Capture a few and show them to some-
one who knows (a garden-center staffer; a landscaper; or another, more 
experienced vegetable gardener) or look the bugs up. If you can’t find the bug 
itself, take in the damaged part of the plant. Once you know what you’re deal-
ing with, you can devise a plan of attack.
 
 Aphids: These tiny insects are usually green but may be red, brown, 
gray, or black. They stunt and distort plant growth and spread disease.
 
• Favorite targets: Broccoli, cauliflower, kale, cabbage, and Brussels 
sprouts.
 
• First control: Knock them off with a stiff blast from the hose.
 
 Beetles: Identification is important because some beetles are perfectly 
harmless. The main vegetable-garden villains are cucumber beetles, 
Colorado potato beetles, and little flea beetles.
 
• Favorite targets: Cucumbers, squash, pumpkins, melons, and 
potatoes (aboveground growth).
 
• First control: Either hand-pick them off or use row covers or other 
physical barriers to keep them away from their favorite plants.
 
 “Worms” (moth larvae): Cabbage loopers and corn earworms are the 
worst vegetable-garden pests.
 
• Favorite targets: The fruit of cabbage-family crops, corn ears, and 
ripening tomatoes.
 
• First control: Protect your plants with row covers. And because the 
worms can overwinter in garden soil, turn over the soil in late fall to 
expose them to freezing temperatures. Also, rotate your crops.
 
 Caterpillars: Not all caterpillars are harmful, so be careful when 
identifying them.
 
• Favorite targets: The leaves of any vegetable plant.
 
• First control: Hand-pick them off.
 
 Cutworms: These little larval fellows relish young seedlings, which they 
neatly chop off at the soil line.
 
• Favorite targets: Beans, corn, peppers, tomatoes, and cabbage.

284
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
• First control: Because they don’t like to climb, a collar around the 
vulnerable plant should keep them out (make it from a can or stiff 
cardboard).
 
 Leaf miners: Tiny insect larvae that travel within leaf tissue, leaving 
meandering trails and weakening the plant, thereby reducing its harvest.
 
• Favorite targets: Cucumbers, peppers, squash, melons, and 
tomatoes.
 
• First control: Pick off and dispose of affected leaves.
 
 Leafhoppers: Very small flying pests that pierce and suck the life out of 
plant parts, especially foliage (though they love bean blossoms).
 
• Favorite targets: Beans, lettuce, potatoes, tomatoes, and squash.
 
• First control: A collar of aluminum foil around the base of a plant 
can deter them.
 
 Root maggots: These critters are most active in spring as little egg-laying 
flies.
 
• Favorite targets: Cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, 
kale, radishes, and onions.
 
• First control: Sprinkle coffee grounds or fireplace (wood) ashes 
around vulnerable plants. Fine-mesh screen cages may also deter 
these maggots.
 
 Snails and slugs: Crowded, damp conditions prove irresistible to these 
slimy nibblers. They’re most active at night.
 
• Favorite targets: Any vegetable plant!
 
• First control: Erect copper barriers around vulnerable plants 
(these give them an unpleasant “electric shock”), trap them with 
pie tins of beer, or spread diatomaceous earth on the ground 
(it feels like flour but is full of sharp particles that irritate their 
skin). Cocoa hull mulch deters them, whereas some bark or wood 
mulches have pieces that are large enough for these slimy critters 
to sleep under during the day. Put out a single board in the garden, 
and the snails and slugs will use it for shelter during the day. Lift it 
up and scrape them off.
Notice that I’m not rushing to recommend spraying chemicals in a vegetable 
garden. Try other tactics first (some suggestions are outlined in the preced-
ing list) and spray with pesticides only as a last resort. Examples of sprays 
that you can use include insecticidal soap, neem oil, horticultural oils, and 
garlic or pepper spray.
 
If you do use a pesticide, be sure to get the right product for the targeted 
pest (most sprays are most effective when used in the early stages of a pest’s 
development), follow the directions on the label to the letter, and thoroughly 
wash your harvest before eating or cooking.

Composting for Vegetable Gardens
Perhaps you’ve been wondering why so many vegetable gardeners have com-
post piles. The short answer is that it’s downright sensible. Compost is a boun-
tiful and free source of organic matter, which vegetables adore and consume 
like crazy. Compost adds humus to your garden and acts as a natural, slow-
release fertilizer. Plus, composting lets you feel virtuous and efficient because 
you’re not sending perfectly useful materials away with the household garbage.
Although you can buy compost from a gardening center, a better solution is 
to make your own. It’s less expensive (even though bag for bag, store-bought 
compost may not strike you as terribly expensive, it really starts to add up 
when you’re caring for a vegetable garden), and it’s easy.
Following is the short course on creating compost for your vegetable garden; 
if you need mountains of compost or get really into composting, you can try 
some more-sophisticated methods and rigs:
 
1. Pick a good spot — one that’s level and sunny.
 
 The location should be level and out of the way of foot traffic but not far 
from your vegetable garden. A sunny spot is better than a shady one, 
because warm sunshine helps the pile warm up so the contents break 
down faster.
 
2. Erect a square or circular cage (at least 3 feet x 3 feet) on the spot 
you’ve chosen.
 
 A 3-x-3-foot cage is the minimum size you need to be effective. You can 
buy commercially available bins of tough black plastic with a lid on top 
and a hatch in the bottom (“Darth Vader” bins), or you can make your 
own out of chicken wire, concrete blocks, wooden pallets, lumber, or 
even piled-up hay bales.
 
3. Create a base in the bottom of your compost bin.
 
 Set or scoop in a layer (several inches to a foot thick) of thin branches, 
chopped-up corn stalks, or something along those lines.
 
4. Add material to compost (grass clippings, wood bark, and so on), 
arranging it in layers and adding water if necessary.
 
 A proper compost pile, if viewed in cutaway, resembles a layer cake. 
Each layer should be a few inches thick. Alternate green (grass clippings, 
young pulled weeds) and brown (ground dried leaves, shredded bark) 
layers. See Table 2-3 for lists of acceptable and unacceptable composting 
materials.
 
 If you’re adding dry material, soak the pile with the hose or a watering 
can right after adding the material to moisten it.

286
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
5. Check on your pile and turn it every few days or whenever you add 
more material.
 
 A good mix heats up to between 100 and 120 degrees — on warm 
summer days, you may see the pile steaming. Turn it (with a stick, 
shovel, or pitchfork, whatever works) to keep it working. Your compost 
is ready to use when it fails to heat up again after turning.
 
 If your compost pile seems to be breaking down too slowly, you can add 
these jumpstart materials in moderation to boost things a bit: 
commercially available compost booster (beneficial microorganisms), 
bloodmeal, bonemeal, cottonseed meal, or dried manure (from vegetarian 
animals only).
Table 2-3 
Do’s and Don’ts for Vegetable Garden Compost
Include These Things
Leave These Things Out
Coffee grounds and tea leaves (even 
tea bags; just remove the staple)
Big chunks of yard debris
Crushed eggshells
Plants that are diseased or full of insect 
pests
Corncobs (chop or grind them up first)
Weeds
Vegetable and fruit peelings and 
leftovers
Plant debris that has been treated with 
weed killer or pesticides
Shredded leaves
Any meat product (bones, grease, and 
fat included)
Shredded newspaper (just the 
black-and-white pages)
Fruit pits and seeds (they don’t break 
down well and attract rodents)
Straw (not hay — it contains weed 
seeds)
Cat, dog, or other pet waste (which may 
contain meat products or parasites)
Prunings from your yard (chopped 
small)
Lawn clippings
 
Veggie plants soak up the materials that come out of the compost. When in 
doubt as to what should and shouldn’t go into your compost pile for your 
vegetable garden, follow this general guideline: If you wouldn’t put it or part 
of it in your mouth, then don’t put it on your compost pile! This rule isn’t 
foolproof, but it can definitely give you peace of mind.

 Knowing when, where, and how to plant herbs
 Giving your herbs the care they need
I
f you suspect that the definition of herb is a bit loose, you’re right. It 
includes not only rosemary but also nasturtiums, and fast-growing 
annuals as well as long-lived perennials. Defining an herb is easier said than 
done, but the important thing to keep in mind is that herbs are plants that 
not only have ornamental merits but are also useful in some way. Gardeners 
grow many herbs for their foliage, which is often deliciously scented; others 
value herbs for their edible flowers, seeds, or roots. A lot of herbs are a 
boon in the kitchen, adding exciting new dimensions to all sorts of recipes. 
Still others are reputed to have healthful or healing properties (Book VI 
details the many ways you can use the medicinal quality of herbs).
Even with that broad definition, the majority of herbs have common grow-
ing conditions and harvesting techniques. Herbs are usually very easy to 
find — look for them where you buy your annuals and perennials. Or perhaps 
you have some friends, relatives, or neighbors who won’t mind you taking 
some herbs from their yards and planting them in your own. And here’s some 
really good news: Herbs are among the easiest and most rewarding of all 
plants to raise. This chapter fills you in on what you need to know to grow 
and care for herbs.
Planting Herbs: A Lesson in Adaptation
No hard and fast rules govern the planting of herbs. Herbs are wonderfully 
versatile and flexible, and they come in a huge variety of annual and peren-
nial types of plants.

288
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
The main thing to do is to pay attention to the type of herb you’re trying to 
plant: Is it an annual? A perennial? Fast-growing? Slow-growing? Is it an inva-
sive plant, like mint, or does it get along well with other plants? These consid-
erations are important before you start adding herbs to your garden — and 
probably even before you acquire the herbs themselves! Do your research 
beforehand: To find out more about the growing habits of certain herbs, ask 
your gardening friends or the staff at the local nursery.
Getting the timing right
When you plant your herbs really depends on the plant, but you can’t go 
wrong planting herbs the same way you plant vegetable seedlings: Plant them 
in the garden after all danger of frost is past (see Book III, Chapter 2 for info 
on vegetable gardening). The reason this strategy works for most herbs is 
that a lot of them aren’t especially tolerant of the cold. This technique also 
gets them in the ground under encouraging conditions — warm soil, warm 
air, and a good summer stretching out ahead of them. They should surge 
right into robust growth.
Obviously, if your climate is fairly mild (as in the South and Southwest, the 
Gulf Coast, and most of California), you can plant herbs earlier in the year 
than, say, someone in New England or the upper Midwest, who’s better off 
waiting until Memorial Day or so.
 
Avoid planting herbs — even if you spot plants for sale somewhere at a bar-
gain price — in the heat of summer. Planting then stresses out even dryland 
natives such as oregano and lavender. And, obviously, don’t put out herbs 
just as a cold winter is coming on. If you want to enjoy some herbs during the 
winter months, you’re better off growing them in pots that you bring indoors 
to a sunny windowsill. See the upcoming section titled “Potting your herbs.”
Determining the best place to plant
When you’re deciding where to plant your herbs, just remember that most 
herbs like plentiful sunshine and appreciate well-drained ground (as opposed 
to very dry or very soggy sites). Read on for your placement options.
Inviting herbs into your current garden
If you’re considering planting your herbs in a preexisting garden, here are 
two options:

289
 Chapter 3: Spicing Things Up with Herbs
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
 
 Herbs growing by vegetables: Adding edible herbs to your vegetable 
garden is a good idea. They like the same growing conditions of fer-
tile soil and full sun, and when you’re in the mood for a spontaneous 
summer meal, everything you need is right at hand. Some of popular 
choices include basil, dill, parsley, cilantro, fennel, thyme, and chives.
 
 Herbs mingling with flowers: This type of planting works best for herbs 
with pretty flowers of their own, as well as ones that can contribute 
attractive foliage. Imagine not just how pretty the flower bed will be 
but also the intriguing homegrown bouquets you can assemble if you 
widen your palette to include some herbs. Favorite choices include sage 
(especially the kinds with colorful leaves), dill, mint, basil (especially the 
purple-leaved kind), artemisia, and borage.
Creating an herb garden
For many gardeners, the best solution for growing herbs is just to put them 
all in their own garden. Follow these simple rules:
 
 Place taller herbs at the back or in the middle of a bed, with shorter 
ones at their feet. This type of arrangement lets you see, appreciate, 
and access everything for care and harvesting.
 
 Allow every plant ample room to spread. If some herbs emerge as 
thugs over time, stealing the stage from less aggressive growers, just 
chop them back or take them out of the display altogether. (Check for 
square stems on plants — these can indicate that you’re dealing with 
thugs.)
 
 Herbs that are meant to be alone are tall or tend to hog horizontal 
space. They also monopolize resources of soil nutrients and water, or 
have a tendency to grow rampantly. If you really want them, why not 
just segregate them in their own area, bed, or pot (as explained in the 
next section)? Plants that do better solo include mint, oregano, and 
marjoram.
You can choose from many types of herb gardens, but generally they’re 
either formal or informal. You’d be wise to plan a formal garden ahead on 
paper, making a geometric design that’s to your liking, whether it’s composed 
of squares or composed to look like slices of a pie. Then, when you decide to 
put your plan into action, install the edgings and pathways first, using bricks, 
rocks, gravel, or even grass. Edging plants such as small boxwood plants, 
germander, or a sheared low hedge of lavender or dusty miller also work but 
require more care.

290
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
If you prefer informal herb gardens, take note: A casual bed devoted to all 
herbs can have the delightful look of a cottage garden, or it can look like a 
jumble. A jumble is bad. It’s hard to care for and harvest from, and crowded 
plants become more vulnerable to pests and diseases. So make a plan on 
paper for this sort of herb garden too — set it up like your vegetable garden 
or your favorite flower garden — and then see what happens, making altera-
tions as you see fit. Aim for a harmonious mix of foliage colors and types, 
with the occasional exclamation point of a flowering herb.
Potting your herbs
A lot of people like to grow herbs in pots, an approach that contains their 
growth and makes them handy for cooking. Container gardening is also a 
terrific way to raise edible herbs that you use often in your kitchen. And it’s 
a great way to corral invasive herbs (like mint, lemon balm, and lemon ver-
bena) and keep them from wandering and taking over.
 
The most important thing to do for potted herbs is keep them watered; 
potted plants dry out notoriously fast, and cycles of soaking and drying 
out aren’t good for a plant’s health, even a tough little herb plant. Note: 
The Mediterranean herbs — such as thyme, rosemary, lavender, sage, and 
oregano — prefer poor, almost sandy soil; they’ll rot if they get too wet. Use a 
sand or pebble mulch around them.
Site potted herbs where you won’t forget about them, such as right outside 
the back door or on the patio in full sight of the kitchen window. A window 
box is a particularly effective and practical way to grow herbs in a container.
Mixed displays can look great. Fill larger pots with several different herbs or 
assemble a gathering of individual pots and array them on a deck or patio. 
You can even tuck a potted herb into your garden proper as an accent, 
shifting it around as you see fit. If color or interest seems to be lacking, just 
choose especially decorative or colorful pots — they make a dramatic differ-
ence and add to the fun.
 
Frequently harvesting potted herbs has an important benefit, by the way. 
When you snip off the tips, the remaining plant is inspired to grow more 
thickly and compactly — which looks better in a pot.
Putting herbs in their place: How to plant
Planting herbs is as easy as 1-2-3 and really isn’t much different from planting 
flowers or vegetables.

291
 Chapter 3: Spicing Things Up with Herbs
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
 
Make sure you water your herbs thoroughly on planting day. Then water 
the plants often in the following days and weeks until they become well-
established. Well-established herbs may be fairly tolerant of droughts, but 
that doesn’t excuse you from getting them off to a good start while they’re 
young.
Planting herbs in a garden
When planting a new herb in a garden, just follow these basic steps:
 
1. Using a trowel, dig a hole in a sunny spot with well-drained soil.
 
 The hole should be slightly deeper and wider than the pot the herb 
is currently in. Add a little compost or other organic material to the 
bottom of the hole for the roots to grow into. Then scrape the sides of 
the hole to loosen the roots, which encourages the herb’s root system 
to grow beyond its current size.
 
2. Pop the plant out of its pot.
 
 If tugging is necessary, handle the plant by its stem, never by its leaves. 
Using your fingers, gently tease the roots on the bottom loose and 
loosen some on the sides as well.
 
3. Plant the herb at the same depth it was growing in the pot (if you’re 
not sure, look closely on the stem for a soil line).
 
 Backfill soil in and around the hole and firm everything into place with 
your hands to eliminate air pockets. Soak thoroughly.
 
When choosing a planting spot, be sure to take into account your herb’s 
expected mature size. You don’t want it to be crowded or cramped because 
then it won’t be as healthy or productive.
Planting herbs in a container
Planting herbs in a container is a bit different from planting in a garden. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. First, choose an ample-sized pot and be sure it has a drainage hole in 
the bottom.
 
 Most herbs can’t tolerate wet feet.
 
2. Fill the pot with damp potting soil mix.
 
 Moistening the mix ahead of time makes the job soooo much easier!
 
3. Pop the herb seedling out of the pot you bought it in, place it in its 
new pot, and water it.

292
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
Containers, particularly clay pots, tend to dry out quickly, especially when 
placed in the sunny spots that herbs like. Although many herbs are tough 
customers and can tolerate drought, subjecting them to extreme cycles of 
drought and drenching causes stress.
Raising herbs from seed
The majority of herbs are easy to grow from seed. Also, some types of 
herbs — interesting, offbeat, or rare varieties — are often for sale only in 
seed form. Here’s the good news: Unlike some flower and vegetable seeds, 
you don’t have a long wait from sowing to productive plant.
To plant your herb seeds, follow these steps:
 
1. Place sterile soil mix into the flat or pot in which you plan to keep the 
herb(s).
 
 Be sure the flat or pot contains drainage holes to prevent the possibility 
of rot.
 
2. Sow the seeds on top of the mix or under a thin layer of mix, which-
ever the seed packet recommends.
 
 The packet should also advise you how far apart to sow the seeds.
 
 The biggest mistake beginning herb gardeners make when sowing seeds 
is sowing too thickly. Many herb seeds are quite small, and seed compa-
nies give you much more than you need in a single packet (for example, 
a typical packet of basil seeds can have 250 individual seeds in it!). Don’t 
use them all at once.
 
3. Care for the seeds for a few weeks, or until the seedlings are several 
inches high and ready to be transplanted.
 
 During this period, you’ll need to make sure they get the proper light 
(the seed packet has details). Water them and thin the plants, especially 
if you sowed the seeds too thickly and now have a forest of small plants.
 
• To water: Bottom watering is advisable. Simply place the container 
in a tub or sink and gradually add warm water (which penetrates 
the soil quicker than cold water) until it reaches a depth of about 
half the height of the container in which the seeds are sown. Let 
the container sit in this warm water until the surface of the soil in 
the container is wet (look for a darker color). You may have to wait 
an hour or so. Then either remove the seed container from the tub 
or let the water out of the sink and allow the excess water to drain 
from the container.

293
 Chapter 3: Spicing Things Up with Herbs
Book III

• To thin: Wait until the seedlings have at least a second set of 
leaves before thinning. When they do, carefully, carefully cut out 
the weaker plants with tiny scissors.
Taking Care of Your Herbs
Caring for herbs isn’t much different than attending to other annuals and 
perennials, but herbs may have a few special requests. The following sec-
tions tell you how to make sure your herbs have what they need to succeed, 
including protection from the baddies of the insect (and mite, snail, and slug) 
world.
Providing an herb’s basic needs
Although each type of herb has its own growing requirements, it’s pretty safe 
to say that most herbs are unfussy plants. Most prefer full sun and prosper in 
good, moderately fertile soil. And most require that the soil be well-drained 
so that they get the moisture they need to grow but don’t suffer from wet 
feet. If your chosen site is lacking in any of these requirements, take steps to 
improve it. Clip back overhanging trees and shrubs. Add organic matter, such 
as compost and/or dampened peat moss, as well as some sand to poor soil to 
improve its texture.
 
Herbs rarely need fertilizer. In fact, excess fertilizer may lead to lax, floppy 
growth that’s unattractive and vulnerable to diseases and pests. It may also 
inhibit flowering.
Some herbs like “sweeter” soil (soil with a higher pH, or alkaline soil). If your 
garden’s soil is toward the acidic side, a sprinkling of lime powder or chips 
at the herb’s base at planting time may be in order. Examples of herbs that 
prefer this sweeter soil include chia, lavender, and echinacea.
Some herbs prefer soggy ground. The drawback is that if you put them in 
such a spot, they may grow too rampantly; be willing to let them do as they 
will. If that’s not practical, simply raise them in a pot and keep the pot well-
watered and/or set in a saucer of water so the growing mix is perpetually 
damp. Examples of herbs that go for soggy ground include mint, bee balm, 
cardamom, chervil, goldenseal, and sorrel.

Dealing with herb pests
Believe it or not, many herbs are pest-free, which is one of the many reasons 
gardeners find these plants so easy and fun to grow. Some herbs even repel 
pests from themselves as well as adjacent plants. However, you may meet 
a handful of pests in your herb-growing ventures. If you do, act quickly to 
rescue your harvest, either by treating the plant or by tearing it out and get-
ting rid of it before the problem can spread. Check out Table 3-1 for a rap 
sheet of the major troublemakers.

Caring for potted herbs indoors
Herbs are easy and fun to grow inside, which 
may also extend the harvest for you if you have 
cold winters. They’re best on a kitchen win-
dowsill, provided it gets plenty of sun. That way, 
they’re handy when you need them for a recipe; 
plus the sight of them certainly adds character 
and a pleasant fragrance to your kitchen. Here 
are a couple other tips:
  Turn herbs occasionally so they’re health-
ier and look fuller and/or balanced. Potted 
herb plants naturally grow toward the 
source of sunlight, and they may start to 
lean or look one-sided unless you give them 
a quarter-turn every few days.
  Trim or harvest often. Life in a pot is pretty 
confining for most herbs, and you don’t want 
them to outgrow their space or start getting 
floppy or lanky. Cut off tips frequently. This 
trimming inspires the plant to branch and 
grow more densely and compactly.
After a while, your herbs may naturally peter 
out and need to be replaced. So enjoy them to 
the fullest while they’re in their prime!

The pests that go after herbs may seem as varied as the herbs themselves, 
but here are a few defensive strategies you can take to protect your herbs:
 
 Make sure your herbs are in good health, well-watered, and, in particu-
lar, have sufficient elbow room.
 
 Remove affected leaves. Also, pull out severely infested plants and 
throw them away before the problem spreads.
 
 Dislodge small infestations with a spray from the hose. Larger insect 
pests may be hand-picked and destroyed.

Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
 If you have to spray, try insecticidal soap, which is nontoxic. Make sure 
the pest you’re targeting is listed on the label and then carefully follow 
the directions regarding how and when to apply.
 
 You can combat certain pests with beneficial insects (such as ladybugs 
or lacewings). Look for more info — as well as assistance in attracting 
or acquiring the right helper — from a good garden center or from your 
cooperative extension agent, or do an online search.
 
 Get a little help from some friends. Some herbs may help each other out 
by keeping pests at bay.
 
If you succeed in beating back a pest and later want to use the herb for fresh 
eating or cooking, be sure to wash it thoroughly first!

H
omegrown fruits, berries, and nuts take more time and care than some 
other kinds of gardening. Although soft fruits like strawberries, grapes, 
and raspberries yield delicious results within a few months or less, tree fruits 
and nuts require more patience and can take several years to be productive. 
Fruits and nuts also require a different sort of preparation than non-fruit-or-
nut-bearing trees and bushes. But at harvest time, the work is all worth it! In 
almost every region of North America, you can find a type or variety of fruit 
or nut that’s well-adapted and fairly easy to grow.
Note: Many gardeners group fruits, berries, and nuts together because the 
cultivating methods are similar for all of them. For the sake of making the 
descriptions in this chapter simple, references to “fruit” include fruit, ber-
ries, and nuts, unless otherwise stated. Also, all the fruits in this chapter are 
perennial (they come up every year and are winter hardy) and all, except 
strawberries (which die back to the ground), are woody.
For now, though, let your imagination savor the aroma of sun-warmed fruit, 
picked fresh in your own yard. Then read on as I help you make that vision a 
reality.

Fruit Basics: Choosing the 
Right Fruits for Your Garden
Choosing the type of fruit you can support and grow is important and makes 
the difference between easy success and frustration or failure. Before you 
get your heart set on a certain kind of fruit you want to grow, do a little 
research. Not all types of fruit are suitable for home gardens, owing to their 
size or growth and maintenance requirements. Date palms and pineapple, for 
instance, are tough to grow. However, home gardeners do have a wide range 
of choices available. Here are some examples:
 
 Tree fruits: Apple, apricot, cherry, citrus fruits, crabapple, pear, peach, 
nectarine, plum, avocado, loquat, kumquat, pineapple guava, pomegran-
ate, persimmon, banana, and fig
 
 Vine fruits: Grape and kiwi
 
 Shrub fruits: Blackberry, raspberry, gooseberry, currant, and blueberry
 
 Ground-covering fruits: Strawberry and melon (for info on growing 
melons, see Chapter 2 of this Book, on vegetable gardening)
The following sections explain what factors you should consider as you 
decide what kind of fruit to grow.
Figuring the wait time from planting to 
harvest
Fruits come later in a plant’s seasonal cycle. First the flowers bloom, and 
then the petals fall as the fruit starts to swell (pollination from the same or 
an adjacent plant may be necessary — bees often help out). Small, hard, and 
green at first, a fruit expands in size and changes color on the way to becom-
ing juicy and ripe, with the seeds or pits nestled within (except in the odd 
case of strawberries).
So when can you start picking bushel loads of fruit? The answer to that 
depends on the type of fruit you’re growing. Some produce delicious results 
within a few months or less; others can take years. Before you run to the 
nursery, consider how long you’ll have to wait before getting a yield. Ground-
covering fruits are annuals (at least in a climate that has frost), while straw-
berries are perennials, but both produce fruit the first year. Most shrub fruits 
take two or three years to yield substantial amounts of fruit. Fruit trees take 
a few to several years to bear fruit, depending on the variety and the type of 
rootstock they’re on. Dwarf fruit trees tend to bear sooner, within 3 years, 
while trees on standard rootstocks can take 4 or more years.

Getting the lowdown on chill factors
You can find many named cultivars (cultivated varieties) within each type of 
fruit. You need to choose one suitable to your climate and growing condi-
tions. Some fruit plants are obviously better-adapted to certain climates than 
others. Avocados don’t work as a crop in cold regions; some pears and rasp-
berries are better in mild areas, while others are adapted to northern climes; 
most apples (but not all) thrive in cold, northern areas. Although you may 
be able to push your boundaries or cheat a bit in your garden with smaller 
plants, coddling a more substantial resident such as a big bush, vine, or tree 
isn’t always practical.
Take your cue from what sorts of fruits appear to be prospering in your 
area or what’s for sale at your local nursery. Call your nearest Cooperative 
Extension Service office and get recommendations not only for the types of 
fruits but also for the most suitable and cold-hardiest cultivars within each 
kind. In the meantime, here’s what you need to know about high-chill and 
low-chill fruits:
 
 High-chill: High-chill trees require more hours with temperatures below 
44 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius) to break dormancy and grow 
in the spring. High-chill trees don’t perform well in mild climates. Many 
apple, pear, cherry, and deciduous fruit and nut trees are rated by the 
number of hours of chill they require.
 
 Low-chill: Low-chill deciduous fruit trees require fewer hours of temper-
atures below 44 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius) in order to break 
dormancy. These types of deciduous fruit and nut trees do best where 
winters are mild.
Review Table 4-1 for further details on popular trees. Note: Chill hours means 
the total cold-season hours below 44 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius).
When is a veggie a fruit?
Here’s a bit of garden trivia. A fruit is defined 
as a ripened ovary. You can think of it as a 
“pregnant flower.” Using this definition, many 
plants that are known as veggies, like melons, 
cucumbers, tomatoes, and peppers, are literally 
fruits. But while they may be fruits technically, 
they’re still considered veggies by gardeners.

Studying your size accommodations
Adding fruit plants of some kind to your home landscape is not just about 
harvesting delicious fruit. The size of the plant is important, as is the relative 
beauty of its flowers and foliage. Ideally, the plant fits in and enhances the 
attractiveness of your yard even when it’s not producing fruit.
Pick a plant that fits into its allotted space in your home landscape. Be real-
istic, because fruit-bearing plants already require consistent maintenance 
without you also having to constantly cut them back in an effort to get them 
to fit in a too-small area.
To find out predicted mature size of a specific cultivar, look on the label, ask 
a nursery staffer, or look up the plant in a reference book, in a nursery cata-
log, or on the Internet. If your space is limited, go looking for a dwarf cultivar 
or one explicitly billed as having a compact growth habit. For instance, check 
out the “Colonnade” apple tree, which has a single main trunk that only 
grows to 10 feet tall with short branches. Don’t consign yourself to a career 
of constant shaping and pruning to keep an eager plant small unless you 
have the time and inclination! (Constant chopping back also runs the risk, of 
course, of reducing your potential harvest, not to mention making the plant 
look awkward or unattractive.)
Generally, two kinds of fruit trees are suitable for a home garden: regular and 
dwarf or semi-dwarf. The latter are best if your space is limited, of course. 
Caring for and harvesting from fruit trees often requires a longer reach, 
namely the use of a ladder and pole saws or long-reach pruners. Examples of 
favorite taller or larger fruit plants include apple, pear, peach, apricot, plum, 
and citrus (lemon, orange, and grapefruit) trees, and kiwi vines.
Easy access, baby
Access may also be a consideration for you. If you dream of simply strolling out 
with a basket and gathering up fresh fruit, choose a fruit that doesn’t require 
you to use a ladder to harvest it. Examples of favorite, more-compact growers 
include currant, gooseberry, blueberry (both high-bush and low-bush), straw-
berry, and some blackberry, raspberry, and grape cultivars. Figure 4-1 shows a 
typical strawberry garden plan that allows easy harvesting.

Here are a few more ideas to consider as you explore how to fit fruits into 
your garden:
 
 Use a line of berry plants as a property boundary.
 
 Put single berry plants at the corners of your vegetable garden.
 
 Use a shrub or small fruit tree in your foundation planting.
 
 Plant a fruit tree in your entryway garden (so long as it gets enough sun).
 
 Create a small orchard in your back forty.
 
 Expand your vegetable garden to include a strawberry or melon patch.
 
 Add a berry bush or two to an informal shrub border.
 
 Plant berry bushes at the base of a gazebo (not blocking, of course, the 
way in).
 
 Site one or more fruit trees in an informal lawn, on a slight slope, or in 
another open area.
 
 Plant fruit trees in your street-side curb strip (after some soil improve-
ment, no doubt).
 
 Plant a fruiting vine so it grows over a pergola or archway, creating 
shade below.
 
 Grow a dwarf fruit tree in a large container on a sunny patio or deck.
If you have the room, you can install a full-blown fruit garden, like the one in 
Figure 4-2.
Because some plants can’t pollinate themselves, you may have to allow room 
for two or more plants. See the following section for details.
Going solo or in pairs: 
Looking at pollination
Certain fruits require cross pollination to set their fruits. Sometimes, plant-
ing more than one of the same variety is sufficient, but other times, you must 
plant a different variety of the same type of fruit to get the best results. It is 
very difficult to generalize which fruits this pertains to. The best approach 
is to carefully read the catalog or ask the salesperson you are buying from 
whether the plant is self-fruitful or requires a different or additional pollina-
tor. If your supplier can’t answer this question, buy from someone else. You 
need a supplier who knows for sure.

Getting Your Soil Ready for Fruits
Before you acquire your plants, take time to prepare the soil. It is far better 
to deal with the soil before you plant than after — a berry bush, fruit tree, or 
strawberry patch is a major landscape investment, so there’s no sense in cut-
ting corners from the get-go. A good time to start prepping your soil is during 
the year before you plan to plant your fruit bearers.
Attending to soil quality
Good-quality soil is especially important when raising edibles. You want 
your crop to be both safe and tasty. The following suggestions can help you 
achieve your goals:
 
 Do a soil test on the intended spot. Buy a kit, follow the directions, mail 
the sample into a lab, and await recommendations.
 
 On the test form, be sure to put the name of the fruit you intend to raise. 
That way the recommendations for soil improvement that come back 
from the lab will be tailored to that crop. For example, blueberry bushes 
prefer a lower pH, so the lab may suggest that you add some sulfur to 
make your ground more acidic; peach trees and certain European grape 
cultivars like conditions a bit more alkaline, and some supplemental 
lime may be in order. Note that these amendments take time to move 
through the soil, so try to add them the fall prior to spring planting.
 
 Add organic matter. Organically rich soil, not surprisingly, is ideal. It 
offers a slow-release reservoir of nutrients your fruit-bearing plants need 
and relish. Dig some in ahead of time, and replenish it at least annually. 
It lightens heavy clay soil and improves sandy soil, making the entire 
area more hospitable to plant roots. Good choices include compost, 
well-rotted manure, rotted sawdust, chopped up leaves, and spent 
mushroom soil. Adding periodic doses of fertilizer can also help your 
crop along, but you need this initial foundation.
Digging the right-sized hole
As with so many other plants in your garden, fruit-bearing plants need ample 
space for their roots to develop. Sufficient soil both nourishes and anchors 
plants. Take measure of how extensive the root system is on planting day, 
and then go farther to allow for future growth.

306
Book III: Edible Gardening 
For example, because strawberry plants generally send their roots 6 to 12 
inches down, you should provide them with prepared soil that’s at least that 
deep, with several more inches to spare. An apple or plum tree, on the other 
hand, may send roots many feet deep into the ground over the course of its 
life; you’re not likely to be willing or able to excavate a major hole and have 
to count on the chosen spot having decent soil. Just give a young root-ball 
ample space. A hole 12 to 18 inches deep and wide usually does the trick. 
Remember to scrape the sides of the hole with your shovel or trowel to 
loosen the soil and thus make it easier for the roots to expand.
As for width, accommodate the root-ball and then some. For a fruit tree, 
although you may not dig a hole that extends as far as the branches and 
roots may someday extend, you can spread amendments out that direction, 
mix them in, and leave them to work their way down gradually.
Buying Your Fruit Bearers
Unlike some annual and perennial flowers and veggies, fruit-bearers are not 
plants you want to try raising from seed — it takes forever! Not only that, but 
many fruit bearers do not come true (have the traits of their parent plants) 
from seed. For the fastest and most gratifying results, buy plants. You can 
buy them in containers, balled-and-burlapped, or bare-root.
If you shop at a local nursery, buy the largest plants you can find and afford 
so you can get off to a faster start. Confirm that the plant’s well rooted 
by poking into the soil mix and/or tipping the pot and sliding it out to see 
for yourself. Favor plants with buds over ones that are already flowering, 
because the trip home or the transition from pot to garden soil is likely to 
make them jettison blooms early in favor of establishing their roots in their 
new home. New buds, flowers, and eventually fruit will come along in due 
course!
If you choose bare-root plants — which may look like nothing more than 
a slender branch (a whip) with some roots — you need to be concerned 
particularly with the quality of the root system. Many broken or dried-out 
roots are not a good sign. You may end up trimming either the top growth 
or the roots prior to planting (see “Bare-root plants,” in the upcoming plant-
ing section), but you want to head into the project with a good plant.
If you’re going the mail-order route, shop with a specialist. Avoid nurseries 
where the plants aren’t clearly or fully identified as well as those that offer 
fruit plants only as a sideline. You want people who propagate and ship 
the plants themselves; they know what they’re doing, and this streamlined 
system also keeps the quality higher and the costs down. Find such compa-
nies in the ads in gardening magazines (particularly in the classified ads in 
the back) or online.

To make sure you get a healthy plant, follow this general advice:
 
 Always buy from a reputable source. Ask around, nose around, 
and examine the source’s guarantee and refund policy. Your local 
Cooperative Extension Service office may be able to point you toward 
good nearby sources.
 
 Don’t bother with bargain-hunting. You get what you pay for.
 
 Require a label and/or accurate identification. This label includes not 
only the type of plant (for example, apple or Northern highbush blue-
berry) but also the cultivar (“McIntosh” or “Bluecrop,” respectively).
 
 Ask or look for some assurance that your choice is “certified” or 
“virus-tested.” Virus-infected plants don’t always look diseased, at least 
not at first. If you skip this step and bring home an infected plant, it’ll 
decline over time, and you may never know why or think you did some-
thing wrong.
 
 Check visually for plant health. Both top growth and the root system 
should be intact and in good condition, showing no signs of damage, rot, 
galls, or pests.
Planting Fruits
The key to a bountiful fruit harvest is in the planting: when you plant, where you 
plant, and how you get the plants in the ground. In determining the right plant-
ing time, climate is important, as is the specific planting location. And of course, 
planting a balled-and-burlapped tree requires a different technique than does a 
container plant or a bare-root one. This section walks you through everything 
you need to know. You also get the basics on planting a berry patch.
Choosing the best time to plant fruits
Here’s the basic principle about timing, folks: Plant to allow maximum time 
for the fruit plant to get growing before the most stressful conditions of the 
year occur. In colder climates, get the plants in the ground in the springtime 
so they can enjoy a nice, long summer before cold weather arrives in the fall. 
Wait until the danger of frost has passed so young buds aren’t harmed or 
killed. Plant bare-root plants as soon as you can work the ground in spring.
In mild climates, the stressful time is the height of the hot summer, so you’re 
often better off planting fruits in the fall or early winter. This timing allows 
young stock to establish their root systems before being called upon to pro-
duce new spring growth. Still-warm soil and, hopefully, drenching fall rains 
can welcome the new arrivals and hasten this process along.

308
Book III: Edible Gardening 
Deciding where to plant your fruits
Gardeners talk about three main factors to consider when finding a home in 
your landscape for fruit, nut, and berry plants. Ideally, you want to satisfy all 
these conditions so your crop doesn’t struggle:
 
 Sun: Plentiful sun is a requirement — I’m talking at least six to eight 
hours a day, or even more. Fruit simply doesn’t develop or prosper in 
shady conditions (even plant foliage may suffer or be sparse). So choose 
a south-facing spot, or, in a pinch, one that faces east or west. (Morning 
sun — an east-facing exposure — is better than west because it dries 
morning dew; morning dew that hangs around too long can cause fruit 
to rot.)
 
 Elbow room: Pick a site out in the open, well away from the shade cast 
by a house, other building, fence, or other obstruction. Prune back 
any nearby shrub or tree branches that may be encroaching. Planting 
distances vary depending on the type of fruit and the rootstock it’s on. 
Read the planting distance guidelines in the catalog or on the plant label.
 
 Drainage: Look for a spot with decent soil and good drainage. Avoid nat-
urally damp spots or those that hold rainwater for more than 12 hours. 
No berry-producing plants or fruit trees like wet feet. Being waterlogged 
deprives the roots of needed oxygen and may actually inhibit the uptake 
of some soil nutrients.
 
 If drainage is iffy in your yard, favor an upland spot or slope. In any 
event, planting fruits in the lowest part of your landscape is never advis-
able. Heavy clay soil is a problem — though improving drainage by dig-
ging in lots of organic matter is possible. Alternatively, you can go to the 
trouble of creating a broad and deep (up to a foot, depending on what 
you plan to grow) raised bed. See Chapter 1 of this Book for more info 
on raised beds.
 
So, you know to plant your fruit plants in a place where the sun is ample, the 
drainage is good, and the soil is well-nourished. Here are some places you 
don’t want to plant:
 
 On steep slopes: Slopes are hard to plant, and the plants are hard to 
care for.
 
 In the middle of a pampered lawn: Lawn fertilizer is too nitrogen-heavy 
for fruit plants to tolerate, and mowers and string trimmers can be a 
hazard.
 
 Against a wall or fence: Barriers crowd a plant, and poor air circulation 
is not good for its health (the exception is an espaliered fruit tree — see 
the upcoming section titled “Supporting and training your fruit”).

Getting your fruit in the ground
How to plant fruit depends very much on the type of fruit you want to plant 
and what form it comes in. In the following sections, you first get some point-
ers on planting according to whether the fruit you purchase is initially in a 
container, a bare-root plant, or a balled-and-burlapped tree. Then I tell you 
how to plant a berry patch, which entails a slightly different approach.
Container plants
Berry bushes and some small fruit trees often come in containers. Assuming 
you have an appropriate spot ready, the planting process is simple and logi-
cal if you follow these steps:
 
1. Choose a good day.
 
 On the best of days, all danger of frost is past, but the weather is over-
cast or drizzly. A hot, sunny day is too stressful. If the weather is clear, 
at least plant later in the day.
 
2. Prepare the plant first.
 
 Water it well and let excess water drain away. Groom it lightly, trim-
ming away any damaged branches and leaves. Pinch off most (but not 
all) of the buds, if any exist; this act encourages the plant to redirect its 
energies toward root development. After the plant establishes itself, it’ll 
surely generate new buds, anyway.
 
3. Pop the root system out of the pot.
 
 If the root system is thick and dense, sliding a butter knife or stick 
around the perimeter should dislodge it, or perhaps you can cut the 
container away with tin snips. Tease the roots loose on the bottom and 
a bit on the sides — this encourages the plant to venture out into its 
new home in your garden soil. If the plant is root-bound, score the sides 
at four or so even intervals with a sharp knife, slicing only about an inch 
in — this scoring severs girdling roots and inspires new feeder roots to 
start growing.
 
4. Plant it at the same level it was growing in the pot, and water.
 
 Backfill soil into the hole and firm it into place to eliminate air pockets. 
Water well, let the ground settle, and add more soil as needed.
Bare-root plants
Most fruit trees, and sometimes berry-producing shrubs, are sold as bare-
root plants; strawberry plants are commonly sold in small bare-root bundles. 
These plants are dormant, which means you can buy and plant them earlier 
in the gardening year — as soon as the soil is dry enough to crumble easily 
in your hand. If you can’t plant right away, store bare-root plants in a cool, 
shaded spot and keep them moist.

310
Book III: Edible Gardening 
On planting day, here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Prep the plant.
 
 Unwrap the plant, and if the roots are more than a foot long or look dam-
aged or frayed, trim them back with clean, sharp clippers. Then soak the 
roots and stem in a bucket of tepid, muddy water (add a handful of soil) 
for a few hours or overnight to rehydrate them. As for the top growth, 
if the plant has branches, shorten them to a few inches (cutting to just 
above an outward-facing bud). This trim inspires vigorous, spreading 
growth. If the tree or shrub is a mere whip (single stem), cut it back to 2 
or 3 feet tall if the grower hasn’t already done so.
 
2. Make a mound inside the hole.
 
 Use the excavated soil (or a mixture of it and some organic matter) to 
make a mound in the hole. You’ll set the plant here and array the roots 
on it, so make the mound tall. To allow for some settling, adjust the 
height of the mound so the plant will stand about 2 inches higher than 
it stood at the nursery (How do you know? Look for the telltale, old soil 
line low on the trunk).
 
3. Add the plant and position it.
 
 Place the tree or shrub atop the mound and spread the roots out evenly 
on all sides. Be careful not to bend or break them, and don’t crowd them 
either. If the tree is branched, orient it with the lowest branch facing 
southwest — this positioning will eventually help shade the trunk and 
lessen the chance of sunscald. If the site is out in the open and windy, 
lean the tree ever so slightly into the direction of the prevailing winds.
 
4. Backfill.
 
 Hold the plant steady (or get a helper to do so) and scoop soil back into 
the hole. You may have to bounce the plant up and down slightly as you 
work to settle the soil among the roots. When it stands on its own, add 
more soil, tamping it down gently with your hands as you work to pre-
vent air pockets.
 
5. Create a basin.
 
 Make the basin about a foot or two out from the trunk, mounding up 
soil to several inches high. Fill it partway with compost or other organic 
material, which will nourish the new young feeder roots that are devel-
oping. Top off with some weed-inhibiting mulch.
 
6. Water.
 
 Finally, soak slowly and thoroughly today and at least once a week for 
the rest of the season, unless you get good rainfall. A young fruit tree or 
berry bush is a thirsty plant.

Balled-and-burlapped plants
Fruit trees and larger berry-producing shrubs may be available in balled-and-
burlapped form. This indicates that the plant was recently field-dug, and the 
purpose of the burlap or other cloth and trusses is to hold the soil protec-
tively in place around the root-ball. Here are the steps to follow to return the 
plant to the ground in your own yard:
 
1. Get the hole ready.
 
 The size of the root-ball in this case is perfectly obvious, which is nice. 
Make the hole slightly bigger, both for maneuverability and also to 
encourage the roots to move outward in their new home. Assuming the 
plant is not too big, you can check your work by temporarily holding the 
trussed plant in the hole.
 
2. Double-check depth.
 
 Set the trussed root-ball in the hole, and then place a piece of lumber or 
a rod of some kind across the top of the hole. The top of the root mass 
should meet it. If not, you know what to do — take it out and dig more, 
or backfill a bit.
 
3. Unwrap the plant.
 
 Do this unwrapping outside the hole but right nearby. Cut off or unwind 
all rope, twine, string, or whatever is holding the burlap or cloth in 
place. Be especially careful to get off any material binding the trunk. 
Modern burlap may contain synthetic (plastic) material that practi-
cally never decays, so don’t leave the burlap on. Some root-balls are 
also enveloped in a planting bag or wire basket — whatever you have, 
remove it.
 
4. Plant.
 
 Set or wiggle the root-ball into the prepared hole and backfill thoroughly 
to eliminate air pockets. If the tree is branched, orient it with the lowest 
branch facing southwest to eventually help shade the trunk and lessen 
the chance of sunscald. If the site is windy, lean the tree slightly into the 
direction of the prevailing winds.
 
5. Create a basin and water.
 
 Make the basin about a foot or two out from the trunk, mounding up 
soil to several inches high. Fill it partway with compost or other organic 
material, and top off with some weed-inhibiting mulch. Soak slowly and 
thoroughly at planting and at least weekly till the end of the season 
(unless you get good rainfall). Watering is particularly critical because 
the root-ball may have dried out while it was out of the ground, despite 
its protective wrapping.

A berry patch
Want to grow raspberries, blackberries, or marionberries? When you plant 
a berry patch, you have to prepare an entire area and install future support. 
I advise starting with a single row. The reason for the trellis is that it keeps 
your plants upright (rather than in a slumping tangle); this method keeps the 
plants drier and thus less prone to disease, and they’re much easier to har-
vest from.
 
Don’t grow cultivated berries anywhere near wild brambles or near an area 
where you grow or have recently grown eggplants, peppers, tomatoes, pota-
toes, or strawberries — all these plants can host diseases that are harmful to 
cultivated berries.
Here are the steps to follow when creating your berry patch:
 
1. Make the row.
 
 Clear an area of all weeds, grass, and physical obstructions. The row 
should be about 2 feet wide and as long as you want.
 
2. Create a planting trench.
 
 The roots of berry bushes are likely to grow down to about a foot deep, 
so excavate to at least that depth. Improve the soil with organic matter 
and with amendments that adjust the pH, if recommended by a soil test.
 
3. Erect support.
 
 The object is to keep the canes off the ground and not to crowd them. 
You want good air circulation, which lessens the chance of disease. Use 
posts made of rot-resistant wood (like cedar) or metal posts. Plunge 
the posts deeply into the ground, add braces if warranted, and then run 
strong wire between them to support and confine the plants. Your sup-
port setup options include
 
• A patch with posts at four corners
 
• Single posts at each end of your row
 
• Single posts with crosspieces
 
 The standard advice is to rig the wires at 2- to 3-foot intervals.
 
4. Plant.
 
 Space the bushes at even intervals, 2 or 3 feet apart down the row and 
right under the lowest wire. Follow the previous planting directions in 
“Container plants,” including giving each plant a good soaking.
 
5. Cut back.

313
 Chapter 4: Adding Fruits, Berries, and Nuts
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
 
 After planting and watering are complete, tiptoe into the patch with 
your clippers and cut the plants off at ground level. I know, this shearing 
sounds drastic, but you may be eliminating canes that harbor diseases; 
plus, you don’t want the plants to charge into early growth and fruiting. 
Instead, this step forces your new berry plants to focus on establishing 
and expanding their root systems. New canes will appear soon enough.
Taking Care of Fruit-Producing Plants
Modern fruit cultivars are bred to be productive and deliver a bountiful 
harvest. This trend is all well and good, but there are downsides. The sheer 
volume and weight of lots of fruit can cause a plant to slump, slouch, bow 
down, or trail fruiting branches on the ground. Also, humans aren’t the only 
critters who like to eat fruits and nuts, and keeping these crops protected 
well enough so that you have something to show for all your hard work can 
be challenging. In this section, I give you the pointers you need to keep your 
fruit healthy, happy, and plentiful enough to enjoy!
Watering
Although too much water or poor drainage can drown a plant or encourage 
disease, fruit plants still need moisture. Shallow-rooted crops, like blueber-
ries and strawberries, especially need ample water. Even if your climate pro-
vides natural rainfall, you may still have to supplement it. The most critical 
periods are at planting time and during fruit swell.
I recommend trickle irrigation for watering berry-producing plants, either 
with a soaker hose, a regular hose set quite low, or an in-ground system with 
emitters especially designed for this purpose. These methods allow the water 
to reach the roots evenly and gradually and yet avoid wetting the fruit (wet 
fruit is susceptible to rot, a particular concern for raspberries, blueberries, 
and strawberries).
Fertilizing
Unlike, say, vegetable crops, the majority of fruit-bearing plants are not heavy 
feeders. If your soil is fertile or you’ve improved soil fertility prior to planting, 
feeding is not a big part of maintenance. (Sure, commercial orchards dose 
their trees and bushes on a regular basis, but they’re aiming for maximum 
yields; home growers can afford to be less indulgent.)

314
Book III: Edible Gardening 
In any event, apply fertilizer to soil that’s neither excessively acidic nor 
alkaline (address soil acidity prior to planting by having a soil test done and 
taking any corrective measures needed).
When you do feed your fruit trees or berry plants, use a complete, balanced, 
all-purpose fertilizer applied at the rates described on the label. More is not 
better! A dose in spring as the growing season begins is a good idea, and you 
may want to fertilize once again when the fruit is starting to form. (Don’t feed 
later in the season, which can inspire fresh new growth that may not have 
time to harden before cold weather sets in and potentially damages tender 
shoots.)
Some fertilizers can be top-dressed. Top dressing is the surface application 
of fertilizer that is scratched into the top inch or two of the soil. You poke 
others into the ground at intervals above the root system. The nutrients 
get to the plant roots only when watered in. In fact, you’re best off watering 
before and after feeding the plants. Refer to Chapter 1 of this Book for more 
on fertilizing.
 
No particular type of fertilizer can compel your fruit to bear at an earlier age. 
The age of bearing is mainly influenced by the variety, how and when you 
prune, and by some rootstocks in the case of grafted fruit trees.
Cutting back on mulch
I know, I know, you’re always being told to mulch garden plants to keep 
weeds at bay and conserve soil moisture. But mulching is not as critical 
with many fruit plants because the trees tend to cast shade over their bases, 
which helps with such matters. Mulch can even be a detriment in a berry 
patch or small orchard because it can harbor pests — hungry little rodents 
or voracious slugs.
Supporting and training your fruit
To keep your harvest off the dirt and in the air where it’s able to develop freely 
and enjoy good air circulation and plentiful sunshine, supports may be in order. 
A wide variety is available, depending on the fruit you want to grow. Figure 4-3 
shows two of the many ways — a Kniffen trellis and a Pendelbogen — to train 
grapes with supports.
Supports help keep a developing harvest visible and serve to train the fruit 
so as to make it easily accessible. They also ensure a larger harvest. This sup-
port may involve anything from bracing boards under a heavy branch to a 
sturdy trellis to rigs of posts and wire. Figure this need into your plans when 
selecting both a spot and a cultivar.

All the systems have one thing in common: They are designed to keep the 
vines off the ground so the fruit has good air circulation and exposure to 
sunlight, and is easier to harvest. If your vines don’t end up looking just like a 
book drawing, don’t worry. It’s not critical.
Fruit-tree training systems, on the other hand, are designed to not only 
expose the fruit to good air flow (to reduce disease) and to bright sunlight 
(to ripen the fruit), but to encourage a tree structure that is strong and will 
encourage more fruit production. The ones in Figure 4-4 are fairly easy to 
follow, but others may be equally successful.
 
Espalier trees are trained to grow in one dimension or plane (see Figure 4-4). 
They are commonly used against fences or buildings. Their shapes can be 
quite artistic and ornamental. In addition to being aesthetically pleasing, they 
also result in high-quality fruit that is easy to tend and harvest.
Pruning
Fruit-bearing plants need regular pruning. It keeps the plants in bounds, 
attractive-looking, healthy, and — perhaps most importantly — helps them 
be more productive.
Here’s the general rule: Prune fruit plants when they’re dormant. You’re 
better able to see what you’re doing without a lot of foliage and so forth in 
the way, both in terms of shaping the plant and making sure you cut right 
above a bud. You also get little or no sap bleeding. And when growth starts 
up, the plant should grow as you plan and direct.
 
Always use clean, sharp tools when you prune. Clean, because you don’t 
want to spread disease, and sharp, because blunt cutters mash and crush 
stems and branches. And always use the right tool for the job; applying a 
hand-held clipper to a thick branch is frustrating and foolish.
 
If any of this sort of maintenance is too difficult, too dangerous, or too 
time-consuming, consider scaling back your plans or hiring qualified help. 
Whatever you do, don’t let the problem go. A neglected fruit tree or berry 
patch is a sorry sight, not to mention hard work to reclaim.
Tree fruits
A crop of tree fruits can be heavy, so a fruit tree needs to be shaped from 
an early age so that its framework is strong enough to bear the weight. That 
said, do no more pruning on a young tree than is totally necessary, or you 
risk delaying its first crop.

Book III: Edible Gardening 
Scaffold limbs are evenly spaced, come out from the main trunk at wide 
angles, and over time have a spiral arrangement around the trunk. Take out 
branches that crowd, cross, or shade others, right at the trunk (leave no 
stubs, in other words).
In later years, do an annual pruning to maintain this early form. Cut to reduce 
the fruit load and stimulate new shoot growth. How much should you cut? It 
depends on the size and heft of the particular fruit and the bearing habit of 
the tree. So read up in more detail on your particular tree or get the advice of 
a more experienced fruit grower.
 
Apple, pear, and other fruit trees often have June drop, a time when immature 
fruits fall from the tree. This natural fruit loss is a reminder to thin the fruit. 
Too many fruits clustered too closely together don’t ripen well, nor do they 
reach their ideal size. Thin so you have 6 inches between fruits. Remember 
that pruning and thinning are harder on you than on the plant.
Shrub fruits
Fruits that grow on bushes need to be prevented from becoming crowded; a 
tangle is difficult to prune, tricky to harvest from, and more prone to diseases 
and pests. You don’t have to do much the first season or two, but in subse-
quent years, you have to make an annual habit of thinning out the older wood 
(branches and canes). This pruning makes way for the new shoots, which, 
believe me, are always coming on. If you see a lot of new shoots, you may 
even have to thin out some of them. Figure 4-5 shows how to prune raspberry 
bushes; you can apply this method to most other shrub fruits.
 
Some berry plants produce fruit on first-year canes, some on second-year 
canes, so be careful that you don’t cut out all the productive canes in your 
zeal to control the patch. You can find out which kind your berry bushes are 
either by simply observing or by asking when you purchase the plants.
The normal bramble life cycle of many shrub fruits is to produce a vegetative 
cane (primocane) in the first year; it overwinters, becomes a fruit-producing 
cane (floricane) the following year, and then dies. So your training becomes a 
cyclical matter of supporting these stems, encouraging them to stand up and 
trail outward along the wire, and removing them at ground level when they’re 
through at the end of their second year. You can use cloth ties or just guide 
the fast-growing, lax, thorny stems.
Vine fruits
How you prune grapes, hardy kiwi, and other vining fruits depends on the 
sort of support you’ve chosen for them and how much space you allow them 
to fill. At the outset (the year you plant), cut back rather drastically to a few 
buds. This trim channels energy into growth of one or two main stems or 
“trunks.”

Prune old shoots to 6 in (15 cm)
Subsequent side branches, evenly spaced off the main trunk, are called cor-
dons and are considered more or less permanent. Often, the more of these, 
the better — they make for a fuller and more productive vine in the long run. 
So give the plant good care (regular water, fertilizer, and so on) in its first 
season or two to encourage plenty of cordons. Off of these come the third 
tier of branches, known as fruiting arms. These structures get a season to 
produce and then should be cut back somewhat or all the way back to the 
originating cordon in order to stimulate new ones and a fresh crop. That’s it. 
Not as hard or complex as you thought, eh?
 
If you don’t prune a vine fruit each year, it can soon grow longer and higher 
until the fruit you want is far out of reach. To bring it back down into range, 
all you need to do is cut it back until all that remains are the main trunk and 
some evenly spaced cordons; cut back while the plant is dormant.

Dealing with fruit pests
Homegrown fruits are so delicious that we aren’t the only ones who like to 
eat ’em. If a certain kind of pest or disease is a common problem in your area, 
choose a fruit plant variety that’s billed as resistant. Your local cooperative 
extension agent should be able to help you with this selection. Naturally, a 
healthy plant is a more resistant one. So take good care of your fruit plants, 
making sure they have the sun, space, air circulation, water, and food they 
need to thrive. In particular, water at the base of the plants so the foliage and 
fruit don’t become wet; this method heads off all sorts of fungal problems at 
the pass.
In case these preventive measures fail, the following sections outline some 
tactics for warding off the competition.
Targeting birds, bugs, and beasties
No matter how healthy your plant is, you may still end up doing battle with 
the animal kingdom:
 
 Birds: These flying scavengers adore berries and strike with precise 
timing, at the peak of ripe perfection. Don’t allow this pilfering! Cover 
the plants after flowering is over (so you don’t thwart pollination) but 
before green fruit begins to ripen. Use plastic netting, cheesecloth, or 
anything that covers the plants but still lets in light, air, and water (see 
Figure 4-6). For larger berry patches, some gardeners rig a wooden 
framework over them and drape the protective cloth over this; then they 
can just lift one end to harvest, like raising a flap to enter a tent.
 
 If covering the trees with netting isn’t practical, try draping netting over 
the lower branches and letting the birds have the higher-up fruit, which 
is harder for you to harvest, anyway. Hanging bright and noisy objects 
from the branches, such as pie tins, sometimes works.
 
 Rodents: Gnawing critters can do extensive damage to fruit trees. 
Wrapping the trees with a protective covering sometimes helps. Also, 
be sure not to pile mulch up against the trunk of the trees over winter. 
Doing so can provide a cozy hiding place for these creatures that may 
make a meal of the tree bark during the freezing weather.
 
 Bugs and other creepy crawlers: Sorry to say, you’re up against all sorts 
of buggy threats, from ravenous caterpillars on apple trees to aphids, 
mealybugs, and spider mites that infest citrus trees. If you’re already 
growing an allegedly resistant variety and you’re genuinely giving your 
plants good growing conditions and good care, the situation seems so 
unjust! What can you do? You’re not out of the fight yet:

• Practice good sanitation. Remove all plant debris at the base of 
the plants and groom the plants often to get rid of any growth or 
fruits in poor condition or already affected. Get rid of all of this 
material — send it away with the household garbage!
 
• Identify the culprit. You can’t truly fight back until you know thy 
enemy. If you need help with identification, take an affected plant 
part and/or the suspect to your local nursery or a knowledgeable 
landscaper.

322
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
• Try nontoxic weapons first. If practical, knock off pests with a 
blast from the hose or hand-pick the offenders. Spray with insec-
ticidal soap (or a fungicide, if the problem is a disease and not a 
pest). Introduce beneficial insects that target this pest.
 
• Spray pesticides only as a last resort and with an appropriate 
product for the problem. Always follow label instructions to the 
letter regarding dose and timing, and protect yourself with full-
body clothing and goggles.
 
• Inspect and wash off all fruit before eating or cooking it. You 
may decide to tolerate small imperfections rather than declare an 
all-out war.
The blanket effect: Spraying fruit trees
It’s a cold, hard fact: Unless you don’t mind finding tunnels in your ripe fruit, 
biting into a fat worm, or having to discard the crop you worked so hard to 
grow, you have to do at least some spraying. The spraying is preventive. It 
controls both bugs and diseases that can harm your crop.
Organic or synthetic, the product you want for this job is either a dormant oil 
or an all-purpose mixture of fungicide and insecticide labeled for orchard use. 
You can buy these products at any nursery or garden center in the springtime. 
Follow the label instructions regarding application and timing to the letter, and 
be sure to wear protective clothing and use a good, clean sprayer.
Halt spraying two or more weeks before harvest, and always wash your fruit 
before eating or cooking it.
Following are times that are typically good for spraying:
 
 Early spring, when tips of buds are swelling and showing green: This 
spraying combats late scab, brown rot, and other common woes. The 
first spray of the season is the most important and should head off at 
the pass numerous potential pest problems. It controls scab (an early-
spring problem, technically a fungus) and early flying insects, such as 
coddling moths.
 
 A few weeks later, when leaf buds (not flower buds — leaf buds are 
thin and pointed) are just unfurling: Like the first spraying, round two 
fights late scab and brown rot.
 
 At blossoming, when the fat, colored blossom buds (usually white or 
pink) are almost ready to burst open: This prevents diseases that attack 
these young flowers and will eventually infect the developing fruit.
 
 At petal fall, when nearly all petals are off the tree: Insects are begin-
ning to hatch just now, so this spray is especially critical.
 
 Later sprays — every week or two, as needed: These sprays control 
mites, sawflies, curculios, and apple maggots, as well as summer dis-
eases like scab and brown rot.

A
fter planting your edible garden, you want to keep it growing vigor-
ously until harvest. To do that, you need to keep your plants healthy 
and well-nourished throughout the growing season. If you let up just a bit on 
water or fertilizer, your harvest will be small or of poor quality. If you’ve ever 
tasted a cucumber harvested from a plant that has dried out, you know how 
bitter a poor harvest can be. But don’t worry. In this chapter, you find out 
everything you need to know to keep your garden happy.
Watering Basics
Although Mother Nature is often very generous with rain, there are times 
when she leaves gardens with a dry spell. Flooding isn’t good for your 
garden, but neither is drought. If your plants don’t have adequate water at 
the right time, they can easily die. But not all plants have the same watering 
needs, so you have to be discriminating.
Different plants need different amounts of water. Some vegetables, like 
celery, are real water lovers and prefer to have moist soil around their roots 
at all times.
The depth of a plant’s roots also makes a difference. Shallow-rooted plants 
(like onions and cabbage) need more careful watering during dry spells 
than deeper-rooted plants (like tomatoes), which can pull water from 
greater depths.

324
Book III: Edible Gardening 
The plant’s growth stage — where it is in its life cycle — is also a factor. Here 
are some general watering guidelines for different growth stages:
 
 Seedlings and germinating seeds: Seedlings with small root systems 
near the soil surface and germinating seeds benefit from frequent, gentle 
watering, which enables them to sprout and emerge quickly. Water once 
or twice a day to keep the soil lightly and evenly moist to a depth of 2 
inches if it doesn’t rain.
 
 Transplants: After you plant transplants in your garden, water them fre-
quently (daily if hot and dry) to help the roots recover from transplant 
shock.
 
 Established plants: Once plants have been in your garden for a few 
weeks and are beyond transplant shock, water deeply (to a depth of 
about 6 inches). Dig into the soil with a trowel to see how far the water 
has penetrated. Watering to this depth encourages roots to penetrate 
deeply, where they’re less susceptible to drought. Give the soil a chance 
to dry out slightly before watering thoroughly again.
Keeping a close eye on your plants is easier said than done, of course, but 
the following sections tell you what you need to know, to keep in mind, and 
to watch out for when evaluating just how much moisture your garden needs.
Why water matters: A short science lesson
Sure, without moisture, plants die. Everyone 
knows that. But you may not know why water 
is so incredibly vital. The answer is threefold, 
actually:
  Sufficient water pressure within plant tis-
sues creates turgor, or rigidity, so the plant 
can stand up. A plant without turgor pres-
sure collapses.
  Water keeps nutrients flowing from the soil, 
into the roots, and through the plant parts; it 
keeps the show going.
  The show is the chemical process of photo-
synthesis, which you no doubt remember 
from biology class in high school. The 
plant uses light, carbon dioxide, and water 
to make sugar (a pretty impressive trick). 
Without photosynthesis, plants can’t grow 
or develop flowers or fruit. And the by-
product, which is so beneficial to the Earth, 
is oxygen.

The tell-tale signs of water woes
How do you make sure your garden has the right amount of moisture? 
Relying on natural rainfall would be nice, but natural rainfall is hard to count 
on as the natural rain cycles are not necessarily in synch with the gardening 
seasons in many parts of the country. You need to keep an eye on things and 
pay attention to your plants.
A plant that doesn’t get enough water displays warning signs, in this order 
(Note: The earlier you notice the signs, the better for the plant and your 
harvest):
 
1. Flower petals and buds droop, or fruit if it has developed.
 
2. Leaves droop and then shrivel.
 
3. Stems flop.
 
4. Roots go limp.
Obviously, if your plants are in this condition, they need water ASAP. 
However, these symptoms can be misleading at times. Some plants, like 
tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants, tend to droop slightly during the heat of 
the day, even if the soil has enough moisture.
 
Your index finger is the best indicator of when the soil is dry enough to war-
rant watering. Dig down several inches into the soil; if the soil is dry to the 
touch 3 to 4 inches down, it’s time to water.
Too much water is also a problem. It starves the plant roots of oxygen. In 
addition, some plant diseases (like mildew and blight) travel via water and 
can easily develop and spread in soaked conditions. Unfortunately, an over-
watered plant looks the same as one that’s underwatered: It wilts. Its roots 
are too damaged by lack of oxygen to draw in water. It’s a classic case of 
water, water, everywhere, but not a drop to drink! The obvious solution is to 
reduce watering (and resolve the drainage problems).
Determining which watering system to use
For many gardeners, getting enough water to their gardens is the biggest gar-
dening challenge. The following sections outline your options.
 
However you water, keep these things in mind:

326
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
 Water your garden early in the day, before the sun is fully overhead. 
Watering late in the day can make plants susceptible to diseases that 
cause them to rot.
 
 Water at soil level to avoid water lost to wind. Watering the entire plant 
can cause fungal problems. (On a very hot day, however, watering the 
leaves can lower leaf temperatures.)
 
 No matter what kind of garden you have or which watering system you 
use, infrequent deep soakings are better than frequent shallow water-
ings, which cause roots to develop in the upper few inches of the soil, 
where they’re likely to dry out.
Hoses
Watering with a hose is probably the most common way that gardeners 
water. It’s simple, and some might say therapeutic. Who hasn’t seen a gar-
dener after a long day at work come home and take some time to hose down 
the garden with a cup of coffee or drink in hand? However, watering with a 
hose is wasteful and doesn’t saturate the ground evenly. And honestly, for a 
large garden, who enjoys hauling hoses around? A hose is great, however, for 
watering containers, individual, large plants, such as tomatoes, and in con-
junction with the basin method.
If you don’t have an outdoor spigot close to your garden for convenient hose 
hookup and watering, divert the rainwater from your roof to a rain barrel. In 
areas with plenty of rain, consider several barrels hooked up together to take 
the benefit of overflow. Various mail-order suppliers sell rain barrels.
 
To reduce drowning risks to pets and children, make sure you either get a 
barrel that’s tall enough to keep them out, or put a cover on the barrel. To 
keep mosquitoes, leaves, and debris out, cover with a screen. Most commer-
cial rain barrels only have a small opening at the top. Raise the barrel (con-
crete blocks work well) so that the spigot is high enough for a watering can 
to fit under, and to make hose attachment easy.
Sprinklers
A sprinkler is an effective way to water plants in sandy soil, which absorbs 
water quickly. However, if you have heavy clay soil that absorbs water slowly 
or if your garden is on a slope, the water may run off and not sink into the 
soil where the plants need it. Keep in mind that as taller plants such as corn 
and tomatoes grow, sprinklers tend to be less effective because the water 
hits and damages the foliage, while not thoroughly watering the soil. Also, a 
lot of water is lost to evaporation, especially on a windy day.

Soaker-hose irrigation
A soaker-hose system consists of a rubber hose perforated with tiny pores 
that leak water, as shown in Figure 5-1. You can lay the hose between rows 
or curve it around plants. Water leaks out of the hose and onto the soil, leav-
ing your plants dry and reducing evaporation. Its primary limitation is that it 
delivers water unevenly on sloped or uneven ground.
 
Figure 5-1:

hose.
 
Furrows
Furrows are shallow trenches between raised beds that channel water. The 
beds can be 1 to 3 feet apart — the wider apart they are, the more water you 
need. You use a hoe to dig a furrow at planting time and then plant the seeds 
or transplants on top of the raised beds, in between furrows. When you’re 
ready to water, fill the furrows completely with water and then wait a while, 
or fill them more than once so that the water penetrates down as well as side-
ways into the raised soil. Poke around with your finger to make sure that the 
water has penetrated the bed. Furrows work best in arid areas with clay soil, 
such as the Southwest, where streams or groundwater can be used in the 
garden, but little natural rain falls during the growing season. Furrows don’t 
work well in sandy soil because the water soaks in before it can reach the 
end of the furrow.

Drip irrigation
Drip irrigation systems are more efficient than furrow or standard overhead 
watering because they supply water exactly where it’s needed. They use 
small spray heads or spaghetti-like emitter tubes to drip water right onto the 
root zone of each plant. Drip irrigation works best for permanent plantings 
because it takes time to install the emitters for each plant.
Delivering water slowly and at ground level is good for many reasons:
 
 It encourages deep rooting.
 
 It eliminates many disease problems.
 
 It results in fewer weeds.
 
 It discourages runoff.
 
 It saves on the amount of water used.
Install drip irrigation after you’ve planted seeds or transplants. Drip irriga-
tion systems are available from garden or irrigation suppliers, or you can go 
to a plumbing supply store where they can help you lay out a system custom-
made for your garden.
Basins
A basin is a donut-like depression around a plant that you fill with water. 
You make a basin in a 2-foot diameter circle around the base of the plant. 
Basins work particularly well for watering sprawling plants like melons and 
squash early in the season. After the plants mature, however, their roots will 
grow out of the diameter of the basin, and this method won’t be effective any 
longer. For tomatoes and other vertical plants, they work well throughout the 
gardening season.
Automatic irrigation systems
Automatic irrigation systems take the work out of watering your garden by 
letting you program how often and how long you want the system on. Once 
you have one, you’ll never go back to hand watering and dragging hoses. 
Although more affordable today than ever before, the cost of materials and 
installation is pricey compared to the other options. Still, if you’re looking for 
convenience and consistency, the benefits outweigh the cost:
 
 Your plants get watered regardless of whether you remember to water 
or have the time. You can even program the system to water in early 
hours of the morning while you are asleep!
 
 By watering regularly, your plants won’t go through the dry spells that 
happen when you forget to water (or when the neighbor kid you hired to 
water while you were on vacation forgets to water). In addition, in times 
of drought, you are likely not to lose plants.

Gardening
 
 Preprogramming your system gives you quite a bit of control over how 
much water your plants get. Because you can individually program each 
station, you can ensure that the plants in different areas get the amount 
of water they need.
 
Automatic systems aren’t “set and forget.” You need to adjust them with the 
changing seasons, turning them off or cutting down watering time during wet 
seasons and increasing the time during dry seasons. Most importantly, install 
a rain sensor so that the irrigation is not on when it is raining.
Mulching Magic
Mulch is any material, organic or inorganic, that you place on the surface of 
soil, usually right over the root zone of growing plants. Mulch is a good gar-
dening habit but not mandatory. But, ooh boy, do the benefits make it worth 
the effort! Mulching your garden
 
 Inhibits weed germination and growth (and not only are weeds 
unsightly, but they also steal resources from your plants).
 
 Holds in soil moisture, protecting your plants from quickly drying out.
 
 In cold-winter areas, prevents frost-heaving, in which plants are literally 
pushed out of the ground by the natural expansion and contraction of 
the soil as it alternately thaws and freezes. (Do not apply winter mulch 
until the ground is frozen.)
 
 In hot-summer areas, helps keep plant roots cooler.
 
 Can provide much of the nutrition a plant needs if you use an organic 
mulch.
 
 Lessens the chances of certain diseases attacking your plants.
 
 Adds an attractive look to your garden.
Sound like good enough reasons to use mulch? Assuming you’re convinced, 
read on for the lowdown on mulches.
Knowing your mulches
First of all, there really isn’t any “right” or “best” mulch. Benefits vary in dif-
ferent climates and parts of the country. Some mulches are free, right in your 
own backyard; you can purchase others locally. When buying bagged mulch, 
look for the seal of the Mulch and Soil Council. It guarantees that mulch is 
what the label claims, and that it does not contain any toxic CCA from recy-
cled pressure-treated lumber. Table 5-1 provides the basic information you 
need to know about some of the more popular options.

How to apply mulch — and how much
Here’s what you need to know to ensure you get the most from your mulch 
year-round:
 
 When you plant: Applying mulch right after planting something is easy. 
Use a shovel or scoop with a trowel. Spread the mulch over the root-
zone area but not flush up against a plant’s base or main stem (which 
can smother it or invite pests or disease).

332
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
 Depth depends on the sort of plant. Annuals and perennials are fine with 
an inch or so of mulch; shrubs, roses, and trees need 3 or 4 inches or 
more. Vegetables in general need a 2- to 4-inch layer of mulch.
 
 During the growing season: Add more mulch midway through the grow-
ing season or whenever you notice the mulch appears depleted. You 
may have to get down on your knees or wriggle around a bit as you try 
to deliver it where it’s needed without harming the plant or its neigh-
bors. Again, use less for smaller plants, more for bigger ones.
 
 In the fall or for winter protection: Depending on the severity of your 
winters and the amount of snow cover you expect (a blanket of snow 
acts as a protective mulch, actually), you want to cover an overwin-
tering plant well after the ground has frozen (otherwise you keep the 
soil warm and the roots keep everything growing).You can cut down 
perennials first and then practically bury them under several inches of 
mulch. You shouldn’t trim back shrubs and rosebushes at this time, but 
you don’t have to be as careful as you were with midsummer mulching 
because the plant is no longer growing actively. For freezing winters, 6 
or more inches around the base of these is a good amount.
 
These amounts are guidelines only. You have to tailor them to your climate, 
growing season, and specific plants.
Using Fertilizer in Your Edible Garden
Even if you have the healthiest soil around, growing fruits and vegetables is 
an intensive process that takes many important nutrients from the soil. So 
you need to add some fertilizer to your soil to keep it in optimum shape to 
feed your plants. How much fertilizer you add depends on the soil and the 
plants you’re growing.
Determining your soil’s nutrient needs
Sixteen elements are essential for healthy plant growth, along with energy 
from sunlight for photosynthesis, the process by which plants use carbon 
dioxide from the air and water from the soil to produce sugars that enable 
them to grow. Plants require nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in rela-
tively large quantities. Plants take up these three nutrients — often called 
macronutrients or primary nutrients — from the soil. If your soil doesn’t con-
tain enough of these nutrients, you can supply them by fertilizing. However, if 
the soil pH isn’t right, these and other elements get locked up in the soil.
The following sections explain how to tell whether your soil has too much or 
too little of these particular nutrients.

333
 Chapter 5: Maintaining Your Edible Garden
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
 
Get your soil tested. Do-it-yourself kits are readily available, but a profes-
sional testing is best. Check with your local cooperative extension service; it 
may perform one at little or no cost. A good soil test will give you the soil pH 
and a nutrient analysis, including suggestions for amending the soil. Taking 
samples from each garden area is a good idea because the pH can vary 
greatly around your property. For instance, concrete foundations leach cal-
cium, which makes the soil alkaline.
Nitrogen
Nitrogen (N) is responsible for the healthy green color of your plants. It 
easily moves around in the soil and can leach away from plant roots as a 
result of rain or watering. Therefore, you need to be sure that your plants 
receive a steady supply of nitrogen all season long.
Plants with a nitrogen deficiency show yellowing (in older leaves first) and 
slowed growth. With plants like tomatoes, a nitrogen deficiency may first 
appear as a reddening of the stems and the undersides of the leaves. A plant 
with too much nitrogen has soft-textured, succulent growth that attracts 
aphids and other insects. Because nitrogen leaches out of the soil quickly, 
if you have too much, stop fertilizing, wait, and eventually the problem will 
solve itself.
You can supplement soil nitrogen by adding compost; decomposing organic 
matter (leaf mold or well-rotted manure); organic fertilizers, such as blood 
meal and cottonseed meal; or chemical fertilizers.
Phosphorus
Phosphorus (P) helps promote good root growth, increased disease resis-
tance, and fruit and seed formation. Plants lacking in phosphorus are stunted 
and sport dark green foliage and purplish stems and leaves (on the older 
leaves first). Phosphorus is not available to plants in soils with a high pH; 
lime to lower it to a pH of 6 to 7.5 to make it available.
Sources of phosphorus include minerals, organic matter, inorganic fertil-
izers (such as rock phosphate), and organic fertilizers (such as bone meal). 
Unlike nitrogen, phosphorus doesn’t move quickly through soil, so add a 
fertilizer containing phosphorus to the root zone before planting, instead 
of sprinkling it on the soil surface. Side-dressing is a waste of money and 
resources.
Potassium
Potassium (K), also called potash, promotes vigorous growth and resistance 
to disease and cold. A deficiency is hard to diagnose; often once it’s recog-
nized, it’s too late to save the plant. Soil minerals provide potassium, as do 
organic matter (wood ash) and inorganic fertilizers, such as potassium sul-
fate and granite dust.

334
Book III: Edible Gardening 
Calcium, magnesium, and sulfur
Calcium, magnesium, and sulfur are known as secondary nutrients. Plants 
need them, but not to the same extent that they need nitrogen, phosphorus, 
and potassium. Most alkaline soils contain these elements naturally, and few 
soils are deficient in sulfur. Most home garden soils contain these nutrients, 
but you can do specific tests on the leaves to detect any deficiencies.
In regions where the soil is acidic, liming to keep your soil’s pH in a good 
growth range provides adequate calcium and magnesium. Epsom salts pro-
vide magnesium, which makes long stems (like roses and tomatoes) strong. 
Micronutrients
Micronutrients (iron, manganese, copper, boron, molybdenum, chlorine, 
and zinc) are elements that plants need in tiny amounts. Too much of one of 
these elements is often as harmful as too little.
A micronutrient deficiency or excess may mean that your soil is too acidic or 
too alkaline, so you can correct the problem by changing the pH rather than 
by adding more nutrients. Sometimes, changing the pH sufficiently to increase 
micronutrient levels isn’t practical, or you may need to give a plant a micronu-
trient quickly while you try to change the soil pH. In such cases, micronutrients 
are applied as chelates (from the Latin word for claw). Chelates are added to 
other chemicals, in this case micronutrients, to keep them available to plants 
when soil conditions are unfavorable. Apply chelated micronutrients to your 
soil, or, better yet, spray them on plant foliage.
Choosing a fertilizer: Chemical or organic
You have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of chemical and 
organic fertilizers to decide which products are best suited to your needs 
and preferences.
Chemical fertilizers
Chemical fertilizers are synthetically manufactured. They include elements 
such as sodium nitrate, potassium chloride, and superphosphate. Chemical 
fertilizers come in liquid, granular, powder, or pellet form, and choosing a 
form is a matter of personal preference. If you want to fertilize when you 
water with a watering can, use a liquid fertilizer. If you want to sprinkle some 
fertilizer around each plant, use a granular fertilizer or pellets.
Here are the advantages of chemical fertilizers:
 
 Chemical fertilizers are widely available, relatively inexpensive, and easy 
to store, and vary widely in formulations and forms, so you can tailor a 
fertilizer program to your soil and plants.

335
 Chapter 5: Maintaining Your Edible Garden
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
 
 Most chemical fertilizers are rapidly available to plants. The exception is 
fertilizer that has been manufactured in slow-release form, in which case 
the fertilizer pellets break down and release the fertilizer slowly.
 
 A liquid or a dry powder chemical fertilizer that you mix with water is 
completely soluble, and its nutrients are quickly available to plants — 
an advantage when plants need a quick boost, such as right after 
transplanting.
Here are the disadvantages of using chemical fertilizers:
 
 Chemical fertilizers add no organic matter to your soil and contribute 
nothing to improving soil structure.
 
 Because chemical fertilizers are more concentrated than natural fertil-
izers, they can have a greater effect on soil pH, which can damage soil 
microorganisms.
 
 Manufacturing chemical fertilizers requires large amounts of energy, 
usually supplied by nonrenewable resources. Though not directly 
impacting your garden, producing chemical fertilizers does place a 
strain on the overall environment.
 
 Most chemical fertilizers are a quick fix for plants.
 
 Adding chemical fertilizers to lawns in early spring causes them to green 
up earlier, requiring earlier and more frequent mowing.
Organic fertilizers
Natural fertilizers — animal and green manure, compost, blood meal, kelp, 
fish emulsion (hydrolyzed fish is even better), cottonseed meal, granite dust, 
and rock phosphate — have several advantages:
 
 Many natural fertilizers contribute organic matter to your soil, improv-
ing its structure, and they can contribute micronutrients.
 
 Most natural fertilizers supply a slow but steady diet for plants.
 
 Some natural fertilizers, such as manure, may be inexpensive.
Here are some disadvantages to using organic fertilizers:
 
 Some organic fertilizers are bulky and hard to store and transport.
 
 Their slow release of nutrients, in some cases dependent on the action 
of soil microorganisms, may not provide plants with an adequate nutri-
ent supply when it’s needed.
 
 Complete organic fertilizers are available; as with complete chemical 
fertilizers, the three major nutrients are present, but usually in a lower 
concentration, such as 1-2-1. Don’t let the low numbers fool you; in the 
long run, they provide plenty of nutrients.

336
Book III: Edible Gardening 
Understanding a fertilizer label
Commercial fertilizers are labeled with three numbers, which indicate the 
fertilizer’s nutrient content. The first number indicates the percentage of 
nitrogen, the second number shows the percentage of phosphorus, and the 
third number represents the percentage of potassium. For example, a 5-10-10 
fertilizer contains 5 percent nitrogen, 10 percent phosphorus, and 10 percent 
potassium. It’s called a complete fertilizer because it contains some of each 
type of nutrient. In contrast, bone meal has an analysis of 4-12-0. It’s a good 
source of phosphorus but doesn’t provide any potassium. The other materi-
als in a commercial fertilizer that the analysis numbers don’t account for are 
generally filler — unimportant materials that add bulk to the bag so that the 
fertilizer is easier to spread.
How much to use? Soil tests are the best way to correct deficiencies, but 
fertilizer bags also give general dosage recommendations for gardens. Most 
fertilizer recommendations for maintenance fertilization (rather than to cor-
rect a deficiency) are made according to how much nitrogen a crop needs. If 
you have a recommendation for 3 pounds of 5-10-10 fertilizer per 100 square 
feet, but the fertilizer you have on hand is 5-10-5 fertilizer, apply 3 pounds of 
5-10-5. Even though the 5-10-5 fertilizer’s percentage of potassium is less than 
that of the 5-10-10, it offers the recommended amount of nitrogen.
Side-dressing
Depending on the type of fertilizer you use, the crops you grow, and the type 
of soil you have, you may need to add repeat doses of fertilizer throughout 
the growing season — a practice called side-dressing. For example, because 
Using wood ashes to provide nutrients
Wood ashes are a source of potash and phos-
phate, although the exact amounts of these 
nutrients depend on the type of wood burned 
(hardwoods generally contain more nutrients 
than softwoods), the degree of combustion, 
and where the wood was stored (for example, 
dry storage prevents nutrient leaching). A gen-
eral analysis is usually in the range of 0 percent 
nitrogen, 1 to 2 percent phosphate, and 4 to 10 
percent potash. But the major benefit of wood 
ashes is as a liming agent to raise the pH of the 
soil. Naturally, if you live in an area where soils 
are alkaline, don’t use wood ashes as a soil 
amendment; they raise the pH even higher.
Apply wood ashes to your soil in moderation 
(no more than 10 to 20 pounds per 1,000 square 
feet of garden) because they may contain small 
amounts of heavy metals, such as cadmium 
and copper. These metals build up in plants if 
you add too much wood ash to the soil and can 
kill the plants — or harm you, if you eat lots of 
those plants.

337
 Chapter 5: Maintaining Your Edible Garden
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
sandy soils don’t hold nutrients well, giving plants small, regular fertilizer 
applications ensures a steady supply of nutrients. If you use a slow-release 
fertilizer, you may not need to side-dress until late in the season (if at all); 
check the label on the fertilizer package for details.
Both chemical and natural fertilizers can be used for side-dressing. A 5-10-10 
fertilizer is a good choice for many crops. Use 1 to 2 tablespoons per plant, or 
1 to 2 pounds for every 25 feet in a row, depending on the size of your plants.
 
Too much fertilizer can be more harmful than too little. Excess fertilizer 
accumulates in the soil in the form of salts and damages plant roots. Be sure 
that growing conditions enable plants to use the fertilizer that you apply. 
For example, don’t add fertilizer during a dry spell if you can’t irrigate your 
garden, because without adequate soil moisture, roots can’t take up nutri-
ents. And if cool weather causes your plants to grow slowly, go easy on the 
fertilizer until the temperature warms up.
The kind of plants that you grow makes a difference in how much you 
side-dress. Plants that take a long time to mature (such as tomatoes and 
eggplants) and heavy feeders (like corn) generally benefit more from side-
dressing than quick-maturing crops, such as lettuce, or legumes like peas 
and beans, that fix their own nitrogen. See Table 5-2 for some general side-
dressing guidelines.

Waging War on Weeds
A weed is any plant that’s growing where you don’t want it to. Some weeds 
are worse than others, but in general, you don’t want any weeds in your 
garden because they compete with your plants for light, water, and nutrients. 
If you have a lot of weeds, you’ll have weaker plants and a less substantial 
harvest. Besides, weeds look terrible.

339
 Chapter 5: Maintaining Your Edible Garden
Book III
Edible 
Gardening
The key to battling weeds is to get to them early before they’re firmly estab-
lished. When they’re young, weeds are easier to pull and less likely to pro-
duce seeds that cause problems down the road.
Battling weeds before planting
You can reduce weeds in your vegetable beds many different ways. The follow-
ing sections explain some things that you can do before planting your garden.
Planning for easy weeding
This is an I-know-I’ll-never-be-rid-of-them-so-I-might-as-well-make-my-life-
easier ploy. Simply leave enough room between rows so that you can weed 
the soil easily.
Solarizing the soil
When you solarize the soil, you use the power of the sun to kill weeds. This 
technique works best in the middle of summer. The only downside to solar-
izing is that it takes a while and it kills all the living organisms in the soil. 
Follow these steps to solarize your soil:
 
1. Prepare your bed for planting (or cut existing weeds down to ground 
level) and water it well.
 
2. Dig a 6-to-12-inch-deep trench around the perimeter of the bed.
 
3. Cover the entire bed with thick clear plastic (4 mil) and place the 
edges of the plastic in the trenches. Fill the trenches with soil, and 
then wait.
 
 The temperature gets so hot underneath the plastic that it kills insects, 
disease organisms, and weeds. It usually takes a few months of solariz-
ing to get a beneficial effect.
Battling weeds after planting
After planting, you have several choices for reducing weeds:
 
 Mulch. Applying a good thick organic mulch is one of the best ways to 
battle weeds. Even if mulch doesn’t smother the weeds and their seeds, 
the weeds that do come up are easy to pull. Planting through black plas-
tic is also a very effective way to keep weeds from becoming a problem. 
See “Mulching Magic,” earlier in this chapter, for more on mulch.
 
 Pull the weeds by hand. While they’re young, weeds come out of the 
ground easily. Get ’em, roots and all, whenever you see them.

340
Book III: Edible Gardening 
 
 Cultivate. Simply hoeing or lightly turning the soil between vegetables 
exposes the weeds’ roots and kills many of them. Cultivating is most 
effective when it’s done often (a few times a week in the first month or 
so of gardening) and when the weeds are small. You can find cultivating 
tools designed especially for this purpose.
 
 Keep garden paths clean. Try to keep your garden paths as weed-free 
as possible; otherwise, weeds will creep into your planting beds. Try 
covering the paths with a thick mulch to keep weeds from becoming 
established.
Air! Air! Plants Need Air!
A sometimes overlooked necessity for plant life is air (and not just carbon 
dioxide). Without air, plants struggle and perish. Yes, the free oxygen in the 
air is part of the photosynthesis recipe, produced by the plants themselves, 
but another practicality is even more visible here. Air movement around 
your plants prevents disease, especially fungal diseases that gain a foothold 
when the air is too “close” and humid and when wet leaves can’t dry or 
don’t dry quickly.
Underground, oxygen between the particles of soil is important. Plant roots 
or, more accurately, their little root hairs, are busy. They take in that oxygen, 
absorb water, and then release carbon dioxide. If this process is thwarted, as 
it is in waterlogged soil, the roots can’t function properly. They begin to rot, 
and the plant surely suffers.
Short of setting up a fan in your garden, here’s what you can do to make sure 
your plants are getting plenty of air:
 
 Don’t let soil get compacted. If it’s quite wet, don’t walk on it or dig in it. 
Loose soil is airy soil.
 
 Add organic matter. You’ve heard it before, but it bears repeating. The 
addition of organic matter, especially in dense clay soil, helps keep it 
aerated.
 
 Never kill an earthworm. Earthworms help break up and aerate your 
soil. Rejoice in their presence! Welcome them!
 
 Make sure your garden is well-drained. If you have standing water or 
find an area that’s always damp, figure out what the drainage problem is 
and fix it.
 
 Don’t crowd your plants together in the garden bed if they’re suscep-
tible to mildew or black spot. Give everyone a little elbow room!

a knife, and build a fire — simple skills that make you a more confident and 
safer person outdoors. And because the allure of the outdoors is its combina-
tion of beauty and unpredictability, this chapter includes some general sur-
vival skills, too.
Tying Basic Knots
Ropes and knots are as much a part of any skilled outdoor adventurer’s arse-
nal as a knife, a compass, and some waterproof matches. With just a little 
rope-tying know-how, you can modify and even secure your world. You can 
attach a boat to your car rack, take up the slack in a sagging tent line, secure 
a person to a rope in a rescue situation — the list is endless.
Which knots are best? Well, literally thousands of different knots exist (some 
obsessed knot-tiers with entirely too much time on their hands claim that 
there are more than 4,000), each with its own purpose and use. Be thank-
ful that this chapter limits your skill-set requirements to a few basic knots 
that (if tied properly) should see you through almost any situation you may 
encounter outdoors.

Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
The accompanying illustrations are the best means for figuring out how to tie 
the knots. Study them along with the descriptions and then practice, prac-
tice, practice.
 
To make matters easier, this chapter uses a few simple terms:
 
 Running end: The shorter or active end of the rope that you weave in 
and out of the knot.
 
 Standing end: The longest and least active end of the rope. It’s the 
opposite end of the rope from the running end.
 
 Bight: Simply, a bend in the rope.
 
 Stopper knot: A knot designed to stop a rope from sliding through a 
loop, hole, or, in the case of climbing, a descending device. (Rappelling 
off the end of a rope isn’t impossible and is no laughing matter.) The 
basic overhand knot is most typically used as a stopper.
Bowline
The bowline, shown in Figure 1-1, is best known to sailors and climbers. As 
a climber’s knot, the bowline has its roots in the days when a climber tied 
directly into a rope with a loop around his waist. As such, the bowline is still 
a very useful knot to know for rescue situations — or any time you need to 
tie a secure loop in the end of a rope (meaning a tight knot that won’t come 
undone). To tie a bowline, do the following:
 
1. Form a small loop by crossing one end of the rope over the other.
 
2. Bring the running end of the rope up through the bottom of the loop, 
around the stopper end of the rope, and then back down through 
the loop.
 
3. Pull taut.
 
“The rabbit comes out of the hole, around the tree, and back down the hole 
again” is the chant often used by folks remembering how to tie this knot. 
The hole is the small loop you form by crossing one end of the rope over the 
other. The rabbit is the rope’s running end.
Clove hitch
Used most often to secure tent lines to poles or stakes (and sometimes as a 
temporary mooring line for a canoe or kayak), the clove hitch is a classic out-
door knot (see Figure 1-2). Here’s how to make a clove hitch:

345
 Chapter 1: Basic Camp Skills
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
1. Take the running end of the rope and wrap it once around the pole, 
fence post, or stake, passing it under the standing end before complet-
ing the wrap.
 
2. Continue around the post, pole, or stake once more — this time going 
above the standing end with the running end.
 
3. After completing the second wrap, feed the running end back through 
itself and above the standing end wrapped around the pole and then 
pull tight.
 
 You can add security to the line by adding a stopper knot at the end of 
the rope’s running end so that it can’t pull through on itself.

Bowline.

Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Fisherman’s knot
The fisherman’s knot, which has been called many names over the centuries, 
including a waterman’s knot, is designed to attach two lengths of rope of equal 
diameters securely together to form a longer length of rope (see Figure 1-3). To 
tie a fisherman’s knot, follow these instructions:
 
1. Begin by placing the two ends of two ropes next to each other.
 
2. Pass the running end of Rope 1 under the running end of Rope 2, pass 
it back over the top of both ropes, push it up through the loop you just 
formed, and pull tight.
 
3. Take the running end of Rope 2 and pass it under the running end 
of Rope 1 (behind the knot you just formed) and over the top of both 
ropes before pushing it up through the loop you just formed.
 
4. Pull the two knots together by pulling in opposite directions on the 
standing ends of each rope.

Fisherman’s 
knot.

Figure eight
Like its name implies, the figure eight knot forms a figure eight in the rope 
(see Figure 1-4). This knot is used as a stopper knot at the end of a rope or as 
a means to prevent a rope from unraveling. Here’s how to tie a figure eight:
 
1. Cross the running end of the rope over the standing end.
 
2. Wrap the running end around the standing end.
 
3. Feed that end back through the loop you just formed.
 
Figure 1-4: 
Figure eight.
 
Figure eight threaded
Like its cousin, the figure eight threaded knot forms a figure eight in the rope 
with a loop below the knot (see Figure 1-5). You can use this knot to tie into a 
climbing harness or to create a secure loop for pulling or hauling items. The 
figure eight threaded also forms part of the trucker’s hitch described later in 
this chapter. Follow these steps to construct the figure eight threaded:
 
1. Cross the running end of the rope over the standing end.
 
2. Wrap the running end around the standing end and then feed that 
end back through the loop you just formed.
 
3. Form a bight in the running end below the eight and begin threading 
the running end back through the loop, retracing the rope as it winds 
and twists through the original eight.
 
 Be careful to follow the path exactly so that the running end parallels 
and pairs up with itself on the original knot, exiting back toward the 
standing end.

348
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
 
4. Add a stopper knot to prevent the running end from slipping.
 
Figure 1-5: 
Figure eight 
threaded.
 
Two half hitches and two 
half hitches slipped
One of the most widely used knots for hanging objects from branches, posts, 
poles, and so on, the half hitch is easy to tie. Here’s how:
 
1. Wrap the running end of the rope around the object you’re securing 
it to.
 
2. Feed the running end around the standing end and then back up, or 
through the loop you formed between the pole, post, or branch and 
the rope.
 
 Congratulations! You’ve just completed one half hitch.
 
3. Wrap another loop around the standing end of the rope below the 
first hitch to create two half hitches (a more secure knot, as shown in 
Figure 1-6).

349
 Chapter 1: Basic Camp Skills
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
To create a quick-to-untie knot, slip the knot. To do this, create a bight in the 
running end of the rope and feed the bight through the loop, leaving the last 
inch or so of the running end sticking out (see Figure 1-7). A quick tug on the 
running end releases the knot.

Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Round turn and two half hitches
This knot is best used to fasten large items to a roof rack (you can also use 
the trucker’s hitch, described later in this chapter, for that purpose, although 
that knot isn’t as versatile); to secure a boat to a mooring overnight; or to 
fasten a line to a beam, post, or branch when you want the line to be able to 
support a heavy load. To form this knot, follow these instructions:
 
1. Wrap the running end of the rope around the beam, post, or branch 
twice.
 
2. Secure the running end to the standing end with two half hitches (see 
Figure 1-8).
 
 Refer to the preceding section for guidance on forming two half hitches.
 
Figure 1-8: 
Round turn 
and two half 
hitches.
 
Constrictor knot
People often use the constrictor knot (see Figure 1-9) to close sacks and bags 
whose drawcords have worn out or disappeared. The constrictor knot also 
works great on the end of a rope to prevent it from unraveling, or as a rope 
clamp to hold two items firmly together. Here’s how to form this handy knot:
 
1. Wrap the running end around your desired object once, passing it 
under the standing end to form one wrap.
 
 Be sure to leave this first wrap loose enough to form a slight loop.

351
 Chapter 1: Basic Camp Skills
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
2. Complete a second wrap, this time above the first wrap so that the 
running end crosses over the standing end.
 
 Feed the running end back under itself as you complete this wrap.
 
3. Pass the running end up through the loop formed by the first loose 
wrap and then pull both ends of the rope snug.
 
 If you want to be able to easily untie the knot, slip it by putting a bight in 
the running end. Then pass this bight through the loop formed by your 
first wrap.
 
Figure 1-9: 
Constrictor 
knot.
 
Taut line hitch
Probably the most important knot to know for securing lines that tend to 
loosen or sag over time, such as tent guy lines and clotheslines, the taut line 
hitch (see Figure 1-10) can hold securely in one direction but be easily slid 
in the other. Consider it a sort of rope ratchet. Follow these instructions to 
create the taut line hitch:
 
1. Wrap the running end of the rope around a tent stake, post, pole, or 
branch.
 
2. Wrap the running end around the standing end twice (toward the 
stake, post, pole, or branch) and then make a second wrap.
 
3. Feed the running end of the rope under the standing end above the 
wraps, around the standing end, and then back through the loop you 
just formed.
 
 The running end should now point away from the stake, post, pole, or 
branch and toward the standing end.
 
4. Pull tightly to secure.

352

Trucker’s hitch
What person hasn’t tied the nightmare knot on a luggage rack or truck bed? 
You know the one — all twists, tucks, bends, and overlaps with no logic or 
hope of ever actually untying the thing when you need to release the load. 
Well, help is at hand. Here’s how to tie the trucker’s hitch, which is really 
three knots in one (see Figure 1-11).
 
1. Start with a bowline or figure eight and tighten, leaving about a loop 
about 5 inches in diameter below the knot.
 
 Refer to earlier sections for guidance on tying a bowline or figure 
eight knot.
 
2. Toss the end of the rope without the bowline or figure eight in it over 
the item you want to secure and bring it back around.
 
3. Pull the slack out of the rope by holding onto the bowline or figure 
eight loop.
 
4. Twist the free end of the rope as illustrated, forming a loop.
 
5. Bend the free end of the rope above the loop to form a bight, push the 
bight through, and give it a quick tug.
 
 The quick tug tightens the first loop around the bend, forming a new loop.
 
6. Pass the free end through the bowline or figure eight loop and back 
down through the loop; then pull.
 
 As you pull the rope through and it tightens, the loop binds on the rope, 
securing it under tension. You can secure any load under extreme ten-
sion this way.

353

7. Tie off the end of the rope (as a final precaution) by using two half 
hitches slipped.
 
 See the earlier section for guidance on forming two half hitches slipped.

Knife Sharpening 101
Numerous guidebooks, articles, and how-to instruction manuals address the 
importance of knives as tools for outdoorsy folks, yet few also speak about 
knife sharpening. Why? Doesn’t anyone use knives anymore? It’s a fact that 
as a knife blade gets used, it grows dull and less efficient. Perhaps people use 
their knives until they dull and then buy new ones, although that’s doubt-
ful. It stands to reason, then, that if you own a knife, you should also own a 
sharpening tool, such as a simple Arkansas stone.
Using a sharpening stone
An Arkansas stone, a type of sharpening stone, is a relatively thin, 3-inch-long 
rectangular block of stone that’s typically coarse to the touch on one side and 
fine on the other. A stone is perfectly flat on each side and rough enough — 
like sandpaper — that you can work out the burrs, knicks, and dull areas of a 
knife’s blade quite easily. The fine side of the Arkansas stone is for finishing 
your work and putting a nice, smooth edge on your knife.

354
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
To sharpen a blade, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the angle you want to achieve.
 
 Most pocket knives should be sharpened at a 20- to 25-degree angle. 
See the next section “Getting a good angle” for help in determining what 
angle you need.
 
2. Smoothly and with even pressure, begin moving the blade in an even, 
circular motion without lifting it from the stone. Complete several full 
rotations in a counterclockwise direction first.
 
 A circular motion produces the most consistent edge. The closer you 
maintain a consistent angle throughout the sharpening process, the better 
the edge you’ll achieve. With a little practice, you’ll find it’s easy to do.
 
 Count the number of rotations you make! You’ll do the other side the 
same number of times but in the opposite direction.
 
3. Turn the blade over and make the same number of smooth, circular 
motions in a clockwise direction.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until you have the edge you want.
 
Some people douse hand stones with oil or water before and during sharpen-
ing. The idea is to keep the metal shavings and bits of stone in suspension 
so they don’t clog the sharpening stone and affect its honing efficiency. Yet 
an increasing number of knife experts recommend that you don’t use oil or 
water on your hand stone. Sharpen your blades dry, and you achieve maxi-
mum performance from both the stone and the knife.
 
A sharpening stone should be flat in order to do its job effectively. However, 
the grinding process wears a noticeable belly or curvature in sharpening 
stones over time. You can tune your stones periodically by rubbing them 
back and forth on 100-grit silicon carbide sandpaper placed on an absolutely 
flat surface. If after performing this first aid to your stone you still notice a 
curvature, say good-bye to it and purchase a new one.
Getting a good angle
Contrary to myth, the angle of a blade’s cutting edge has nothing to do with 
sharpness — larger- and smaller-angled cutting edges are equally sharp. 
The angle at which you choose to sharpen a blade (see Figure 1-12), and 
consequently the angle to which the cutting edge gets ground, affects the 
durability and drag of the cutting edge. In other words, the smaller the angle, 
the less drag, but the more delicate the cutting edge will be. A larger angle 
means more blade drag but also more durability — less frequent sharpening 
is required.

355
 Chapter 1: Basic Camp Skills
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
Knife experts recommend the following sharpening angles as a guide:
 
 11 to 15 degrees: Highly delicate edge for hobby knives, woodcarving 
tools, and specialty blades. This type of blade requires frequent 
sharpening.
 
 15 to 17 degrees: A moderately delicate edge used in fillet, boning, 
and other thin specialty blades. This type of blade requires frequent 
sharpening.
 
 17 to 20 degrees: Common angle for kitchen knives. The frequency of 
sharpening depends on what you’re cutting.
 
 20 to 25 degrees: Wider bevel and more durable edge intended for pocket 
knives, folding hunting knives, fixed-blade field knives, and serrated knife 
blades. These types have a durable and long-lasting cutting edge.
 
 25 to 30 degrees: Widest bevel and longest lasting of the edges. These 
types are only intended for heavy-duty use (think utility knives for cut-
ting cardboard, carpet, wire, and linoleum).
 
Figure 1-12:

sharpen-
ing angle

how you’ll 
use the 
blade and 
how often

sharpen it.
 
Easier sharpening
Is it possible to maintain an exact angle with 
only a sharpening stone? Yes, but only with 
lots of practice. A far better solution is to outfit 
yourself with a knife-sharpening system. With 
a specially engineered clamp and angle guide, 
anyone — even a youngster — can precisely 
sharpen a knife blade to a desired angle. GATCO 
and Lansky Sharpeners are two of a number of 
companies offering specialty knife-sharpening 
systems. Suggested retail prices range from 
about $40 to $100.

Building a Campfire Safely 
and Responsibly
Fires were once necessary for survival, but for the most part, this fact is no 
longer true. In today’s world, people cook with stoves, shed light with lan-
terns, and provide warmth through shelter and clothing. However, mankind 
may never shake the romantic appeal of a crackling fire deep in the woods 
under a star-flecked sky. For those intoxicated with the thrills of adventure, 
the campfire serves as an after-dark elixir — warmly coaxing forward camara-
derie, tall tales, and quiet reflections. The following sections explain how to 
build a safe, efficient campfire — and how to clean it up when you’re ready to 
move on.
Choosing a site for the fire
When selecting the site for your campfire, pick an area that’s free from 
ground debris, roots, and other vegetation that may catch fire and spread the 
flame to surrounding trees. Don’t build a fire under overhanging tree limbs or 
within 10 to 15 feet of any shelter. Building a fire in a cave or next to wet or 
damp rocks is also dangerous because water or moisture in the rocks can be 
brought to the boiling point, causing steam to expand and explode the rock, 
much like a bomb.
 
Try to find an area that has natural wind breaks and clear it of all loose 
debris. If your campsite has a preexisting fire ring or pit, then use that. Don’t 
build a fire in a new site where a fire ring already exists, even if it isn’t in the 
most ideal location aesthetically.
Selecting firewood
Pick the right kind of firewood, and your campfire will not only burn brightly 
and warmly but also with less smoke and greater cooking efficiency. 
Remember that every fire starts with patience and kindling — not necessarily 
in that order. Your kindling should be made up of very small, dry twigs that, 
when lit using a firestarter, will catch fire quickly and help to start the flame 
eating into the larger wood.
Each type of wood has its own special characteristics that lend themselves 
to particular types of fires. If you know how to identify various trees and the 
deadwood lying around them, you’ll soon be building fires that are the envy 
of everyone.

357
 Chapter 1: Basic Camp Skills
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
Following are some important characteristics to remember when choosing 
your firewood:
 
 Aspen is moderately difficult to ignite, has fair cooking characteristics, 
throws off a moderate number of sparks, produces very little smoke, 
and adds nice flavor to fish and meat.
 
 Birch is very easy to ignite, has fair cooking characteristics, throws off a 
moderate number of sparks, produces moderate amounts of smoke, and 
adds nice flavor to fish and meat.
 
 Fir is very easy to ignite, has poor cooking characteristics, throws off 
large quantities of sparks, produces heavy smoke, and isn’t advised for 
cooking.
 
 Maple is difficult to ignite, has excellent cooking characteristics, throws 
off very few sparks, produces very little smoke, and adds a very nice 
flavor to fish and meat.
 
 Oak is difficult to ignite, has excellent cooking characteristics, throws 
off very few sparks, produces very little smoke, and adds a nice, subtle 
flavor to fish and meat.
 
 Pine is very easy to ignite, has poor cooking characteristics, throws off 
large quantities of sparks, produces heavy smoke, and isn’t advised for 
cooking.
 
 Spruce is very easy to ignite, has poor cooking characteristics, throws 
off large quantities of sparks, produces heavy smoke, and isn’t advised 
for cooking.
Gathering firewood responsibly
Let the following tips guide you as you choose firewood:
 
 Never cut down trees or branches, living or apparently dead. To do so 
can cause irreparable harm to the tree and disrupt an available habitat 
for animals. And it’s illegal in most regions anyway.
 
 Select only wood that’s 1 to 2 inches in diameter and lying broken on 
the ground. (Figure 1-13 gives you an idea of sizes.) This wood is more 
readily consumed by the flames, resulting in hotter coals and a better 
fire for cooking and heating.
 
 Always gather your wood away from camp. Doing so helps to prevent 
immediate depletion of vital wood resources lying around the camp area.

Constructing the fire
Every campfire must be constructed in some way. In the case of both drive-in 
and backcountry campgrounds, where fire rings (circles of rocks that enclose 
fire sites to prevent embers and coals from scattering) or designated fire pits 
already exist, your fire-building tasks are limited to constructing a fire that 
provides hot coals for cooking or flames for warming.
If a fire site or location doesn’t exist and the area you’re camping in permits 
the building of fires, then you need to construct a place to start your fire. You 
can see descriptions for building mound fires or pit fires, and also using a 
fire pan, later in this chapter. In all cases, be sure to build a fire that’s small 
enough to be easily scattered after the coals are cool and then covered over 
or removed before you leave. Why? So that the next person who follows in 
your steps can experience the joy of discovering a wild place without finding 
evidence of your passing.
 
Because you have to clean up the campfire when you’re done, stop adding 
wood to the flames approximately one hour before finishing the fire. Keep 
pushing the partially burned pieces of larger wood into the center or hottest 
coals of the fire. You may find that you need to add very small pieces of

359
 Chapter 1: Basic Camp Skills
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
  
wood, twigs, and the like, to keep the fire hot enough to consume any larger 
sections of wood. Also, because cleaning up a fire immediately after you’ve 
doused the flames is infinitely more difficult, don’t build a campfire in the 
morning. For info on cleaning up your campfire, head to the later section 
“Cleaning up your fire.”
Teepee fire
The teepee fire, shown in Figure 1-14, is the very best fire for quick lighting, 
even in severe weather. It puts out a tremendous amount of heat, even with a 
relatively small fire, and is quite easy to maintain.
Follow these steps to build a teepee fire:
 
1. Bunch up a ball of frayed bark, dried grasses, and tiny twigs from a 
pine tree, evergreen, or other available tree, along with your fire-start-
ing materials (if you have them).
 
2. Lay very small twigs and sticks — not much larger than the kindling — 
against one another and over the ball to form a teepee shape.
 
 Leave a small opening through which you can place a match to ignite 
the fire.
Creative fire-starting materials
Sure, you can light a fire with one match, but 
pack along some home-remedy kindling and 
some waterproof matches anyway. Why? 
Because they’ll light the fire when things don’t 
go exactly according to plan — like when 
Mother Nature opens the fire hose on your 
camp and douses your fire-building plans. Try 
carrying a lighter and an old plastic film canister 
filled with wooden strike-anywhere matches. 
As for starting materials, here are a few ideas 
to get the flames roaring in no time:
  Commercial firestarters such as fire ribbon 
or petroleum-based tablets (Esbit by MPI 
Outdoors, for example) work very well.
  Fill each hole of an old egg carton with 
shredded newspaper and several spoonfuls 
of sawdust. Pour in melted paraffin (wax) 
to bind the sawdust and newspaper into a 
solid lump. After the wax hardens, you have 
one dozen wax-based firestarters.
  Fill a film canister with lint from your drier. 
(Make sure that the lint comes from wool, 
cotton, and fleece and not fire-retardant 
fabrics.)
  Look to nature. Even in the worst storm, you 
can find dry tinder around the base of tree 
trunks, under rock ledges, in tree hollows, 
and next to downed logs.
  Make your own kindling from a larger log 
that’s soaked on the outside but dry on the 
inside by whittling down to the dry center. 
Whittle dry shavings from this piece.

360
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
 
3. Continue adding more wood, gradually longer and thicker (up to the 
width of two fingers).
 
 Maintain the shape of a teepee at all times.
 
4. After the teepee is built to your satisfaction, carefully strike a match, 
shield it from the wind, and place it next to the waiting ball of kin-
dling to ignite it.
 
Figure 1-14: 
Teepee fire.
 
Larger sticks
Small twigs

When adding wood, lay each piece carefully into the flame and always keep 
the shape of the teepee intact. Don’t toss or arbitrarily throw wood on a fire 
because at best doing so sends up a shower of sparks, creating a fire and 
safety hazard, and at worst it can destroy the fire.
Pit fire
Use a pit fire (see Figure 1-15) only where ground vegetation won’t be dam-
aged or where there are only a few inches of underlying duff (the dead layer 
of leaves, plants, and needles covering the forest floor). You make a pit fire 
by digging a shallow hole where the mineral soil is exposed and the duff is 
cleared away, making cleanup easier and dramatically reducing the chance of 
starting a forest fire.
To build a pit fire, simply follow these instructions:
 
1. Scrape away all the duff, exposing the mineral soil underneath.
 
 Clear an area larger than the fire you intend to build.

361
 Chapter 1: Basic Camp Skills
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
2. Create a shallow pit that’s wider than your fire and several inches deep.
 
 Use a small backpacking trowel or your hands to create the pit and be 
sure to save the earth you’ve removed because when the fire is out, you 
want to return the earth to cover up the evidence of your passing.
 
3. Build your fire in the pit, keeping it small and efficient and never 
allowing it to grow larger than the pit you’ve constructed.
 
 To build your fire, follow the directions for the teepee fire in the preced-
ing section.
 
Figure 1-15: 
Pit fire.
 
Mound fire
Mound fires are ideal when you can find suitable mineral soil that can be dug 
without disturbing the natural area (see Figure 1-16). Streambeds and sandy 
areas around boulders are great mineral soil sources.
 
Figure 1-16: 
Mound fire.
 

362
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Follow these steps to build a mound fire:
 
1. Choose a large flat rock that’s either portable or immobile, or create a 
rock base by placing two or more relatively flat rocks side by side.
 
2. Spread soil at least 3 inches deep on top of the rock base, creating a 
wide platform that’s larger than the area the fire will use — 2 to 21/2 
feet wide is usually sufficient.
 
 You can use a trowel and one of your cook pots to gather and spread 
the soil. Just be sure to wash out the cook pot before using it for its 
intended purpose.
 
3. Build a small and efficient fire directly on top of the mineral soil, 
making sure that it never grows larger than the base of soil on top of 
the rocks.
 
 To build the fire, follow the directions for the teepee fire earlier in this 
chapter.
Fire pan
Although common with river runners, fire pans are gaining popularity with 
other wilderness adventurers (see Figure 1-17). Certainly, the prospect of lug-
ging an iron fire pan in a backpack isn’t an inviting thought; however, many 
lighter alternatives are out there.
 
Figure 1-17: 
Fire pan.
 

363
 Chapter 1: Basic Camp Skills
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
The following steps explain how to build a fire in a fire pan:
 
1. Place the fire pan on a layer of small rocks or line it with mineral soil 
so the heat won’t scorch the earth.
 
 Your fire pan can be a pie-sized aluminum pan or a store-bought, manu-
factured pan.
 
 Instead of using mineral soil, you can lay several 3-foot-long strips of 
heavy-gauge aluminum foil side by side with a 1-inch overlap. You can 
also retire an old aluminum space blanket and fold it into a 3-foot-by-3-
foot square.
 
2. Cover the aluminum with several inches of mineral soil.
 
 This step stops the heat from damaging the fire pan or scorching the 
earth beneath it.
 
3. Build a small and efficient fire directly on top of the soil, never allow-
ing it to grow beyond the boundaries of the fire pan or foil barrier.
 
 To build your fire, follow the directions for the teepee fire earlier in the 
chapter.
Cleaning up your fire
Nothing should be left in the fire ring but ashes. No trash. No unburned 
wood. No bits of the dinner you didn’t eat. In addition, you need to make sure 
that the fire is truly out —meaning no hot embers are left — and that the site 
looks like it did (or better) when you leave.
Dousing embers
If you need to add water to douse any embers, do so slowly and sprinkle it on 
instead of soaking the fire and surrounding soil. Speed up the process by stir-
ring the coals while sprinkling additional water until the embers are out and 
the fire is cold.
When you think all the embers are out, check the fire for live embers by care-
fully placing your palm near, then on, the fire site. (If the fire is still smoking, 
don’t touch it. Sizzling flesh isn’t a good indicator of an extinguished fire.) If, 
as you place your hand near and then on the ashes, you don’t sense heat, stir 
the ashes carefully and look for hot embers again. If you still see none, then 
carefully sift through the ashes with your fingers. Again, if you don’t feel any 
warmth, the fire may be declared dead.

364
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Spreading the ashes
After the fire is cold, crush any large lumps of charcoal. Spread the ashes and 
crushed charcoal away from the site, leaving no sign of your campfire. Also, 
pick out any food or other trash remnants. Burying or scattering fire-black-
ened or charred trash with your fire’s ashes isn’t appropriate.
Returning the site to its original condition
If you had to build the fire site, be sure to fill in the pit, scatter the mound, 
or fold up and carry out the fire pan. Rinse off the rock from the mound fire 
before placing it back in its natural setting. Camouflage evidence of your 
campfire with duff. If the fire ring already existed when you arrived, leave it 
assembled after cleaning up the ashes and trash.
 
When you discover multiple fire rings at a single campsite, do the land a 
favor and dismantle all but one — pick the one in the safest location and in a 
spot that appears to have the least impact upon the ground or surrounding 
area. When dismantling fire rings, place any fire-blackened rocks blackened 
side down and camouflage them. Take the time to carefully scatter the ashes 
from the dismantled rings, pick out the trash, and camouflage the sites.
Basic Survival Skills
Fear and panic are by far the greatest dangers to any human being in the out-
doors. Although natural acts and other unforeseeable circumstances claim 
injuries and lives each year, most deaths and injuries can be prevented by 
staying calm and thinking a situation through. Staying calm isn’t so easy to 
do, however, if you have only limited knowledge or information upon which 
to draw to help you in times of crisis. That’s why developing basic wilderness 
skills that can help you in the event of an emergency is so important. The key 
is to know how to stay oriented, how to find shelter, and how to find water — 
all covered in the following sections.
Examining the art of staying found
When Daniel Boone was asked whether he was ever lost, his reply was, 
“Disoriented for a couple of days, maybe. Lost, never.” The major difference 
between Mr. Boone and the majority of weekend wilderness explorers is skill. 
Mr. Boone could always hunt, trap, find water, build a shelter, make a boat, 
and gradually find his way out of most predicaments. The average family, 
however, has neither the acquired wilderness skills to survive off the land 
nor the time to spend wandering aimlessly.

365
 Chapter 1: Basic Camp Skills
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
Before venturing into the great outdoors, you must realize that anyone can 
get lost. All it takes to disorient most people outdoors is a dense mist, a few 
unplanned turns in the woods, nightfall, or a storm. The so-called instinctive 
“sense of direction” is only as good as the information used to create that 
sense.
Staying aware of your surroundings
A good sense of direction comes from keeping your senses wide open to all 
sources of information — sights, sounds, smells, and even feelings. Teach 
yourself to be aware of significant landmarks such as a tall tree, a prominent 
rock, or a large meadow. Practice looking in 360-degree sweeps — check out 
the route you’re traveling from the front, side, and back. Quite often, a tree 
that looked so unique and significant in one direction looks completely differ-
ent when viewed from another.
Sounds like a rushing river, cars on a road, and a lighthouse’s foghorn are 
also important bits of info. Don’t overlook the smell and feel of an area, 
either. A valley may feel damp and smell a certain way. Water can quite often 
be smelled from a distance. Individually, each of the senses contains a frag-
ment of information to help you stay found. Combine all these fragments into 
careful and complete observations, and you begin to create a good sense of 
direction.
 
Teach your children about the area you’re going into as well. Because most 
children find topographic maps confusing and impossible to understand, try 
drawing a special map for them instead. Show them where major landmarks, 
roads, and water sources are; how the trail looks; where you plan to camp; 
and where some of the nearby towns are.
Knowing what to do if you become lost
I’m lost! That initial moment of panic surges through the human mind and 
body like a runaway train. If not controlled, the body soon follows the urge 
to act like a runaway train and very often takes off plowing through bushes, 
trees — anything — in a desperate effort to be found. This type of panic is 
all too common and can lead to further disorientation, complete exhaustion, 
dehydration, injury, and even death. So instead of going off in a panic, take 
these actions:
 
 Sit and think. Lost people usually wind up in deeper trouble when they 
panic and begin frantically attempting to find their way back to home or 
camp. If you take the time to sit down and think carefully, a solution usu-
ally becomes evident. Look around painstakingly, retracing your steps 
in your mind. Very often, after some calm thinking, you can discover the 
trail or route home.

366
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
 
 It’s critical for your children to understand the importance of staying in 
one place if they have no idea where they are. Wandering children make 
for extremely difficult rescues.
 
 Explore methodically. Sometimes the route home isn’t clearly evident, 
and you may feel a need to get up and explore the surrounding area in 
search of a trail. This approach is okay if you can accurately mark the 
area you’re now standing in so that you can return to it after the initial 
search. From that original sit-down point, you can begin working your 
way outward in a circular pattern until you discover a familiar piece of 
ground or terrain. While working your way out in this circular fashion, 
always keep your original starting position in sight.
 
 From each familiar point that you discover, establish another landmark 
that now identifies this area and repeat the process. Essentially, you 
move from familiar point to familiar point and mark your progress along 
the way. After you discover a trail or road that’s recognizable, you can 
then head out in a straight line toward home or help.
Seeking shelter
If you’re really lost and have no clue in which direction home or camp lies, 
then finding shelter should be your priority. Although small caves, deadfalls 
(fallen dead trees), hollow logs, and eroded overhangs appear to be good 
shelters in warm and sunny weather, these natural shelters often aren’t ideal. 
At best, natural enclosures usually can provide only temporary refuge, and at 
worst, they can become death traps.
Sheltering naturally
With any shelter you look for or build, your primary considerations should 
be wind protection, rain or snow protection, and heat retention.
 
 Wind protection: Protecting yourself from the wind is extremely impor-
tant because a strong wind coupled with rain can cause your body to 
lose heat rapidly — you can die of hypothermia even if the air tempera-
tures is 50 degrees. Wind also rapidly increases the body’s rate of dehy-
dration. Protection from wind is the easiest kind of protection to find, 
because almost anything — a fallen log, a dense bush, or a large rock — 
can protect you from the sides and break the wind.
 
 Rain or snow protection: Rain or snow protection is more difficult to 
find because your shelter must provide protection from above as well as 
from the sides. Dense bushes, thick brush piles from logging road con-
struction, downed trees, natural caves, and large rock piles are all candi-
dates for a natural shelter that will protect you from rain and snow.

367
 Chapter 1: Basic Camp Skills
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
 Heat retention: Most natural shelters can’t provide the third important 
criterion for shelter selection — heat retention. To add that, you need to 
gather dead leaves, twigs, and grasses to line and stuff the natural shel-
ter you select to help you stay warm.
 
Natural shelters can be dangerous, and you must know how to identify the 
dangers. Deadfalls, rock piles, and caves are all potential homes to a variety 
of animals and insects. You must take care not to suddenly disturb a nest 
of bees, a poisonous snake, or a bear. Perhaps even more dangerous is the 
possibility that the natural shelter could collapse at any moment, trapping 
you inside or underneath something heavy. Be very cautious around dead-
falls. Where one tree has fallen, more may be ready to tumble, given a strong 
enough wind.
 
Another possible hazard of a natural shelter is that it camouflages whatever 
is in it very well. If you use a natural shelter, leave some sign outside the 
shelter that you’re there. This sign should be somewhat obvious and visible 
enough so that snow or debris falling on the ground won’t obscure it.
Building your shelter
Building a shelter is perhaps the best way to stay warm, dry, and secure, and 
a constructed shelter stands out from the surrounding environment unlike 
the natural shelters described in the preceding section. Although many sur-
vival books teach you to a build lean-to, A-frame, igloo, and even cabin, the 
quickest and most efficient shelter to create is one that uses only available 
material lying on the forest floor and requires no tools to build. Anyone, even 
a child, can construct this shelter in about 90 minutes by following these 
steps:
 
1. Pick an area that has good drainage, isn’t going to get washed away, 
and won’t get buried under a falling tree or avalanche of rocks.
 
 Make absolutely certain that the area you’ve selected isn’t over an 
animal hole, an ant’s nest, or a thicket of poison oak, ivy, or sumac.
 
2. At the shelter site, find a large rock, stump, log, or other support.
 
 Logs or downed trees can work as one wall, but downed trees with large 
enough trunks aren’t always present. Ideally, the log or rock support 
should be about 3 feet high.
 
3. Find a large stick several inches across and approximately 5 feet long — 
or longer if the person using the shelter is taller.
 
4. Lean one end of the stick on the rock, log, or stump so that the other 
end rests on the ground, forming a ridgepole for your shelter.

368
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
 
5. Collect a large number of smaller sticks to lean along each side of the 
ridgepole, creating a frame for your shelter.
 
 Remember to leave the opening or door to the front and one side, facing 
away from the wind.
 
6. Crawl inside the shelter, making sure you have enough room to lie 
down comfortably so that you don’t kick or otherwise disturb the 
sides when moving about.
 
7. Pile twigs, dried leaves, and small branches on top of the framework 
you’ve built.
 
 Create a generous layer of leaves and twigs — approximately 2 to 3 feet 
thick is appropriate.
 
8. On top of that layer, add a snug layer of small branches and twigs 
that’s heavy enough to help hold the inner layer in place, even in a 
strong wind.
 
 Don’t make this additional layer so heavy that it crushes or compresses 
the leaves and twigs making up the inner lining.
 
9. Stuff the inside of the shelter full of dried leaves, pine needles, ferns, 
and so on, so that the interior is loosely filled from top to bottom.
 
10. With the shelter now complete, squirm and snuggle inside, feet first.
 
 This type of shelter will keep an adult or child warm and dry for days, 
even in the worst conditions.
Finding water
Dehydration is a killer. Therefore, finding water is second only to finding shel-
ter in the scale of importance for survival situations. With a good shelter and 
a water supply, a person can survive for a very long time, even without food. 
That said, be wary of any water you come across. Most water on Earth today 
is polluted to some degree. Chemical or biological pollutants can turn a very 
basic survival situation into a critical emergency. For this reason, water must 
be treated or purified to be considered safe.
Treating the water
Water can be treated in several ways. The boiling method is the best guarantee 
of purification because it destroys all biological pollutants. If you have a pot or 
cup with you, build a fire and bring the water to a rolling boil to purify it.
Another water-treatment method is filtering, but filtering in a survival situa-
tion doesn’t remove most dangerous pollutants. Also, most folks aren’t usually 

369
 Chapter 1: Basic Camp Skills
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
carrying a commercial filter with them when they find themselves in a survival 
situation. To filter very muddy or debris-filled water, pour the water through a 
bandanna or other piece of cotton clothing so that particles are filtered out.
 
Chemical purification works very well in removing biological but not chemi-
cal impurities. Products made of iodine such as Potable Aqua or Polar Pure 
are easy to use and very effective chemical treatments for water. If you camp 
with children, teach them how to use these products properly and safely. If 
your child carries a compact survival kit with him or her, include a bottle of 
Potable Aqua in it.
Discovering water
You can either find water or create it. The easiest way to get water is to 
discover a stream or moving water source. Moving water is the least likely 
to be polluted. Tree stumps, potholes, and stagnant ponds are other water 
sources, but they’re typically the most likely to be dangerously polluted. 
Sometimes, digging down into a damp streambed uncovers a water source 
that will regularly fill the hole. You can even obtain water from dew-soaked 
leaves and grasses. Instead of crawling around licking the leaves, soak up 
moisture with a cotton cloth and then squeeze out the water into your 
mouth. As a last resort, you can opt to create water using the solar-still 
method explained in the next section.
Making a solar still
Water distillation using a solar still is a method of creating water where none 
is evident. This method requires a large plastic sheet, a cup, and a length of 
plastic tubing (see Figure 1-18). Knowing how to create a water-distillation 
system is very useful, and the water is pure.
Follow these steps to set up a solar still:
 
1. Find an area that’s damp or located in a dry streambed or at the 
bottom of a gully, and dig a hole about 2 feet deep and 3 feet across.
 
 The earth you’re digging in should be damp near the bottom. However, 
if the dirt is dry, drop in green leaves, urinate in the hole, or add a small 
amount of water to provide moisture for condensation.
 
2. Place a cup in the center of the hole and rest one end of the plastic 
tubing in the bottom of the cup.
 
3. Cover the hole with the clear plastic sheet, leaving the other end of 
the plastic tube protruding out to one side.
 
4. Seal the edges with dirt so that no moisture can escape and no air can 
get in the hole.

370
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
 
5. Weight down the center of the plastic sheet with a rock so that the 
point of the inverted cone is directly above the cup.
 
 The sun, even on a hazy or partly cloudy day, will warm the earth and 
cause moisture from the soil in the hole to evaporate and condense on 
the underside of the plastic. The condensation rolls down the plastic 
and drips off the weighted end into the cup. You’ll be able to drink out 
of the cup by using the plastic tube sticking out of one side of the plastic 
sheet. This method works well, and the condensation or distilled water 
is pure, even if the moisture source is not (for example, if the moisture 
source is urine or badly polluted water).

still is pure.

hy do people get lost? For many reasons, and the majority are com-
pletely avoidable. The most common mistake is not packing a map 
and compass because you’re “just going out for a quick hike on a clearly 
marked trail.” All you have to do is be daydreaming or chatting with your 
hiking partners to walk off one trail and onto another, completely unaware. 
Another mistake is lack of preparation. You can imagine the routine — the 
trip is on so you grab a map, toss the compass in the pack, and go, with no 
forethought or map homework. Yet another reason for getting lost is trusting 
your partner, who may be just as hopelessly lost as you are.
Everyone who wants to safely enjoy the great outdoors should master basic 
navigational skills and be able to use them. An amazing number of people 
dutifully carry a map and shiny new compass, yet have absolutely no idea 
where they are, where they’re heading, or where they came from. Sure, pack-
ing a topographic map and a compass fulfill the “be prepared” mandate, but 
what good are they if you don’t know how to use them? You may as well 
bring a world atlas or road map — they’ll be as much help as a topographic 
map in the backcountry if you don’t have basic map and compass skills.
The art of staying found involves not only using your head and remaining 
observant (topics covered in Book IV, Chapter 1) but also applying map and 
compass skills properly. This chapter delves into those skills in detail.
Reading a Map
A topographic map is a one-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional 
environment. Cartographers create the three dimensions by using contour 
lines to show where hills, mountains, valleys, and canyons are located (see 

372
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Figure 2-1). A trained eye can look at a flat map with all the contour lines and 
see valleys, mountains, ridges, and more. The following sections give you the 
skills you need to unlock a map’s hidden treasures and, yes, even to fold one 
like a pro.
 
Figure 2-1:

map with

500-foot 
intervals.
 
 
Because a map can provide only so much info, a complete picture of how easy 
or difficult a particular terrain is to negotiate may not be evident until you’re 
actually attempting to navigate it. Never forget that a map is but a tool — not 
the gospel on what you may or may not encounter.
Familiarizing yourself with standard 
map colors and symbols
Topographic maps are printed in color, with different colors indicating differ-
ent objects.
 
 Green: Forested or vegetated areas
 
 White: Open terrain
 
 Brown: Contour or elevation lines
 
 Blue: Water, as a lake, river, or stream
 
 Black: Man-made features such as trails, roads, and buildings

373
 Chapter 2: Map and Navigation Basics
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
Man-made features on topographic maps should always be suspect, even on 
privately printed maps that claim to be up-to-date. Why? Because a build-
ing that existed when the map was printed may have vanished due to fire, 
weather, flood, or other reasons. Or the sole building that was there when 
the map was printed may have grown into a suburb of many buildings.
Many other symbols are used to depict such things as mines, ghost towns, 
marshes, swamps, waterfalls, and caves. The key to these symbols doesn’t 
appear on the map but on a separate sheet that you can obtain for free from 
the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Phone 888-ASK-USGS (888-275-
8747) or go online (ask.usgs.gov) for information.
Seeing in 3-D when looking at a map
Translating the one-dimensional image printed on a map into a three-dimensional 
representation of the world takes practice. Fortunately, topographic maps 
are designed to add height and depth to a flat picture. Figure 2-2, for example, 
shows a topographic map of a twin-peaked mountain, plus four two-dimensional 
views.
 
Have patience and take heart — seeing 3-D on a flat map isn’t as difficult as it 
may appear at first. Think about it this way:
 
 Widely spaced contour lines indicate a gradual slope.
 
 The more packed the contour lines are together, the steeper and more 
severe the terrain. Closely spaced contour lines may mean a cliff.
 
 Contour lines that roughly form circles, each getting smaller in size with 
each gain in elevation, indicate hills or mountain peaks. A summit is 
often marked with an X, with a number printed next to it indicating the 
exact elevation of that peak.
 
 Contour lines that bend into a V (the V may look more like a U if the ter-
rain is sloping very gently) represent a canyon, valley, or sloping ridge. 
If the V is pointing uphill, toward a point of higher elevation, then it’s 
forming a canyon. If the V is pointing downhill, toward a point of lower 
elevation, then it forms a ridge. It stands to reason then that a stream 
in a V would indicate that the V is a canyon and points toward higher 
points of elevation.
 
 V-shaped valleys on a map are typically steep and more difficult to navi-
gate. On extremely pronounced V shapes, expect the sidewalls of the 
canyon to be steep and almost impossible to scramble up or down. If 
you’re on the canyon floor, you’ll probably be there to stay until you exit 
either upstream or downstream. U-shaped valleys, on the other hand, 
are far more gentle and easier to navigate through.

Aside from telling you how steep the terrain is, the interval between contour 
lines alerts you to something else. Consider a map with a contour interval 
of 50 feet. This interval means the cartographer drew a contour line on the 
map for every 50 feet of elevation change up or down. But what this also 
means is that the map may not include some pretty impressive stuff — like 
that 30-foot-high chunk of rock you see ahead, or a 35-foot cliff or 25-foot-
deep wash. The reason these objects don’t show up is simply that they’re all 
smaller in scale than 50-foot up/down intervals.
Ensuring you have the right map
Obviously, you want to make sure you’re using the right map for the area 
you’re in. Fortunately, every map features info about what area it covers. On 
a USGS map, this area info appears in two places: in the lower-left corner and 
in the upper-right corner along the white border that surrounds the map. The 
United States is divided into quadrants based on lines of latitude and lon-
gitude, and each quadrant most often carries the name of a significant geo-
graphical feature or municipality falling within the quadrant’s boundaries.
USGS maps print adjoining map information along their borders so that you 
can effectively link maps of the same series and scale. Typically, the names of 
corresponding and adjoining maps are printed at each corner, one at each side, 
and one at both the top and bottom of the map. You can also find a silhouette 
picture of the region the map series covers, divided into equal quadrants — the 

375
 Chapter 2: Map and Navigation Basics
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
map you’re using will be the shaded one. This way you can see where the map 
fits into the entire region’s mapping picture and how many adjoining maps you 
may require to navigate across it.
Grasping a map’s scale
The USGS prints its maps in what are known as series (7.5-minute, 15-minute, 
and so on). Although you can still find 15-minute series maps, the USGS pub-
lishes mostly 7.5-minute series maps these days.
The Earth is divided into 180 degrees of latitude, displayed as horizontal lines 
running east-to-west on map and 360 degrees of longitude displayed as vertical 
lines connecting the poles running around the globe. Degrees of latitude are 
measured from 0 degrees at the equator to 90 degrees the poles -- 90 degrees 
north for the north pole or 90 degrees south for the south pole. Degrees of lon-
gitude are measured 180 degrees to the east and 180 degrees to the west of the 
prime meridian. 
In navigational terms, minutes and seconds have absolutely nothing to do with 
time and everything to do with a unit of distance measurement. A 7.5-minute 
series map represents an area of the Earth’s surface that is 7.5 minutes (one 
eighth of a degree) of longitude wide by 7.5 minutes (one eighth of a degree) of 
latitude high.
Waterproofing a map
Making a see-through, waterproof cover for 
your maps is an easy way to prevent your 
much-needed navigational tools from turning 
into shredded piles of unreadable mush when 
the weather turns damp — and you know it will 
at some point. All you need is a large, freezer-
weight, zip-top bag and a few sections of sturdy, 
waterproof tape, such as duct or packing tape.
Simply cut the tape into a strip long enough to 
completely adhere to one sealed edge of the 
bag from top to bottom. Press one half of the 
tape, lengthwise, onto the side edge of the bag, 
leaving the other half of the tape hanging over 
the edge. Now flip the bag over and fold the 
tape down on the other side of the bag. Repeat 
each step twice more, once for the bottom and 
once for the remaining side. You now have a 
wonderful waterproof map container that’s 
reinforced on three edges.
Some other ways to protect a map from water 
include
  Painting on a product called Stormproof, 
or other map-waterproofing treatments by 
Aquaseal or Nikwax, available at most map 
and outdoor specialty stores. The clear 
chemical coating renders maps waterproof, 
flexible, and able to be written on.
  Using a coating of Thompson Water Seal or 
another brick and masonry sealant to make 
a map water-repellent, but not waterproof.

376
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
In a typical 7.5-minute map, the scale is 1:24,000, which means that one unit 
of measurement on the map equals 24,000 units of the same measurement 
full-sized. In a 1:24,000 scale map, 1 inch equals about 1/8 of a mile, or nearly 
2,000 feet. At the bottom of most maps is a bar scale that allows you to make 
to-scale measurements that correspond to foot, mile, or kilometer distances.
Although the bar scale printed at the bottom of your map is a straight line, 
most trails never remain straight for more than several hundred yards. And 
trails have a nasty habit of gaining and losing elevation, so although a trail 
line on a map may look like 1 mile, you may clock several miles as you hike it. 
Still, measuring your route somewhat accurately does allow you to plan your 
trip with some idea of how long it will take.
 
Using either red or white narrow-gauge electrical wire is a great way to 
measure distance on a map because electrical wire (the kind used in model 
building, that is) is very flexible, holds its shape, doesn’t stretch, and can be 
marked with an indelible ink marker. Follow these steps:
 
1. Cut a 12-inch section of the wire, and mark 1/4- and 1-mile increments 
on it with a fine-tipped, indelible black ink marker.
 
 Using dots for the 1/4-mile marks and a complete band around the wire 
for the 1-mile marks works best. Be sure to meticulously match your 
marks to those on the map’s bar scale.
 
2. Place one end of the wire at your starting point and then gradually 
bend and contour the wire to match the twists and bends of your trail 
or route of travel (see Figure 2-3).
 
 After you’re done bending and contouring, you can count up the miles 
and determine just how far your planned route is, how far it may be to 
your estimated rest points, and how far it is to points of scenic interest, 
water, and so on.
Determining latitude and longitude
Degrees of latitude and longitude are indicated in the corners of most maps. 
Reading up from the bottom-left or bottom-right corner of a map, black ticks 
and/or fine black lines indicate changes in minutes and seconds of latitude 
(explained in the preceding section). Latitude in the Northern Hemisphere 
(north of the equator) increases as you move north and toward the top of the 
map. Black ticks and/or fine black lines indicate changes in minutes and sec-
onds of longitude when reading from the bottom-right or top-right corner of a 
map. Longitude in North America increases as you go west.

Folding a map
A properly folded map — yes, there is such a thing (see Figure 2-4) — makes 
opening and closing your map a simple matter, even in windy weather. 
Further, the accordion configuration collapses to pocket size with ease. After 
you establish the creases, any map folds up and down almost without effort.
 
1. Lay the map flat, printed side up.
 
2. Fold it in half vertically, with the printing inside the first fold, and 
establish the first crease.
 
 Make this and every subsequent crease clean and sharp.
 
3. Open the map back up, and working with only the right half of the map, 
fold the right side in half toward the center, resulting in quarter-folds.
 
4. Fold the outside quarter-fold back to the edge, producing an eighth-
fold. Use this fold as a guide and fold the other quarter the same way.
 
 Half the map should now have four accordion-style folds.

5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 on the map’s other half.
 
 You should end up with a full accordion of eight folds in a long shape 
like a ruler.
 
6. Fold the map in the shape of a Z so it’s in thirds.
 
 Voilá! Now you can look at any section without having to completely 
unfold the map, and it snaps into place almost by itself.

Compasses: A Primer
A compass is a mechanical device that uses the Earth’s magnetic field as a 
directional aid. The idea is that, by knowing where north is, you can figure 
out the other directions and find your way to wherever you want to go. With 
a compass, you can plot a course, stay on course, determine the location of a 
landmark or destination point, or follow a course outline by a guidebook or a 
friend.

Buying a compass
When you’re considering buying a compass, look for the following basic 
features (at minimum):
 
 Rotating bezel or azimuth ring with a 360-degree dial in 2-degree gradua-
tions (see the later section “Understanding compass parts” for descrip-
tions of these parts)
 
 A clear baseplate with inch and millimeter scales
 
 A direction-of-travel arrow engraved into the baseplate
 
 A rotating magnetic needle mounted in a clear capsule filled with liquid 
to reduce shake and movement
 
 Orienting lines engraved or printed onto the bottom of the rotating capsule
Figure 2-5 shows the basic features of a compass. Additional features, such 
as a sighting mirror (making it a prismatic compass), built-in adjustable dec-
lination, clinometers, and a magnifying glass add to a compass’s cost but are 
very useful if you plan to become serious about your navigational skills.

If you can, purchase a compass that has a declination-adjustment feature 
built in — it costs $20 or so but is well worth it.
Defining declination
Declination is simply the difference between true north, which is what all 
maps are based on, and magnetic north, which is what all magnetic needles 
point toward. In a perfect world, they’d be the same, but in reality, magnetic 
north and true north are often very different. For example, using a compass 
as your guide, if you ignore declination on a simple 2-mile hike from your car 
to a nice lakeside campsite, you could end up in a valley several thousand 
yards away!
 
Declination is either west or east depending on which side of true north the 
compass needle points. On USGS topographic maps, arrows printed on the 
bottom margin of the map indicate declination. The arrow with a star above 
it indicates true north. The shorter arrow with “MN” above it indicates mag-
netic north. If the MN arrow is on the left side of the true north arrow, decli-
nation is west, and you need to add the indicated degree amount to correct 
your bearing. If the MN arrow is on the right side of the true north arrow, 
declination is east, and you need to subtract the indicated degree amount to 
correct your bearing.
If you have a compass with the declination adjustment feature built in, the 
compass makes these adjustments for you automatically. You just have to turn 
a screw or adjust the housing once for the compass to read true. Of course, 
you also have to remember that each time declination changes, often from map 
to map, you need to manually adjust the compass to the new setting.
Understanding compass parts
Besides a needle and a big N, how complicated can a compass be? Oh, not 
very, but some parts, including features that come into play every time you 
take a bearing and set a course, warrant further explanation.
 
 Azimuth ring (housing): The circular housing with textured edges, often 
liquid-filled, that rotates within the compass base for taking or setting 
bearings. Degree markings, from 0 to 360, are typically etched into its 
surface, making up the azimuth ring or graduated dial.
 
 Gun-type sights: Most often found on prismatic (sighting) compasses 
and used like the sights on a gun for sighting and taking bearings with 
maximum accuracy.
 
 Index line: The mark on the front of the sight or compass baseplate 
where you read the indicated bearing.

381
 Chapter 2: Map and Navigation Basics
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
 Line of travel or direction of travel: A line or arrow engraved on the 
compass’s baseplate that points you in the direction you need to go to 
reach your desired destination.
 
 Liquid damping: Liquid damping allows the needle to come to rest rapidly 
and helps to hold the needle steady, allowing for faster and more accurate 
readings. Compasses without liquid damping leave the user waiting for 
what seems a lifetime for the needle to stop spinning — and squinting 
to determine which point the bouncy needle is actually pointing to. The 
better compasses use a kerosene-based fluid or some other additive to 
ensure the liquid doesn’t freeze or boil from –40 degrees to 120 degrees.
 
 Mirror: Incorporated into a hard-case lid that folds down over the top of 
the compass housing, the mirror is used to make prismatic in-line sightings, 
the most accurate method of using a hand-held compass. A prismatic com-
pass allows you to hold the compass at eye level, sighting both the distant 
object through the gun-type sight and the compass face at the same time.
 
 Orienting arrow: The outlined arrow engraved into the base of a 
compass housing and often lined with red paint. The arrow is made 
to exactly outline the outside of the magnetic needle. By centering or 
boxing the magnetic needle within the orienting arrow’s outline, both 
pointing in the same direction (unless back-sighting), you can determine 
your bearing or direction of travel.
 
 Protractor: A feature that allows you to more easily plot a bearing 
on a map.
 
 Sighting line: The line you sight along on a hand-held compass in order 
to take a bearing.
Caring for your compass
Compasses are designed to work even when you subject them to rough han-
dling like banging ’em against rocks, dropping ’em onto hard surfaces, and 
using ’em in the dirt. However, if you want your compass to work when you 
need it, a little TLC is in order.
 
Always practice the following:
 
 Protect your compass as much as you can. Try tucking your compass 
inside your shirt to protect it when it’s hanging around your neck and 
not in use. If you have a sighting compass with a cover, keep it closed 
when not in use.
 
 Never leave your compass sitting in an extremely hot environment. 
Places such as on a rock under intense desert sun or on the dashboard 
or in the glove compartment of your car are horrible places to leave your 
compass. Extreme temperatures can cause the damping fluid in your com-
pass to rupture the housing and leak out, rendering your compass useless.

382
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
 
 After applying insect repellents, be sure to clean your hands thor-
oughly before touching your compass. The chemicals in repellents 
(most typically DEET) can eat the ink off your compass’s housing. 
Worse, DEET has been known to affect the plastic housing of a compass, 
causing it to cloud up and even crack.
 
 Be prepared to eliminate a static charge that builds up on your com-
pass from time to time. Over time, the needle on your compass may 
begin to act sluggishly, even appearing to stick to the bottom of its liq-
uid-filled housing. Most often, this slowdown is due to a buildup of static 
electricity within the housing, and you can easily correct it by rubbing 
a small amount of water directly over the housing to disperse the static 
charge.
It isn’t uncommon for a small bubble to appear in your compass’s liquid-
filled housing when you’re using the tool in high elevations or below-freezing 
temperatures. The bubble forms because the fluid within the housing con-
tracts or expands at a faster rate than the housing, resulting in a vacuum-
type bubble. This bubble doesn’t affect the performance of your compass 
because the liquid’s sole purpose is to dampen or slow down the movement 
of the magnetic needle. Typically, a bubble disappears when the compass is 
returned to room temperature or to a lower elevation. If the bubble remains, 
you can correct the situation by placing the compass in a warm (not hot) 
spot, such as a sunny windowsill. Should the bubble grow in size, you may 
have a small, almost imperceptible leak in the liquid-filled compass housing, 
and that means you need a new compass.
Navigation Basics: Using Your Tools
By using the natural means of navigation described in this chapter, combined 
with your basic tools — the map and compass, explained in the previous 
sections — you have the means to travel anywhere you want without fear of 
getting lost. That doesn’t mean you’ll never be disoriented, but disoriented 
and lost are two different conditions. When you’re disoriented, you’re con-
fused about your location but have confidence in your navigational abilities. 
When you’re lost, you’re confused about your location and have no idea 
which way to turn to get found. The next several sections offer some basic 
tips that can get you into the navigational mood. Consider them the first 
steps in developing your navigational skills.
 
By no means should you consider these sections the complete and final word 
on navigation. To become really proficient, you need to read, study, and 
practice, practice, practice — perhaps even by joining an orienteering club 
(almost every major city throughout North America has one). By going out 
on a regular basis with the club, your skills will become sharper and sharper, 
and before long, you’ll be far less likely to get lost.

Orienting your map
To find where you are on a map, you must first orient it so that it represents 
a two-dimensional image that comes as close as possible to exactly parallel-
ing the three-dimensional world you’re standing in. You can do that with or 
without a compass, as explained in the following sections.
Orienting a map without a compass
The quickest way to orient a map is by using easily identifiable landmarks. If 
you can identify a nearby peak, for example, or a rock outcropping, lake, or 
point where two trails intersect, or a point that’s unique enough to have a 
map symbol or designation, then placing yourself on your map is easy.
After you know your exact position on the map, spin it until other points of 
reference on the map line up with the same points of reference that you see 
on the surrounding landscape. Good navigators keep their maps in constant 
orientation to the surrounding landscape as they travel.
Orienting a map with a compass
No matter how good you are, eyeballing your map to the lay of the land is 
only roughly accurate. For complete accuracy, you need to use your compass 
to correctly orient your map to your surroundings. Because your map is 
printed with the edges lined up with true north, and because your compass 
needle always points toward magnetic north, you must account for declina-
tion in order to correctly align your map. Here’s how:
 
1. Correctly set your compass declination adjustment.
 
 Refer to the earlier section “Defining declination.”
 
2. Place the edge of the compass baseplate along the printed edge of the 
map and hold it there.
 
3. Carefully rotate the map until the red end of the magnetic needle is 
centered (boxed) in the orienting arrow.
Your map is now oriented to magnetic north and the surrounding landscape.
Establishing a bearing in the 
field to stay on course
Imagine that you’re hiking toward a distant landmark that you can see from 
where you are now but that will soon disappear when you enter the woods or 
descend into a valley. How can you be sure you’ll stay on course? Figure 2-6 
shows you how to hold your compass as you follow these steps:

384
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
 
1. Hold your compass level at waist height and point the direction-of-
travel arrow at the landmark.
 
 If you have a prismatic compass, you need to hold it at eye level, sight 
through the gun-type sight, and view the housing in the mirror.

2. Rotate the compass housing until the red end of the magnetic compass 
needle is centered (boxed) within the orienting arrow.
 
3. Read your bearing in degrees at the center index point.
 
 The center index point is where the compass housing meets the direc-
tion-of-travel arrow on the compass baseplate.
 
4. To follow the bearing you get from Step 3, pick a point of reference in 
front of you and then look over your shoulder and pick a landmark 
directly behind you (called your back bearing) that you won’t lose 
sight of.
 
 Make sure the first significant point of reference you pick — a rock or a 
large tree, for example — is in line with the direction-of-travel arrow and 
is one that you won’t lose sight of until you reach it.
 
5. Walk directly toward the point of reference without touching your 
compass dial.

385
 Chapter 2: Map and Navigation Basics
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
 Don’t worry that you can no longer see the original landmark you’re 
hiking to because your compass reading has already been set at the index.
 
6. When you reach the reference point, hold the compass level once 
again, turn your body until the north end of the compass needle 
centers itself exactly inside the orienting arrow, and find another 
point of reference in line with the direction-of-travel arrow.
 
 Before you move toward the new point of reference, you need to verify 
that the landmark you chose in Step 4 is in the right place (that is, it’s in 
line with the direction-of-travel arrow).
 
7. With the compass still held level, turn toward your back bearing until 
the white end of the compass needle is now centered inside the ori-
enting arrow.
 
 If the landmark is in line with the direction-of-travel arrow, you’re on 
course for the original landmark as planned. Turn around and head 
directly to your next selected point of reference.
 
8. Repeat the procedure until you arrive at your selected destination.
Taking a map bearing
You have your map out and you know where you want to go, but you can’t 
see it — kind of like not being able to see the forest for the trees. No worries! 
A couple quick procedures with your map and compass can help you get 
your bearing and get on your way.
 
1. First, orient your map using your compass.
 
 Refer to the earlier section “Orienting a map with a compass.”
 
2. Place the edge of the compass baseplate with the direction-of-travel 
arrow pointing from your current location on the map toward your 
intended destination.
 
 The edge of the baseplate should exactly connect your current location 
and your intended destination.
 
3. Being careful not to move either the map or the compass, rotate the 
compass housing until the north end (red end) of the compass needle 
centers itself exactly inside the orienting arrow.
 
 The index point indicates your degree bearing.
 
4. Without moving the compass housing, stand up, holding the compass 
level at your waist, and rotate your body until the north end of the 
compass needle centers itself exactly inside the orienting arrow.
 
 The direction-of-travel arrow indicates your course.

386
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
You see your destination on 
the map but not in person
You can see where you are on the map, that much is certain. Perhaps you’ve 
even picked out an interesting-looking summit on the map, not too far from 
where you are now, and you want to explore it. But in scanning the terrain, 
you’re having a hard time picking the desired summit out of the several 
others clustered nearby. What do you do?
Follow the steps in the preceding “Taking a map bearing” section to establish 
a bearing and rotate your body. Then you can determine which summit is 
the one you want to explore by holding the compass at waist level until the 
magnetic needle is centered (boxed) within the orienting arrow. The correct 
summit is the one that the direction-of-travel arrow is pointing toward.
 
If you’re using a prismatic compass, hold the compass at eye level, sight 
through the gun-type sight, and view the housing in the mirror. The summit 
will be the one your gun-type sight is lined up on.
You see a landmark but can’t 
place it on the map
You can see your desired destination (a distant summit), and you know 
where you are on the map, but you have no idea which summit on the map is 
the one you’re looking at in the field (Figure 2-7). Here’s what to do:
 
1. Orient your map.
 
2. Hold your compass level at waist height and point the direction-of-travel 
arrow at the mountain’s summit.
 
 For a prismatic compass, hold the compass at eye level, sight through 
the gun-type sight, and view the housing in the mirror.
 
3. Rotate the compass housing until the red end of the magnetic compass 
needle is centered within the orienting arrow.
 
 Your bearing may be read in degrees at the center index point — where 
the compass housing meets the direction-of-travel arrow on the compass 
baseplate.
 
4. Taking care not to move the map, place one edge of the compass base-
plate directly on your current location on the map.

387
 Chapter 2: Map and Navigation Basics
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
5. Without moving the compass housing or the map in any way, pivot the 
compass around your known location point until the red end of the 
magnetic compass needle is centered within the orienting arrow.
 
6. Draw a line, either in pencil or with your imagination, along the edge 
of the baseplate toward the summit indicated on the map.
 
 The summit you’re looking at in the field is the one intersected by the 
line drawn from your location.

can see on 
the horizon.
 
Working your way around obstacles
What happens if you come to a natural obstacle you hadn’t counted on — an 
obstacle that stands directly in your path and established compass bearing, 
like the one shown in Figure 2-8? No problem!
 
1. Take as close to a 90-degree bearing (hard right or left turn) as pos-
sible and begin walking beside the obstacle, counting your steps.
 
2. After you reach a point where you can resume hiking in the direction 
of your original compass bearing, stop counting and remember how 
many steps you took.
 
3. Turn 90 degrees back so that you’re walking on the same heading you 
were on when you encountered the obstacle; walk until you’re clear 
of the obstacle again.
 
4. Turn 90 degrees in the opposite direction you originally took in Step 
1 and retrace your steps, counting until you walk the exact number of 
paces you noted in Step 2.
 
 You’re now back on your original course, this time on the other side of 
the obstacle you encountered.

Making sense of trail markers
How do you know whether you’re on the right trail or not? Trails are marked 
in many different ways throughout North America. Blazes — a blaze is a dia-
mond, circle, or dotted “i” carved into a tree about 6 to 8 feet off the ground — 
are common. Painted blazes or metal plates nailed to a tree are also common. 
These identifiable trail markers are placed on both sides of the tree and at 
regular intervals so that you can spot the next blaze within a few feet of leav-
ing the last one.

389
 Chapter 2: Map and Navigation Basics
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
Sometimes finding the next blaze involves a little search-and-find mission. 
Don’t panic and, above all, don’t head out blindly along a route just because 
it supposedly looks like a trail. Thousands of trails exist in the woods simply 
because animals use them and not because humans created them.
When the trail heads above the treeline or through open, treeless areas (des-
erts, vast plains, and the like), trails are often marked with cairns — piles of 
rocks. Sometimes, in challenging terrain where route-finding is a matter of 
life and death, cairns have been replaced by 5-foot-high wands with reflective 
tape or paint. Mount Washington in New Hampshire and Mount Katahdin in 
Maine are two such areas.
 
Don’t add to trail markers that already exist — for example by flagging or 
building new cairns. Just because you think the trail needs a marker doesn’t 
mean you’re right. For instance, you could be off-route, and adding a marking 
may only confuse those who follow you.

A
lthough you can’t do much about the weather, you can figure out how 
to read and understand changes in weather patterns and to know what 
those changes mean. Without this know-how, the best you can do is react 
blindly to the circumstances that Mother Nature may throw your way. But 
with it, you can face your outdoor excursion with reliable preparedness. 
Often, that difference alone may determine the margin of comfort and safety 
that separates disaster from adventure.
In this chapter, you discover some basic tips for predicting changes in 
weather patterns and some safety precautions for riding out the inevitable 
storms. If you’d like to learn more about meteorological concepts, check out 
another book I wrote, Basic Essentials Weather Forecasting (published by the 
Globe Pequot Press).
 
To hone your weather-predicting skills, keep a weather eye on the sky. The 
more aware you are and the more you know about what causes weather, the 
more perceptive your observations will be and the more accurate your guesses 
as to the weather’s outcome. But never forget: Weather forecasts are only 
educated guesses, never statements of fact. Always be prepared for the worst.
Predicting Weather Changes 
by Reading Clouds
Cloud watching is more than simply picking out shapes that look like pirates 
or giraffes. By observing clouds and identifying them, you can gain a fairly 
good insight into what the next 12 to 24 hours of weather may bring.

392
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
 
Clouds form whenever vapor from the earth condenses and is lifted skyward. 
In simple terms, a cloud is visible because the moisture has cooled below 
the dew point and condensed into particles that reflect light. The hotter and 
more humid the air that’s rising, the more dense the clouds that form — 
think of thunderheads in the Midwest on hot, humid afternoons.
Types of cloud formations
The main types of cloud formations you need to concern yourself with when 
letting your eyes surf across the sky are cirrus, cumulus, cumulonimbus, and 
stratus, shown in Figure 3-1.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Types of 
clouds.

Cirrus
Made up predominantly of ice crystals, cirrus clouds are arguably some of 
the most beautiful of the cloud formations, leaving milky white swirls and 
curls etched across the sky (see Figure 3-1). Cirrus clouds, with the excep-
tion of cirrostratus (thicker, sheetlike clouds that can mean snow or rain is 
coming), indicate fair weather will hold for a while.
Cumulus and cumulonimbus
Often referred to as heap clouds, cumulus formations are typified by their 
heaped or fluffy shapes (refer to Figure 3-1). Small, lumpy cumulus clouds 
are considered “fair weather” clouds. Grayish and puffy, these clouds form 

393
 Chapter 3: Weathering the Outdoors
Book IV

in masses early in the day and are often precursors to an afternoon thunder-
storm. As cumulus clouds stack vertically and begin to form a flat base with 
a towering center and an anvil-shaped upper, they become cumulonimbus 
clouds (“nimbus” means rain producing), creating the classic thunderhead, 
which can mean heavy precipitation, thunder, lightning, and hail.
Stratus
“Stratus” means layered, essentially formless with no real defining base or 
top. Fog is a type of stratus cloud that lies close to the ground and is caused 
when the Earth’s surface cools. This cooling effectively lowers the air tem-
perature, resulting in condensation. A variety of stratus clouds exist:
 
 Cirrostratus: High-level (usually around 20,000 feet), veil-like cloud for-
mations composed of ice crystals and often spreading out over a very 
large surface area. Halos are frequently observed in cirrostratus clouds, 
indicating a lowering of the cloud ceiling and possible precipitation 
within 48 hours.
 
 Altostratus: Medium-level clouds (usually hovering around 8,000 feet) 
that are flat or striated and dark gray in color. A darkening of the cloud 
cover indicates possible precipitation within 48 hours.
 
 Nimbostratus: Low-level, dark, and thick clouds, often without any real 
defining shape. Their ragged edges, known as scud, produce steady 
precipitation.
 
 Lenticular clouds: Well known in the Sierra Nevada, lenticular clouds, 
known formally as altocumulus lenticularis, are lens-shaped clouds that 
form at or around mountain peaks due to a cresting or wave in the air-
stream passing over the peak. As air is forced up the mountain ridge, it 
cools, condenses, and forms as a cloud near the peak. As the air passes 
over the peak and heads back down the ridge, it warms, and moisture 
evaporates. Because condensation is occurring only at the peak, the 
cloud forms only at the peak, and even though winds are whipping 
through it, the cloud remains stationary.
Messages in cloud movements
You can make some general predictions about the weather without being 
able to tell a cirrus cloud from a stratus cloud.
If clouds are massing and generally increasing in size and density, the 
weather is possibly changing for the worse. Clouds moving more quickly 
across the sky indicate a change in wind velocity and also a change in pres-
sure, indicating an approaching storm.

394
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Because the various cloud formations take on different appearances and 
altitudes, it’s possible, although sometimes difficult, to observe the move-
ments of two or more different cloud formations across the sky. Cloud forma-
tions that are moving in separate directions and at different altitudes often 
announce an impending storm.
Finally, observe cloud movements and wind direction together. If both the 
cloud movements and wind direction are the same, any weather will come 
from the direction the wind is blowing.
Geographic Weather Variations
Although the weather may be warm and sunny on a mountain ridge, tempera-
tures may be downright cold in the valley below it. How so? The answer is 
microclimate influences. Differences in temperature and humidity in various 
microclimates are created by different degrees of solar warming, radiation, 
and evaporative cooling. Knowing what these are and how they work can 
make the difference between a chilly night huddled in your sleeping bag 
under a cold air-sink, or basking comfortably several hundred feet away 
under moonbeams. Of course, if the weather is foul, microclimatology is a 
moot point — foul weather is a constant with no microclimate sanctuaries.
Mountains and valleys
Hike anywhere in any mountain range and you’ll note one constant feature: 
Wind blows up the mountain during the day (as shown in Figure 3-2) and down 
the mountain at night (see Figure 3-3). Why? Two forces are at work, both 
caused by radiation as the Earth’s surface loses more heat than it absorbs 
during a clear night. As the ground gives off heat, that heat rises, and the Earth 
cools. The air close to the ground becomes colder more quickly and, because 
it’s denser than warm air, begins to flow, rather like water, downhill — toward 
valley bottoms and desert floors. As the cool air rushes down the mountain 
(this is the breeze you feel), it displaces the warm air, forcing it upward and 
keeping a cycle of air going. As the warm air gets forced out, the cool air pools 
and collects in the lower reaches, creating places often referred to as cold sinks.
In broad valleys covered with dense meadow grasses, frost pockets may 
form, even though the temperature just 500 to 1,000 feet higher is a comfort-
able 50 degrees. The broader the valley and the more vertical the surround-
ing mountainous ridges, the more marked the temperature contrasts will 
be. The narrower the valley, the less dramatic the temperature differences 
between top and bottom will be, because the walls tend to radiate heat from 
one to another, trapping potential heat loss from the valley bottom.

395
 Chapter 3: Weathering the Outdoors
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
As the early morning sun begins to warm the valley, the winds reverse them-
selves and begin rushing up the mountain as the warm air begins to rise. 
Remember, however, that the air can only be warmed if the sun hits it, which 
explains why the side of the valley that’s getting the sun first experiences 
upslope winds, whereas the side of the valley still in the shade experiences 
cool downslope winds.
Cloudy conditions or a presence of strong winds in the area will alter the 
topographical variations in the wind and temperature pattern. Cloudy condi-
tions act as an insulator, reducing radiant heat loss and holding a thermal 
layer of air closer to the Earth’s surface. Windy conditions may overpower 
the gentle nature of upslope or downslope winds and also alter the potential 
temperature variances.
Winds that flow up and down a valley or canyon floor operate in a similar 
manner to winds that flow up and down a valley’s walls. As temperatures 
fluctuate between the higher elevations (mountains, ridges, or foothills) at 
one end of the canyon or valley and the lower elevations (deserts or plains), 
winds also fluctuate in intensity and direction. Canoeists and rafters know 
this fact well — many an afternoon wind blowing upstream from the heated 
elevations below has thwarted their efforts to paddle successfully. It’s impor-
tant to note, however, that canyons and valleys channel wind, too, and it’s 
entirely possible — probable in fact — that winds will roar up or down the 
canyon or valley no matter what time of day it is.
The ups and downs of adiabatic 
temperature fluctuations
Here’s a word to drop into your next weather 
conversation: adiabatic. Sounds like “diabetic,” 
but it’s not related. Adiabatic is the term explain-
ing why air cools as it rises and warms when it 
falls. To get just a little more technical, air cools 
approximately 5.5 degrees for each 1,000 feet of 
elevation gain. It warms at about the same rate 
during elevation loss. As air meets a mountain 
and is forced over it, the air pressure falls, and 
the temperature also falls as the air expands. 
When the air pours over the peak and begins 
to descend, air pressure and temperature both 
rise again.
Condensation throws a monkey wrench into the 
entire process, however. Just as adiabatic cool-
ing lowers the temperature of air, any conden-
sation that may occur warms it. The net effect 
on humid air being pushed up over a mountain 
peak is an average temperature cooling of 3.2 
degrees per 1,000 feet. Once at the peak, the air 
begins to warm as it descends, and no further 
condensation occurs. Adiabatic warming of this 
air happens at the normal 5.5 degrees for each 
1,000 feet of elevation loss.

Snowfields, glaciers, and 
wintry environments
In many mountain environments, the presence of year-round snowfields 
and glaciers creates localized wind conditions in the valleys directly below. 
These winds are caused by the cool air that flows off the glacier or snowfield, 
displacing the surrounding warmer air that hugs the valley floor. Fairly gentle 
and warm, these winds dissipate quite quickly.
Winds originating from glaciers or snowfields will occur as long as the sur-
face temperature of the snow is sufficiently different from the surface tem-
perature of the ground below the lip of the glacier or snowfield.
The cold wind that emanates from ice caves underneath a glacier also has a 
significant effect on the growing season of plants. For example, in the Cascade 
range near the Canadian border, several ice caves are located adjacent to areas 
Estimating wind speed
Devised by Sir Francis Beaufort in 1805, the wind speed chart, now known as the Beaufort Scale of 
Wind Force, is an excellent and extremely accurate method of estimating wind velocity.

where the growing season of the plants and flowers consistently begins several 
weeks after that of plants only several hundred feet away. This situation occurs 
because the colder air near the ice makes the plants think the growing season 
has not yet begun. This knowledge works well if you’re trying to get a photo-
graph of various flowering alpine plants and miss the first bloom due to miser-
able photography weather.
Oceans and lakes
Anyone who has spent anytime at all hiking, boating, or camping near the 
shore of a large body of water, such as the ocean or any one of the Great 
Lakes, is probably familiar with the daytime onshore winds and the nighttime 
offshore breezes. As with snowfields and glaciers (see the preceding section), 
temperature differences between the land and the ocean or lake must be suf-
ficient for winds to occur. Unlike snowfields and glaciers, clouds reduce the 
temperature contrasts. Winds typically are most common when the days are 
sunny and warm and the nights are clear.
Wind chill index
The wind chill equivalency index demonstrates 
the actual cooling effect on bare skin when 
exposed to air under the following tempera-
tures and wind speeds. Although understanding 
wind chill has very little to do with being able 
to predict weather patterns, you should realize 
the impact wind and temperature have on the 
body so that you can make safe decisions about 
dress and travel. In the table, for example, if the 
temperature is 20 degrees above zero and the 
wind is blowing 15 mph, the wind chill equiva-
lent is 6 degrees below zero.

 Chapter 3: Weathering the Outdoors
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
Generally, onshore breezes begin around mid morning and continue until 
early to mid afternoon. The wind is typically steady and can result in a dra-
matic drop of onshore temperature, sometimes as much as 10 to 15 degrees. 
Evenings and early mornings are usually calm. Offshore breezes often begin 
shortly after dusk and continue until early morning.
Deserts
Thermally created low-pressure systems often develop in desert areas. As 
superheated air rises skyward, it creates a void, a low-pressure area that 
must be filled. The resulting effect is strong horizontal winds that rush in as 
the pressure attempts to equalize, creating dust devils and sandstorms.
Portents and Omens from 
Mother Nature Herself
Mother Nature provides a lot of weather clues, some in the form of rhymes 
but all fairly simple and easy to remember. This section presents just a 
sample of them — including a few you may already know.
Morning or evening sky
“Red sky at night, sailor’s delight. Red sky in morning, sailors take warning.” 
This weather proverb means that if the clouds take on a reddish hue in the 
morning, you can expect rain by the end of the day. If the evening sky is red, 
the weather will probably remain clear the following day.
Geese and seagulls
Geese and seagulls have a reputation for not flying before a storm. Biologists 
theorize that this behavior is because geese and seagulls have a harder time 
getting airborne in low-pressure (thin-air) conditions. Or maybe they’re just 
a lot smarter than people give them credit for and don’t want to get stuck out 
in a storm.

400
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Mosquitoes and black flies
If you’ve camped beside a body of fresh water prior to a storm’s arrival, you 
know that mosquitoes and black flies inevitably swarm and feast heavily up 
to 12 hours before the storm hits. You can bet the storm is almost upon you 
when the feasting frenzy subsides and the little buggers fly away to hide — 
about an hour before the weather turns.
Frogs
Frogs of all shapes and colors have an uncanny tendency to increase their ser-
enading several hours before a storm arrives. The reason they do this isn’t so 
much that they’re reliable weather forecasters. Rather, the increased humidity 
in the air from an incoming storm allows them to stay comfortably out of the 
water for longer periods (given that their skin must be kept moist at all times).
Halo around the sun and moon
In the summer, the sight of a hazy halo around the sun or moon is a good 
indication that a change in the present weather pattern is in the forecast — 
most often rain.
Frost and dew
The presence of heavy frost or dew early in the morning or late in the evening 
is a fairly reliable indicator that you can expect up to 12 hours of continued 
good weather.
Wind
“Wind from the south brings rain in its mouth.” Low-pressure systems 
create cyclonic winds that rotate in a counterclockwise direction. Because 
low-pressure systems are frequently associated with rainstorms, the rhyme 
proves quite accurate. Counterclockwise wind rotations create wind that 
blows from the south — wind that brings in the rain.
High-pressure systems are often associated with clear or clearing weather, 
with clockwise rotating winds. Keep aware of wind directions, and you’ll keep 
your finger on the weather’s pulse: Is it beating fair or foul?

Campfire smoke
By observing the smoke from your campfire, you can tell what type of pres-
sure system is in the area, low or high. If the smoke from the fire hangs low to 
the ground and dissipates into the branches, a low-pressure system is pres-
ent and rain is possible. If the smoke rises in a straight, vertical column, high 
pressure rules and you can anticipate fair weather (see Figure 3-4).
 
Figure 3-4:

hanging

cates rain, 
but smoke

Crickets
Believe it or not, you can estimate the air temperature (in degrees 
Fahrenheit) by counting the number of chirps a cricket emits over a 
14-second period and adding 40 to the number. So, if a cricket chirps 25 times 
over 14 seconds, you add 25 to 40 and arrive at 65 degrees. Scientific studies 
have proven that crickets are correct within a degree or two more than 75 
percent of the time.
 
Keep in mind, though, that air temperatures closer to the ground where the 
cricket resides will differ from the temperatures a few feet higher by as much 
as several degrees.

402
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Deer, bighorn sheep, and elk
Animals such as deer, bighorn sheep, and elk, which are common in moun-
tainous areas, commonly move down a mountain and into sheltered valleys 
as a storm approaches. They then move back up the mountain as a storm 
gets pushed out. The trouble with this weather indicator is that by the time 
you see the animals moving, the storm is already bearing down.
Surviving Weather Emergencies 
in the Great Outdoors
Lightning, tornadoes, snowstorms, and wildfires — all are powerful, natural 
events that result directly or indirectly from weather phenomena. And all can 
be safely avoided in most cases by following a few precautions.
Thunderstorms and lightning
Lightning is caused by the attraction of unlike electrical charges within a 
storm cloud or the earth. The friction caused by rapidly moving air particles, 
churning from the violent updrafts and downdrafts of air, leads to a build-
ing up of strong electrical charges. As the electrical pressure builds, charges 
between parts of the cloud or from the cloud to the earth are released, taking 
the form of lightning. Up to 30 million volts can be discharged by one light-
ning bolt. This power or explosive heating of the air is what causes the com-
pressions of thunder.
 
Thunderstorms are a dangerous companion to have when traveling exposed 
on a mountain peak. If a thunderstorm approaches when you and your hiking 
party are on an exposed peak or ridge, take the following precautions:
 
 Get off the ridge or peak if at all possible. Even moving to a few feet 
below the highest point is better than not moving at all.
 
 Get away from your pack. The metal in your pack conducts electricity, 
making you a prime target for a lightning strike.
 
 Position yourself on a dry surface. Ideally this dry surface is an insu-
lated one, such as a sleeping pad. If the sleeping pad gets soaked with 
rain, however, it’s useless and even dangerous because water conducts 
electricity.

403
 Chapter 3: Weathering the Outdoors
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
 Don’t lie down or sit. Instead, crouch with your feet close together. The 
idea is to minimize the available surface area through which possible 
ground currents from nearby lightning strikes may move.
 
 Don’t huddle next to a lone tree. Doing so is rather like hugging a light-
ning rod and expecting to be safe. Choose a cluster of trees instead and 
place yourself in the middle, preferably in an open area.
 
 Spread out the people in your group so theyíre at least 25 to 30 feet 
apart. The idea behind this tactic is to minimize the potential damage 
and injury if lightning does strike. With the group spread out, chances 
are only one person will be injured (if at all), leaving the rest of the party 
able to provide lifesaving assistance after the storm moves on.
 
 Avoid any depressions or caves. Such areas usually have moisture in 
them, making them more susceptible to conducting electricity.
 
 If you’re caught on a lake in a thunderstorm, assume a crouching posi-
tion toward the middle of the boat. Try to minimize your contact with 
wet objects.
Tornadoes
Tornadoes are perhaps the most violent and intense of all known storms, 
with winds in excess of 300 mph recorded in the vortex. Man-made structures 
seem to literally explode as the extremely low pressure within the vortex of 
a tornado causes the normal pressure trapped within structures to expand 
rapidly, ripping buildings to shreds from the inside out.
Violent updrafts recorded between 100 to 200 mph within the center of the 
funnel cloud have been known to suck anything within the tornado’s path 
hundreds of feet in the air before hurling the objects some distance away. 
Over bodies of water, funnel clouds lift water into the air, creating what’s 
known as a waterspout.
How far away is that thunderstorm?
You can roughly judge the distance of an 
approaching storm by observing the light-
ning’s flash followed by the resounding boom 
of thunder. For this method, count slowly, “one 
one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-
thousand” and so forth to approximate one 
second elapsed for each thousand counted.
After the lightning has flashed, begin to count. 
When you hear the thunder, stop counting. 
Every five seconds of elapsed time indicates 
one mile of distance. In other words, if the count 
reaches “seven-one thousand,” you can safely 
assume that the approaching thunderstorm is 
approximately 1.5 miles away.

404
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
 
Most tornado-related injuries and deaths are caused by debris flying through 
the air and objects falling over. If a tornado approaches, take these precautions:
 
 If you’re outside: Curl up in a tight ball in a drainage ditch, a culvert, or 
any other depression that will protect you, and cover your head.
 
 If you’re driving: Get out of your car and seek shelter in a sturdy build-
ing if one is nearby. If you’re out in the open, lie flat and face-down on 
low ground, and cover your head. Don’t attempt to wait out the passing 
tornado inside your car.
 
 If you’re indoors: Leave the windows closed and seek shelter in a base-
ment, if you have one, or in a room located in the center of the home 
with no windows or the fewest number of windows possible. Curl up 
against a wall, and cover your head.
 
 If you’re in a mobile home, RV, barn, or small building that you know 
isn’t sturdy or firmly anchored to the ground: Get out. The tornado 
will toss the structure about like a house of straw, and you’re in more 
danger inside it than you are outside of it.

here you live and the common fish in your local waters have a great 
deal to do with your catch options when fishing. Through the 50 or 
so generations that people have fished for sport (rather than necessity), 
they’ve sought out fish that offer a bit of a challenge to hook. How well the 
fish fight is another big consideration. Whether or not they taste good also 
counts. And personal preference plays a role as well — some people find that 
one type of fish is more fun to catch than another.
Of course, before you can enjoy the fish you hook and land, you have to 
clean them. No, cleaning fish isn’t the most fun part of fishing. In fact, on a 
cold night, standing at the dock and filleting a mess of bluefish is a miserable, 
smelly job. But if you want to eat fish, you have to clean fish, unless of course 
you’re a parent, in which case, you can have your kids clean them.
Trout
If the number of words written about a fish is any indication of popularity, 
then the trout is the runaway winner. A great deal of what has been written 
about trout is just a bunch of hot air, but separating the fish from a bunch of 
gasbag fishing writers, trout is a supreme game fish that is at least the equal 
of any other sport fish.

406
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
In the old days, an angler was judged by how many trout he or she brought 
home. These days, thanks largely to the influence of American anglers, catch-
and-release is more the rule. If you kill the occasional trout, however, don’t let 
anyone make you feel guilty about it. After all, it’s a delicious fish. On the other 
hand, if you kill every trout that you catch, you’re being more greedy than wise.
 
Trout are the top predator in their environment: They stand at the top of the 
food chain in many rivers and streams. Top predators are, of necessity, rarer 
than animals lower down the chain. A little bit of pressure can alter the qual-
ity of angling in a stream very quickly. So enjoy yourself and enjoy your meal, 
but remember that the fish you return to the stream will grow larger and 
have babies, giving you more fishing fun in the long run.
The champ: Brown trout
The brown trout is a fish designed for the angler in the following ways:
 
 It often feeds on the surface.
 
 It rises to a properly presented fly.
 
 It fights like the dickens.
 
 It’s one of the wiliest and most rewarding fish taken on rod and reel.
 
 Its instinct to dash for cover when hooked adds up to a great fight for 
the angler.
A cold-water fish, the brown trout lives in lakes and streams and is most 
active when the water temperature is in the 60s. A temperature much above 
80 degrees is liable to kill brown trout. This fish, shown in Figure 4-1, is cov-
ered with spots everywhere but its tail. The majority of these spots are deep 
brown (like coffee beans, but with a light yellow halo), but you can also find 
a few red and yellow spots sprinkled around its body. Brown trout are long-
lived animals and can weigh up to 40 pounds, but most stream-bred browns 
average less than 1 pound each.

The brown didn’t acquire a reputation as a “gentleman’s fish” because it had 
particularly good manners and went to the right school. The simple fact of the 
matter is that rich English gentlemen with time on their hands embraced the 
sport of angling and popularized it everywhere. Because their local fish was the 
brown trout, it became the fish of choice for sportsmen there and in the New 
World. If the English sportsmen had started out in Georgia rather than England, 
the largemouth bass would probably have a lot of flowery literature devoted to 
it. If those same anglers had lived in Mississippi, people may well have written 
about the simple virtues and great sporting qualities of the catfish.
High jumpers: Rainbow trout
Rainbow trout have many of the same characteristics of brown trout; they 
eat like them, feed like them, behave like them, and so on. In fact, rainbow 
trout coexist nicely with brown trout in many streams. But whereas the 
brown prefers the slower water and calmer pools, you can count on finding 
the rainbow in the more oxygen-rich and swift-running riffles. Of course, this 
scenario is what you’d expect from a fish that dominates the streams of the 
Rocky Mountains.
If you ask a hundred anglers to name the most memorable aspect about the 
fight of a rainbow, you may well have a hundred answers singling out the 
rainbow’s leaping ability. Although the brown, when hooked, usually sounds 
(dives to the bottom) and makes for cover, the rainbow’s instinct is to leap 
and run and leap some more. These acrobatics are thrilling and, on light 
tackle, demand a sensitive touch.
As Figure 4-2 shows, the rainbow may have spots over its whole body (although 
in many rivers and lakes, the larger rainbows are more often silver overall). 
A much more reliable sign of “rainbowness” is the pink band or line that runs 
along the flank of the fish from shoulder to tail. But even this indicator isn’t 
always 100-percent foolproof, because some stream-borne rainbows have a 
faded, almost invisible band and many spots, as do the brown and brook trout.

Guess what? More than a decade ago, scientists decided that the rainbow 
trout isn’t a trout after all. The same Englishmen who provided the lore of 
the brown trout decided to call the rainbow a trout, probably because of the 
rainbow’s troutlike characteristics. (Whenever the English arrived in a new 
country, they gave the local fish and game the names of similar animals back 
in Merrie Olde England.) Now the rainbow trout is officially recognized as a 
smaller cousin of the Pacific salmon family.
Colorful favorites: Brookies
Like the rainbow, the brook trout, or brookie, isn’t really a trout. It is, how-
ever, the fish that fills the trout niche in the cooler streams of the north-
eastern United States, east of the Allegheny Mountains. The brook trout is 
actually a char, which makes it a relative of the lake trout (also not a real 
trout, as explained in the later section “Big macks: Lakers”), the Dolly Varden, 
and the Arctic char.
That the brookie is found only in wilderness areas explains part of anglers’ 
fondness for it: This fish is a sign of pure water and a healthy ecology. 
Brookies like cooler water and can’t stand the higher temperatures that the 
brown and the rainbow can tolerate.
 
Before Europeans cleared the great hardwood forests of the northeastern 
United States, most streams had the shade and pure water that brook trout 
need. But with the clearing of the forests and the coming of brown trout and 
rainbow trout, the brookie often retreated to the less-accessible headwaters 
of many streams. As explained by the principle of “smaller fish in smaller 
water,” many people whose only brook trout experience is on these smaller 
waters assume that the brookie is typically smaller than the rainbow or the 
brown. Wrong. In the old days on Long Island, for example, many brookies 
ranged from 4 to 10 pounds.
Although much praised for its great beauty, many anglers regard the brookie as 
an empty-headed glamour-puss. This isn’t to say that very wary, hard-to-catch 
brookies aren’t out there, but by and large, most of them are prettier than they 
are smart.
The brook trout features many red spots that are surrounded by a blue halo. 
Its fins end in telltale black-and-white tips, and both its belly and fins have 
an orange cast that can be quite brilliant (and appear almost crimson during 
spawning season). The tail of the brook trout is more squared off than that of 
the brown or rainbow (see Figure 4-3), hence the nickname “squaretail.”

You can think of the cutthroat — which is really a cousin to the rainbow 
trout — as the Rocky Mountain version of the brook trout (described in the 
preceding section) because in many undisturbed waters, the cutthroat is the 
native fish. But because of ranching, logging, and the introduction of other 
game fish, the cutthroat has generally retreated to unpressured headwaters. 
It’s hard to tell in Figure 4-4, but cutthroats get their name from the slash of 
red or orange on their jaws and gills.

throat trout

Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Although supposedly not as intelligent as the brown trout, cutthroats (some-
times called cuts) can be extremely selective. They don’t have the head-shaking 
determination of the brown or the leaping instinct of the rainbow, but in all of 
Troutdom, there’s nothing like the surface take of the cutthroat: It comes up, 
sips the fly, and shows you its whole body before descending with the fly. All 
you need to do is come tight to the fish, and you’re on.
The cutthroat is the native trout in the drainage of the Yellowstone River, 
where it’s protected by a complete no-kill policy in all the flowing water in 
Yellowstone Park. To fish cutthroats at the outlet of Yellowstone Lake, how-
ever, is one of the great angling experiences in North America.
Big macks: Lakers
Widely known as Mackinaws or gray trout, the lake trout (or laker) is the 
largest char. It requires colder water than any other freshwater game fish, 
optimally about 50 degrees, and will die at 65 degrees.
Right after ice-out in the spring, and right before spawning in the autumn, 
lakers may be taken in shallow water. But during the rest of the season, you 
have to fish deeper, often trolling with wire line or lead core.
Unlike all the other trout (meaning true trout as well as rainbows and chars), 
the laker spawns in lakes, not streams. As shown in Figure 4-5, the laker, like 
the brookie, is heavily spotted. It has a forked tail (in contrast to the square 
tail of the brookie). The largest one ever taken on rod and reel weighed 66 
pounds, 8 ounces, and was caught in Canada’s Great Bear Lake on July 10, 
1991. A 102-pound laker was netted in Lake Athabasca in Saskatchewan.
Steelhead: A salty rainbow
Almost all species of trout, if given the chance, 
drop downstream to the ocean where they usu-
ally grow to much greater size than trout con-
fined to streams and lakes. Sea-run brookies 
and browns (meaning those that forage in the 
ocean and return to spawn in fresh water) also 
appear in North America, but the main target for 
anglers of sea-run trout is the steelhead, which 
is nothing more than a rainbow trout that has 
gone to sea. Steelhead have usually lost the 
distinctive coloration of the freshwater rainbow 
(although they still have the pink lateral line). As 
their name suggests, steelhead have a bright, 
metallic color.

Some lamebrains dumped a few lakers in Yellowstone Lake a few years 
ago. Prior to that, this lake had held the last pure strain of cutthroats in the 
Rockies. Unfortunately, the lakers began to prey on young cutthroat fry. 
Even worse, because lakers don’t run up rivers like cutthroats do, about 
20 percent of the food supply of the grizzly bear, osprey, and eagle is now 
gone from the local Yellowstone ecosystem — a prime case of messing with 
Mother Nature.
The Basses
Trout may win the number-of-pages-written-about-them contest, but if the 
number of anglers counts for anything, then the basses (largemouth and 
smallmouth) are certainly the most popular game fish in America. The 
largemouth and smallmouth are not, however, true basses. That distinc-
tion belongs to the basses of Europe, who had first dibs on the name. The 
American basses actually belong to the sunfish family. When you stop to con-
sider this situation, though, the largemouth and smallmouth don’t know or 
care what they’re called; and the American basses, also known as the black 
basses, are pretty amazing game fish.
 
Trying to pick up a bass by grabbing its body is about as easy as trying to 
diaper an angry baby. The little suckers can really squirm. Even worse than 
babies, bass have spiny fins that can deliver nasty pricks. With a bass (and 
with many other soft-mouthed fish), however, you can nearly immobilize it if 
you grab it by the lower lip, holding it between thumb and forefinger. Be very 
careful of hooks though, especially lures that have multiple treble hooks.

412
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Largemouth: A real catch
The largemouth bass, originally a native of the Mississippi drainage and the 
southeastern United States, was recognized early on as a prime game fish 
and has since been transplanted all over. Lakes, rivers, streams, and brack-
ish coastal water all have populations of largemouth bass. These fish take 
lures, plugs, flies, plastic worms, real worms, crayfish, and crickets. In short, 
they’re opportunistic feeders and are most catchable when the water is in 
the range of 65 to 75 degrees.
As shown in Figure 4-6, the jaw of the largemouth bass extends farther back 
than the eye (which isn’t true of the smallmouth bass described in the next 
section). The largemouth is usually dark gray to dark green in color with a 
dark band along the lateral line. Its dorsal fin is divided into two distinct por-
tions: hard spines in front and softer ones in the rear. The largemouth is also 
known as the bucketmouth because of its large mouth, which appears even 
larger when it attacks your lure, fly, or bait.
Truly, no experience in angling is as thrilling as the moment that a large-
mouth bass takes a topwater plug. There you are, on a still summer day, a 
few dragonflies buzzing around a lily pad, a frog or two basking in the heat. 
You cast a topwater plug to the lily pad and let it rest for a few seconds. Then 
you twitch it a couple times. A fierce ripple knocks into your plug, followed 
by the cause of the onrushing water — a ferocious largemouth bass that 
engulfs the plug. The instant it feels the hook, the largemouth shakes its head 
and jumps or dives, or both. It’s quite the impressive sight.
Smallmouth: The gamest fish
Like its largemouth cousin, the smallmouth bass is a native of the Mississippi 
drainage, which makes it a true heartland fish. Whereas the largemouth 
likes slow or still water with lots of food-holding weeds, the smallmouth pre-
fers clean, rocky bottoms and swifter water, ideally in the range of 65 to 68 
degrees. Any warmer than 73 degrees and you can forget about finding one. 
Lake-dwelling smallmouth often school up, which means that if you catch 
one, you can catch a bunch. In rivers and streams, they’re more solitary. The 
smallmouth is a pretty opportunistic feeder in general, but if you give it a 
choice, both crayfish and hellgrammites score well.
As shown in Figure 4-7, the smallmouth has a series of dark vertical bands 
along its flanks. The dorsal fin is one continuous fin (as opposed to the sepa-
rate spiny and soft parts on a largemouth’s fin). Another difference is that the 
smallmouth’s upper jaw doesn’t extend backward beyond its eye.

                                        Good Eats: Walleye
On a number of trips to the state of Minnesota, more than one angler has 
been known to say, “You can have your bass, and you can have your trout, 
but the walleye is the best eatin’ fish there is, bar none!” This largest member 
of the perch family does indeed rank right up there with the best in terms 
of taste. In fact, its excellent flavor may explain why walleye are often the 
preferred fish when they’re available. In addition to being delicious, they’re 
found in schools, hang out around underwater structures, and usually locate 
themselves near a drop-off. In other words, they behave just as a textbook 
game fish should — not a pushover, but not impossible to catch either.
Note: In many places, you can hear people talk about a walleyed pike, which 
is a local name for walleye but not an accurate one. The pike is a completely 
different animal, as explained in the next section.

414
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
As you can see in Figure 4-8, the walleye is a torpedo-shaped fish with big 
eyes, a brownish-greenish color, and a white tip on its tail and dorsal fin. The 
walleye requires a great deal of water and is rarely found in smaller lakes or 
ponds. Clear water and a rocky bottom are also high on its list of environ-
mental preferences, as is a water temperature in the mid-60s (and certainly 
never higher than the mid-70s). The walleye eats any bait fish that’s available; 
both leeches and worms are terrific bait if you can’t find any bait fish.
The take of the walleye is subtle, not unlike the way a bass plays with a worm 
and then swims away with it before finally deciding to eat. Be sure to give the 
walleye time to accomplish this maneuver before striking.
The walleye is a very light-sensitive fish, so although you may take one in 
shallow water, chances are you’ll do so only in low-light conditions.

You can 
always tell a 
walleye by

                                               Pike and Its Cousins
For flat-out mean looks, nothing in freshwater rivals the looks of a pike, mus-
kellunge, or pickerel. A long fish with big eyes, a pointed snout, and rows of 
stiletto teeth, the average pike looks like what you might get if you crossed a 
snake, a bird, and a shark.
 
When landing a pike, muskie, or pickerel, be extremely careful of its sharp 
teeth. These fish are about the nastiest creatures in freshwater fishing. As 
shown in Figure 4-9, the safest way to land any of ’em is to grab ’em by the 
eye sockets (not the eye!).
Northern pike
The most popular member of the pike family is usually known simply as the 
pike but is also sometimes called a northern. By either name, it’s a native of 
the Great Lakes and its cooler tributaries.

Book IV
Getting

Figure 4-9: 
The finger-
preserving 
way to 
land a pike, 
muskie, or 
pickerel.
 
You’re liable to find pike in weedy shallows where they wait for prey to 
ambush. As stealthy as a lion in wait and as swift as a springing panther, pike 
stalk and pursue their prey most actively at water temperatures in the mid-60s.
As shown in Figure 4-10, the pike is a sleek and ferocious-looking predator 
that’s clearly designed to attack and devour. All forms of bait fish, game fish, 
birds, muskrats, frogs, snakes, snails, leeches, and anything else the pike 
finds within striking distance can eventually find its way into a pike’s belly.
Depending on the type of bait you use, follow this advice when striving to 
snare a pike:
 
 When fishing with live bait: Give the pike time. Sometimes it’ll snare a 
bait fish crosswise and take some time to maneuver it into swallowing 
position. Usually, a pike pauses right before it swallows any bait. When 
the pike pauses, strike.
 
 When fishing with artificials: Strike when the pike does. You’ll be 
rewarded by the sight of the writhing form of the pike rocketing from the 
water. Don’t be fooled when the pike seems to surrender after a fierce, 
but short, initial run. As soon as it sees you or your boat, you usually get 
a very satisfying second (and even third) run. The Daredevle is an amaz-
ingly effective pike lure.

                                            Muskellunge
If you’re the kind of person who likes the odds in the state lottery, you 
should enjoy fishing for muskellunge, or muskie. The old-timers say that fish-
ing for muskie takes 10,000 casts for every strike. And then when you do get 
a muskie on, its teeth are so sharp, it can be so big, and its fight can be so 
dogged, that it takes brawn and skill to land one. If you do though, you have a 
real trophy.
Like the pike featured in the preceding section, the muskie hangs out in likely 
ambush spots: weed beds, deep holes, drop-offs, and over sunken islands. 
Although it spends most of its time in the depths, the muskie appears to do 
most of its feeding in shallower water (at less than 15 feet). Optimum water 
temperature for muskies is in the low 60-degree range.
The muskie is a northern fish, found in the upper parts of the Mississippi 
drainage, the St. Lawrence River, all over New England, and throughout most 
of Canada. It’s an opportunistic predator that strikes any number of baits or 
lures in any number of ways. Sometimes a muskie strikes far from your boat; 
other times it follows a lure right up to the gunwales. Because the muskie 
is so completely unpredictable, a beginning muskie fisherman should hire a 
guide or a local expert for help until getting the hang of snaring this beast.
Figure 4-11 shows a muskie. Note that its appearance is quite similar to that 
of a pike. You can’t always be sure which is which unless you get pretty close 
to the fish, in which case you can see that the muskie, in contrast to the pike, 
has no scales on its lower cheek and gill covers. Its markings tend to look like 
dark bars or spots, whereas northern pike usually have lighter-colored spots 
that are shaped like beans.

                        Pickerel
Though smaller than the pike and the muskie, the pickerel is in every other 
way as pugnacious and predatory as its larger cousins. The pickerel is to 
angling what the toy is to a box of Cracker Jack — the toy isn’t the reason 
you buy the snack, but it’s a nice surprise when you get a good one. Likewise, 
many a bassless day has been saved by the voracious appetite of the pick-
erel. Figure 4-12 shows a chain pickerel, whose dark green side markings 
appear to line up like the links of a chain.
 
If you’re working a spoon or spinner, you have a better chance if you retrieve 
your lure parallel to a weed bed, because you never know where a pickerel 
may be hanging out. Fishing for pickerel in water in the upper 60s usually gar-
ners the best results.

Pacific Salmon
Few fish are as delicious as the Pacific salmon (which is one of the reasons 
they’re so heavily harvested by commercial fishermen). Pacific salmon come 
upstream to spawn and have pink flesh, just like Atlantic salmon do. The 
two types of fish even taste the same. But the six species of Pacific salmon 
(including the coho and chinook) are completely different animals than the 
Atlantic salmon, which is the only true salmon. The Pacifics are the much 
larger, mostly ocean-going cousins of the rainbow trout.
Some years ago, Pacific salmon were introduced into the Great Lakes to help 
control the spread of the alewife herring. The alewives were so plentiful and 
the salmon fed so well on them that the Great Lakes now hold the greatest 
fishery for both the coho and chinook sport-fisherman. In their natural range, 
however, overfishing has dangerously depleted them, as has the construction 
of dams.
Pacific salmon prefer cold water, about 55 degrees. They move with currents 
and tides to maintain themselves in that thermocline, which is a fancy way of 
saying “a region in a body of water with a specific temperature.” As for where 
they’re located, a cold front may bring Pacific salmon close to shore, but a 
wind also may drive the cold water and the fish farther offshore. When look-
ing for them in a lake, using a thermometer to check water temperature is 
absolutely necessary.
Shallow-water and stream anglers have the most luck when Pacific salmon 
gather at stream mouths just before spawning. Fishing when the salmon are 
still bright, or fresh from the ocean or lake, can be great sport with these 
brawny, athletic fish. After they’ve been in the stream for any length of time, 
landing even a 30-pound fish is about as much fun as lugging a duffel bag full 
of books up a steep staircase.
As with many saltwater fish, or fish that spend a good amount of time in salt-
water (the term for fish that live in both fresh and saltwater is anadromous), 
the chinook and coho like flashy, bright-colored lures. For bait, you may be 
hard-pressed to find better than smelt or alewives. Salmon eggs are a fine 
choice as well. (Which always begs this question: Why would a fish want to 
eat its next generation?)
Figure 4-13 shows the coho and chinook salmon. The usually smaller coho 
has black spots only on the upper part of its tail, whereas the chinook’s tail 
is spotted on both top and bottom. The chinook’s dorsal fin is spotted; the 
coho’s isn’t. The gum in the lower jaw of the coho is grayish, but the same 
gum in the chinook is black.

In many areas, particularly in the Great Lakes, fish can pick up toxic pol-
lutants. The presence of pollutants doesn’t make Pacific salmon less fun to 
catch, but eating fish from these waters isn’t a good idea. Always check the 
local health advisories before you take a fish for a meal.

                                                       Panfish
Panfish is really a catchall category that includes a whole range of fish, 
including most of the sunfish (except the largemouth and smallmouth bass) 
as well as crappie. Panfish are called panfish because they fit in a frying pan. 
This fact tells you something — namely, that panfish are good to eat.
In addition to edibility, another good feature of panfish is their catchability. 
Whether caught with a cane pole, fly rod, or light spinning rig, panfish are 
extremely sporty. Worms, grubs, crickets, little spinners, popping bugs, 
dry flies, small jigs, bread balls, and corn are all effective panfish catchers. 
Because they’re often the runts of the pond or stream, panfish pretty much 
attack anything that looks remotely edible.
Some of the more popular panfish include the following, all shown in Figure 4-14:

 Bluegill: Sometimes known as the bream, the bluegill has a blue edge to 
the breast area and a dark ear flap. It’s probably the most-caught sport 
fish in America.
 
 White crappie: Very widespread all over North America, this fish takes 
all kinds of bait and small lures. It thrives in silty and slow-moving water 
and flourishes in the South. The white crappie is the only sunfish with 
six spines on its dorsal fin.
 
 Black crappie: This fish prefers somewhat clearer water than the white 
crappie. Because of its mottled skin (the white crappie is more barred), 
a local name for the black crappie is calico bass.
 
 Perch: Both white and yellow perch are utterly delicious fish. French 
chefs steam them in parchment and call the process en papillote. In 
Door County, Wisconsin, the old-time commercial fishermen would get 
the same effect by wrapping their perch in wet newspapers along with 
some onions, salt, and pepper and throwing them on the housing of 
their overworked diesel engines. Because these fishermen cooked on 
the domes of their engines, their meals were called “domers.”
Catfish
The United States is home to more than 20 species of catfish (including bull-
heads). They’re very popular because of their catchability, accessibility, 
affordability (due to the relatively low cost of the tackle required to catch 
them), and delicious taste. People usually eat crispy fried catfish the way 
they eat potato chips — until the last one is gone. Figure 4-15 clearly shows 
the difference between proper catfish and bullheads. Notice, however, that 
both have long whiskers, or barbels.
Because catfish are nocturnal feeders, they rely on touch, taste, and smell to 
identify food. Some of the most nose plug-requiring baits — called, appropri-
ately, stinkbaits — attract catfish even though they smell as ripe as a mara-
thoner’s sweat socks.
 
When bait fishing, keep your bait on the bottom. That’s where the catfish are. 
Lures aren’t that productive except with the channel cat, which is found in 
somewhat clearer moving water and often takes a deep-running plug, spoon, 
or jig.
Catfish are active in warm water and may be taken with water temperatures 
in the high 80s.

422
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
 
When you handle a catfish, it will “lock” together its pectoral and dorsal fins. 
The projecting spines are very sharp and carry a toxin. Though not fatal, a 
wound from these spines can be nasty and painful. If you’re pricked while 
handling a catfish, treat the wound immediately with a disinfectant because 
swift action often nullifies the poison. Then apply a bandage. Your revenge 
on the catfish is that you get to eat it.

Shad
The shad, which is a large member of the herring family, lives most of its life 
at sea and returns to the river of its birth to spawn and die. The shad doesn’t 
feed after it enters a river, but it can be induced to strike a brightly colored 
fly or lure. Because most shad lures, called darts, look like really cheesy cos-
tume jewelry, you have to wonder about what shads are thinking.
When hickory shad are in the rivers, thousands of white pelicans come in 
from the Atlantic to feast on their carcasses. In the northern part of the 
United States, the main river systems for shad anglers are the Delaware, 
Susquehanna, and Connecticut, where you can take them from a boat or 
while wading.

423
 Chapter 4: Field Guide to Freshwater Fish (And How to Clean Them)
Book IV
Getting

When playing a shad, remember that its mouth is very soft. Give it room to 
run. If you try to horse the fish (meaning muscle it in), you’ll surely pull your 
lure or fly out. If you let it run, it’ll reward you with a number of beautiful 
leaps, just like a salmon.
Both the American and the hickory shad have the large scales and deeply 
forked tails characteristic of the herring family, as shown in Figure 4-16. The 
hickory shad is generally smaller though, and its lower lip extends out past 
its upper lip.

The Atlantic salmon is regarded by many as the aristocrat of fishes. Perhaps 
it has this reputation because you have to be an aristocrat to be able to 
afford a few days on one of the choice salmon rivers. Not surprisingly with 
something that has become the sporting property of upper-class gentlemen, 
you must fish for Atlantic salmon with a fly rod. On many rivers, you also 
have to rent a guide. Don’t hold any of this against the Atlantic salmon — it 
had very little to do with all the tradition surrounding it.

424
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
The Atlantic salmon is a cousin to the brown trout but spends most of its 
time at sea (although a salmon’s infancy is passed in a river, and it’s to that 
river that it returns to spawn). Shown in Figure 4-17, this fish doesn’t die after 
spawning once, so you may return a salmon to the stream after catching it and 
be confident that it may well return to create even more fish the following year.
This practice is good because the Atlantic salmon is a pressured animal. 
Despite the efforts of fishery biologists, transplanting this magnificent game 
fish to the Pacific has proved impossible. Perhaps if the current Atlantic 
salmon population is preserved, its numbers will return to what they were 
back in George Washington’s day, when these fish were so plentiful that farm-
ers used them for fertilizer!
 
If plenty of action is what you crave, salmon fishing isn’t for you: Just one fish 
a day is a very good average on most streams.

                                      Cleaning and Storing Your Catch
For the sake of good eating, as well as being a nice person, you really should 
kill a fish right away (the exception is if you have a live well on your boat 
that’s big enough to hold fish and keep them alive). Leaving a fish to flop, 
squirm, and suffocate — whether it’s in your creel, in an ice chest, or lying 
on the sand at the beach — is never good form. If you want to eat your catch, 
killing it quickly provides two great advantages:
 
 A quick kill allows you to dress the fish at the peak of freshness. All those 
guts can affect the flavor of the fish if you leave them in there all day.
 
 As with tomatoes or peaches, bruised tissue is mealy. A dead fish 
doesn’t flop around and bruise its flesh trying to escape.
 
Invest in a small club called a fish priest. When you have a fish you want to 
eat, just whack it over the head a couple times to kill it quickly.

425
 Chapter 4: Field Guide to Freshwater Fish (And How to Clean Them)
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
Of course, after you kill your fish, you have to store it and clean it. The 
following sections offer techniques for doing both.
Storing fish for transport
Part of the reason that fish can turn so quickly is that they’re so delicate. When 
handled with proper tender loving care, a well-cooked fish is one of the fresh-
est-tasting meals you can eat. A.J. McClane, a revered angler and fishing jour-
nalist, once explained the smell of fresh fish by saying that all fish, when kept 
properly fresh, will smell a little bit like a cucumber that you just sliced open.
Following are the basics on the various schools of thought on properly stor-
ing fish. Take your pick:
 
 Willow creel: The willow creel, a basketlike cage for storing fish that’s 
made out of willow branches, is a freshwater-angler classic for a reason: 
The weave of the willow branches allows air to circulate, which is what 
you want. If you use a willow creel, the accepted old-timey way to keep 
fish is to line the bottom of the creel with green grass and then to put 
layers of grass between the layers of fish. This method is good for a few 
hours (no more) in hot weather.
 
 Canvas creel: Less pricey than a willow creel, a canvas creel usually has 
a washable plastic liner inside a canvas outer bag. If you dip the creel 
in water and get it good and soaked, evaporation helps cool the fish. As 
with the willow creel, the canvas creel is for the freshwater angler.
 
 Ice chest: Open the chest; put the dead fish in; and close the chest. It’s 
that simple.
 
 Live well: You can find live wells, compartments through which water 
passes, on many boats. In most cases, you can keep fish alive in them for 
hours.
 
 A stringer: A stringer is a piece of string, rope, or a specially designed set 
of metal clips passed through one gill of the fish. You can keep a mess of 
fish alive this way by tying one end of the string to your boat and putting 
the other end (with all the fish on it) back in the water.
Cleaning, or Why God made 
day-old newspapers
Fish cleaning can be a kitchen-destroying operation, what with scales flying 
everywhere, drying and sticking to everything, and guts sliding off the 
counter and clogging up the sink. (Honestly, part of the reason many wives 

426
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
secretly hope their husbands come home fishless is that they don’t want 
to deal with the mess!) Guess what — it doesn’t have to be that messy. 
Whenever possible, clean your fish before bringing it into the kitchen.
 
You need only one tool to dress most fish: a good knife. The Dexter, an 
American-made, carbon steel knife that retails for less than $20, is a good 
one; it sharpens easily, holds an edge fairly well, and performs double duty 
for vegetable slicing, cheese slicing, and any other general chopping or slic-
ing chore. The Martini, which is a very thin Finnish fillet knife that also works 
well as an all-rounder, is good, too — but in the end, the Dexter works the 
best. Its blade is thin and has a slight curve that works well for filleting tasks, 
and it has enough oomph to cut through the backbone of a larger fish when 
you’re making steaks. The downside is that it doesn’t come with a sheath or 
holder. Instead, most anglers fashion a case for it out of two pieces of card-
board taped together.
Scaling
 
Although every fish has scales, not every fish needs to be scaled. The scales 
on a trout, for example, are so small that you don’t have to worry about 
them. In fact, you wouldn’t know there were any scales on a trout if someone 
hadn’t told you.
Note: If you’re going to fillet your fish and remove its skin, you don’t need to 
scale it. Otherwise, here’s what you do:
 
1. Lay out about four spreads of newspaper.
 
2. Run your knife against the grain of the scale.
 
 Your motion should be firm enough to remove the scales, but not so 
strong that they go flying all over the place.
 
3. When you’ve finished scaling, lift the fish and peel back the top sheet 
of paper.
 
4. Lay the fish down on the next (clean) sheet of newspaper and throw 
out the top sheet with the scales.
 
5. Rinse the fish.
Gutting
You gut a fish to get rid of the organs in the body cavity. These organs are 
filled with all kinds of gunk, including digestive juices. For this reason, you 
want to exercise care when slitting open the fish’s belly. You’ll have less 
mess and keep the flesh fresher if you don’t pierce the organs while gutting.

427
 Chapter 4: Field Guide to Freshwater Fish (And How to Clean Them)
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
To gut a fish the right way, follow these instructions:
 
1. Lay out about four spreads of newspaper.
 
2. With your knife blade pointed toward the fish’s head, pierce the 
stomach cavity and make a slit toward the head.
 
 Try not to make too deep a cut, just enough to get through the top layer 
of skin and flesh.
 
3. Pointing the knife toward the tail, completely open the stomach 
cavity.
 
4. Reach in and pull out the guts.
 
5. Detach the gills with the knife, or simply pull away.
 
6. Wrap the guts and gills in the top sheet of paper and discard.
Filleting
Filleting a fish requires a certain amount of touch, but expending a little 
more effort at the cleaning and filleting stage is worth it, because it means 
no bones at the eating stage. When you get the hang of filleting, you can zip 
through a pile of fish pretty quickly, and it gives you a sense of accomplish-
ment that you can do something as well as the old-timers.
 
Don’t worry too much if you don’t get absolutely all the meat off the fish when 
you first start filleting. The idea at the beginning is just to get some meat. If 
you skin the fish, as recommended, you don’t have to scale it first. Obviously, 
if you’re going to use the skin, scale it — unless you really enjoy eating scales.
Following are the basics of filleting a small fish (up to about 5 pounds), as 
shown in Figure 4-18:
 
1. Cut off the head just behind the gills.
 
2. Hold the fish by the tail, and with the knife blade pointing away from 
you and across the body of the fish, begin to cut toward where the 
head used to be.
 
 Use the backbone to guide your knife.
 
3. To take the skin off, begin by holding the fillet by the tail, skin 
side down.
 
4. Hold the knife crosswise across the fillet and insert the knife between 
the skin and the flesh.
 
 Don’t worry if you don’t get this move perfect at first.
 
5. While holding the skin, cut in the direction of the former head.

428
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
When you have a larger fish, the tail-to-head method of filleting can be a little 
awkward. In this case, opening the fish like a book is an effective approach, 
as shown in Figure 4-19. Follow these steps:
 
1. Make a deep cut just behind the gills (about halfway through the 
thickness of the fish).
 
2. Cut a slit a few inches in length along the top of the fish (the dorsal 
side).
 
3. Using the tip of your knife, separate the flesh from the bones, as 
illustrated.
 
 If you do this step properly, the fish opens up just like a book.
 
4. When completely open, finish cutting away the fillet by moving the 
knife along the “spine of the book.”
Cutting steaks
Fish steak is a time-honored dish, but many people don’t go in for cooking 
fish steaks because they’re too dry. Here’s some advice: Just make thinner 
steaks, about an inch or less.
 
You can use a Dexter knife for making steaks, or a wide-bladed chef’s knife 
(the kind chefs use on TV to chop vegetables).
Follow these steps to cut fish steaks (referring to Figure 4-20 as you go):
 
1. Scale the fish.
 
 Refer to the instructions in the earlier “Scaling” section for guidance.
 
2. Make a row of cuts crosswise along the fish.
 
 Space the cuts so that they’re the thickness of the steaks.
 
3. Cut down to the backbone.
 
4. With a mallet, a rolling pin, or a thick branch, strike the back of the 
knife blade so that it goes through the backbone.
 
 This isn’t the place to perfect a big swing for your rock-breaking tech-
nique in case you ever end up on a chain gang. A short chop should do it.
 
5. If your stroke doesn’t completely detach the steak, continue to cut 
through the flesh and skin until the steak falls away from the rest of 
the fish.

        Freezing for freshest taste
Frozen fish doesn’t have the consistency of flesh that has never been 
frozen. The physics behind this fact are simple: Living cells are filled with 
water; water expands when frozen, and this expansion breaks down tissue. 
However, if you aren’t going to eat fish right away — like within a day — then 
you really should freeze it to keep the fish tasting fresh.
For example, many people often express that they don’t like the taste of 
bluefish. It’s too oily, they say, or too fishy. What they’re really referring to is 
the taste of fish oil that has come in contact with the air and turned rancid. 
Bluefish has a lot of oil, so unless you cook it on the day you catch it, it will 
have that oily, fishy taste. Freezing stops this process short and preserves 
the fish’s fresh taste.
 
Freeze fish that you’ve filleted first. Wrap each fillet in wax paper and store 
them all in a sealable plastic bag, keeping the fillets flat.

Chapter 5
Outdoor Fun for Adults and Kids
In This Chapter
 Checking out several activities to do outdoors when imagination fades
 Watching wildlife and gathering specimens
 Making great photographs of your adventures
 Stargazing through the seasons
You can do an infinite number of activities to entertain everyone in your 
camping party, whether they’re adults or children — or adults acting 
like children.
As with any activity you choose, be sure that it always adheres to these 
guidelines: It must be safe; it must not disturb the wildlife; it must not 
damage the environment in any way; it must not disturb other campers; and 
it should be fun.
That said, turn your campers loose! Youngsters (of all ages) are limited only 
by their imaginations when it comes to having fun on a camping trip. Choices 
include such all-time favorites as tree climbing, crawfish hunting, firefly chas-
ing, cloud watching, meadow crawling, and playing hide-and-seek, among 
many tantalizing alternatives.
Fun and Games
When your campers finally run out of their own great ideas for fun, you can 
be ready with a long list of suggestions. The following sections present some 
favorite games and other fun activities to enjoy with children or an adventur-
ous group of adults.

432
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Fox and hare
Fox and hare is a fun game that teaches anyone to become aware of his sur-
roundings to such an extent that he’s able to follow the trail of something 
because of the signs it leaves. Begin by designating the hare (usually an 
adult) and the foxes (usually children and another adult for supervision). 
Initially, give the hare a two- to five-minute head start — enough that the 
foxes lose sight of him. During this time, the hare leaves signs for the foxes to 
follow, such as bits of colored paper on the ground or in branches, that aren’t 
too obvious yet are distinct enough to be followed with minimal effort. As the 
foxes gain more and more experience, give the hare a longer head start; the 
hare in turn begins leaving bits of paper that more closely match the color of 
the terrain. As a variation, the hare can drag a branch behind him, leaving a 
more subtle trail for the foxes to follow.
 
The goal of the game is for the foxes to successfully follow the trail of the 
hare and catch the hare. So feel free to use your imagination to adapt the 
hare’s role and the trail he leaves any way you want.
Blind trust
Blind trust teaches participants to listen carefully to directions and to use 
their other senses of awareness. It also teaches important communication 
and leadership skills.
Play this game in a fairly wooded area with some small hills and narrow 
gullies or other obstacles. Blindfold all in the group except the designated 
leader. For the first time around, the designated leader should be an adult. 
The idea is for the leader to guide his group through the woods, going over, 
around, and under obstacles using only voice commands to give directions. 
At no time is the leader allowed to move obstacles or touch the players.
 
Have a parent or other adult keep a watchful eye on the group at all times to 
maintain a margin of safety. Otherwise you could wind up with a child trying 
to lead her group over a gully using a narrow log as a bridge.
Snapshot
Snapshot is great fun, and you can play it anywhere. It teaches children to 
use their observation skills efficiently and accurately. One person plays 
the role of the camera or lens, and the other person works the shutter or 
picture-taking button. The person guiding the camera searches for beautiful, 

433
 Chapter 5: Outdoor Fun for Adults and Kids
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
interesting, or creative images that the camera can photograph. He sets up 
the camera, who must keep her eyes closed until told to open them, so that 
a picture can be taken. The camera guide snaps the photo by tapping the 
camera on the shoulder or hand. The camera opens her eyes without moving 
or twisting about and stares at the image in front of her. After about five sec-
onds, the camera guide taps the camera’s shoulder or hand, and the camera 
closes her eyes.
 
Allow your child to be the photographer, using you as the camera, and you’ll 
be afforded a unique and quite possibly very moving look at how your child 
views what’s fascinating and beautiful.
Stalking
In the game of stalking, one person, the prey, sits with his eyes closed at one 
end of a roughly 25-feet-wide clearing. Everyone else tries to stalk the person 
without being heard. If the prey hears a sound, he points to the direction it 
came from and opens his eyes. If the stalker is able to freeze and not move 
while the prey is watching, then the game continues. If, however, the prey 
opens his eyes after pointing and the stalker moves at all — even a flinch — 
the stalker becomes the prey.
Sledding
All it takes is one wild, snow-spraying ride on a sled to bring out the youth 
that’s hibernating in many adults. Winter play is all about snow and getting 
around on it. But you don’t have to shell out big bucks to experience the thrill 
of sledding. Look around for the following free or inexpensive sled substitutes:
 
 Garbage bags: Get a box of 20 or more 36-gallon-size, heavyweight, gar-
den-variety garbage bags. Double up the bags, slide your legs inside (if 
you can fit) or sit on top (although this method isn’t nearly as secure), 
and rip off a run or two before the bags shred into oblivion.
 
 Discarded inner tubes: Find these objects at a local truck stop or truck 
repair center. If they’re available, you can often get them for the price of 
a few patches to seal the holes.
 
 Cafeteria tray: If you went to high school or college in any state that had 
snow on the outdoor menu, you’re probably familiar with a favorite pas-
time: racing downhill perched on a serving tray pinched from the school 
cafeteria. The ride is wild, fast, uncontrolled, and monumentally unfor-
gettable. Find a tray for about $1.50 at a restaurant-supply store.

434
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
 
 Air mattresses: For a cushy ride at high speeds, opt for a cheap plastic 
air mattress available for about $10 at any camping or sporting goods 
store. If the mattress survives the day, you can sleep on it that night.
 
 Snow shovel: Yes, there’s even a school in New Mexico that teaches you 
the finer points of shovel racing. Suffice it to say that all you really need is a 
large snow shovel, a steep hill, and a smidgen of insanity. Sit on the shovel, 
holding the handle in front of you, lift your feet, and hang on! You can buy 
a snow shovel for about $15 at any hardware store, or simply borrow your 
neighbor’s — tell him you’ll shovel his driveway when you return.
Campfire songs
Singing around the campfire is a time-honored tradition. If you’re completely 
inept at remembering songs, pick up a copy of Campfire Songs by Irene 
Maddox. This book features 192 pages of rounds, songs, and ballads — many 
with guitar chords, should you happen to be musically inclined.
Nature Activities
Encouraging folks to tune in to the world around them is important. For 
many, the sights and sounds of the night air in the mountains or desert are 
sources of discomfort and anxiety simply because they don’t know what they 
are. Yet everywhere you look, nature is there. To see nature, all you have to 
do is open your eyes and ears, whether you’re hiking down a trail or sitting 
quietly by a campfire. The following sections offer ideas to help you enjoy all 
the not-so-hidden gems that nature has to offer.
 
When you go traipsing off into the wild, remember to respect private property 
(always get permission before venturing out) and keep in mind some simple tips:
 
 Don’t pick plants or disturb nature in any way when on public property. 
“Look but don’t touch” is the creed here. Touching and picking disturbs 
the beauty for others who may want to experience in the future what 
you’re enjoying in the present.
 
 Respect nature by treating habitats with care. No turning over rocks, 
breaking apart downed logs, or poking sticks into holes. After all, ani-
mals live in these places.
 
 Pick wildflowers or plants on private land only when you have per-
mission and only if you don’t decimate the habitat in the process. Pick 
selectively and conservatively — and only if there are many plants to 
choose from.

435
 Chapter 5: Outdoor Fun for Adults and Kids
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
 
 Never pick an endangered plant or wildflower, no matter where it 
may grow or how many you see in the meadow or forest. This meadow 
or forest may be the last one in which these plants are growing! How 
do you tell what’s endangered and what’s not? Ask a ranger or other 
informed person. When in doubt, don’t touch.
 
If you’re out experiencing nature, having the right gear can enhance the expe-
rience. The naturalist gear you need varies depending on your level of exper-
tise. Junior naturalists (beginners) should choose only from those items 
listed in the “Junior naturalist” list. Casual naturalists (avid novices) should 
choose from everything in both the “Junior naturalist” and “Casual natural-
ist” lists. Hard-core naturalists (experienced, even a little) may choose their 
gear from all three lists.
 
 Junior naturalist (beginner)

Hanging out in a hammock
There’s an art to doing nothing, which is, frankly, one of the things you 
should specialize in when outdoors. For that very reason, you should tote 
along a couple of hammocks whenever you car-camp. No, there aren’t always 
places to hang them in camp, but when there are, a hammock’s presence 
announces to the world: “Mellow dude in camp — do not disturb.”
Swinging gently in the late afternoon sun while the breezes tease the leaves 
in the trees above is perhaps one of the most relaxing moments imaginable. 
However, don’t just flop into a hammock, because relaxation will be the far-
thest thing from your mind.
 
Folks who lie end-to-end in a hammock find little rest and relaxation — their 
hindquarters drag the dust while their heads and feet point skyward. The 
secret is in proper positioning. If you lie diagonally in a hammock, forces that 
you learned about in high school physics come into play and — presto — your 
body gains support, and your mind finds peace. Consider keeping a stuff sack 
filled with a soft parka (for under your head), a water bottle, and a favorite 
book handy for ultimate relaxation. If mosquitoes or biting flies are a problem, 
keep a head net handy, too.
Playing world above/world below
A quiet, observational activity, world above/world below only works if your 
children are feeling calm and not overly agitated. To study the world above, 
have everyone lie still on their backs, looking up. (This game is best played 
under a dense canopy of leaves or swirling clouds, or in dense, tall grass.)

437
 Chapter 5: Outdoor Fun for Adults and Kids
Book IV
Getting 
Outdoors
World below is, as you’d expect, the opposite of world above. All the players 
lie on their stomachs and watch the world as it passes by underneath their 
faces. World below works outstandingly well at a stream or lake edge, above 
a tide pool, or in a dense patch of grasses or fallen leaves. If the ground is 
cold or hard, bring ensolite (sleeping) pads for everyone to lie on.
Practicing a night-world vigil
Going on a night walk with your children in the wilderness is a wonderful 
experience you shouldn’t miss. It can, however, be somewhat unsettling for 
first-timers and is best enjoyed if a little forethought and preparation go into 
the adventure. If you can rehearse a night-world vigil at home, so much the 
better. Here’s how:
Pick a night that’s going to be clear with no moon. Turn out all the lights in 
the house so there’s a minimum of artificial light illuminating the backyard. 
With a flashlight, walk out into the backyard and sit down under a tree or 
somewhere that’s comfortable. Bring a blanket along if desired.
With the flashlight on, show your child that although it seems lighter with the 
flashlight, your vision is really limited to the beam of the light. Now, turn off 
the light, sit quietly, and notice the following:
 
 Sights: How does the backyard seem different in the dark? Why? When 
the time seems right, walk back to the house without the flashlight. 
Point out to your child how much better his vision is without the light.
 
 Sounds: Explain and talk about each sound as you hear it: a dog barking, a 
bat flitting through the air, a siren, or a mouse rustling in the compost pile. 
Begin to help your child distinguish between those sounds that are heard 
in the day and those heard at night. Ask him why some animals only come 
out at night and what makes them different from daytime animals.
Hugging a tree
Hugging a tree is an excellent exercise that teaches children to tap into their 
perceptual skills. Blindfold your child and lead her to a nearby tree. Ask her 
to get to know the tree by hugging it, touching it, smelling it, and listening 
to it. Ask her to describe the tree to you — its size, its age, and its shape. 
After your child feels that she really knows the tree, lead her away, spin 
her around, and remove the blindfold. Then ask your child to find her tree. 
Children discover that accomplishing this task requires all their senses and 
that it’s possible to “see” and “know” an object without eyes. After your child 
finds her tree, let her blindfold you and lead you through the exercise so you 
can be a participant too.

438
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Going for a stream walk
A stream walk is a terrific nature activity, but it requires you to take some 
safety precautions. Be sure that everyone wears old tennis shoes and that 
the day is warm. Beware of slippery rocks, sharp sticks and other objects, 
poisonous snakes, and hypothermia. Don’t stay in the cold water too long. 
Bring along magnifying glasses, aquarium nets, several face masks, and clear 
plastic dishes about 6 inches across, or your homemade underwater viewing 
can. (See “Checking out tide pools,” later in this chapter, to find out how to 
assemble your own viewing can.)
Choose a section of stream that’s not too difficult to navigate through, not 
too long (and with easy exit points), and not too deep. The idea is to wade 
down the middle of the stream slowly and methodically. Look for minnows, 
frogs, tadpoles, and crawfish. Use the aquarium net to scoop up animals and 
look at them in the dishes. Use your masks or place the dishes in the water 
for a glass-window view of the stream below the surface. Romp, play, and get 
dirty. Wallow in mud holes and explore every nook and cranny. If you come 
upon a still pool, have your children stand quietly, observing the world below 
them through masks or the glass dishes floating on the surface. If they’re able 
to stand quietly enough for longer than a minute, they’ll get a peek at another 
world swimming around their legs and feet.
Mucking around in a swamp
Swamp mucking is a variation on the stream walk (covered in the preceding 
section) with one major exception: You get really muddy. The idea is to actu-
ally crawl through the swamp, following open waterways and animal paths. 
Talk about immersing yourself in nature!
 
Use obvious caution before diving into a swamp that may be home to alliga-
tors, water moccasins, leeches, or snapping turtles.
Walking barefoot
Walking barefoot is a most natural and yet rarely enjoyed experience that 
encourages you to slow down, feel the ground underfoot, and relive an 
almost primal instinct. Be sure that the ground you’re going to walk over 
is relatively free from sharp rocks, thorns, and yes, even glass. Lead your 
youngsters through the woods single file. Teach them to walk as if they’re 
hunting by taking a very small and very careful step forward to the outside 
ball of their descending foot. Very slowly, and without putting any weight on 
it, roll the foot to the inside of the ball. If nothing that may break with a loud 
snap or pop is felt underfoot, carefully lower the heel and then put full weight 
on the foot. If your child becomes adept at this way of walking barefoot, he’ll 
be able to sneak up closely to birds and animals without spooking them.

Checking out tide pools
Tide-pooling, especially with a young child or an older adult who’s young at 
heart, is an absolute hoot. Poking and peering into pools searching for crabs, 
sea urchins, seashells, sea cucumbers, octopi, starfish, and the like can keep 
an explorer occupied and entertained for hours.
Buying and using binoculars
Binoculars are an important addition to any out-
door adventurer’s equipment list. They bring the 
distant world close enough to view, allowing 
you to visually leapfrog up a mountain, capture 
the intricate detail of a hawk’s feathers high 
overhead, or scan the surface of a lake — all 
without moving a step. Choosing the right bin-
oculars, however, can be confusing, especially 
because hundreds of models are available 
with prices ranging from $10 cereal-box sport 
glasses to $700 autofocus binoculars that use 
the latest in microchip technology.
Before you shop, do your homework and make 
a list of your needs. Are you going to use your 
binoculars primarily for viewing wildlife, sports, 
stars, or a combination of these subjects? Will 
you use them in normal lighting, in the shadows 
of late evening, or in the deep forest? Will they 
be routinely exposed to elements or relatively 
protected? Is durability a factor?
Then decide how much you’re willing to spend. 
If you’re only going to use the binoculars once 
or twice a year, you can probably get away with 
a lower-priced model. But don’t settle on the 
cheapest pair you can find. You may regret your 
choice later. Generally, the higher the price, the 
better the optical quality and the more durable 
the housing — to a point. Beyond $250 to $300, 
you probably won’t notice the difference.
Binoculars fill virtually any indoor and outdoor 
need imaginable, from opera to football to wilder-
ness exploration. However, no binoculars meet 
every need. The following is a recommended 
application for a select sampling of magnification 
powers:
  6 x 30: Stadium sports, indoor sports, the-
ater, bird-watching at a home feeder
  7 x 25: Stadium sports, hiking, bike touring, 
nature observation
  7 x 35: General purpose, stadium sports, 
bird-watching, boating, wildlife observation
  7 x 50: General purpose, bird-watching, 
boating, stargazing, hunting
  8 x 40: Wildlife observation, stargazing, 
long-distance bird-watching
After buying your binoculars, keep them in good 
condition by following these tips:
  Never touch binocular lenses with your 
fingers. Instead, remove grit and grime with 
a few puffs of a blower brush (found in most 
photo stores) and then brush away any 
remaining particles. Remove haze and fin-
gerprints by gently wiping with a lens tissue 
dampened with a drop of lens cleaner.
  Don’t leave your binoculars in the hot sun, 
the trunk of your car, or anywhere else 
where heat may warp the casing.
  Keep your binoculars stored in a padded 
nylon or leather case. Add a packet of silica 
gel to help absorb any moisture.
  Clean the exterior of your binoculars only 
with a lint-free cotton cloth or a silicon-
impregnated cloth that some manufactur-
ers supply with your purchase.

440
Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
 
To make the trip more enjoyable, bring an underwater viewing “eye.” You can 
easily make your own by cutting the end off an old #10 coffee can, covering it 
tightly with clear plastic wrap, and securing the wrap in place with a rubber 
band. When you get to a deep tide pool that you want to look into, just place 
the underwater viewing can in the water, plastic end down, and look through 
the can like a viewing window. You’ll be amazed by how clearly you can see.
 
Sometimes, you may want to turn over a rock or log to see what lives under 
it. Do so carefully and gently, taking care not to crush what lives underneath. 
Replace the rock, with equal care, when you’re finished looking.
 
Don’t collect anything from the beach that’s alive — in most cases, doing so 
is illegal. Besides, marine animals are much better cared for in a wild environ-
ment. As you wander, also remember that most beachfronts are considered 
public property right along the waterline, but after you head up the beach, 
above the high-tide limit, you enter a zone that may or may not be private. 
It’s your responsibility to know whether you’re treading on public or private 
beachfront property. If in doubt, ask at the public access point before ventur-
ing out. And one more thing: Never turn your back on the ocean — you risk 
getting drenched by a sneaky wave.
Gazing at the stars
The lights of a city mask the stars, leaving no chance to see the world beyond 
Earth unless you step away from the city and gaze skyward from a mountain-
top or an open field. For most city-trapped folk, seeing a million pinpricks of 
light twinkling against the inky-black backdrop of a night sky is a new experi-
ence. Stargazing takes practice and patience, but with a star wheel (available 
at most nature, outdoor specialty, or hobby stores) and a star guide, you’ll 
open up a new world for yourself and your family or friends.
The following are some favorite and easily found stars and constellations:
 
 North Star: The beauty of the North Star is that it stays in one place in the 
sky and always to the north of you. You can locate this star, also known 
as Polaris, if you can find the Big Dipper. To pick the North Star out of the 
mass of other twinkling stars, find the Big Dipper and then look to the two 
stars that make up the lip of the dipper’s ladle. The North Star lies above 
the two stars, known as pointer stars, in a relatively straight line, approxi-
mately four to six times the distance between the two stars.
 
 Cassiopeia: This star was named for the wife of King Cepheus, an 
Ethiopian king. According to mythology, she was turned into a constel-
lation as punishment for her vanity. Look for a five-star cluster shaped 
like a W or an M on the north/northeast horizon just before midnight in 
a summer sky.

 Ursa Major: You can find this constellation (also known as the Great 
Bear) near the Big Dipper, which actually makes up a part of the bear. 
The dipper makes up the bear’s back, with the handle standing in for the 
bear’s nose. Three pairs of stars make up the bear’s paws.
 
 Bootes: Also known as the Herdsman, this constellation resembles a 
large kite and is located below the Big Dipper. At the constellation’s 
base lies Arcturus, the fourth-brightest star in the sky (look for its dis-
tinct orange color).
 
 Leo: You can find the lion just below the bear’s paws between the Great 
Bear and the western horizon. The bluish-white star Regulus sits near 
the lion’s chest and behind its front leg.
The section “Star Maps” at the end of this chapter features a series of star 
maps you can use when stargazing.
Taking a sunrise hike
Getting up before the sun rises probably isn’t high on your agenda unless 
you’re a mountaineer seeking to reach a summit before the sun softens the 
snow. However, many campers miss out on a very special and spiritual time 
outdoors by experiencing sunrise only from the protected confines of a tent 
and sleeping bag.
Though the groans can be loud and clear when you wake folks an hour before 
dawn, the grins, oohs, and ahs following a sunrise breakfast experience are 
usually unanimous. Select a safe route up to a suitable lookout point that’s 
no more than a 30-minute hike from camp. Headlamps and flashlights are a 
must. After safely nestling into the lookout area, quiet the group and watch 
the thin sliver of light appear on the eastern horizon. Colors often dance in 
the sky as the sun pushes fingers of light through the velvet curtain of dawn 
before exploding onto the scene as a warm, golden orb.
After the initial show is over, it’s time to fire up a camp stove, whip up hot 
cocoa and coffee, and hand out bagels, cream cheese, dried fruit, or whatever 
your breakfast dreams desire — within reason of course. After you’ve experi-
enced one sunrise, you’ll want to see hundreds more.
Capturing Moments in Freeze Frame
A picture is worth a thousand words, provided the picture is a keeper. Many 
aren’t. You know the kind: snapshots that are too light, too dark, too far from 
the subject, or full of distracting stuff. The next few sections show you how to 
avoid the fate of such flawed photos when enjoying the outdoors with family 
and friends.

Book IV: Getting Outdoors 
Making shots worth showing
The following tips can help you ensure that your shots are worth showing to 
friends (see Photography For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Russell Hart [Wiley] 
for more tips on capturing the perfect image):
 
 Don’t center the subject. Centered subjects in a photo look stiff, posed, 
and downright amateur-ish. Place the subject of your photo off to one 
side and let the light or surrounding landscape add to the story you’re 
trying to tell.
 
 Use a sense of scale in your photos. A giant sequoia or a distant moun-
tain that looks huge to you appears as nothing more than a tiny image in 
print unless you place an object of known size in the picture to establish 
a relationship of scale. For example, try slipping a penny into the picture 
next to tiny flowers to show just how small they really are.
 
 Block the glare. A flare across your favorite shot can be prevented if 
you use a lens hood or cup your hand just above or to the side of the 
lens to block out stray light.
 
The essence of most amateur wildlife photography is defined by animal butts — 
way off in the distance. Anticipate the shot, move in front of the action, and then 
set up the photograph so your image fills as much of the frame as possible.
Keeping the camera handy
A camera doesn’t do you much good if you can’t get to it. Often a well-inten-
tioned photographer spends an entire day hiking without taking one shot 
because the camera sits safely secure inside a backpack. The key to taking 
photographs during the day is to make your camera accessible. SunDog, 
LowePro, Tamrac, and PhotoFlex are some of the better known manufactur-
ers of padded camera cases that can be carried as a chest pouch or attached 
to a waist belt. Some people prefer a chest pouch, although it does limit your 
“at the feet” visibility, which is a drawback if you’re negotiating difficult ter-
rain. Others prefer an ordinary fanny pack, which they spin around so the 
pack carries in front — a move that can make the pack a nuisance on steep 
climbs because it’s always in the way of your thighs and knees.

Raising Farm 
Animals

In this book . . .
I
f the only animals you’ve had in your life thus far are a 
dog, a cat, a caged parakeet, or a fish (or any combina-
tion thereof), you’re in for a real treat. Your version of liv-
ing a country lifestyle can include farm animals, too!
If you’ve already been thinking about expanding your 
menagerie and know just what you want, this book is just 
for you. It tells you how to go about picking, finding, and 
caring for your latest additions. If the idea has never 
crossed your mind and you don’t know where to begin, 
this book helps you decide which kind of farm animal is 
right for you. (And don’t count yourself out if you live in 
the city or on a relatively small piece of land. Not all farm 
animals take up a lot of space. Think bees!)

Chapter 1
Selecting Farm Animals
In This Chapter
 Catching up with your familiar four-legged or feathered friends
 Raising camelids for fiber- or pack-animal purposes
 Keeping fish, bees, or worms
 Making final decisions: Gender, quantity, and so on
You’ve probably already shared your home with a dog or cat or two. But 
living on a farm or in a home with a large tract of land opens up oppor-
tunities for sharing your life with other types of animals that you may not 
have dealt with in the past. A farm just isn’t a farm without some animals, 
and with all that acreage, it’d seem empty without hooves or at least some 
paws trotting around the grounds.
Although raising animals requires some work (a lot of it with some animals), 
work isn’t the only thing farm animals bring you. Animals can enrich your 
life — whether they’re pets, workhorses, or beings that give you something 
back (meat, eggs, fiber, and so on). With the proper care and attention to their 
needs and feelings, you and your animals can become a great team.
This chapter gives you plenty of critter options to consider, but by no means 
does it present an exhaustive list of what you can do on your farm. Take 
these ideas as a starting point and use your imagination to come up with 
something unique that works for you. Check with local 4-H groups, your vet-
erinarian, and local farms for ideas on the kinds of animals that thrive in your 
area, and get started.
Meeting the Common Farm Animals
Although the types of animals you can share your farm with are numerous, 
most people think of the ones in this section first. Indeed, these creatures are 
the usual suspects (but don’t let this list limit your imagination — check out 
the later sections in this chapter for some other ideas). For info on individual 
breeds of cattle, goats, horses, sheep, and the like, check out www.ansi.
okstate.edu/breeds.

454
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
You may want to start out with something that won’t take up a lot of your 
time and money while you decide whether you like raising animals. Here’s 
how costs compare:
 
 Animals requiring little initial output and maintenance are the smaller 
ones, such as fowl (chickens, ducks, geese, and turkeys), rabbits, goats, 
and sheep.
 
 Medium- to high-cost animals are the larger ones: camelids, cattle, 
and pigs. Some can have a pretty high initial cost. For example, female 
alpacas can cost as much as a quality horse, and a good cow can be 
more expensive than a poor horse. On the other hand, maintenance 
costs are relatively low.
 
 The highest-cost animals in terms of initial outlay and maintenance are 
horses. Even though you can get horses cheaply (see Book V, Chapter 2 for 
more on how to acquire your animals), they require a lot of maintenance.
Cattle
“Cattle” is a collective term referring to a group of cows, probably the 
number one creature people think of when they think of farm animals. (“Cow” 
technically refers to adult females, but calling the group of them cows is 
okay, even if calves and bulls are in the group as well.)
Cattle come in several varieties, each with its own characteristics, but gener-
ally they’re raised for meat, milk, or help with chores. And you can’t forget 
one more function of a cow or any other farm animal — simply having them 
around because you like them! Here are the major functions of cattle:
 
 Dairy cattle: Making the commitment to having dairy cattle means you 
have to be pretty much married to your farm (or at least you need work-
ers who are). Dairy cattle must be milked twice a day during the time 
they produce milk (usually for six to nine months after giving birth), 
either by hand or machine, or they go dry. The milk is then processed 
into milk, cheese, butter, or yogurt. Common breeds of dairy cattle 
include Ayrshire, Brown Swiss, Guernsey, Holstein, Jersey, and Milking 
Shorthorn.
 
 Beef cattle: These types of cows are chosen and raised to be slaugh-
tered. Unless you want to sell the tender meat of the calf (veal), it takes 
about two years before one of these guys is old enough and beefy 
enough to sell for food. Besides the meat you can get from your cattle, 
you also can tan the hide and use it for leather or suede clothing, fur-
nishings, or even art. Common breeds of beef cattle include Angus, 
Herford, and Kobe.

Book V
Raising

Animals
 
 Draft cattle: Although the draft jobs have gone mostly to horses or 
machinery in modern times, a small operation can still use these beasts 
to help with various farming chores, such as hauling or plowing.
Another option in the cattle category is to get a mini cow. The claim is that 
due to their smaller size (and thus less feed consumption and less space 
needed per animal), beef production per acre on a small farm can be greater 
with mini cows than with larger animals.
Horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules
Every little kid’s dream is to own a horse or a pony. Of course, kids know 
nothing about what’s involved in caring for them; they just love the idea of 
galloping through the countryside on their very own friend Flicka. For many 
people, that dream doesn’t die as they grow older. Horses, after all, can be 
a ton of fun. You can go backpacking with them, have them participate in 
rodeos or other shows, or simply entertain that childhood dream and go for 
a gallop through the countryside.
And don’t forget their donkey and mule cousins. Donkeys, although a little 
smaller and probably not great for carrying adults, can be hitched up to 
carts. Both donkeys and mules are fun for kids’ rides or for helping you 
around the farm.
Caring for horses is where the work part comes in, but if you love your ani-
mals, this work is a labor of love. Following are a few basics, and you can 
check out Horses For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Audrey Pavia and Janice 
Posnikoff (Wiley), for more detailed help in caring for your horse.
 
 Horses need attention — and a lot of it. They need shelter from the 
weather; nutrient-rich food; a constant supply of clean water; clean, 
mucked out stalls every day; daily grooming and exercise; and good 
bedding (standing on a hard surface all day isn’t good for them).
 
 Horses need quite a bit of room to thrive. Although horses have no set 
space requirements, you generally want at least 1 acre per horse.
 
 Horses are social animals that get bored, depressed, or surly if they 
don’t have regular contact with humans and other animals. If you keep 
them in a barn, someone needs to ride them daily.
Horses love treats, and bringing some into the pen or pasture means you’re 
about to get mobbed. But don’t worry — they’re not carnivores, so you’re safe!

456
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Swine
A pig farm isn’t something to go into lightly. Yes, you can get some very tasty 
meat from a pig, but the work required is probably more than is desirable for 
the scope of a small farm. Pork prices tend to be low (although prices vary 
widely, pork tends to be about 40 to 50 percent less per pound than, say, a 
nice steak), so small farms often have trouble recovering their investments. 
Following are some facts to consider about raising pigs:
 
 If you’re going for the meat angle, pigs generally need to be about 260 
pounds (that takes roughly six months) before they’re considered meaty 
enough to butcher. Translation: You’re going to have a lot of food to 
feed and a lot of waste to clean up after!
 
 You can find inexpensive sources of food for pigs by going to local res-
taurants or grocery stores and asking for their unusable food, such as 
the outer leaves of lettuce.
 
 Baby male pigs need to have their eyeteeth cut by a veterinarian so that 
they don’t chew each other up. Fighting is in pigs’ nature when they get 
to a certain age, and if left unchecked, the fights can be deadly.
 
 Pigs should be kept in a pen, and that pen must be cleaned out regularly. 
(Not doing so is what leads to the stereotype that pigs stink.) Pigs have 
a reputation for smelling bad, and many people find pig odor particu-
larly offensive. However, proper waste disposal and hygiene can keep 
odors down.
 
 If allowed to roam in a larger fenced-in area, pigs clear the land by root-
ing with their powerful snouts. They also scratch their backs on trees 
and destroy the bark.
Pigs can be fun pets if you want to keep them on a smaller scale (just one 
or two animals). Consider getting a Vietnamese Potbelly pig (visit www.
pigs4ever.com for more info about these guys). This breed is pretty 
clean (some people even keep them in the house), and individuals can have 
endearing personalities. A pot-bellied pig can seem like a dog sometimes as 
it follows you around and cuddles up to you, and it loves to be scratched 
behind the ears.
 
If you have guard dogs running around, make sure the pigpen is secure 
(meaning no dogs can slip under the fence) to keep both the dogs and the 
pigs safe from each other. Until you know how your particular animals will 
interact, don’t let them do so unsupervised.

457
 Chapter 1: Selecting Farm Animals
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
Sheep
Sheep are pretty easy to care for. Some people continually question their 
intelligence (mostly because of their strong herd mentality — where one 
goes, all others follow), but their reputation for feeble-mindedness isn’t 
entirely true. They can recognize you, and each one has a personality.
Your sheep can provide you with more than wool. For instance, you can make 
their milk into cheeses or yogurt, and sheep’s waste makes for good fertilizer 
that doesn’t smell badly the way cow manure does. Although most sheep 
breeds are multipurpose, some sheep are bred for specific qualities — meat, 
milk, or wool. For instance, Dorset sheep are good milk producers, Suffolks 
produce good meat, and Rambouillet sheep produce fine wool. Because liter-
ally hundreds of breeds exist, your best bet is to check into what’s appropri-
ate for and available in the area where you live.
The process of preparing sheep fibers for spinning is the same as for other 
fiber animals, but sheep fleeces tend to contain a lot of lanolin, which creates 
a greasier feel and makes them a little harder to clean. Different breeds have 
different characteristics (like the lanolin-less Icelandic or the Shetland, whose 
fleece is the finest of the sheep breeds), but all fiber sheep produce a warm 
wool that you can make into clothing or lots of other products. (Check out 
Book II, Chapter 1 for some ideas.)
Some factors to consider when looking at whether you want to raise sheep 
include the following:
 
 Sheep eat grass. If you live in an area where grass is plentiful, your job of 
feeding them is easy, and you don’t need a lawnmower; in a dry, desert 
area, you must supply all the feed.
 
 If you own a very large area and only a few animals, you may be able to 
get by with just turning your sheep loose in the pasture and letting them 
have at it. However, some pasture management is far preferable. Try 
rotating your pasture: Give the critters an area to graze on and block off 
another area to give the soil a break from their trampling and to plant a 
cover crop to put nutrients back into the soil.
 
 Grazing sheep can ruin your lawn if left unchecked, because they tend 
to chew it down to the ground. (This behavior was one of the main 
causes of the sheep-versus-cattle rancher wars in the early days of the 
American West.) Keep feed on hand to counteract this tendency.
 
 Sheep must be sheared once a year, usually in midspring. Not shearing 
them causes their wool to get long and matted, making it difficult for 
them to get around. Also, you can’t process matted wool at all.

458
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
 Although sheep roam freely across the countryside in some areas, it’s 
best to fence them in (away from coyotes and mountain lions, for exam-
ple) and put a guard animal in with them. Dogs are good for guarding 
sheep.
 
 In the United States, most of the meat that comes from sheep comes 
from the babies — the lambs — making this type of animal one of the 
hardest ones to let go. Lamb meat (from sheep less than a year old) is 
the most tender, but mutton (meat from an older sheep) can be tastier, 
albeit a bit tough. The sweetest lamb meat (as well as from any animal 
for that matter) comes from the day the lamb is weaned.
Goats
Goats are some of the most domesticated animals and have been raised for 
thousands of years for their meat, milk, and fiber. The babies also have pretty 
darn cute faces, making sending one to the butcher a not-so-easy decision.
Depending on the condition and age of the slaughtered goat, the meat (some-
times called chevon) is similar to lamb, veal, or venison but is lower in fat and 
cholesterol. Goat milk makes wonderful cheeses, yogurt, and even ice cream. 
The milk is lower in lactose than that of other animals, and people who are 
lactose intolerant can ingest it favorably.
Goats raised for their fiber have similar characteristics to meat goats in 
terms of their care and behavior, but their coats are vastly different. They’re 
soft and curly, and the fiber you can get from them is wonderful. The Angora, 
Cashmere, and a number of crosses are the most popular breeds that fit into 
this category. Despite what the Angora goat’s name implies, you don’t get 
angora fiber from it. Angora goats actually produce mohair, which ranges 
from very fine and soft to coarse and scratchy (angora comes from rabbits — 
see the next section). Goat fleeces have little oil in them, so they’re easy to 
clean in preparation for processing into yarn.
 
Cashmere is a relative term. Some say any fiber goat can produce this fiber 
and that cashmere refers to a characteristic of the fiber itself (it must be 
0.5 micrometers in diameter and be at least 3.175 centimeters long). Others 
say the goat that originated in the region of Kashmir is the only one whose 
fiber you can accurately call cashmere. People agree, however, that the fiber 
comes from the soft undercoat of the fiber goat. The fleece from the Kashmir-
turned-cashmere is also known as pashmina.

Following are some pointers on goat care:
 
 You have to treat fiber goats as fiber goats. That means not using them 
as pack goats or putting them on a leash and taking them for a walk. 
Packs and collars cause their prized fiber to mat, and matted fiber isn’t 
usable.
 
 Goats tend to be escape artists, so fences need to be strong and sturdy. 
Chicken wire and a couple of metal posts aren’t enough — you need 
something stronger, such as chain link or metal fence panels.
 
 Goats can eat almost anything because their digestive systems can 
break down and glean nutrients from nearly any organic material. 
However, although they may like to eat shirts off your clothesline, doing 
so doesn’t keep goats healthy. They also like to eat shrubs and weeds 
and can even digest some plants that are toxic to cattle and horses, 
making them great weed clearers.
Rabbits
You’ve probably heard the phrase “tastes like chicken” when someone is 
describing an unusual meat. Well, that description holds true for the meat 
of the rabbit, which is low in cholesterol. Rabbits, which eat grass and leafy 
weeds, are more productive and cheaper to feed than chickens. A rabbit can 
produce up to 1,000 percent of its body weight in food per year, which brings 
new meaning to the phrase “multiplying like a rabbit.” Additionally, you can 
skin and butcher about five rabbits in the same amount of time it’d take to do 
a chicken.
Rabbits also produce a fine, soft fiber. Rabbit fur is very soft, and people 
have used rabbit pelts for years as fur accents on coats or hats, among many 
other uses.
The fiber of the Angora rabbit can also be spun into a super-soft yarn known 
simply as angora. Rabbits such as the Angora shed their coats a few times a 
year. (Yes, that means you can get the fiber and still keep the critter.) Brush 
them regularly to keep their coats free of knots and add the stuff you brush 
off to your to-be-spun pile. For rabbits that don’t shed their coats, you can 
shear them or you can brush or hand-pull the loose fibers out. (You know 
it’s time to harvest the rabbit’s fur when you notice clumps of wool sticking 
to its cage.)

460
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Here are a few rabbit-related tidbits to consider:
 
 Rabbits don’t need much space to be happy, which is fortunate because 
they should be kept confined to reduce the threat of predators.
 
 Take care when building their enclosures to ensure their safety. Hutches 
should be well above the ground and out of the way of curious dogs and 
other smaller critters, like skunks.
 
 Because Angora hair is so long and soft, it has a tendency to mat and 
shed. (Remember, matted fiber is no good.) Not only does shedding 
mean you lose potential spinning fodder but it can also make a mess of 
the cage and cling to your clothes. Regular brushing is crucial.
Small and Medium Birds: Fancying Fine, 
Feathered Farm Friends
The most popular type of farm poultry is the chicken, but you may want to 
think about others such as turkeys, ducks, geese, quail, or peacocks — these 
birds also produce delicious meat or eggs and can be fun to have on your farm.
Chickens
The following sections focus on keeping chickens for eggs or meat. In meat 
birds, the meat builds up quickly, whereas egg-layers put their energy into 
egg production. A bird that performs dual duties is heavier than an egg-layer 
and produces fewer eggs than a standard layer, but it also produces more 
eggs than a meat bird.
 
Once a year, chickens molt (lose all their feathers), but don’t worry about 
seeing bald birds running around — the feathers are lost a few at a time. 
Chickens’ feathery coats take a couple of months to refurbish, but the birds 
don’t go bald while this is happening. They do, however, get rather ratty-
looking. Just take a deep breath and remember that seasonal molting is 
normal.
Keeping hens for eggs
Chickens kept primarily for laying eggs are called layers. The job of these 
birds is, of course, to lay eggs, and on average, they do that about once every 
25 hours — or a little less than once per day — optimally speaking. They pro-
duce fewer eggs if something stresses them, such as not being fed enough or 

461
 Chapter 1: Selecting Farm Animals
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
having a predator in the pen. Their bodies are smaller than the meat-
producing birds and thus require less feed because they don’t need to 
maintain muscle mass.
Some factors that affect their laying include
 
 Daylight: If the chicken house is set up with lighting and you give the 
birds 12 or more hours of daylight, you can keep the egg production up.
 
 Temperature: The optimal temperature for chickens is between 70 and 
75 degrees Fahrenheit. As the temperature rises, the eggs produced get 
smaller and have thinner shells.
 
 Chickens actually self-regulate their temperatures and can survive harsh 
conditions, such as winter temps that are below freezing and summer 
temps that can rise to triple digits.
 
 Molting: In the fall, most hens start molting and stop laying eggs for a 
while.
 
 Age: Laying hens start laying eggs at about 6 months of age. Their egg 
production peaks at about 2 years of age, after which they lay fewer but 
larger eggs. If they get old enough, they eventually stop laying. Note: 
When laying chickens get past their productive years, they’re often sold 
as stewing chickens. The meat is very tough, and stewing is the best way 
to make it edible.
 
Laying hens produce eggs regardless of whether a rooster is around, because 
egg production is part of the female chicken’s bodily functions. If eggs are 
your goal, you don’t need a rooster (except, of course, to give you that feeling 
of really being on a farm when the bird starts crowing in the wee hours of the 
morning). Some vegetarians are more interested in unfertilized eggs (those 
that are produced on rooster-free farms) because the eggs never have the 
potential of becoming a baby chicken.
Keeping chickens for meat
A chicken egg takes 21 days to hatch, and most meat chickens are bought 
as day-old chicks. Birds grow very fast, and the best meat is available when 
they’re still pretty young. The idea is to get a meat chicken big as fast as pos-
sible. After all, the longer you have to feed a chicken, the less money you 
make. Most meat chickens have a life span of 6 to 8 weeks; thus, they don’t 
produce eggs (which happens at about 6 months of age.)
 
Meat birds are bred to have large breasts, so if they live beyond 6 to 8 weeks, 
their bodies get too big, and they may start to break legs or have other prob-
lems. Meat birds shouldn’t be encouraged to roost, because jumping off of 
those roosts puts strain on their legs.

Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Turkeys
Turkeys, of course, are the most popular Thanksgiving meal. They need to be 
a bit older than chickens do at slaughter — hens (females) should be 14 to 16 
weeks old, and toms (males) should be 19 to 20 weeks old. Most commercial 
turkeys are bred to have a lot of meat on them, meaning they’re unable to fly. 
Consequently, you need to provide them with protection not only from the 
elements but also from predators, because they can’t fly up to the top of the 
barn if something gets too close.
Turkeys eat grain with a little higher protein content that what you’d give a 
chicken, and they have a life expectancy of about 10 years.
 
Did you know that turkey feathers are ground up and used commercially as 
filler for certain animal feeds? Also, studies on the fibers in yarn have shown 
that a little bit of the fiber from turkey feathers can make very good insula-
tion material.
Ducks and geese
Ducks are typically raised for their meat, eggs, and down. Their meat is often 
used in gourmet foods in pricey restaurants (foie gras is one example). Their 
eggs are larger and richer than those of chickens and thus are prized among 
chefs. Ducks are popular animals to have on the farm because they’re easy to 
care for (they’re happy with kitchen scraps), they eat bugs, and they’re just 
fun to watch. They can also act as alarms and fend off small predators.
Geese are hardy birds and aren’t as susceptible to diseases as some of their 
poultry cousins. They’re easy to care for because they’re foragers — by 
eating their favorite food, they help control your weeds (and clean up your 
grass clippings!). Also, their eggs are a delicacy, and their feathers (particu-
larly their down) make for soft and warm insulation material.
Game birds
Game birds come in several varieties, including peacocks, partridges, quail, 
pheasants, grouse, pigeons, doves, and guineas. Raising them on your farm 
can be lucrative if you find the right markets. Besides producing meat and 
eggs, they can also be used in hunting. People may use them for training 
hunting dogs or birds of prey in falconry. Or you can sell game birds to a 
commercial hunting operation. Such operations set the birds loose and 
charge hunters to come on their land and hunt them.

Llamas and Alpacas: Spinning 
Out Info on Camelids
Camelids are popular on farms these days. The more common camelids 
are the llama and the alpaca, but two more critters — the guanaco and the 
vicuña — also fit into this family, and a few of these not-so-common family 
members are popping up across the U.S.
Camelids are ruminants (cud-chewers) like cattle, but they have three stom-
ach compartments like their cousins the camels. They don’t have hooves 
but rather walk on two toes, making them kinder to the environment when 
backpacking. Just looking at these guys brings joy to your spirit. They’re like 
funny-looking horses with darling faces and curious personalities.
If you’re interested in breeding these critters, you obviously need both a 
male and a female (although you can always rent a male for a night out with 
your girl). Careful attention to the expectant mother’s health and welfare can 
result in a lucrative money-making opportunity: After a gestation period of 
about 111/2 months, you may be rewarded with a baby girl that can fetch you 
more than $15,000.
Most people raise alpacas and llamas for their fleece. The following sections 
note the differences between the two major camelids and zero in on manag-
ing their behavior.
Deciding between llamas and alpacas
Which camelid is right for you? Llamas and alpacas are both good for fiber, 
but if you’re after very high-quality fiber, go for the alpaca. If you want a dual-
duty animal — not only a fiber-producer but also a beast of burden that’s a lot 
of fun to hike with — go for the llama. Price may also come into play for you. 
Alpacas are more expensive than llamas, and females are more expensive than 
males. The next couple of sections describe both animal types in detail.
 
The various breeds of camelids are alike enough that they can interbreed. 
However, doing so is frowned upon, so discourage interbreeding by keeping 
any intact males away from females.

464
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Llamas
Llamas (see Figure 1-1) are the biggest of the camelids, and they can live as 
long as 29 years. They grow to about 4 feet high and up to 450 pounds, and 
they can carry approximately 80 pounds (or a little less or more, depending 
on the individual), so they’re not built to carry an adult. However, they don’t 
mind toting small children around.
As pack animals, llamas fare better than horses because
 
 They eat anything along the trail, so you don’t have to pack much in the 
way of food for them.
 
 They don’t spook as easily as horses.
 
 Their feet, being made of a soft material, are kinder to the environment.
 
 They can last for as many miles as you can.
 
Figure 1-1: 
A llama is a 
great pack 
animal.
 
Llamas are pretty easy to find inexpensively. (You may be able to find them 
at auctions for as little as $25.) The market for these guys just isn’t what it 
used to be. However, some llamas bred for specific traits (such as a finer-
quality fiber or very strong legs and backs) or those that are already trained 
(for carrying packs or following on a lead) can still bring in a decent price.
Llama fiber isn’t the softest around, so it’s not as desirable for knitwear 
that goes close to the skin. However, it’s very warm and is thus a great fiber 
for several other projects, such as outerwear (heavy coat-sweaters), horse 
blankets, rugs, or stuffings. You can also use it for felting (check out Book II, 
Chapter 1 for this technique) or blend it with other fibers.

Alpacas
Alpacas are the queens of the camelids. Their fiber is very soft (one of the 
world’s most luxurious in fact) and is sought after in the knitwear market for 
next-to-the-skin garments. It comes in many colors — from pure white to sev-
eral shades of browns, grays, and black — and is grease-less, making it nearly 
hypoallergenic and easy to clean and spin.
Alpacas have a life span of about 25 years. Their cute faces and small bodies 
(they stand about 3 feet tall and weigh from 100 to 200 pounds) make them 
endearing to young and old alike.
There are two types of alpaca, each with its own fiber characteristics:
 
 Huacaya: The more popular Huacaya (pronounced wah-kie-ya) pro-
duces a sheep’s wool-like fiber that’s dense and soft. The Huacaya 
alpaca looks like a smaller, fluffier llama (see Figure 1-2).
 
 Suri: The Suri, which comprises about 20 percent of the total alpaca 
population, produces a longer, silkier fiber. The Suri looks like it’s 
wearing dreadlocks (see Figure 1-3).
 
If you’re interested only in the fiber, you can get by with just males. Educate 
yourself on the properties to look for and be sure to find a reputable 
dealer. You can check out the dealer with the Alpaca Owners and Breeders 
Association (www.alpacainfo.com) before making an investment.

Although the alpaca industry has been around since the 1980s (when the 
enjoyable creatures were first imported from South America), alpacas are 
very expensive to acquire, so the market is still somewhat limited. How much 
dough do you need to get started in the alpaca business? Here’s an idea:
 
 High-quality, proven females — meaning those that have given birth 
successfully — can go for as much as $30,000 dollars.
 
 Unproven females, including new crias (babies), can cost as little as 
$10,000 because there’s no guarantee they’ll be able to get pregnant or 
take the pregnancy to full term. You pay less and take the chance.
 
 Breeding-quality males go for $2,500 and up.
 
 Fiber-quality males (but nonbreeders) typically go for $500 to $1,500.
Working around camelid temperament
A common misconception about camelids is that they spit at people. In real-
ity, camelids spit at other camelids. (If you’re caught in the crossfire, how-
ever, prepare to be hit.) Only a few reasons can make you the actual target:
 
 If you’re trying to halter a particularly uncooperative llama, you’ll likely 
get hit with spit.
 
 If you’re shearing a camelid that hasn’t been sufficiently halter-trained, it 
may show its displeasure of the process by nailing you.
 
 If you become an implied threat to a new cria (baby), Momma Camelid 
may put you back in your place with a well-aimed glob of goo.

467
 Chapter 1: Selecting Farm Animals
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
You can check out a few other camelid behavior issues in the following sections.
Making friends
Camelids are herd animals, so having only one isn’t a good idea because 
camelids get lonely. Also, unless someone works with them from their birth 
(through cuddling, petting, brushing, and so on), they won’t be as cuddly as 
they look. You may be tempted to pet them or even hug their necks. They 
hate that! “Just feed me and dispense with the touching” is a normal attitude.
 
Be careful when training a newborn. If you teach it that people are just big 
camelids and there’s no need to run away, you’ll end up with behavior prob-
lems down the road. With too much human interaction, males start to think 
that you’re really just a big llama or alpaca. That’s bad when they get old 
enough to breed because they may see you as competition and pick a fight 
with you if you get too close to their females.
Camelids (specifically llamas) need to be trained for serving as pack animals 
because their normal instinct is not to let you touch them. Several good 
books and workshops are available to help you in that arena, such as TTEAM 
(Tellington Touch Every Animal Method; www.camelidynamics.com). The 
training takes a little time and love, but the results are very rewarding.
Dealing with fights
Intact (unneutered) males fight. This fighting isn’t a constant occurrence, 
but it’s an inevitable one nonetheless. The males make loud screechy noises, 
which can be disconcerting, especially to your neighbors. But the sound is 
normal, and you can’t stop it short of separating them — which is a bad idea 
because they’ll get lonely. (Think of it as an “I hate you sometimes, but I still 
want you near” sort of relationship.) You may notice that very shortly after 
the fight, the males bed down next to each other or eat side by side from the 
food trough.
 
A rogue intact animal faced with females in the next pen may not settle down 
and may continue to attack the other males in its enclosure. Castration is your 
best bet for dealing with this aberration of the camelids’ getting-along rule.
Raising Creatures that Buzz, 
Swim, and Squirm
Not all farm animals are cuddly, nor do they all have feet! A few more ideas 
for your menagerie come in the form of some not-so-cute (yet still functional!) 
critters. The ones featured in the following sections all give back to their 

468
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
environment. They work wonderfully in conjunction with other animals and 
crops and thus make great supplements or side businesses if you’re already 
raising cows or goats or whatever.
 
Integrated agriculture is a concept in which each piece in an operation coop-
erates somehow with the other pieces. The result is a waste-free system — 
everything is reduced, reused, and recycled. On a small scale, you can use 
worms and fish to prepare manure for use on plants.
Getting the buzz on honeybees
Bees on a farm are generally bigger than those found in nature. Unlike other 
animals you raise for food, honeybees don’t have to give up their lives in 
order for you to reap their benefits. Honeybees are pretty much the only 
insects that produce food for humans, and they play a major role in pollinat-
ing plants. In addition, an average hive yields about 4 gallons of honey (after 
you leave some for the bees). Note: Your results may be a lot more or less, 
depending on your particular conditions. Here are some other considerations:
 
 You must manage the hive, or the bees will die, and even careful man-
agement isn’t a guarantee of success.
 
 A bee’s life span is about 2 to 3 years, but that number can be cut way 
short for several reasons, like disease and changes in temperature.
 
 A beekeeper is required by law to use standard equipment consisting of 
removable frames so that diseased bees can be easily taken out of the hive.
For lots more info about beekeeping, head to Book V, Chapter 5.
Testing the waters with fish
Fish can be fun to raise because they’re rather easy to care for, but what types 
to raise and even whether you can raise fish depend on your state’s laws. The 
most common types of farm-raised fish are catfish, followed by trout.
If the fish are for your own enjoyment, you have little to do in the way of 
caring for them. For instance, if you have a natural pond on your property, 
you don’t have to do much besides catch the fish. With man-made ponds, you 
need to take care of feeding the fish and keeping their homes free of pests.

469
 Chapter 1: Selecting Farm Animals
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
If you’re raising fish for food, you have more health-related issues to con-
sider, such as being careful about the herbicides you use for controlling 
aquatic plants and keeping the fish disease-free. Fish raised in captivity have 
some problems their wild counterparts do not. First of all, their diet is differ-
ent, so they can have a different taste or color. They also have less room to 
swim and can be prone to diseases, so you have to consider using antibiotics.
Breaking ground with earthworms
Worms may be the easiest to care for of any animal on your farm. All you 
need to do is provide a place for them to proliferate and prosper (perhaps 
a pile of the organic matter that comes out of your other critters) and keep 
them moist. They turn that organic matter into worm castings, some of the 
best stuff you can use to add nutrients to the soil in your garden. If you live 
near a good fishing locale, build your kid a roadside stand and sell some of 
the worms to local fishermen.
 
Don’t throw worms into your compost pile, despite their digestive magic. A 
properly maintained compost pile reaches temperatures of 140 degrees, and 
subjecting worms to that heat means fried worms.
Provide your worms with their own enclosure. A simple box will do, but make 
sure you add air vents. Add a bit of shredded newspaper for bedding, toss 
in some dirt, and add organic matter or table scraps. Put the worms on top 
of the pile and let them worm their way into the mix. Add more food scraps 
periodically so the worms always have plenty of nourishment for their own 
bodies and thus more stuff to make their castings out of.
Clarifying What You Want
After you have an idea which type of animal you want, ask yourself just what 
you want this animal to do on your farm. Are you interested in just a few 
companion animals? Do you want to provide meat for your family? Do you 
want to raise and sell or show animals? Or are you a fiber person who wants 
to spin yarn and knit something up from materials that came from your own 
animals?

470
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
The next step is to weigh your options. For instance, say you’re interested in 
raising animals for their fiber. Here are a few to consider:
 
 Shetland sheep: These critters are small and easy to handle and have a 
fine fiber.
 
 Angora goats: Goat fiber is a step up from sheep’s (though goats are a 
little harder to raise).
 
 Suri alpacas: Alpaca fiber is a step up from goat’s; however, the alpaca 
is way more expensive to acquire and feed.
If you’re after good-quality fiber, you may not care if an individual animal isn’t 
particularly friendly to you or if its legs are less than show quality. However, 
if you want the animal to show, then every aspect of it has to be perfect.
Some other issues that matter when you’re looking for animals are age, 
gender, pregnancy possibilities, and what kind of shape they’re in. The next 
few sections highlight how these factors fit into your animal-buying decision.
 
Make sure you have an idea of what you’re getting into before embarking 
on any animal-buying venture. Some animals require a great deal of atten-
tion (horses are one), and some require extra-sturdy facilities (rabbits need 
protected from predators). Some need special care (for instance, fiber goats 
must be shorn twice a year). Do some research — peruse the Web, ask your 
neighbors, or chat with someone at the cooperative extension office to get 
ideas on what you can do. Find out the animal’s food and shelter needs, 
expected life span, adult size, common problems, and so on.
Choosing a breed
Before you plunk down the money or the time investment in an animal, 
research the breeds and their common qualities. For instance, if you’re inter-
ested in dairy cows, the Ayrshire is known for its easy births, strong calves, 
and longevity. The Jersey cow is a little smaller breed known for its high milk-
fat content and its good-tempered disposition.
After deciding on a breed, educate yourself. Look up an association (you 
can find tons, such as the Alpaca Owners and Breeders Association, the 
Quarterhorse Association, and so on) and see what the official breed stan-
dards are and what to expect from a certain breed. If you’re looking to show 
and breed an animal, then you need to invest in the highest-quality animal 
you can afford. You may not be able to resell a lower-quality animal.

471

Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
Considering age
The age of an animal always matters. You may want to get an adult so you 
can see what the critter has grown into, or you may want to get a baby so 
you have a better chance of molding it behaviorally into what you want for 
your farm. Either way, you need to consider these facts:
 
 An older animal can have problems that may or may not be fixable. 
Some nutritional problems can be fixed, but that depends on how far 
along they are. For instance, severe malnutrition can reach a point where 
the animal can’t recover. White muscle disease can be fatal in sheep and 
goats, but even if it isn’t, these animals still have a permanent weakness. 
(See Book V, Chapter 4 for the scoop on white muscle disease.)
 
 Babies can have special problems. If they’re taken from their mothers 
too soon, babies can have nutritional or behavioral problems; they may 
imprint on you — meaning they see you as a parent — and not know 
how to act as animals when it comes to breeding and the like. (See Book 
V, Chapter 3 for more info on behavioral considerations.) Most repu-
table breeders don’t sell a baby until it’s weaned, but you may have 
occasional opportunities to raise a really young animal if it’s orphaned 
or rejected by its mother. An exception may be baby goats, which are 
purposely bottle-fed so they’ll make friendlier pets.
 
Buying a trained critter may save you loads of time and headaches and be 
a better bargain in the long run. If you’ve never owned a horse before, you 
may be tempted to acquire a young, untrained animal that has a reasonably 
low price tag. (Hey, training the horse yourself is part of the experience, no?) 
However, training an animal is something you need to be trained on, so you 
may have to hire someone else to train the animal and show you what to do. 
A beginning rider and an improperly trained horse are a dangerous combina-
tion. Sometimes an older animal is better.
Looking at gender and fertility
Keeping males, females, or both means a few differences in care. For 
instance, males tend to fight, especially if they’re reproductively intact. If you 
don’t care about breeding, have the males fixed. They’ll be calmer, and in the 
case of fiber animals, you’ll get better fleeces. (Stress affects the quality of 
fleeces — if the males are always fighting, you may see a loss of fiber quality.) 
And naturally, male birds can’t lay eggs.

472
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Females, of course, can get pregnant, which requires extra care during birth 
(even if that means being in the barn at 3 a.m.; see Book V, Chapter 4 for 
more details on medical care for animals). Females may also be smaller, have 
a different quality of feathers or fleece, or have behavioral differences.
If you want to breed your animals, you can keep both males and females (in 
separate pens so you can control who gets to date whom), or you can hire 
out your males for studs or take your girls to the neighbors’ for a night on 
the town.
Sometimes you can buy a pregnant animal and end up with a two-for-one 
deal. Although this prospect may sound great, make sure you’re prepared to 
deal with complications that can come with pregnancy (and the possibility 
that you may lose both mother and baby). Also, make sure you’re willing to 
do the extra work that goes along with having newborns.
Determining how many you desire
The number of animals you should get depends on how much land you have 
and how much labor you can devote to care. Whatever you decide, ask the 
person you’re getting an animal from, or somebody who has animals, about 
how many critters he or she recommends in your situation.
 
Some animals are herd animals and should never be isolated. Owning at least 
two animals is always a good idea so they can keep each other company. But 
that doesn’t always mean two of the same breed — you can start out with 
one cow in the same pen with a few sheep, for example.

available for consultation after the sale, in case you run into something you 
don’t know how to handle. If you already have some experience with a par-
ticular type of animal, you may simply be looking to make a quick and 
economical transaction, with no support necessary.
Some animals are very easy and affordable to acquire. Others are much more 
expensive and take some legwork and education in order to know just what 
you’re getting into. In this chapter, you find advice on evaluating animals and 
breeders and finding the right seller for you.
Factoring in Time and Distance
Perhaps you’ve decided to acquire a cow for your farm. Before you grab 
your credit card and rush out to the 24-hour cattle store, take some time to 
consider whether now is really the best time to get that cow — or horse, or 
chicken, or whatever animal you have a hankering for.
When and where you get your new animal family members are important 
factors to consider first.

Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Knowing when to buy
Sometimes, timing your acquisitions just right can save you a lot of money 
or trouble (or both). The time of year can make a difference in the amount of 
work you’ll have to do, as well as in the odds that you’ll raise your animals 
successfully.
A very young animal taken on in the middle of the winter or a baby without 
its mother is tougher to raise. You have to make sure these animals are kept 
warm, both day and night.
Summertime can be bad in some parts of the country, too. If temperatures 
get really high, you need to be able to provide shelter so the animal can get 
out of the scorching sun. A nice, big tree can help provide shade.
 
During going-out-of-business and moving sales, you may be able to get some 
good-quality animals for a relatively low cost, but be careful. Many breeders 
use going-out-of-business sales as an excuse to dump their poor-quality or 
nonproducing animals on the unsuspecting public. Don’t buy anything with-
out doing some research first.
 
You can often get good prices on chicks and ducks right after Easter. Check 
shelters, country stores, or even pet shops. People get them for their season-
ally inspired cuteness and then realize the cuteness is going to wear off.
The forces of nature can also play a role in timing. For example, in one case, 
extensive brush fires led to a hay shortage, which led to a dramatic increase 
in the price of hay. Farmers who were unable to afford the high prices were 
forced to sell off some of their stock at rock-bottom prices. Watch for oppor-
tunities like these, and you may be able to get a little (or a lot) more animal 
for your money than you would otherwise. (Just make sure you can afford to 
feed your new critters!)
Going local or out of state
Whereas 20 years ago getting an animal from another state or even country 
was only for the rich and famous, now the average person can arrange the 
sale and transport of anything from parakeets to prize racehorses. Going 
the distance can be worthwhile if you find something that isn’t easily attain-
able locally, but getting something a little closer to home is almost always a 
better idea.
One advantage to purchasing closer to home is that it means the animal is 
accustomed to the climate you live in. Another plus is that you don’t have to 
deal with the logistics of transportation.

Animals
If you find something in a different state — or even in a faraway part of your 
own state — you have to come up with a way to get the animal from there to 
you. Larger animals are typically shipped in trailers, but smaller ones, like 
dogs, can go by air.
 
Before you put down the big bucks for an out-of-state animal, be sure to 
check with your state to see whether you have to adhere to any regulations 
in order for the critter to come into the state. Some states have laws about 
transporting animals across their borders. In that case, be sure you negoti-
ate with the current owner to decide who’s going to take care of any neces-
sary shots and exams and make sure you factor that into the total cost of the 
animal. You may also have to deal with a quarantine, a requirement that cer-
tain animals stay in a state shelter for a specified time before being allowed 
out into the general population.
Evaluating Sellers and Animals
Most animal sales go off without a hitch, but some less-than-honest people are 
out there. Unless you dream of playing plaintiff on a daytime TV court show, be 
savvy about the buying process so you don’t end up buying a dud — or fail to 
get anything at all.
Looking for credible sellers
 
Watch out for scams, whether perpetrated by individuals or auctioneers. If 
you’re dealing with a private party (as opposed to a business), getting into 
trouble may be a little easier because the seller can disappear after the sale 
and leave you with no support.
Online transactions can also be risky because you may not actually meet the 
seller. In such a case, you wind up doing your business over the phone and 
having your purchase shipped to you. Because a not-so-honest person can 
hide behind anonymity, you can find plenty of horror stories of online trans-
actions gone bad. Always, always be careful!
 
To make a long-distance transaction as safely as possible, heed the following 
advice:
 
 Check references. A good way to get information on distant sellers and 
animals is to check for references with other buyers or with an animal 
association. Another place to check is with the Better Business Bureau.
 
 Browse online rating systems. Some online sites have a rating system 
where buyers and sellers rate their transactions. A seller with close to 
100-percent positive feedback is likely to be good to you as well.

476
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
 Investigate whether the seller has a Web site. Most scammers don’t 
spend the money for a Web site.
 
 Keep your credit card in check. You may want to withhold credit card 
information until you’re sure the deal is legitimate.
Judging individual animals
Judging individual animals comes down to doing research beforehand so 
you have an idea of what to look for. Consider trying one or more of these 
research tactics:
 
 Attend an animal show. You can find local shows for all sorts of animals, 
including dogs, horses, llamas, and alpacas.
 
 Surf the Internet. Gobs of information are available online.
 
 Read farming magazines. Numerous magazines targeted to the farmer 
may help you recognize what constitutes a quality animal.
 
 Get help from those in the know. Friends, neighbors, and even the local 
vet are good people to ask for help with deciding on an animal. Maybe 
your neighbor has a particularly good animal that has siblings just wait-
ing for you to take home. Ask the local vet about a particular animal or 
seller to see whether he or she has an opinion.
When you’re considering the purchase of a specific animal, arrange an 
actual meeting if possible. Doing so allows you to see for yourself how the 
animal looks and acts. Especially with big-ticket animals (those you’ll be 
spending several thousands of dollars for), you may want to make multiple 
visits to the farm where the animal currently lives to see how the critter 
and all its buddies are doing. Watch to see how they interact with each 
other and with humans.
 
Sometimes, as in the case of an auction, you have only a short time to evaluate 
the animal, so make the most of it. Go with your gut. Occasionally, an animal 
just speaks to you — you see something in the animal that makes the decision 
for you.
If you have to evaluate an animal long-distance, your task is more challeng-
ing, but you can take some steps to protect yourself. Get online and take 
a look at the available animals. Call and talk to the seller and have him or 
her send more photos — pictures from the front, back, and side, as well as 
close-ups of the teeth and legs. Videos are nice, too. However, remember that 
pictures aren’t foolproof — dishonest sellers can send you pictures of a dif-
ferent animal or touch up the photos. If the seller shows the animals and has 
awards, then chances are you’re purchasing a decent animal.

477
 Chapter 2: Acquiring Animals
Book V

Farm 
Animals
 
Ask for papers that show the animal’s family history. In some cases, family 
history can tell you whether the parents or grandparents are known for pro-
ducing good-quality offspring. Jot down their names and look them up online.
Finding the Best Source of Animals
You can find farm animals for purchase through a variety of sources: breed 
associations, classified ads, even friends and family. This section introduces 
these and other places you can look to find animals.
 
Before you start searching for an animal to bring into your family, be sure 
you’re ready for the critter to join you. If you start looking and find the per-
fect deal on the perfect animal but you don’t have a fence or shelter, you’ll 
be frantic trying to get the place in order and still get in on the deal. If you 
already have some animals and are bringing a new one into the fold, have a 
holding pen ready to put the new one in while everybody gets used to the 
changes.
Consulting your friends and neighbors
What better place to get an animal than from a neighbor? You may know the 
animal personally, or at least you know how the owners treat their animals. 
Besides, your neighbor is just across the fence if you have a question that 
comes up.
If your friends and neighbors don’t have animals to sell, they’re likely to be 
able to connect you with trustworthy sources.
Seeking out reputable breeders
Some people find their purpose in life is to breed animals and sell them to 
discriminating buyers. Reputable animal breeders know everything there is 
to know about the breeds they raise and are very discriminating about which 
animals they allow to mate. The resulting offspring thus have characteristics 
that should be allowed to proliferate. You can find breeders
 
 Through lists in your local chapters of animal organizations (such as the 
Alpaca Owners and Breeders Association)
 
 By word of mouth
 
 Via an Internet search

478
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Even those breeders in far corners of the country can be well-known as 
good, conscientious breeders whom anyone, anywhere can buy from with 
confidence.
 
Some uneducated breeders think their poor-quality animals are the best and 
try to sell them as such. So educate yourself before buying. If you want a 
second opinion, ask the vet or other breeders what they think of a particular 
breeder. Request papers and references, and check out the breeder before 
you buy.
Finding animals in the classifieds
Classifieds — in a newspaper, on a Web site, or even just in a note tacked to 
the board at the local grocery or farm store — are ways to get the word out 
that an animal is in need of a new home. Hence, they’re good spots for you to 
look when you’re in the market for an animal. Peruse these places:
 
 Neighborhood bulletin boards: Some feed and tack stores (and even 
grocery stores in rural communities) have good old-fashioned cork-
boards right inside their doors where you can post a note with a push 
pin. These are good places to find some great treasures.
 
 Your local newspaper: Check the classifieds in the local paper. Most 
newspapers have a section for pets and/or livestock. One benefit of 
going this route is that the sale is personal. You can meet the animal and 
the current owners before the sale, and you may be able to call on those 
owners if you have questions after the purchase. Another benefit is that 
the sale is local — the animal usually doesn’t have to be transported 
very long distances or across state lines.
 
 Online classifieds: Lots of Web sites have want-ad sections where you 
can get all sorts of things, even animals. These days, even your local 
newspaper likely has an online counterpart where you can peruse the 
classifieds online. For starters, check out the following:
 
• AgriSeek: www.agriseek.com is a national site geared toward 
livestock, tools, farm services, and other agricultural categories.
 
• craigslist: www.craigslist.org is a national site with local sub-
sites that sometimes offer animals for adoption.
Visiting county and state fairs
County and state fairs are good places to find animals. During the show, the 
animals are available for viewing or meeting. These animals have been well 
taken care of and are highly trained. The cattle and pigs are sold to slaughter, 
but you can join in the bidding to get a great pet. You can also find ducks, 

479
 Chapter 2: Acquiring Animals
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
chickens, rabbits, goats, and sheep. Farmers come to fairs from all over, so 
fairs can be a really great place to buy your animals if you don’t mind com-
peting with other buyers.
Adopting from a rescue group
Sometimes animals end up in a rescue shelter for one reason or another. 
Perhaps the previous owners got in over their heads and realized they just 
couldn’t manage caring for the critters. Or perhaps the animals became dis-
placed due to a death in the owner’s family.
Checking with an animal rescue group can turn out to be a great idea, espe-
cially if you’re looking for a companion animal. You can find some gems at a 
low cost. However, some rescued animals may have health problems or spe-
cial training needs, so make sure you know what you’re getting into.
Bidding on animals at auctions
Rural areas sometimes hold regular animal auctions, which are quick and 
easy ways for people to get rid of animals that are unwanted for whatever 
reason. Maybe they have too many, they don’t want to raise a certain type of 
animal anymore, or they’re getting out of the farm business altogether. Here 
are some tips for buying at an auction:
 
 Get there early and take a look at what’s on the table that week. It 
always helps to go look with somebody who knows more than you. 
Perhaps a neighbor who has been through the auctions (maybe on 
both sides of the sale) can give you pointers on what constitutes a good 
animal and a good price.
 
 Talk to people while you’re there. You can sometimes pick up some tid-
bits just by chatting with fellow auction-goers. A casual remark by, say, 
one of the assistants at the auction can give you some amazing insight. 
You may discover the history of an animal, what others think is a fair 
price, or even a secret fact about an animal’s health.
 
 Know what you want to spend and stick to that limit. Getting caught 
up in the bidding is far too easy, so keep a level head. Yes, this may be 
an awesome animal, but animals come and go in auctions every week. Of 
course, there are always exceptions. If you know an animal’s history and 
you really want that one, maybe you’re prepared to go a bit higher than 
what you think is a decent price. Splurging is okay, but don’t let this atti-
tude be the norm.
 
 Dress for the occasion. Attending an auction means you may be out in 
the elements for a few hours, so you’ll be walking around an area that’s 
not conducive to wearing nice shoes or pants.

480
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
Animals put up for auction vary in terms of quality, so find out about certain 
breeds before you go. Have an idea of what to look for in the animal. Go a 
few times before you do any bidding so you can get a feel for what happens 
at an animal auction — what other people bid on, how much the animals go 
for, and so on. You may want to visit the auction several times to see how it 
works before participating.
 
If you go to an animal auction, beware of two things:
 
 Often, animals that go to auction are of poor quality, have injuries, or 
are unhealthy. Some big breeding farms may be getting out of the busi-
ness or reducing their stock, but often they’re simply getting rid of the 
animals they can’t sell. For example, some breeding farms buy mares, 
breed them to their stallions, and then have a going-out-of-business or 
reducing-my-herd auction, when in reality the animals they’re selling 
were never a part of their normal breeding program in the first place. 
Buyer beware!
 
 Some auctions have some not-so-honest auctioneers. If the auctioneer 
sees that you’re not a regular (a greenhorn who may not know the busi-
ness of auctions), he may invent an opponent to get you to keep bidding 
and bringing the price up. You may, in fact, be the only person bidding 
on a particular animal, but he nods to a nonexistent bidder behind you 
(whom you can’t see) to make you think you’re not alone in the bidding. 
It may be a good idea to have a friend or two stand behind the crowd to 
make sure you don’t fall for this trick.

W
hen you have critters, you’re responsible for their care. Throwing a 
bale of hay into the pen just isn’t enough. Like humans, animals need 
daily nourishment and protection from the elements, at least to some degree. 
To give your animals the best chance of having happy, healthy lives, you 
need to provide them with good nutrition, sufficient exercise, dry bedding, 
good air circulation, and safety from predators. You can avert a lot of health 
problems by paying attention to basic hygiene and care. This chapter covers 
animals’ basic needs and addresses a few of their behavioral issues.
Taking Care of Basic Hygiene
The maxim “Cleanliness is next to godliness” applies to animals as well as 
to humans. Keeping your animals clean is the best way to ward off diseases. 
In the following sections, you find out how to keep your critters in good, 
clean shape.
 
Keep records of actions that don’t take place every day and note when they 
happen — especially those that occur annually, such as shearing — so you 
know when the next treatment should be. As you take care of daily hygiene, 
use the contact to make sure everything is okay and to bond with your animals 
so you become familiar with their individual personalities. More thorough

monthly checks are a good idea because animals can hide their illnesses, and 
changes in their conditions can be subtle. Book V, Chapter 4 presents some 
standard signs of illness or injury, as well as possible treatments.
Because animals need to be restrained or corralled at times, such as when 
they need grooming or shots, you should find out how to properly restrain 
them. Doing so makes some of the daily tasks involved in their care a lot 
more enjoyable for both of you. See “Training animals for human interaction,” 
at the end of this chapter, for details.
Cleaning house: Maintaining 
the living area
One basic way to keep animals happy and healthy is to give them a nice place 
to stay. Here are three cardinal rules for keeping your animals’ shelter in 
good condition:
 
 Keep it fresh and dry. Change the bedding regularly and make sure 
the pen has ample drainage — no big puddles or large piles of doo-doo 
allowed. Not only is wet and soiled bedding uncomfortable to lie down 
in but it’s also a health hazard. It promotes bacterial growth both in the 
bedding and on the animal, which can lead to infections.
 
 Dispose of manure and soiled bedding in a conscientious way. When 
mucking out a stall (yep, that’s the official term, and you only have to 
clean out a stall once to know why it’s called this), you can add the 
soiled bedding to your compost pile. If your animals are producing way 
more manure than you can reuse yourself (for composting or for direct 
application), put a sign out advertising that you have some for free or 
for sale, or donate the extra to organizations such as local parks or land-
scaping companies.
 
 Keep it well-ventilated. In the summer, you don’t want hot, stuffy air 
to build up inside and make the animals uncomfortable. In the winter, 
humidity from urine, manure, and body moisture can accumulate and 
lead to respiratory infections, including pneumonia. Being continually 
subjected to the smell from ammonia in urine is bad for the immune 
system, especially for pigs. Thus, pigpens are typically equipped with 
fans to regulate air turnover.
 
 Keep it warm. During the winter months, you need to provide extra straw.

The beastly barber shop: 
Bathing and grooming
Most farm animals don’t get actual baths, but you may notice that they fre-
quently take dirt baths. They roll in the dirt to fend off bugs, placing a dirt 
barrier on the skin. Rolling around also serves as a great back scratcher. 
However, you don’t need to squirt critters with a hose unless they get really 
icky and dirty or you’re getting them ready for a show.
Grooming and shearing are sufficient means of keeping your animals’ coats 
beautiful and keeping the animals comfortable and smelling their best. Hair, 
hooves, and nails also require attention.
Brushing and cleaning coats
Grooming isn’t just done to make animals look pretty. Grooming makes crit-
ters more comfortable by freeing their coats of caked-on mud and feces, 
mats, stickers, and burrs.
Part of the daily care for some animals, especially horses, involves brushing 
the coat. For others, such as cows, proper bedding is enough to keep them 
clean. Whatever the grooming method, a clean animal is a happy and healthy 
animal.
Shearing hair
Shearing, which takes place in late spring or early summer, allows a good, 
clean, unmatted coat to grow in. It keeps the animal comfortable through the 
hottest part of the year; by the time winter hits, the coat is long enough to 
keep the animal warm again.
Fiber animals, such as sheep, Angora goats, and llamas, require shearing 
once or twice a year. You may also want to consider shearing other long-
haired animals as needed to help them feel more comfortable, even if their 
hair isn’t usable for yarn or fiber. See Book II, Chapter 1 for information on 
shearing your animals.
Trimming toes and checking hooves
Animals that roam on soft ground — grass or mud — need extra work on 
their feet. Nails and hooves grow just like human fingernails and need to be 
trimmed periodically. Hooves and pads can also collect debris and need to 
be cleaned out.

484
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
Failure to care for hooves can lead to serious problems and can even render 
an animal lame.
Animals whose pastures contain a lot of rocks have a better opportunity for 
their nails and hooves to wear down naturally — the rocks act as natural 
files — so in those cases, you may not have to trim their hooves at all, or at 
least not very frequently. However, if the animals live or frequently stand on 
very rocky ground or pavement, their hooves can chip and crack. Animals 
need their hooves to walk, so hoof crack needs immediate attention from a 
veterinarian or a farrier.
Having your animal shod
Horse hooves are made of keratin (the same substance that hair and finger-
nails are made of), which is a relatively soft material. Improper hoof care can 
lead to infection and lameness, so find a reputable farrier in your area to take 
care of the shoeing and trimming.
 
Heavy loads on hard surfaces are a recipe for hoof problems, so if you’re 
going to have your horse carry heavy loads (like a full-grown man) or plan 
to have the critter spend a lot of time on hard surfaces, you need to have it 
shod. Oxen that you use to pull heavy loads may also benefit from shoes.
However, not all horses need shoes. With proper hoof trimming, horses 
that don’t carry loads or walk on hard surfaces usually do okay without 
shoes. For information about natural hoof trims, ask your farrier about the 
barefoot method.
Feeding Your Animals Right
You can’t typically find food for your animals in the grocery store (although 
the pet aisle may have some products, such as Purina Rabbit Chow). Your 
best bet is to seek out a farm or country store. Local independents and 
national chains — such as IFA (Intermountain Farmers Association) Country 
Stores, Mills Fleet Farm, Tractor Supply Company, Blain’s Farm & Fleet, and 
others — can undoubtedly help you with a good part of the supplies you 
need, especially bagged feed, supplements, and salt licks. Or you can find 
some supplies on the Internet and have them shipped anywhere in the world.
Hay, however, you have to find locally. Look in the classified ads in the local 
newspaper (under “hay and alfalfa” or “livestock”), find sources through word 
of mouth from your neighbors, or check message boards at the country stores.
 
After you find a hay source, try to work with the same people every time. 
You’ll be considered a good customer, and they’ll be more apt to work with 
you during emergencies (like when you run out of hay, even though you were 
meaning to call to order more).

 Chapter 3: Caring for and Feeding Your Animals

Storing feed properly
Buying small quantities of animal feed isn’t very efficient, so buying in bulk is 
the way to go. And bulk purchases mean you need good storage facilities to 
keep weather from destroying the feed and local wildlife from eating it up.
Hay should be stored inside a barn or, at the very least, covered with a tarp 
to protect it from weather and wildlife. You can store other feeds, such as 
minerals or treats, in plastic tubs.
 
If the moisture content of hay is more than 22 percent, bacteria can cause a 
chemical reaction that produces a lot of heat. The haystack can spontane-
ously combust, causing a fire. Avoid packing the bales closely together, and 
leave some air pockets in your haystack. Good circulation greatly reduces 
the possibility of fire. Keep an eye on the hay for the first six weeks after 
baling — temperatures above 150 degrees are dangerous.
Finding the right diet
The right diet is important for a healthy life, and each animal has individual 
dietary needs. Table 3-1 gives you the basics, but within a category, you may 
have animals that need more or less than the average or that may require 
supplements. Your vet, cooperative extension service, and neighbors can 
give you more specific advice.

Improper feeding can introduce health problems such as weight loss, listless-
ness, and hair loss. Hoofed animals sometimes develop laminitis, an inflamma-
tion of the lamina propia (the internal structure of the hoof). This condition 
can develop when the feed doesn’t contain enough protein, contains too 
much freshly cut grass, or contains too much grain. Keeping a good eye on the 
hooves can help you spot problems like this before they get out of hand.
Supplementing with salt licks and mineral sources
Most animals need some sort of mineral supplement, depending on the 
breed, the area, and the quality of feed. Most animals benefit by having a salt 
lick nearby (country stores have salt blocks and specially designed holders 
for them), but some also need other minerals that aren’t in their primary 
feed. For example, goats need a small amount of copper in their diets, which 
you can provide with a supplement found at the farm store.
 
Sheep’s livers can’t handle much copper, so be careful not to leave copper 
mixture around if you have sheep and goats in the same pasture. If a sheep 
gets too much copper, that copper breaks down its blood cells, clogging up 
vital organs and leading to kidney or liver failure.

Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Trace mineral blocks or grains are also available and, depending on the 
animal and the soil in your region, you may need to get some. Certain areas 
of the United States have soil that’s deficient in selenium, so the hay that 
grows there lacks sufficient quantities of this mineral, which aids in muscle 
health. This deficiency can be rectified by purchasing a salt block with sele-
nium. Check with your local country store, neighbor, or cooperative exten-
sion service to see what — if any — trace minerals your animals may need. 
Soil tests can also reveal deficiencies.
Indulging your animals with treats
Who doesn’t love treats? Animals are no different from humans in that 
respect. However, just as chocolate probably shouldn’t be one of your major 
food groups, animal treats are something critters should eat in moderation.
Handing out treats is more for social bonding than for nutrition. Treats come in 
many forms. The most common are grains or fruit and veggie scraps. Read on 
for details and see Table 3-1 for some specific suggestions and restrictions.
 
 Grains: Grain comes in so many mixtures! Barley or oats are the most 
common, but you can also mix in corn, molasses, and all sorts of other 
things. Your local country store has some basics, and you can ask the 
workers there or your neighbors for mixture recipes.
 
 Grain is high in carbohydrates and can pack on the pounds — a pro or 
con depending on an animal’s individual needs.
 
 Fruits and vegetables: Some fruits are good treats, and some aren’t. 
Apples, for example, are a big favorite with horses. Animals also love 
certain veggies — lettuce is popular, as are carrots. Cows and other 
animals love crushed corn. Try various veggies to see what your crew 
appreciates.
 
 With any fruit or veggie, try not to give critters the cores, which may 
present a choking hazard.
Providing a Continuous 
Source of Clean Water
A good, reliable source of clean, fresh water is essential to any animal’s well-
being. Just putting out a bowl or bucket of water isn’t always enough. Many 
farm animals step, sit, or roll in their water bowls, or even throw them in 
the air. Thus, getting a water bowl, bucket, or system that’s designed espe-
cially for livestock or poultry is a good idea. Automatic, heated waterers are 
particularly helpful during the winter (see “Preventing freezes” later in this 
chapter).

 Chapter 3: Caring for and Feeding Your Animals
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
Estimating water needs
In hot, dry conditions, a mature cow needs between 10 and 20 gallons of 
water a day! Other animals may not need that much, but they still need a lot. 
So a reliable water source is absolutely necessary. If you don’t have an auto-
matic system on your property, you need to regularly fill buckets or troughs 
to keep your animals hydrated.
 
Water access points should be located where they’re most convenient to 
you, because you’re the one who tends to their maintenance.
Of course, each pen needs its own water source. The size of the buckets or 
troughs depends on the number and type of animals you have in each pen. 
Water needs vary by season, conditioning, and life stages. An average horse 
needs 10 to 12 gallons per day, but nursing mares in the summer can require 
up to 25 gallons per day. Monitor water intake to see what your animals need 
and then provide a bucket or trough that accommodates at least two days’ 
worth of water.
Considering common water sources
Some properties are fortunate enough to include natural water sources, but 
many people need to bring water to their animals. You can get pretty creative 
with how you keep your animals hydrated.
Streams and stock ponds
A natural stream or stock pond on your property can eliminate the need to 
bring water to your animals (unless of course you’re in an area where the 
winter season means frozen water).
 
However, not all stream and pond water is suitable for drinking. With all the 
chemicals used in today’s farming and salt on the roads in the wintertime, let 
alone animal feces (not knowing anything about E. coli and Giardia, animals 
aren’t careful about leaving the stream to urinate or defecate), contaminants 
get into the water supply.
A fast-moving stream can reduce contamination problems. Ponds, on the 
other hand, are relatively static water supplies. Dirt, leaves, and feces can 
accumulate, creating a breeding ground for bugs and germs.
 
You may not be able to tell how good water is simply by looking at it — a nice, 
clear pond or stream with no muddy residue or algae may still be contami-
nated. If you want to use a stream or pond for stock watering, get it tested.

490
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
If the water gets your stamp of approval, here are some options for getting it 
to your critters:
 
 Set up corrals (fences) so that each separate pen has access to the 
water but animals can’t go between pens. Use fencing or gates that go 
down to the bottom and prohibit any animal from sneaking under and 
entering another (forbidden) pen.
 
 Let the animals wander down to drink at will. With this option, limit 
access points so the critters don’t trample the entire bank, speeding up 
erosion and dirt accumulation.
 
 Use an automatic waterer to pump water into a trough (and maybe even 
a small swimming hole) and prevent the animals from actually walking 
into the water. See the later section “Automatic waterers” for informa-
tion on how this device works.
 
 Allow gravity to pull water down into your troughs.
Wells
Wells are a great source of water for your animals. Use a well to supply water 
to an automatic waterer the same way you use it to supply water to your 
house. You can simply use hoses or install underground lines directly out to 
the animals. Some well water is incredibly nice — fresh and pure. However, 
other water contains unwanted minerals that you may need to filter out.
Manually filled buckets and troughs
The old-fashioned way of supplying water involves manually filling some sort 
of container, such as a bucket, trough, or large drum (see Figure 3-1). An old 
bathtub actually works really well as a waterer. You can also use plastic bar-
rels with the tops cut off, or you can make a trough out of a 50-gallon drum 
that has been cut in half. Every week, water troughs need to be emptied and 
cleaned, and the water replaced. In the winter, troughs must be heated to 
prevent freezing.
Automatic waterers
If your waterer is set up to automatically refill (a pretty cool concept, by the 
way), a float in the system detects when the water goes below a certain level, 
triggering the valves to open and fill the waterer back up.
You can automate underground pipes or use temporary lines, such as above-
ground drip irrigation hoses. You can even install temperature regulators to 
prevent the water from freezing by turning on heat.
These systems can be electric, solar powered, or even energy-free. They may 
be commercially made or do-it-yourself. The station where you configure the 
system should be in a location that’s easy to get to, so you can easily make 
modifications, change batteries (if using solar power), or just check on it.

Preventing freezes
In many parts of the U.S., winter equals cold temperatures, and that means 
the water in outside water buckets is going to ice up. But the small farmer 
has a couple options for keeping fresh water from freezing: a heated water 
bucket, usually a plastic one with an embedded heating coil and plug, or a 
submersible tank de-icer that’s placed directly in the bucket. Both are shown 
in Figure 3-2.
 
Figure 3-2: 
A water 
bucket with 
a built-in 
heating 
element 
(left) and a 
submersible 
tank de-icer 
(right).
 
 
If the animals drink directly from the trough (meaning it’s not a holding tank 
that you draw water from), consider using a heater design that screws into 
the plug in the bottom of the trough rather than one that has a cord that 

492
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
drapes over the top. Animals can pull out cords draped over the top, allow-
ing the water to freeze and possibly burning out the unit.
 
If you run an electrical cord outside to plug in your heating elements, protect 
the connection from moisture. Plug the heating element into the plug and 
then wrap the entire connection with lots of electrical tape. That way, no 
water can get in and cause a short.
Letting Your Animals Romp
Animals don’t like to be cooped up, and subjecting them to this treatment 
can affect their health and temperament. Being in the fresh air, stretching 
their legs, and chasing their friends around the pasture aren’t just enjoyable 
activities — they’re therapeutic!
 
Busting loose is a year-round activity. Don’t assume your animals don’t want 
to go outdoors just because it’s cold or snowing outside. Although animals 
seek the shelter of their enclosure at times (during sideways-blowing snow 
comes to mind!), most animals really like and even prefer to be in the fresh 
air, and they generally go outdoors (at least for a little while) in even the 
harshest weather.
Proper exercise depends on the animal.
 
 Horses that live in stables need the most attention. Riding them regu-
larly is best. Otherwise, you can consider getting a circular motorized 
walker that looks sort of like a merry-go-round. You hook the horse up 
to it and turn it on, and it walks the horse.
 
 Llamas tend to run around at times and don’t really need anything fur-
ther, unless you want them in hiking shape. Then you need to regularly 
take them for a spin around the neighborhood.
 
 Cows, especially those you’re raising for meat, don’t need a lot of exer-
cise because that means weight loss.
Protecting Your Precious Critters
Animals can’t always fend for themselves, so it’s up to you to act as their 
caretaker, providing reliable shelter for protection from predators and the 
weather. The specific type of shelter needed depends on which animals you 
have. Rabbits need separate hutches; chickens and other small birds need 
housing; and sheep and goats need a guard animal.

493
 Chapter 3: Caring for and Feeding Your Animals
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
Animals should have inside shelter when the weather gets really nasty. Some, 
like llamas, don’t seem to notice when the weather is bad, but most run for 
cover and need a comforting place to go.
Besides separate shelters and guards, fencing is a must. Not only does fenc-
ing keep your animals from straying away, but it also serves to keep larger 
predators out of the pens.
 
Dogs are one of the worst predators of many farm animals, so your fencing 
should be dog-proof (which also makes it coyote- and fox-proof). Introduce 
dogs to your farm animals slowly and don’t leave them without a chaperone 
until you’re sure they get along. Dogs can attack and be attacked. Cats usu-
ally get along well with other farm animals, except for baby birds and rabbits.
 
Never tether an animal to a fence post and leave it there. A tied animal is vul-
nerable to predators, and the restraints prevent it from getting exercise. The 
poor critter can also get rope burns or even severe injuries from the rope.
Handling Disconcerting Behavior
Each animal has an innate personality, and sometimes personalities clash. 
Additionally, some of the things you do (or don’t do) directly affect the way 
your animals behave. The next few sections present some of the behavioral 
problems you may encounter.
Keeping your critters from 
thinking you’re one of them
Animals aren’t four-legged humans, so don’t treat them as such — even if 
you have to take special care of a young one. Doing so can cause problems 
down the road. If you have to bottle-feed an animal, get the little one back 
with a herd or flock as soon as you can. The adults in the group can show the 
newbie the ropes.
Bottle-feeding has its benefits: It typically produces tamer animals, making 
them easier to catch when the time comes to shear them or trim their 
hooves. But there are trade-offs. The following sections cover some of the 
hazards of blurring the boundaries between animal-human relationships.
 
For both nutritional and behavioral reasons, babies should stay with their 
mothers until they know how to eat on their own. If you’re going to give an 
animal to another farm that doesn’t have other animals of its kind or age, 

494
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
you may want to leave the baby with its mother for a couple more months. 
Also, keep in mind that herd animals don’t do well if you take them out of the 
herd altogether. Llamas, for instance, should always go in pairs (at minimum) 
because they need social interaction with another of their kind.
Aggression
If you teach a male animal that it’s just another person, the critter may treat 
people as competition for the females during breeding season, making it 
very aggressive toward people. Aggression carries over into other aspects of 
the animal’s life as well. Competition for food can cause a friendly little cow 
to turn on you if it thinks you want to deprive it of some of the food in the 
trough.
Aggressive behavior manifests differently for different animals. For example, 
llamas typically don’t spit at people, but if your llama thinks it’s the same as 
you, you’re a prime target.
Having billy goats think you’re one of them can have an unwanted and down-
right gross consequence. During the rut (mating season), they get stinky with 
urine. Apparently in the goat world, stinky is attractive, and the stinkiest guy 
always gets the girl. If you happen to go out into the pen with grain, your 
old pal Mr. Goat may come running to rub up against you. Like llama spit, a 
stinky goat is right up there with things you don’t want to smell like.
 
Regardless of the amount of (over)bonding you’ve had with your goats or 
sheep, you should never turn your back on the males. If they see you as a 
threat, they may charge and can easily knock you down. Some people have 
been killed this way — by hitting their heads in a fall or being trampled. 
That’s not a good way to go.
Improper socialization
A female that gets a lot of attention as a youngster doesn’t typically turn 
aggressive on you. The main concern is that the animal won’t be properly 
socialized. If a female bonds too closely with humans, it may not fit as well in 
the herd because it wants attention from you, not its peers.
When a young animal leaves its mother too early, the little one may not have 
had enough time to figure out how to be that animal and how to interact with 
others of the breed. Without the proper socialization, the critter may not 
know how to get along because nobody put it in its place when it got out of 
hand as a youngster. Or it may not pick up the things a mom teaches in those 
early days, such as what to eat or even how to play.

Managing social problems
If too many animals are occupying a small space, or if you have trouble sup-
pressing the aggressive actions of a dominant animal, you’ll see some fighting 
and general meanness. Animals compete for food, water, attention from you, 
and sometimes even the prime resting spots. Here’s how to deal with these 
issues:
 
 Handling overcrowding: To get around overcrowding, either thin the 
herd or make a new pen so the living quarters are a more spacious. 
Establishing a few separate feeding places is also helpful.
 
 Removing weapons: Goats typically use their horns to fight and to 
establish the pecking order, but these horns can cause injury to other 
goats (and humans). A common practice is to disbud them (remove the 
bud or beginning of the horn) when a goat is 3 to 7 days old. You can 
also dehorn an older animal, but that process is more involved, requir-
ing a sedative and a veterinarian.
 
 Castrating aggressive males: Testosterone may increase aggression, so 
having males castrated may be helpful. Although larger animals have to 
be taken to the vet, smaller animals, such as goats, can be castrated by 
placing bands around the testicles at an early age. The blood supply is 
slowly cut off, and the testicles shrivel up and fall off.
 
 Never use old, brittle bands that can break, because if the castration 
process has started and the band breaks before the process is complete, 
you can lose the animal to gangrene. Make sure you get some training 
before you try this method or you do it under the supervision of a pro-
fessional.
 
 Separating aggressors: Separating aggressive animals is better than 
subjecting animals to injury. You may have an animal that’s simply mean 
or just doesn’t get along with the rest of the herd. You can either experi-
ment with different roommates until you find a good combination or 
house the aggressive animal by itself.
Training animals for human interaction
Unless you plan to take your farm animals to shows or turn them into movie 
stars, most can do without training. You need to be able to control your ani-
mals somewhat to get them to go into holding pens, for instance, but most 
animals are either small enough for you to get them where you want them or 
they naturally follow the herd.

496
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
A couple of exceptions are horses and llamas that you intend to use as pack 
animals. Training is essential with these creatures because they’re large, and 
you need to get very close to ride them or to put a pack on their backs. At 
the very least, you need to halter-train them so you can lead them around. 
Untrained, they may panic and hurt you.
 
The earlier you start training animals, the better. As they get older and stuck 
in their ways, training them becomes increasingly difficult. Starting training 
early is also a good way to ensure better handling for maintenance tasks, 
such as grooming or medical attention.

 Understanding the importance of properly administered vaccinations
 Knowing when to call the vet
 Preparing for the pitter-patter of little hooves
You can head off a lot of trouble with your animals simply by keeping 
their living conditions clean and taking care of their basic food, water, 
and shelter needs (all of which are covered in Book V, Chapter 3). However, 
you still have to provide medical attention from time to time. Doing so keeps 
your animals healthy and stops any potential problems from getting beyond 
the point of fixing.
Sad but true, animals become sick, get into fights, or have difficult births — 
situations that can require medical attention and know-how. You can provide 
some of this care yourself if the problem is minor, which is good because 
calling on a vet can be pricey, especially if he or she has to come out to your 
property.
For other procedures, you want to call for backup. This chapter helps you 
determine what you can do yourself, points out some of the common ail-
ments that are most likely to crop up, and explains a few animal-specific 
problems. Remember: These tips are only guidelines — consult your vet for 
specific advice.
 
Unless you’ve had plenty of training, don’t try to self-diagnose. If you misdiag-
nose a problem, you could end up with an even bigger medical issue on your 
hands. A simple eye infection, for example, can look like a scratch, but treat-
ment for a scratch when the problem is actually an infection can lead to loss 
of the eye. You can check out the Merck Veterinary Manual (www.merckvet
manual.com) if you want to read more about animal ailments.

Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Putting Together Your 
Animal First-Aid Kit
Minor problems and emergencies are facts of life, even with animals, so 
having a first-aid kit for your farm friends is a must. The next couple sections 
give you an idea of what to include. Keep your kit wherever’s most conven-
ient for you, possibly inside the house to ensure it’s free from nosy critters.
 
The best place to acquire animal first-aid supplies is your local veterinarian, 
because vets know all the ins and outs of animal care. But you can always try 
these other options, too:
 
 A farm or country store: In the Southwest, a chain called Intermountain 
Farmers Association (www.ifacountrystore.com) has just about 
everything you need. Mills Fleet Farm stores (www.fleetfarm.com) in 
the Midwest are similar.
 
 The Internet: With just a click of a mouse, you can now easily find prod-
ucts that once weren’t so easy to get. Country stores may sell products 
online, or you can check out a medical supplier such as United Vet 
Equine (www.unitedvetequine.com).
Including creams, antiseptics, 
sprays, and meds
You can easily take care of minor accidents and injuries yourself if you 
have the necessary supplies. A basic animal first-aid kit should have at least 
these items:
 
 Antibiotic cream: You use antibiotic cream for minor wounds to remove 
bacteria and prevent more from growing.
 
 Bag Balm: Its intended use is to keep cows’ udders soft (thus its name), 
but it’s also really good on anything that’s dry and cracked, such as 
noses, calluses, or foot pads.
 
 Fly repellent spray: Face it, animals attract flies. In many cases, the fly 
problem can be worse than whatever smells the animals make. Dealing 
with flies is a big job in the hot summer months.
 
 Fly prevention is particularly necessary around sick or injured animals. 
Flies get into wounds and lay eggs, which hatch into really disgusting 
creatures — maggots.

 Gentle antiseptic solution: Some people prefer to use antiseptic solu-
tions such as chlorhexidine diacetate (Nolvasan) on wounds and cut 
umbilical cords because these solutions aren’t as irritating as iodine or 
hydrogen peroxide.
 
 Hydrogen peroxide: Because of how it foams up, hydrogen peroxide 
does a good job of getting dirt out of wounds. You can also use it as a 
disinfectant (to sterilize inanimate objects) or as an emetic (to make ani-
mals vomit) if they get into rat poison.
 
 Iodine: An iodine solution is a good topical antibacterial solution.
 
 Tincuture of iodine, a stronger solution that’s 7 percent iodine, isn’t rec-
ommended because it can be very irritating to the skin. You don’t want 
to get any in the eyes for sure.
 
 Miscellaneous medications: Deworming meds or vitamins can help. 
For allergies, maybe include some diphenhydramine hydrochloride 
(Benadryl), which is used mostly in small animals — such as dogs — 
that get stung by wasps or bees.
 
 Scarlet oil: Used primarily in horses or mules, scarlet oil is a nondry-
ing topical antiseptic used to promote healing in the treatment of cuts, 
wounds, abrasions, or burns. You can find it at your local farm store.
 
 Do what the vets do: Use scarlet oil for anything above the knees and a 
light iodine solution for anything below the knees.
Gathering basic equipment
In addition to the topical solutions listed in the preceding section, your first-
aid kit also needs some basic equipment for monitoring temperatures, clean-
ing and covering wounds, and otherwise taking care of your farm friends’ 
hygiene. Here are some tools of the trade:
 
 Basic bandaging material: You typically use bandages on extremities — 
after all, you’d go through an awful lot of bandages if you were to wrap 
them around the animal’s chest! Wrapping up a wound on a leg, neck, or 
tail can help speed recovery and keep flies off.
 
 Bulb syringe: A bulb syringe is great for sucking fluid out of a newborn’s 
nose and mouth to help it breathe on its own.
 
 Clean cloths: Use clean cloths to create hot packs for treating injuries 
around larger body parts, such as an animal’s torso. See the later sec-
tion “Treating minor scrapes and cuts” for details.

500
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
 Flytrap: The more flies you can trap, the fewer you have buzzing around 
your animals and breeding more little pests. Stick with a heavy duty 
flytrap, such as the Ridmax one shown in Figure 4-1, or order some fly 
parasites — tiny, wasplike insects that eat fly pupae.
 
Figure 4-1: 
This type 
of flytrap, 
which is 
very useful 
in barns, 
traps more 
flies than 
flypaper.
 
 
 Gauze pads: These pads come in a variety of sizes (typically 2 inches, 3 
inches, and 4 inches square) and with different plies (the more layers, 
the more they soak up). Have a supply of several different sizes and 
plies on hand for whatever comes up.
 
 Long cotton swabs: Useful for cleaning tight spaces such as little punc-
ture wounds, abscesses, and the occasional ear (you may even be able 
to remove ticks this way), cotton swabs are handy to keep around. But 
use them with care — if you don’t have a good hold on the animal, you 
can cause further injury.
 
 Syringes: Keep a few syringes of different sizes on hand. Use them to 
flush solutions (like hydrogen peroxide) into a wound, feed newborns, 
or give oral liquid medications.
 
 Thermometer: Thermometers are, obviously, for taking temperatures. 
Make sure you label it rectal (once a rectal, always a rectal). Choose 
from the old-fashioned glass kind that usually takes about a minute to 
register the temperature or the newfangled digital kind that gives a read-
ing in a few seconds.
For those times when your animal has to go to the vet, you also need some 
sort of transport. Smaller animals such as goats or sheep can ride in the cab 
of a pickup truck or inside a large dog kennel in the truck bed. For larger ani-
mals, you really need a trailer.

An Ounce of Prevention: 
Scheduling Vaccinations
Every species has different preventive vaccination needs, with emphasis 
on the word needs. If you don’t get regular vaccinations for your animals, 
sickness and even death can be just around the corner. Although you can’t 
possibly vaccinate against all diseases an animal can get, each animal you 
own should receive at least a few basic vaccines. Find a vet with farm animal 
experience and schedule regular visits. In rural areas, you may be able to find 
a mobile vet who comes to you.
 
Good hygiene, up-to-date vaccinations, and all that preventive stuff pay divi-
dends in money and time down the road. Routine maintenance and attention 
to minor problems can help keep your animals comfy and happy.
Knowing the basic vaccines
Just as humans receive childhood vaccinations, animals should be given vac-
cinations against some diseases as a matter of course. Which diseases you 
have to watch out for depends on what’s prevalent in your area, the history 
of your herd, and whether a disease is likely to be contracted. But as a gen-
eral rule, consider the following vaccinations:
 
 Tetanus: All animals can get tetanus, but horses are particularly prone 
to it. The tetanus bacteria is in soil and is usually introduced into ani-
mals via a puncture wound — from nails, barbed wire, or any kind of 
deep cut. Tetanus causes lockjaw (where the animal’s jaws actually lock 
up so it can’t eat), convulsions, and sensitivity to light.
 
 Clostridial diseases: Animals can catch all sorts of diseases from 
Clostridium bacteria, including foot root, botulism, and intestinal dis-
eases. (Tetanus is actually a clostridial disease.)
 
 Rabies: All animals are susceptible to rabies, a nasty virus that’s trans-
mitted by bite wounds and often causes death. There are two types of 
rabies:
 
• Dumb rabies causes an animal to become dull and lethargic and 
not want to eat anything.
 
• Furious rabies causes aggressive behavioral changes and foaming 
at the mouth.

502
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
 Brucellosis: This disease causes stillbirths and miscarriages in cattle 
and is also transmittable to people. The human form of this disease, 
called undulant fever, is a flulike disease with symptoms that never go 
away. It’s incredibly hard to cure, and the infected human usually has a 
chronic flu, exhibiting symptoms every couple of weeks.
 
 Mastitis: Animals that produce milk (cattle or goats) can get mastitis, an 
infection of the mammary gland (the udder) that causes clotted milk or 
a hard or tender udder.
 
 Nasal infections and pneumonia: Pigs should be vaccinated against 
these conditions.
 
Young animals are often more susceptible to infection and are thus more 
likely to benefit from certain vaccinations that may be unnecessary when 
they get older. For instance, young animals may need to be vaccinated 
against respiratory diseases.
Consulting your vet for immunizations
Not all vaccines are alike. Some may not induce a good enough response; 
others may generate unforeseen reactions. So in terms of the health of your 
animals, your local vet is usually the best-qualified person to evaluate vaccines 
and choose one that’s likely to have the best results. How often your animals 
need vaccinations will vary — your vet can help you set up a schedule.
Still need convincing? Following are some other reasons the vet is likely the 
best one to be administering these (and really any) meds:
 
 In very rare cases, animals have bad reactions to vaccines. If you give 
the vaccine yourself, you may not pick up on the reaction, or you may 
not get your animal to the vet in time to treat it. One such reaction is 
severe anaphylactic shock, which causes difficulty breathing and a 
sudden drop in blood pressure — the animal can just collapse. Death 
can occur within a very short time, so getting help fast is critical.
 
 Vaccines require proper handling. They should be refrigerated, diluted 
correctly, not exposed to heat or freezing temperatures, and adminis-
tered with a sterile syringe.
 
 Some vaccines go under the skin (subcutaneous), and some go in the 
muscle (intramuscular). Neither type should go into the vein. If given the 
wrong way, these vaccines may not be effective at all, or they may cause 
death or other serious health consequences.
 
 Manufacturers don’t (and can’t) guarantee that all animals given their 
vaccine will be able to produce the required antibodies to fight off the 
disease the vaccine was formulated against. The best way to ensure that 
your vaccine is effective is to have a vet select and administer it.

 Syringes and needles are considered hazardous waste and must be dis-
posed of in specific ways. You can’t just toss a used needle into your 
wastebasket.
 
 Only a licensed veterinarian can administer the rabies vaccine. If you 
give it yourself, the state considers your animal to be unvaccinated.
 
Believe it or not, you can have an expert administer your animals’ vaccina-
tions affordably. Try arranging it so that all your animals are being vac-
cinated at the same time. You pay a base fee for the vet to come out to the 
farm and then a charge per animal. Better yet, there may even be a financial 
break when you get to a certain number of animals.
Administering the vaccinations yourself
Although most vets don’t recommend that you do vaccinations yourself (see 
the preceding section for several reasons why), many farmers do vaccinate 
their own animals — and this decision mostly has to do with money. If you 
have 40 sheep, paying a vet to vaccinate them all can cost a pretty penny. 
And some animals that aren’t very expensive themselves may not warrant 
spending so much on vaccinations — the house call for the vaccination may 
cost more than the animal is worth. This isn’t a good mindset, but it’s one 
that some farmers get into.
 
Most vets are willing to show farm animal owners how to administer shots, 
so consult with yours before undertaking the task yourself. Remember, 
though, that only a licensed vet can administer a rabies vaccine for it to be 
considered valid by the state.
Caring for Sick or Hurt Animals
Despite all your attention to their health, animals sometimes get sick or 
hurt. They may have encounters with wildlife and end up losing. Sometimes 
a minor medical problem balloons into a bigger one. The following sections 
offer help recognizing signs of sickness, understanding treatments you can 
use, and knowing when to call in the veterinary cavalry.
 
You can’t know what’s abnormal until you know what normal is. When you go 
out to feed your animals, give them a once-over to check for health problems. 
Keep a close eye on them so you can catch the minor scrapes and take care 
of them before they become major infections. Daily observation tells you the 
animals’ habits, what they like, and how they react to different situations.

504
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Watching for signs of sickness
Determining whether your animal is just having a bad day or really is sick 
and in need of attention isn’t always easy, but a few red flags always demand 
action.
 
 Limited activity: If you notice an animal is down, that doesn’t necessar-
ily mean there’s a problem. It may just be resting or basking in the sun. 
But if an animal is down for a while, try to get the critter up and see what 
it does.
 
 Loss of appetite: Sometimes animals just don’t want to eat. Maybe 
the day’s too hot, or perhaps they’re wiped out and need rest first. Or 
maybe the food is actually bad, and they just refuse to eat it. All these 
scenarios are possible, but if one of your animals continually sniffs its 
food without eating, something’s wrong.
 
 A good way to test an animal’s appetite is to give it oats or other favorite 
treats. If an animal that usually becomes putty in your hands when oats 
are offered suddenly isn’t interested, it’s probably ill.
 
 Weight loss: Animals may become thin because they simply aren’t 
getting sufficient food, which may be the result of an infection that’s 
draining them of nutrients and energy. Weight loss may also be due to 
parasites, poor nutrition, or a case of bad teeth that need dental care.
 
 Reduction in milk production: Milk production is an even more sensi-
tive gauge than appetite for some animals. Lactating females produce 
plenty of milk. If their milk production is off, you know something’s up.
 
 Other obvious signs of disease: Many other symptoms can indicate that 
your animal isn’t feeling up to snuff. Excessive coughing, a runny nose, 
diarrhea, or anything else that’s just not normal for the animal probably 
means medical attention is necessary.
 
If you’re concerned, call your vet and ask whether he or she thinks you 
should bring the animal in (or whether a house call is in order).
Wearing the doctor’s cap: 
What you can do
You can take care of a few basic tasks yourself when you see that your ani-
mals aren’t in the best of health. The next several sections cover ways you 
can treat and monitor a sick or injured animal.

Taking temperatures
Temperatures outside the normal range can indicate many problems. If you 
see a difference in temperature, it’s probably time to call a vet. Here are some 
possible causes of low or high temperatures:
Low Temperature 
High Temperature
Shock (from blood loss, trauma,  
Infections (bacterial and viral)
heart problems, or allergic 
reactions) 
Hypothermia (prolonged exposure  
Heat stroke (hyperthermia)
to subnormal temps) 
 
Seizures
 
Drug reactions
Animal temperatures must be taken rectally. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Secure the animal.
 
 You have to secure the animal because taking its temperature isn’t going 
to be met with cooperation. Plus, if the animal balks (maybe violently), 
you can get hurt, or the thermometer may break. Not good.
 
2. Tie a piece of rubber tubing or twine around one end of the thermom-
eter, secure an alligator clip to the other end of the tubing, and clip 
that to the animal’s hair.
 
 Animals can suck the instrument up into the rectum or push it out with 
quite a bit of force. If it gets sucked in, you can pull it out, and if the 
animal tries to push it out, the alligator clamp prevents it from going 
flying across the room.
 
3. Lubricate the thermometer with something such as Vaseline or K-Y 
Jelly.
 
4. For a glass thermometer, put it about halfway in the animal’s rectum 
and leave it in about one minute (or follow the instructions for your 
particular thermometer).
 
5. Clean the thermometer after use.
 
 Get rid of any residue with soap and water first. Then dip the thermom-
eter in alcohol for a few minutes to sterilize it.
Different animals have different normal temperatures. Use Table 4-1 as a 
guide when you’re checking temperatures, normal or otherwise.

Treating minor scrapes and cuts
Scrapes and cuts happen. An animal may get caught up in the fencing, or get 
a little too aggressive at the grain bucket. A minor scratch isn’t a matter of 
life or death, but taking care of it can mean making the animal more comfort-
able and preventing the minor problem from turning into a major one.
 
Determining what’s minor is kind of a judgment call. Check the size of the 
injury (the surface area) as well as how deep it goes. Then follow these 
guidelines:
 
 If the cut goes full thickness — in other words, it goes all the way 
through the skin and into the tissue below it so that you can move the 
two sides of the cut in opposing directions — then the wound is serious, 
and you should call your vet.
 
 Regardless of whether the cut is full thickness, if it’s at or near a joint, 
the eyes, or a vital organ, it’s a concern. You don’t want to mess with 
that injury yourself.
 
 A surface cut or one that’s only 1 inch or so long is probably going to be 
okay and should respond favorably to minor treatments.
To treat minor cuts, clean them with hydrogen peroxide or an antiseptic solu-
tion and then bathe them in some sort of antibiotic ointment or Bag Balm to 
protect them (ask your vet for product recommendations). Then cover the 
wound with a sterile bandage. Keep bandages dry and clean and change them 
every day, or at least every other day.
 
Don’t wrap bandages too tightly! No bandage at all is better than one that 
cuts off circulation.

507
 Chapter 4: Providing Medical Attention
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
When you can’t wrap a bandage around the injured body part (such as a 
torso), wash out the wound with an antiseptic solution or a half-strength 
hydrogen peroxide solution (one part hydrogen peroxide and one part 
water). To reduce swelling and decrease blood flow, put a cold pack on the 
affected area for 10 to 15 minutes (or however long the animal sits still for it).
If the wound becomes infected, soak a clean cloth in hot water and place it on 
the wound for a few minutes (or as long as the animal lets you). This hot pack 
stimulates blood flow and promotes local immunity. Finally, put some anti-
biotic ointment or Bag Balm on the wound to protect it from other bacteria. 
With horses, you may want to consider an antiseptic spray such as Wound-
Kote, which medicates and dries.
 
As long as the cut continues to heal, you’re okay. If it gets worse, a visit to or 
from the vet is in order.
Deworming
In veterinary terms, worms aren’t the squishy creatures you use when you go 
fishing. They’re parasites that get into an animal’s gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
from a variety of sources. Mostly, animals ingest them from eating grass or 
other foodstuffs off the ground, but animals can also be born with them.
Worms in the GI tract rob an animal of necessary nutrients. Getting rid of 
them, or deworming, is a routine act that decreases the worm load that’s 
stealing nutrition from the animal. Some deworming medications are injected, 
whereas others are given orally. Either way, they usually have to be admin-
istered more than once within a short period of time so you can be sure all 
worms are cleaned out.
 
You can obtain deworming meds from a farm supply store and administer 
them yourself, but check with your vet for specifics.
Giving vitamin supplements
Whether your animals need vitamin supplements depends on their health 
and the conditions in their environment. Check with your vet, the local 
cooperative extension service, or the country store for information about 
what your animals’ diets may be lacking.
Here are some common vitamin shots:
 
 Vitamins A, D, E, and K: Mostly, animals obtain these vitamins from 
dietary sources, but in some cases, an animal may need an extra boost 
because its food sources don’t contain enough. Vitamin supplement 
shots can alleviate many symptoms of deficiency, such as lethargy, a 
poor coat, or an inability to gain weight.

508
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
 Vitamin B: This vitamin is an appetite stimulant that can be given to an 
animal at any point in its life (including while it’s a newborn) if it isn’t 
eating and needs a little push.
 
 Vitamin E or selenium: Some goats and sheep receive these shots sub-
cutaneously at birth to ward off white muscle disease. After the initial 
shot, the animal may need a booster.
 
 White muscle disease is a degenerative disease that causes anything 
from mild stiffness to obvious pain upon walking, or even an inability to 
stand if it attacks the skeletal muscles. It can also cause difficulty breath-
ing, a frothy nasal discharge, and fever if it affects the heart muscles.
Before administering vitamin shots yourself, have your vet show you how. 
Vitamin or mineral blocks, which are similar to a salt lick, are also a good way 
to get these nutrients into your animals. You can purchase these meds from a 
local farm supply store.
Determining when you need a vet
Some situations are just too much for the average farmer to deal with, so you 
need an expert to come to the rescue. Typically, you can find a mobile vet in 
your area, but sometimes you may have to load your animal into a trailer and 
take it to the vet.
No matter where you live, you can usually find a 24-hour emergency clinic for 
smaller animals; rural communities often have a 24-hour number to call for 
large animals. In some places, the local large-animal vets form a cooperative 
where each vet does a stint of on-call duty and then has time off. You can 
obtain this phone number from your vet or local farm store.
You absolutely must call a vet when you notice that an animal
 
 Has obvious external injuries: Such injuries include profuse bleeding, a 
huge gash or lump, and/or an obvious broken bone.
 
 Is extremely depressed, lethargic, or thin: Consider any of these condi-
tions a cause for alarm. (Of course, your animals will never reach this 
point because you’re watching them daily, right?)
 
 Is completely uninterested in food: You should be concerned if an 
animal hasn’t touched its food after 24 hours and isn’t interested in 
treats. Horses shouldn’t even go this long. If they’re not eating, watch 
them continually. If they go down, that could be a sign of colic.
 
 Lays down and doesn’t get back up: An animal that can’t get up has 
usually crossed into the serious category. If you can’t get your animal to 
stand, something is drastically wrong.

509
 Chapter 4: Providing Medical Attention
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
 
 If a horse goes down and starts to roll, get it up immediately and walk it. 
You now face two potential problems — colic, which means the horse 
can’t defecate or vomit due to abdominal problems, and the rolling, 
which can cause the intestine to twist. Call the vet and continue to walk 
the horse until he or she arrives. If your vet has given you some flunixin 
meglumine (Banamine, an anti-inflammatory prescription drug), he or 
she may instruct you to give the horse a shot to relieve its pain. But 
beware — a Banamine shot can mask signs the vet needs to diagnose 
the kind of colic.
 
Provided you have access to a 24-hour emergency clinic, your vet is only a 
phone call away. You can call and ask whether the symptoms you’re seeing 
are serious, or whether you can do some treatment yourself. Bottom line: 
If you need a vet, call right away. Waiting can mean your animal won’t pull 
through.
As a courtesy to your vet’s private life, try to take care of potential emer-
gencies as soon as they arise instead of waiting until you can’t put them off 
anymore. Yes, emergencies do happen — sometimes in the middle of the 
night — and your vet will do what he or she can to help save your animal. But 
maintaining a good rapport with your vet is always a good idea, and part of 
that relationship means not having to call in the middle of the night because 
you didn’t handle a situation during regular hours.
Bracing Yourself for Birthing Season
Yes, animal babies have been born throughout the ages — usually without 
any help from humans. But matters can and do go wrong, and if you’re there 
to assist in the birth (or the immediate aftermath) and deal with any prob-
lems, then animals that wouldn’t otherwise make it on their own can have 
a chance at life. You want to be sure you have all of your bases covered at 
birthing time — especially if your animals are prize racehorses or alpacas 
that you hope to sell for big bucks!
Predicting due dates
If you know the time of conception, you can consult Table 4-2 and have a 
pretty good idea of when the baby will arrive. Sometimes knowing precisely 
when the deed happened is easy because you’ve put two critters into a sepa-
rate pen and let them get to know each other better.

When a couple of critters share love behind your back, you can still do tests 
to determine whether a pregnancy has occurred. Animal pregnancy tests 
skip straight to the ultrasound, which works the same as with humans in that 
it sends out a sound wave that bounces through the body and shows up as 
a picture. You don’t need to anesthetize animals — they don’t seem to mind 
the noninvasive procedure. You do, however, have to shave the belly and rub 
some jelly on it to aid in the transmission. (Note: Horses are the exception. 
Their ultrasound tests are done through the anus — a procedure most mares 
aren’t too happy about.)
Preparing for a birth
A lot of animal births go off without a hitch — hence the reason you may 
come home from a day out and find a baby llama or horse on the ground. 
However, with a few precautions to keep the mother comfortable, you can 
aid your farm friend in the birthing process and increase the chances of a 
successful birth.
 
 If you have an idea of the due date, put the mother into an isolated 
area beforehand. Opt for a place under some sort of shelter where she 
can stay warm, dry, stress-free, and away from outside interference. That 
means no screaming children or barking dogs. Stress causes more adrena-
line production, which can actually stop females from pushing. Wind and 
other weather nuisances should also be lessened or eliminated.
 
 Keep a good watch on the mother during this close-to-the-big-moment 
time, and adjust feed as needed. Watch momma closely, a few times 
every day. Installing a video camera can allow you to do your watching 
while still getting your chores done. You may want to get a halter alarm, 

511
 Chapter 4: Providing Medical Attention
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
which goes off when the animal lies down; this device, along with the 
camera system, can allow you to be in the house (even asleep) right up 
until the blessed event.
 
 As the time draws nigh, the mother gets restless and obviously uncom-
fortable — she stands up, lies down, and then does it all again. When she 
starts doing this, she may want or need to go off her feed for about 24 
hours. Watch for contractions and for the mother to start bearing down 
and pushing. If all goes well, a little bubble will come out, followed by a 
nose or foot.
 
 You usually don’t need to step in at all, unless of course there’s a birth-
ing problem. See the later section “Birthing problems: Dystocia” for 
guidance in this situation.
 
 Have an indoor space and plenty of dry straw or bedding available. 
If the birth occurs in the colder months, you want to bring mother and 
babe inside for awhile. And if your farm facility isn’t ready to house 
them, be prepared to improvise. For example, if your newborn farm 
friend arrives in winter, it may need to spend the first month of its life 
with its mother in your garage with a space heater.
Following up on a normal birth
Most of the time, you don’t need to do anything after the mother gives birth 
except fawn over the new baby. But even after a perfect birth, you can take 
some steps to ensure the baby’s and mother’s safety and comfort.
 
 Dip the umbilical cord in a bit of Nolvasan or other nonirritating antiseptic 
solution. Maybe even clamp off the cord and permanently tie it off with 
some string.
 
 Make sure the baby gets dried off. The mom usually does this, but some-
times you need to help. Use some clean straw to rub the baby and get it 
good and free of the birth goo.
 
 Ensure mother and babe are both warm and dry.
 
 Watch to be certain the baby takes its first milk within the first half hour 
or so. This first milk is known as colostrum, a nutrient- and antibody-rich 
substance that’s vital to the newborn’s health.
 
 Consider weighing the baby periodically to be sure it’s putting on weight.
 
 If you own several animals that are having babies at the same time, you 
may want to tag ’em so you can keep track of them.

512
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Handling difficulties during 
and after birth
Despite your precautions, sometimes animal births just don’t go by the book. 
A baby can be stillborn or breech. The birth can take a lot longer than you 
expect. Or an umbilical cord can get wrapped around the little one. The fol-
lowing sections delve into some problems that can occur during or after the 
birth of your new farm friend.
Birthing problems: Dystocia
Dystocia is a fancy name meaning “difficult birth,” and that can mean anything 
from a birth that’s taking too long to one where the mother is in excessive 
discomfort to one where the baby is coming out backward or even stillborn.
 
Watch for signs something is amiss. For instance, perhaps the mother’s water 
has broken and she’s in labor, but nothing is coming out. If a mother goes 
through this scenario for more than a couple of hours, call the vet immediately. 
In horses, you don’t even want to wait that long. Horses have been known to 
rupture the uterus pushing a foal that won’t come out. Call the vet if the mare 
is pushing for ten minutes and nothing is coming out, or if the baby is breech 
(you’re seeing the baby’s rear end rather than its head).
You may also want to elicit the help of a neighbor who has gone through dif-
ficult births in the past and knows what to do.
If the baby isn’t breathing at birth, clear the airway so the little one can begin 
breathing easily on its own. A bulb syringe — or a turkey baster — is great 
for sucking fluid out of babies’ mouths and noses so they can breathe. Tear 
any remaining sac off from around the nose. If that doesn’t do it, rub the baby 
vigorously. Ideally, the mom instinctively knows what to do, but you may 
have to help, especially on a first birth if she’s particularly nervous. You may 
even have to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Mothers rejecting their babies, or vice versa
A mother occasionally rejects her baby for not-so-obvious reasons. 
Sometimes you can figure them out, but sometimes you just don’t know 
why. One speculation is that Charles Darwin’s “survival of the fittest” theory 
applies here. Perhaps the mother knows that a particular baby isn’t strong 
enough to make it, and she wants to give her energy and attention to the 
others that she has more hope for.
Perhaps the mother has mastitis (an infection of the mammary glands) and 
nursing is very painful for her, so she turns away from her babies. Or the 
mother may be sick herself — perhaps wiped out from a difficult birth or some-
thing more serious that you don’t know about. Or maybe she’s just a nervous 
first-timer and doesn’t want to or doesn’t know how to take on a newborn.

513
 Chapter 4: Providing Medical Attention
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
Sometimes the baby is the one that doesn’t take to the mother. The little one 
may be too weak or too cold to get up and nurse. Or the baby may have a 
cleft palate or other abnormality that prevents it from nursing. Sometimes, 
the baby simply doesn’t learn the suckle reflex and thus isn’t taking to the 
usual form of nursing. (In horses, this baby is called a dummy foal.)
Whatever the reason, rejection does happen, and you’re left with a baby 
that isn’t going to make it on its own and isn’t going to get any help from the 
mother. The next section explains how to raise the little one yourself.
The future of orphans or rejected babies
Mothers can die in childbirth or shortly afterward from non-birth-related 
accidents, leaving you with a newborn that needs constant attention if it’s to 
have a chance in life. Or you may have an infant that for some reason isn’t 
able to nurse from its mother.
Either way, if you plan on raising this newborn, you have to have the right 
facilities and the time to devote to a very needy creature that must be kept 
warm and fed at regular intervals throughout the day and night. Although 
raising an orphan requires a huge commitment of time and patience, it can be 
very rewarding and the only reasonable choice for those who reject the alter-
native — letting the baby die.
The bad news is that animals without a mother of the same species can be 
robbed of natural immunities and thus grow up to be less hardy. The first 
12 to 24 hours of an animal’s life are critical for several reasons. Besides 
the obvious reasons of feeding and protection, this time is when the mother 
produces colostrum — a thickened, antibody-rich milk that’s important for 
giving the baby a natural immunity. The mother actually can produce colos-
trum for a couple of days after birth, but the baby can absorb it only during 
these first hours.
 
If babies do get colostrum from their mothers during the critical first hours 
of their lives, they’re blessed with a passive immunity, meaning they’re more 
apt to fend off minor and common illnesses. This immunity from their moth-
er’s milk tides them over until their bodies can produce their own immuni-
ties. After the important absorption of colostrum, a baby can be successfully 
raised by a member of another species — like you! Without it, the little one’s 
immune system is compromised, and the baby is susceptible to all manner of 
infections.
Birth defects
Animals can be born with any number of birth defects. Some mean the crit-
ter can’t possibly survive; some mean it’s handicapped but still able to live a 
decent life; and some mean the baby just needs a little help. Common birth 
defects include

514
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
 Cleft palates: An animal with this condition can’t successfully nurse and 
instead inhales milk when it tries to suckle, causing a condition called 
inhalation pneumonia. Only surgery can fix a cleft palate.
 
 Umbilical hernias: An animal with an umbilical hernia has a hole in its 
abdominal wall because its skin didn’t close correctly over the umbilical 
cord. Some smaller openings can close up on their own, but if they’re 
bigger than the size of a quarter, they need veterinary attention.
Some less-common birth defects include two heads, multiple limbs, or a miss-
ing anus. Many other defects are possible, and if you experience one, you 
must consult a vet to determine whether the animal has a chance of survival.
Deciding to give a newborn up
Sometimes on a farm, you’re forced to make tough decisions that you 
wouldn’t have to make if the animal were your only cherished pet. If you want 
a successful farm, however, you have to let some of your animals go. Here are 
some reasons you may not be able to keep your little ones:
 
 You simply own too many animals. If you allow animals to breed, your 
flock or herd is going to grow, and there may come a time when you 
reach the limit of what your acreage can handle. Thus, you simply can’t 
feed or accommodate all the new babies.
 
 Animals can grow up to be too aggressive. Keeping an aggressive animal 
on your farm may negatively affect your other critters and your financial 
and time investments in them.
 
 A baby just isn’t responding to all the help and love you’re lavishing 
upon it.
Ideally, you can find a good home for the young ones that are placeable. But 
in many instances, an animal that didn’t do anything wrong may have to face 
a less favorable fate. Making the decision to send an animal to the butcher or 
to adopt it out to another farm is especially hard when it’s one you nurtured 
from birth.

Chapter 5
Beginning Beekeeping
In This Chapter
 Deciding what equipment and tools to get
 Getting your bees and setting up house
 Caring for your bees throughout the year
S
ince becoming a backyard beekeeper, I’ve grown to deeply admire the 
remarkable qualities of bees. As a gardener, I’ve witnessed firsthand the 
dramatic contribution they make to plants of all kinds. With honeybees in my 
garden, its bounty has increased by leaps and bounds. And then there’s that 
wonderful bonus that the honeybees generously give me: a yearly harvest of 
sweet liquid gold.
Bees are simply wonderful little creatures. Interacting with them is an honor 
and a privilege. People who love nature in its purest form will love bees and 
beekeeping. In this chapter, you find out everything you need to know to 
begin your adventure keeping bees.
Evaluating Your Beekeeping Potential
Why has mankind been so interested in beekeeping over the centuries? I’m 
sure the first motivator was honey. After all, for many years and long before 
cane sugar, honey was the primary sweetener in use. But the sweet reward 
is by no means the only reason folks are attracted to beekeeping. For a long 
time, agriculture has recognized the value of pollination by bees. Without 
the bees’ help, many commercial crops would suffer serious consequences. 
Even backyard beekeepers witness dramatic improvements in their gardens’ 
yields: more and larger fruits, flowers, and vegetables. A hive or two in the 
garden makes a big difference in your success as a gardener.

516
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
But not everyone is cut out to be a beekeeper. The question you need to ask 
yourself is, “Are you someone who’d make a good beekeeper?” Here are some 
things to consider in your answer:
 
 Climate: Unless you live on a glacier or on the frozen tundra of Siberia, 
your climate is probably suitable for beekeeping. Bees are remarkable 
creatures that do just fine in a wide range of climates.
 
 Space requirements: You don’t need much space to keep bees. 
Although bees travel miles from the hive to gather pollen and nectar, 
foraging an area as large as 6,000 acres, you need only enough space to 
accommodate the hive itself.
 
 Zoning and legal restrictions: Most communities are quite tolerant of 
beekeepers, but some have local ordinances that prohibit beekeeping 
or restrict the number of hives that you can have. Check with your town 
hall, local zoning board, or state agricultural experiment station to find 
out what’s allowed in your neighborhood.
 
 Costs and equipment: Figure on investing about $200 to $400 for the 
hive, equipment, tools, and medication. In addition, you’ll spend $50 to 
$70 for a package of bees and a queen.
 
 Time and commitment: Beekeeping isn’t labor intensive. Other than 
your first year (when it’s a good idea to inspect the hive frequently to 
find out more about your bees), you need to make only five or six visits 
to your hives every year. Add to that the time you spend harvesting 
honey, repairing equipment, and putting things away for the season, and 
you’ll probably devote 19 to 28 hours a year to your hobby (more if you 
make a business out of it).
 
 Allergies: A fact of life as a beekeeper is that you’re going to get stung 
once in a while. If you’re uncertain about whether you’re allergic or not, 
or whether your allergy to bees is severe, check with an allergist, who 
can determine whether you’re among the relatively few who should 
steer clear of beekeeping.
Being part of the bigger picture: Save the bees!
The facts that keeping a hive in the backyard 
dramatically improves pollination and rewards 
you with a delicious honey harvest are, by 
themselves, good enough reasons to keep 
bees. But today, the value of keeping bees goes 
beyond the obvious. In many areas, millions of 
colonies of wild (or feral) honeybees have been 
wiped out by urbanization, pesticides, and 
parasitic mites, devastating the wild honeybee 
population. This is why gardeners report seeing 
fewer and fewer honeybees in their gardens. 
Backyard beekeeping has become vital in our 
efforts to reestablish lost colonies of bees and 
offset the natural decrease in pollination by 
wild bees.

Bee Basics
Beekeepers really love their bees. That may sound weird to you if you aren’t 
a beekeeper (yet!), but virtually everyone who keeps bees will tell you the 
same thing and speak with deep warmth about “their girls” (the majority of 
the bees in a hive are female — see the next section). Backyard beekeepers 
grow to deeply admire the remarkable qualities of these endearing creatures. 
Once you get to know more about bees’ value and remarkable social skills, 
you’ll fall in love with them too.
The three bee castes
Although you may think that all bees look exactly alike, actually three dif-
ferent castes make up the total population in any hive: worker, drone, and 
queen. Shown in Figure 5-1, each has its own characteristics, roles, and 
responsibilities. Upon closer examination, the three types even look a little 
different, and being able to distinguish one from another is important.
 
Figure 5-1: 
The three 
castes of 
honeybees: 
worker, 
drone, and 
queen.

Queen
Her majesty, the queen
The queen bee, shown in the center of Figure 5-2, is the heart and soul of the 
colony. Only one queen lives in a given hive. She is the largest bee in the colony, 
and she is the only female with fully developed ovaries. The queen’s two pri-
mary purposes are to produce chemical scents that help regulate the unity of 
the colony and to lay eggs — lots of them. She is, in fact, an egg-laying machine, 
capable of producing more than 1,500 eggs a day at 30-second intervals.

518
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
The queen is the reason for nearly everything the rest of the colony does. 
She’s the only bee without which the rest of the colony cannot survive. A 
good quality queen means a strong and productive hive.

The industrious little worker bee
The majority of the hive’s population consists of worker bees. Although 
females, worker bees lack fully developed ovaries. Worker bees do a consid-
erable amount of work. In fact, during the busy season, they literally work 
themselves to death. The specific jobs and duties they perform during their 
short lives vary as they age. Initially, a worker’s responsibilities include 
various tasks within the hive. At this stage of development, worker bees are 
referred to as house bees, and they perform tasks associated with the health 
and upkeep of the hive itself. As they get older, their duties involve work out-
side of the hive as field bees. During this period, the worker leaves the hive to 
forage for pollen, nectar, and water.
The woeful drone
Drones, the only male bees in the colony, make up a relatively small percent-
age of the hive’s total population. Drones have no other responsibility than to 
hang around because they may be needed to mate with a new virgin queen. 

519
 Chapter 5: Beginning Beekeeping
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
They don’t forage for food from flowers — they have no pollen baskets. They 
don’t help with the building of comb — they have no wax-producing glands. 
Nor can they help defend the hive — they have no stingers and can be han-
dled by the beekeeper with absolute confidence.
When the weather gets cooler and the mating season comes to a close, the 
worker bees systematically expel the drones from the hive. This is your 
signal that the beekeeping season is over for the year.
The honeybee life cycle
Honeybees develop in four distinct phases: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The 
total development time varies a bit among the three castes of bees — 16 days 
for queens, 21 days for worker bees, and 24 days for drones — but the basic, 
miraculous process is the same.
 
1. Egg: The queen lays a single egg in each cell that has been cleaned 
and prepared by the workers to raise new brood. Spotting these eggs 
is one of the most basic and important skills you need to develop as a 
beekeeper. It isn’t an easy task, because the eggs are mighty tiny (only 
about 1.7 millemeters long), as you can see in Figure 5-3. But finding eggs 
is one of the surest ways to confirm that your queen is alive and well. It’s 
a skill you’ll use just about every time you visit your hive.

rice-like 
shape of 
the eggs 
and how the 
queen has

2. Larva: Three days after the queen lays the egg, it hatches into a larva 
(the plural is larvae). Healthy larvae are snowy white and resemble 
small grubs curled up in the cells. Tiny at first, the larvae grow quickly, 
shedding their skin five times. Within just five days, they’re 1,570 times 

520
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
larger than their original size. At this time, the worker bees seal the 
larvae in the cell with a porous capping of tan beeswax. Once sealed in, 
the larvae spin a cocoon around their bodies.
 
3. Pupa: When it’s enclosed in the spun cocoon, the larva is officially a 
pupa (the plural is pupae). The transformations that take place now are 
hidden from sight under the wax cappings. But if you could, you’d see 
that this little creature is beginning to take on the familiar features of an 
adult bee. After 12 days, the now-adult bee chews her way through the 
wax capping to join her sisters and brothers.
Basic Equipment for Beekeepers
To become a beekeeper, you need some supplies — namely, a hive and a 
few essential pieces of equipment. You can buy these pieces separately, 
but I recommend buying a basic start-up kit. Many suppliers offer them, 
and they’re priced to save a few bucks. Make certain that your kit contains 
these basic items:
 
 Bottom board
 
 Lower and upper deep
 
 Honey super
 
 Inner and outer covers
 
 Frames and foundation for both deeps and the honey super
 
 Hardware to assemble stuff (various size nails, foundation pins, and so on)
 
 Veil and gloves
 
 Smoker
 
 Hive tool
The following sections explain these and other beekeeping paraphernalia you 
may find helpful.
The hive and its parts
Woodenware refers to the various components that collectively result in 
the beehive. Traditionally these components are made of wood — thus the 
term — but some manufacturers offer synthetic versions of these same 
components (plastic, polystyrene, and so on). My advice: Get the wood. 
The bees accept it far more readily than synthetic versions. And the smell 
and feel of wood are much more pleasurable to work with.

521
 Chapter 5: Beginning Beekeeping
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
 
Many different kinds and sizes of beehives are available, but worldwide, the 
most common is the 10-frame Langstroth hive. Invented in 1851, its design 
hasn’t changed much in the last 150 years, which is a testament to its prac-
ticality. I strongly recommend that you choose a Langstroth hive. The hive 
parts are completely interchangeable, and they’re readily available from any 
beekeeping supply vendor.
This section discusses, bottom to top, the various components of a modern 
Langstroth beehive. As you read this section, refer to Figure 5-4 to see what 
the various parts look like and where they’re located within the structure of 
the hive. The assembly instructions that come with the hive explain how to 
put the whole thing together.
 
 Hive stand: The entire hive sits on a hive stand, which elevates the hive 
off the ground, improving circulation and minimizing dampness. The 
best ones are made of cypress wood, which is highly resistant to rot.
 
 Bottom board: The bottom board is the thick bottom floor of the bee-
hive. Like the hive stand, the best bottom boards are made of cypress 
wood.
 
 Entrance reducer: When you order a bottom board, it comes with a 
notched wooden cleat. The cleat serves as your entrance reducer, which 
limits bee access to the hive and controls ventilation and temperature 
during cooler months.
 
 Beekeepers use the entrance reducer only for newly established hives 
or during cold weather. This is the reason the entrance reducer isn’t 
shown in Figure 5-4. For established hives in warm weather, the entrance 
reducer isn’t used at all.
 
 Deep-hive body: The deep-hive body contains ten frames of honey-
comb. The best quality ones are made of clear pine or cypress and have 
crisply cut dovetail joints for added strength. You’ll need two deep-hive 
bodies to stack one on top of the other, like a two-story condo. The bees 
use the lower deep as the nursery, or brood chamber, to raise thousands 
of baby bees. The bees use the upper deep as the pantry or food cham-
ber, where they store most of the honey and pollen for their use.
 
 Queen excluder: If you plan to collect honey, you should use a queen 
excluder, which you place between the deep food chamber and the 
shallow honey supers. The queen excluder consists of either a wooden 
frame holding a grid of metal wire or a perforated sheet of plastic. As the 
name implies, this gizmo prevents the queen from spoiling the clarity of 
the honey by entering the honey super and laying eggs. (When you’re 
not collecting honey, it should not be used.)

 Shallow honey super: You use shallow honey supers to collect surplus 
honey — your honey. The honey that’s in the deep-hive body you need 
to leave for the bees. Supers are identical in design to the deep-hive 
bodies — and assemble in a similar manner — but supers are shallower 
and therefore weigh less, making them easy to handle during the honey 
harvest.
 
 Frames: Ten deep frames are used in each deep-hive body, and nine 
shallow frames usually are used in each shallow honey super. Each 
wooden frame contains a single sheet of beeswax foundation (described 
in the next bullet). The frame firmly holds the wax and enables you to 
remove these panels of honeycomb for inspection or honey extraction.
 
 Foundation: Foundation comes in two forms: plastic and beeswax. 
Although plastic foundation has some advantages, bees are slow to 
accept plastic, and I don’t recommend it for the new beekeeper. Instead, 
purchase foundation made from pure beeswax. Beeswax foundation is 
vertically wired for strength, and imprinted with a hexagonal cell pattern 
that guides the bees as they draw out uniform, even combs. Your bees 
find the sweet smell of beeswax foundation irresistible and quickly draw 
out each sheet into 7,000 beautiful, uniform cells (3,500 cells on each 
side) where they can store their food, raise brood, and collect honey for 
you! Like frames, foundation comes in deep and shallow sizes — deep 
for the deep-hive bodies and shallow for the shallow supers.
 
 Inner cover: The best quality inner covers are made entirely of cypress 
wood. Budget models made from pressboard or Masonite also are avail-
able, but they don’t seem to last as long. The basic design consists of a 
wooden frame that houses flat planks of wood. In the center is a precut 
oval hole. When assembled, the inner cover resembles a shallow tray 
(with a hole in the center). A notch is cut out of one of the lengths of 
frame. This ventilation notch is positioned to the front of the hive. The 
inner cover is placed on the hive with the “tray” side facing up.
 
 Outer cover: Look for cypress wood when buying an outer cover. 
Cypress resists rot and lasts the longest. Outer covers assemble in a 
manner similar to the inner cover: a frame containing flat planks of 
wood. But the outer cover has a galvanized steel tray that fits on the 
top, protecting it from the elements.
 
You must have a means for feeding your bees once they’re in the hive. I 
strongly recommend using a good quality hive-top feeder. Alternatively, you 
can use a feeding pail.

524
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
An assortment of beekeeping tools
As a beekeeper, you’ll find that you use a variety of tools. Two tools — the 
smoker and the hive tool — are a must for the beekeeper. You’ll use them 
every time you visit the hive. In addition to these two items, you’ll also need 
protective clothing when visiting the hive: a long-sleeved, light-colored shirt 
(bees don’t like dark colors) and long pants tucked into slip-on boots, a veil, 
and, when necessary, gloves. Other gadgets, gizmos, and doodads are also 
available to the beekeeper. This section describes my favorites.
Smoker
The smoker will become your best friend. Smoke calms the bees and enables 
you to safely inspect your hive. Quite simply, the smoker is a fire chamber 
with bellows designed to produce lots of cool smoke. Smokers come in all 
shapes, sizes, and price ranges. The style that you choose doesn’t really 
matter. Learn how to light it so that it stays lit, and never overdo the smoking 
process. A little smoke goes a long way.
Hive tool
The versatility of the simple hive tool is impressive. Don’t visit your hives 
without it! Use it to scrape wax and propolis off woodenware, loosen hive 
parts, open the hive, and manipulate frames. You can choose from various 
models (see Figure 5-5).
 
Figure 5-5: 
Two 
varieties of 
hive tools.
 
Veils and gloves
Don’t ever visit your hive without wearing a veil. Although your bees are 
likely to be gentle (especially during your first season), it defies common 
sense to put yourself at risk. Veils come in many different models and price 

525
 Chapter 5: Beginning Beekeeping
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
ranges. Some are simple veils that slip over your head; others are integral to 
a pullover blouse or even a full jumpsuit. Pick the style that appeals most to 
you. If your colony tends to be more aggressive, more protection is advised. 
But remember, the more you wear, the hotter you’ll be during summer 
inspections.
While a veil is necessary, gloves are less critical. New beekeepers like the idea 
of using gloves, but I urge you not to use them for installing your bees or for 
routine inspections. You don’t really need them at those times — especially 
with a new colony or early in the season — and they just make you clumsier. 
The only times that you need gloves are
 
 Late in the season (when your colony is at its strongest).
 
 During honey harvest season (when your bees are protective of their 
honey).
 
 When moving hive bodies (when you have a great deal of heavy work to 
do in a short period of time).
Elevated hive stand
Elevated stands eliminate the need for bending (good for you) and deter 
skunks from snacking on your bees (good for the bees). The simplest ele-
vated stands are made from four 14-inch lengths of two-by-four (use these for 
the legs) and a single plank of plywood that is large enough to hold the hive 
(see Figure 5-6). Put the entire hive on top of the elevated stand, raising it a 
little more than 14 inches off the ground. Alternatively, fashion an elevated 
stand from a few cinderblocks or use posts of various sorts.

stand to

Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Bee brush
The long, super-soft bristles of a bee brush enable you to remove bees from 
frames and clothing without hurting them. Some beekeepers use a goose 
feather for this purpose. Keep that in mind in the event you have an extra 
goose around the house.
Getting Your Initial Bee Colony
You’ll need some bees if you’re going to be a beekeeper. But what kind do you 
get when you can choose from many different races and hybrids of honeybees, 
each with its own advantages and disadvantages? As a beginning beekeeper, 
your best bet is to start with the Italian honeybee. It’s the number-one choice 
in the world for good reasons: The Italian honeybee is gentle, productive, and 
does well in many different climates. Look no further in your first year.
When it comes to obtaining your bees, you have a couple of options: You can 
order a package of bees, which will come to you via the mail; or you can get a 
colony already started by a local beekeeper. The following sections describe 
these options in more detail.
Ordering package bees
One of your best options and by far the most popular way to start a new hive 
is to order package bees. You can order bees by the pound from a reputable 
supplier. Bee breeders are found mostly in the southern states and will ship 
just about anywhere in the continental United States.
A package of bees and a single queen are shipped in a small wooden box with 
two screened sides (see Figure 5-7). The bee package is about the size of a 
large shoebox and includes a small screened cage for the queen (about the 
size of a matchbook) and a tin can of sugar syrup that feeds the bees during 
their journey. A 3-pound package of bees contains about 11,000 bees, the 
ideal size for you to order. Order one package of bees for each hive you plan 
to start.
 
Be sure to order a marked queen with the package. Marked means that a 
small colored dot has been painted on her thorax. This dot helps you spot 
the queen in your hive during inspections. It also confirms that the queen 
you see is the one that you installed (versus discovering an unmarked one, 
which means your queen is gone and another has taken her place).

When ordering package bees, time your order so that you receive your bees 
as early in the spring as the weather allows. This gives your colony time to 
build its numbers for the summer “honey flow” and means your bees are 
available for early pollination.
Buying a “nuc” colony
Another good option for the new beekeeper is to find a local beekeeper who 
can sell you a nucleus (or nuc) colony of bees. A nuc consists of four to five 
frames of brood and bees, plus an actively laying queen. All you do is transfer 
the frames (bees and all) from the nuc box into your own hive. To find a sup-
plier in your neck of the woods, check your yellow pages under “beekeeping,” 
call your state’s bee inspector, or ask members of a local beekeeping club or 
association.
 
Look for a reputable dealer with a good track record for providing healthy, 
disease-free bees. Ask whether the state bee inspector inspects the establish-
ment annually. Request a copy of a certificate of health from the state. If you 
can find a reputable beekeeper with nucs, this is a convenient way to start a 
hive and quickly build up a strong colony.

528
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Welcoming Your Bees to Their New Home
Before your bees arrive, you need to order and assemble the components 
that will become their new home. Get together all your hive parts (wooden-
ware) and the instruction sheets that come with them, and then assemble the 
equipment from the ground up. When you have the hive built, you can turn 
your attention to the arrival of your girls.
 
You may not know the exact day that your bees will arrive, but many suppli-
ers at least let you know the approximate day they plan to ship your package 
bees. About a week before the anticipated date of arrival, alert your local 
post office that you’re expecting bees. Make sure that you provide the post 
office with your telephone number so you can be reached the moment your 
bees come in. In most communities, the post office asks that you pick up 
your bees at the post office. Seldom are bees delivered live right to your 
door. Instruct the post office that the package needs to be kept in a cool, dark 
place until you arrive.
Bringing home your bees
When the bees finally arrive, head to the post office to pick them up and then 
follow these steps:
 
1. Inspect the package closely.
 
 Finding some dead bees on the bottom of the package is normal. If you 
find an inch or more of dead bees on the bottom of the package, how-
ever, fill out a form at the post office and call your vendor, who should 
replace your bees.
 
2. Take your bees home right away (but don’t put them in the hot, stuffy 
trunk of your car).
Capturing a wild swarm of bees
Here’s an option where the price is right: 
Swarms are free. But I don’t recommend cap-
turing a swarm of wild bees for the first-year 
beekeeper. Capturing a wild swarm is a bit 
tricky for someone who has never handled 
bees. And you can’t be sure of the health, 
genetics, and temperament of a wild swarm. In 
some areas (mostly the southern United States) 
you face the possibility that the swarm you 
attempt to capture may be Africanized bees, a 
very aggressive and easily agitated bee hybrid 
that resulted from attempts in the mid-twentieth 
century to improve honey production by cross-
ing African bees with honeybees. My advice? 
Save this adventure for year two.

529

3. When you get home, spray the package liberally with cool water using 
a clean mister or spray bottle.
 
4. Place the package of bees in a cool place, such as your basement or 
garage, for an hour.
 
5. After the hour has passed, spray the package of bees with basic sugar 
syrup (see the section “Recipes for Sugar Syrups”).
 
 Don’t brush syrup on the screen; doing so literally brushes off many little 
bee feet in the process.
Putting your bees into the hive
Putting your bees into their new home is the fun stuff. Take your time and 
enjoy the experience. You’ll find that the bees are docile and cooperative. 
Read the instructions in this section several times until you become familiar 
and comfortable with the steps.
If at all possible, hive your bees either in the late afternoon on the day that 
you pick them up or the next afternoon. Pick a clear, mild day with little or no 
wind. If it’s raining or cold, wait a day. If you absolutely must, you can wait 
several days to put them in the hive, but make certain that you spray them 
two or three times a day with sugar syrup.
To hive your bees, follow these steps:
 
1. Thirty minutes before hiving, spray your bees rather heavily with 
basic medicated sugar syrup (see the later section for the recipe).
 
 Don’t go so far as to drown them with syrup. Use common sense, and 
they’ll be fine.
 
2. Using your hive tool, pry the wood cover off the package.
 
 Pull the nails or staples out of the cover, and keep the wood cover handy.
 
3. Jar the package down sharply on its bottom so that your bees fall to 
the bottom of the package.
 
 This jarring doesn’t hurt them!
 
4. Remove the can of syrup and the queen cage from the package, and 
loosely replace the wood cover (without the staples); examine the 
queen in the queen cage.
 
 She’s in there with a few attendants. Is she okay? In rare cases, she may 
have died in transit. If that’s the case, go ahead with the installation as 
if everything were okay, but call your supplier to order a replacement 
queen (there should be no charge). Your colony will be fine while you 
wait for your replacement queen.

530
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
5. Slide the metal disc on the queen cage to the side slowly.
 
 Remove the cork at one end of the cage so that you can see the white 
candy in the hole. If the candy is present, remove the disc completely. If 
the candy is missing, you can plug the hole with a small piece of marsh-
mallow. If your package comes with a strip of Apistan (designed to con-
trol mites during shipment), remove it from the back of the queen cage.
 
6. Out of two small frame nails bent at right angles, fashion a hanging 
bracket for the queen cage (see Figure 5-8).
 
7. Spray your bees again, and jar the package down so the bees drop to 
the bottom.
 
8. Prepare the hive by removing five of the frames, but keep them nearby.
 
 At this point you’re using only the lower deep-hive body for your bees.
 
9. Hang the queen cage (candy side up) between the center-most frame 
and the next frame facing toward the center (see Figure 5-9).
 
 The screen side of the cage needs to face toward the center of the hive.
 
10. Spray your bees liberally with syrup one last time; then jar the pack-
age down.
 
11. Toss away the wood cover and then pour (and shake) approximately 
half of the bees directly above the hanging queen cage. Pour (and 
shake) the remaining bees into the open area created by the missing 
five frames.
 
12. When the bees disperse a bit, gently replace four of the five frames.
 
 Do this gingerly so you don’t crush any bees. If the pile of bees is too 
deep, use your hand (with gloves on) to disperse the bees.
 
13. If you’re using a jar or pail for feeding (and not a hive-top feeder), 
place the inner cover on the hive; then, invert a one-gallon feeding 
pail above the oval hole in the inner cover, add a second deep super 
on top of the inner cover, and fill the cavity around the jar with crum-
pled newspaper for insulation.
 
 The inner cover is used only when a jar or pail is used for feeding. If 
you’re using a hive-top feeder, you place it in direct contact with the bees 
without the inner cover in between, so skip this step and go to Step 14.
 
14. If you’re using a hive-top feeder, place it on top of the hive; otherwise, 
go to Step 15.
 
15. Plug the inner cover’s half-moon ventilation hole with a clump of grass.
 
 You want to close off this entrance until the bees become established in 
their new home.
 
16. Now place the outer cover on top of the hive. You’re almost done.
 
17. Insert your entrance reducer, leaving a one-finger opening for the 
bees to defend.

531
 Chapter 5: Beginning Beekeeping

 Leave the opening in this manner until the bees build up their numbers 
and can defend a larger hive entrance against intruders, which takes 
about four weeks. If you don’t have an entrance reducer, use grass to 
close up all but an inch or two of the entrance.

 Place the entrance reducer so that the openings face up. Doing so allows 
the bees to climb up over any dead bees that may otherwise clog the 
small entrance.

Your new colony’s first eight weeks
For the newly hived colony, some specific beekeeping tasks are unique to the 
first few weeks. The following sections outline what specific things to look for 
during the initial eight weeks. As you perform these inspections, remember to
 
 Choose the right time for the inspection. Choose a mild, sunny day 
(55 degrees Fahrenheit or more) with little or no wind. Always visit your 
hive sometime between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.
 
 Use the proper inspection procedure. Smoke, open the hive, and 
remove frames one by one for inspection, working your way toward the 
center of the hive.
 
 For more information on this procedure, see the section “Smoker,” ear-
lier in this chapter, and the upcoming section “Inspecting Your Hive.”
 
 Check to make sure your hive-top feeder has enough sugar syrup, and 
replenish it as needed. You can find the recipe for sugar syrup in the 
later section, “Recipes for Sugar Syrups.” Just pour it into the feeder.
 
After putting your package of bees in the hive, you’ll be impatient to look 
inside to see what’s happening. Resist the temptation! You must wait one full 
week before opening the hive. The colony needs this first uninterrupted week 
to accept its new queen. Any premature disturbance to the hive can result 
in the colony rejecting her. The colony may even kill her, thinking the distur-
bance is somehow her fault.
Looking in: A week after hiving your bees
After the first week, you can conduct your first inspection. What are you 
looking for? The queen. You want to know that she’s been released and is 
laying eggs.
 
 To inspect the frames: Smoke and open your hive, and remove the first 
frame. Place it vertically on the ground, leaning it against the hive. Other 
than a few occasional bees, not much will be happening on this frame 
because, in all likelihood, the bees haven’t moved much beyond the 
center of the hive and therefore haven’t had time to draw the outer part 
of the foundation into honeycomb yet. As you continue your inspection 
of each subsequent frame, though, you should begin to see more and 
more going on. Toward the center of the hive you should see that the 
girls have been busily drawing out the wax foundation into honeycomb.
 
 To verify that the queen was released: When you reach the two frames 
sandwiching the queen cage, look down in the hole where the candy 
plug was. If the candy is gone, that’s wonderful! It means worker bees 
have opened the cage and released the queen. Remove the cage and 
peek inside to confirm that the queen has been released. Place the cage 
near the entrance so that any worker bees you find exploring in the cage 
can find their way back into the hive.

534
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
 To remove any burr comb: You’re likely to find that industrious bees 
have built lots of burr comb (sometimes called natural comb, wild comb, 
or brace comb) in the gap created by the queen cage. To remove this 
bright white comb of perfectly symmetrical cells, use your hive tool: 
Sever the burr comb where it’s connected to the frames and then slowly 
lift it straight up and out of the hive. You’ll probably find it covered with 
bees. If the queen is on the comb, gently remove her from the comb 
and place her back into the hive. To remove the other bees, shake them 
loose with sharp downward motions that you halt abruptly just above 
the frames.
 
 To look for eggs: Take a close look at the frames that were near the 
queen cage for evidence that the queen has laid eggs. If you see some, 
you know the queen is already at work.
 
 If you don’t find the queen or any eggs, you may have a problem. Wait 
another few days and check again. If you still find no evidence of the 
queen, you need to order a new queen from your bee supplier.
After this initial inspection, close things up, and leave the bees alone for 
another week. Then replace the tenth frame (the one that you removed when 
you originally hived your package), which now becomes your wall frame.
The second week
During this inspection, you want to determine how well the queen is perform-
ing. As always, look for eggs, your ongoing assurance that the queen is in resi-
dence. Note that the bees have drawn more of the foundation into honeycomb. 
They work from the center outward, so the outer five to six frames probably 
haven’t been drawn out yet. That’s normal.
By the second week, you can easily see larvae in various stages of develop-
ment (see Figure 5-10). They should be bright white and glistening like snowy 
white shrimp!
To evaluate your queen, estimate how many eggs her majesty is laying. If you 
have one or two frames with both sides 3/4-filled with eggs and larvae, your 
queen is doing a fantastic job. Congratulations! If you have one or two frames 
with only one side filled, she’s doing moderately well. If you find fewer than 
that, she’s doing poorly, and you need to consider replacing her as soon as 
possible.
The third week
Again, you’re evaluating the queen’s performance, so look for eggs. By now, 
you’ll also begin seeing capped brood — the final stage of the bees’ metamor-
phosis. Capped brood are tan in color, with brood cappings on older comb 
being darker. The capped brood are located on frames that are closest to the 
center of the hive. Cells with eggs and larvae are on the adjacent frames. Above 
each, you’ll notice a crescent of pollen and, above the crescent of pollen, a 
crescent of nectar or capped honey. This is a picture-perfect situation.

A spotty and loose brood pattern may be evidence of a problem. You may 
have a poor queen, in which case she should be replaced as soon as possible. 
Sunken or perforated brood cappings may be evidence of disease, in which 
case you must diagnose the cause and take steps to medicate.
The third week also is when you need to start looking for queen cells. Queen 
cells can appear in two places: on the upper two-thirds of the frame or on the 
lower third of the frame (see Figure 5-11). When they’re on the upper two-
thirds of the frame, they’re supersedure cells. Bees create supersedure cells if 
they believe their queen isn’t performing up-to-par and needs to be replaced. 
The bees create swarm cells on the lower third of the frame to raise a new 
queen in preparation for the act of swarming, which usually happens when 
the hive becomes too crowded and the colony decides to split in half — with 
half the population leaving the hive (swarming) with the old queen and the 
remaining half staying behind with the makings for a new queen (one of those 
developing in a swarm cell). Note: Swarming seldom is a problem with a new 
hive this early in the season.
 
If you spot more than three to four supersedure cells, you need to order a 
new queen because giving the bees a new queen is far better than letting 
them create their own. Furthermore, you’ll lose less time and guarantee a 
desirable lineage.

The fourth week
Perform your inspection as always, looking for evidence of the queen (eggs) 
and a good pattern of capped brood, pollen, and capped honey.
If all’s well, by the end of the fourth week the bees have drawn nearly all the 
foundation into comb. They’ve added wax to the foundation, creating the 
comb cells in which they store pollen, honey, and brood. When seven of the 
ten frames are drawn into comb, you want to add your second deep-hive 
body. To do so, smoke your hive as usual and then follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the outer cover and the hive-top feeder (or the inner cover, if 
one is being used).
 
2. Place the second deep directly on top of the original hive body and 
fill the new second story with ten frames and foundation.
 
3. Put the hive-top feeder directly on top of the new upper deep and 
below the outer cover, replenishing sugar syrup if needed.
 
4. Replace the outer cover.
The upper deep will be used during the early summer for raising brood. But 
later on it serves as the food chamber for storing honey and pollen for the 
upcoming winter season.
 
Timing is important. If you wait too long, the colony may grow too fast (with 
up to 2,000 new bees emerging every day!), become overcrowded, and even-
tually swarm. If you add the second deep-hive body too early, the colony 
below loses heat, and the brood may become chilled and die.

The fifth through eighth weeks
By the fifth week the frames should be jam-packed with eggs, larvae, capped 
brood, pollen, and honey. Watch for movement under the capping. New bees 
will chew their way out of the cell and crawl out.
Following are the other tasks you’ll perform during these weeks:
 
 Improve ventilation: At week five or six, when the weather is milder and 
the colony is robust enough to protect itself, you need to improve hive 
ventilation by opening the hive entrance. Turn the entrance reducer so 
that the larger of its two openings (the one that’s about 4 inches wide) 
is in position. You can remove the entrance reducer completely in the 
eighth week following the installation of your bees.
 
 Watch for swarm cells: During weeks six through eight, be on the 
lookout for swarm cells in the lower third of the frames. When you find 
eight or more of these swarm cells, you can be fairly certain the colony 
intends to swarm. (Note: Continue to look for supersedure cells as well.) 
Refer to the section, “The third week,” for an explanation of supersedure 
and swarm cells.
 
 Manipulate the frames of foundation: By week seven or eight, manipu-
late the order of frames to encourage the bees to draw out more foun-
dation into comb cells. To do this, place any frames of foundation that 
haven’t been drawn between frames of newly drawn comb. Don’t place 
these frames smack in the middle of the brood nest, though, because 
doing so splits (or breaks) the nest apart, making it difficult for bees to 
regulate the environment of the temperature-sensitive brood.
Inspecting Your Hive
Virtually all inspections are to determine the health and productivity of the 
colony. The specifics of what you’re looking for vary somewhat, depending 
upon the time of year. But some universal rules-of-the-road apply to every 
hive visit.
 
 Check for your queen. Look for indications that the queen is alive and 
well and laying eggs. If you actually see her, that’s great and reassur-
ing! But finding the queen becomes increasingly difficult as the colony 
becomes larger and more crowded. When that happens, look for eggs. 
Although they’re tiny, finding the eggs is much easier than locating a 
single queen in a hive of 60,000 bees. Refer to Figures 5-3 and 5-10 to see 
what eggs look like.

538
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
 Look for food and brood. Each deep frame of comb contains about 
7,000 cells (3,500 on each side). Honeybees use these cells for storing 
food and raising brood. When you inspect your colony, note what’s 
going on in those cells to help you judge the performance and health of 
your bees. Do you see ample pollen and nectar? Are there lots of eggs 
and brood? Does the condition of the wax cappings over the brood look 
normal — or are the cappings perforated and sunken in?
 
 Inspect the brood pattern and brood cappings. A tight, compact brood 
pattern is indicative of a good, healthy queen; a spotty brood pattern 
(many empty cells with only occasional cells of eggs, larvae, or capped 
brood) is an indication that you have an old or sick queen and may need 
to replace her. How does the capped brood look? These are cells that 
the bees have capped with a tan wax. The tan cappings are porous and 
enable the developing larvae within to breathe. The cappings should be 
smooth and slightly convex. Sunken-in (concave) or perforated cappings 
indicate a problem.
So how do you look for all these things? By opening up the hive and taking 
a look. The approach for inspecting your hive doesn’t vary much from one 
visit to another. You always follow certain procedures, as the following sec-
tions explain. After a few visits to the hive, the mechanics of all this become 
second nature, and you can concentrate on enjoying the miraculous discov-
eries that await you.
Removing the first frame
Always begin your inspection of the hive by removing the first frame or wall 
frame. That’s the frame closest to the outer wall. Which wall? It doesn’t 
matter. Pick a side of the hive to work from, and that determines your first 
frame.
 
Removal of the wall frame is a basic and important first step every time you 
inspect a colony. The removal of this frame gives you a wide-open empty 
space in the hive for better manipulating the remaining frames without 
squashing any bees. Always be sure to remove the wall frame from the hive 
before attempting to remove any other frames. Here’s how to proceed:
 
1. Insert the curved end of your hive tool between the first and second 
frames, near one end of the frame’s top bar (see Figure 5-12).
 
2. Twist the tool to separate the frames from each other.
 
 Your hand moves toward the center of the hive — not the end.
 
3. Repeat this motion at the opposite end of the top bar.
 
 The first frame should now be separated from the second frame.

539
 Chapter 5: Beginning Beekeeping
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
 
4. Using both hands, pick up the first frame by the end bars (see 
Figure 5-13).
 
 Gently push any bees out of the way as you get ahold of the end bars. 
With the frame in both hands, slowly lift it straight up and out of the hive. 
Be careful not to roll or crush bees as you lift the frame. Easy does it!

Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
Never put your fingers on a frame without first noting where the bees are, 
because you don’t want to crush any bees, nor do you want to get stung. 
Bees can be easily and safely coaxed away by gently pushing them aside with 
your fingers.
Now that you’ve removed the first frame, gently rest it on the ground, lean-
ing it vertically against the hive. It’s okay if bees are on it. They’ll be fine. 
Alternatively, use a frame rest if you have one.
Working your way through the hive
Using your hive tool, loosen frame two and move it into the open slot where 
frame one used to be. That gives you enough room to remove this frame 
without injuring any bees. When you’re done looking at this frame, return it 
to the hive, close to (but not touching) the wall. Do not put this frame on the 
ground.
Work your way through all ten frames in this manner — moving the next 
frame to be inspected into the open slot. When you’re done looking at a 
frame, always return it snugly against the frame previously inspected. Use 
your eyes to monitor progress as the frames are slowly nudged together.
 
Be careful not to crush any bees when pushing the frames together. One of 
those bees may be the queen! Look down between the frames to make sure the 
coast is clear before slowly pushing the frames together. If bees are on the end 
bars and at risk of being crushed, you can use the flat end of your hive tool 
to gently coax them to move along. A single puff of smoke also urges them to 
move out of the way.
Holding up frames for inspection
To properly hold and inspect each frame, stand with your back to the sun 
and the light shining over your shoulder and onto the frame so that the sun 
can illuminate details deep in the cells and help you to better see eggs and 
small larvae. Here’s an easy way to inspect both sides of the frame (Figure 
5-14 illustrates the following steps):
 
1. Hold the frame firmly by the tabs at either end of the top bar.
 
 Get a good grip. The last thing you want to do is drop a frame covered 
with bees. Their retaliation for your clumsiness will be swift and, no 
doubt, memorable.

541
 Chapter 5: Beginning Beekeeping
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
 
2. Turn the frame vertically; then turn it like a page of a book, then 
return it to the horizontal position.
 
 Now you’re viewing the opposite side of the frame.
 
When inspecting frames, all your movements must be slow and deliberate. 
Change hand positions sparingly. Sliding your fingers across the frames 
as you reposition your hands is better than lifting your fingers and setting 
them down again, because you may land on a bee. As you turn the frame, 
you want to avoid any sudden and unnecessary centrifugal force that may 
disturb the bees.
 
A few minutes into your inspection, you may notice that all the bees have 
lined up between the top bars like racehorses at the starting gate. Their little 
heads are all in a row between the frames. Kind of cute, aren’t they? They’re 
watching you. That’s your signal to give the girls a few more puffs of smoke 
to disperse them again so that you can continue with your inspection.
Replacing frames
After you’ve inspected your last frame, nine frames should be in the hive and 
one (the first frame you removed) leaning against it or hanging on the frame 
rest. To put the first frame back in the hive:
 
1. Slowly push the nine frames that are in the hive as a single unit 
toward the opposite wall of the hive.
 
 That puts them back where they were when you started your inspection. 
Pushing them as a single unit keeps them snugly together and avoids 
crushing bees. You’re now left with the open slot from which the first 
frame was removed.
 
2. Smoke the bees one last time to drive them down into the hive.
 
3. Pick up the frame that’s outside the hive, remove the bees on it if nec-
essary, and ease it back into the empty slot.
 
 If bees are still on it, with a downward thrust, sharply knock one corner 
of the frame on the bottom board at the hive’s entrance. The bees fall off 
the frame and begin walking through the entrance to the hive. With no 
bees remaining on your first frame, you can easily return it to the hive 
without the risk of crushing them.
 
4. Make certain that all ten frames fit snugly together.
 
 Using your hive tool as a wedge, adjust the ten-frame unit so that the 
space between the frames and the two outer walls is equal.

Closing the hive
You’re almost finished. Now it’s time to close the hive.
 
 If you’re using a hive-top feeder, put the feeder back in place immedi-
ately on top of the hive body and, if the pantry is getting low, add more 
sugar syrup. Then replace the outer cover, first making sure it’s free of 
any bees. From the rear of the hive, slide it along the inner cover, again, 
gently pushing any bees out of the way (the bulldozer technique). Ease 
it into place, and adjust it so that it sits firmly and level on the inner 
cover.
 
 If you’re not using a hive-top feeder, remove any bees from the inner 
cover using a downward thrust and sharply knocking one corner of the 
inner cover on the bottom board at the hive’s entrance. Then slide the 
inner cover in position from the rear of the hive so that you don’t crush 
any bees. (Note that the notched ventilation hole is positioned upward 
and toward the front of the hive. This notched opening allows air to cir-
culate and gives bees a top-floor entrance to the hive.) Now replace the 
outer cover.
 
Make sure that the ventilation notch on the outer cover isn’t blocked. From 
the rear of the hive, shove the outer cover toward the front of the hive. Doing 
so opens the notched ventilation hole in the inner cover and gives the bees 
airflow and an alternate entrance.
Chores throughout the Year
This section contains a suggested schedule of seasonal hive activities and 
important tasks for the beekeeper. Note, however, that geography, weather, 
climate, neighborhood, and even the type of bees influence the timing of 
these activities.
Those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer
Nectar flow usually reaches its peak during summer. That’s also when the 
population of the colony usually reaches its peak. When that’s the case, your 
colony is quite self-sufficient, boiling with worker bees tirelessly collecting 
pollen, gathering nectar, and making honey. Note, however, that the queen’s 
rate of egg-laying drops a bit during the late summer.

544
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Late in summer the colony’s growth begins to diminish. Drones are still 
around, but outside activity begins slowing down when the nectar flow slows. 
Bees seem to be restless and become protective of their honey.
Here are some activities you can expect to schedule between trips to the 
beach and backyard barbecues:
 
 Inspect the hive every other week, making sure it’s healthy and that the 
queen is present.
 
 Add honey supers as needed.
 
 Keep up swarm control through mid-summer; late in the summer there’s 
little chance of swarming.
 
 Harvest your honey crop at the end of the nectar flow. Remember that 
the colony requires at least 60 pounds of honey for use during winter.
Falling leaves point to autumn chores
Most nectar and pollen sources become scarce as days become shorter and 
weather cools in autumn. All in all, as the season slows down, so do the activ-
ities within your hive: The queen’s egg-laying is dramatically reduced, drones 
begin to disappear from the hive, and hive population drops significantly. 
Your bees begin bringing in propolis (resin), using it to chink up cracks in the 
hive that may leak the winter’s cold wind. The colony is hunkering down for 
the winter, so you must help your bees get ready. When helping your bees 
prepare for the upcoming hardships of winter months, you must
 
 Inspect your bees (look inside the hive) and make certain that the 
queen is present. If you don’t see the queen herself, be sure to look for 
eggs, not larvae. Larvae can be three to eight days old, so just finding 
larvae is no guarantee that you have a queen.
 
 Determine whether the bees have enough honey. Your bees need 
plenty of food (capped honey) for the winter. Make certain that the 
upper deep-hive body is full of honey. Honey is essential for your bees’ 
survival, because it’s the fuel that stokes their stoves. Without it, they’re 
certain to perish.
 
 In cooler, northern climates, hives need about 60 to 70 pounds of honey 
heading into winter. If your winters are short (or nonexistent), a honey 
reserve of 30 to 40 pounds is sufficient.
 
 Feed and medicate your colony. They’ll accept a two-to-one sugar-
syrup feeding until colder weather contracts them into a tight cluster 
(this is the winter syrup recipe in the later section, “Recipes for Sugar 
Syrups”). At that point, temperatures are too cold for them to leave the 
cluster, so feeding them is useless.

545
 Chapter 5: Beginning Beekeeping
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
 
 Provide adequate ventilation. During winter, the temperature at the 
center of the cluster is maintained at 90 to 93 degrees. Without adequate 
ventilation, the warm air from the cluster rises, hits the cold inner cover, 
and causes condensation to drip down onto the bees as ice-cold water. 
That’s a big problem! The bees will become chilled and die. To keep 
your colony dry, permanently glue four pieces of wood the size of post-
age stamps to the four corners of the inner cover’s flat underside. (You 
can use the thin end of a wood shingle or pieces of a popsicle stick.) 
This neat ventilation trick makes an air space of 1⁄16 inch or less between 
the top edge of the upper deep-hive body and the inner cover.
 
 Wrap the hive in black tar paper (the kind used by roofers, see Figure 
5-15) if you’re in a climate where the temperature gets below freez-
ing for more than several weeks. Make sure that you don’t cover the 
entrance or any upper ventilation holes. The black tar paper absorbs 
heat from the winter sun and helps the colony better regulate tempera-
tures during cold spells. It also acts as a windbreak.
 
Figure 5-15: 
Wrap your 
hive in tar 
paper and 
place a rock 
on top to 
help keep 
your colony 
warm in 
winter tem-
peratures.
 
 
 Put a double thickness of tar paper over the top of the hive, and place 
a rock on top to prevent cold winds from lifting the tar paper off. Cut a 
hole in the wrapping to accommodate the ventilation hole in the upper 
deep-hive body.
 
 Provide a windbreak if your winter weather is harsh. If you didn’t 
place your hives where they’re protected by a natural windbreak of 
shrubbery, you can erect a temporary windbreak of fence posts and 
burlap. Position it to block prevailing winter winds.

546
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Clustering in a winter wonderland
Winter is the slowest season of your beekeeping cycle. Your bees are in 
their winter cluster, toasty and warm inside the hive. Now is the time to do 
the following:
 
 Clean, repair, and store your equipment for the winter.
 
 Monitor the hive entrance. Brush off any dead bees or snow that block 
the entrance.
 
 Make sure the bees have enough food! The late winter and early spring 
is when colonies can die of starvation. Late in the winter, on a nice, mild 
day when there’s no wind or bees flying, take a quick peek inside your 
hive. It’s best not to remove any frames. Just have a look-see under the 
cover. Do you see bees? They still should be in a cluster in the upper 
deep. Are they okay?
 
 If you don’t notice any sealed honey in the top frames, you may need to 
begin some emergency feeding. But remember that once you start feeding, 
you cannot stop until the bees are bringing in their own pollen and nectar.
Spring is in the air: Starting 
your second season
Spring is one of the busiest times of year for bees (and beekeepers). It’s the 
season when new colonies are started and established colonies come back 
to life.
As the days get longer and milder, the established hive comes alive, explod-
ing in population. The queen steadily lays more and more eggs, ultimately 
reaching her greatest rate of egg-laying. The drones begin reappearing, and 
hive activity starts hopping. The nectar and pollen begin coming into the hive 
thick and fast. The hive boils with activity, and you face many chores in the 
springtime.
The first thing you need to do is conduct an early inspection. The exact 
timing of this inspection depends upon your location (earlier in warmer 
zones, later in colder zones). Do your first spring inspection on a sunny, mild 
day with no wind and a temperature close to 50 degrees. (A rule of thumb: If 
the weather is cold enough that you need a heavy overcoat, it’s too cold to 
inspect the bees.) During this inspection, do the following:

547
 Chapter 5: Beginning Beekeeping
Book V
Raising 
Farm 
Animals
 
 Determine whether your bees made it through the winter. The clus-
tered bees should be fairly high in the upper deep-hive body. If you 
don’t see them, can you hear them? Tapping the side of the hive and 
putting your ear against it, listen for a hum or buzzing. If it appears that 
you’ve lost your bees, take the hive apart and clean out any dead bees. 
Reassemble it and order a package of bees as soon as possible. Don’t 
give up. All beekeepers lose their bees at one time or another.
 
 Make sure that you have a queen. Look down between some of the 
frames. Do you see any brood? If so, that’s a good sign that the queen is 
present. To get a better look, you may need to carefully remove a frame 
from the center of the top deep. If you don’t see any brood or eggs, your 
hive may be without a queen, and you should order a new queen as 
soon as possible, assuming, that is, the hive population is sufficient to 
incubate brood when the new queen arrives. What’s sufficient? The clus-
ter of bees needs to be at least the size of a large grapefruit (hopefully 
larger). If you have fewer bees than that, you should plan to order a new 
package of bees (with a queen).
 
 Ensure the bees still have food. Looking down between the frames, 
see if you spot any honey. Honey is capped with white cappings (tan 
cappings are the brood). If you see honey, that’s great. If not, you must 
begin emergency feeding your bees.
 
This inspection must be done quickly, because you don’t want to leave the 
frame open to chilly air.
The following sections explain your other springtime tasks.
Feeding the colony
A few weeks before the first blossoms appear, begin feeding your bees 
(regardless of whether they still have honey). Feed the colony sugar syrup 
to stimulate the queen and encourage her to start laying eggs at a brisk rate. 
The first gallon needs to be medicated with Fumidil-B, but subsequent gallons 
aren’t medicated. Continue feeding until you notice that the bees are bringing 
in their own food. You’ll know when you see pollen on their legs.
 
Feed the colony pollen substitute, which helps strengthen your hive and 
stimulates egg-laying in the queen. Pollen substitute is available in a pow-
dered mix from your bee supplier. This feeding can cease when you see bees 
bringing in their own pollen.
Administering spring medication
A few weeks before the first blossoms appear, you need to begin medicating 
your bees. The list that follows contains a springtime medication regime that 
helps prevent diseases, control mites, and improve your bees’ overall health:

548
Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
 
 To prevent foulbrood: For each colony, mix 1 teaspoon of the antibiotic 
Terramycin with 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar (do not use granu-
lated sugar). Sprinkle the sugar mixture on the ends of the frames’ top 
bars. Don’t allow the mixture to come in direct contact with open brood 
cells, because it’s toxic to larvae. Repeat this “dusting” two more times 
at three- to five-day intervals.
 
 For general health: Add a teaspoon of Honey B Healthy to your sugar 
syrup solution during your spring feedings. It acts as a feeding stimulant 
and helps keep bees healthy even in the presence of mites.
 
 For varroa mite control: Place Apistan strips within the hive, using 
one strip for every five frames of bees. If two deep-hive bodies are used 
for the brood nest, hang Apistan strips in alternate corners of the clus-
ter, utilizing the top and bottom hive bodies. Make certain each strip 
is placed between the frames, not on top of them. For best chemical 
distribution, use Apistan when daytime high temperatures are at least 
50 degrees. Keep strips in the hive for at least 42 days (six weeks), but 
don’t leave strips in the hive for more than 56 days (eight weeks). Honey 
supers may be put on the hive after the strips are removed.
 
 Never, ever leave Apistan in the hive over the winter. Doing so con-
stantly exposes the mites to the active ingredient, which becomes 
weaker and weaker over time. These sub-lethal doses increase the 
chance of mites building up a resistance to Apistan. This tolerance is 
then passed on to future generations of mites, and subsequent treat-
ments become useless.
 
 For tracheal mite control: When the weather starts getting warmer, 
place a prepared bag containing 1.8 ounces of menthol crystals on the 
top bars toward the rear of the hive. Set the bag on a small piece of 
aluminum foil to prevent the bees from chewing holes in it and carrying 
it away. Leave the bag in the hive for 14 consecutive days when the out-
door temperature ranges between 60 and 80 degrees.
Creating room for your bees
Watch out for indications of swarming. Inspect the hive periodically and look 
for swarm cells. Later in the spring, before the colony becomes too crowded, 
add a queen excluder and honey supers.
 
Five to six weeks before adding honey supers to the colony, stop all medication 
treatments to prevent contamination of the honey that you want to harvest.
Reversing hive bodies
Bees normally move upward in the hive during the winter. In early spring, the 
upper deep is full of bees, new brood, and food. But the lower deep-hive body 
is mostly empty. You can help matters by reversing the top and bottom deep-
hive bodies (see Figure 5-16). Doing so also gives you an opportunity to clean 
the bottom board. Follow these steps:

Animals
 
1. On a mild day (50 degrees or so) with little or no wind and bright, 
clear sunlight, open your hive using your smoker in the usual way.
 
2. Place the upturned outer cover on the ground and then remove the 
upper deep-hive body.
 
3. Keep the inner cover on the deep and close the oval hole in the 
middle of the inner cover with a piece of wood shingle or tape.
 
4. Place the deep across the edges of the outer cover, so there are only 
four points of contact (you squeeze fewer bees this way).
 
5. Now you can see down into the lower deep that still rests on the 
bottom board.
 
 It’s probably empty, but even if you find some inhabitants, lift the lower 
deep off the bottom board and place it crossways on the inner cover 
that’s covering the deep you previously removed.
 
6. Scrape and clean the bottom board.
 
Figure 5-16: 
Reversing 
hive bodies 
in the spring 
is beneficial 
to the 
colony.
 
 
7. Stand the deep body — formerly the relatively empty bottom one — 
on one end, placing it on the ground; then place the full hive body 
onto the clean bottom board.
 
8. Smoke the bees and remove the inner cover, place the empty deep on 
top, and then replace the inner and outer covers.
Repeat this reversal in about three to four weeks, restoring the hive to 
its original configuration. At that time you can put on one or more honey 
supers — assuming the bees are now bringing in their own food and you’ve 
ceased feeding and medicating.

Book V: Raising Farm Animals 
Recipes for Sugar Syrups
You need to feed your bees sugar syrup twice a year, in spring and in autumn. 
The early spring feeding stimulates activity in the hive and gets your colony up 
and running fast. It also may save lives if the bees’ winter stores of honey have 
dropped dangerously low. The colony will store the autumn sugar syrup feed-
ing for use during the cold winter months. In either case, feeding syrup is also a 
convenient way to administer some important medications.
If you purchased your bees from a reputable bee breeder, you don’t need to 
medicate your bees during your first season. But you still need to feed them 
medicated syrup twice a year (spring and autumn) in your second and subse-
quent seasons.
 
 Basic sugar syrup: Boil 21/2 quarts of water on the stove. When it comes 
to a rolling boil, turn off the heat and add 5 pounds of white granulated 
sugar. Stir until the sugar completely dissolves. The syrup must cool to 
room temperature before you can feed it to your bees.
 
 Winter syrup: This special syrup is for feeding bees that are going into 
the winter months. The thicker consistency of the recipe makes it easier 
for bees to convert the syrup into the honey they’ll store for the winter. 
Boil 21/2 quarts of water on the stove. When it comes to a rolling boil, 
turn off the heat and add 10 pounds of white granulated sugar. Stir until 
the sugar dissolves completely. Let the mixture cool before feeding to 
your bees.
 
 Medicated syrup: For medicated syrup, prepare the basic sugar syrup 
recipe or the winter syrup as previously directed. Let it cool to room 
temperature. Mix 1 teaspoon of Fumidil-B in approximately 1/2 cup 
of cool water (the medication won’t dissolve directly in the syrup). 
Fumidil-B protects your bees against nosema — a common bee illness. 
Add the medication to the syrup and stir. You also can add two table-
spoons of Honey B Healthy to the syrup. This food supplement contains 
essential oils and has a number of beneficial qualities.
 
When making sugar syrup, be sure to turn off the stove before you add the 
sugar. If you continue boiling the sugar syrup, it may caramelize, and that 
makes the bees sick.

you choose one food over another, you make 
a decision that affects your health. As a nutrition-
ist, I’ve witnessed the deterioration in health that 
poor-quality, empty-calorie foods can cause. I’ve 
also seen that a change in diet can produce a 
sometimes dramatic turnaround in how a person 
feels. So why not take advantage of the healing 
properties of foods? This chapter tells you how 
to use certain foods to ameliorate or prevent some of the aches, pains, and 
health conditions common to men and women, and it provides you with 
some great recipes, too.
Healing Foods for Women
Anatomy books 100 years ago showed the male body in detail but delicately 
omitted illustration of the female form and its more private parts. The female 
body was thought of as a sort of lesser version of male physiology. Some 
physical complaints were assumed imaginary or simply emotional.
Yes, we’ve come a long way since these Victorian times. Premenstrual syn-
drome (PMS) is now acknowledged as an identifiable medical condition with 
various protocols for treatment. The word “menopause” can now be men-
tioned in polite society, and it isn’t the end of the world if people notice you

perspiring from a hot flash. There’s also a new respect for subtle differences 
in female anatomy; for example, women’s arteries are more delicate than 
men’s, requiring special care during heart surgery.
However, these are recent advances, and we still don’t have all the answers. 
Fortunately, you can do much to ensure your well-being by choosing the 
right foods to eat. This section shows you how nourishing foods can support 
female health.
 
As a woman, you need certain nutrients in particular for hormonal health 
and normal reproductive function. Table 1-1 lists a variety of nutrients and 
the foods you can find them in. This list gives you a wide range of choices for

PMS-friendly foods
An estimated 97 percent of females have PMS at some point in life. For about 
40 percent of these women, symptoms are significantly intense, and for about 
5 percent, PMS disrupts their usual routines for a day or two each month. Yet 
simple remedies for various symptoms of PMS abound. You can use food to 
balance hormones and increase or diminish their production, thereby taming 
monthly woes.
As many as 150 symptoms of PMS have been identified, covering a range from 
sugar cravings and crying spells to migraines and backache. These symptoms 
are commonly grouped into various categories, each associated with specific 
nutritional deficiencies that probably developed over a period of many years. 
Each group of symptoms can be treated with specific dietary changes. Take a 
look at some of the most common problems.
Irritability, nervous tension, mood swings, and anxiety
Irritability, nervous tension, mood swings, and anxiety are all symptoms 
characteristic of estrogen dominance, which occurs when your body makes 
too much of this hormone in relation to progesterone.
Your body may be producing excess estrogen, but estrogen can accumulate in 
the system in several other diet-related ways. If your body is lacking B-complex 
vitamins, for example, the liver can’t perform its normal function of inactivat-
ing excess estrogen. If you’re lacking fiber, estrogen in the process of being 
excreted via the intestines can be reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. And 
estrogen in the food supply — in meats and dairy products from animals raised 
with supplemental hormones — can add to your own supply of estrogen. If 
you’re suffering from PMS, make sure to eat these foods only if they’re organic.

556
Book VI: Natural Health 
 
Organic produce is also highly recommended. Regular produce may be 
sprayed with pesticides that mimic estrogen. While the body quickly metabo-
lizes natural estrogens, the synthetic estrogen-like compounds that are 
byproducts of pesticides tend to accumulate in body tissue. These can be 
potent at even low levels, especially when several are present. Such com-
pounds can upset your own hormone balance.
The emotional symptoms of PMS can also be triggered by rapid drops in 
blood sugar, as well as low levels of endorphins, brain chemicals that make 
you feel that all is right with the world. To help stabilize your blood sugar, 
eat a natural foods diet and give yourself sufficient protein. Such foods also 
provide B-complex vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and these ingredients are 
free of added hormones.
 
Go out of your way to eat foods that contain these nutrients: B complex, cho-
line, inositol, magnesium, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and zinc. (Table 1-1, earlier in 
this chapter, lists foods that are high in these nutrients.) Foods that contain 
phyto-estrogens also help tame emotions. Puree of Green Soybean Soup is a 
delicious way to increase your intake. (The later section “Munching your way 
through menopause” explains phytohormones.) Flavonoids also help balance 
hormones.
What’s going on in there?
PMS is triggered by an imbalance in sex hor-
mones. These hormones direct a woman’s 
monthly menstrual cycle. In the first half of 
the month, estrogen output is on the rise, and 
then it rapidly declines at ovulation. Then pro-
gesterone production kicks in and increases in 
the days leading up to your period. However, 
output can vary, and too much or too little of 
a hormone at the wrong time can trigger PMS 
symptoms.
Your hormone production may be off for many 
reasons, including taking birth control pills, 
gynecological problems such as endometriosis 
or fibroids, multiple childbirths, lack of exercise, 
stress, and simply being over age 30. However, 
it’s also more than likely that what you’re eating 
is affecting your cycle.
Normal hormone production depends upon 
having a ready supply of certain vitamins, 
minerals, and, yes, fats — both essential fatty 
acids and saturated fats. When you consume 
saturated fats, such as those found in butter 
and animal foods, your body converts them into 
reproductive hormones. This is why women 
who diet or exercise themselves into a state of 
extremely low body fat stop having their periods, 
a medical condition known as amenorrhea.

Puree of Green Soybean Soup
In this soup, the mild flavor of fresh soybeans combines well with the more familiar 
taste of lima beans. Soybeans supply phyto-estrogens that help balance hormones, 
while lima beans, which are exceptionally high in magnesium, help quell PMS emotions. 
This soup makes a refreshing and slightly tart starter course.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour, 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 cups fresh lima beans, or 1 cup dried lima 
beans
1 quart filtered water
2 cups green soybeans, removed from pod
2 1⁄ 2 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1⁄ 2 cup buttermilk
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to 
taste
Seasoned Japanese rice crackers (optional)
 1 Put the lima beans in a medium saucepan, and add water to cover. Cover the pan and 
simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes if using fresh beans, and 45 minutes to 1 hour if 
using dried beans.
 2 In the meantime, bring 1 quart water to a boil. Add the soybeans, lower heat to simmer, 
and cook, covered, until tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.
 3 Drain both pots of beans. Put the beans in a food processor and puree, adding some of 
the chicken broth if needed to facilitate the pureeing.
 4 Put the pureed beans, remaining chicken broth, and lemon juice in a medium saucepan. 
Heat the soup on low heat for 10 minutes, until it just simmers. Remove from heat.
 5 Stir in the buttermilk. Season to taste with sea salt and pepper. Pour into preheated 
individual soup bowls, and, if desired, serve with seasoned Japanese rice crackers.
Cravings for carbohydrates
In the five or ten days before you begin your period, you may be especially 
hungry for breads of all kinds, chocolate cake, and any cookie you lay eyes 
on. Elevated insulin levels may be the cause. Insulin is the hormone that 
enables your body to store sugar in your cells for ready energy later. Excess 

558
Book VI: Natural Health 
insulin causes your cells to rapidly absorb the sugar. Once this sugar is 
inside the cells, your blood sugar drops, sometimes suddenly if you’ve eaten 
a lot of sugar quickly. You feel fatigued, dizzy, shaky, and faint, and have a 
headache. This is the moment you decide that you can’t live without lemon 
meringue pie.
 
When you crave sweets or carbs, have healthy ones, such as a couple of whole-
grain crackers topped with nut butter, so that you give your system some pro-
tein and fat along with the carbs. This combination helps steady blood sugar 
and even helps prevent weight gain. Also, sometimes a craving for sweets 
masks a craving for protein. Give yourself a little chicken breast and some veg-
etables and then take note of whether you still have a strong urge for pie.
For carbohydrate cravings, focus on foods that contain these nutrients: B 
complex, magnesium, omega-3 essential fatty acids, and vitamin E. For foods 
that contain these nutrients, refer to Table 1-1, earlier in this chapter.
Fluid retention, swelling with associated 
weight gain, and breast tenderness
Forty percent of women with PMS experience some bloating. Reproductive 
hormones that are out of balance can hamper the kidneys’ ability to manage 
sodium and fluid levels in the body. You can end up with swollen hands and 
feet or difficulty cinching your belt. High insulin levels and vitamin B6 defi-
ciency can also cause fluid retention.
 
To reduce bloating, minimize your intake (or completely avoid) salt and con-
centrated sweets, including refined white sugar, honey, and maple syrup, 
as well as foods made with these. Increase foods rich in potassium, such as 
bananas, and take advantage of the diuretic properties of certain foods, such 
as parsley.
 
These three nutrients are especially helpful: magnesium, omega-6 essential 
fatty acids, and vitamin B6. (To find the foods you need, refer to Table 1-1, 
earlier in this chapter.)
Feeling blue and depression
In this group of symptoms related to depression, other possible complaints 
can include weepiness, confusion, insomnia, and forgetfulness. Such prob-
lems are again the result of hormone imbalance — in this case, a predomi-
nance of progesterone, which can act as a depressant. Low levels of certain 
neurotransmitters in the central nervous system and low blood sugar can 
also cause these problems.

559

Health
 
Like your mother said, eat breakfast and regularly scheduled meals to keep 
your blood sugar steady. You also need these special nutrients to help 
decrease depression, plus phyto-estrogens and flavonoids: B complex, essen-
tial fatty acids, magnesium, and potassium. (For tips on what to eat, flip ahead 
to the section “Munching your way through menopause,” or turn back to the 
food list in Table 1-1.)
Treating menstrual problems with food
Even if you have virtually no troubling symptoms of PMS, other medical 
problems can occur once menstruation begins. Like many women, you may 
experience abdominal cramping for the first few days of your cycle. Your 
menstrual flow may be particularly heavy or especially light. In these cases, a 
change in diet can greatly improve how you feel.
Cramps and lower back pain
Cramps are a very common part of the package when you start having men-
strual difficulties. Along with abdominal cramping, you may also feel pain in 
the inner thighs and lower back. In more severe cases, women also experi-
ence nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and heavy bleeding.
These symptoms can be caused by an imbalance in a particular group of 
hormone-like compounds called prostaglandins. One sort of prostaglandin 
promotes expansion of blood vessels and muscles. Another sort, the Series 
II prostaglandin, promotes contraction. When Series II prostaglandins domi-
nate, cramping can result as blood vessels within the uterus and the muscles 
surrounding the uterus contract. Sodium and fluid retention also do their 
share in causing menstrual pain.
 
Red meat and dairy foods promote the production of Series II prostaglandins. 
These foods contain arachidonic acid, which converts to the Series II prosta-
glandins. Beef contains the most arachidonic acid, lamb and pork somewhat 
less, and chicken and turkey the least of all. If you want to include meat in 
your meals but are suffering from menstrual cramping, eat poultry rather than 
beef. If your cramps persist, go vegetarian for a few days before you start your 
period and during it.
 
Choose protein sources such as fish, beans, and whole grains rather than red 
meat. Avoid milk products and processed cheese, which are high in sodium 
(sodium promotes fluid retention and adds to your discomfort). Use nondairy 
nut and soy milks instead. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables for fiber. Avoid 
refined sugar.

560
Book VI: Natural Health 
Be sure to eat sufficient amounts of the following nutrients, found in the 
foods listed in Table 1-1 earlier in this chapter: calcium, magnesium, and 
omega-6 essential fatty acids.
Heavy menstrual flow and related anemia
If your menstrual flow is infrequent or sporadic, you may experience heavy 
menstrual bleeding at times, which in turn may lead to anemia and iron defi-
ciency, leaving you tired and pale. Besides iron, other important nutrients are 
vitamin C and the flavonoids, both of which help strengthen fragile capillary 
walls and thus prevent excess bleeding. You may also benefit from including 
flaxseed and flaxseed oil in your meals. Research shows that flaxseed can act 
as a menstrual regulator, restoring normal timing of the menstrual cycle.
To replenish your blood supply, you need the following nutrients: B complex, 
copper, iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C. (See Table 1-1 earlier in this chapter 
for recommended foods that contain these nutrients.)
 
Anemia can be a serious medical condition. If fatigue and pallor persist, 
consult a physician.
Eating for two
There’s no better time to begin eating quality foods than during pregnancy, 
when what you eat also affects another’s life. The first eight weeks of preg-
nancy are especially critical, when your baby’s kidneys, heart, lungs, eyes, 
and mouth are beginning to form.
Begin by following these guidelines:
 
 You need protein, essential fatty acids, and complex carbohydrates. 
Eat natural, unrefined, and unprocessed foods, including grains, beans, 
eggs, nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and meats, poultry, and fish as free 
of toxins as possible. Organic foods should be the rule rather than the 
exception.
 
 Eat several small meals throughout the day. Large meals can be more 
difficult to digest.
 
 Avoid caffeine, sugar, and drugs. Caffeine is found in sodas, teas, 
and chocolate. Eliminate all alcohol, tobacco products, and any 
over-the-counter drugs (other than those prescribed by a physician) 
or illegal drugs. If you use these, a miscarriage or a birth defect in your 
child can result.

Getting the right amount of calories
When you’re pregnant, you need about 300 more calories a day than you’re 
used to. This is what a growing baby requires. Of course, the extra calories 
should not come from candy, chips, pizza, or ice cream. Increase your pro-
tein intake significantly to at least 100 grams a day, well beyond the usual rec-
ommendation of 65 grams daily. Protein is the building block of body tissue.
 
Most women gain between 20 and 40 pounds during pregnancy. If, by your 
fourth month, you have already gained 30 pounds, you may need to cut back 
on your eating. But never, under any circumstances, go on a low-calorie diet 
when you’re carrying a child. Your baby could have a low birth weight and 
be weaker and more susceptible to disease. Delayed physical and mental 
development can also result, and such a diet can leave you exhausted and 
unhealthy.
 
Always consult with your doctor before making radical changes in your diet 
while pregnant and before taking nutrient and herbal supplements.
Getting enough calcium
During pregnancy, you need about 1,000 milligrams a day of calcium, but 
most prenatal vitamin supplements contain only up to 25 percent of that. 
You’ll probably need to take a supplement, as well as eat calcium-rich foods, 
including organic yogurt and other dairy products, almonds, and blackstrap 
molasses.
 
To increase your absorption of calcium, be sure to consume foods that supply 
vitamin D, such as fatty fish and egg yolks. Alternatively, get 15 minutes of sun 
exposure each day. Your body can use sunlight to manufacture vitamin D.
Feasting on folic acid
Folic acid helps prevent birth defects, especially those that affect the brain, 
spine, and nervous system. It also plays an essential role in the formation of 
DNA and RNA, the genetic material that controls cell division and replication 
and promotes the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. If you’re 
pregnant or nursing, you need about 800 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid a 
day (1 microgram is one millionth of a gram). Fortunately, nature provides 
some delicious sources, which are listed in Table 1-1 earlier in this chapter.
You may also need to take a supplement, especially if you used an oral con-
traceptive before becoming pregnant, which can deplete folic acid.

Artichokes with Mediterranean 
 
Garlic Sauce
Artichokes, an excellent choice of folic acid as well as other B vitamins, contain a wide 
variety of other nutrients important for female health — calcium, magnesium, iron, 
potassium, and some zinc. Even slowly nibbling one of these thistles at the end of an 
anxious day can be quite soothing.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes, plus time to cool
Yield: 2 servings
2 medium globe artichokes
1 quart filtered water
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
3 cloves garlic, 1 clove minced
2 tablespoons commercial mayonnaise, 
preferably free of hydrogenated oil
2 tablespoons plain yogurt
1 teaspoon lemon juice
 1 Snap off the artichoke’s tough outer leaves. Using a paring knife, cut off the stem and 
trim the bottom to an even round shape with a flat base. Cut 1 inch from the top of the 
remaining leaves.
 2 Sit the artichokes upright in a medium saucepan. Add the water, vinegar, and 2 cloves 
unminced garlic.
 3 Cook, covered, on medium heat for 20 minutes or until a leaf can be easily pulled out. 
Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.
 4 In the meantime, combine the mayonnaise, yogurt, lemon juice, and one clove minced 
garlic in a small bowl; whisk until well blended.
 5 Remove the artichokes from the cooking liquid and drain well. Place each artichoke on 
a serving plate. Dip each artichoke leaf into the sauce and relax while you enjoy the 
slow-paced ceremony of artichoke eating.
Fiber
The female hormone progesterone, essential for providing an environment in 
which the fetus can thrive, has a tendency to relax the bowel muscles during 
pregnancy, which can result in constipation. Don’t take a laxative. Instead, 
rely on prune juice and high-fiber foods. Consult a doctor if that doesn’t work.

563
 Chapter 1: Healing Foods for Women and Men
Book VI
Natural 
Health
 
A wide range of foods contain fiber: apples, barley, beans, bean sprouts, ber-
ries, broccoli, brown rice, buckwheat, carrots, corn, kale, lentils, mangoes, 
oats, okra, papaya, pears, peas, popcorn, prunes, and whole wheat.
Essential fatty acids (EFAs)
Essential fatty acids, or EFAs, are the kind of fats that are good for you. 
They’re critical for the normal formation of membranes, the outer part of 
every cell in the body. The brain of a growing fetus also requires EFAs, as 
they make up about 60 percent of brain tissue. The estimated optimal daily 
doses are 9 grams of omega-6 fatty acids and 6 grams of omega-3 fatty acids. 
A diet high in plant foods, including nuts, seeds, and unrefined vegetables 
oils, can provide what you need. Taking 1 to 2 tablespoons a day of flaxseed 
oil, especially high in the omega-3 fatty acids, is another good way to increase 
your intake.
 
As you increase your intake of EFAs, be sure to also increase your intake of 
antioxidants.
Iodine
Pregnancy requires at least 175 micrograms of iodine a day. (Take a look at 
the list in Table 1-1, earlier in this chapter, for food sources.) You can eat sea-
food and seaweed to obtain this. During pregnancy, limit your salt intake to 1 
teaspoon a day.
Iron
The requirement for iron during pregnancy is 30 milligrams a day. Foods that 
contain iron include beets, blackstrap molasses, clams, legumes, liver, nuts, 
oysters, raisins, seaweed, and seeds.
Avoid drinking coffee and tea, caffeinated and decaffeinated, which increase 
urination and flush iron out of the system.
Magnesium
The recommendation for magnesium is about 350 milligrams a day. All green 
vegetables contain magnesium. (For specific suggestions, refer to Table 1-1, 
earlier in this chapter.)
Zinc
During pregnancy, you require 15 milligrams of zinc daily. Oysters are far and 
away the richest source of zinc. Enjoy these cooked. You can find other foods 
that contain zinc in Table 1-1.

564
Book VI: Natural Health 
Foods to avoid during pregnancy
 
Certain foods that are relatively harmless when you’re not pregnant can pose 
serious dangers to your body when you are. Stay away from foods that may 
carry various bacteria or parasites, such as
 
 Raw fish, including sushi and seviche
 
 Runny eggs
 
 Pâtés and soft cheeses such as blue cheese
 
 Unpasteurized milk, cheese, and juice
Also avoid cabbage, chilies, garlic, onions, red peppers, and other spicy or 
gas-forming foods if you’re already sensitive to them.
 
In general, stay away from all herbal teas. Many can interfere with pregnancy.
After the baby arrives
Mother’s milk is far superior nutritionally to baby formula. Of course, some 
of everything you eat or take into your body goes into your breast milk, and 
eventually into your baby. So if you’re nursing, watch what you eat. It’s a 
good idea to continue avoiding the foods, chemicals, and other substances 
that were dangerous for your fetus.
As a nursing mother, you also need to increase your calorie intake by about 
500 calories a day compared to your pre-pregnancy calorie intake. And cer-
tain nutrients are especially important — all the B vitamins, including niacin, 
riboflavin, and thiamin, as well as calcium, iodine, and essential fatty acids.
Munching your way through menopause
Women who enter menopause with adequate reserves of vitamins, miner-
als, and other essential nutrients pass through this transition with fewer 
symptoms than do women who reach midlife physically depleted and poorly 
nourished. Even if menopause is years away, you’ll thank yourself later if you 
improve your eating habits now.
Medicinals for morning sickness
Ginger works as well for morning sickness as 
it does for seasickness. Grate a half-inch of 
ginger root into a cup filled with boiling water. 
Steep for 5 minutes before drinking. Have this 
tea every morning before breakfast. Eating 
little snacks throughout the day can also help 
a queasy stomach.

Symptoms of menopause are most dramatic during the year or two leading up 
to menopause, the phase called perimenopause. As in PMS, symptoms are the 
result of hormone imbalances. You may have abnormally high levels of estro-
gen as compared with progesterone or vice versa. Symptoms such as irritabil-
ity, anxiety, depression, and “menopausal rage” can occur. Lowered estrogen 
levels can also affect memory. In addition, the body’s ability to regulate tem-
perature may go on the fritz like a broken thermostat, triggering hot flashes.
Food is a powerful tool for dampening and even preventing these annoy-
ances. And what you decide not to eat is just as important.
Vitamins E, A, C, and the Bs
Vitamin E, taken in through diet or as a supplement, is one of the most impor-
tant vitamins for menopause. (Be sure to take the natural form.) The B vita-
mins and vitamins A and C, as well as a variety of minerals, are also essential. 
(You can find their food sources in Table 1-1, earlier in this chapter.)
Phyto-estrogens and flavonoids
Natural foods also provide other active compounds that recent research is 
showing are vital for your health. These include flavonoids and the group of 
compounds called phyto-estrogens, which function like hormones and help 
balance your own.
Phyto-estrogens
Phytohormones, popularly called phyto-estrogens, are found in dozens of 
plant foods. They work to help balance hormones and, as a result, help pre-
vent symptoms of PMS and menopause that stem from the dramatic rise 
and fall of hormones. In some cultures, such plant foods may contribute as 
much as 50 percent of caloric intake. According to a 1990 study in the British 
Journal of Medicine, intake of phyto-estrogens at this level could potentially 
diminish menopause symptoms.
 
Soybeans contain especially potent phyto-estrogen, but many everyday veg-
etables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, and nuts exhibit some estrogenic activ-
ity. Add these to your shopping list:
 
 Flavorings: Licorice, anise, and garlic
 
 Fruit: Apples, cherries, citrus, and pomegranates
 
 Legumes: Chickpeas, red beans, soybeans, and split peas
 
 Oils: Extra-virgin olive oil, cold-pressed oils, and flaxseed oil
 
 Seeds: Sesame seeds and flaxseed
 
 Vegetables: Beets, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery, fennel, 
onions, parsley, potatoes, and radishes
 
 Whole grains: Barley, corn, oats, rice, rye, and wheat

Book VI: Natural Health 
Flavonoids
Flavonoids are a group of vitamin-like compounds with a chemical structure 
and activity similar to estrogen. Flavonoids help minimize estrogen highs and 
lows. Good sources of flavonoids include apples, lemons, onions green and 
black tea, and dark beer. (Note: Flavonoids are found in the pulp and pith of 
fruits and vegetables, so to get this nutrient, you need to eat these foods in 
their whole form.)
Buckwheat, which contains flavonoids, makes a good salad. In the following 
recipe, it substitutes for bulghur wheat in the traditional Middle Eastern dish 
tabbouli.
2 cups unfiltered water
1 cup unroasted whole buckwheat groats
2 scallions, chopped
1 bunch fresh parsley, stems removed and 
leaves chopped (1 cup)
2 sprigs fresh mint, stems removed and leaves 
chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
 
Turkish Buckwheat Salad
Buckwheat groats supply iron, niacin, and thiamin, nutrients that help you feel ener-
gized. Buckwheat is a source of flavonoids that help balance hormones.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes, plus at least 1 hour to blend flavors
Yield: 4 large servings
 1 In a large saucepan, bring the water to boil over high heat.
 2 Stir in the buckwheat groats and immediately lower heat to simmer. Cook, covered, for 
15 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed. Remove from heat and set aside.
 3 Spoon the cooked buckwheat into a large bowl. Add the scallions, parsley, mint, cumin, 
lemon juice, oil, and salt and pepper.
 4 Gently toss salad ingredients together until well blended. Cover and refrigerate for at 
least 1 hour to blend flavors. Serve as a side dish with grilled meats, such as lamb 
chops, and a cucumber-yogurt salad.

Healing foods for menopausal symptoms
Menopause involves far more than changes in hormone production. It is a 
shift in body chemistry that affects the adrenal glands, the nervous system, 
the skeleton, and the brain. You need to nourish your body with sustaining 
foods as your body adjusts. Foods that contain phyto-estrogens are espe-
cially important to include in your meals. Many symptoms of menopause are 
triggered by rapid changes in estrogen levels, and these phyto-nutrients help 
you avoid the extremes.
 
As your period becomes more irregular during perimenopause, you may expe-
rience PMS even if you didn’t when you were younger. You may also experi-
ence heavy menstrual bleeding. Follow the dietary advice given earlier in this 
chapter for these conditions.
Hot flashes
If it suddenly feels like you’re living in the tropics, you’re having a hot flash. A 
small burst of heat begins in the chest area and quickly expands to the face 
and arms. You sweat and then feel quite chilled as the perspiration evapo-
rates and your body temperature quickly drops. You may also feel some 
anxiety.
These special nutrients help with hot flashes: magnesium, selenium, and vita-
min E. Vitamin E is considered the prime menopause nutrient, and selenium 
works with vitamin E to maximize its effectiveness. (Refer to Table 1-1 for 
food sources.) Flavonoids and phyto-estrogens are also important nutrients, 
because they both help balance hormones.
With all that sweating, hot flashes can leave you thirsty and depleted of min-
erals such as magnesium, potassium, and sodium, which you lose through 
the skin when you perspire. The same is true for night sweats, surges of heat 
that wake you from your sleep.
 
Avoid stimulating and warming foods such as caffeinated coffee and tea, 
chocolate, spicy foods, and alcoholic beverages, including beer. A large dose 
of sugar, such as a slice of pecan pie, can also bring on a flash.

568
Book VI: Natural Health 
 
Hot Flash Fruit Compote
Having a hot flash triggers your body to perspire in an effort to cool down. In the pro-
cess of sweating, you lose fluids and several important minerals — magnesium, potas-
sium, and sodium. At breakfast, replenish what you’ve lost with plenty of fresh filtered 
water and a mineral-rich fruit and nut compote. This recipe is a good place to start. 
Select from the following ingredients, making sure to include some juicy chunks of 
melon!
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 4 servings
4 cups diced fruit (apricots, bananas, black 
currants, cantaloupe, cherries, dates, guava, 
honeydew melon, kiwi, mango, papaya, and/or 
pears)
3 tablespoons pumpkin seeds
3 tablespoons nuts (almonds, cashews, and/or 
pistachios)
Sea salt (optional)
2 tablespoons yogurt (optional)
Unsulphured blackstrap molasses (optional)
Chopped fresh mint leaves (optional)
 1 Put the fruit in a bowl and combine with the seeds and nuts.
 2 Sprinkle the combination with a pinch of sea salt, if desired, and stir.
 3 Spoon fruit mixture into individual serving bowls, and, if desired, top with yogurt and 
molasses and a sprig of mint. Dig in!
Fatigue
Fatigue is the most commonly reported symptom of menopause. Hot flashes 
can be draining. Anemia due to heavy bleeding may also cause fatigue, and 
iron-rich foods are needed. These special nutrients help reduce fatigue: B 
complex vitamins, iron, and vitamin C. (Refer to Table 1-1 for a list of food 
sources.)
Weight gain
With menopause, you may develop a rounded belly, due to changes in your 
output of reproductive hormones. It’s in the lower abdominal tissue that you 
make some of your postmenopausal estrogen as production in your ovaries 
diminishes. Gaining about 5 to 10 pounds at menopause is normal. Fluid 
retention can also lead to a temporary increase in weight.

Natural 
Health
Resist going on a crash diet, which will rob you of needed vitamins and min-
erals. Instead, have moderate portions of whole foods. And avoid refined 
sugar, which is all calories and no nutrients.
Memory
Research has shown that estrogen improves verbal recall and the ability to 
acquire and remember newly associated thoughts. Estrogenic foods, essen-
tial fatty acids, antioxidants, lecithin, B complex vitamins, and the minerals 
potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, and boron all promote mental 
alertness. (Refer to Table 1-1 for a list of food sources.) In addition, maintain-
ing stable blood sugar levels, getting sufficient rest, and exercising regularly 
to increase your oxygen supply can help.
Mood swings, irritability, depression
Follow the nutrient and food recommendations given for these symptoms 
earlier in this chapter under the sections on irritability and depression. 
Phyto-estrogens can also help balance hormones and steady mood swings. 
Avoid refined and processed foods, caffeine, and alcohol.
Sexual problems
While sexuality certainly continues post-menopause, there’s no denying that 
as your supply of reproductive hormones declines, your sexual energy can 
alter and diminish. Vaginal tissue also goes through changes. However, the 
right diet can help you restore a once-vital sex life.
First, make a special effort to avoid symptom triggers such as caffeine, white 
sugar, and nutrient-depleted refined foods. Then boost your intake of whole 
foods, such as seasonal fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, seafood, 
nuts, and seeds. These foods supply nutrients that maintain vaginal health, 
keep tissues firm through the manufacture of collagen, and increase sexual 
response.
 
These nutrients help maintain healthy vaginal tissue: copper, essential fatty 
acids, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and vitamin E. The following nutrients 
help you maintain vaginal lubrication and sexual vitality: folic acid, niacin,
and zinc.
Menopause and degenerative disease
Although you often hear osteoporosis and heart disease lumped together 
with the symptoms of menopause, these degenerative diseases aren’t inevi-
table consequences of passing through the change-of-life. Lowered hormone 
levels can be a risk factor, and the likelihood of developing these diseases 
can increase as you pass middle age, but eating the right foods is a good way 
to help prevent these diseases.

Healing Foods for Men
Some health issues unique to men — like enlarged prostate, prostate cancer, 
impotency, and faltering libido — can be affected by diet. The recommended 
way of eating for all these conditions is the same. Build meals based on natu-
ral, unrefined, and unprocessed whole foods. Avoid added hormones and 
toxins. Enjoy a wide variety of ingredients, from meats, poultry, and seafood 
to fruits of the field.
 
Many of the same nutrients listed for women (refer to Table 1-1 earlier in this

Prostate problems
The prostate is a small, walnut-shaped gland that sits at the base of the blad-
der. Its job is to produce part of the fluid that makes semen. With the first 
contractions of orgasm, prostatic fluid begins to flow. The gland also metabo-
lizes the male hormone, testosterone.
There was a time when no one thought much about the prostate gland. But 
now that prostate tumors are the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer 
in men (excluding skin cancer) and the second leading cause of death among 
males, prostate disease is a common concern.
Enlarged prostate
About 60 percent of all men between 40 and 59 years of age have benign pros-
tatic hyperplasia (BPH), or an enlarged prostate. The incidence has increased 
tremendously in the last few decades. Depending upon what portion of the 
prostate becomes enlarged, the gland can place pressure on the bladder, 
causing typical BPH symptoms. At first, a man may find he needs to urinate 
more frequently. Then, as BPH progresses, symptoms can include greater 
urgency of urination, increased frequency, especially at night, and difficulty 
completely emptying the bladder.
To combat BPH, you need to take advantage of several nutrients. (Refer to 
Table 1-2 for foods that contain these nutrients.)
 
 Vitamin B6 and zinc: Both play a role in the complexity of processes 
and chemical reactions that lead to hormone balance.
 
 Vitamin E and selenium: Both are essential nutrients for prostate 
health.
 
 Essential fatty acids: These acids have been used clinically to success-
fully reduce symptoms of BPH. Eat the equivalent of 1 teaspoon of essen-
tial fatty acids or 4 grams a day. Avoid processed and hydrogenated oils, 
and lower your intake of saturated fats.
 
Recent studies show that the herb saw palmetto can significantly improve the 
urinary difficulties associated with BPH and is useful in the prevention of BPH. 
Other herbal treatments include flower pollen, prescribed in Europe, and gin-
seng, which is used in China.

Two-Fisted Tuna on Toast
Fish is an excellent source of essential fatty acids. An easy-to-make fish sandwich for 
lunch is a great way to increase your intake. Choose a fatty fish such as tuna, salmon, or 
sardines, which gives you an extra dose of healing omega-3 essential fatty acids, impor-
tant for prostate health.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 2 minutes for the toast
Yield: 1 hefty sandwich
1 6-ounce can tuna, packed in water
1⁄ 3 cup diced onion
1 tablespoon red wine or balsamic vinegar
2 slices crusty whole-grain bread, toasted
2 slices tomato
4 anchovies
Freshly grated pepper to taste
 1 In a small bowl, mix together the tuna, onion, and red wine or vinegar.
 2 Lay the two pieces of toast on a work surface. Cover one slice with the tomato slices 
and spread the tuna mixture on top. Arrange the anchovies on the tuna. Season with 
pepper. Top with the second piece of toast.
 3 With a sharp knife, cut the sandwich in half. Wolf down with potato salad and a glass of 
fruit juice mixed with club soda.
Healing foods for prostatitis
In prostatitis, the prostate gland is infected due to a urinary infection, a 
blood-borne infection, or venereal disease. If you have this condition, avoid 
spicy foods and refrain from caffeine, alcohol, and cigarettes, all of which are 
potential irritants of the prostate gland. Also avoid sugar.
 
Pumpkin seeds are an excellent source of zinc, essential fatty acids, and cer-
tain amino acids, all helpful in reducing symptoms of BPH. However, these 
aren’t the pumpkin seeds you find in the kind of pumpkin you carve and put a 
candle in for Halloween. Rather, they’re long, flat, and dark green. They’re sold 
in natural-food stores and in Latin markets, where they’re called pepitas.

Protective nutrients for prostate cancer
Age, family history, and race affect your risk of prostate cancer. African-
American men have an especially high rate. Prostate cancer is related to diet 
in only about 10 to 20 percent of cases. However, recent research is discover-
ing some nutrients that may be beneficial in lowering your risk.
 
 Lycopene: A phyto-nutrient found in tomatoes, lycopene is associated 
with a lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer.
 
 Selenium: An antioxidant, selenium is almost as effective as vitamin E in 
reducing the risk of prostate cancer. This mineral may block cell damage 
as well as protect the prostate from environmental carcinogens. (Nearly 
half the selenium a man carries in his body is in the testes and seminal 
ducts adjacent to the prostate gland.) Unfortunately, selenium defi-
ciency is common. In addition, men lose selenium in their semen.
 
 Vitamin D: This vitamin appears to inhibit the spread of cancer. Sunlight 
allows the body to synthesize this important nutrient.
 
 Vitamin E: Taking a daily supplement of 400 IU of this antioxidant can 
help reduce the incidence of prostate cancer.
 
Regular consumption of red meat and dairy products is a risk factor. The 
Japanese, who consume a low-fat fish and vegetable diet, have the lowest inci-
dence of prostate cancer in the industrialized world.
 
Contaminants that can upset hormone balance
Pesticides and other contaminants present 
in food, some products, and the environment 
break down into compounds that behave like 
hormones. These substances include dioxin, 
polyhalogenated biphenyls, hexachloroben-
zene, dibenzofurans, and diethylstilboestrol 
(DES). Such compounds may contribute to 
hormone imbalance in males. In one animal 
study, DES caused prostate changes similar to 
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or enlarged 
prostate. These are good reasons to eat only 
organic foods. And remember, nutrients such 
as carotenes, flavonoids, chlorophyll, magne-
sium, calcium, selenium, and zinc, as well as 
fiber, support the body’s ability to rid itself of 
these contaminants.

Quick and Easy Cajun Okra
You may stay away from okra because of its odd, slightly slimy texture, but that texture 
is just the reason you should be eating okra more than once every five years. In this 
recipe, the okra is cooked with tantalizing Cajun spices. Enjoy this dish with red beans 
and rice.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄ 2 pound young okra, stems removed and cut 
into 1-inch lengths if the pods are large
1 teaspoon unsalted, organic butter
1 tablespoon prepared Cajun Creole 
Seasoning
Salt to taste
 1 Fill a medium pot with water to about 1 inch from the top. Bring to a boil, and add the 
okra.
 2 Simmer, covered, on medium-low heat until okra is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain the 
okra when it’s sufficiently tender.
 3 Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt the butter. Add the seasoning, and heat over low heat 
for 1 minute to develop seasoning flavors. Add the okra. Using a wooden spoon, toss 
the okra in the seasoned butter to evenly coat. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to combine fla-
vors. Salt to taste, and serve.
Tip: Spice Hunter is one brand of seasoning that makes Cajun Creole Seasoning.
Nourishing your sexuality
What you eat affects your sexual and reproductive anatomy just as much as 
any other part of your body. Problems such as impotence and lack of inter-
est in sex can be brought on, in part, by poor food choices. The pituitary and 
testes produce sex hormones, and even the adrenals produce small amounts. 
These glands require specific nutrients to function properly. A change to 
eating healthier foods that supply certain vitamins, minerals, and healing fats 
can often help correct these conditions.

Erectile dysfunction (impotence)
The inability to achieve or maintain a full erection is known by the medi-
cal term erectile dysfunction (ED). If you’ve ever experienced ED, you’re not 
alone. An estimated 30 million men in the United States — the majority over 
age 65 — have some degree of ED. (No, ED doesn’t affect sexual drive or the 
ability to achieve orgasm.) Medications, stress, emotional problems, infec-
tion, and anatomical abnormalities can cause ED. In addition, certain medical 
conditions are often part of the picture (see the sidebar “Causes of erectile 
dysfunction”).
To keep your heart and arteries healthy (which is necessary for sexual 
potency) and to reduce your risk of diseases or conditions that can cause ED, 
watch what you eat. Follow this way of eating to keep it all in tip-top condi-
tion:
 
 Follow a heart-healthy diet. A heart-healthy diet can normalize choles-
terol levels, help prevent hypertension, and keep the vascular system 
healthy.
 
 Avoid refined white sugar. When eating sweets such as desserts, have 
only small portions. Eat regular meals, and when having a carbohydrate, 
also eat some protein — for example, apple pie and cheese.
 
 Limit alcoholic beverages. A small amount of alcohol stimulates blood 
flow, but alcohol also acts as a depressant and can be a downer. Caffeine 
can also interfere with performance.
 
 Avoid estrogens and growth hormones in meat. These hormones may 
interfere with your own hormone balance and reproductive health. Eat 
only meats that are free of hormone residues.
Take advantage of the special nutrients for potency. All the antioxidants — 
beta-carotene, selenium, vitamin C, and vitamin E — protect cells from free 
radical damage and help prevent tissues in the testes from degeneration. 
Zinc and the B vitamins are essential for the production of testosterone. 
Magnesium helps reverse hardening of the arteries in the penis. And manga-
nese is typically low in body tissues of men who are impotent. (Refer to Table 
1-2 for a list of the top food sources for these nutrients.)
Feeding your libido
Sexual drive, or libido, requires one nutrient in particular — zinc. If you want 
to boost your reserve, you’d best like oysters. These crustaceans are by far 
the most concentrated food source of zinc. While crab is a good source of 
zinc (3 ounces supply 5 milligrams), six medium oysters contain an extraordi-
nary 76 milligrams! Oysters have long been used as an aphrodisiac, and now 
you know why!

576
Book VI: Natural Health 
 
Zinc and the mineral copper need to be kept in balance. Oysters also contain 
some copper, as well as small amounts of calcium and phosphorus, all miner-
als that increase the effectiveness of zinc.
 
Don Juan’s Oyster Stew
To get your daily dose of zinc, try this recipe for oyster stew. It’s delicious because it’s 
buttery, the way oyster stew used to be. If you care only about what the oysters can do 
for you and you’re watching your fat intake, skip the cream and make it just with milk.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 dozen fresh, shucked oysters
2 tablespoons organic, unsalted butter
1 cup oyster liquor or clam juice
1⁄ 2 teaspoon grated onion, or 1⁄ 2 cup sliced 
cooked celery
1 1⁄ 2 cups milk, preferably without added 
hormones and organic
1⁄ 2 cup cream, preferably without added 
hormones and organic
Paprika, for garnish
 1 Fill the lower portion of a double boiler with water and bring to a boil, making sure that 
the top pan doesn’t touch the water. Put the oysters, 1 tablespoon butter, oyster liquor, 
and onion in the top half. Stir briskly and constantly until oysters are just beginning to 
curl, about 1 minute.
 2 Add the milk and cream and continue stirring briskly just until it comes to a boil. 
Remove the double boiler from the heat, making sure not to allow the stew to continue 
boiling.
 3 Pour the oyster stew into warmed individual soup bowls, dividing the oysters evenly.
 4 Serve the stew piping hot, and garnish each serving with some of the remaining butter 
and a dash of paprika.
Tip: If you get a sense of accomplishment from shucking your own oysters, buy them in the 
shell, which should be undamaged and shut tight. Or have someone at your fish store shuck 
the oysters and make sure that he or she also gives you the juice from the oysters (the 
oyster liquor). Or buy oysters that are shucked, packaged, and marked with a “sell by” 
date.

Nutrients for sperm production
Eggs are full of nutrients needed to launch new life, so it should be no sur-
prise that sperm, too, are packed with vitamins and minerals. Sperm contains 
calcium, magnesium, zinc, sulfur, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and inositol, part of 
the B complex of vitamins. Whole grains, legumes, nuts, meats, liver, shell-
fish, and citrus are sources.
 
Zinc, in particular is essential for the production of sperm. Low levels can 
result in sperm that are infertile.
If you’d rather take a nap
Besides desire, sex requires energy. If you’ve been overstressed and aren’t 
eating particularly nourishing foods, you risk adrenal exhaustion. Your 
body’s stress coping mechanisms say, “No more.” The adrenals cut back 
on energy production and insist that you rest. When these glands become 
exhausted, you’re less likely to participate in your normal activities, includ-
ing sex. Help your adrenals revive by staying away from sugar and caffeine. 
Increase your intake of foods that supply B vitamins and vitamin C.
Causes of erectile dysfunction
Normal sexual function depends upon having 
healthy arteries and nerves. Diseases that 
cause damage to these in the trunk of the body 
and limbs can also do harm in the genital area. 
Forty percent of men diagnosed with diabetes 
also experience some degree of impotency. 
High blood sugar levels, which occur in dia-
betes, limit the amount of oxygen the blood is 
able to transport to body cells. Sexual difficul-
ties can result, especially because tissues in 
the penis need more oxygen than usual during 
sexual intercourse. In advanced diabetes, 
nerve damage occurs, which can affect sexual 
activity.
The arteries in the penis are vulnerable to 
atherosclerosis, or narrowing of the arteries, 
preventing enough blood from entering the 
penis to cause sufficient hardness. Vascular 
disease can interfere with the delivery of oxygen 
and nutrients to cells. Hypertension, high total 
cholesterol, and low levels of HDL cholesterol 
are also risk factors for impotency.
Smokers, as compared with nonsmokers, are 
twice as likely to be impotent. Smoke injures 
arteries and disrupts blood flow. So if you 
smoke, quit!
Remember: Medications that promise to 
improve erection can’t function if the blood 
vessels themselves are nonresponsive due to 
degenerative disease.

578
Book VI: Natural Health 
You may also lack the desire and strength for sex if your thyroid gland isn’t 
receiving essential nutrients. Your thyroid controls the rate at which you 
convert food to energy. A sluggish thyroid, or hypothyroidism, can also 
dampen desire. Foods that contain iodine, B vitamins, and especially thiamin, 
plus vitamin E are required.
 
Enjoy all sorts of seafood, whole grains, nuts, and unrefined oils to maintain 
your zest for life.

Getting the Gist of the Jargon
Most capsules, tablets, tinctures, salves, creams, and even herbal shampoos 
contain extracts. When you make a tea on your stove, for example, you’re 
making an extract. When you simmer herbs in a pan of water, the active 
ingredients are released from the plant into the tea. The following definitions 
of terms related to extraction help explain this process:
 
 The solvent: When you make a tea, you add water to the herbs. The 
water is the solvent, also called the menstruum. A solvent is a liquid that 
can selectively remove certain active ingredients (often called active 
compounds), such as alkaloids, from herbs. Besides water, other sol-
vents include alcohol, glycerin, and liquid carbon dioxide. The art of 
extraction is choosing the right solvent system for each herb to maxi-
mize its effectiveness.
 
 The marc: After a batch of herbs is extracted with water or another sol-
vent, the liquid is thoroughly pressed from the spent herb. All the liquid 
is then collected and bottled or further processed. The dry, spent herb 
material is known as the marc. The marc is usually composted to make 
fertilizer for growing more herbs.
 
 Maceration and percolation: The process of soaking herbs in a solvent 
for a period of time, often about two weeks, is called maceration. Pouring 
or forcing a solvent through herbs packed into a large funnel in order 
to pull out the active ingredients is known as percolation. Herbalists use 
either of these two methods to make herbal extracts.
Looking at Tools of the Trade
To make herbal products at home, you need a few pieces of basic equipment, 
such as a blender, a coffee grinder or seed grinder, and a double boiler. You 
can often find these items in natural-foods stores, department stores, or 
kitchen shops.
Blender or grinder
Use a blender or grinder to reduce plant material (dry or fresh) to the small-
est particle size possible. Doing so increases the surface area of the herb 
that’s exposed to the solvent during the extraction process. In the case of 
expensive herbs like ginseng, you want to get as complete an extraction as 
possible, so blending and grinding are particularly important.

Health
A good blender is one of the most important tools for the home herbal prod-
uct maker. Although any high-quality blender will do, try to find one with a 
very high speed and a strong motor. A Vita-Mix has an extra-strong motor, 
which is reversible to help disentangle herb roots and stems that may get 
caught in the blade. The heavy-duty motor also gives a more complete break-
down of the plant material.
A small seed grinder or coffee grinder (available in many kitchen shops) 
is handy for reducing small quantities of dry seeds, root slices, and leaves 
to fine powders. A small grinder usually yields a finer particle size than a 
blender, but it can only process a small amount of herbs or other materials.
 
Any food processor can be useful for shredding fresh roots, seeds, and leafy 
material.
Pots and pans
To simmer roots, barks, and flowers, you need a pot or pan. You may want to 
use different kinds of pots and pans, such as the following, for making differ-
ent kinds of herbal products:
 
 Quality stainless steel pot: Works nicely for making herbal products. 
Use one with a heat-dispersing handle.
 
 Pyrex glass: Great for cooking herbs and herbal oils.
 
 Coffee pots made of quality, heat-resistant glass: Excellent for making 
tea because you can see the color of the tea and judge the strength of 
the tea by its color.
 
 A double boiler (see Figure 2-1): Useful for melting wax and other ingre-
dients without overheating or scorching them.
 
 A crockpot that allows the temperature to be set to about 100 degrees: 
Good for making herbal oils because it keeps the oil warm, thereby increas-
ing the extraction rate and concentration of the herbs in the final oil.
Jars and containers
You can find a wide variety of jars and containers for your herbal products. 
Think about obtaining the following types:
 
 1- or 2-quart canning jars: For extraction and storing herbs. The rubber 
seal keeps oxygen out, preserving the freshness of the herbs. (Note: 
Some stores sell 1-gallon jars for larger extraction batches.)

582
Book VI: Natural Health 
 
 1-, 2-, or 4-ounce Boston amber round bottles with droppers: For tinc-
tures. These bottles (shown in Figure 2-2) are available from pharmacies 
and herb shops.
 
 1-ounce salve jars or tins: For salves and creams.

are available in an amazing variety of shapes and sizes from an office supply 
store or paper-goods catalog.

A food dehydrator
A food dehydrator is a good investment for the home herbal product maker 
because you can
 
 Use it to dry flowers, leaves, root slices, and other herb parts quickly 
and still preserve valuable active plant chemicals and color.
 
 Make potent extracts of both dried and powdered teas.
 
 Dry kitchen spices, such as oregano and basil.
Miscellaneous tools
Following is a list of other useful items you may need to make herbal 
products:
 
 Mortar and pestle: A mortar and pestle is a traditional device used to 
grind small quantities of herbs into a coarse or fine powder by hand. 
Reducing herbs to a powder speeds up the extraction process (the pro-
cess of removing the active chemicals from plants).
 
 Muslin, linen, or cheesecloth: You can use these fine-mesh cloths to 
filter tinctures or oils, separating the spent herbs (that have all medici-
nal chemicals removed) from the finished oil or tincture.
 
 Funnel: A funnel is helpful for pouring finished oils or tinctures into 
small-mouthed bottles, such as a 1-ounce dropper bottle.
 
 Scale: A weighing scale (in grams or ounces) is essential if you want to 
keep track of exactly how much herb you used to make a batch of tinc-
ture or oil. Knowing the weight enables you to make your next batch 
stronger or weaker by adding more or less herbs to the same amount 
of liquid oil or alcohol/water blend. Keep good records by writing these 
amounts in a small notebook.
 
 Candy thermometer: A candy thermometer helps you know just when 
to turn the heat off from a batch of herbal candy (like horehound candy 
for coughs) and pour it into the molds. If you pour the liquid candy too 
early, before all the water is removed, your finished candy will be sticky.
 
 Candy molds: Candy molds are available in a variety of different shapes 
from kitchen shops. Plain, round ones are good because candies of that 
shape are easy to wrap with a little waxed paper and put into a small 
box to carry in your pocket or purse.

Book VI: Natural Health 
Stocking Your Pantry
To make herbal products such as tinctures, salves, or creams, you need a 
variety of supplies both to create the extract and then perhaps to thicken it. 
Be sure to stock the items listed in the following sections.
Oils
For making herbal oils, salves, and creams, buy good-quality oils that won’t 
go rancid quickly. Try to avoid polyunsaturated oils (canola, sunflower, and 
safflower oils) because they’re sensitive to heat and light and degrade rap-
idly. Store your oils in the refrigerator to avoid rancidity.
 
 Sweet almond oil: A light oil, less greasy than olive oil, and a favorite for 
making medicated oils. Almond oil is especially soothing, and it helps 
relieve dryness and itching.
 
 Apricot kernel oil: A light oil more delicate than almond and often more 
expensive. Apricot kernel oil is blended with almond or other oils at 
about 10 to 50 percent of the total to lighten it up. This oil is excellent to 
use if you have sensitive skin.
 
 Avocado oil: A heavy, long-lasting oil for the skin. Avocado oil contains 
vitamins for the skin and adds a rich, dark green color to salves, creams, 
and other products.
 
 Carrot oil: A light oil that slows aging of the skin.
 
 Castor oil: A heavy, highly therapeutic oil. The oil contains toxic 
protein-like compounds called lectins, which when applied to the skin 
are absorbed and stimulate a local immune response to help break 
down a tumor or cyst. Use up to 20 percent in an oil blend.
 
 Cocoa butter: Obtained from the cocoa bean and used in lotion, cream, 
lip balm, and soap. Cocoa butter contains highly saturated fatty acids, 
so it’s heavy and resists rancidity. It also smells of chocolate, which is 
good news to chocolate lovers.
 
 If you find the smell of cocoa butter overwhelming, use no more than 15 
to 20 percent in your product.
 
 Coconut oil: Tropical oil that’s semisolid at room temperature. Use it 
to thicken your creams and other skin products and to give them body. 
Coconut oil is one of the most stable oils and doesn’t easily go rancid in 
your products.

585

Natural 
Health
 
 Grapeseed oil: An almost colorless, vitamin-rich oil that’s easily 
absorbed. The oil is made from the seeds of the fruit. Grapeseed oil has 
a good texture, making it ideal for massage oils.
 
 Olive oil: The finest all-around oil for making medicated oils. What could 
be more natural than crushing the olives to release the nutritious and 
heart-friendly yellow-green oil? Many other oils require solvent extrac-
tion or heating during extraction, even when the product says expeller-
pressed or cold-pressed. Olive oil stays fresh longer than other oils and is 
excellent for people with naturally dry skin.
 
 Olive oil is a heavy oil that sometimes has a decided scent of olives. If 
the scent and oily feel are pleasant to you, fine — but they may make 
you feel like a walking salad.
 
 Jojoba oil: A wax that’s traditionally used as a hair restorer but that’s 
also an excellent moisturizer for dry skin. It’s usually diluted by half with 
other oils for massage oils.
 
 Palm kernel oil: A heavy oil, containing mostly saturated fatty acids 
and a good quantity of vitamin A, which is a natural skin protector and 
cancer fighter. Add palm kernel oil to products to give them a thick, 
creamy feeling and to protect your skin.
 
Choose cold-pressed organic oils whenever they’re available. Also, try using 
organic oils rather than commercial oils, which are made with harsh solvents 
that extract the oil from the seed mash.
Grain alcohol
Grain alcohol is absolutely the best solvent and delivery system to carry an 
herb’s active constituents into the bloodstream. Vodka is the most effective 
distilled liquor for making tinctures or alcoholic herbal extracts. For home 
use, tinctures and elixirs can be made with 100-proof vodka, which is the 
most widely available. (Keep in mind that 100-proof vodka actually contains a 
little less than 50 percent ethanol by volume; 80-proof vodka contains a little 
less than 40 percent.)
Even better than vodka is pure grain alcohol, which is distilled from corn. Pure 
grain alcohol is 190-proof, or a little less than 95 percent pure alcohol. The 
reason it’s not 100-percent pure is because absolutely pure alcohol always 
pulls some moisture from the air, and the solution stabilizes at 95 percent.
Other kinds of alcoholic beverages such as rum and brandy aren’t ideal 
because they already contain coloring pigments, flavoring compounds, 
sugars, and other components.

586
Book VI: Natural Health 
 
The proportion of alcohol to water is often adjusted in order to selectively pull 
out the desired constituents. For instance, resins such as bee propolis and 
the active constituents of milk thistle are only alcohol-soluble. Using a solvent 
with a high percentage of pure ethanol or grain alcohol yields the best extrac-
tion. For ginseng, which has active steroidlike compounds that are mostly 
water-soluble, you’d choose a solvent that contains a fairly low percentage of 
alcohol (45–50 percent alcohol to 50–55 percent water).
Glycerin
Good-quality glycerin from vegetable sources is widely available in natural-
foods stores and pharmacies. Glycerin adds body and a little sweetness to 
herbal preparations such as cough syrups and elixirs. It’s often added to 
creams and helps bring oils and tinctures together in a smooth, easy-to-apply 
blend. For folks who like taking a liquid herbal product but don’t want alco-
hol, glycerin can dissolve certain plant constituents and act as a reasonably 
good preservative. Many flavored herbal glycerites, especially those for chil-
dren, are available in natural-foods stores and herb stores. These products 
are helpful for parents who want a good-tasting, liquid preparation that’s 
easy to disguise in juice. In these products, flavorful essential oils like orange 
or cinnamon are often added to the glycerin and herb blends.
On the downside, glycerin isn’t as good a solvent or preservative as alcohol. 
Further, glycerin can be drying and irritating to the mucous membranes when 
used undiluted — as can alcoholic preparations. Finally, glycerin isn’t as effec-
tive a carrier of the active herbal constituents into the body as alcohol.
 
All in all, glycerites are recommended only for children or for people who 
can’t take any alcohol.
Beeswax
Beeswax is used to harden salves and creams and turn them into a suitable 
consistency. Here’s what you want to look for when purchasing beeswax:
 
 Wax that’s pure and free from chips of paint, dirt, rocks, and dead insect 
parts. (Hives may be painted with lead-based paint.)
 
 Wax that’s a light amber color and has the delightful fragrance of honey 
with a slightly gluey smell.
You can buy beeswax at your local hobby shop, herb shop, or natural-foods 
store. Some grocery stores also carry it. Or you can try looking in the yellow 
pages of your phone book under “beekeepers” for sources of good beeswax.

Essential oils
You can achieve an appealing, inviting smell in your herbal body products 
through the use of essential oils, which are extracts of plants containing 
essential oils. Try the citrus family members (orange, lemon, and grapefruit), 
mints (peppermint and spearmint), wintergreen, and lavender.
Miscellaneous ingredients
Other items you may need for making herbal products include
 
 Honey, which is soothing to the throat and is a common ingredient in 
herbal cough syrups and throat lozenges.
 
 Brown rice syrup, which is available in natural-foods stores and is used 
in the same ways as honey. It’s less sweet with more complex sugars. 
Brown rice syrup is a good choice if you have diabetes or another blood 
sugar imbalance.
 
 Ascorbic acid, which is also known as vitamin C powder. It acts as a 
mild preservative for herbal creams.
 
 Borax, which is a natural substance (commonly used for washing 
clothes) that you can use to help oily and watery ingredients mix 
together. It makes your herbal creams creamy.
Making Teas
Blending an herbal tea is a pleasant, healthy ritual that encourages you to 
slow down a little and smell the herbs — no capsule or tablet can do that! 
The next few sections show you how to prepare different herbal teas.
Infusions
Infusions are a simple way of preparing tea from leaves and flowers. To make 
an infusion, do the following:
 
1. Pour boiling water over the herb and let it steep, covered, for 10 to 15 
minutes.
 
 Use 1 teaspoon herb per cup of water.

588
Book VI: Natural Health 
 
2. Pour the tea through a strainer into a teacup.
 
 You can also store your herb tea in the refrigerator for two to 
three days.
Herbs commonly used for infusions include peppermint, chamomile, lemon 
balm, raspberry leaf, and red clover.
 
An Infusion of Calmness
This combination of herbs is formulated to infuse a feeling of calmness throughout your 
body and spirit. Drink a cup several times a day, or just before bed.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 cups
4 cups boiling water
3 teaspoons linden flower
3 teaspoons chamomile herb
3 teaspoons eleuthero root
3 teaspoons passion flower
3 teaspoons orange peel
1⁄2 teaspoon stevia herb
 1 Pour the boiling water over the herbs, roots, flowers, and peels and cover the pan.
 2 Let the brew steep for 15 minutes.
 3 Strain the mixture and serve.
 
Elderflower Tea
Elderflower tea makes a good-tasting beverage with gentle cleansing power. Drink a cup 
or two several times a day to assist your body in getting rid of toxic waste products 
when you’re going through a healing crisis or any time you want an easy yet efficient 
cleansing of your system.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 cups
4 cups water
4 tablespoons dried elderflower

 1 Boil the water in a covered pan.
 2 Turn off the heat, add the elderflower, and allow it to steep (covered) for 15 minutes.
 3 Strain the mixture and store what you don’t use in the refrigerator.
Vary It! Try adding a teaspoon of stevia (often referred to as “the sweet herb”) to every 4 
tablespoons of elderflower for extra sweetness.
Decoctions
A decoction is a method of extracting the heavier and denser parts of plants 
such as roots, barks, and twigs. To make a decoction, do the following:
 
1. Add 1 tablespoon of an herb or herb mixture (coarsely chopped or 
ground) to each cup of boiling water and simmer.
 
 Thin barks, like willow bark, need only 15 or 20 minutes of gentle sim-
mering. Thicker chunks of root, like ginseng, need 1 hour of simmering 
to extract all the active constituents.
 
2. Turn off the heat and let the mixture steep for 15 minutes or so until 
it’s cool enough to handle.
 
3. Pour the mixture through a strainer and add the herb residue to your 
compost pile.
Herbs generally made as a decoction include licorice, yellow dock, dandelion 
root, and ginseng root.
 
Tonic herbs and herb formulas support and nourish your body systems. Take 
tonic teas for three to nine months to receive the full effects. Take the herbs 
daily for maximum benefits. Don’t use tonic herbs during an acute infection. 
Begin again after the main part of the infection is over to bolster your immune 
system.
 
Decoctions are a time-honored way of using tonic herbs. In China, decoctions 
of the tonic herb dong quai are used as a base to make vegetable chicken 
soups. The vegetables, grains, and chicken take on the medicinal qualities 
of the herb. By eating the soup, you get all the benefits of the food and the 
medicinal effects of the dong quai, such as building the blood, increasing 
energy levels, and strengthening the uterus.

Immune Vitali-Tea
This decoction can be used daily for six to nine months to strengthen your natural 
defenses against colds, flu, and other diseases. Drink 1 cup, morning and evening.
Preparation time: 11⁄2 hours
Yield: 4 cups
3 to 4 sticks astragalus root
1 tablespoon ligustrum
3 to 4 roots codonopsis (about 4–5 inches 
long)
1 tablespoon burdock root
1 teaspoon licorice
5 cups water
 1 Simmer all the herbal ingredients in the water for 30 to 60 minutes.
 2 Turn off the heat and let the tea steep (covered) for an additional 15 minutes.
 3 Strain and pour into a quart jar for storage in the refrigerator.
Light decoctions
For lighter barks and hard leaves, or to remove heavier compounds from 
leaves and flowers, make a light decoction by doing the following:
 
1. Place the herbs in water and simmer on the lowest heat possible, 
covered, for 10 to 15 minutes.
 
 Use 2 tablespoons of the herb per 1 cup of water.
 
2. Turn off the heat and let the mixture steep (covered) for an additional 
10 to 15 minutes.
 
3. Strain the entire mixture and drink. Store whatever’s left in the 
refrigerator — it keeps for up to three days.

Pass-on-Gas Tea
This delicious tea is a favorite with many people for preventing gas after meals, as well 
as helping to ease gas pains and abdominal discomfort. Drink 1⁄2 to 1 cup of the tea after 
meals to help relieve that feeling of fullness.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Yield: 3 cups
4 cups water
1 teaspoon cumin seed
1 teaspoon fennel seed
1 teaspoon caraway seed
1 teaspoon orange peel
1⁄2 teaspoon licorice root
 1 Bring the water to a boil and add the herbs. Simmer in the water, covered, for 10 
minutes.
 2 Remove from the heat and steep the mixture (covered) for another 10 to 15 minutes.
 3 Strain the mixture. Drink immediately, or store for later use.
Vary It! After you turn the heat off, add 2 teaspoons of peppermint leaf.
Mastering the Art of Tincture-Making
Tinctures are made by grinding up dry or fresh herbs in a solvent of alcohol 
and water or glycerin. Tinctures have several advantages over other types of 
herbal products. Their medicinal properties are easily absorbed by the body; 
they have a long shelf life (up to three years); they act quickly on your body; 
and they’re easy to use — 1-ounce bottles fit in your pocket. The usual pro-
cess for making a tincture is as follows:
 
1. Place the herbs in a blender and add the solvent.
 
 A tincture is made with five parts solvent liquid volume to one part herb 
by dry weight.
 
 See the earlier “Stocking Your Pantry” section for tips on choosing 
a solvent.

592
Book VI: Natural Health 
 
2. Blend at high speed until smooth.
 
3. Place the mixture in a warm area that’s out of direct sunlight.
 
4. Shake daily for at least two weeks.
 
5. Squeeze any liquid out through a linen cloth or press it out with a 
hydraulic press, such as a cider press.
 
6. Filter the remaining mixture, if desired.
 
7. Compost or discard the spent herb (the marc).
 
You can add more dry herb to the solvent to make a stronger tincture. Keep 
adding the herb to the liquid and blend. After soaking, the herb settles out. 
Keep at least 1⁄2 inch of pure solvent over the herb. If the herb sticks up out of 
the solvent at any time, your tincture may ferment and produce an off flavor.
One teaspoonful (about 5 droppersful) of a tincture has approximately the 
same potency as one strong cup of tea. The average adult dose of most tinc-
tures is about 1 to 3 droppersful, two to three times daily, for health mainte-
nance and about twice that (4 to 6 droppersful, four to five times daily) for a 
therapeutic dose when you’re treating a specific medical condition. Adjust 
the dose for children according to age and weight.
Store tinctures in amber bottles to minimize the adverse effects of sunlight 
on their important medicinal components. They can keep their potency for 
up to three years if you store them in a cool place away from heat and light.
 
Put 1 teaspoon of the tincture in 1 cup of warm water to make an instant tea — 
even when you’re on the move and away from your kitchen.
 
Echinacea Leaf and Flower Tincture
This widely used tincture helps strengthen the body’s natural defenses. Use it to pre-
vent and help heal colds, flu, respiratory ailments, urinary tract infections, and other 
types of infections.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 6 ounces
11⁄2 ounces dried echinacea leaves (and 
flowers if available)
1⁄2 cup grain alcohol (or 100-proof vodka)
1⁄2 cup distilled water

593

Health
 1 Combine the echinacea, alcohol, and water in a blender.
 2 Blend for about 1 to 2 minutes, or until smooth.
 3 Pour into a quart canning jar or other suitable container.
 4 Shake the blend vigorously for 1 minute every day for two weeks. Be sure to keep the 
mixture out of sunlight and in a warm place.
 5 Press or squeeze the blend through a piece of linen or other fine cloth.
 6 Transfer the finished tincture to an amber dropper bottle. Keep away from heat and 
light; refrigeration isn’t necessary.
Vary It! If you prefer a stronger echinacea tincture with more of a bite, add echinacea root 
to the leaves and flowers. Use the roots only for the most potent tincture; the leaves and 
flowers are potent enough for most situations.
The best herbs to make into tinctures
Herbalists choose some herbs over and over 
again for use in making tinctures. These herbs 
are usually more potent in tincture form than 
in teas.
  Orange peel, stevia, and licorice: These are 
great flavoring herbs to add to any of your 
tinctures. Orange tincture eases digestive 
discomforts, helps relieve gas pains, and 
has a mildly calming effect. Stevia helps 
you manage an out-of-control sweet tooth. 
Licorice soothes your stomach and diges-
tive tract.
  Ginkgo: It’s used to improve memory, 
enhance mental function, and increase cir-
culation to your legs.
  Milk thistle: Made from the seeds, milk 
thistle tincture has a protective and rebuild-
ing effect on your liver.
  Valerian: It’s probably the most popular 
herb for inducing sleep and relaxation.
  Kava: This herb helps to relax your muscles 
and improve sleep.
  American ginseng: It counteracts stress 
and helps support adrenal function.
  Goldenseal/barberry: Goldenseal is popular 
for easing infections of the sinuses, bladder, 
intestines, and respiratory tract. Goldenseal 
is endangered in some states because of 
overharvesting. For this reason, use only 
10- to 20-percent goldenseal along with 80- 
to 90-percent barberry root, Oregon grape 
root, or coptis root (a Chinese herb). These 
herbs all have the same active principles as 
goldenseal.
  Ginger: This hot, spicy tincture helps to 
ease an upset stomach and promotes good 
digestion.
  Dong quai: One of the most popular herbs of 
all time, dong quai has a general strength-
ening effect on your energy and helps build 
healthy blood. For women, dong quai has a 
building effect on the uterus.
  St. John’s wort: This is a popular herb for 
lifting your mood and helping to ease mild 
to moderate depression.

Preparing Herbal Cough Syrup
Herbal cough syrups are sweet and thick and contain concentrates of herbs 
that help soothe inflamed tissues, calm coughs, fight infections, and eliminate 
thick, clogging mucus. You can buy a number of herbal cough syrups from 
your local herb store or pharmacy, but you can’t find one that’s as effective 
as the following classic: Horehound Hack-Free Cough Syrup.
Do fresh or dry herbs make a more potent tincture?
Whether to use fresh herbs or dry ones is a 
debate that rages on among herbalists. Some 
contend that a number of herbs are more potent 
when tinctured fresh. This claim has been dis-
proven by laboratory tests — most herbs make 
a more potent extract when extracted or tinc-
tured freshly dried. Freshly dried means that the 
plants are harvested at the peak of perfection 
(in full flower, in the fall for roots, and so on), 
and then carefully dried in the shade. If these 
herbs are tinctured within two to three weeks 
of drying and are kept away from heat and light, 
they can be called freshly dried.
You can find exceptions, however — sensitive 
herbs (chickweed, gotu kola, cleavers, and the 
roots of Echinacea angustifolia) are best when 
tinctured fresh, not freshly dried. For tincturing 
fresh, undried herbs, add the plant material to 
the solvent and blend well until you have only 
about 1/2 to1 inch of clear liquid over the settled 
solid material.
 
Horehound Hack-Free Cough Syrup
Ever had a hacking cough that kept you up at night? This classic horehound recipe is 
similar to ones available commercially. But although commercial products contain 
horehound, sage, and wild cherry bark, they don’t work nearly as well as this formula. 
They just don’t have enough horehound or sage in them to do the job.
Preparation time: 11⁄2 hours
Yield: 21⁄2 cups
1⁄4 ounce mullein
1⁄4 ounce echinacea
1⁄8 ounce sage
1⁄16 ounce horehound
1⁄4 ounce orange peel
1⁄8 ounce licorice root
1⁄4 ounce wild cherry bark
4 cups water
2 cups honey
7 drops orange essential oil
3 drops eucalyptus oil
3 drops peppermint essential oil
 1 Combine the herbs and water in a pot and simmer on low heat for 10 minutes.

 2 Turn off the heat and steep (covered) for 20 minutes. Strain the mixture and return it to 
the pot.
 3 Simmer the strained tea uncovered on low heat for 30 to 60 minutes, until approxi-
mately 1/2 cup of liquid remains.
 4 Stir in the honey, orange oil, eucalyptus oil, and peppermint oil.
 5 After the mixture cools, pour it into a bottle and store it in the refrigerator. Your syrup 
should last for a month or two.
Vary It! If the syrup tastes too strong for you or your kids, add another 1⁄2 cup of honey and 
more orange essential oil.
Producing Elixirs
Elixirs are a combination of an alcohol-based tincture and honey, raw sugar, 
maple syrup, or another sweetener. Good-tasting elixirs are made to help 
moderate the bitter taste of certain herbs for children and adults.
 
High-Energy Elixir
This herbal elixir combines some of the best energy herbs, nerve-support herbs,

If you can’t find readymade tinctures, or if you find them too expensive, you 
can make your own (see the section “Mastering the Art of Tincture-Making” 
earlier in this chapter).
Concocting Creams
Creams are light and moisturizing and are made by blending distilled water 
or a water-based herbal extract (such as rosewater or a simmered-down 
tea concentrate) with oily ingredients (such as almond oil, cocoa butter, or 
beeswax) at high speed — just like you make mayonnaise. You can make a 
simmered-down tea concentrate by making a decoction of an herb (see the 
“Decoctions” section earlier in this chapter), filtering out the herb after sim-
mering for 30 minutes to 1 hour, and simmering for another hour or two until 
the tea is reduced to about 10 percent of its original volume.
Creams can be astringent, moisturizing, antifungal, or antibacterial. They 
can also speed up healing of wounds, burns, abrasions, and cuts. To prevent 
contaminating a cream in the preparation process, wash your hands and all 
utensils in an antiseptic soap beforehand.
You can extend the life of homemade creams with these practical:
 
 Prohibit mold growth through refrigeration. Herbal preparations that 
are made with water are susceptible to mold growth after a few weeks 
(even less in a warm climate). Keeping your cream in the refrigerator 
extends its life by up to three times.
 
 Add life-extending ingredients. If your cream contains at least 1/2 teaspoon 
of any of the following, it’ll last up to six months without refrigeration:
 
• Rosewater or other aromatic herb water
 
• Tincture
 
• A preservative such as grapefruit seed extract, citric acid, vitamin 
C, or vitamin E
 
 Boost the vitamin content. Vitamins C and E make a good preservative 
combination. They work well together to preserve both the oily and 
watery parts of the cream. Plus, vitamin C helps vitamin E extend its 
antioxidant properties, preventing the oils in your creams from going 
rancid.

Fabulous Moisturizing Cream
This cream adds moisture to the skin, preventing chapping and drying.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: 8 ounces
Oil-Soluble Ingredients (Oily Phase)
1 ounce coconut oil
4 ounces almond oil
1 ounce beeswax
10 to 20 drops essential oil, such as 
lavender or rose
Water-Soluble Ingredients (Watery Phase)
2 ounces distilled water, rosewater, or 
orangewater
2 ounces glycerin
1 teaspoon borax
1⁄2 teaspoon vitamin C powder
Eight 1-ounce salve jars
 1 Melt the coconut oil, almond oil, and beeswax together in a pan. Set aside to cool. After 
the mixture cools for 15 minutes, add the essential oil.
 2 In a separate pan, combine the water, glycerin, borax, and vitamin C powder and heat 
the mixture over low heat until warm.
 3 Place the water mixture in a blender and blend at high speed for 30 to 60 seconds. 
Remove the small inset top from the blender cover and slowly drizzle the oil mixture 
(from Step 1) through hole while blending.
 4 Blend until the cream is well-mixed; then pour it into the jars.
 5 Let the cream cool before capping and labeling the jars.
Tip: Keep the temperature of the oily phase and the watery phase as identical as possible — 
160 to 175 degrees is about right. After pouring your cream into the jars, avoid capping until 
the cream is completely cool; otherwise, the watery phase is more likely to separate.

Aromatherapy Cream
If you don’t feel inclined to start completely from scratch, try your hand at this cream. 
It’s easy to make, and you can customize it by adding your favorite essential oils. Try 
substituting your favorite commercial facial or skin cream for the unscented cream to 
make a fragrant or healing herbal facial or skin cream.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 ounces
4 ounces unscented cream
15 to 20 drops essential oil (rosemary, 
lavender, orange, myrrh, or cedar)
 1 Place the container of unscented cream in hot water (about 100 degrees) until it 
becomes a liquid. Alternatively, you can spoon the cream into the top of a double boiler 
and slowly heat it until it turns liquid.
 2 Add one or more of the essential oils.
 3 Stir all ingredients together, allow to cool, and return the cream to the original 
container.
Vary It! Try the following variations:
 
 Add thyme or tea tree oil for treating cuts, infections, and fungus.
 
 Stir in rosemary oil, 1/2 teaspoon St. John’s wort oil, and vitamin E to pro-
tect the skin from sun damage.
 
 Blend in a little cayenne powder and rosemary oil for sore muscles.

help cool the itching and burning of rashes, for example from poison ivy or 
poison oak.
 
 Add 2 teaspoons calendula cream to help protect your skin and prevent 
wrinkling.
 
 Blend in 2 tablespoons aloe vera gel to make a lotion from your cream that 
can help moisturize dry skin and help soothe and heal a sunburn.

Creating Infused Herbal Oils for the Skin
Soaking — also called macerating — recently dried herbs in a vegetable oil 
makes a medicated herbal oil. The most popular herbal oils include arnica, 
St. John’s wort, and calendula. Here’s what you need to know about making 
and using these preparations for external use:
 
 Herbal oils are made by grinding the freshly dried herbs into a coarse 
powder and stirring them into an oil heated to about 100 degrees.
 
 The strongest oils are made by macerating the herbs for three to five 
days, stirring daily for a few minutes each day. If you don’t have a crock-
pot and are heating the oil on the stove, put the blend on first thing in 
the morning and take it off just before bedtime, giving the herbs a good 
12 hours to macerate in the hot oil. Leave the burner on low, preferably 
on top of a heat diffuser. Stir the blend every few hours.
 
 Add essential oils with antibacterial, antifungal, and blood circulation–
stimulating properties, such as rosemary, thyme, lavender, or tea tree.
 
 Herbal oils can be used to help soothe rashes, sunburns, and other skin 
irritation and to help ease the pain of strains, sprains, and sore muscles 
while speeding healing. Apply the oils liberally to the affected areas, 
twice daily. The oils have the added benefit of lubricating the skin and 
helping prevent it from drying out.
 
Herbal oils are a good place to start when making medicinal herbal products 
for external use because they’re a key component in creams, lotions, salves, 
and ointments, and you can make them quickly and easily.
To make an herbal oil, first decide which of these medicated oils works best 
for your needs. Several are popular, and each has its own benefits.
 
 St. John’s wort oil: A beautiful red oil that’s effective for easing the pain 
and inflammation of burns, stings, rashes, bites, and scrapes. A recipe 
for making your own St. John’s wort oil is given later in this chapter, or 
you can buy it at natural-foods stores.
 
 Tea tree oil: A strong antiseptic oil that helps quell infections of all 
kinds. Apply a few drops with a cotton swab. The preparation works 
well for athlete’s foot.

600
Book VI: Natural Health 
 
 Ginger oil: Add 2 or 3 drops of ginger and lavender essential oil to a 
teaspoon of calendula oil and apply to minor burns to help speed up the 
healing process and relieve pain.
 
 Eucalyptus, pennyroyal, and citronella: Add 2 or 3 drops of each oil to 
a teaspoon of calendula oil (which also repels insects) and brush lightly 
on clothing to repel mosquitoes and other biting insects.
 
 Brush the repellant oil only on materials that the oil won’t stain.
 
St. John’s Wort Oil
The golden yellow flowers of St. John’s wort appear at the height of summer, about June 
24, which is traditionally St. John’s Day. This oil has been made with similar recipes for 
more than 2,000 years.
This is a favorite oil to have in the medicine chest and to take along on trips for easing 
the pain and speeding healing of many kinds of injuries to the skin, joints, and nerves.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 8 ounces
11/2 cups St. John’s wort flowers
2 cups olive (preferred), almond, 
or apricot oil
 1 Coarsely grind up the flowers in a blender.
 2 Add the oil and blend until smooth.
 3 Pour the blend into a quart jar or other container and place in a warm spot out of direct 
sunlight.
 4 Shake vigorously for 1 minute every day for two to three weeks.
 5 Press out the oil through a fine strainer or cloth. If you want your oil to be completely 
clear, filter through an unbleached coffee filter. Bottle for use.
Note: If after two weeks of maceration, your St. John’s wort oil is pink rather than a rich red 
color, set it in bright sunlight for one or two days to see whether it changes color. If it’s still 
pale, press out the herbs and blend another batch of dried herbs with the oil. Let the new 
batch of herbs soak for another two weeks; then press the herbs out again through a fine 
strainer or cloth. If the oil still isn’t red, then the flowers were of poor quality. Try to harvest 
or buy another batch of St. John’s wort and repeat the process, or use the product anyway, 
with the awareness that it isn’t as strong. The best flowers you can use are ones you 
harvest from your garden or local wild area. If you use fresh or freshly dried herbs (see 
the sidebar “Do fresh or dry herbs make a more potent tincture?”), you can make a deep 
red oil.

When you’re short on time, you can easily create medicated herbal oils for your 
individual needs by buying readymade herbal oils such as arnica, calendula, 
and St. John’s wort and adding a few drops of your choice of essential oils.
 
Muscle Pain Oil
Use this wonderful oil whenever you’ve overworked your muscles and need some relief.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 ounce
1/3 ounce arnica oil
2/3 ounce St. John’s wort oil
10 drops essential oil of wintergreen
 1 Combine all ingredients in a covered container and shake vigorously for 1 minute.
 2 Apply as needed to aching muscles.
Making Massage Oils
If you can’t afford regular massages, take a class on how to give them and 
trade massages with a friend. Massage shows you where you’re holding ten-
sion and helps you let it go, thereby freeing up energy and reducing pain.
Create an aromatherapy massage by adding essential oils to a fixed oil such 
as sweet almond oil. An aromatherapy massage promotes circulation and is a 
popular, pleasant way to receive the healing and aromatic benefits of essen-
tial oils.
 
After receiving an aromatherapy massage, you may want to wait three or four 
hours before showering in order to give the oils time for complete absorption.
Make your own massage oil by adding your choice of essential oil or oils to 
a carrier oil, such as sweet almond, grapeseed, or apricot kernel. Favorite 
oils for massage include vanilla, chamomile, rose, and lavender. Feel free to 
experiment and blend different oils to create your own special formulas.
 
Ten drops of essential oils for every ounce of oil makes a mildly scented oil. If 
you add too much oil, your massage oil can have an annoying smell.

Heaven-Scent Massage Oil
If you don’t have any specific ideas about your ideal essential oil massage blend, try 
this wonderful, relaxing massage oil to help reduce tension and the pain of sore 
muscles.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 ounces
30 drops lavender essential oil
25 drops chamomile essential oil
15 drops ginger essential oil
15 drops rosemary essential oil
3 ounces almond oil
1 ounce St. John’s wort oil
 1 In a covered container, add the essential oils to the almond oil and St. John’s wort oil; 
shake well.
 2 Place a small amount in the palm, rub into both palms and fingers, and then massage 
evenly into the body.
 3 After the massage, leave the therapeutic oil on the body for at least 30 minutes before 
showering or rubbing off with a towel. If you have the time, leave it on for up to 4 hours 
for complete absorption.
Aromatherapy Baths: 
A Stirring Experience
After a long, tiring day, few activities are as luxurious and relaxing as soak-
ing in a hot bath — especially when you add healing essential oils. Bathing 
with essential oils is an effective method for opening up congested pores and 
easing muscle tension as you breathe the vapors and absorb the oils through 
the skin. Bathing with essential oils also relaxes your tired body, quiets your 
mind, and calms the spirit. Soak long enough, though, because you need 
approximately 10 to 20 minutes for essential oils to reach the bloodstream.
Customize your essential oil bath according to your desires at the moment. 
Whether you’re feeling tense after a long day or having trouble sleeping, try 
taking a lavender bath, preferably by candlelight, just before you go to bed. 
Lavender is the premiere plant scent for relaxing and uplifting the spirits.
 
To avoid evaporation of the oils, add them when the tub is full, close the door 
and windows to keep the aromatic steam in, and then get right into the bath.

To dilute strong essential oils and help prevent hot water from drying your 
skin, mix your essential oils with a small amount of fixed oil before putting 
them in the tub. A good blend is 5 to 10 drops of one or more essential oils for 
every teaspoon of almond oil or apricot kernel oil. Mix it up in a tablespoon 
measure and add it right to the bath. You may want to make up 6 or 8 ounces 
of your favorite blend to have it ready and waiting.
Try these healing and relaxing aromatherapy baths:
 
 Colds and flu: Eucalyptus, thyme, lemon, and rosemary
 
 Depression: Lavender, basil, lemon balm, rose, neroli, patchouli, and 
clary sage
 
 Nervousness: Geranium, lavender, clary sage, lemon balm, and orange
 
 Pain: Rosemary, chamomile, cayenne oil, and ginger
 
 Stimulating, energizing bath: Rosemary, bergamot, and lime
 
 Stress: Neroli, lavender, and chamomile
 
 Tense muscles: Rosemary, marjoram, lavender, and chamomile
For a foot or hand bath, add 4 to 8 drops of oil to a bowl filled with warm 
water and stir the water to mix the oils. Soak feet or hands for 15 minutes and 
relax.
 
Bath Salts
Bath salts dissolve into the bath and help soften your skin while you enjoy the 
therapeutic benefits of an aromatic bath.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 3 cups
1/2 cup Epsom salts
2 1/4 cups sea salt or table salt
1/2 cup powdered milk
1/2 teaspoon lavender or rosemary 
essential oil (or a combination of the two)
 1 Bottle the ingredients and let them stand for a week to ten days.
 2 Add 1/4 cup of bath salts to your bath and enjoy!

Formulating a Hair Rinse
When you apply apple cider vinegar to your hair, you’re using a time-honored 
rinse that removes excess oil, dust, and flakes of skin, while gently preventing 
bacteria growth.
 
Nature Scent Freshener
You can easily make your own air freshener or spray disinfectant with a few essential 
oils, a spray bottle, and distilled water.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
 
Rosemary Hair Rinse
The rosemary oil in this recipe makes a rinse that improves the health and nutrition of 
the hair follicles while leaving your hair smelling inviting and fresh.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 cups
2 cups apple cider vinegar
2 cups distilled water
10 drops rosemary essential oil
 1 Blend rosemary essential oil with the apple cider vinegar and water to make a hair 
rinse.
 2 Work the rinse into your hair thoroughly after shampooing and then rinse with pure 
water.
Savoring Sprays and Mists
The scent of a fresh apple pie baking in the oven is an inviting scent that 
everyone appreciates. Other odors, like that six-day-old burrito forgotten in 
a corner of the refrigerator or certain bathroom odors you’d rather forget, 
aren’t so pleasant. Commercial air fresheners, however, are often worse than 
the smell you want to cover — the heavy chemical smell of artificial flow-
ers created in the laboratory does little to create a pleasant fragrance. Try 
making an herbal air freshener instead.

Producing Potpourris
Potpourris are flowers and flower petals impregnated with aromatic oils. 
Potpourris are pretty to look at in dishes and pleasant to smell. Available in 
gift shops and department stores as well as natural-foods stores, scented pot-
pourris are quite popular.
Creating your own potpourris is easy and fun and allows you the option of 
using pure essential oils. Make simple potpourris for your living room or 
bathroom by combining rose petals sprinkled with rose oil or lavender flow-
ers sprinkled with lavender oil. Add 1/2 teaspoon essential oil for every 2 cups 
of flowers or herbs.
 
Rose Petal Potpourri
Here’s a recipe for a brightly colored potpourri that you can vary to suit your individual 
taste. The orris root powder is used as a fixative, an herb that makes fragrances last 
longer.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: About 4 cups
4 cups mixed dried herbs (choose from 
lavender, roses, calendula flowers, rosemary 
leaves, rose hips, lemon verbena leaves, and so 
on)
4 tablespoons orris root powder
1 teaspoon essential oils of your choice (rose, 
lavender, geranium, orange, and so on)
 1 Combine the ingredients in a zip-top plastic bag.
 2 Shake the ingredients lightly for a moment.
 3 Let sit for seven to ten days to allow the essential oils to be absorbed.
 4 Pour the contents of the bag into a small, decorative bowl and place it on the toilet 
tank, bathroom counter, kitchen counter, bedroom nightstand, or any place that you 
want to create a special mood with scent.
 
When the scent of your potpourri starts to fade, repeat the process with the 
essential oils.
To occasionally freshen your carpet, mix 1/2 cup baking soda with 60 drops laven-
der, 20 drops orange, and 20 drops cedar. Allow to stand for 24 hours and then 
sprinkle the mixture over the carpet. Let it sit for 15 minutes before vacuuming.

Making a Compress
An herbalist reported having worked with an 80-year-old female patient who 
looked 60, took care of her health, but was suffering because of a knee joint 
that had been replaced two years before and was still swollen, sore, and 
stiff. She was a dancer who liked to go out on Saturday nights, and the knee 
was cramping her style. She had tried steroid anti-inflammatories and other 
modern medicines with no luck, and her doctor told her, “Get used to it.” So 
she sought the advice of an acupuncturist and herbalist, who gave her one of 
the most simple yet effective remedies ever devised — the ginger compress. 
The next time the herbalist saw the 80-year-old patient, she was walking 
much better and had become a big fan of the ginger compress. As she left the 
office, she asked him, “Do you dance?”
 
Ginger Oil Compress
Use this ginger oil compress for easing pain, soreness, swelling, and stiffness of arthri-
tis, injuries, and operations. The compress also works well for sprains, strains, and 
even bruises.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 cups
1/4 cup fresh ginger root (sliced)
4 cups water
5 drops ginger essential oil (optional)
 1 Simmer the ginger root with the water in a covered pot for 20 minutes. Add the ginger 
oil if you want a more potent compress and stir well.
 2 Soak a washcloth in the hot gingery tea and wrap it around a tender or sore area, 
resoaking the cloth and applying several times before the tea cools. Repeat several 
times a day as time permits.
Vary It! Submerge a washcloth in a bowl of water containing 10 to 20 drops of your favorite 
essential oil to make other aromatherapy compresses. Hot compresses are useful for 
muscular pain and cramp relief; cold compresses are useful for treating swelling or head-
ache. Try chamomile, rosemary, or juniper for muscle pain; lavender for headache; and 
ginger for swelling.

Simmering Your Own Salves
Salves are medicinal ointments made from an herbal oil and beeswax. (The 
beeswax helps thicken the salve, makes it more spreadable, and increases 
the time that it lasts on your skin, allowing the medicinal action of the herbs 
to have a greater effect.) A salve can be thin and creamy, a form that’s known 
as an ointment and is placed in tubes or squeeze bottles for dispensing. It can 
also be of a harder consistency, which is placed in a salve jar or tin. Salves 
don’t contain many water-soluble components that fungi and bacteria can 
feed on, so they tend to be more stable than creams.
 
Protective and Healing Salve
This salve is designed to reduce inflammation, speed healing, and lessen the possibility 
of infection with cuts, scrapes, and other injuries.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: 5 ounces
4 ounces herbal oil, such as St. John’s wort oil
3/4 ounce (by weight) beeswax
10 drops essential oil of your choice (lavender, 
orange, mint, or thyme)
Eight 1/2-ounce or four 1-ounce salve jars
 1 Pour the herbal oil into a saucepan or double boiler and heat gently to about 100 
degrees.
 2 Grate the beeswax with a cheese grater and add it slowly to hot oil, stirring it in well.
 3 Turn off the heat and allow the salve to cool in the pan for 5 minutes or so, but not so 
long that it gets so thick that you can’t easily stir in your essential oils. The consistency 
of a milkshake is about right.
 4 Add the essential oil to the mixture and stir.
 5 Pour the hot salve into salve jars or other suitable containers.
 6 When cool, cap and label for use.
Tip: When the salve is nearly set, a small crater may appear in the middle of the surface. 
To remedy, add a small amount of hot salve to the hole. When the salve cools, it should 
have a smooth surface.
Vary It! You can use herbal oils made of calendula, arnica, or yarrow rather than St. John’s 
wort. You can purchase these herbal oils readymade at a natural-foods or herb store. 
Calendula and arnica oils may also be available at pharmacies.

Preparing Liniments
A liniment is a liquid herbal preparation with a base of alcohol and oil for 
external application. Liniments are used for sore muscles to reduce pain and 
stiffness, increase blood flow, and accelerate healing. To increase blood cir-
culation, vigorously rub the liniment into the affected area. Liniments aren’t 
meant for internal use.
 
Ease-Up Liniment
This liniment can help your muscles loosen up. It’s good for soothing the pain and stiff-
ness of arthritis and for easing the pain of minor strains and sprains. It’s even great for 
sports buffs to use before or after a run or workout. Apply as needed to the injured area.

F
or thousands of years, herbs have been safe and effective medicines. 
Today, modern science is accumulating an impressive body of research 
on several healing herbs. Although the research is still preliminary to many 
hard-nosed scientists, even skeptics agree that herbs may just be the medi-
cine of the next century. This chapter lists more than 100 herbs with medici-
nal properties, alphabetized by their common names. Their Latin names 
appear in parentheses.
 
The information in this reference isn’t intended as a substitute for expert 
medical advice or treatment. Because each individual is unique, a profes-
sional healthcare provider must diagnose conditions and supervise treat-
ments for individual health problems. If you’re under a doctor’s care and 
receive advice that’s contrary to the information provided in this reference, 
follow your doctor’s advice.
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)
Add alfalfa to your supplement regime to help prevent elevated cholesterol. 
You can also use it as a gentle substitute for estrogen after menopause. The 
herb may also have cancer-protective properties.
Dosage: Take 3 to 5 grams a day as tea or in capsules (5 to 10 double-ought 
capsules with meals), or make a decoction by simmering 1 teaspoon of the 
herb in 1 cup of water for 20 minutes. Drink 1 cup, two or three times daily.

612
Book VI: Natural Health 
Aloe Vera (Aloe spp.)
Use aloe resin to relieve constipation and sluggish or dry bowel movements. 
The liquid gel cleanses the bowels and helps clear the skin of acne and 
rashes. Use aloe gel for burns. Aloe is also currently used as a mild antiviral 
for people with AIDS and HIV.
Dosage: Take 10 to 300 milligrams per day of the resin, before bed, in cap-
sules or tablets. You can add orange peel or fennel seed to reduce cramping. 
Follow the label instructions for the liquid gel.
 
Aloe resin can cause bowel cramping and diarrhea when you exceed the 
manufacturer’s recommended dose.
Angelica (Angelica archangelica L.)
Use angelica to improve your appetite and assimilation of nutrients. Use the 
root and seeds for poor digestion and gas.
Dosage: Make a decoction with 
1⁄2 to 1 teaspoon of the herb per 1 cup of 
water. Drink 1 cup three times daily, before meals, as a decoction, or take 
1⁄2 
to 1 teaspoon of the tincture in water, preferably before meals.
 
Avoid prolonged sunlight exposure and don’t use during pregnancy.
Arnica (Arnica montana L.)
Use Arnica liniments and oils for joint and muscle inflammation, sprains, 
bruises, and varicose veins. Use arnica in homeopathic form for shock or 
trauma to body tissues, or after an accident.
Dosage: Use the diluted tincture or oil externally, two or three times daily. 
Take the homeopathic preparation internally as directed on the packaging.
 
Don’t use on open wounds, because arnica can cause irritation. Don’t use 
arnica preparations internally, except in homeopathic dilution.
Artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.)
Use artichoke leaf preparations for poor appetite, weak digestion, and weight 
loss. They’re also good for gallbladder problems and high cholesterol.

Astragalus (Astragalus 
membranaceus Bunge)
Astragalus, also known by its Chinese name, Huang Qi (pronounced hwang-
chee), increases the body’s resistance to disease. The root is an ingredient in 
many products targeting general immune weakness and digestive weakness 
with lack of appetite. It’s also used as a supportive product — along with che-
motherapy and radiation — for the treatment of cancer.
Dosage: You can chop up four or five astragalus sticks with a pair of scissors 
and decoct the herb for up to an hour in 4 cups of water, drinking 1 strong 
cup in the morning and 1 cup in the evening. Blend astragalus with other 
tonic herbs like poria to balance the herb’s effects. Follow the directions on 
the bottle for capsules and tablets.
 
Avoid for about seven to ten days during an acute infection, such as the flu or 
a urinary tract infection. Otherwise, astragalus is safe. If you’re taking astrag-
alus for longer than two weeks, avoid the tincture form and instead take teas 
or dry extracts in capsule or tablet form.
Bilberry (Vaccinum myrtillus L.)
Use bilberry extracts to reduce capillary fragility, improve night vision, coun-
teract diarrhea, and help relieve the pain and distension of varicose veins.

herbalist. Don’t use for a period longer than six months.
Black Walnut (Juglans nigra L.)
Use black walnut hull liquid tincture to prevent and slow diarrhea (especially 
the kind caused by intestinal parasites, such as giardia). Use black walnut 
preparations to help treat candida infections and gastrointestinal irritation.
Dosage: Take 1 to 3 droppersful of the tincture, or 2 to 3 capsules, three to 
five times daily, depending on the severity of your symptoms.
 
Don’t use black walnut for more than a month at a time. Consult a qualified 
herbalist or physician if symptoms persist or are severe.
Bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis L.)
Use bloodroot to prevent plaque or treat gum problems. The rhizome extract 
is an ingredient in medicinal mouthwashes and toothpastes; it’s also a com-
ponent of many expectorants and cough syrups. The herb extract can treat 
skin cancers and fungal infections.
Dosage: Use 
1⁄2 to 1 dropperful in 2 or 3 ounces of water as a mouth rinse, or 
follow the manufacturer’s directions for using the mouthwash or toothpaste.

cancer. Apply a few drops of the tincture on a wart, or rub on 
1⁄2 teaspoon of a 
commercial cream for athlete’s foot.
 
Avoid using this herb during pregnancy. Don’t exceed the recommended 
dose because doing so can strongly irritate the skin, throat, and intestines. 
Consult a physician for a diagnosis if you suspect you have a skin cancer 
lesion.

Cascara Sagrada (Rhamnus 
purshiana DC.)
Cascara relieves constipation and moistens the bowels for dry, hard bowel 
movements or nonmovements. It’s also helpful as an addition to herbal for-
mulas for gallstones and hemorrhoids.
Dosage: Take 2 to 4 capsules of the powdered herb, or 1 to 3 droppersful 
of the liquid tincture in a little water, before bedtime. For other kinds of 
extracts, follow the manufacturer’s directions. You should experience a good 
bowel movement the next morning. If your cascara preparation doesn’t work, 
try increasing the dose by 50 percent for a few days. If constipation persists, 
see your herbalist.
 
Avoid using this herb if you’re pregnant, when you have persistent pain 
or obstruction of the intestines, or if you have a history of kidney stones. 
Children under age 12 should use the herb no longer than one week. Sensitive 
people who start with more than the recommended dose may experience 
diarrhea and bowel cramps. Reduce your dose by 50 percent and continue if 
you have persistent trouble with constipation, or consult your herbalist. To 
use cascara for the other uses mentioned in this section, consult with a quali-
fied healthcare practitioner.
Castor Oil (Riccinus communis L.)
Although castor oil is a favorite old-time remedy for constipation, its external 
use is more common today. The castor oil pack is popular for healing cancer-
ous and benign tumors of all kinds, and herbalists often recommend the poul-
tice for treating uterine fibroids and breast cysts.
Dosage: Take 1 to 2 tablespoons of the oil before bedtime, depending on your 
age and weight.
 
Don’t take castor oil internally longer than one week. Also, don’t use this

dried or fresh herb, two to three times daily.
 
Avoid using this herb during pregnancy.
Cayenne (Capsicum annum var. annum.)
Use cayenne powder or tincture if you have a cold, poor circulation, or weak 
digestion. In hotter climates, cayenne helps cool the body by promoting 
sweating. One of its active ingredients, capsaicin, is effective for blocking the 
transmission of the pain impulse in the body, and it’s found in commercial 
over-the-counter and prescription products for shingles, arthritis, carpal 
tunnel syndrome, and sore muscles.
Dosage: Take 1 to 4 capsules powder, twice daily. Follow the manufacturer’s 
directions for other products. (Note: The burning sensation you sometimes 
feel after ingesting cayenne won’t hurt you. In fact, studies show that cayenne 
can help heal an ulcer rather than aggravate one.)
 
Avoid getting cayenne near your eyes, because it can burn (but it won’t cause 
damage).
Chamomile, German (Matricaria 
recutita L.)
Drink chamomile tea liberally to help ease intestinal cramps or irritation, 
indigestion, and nervousness. You can also use chamomile tea for colic, 
fever, and teething in children. Externally, you can apply a chamomile cream 
for soothing skin inflammation, burns, and bites.
Dosage: Drink 1 cup of the infusion, made with 1 tablespoon of the herb, 
three to five times daily. You can make a strong instant tea by adding @bf1/2 
to 1 teaspoon of the tincture to a cup of warm water.
 
Allergic reactions to the pollen in the flowers are rare, but they do occur.

as hepatitis. Don’t use for more than two weeks except under the advice of 
your herbalist.
Cinnamon (Cinnamomum 
zeylanicum Blume)

every cup of water for 10 minutes; then steep for 15 minutes. Drink 1 cup, one 
to three times daily.
 
Cinnamon is a warming herb, so avoid the tea if you run hot all the time.
Cleavers (Galium aparine L.)
Cleaver (also known as bedstraw or goosegrass) cleanses the lymphatic 
system and shrinks swollen lymph glands. Consider using it if you have ton-
sillitis, psoriasis, or other skin conditions. It can also clear bladder infections, 
cleanse the urinary tract, and help prevent small kidney stones from forming.

make a slimy paste and apply to external injuries for as long as needed on 
unbroken skin and up to a week on broken skin, under the advice of an herb-
alist.

every cup of water. Drink 1 cup, two or three times daily, or 2 to 4 droppers-
ful of the tincture, one to three times daily.
 
Don’t use dandelion if you have bile-duct blockage, gallbladder inflammation, 
or intestinal blockage, except under the advice of an experienced herbalist. 
(Note: Don’t confuse the ever-present dandelion with similar-looking plants, 
such as sow thistle or false dandelion. Dandelion is the only one of the three 
that has single flowering heads on hollow, unbranched stalks and hairless, 
large-toothed leaves.)
Dong Quai (Angelica sinensis [Oliv.] 
Diels.)
Commonly taken by women for strengthening the blood and female organs, 
dong quai is also useful for coronary problems and mild anemia in both men 
and women. Use dong quai for anemia, PMS, and menopause, and if you’re 
experiencing general weakness, debility, and circulatory disorders, such as 
angina.
Dosage: Make a decoction by simmering 1 crown or 3 or 4 of the palm slices

Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)
Echinacea possesses strong immune-stimulating activity. Use it to help 
prevent and treat all kinds of infections, especially colds, flu, urinary tract 
infections, and skin infections such as impetigo and boils. You can also use 
echinacea as a mouthwash for gum problems.
Dosage: Take 2 droppersful to 1 teaspoon of the tincture, three or four times 
daily in cycles of two weeks on and one week off. Make a tea by simmering 
1 teaspoon of the chopped root or leaf in 1 cup of water for 10 minutes, and 
then steeping for 15 minutes. Drink 1 cup, several times daily. Follow the 
label instructions for other products.
 
Use echinacea cautiously under the advice of an herbal practitioner if you 
have an autoimmune condition such as lupus, or an immune-compromised 
condition such as AIDS.
Elder (Sambucus spp.)
Use elder to relieve colds, flu, and fevers; clear infections like acne, boils, 
skin rashes, and other forms of dermatitis; and strengthen resistance against 
infections. Herbalists sometimes also recommend elder for treating hay fever 
and sinusitis. The extracts can be an excellent remedy for chronic rheuma-
tism, neuralgia, and sciatica.
Dosage: For colds and fever, take 2 to 3 cups of the infusion, two to three 
times daily to induce sweating. Soaking in a hot bath or wrapping up in a 
sheet and a sleeping bag or blankets helps bring on a good flow of sweat, 
thereby eliminating toxins and speeding the healing process. Follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions for berry syrups and extracts in capsule or tablet 
form.
Eleuthero (Siberian Ginseng) 
(Eleutherococcus senticosus 
[Rupr. ex Maxim.] Maxim.)
Take eleuthero if you’re feeling tired or run-down, facing major changes in 
your life, living under stress, or serious about sports. Studies show that you 
may have more energy, get sick less often, have better workouts, or let stress 
roll off your back more easily with eleuthero.

(like eczema and psoriasis). Added to other herbal remedies like vitex, black 
cohosh, or skullcap, evening primrose may also help with PMS and breast 
tenderness.
Dosage: Take 250 to 500 milligrams of the oil daily, in capsules.
Eyebright (Euphrasia spp.)
Eyebright has anti-inflammatory and mild decongestant properties. Use it for

Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium 
[L.] Schulz-Bip.)
Use feverfew as a remedy for flu and other respiratory infections that are 
accompanied by a fever, as well as for migraine headaches and arthritis.

capsules of the powder or standardized extract daily.
 
Avoid using feverfew if you’re pregnant.
Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.)
Use flaxseed to ease constipation, inflammation, and irritation of the stom-
ach, intestines, and respiratory tract. Applied externally, it can draw out 
toxins, reduce inflammation, and speed healing. The regular use of flaxseed 
meal and some commercial oil products may help balance estrogen activity, 
reduce the risk of some cancers and heart disease, and benefit women who 
are going through menopause.
Dosage: Simmer 1 tablespoon of flaxseed or flaxseed meal in 2 cups of water 
and drink 1 cup, twice daily, as needed. Sprinkle flaxseed meal on cereals and 
other foods. Grind 1 or 2 tablespoons of flaxseed in a seed grinder or blender

Garlic (Allium sativum L.)
Garlic is an important antibiotic and antiviral remedy for colds, flu, bronchi-
tis, pneumonia, and other infections. Garlic preparations can also help pro-
tect the blood and cardiovascular system. With regular use, the herb slightly 
lowers your high blood pressure, reduces high cholesterol, and helps pre-
vent atherosclerosis. Garlic also kills and clears intestinal parasites.
Dosage: Take 2 to 4 perles of a garlic product daily, or follow the manufac-
turer’s directions. The therapeutic dose of whole garlic is two to three cloves 
daily with meals, either cooked or raw.
 
Avoid using garlic if you’re nursing. Raw garlic can sometimes irritate your 
stomach if you eat too much.

Use gentian root for weak digestion, poor appetite, and anemia. You can also 
use it if you’re recovering from an illness.
Dosage: Make a decoction by simmering

cup of water for 10 minutes, then steeping for 15 minutes. Drink 
1⁄2 cup of the 
decoction, or take 10 to 30 drops of the tincture, two to three times daily in a 
little water before meals. (Note: Because the root doesn’t contain tannins or 
other digestive irritants, it’s recommended for daily use and can be taken for 
years.)

times. You can also take 2 capsules of the powder, or 2 to 4 droppersful of 
the tincture, two to three times daily.
 
Avoid consuming more than 2 or 3 cups of ginger a day during pregnancy. 
The fresh rhizome is safer to use during pregnancy than the dried root.
Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.)
Use ginkgo extract to improve memory, increase mental alertness, and slow 
the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. The herb also restores circulation to 
your legs if you have blocked arteries and improves circulation to your eyes 
and ears, thus reducing ringing in the ears (tinnitis), protecting your eye-
sight, and helping to prevent and treat macular degeneration. You can also 
use ginkgo for autoimmune conditions, such as some forms of hepatitis and 
asthma.
Dosage: Take 2 to 3 droppersful of the tincture for up to a month or two for 
daily prevention or mild to moderate symptoms. For longer-term use or for 
moderate to severe symptoms, use 1 capsule or tablet containing 60 milli-
grams of the standardized extract, two to three times daily.
 
The highly purified extract containing 24 percent flavone glycosides can 
cause mild gastrointestinal irritation if you’re sensitive.
Ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Mey.)
Take ginseng if you have digestive problems like gas or malabsorption, or if 
you commonly experience a feeling of fullness, even after eating only small 
meals. You can also use it for chronic fatigue, convalescence, lethargy, 
depression, and chronic infections related to immune weakness, especially if 
you’re over age 45.
Dosage: Make a decoction by simmering 1 level teaspoon of the ground-up 
root for every cup of water and drink 1 cup, two to three times daily. Take 
1 to 3 droppersful of the tincture, or 1 to 2 capsules of the standardized 
extract, two to three times daily.

either 
1⁄2 to 1 teaspoon of the tincture in a little water or 2 capsules or tablets 
containing a powdered extract that you consume with your morning and eve-
ning meals.
 
Don’t use ginseng if you feel anxious — it’s slightly stimulating.
Goldenrod (Solidago spp.)
Goldenrod stimulates kidney function and increases the flow of urine output.

Internally, take goldenseal preparations to reduce inflammation, for bacterial 
infections of the upper respiratory tract and urinary tract, and for bacterial 
or amebic infections of the digestive tract, such as giardia and dysentery. 
The herb isn’t as effective for viral conditions like colds and flu, gastritis, and 
sinus infections. Externally, use goldenseal tea as a wash for conjunctivitis 
and gum problems and as a douche for vaginal infections from candida or 
trichomonas.
Dosage: You can take 1 to 2 droppersful of the tincture, or 1 to 2 capsules, 
twice daily. Make a light decoction with 
1⁄2 teaspoon of the herb for each cup 
of water and drink 1 cup, up to three times daily, as needed.

628
Book VI: Natural Health 
 
Don’t use goldenseal if you’re pregnant. Contrary to popular belief, gold-
enseal isn’t effective for clearing drugs out of the body to help you pass a 
drug-detection test.
Gotu Kola (Centella asiatica 
[L.] Urban.)
Use gotu kola internally for improving your memory and supporting your 
mental functions and nervous system. Use creams and external preparations

2 to 3 cups of the infusion made from the dried herb, two to three times daily.
Grapeseed (Vitis vinifera L.)
Grapeseed extract helps protect the skin and internal organs against the rav-
ages of stress and environmental toxins. Regular use of grape skin and seed 
extracts may help protect you from developing cancer. The seed extract con-
tains potent antioxidant compounds that some researchers claim may slow 
down the aging process.
Dosage: Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the packaging. Or, 
depending on your need, take 1 or 2 capsules of the extract, one or two times 
daily.
Green Tea (Camellia sinensis 
[L.] Kuntze.)
Green tea may protect you against heart disease, ulcers, and cancer. It can 
also help relieve diarrhea, reduce pain, and invigorate the mind and the ner-
vous system. Use it as a mouthwash to prevent plaque formation.
Dosage: Make a cup of tea with 1 teaspoon of loose herb for every cup of 
water and drink 2 to 3 cups of the infusion daily. Follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions for other products, but know that generally 1 or 2 capsules a day 
of the standardized extract is recommended.
 
Green tea contains 4 or 5 percent caffeine. Avoid using the herb if you have 
heart palpitations or experience insomnia or anxiety, or just use the decaf-
feinated varieties instead.

system and may cause anxiety, nervousness, or sleeplessness. Several 
people have died from using excessive quantities of this herb to stimulate 
energy. Regular use of ma huang products robs the digestive system of the 
energy it needs to properly digest and assimilate important nutrients and can 
adversely affect your energy and immune function, nervous system, and car-
diovascular system.
Marshmallow (Althaea officinalis L.)
Marshmallow root reduces irritation and inflammation of bronchitis and 
other respiratory tract infections with sore throat. Use marshmallow to help 
soothe a urinary tract that’s inflamed with cystitis or to relieve the effects of

Plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.)
Internally, plantain leaves soothe inflamed and infected tissues of the respira-
tory, urinary, and digestive tracts. Take the tea liberally for relieving coughs, 
ulcers, irritable bowel, colitis, cystitis, and painful urination. Externally, the 
fresh leaves quickly reduce the pain of bites, stings, cuts, scrapes, and burns. 
Use a slimy wad of the herb inside the mouth for easing the inflammation and 
pain of infected gums, gum disease, and abscesses.

fresh herb in 2 cups of water for a few minutes and steeping the herb for 15 
minutes or so. Drink 1 cup, two or three times daily.
Red Clover (Trifolium pratense L.)
Red clover flowers can help eliminate toxins in the liver and bowels and stim-
ulate immune function to assist the body in removing toxic waste products; 
they’re also effective as a mild expectorant and cleanser for the respiratory 
tract for helping to heal lung problems, such as dry coughs, laryngitis, bron-
chitis, and whooping cough. Red clover can also help relieve skin problems 
such as eczema, psoriasis, acne, and other kinds of dermatitis. This herb is 
an important component in well-respected formulas that assist the body in 
its fight with cancer; red clover is also used to help prevent the disease.
Dosage: Make a tea by simmering 1 tablespoon of the herb for each cup of 
water for 15 to 20 minutes. Drink 1 cup, or take

tion. For the elderly, rosemary invigorates the nervous system and digestion 
and helps preserve good health. Rosemary tea hair rinses are excellent for 
keeping your hair shiny and healthy. Add a pot of tea to your bath to make an 
invigorating and restorative rosemary bath.

St. John’s Wort (Hypericum 
perforatum L.)
Take St. John’s wort internally if you’re depressed or have insomnia, or if you 
want to relieve chronic nerve pain caused by conditions such as peripheral 
neuropathy or trauma and injuries that involve nerve damage. St. John’s wort 
can also be used for children who wet the bed. Used externally, the herb 
reduces inflammation and the pain of scrapes, bruises, strains, burns, and 
other trauma.
Dosage: The effective dose of St. John’s wort is about 4 droppersful of the 
tincture in the morning and 3 in the evening in a little water, or 2 capsules of 
a standardized extract in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening. You can 
go up to 1 teaspoon of the tincture, or 2 capsules or tablets, morning and 
evening, as needed. You can make an infusion of St. John’s wort if you want 
to, but that isn’t as effective as the other preparations. Apply the oil, or any 
other external preparation, liberally as needed, preferably at least twice a 
day. (Note: A review of several commercial standardized extract products 
in capsules and tablets showed that the products actually delivered from 30 
percent to 80 percent of the advertised levels of active constituents. For this 
reason, if you’ve tried capsules with no results, try taking a teaspoon of the 
tincture in the morning and 
1⁄2 to 
3⁄4 teaspoon in the evening for a month.)
 
Avoid regular use of this herb when taking pharmaceutical MAO-inhibitors or 
if you have fair skin.

gies, candida, AIDS, and cancer. Scientific studies show that shiitake is a 
potent immune booster, cancer-fighter, and antiviral herb.
Dosage: Take 3 or 4 tablets or capsules of a concentrated extract twice daily 
with meals. Take half that amount for prevention and general health-promot-
ing benefits. Eating shiitake, which is widely available as a food in grocery

Thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.)
Drink a cup of strong, antiseptic thyme tea to help eliminate coughs, mucus 
congestion, or sore throat associated with colds or the flu. You can also take 
this herb for bronchitis or pneumonia. Use thyme sprays, syrups, or lozenges

Usnea Thallus (Usnea 
barbata [L.] Wigg.)
Many lichens, usnea thallus included, produce strong antibiotic compounds. 
Use usnea when you have conditions such as strep throat, a staph infection 
(like impetigo), urinary tract infections, and pneumonia.
Dosage: Take 2 to 4 droppersful of the tincture, two to three times daily.
Uva Ursi (Arctostaphylos 
uva-ursi [L.] Spreng.)
Consider taking uva ursi if you have a bladder infection or mild kidney 
infection.
Dosage: Make a tea by simmering 1 tablespoon of the leaves in 2 cups of 
water for 30 to 40 minutes, until the water is reduced to 1 cup. Drink 
1⁄2 cup 
of the tea twice daily. Add 1 teaspoon of the tincture to a cup of water and 
drink 
1⁄2 of the cup in the morning and evening. For persistent infections, you 
may find a double dose effective, but consult an experienced herbalist first. 
Because uva ursi works better when the urine is acidic, take the tea or tinc-
ture concurrently with cranberry juice or tablets.
 
Avoid using this herb while pregnant. Don’t use in cases of chronic kidney 
disorders or digestive irritation without the advice of an experienced 
herbalist.
Valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.)
Use valerian to calm the nervous system if you feel nervous, anxious, or 
upset, and to promote healthy sleep. Also, try the herb for menstrual cramps 
(with cramp bark), heart palpitations (with hawthorn or hops), or for pain 
(with Roman chamomile or Jamaican dogwood). (Note: Don’t use standard-
ized extracts of valerian available in capsules or tablets because the active 
ingredients often break down when the rhizomes are so highly processed.)
Dosage: You have to take valerian in a strong dose for it to be effective. Start 
with 
1⁄2 teaspoon of the tincture, several times daily in a little water, and 
increase to 1 teaspoon if this dosage isn’t working. The tea is also effective. 
Make an infusion with 1 tablespoon of the cut and sifted herb for every cup 
of water. Steep the valerian for 30 minutes in a closed pot and drink 1 cup, 
several times daily.

644
Book VI: Natural Health 
 
Valerian has few side effects, but some people find the rhizome can cause 
stimulation rather than a feeling of calm. You can reduce the chance of this 
situation happening if you avoid valerian when you have chronic fatigue or 
depression (try California poppy or passion flower instead) or if you consult 
an herbalist first.
Vitex (Vitex agnus-castus L.)
Take vitex if you have symptoms associated with PMS and menopause. It’s 
also effective for helping a woman ease off of birth control pills, increasing 
the flow of mother’s milk, and reducing teen acne (although it doesn’t work 
as well for teens with a strong family history of acne who are continuously 
broken out).
Dosage: Take 1 to 2 droppersful of the tincture daily, first thing in the morn-
ing, or 2 to 4 capsules containing the powdered herb, twice daily. You can 
try a double dose if the regular dose doesn’t work after two or three months. 
Follow the label instructions for standardized extracts.
 
Avoid using vitex if you’re pregnant or taking birth control pills, except under 
the advice of an experienced herbalist.
White Willow (Salix spp.)
Willow bark is an ancient medicine and a source for aspirin. Use willow bark 
tea if you have a headache, fever, pain, or an inflammatory condition such as 
carpal tunnel syndrome, rheumatism, or arthritis.
Dosage: Make a decoction by simmering 1 tablespoon of the cut and sifted 
bark for every cup of water for 10 minutes; then let the brew steep for 
another 10 minutes. Drink 1 cup, two or three times daily.
Wild Oats (Avena fatua L.)
Take wild oats if you have trouble with depression, nerve weakness from too 
much mental work, or an addiction (like smoking) that you’re trying to beat.
Dosage: Make a tea by simmering 
1⁄4 cup of the spikelets for every cup of 
water for 20 minutes. Drink 1 cup of the tea, or take 
1⁄2 to 1 teaspoon of the 
tincture in a little water, three or four times daily as needed. Best results 
come after taking wild oats for a few months; you can take the herb up to a 
year or more.

Natural 
Health
Wild Yam (Dioscorea villosa L.)
Use wild yam for easing the cramping of colic, intestinal and uterine spasms, 
and gallbladder pain. It’s also an effective addition to herbal formulas for 
nausea, morning sickness, and chronic rheumatism. (Note: You can find 
wild yam in bulk for making teas, but be careful not to try grinding it in your 
blender — it’s so tough that it can break the blades! Buy the herb already cut 
and sifted.)
Dosage: Make a tea by boiling 1 teaspoon of the herb for every cup of water 
for 40 minutes. Drink 1 cup, or take 2 to 4 droppersful of the tincture in a little 
water, two to three times daily.
Witch Hazel (Hamamelis virginiana L.)
Consider taking witch hazel internally for hemorrhoids, varicose veins, or 
diarrhea. Externally, witch hazel is a favorite remedy for stopping the bleed-
ing of cuts, removing spots and blemishes, and toning the skin.
Dosage: Use 
1⁄4 to 
1⁄2 cup of the bark or dried leaves to make a light decoction 
by simmering for 20 minutes. Take 
1⁄2 to 1 cup of the tea, two or three times 
daily, or apply the lotion externally as needed.
 
Use of witch hazel tea or tincture for more than a few days can worsen con-
stipation in some cases.
Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.)
Use wormwood if you have a poor appetite, sweet cravings, stomach weak-
ness, painful digestion, or worms. Wormwood can also help you regain 
strength after a prolonged or serious illness or operation. Wormwood tea is 
a popular healing drink in Europe for easing the symptoms of stomach irrita-
tion and gastritis, or for strengthening and lifting sagging digestive organs.
Dosage: Make an infusion of wormwood by steeping 1 teaspoon to 1 table-
spoon of the dried herb for every cup of water for 20 minutes. Drink 
1⁄2 to 1 
cup of the tea, or 20 to 30 drops of the tincture in a little water, several times 
daily and before meals.
 
Avoid using wormwood if you’re pregnant or nursing. Don’t exceed the 
recommended dose and don’t use the tincture for more than a few weeks at a 
time without first consulting an herbalist.

Book VI: Natural Health 
Yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.)
Take yarrow for a variety of conditions: to relieve mucus congestion, inflam-
mation, and fever from colds, flu, and other upper respiratory infections; to 
regulate blood flow throughout the body; to relieve pain from arthritis and 
rheumatism; to relieve spasms and inflammation, irritable bowel complaints, 
colic, and intestinal and uterine cramps; to relax the bowels and improve 
digestion, as well as help prevent and treat gallstones and gallbladder inflam-
mation; and to help with sluggish or painful menses, fever, delayed menstrua-
tion, poor appetite, and convalescence.
Dosage: Make an infusion by steeping 
1⁄4 cup of the bulk herb for every 2 cups 
of water for 20 or 30 minutes. Drink 1 cup of the tea, or 1 to 3 droppersful of 
the tincture in a little water, two or three times daily. Take yarrow for sev-
eral weeks or months to experience the best results. (Note: The best form of 
yarrow is the fresh herb right from a wild place or garden, but a good quality 
dry herb works fine.)
 
Avoid using this herb while pregnant.
Yellow Dock (Rumex crispus L.)
Yellow dock is a common weed, but don’t underestimate its powers. Its root is 
a magnificent bowel balancer and blood tonic. Use it to treat constipation, slug-
gish bowels, or loose stools. Consider adding yellow dock to formulas to help 
cleanse parasites and worms from the intestines and to perk up the appetite.
Dosage: To make a tea, simmer 1 teaspoon of the cut and sifted herb for 
every cup of water for 20 minutes. Drink 1 cup of the tea, or 3 to 5 droppers-
ful of the tincture in a little water, two or three times daily.
 
Avoid using this herb if you have kidney stones.
Yerba Santa (Eriodictyon californicum 
[Hook. Et Arn.] Torr.)
Consider yerba santa if you have respiratory congestion, a cold, asthma, or a 
moist cough. Yerba santa is a warming expectorant that helps remove excess 
damp, cold mucus so you can breathe easier. The herb is especially useful 
during the cold, damp months of the year.
Dosage: Make an infusion by steeping 
1⁄4 cup of the dry herb for every 2 cups 
of water for 30 minutes. Drink 1 cup of the tea, or take 10 to 30 drops of the 
tincture, three times daily.
